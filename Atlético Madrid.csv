0,13/02/2021,23:14,Messi leads Barca to thumping Alaves win,Barcelona might not be able to catch Atletico Madrid but they may fancy their chances against Paris Saint-Germain after Lionel Messi scored twice in a 5-1 thrashing of Alaves on Saturday.,"Messi fired in two sensational long-range efforts and would have had a hat-trick at Camp Nou had a dubious VAR decision in the first half not ruled Antoine Griezmann offside. He did tee up a second of the night for the 21-year-old Francisco Trincao and was instrumental in Junior Firpo adding a fifth too, a flamboyant scoop freeing Griezmann to send a pass to Firpo at the back post. Victory means Barca trail Atletico Madrid by eight points again after Atletico had temporarily pulled 11 clear thanks to a hard-fought 2-1 win over Granada earlier on Saturday. Barcelona and Real Madrid have both played a game more than Atleti, with Zinedine Zidane's side facing Valencia at home on Sunday. Atletico's win was a significant psychological boost on the back of slipping up for the first time in nine games at home to Celta Vigo earlier this week. Their advantage may prove too large to close but Barcelona's tie against PSG in the Champions League, which looked to have the French side as firm favourites when the draw was made in December, now feels harder to call. Mauricio Pochettino's side will probably be favourites ahead of the first leg at Camp Nou on Tuesday but Barca have certainly found form in recent weeks, and Messi looks close to his lethal best. The question is whether a free-flowing attack, full of talent and orchestrated by Messi, can hurt PSG enough to make up for what remains a shaky defence, depleted by injuries and vulnerable to the counter-attack. With Gerard Pique and the emerging Ronald Araujo both out injured, Frenkie de Jong filled in again in central defence, although the Dutchman has arguably been Barcelona's most improved player this year in the midfield three. Instead there was a start for Ilaix Kourouma in midfield, the 18-year-old academy product who assisted Trincao's opening goal but whose misplaced pass led to Luis Rioja briefly giving Alaves hope. After Trincao had swept home, Messi thought he had made it two, pouncing on a rebound after Griezmann missed but the goal was ruled out, even though replays suggested Griezmann was onside. Messi made amends soon after, latching onto a Sergio Busquets pass, darting in-field and ripping a shot in off the post. Rioja capitalised on Ilaix's mistake just before the hour but Barca pulled away with three goals in six minutes. Pedri's pass freed Messi but he failed to round Fernando Pacheco and instead the ball spilled out for Trincao to score his second. Messi slammed a stinging strike into the top corner from 25 yards to make it 4-1 before perhaps the goal of the night came last, Messi scooping over for Griezmann, who volleyed to the back post where Firpo could not miss. Atletico had earlier swerved a second consecutive slip by squeezing past Granada at Los Carmenes, a victory secured by Angel Correa's fortuitous winner in the second half. There was a hint of luck in Granada's equaliser too, Yangel Herrera's shot deflecting off Marcos Llorente, who had himself put Atletico in front only three minutes earlier. ""The most important thing today was the fight and the energy of the team,"" said Simeone afterwards. At the full-time whistle, he shook his fists and sprinted down the tunnel, his relief evident at the end of a game that could easily have seen more points dropped for his side. Luis Suarez had scored in six of the previous seven games but for once the 34-year-old was not the matchwinner, with Llorente and Correa -- two unsung heroes this season -- instead proving the difference. Llorente's goal was his seventh of the season while his lay-off for Correa was his sixth assist. ""As coaches trophies are wonderful because they fill you with excitement and glory,"" Simeone said of Llorente. ""But when you work with a footballer and see them grow, you feel even more joy and more enthusiasm to keep doing what you're doing."""
1,13/02/2021,16:12,Atletico back to winning ways with narrow Granada victory,Atletico Madrid swerved a second consecutive slip in La Liga on Saturday by squeezing past Granada 2-1 to move eight points clear at the top of the table.,"After drawing at home to Celta Vigo on Monday, Diego Simeone's side got back on track with a narrow victory at Los Carmenes, secured by Angel Correa's fortuitous winner in the second half. There was a hint of luck in Granada's equaliser too, Yangel Herrera's shot deflecting off Marcos Llorente, who had himself put Atletico in front only three minutes earlier. Barca, who are third and 11 points behind the leaders, face Alaves at home later on Saturday before Real Madrid host Valencia on Sunday. ""The most important thing today was the fight and the energy of the team,"" said Simeone afterwards. At the full-time whistle, he shook his fists and sprinted down the tunnel, his relief evident at the end of a game that could easily have seen more points dropped for his side. Granada have been one of the stories of the season, sitting eighth under Diego Lopez after being promoted two years ago, and they were far from outclassed by La Liga's frontrunners. Suarez had scored in six of the previous seven games but for once the 34-year-old was not the matchwinner, with Llorente and Correa - two unsung heroes this season - instead proving the difference. Llorente's goal was his seventh of the season while his lay-off for Correa was his sixth assist. ""As coaches trophies are wonderful because they fill you with excitement and glory,"" Simeone said of Llorente. ""But when you work with a footballer and see them grow, you feel even more joy and more enthusiasm to keep doing what you're doing."" Suarez went closest to giving Atletico the lead when his shot into the ground flew up and grazed the crossbar just after half-time. A miscontrol by the Uruguayan at the back post saw another chance go begging but Llorente took over, nipping in from the right and dragging a shot with his left foot inside the near post. It was the first of three goals in 11 minutes, as Herrera equalised shortly after. Atletico's Yannick Carrasco and Saul Niguez were both guilty of light challenges on Jorge Molina, who battled to shift the ball into the path of Herrera, whose finish hit Llorente and crept in. But eight minutes later, Atletico were ahead again, the final shot taken by Correa, after more good work from Llorente. Correa weaved into space in the area, his driven effort skipping up off Jesus Vallejo and looping into the far corner."
2,10/02/2021,12:24,Atletico Madrid v Chelsea Champions League match moved to Bucharest,"Atletico Madrid's home match against Chelsea in the Champions League last-16 has been moved from Spain to Bucharest as a result of coronavirus restrictions, UEFA confirmed on Wednesday.","The first-leg tie will be staged at the Arena Nationala in the Romanian capital. Chelsea said in a statement on their website that the date of the match, February 23, and the kick-off time (2000 GMT) would remain the same. The second leg is scheduled to take place at Stamford Bridge in London on March 17. It is the latest European match to be switched to a different venue as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Spanish government on Tuesday extended a ban on arrivals by air from Britain, Brazil and South Africa until March 2 over new variants. Only legal residents or nationals of Spain and the neighbouring micro-state of Andorra are currently allowed in on flights from those countries. In changes previously announced, Manchester City's first leg of their Champions League tie against Borussia Moenchengladbach will be played in Budapest while Liverpool's match against RB Leipzig has also been relocated to the Hungarian capital. The Champions League, Europe's top club competition, was heavily disrupted by the pandemic last season. It was placed on hold when sport across Europe was halted in March. UEFA then took the decision to complete the competition as a ""Final Eight"" tournament in Lisbon in August, without spectators. Bayern Munich beat Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 in the final. There have also been changes in this season's Europa League as a result of virus rules. Arsenal and Manchester United have had the first legs of their last-32 matches moved. The Gunners will take on Benfica in Rome, while United's meeting with Real Sociedad has been switched from San Sebastian to Turin."
3,08/02/2021,23:08,Suarez strikes twice but Atletico stumble against Celta,Atletico Madrid slipped up in La Liga for the first time in nine games on Monday as Celta Vigo snatched a late equaliser to deliver a ray of hope to Barcelona and Real Madrid.,"Luis Suarez scored twice at the Wanda Metropolitano to overturn Santi Mina's opener for Celta, with Atletico on course to restore their 10-point lead at the top of the table. Instead, Facundo Ferreyra slid in to score in the 89th minute to earn a deserved 2-2 draw for the visitors, meaning Atletico's advantage at the end of the weekend is reduced to eight, still with a game in hand. It remains a large cushion but after Madrid and Barca beat Huesca and Real Betis respectively, there is at least room for encouragement for the chasing pack. Real Madrid can cut the gap to five points if they win at home to Getafe on Tuesday. Suarez shows no sign of letting up, the Uruguayan now with 11 goals in his last nine games and 16 for the season. Those 16 goals in 17 games played for Atletico makes him the fastest player to score that many for one La Liga club in the 21st century, one game faster than Cristiano Ronaldo after he joined Real Madrid. Celta were the better side in the first half, dominating possession and taking a deserved lead after 13 minutes when Hugo Mallo curled in a cross from the right for Mina to head in. Atletico rarely troubled Celta but managed to go in level, Suarez scoring with their first shot on target. Marcos Llorente's driven cross evaded four sets of Celta toes and found him at the back post. Lucas Torreira came on at half-time for Felipe -- Atletico reverting to a back four -- and within five minutes they were ahead. Geoffrey Kondogbia floated a ball out to the left and Renan Lodi volleyed it across goal, where the sliding Suarez arrived on his knees to finish. Celta almost had a second when Iago Aspas bundled through but Kondogbia darted back to make a superb tackle, just as the striker was about to shoot. Atletico were moments away but caved with one minute left, a brilliant through ball by Aspas freeing Augusto Solari, whose cross found Ferreyra two metres out."

""The striker remains isolated at his home, strictly complying with the recommendations of the health authorities and La Liga protocol,"" the club added. Dembele, 24, joined Atletico on loan in January from Lyon until the end of the season but the French striker is yet to make an appearance for the La Liga leaders."
5,03/02/2021,11:19,Atletico Madrid forward Felix has Covid-19,La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid suffered a blow on Wednesday when the club announced that forward Joao Felix had become the third player in two weeks to test positive for Covid-19.,"""Joao Felix has tested positive for Covid-19. The striker is isolating at home, in compliance with the health authorities' guidelines and La Liga protocols,"" Atletico said in a statement. The 21-year-old Portuguese player joins teammates Yannick Carrasco and Mario Hermoso, who tested positive for coronavirus last week, on the sidelines. Neither Carrasco nor Hermoso were allowed to play in the 4-2 Liga victory against Cadiz on Sunday that gave Atletico a 10-point lead over second-placed Barcelona."
6,02/02/2021,13:39,Supporters groups dismiss 'dangerous' European Super League plan,"Plans to create a breakaway European Super League for an elite group of the continent's wealthiest clubs have been dismissed as ""unpopular, illegitimate, and dangerous"" by a collective of supporters groups.","""It would destroy the European model of sport, which is based on commonly accepted principles such as sporting merit, promotion and relegation, qualification to European competitions via domestic success, and financial solidarity,"" said a statement released on the initiative of Football Supporters Europe (FSE) and signed by more than 100 groups of supporters of club sides and national teams. ""It would also undermine the economic foundations of European football, concentrating even more wealth and power in the hands of a dozen or so elite clubs,"" the statement added. Among the signatories were Liverpool's Spirit of Shankly Supporters' Union as well as groups from Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid. Documents containing details of the Super League, first reported last month by British newspaper The Times, proposed a 20-club tournament with 15 permanent members, including the English Premier League's 'Big Six', three each from Spain and Italy, two from Germany and one from France. Five other clubs would qualify annually, the report said, but founding members would receive up to 350 million euros ($425m) each just to join the competition. At the same time discussions are still ongoing about the future format of the UEFA Champions League, currently the world's most lucrative and prestigious club competition which is due for reform of some kind from 2024 onwards. ""We recognise that the game is in desperate need of broad reform. ""But proposals to this end must seek to revive the competitive balance in European competitions, protect domestic leagues, promote the interests of fans, and encourage fairer revenue distribution,"" the statement added. ""A European Super League would achieve none of these objectives -- quite the opposite."" Javier Tebas, the president of Spain's La Liga, is one of the leading voices against the project, which he insisted is ""not going to happen"" in an interview with AFP at the weekend. ""The whole system will be against it and it won't just sit on its hands. It's going to fight,"" said Tebas, who also accused FIFA chief Gianni Infantino of supporting the plan, which he says has been driven by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, as well as the American owners of Liverpool, Manchester United and AC Milan."
7,31/01/2021,23:09,Messi shows his worth but Atletico stretches lead,Lionel Messi underlined his worth to Barcelona by scoring a sensational free-kick on Sunday but Atletico Madrid are in charge of La Liga after beating Cadiz to stand 10 points clear at the top of the table.,"Messi's stunning effort in a 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao had been matched by the Argentinian's friend and former team-mate Luis Suarez, who earlier curled in a superb free-kick of his own in Atletico's 4-2 victory over Cadiz. Atletico end the weekend even further ahead after Real Madrid's defeat by Levante on Saturday, which means Zinedine Zidane's side are now level with Barca on points, both of them struggling to keep pace in the title race. ""Every game is an important step towards reaching the goal we set ourselves at the start of the season,"" said Diego Simeone. ""We have to keep pushing each other."" Barca's win at least maintains their momentum while Messi's 650th club goal may have carried extra satisfaction for the Argentinian, who had the details of his contract published in the Spanish newspaper El Mundo on Saturday night. El Mundo claimed the deal signed by Messi in 2017 shows he could earn up to 555 million euros over its four years, describing it as ""the colossal contract that ruined Barcelona"". ""Someone has done it with bad intentions to cause problems,"" said Ronald Koeman. ""You have to respect a player who has given so much to Spanish football and to this club. I didn't have any doubts that it wouldn't affect him on the pitch."" Few can argue with Messi's contribution in that regard, with the 33-year-old showing against Bilbao why the club have gone to such lengths to keep him. Bilbao briefly drew level through a Jordi Alba own-goal early in the second half but Antoine Griezmann's strike secured Barca their third consecutive victory, with Ousmane Dembele and Frenkie de Jong both impressive again. Asked what Messi worth is to the team, Griezmann said: ""What a question, we are enjoying him, he is a legend. I hope we can keep enjoying him for many more years."" But Barcelona continue to be haunted by the spectre of Suarez, whose tremendous free-kick and then a penalty helped Atletico push their advantage into double figures. While Messi's free-kick was closer and bent perfectly into the top right-hand corner, Suarez's shot was further out and hit harder, a fizzing effort that curled into the left side of the net. ""The other day they were practising free-kicks,"" said Simeone. ""I told him we had not seen him score many goals from free-kicks so that's why I smiled when I saw him score this one."" ""After spending so long at Barca with Messi, it was difficult,"" added Suarez. He was the driving force again, his two goals making it nine in his last eight games and 14 now for the season. His goals and assists have now earned Atletico 12 extra points in the league, with Barcelona's decision to let him leave, especially for title rivals, seeming more misjudged by the week. It could get even worse for them and Real Madrid, given Simeone's side still have a game in hand over each of them. Both would have been given hope by a rousing display from newly-promoted Cadiz, who were inspired by the relentless Alvaro Negredo. The 35-year-old scored twice, could have had a hat-trick and certainly did not deserve to be on the losing side. But Suarez's double, between goals from Saul Niguez and Koke late on, sealed another three points for Atletico, who now have the La Liga crown within reach, even with half of the season left to play."
8,31/01/2021,18:33,Suarez double at Cadiz sends Atletico 10 points clear,Luis Suarez sent Atletico Madrid 10 points clear at the top of La Liga on Sunday by scoring a sensational free-kick and then a penalty in a pulsating 4-2 win over Cadiz.,"Atletico's victory puts their lead at the top of the table into double figures and it could get even worse for the chasing pack, given Diego Simeone's side still have a game in hand. Real Madrid remain closest despite their defeat by Levante on Saturday while Barcelona are now 13 points back, although they could reduce the gap when they play at home to Athletic Bilbao later on Sunday. Both would have been given hope by a rousing display from newly-promoted Cadiz, who were inspired by the relentless Alvaro Negredo. The 35-year-old scored twice, could have had a hat-trick and certainly did not deserve to be on the losing side. But Suarez's double, between goals from Saul Niguez and Koke late on, sealed another three points for Atletico, who now have the La Liga crown within their grasp, even with half of the season left to play. Suarez was their driving force yet again, his two goals making it nine in his last eight games and 14 for the season. His goals and assists have now earned Atletico 12 extra points in the league, with Barcelona's decision to let him leave, and join title rivals, seeming more misjudged by the week. Atletico took the lead in the 35th minute after the marauding Joao Felix was brought down a few yards outside the penalty area. Suarez stepped up and sent a superb shot, curling into the left-hand corner. Cadiz rallied and then capitalised on some lethargic Atletico defending as Negredo was too strong for Thomas Lemar on the right of the area after Felipe had failed to cover. Negredo whipped a left-footed shot into the far corner of Jan Oblak's net. Atletico edged ahead again when Saul's touch from Lemar's cross looped, seemingly inadvertently, over Jeremias Ledesma and in before Cadiz had a penalty, Koke's hand touching the ball only for VAR to prompt the referee to rule it out. Cadiz's frustration was compounded by Atletico being awarded a penalty three minutes after half-time, Marcos Lopez clattering Lemar and Suarez making no mistake. Fali Jimenez almost pulled one back for Cadiz but his mishit cross dropped onto the crossbar and then Negredo did, his scuffed finish bobbling in with 20 minutes left after Atletico failed to clear. Negredo was on a mission. He rose high to meet Fali's cross but headed straight into the hands of Oblak and then nodded over for Saponjic, who looked certain to head in from five yards but Oblak was there again. All hope was extinguished in the 88th minute when Angel Correa, on as a substitute scuttled onto a loose ball and squared for Koke to tap in a fourth."
9,25/01/2021,14:00,"Atletico, Bayern surge clear but game on in France: European talking points","It was a very good weekend for Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich as they extended their leads at the top in Spain and Germany respectively, but it remains tight at the top in France and Italy while Portugal's sleeping giants claimed silverware.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Atletico Madrid are towering over their rivals atop La Liga after beating Valencia 3-1 on Sunday, inspired by goals from Joao Felix and Luis Suarez. Diego Simeone's side had to come from behind to get the points, three days after Suarez's late penalty secured a 2-1 win at Eibar. Real Madrid won 4-1 at Alaves and Barcelona were 2-0 winners at Elche but this is Atletico's title to lose now, even if the season is barely at its midway point. They are seven points clear of Real in second, and 10 above Barcelona in third, with a game in hand on each. ""The best way to live in this moment is to take it one game at a time,"" said Simeone, repeating the mantra that worked wonders in Atletico's last title-winning campaign in 2013/14. The Bundesliga is arguably the most exciting league in Europe just now and yet any hopes of a lasting title race are fading after Bayern Munich went seven points clear, making the most of slip-ups by their challengers. Hansi Flick's side have bounced back from a recent blip and their 4-0 crushing of bottom team Schalke was their third win in eight days. It came after second-placed RB Leipzig lost 3-2 at struggling Mainz, leaving them with just one win in four. Meanwhile third-placed Bayer Leverkusen, superb in beating Borussia Dortmund in midweek, lost at home to Wolfsburg. Dortmund have slipped to seventh after losing 4-2 at Borussia Moenchengladbach, a result which underlined why they are apparently so keen to make Gladbach's Marco Rose the long-term replacement to the sacked Lucien Favre. AC Milan's resurgence has been remarkable and they are top at the halfway point in Serie A, meaning they earn the symbolic crown of winter champions. However, they slumped to a 3-0 home loss against Atalanta at San Siro, a second defeat in four following a run of 27 league games unbeaten. That suggests they may struggle to hold onto top spot in the run-in, and they only remain two points clear after Inter were held 0-0 at Udinese. ""Being winter champions means nothing to me,"" said Milan star Zlatan Ibrahimovic. ""Now the difficult phase begins."" While reigning champions Juventus beat Bologna, maybe irrepressible Atalanta are the ones to really look out for. The Bergamo side are, like Juve, seven points off the lead, but they are 10 games unbeaten, a run which has seen them score 26 goals while beating Milan and Roma, and drawing in Turin. Paris Saint-Germain are finding their form under new coach Mauricio Pochettino if Friday's 4-0 thumping of 10-man Montpellier was anything to go by. With Kylian Mbappe scoring twice and Neymar on target on his 100th appearance, they showed they will take some stopping. However, the good news is there is a proper title race in France, with Lille grinding out a superb 1-0 win at Rennes thanks to Canada striker Jonathan David and Lyon winning a one-sided derby 5-0 against a Saint-Etienne team decimated by a coronavirus outbreak. PSG and Lille are level on points, with Lyon two points behind in third. And perhaps even Monaco could get involved yet. They beat Marseille 3-1 and are six points off top spot in fourth, having scored 14 goals in winning their last four games. Sporting Lisbon claimed silverware by beating Braga 1-0 in the Portuguese League Cup final thanks to a goal from young Spanish defender Pedro Porro, who is on loan from Manchester City. It is the third time Sporting have won the trophy in four seasons but this time they will hope it is simply a precursor to the big one: not since 2002 have they won the league but this season, with talented young coach Ruben Amorim, they are unbeaten after 14 games and are four points ahead of Benfica and Porto."
10,24/01/2021,23:17,Suarez strikes again as Atletico march on with Valencia win,Luis Suarez scored a brilliant team goal as Atletico Madrid came from behind to beat Valencia 3-1 on Sunday and move seven points clear at the top of La Liga.,"After Real Madrid thrashed Alaves on Saturday, Barca had earlier followed suit with a scrappy victory over Elche. But Atletico were undeterred in the capital, as their considerable advantage was restored again, with a game in hand. ""We don't get carried away or think too far ahead, we think about getting better,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone. Suarez finished off a flowing move that had started almost on Atletico's goal-line before substitute Angel Correa capped another slick string of passes to end Valencia's resistance. The visitors had taken an early lead in stunning fashion, Uros Racic curling into the top corner from 35 yards but Joao Felix equalised and Atletico came back, in a way that has begun to feel expected. Felix was replaced by Correa after an hour by Simeone after assisting Suarez and scoring a goal for himself that should send a message to his coach, who has handed the 21-year-old a spell on the bench in recent weeks. ""It's not written that footballers have to play 90 minutes,"" said Simeone. ""Joao scored a goal, made an assist, he came off and on came Correa, who scored a goal and was close to another. The competition is healthy."" Simeone knows the pressure will mount as the La Liga trophy comes more into view, yet his team are showing an assuredness now that is offering little encouragement for Barcelona and Real Madrid. They had hope when Valencia took the lead on 11 minutes, Racic running onto Jose Gaya's pass and wrapping his left foot around the ball to send it bending into the top right-hand corner. He celebrated by seeking out his under-pressure coach Javi Gracia, but the advantage was short-lived as Felix stabbed in on the volley at the back post after holding off his marker Thierry Correia from a corner. With the more attacking Renan Lodi and Yannick Carrasco playing left and right wing-back in the second half, Atletico opened up Valencia twice with two superb, sweeping moves. The first started in their own right corner with Stefan Savic, the ball played across the back and into midfield where Mario Hermoso drove a searching pass forward to Felix on the left. He slipped in Suarez, who opened his body and finished from the angle. It was no fluke because the third goal was almost as good, some slick passing through midfield freeing Marcos Llorente down the right and he pulled back for Correa to sidefoot in. Barcelona won again without the suspended Lionel Messi as goals from Frenkie de Jong and Riqui Puig were enough to secure a scruffy 2-0 win over Elche. De Jong poked the ball over the line just before half-time at the Martinez Valero, which would have proved a suitably scrappy winner before Puig came off the bench to head in a second late on. Despite an uninspiring performance, Ronald Koeman will be relieved to see Barca make it two consecutive victories without Messi and since their loss in the Spanish Super Cup final last weekend to Athletic Bilbao, after an extra-time Copa del Rey victory over Cornella in midweek. Messi is still serving his punishment for being sent off in Seville but the Argentinian will be available again for Wednesday's cup tie at Rayo Vallecano. In his absence, De Jong stepped up, continuing his own resurgence in recent weeks with one of the simplest goals he will ever score and then an assist, following a more impressive run and cross for Puig. ""We are better this year. We've had to play all our games away and in La Liga we have won all of them so I think we have done well,"" said De Jong. ""For me, playing better is not just about goals and assists but I'm happy of course to score and assist today."""
11,22/01/2021,00:29,Suarez double fires Atletico seven points clear,Eibar goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic scored a penalty against Atletico Madrid on Thursday but a brace from Luis Suarez saw the La Liga leaders come from behind to win 2-1 at Ipurua.,"Dmitrovic drove an early spot-kick past fellow goalkeeper Jan Oblak, only for Suarez to inspire the comeback, his second also a penalty which he earned himself and then converted in the 89th minute. Another late victory for Atletico means they pull seven points clear of second-placed Real Madrid and 10 ahead of third-placed Barcelona, with another game in hand over both still to come. Dmitrovic said he was nominated as Eibar's penalty taker by coach Jose Luis Mendilibar. ""The idea that I would take it came from Mendilibar -- it was my turn today, but it's a shame because it hasn't been of any use,"" Dmitrovic said. ""He took it because the others have missed,"" said Mendilibar. ""He will keep taking them until he misses, that's the rule."" Suarez, meanwhile, moves level with Lionel Messi at the top of La Liga's scoring charts on 11 goals, the Uruguayan increasingly looking like a player that can lead his side to the title. He had Marcos Llorente's pressing to thank for his equaliser but the second was almost entirely down to him, the 33-year-old chasing down a long punt downfield before tumbling over following a clumsy swing of the leg by Anaitz Arbilla. Suarez chipped the penalty coolly down the middle. ""He takes responsibility,"" said Diego Simeone. ""He never leaves the game, he always plays with that intelligence that he has."" ""He is extraordinary,"" Simeone added. ""We're glad he is with us."" Atletico were the victims of an upset in the Copa del Rey a fortnight ago when they lost to third-tier side Cornella, whose spirited run came to an end at the hands of Barcelona on Thursday. Atletico's defeat by Cornella could have jolted their momentum. Instead they have responded with two wins in the league, against Sevilla and now Eibar, who stay 15th."
12,18/01/2021,17:11,Atletico to appeal again after FIFA confirm Trippier 10-week ban,Atletico Madrid will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) after Kieran Trippier's 10-week ban for breaching betting rules was upheld by FIFA on Monday.,"Atletico will request Trippier's suspension is again put on hold while the appeal is being heard, raising the possibility of the defender again returning to action. As it stands, Trippier is banned until February 28 and is due to miss eight La Liga fixtures, as well as Atletico's first leg at home to Chelsea in the Champions League last 16. FIFA said in a statement on Monday the suspension handed to Trippier by the English Football Association (FA) applies worldwide. But Atletico will now submit a fresh appeal to CAS, according to a club source, and request Trippier's ban is again put on hold again until it is completed. Trippier was able to play for Atletico against Sevilla last week after the English FA had failed to delay enforcing his ban until the result of Atletico's appeal to FIFA was known. FIFA said in a statement on Monday: ""The FIFA Appeal Committee has dismissed the appeal lodged by the club Atletico Madrid in a case concerning the player Kieran Trippier. ""As a consequence, the decision of the FIFA Disciplinary Committee passed on 23 December 2020 is confirmed, extending sanctions imposed on the player by the English FA to have worldwide effect."" An extended absence for Trippier would be a huge blow to Atletico Madrid, who sit four points clear at the top of La Liga, with two games in hand over their closest rivals Real Madrid. Trippier has become a key player for coach Diego Simeone, who said in December he felt the ban was ""unfair"". The England right-back was suspended for 10 weeks and fined £70,000 ($94,000) by the FA for breaching betting rules. In the written reasons for its decision, the FA said Trippier, 30, exchanged WhatsApp messages with friends about his impending move from Tottenham to Atletico Madrid in 2019. In one of the messages, Trippier told a friend to ""lump on"" (bet heavily) regarding his move to Spain."

Atletico have paid an initial fee of 1.5 million euros after Dembele passed his medical on Wednesday morning in Madrid. In a statement the La Liga club described him as a ""powerful striker"" with ""a knack for goal"". The 24-year-old's arrival follows Diego Costa's contract being terminated at the end of December. Dembele will compete with Luis Suarez, Joao Felix and Angel Correa for a place up front as he looks to boost Atletico's hopes of winning La Liga this season and earn a place in the France squad at the European Championships this summer. Atletico sit four points clear at the top of the table with two games in hand over second-placed Real Madrid. Dembele is expected to be available in early February after undgoing an operation on a broken arm, meaning he could feature in Atletico's first leg against Chelsea in the Champions League last 16 on February 23. After impressive spells at Fulham and Celtic, Dembele joined Lyon in 2018. But despite a decent first season that saw him score 16 goals in Ligue 1, he had fallen out favour this term and managed just one goal in 12 appearances. ""With Dembele's arrival, we add a young yet experienced footballer who's strong both physically and as a finisher,"" Atletico said in a statement. ""His height also makes him a threat in the air and his speed allows him to run past the opposition's defenders."""
15,13/01/2021,00:31,Atletico stretch Liga lead with Sevilla win,Atletico Madrid extended their lead at the top of La Liga to four points on Tuesday after a 2-0 win over Sevilla that strengthened their title credentials.,"Goals in each half from Angel Correa and substitute Saul Niguez on a freezing night following historic snowfall in the Spanish capital allowed Diego Simeone's side to increase the gap between themselves and city rivals Real Madrid. The match at the Wanda Metropolitano was one of three games in hand that Atletico had on Madrid and Barcelona, who sit a further three points back in third. Their home fixture with Athletic Bilbao at the weekend had to be postponed after Madrid experienced its heaviest snowfall in half a century. ""I'm very happy to help the team with this goal... the work pays off,"" said Saul after the win. Sevilla meanwhile stay sixth on 30 points, level with fifth-placed Real Sociedad. Zinedine Zidane's Madrid will have a tough task defending their La Liga crown on the evidence of Tuesday's display which bore all the hallmarks of a Simeone side. Kieran Trippier returned to the Atletico side after FIFA suspended the England international's 10-week ban for breaching betting rules. And the 30-year-old marked his comeback by helping Correa open the scoring in the 17th minute with a cut back that still left the Argentine with plenty of work to do as he controlled the ball in the area. Correa span quickly and got his shot off before Fernando could close him down, and his effort flashed past Yassine Bounou in the Sevilla goal. Trippier almost had another assist eight minutes later when his smart pass put Luis Suarez clean through, but Bounou did well to charge out and block the Uruguayan's close-range effort. Sevilla pushed a typically dogged Atletico but couldn't take advantage of the few chances that game their way and were punished with 14 minutes remaining by Saul's first goal of the season. The Spaniard was cool just outside the area as he collected Marco Llorente's low ball from the right before arrowing a left-footed shot into the far corner to guarantee Atletico's fifth straight league win since losing the Madrid derby last month. They will have the chance to further extend their lead at the top in a week's time when they travel to Eibar while Madrid and Barca -- who play in the in the Spanish Super Cup semi-finals this week -- are involved in the Copa Del Rey. Earlier Granada kept in touch with the European places with a 2-0 home win over lowly Osasuna. Diego Martinez side sit seventh, three points behind Sociedad and Sevilla who are in the Europa League places, thanks to goals from Colombian forward Luis Suarez and Sergio Herrera."
16,09/01/2021,11:40,Atletico Madrid game lost in Spanish snowstorm,"Spain's heaviest snowfall in decades has forced Atletico Madrid's game against Athletic Bilbao on Saturday to be postponed, LaLiga announced.","""With the exceptional situation due to the storm over a large part of the peninsular which has forced the Madrid-Barajas airport to close for the day, and the impossibility of providing a pitch in ideal conditions LaLiga, after discussions with the two clubs, has postponed the game"", the federation said. The fixture was scheduled for 1515 GMT at the Spanish league leaders' Wanda Metropolitano stadium. A new date for the encounter will be published in the coming days, LaLiga's statement added. Athletic were unable to land in Madrid because of the extreme weather brought by Storm Filomena on Friday and had to return to Bilbao early in the evening. The blizzards have caused chaos in Spain, with the capital's airport closed, hundreds of motorists stranded, and more snow forecast Saturday. Diego Simeone's Atletico lead the table by two points from city rivals Real with two games in hand."
17,08/01/2021,03:10,No room for complacency as Atletico's rivals find their rhythm,"Real Madrid have hit their stride and Barcelona are gaining momentum but Atletico Madrid have stayed strong at the top of La Liga, ahead of what could prove a crucial month in the title race.","A surprise loss to third division side Cornella in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday came in stark contrast to Atletico's form in the league, where only defeat to their capital city rivals last month blots an otherwise perfect run of results that stretches back to mid-October. Two narrow victories over Getafe and Alaves last week made it four league victories on the bounce since Atletico's setback at the Alfredo di Stefano stadium, where a hesitant, passive performance offered Madrid reassurance. Atletico had caved when it mattered most and many thought that spelled danger for their prospects longer-term. But while Zinedine Zidane's Madrid have used the derby victory to string together an unbeaten run of eight games, seven of them wins and five with clean sheets, Atletico have also responded. Luis Suarez scored consecutive winners against Getafe and Alaves, his tap-in at Mendizorroza on Sunday prompting the kind of celebrations to suggest his team genuinely believes they can go the distance. ""We have to keep going down this path,"" said coach Diego Simeone. ""The league is complex, there are lots of traps and you have to be constantly prepared, you can't let yourselves relax."" When Madrid last put together a run like this, it was to secure last season's title, as Barcelona wilted with the trophy in sight. Yet Atletico have marched on, even if the last-gasp nature of their win against Alaves, coupled with Wednesday's defeat by Cornella, means there can be no room for complacency this weekend. ""Everyone wants to win and in the second half of the season there is no longer the same calmness,"" Simeone said. ""It will be tougher, with teams fighting to save themselves, to qualify for Europe. You have to stay alert."" Atletico face Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and then Sevilla on Tuesday, two tough games that will again test their mettle, especially as Bilbao will be eager to secure a first win under new coach Marcelino Garcia Toral. Madrid, in contrast, have what appears to be a kind period in front of them. Their next six matches are all against teams currently in the bottom seven of the table, starting at Osasuna on Saturday. When they lost away at Shakhtar Donestsk at the start of December, Zidane was back in the firing line but the Frenchman has reverted to his most trusted players and his side have quickly recovered. Barcelona look rejuvenated too, their 3-2 win over Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday coming after a scintillating performance from Lionel Messi. He scored twice and could have had a hat-trick while the likes of Ousmane Dembele, Pedri, Antoine Griezmann and Frenkie de Jong all contributed to a slick attacking display. It was also enough to rekindle their hope, even if a seven-point deficit behind Atletico, who have two games in hand on both the Catalans and Madrid, still looks a large gap to close. ""There is always a chance,"" said Koeman. ""The season is very long. You can have ups and downs in a season and it may be that a team that is doing very well will suddenly find it difficult."" If Barca can win away at Granada on Saturday, belief will grow. Madrid travel to Osasuna later on Saturday night. Earlier in the day, Sevilla, in sixth, face Real Sociedad in fourth."
18,03/01/2021,13:16,FIFA suspend Trippier's 10-week ban,"FIFA has suspended Kieran Trippier's 10-week ban for breaching betting rules, freeing the England international to play for his club Atletico Madrid pending appeal.","The 30-year-old was barred from any football activity by the English Football Association last week, ruling him out for at least 13 matches for the Spanish league highflyers. FIFA's decision taken late Saturday allows Trippier to return to play for Diego Simeone's side until the appeal is heard at a crucial period of the season. They are lying second in La Liga, just one point behind Real Madrid but have games in hand and can regain the summit latter Sunday. Last week the FA banned him until February 28 with a £70,000 fine (94,000) after being found guilty of chargss surrounding his move from Tottenham to Atletico. Oone of England's standout performers in their run to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals he denied the seven charges. The alleged offences took place in July 2019 around the time he completed his transfer from Tottenham to Atletico for a fee in the region of £20million. FIFA's temporary lifting of the suspension pending the appeal was initiated by Atletico who felt it unfair the player would miss a large chunk of Atletico's matches but none for England. Trippier is now eligible to turn out for Atletico in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 clash with Chelsea on February 23. As Atletico prepared their next move - ""we are considering all options"" a spokesman told AFP - Trippier returned to training but is not for Sunday's trip to Alaves."
19,30/12/2020,21:32,Suarez ensures Atletico top La Liga,Luis Suarez made sure that Atletico Madrid will end 2020 top of La Liga after scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win over Getafe on Wednesday.,"Suarez struck in the 20th minute with a superb header from Yannick Carrasco's cross to take Diego Simeone's side three points ahead of Real Madrid, who are in action at lowly Elche later on Wednesday. Real Sociedad, Sevilla and Villarreal are all a further six points back, with Barcelona 10 points behind Atletico in sixth after their 1-1 draw with Eibar on Tuesday. Even if Madrid win in the late kick-off they will stay behind Atletico thanks to their significantly inferior goal difference, which currently separates teams locked on the same points. Atletico will have also played two fewer matches than their local rivals come the end of the day's fixtures after a win emblematic of Simeone's reign on his 500th match as coach of the club. Thomas Lemar almost opened the scoring in the 15th minute when he crashed a shot off the near post from a tight angle. Suarez gave the hosts the lead with a beautifully placed header that was all the more impressive for the way Carrasco's cross was flashed into a crowded area from midfield. The Uruguayan's eighth goal of the season was a good as it got for Atletico, who despite a fielding a full-strength line-up did not impress in a match of little incident at the Wanda Metropolitano. They failed to take the game by the scruff of the neck against a Getafe team that have scored just 12 times in 15 matches and are 14th, two points above the relegation zone. However Atletico's third win in a row ensures they remain top of the pile after a fraught last few days in which Diego Costa was allowed to leave and Kieran Trippier was banned until the end of February for betting breaches. Earlier Granada moved to within two points of the Champions League places after beating Valencia 2-1 in a fiesty match where three players were sent off in six second-half minutes. Jorge Molina's powerful header two minutes from time keeps Granada in seventh place on 24 points, two behind fourth-placed Sevilla. Granada, who levelled through Kenedy on the stroke of half-time after Kevin Gameiro had opened for Valencia in the 36th minute, are also one point away from Barcelona. Valencia's seventh league defeat of the season leaves them level on 15 points with Real Valladolid, who are third-from-bottom in the relegation zone and earned a point at Cadiz on Tuesday. Javi Gracia's side haven't won a La Liga match in their last seven attempts and had their task made harder when Jason and Goncalo Guedes were sent off within three minutes of each other midway through the second half. Granada's Domingos Duarte was then shown a straight red card three minutes later after he cynically hacked down Manu Vallejo as he attempted to burst through on goal with the scores still level. Molina punished the beleaguered away side by thumping home Alberto Soro's cross."

During his time at Atletico, Costa was part of a squad that won one La Liga title in the 2013-14 season, one Copa del Rey (2013), one Europa League (2018) and two UEFA Super Cups (2010 and 2018). ""The club thanks Diego Costa for his dedication during these years and wishes him well in the next stage of his professional career,"" the club said."

Karim Benzema has been the driving force behind Real's excellent December run, claiming key goals in wins over Athletic Bilbao, Eibar and Granada after securing the club a spot in the Champions League knockout phase. Eden Hazard is also in line to feature after recovering from his latest injury setback. The Belgian was an unused substitute in last week's victory over Granada and has made just three league starts this campaign. Real coach Zinedine Zidane hopes the short festive break afforded to his players over Christmas will not interrupt the momentum built over a domestic five-game winning streak. ""We're going to keep working hard. We have an awful lot of games, we should be pleased with what we're doing,"" said Zidane. ""We're going to lose games again, but we're going to try to win as many as possible. From time to time it's inevitable."" Atletico have responded well to the 2-0 defeat by Real earlier this month that snapped their 26-match unbeaten league run. However, the loss of Kieran Trippier is a substantial blow to a defence that has conceded just five goals in 13 matches, easily the fewest in the division. The England defender, an ever-present for Atletico in La Liga and Europe this term, was recently hit with a 10-week ban for breaching betting rules and will be unavailable until March. The club is said to be considering an appeal. Diego Costa has reportedly asked to terminate his contract for family reasons, having just returned from a blood clot that sidelined the Brazil-born Spain international for a month. Joao Felix is expected to return after missing the 2-0 win at Real Sociedad, although the Portuguese star hasn't scored in the league since November 7. Barcelona will bid to end a turbulent 2020 on a winning note at home to Eibar, but Ronald Koeman's side will be without Lionel Messi after the Argentine was granted an extended break as he recovers from an ankle knock. The six-time Ballon d'Or winner admitted his aborted departure in the summer had affected him at the start of the season, but stressed he felt ""excited"" to play under Koeman. ""Barca is my life, I'm in love with the club. And the city, my children were born here,"" Messi said in an interview with Spanish TV channel La Sexta broadcast on Sunday. ""I feel good right now, ready to fight for everything."" The Celta Vigo forward, the leading Spanish scorer in La Liga three of the past four years, has inspired a turnaround at Balaidos after the team won just one of their first 10 matches. The 33-year-old Aspas, who in November became the club's all-time leading scorer in the top flight, has netted eight times in 15 appearances this term and led Celta back into the top half following four wins in five games before Christmas. Much like with Real and Benzema, who is level at the top of the scoring charts with Aspas, Celta's success in 2021 could heavily rely on the former Liverpool attacker. 500 - Diego Simeone will take charge of his 500th match as Atletico boss against Getafe on Wednesday. He has won 300 games since his appointment in December 2011. 35 - Lionel Messi has been involved in more La Liga goals than any other player this year. The Argentine has scored 19 times and provided 16 assists. 9 - the number of games without a win for Real Sociedad across all competitions. Two weeks ago the Basques held top spot, but three successive defeats have dropped Imanol Alguacil's side six points off the pace."

Champions Real Madrid, who sit second, can move level again with their city rivals with a home win over Granada on Wednesday. Barcelona meanwhile are 11 points behind Atletico in sixth place ahead of their clash with Real Valladolid later on Tuesday. After tomorrow's games, Real and Barcelona will have played two more matches than Atletico. Sociedad have played three games more than the leaders. The win was Simeone's 300th league win as Atletico coach. ""It's means a lot, really a lot,"" the Argentine said. ""I came here with the idea of taking Atletico to the summit of the game ... I can't thank the club enough for what they have given me."" Sociedad were the better side in the first half but couldn't carve a goalscoring opportunity in an opening period without a shot on target. Atletico went ahead just three minutes after the break when Hermoso found himself unmarked in the area and perfectly met Yannick Carrasco's free-kick to send a header flying into the bottom corner. The hosts responded by pressing their opponents back but couldn't find a way through a typically well-organised Simeone team. Atletico doubled their lead with 16 minutes remaining, Llorente lashing home when the ball fell to him on the edge of the area. Earlier Sevilla moved up to fifth after Suso fired them to a 1-0 win at struggling Valencia. Suso gave the Andalusians the points with a thumping strike in the 81st minute after charging through to collect a Joan Jordan through ball. The winning strike was the 27-year-old Spain international's first goal of the season. Sevilla are nine points behind Atletico but two points in front of Barca. Valencia are 13th and just a point above the relegation zone after their sixth consecutive league match without a win."

Suarez was far more clinical in the 41st minute as the Uruguay forward got the slightest of touches to steer Kieran Trippier's cross past Badia to take the lead. The former Barcelona and Liverpool attacker then stretched to poke a cross into the net in the 58th minute. Lucas Boye's powerful header gave Elche hope in the second half but substitute Diego Costa fired in a penalty with ten minutes remaining to wrap up the three points for Atletico. Atletico have 29 points, three more than Real Sociedad who visit Levante later Saturday, while Barcelona host Valencia. Champions Real Madrid play Eibar away on Sunday."
26,12/12/2020,22:57,Real Madrid take derby honours as Atletico lose marathon unbeaten record,Real Madrid reignited their La Liga title push on Saturday beating leaders Atletico 2-0 as their city rivals suffered a first league defeat of the season.,"Real, who salvaged their Champions League campaign in midweek by making the last 16, moved to third in the table, three points behind Atletico. It was a disappointing night for Diego Simeone's side who had boasted a 26-match unbeaten run in the league, stretching back to February. That was a run which consisted of 17 wins and nine draws. Real had been the last team to beat Atletico in the league. ""We confirmed the improvement we showed in many areas against Sevilla and Borussia, and gave another good display,"" said Real coach Zinedine Zidane, reflecting on his side's wins in the past week which have helped turn around the season. ""There are criticisms that hurt, but they also make you stronger."" ""We competed very well from minute one until the end, we must be satisfied with work well done."" His team were in front after 15 minutes when Casemiro headed home a corner from Toni Kroos. That was reward for Real's early pressure which had seen Karim Benzema denied by a fine save from Jan Oblak moments earlier. Atletico, who also made the Champions League knockout round in midweek, struggled to make any impression and star striker Luis Suarez was an anonymous figure up front. Real went 2-0 up after 63 minutes with Kroos again the provider. His pass eventually fell for Dani Carvajal who unleashed a 30-metre drive which hit the post but was diverted into the net by the helpless Oblak. The 'keeper was credited with an own-goal for his troubles. It was only the fourth goal conceded by the usually water-tight Atletico defence in 11 league games this season. It was a night of frustration with Simeone's men managing just one shot on target. ""We didn't have the courage to attack, now we have to work and improve."" ""They were better. They were forceful, precise, and when they had their chance, they put them away,"" said the Argentine. ""We can have a bad game, we can. That hurts, yes it hurts."" Egos too were hurting. Portuguese star Joao Felix showed his displeasure at being replaced by Saul on the hour. Suarez allowed himself an ironic smile when he too was benched in favour of Geoffrey Kondogbia in the 73rd minute. ""Joao Felix, if he plays, he wants to contribute more, he wants to finish the 90 minutes,"" said Simeone. ""But I can't explain his behaviour."" In stark contrast, Zidane could be especially pleased for Casemiro who had returned from Covid-19 quarantine while Carvajal had recovered from a right leg injury. It was a night to remember also for captain Sergio Ramos who was playing in a Madrid derby for the 43rd time, Atletico, meanwhile, could lose top spot on Sunday when second-placed Real Sociedad welcome Eibar. Barcelona are also in action on Sunday against Levante and will be under intense scrutiny. Barca are in such disarray that they need a victory merely to steady the ship after a morale-sapping 3-0 defeat to Juventus in the Champions League. The Catalans still qualified for the last 16, but as group runners-up Lionel Messi and his teammates risk drawing one of Europe's big names. After the tumultuous summer which almost saw Messi depart, Barca and new coach Ronald Koeman never seem to have recovered. They sit an unaccustomed ninth in the table with just 14 points from 10 games. They are 12 points behind leaders Atletico. Goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen said a win against modest Levante, who have just three points fewer than the Catalans, was essential. ""In La Liga we are not where we want to be but we can claw back some points and that is the aim in the next few weeks. ""We're playing at home and we can't afford to drop a single point now."""

With Sergio Ramos back to lead the defence and Benzema clinical in front of goal, Real eventually went through as group winners with a comfortable 2-0 victory meaning they will avoid many of the big guns in the last 16 draw. Coach Zinedine Zidane, whose job has been the subject of speculation after a turbulent start to the season, seems safe for now. Atletico, who lead La Liga by a single point from the season's surprise package, Real Sociedad, also booked their ticket to the Champions League knockout stage with a composed 2-0 win against RB Salzburg in Austria. Diego Simeone's side go into the last-16 draw as Group A runners-up behind reigning champions Bayern Munich. While the city derby -- albeit without the fervent crowd such a game normally attracts to the Bernabeu -- will dominate headlines on Saturday, Barcelona's match against Levante on Sunday will also come under intense scrutiny. Barca are in such disarray that they need a victory merely to steady the ship after a morale-sapping 3-0 defeat to Juventus in the Champions League. The Catalans still qualified for the last 16, but as group runners-up Lionel Messi and his teammates risk drawing one of Europe's big names.

Sociedad meanwhile take on Eibar on Sunday. The Belgian international returned from injury to score Atletico's second goal against Salzburg with a deft volley from Angel Correa's cross four minutes from time. Simeone said after the Salzburg victory that he was becoming a key weapon for Atletico: ""In the second half he was fantastic, his rhythm, his work-rate, he needs to carry on like that...when he's playing at that level he is an important player and gives the team something different."" 10 - Number of games Atletico have gone unbeaten since the start of the season 10 - Number of La Liga titles Atletico have won, compared to 34 for Real Madrid and 26 for Barcelona Fixtures (all times GMT)"

Mario Hermoso's goal just before half-time put Diego Simeone's side ahead in Austria before Carrasco added a late second for the Spanish league leaders. Atletico nearly fell behind inside two minutes against the Austrian champions as Mergim Berisha came a whisker away from giving Salzburg the lead, the Germany Under-21 international's low curler striking the post. While their defence has been watertight in La Liga, conceding just twice in 10 games, Atletico have proved far more vulnerable on the continent, and Salzburg repeatedly threatened in the opening stages. Sekou Koita fluffed an attempt running away from goal after he was played in by Patson Daka, who then failed to make more of a promising opportunity on the counter-attack. That came shortly after Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak plunged low to his left to turn behind Dominik Szoboszlai's guided effort heading for the bottom corner. Having weathered early pressure Atletico landed the crucial breakthrough six minutes before the interval when Carrasco's free-kick was glanced home by Hermoso, the ball coming off both head and shoulder. Rasmus Kristensen flashed a snapshot wide as Salzburg resumed the second half on the attack, and they should have been level when Szoboszlai linked up with Berisha only to gasp in horror as he dragged agonisingly wide with just Oblak to beat. Enock Mwepu, one of two Zambians in the Salzburg side, clipped the outside of the post with a thumping 20-yard drive, but Carrasco's cushioned volley from an Angel Correa cross four minutes from time sealed victory for Atletico."

Diego Simeone's Atletico had won just once in four matches in Europe this term despite their strong start in La Liga, but knew victory would secure passage to the knockout phase after Lokomotiv Moscow's 3-1 home loss to Salzburg. Instead, the 2014 and 2016 finalists must avoid defeat away to the Austrian champions next week to advance. ""We played very well individually and collectively, but are frustrated by not getting the victory to put us in the last 16,"" Felix told Movistar Plus. ""We were winning until the 85th minute and we had more chances than they did but didn't take them. They only had a few but it was enough for the draw."" For Bayern, whose focus was primarily on Saturday's Bundesliga showdown with RB Leipzig, it marked just the fourth time in 43 matches this year they failed to win. ""I'm very happy with the result. We were more competitive in the second half to get the draw. With Mueller, we gained a bit more dynamism up front. On the whole, it was a satisfactory match,"" said Bayern coach Hansi Flick. Luis Suarez was again unavailable at the Wanda Metropolitano having tested positive for Covid-19 while Diego Costa is sidelined long-term after suffering a blood clot in his right leg. Alexander Nubel replaced the rested Manuel Neuer in goal as Flick left several regulars, including Robert Lewandowski, behind in Germany with top spot in Group A already assured. Bright Arrey-Mbi, a former Chelsea academy player, made his senior debut in Bayern's central defence while fellow 17-year-old Jamal Musiala was handed a start in attack behind Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. Thrashed 4-0 in Munich in October, Atletico took the lead here on 26 minutes as Portugal international Felix swept in a low cross from Marcos Llorente. German-born England Under-21 international Musiala shaved the side-netting after running menacingly at the Atletico defence, with Llorente blazing over at the other end following a burst from Felix. With Bayern staring at a first Champions League defeat since March 2019, Flick introduced Mueller and Serge Gnabry on the hour in a bid to keep their remarkable European sequence intact. Mueller equalised for the visitors after he was fouled by Felipe, squeezing the resulting penalty just beyond the reach of Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak. Atletico defender Mario Hermoso flashed a header over late on as the Spaniards missed a chance to wrap up second place in the group with a round to spare."
30,30/11/2020,22:38,Simeone sweats on Suarez ahead of Bayern test,Diego Simeone said Monday he is awaiting news on Luis Suarez's recovery from Covid-19 as Atletico Madrid prepare for the Champions League visit of already-qualified Bayern Munich.,"The European champions thrashed Atletico 4-0 in Munich in October, but travel to Madrid for Tuesday's game without a host of stars including Robert Lewandowski. Simeone was coy over whether Uruguay forward Suarez would be back from his virus-enforced layoff for Tuesday's matchday five encounter, saying that he was waiting for an update on his condition. ""This virus is strange, maybe tomorrow he could be negative and be in good condition, he is training, we will have to wait to see what happens,"" Simeone said. ""I spoke with him yesterday. He wants to be with the team, but the most important thing is that he is well and that he returns to normal ... if he does not play tomorrow he will play on Saturday (against Real Valladolid)."" Atletico's campaign in Europe's top club competition is in the balance, with the La Liga side second but a full seven points behind Bayern and Lokomotiv Moscow lurking two points back in third. Lokomotiv host bottom side Salzburg in an early kick-off and if they win will move second before Atletico kick off in Madrid. European champions Bayern meanwhile will be without Lewandowski, club captain Manuel Neuer, and midfielders Leon Goretzka and Corentin Tolisso, coach Hansi Flick said. Flick said Tolisso was not fully fit but might be back to face RB Leipzig at the weekend, while Alexander Nubel would start in goal in place of Neuer. He added that he would make decisions on the starting line-up ahead of the game on Tuesday. ""I'll wait until tomorrow and then go through who's in a good mood. Then we'll see who's playing."" Bayern have not lost in the Champions League since March 2019 and have won their last 15 games in the competition. ""At the moment we are not winning any beauty prizes, but the team is able to fight for 90 minutes. And that without much preparation,"" said Flick. ""We played through last season. We are satisfied with what we have achieved and we are doing well, but there are still big games to play in the next two-and-a-half weeks."" Javi Martinez joined Flick at the press conference and confirmed he was still thinking of leaving Bayern. ""In the summer, I was thinking: 'If an offer comes that is good for me and the club, I will move',"" the 32-year-old Spaniard said. ""Playing another year for Bayern is very good. But I would like to try something new before I end my career."""
31,30/11/2020,14:53,Bayern rest Lewandowski and Neuer for trip to Atletico,"Bayern Munich, assured of a place in the knockout rounds of the Champions League, left several regulars, including Robert Lewandowski and Manuel Neuer, behind on Monday when they travelled to Madrid to face Atletico.","In addition to star striker Lewandowski and club captain and goalkeeper Neuer, midfielders Leon Goretzka and Corentin Tolisso will remain in Munich. ""Lewandowski, Neuer, Goretzka, Tolisso stay here,"" coach Hansi Flick told a press conference. ""They will be rested."" Flick said Tolisso was not fully fit but might be back to face RB Leipzig at the weekend. ""Everyone else is in the squad,"" Flick said adding that he would make decisions on the starting line-up ahead of the game on Tuesday. ""I'll wait until tomorrow and then go through who's in a good mood. Then we'll see who's playing."" Flick said defender Niklas Suele, who returned from coronavirus quarantine with 32 minutes off the bench against Stuttgart on Saturday, might start. ""The odds aren't bad,"" said the coach. With two rounds to play, Bayern are sure to finish top of Group A, but Atletico are in a three-way battle for second. Flick said he was not worried about fielding a less-experienced team in Madrid. ""Playing against Atletico, especially as a young player, is a great experience. You should enjoy it,"" he said. Bayern have not lost in the Champions League since March 2019 and have won their last 15 games in the competition. ""It'll work,"" said Flick. ""At the moment we are not winning any beauty prizes, but the team is able to fight for 90 minutes. And that without much preparation. ""We played through last season. We are satisfied with what we have achieved and we are doing well, but there are still big games to play in the next two and a half weeks."" He said Alexander Nubel would start in goal while Neuer rested. ""I will of course watch the game,"" Neuer told the club website. ""It's important for me to be able to switch off, especially with the mammoth programme that we've faced over recent weeks and months. It's difficult to take breaks. I'll recover, maybe I'll just relax a bit to be my old self this weekend against RB Leipzig."" Javi Martinez joined Flick at the press conference and confirmed he was still thinking of leaving Bayern. ""In the summer, I was thinking: 'If an offer comes that is good for me and the club, I will move',"" the 32-year-old Spaniard said. ""Playing another year for Bayern is very good. But I would like to try something new before I end my career."""
32,28/11/2020,19:42,Atletico beat Valencia to move level with leaders Sociedad,Atletico Madrid moved level with La Liga leaders Real Sociedad on Saturday after edging a tight contest at Valencia 1-0 that extends their domestic winning streak to six matches.,"Diego Simeone's side stay second but are equal on 23 points with Sociedad with a game in hand on the leaders thanks to Toni Lato's own goal 11 minutes from time. Stingy Atletico have conceded just twice in their nine league matches so far this season and have only scored two less than La Liga top scorers Sociedad, who host third-placed Villarreal on Sunday. ""We have made huge progress since April, since that wonderful match at Liverpool,"" said Simeone, referring to the Champions League last 16 tie his team won 4-2 on aggregate. ""The return to La Liga (after the first lockdown) was very good and the team was already starting to show encouraging signs. This is the result of the progression of all of the players."" Simeone offered a round of applause to his former teammate and friend Diego Maradona following the iconic Argentine's death on Wednesday, while both teams held a minute's silence before kick-off. Atleti's win at the Mestalla puts them four ahead of Villarreal and six in front of reigning champions Real Madrid, who face Alaves in Saturday's late match. It came without a host of absences, including Luis Suarez following the striker's positive Covid-19 test earlier this month, and Simeone said he would have an update on the Uruguayan's condition on Sunday. ""I spoke with him (Suarez) on the phone, he really wants to come back. The team needs him, and I hope he will come back in the best possible way,"" said Simeone. Fellow traditional title rivals Barcelona are 12 points back in 13th place, although they host Osasuna in Sunday's early match and will still have two games in hand on Sociedad come the end of the weekend. Atletico will face European champions Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Tuesday hoping to reach the knockout stages with a match to spare. In the early match, newly-promoted Elche and Cadiz shared the spoils in a 1-1 draw which continues their surprise starts to the season."
33,25/11/2020,23:46,Atletico held by Lokomotiv to leave qualification in doubt,Atletico Madrid's qualification for the Champions League last 16 remains far from secure after they were held to a goalless draw at home to Lokomotiv Moscow on Wednesday.,"Atletico remain second in Group A, two points ahead of Lokomotiv but with a game against Bayern Munich at the Wanda Metropolitano still to come next week. Bayern secured top spot with a 3-1 victory over Salzburg. Lokomotiv have to visit the reigning European champions in the final game while Atletico finish away at Salzburg, meaning it would still be a surprise if Diego Simeone's side fail to reach the knock-out stages. But this was a chance missed to take command of second place as Atletico created several chances against their Russian opponents but lacked a finishing touch. ""We lacked a bit of intensity, maybe a bit of freshness,"" said Simeone. ""The Champions League is getting a bit complicated for us. Hopefully we can decide the group in the next game and get through."" ""It is a shame not to have got the win,"" added Saul Niguez. ""The three points were important and we played well but we weren't ruthless enough. It's still in our hands."" Koke saw a goal ruled out for offside in the second half while the in-form Joao Felix and Marcos Llorente both went close. Luis Suarez, who was absent after testing positive for coronavirus, and Diego Costa, who has suffered a blood clot in his leg, might have helped break down a determined Lokomotiv defence. Llorente was everywhere in the opening half an hour. He pulled back for Felix, who skewed his finish and then for Angel Correa, who connected but was blocked. Llorente then shot twice himself, the first palmed away and the second saved too after some nice work down the right from Kieran Trippier. Lokomotiv offered little going forward, their best chance falling to Ze Luis, who slipped through, then slipped over at the crucial moment. But Atletico's momentum stalled in the second half, with Simeone bringing on Thomas Lemar and switching to three at the back, before a Koke rebound was ruled out for offside on review. Felix went down over Vladislav Ignatyev's foot but the referee was right to decide there was not enough contact to warrant a penalty. Stanislav Magkeev had a chance to nick it for Lokomotiv on the counter-attack but dragged wide. Jose Gimenez headed just past the post. Neither side could find a way through."
34,25/11/2020,17:25,Atletico's Costa to miss a month with blood clot,"Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa has suffered a blood clot in his right leg, the club confirmed on Wednesday.","Costa will miss Atletico's Champions League game at home to Lokomotiv Moscow on Wednesday and is expected to be out for at least a month. That would mean the 32-year-old also sitting out La Liga games against Valencia and Real Madrid in the next few weeks, as well as the last two Champions League group fixtures against Bayern Munich and RB Salzburg. Atletico sit second in Group A after taking four points from their opening three games. ""Diego Costa underwent tests this morning that confirmed he has suffered a spontaneous deep vein thrombosis in the right leg. It is not related to trauma or previous injury,"" a statement from Atletico read. Costa has just recovered from a separate muscle injury that has caused him to miss Atletico's last four matches. Diego Simeone is already short of forwards, with Luis Suarez sidelined due to a positive test for coronavirus."
35,24/11/2020,02:45,Atletico reaping the rewards as Felix finds his feet,"""It's clear that he's growing,"" said Diego Simeone, after Joao Felix scored his third and fourth goals in five days last month to put Atletico Madrid within touching distance of the top of the Liga table.","Felix's brace against Osasuna would have been a hat-trick had his second penalty of the game not struck the post, but it said something that a 20-year-old, in only third professional season, was taking them. When Felix made his debut for Atletico Madrid in August last year, he won a penalty after a sensational run that humiliated three Getafe defenders, with a nutmeg, a roll of the studs and then a dash bringing 68,000 fans to their feet. Felix carried the ball under his arm towards the spot but Kieran Trippier was the penalty taker, and he missed. A year later, Felix is not just in charge of penalties but the driving force of a rejuvenated Atletico team and perhaps even the sparkle that could carry them to the Spanish title. If they win their two games in hand, Atletico will be three points clear at the top of the table. Things are also going well in Europe for Atletico. They visit Lokomotiv Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday, sitting second in Group A, behind Bayern Munich. Felix scored his first Champions League goal in this fixture last season. ""Joao has always delivered important moments,"" Simeone said earlier this month. ""What is making everyone talk now is the consistency he is showing in his game, in his work."" Felix has been compared to Rui Costa, Johan Cruyff, Kaka and Cristiano Ronaldo. In Portugal, he was dubbed the 'Menino de Ouro' - the Golden Boy - and it was not long before many, including Liverpool's Diogo Jota, were labelling him Ronaldo's natural successor. Atletico paid 126 million euros to sign Felix from Benfica and when he arrived in Madrid, he was unveiled in the Prado Museum, the message obvious: one of the world's most talented artists, ready to be viewed by the world. Yet his first year was an anti-climax. The spell-binding moments, like that one against Getafe, grew increasingly irregular, overshadowed by injuries, forgettable performances and the sense of a player who didn't fit. Reports in Spain and Portugal claimed Felix was hamstrung by Atletico's system and fatigued by Simeone's demands. Marca put Felix on a list of the most disappointing signings of the season. Atletico were in transition too, a new defence meant the team's platform had to rebuild while up front they had lost Antoine Griezmann, their top scorer and talisman, to Barcelona. But just as Atletico are one year further along in their renovation, Felix is one year more mature, the growth of his own confidence and the team's stability proving mutually beneficial. He has found a role too, no longer deployed off the right but more central although he is able to drop in off the left to find the pockets of space in which he thrives. Luis Suarez is a potent partner able to occupy markers and, off the pitch, perhaps an example to follow. Koke has offered more creativity from central midfield than out wide. ""Felix has ended up finding both his best position on the pitch and the confidence to feel like the leader,"" wrote Diario AS last week. ""Even the best player in the world has to find a place in the team,"" said Simeone. ""Freedom isn't playing anywhere, it's playing where you can be most important for the team."" Felix has found his place."
36,22/11/2020,14:17,Blow for Barca as Pique knee injury confirmed,"Barcelona's Gerard Pique has sustained a serious knee injury, the club confirmed on Sunday, with the defender expected to be out for at least two months.","Pique cried as he hobbled off the pitch during Barca's 1-0 defeat by Atletico Madrid in La Liga on Saturday following a colission with Angel Correa. ""Tests have shown that he has a grade 3 sprain in the internal lateral ligament and partial injury to the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee,"" said Barcelona in a statement. The club also confirmed that Sergi Roberto, who can play right back or central midfield, will be out for two months after tearing a muscle in his thigh. There was no official estimate for Pique's return but reports in the Spanish press have suggested he could be out for anything between two and six months. Pique's absence leaves Barca with Clement Lenglet as their one fit central defender, given Samuel Umtiti and Ronald Araujo are also out injured. Frenkie de Jong has occasionally dropped into defence in recent weeks but the situation is far from ideal for Ronald Koeman, whose side slipped to their third league loss of the season against Atletico. Barca sit 10th in La Liga but have fared better in the Champions League, sitting top of Group G with nine points out of nine ahead of Tuesday's game away at Dynamo Kiev."
37,03/11/2020,14:30,Atletico sign Kondogbia from Valencia,"Atletico Madrid have signed midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia from Valencia, the two clubs announced on Tuesday.","Kondogbia, who has played internationally for France and the Central African Republic, has signed a contract until 2024, Atletico said in a statement. La Liga rules allowed Atletico to buy outside the transfer window after Arsenal activated Thomas Partey's 50 million euro ($58 million) release clause on the last day of the summer transfer window. Kondogbia will cost Atletico around 10 million euros, according to reports in the Spanish press, with a further 2 million euros due in variables. Valencia will also take 10 per cent of any future sale. ""A talented and strong midfielder joins Atletico Madrid,"" the club said. ""His physical presence, defensive solidity and striking ability from distance make him an all-round player in central midfield."" Thomas had been one of Atletico's most important players but the club have attempted to fill the void with the signing of Kondogbia, as well as Arsenal's Lucas Torreira who joined on loan. Valencia, though, will not be able to replace Kondogbia and letting the 27-year-old go continues the club's drastic selling policy, which has been hugely unpopular with the fans. In a statement issued in August, Valencia owner Peter Lim said: ""We need to reduce the cost of our team. First, for the obvious reason that we are not in the Champions League. We only have La Liga in which to compete, and we will need fewer players."" ""A bankrupt club is not a better club,"" he added. Valencia's new coach Javi Gracia has already complained publicly about the club failing to replace players sold and the team have endured a poor start to the season in La Liga, sitting 13th, three points above the relegation places. A brief statement, titled 'So Long, Geoffrey Kondogbia' on social media, read: ""Valencia CF have formalised an agreement with Atletico Madrid for the permanent transfer of Geoffrey Kondogbia."""
38,23/10/2020,03:58,"Clasico, Dortmund v Schalke - what to look out for in Europe this weekend","Two of the biggest rivalries in world football will dominate the weekend's action in Europe, with the first Clasico of the season being followed by the Ruhr derby between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke on Saturday.","AFP Sport previews the standout action on the continent this weekend: Barcelona v Real Madrid, Saturday 1400 GMT Once the undisputed greatest fixture in world football, the Clasico has lost much of its lustre. Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Andres Iniesta were among the superstars to move on from Real Madrid and Barcelona in recent years, and this year Gareth Bale and Luis Suarez departed too. Lionel Messi would have left as well, had Barcelona let him. Usually there would be 99,000 fans packed into the Camp Nou. This time, because of the coronavirus pandemic, there will be none. The huge global audience will remain, but it's a long time since these teams have been at such a collective low ebb. Barca are struggling to get back on their feet under new coach Ronald Koeman and lost 1-0 at Getafe last weekend. Real won La Liga last season but the last week gives a more accurate picture of where they stand: Zinedine Zidane's team lost 1-0 at home to Cadiz and then went down 3-2 to Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League. Madrid have lost just once in their last seven visits to the Camp Nou though. Borussia Dortmund v Schalke, Saturday 1630 GMT Another great fixture usually played before a huge crowd, only 300 fans will be allowed in to see Dortmund host Schalke, rather than the usual 80,000. These sides are fierce rivals and tensions are running extra high after Dortmund prodigy Youssoufa Moukoko, 15, received alleged death threats and racist abuse from Schalke fans after scoring a hat-trick in last Sunday's 3-2 win in an Under-19 derby. Dortmund, with Erling Braut Haaland leading the line, will be favourites to get the better of a struggling Schalke who lost 4-0 on their last visit in May. Schalke sacked coach David Wagner after their poor start this season followed a long winless run at the end of the last campaign. Manuel Baum has replaced him and got his first point last weekend against Union Berlin. Dortmund's 1-0 victory at Hoffenheim last weekend made it three wins out of four in the Bundesliga this season, but Lucien Favre's side lost 3-1 at Lazio in the Champions League in midweek. Atletico Madrid v Real Betis, Saturday 1900 GMT Atletico are hoping to take advantage of the struggles of Real Madrid and Barcelona to win a first La Liga title since 2014. The signing of Luis Suarez from Barcelona underlined their ambition, but they head into Saturday's home meeting with Betis on the rebound from their joint-worst defeat in Diego Simeone's nine years as coach in Wednesday's 4-0 loss at Bayern Munich. Manuel Pellegrini's Betis have been inconsistent so far but, with the likes of Nabil Fekir, Sergio Canales and the evergreen Joaquin, should not be underestimated. Lyon v Monaco, Sunday 2000 GMT Lyon and Monaco have been Champions League semi-finalists in recent seasons but are not in Europe at all in this campaign, so each is desperate to get back to the promised land. Lyon have started poorly in Ligue 1 with just two wins in seven but have kept hold of star men Memphis Depay and Houssem Aouar. Monaco have been inconsistent too under new coach Niko Kovac but in Wissam Ben Yedder they have one of Europe's most lethal marksmen. AC Milan v Roma, Monday 1945 GMT Milan put their perfect start to the Serie A campaign on the line when they welcome Roma to San Siro on Monday. The Rossoneri have won four out of four so far in the league with Zlatan Ibrahimovic in fine form, but Roma have some useful veterans of their own in attack in Edin Dzeko and Pedro and are also slowly building form."
39,22/10/2020,13:01,Flick challenges Coman to bring Champions League form to Bundesliga,Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick has challenged Kingsley Coman to replicate his Champions League form in the Bundesliga after the France winger netted twice and assisted another goal in Wednesday's 4-0 rout of Atletico Madrid.,"Coman, 24, scored either side of efforts from Leon Goretzka and Corentin Tolisso as holders Bayern opened the defence of their title by inflicting the joint-heaviest defeat of Diego Simeone's nine-year spell as Atletico coach. ""We said to him: 'This is the benchmark', and that is how he will be measured in the next games,"" Flick said of Coman in the post-match press conference. Bayern have won their last 12 Champions League matches, extending the tournament record. Coman picked up where he left off in last season's final 59 days previously in Lisbon, where he headed the winning goal against Paris Saint-Germain. He has only managed 19 goals in 110 Bundesliga matches spread out over six seasons, but has needed just 29 games to conjure up 10 goals and 11 assists in Europe. ""It is important that he not only creates but also scores goals,"" Flick said. ""This is also part of playing in the Bundesliga -- you have to expect the same from a player of his quality in the other competitions. ""That's what we will be looking at closely in the next few weeks."" Bayern face a run of four away games after Saturday's home Bundesliga match against Eintracht Frankfurt. The Bavarians have bounced back from a shock 4-1 defeat at Hoffenheim earlier this month with five straight victories in all competitions. Flick was impressed by his team's aggressiveness and desire to win. ""Our physical presence, wanting to win every duel -- that was good for us today and was missing a little bit in the last few games,"" he said."
40,21/10/2020,22:56,Coman strikes again as Bayern open title defence by routing Atletico,Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman picked up where he left off last season with two goals in a 4-0 home rout of Atletico Madrid on Wednesday as the holders got the defence of their Champions League campaign off to a winning start.,"Coman, whose header settled last season's Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain just 59 days ago in Lisbon, scored Bayern's opening goal, created their second and claimed their fourth behind closed doors at the Allianz Arena. ""We played very well, I am very happy with my two goals,"" Coman told Sky Sports. ""The winning goal in last season's final is a good motivator, but it's in the past now and we have fresh goals this season."" Coman saved his best for last with a superb effort, turning the Atletico defence inside out before firing home on 72 minutes. Goals by midfielders Leon Goretzka and Corentin Tolisso, who produced an unstoppable long-range strike from outside the box, added to Atletico's misery in Munich. The defeat was the joint heaviest Atletico has suffered under Diego Simeone, rivalling the 4-0 drubbing dished out at Dortmund almost exactly two years ago. ""I am very pleased with the win, especially in defence, and we were rewarded for our hard work,"" said head coach Hansi Flick after Bayern's 12th straight win in Europe dating back to their 2018/19 last 16 defeat to Liverpool. There were nervous moments in the build-up before UEFA confirmed the game could go ahead after Bayern winger Serge Gnabry tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. The rest of the Munich squad tested negative in Wednesday morning's round of testing, but Goretzka later admitted Gnabry's positive test was a ""shock"". Both sides had clear early chances as Luis Suarez just failed to connect with a low cross from Atletico left back Renan Lodi, while at the other end Bayern centre-back Niklas Suele hit the post. Suarez again fired wide just before Bayern took the lead. Joshua Kimmich, who celebrated the birth of his second child the night before, won the ball, then turned and put a superb pass into the box which found Coman who fired past Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak on 29 minutes. Coman then turned provider when the France winger darted into the area, spotted Goretzka free and the central midfielder beat Oblak to make it 2-0 at the break. Atletico appeared to have pulled a goal back early in the second half when Joao Felix tapped home, but the VAR spotted Suarez offside in the build up. Tolisso grabbed Bayern's third just after the hour mark when he blasted home a thunderous strike after Kimmich's effort had been charged down. Coman capped a fine individual display when he twisted and turned his way past marker Felipe before deftly firing home on 77 minutes. The 24-year-old was almost immediately substituted after helping establish a four-goal cushion with back-to-back away group games at Moscow and Salzburg in the coming weeks."

There were fears the match would be postponed if other Munich players had been infected. However, additional tests of the rest of the Bayern squad on Wednesday morning all returned negative results. The local health authority in Munich, who have checked people who came into contact with Gnabry, also reportedly raised no objections to the match taking place. The game at Munich's Allianz Arena will take place behind closed doors. Gnabry is the first Bayern Munich player to have tested positive with the coronavirus. Kingsley Coman went into domestic quarantine in mid-September after he had contact with someone infected with the virus. cpb-ryj/td"
42,14/08/2020,00:26,'So much pressure': Simeone defends Atletico after Champions League exit,Diego Simeone said Atletico Madrid were weighed down by the pressure and intensity of a long season as they crashed out of the Champions League on Thursday against Leipzig.,"Leipzig will play Paris Saint-Germain in the semi-finals on Tuesday after Tyler Adams' deflected shot in the 88th minute earned them a shock 2-1 victory in Lisbon. Atletico's Joao Felix had earlier scored a penalty to cancel out Dani Olmo's opener. Defeat ends a disappointing season for Atletico, who finished third in La Liga, 17 points behind Real Madrid. ""We didn't have that physical sharpness or rhythm,"" said Simeone afterwards. ""At the end of a season with so much pressure, so much need to get into the Champions League, and the need to integrate new players. ""We came with a lot of hope. The feeling is a lot of bitterness but I know the players gave everything. They gave it their all."" Questions will be asked about Simeone's future and his ability to turn this Atletico side into winners again, while sticking to his defensive style of play. ""I have nothing to say to anyone about what we did this season. It's a good season, third in La Liga, quarter-finalists in Champions League,"" Simeone said. ""Next season will be tough, very tough."" Simeone admitted Leipzig were the better team and deserved to go through to the semis. ""They were better, faster,"" he added. ""We gave everything and we leave with dignity, with an opponent who deserves their victory."""
43,14/08/2020,00:04,"'I'm not typical goal scorer,' says Leipzig match winner Adams","United States midfielder Tyler Adams basked in the glory of scoring Leipzig's late winner against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals on Thursday and admitted: ""I am not your typical goal scorer.""","Leipzig, who were only founded in 2009, reached the semi-finals for the first time with a 2-1 win over Atletico, twice runners-up. They will face Paris Saint-Germain for a place in the final. Holding midfielder Adams scored the winner in the 88th minute, his first goal for the club, after a Joao Felix penalty had cancelled out Dani Olmo's opener for Leipzig. ""I am not your typical goal scorer, but I am happy I could help the team,"" said Adams, who came on as a substitute. Adams' effort came after his fired shot took a cruel deflection of Stefan Savic and flew in. ""Coming into this game, I was told I wasn't starting but needed to be ready to come off the bench and make an impact, so I had to get myself in the right mindset to come out and help in anyway possible,"" added the 21-year-old. ""We are really excited, we know Paris Saint-Germain are a good team and we saw that yesterday what they did against Atalanta, with the players they had on the field, so we need to match that energy. ""Now it's about recovering in the right way, getting our mentality and preparing a game plan, but we are confident in our abilities like you saw today and we will bring what we are capable of."""
44,13/08/2020,23:56,Leipzig beat Atletico to book historic meeting with PSG,Leipzig stunned Atletico Madrid 2-1 on Thursday to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time as Tyler Adams' 88th-minute winner earned them a showdown with Paris Saint-Germain.,"Atletico looked to have secured extra-time at the Estadio Jose Alvalade when Joao Felix won and then scored a penalty to cancel out Dani Olmo's headed opener early in the second half. But Adams proved an unlikely hero for Leipzig, coming off the bench to snatch victory in Lisbon after his fired effort took a cruel deflection of Stefan Savic and flew in. The win marks an historic night for Leipzig, who were only formed 11 years ago and played their first ever season in Germany's top flight in 2016. Progress to the last four also puts another feather in the cap of their coach Julian Nagelsmann, whose stock will rise even further after ousting Diego Simeone, one of this competition's most gnarly tacticians. ""I'm perhaps one of the happiest coaches in the world,"" Nagelsmann said. ""We were the better team, the result is totally OK. The second goal is a bit lucky but we found the space behind the defensive line. I think we were the better team today."" Their challenge is now to defeat PSG on Tuesday, the French champions who have only played three matches in almost half a year and needed a late escape to see off Atalanta on Tuesday. ""It's normal that when you get to the next round, you want more,"" Nagelsmann said. ""Tonight we're happy. Tomorrow we'll start looking at Paris. That will be another difficult game but we'll have a plan."" For Atletico and Simeone, this was an opportunity spurned to go far in Europe at the end of what has been a disappointing season in Spain. After Real Madrid's loss against Manchester City, only Barcelona are left to fly the Spanish flag in this tournament and they face a formidable challenge against Bayern Munich on Friday. Questions will be asked again about the future of Simeone, who has struggled to recreate an Atletico side capable of challenging for major honours. His notoriously defensive approach, which saw off holders Liverpool in the last 16, looked outdated here against the slick, quick and free-flowing style of their opponents. ""It hurts a lot,"" said Atletico's Saul Niguez. ""They had superiority in many areas on the pitch, inside, outside. Many times we were not even close to stopping them."" A forgettable first half was more worrying for Atletico, who struggled to escape their own half, even if Leipzig never really turned their pressure into any chances. Marcel Halstenberg had the best opening but lashed over on the volley at the back post while the excellent Dayot Upamecano headed straight into the hands of Jan Oblak when given too much space in the box. In between, VAR took a long time looking at a possible Atletico penalty but the contact between Peter Gulasci and Niguez's heel was minimal and the correct decision was made. Leipzig were still in the ascendancy after half-time. Sabitzer had been captain until he picked up a knee injury in June and it was his perfect cross that created the opener, Olmo nipping in at the front post and heading past Oblak into the far corner. Simeone threw on Felix to spark his team into life and the 20-year-old made a difference. He played a neat one-two with Diego Costa before poking the ball away from the lunging Lukas Klostermann. Felix went down and then got up to score the penalty. Atletico owned the momentum but they let it go as the game drifted towards extra-time. Leipzig sensed an opportunity and in the 88th minute, they struck. The ball was brilliantly switched left to Angelino, whose pulled cross fooled the retreating Atletico defence and landed at the feet of Adams on the edge of the area. He had time to size up his shot, the finish spinning up off the left foot of Savic and leaving Oblak helpless."

US international Tyler Adams scored the winner in the 88th minute after a Joao Felix penalty had cancelled out Dani Olmo's opener for Leipzig.
46,12/08/2020,03:04,Stars aligning for Atletico with Champions League glory not so far away,Atletico Madrid's triumph over Liverpool in March was a throwback to a more celebrated past under Diego Simeone but five months on and the Champions League offers them a very real opportunity in the present.,"Knocking out the holders at Anfield may prove to be the first glimpse of a new era under Simeone, where the likes of Joao Felix, Marcos Llorente, Jose Gimenez and Jan Oblak push Atletico to challenge for major honours again. Or it could be a last hurrah for the Simeone project, which some believe will never again scale the heights of their incredible La Liga title win in 2014 or their runs to the Champions League finals in 2014 and 2016. Either way, few believed Llorente's two goals in extra-time would be the start of something even more surprising, namely Simeone lifting the cup in May. Certainly nobody anticipated football shutting down completely the following week, as nervousness turned to indignation about Atletico fans travelling to Anfield, before matches behind closed foors became matches postponed indefinitely. And yet when football returned in June, Atletico were transformed. They went unbeaten in the 11 games after the resumption, to dispel concerns they could miss out on La Liga's four. They won seven matches and drew four, one of them against Barcelona at Camp Nou, which helped Real Madrid clinch the title. They scored 20 goals and conceded six. If the season had started when the league restarted, Atletico would have finished second. ""We did well and we know we're on a really good streak but the Champions League is a different competition,"" said Diego Costa last week. Atletico face Leipzig in Lisbon on Thursday as one of the form teams still standing, in a tournament that has gifted them the significantly kinder half of the draw. If they beat Leipzig, who laboured to a third-place finish in the Bundesliga, they will face either Atalanta, the tournament's minnows or Paris Saint-Germain, who have played two games in almost half a year. Meanwhile, in the other half, only one of Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester City and Lyon can reach the final. Without doubt, Atletico's opponents and potential semi-final opponents will be just as eager to capitalise, especially PSG, whose longing for success in the Champions League has come to define them. And it is unknown how Simeone's squad will be affected by the club's announcement on Sunday that Angel Correa and Sime Vrsaljko tested positive for coronavirus, with both players, who would likely have been on the bench, left at home. A required second round of tests on Sunday meant preparations had to be tweaked, including delaying the squad's flight to Lisbon from Monday until Tuesday afternoon. But it is hard to shake the sense that as a team, Atletico are very well-placed, even if the club have always appeared more comfortable as under-dogs under Simeone than burdened by expectation. Even the new format could suit them, in single matches where game management is likely to be key and technical superiority has less time to win out than over the traditional 180 minutes. A riled Jurgen Klopp said after Liverpool's 1-0 defeat at the Wanda Metropolitano in February that Atletico's backs-to-the-wall approach would not be as effective without their own fans. Yet they were able to frustrate Liverpool at Anfield too, before winning 3-2 in the second leg. ""It's important to accept the new format because once you accept it, you can adapt,"" said Atleti's Saul Niguez. Leipzig, meanwhile, were still in the title race in March and considered a threat even in the Champions League, on the back of destroying Jose Mourinho's Tottenham in the last 16. But they have been less effective since the restart and will be less potent without Timo Werner, whose move to Chelsea cruelly prevents him from finishing what he started in the Champions League. It could be Atletico's year."

Nagelsmann wants to avoid falling ""under the spell"" of any heated emotions during the game in Lisbon, ""but will concentrate on the (match) content, on the team"". ""You're better off doing that than getting into an in-fight."" Leipzig, who are backed by Austrian energy drinks giants Red Bull, were only founded in 2009 and are in the knock-out phase of the Champions League for the first time having beaten last season's finalists Tottenham in the last 16. Without the crowd masking any pitchside noise at the Estadio Jose Alvalade Nagelsmann is aware that his duel with Simeone will be even more intensely scrutinised. ""Now without spectators, you will be able to hear even more that he is always pointing things out, discussing a lot with the referee and demanding the use of cards,"" said Nagelsmann. His Leipzig players are aware that things could get heated. ""I'm curious to see how things will work out with Julian and Diego Simeone,"" Leipzig defender Marcel Halstenberg told Sportbuzzer. ""They are both very emotional blokes."" Certainly, Nagelsmann has lots of respect for Simeone who has repeatedly steered Atletico to Champions League success after nearly a decade in Madrid. ""He wants to be successful. That's what sets him apart"" said Nagelsmann. Atletico are hoping to finally prevail in the Champions League final at the third attempt after losing to Real Madrid in both 2014 and 2016. They have also won the Europa League twice under Simeone in 2012 and 2018. ""My colleague,"" Nagelsmann told Goal.com in reference to Simeone, ""must have an extraordinary gift. ""I believe that 99 per cent of coaches who would always play 4-4-2 in such an aggressive fashion would be burned out after two years, but not him."" Simeone ""runs around like dynamite and still gets great feedback from his players"", added Nagelsmann in admiration. Bayern Munich defender Lucas Hernandez, who spent five years under Simeone, vouches that the Argentinian's mentality was ""visible every minute and in every training session"". Nagelsmann says such pitchside passion comes across as ""a certain degree of craziness"", which he finds appealing, but come Thursday he will try to ignore what is happening on the Atletico bench. Atletico defender Sime Vrsaljko and winger Angel Correa both tested positive for coronavirus over the weekend and were isolated. However, the quarter-final will go ahead after the entire Atletico squad and staff have since returned negative tests."

Atletico breathed a sigh of relief on Monday as their players and staff all returned negative results in a further round of testing before the team flew to Portugal. ""We know that there are clear UEFA protocols for such cases. If it remains two cases, it won't have much effect,"" said Nagelsmann. ""We are concentrating entirely on our preparation and won't let it get to us."" RB Leipzig, who were only founded in 2009, had never got to the knockout stages in Europe's top club competition before this season, and having beaten Tottenham in the last 16, they are eager to claim another big-name scalp. Nagelsmann's biggest concern is trying to replace the firepower of Timo Werner, who netted 34 times this term, including four goals in the Champions League, before the Germany striker joined Chelsea last month. Denmark striker Yussuf Poulsen is set to partner Czech Republic forward Patrik Schick, who is on loan from Roma, up front on Thursday. ""Once you're there, you must have the determination to go all the way to the final and the title,"" Poulsen told AFP subsidiary SID. The German side are fully aware of what to expect against Diego Simeone's Atletico, who have plenty of experience at this stage of the competition. ""Atletico are a strong team, they show it every year in the Champions League,"" said Leipzig's Dani Olmo, with Atletico finishing runners-up in both 2014 and 2016. ""We have trained very well and we are ready for this big task,"" he added."

The club did not say whether the positive tests concerned players, coaching staff or officials. Atletico said a fresh round of tests was being carried out on the squad and backroom staff on Monday. A UEFA spokesman said: ""The match is planned to be played as scheduled. We have no further comments to make."" Atletico said in a statement on Sunday that the two individuals who tested positive ""are self-isolating in their respective homes"". In an unprecedented move during a season that was halted for three months by the coronavirus pandemic, UEFA decided that the Champions League will be completed in a 'final eight' tournament in Lisbon. Under the UEFA protocol for European competitions, a team must have 13 healthy players, including a goalkeeper, for a match to go ahead. Failing that, UEFA can give the go-ahead for the match to be re-scheduled. The quarter-finals start on Wednesday when Italian side Atalanta take on Paris Saint-Germain. The final is scheduled to take place on August 23."

""Among the results known today, two positives have appeared and they are self-isolating in their respective homes."" It was not revealed whether the two positive cases involved players or backroom staff. Atletico said UEFA as well as the Spanish and Portuguese football and health authorities have been informed and that a fresh round of tests will be carried out on the squad and support team. They admitted this could mean last-minute changes to travel schedules as well as accommodation plans in the Portuguese capital. ""The club will coordinate the new schedules with UEFA and as soon as there is a new plan it will be made public,"" added the statement. ""We also request the utmost respect over the identity of the two positive cases."" The team were due to travel to Portugal on Monday for the closing stages of the Champions League which is being held in Lisbon as a precaution against COVID-19 rather than risk having teams travelling across Europe for home-and-away ties. The self-contained eight-team tournament will be staged behind closed doors, starting on Wednesday with the final set for Lisbon on August 23. Spain has so far been one of the countries worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic, with 310,000 registered infections and 28,500 deaths. Although most sports have returned from a months-long lockdown caused by the virus, there are concerns that numbers of cases are beginning to rise again. In recent days, Spain has seen local quarantines imposed in the Basque Country, Catalonia and Aragon. Protective face masks have been made compulsory in several busy areas, especially in the Madrid region. Last month, Atletico's city rivals Real Madrid announced forward Mariano Diaz had tested positive for COVID-19. Sevilla, meanwhile, reported an unnamed player had also contracted the illness. Real have since been knocked out of the Champions League but Sevilla are still involved in the Europa League. They play English side Wolves in their quarter-final in Duisburg, Germany, on Tuesday. The Champions League had been put on hold since March because of the virus with the last-16 stage only completed on Friday and Saturday. In their statement on Sunday, Atletico were keen to reassure football authorities, explaining that they had followed a very strict protocol even after the end of La Liga season on July 19. Weekly tests were carried out on July 26 and August 2. For its 'Final Eight' tournament in Portugal, UEFA has planned strict protocols -- each team will have to provide test results before travelling to the country, and will be tested again on the eve of their first match. Each positive test will require the individual to self-isolate."

Trippier has been given until May 18 to respond. ""Kieran Trippier has been charged with misconduct in relation to alleged breaches of the FA's betting rules"", the FA said in a statement outlining their regulations. The statement said: ""A participant shall not bet, either directly or indirectly, or instruct, permit, cause or enable any person to bet on - (i) the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in or in connection with, a football match or competition; or (ii) any other matter concerning or related to football anywhere in the world, including, for example and without limitation, the transfer of players, employment of managers, team selection or disciplinary matters."" The defender released a statement saying he would continue to fully cooperate with the investigation. ""I have fully complied with the FA's investigation over the past several months on a voluntary basis and will continue to do so,"" he said. ""I want to make it clear that while a professional footballer, I have at no stage placed any football-related bets or received any financial benefit from others betting."" Atletico said Trippier would be exonerated. ""The player has informed us he is calm because he has done nothing wrong,"" said a club source. ""It seems ridiculous to him that someone would try to link him to something like this. ""He will collaborate with everything to clear it up as soon as possible. He is sure that in time things will become clear."" Trippier could face a lengthy ban if found guilty. In March, former Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge was handed a worldwide four-month ban from all football-related activity for passing on inside information on potential transfer moves in January 2018."

Days later Spain was forced into a nationwide lockdown and mass gatherings, including all major sporting events, in Britain were cancelled. Madrid has been one of the European cities worst-hit by coronavirus and the Spanish capital's mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida said it had been a ""mistake"" to play the game. ""If people have contracted coronavirus as a direct result of a sporting event that we believe shouldn't have taken place, well that is scandalous,"" Steve Rotheram, Mayor of Liverpool City Region, told the BBC. ""That needs to be investigated to find out whether some of those infections are due directly to the Atletico fans. There were coronavirus hot cities, and Madrid was one of those. ""They weren't allowed to congregate in their own country, but 3,000 of those fans came over to ours, and potentially may well have spread coronavirus. ""So it does need looking at, and it does need the government to take some responsibility for not locking down sooner."" The UK government has insisted it was following scientific advice when it allowed the match and other major events such as the Cheltenham horse racing festival to go ahead in the same week. However, the British government's deputy chief scientific adviser, Angela McLean, said on Monday that infections in Liverpool due to the Atletico match was an ""interesting hypothesis"". Atletico won the game 3-2 after extra-time to knock out the defending champions 4-2 on aggregate and progress to the quarter-finals."

You will forever live in our hearts. Rest in peace,"" the club tweeted. Spanish sports daily Marca said Antic had been suffering from a serious illness for a long time. Antic, who first moved to Spain as a player with Real Zaragoza in 1978, managed Atletico across three different spells between 1995 and 2000 and led the club to a league and cup double in his first season. He also coached Barcelona during the second part of the 2002-03 campaign after replacing the sacked Louis van Gaal. His first stint at one of Spain's big clubs came during a 10-month spell with Real in 1991-92. On the international stage, he led his native Serbia to the 2010 World Cup, where his team beat Germany 1-0 in the group stage but failed to advance to the knockout rounds. The Serbian football federation paid tribute to Antic as it confirmed the news of his death on its website. ""All those who knew Radomir will from now on have an emptiness in their heart and Serbia can be proud to have had such a man who was abroad and represented a source of pride,"" the federation said. After leaving Partizan Belgrade in 1976 to sign for Fenerbahce, Antic moved to Zaragoza for two years before finishing his career in England with Luton Town. He helped the club achieve promotion to the English top flight in 1982, and scored the goal that helped them stay up on the final day of the following season. ""We are devastated to learn of the passing of Town legend Radomir Antic, at the age of 71. A true Hatters hero, for promotion and preventing relegation.

Atletico added that an agreement with the first team will enable the club to supplement the salaries of the 430 staff put on partial unemployment. ""The first team will contribute half of the necessary amount and the members of the club's Management Committee, made up of the CEO and the directors of the different areas, the other half,"" the statement said. On Monday, Lionel Messi announced that his Barca teammates had agreed to the same pay cut, and that they would also supplement the salaries of the club's employees.

Atleti are among a raft of clubs set to take a huge financial hit due to the indefinite suspension of football in Spain, one of the countries worst hit by COVID-19. Gil did not outline by how much salaries would be cut, but confirmed that the measure concerned both players and staff. Earlier on Friday La Liga's bottom club Espanyol asked labour authorities in Catalonia to allow them to cut player and staff salaries by 70 percent. Espanyol said that the proposed reduction regards players and coaching staff from the men's and women's first teams, Espanyol B and youth teams, and was made ""unilaterally for reasons of urgency"". City rivals Barcelona said on Thursday that they were cutting salaries -- although they did not specify who would be affected -- in order to stave off financial issues, with football in Spain suspended until further notice as the country joins Italy at the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic In Germany, players at Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund have accepted pay cuts. The clubs' move to cut salaries has left the players' union Fifpro concerned. ""We are extremely concerned that a significant number of clubs, in more than half a dozen countries, have begun to immediately lay off players or unilaterally reduce their salaries,"" Fifpro said in a statement. The union called on clubs experiencing financial hardship to meet their national leagues to find a fair and proportionate solution.

59,12/03/2020,13:00,Atletico defeat casts shadow over Liverpool's historic season,Liverpool's Champions League defence is over after Atletico Madrid played the role of party poopers at Anfield and paved the way for a strangely anti-climactic end to the season for Jurgen Klopp's Reds.,"Barring an unprecedented collapse, Klopp will deliver a first league title in 30 years, though there is some doubt over whether the season can even be completed due to the coronavirus outbreak. Liverpool, after a record-breaking start to the Premier League campaign, had the title effectively sewn up by Christmas but failure to add more silverware during a historic season now feels like a let-down. ""For two and a half years we had an exceptional ride in the Champions League, we had party after party after party in the Champions League pretty much,"" said Klopp, whose side were also finalists in 2018. ""Tonight was a party, everything was set, it was great -- crowd exceptional, the stadium, everything showed up in the best way. The boys delivered a super game, fought hard, played well, and scored wonderful goals. But we lost."" Atletico's 3-2 win in extra time on Wednesday completed a 4-2 aggregate victory and inflicted Klopp's first home defeat in Europe in five years as Liverpool boss, even though the Spanish side were pinned against the ropes by the holders for 94 minutes. That was how long it took the hosts to score their second goal to move 2-0 in front on the night as a combination of wayward finishing and some brilliant goalkeeping from Jan Oblak forced the tie into extra time. The post-mortem following Liverpool's exit points to a tale of two goalkeepers. Atletico coach Diego Simeone hailed Oblak as the best in the world. Liverpool's Alisson Becker is another contender for that crown but, with the Brazilian sidelined by a hip injury, one error from his stand-in Adrian changed the course of the tie. A poor clearance from the Spaniard allowed Joao Felix to set up Marcos Llorente to curl home the away goal Atletico craved. Llorente then scored again before half-time in extra time and Alvaro Morata rubbed salt in Liverpool wounds with the last kick of the game. Klopp admitted he sounded like a sore loser as he bemoaned Simeone's smash-and-grab style despite managing a side boasting ""world-class"" talents such as Joao Felix, Saul Niguez and Koke. However, the German must also reflect on the use of his forward options and focus on how Liverpool can improve. Roberto Firmino's strike was his first goal at Anfield all season and the normally prolific Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah were wasteful. All three have already played well over 3,000 minutes this season after featuring in international tournaments for their countries last summer. Only when the game was already effectively gone at half-time in extra time did Klopp turn to last season's Champions League hero, Divock Origi. Liverpool's exceptional recruitment has lifted them under Klopp from battling to qualify for the Champions League to being expected to defend their trophy. But Adrian, on a free transfer, was the only senior player added to their squad last summer and back-up for the front three must now be a priority, with Mane and Salah expected to depart for another Africa Cup of Nations in the middle of next season. Liverpool's exit was also another blow to the Premier League's prestige. Last season Premier League clubs made up half of the last eight and Liverpool won an all-English final against Tottenham Hotspur at Atletico's Wanda Metropolitano home. After Tottenham's 4-0 aggregate thrashing at the hands of RB Leipzig and with Chelsea trailing 3-0 from the home leg of their last-16 tie against Bayern Munich, Manchester City represent the only realistic hope of English representation in the quarter-finals as they lead Real Madrid 2-1."
60,12/03/2020,01:01,'We play to win': Simeone defends Atletico style after shocking Liverpool,"Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone defended his side's approach after dumping Liverpool out of the Champions League with a 3-2 victory after extra time at Anfield to progress to the quarter-finals, winning 4-2 on aggregate.","The holders looked to have ended Atletico's dogged resistance when Roberto Firmino put them ahead in the last-16 tie after Georginio Wijnaldum's first-half header forced the second leg into an extra 30 minutes. However, Liverpool were made to rue a host of missed chances to kill the tie off in 90 minutes as Llorente twice curled home from outside the box before Alvaro Morata twisted the knife by breaking away to score in added time of extra time. Defeat ends Jurgen Klopp's proud record of never losing a two-legged European tie as Liverpool manager and he took a swipe of Atletico's defensive tactics. ""The way they play, I don't get it,"" said Klopp. ""They could play proper football but they stand deep and have counter-attacks."" It remains to be seen if and when Atletico will play in the last eight due to the chaos caused across the continent by the new coronavirus. But Simeone basked in another famous European night for the side he has twice led to the final in his eight years in charge. ""We play to win, with the arms that we have,"" said Simeone. ""Respecting our identity, the characteristics of our players and exploiting the defects of our rivals."" A packed Anfield played its part in trying to roar Liverpool onto another Champions League conquest as, unlike in numerous countries across Europe, no restrictions have so far been put on supporters attending games in the United Kingdom. But it was the nearly 3,000 travelling fans in attendance, despite the fact games in Spain will be played behind closed doors for the next two weeks, that celebrated a stoic rearguard display from their side. The European champions did not manage a single shot on target in a 1-0 defeat in Madrid three weeks ago, but Jan Oblak was quickly put to work. But Oblak was helpless as Liverpool levelled the tie just before half-time through Wijnaldum's powerful downward header. The goal did not change Atletico's approach as they played a risky game and relied on Oblak to keep them in the game. The Slovenian saved from Mohamed Salah, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Firmino, while Andy Robertson hit the bar as Liverpool missed a number of chances that ultimately came back to cost them. ""I have no doubt Oblak is the best goalkeeper in the world,"" added Simeone. Despite Liverpool being on the brink of a first Premier League title in 30 years, their number nine Firmino had not scored at home all season until four minutes into extra-time. The Brazilian's header from Wijnaldum's cross came back off the post and perfectly back into his path to slot home with Oblak grounded. ""Everybody who saw the game tonight knows it could have been different,"" said Klopp. ""I loved our first 90 minutes, but we scored the second goal too late."" However, no sooner had Liverpool gone in front for the first time in the tie than Atletico hit back with a sucker-punch. The visitors had barely tested stand-in Liverpool goalkeeper Adrian, but the loss of Alisson Becker to a hip injury eventually proved Liverpool's downfall. Adrian fired a simple clearance straight to Joao Felix, who fed Llorente and he found the bottom corner. ""The pass was not helpful. Adrian is a super player, I love the boy, but in this moment, it is the wrong decision,"" added Klopp. Llorente had joined Atletico from bitter rivals Real Madrid in a controversial move in June. But the man whose father and great uncle, Francisco Gento, also played for Real, made himself a Rojiblanco hero with a second that secured Atletico's place in the last eight with another precise low finish in added time at the end of the first half of extra time. Another former Real player Morata then broke away and finished calmly to inflict Liverpool's first Champions League home defeat since 2014."
61,12/03/2020,00:28,'Bad loser' Klopp takes swipe at Atletico tactics,Jurgen Klopp hit out at Atletico Madrid's defensive approach after holders Liverpool were knocked out of the Champions League on Wednesday.,"Klopp's side were on course for the quarter-finals after taking a 2-0 lead in extra time in the last-16 second leg. Goals from Georginio Wijnaldum and Roberto Firmino left Liverpool 2-1 up on aggregate at Anfield. But a howler from Liverpool goalkeeper Adrian opened the floodgates as Marcos Llorente struck twice before Alvaro Morata completed Atletico's 4-2 aggregate triumph. It was a bitter blow for Reds boss Klopp, who had seen his team dominate the first 90 minutes without taking enough chances to win the tie. Klopp couldn't hide his frustration at the way Atletico manager Diego Simeone set up his side in a cautious counter-attacking style for long periods. ""It's so difficult to play a side like this. I don't understand with the quality they have the football they play,"" Klopp told BT Sport. ""They could play proper football but they stand deep and have counter-attacks. ""I realise I am a really bad loser, especially when the boys put such an effort in against world-class players on the other side who defend with two rows of four."" The defeat ended Liverpool's bid for a third successive Champions League final appearance. ""It doesn't feel right. I'm searching for the right words to be honest. The 90 minutes were exceptional,"" he said. ""After the second goal the legs were a bit tired. Everything that looked really natural in the first 90 minutes became a bit stiff. The crosses did not have the same quality. ""We shouldn't have conceded these kinds of goals. It's difficult to explain to be honest. ""Our main mistake was to not score the second goal five minutes earlier. We scored it in extra time and not in the 90 minutes. ""Everything was against us in the decisive moments. We will come again but now we are out."" Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson insisted his team deserved to win on the balance of play, but the midfielder admitted they paid for some sloppy mistakes. ""We are really disappointed with the result because we deserved to go through,"" he said. ""We are bitterly disappointed with the goals we have conceded. To concede the goals we did isn't like us. You need to be fully focused at all times, any mistake can cost you."" Runaway leaders Liverpool are still set to win the Premier League title despite their recent blip and Henderson said: ""Tonight and tomorrow it will not feel nice but we have to react in the right way and finish the season off well."""
62,11/03/2020,23:53,Three things we learned from Liverpool v Atletico Madrid,Champions League holders Liverpool crashed out in the last 16 on Wednesday after a stunning fightback from Atletico Madrid sealed a 3-2 win on the night and a 4-2 aggregate success.,"<strong>worldfootball.net</strong> looks at three things we learned from Liverpool's unexpected exit: For much of this season, Liverpool had looked like an unstoppable juggernaut as they powered towards the Premier League title and a potentially successful defence of the Champions League. But in the space of just three weeks, Jurgen Klopp's team have unexpectedly lost their way and the slump has shattered their bid for a seventh European Cup and an unbeaten Premier League campaign. When Liverpool arrived in Madrid for the first leg on February 18, they were on the crest of a wave. But a limp 1-0 defeat there was an unsettling glimpse of what was to come as the Reds' run of 18 successive Premier League wins was ended by lowly Watford in a stunning 3-0 defeat. A 2-0 FA Cup fifth round defeat at Chelsea would be partially excused by Klopp sending out a slightly weakened team. Liverpool still looked shaky in a narrow 2-1 success against struggling Bournemouth on Saturday, yet they should have been out of sight before Atletico authored their incredible comeback. The hosts had 26 shots in the first 90 minutes but could only manage one goal from Georginio Wijnaldum thanks to their poor finishing and the inspired form of Atletico keeper Jan Oblak. That forced extra time and when Roberto Firmino scored his first Anfield goal of the season Liverpool were 2-1 up on aggregate. Yet Adrian's mistake was punished by Marcos Llorente to give the Spaniards hope and Llorente netted again before Alvaro Morata capped the epic collapse. Liverpool will still win the title but the shock on Klopp's face was clear to see. Just 167 seconds after Roberto Firmino appeared to have put Liverpool on course for the quarter-finals, Adrian's howler gave Atletico a lifeline that turned the tie on its head. The Liverpool goalkeeper made a total hash of a routine kick downfield and booted the ball straight to Joao Felix. Atletico striker Felix picked out Llorente and he cut inside to fire back past Adrian. It was a hammer blow that Liverpool could not recover from, underlining just how much Klopp's side missed the injured Alisson Becker. Adrian, 33, has been guilty of other errors this season when he has stood in for Alisson this term and once again he fluffed his lines. Alisson is sidelined with a hip injury suffered in training prior to Liverpool's FA Cup defeat at Chelsea and former West Ham keeper Adrian was guilty of allowing Willian's shot to slip through his grasp into the net in that clash. While Liverpool look certain to win the Premier League regardless of who is in goal, Alisson is not expected back in the short term, giving Klopp a headache as he considers whether to keep faith with Adrian. With sport across the world thrown into chaos by the coronavirus, Liverpool were bucking the current trend for playing behind closed doors, but their supporters might have wished the game had been part of the fan ban as the Reds crashed to a stunning exit. Fears about the growing spread of the deadly virus have prompted sports governing bodies to cancel matches and tournaments. Football matches in several European countries have been played in empty stadiums as authorities limit large public gatherings and Paris Saint-Germain beat Borussia Dortmund in a deserted Parc des Princes in their last 16 second leg on Wednesday. Many Europa League ties scheduled for Thursday are due to be played in closed grounds, but Liverpool were given the all-clear to open the gates for Atletico's visit and 54,000 crammed into the famous old arena. Aside from Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and Atletico boss Diego Simeone exchanging a shoulder bump instead of a handshake before kick-off and players from both teams not shaking hands, as per the virus guidelines, the alarming outbreak was put to one side as fans focused on a classic European tie."
63,18/02/2020,23:50,'Welcome to Anfield': Klopp warns Atletico,Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp expects a very different atmosphere at Anfield will help turn his side's Champions League last 16 tie with Atletico Madrid around after a 1-0 first leg defeat in the Spanish capital on Tuesday.,"Saul Niguez's early strike inflicted just Liverpool's second defeat of the season in all competitions with a senior team. The holders were frustrated by the hosts' playacting and Polish referee Szymon Marciniak's performance as Atletico boss Diego Simeone whipped the Wanda Metropolitano crowd into a frenzy. ""Wow, that's energy!"" Klopp told BT Sport when asked about Simeone's touchline antics. ""I don't think I have to do that much to be honest (in the second leg), I hope I can be focused a little bit more on the game. ""Our people will be ready. Welcome to Anfield! It's not over yet."" Klopp replaced Sadio Mane at half-time with the Senegalese at risk of being sent-off as Atletico players surrounded Marciniak demanding a second yellow card for the African player of the year just before the break. ""He was targeted that was clear,"" added Klopp. ""Sadio played a really good first half and they only thing they wanted is to make sure he gets a yellow card. ""For me we didn't lose, it's only half-time, the score is 1-0 that's all. But you need to be really strong as a ref in this atmosphere, that was obviously not easy."" The visitors were also riled by the celebrations of Simeone and some of his players at full-time after they secured a victory that could kickstart at faltering season. ""They've celebrated as if they've won the tie after the game, so let's see,"" said left-back Andy Robertson. ""We've got a couple of weeks, Premier League business to take care of, and then we're coming back to Anfield. ""We know our fans will be there, we'll be there, so it's up to them to come as well."""
64,11/01/2020,03:18,Real Madrid face Atletico as imposters gatecrash Spanish Super Cup final in Saudi,"Lionel Messi has predictably been the star attraction but there will be no Clasico in Saudi Arabia this weekend, as Atletico Madrid's defeat of Barcelona set up a clash with rivals Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday.","Messi was cheered by fans at the King Abdullah Sport City Stadium from the moment he jogged out to warm up, yet Atletico were the ones celebrating at the end of Thursday's semi-final in the competition that has been expanded and controversially shipped to a different continent, to a country with a long-condemned record on human rights. Atletico scored two late goals to beat Barca 3-2, with a derby final now to come against Real Madrid. When the Spanish Football Federation signed a three-year contract worth 120 million euros ($133.4 million) to move the tournament to Saudi, a title showdown between Real and Barcelona would very likely have been top of the organisers' wishlist. The draw kept the clubs apart in the semis and a new four-team format ensured Real and Atletico were able to participate at all, given they would not have qualified for the traditional two-legged showdown between league champions and winners of the Copa del Rey. Including the two other highest-placed finishers in La Liga all-but ensures entry for Barcelona and Real Madrid every year but, as this competition has shown, there is no guarantee of progress. ""The Super Cup will be decided by its guests,"" read Catalan sports daily Mundo Deportivo on Friday. ""Second in the league against semi-finalist in the cup."" An all-Madrid final in Jeddah offers both Atletico and Real the chance to claim a first trophy of the campaign and perhaps a valuable psychological boost too. Certainly, Barcelona and Valencia will resume in La Liga with their rhythm jolted and confidence knocked. After seven games unbeaten, Valencia were outplayed in their 3-1 semi-final defeat by Real while Barca's late collapse against Atletico brings doubts around coach Ernesto Valverde rushing back to the surface. Already on Friday, reports in the Spanish press were linking the club's former midfielder Xavi Hernandez -- who has been coaching in Qatar -- with taking his job in the summer. ""There is always instability when you lose,"" admitted Valverde. Just as defeat to a rival creates instability, victory could prove affirming for Real, who look to convert form into a lead in La Liga's title race, and Atletico, who are trying to close a five-point gap. Atletico have been gaining momentum in the league and their victory over Barcelona will be a major boost ahead of what promises to be a tough second half of the season. They sit third in the league table with trips to Camp Nou and the Santiago Bernabeu to come while in the Champions League they face Europe's most feared team, Liverpool, next month. Yet even if they were on the back foot for long spells of their 3-2 win on Thursday, Atletico defied their creative problems with three goals and at least two good chances for more. ""It is important for the club, we beat the best attacking team in the world,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone said. ""You saw our bite, our belief, our desire. It's what this club is all about."" Real Madrid, meanwhile, were a class above Valencia, making it 15 games unbeaten even without their top scorer Karim Benzema, who has a hamstring strain, and Gareth Bale, who has a throat infection. Bale could yet join up with the squad for the final on Sunday - although it remains unlikely - but there is no doubt Real will start as favourites to claim an 11th Spanish Super Cup and deny Atletico their third. ""I'm happy with the whole performance,"" said Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane. ""But it is a semi-final, we haven't won anything yet."" Real Madrid's progress means they will earn around 10 million euros from the tournament, with Atletico making around six. Success on Sunday would cap a highly profitable week."
65,09/01/2020,22:01,Atletico stun Barca to set up all-Madrid Super Cup final,Atletico Madrid sprung a surprise in the Spanish Super Cup by staging a thrilling comeback to beat Barcelona 3-2 on Thursday and set up a final against Real Madrid.,"Barca looked on course for a Sunday showdown against Real when they led Atletico 2-1 with nine minutes left but instead it will be a Madrid derby in Saudi Arabia to decide who lifts the trophy. All five goals were scored during a wild second half in Jeddah that began with Koke putting Atletico in front, just 21 seconds after coming on as a substitute at the interval. Goals from Lionel Messi and Antoine Griezmann turned the game on its head, only for Atletico to hit back with a late double, Alvaro Morata converting a penalty in the 81st minute before Angel Correa found a winner in the 86th. In between, Barcelona also had two goals ruled out after VAR spotted tight offsides while Atleti were denied what looked a clear penalty at 2-2, after the ball clipped the hand of Gerard Pique. A pulsating contest will have delighted the Spanish Football Federation, who have faced heavy criticism for taking the competition away from Spain to a different continent, and a country that has a long-condemned record on human rights. Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said on Wednesday he preferred the old format but his strong team selection, that included Messi, Griezmann and Luis Suarez, suggested this was a tournament he was eager to win. It remains to be seen how this defeat might affect the La Liga title race, with Real Madrid and Atletico now enjoying the opportunity not only to win a trophy but score a psychological boost too. Barca dominated the first half and Griezmann had the best chance, only for his lifted finish from the angle to be saved by the excellent Jan Oblak. Atletico survived and frustration spilled over at the break as Jordi Alba poked a finger in the face of Joao Felix, who then went head-to-head with Messi. Suarez also had to be pulled away by Stefan Savic. A spikey end to the first period was trumped by an explosive start to the second as Koke, on for less than a minute, gave Atletico the lead. Felix started the move and Correa slipped a pass behind the scrambling Sergi Roberto for Koke to stab into the bottom corner. Simeone chose not to celebrate and if he was worried about the amount of time left, he was right, as Barcelona scored twice in 11 minutes. First, Messi equalised after muscling his way through both Koke and Savic on the edge of the area and then he fired in again after steering a high ball around Koke. This time, however, VAR showed his elbow had served as a cushion. Disappointment was brief though as Alba crossed for Suarez and while his header was brilliant pawed away by Oblak, Griezmann nodded in the rebound. Pique thought he had a third after Arturo Vidal half-volleyed Messi's free-kick across the box but again VAR intervened. Atletico were revived. Correa should have pulled them level but appeared keener to find Felix than shoot himself and when the rebound did fall to the Felix, Sergi Roberto made a last-ditch block. But the floodgates had opened in the Barca defence. Vitolo was next to go clear and this time he was brought down by Neto. Morata converted the penalty. Then, Morata skipped free down the right and his cross seemed to strike the dangling hand of Pique but after consulting VAR, the referee strangely decided against another penalty. Yet moments later, Atletico were in again. Correa this time sprinted in behind and while Neto made a block, the ball had enough power to cross the line. Now, Simeone could celebrate."
66,08/01/2020,19:44,"Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia due to money, says Valverde",Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said Wednesday the Spanish Super Cup is being held in Saudi Arabia because of the money on offer and admits he preferred the previous format.,"Barca face Atletico Madrid in the second semi-final on Thursday after Real Madrid take on Valencia on Wednesday. The winner will play for the trophy at the King Abdullah Sport City Stadium in Jeddah on Sunday. This is the first year the Spanish Super Cup has been held in Saudi Arabia, after a controversial three-year contract worth 120 million euros was struck with the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), who run the competition. The clubs will also benefit financially. For participating alone, Real Madrid and Barcelona will earn around 6 million euros while Atletico and Valencia will make around 3 million euros. But the RFEF have faced accusations of betraying local Spanish fans while critics also question the association with a country long-condemned for its treatment of women and record on human rights. ""I know there has been a lot said about this competition but the bottom line is football has become a business and as a business it looks for income,"" said Valverde at a press conference in Jeddah. ""That's the reason we are all here."" Previously, the Spanish Super Cup has been held in Spain in August, before the start of the league season and involving only the winners of La Liga and champions of the Copa del Rey. But the RFEF has not only changed the location but expanded the format, with the next two highest placed teams in La Liga also now taking part. ""It's a completely different format to what we're used to,"" said Valverde. ""It was always the first title and the opener of the season and to me that seemed fine. ""It's been changed and let's see, it will be judged once it has happened. It's interesting, with four good teams, but from a sporting point of view, I'm not sure."" Valverde's press conference was delayed by over an hour after the team's bus got lost on the way. ""We certainly know the city a bit better now,"" he said with a smile. ""There was a small mistake because the driver thought the press conference was at the stadium where Real Madrid and Valencia are playing tonight. He realised before we got there but then there was a bit of traffic so we were late."""
67,03/01/2020,18:57,Barcelona to be without goalkeeper Ter Stegen,Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen will miss the derby match against Espanyol on Saturday through injury and is unlikely to play in next week's Spanish Super Cup.,"""It is true that he has some problems in the tendon,"" said coach Ernesto Valverde in a press conference on Friday. ""He will not be available tomorrow and for the Super Cup it will be difficult too. He will return after the Super Cup."" The club had said on Monday that Ter Stegen is undergoing treatment on a problem with his right knee. Barcelona said the decision to begin treatment was made after the team's last league match before the winter break against Alaves. Asked if Ter Stegen might need surgery, Valverde said: ""I don't know, I'm not a doctor, but we have not spoken about that. Our plan is that he will get better and we have not gone to that extreme."" Ter Stegen's absence means Neto will likely play in goal. The 30-year-old signed from Valencia last summer but has only made one appearance for his new club, against Inter Milan when Barca had already qualified for the Champions League's last 16. ""He has a great attitude, both in training every day and when he has played,"" Valverde said. ""We have no doubts about him."" Espanyol are bottom of La Liga but will be hoping to spring a surprise against their Catalan rivals in what will be their first game under new coach Abelardo. ""They are in a difficult situation but in a derby you play with your heart and they are going to try to give themselves a lift,"" Valverde said. Barcelona have allowed 21-year-old midfielder Carles Alena to join Real Betis on loan but Valverde said he does not expect more departures in the January transfer window. ""Alena has left, I thought that if it happened it wasn't going to be so soon but he had a chance to leave because of a clause in his contract,"" Valverde said. ""We have one less player now but I am not thinking about any others leaving."" Arthur Melo will also miss the game against Espanyol with a hip injury while Ousmane Dembele is still recovering from a hamstring problem."
68,23/12/2019,17:54,Atletico 'very close' to signing PSG striker Cavani: report,"PSG striker Edinson Cavani is poised to move to Atletico Madrid in a transfer deal which could be inked in the coming days, the Marca sports daily reported Monday.","Rumours of a possible move from Paris Saint-Germain have been on the cards for months, but may be imminent, given the Uruguayan forward's frustration at being left on the bench, the Spanish paper said. ""The transfer could take place in the coming days. In principle, the agreement would be for two-and-a-half seasons, although it is still up for discussion,"" it said of Cavani, whose contract with PSG is up in June. But securing PSG's agreement for an immediate transfer of their best-ever goal scorer, which would likely happen during the winter transfer window that opens on January 1, would doubtless be subject to much negotiation. French radio station RMCsport also said Cavani had inked a deal with the Madrid club, and that PSG were ""open to the idea of letting Cavani go this winter"". Although Cavani is currently not a regular PSG starter, the Parisians are likely to need him from February when they enter the decisive phase for Ligue 1, the Champions League and domestic Cup action, Marca said."
69,22/12/2019,18:55,Supersub Correa lifts Atletico fourth in Spain,Angel Correa came off the bench to score one and make another as Atletico Madrid climbed back into the La Liga's top four with a 2-1 win at Real Betis on Sunday.,"The red-and-white half of Madrid were in the doldrums after a home defeat to Barcelona a month ago but have since qualified for the Champions League last-16 where they can savour the chance of measuring themselves against Liverpool, and have now climbed back into the Liga reckoning. European champions Liverpool travel to Madrid in February for their Champions League match and will have noted the combativity and commitment inspired by Atletico's feisty Argentine coach Diego Simeone. ""Correa showed what he's made of today, we've been training him hard. He put on good pressure to get the first goal and a nice pass for the second,"" said Simeone. ""But I was just as pleased to see him fighting for the win right at the end, when the team needed him."" It might have been sunny and warm in the southern Spanish town Seville where Betis play but Christmas was in the air as fans threw thousand of toys onto the pitch for local charities. The goals all came after the break as second-half sub Correa came on for struggling France international Thomas Lemar on 56 minutes and scored with his first touch of the game to set Atletico on the road to a third straight win. Former Real Madrid, Juventus and Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata gave Atletico a 2-0 lead late on before a stoppage time consolation strike for the home fans came from Marc Bartra. It also ended five straight away draws for Atletico, who have managed just 20 goals in the first half of the season since they sold star striker Antoine Griezmann to Barca in the summer."
70,05/11/2019,16:54,Leverkusen boss Bosz hoping for a Champions League miracle,"Despite three defeats in their first games, Bayer Leverkusen boss Peter Bosz is optimistic they can beat Atletico Madrid on Wednesday to kindle their slim knock-out phase hopes and pull off a Champions League miracle.","Defeats to Lokomotiv Moscow, Juventus and Atletico leave Leverkusen without a point at the bottom of Group D with only three games left. It has been more than 15 years since a team managed to progress in the Champions League despite losing their first three games when Newcastle United managed to finish second in 2002/03 group stages by winning all of their last three games. Nevertheless, Bosz wants a win over Atletico, who beat his side 1-0 in Madrid a fortnight ago and are level on seven points with Juventus at the top of the group, to belatedly kick-start their European campaign. ""The chance is small, but it is still there,"" said Bosz defiantly on Tuesday. ""There are still nine points available in the group. ""I am a fighter and I'll only say it's over when it really is. ""We want to stay in European competition after the winter break, so we need points."" After Atletico, Leverkusen face a tough away match in Moscow against Lokomotiv, then host Cristiano Ronaldo-led Juventus in their final group game. Having only lost to a goal by Alvaro Morata at Madrid in their last game, Leverkusen defender Sven Bender is cautiously hopeful of their chances against Atletico. ""We stayed in the game in Madrid, have what it takes to beat Atletico and we want to give everything to win on Wednesday,"" said the former Germany defender."
71,02/11/2019,23:24,Real and Atletico fail to capitalise after Barca stunned by Levante,Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid each passed up the chance to go top of La Liga on Saturday after Barcelona conceded three goals in seven minutes during a surprise 3-1 defeat by Levante.,"Lionel Messi converted a first-half penalty at the City of Valencia Stadium for his sixth goal in five games only for Levante to stun the defending champions with an incredible treble shortly after the hour. Yet Atletico and Sevilla played out a 1-1 draw at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, where Diego Costa missed a penalty, before Real squandered a string of opportunities at the Santiago Bernabeu in a goalless draw against Real Betis. It means Barca will be relieved to stay at the summit - ahead of Atletico by a point with a game in hand and in front of Real on goal difference - even if their collapse against Levante should offer encouragement to their title rivals. Meanwhile, Granada will overtake them all if they beat Real Sociedad on Sunday. ""Everything unravelled,"" said Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde. ""We didn't start the second half well, we weren't creating chances and although they weren't either they suddenly scored two goals. The third one hurt us a lot."" Jose Campana and Borja Mayoral scored in the 61st and 63rd minutes before Nemanja Radoja added a third in the 68th to leave their disheveled opponents with too much to do. After seven wins on the bounce in all competitions, Barca arrived in Valencia as overwhelming favourites, particularly given the irresistible form of Messi, whose goal was the 500th of his career with his left foot. ""Opponents always play us like it is one of the biggest games of the year,"" Valverde added. ""You have to have an answer."" After any Barcelona defeat, Valverde's future is a topic for discussion. Asked if he was surprised by his players or might consider resignation, he said: ""No, to both questions."" To make matters worse, Luis Suarez was forced off in the 41st minute with an injury to his right calf and would now appear to be a doubt for Tuesday's Champions League game at home to Slavia Prague. An unfortunate half for Suarez had seen him booked for a foul committed by Arthur Melo but referee Hernandez Hernandez corrected his error after being made aware by VAR. Messi swept home his penalty after Jorge Miramon brought down Nelson Semedo and Messi might have made it two, but this time Miramon restored some credit by clearing off the line. Levante began the second half on the front foot but nobody could have predicted what was to follow. First, Pique's under-hit clearance was punished, as Mayoral and Jose Luis Morales shifted the ball inside to Campana, who struck hard into the corner. Then a loose Carles Perez header allowed Mayoral space and he did brilliantly to curl past the outstretched right hand of Marc-Andre ter Stegen. With the home fans still celebrating, Radoja made it three. Barcelona again failed to clear and Radoja's effort might have been saved had Sergio Busquets, on as a substitute, not caused a cruel deflection. Messi thought he had launched a comeback when he bundled through and poked in but Antoine Griezmann was offside and Levante might even have made it four late on if Gonzalo Melero been more precise. It left Real Madrid, Atletico and Sevilla all with the chance to claim top spot but none seized the initiative. Real are yet to establish a consistent run of results, even if they created more than enough chances to beat Betis and on another day might have scored five. Eden Hazard saw a much-needed goal ruled out and Sergio Ramos went close too before Karim Benzema skewed wide at the back post from four yards. The best opportunity fell to Ferland Mendy but, with only Joel Robles to beat, he lifted his finish up, over and wide. Hazard had waved Mendy through and might have wondered why he did not take the ball himself. Betis rode their luck, particularly when Zouhair Feddal handled in the box, while Vinicius Junior and Ramos hit the goalkeeper amid mad scrambles in injury-time. Atletico will also rue chances missed, with Costa most guilty, his 72nd-minute penalty saved by Tomas Vaclik after Alvaro Morata cancelled out Franco Vazquez's opener."
72,29/10/2019,21:14,Atletico pegged back by Lucas stunner,Alvaro Morata scored his third goal in as many games but it was not enough for Atletico Madrid as they were hit by a stunning late equaliser on Tuesday in a 1-1 draw against Alaves.,"Morata came off the bench at Mendizorrotza and his smart finish looked like it would prove the winner in a tight contest between two of La Liga's most stubborn defences. But Atletico missed chances to add a second and were punished in the 83rd minute as Lucas Perez beat Jan Oblak with a superb long-range strike to earn Alaves a hard-earned point. Diego Simeone had hailed Oblak as the best goalkeeper in the world after Atleti beat Athletic Bilbao on Saturday but there was little the Slovenian could do about one of the goals of the season so far. Yet Atletico will still lament two points dropped and a result that leaves them fourth in the table, a point behind surprise leaders Granada. Diego Costa had been dropped against Bilbao but was restored to the starting line-up at the expense of Morata, despite the Spaniard scoring last weekend and hitting the winner against Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League last week. With a difficult trip to Sevilla to come on Saturday, Simeone rested other key players too, like Thomas Partey and Koke, both of whom came on in the second half, as well as Kieran Trippier. Alaves had conceded only one goal in their five previous homes games this season and chances were almost non-existent in the first half. Both teams showed more ambition in the second 45 minutes though as Joselu headed wide for Alaves and Atletico's Renan Lodi saw a shot whistle past the far post. Morata came on in the 60th minute and was welcomed with a crunching challenge by Victor Laguardia but the striker was not deterred and struck the opener 10 minutes later. It was a brilliant passage of forward play as he chested down Oblak's punt up-field, played a slick one-two with Angel Correa before sliding in a cool finish. He should have made it two soon after but a poor backpass went unpunished and Correa was then denied by the foot of Fernando Pacheco after some excellent work by Thomas. The slender advantage left Atletico vulnerable and Lucas delivered the game's stand-out moment seven minutes from the end. Saul Niguez and Lodi might have made it more difficult for the 31-year-old to cut in from the right but Lucas made the most of the space. His stinging shot from 25 yards beat the right hand of Oblak and soared into the top corner."
73,26/10/2019,23:48,Costa left out as Morata on target again in Atletico victory,Diego Simeone's decision to leave out Diego Costa was vindicated on Saturday as Atletico Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao and Costa's replacement Alvaro Morata scored in the 2-0 victory.,"Morata had been the one to sit on the bench against Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday but his winning goal as a substitute earned him a start against Bilbao and the Spaniard delivered again. ""The changes were good for the team,"" said Simeone. ""It was a great performance."" Morata's finish in the second half at the Wanda Metropolitano, after Saul Niguez had opened the scoring, secured Atletico a comfortable win that puts them above Real Madrid in the La Liga table and level on points with Barcelona. The postponement of the Clasico due to unrest in Catalonia gave Simeone's side the chance to close the gap on the top two and sustain momentum from their gritty win in the Champions League. Morata had rescued Atletico against Leverkusen but the decision to omit him, and now Costa, suggests Simeone feels there is a need for fresh thinking up front. Since missing the first two games of the season with a thigh injury, Costa had started all 10 thereafter, despite managing to score only two goals, one of them from the penalty spot. It remains to be seen if Simeone will leave him out for long but Correa was the provider for both of Atletico's goals while Morata's smile after coming off late on suggested he thought his was a job well done. ""Correa did very well, he showed what he can do,"" Simeone said. ""Morata now has two goals in two games and we want Diego to get in on the act as well, because he is important for us too."" This was only the third time in 13 games this term that Atletico have won by more than a single goal and there were other positives to take too. Koke, whistled by his own fans on Tuesday, improved and there was a clean sheet for an unfamiliar back four, in the absence of injured duo Stefan Savic and Jose Gimenez. Bilbao, who slip to 10th, were disappointing and have now lost three of their last five games, drawing the other two. Yet they might have been ahead in the opening two minutes had Jan Oblak not dived to his right and brilliantly clawed Inigo Martinez's header away from the top corner. ""He is the best goalkeeper in the world without any doubt,"" said Simeone. Atletico took the lead in the 28th minute and Correa provided it, his wiggling run through three Bilbao defenders ending with a poked pass to the arriving Saul, who made no mistake. Kieran Trippier did well to block a stinging shot from Raul Garcia and he was involved in his side's second shortly after the hour. He collected the ball on the right from Thomas Partey's pass and set the ball back for Koke. Bilbao expected the cross but instead Koke slid a ball inside for Correa, who drove the ball to the back post where Morata could not miss. Muniain went close late on with an acrobatic volley after Inaki Williams' header found him free but his shot found the side-netting and any hopes of a comeback were dashed."
74,23/10/2019,16:53,Barca pay 15 million euros for first refusal on Atletico youngsters,"Barcelona have paid Atletico Madrid 15 million euros for the right to be given first refusal on six Atletico players, AFP learned on Tuesday.","Atletico sources have told AFP the agreement has ""nothing to do"" with the dispute between the two clubs over the transfer of Antoine Griezmann last summer. ""It is a right of first refusal on a list of players primarily from the academy,"" these sources added. Spanish newspaper El Mundo had claimed on Tuesday the fee is to ""make peace in the Griezmann case"". The agreement allows Barcelona to match or exceed any offers for those players whenever the player wants to leave, Atletico agree to sell and an acceptable bid arrives from a separate club. Griezmnann left Atletico for Barcelona when the Catalan club activated his release clause of 120 million euros in July. Atletico claimed they were due 200 million euros from the transfer because they said Griezmann had agreed to move to Barca in March, before the clause dropped on July 1. The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) fined Barcelona 300 euros on September 26 for failing to notify Atletico they were in talks with the Frenchman. But the RFEF concluded there was no evidence Griezmann had signed a formal contract with Barca."
75,22/10/2019,21:25,Morata makes his point by scoring winner for Atletico,Alvaro Morata came off the bench and rescued Atletico Madrid when his late header gave Diego Simeone's side a gritty 1-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League on Tuesday.,"Morata, dropped after missing chances in Atletico's draw with Valencia in La Liga on Saturday, played as if he had a point to prove in a match-winning cameo at the Wanda Metropolitano. Victory leaves Atletico with seven points from their opening three games in Group D and on the brink of qualification, with only top spot seemingly to be settled, most likely with Juventus. For Leverkusen, three defeats from three all but ends their hopes of progress and continues a disappointing start to the season that also has them sitting ninth in the Bundesliga. Atletico have been on a poor run themselves, managing only two wins from their last eight games in all competitions and slipping to fifth in the league, behind both Barcelona and Real Madrid. This was hardly a performance to alleviate concerns, particularly about their fluidity in attack, but Morata's goal at least gets them back to winning and ensures their task in the group stage is almost complete. Simeone will have been worried to see his central defender Jose Gimenez forced off injured in the 15th minute. He who would appear unlikely to recover in time for Atletico's game at home to Athletic Bilbao on Saturday. When Mario Hermoso replaced Gimenez, it meant Atletico's defence was made up entirely of summer signings. When these sides last met in the last 16 in 2017, Leverkusen's Kai Havertz was unable to play because of school exams. The promising 20-year-old started up front on Tuesday but was starved of service. A frantic opening 10 minutes set the tone for a first half that was high on intensity but lacking either creativity or clear-cut chances. Costa almost pounced after Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky scooped up Angel Correa's shot but failed to keep hold of the ball. Otherwise, frustration grew. Costa lambasted Koke for a missed pass and Simeone castigated Kieran Trippier for losing possession and ignoring a simple ball inside. After half-time both sides were more ambitious. Costa could have scored, but failed to connect with a free header from Trippier's cross. Costa then felt he should have had a penalty when Sven Bender slipped and the striker stepped on the fallen defender's hand and went down. Referee Artur Dias waved away the appeals. Thomas Lemar and Morata came on for Correa and Koke, who was whistled as he departed, only for a furious Simeone to order the fans to clap, which most of them duly did. Both substitutes were involved in the winner. Lemar drove through midfield and played the ball left to Renan Lodi, who curved a brilliant cross to the near post, where Morata powered in, his header too strong for Hradecky's right hand. Morata celebrated by running to the bench. He was feral in the remaining minutes, rampaging at Leverkusen's back-line, blocking off as many clearances as he could. Kevin Volland had Leverkusen's only sniff of an equaliser but his finish was blocked and Atletico held on."

""Joao Felix underwent an X-ray and MRI scan at the Clinica Universidad de Navarra on Saturday evening, which confirmed a grade II right ankle sprain,"" Atletico said in a statement. Felix, who joined Atletico for 126 million euros ($140.7 million) from Benfica last summer, left his team with 10 men after coach Diego Simeone had already used all three of his substitutes. Valencia's Dani Parejo equalised from a free-kick moments later, after Diego Costa had scored a penalty for Atletico in the first half."

A ""formal request"" from La Liga and Villarreal and Atletico calls for the December 6 game to be held at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium at 4:00 p.m. (2000 GMT). Thursday's La Liga statement stressed that both teams agree that moving their match to Miami is in line with the league's overseas development strategy. ""The players and management of both clubs have been informed and have shown their enthusiasm for bringing their football to the fans in the United States,"" La Liga stated. Mindful of last season's aborted Barcelona bid the statement stressed that this time the AFE ""has already been informed""."
79,01/10/2019,23:32,Felix shines as Atletico earn key win at Lokomotiv,Portuguese teenager Joao Felix scored his first Champions League goal on Tuesday as Atletico Madrid recorded a precious 2-0 win away to Lokomotiv Moscow.,"The 19-year-old Felix, Atletico's club-record signing, put the visitors ahead three minutes after half-time in Russia and helped set up Thomas Partey for the second goal on the hour. Diego Simeone's side sit level on four points at the top of Group D with Juventus, who eased to a 3-0 victory at home to Bayer Leverkusen. ""I'm delighted to score my first Champions League goal. It was a great game, and the important thing was that we came away with the three points,"" said Felix, who joined Atletico in July for 126 million euros ($142 million). ""It was a question of time before the goals started to flow and more will come."" Diego Costa squandered a glorious chance to grab his first goal in the competition since September 2018 as he contrived to spoon over from point-blank range after Felix flicked on a corner towards the far post. Alvaro Morata, also enduring a lengthy Champions League drought, forced a smart save from Guilherme at his near post shortly before half-time. Atletico rallied from two goals down a fortnight ago in a 2-2 draw with Juventus, but they took the lead here on 48 minutes when Felix stabbed in a rebound after his first effort was parried by Guilherme. Felix, who last season became the youngest player to score a hat-trick in the Europa League while with Benfica, created the second goal with a searing break from deep. Atletico cleared a corner and Felix surged into the Lokomotiv half before floating a cross-field ball towards Costa, who unselfishly squared for a sliding Partey to tap home on 58 minutes. Jan Oblak produced two sublime stops to twice deny Grzegorz Krychowiak as Atletico remained unbeaten in seven trips to Russia, winning for the fourth time in five visits to Moscow."
80,30/09/2019,04:00,Defence is king as Madrid go back to basics ahead of Brugge test,Real Madrid's revolution was supposed to be built around their attack but resilience has been the base for the recovery ahead of their Champions League group game at home to Club Brugge on Tuesday.,"At the end of last season, as Zinedine Zidane's dreary run-in came to a close and paved the way for what many expected to be a spectacular summer, polls were published by Madrid's newspapers asking fans which of the world's deadliest strikers they hoped would arrive at the Santiago Bernabeu. Harry Kane, Mohamed Salah, Sergio Aguero, Mauro Icardi and Robert Lewandowski were some of the names offered up and, in the end, Luka Jovic arrived, the Serbian who has struggled for starts so far and is yet to score a goal. Eden Hazard is tasked too with helping fill the void left by Cristiano Ronaldo, even if the Belgian's own opening in Madrid has also been underwhelming, stalled by injury and now seemingly a period of adjustment. ""We would like him to score because it will release him,"" said Zidane on Saturday. ""But there is no problem with him."" Yet the stalemate against Atletico Madrid, in which neither side ever looked likely to find a winner, was a a stark indication of how Real Madrid have relied on their defence to ease the pressure on their coach. ""We have been compact and again we have not conceded,"" said Zidane after the derby draw. ""We have missed a little offensively but we are in it and we can improve."" This is the first time Madrid have kept three consecutive clean sheets in the league under Zidane and in the games against Sevilla, Osasuna and Atletico, they have had to cope with just a single shot on target. ""Defending is very important, it is the fundamentals,"" Zidane said. The turnaround has been remarkable from Paris Saint-Germain, whose 3-0 win in the Champions League 10 days ago was Zidane's worst ever defeat as coach, as well as Levante and Villarreal, who had just scored twice against Madrid in the league. When they were floundering last season, the focus was on their lack of goals but Madrid's defending was arguably just as problematic, with Sergio Ramos, Raphael Varane and Marcelo all woefully out of sorts. After missing the loss to PSG, Ramos' return has coincided with the trio of clean sheets and his performances have been tighter too, more disciplined and less prone to extravagance. But perhaps the biggest gains have been made ahead of him, in central midfield where Zidane's options are light but boosted by two excellent displays from Fede Valverde, who was given a chance in the rotated line-up against Osasuna and impressed enough in defensive midfield to keep his place. ""I want to highlight Valverde as well,"" Zidane said after Osasuna. ""He played a brutal match."" Ahead of Valverde, there has been more diligence from the front three, with Zidane singling out Gareth Bale for praise a handful of times since his move away failed to materialise in the summer transfer window. Zidane's scepticism around Bale in the past has centred on a belief the Welshman cannot be trusted to defend but against Sevilla it was Bale who was at his own back post in injury tme, hacking a cross clear from danger. ""Gareth is doing very well,"" Zidane said. ""Above all he is also helping a lot in the defensive areas and it shows. The team is more comfortable when we all defend."" Perhaps as well, there is a sense of a team finding its reality after a fantasy summer, a coming to terms with the need to build this new era not on glamour signings but going back to basics. They restart this week in the Champions League too, where PSG's victory makes the French side favourites to go through top of Group A but a win over Brugge would at least get Madrid on the board. The rematch at home to PSG comes in November and before then, the season's first Clasico against Barcelona arrives at the end of the month. Zidane will hope his defence can hold firm."
81,28/09/2019,23:12,Real hold off Atletico in tight derby to grab top spot in Spain,Real Madrid regained top spot in La Liga on Saturday after a goalless derby with Atletico that saw them move above surprise package Granada and maintain their small lead over a crowded chasing pack.,"Real will stay top by a point over promoted Granada and Atletico Madrid after Diego Simeone's side failed to break down their well-drilled local rivals, whose disciplined performance at the Wanda Metropolitano was deserving of at least the point they gained. They are a further point ahead of fourth-placed Barcelona, who won a hard-fought clash at Getafe 2-0 thanks to goals from Luis Suarez and Junior, and Real Sociedad who travel to a Sevilla side down in eight but just five points behind Zidane's leaders. On a night of few clear-cut chances Atletico probably had the best opportunities but failed to test Thibaut Courtois in the Real goal, while the away side drew a couple of fine saves from Jan Oblak on their forays forward. The best came 15 minutes from the end, when the Slovenian stopper got down brilliantly to his left to palm away Karim Benzema's powerful header from a Nacho cross. Just seconds before Atletico had come to within inches of opening the scoring when Saul Niguez met a corner with a header that flashed just past the upright. Granada had moved temporarily top of La Liga before the derby after Antonio Puertas' first-half strike saw them squeeze past rock-bottom Leganes. Puertas crashed his long-range winner into an empty net after Juan Soriano had come charging out of his goal to close down Roberto Soldado just before the half-hour mark. A remarkable counter-attack goal launched by Marc-Andre Ter Stegen and finished off by Luis Suarez put Barcelona on their way four minutes before the break at Getafe, and Junior's tap-in shortly after the restart made sure of Barca's first away win since April. ""This match was crucial for us to rid ourselves of the sensation of never being able to win away,"" said Valverde. ""We didn't play well in the first half but once we took the lead they basically didn't have any chances."" Ter Stegen is embroiled in a row with Bayern Munich captain Manuel Neuer over the Barca stopper's lack of opportunities with the Germany team. However he showed his class when he raced out of his goal to stop a Getafe attack before launching a pin-point pass over the home side's dozing defence to Suarez, who calmly lobbed the opener over David Soria. ""Sometimes when passes come off like this the goalkeeper is just clearing the ball. I don't know if that is the case here, but regardless he brings us a lot,"" added Valverde. The win was Barca's second in a week as they attempt to recover from an miserable start that led to questions surrounding Valverde's future. Athletic Bilbao lost for the first time this season at home to crisis club Valencia, who bagged their second win of the season thanks to Denis Cheryshev's 27th minute strike. 'Los Che' had been sent into turmoil when owner Peter Lim sacked Marcelino Garcia Toral earlier in the month. But despite player and fan anger at Lim's decision, two draws and now a win after their shock victory at Chelsea in the Champions League have them in ninth on nine points."
82,27/09/2019,02:55,Recoveries at stake as Real Madrid face Atletico in La Liga derby,Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid have each averted a mini-crisis already this season and one of the rewards for the winner of the derby on Saturday would be to stall their rival's recovery.,"In a press conference last week, Zinedine Zidane was asked six questions about his future as coach of Real Madrid, one of them whether he was irritated by Jose Mourinho's very public hankering for the job. ""I know how it works,"" Zidane said. ""It's not about whether it bothers me or doesn't bother me. If you lose, things have to change."" A few hours later, Atletico were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Celta Vigo, a blunt display that raised familiar concerns about the threat of their attack and made it two draws and a defeat in a week. ""Atleti fans are demanding so I am not surprised by the criticism at all,"" said Diego Simeone. ""Coaches are always to blame when you lose."" Yet at the Wanda Metropolitano this weekend, it will be La Liga's first against third, even if the ascendancy of Madrid's two premier clubs perhaps says as much about the chaos of the opening few weeks in Spain as it does about the strength of their revivals. Real Madrid are top and while Zidane discounts the fact, their turnaround has been impressive. It began against Sevilla, who could have gone top themselves, and at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, where Madrid had previously won just once in seven years. ""The satisfaction is tremendous,"" said Zidane. ""We have been questioned a lot."" ""The team has responded,"" said Sergio Ramos. It began on the back of losing 3-0 to Paris Saint-Germain too in the Champions League and, even further back, a turbulent summer that saw Zidane frustrated by key targets, like Paul Pogba, missed and wanted departures, like Gareth Bale, failing to materialise. Many though questioned his relationship with the club's president Florentino Perez and in that context off the pitch, there was a readiness for disappointment on it. When results dipped and performances failed to improve, the sense was it had been coming. Beating Sevilla and then promoted Osasuna on Wednesday has turned the tide, not least because there was a resilience and purpose so previously lacking. In each game, Madrid managed not to concede a single shot on target. ""What has changed is that we believe in what we do,"" Zidane said. ""Now we are at our beginning."" Atletico is an opportunity to maintain momentum and it might be that a draw, at this early stage in the season, is acceptable to both, particularly ahead of the second round of Champions League group games next week. Certainly, Atleti needed their win away at Mallorca on Wednesday, even if Alvaro Morata's mindless sending off, eight minutes after coming on as a substitute, means the Spaniard will be suspended for the derby this weekend. Morata's absence makes it all the more likely Diego Costa will keep his place up front alongside Joao Felix, particularly after it was their goals that sealed the Mallorca win. Simeone said Atletico had been working individually to solve Costa's drought, which had seen him go without a goal since March. ""Strikers live off goals,"" said Simeone. ""His goal is good for him and good for the team."" After starting the season with three consecutive victories, Atletico were being circled as genuine contenders for the title but defeat to Real Sociedad and the stalemate against Celta had tempered expectations. One win has restored belief but this game will be taken as an early litmus test for the threat that these teams pose. Neither will want to fail it. Barcelona's stuttering start has arguably been the most worrying of all but they too enjoyed a rejuvenating win over Villarreal in midweek, ahead of their visit to Getafe on Saturday. Scepticism around coach Ernesto Valverde is never far from the surface at Camp Nou and it remains to be seen whether Barca can now leave behind their own sticky patch, and without Lionel Messi, who is nursing a thigh injury. Valverde might take encouragement from last season when his side won only once in five games through the end of September and early October. They went on to win the title by 11 points."
83,26/09/2019,14:46,Barcelona fined paltry 300 euros for tapping up Griezmann,Barcelona have been fined a mere 300 euros ($328) after the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) found the club guilty of tapping up Antoine Griezmann last season while he was still attached to Atletico Madrid.,"Barca signed Griezmann after paying his 120-million-euro buyout clause in July, prompting Atletico to claim the Catalan club had negotiated with the Frenchman without their permission. The RFEF published its decision on Thursday, in which it said Barcelona were guilty of holding talks with Griezmann but insisted it was not possible to prove a formal contract was signed. The RFEF also acknowledged the insignificance of the fine, which represents only 0.000045 percent of Barcelona's 671.42 million-euro salary budget this season. The RFEF's statement read: ""Taking into account the economic capacity of the club and the amount of the fine, this committee is aware that the payment of 300 euros, beyond its merely symbolic character, will not damage the sanctioned club and, probably, will not persuade other clubs in the same situation in the future to adjust their conduct to the regulations."" But the RFEF said that was ""not a sufficient reason"" to impose the other possible sanction of closing Camp Nou for a match, which it says would be to punish ""infractions of a different nature"". Barcelona had come close to signing Griezmann in 2018, only for the striker to decide to stay and sign a new contract at Atletico Madrid. But Griezmann announced his decision to leave Atletico in May, explaining that he wanted to seek a new challenge away from the club where he had spent five successful seasons. The RFEF said Barcelona ""initiated and maintained negotiations with the player without prior written notice to Atletico Madrid"". But concluded that ""it has not been demonstrated that the contract between Antoine Griezmann and Barcelona was formally signed"". The statement added that the decision ""attaches no disciplinary responsibility whatsoever to the player"". Griezmann has played seven times so far this season for Barcelona and scored three goals."
84,26/09/2019,00:07,Real Madrid and Atletico warm up for city derby with victories,Real Madrid's crisis has been averted for the time being at least after they beat Osasuna 2-0 on Wednesday without Eden Hazard and Gareth Bale to go top of La Liga.,"Hazard and Bale were among a number of players rested by coach Zinedine Zidane, with Real facing seven games in 21 days, the next of them against city rivals Atletico Madrid on Saturday. Vinicius Junior, who has endured a difficult few months, filled the void, bending a shot into the top corner before crying tears of what presumably were a mixture of joy and relief. This time last year the 19-year-old exploded onto the scene but injury and then a dip in form saw him drift, with this a chance to reassert himself in a much-rotated line-up. If Vinicius was Madrid's Brazilian sensation 12 months ago, Rodrygo might be one for the present. The 18-year-old, who was bought from Santos in 2018 but joined last summer, added a superb second goal, and his first for the club, just one minute after coming off the bench for a remarkable debut. ""I'm glad for them,"" said Zidane. ""Sometimes we forget they are 18 (and 19) years old. We have seen the emotion they felt about scoring at the Bernabeu. I liked Rodrygo's goal but I liked the control even more."" Earlier, Atletico's Alvaro Morata made a swift impact too but with less positive results after he was sent off eight minutes after being introduced as a substitute against Real Mallorca. Atletico were already 2-0 up thanks to goals from Diego Costa and Joao Felix but Morata will now be suspended for the derby at the Wanda Metropolitano. The Spaniard's dreadful night got worse as he also appeared to engage in a heated exchange with a fan as he later left the stadium. A week ago it would have been almost unthinkable that Atletico would play their rivals in a contest of first against second in La Liga but that could now be the setting this weekend, depending on Sevilla and Real Sociedad's results on Thursday. La Real beat Atletico, who were then held to a goalless draw by Celta Vigo, but by far the deeper sense of gloom had engulfed Zidane's side, after they were humbled 3-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. That was Real's worst defeat under Zidane as coach and prompted questions about the Frenchman's future, with Jose Mourinho available and seemingly waiting in the wings. Instead, back-to-back victories for the first time since Zidane came back in March have lifted the malaise and offered hope there is still life in this Madrid squad, despite the lack of change since the summer. ""We believe in what we do,"" Zidane said. ""With humility and work you achieve a lot. This is just the start."" The only disappointment might have been the lack of a goal for Luka Jovic, who missed some excellent chances and then did score, only to have it ruled out by VAR. Vinicius had started the first two games of the season but none since, while he was without a goal himself in seven months. His first under Zidane was a peach, coming in the 36th minute, a curling effort that took the slightest of deflections on its way into the top corner. Jovic saw a smart finish ruled out and then watched as Rodrygo scored almost instantly after coming on. The teenager cushioned Casemiro's crossfield pass beautifully before nipping inside Osasuna defender Lillo and banging the ball low and into the net. Atletico's players might have been keeping tabs on their way home from Mallorca but their job was already done after Costa and Felix finally got the goals to suggest they might form a potent partnership together. Costa's was simple, as Mallorca failed to clear Koke's cross and the striker nipped in to head past goalkeeper Manolo Reina. Felix's was more complex but owed something to fortune too. The Portuguese did brilliantly to bring a looping ball down but his finish on the turn took a cruel deflection before spinning up and into the far corner. Morata's moments of madness, that included two bookings in as many minutes after an argument with Mallorca's Xisco Campos, should mean Costa and Felix reunite this weekend."
85,25/09/2019,21:23,Costa and Felix on target but Morata sent off as Atletico beat Mallorca,Diego Costa's partnership with Joao Felix is finally up and running after both scored in Atletico Madrid's 2-0 victory over Real Mallorca on Wednesday.,"Costa headed in on 26 minutes at the Iberostar Stadium and Felix struck again after half-time to set Atletico on their way before Alvaro Morata was sent off just eight minutes after being brought on as a substitute. Morata's punishment will be to miss Atletico's city derby on Saturday against Real Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano, which could be a contest of first against second in La Liga. Atletico sit top of the table on 13 points but Real could overtake them by beating Osasuna later on Wednesday. Athletic Bilbao are one point behind in second place after preserving their unbeaten start to the season with a 1-1 draw at Leganes. Diego Simeone's Atletico appear at least to have put behind them a sticky patch that included two draws and a defeat in three games, even if one of those draws was their thrilling comeback against Juventus in the Champions League. But familiar concerns had returned about Atletico's threat in attack, with Costa failing to score in any of their opening six matches while offering limited service to the 19-year-old Felix, who has shown glimpses of his undeniable talent but is also still adjusting after his summer move from Benfica. Goals for both will have been welcome even against a Mallorca side that now sit 17th, having conceded the joint most goals in the division so far. Given Morata's red card, Costa and Felix are also almost certain to join forces again for the visit of Madrid this weekend. Costa's goal was simple, as Mallorca failed to clear Koke's cross from the right and the striker nipped in to head past goalkeeper Manolo Reina. Felix's was more complex but owed something to fortune too. The Portuguese did brilliantly to bring a looping ball down in the area but his finish on the turn took a cruel deflection before spinning up and into the far corner. The only blot on Atletico's night came from Morata, who was booked twice in two minutes of madness after an argument with Mallorca's Xisco Campos. Morata had come on in the 69th minute and was walking towards the tunnel in the 77th."
86,21/09/2019,20:48,Creativity lacking again as Atletico held by Celta,Atletico Madrid missed the chance to return to the top of La Liga on Saturday as they were held to a goalless draw at home to Celta Vigo.,"After coming from two goals down to salvage a point against Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday, Atletico failed to sustain the momentum in a match of few chances at the Wanda Metropolitano. Atletico had capitalised on the stumbling starts of both Barcelona and Real Madrid by winning their opening three league games this season but they are now two without a victory, following last weekend's shock defeat away at Real Sociedad. They sit level on points with early frontrunners Sevilla, who will host Real Madrid on Sunday. Celta, meanwhile, sit 14th in the table, having won only one of their five games so far, leaving Atletico's coach Diego Simeone with familiar questions to answer about his side's creativity and attacking threat. Summer signing Joao Felix started before being replaced by Alvaro Morata in the second half, the Spanish striker available again after recovering from a knee injury. But neither Felix nor Morata, or their partner Diego Costa, could conjur up the decisive opening, with full-backs Renan Lodi and Kieran Trippier by far the team's most effective outlets in the final third. Atletico were the better side in the first half but only created a handful of chances, none of which could be classed as clear opportunities. Trippier's early free-kick should have been headed in by Felipe Monteiro on his first start for the club but Ruben Blanco did well to react from five yards and push the ball over the crossbar. Ruben made another smart save to deny Lodi's driven effort from 30 yards while Felix found space at the back post soon after but his prodded finish was also tipped away. Celta held their own either side of half-time as the match became increasingly high on intensity but low on quality. Costa wanted a penalty after the hour, claiming he was pushed after failing to make contact with Lodi's cross while Brais Mendez might have scored for Celta had Jan Oblak not been quick to shut down Santi Mina's superb ball through. Lodi fizzed a late shot past the far post but desperation turned to frustration in the closing stages. Lucas Olaza and Costa each picked up a yellow card for a skirmish after the final whistle."
87,18/09/2019,23:48,Herrera snatches late point for Atletico with debut Juve strike,Hector Herrera grabbed a dramatic point on his Atletico Madrid debut with a late header that saw his side come back from two goals down to draw 2-2 in their Champions League opener against Juventus on Wednesday.,"Herrera came off the bench to crash home Kieran Tripper's last-minute corner and complete the comeback after Juve had gone ahead through Juan Cuadrado's superb strike seconds after the break and a bullet header from Blaise Matuidi on 65 minutes. Stefan Savic gave the home fans hope when he pulled one back for Atletico five minutes after Frenchman Matuidi had doubled the away side's lead. ""I'm happy to have made my first appearance and to have helped the team. This side is known for how it always fights to the end,"" said Herrera to TV broadcaster Movistar. ""A draw against a team like Juventus isn't bad at all. We wanted to win the match but a draw is a good result given the quality of the opposition."" Both sides now trail Lokomotiv Moscow in Group D thanks to the Russians' 2-1 win at Bayer Leverkusen after a result that left Maurizio Sarri's Juve disappointed they didn't get more from an impressive second-half display. ""I think we played well but we have a bitter taste in our mouth now because we felt we had the game in our hands,"" said Sarri. ""We need more attention and focus on set-pieces. We will work on that."" Cuadrado had flashed Juve into the lead two minutes after the restart with an exceptional strike after good work from Gonzalo Higuain, who rolled a neat pass that allowed the Colombian to smash home the opener. Jose Maria Gimenez then passed up a good chance to level when he blasted over Koke's pull-back, and the away side capitalised when Matuidi charged onto Alex Sandro's cross and thumped his header past Jan Oblak. The hosts got back into the game almost immediately when Savic headed home a towering Gimenez's perfect knockdown, and they were then pleading for a penalty with seven minutes left when referee Danny Makkelie waved away their appeals despite Matthijs de Ligt kicking the ball onto an unsuspecting Leonardo Bonucci's hand. Juve had almost re-established their two-goal advantage shortly before when Higuain's powerful shot was pushed out to Matuidi, whose follow-up was cleared off the line by Trippier. Atletico got a deserved leveller with yet another header, this time from substitute Herrera who beat an uncharacteristically weak Juve defence to power home his first goal since signing from Porto in the summer. The home fans had to survive one last scare however, with an otherwise quiet Cristiano Ronaldo coming to within centimetres of an incredible winner when his mazy dribble ended with a low drive that beat Oblak and the far post."
88,17/09/2019,03:34,Felix leading the charge for revenge against Ronaldo's Juventus,Young gun Joao Felix will lead the charge on Wednesday as his Atletico Madrid seek revenge on Juventus and their old enemy Cristiano Ronaldo in a potentially fiery Champions League opener.,"Felix, touted as the heir to Ronaldo's throne, will make his debut in Europe's top competition when the when the Portuguese pair meet at the Wanda Metropolitano, with the La Liga outfit keen to shoot down the five-time Ballon d'Or winner. Juventus dumped Atletico out of the competition last year as Ronaldo scored a sensational hat-trick that overturned a 2-0 first-leg deficit and put the Italian champions in the quarter finals. The former Real Madrid man rounded off the evening by celebrating provocatively in front of the away fans at Juve's Allianz Stadium. Now Felix is charged with bringing the old master down a peg or two. The 19-year-old has been hailed as the new 'CR7' after his breakout season at Benfica last year, scoring 20 times as the two-time European champions won the Primeira Liga and reached the Europa League quarter finals. Ronaldo's former manager at Madrid Jose Mourinho is convinced that Atletico bagged a ""an incredible player"" for a club record fee of 126 million euros ($142 million). ""I think he can cope. He seems to have a good personality,"" said Mourinho. ""He's in a good team, surrounded by experienced players, with a manager who knows what he wants. Probably Atletico is a good place for his development."" The noise surrounding Felix was amplified after a sublime pre-season that included a brace in a 2-1 win over Juve, but Felix has shied away from the comparisons. A poor display in Saturday's 2-0 La Liga loss at Real Sociedad showed that. despite the obvious promise, it is still too early to speak of Felix and Ronaldo in the same breath. Felix was hauled off at half-time by Atleti boss Diego Simeone, who said after the defeat -- which cost his side their 100 percent start and top spot in the league -- that ""we have young players who have to weigh in more"". Ronaldo, meanwhile, is in a rich vein of form, with six goals in five matches this season for club and country, as he hunts a sixth Champions League title and aims to extend his record total of 126 goals in the competition. On Wednesday, Felix has a chance to redeem himself and add to the one goal he has scored so far in Atletico colours, even if Ronaldo's achievements seem a long way off. ""I am here to write my own story,"" Felix said. ""Cristiano is Cristiano and I want to be myself"". stt-jed/td/pb <org>SPORT LISBOA E BENFICA - FUTEBOL</org> <org>JUVENTUS FOOTBALL CLUB</org>"
89,02/09/2019,13:50,'For a defender there's no better place in the world to be' - Trippier,"Kieran Trippier had just finished his Atletico Madrid debut and while all the other players had gone, he stayed on the pitch a little longer.","He had his first victory, a clean sheet, and an assist too, swinging in the cross for Alvaro Morata's winner. As he walked off, Trippier pointed at someone in the crowd, applauded and threw a clenched fist above his head, the gratitude visible on his face. ""There was this one Atletico fan, I could hear him non-stop for the first 45 minutes,"" Trippier said in an exclusive interview with AFP. ""He was shouting at me, in a good way, in Spanish and English. He was speaking so fast I found it difficult to understand him but every time I took a throw-in or when I was walking I could just hear this one voice. I wanted to say thank you."" Trippier has played three games in La Liga for Atletico, thrown straight into the starting line-up after signing from Tottenham for 22 million euros ($24.14 million) in July. That debut meant a lot, given where he had come from, a disappointing final season for Spurs, and what he had come into, a defence regarded as the most steely in Europe over the past decade. Yet moving to Spain was the biggest leap. Trippier is the only Englishman playing in La Liga this season and the first to play for Atletico in almost 100 years. ""Every decision I've taken in my career has been a brave one,"" he says. ""Football is about taking risks. ""I'd always fancied playing abroad so I had discussions with Tottenham and said I wanted a new challenge, a new chapter for me and my family. ""To play in Spain was an amazing opportunity, I didn't want it to slip away. No regrets."" ""No regrets"", something Trippier repeats and a mantra that seems to guide his all-in approach to life in Spain. There are still adjustments to be made. ""It is difficult eating later than in England, I get hungry,"" Trippier says with a smile. ""And I'm not a big tapas fan yet, I don't like sharing! But it's okay, I'll try to fit in as much as I can."" He is learning Spanish, with two-hour lessons on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Already he understands instructions on the pitch. ""Learning is difficult at first but it's essential, that's a given,"" Trippier said. ""You want to interact with everyone, from teammates to fans to staff, everyone at the club. I feel like I'm doing that already."" Atletico's beating heart is Diego Simeone, their coach who led the club to their first league title in 18 years in 2014 and who is remoulding this season, with new signings and an almost-entirely new defence too. Trippier puffs his cheeks. ""He's unbelievable,"" he says. ""The passion he has -- in games you see him celebrating tackles like goals -- it gives you such a lift. ""You can see over the years how strong Atletico have been, his teams have always looked like a family and I feel that now. ""It all comes from Cholo. I think he can take me to the next level. For a defender I don't think there's a better place in the world to be."" Atletico have won three games out of three so far and there is talk in Spain of the title. ""We've had a good start,"" Trippier says. ""We try not to listen to the noise outside."" But Trippier's own start has not gone unnoticed. He was recalled to the England squad on Thursday by Gareth Southgate, who had flown out to watch him play against Leganes four days earlier. ""I texted him to say thanks for coming out to watch me and for the support,"" said Trippier. ""It meant a lot to know I'm still in his thinking."" But he never feared moving abroad might harm his international career. ""I'm working with one of the best coaches in the world,"" he said. ""And Atletico is one of the biggest teams in Europe. I'm not taking a step down, I'm taking a step up."" He was dropped in May before the Nations League finals after a poor season for Tottenham that was all the more surprising given his superb showing at last year's World Cup. ""Injuries played a big part but I've got no excuses for last season,"" Trippier said. ""I just struggled for fitness and sometimes I was a bit selfish in that even when I was injured I played when I should have taken a step back to get fit. ""But you learn from your mistakes and I'm feeling fresh now for the new season."" He says his relationship with Mauricio Pochettino remains strong. ""I have a lot to be grateful to him for,"" Trippier said. ""At the end we had a great talk about coming here. He spoke very highly of Cholo, of Spain and living here in Madrid. He wished me nothing but the best. We left on very positive terms."" For Trippier, a brave decision for a fresh start. In his words, no regrets."
90,01/09/2019,21:51,Felix on target as Atleti beat Eibar to go five points clear of Barca,Joao Felix scored his first goal for Atletico Madrid as Diego Simeone's side came back from two goals down to beat Eibar 3-2 on Sunday.,"Thomas Partey's 90th-minute winner at the Wanda Metropolitano means Atletico have won all of their opening three La Liga games and move five points clear of Barcelona. Eibar looked set to pull off an upset when Charles and Anaitz Arbilla put them two in front inside 20 minutes. But Felix, who joined from Benfica for 126 million euros ($136 million) in July, tucked in Costa's cut-back before Vitolo equalised and Thomas completed the turnaround with a brilliant late finish. Simeone celebrated by leaning back, pumping his firsts and roaring towards the crowd, with belief growing that Atletico can beat both Barca and Real Madrid to the title this season. Felix could be key and the 19-year-old will be glad to have got off the mark, his partnership with the returning Diego Costa also offering room for encouragement. Yet Atletico, who had not let in a goal in either of their opening two matches, conceded twice in 19 minutes, the first time that has ever happened in a league match at home under Simeone. First, Pedro Leon pulled back for Fabian Orellana to cross and Charles drifted behind Jose Gimenez to head Eibar into the lead. Costa fluffed a finish from six yards after good work by Renan Lodi down the left before Eibar made it two. Atletico were guilty of poor defending, three times failing to clear, and then bad luck, as Arbilla's shot took a cruel deflection off Marcos Llorente on its way in. They hit back before half-time through Felix, even if it was Costa that did most of the work. He powered through and when his pace slowed, his strength took over, barging Sergio Alvarez out of the way before squaring for Felix. Atletico ended the half the stronger and equalised seven minutes after the restart. The move began with the crowd yelling at an unknowing Gimenez to turn for a pass from Jan Oblak and ended with the impressive Lodi playing in Vitolo, who poked past Marko Dmitrovic. With the majority of the half to play, Atletico would have fancied a winner but twice Costa had goals ruled out for offside and they had to wait until the 90th minute for it to come. Saul's deflected pass was collected by the heel of Thomas, who then nicked the ball ahead of Ivan Ramis. All that was left was to smash it into the net."

92,25/08/2019,21:10,Sub Vitolo strikes as Atletico win again,"Atletico Madrid maintained their perfect start in La Liga with another 1-0 victory on Sunday, this time over Leganes as Vitolo came off the bench to score a second-half winner at Butarque.","After beating Getafe last weekend by the same scoreline, Atletico have begun the season in familiar fashion, with efficiency trumping invention despite an ambitious set of summer signings. But two wins out of two already puts them ahead of Barcelona, who have lost to Athletic Bilbao and play Real Betis later on Sunday, and Real Madrid, who were held by Real Valladolid on Saturday. Joao Felix, Atletico's 126 million-euro ($140 million) signing from Benfica and much-hailed replacement for Antoine Griezmann, was, like last week, rather quiet but, like last week, delivered the match's defining moment. The 19-year-old's perfectly-timed pass provided the assist for Vitolo while Felix had been picked out by Kieran Trippier, who was faultless again on his second Atletico start. Leganes did hit the post at 0-0 with a free-kick from Jonathan Silva but lacked the cutting edge required to avoid a second consecutive defeat, after their opening loss at home to Osasuna. Atletico enjoyed most of the ball in the first half but never really clicked in the final third, where Alvaro Morata and Felix looked like two strikers still finding each other's rhythm. Every time Felix got the ball he was crowded out, his positioning too fixed and running too predictable, allowing Leganes to swarm around and mark him out of the game. They were alert as well to Trippier, shutting down the full-back's ability to cross even if one superb ball over the top put Morata in behind but he was unable to bring it down. Both teams began the second half with added fervour as Felix volleyed over after Kenneth Omeruo was caught napping and Roberto Rosales almost scored an own-goal, his diving defensive header coming back off the post. In between, Leganes hit the woodwork at the right end too, with Silva's free-kick drifting just away from the top corner before a scramble in the area allowed Javi Eraso to shoot but straight at Jan Oblak. The game was in the balance with 20 minutes left but Simeone brought Vitolo on for Mario Hermoso and the change paid off. Trippier started it with a ball down the right wing to Felix, whose beautifully timed pass inside found the run of Vitolo, who tucked it into the corner. Morata might have made it two but after weaving through, his finish was blocked by the leg of Juan Soriano. Leganes searched for an equaliser as Eraso failed to meet a header before Soriano went up for a corner in injury-time. Atletico held on."
93,23/08/2019,02:30,Troubled Barcelona look to Messi for inspiration,Lionel Messi could be ready to play against Real Betis on Sunday and Barcelona could do with him back.,"In other circumstances, Messi might have left it another week, having missed the whole of pre-season with a calf injury he sustained in his first training session back. But after re-joining his team-mates on Wednesday, the temptation will be to put Messi straight to work, to lift the mood and minimise the chances of what would be a disastrous second slip in La Liga. One defeat, by Athletic Bilbao inside a bouncing San Mames on the opening night and inflicted by a freakishly brilliant bicycle kick in the 89th minute, might ordinarily have been accepted as a blip. ""San Mames is always a difficult place to play,"" said Gerard Pique. ""When you're not at your best, they make you look stupid."" Yet memories of Barcelona's capitulation in May remain fresh. The humiliation in the Champions League and submission in the final of the Copa del Rey mean this team and, in particular, their coach begin the season very much on the back foot. Ernesto Valverde is never far from blame, suspicion about his style and suitability always bubbling under the surface, despite the fact he is hoping to become the first Barca coach since Pep Guardiola to win three La Liga titles in a row. When Messi tweaked his calf, it was assumed an attacking roster of Luis Suarez, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele would cope. Instead, Suarez and Dembele both picked up strains against Bilbao while Griezmann delivered the sort of hesitant display to suggest he may also need time to adapt. ""This league is hard,"" Griezmann said. ""We have to bounce back."" Another muscle injury for Dembele, his fifth in two years at Barcelona, is a concern, especially after the 22-year-old reportedly took time off in France instead of undergoing medical tests. It all means Messi's return carries added urgency, even if it remains more likely the Argentinian will come off the bench at Camp Nou than be named in the starting line-up. The lure of Neymar also grows, even if Barcelona are yet to agree a deal with Paris Saint-Germain. The prospect of Real Madrid jumping in too, surely plays on the mind of president Josep Maria Bartomeu. Coming into the season, it was Madrid with the darker clouds hanging over them after a poor pre-season left some wondering whether Zinedine Zidane, more than Valverde, would soon be feeling the heat. Instead, a retro-looking side, without a single summer signing, and with Gareth Bale, opened up last weekend with an assertive 3-1 win away at Celta Vigo. ""We had difficulties in pre-season with our results but not our work,"" Zidane said. ""It was essential to start this way, by playing well and winning."" Bale was excellent and with Eden Hazard not expected back until after the international break, the Welshman should continue his reintegration against Real Valladolid on Saturday. ""We have to turn over a new leaf,"" said Sergio Ramos. ""We can't regret or celebrate what's happened before. We start from scratch."" Atletico Madrid made a winning start too, at home to Getafe, even if a slightly nervy 1-0 win felt rather familiar, despite a handful of attacking signings this summer, including the hugely talented Joao Felix. Still, Getafe were arguably the toughest opponent to break down last season. Atletico might have more joy on Saturday away at Leganes. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
94,19/08/2019,00:15,Trippier and Morata combine to give Atletico winning start,Alvaro Morata headed in a sumptuous Kieran Trippier cross to ensure a new-look Atletico Madrid beat Getafe 1-0 on Sunday and made a winning start in La Liga.,"Trippier looked right at home at the Wanda Metropolitano when his bending ball was nodded in by Morata before two red cards in four minutes, one for each team, made it 10 against 10 before half-time. Getafe striker Jorge Molina and Atletico left-back Renan Lodi were the players sent off and then Morata missed a penalty, earned after a mesmeric run from Joao Felix, Atletico's 126 million euro signing from Benfica. It was enough for Felix to depart to a standing ovation and Atletico held on, even if this was perhaps not the statement opening to the season that Diego Simeone might have hoped for. After losing Antoine Griezmann to Barcelona, Atletico have spent close to 250 million euros this summer, just over half of that on Felix, whose electric run lit up an otherwise rather disjointed contest. The 19-year-old is supposed to be the heartbeat not only of a new team but a different style too, one that is more attractive to watch and that could even pip Barcelona and Real Madrid to the title. But Getafe were stubborn opponents, showing again why they finished fifth last season, only narrowly missing out on a place in the Champions League to Valencia on the final day. Felix aside, Atletico's other debutants impressed, including Lodi, before he was sent off, and Trippier, the first Englishman to play for Atletico since the Spanish Civil War and 20th in the history of the Spanish top flight. The former Tottenham defender's pin-point cross was the highlight of a confident performance that earned regular praise from the home fans. The early signs were encouraging as Trippier and Lodi pushed high and wide, like wingers, and the former almost played Koke in with a superb first-time pass. Felix showed some nice touches and his team-mates were quick to protest on his behalf after Leandro Cabrera barged him over. Trippier was the team's best outlet and Atletico might have scored had he managed to pick out either Felix or Morata in the middle after a brilliant pass from Saul Niguez. He had another chance moments later though and this time Trippier was more precise. A bending cross from the right allowed Morata to head in and Trippier enjoyed the celebrations, rousing the crowd on his way back and accepting a huge roar in return. Getafe had struggled to find a way into the match but two red cards in four minutes threatened to shift the balance. First, referee Cuadra Fernandez turned a yellow card into a red for Molina after consulting VAR, the striker catching Thomas Partey late down the back of his heel. Then Lodi was handed a second yellow for planting his hand in the face of Damian Suarez. Atletico dropped Saul into left back before Felix was sacrificed later in the second half, Mario Hermoso coming on for his debut where Lodi had started. But not before Felix produced the most exhiliarating moment of the match, for which an otherwise rather muted debut will be remembered. Collecting the ball in his own half, he slid past one Getafe opponent, nutmegged another and then weaved through two more. After motoring 30 yards, he was finally brought down by Bruno for a penalty, the fans cheering as if they had seen a goal. It should have been worth one but Morata's shot was pushed wide by David Soria and Getafe remained in touch. Getafe kept it close and Morata should have made it two when sent through in injury-time. One was enough."
95,13/08/2019,15:49,Costa to pay 1.7 million euros,"Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa has agreed to pay 1.7 million euros ($1.9 million) to Spain's tax agency which was investigating him for non-payment of taxes on image rights, a Spanish newspaper reported Tuesday.","The agency said the 30-year-old hid income earned in 2014 from a sponsorship deal signed with Adidas shortly before he joined Chelsea from Atletico that year. Costa, who has both Brazilian and Spanish citizenship, returned to Atletico in 2018. Under a deal with Spain's tax office, Costa will plead guilty to tax evasion and pay 1.1 million euros in back taxes, daily newspaper El Mundo, reported. He will also be sentenced to six months in jail but will not serve time and instead pay a fine of 600,000 euros, the paper said. The agreement will be made official at a Madrid court on October 4, El Mundo reported. Contacted by AFP, a spokesman for the tax office, said he could not comment on individual tax files. Costa is the latest famous footballers to have fallen foul of Spain's tax authorities. A Spanish court in January handed Portuguese striker Cristiano Ronaldo a suspended two-year prison sentence for committing tax fraud when he was at Real Madrid. The player, who joined Italian side Juventus last year, also agreed to pay 18.8 million euros in fines and back taxes to settle the case, according to judicial sources. Barcelona's Lionel Messi paid a two-million-euro fine in 2016 in his own tax wrangle and received a 21-month jail term. The prison sentence was later reduced to a further fine of 252,000 euros, equivalent to 400 euros per day of the original term."

Brazilian right-back Danilo, who joined Juve on Wednesday, came off the bench to make his debut. Two of Maurizio Sarri's other summer signings in Adrien Rabiot and Matthijs de Ligt started the fixture in Stockholm as did Cristiano Ronaldo but former Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey remains sidelined with a thigh issue. Juve begin their Scudetto title defence at Parma on August 24 and Atleti start their La Liga campaign next Sunday at home to Getafe."
97,01/08/2019,10:22,Atletico Madrid blanks MLS All-Stars,Portuguese teen sensation Joao Felix came off the bench to score a superb goal Wednesday as Atletico Madrid blanked the Major League Soccer All-Stars 3-0 at rain-soaked Exploria Stadium.,"Marcos Llorente, signed from city rivals Real this summer for $42 million, had put the Spanish side ahead in the first half before 19 year-old, $134 million striker Felix scored a brilliant second to decide a match that failed to spark into action, a swathe of changes on both teams contributing to a decidedly low-tempo affair. Diego Costa's late third was no more than the visitors deserved. Los Angeles Galaxy star Zlatan Ibrahimovic was withdrawn after just 30 minutes and despite Wayne Rooney's best efforts in the first half, it was the La Liga side that was far superior. ""I haven't seen too much of Joao Felix but... he looks like he has good technique,"" Rooney told AFP. ""I'm sure he will be a good player for Atletico in the near future."" The Spanish side spent plenty of money betting Rooney is right. ""Of course it's a big price to pay for such a young player but that's the way the market is going now,"" Rooney told AFP. ""Everyone is spending a lot of money. ""I remember a few years ago, Zinedine Zidane went for over $60 million and everyone was saying 'What's going on?' But that's the price you have to pay now."" Madrid manager Diego Simeone refused to single out any of his new players, including Felix. ""I've been pleased with all the new signings and the path we are going on during this pre-season,"" Simeone said. Inclement weather in the Orlando area delayed kickoff before a sellout crowd for 40 minutes but the rain failed to dampen an excellent atmosphere for the North American league's annual exhibition match. The MLS All-Stars, captained by leading scorer Carlos Vela of LAFC, boasted the likes of DC United's Rooney, Ibrahimovic and home favorite Nani in their starting line-up. Rooney, the former Manchester United and England forward, was operating in a deep lying midfield role and saw plenty of the ball in the opening stages without being able to penetrate the Spanish team's defense. Atletico created the first real opportunity, Rodrigo Riquelme firing high and wide on 17 minutes following good work from Vitolo, while Rooney saw a brilliantly struck effort from 30 yards whistle just over the bar. Ibrahimovic, who had barely touched the ball, was withdrawn on 30 minutes, much to the disappointment of the 25,527 spectators who hoped to see the mercurial Swedish superstar in the action. Atletico's opening goal on 43 minutes was a superb team effort, Riquelme brilliantly back flicking the ball to Llorente, who drove the ball past Philadelphia Union goalkeeper Andre Blake. James O'Connor, the Orlando City coach in charge of the All-Stars, completely changed his team at half-time, including withdrawing Rooney and Nani. It was one of the substitutes, Diego Rossi, who almost equalized when his close-range effort hit the side netting before Nicolas Lodeiro was denied by Atleti keeper Antonio Adan. On 55 minutes, Simeone shuffled his pack by making seven changes of his own including introducing Felix, who was signed from Benfica this summer, and his superb long range effort in the 84th minute sealed a comprehensive victory. Costa made it three at the death from close range."
98,29/07/2019,22:53,Schweinsteiger aims to show 'best of MLS' against Atletico,Bastian Schweinsteiger hopes Atletico Madrid's final game of their US tour won't descend into a flurry of mayhem and red cards when the MLS All-Stars take on Diego Simeone's team on Wednesday.,"Atletico's 7-3 win over Real Madrid in New Jersey on Friday saw both La Liga clubs reduced to 10 men in an unusually highly charged pre-season encounter. Atleti continue their preparations for the forthcoming La Liga season when they take on the best of Major League Soccer in Orlando, with a near sell-out crowd of 25,000 expected at Exploria Stadium. German World Cup winner Schweinsteiger, who plays in MLS for Chicago Fire, believes Simeone's side were fired by the presence of Los Blancos and is adamant his team-mates, coached by Orlando City's James O'Connor, can prosper without kicking lumps out of the opposition. ""Intense games are always good but the other night I am sure the rivalry between the teams also played a part,"" Schweinsteiger, the former Bayern Munich and Manchester United midfielder, told AFP. ""I think this will be different -- we don't want to hurt anyone, we just want to play our way and we want to show what is the best of MLS."" The All-Star game in MLS, like those in the NBA and Major League Baseball, is designed as a mid-season exhibition respite. Although with Simeone preparing for a strong challenge in La Liga and the Champions League, the Spaniards -- who have spent upwards of 219 million euros ($240 million) this summer following the departures of Antoine Griezmann, Lucas Hernandez and Rodri -- will be very competitive. ""I like this All-Star concept a lot, you play with the best players in the league, have a different coach -- this one is Irish -- and we are playing against a top team from Europe so will be a good test,"" Schweinsteiger said. ""They have invested a lot of money in new players, they are very strong, very tough and they have a very good coach. It won't be easy but if we show our quality we can definitely compete. ""Their approach is dictated by Simeone. He's done an amazing job over the last five years and they have become one the top teams in Europe. That's why it will be interesting."" Atletico, who take their tour to Mexico at the weekend, remain angry with Barcelona over the sale of French star Antoine Griezmann, whose 120 million euro ($135 million transfer was contested by Atleti. Discussions between the two Spanish giants are on-going, but Simeone refused to be drawn into a war of words with his recently departed striker. ""I value the performance from him,"" the Argentine told AFP. ""He has answered everything on the field and wish him nothing but the best at Barcelona. And that is it."" With Griezmann gone, the focus now is on Portuguese wonderkid Joao Felix who was signed earlier this summer from Benfica for 126 million euros ($142 million). Compatriot Nani, who will play for the MLS All-Stars at his home ground on Wednesday, predicts a bright future for the 19 year-old midfielder who impressed in the previous match against Real. ""He has been showing his potential to be a future star for Portugal, he had a great season with Benfica last year but he is still young,"" the former Manchester United midfielder said.

""We started the game very poorly. In a top-level match such as this, we had a very bad start, Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said. ""The players are well aware and they're disappointed. ""We don't need to dwell on it, this is a pre-season game. They were better in every respect and that's all there is to it."" The first meeting outside of Europe between the Madrid rivals proved a dismal night for Zidane's Real Madrid, who saw Serbian starlet Luka Jovic hobble off after an awkward collision with Atletico keeper Jan Oblak in the 24th minute. Zidane can only hope the news on his injury will be better than that on Marco Asensio, who could miss most if not all of the La Liga season after rupturing a knee ligament against Arsenal on Tuesday. Portuguese 19-year-old Joao Felix, signed from Benfica this month for 126 million euros ($142 million), scored his first goal for Atletico, and helped set up two more. Angel Correa also scored for Atletico, who had run the score to 5-0 at halftime and 6-0 before Real Madrid got one on the scoreboard before a packed house at the East Rutherford, New Jersey, home of the NFL's New York Jets and New York Giants. Costa set the tone in the first minute. Put through in the area by Felix he fired across his body to make it 1-0. Felix struck in the eighth, slotting home a ball that was cut back to him by Saul Niguez. Real Madrid keeper Thibaut Courtois could only watch Correa's 19th-minute blast into the bottom left corner. Costa bagged his second to make it 4-0 in the 28th, Saul winning the ball after a poor pass from Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos and sending a pass for Costa. Costa made it 5-0 on the stroke of halftime, converting from the penalty spot after he was brought down in the area by Isco. Atletico's lead swelled to 6-0 in the 51st minute when Costa teamed with Felix for his fourth of the night, Felix slotting a pass through Real Madrid's defence for Costa to arc over Keylor Navas. Eden Hazard helped Real Madrid pull back a goal in the 59th with a cross that Nacho bundled over the line. Minutes later Daniel Carvajal's late challenge on Thomas Lemar saw tempers flare, with both Costa and Carvajal sent off. Undeterred, Atletico grabbed their seventh goal in the 70th thanks' to a superb solo run by Vitolo, who seized the ball from two defenders and beat two more to score. Karim Benzema converted an 85th-minute penalty and Javi Hernandez scored in the 89th to trim the deficit, but there was little for Real Madrid to be proud of. ""I'm not concerned, but I'm hurt. You don't play to lose. But we can't be looking backwards, it was a bad game and now we have to focus on what went wrong so we can try and make sure it doesn't happen again,"" said Zidane. Welsh star Gareth Bale -- reportedly on the verge of a lucrative move to Chinese Super League outfit Jiangsu Suning -- was sent on with less than half an hour remaining but couldn't provide a spark."

Both men said they were ""very excited."" Espanyol said Atletico had paid close to 25 millions euros for Hermoso with four million in ""easily reached"" add ons and a 20 per cent cut of any future transfer fee. Atletico said the 24-year-old had signed a five-year deal. Hermoso is from Madrid and came through the youth system at neighbours Real. He played 59 games for Espanyol over the last two seasons, scoring four goals. He has played three times for Spain. ""When I had the opportunity to come here, I didn't even have to think about it, it's an opportunity that allows me to continue growing as a footballer,"" Hermoso said. Atletico lost veteran centre back Diego Godin to Inter Milan after nine years this summer. ""Diego has been an emblem within the club,"" said Hermoso. Adding that he welcomed the challenge and was sure he ""would continue that tradition."" Trippier also said ""when Atletico showed interest I didn't think twice."" Trippier, who played for one Argentine coach, Mauricio Pochettino, at Tottenham, said he was eager to work for another, Diego Simeone, at Atletico. ""For me, he is one of the best coaches in the world and it's a privilege to work for him and I'm going to give him everything,"" Trippier said."

Trippier has played 16 times for England scoring one goal, direct from a free kick in the World Cup semi-final loss to Croatia last year. He joined Spurs from Burnley in 2015 and made 114 appearances for the London club. The signing continues an overhaul of the capital city outfit's backline. Defenders Diego Godin, Filipe Luis and Lucas Hernandez have left, while Brazilian pair Renan Lodi and Felipe has already signed. Coach Diego Simeone has also forked out 126 million euros for Portugese teenager Joao Felix this summer."
102,14/07/2019,21:35,Atletico outcry to Barcelona move 'is a pity',"French forward Antoine Griezmann said on Sunday that Atletico Madrid's angry response to his transfer to La Liga rivals Barcelona is ""a pity"".","Barcelona revealed on Friday they had paid the 28-year-old's 120-million-euro ($135 million) release clause to sign the World Cup winner on a five-year deal, prompting a furious response from Atletico who said the amount was ""insufficient"". ""Regarding Atletico, it's a pity. I went to see them on purpose so they would not be caught off guard and could prepare for the future,"" the player told a news conference as he was presented at the Camp Nou. ""We reached an agreement but finally it changed, it's like that, you have to accept it,"" he added when asked about Atletico's response. Shortly after the Catalans had announced the signing, Atletico complained Barcelona and Griezmann had negotiated the deal before the buy-out price dropped from 200 million euros at the start of July. ""Atletico Madrid believe that the termination of the contract took place before the end of last season,"" the club said, adding Griezmann had made it clear in his actions and words. Atletico had already ""begun appropriate procedures"" to defend their ""rights and legitimate interests"", the statement added. Spanish sports newspaper AS said on Saturday the capital city club will go to FIFA, the governing body of world football, to argue that Barcelona owe them more than the 120 million euros release clause deposited by a lawyer for Griezmann on Friday. The daily added Atletico want to have both Barcelona and Griezmann punished. Contacted by AFP on Saturday, the club refused to comment. Griezmann almost signed with Barcelona a year ago but instead opted in June 2018 to sign a new five-year deal at the Wanda Metropolitano, revealing the reasons why in an almost one-hour long documentary called ""The Decision"" made by a production company owned by Barcelona defender Gerard Pique. But in May 2019 he announced he would be leaving Atletico at the end of the season. Griezmann's five-year contract with Barcelona includes a buyout clause of 800 million euros. ""It's always hard to leave a home, a place where you felt comfortable, which is your family,"" he said. ""I only have admiration and respect for the club. I have given everything on the pitch from the beginning to the end of the season and I feel no shame,"" added Griezmann, who will wear the number 17 jersey for his new side. Griezmann scored 133 goals in 257 appearances for Atletico since he joined them in 2014 from Basque club Real Sociedad, who scouted the attacker when he was just 14. He helped Atletico lift the Europa League in 2018 and won the World Cup with France last year."

Friday's announcement brings to an end a dispute between the two clubs and Griezmann, who had long aimed to move to the Catalan giants. The 28-year-old failed to show up for his side's pre-season gathering on Sunday after he had announced in May he would be leaving the Wanda Metropolitano, even though he could not reveal his destination until his release clause dropped from 200 million euros to 120 million euros at the start of the month. Last week Atletico accused Barcelona and Griezmann of a ""lack of respect"" after the Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu revealed the two clubs had held talks about the former Real Sociedad forward. Atletico also claimed that Griezmann had told the club that he had struck a deal with Barcelona in March, just days before the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie with Juventus, which saw them dumped out by a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick after winning the first leg 2-0 in Madrid. Griezmann joined Atletico in 2014 and has scored 133 goals in 257 appearances, lifting the Europa League in 2018. He finished top scorer at Euro 2016 when France were beaten in the final on home soil by Portugal before helping to guide his team to World Cup triumph in Russia last year."

The 19-year-old, who joined Atletico last week in a deal worth 126 million euros ($142 million), is a potential replacement for the France striker who scored 133 goals in five seasons at the club. Griezmann has already said he will leave Atletico -- he is expected to join Barcelona when his release clause, which dropped to 120 million euros last week, is activated. Felix's transfer fee is a record for a Portuguese club and for Atletico Madrid and makes the teenager one of the five most expensive players in history. ""Regarding the amounts, as I have said, it is a question of the market and I don't understand anything about that,"" he said. Felix also downplayed comparisons with his teammate on the Portuguese national team, Cristiano Ronaldo who spent a decade at Real Madrid before joining Juventus in 2018. ""He is currently the best in the world, and possibly of all time. When he was with the national team he told me about Madrid and he said he liked it a lot, but I'm here to make my own story,"" he said. ""Cristiano is Cristiano and I want to be myself.""

The value of the deal eclipses the reported £60 million City paid Leicester for Algeria international Riyad Mahrez last year. ""I hope this year we get the same or more success as the last two years,"" said Rodri at joining City, who won a first ever domestic treble of trophies in England last season. ""For me it's a great opportunity. It's a great team with great players in every area of the pitch. I think Pep is the greatest coach in the world and that's what made me come. ""It's important for me. I want to learn and grow as a player. I am very young and have a lot of things to do. With his coaching, I am going grow here."" Rodri's departure will secure a considerable profit for Atletico, who spent 20 million euros last summer to re-sign him from Villarreal after he was released from their youth ranks as a youngster. He made 47 appearances for Atletico, scoring three goals, as Diego Simeone's men finished above Real Madrid in second in La Liga and won the UEFA Super Cup. In Rodri, City hope to have finally landed their long-term replacement for the influential Fernandinho.

""He works hard defensively, makes himself available to receive the ball and uses it well when in possession. ""He is a perfect fit for Pep Guardiola's team and we are confident he will be a success."" Rodri's composed style on the ball at the base of the midfield has earned comparisons to Barcelona and Spain midfielder Sergio Busquets, who was handed his debut at the Catalan giants by Guardiola. ""I think he has been the greatest defensive midfielder in last ten years for me, for Barca and Spanish national team,"" added Rodri. ""I saw him when he started when I was little and I am close to him (in style), but I also have other skills. I am also going to try to learn here from Fernandinho."" Rodri is City's second signing in two days after activating a buy-back clause of £5.3 million to re-sign Spanish left-back Angelino from PSV Eindhoven."

Atletico tweeted a video of the player in the Prado gallery in Madrid contemplating paintings by old masters, with the phrase, ""enormous talent"", before he turned and smiled at the camera with the caption: ""Welcome Joao Felix, pure talent."" Felix has reportedly signed a seven-year contract. He is a potential replacement for Antoine Griezmann who scored 133 goals in five seasons at the club. Atletico have already said the French striker is leaving. He is expected to join Barcelona when his release clause, which dropped to 120 million euros on Monday, is activated. The Felix signing came on a busy day for Atletico. Earlier on Wednesday, the club confirmed the signing of Mexican midfielder Hector Herrera from Porto while another midfielder, Rodrigo Hernandez, left Madrid for Manchester City for 70 million euros. Atletico had already bolstered their midfield with the addition of the 24-year-old Marcos Llorente, bought for 45 million euros from Real Madrid. Felix, a forward who can play on either flank or centrally, has enjoyed a breakthrough season at Benfica, scoring 20 goals in 43 games and helping the club win the Portugese league title. He also made his debut for Portugal earlier this month, starting alongside Cristiano Ronaldo in their Nations League semi-final win over Switzerland. He had been linked with a number of Europe's leading clubs including Manchester City, Manchester United and Juventus. Atletico coach Diego Simeone said in June that the Portuguese prodigy was in his sights. ""He's a young player,"" Simeone told Fox Sports Argentina. ""Historically, Atletico Madrid is a club that buys young players in order to develop and improve them... Like Griezmann, who when he arrived was not what he is today."" Felix becomes the most expensive Portuguese player in history, breaking the record of 105 million euros Juventus paid last summer for Ronaldo. Atletico's previous record signing was French midfielder Thomas Lemar who joined last year from Monaco for 72 million euros.

Atletico had already bolstered their midfield options with the addition of the 24-year-old Marcos Llorente, bought for 45 million euros from Real Madrid. Rodrigo's departure will secure a considerable profit too for Atletico, who spent around 20 million euros last summer to re-sign the 23-year-old from Villarreal. But another key player leaving means more upheaval for Diego Simeone and his team. Club captain Diego Godin has already joined Inter Milan while Lucas Hernandez has been sold to Bayern Munich. Antoine Griezmann and Juanfran have also bid farewell, with Griezmann expected to join Barcelona after his own release clause dropped to 120 million euros on Monday. City's previous club record signing was the £60 million they paid Leicester for Riyad Mahrez in 2018. Rodrigo has been tipped to succeed Sergio Busquets as Spain's leading defensive midfielder and will give Pep Guardiola a strong alternative to the 34-year-old Fernandinho next season."

The Benfica statement read: ""Atletico Madrid have presented a proposal for the definitive acquisition of......the player João Félix Sequeira, for an amount of 126,000,000 euros which is being analysed."" Felix has been linked with a number of Europe's leading clubs including Manchester City, Manchester United and Juventus.

""Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid have reached an agreement for the transfer of Marcos Llorente to our club, pending the player passing the relevant medical examination,"" an Atletico Madrid statement read. ""It is expected that after performing this medical examination, the midfielder will sign a contract that will commit him to our club for the next five seasons."" The signing of Llorente, reportedly for 40 million euros, would appear to increase the likelihood of a departure for Rodrigo, who is expected to choose City ahead of either Bayern Munich or remaining at Atleti. Rodrigo has a release clause set at 70 million euros, a figure that would secure a considerable profit for the club, given they signed the Spaniard for around 20 million euros from Villarreal only last summer. Llorente, meanwhile, could prove an astute replacement. He was never likely to dislodge the likes of Luka Modric, Toni Kroos or Casemiro at the Santigo Bernabeu but often impressed when given a chance and was named the team's man of the match in last season's Club World Cup final. Atletico said they had signed a player renowned as ""an excellent defensive pivot, with a well-known ability for anticipation and intuition to intercept opposition passes"". After joining Real Madrid's youth set-up aged 14, Llorente progressed through the ranks, making his first-team debut in 2015 before being loaned out to Alaves the following season. But he made only five La Liga starts under Zidane in 2017-18 and six last term, prompting him to consider a move away from the club he had called home for more than a decade. ""I was a child who, like so many others, dreamed of playing football,"" Llorente wrote on Twitter, with a picture of him holding the Club World Cup. ""I grew up and started dreaming about playing at Real Madrid. I learned and put everything aside to do it and my dream was fulfilled. ""But you can never stop working, no matter how much you succeed, nor stop dreaming, no matter how much some dreams come true. ""Today I leave Real Madrid, which has been my home since I was 14 years old. I leave with no regrets."""

Felix has been linked with a number of Europe's leading clubs including Manchester City, Manchester United and Juventus. Winning the race for his signature would come as a significant boost to Atletico, who are expecting to lose Antoine Griezmann this summer after the Frenchman said he is seeking a new challenge. Griezmann's release clause will decrease to 120 million euros on July 1, with his projected sale likely funding Atletico's sizeable bid for Felix. Griezmann is expected to join Barcelona.

Felipe has been drafted in to bolster the defence at Atletico who have lost their captain, the 33-year-old Uruguayan centre-back Diego Godin, who said he was quitting the club this summer after nine seasons. Porto announced in mid-March that they had agreed to sell another Brazilian central defender, Eder Militao, a 21-year-old with two international caps, to Real Madrid for 50 million euros."
118,22/05/2019,18:12,"Troubled Costa hit by ankle ligament injury, reveal Atletico",Atletico Madrid said on Wednesday that Diego Costa has suffered ankle ligament damage after the controversial Spain striker was stretchered off during their friendly with Beitar Jerusalem.,"Costa, 30, was carried off the field 24 minutes into Tuesday's 2-1 loss in Jerusalem, his first match since being slapped with an eight-match ban for insulting referee Gil Manzano during Atletico's 2-0 defeat to Barcelona early last month. ""Once our team returned to Madrid, Costa underwent an MRI scan at the Clinica Universidad de Navarra that revealed a grade II sprain to the external lateral ligament of the left ankle,"" the La Liga club said in a statement. Atletico, who had to play the last seven games of the season without Costa and finished second behind champions Barcelona, didn't say how long the striker would be out for but revealed Costa will undergo physiotherapy on Wednesday. The injury ends a tough season for the former Chelsea forward, having scored just twice in the league and his future at Atletico was put in doubt after he was banned. Last month reports in Spain also suggested Costa was the latest star to fall foul of the Spanish authorities for possible non-payment of taxes on image rights. Newspaper El Mundo reported authorities had accused Costa of fraud totalling 1.1 million euros ($1.28 million) related to taxes related to his image rights in 2014."
119,18/05/2019,15:45,Griezmann whistled as Atletico come back to draw with Levante,Antoine Griezmann was jeered during his last game for Atletico Madrid and Rodrigo might have scored his final goal for the club as they came from behind to draw 2-2 against Levante in La Liga on Saturday.,"Griezmann received whistles at the City of Valencia Stadium from the visiting fans, who were also heard chanting ""out, out, out"" before goals from Sergio Camello and Rodrigo ensured Atletico at least ended the season with a draw. Diego Simeone has dismissed fears of a mass exodus, despite both Diego Godin and Griezmann already announcing their departures, with the likes of Rodrigo, Juanfran and Filipe Luis all expected to follow. If this was to be their farewell outing for Atletico, it was an underwhelming finale as Levante, who only secured safety from relegation last weekend, claimed a deserved point. They might have been disappointed not to take all three after leading 2-0 at half-time thanks to goals from Erick Cabaco and Roger Marti before then playing against 10 men for the best part of 40 minutes after Angel Correa was sent off. But Atletico fought back, Rodrigo firing into the top corner before 18-year-old substitute Camello scored his first goal for the club, finishing at the back post. Griezmann was unable to add to his tally of 133 goals in 257 games across all competitions in what became a bitter end to his five successful seasons for the club. Godin was given a rousing goodbye ceremony at the Wanda Metropolitano last weekend but the timing of Griezmann's announcement, perhaps deliberately, meant he avoided a last meeting with the Atleti fans. But those that made the trip to Valencia were determined to make their displeasure known and it was noticeable that Griezmann made a swift exit after the final whistle. Camello, born in Madrid and a product of Atletico's academy, delivered a more positive message for the future and a timely reminder of Atletico's ability to endure in recent years, despite the departures of their biggest stars. Levante took the lead through a brilliant opener from Cabaco, who flicked in with the back of his heel after a header back from Ruben Vezo. Roger doubled the advantage shortly before half-time, intercepting a loose pass from Thomas Partey before skipping over Rodrigo and firing past Antonio Adan, who was standing in for the injured Jan Oblak. Atletico's task became more difficult when Correa was sent off for a petulant kick on Chema but Rodrigo gave them hope with a stunning strike into the top corner, before Koke's shot fell kindly for Camello at the back post."
120,15/05/2019,14:20,Griezmann exit leaves Atletico lost just as rivals get set to strengthen,Antoine Griezmann's decision to leave Atletico Madrid has plunged the club into chaos and fired the starting gun for a summer scramble among Europe's elite.,"Top scorer in each of his five seasons, Griezmann was the stardust of Atleti, offering spontaneity and craft in a team renowned for discipline and grit. But he grafted too, which is why he was the perfect fit. Griezmann would run and chase as much as he passed and shot, his willingness perhaps exceptional for one of the world's premium attackers, a class in which he now deservedly belongs. ""I said it last season and I'll say it again - Griezmann is the best player in the world,"" coach Diego Simeone said in October. In a team that creates more chances and gives him a greater chance of converting them, Griezmann is likely to deliver an even better return than his 129 goals for Atletico in 256 games. One more against Levante on Saturday will edge the Frenchman clear of Fernando Torres but Torres left a hero. Griezmann's exit will leave a bitter taste. ""The truth is it has been difficult to take this route but it's what I feel I need,"" Griezmann said in a video for the fans. He will be too late for a last outing in front of them at the Wanda Metropolitano, perhaps out of respect for Diego Godin, the godfather to his daughter, who was given a rousing farewell on Sunday after the club's final home game of the season. Perhaps Griezmann was wary too, unsure if he waved to the stands whether it would be waving hands he saw coming back. The hope was he would be playing there in the Champions League final on June 1, the dream of hoisting a European trophy on home turf a key factor in his decision to reject Barcelona last year. Godin would have led them out but, at 33, with his best years behind him, he goes with the blessing of the fans, a La Liga title, two Champions League finals, two Europa Leagues, three Super Cups and a Copa del Rey under his arm. Griezmann, five years younger, should be entering his prime, and departs with only one Europa League and a Super Cup. Worse, most suspect he is about to strengthen Barcelona. ""I think my best time is still to come,"" Griezmann said in December. ""I know I can get even better."" But his choice is a reflection on Atletico too, raising questions about their future under Simeone, who was there on Tuesday with chief executive Miguel Angel Gil Marin and sporting director Andrea Berta, when his star player said he needed something new. Two of Atletico's three outstanding players - Griezmann, Godin and Jan Oblak - are about to move. Oblak signed a new deal last month but it contains a release clause, reportedly set at 120 million euros, hardly an obstructive price for arguably the world's number one goalkeeper. Lucas Hernandez has already agreed to join Bayern Munich. Juanfran, Filipe Luis or Rodrigo could be next. Admiration for Simeone is unwavering among supporters but frustration simmers too over style and progress. Atletico sit 11 points behind Barcelona in La Liga, one year after the gap finished at 14. Griezmann's early decision at least allows time for what is Simeone's biggest rebuild since he took charge in 2011. He also begins it in a summer when Atletico's rivals are expected to respond to the success of the Premier League with spending sprees of their own. Neither Griezmann's rejection of Barcelona, nor the fans whistling him at Camp Nou, will deter the club from a fresh approach. There have been whistles there as well for their own Philippe Coutinho, whose future would become even more uncertain with Griezmann's arrival. A reduction in Griezmann's release clause from 200 million euros to 120 on July 1, means there is alo time for others to enter the bidding. Paris Saint-Germain are likely to offer the fiercest competition, particularly if they lay down a financial package Barca cannot match. Griezmann at PSG could in turn give encouragement to Real Madrid, whose president Florentino Perez retains a strong interest in both Kylian Mbappe and Neymar, each seen as the sort of statement signing to launch a glorious new era under Zinedine Zidane. Another is Paul Pogba, who Madrid might find easier to lure if United framed Griezmann as his replacement. For Atletico, the knocks could keep on coming."
121,14/05/2019,22:53,'I have taken the decision to leave Atletico' - Griezmann,"French striker Antoine Griezmann has told Atletico Madrid he will leave them in the close season, the Spanish club said on Twitter on Tuesday.","The 28-year-old Griezmann has a contract until 2023 with Atletico, but has a buy out clause of 120million euros ($134million) and has been the target of several approaches from La Liga rivals Barcelona. ""Antoine Griezmann has told the club he will not continue as a Rojiblanco (red and white, the club's colours) next season,"" the club said on Twitter. Within a few moments the player then posted a video explaining himself. ""After speaking with Cholo (club coach Diego Simeone), then with Miguel Angel and the people in the hierarchy of the club I wanted to speak with you, the fans, who have always given me a lot of love,"" said Griezmann, wearing a plain black t-shirt in front of a simple white background behind him. ""I wanted to tell you I have taken the decision to leave,"" said the French 2018 World Cup winner. ""I have had five wonderful seasons here and you will always be in my heart,"" said the affable forward known for doing dances from the video game Fortnite, when celebrating his goals. ""The truth is it has been difficult to take this route but it is what I feel I need and I would like to thank all of you for the love you have shown me during these five years."" With 133 goals in 252 games at Atletico the attacker has been ever-present and has rarely been unfit or injured. He was a Champions League runner up in 2016, losing to arch-rivals Real Madrid. In 2018 however Atletico beat Marseille in the Europa League final. Griezmann finished third for the Ballon d'Or in 2016, after France lost in the final to Portugal at the European Championships and was a huge presence as Les Bleus romped to a memorable World Cup win at Russia 2018 after which he also finished third for the Ballon d'Or."
122,10/05/2019,16:20,Palestinian football chief urges Atletico Madrid to cancel Jerusalem game,The head of the Palestinian Football Association has sent letters to the European and Spanish associations demanding Spanish football giants Atletico Madrid cancel a post-season friendly with an Israeli team in Jerusalem.,"Jibril Rajoub has also sent a letter to Atletico calling on them to scrap the planned May 21 game with Beitar Jerusalem, a controversial Israeli team. ""We are not against playing in Israel, but not in occupied Jerusalem,"" the letter said, according to a post on the football association's Facebook page late Thursday. He said there were many Atletico Madrid fans in the Palestinian territories who were shocked they would play against Beitar, who he labelled ""high level racists."" Israel considers all of Jerusalem its undivided capital but the Palestinians consider the eastern part of the city as the capital of their future state. The Teddy Stadium, where the game will be played, is in west Jerusalem. The complaint was reminiscent of a similar one ahead of the 2018 World Cup, when Argentina were due to play Israel in Jerusalem as part of their warm-up for the tournament. That game was eventually cancelled after pressure from pro-Palestinian campaigners, though Rajoub was sanctioned by FIFA for comments in which he called on fans to burn Argentinian star Lionel Messi's shirt. Beitar Jerusalem have a controversial history in Israel, being the only side to have never signed an Arab Muslim player. Beitar, whose fans have been known to chant ""Death to Arabs"" at matches, have of late been struggling to change their racist image."
123,07/05/2019,14:22,Tearful Godin confirms Atletico exit,Atletico Madrid captain Diego Godin announced on Tuesday that he will leave the club at the end of the season.,"Godin has been one of the best central defenders in the world under Atletico coach Diego Simeone, who attended an emotional press conference at the Wanda Metropolitano, along with several players and president Enrique Cerezo. The 33-year-old would not confirm his next club but indicated regret at not being able to agree a new contract. ""I'm nervous, even more than for a match,"" said a tearful Godin. ""These will be my final days at Atletico Madrid. I want to communicate all the love I have for this club, this shirt. ""I am Atletico, because this is not a club, it's a family and a way of life. It has been my home and it's very hard to say goodbye. I never imagined this moment would come and I am not prepared."" Godin has made 381 appearances for Atletico and remains a key figure in the team, but the Uruguayan has rejected offers to extend his contract, which expires on June 30. He is unlikely to be the last high-profile player to leave Atletico this summer. After a disappointing season, Lucas Hernandez has already agreed to join Bayern Munich, while uncertainty hangs over the futures of Filipe Luis, Juanfran, Thomas Partey, Saul Niguez and even Antoine Griezmann. ""In short, I am captain of the team and have been here many years,"" said Godin. ""We have not reached an agreement to continue so my time here is over. It has been the best of my career and my life."" Godin added: ""I would like to play here until I'm 40 but it's impossible. For me the priority has always been the club, the team, my teammates. ""But we could not reach an agreement so I have decided to leave. There's nothing more to it than that."" Since joining Atletico from Villarreal in 2010, Godin has won La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Europa League twice. He also reached the Champions League final in 2014 and 2016. Atletico lost both to Real Madrid. The timing of the announcement means Atletico's fans can bid Godin farewell at their last home game of the season, against Sevilla on Sunday. ""As a kid I dreamed of playing football, playing for Uruguay, playing in Europe and being a big player,"" Godin said. ""But I never thought I'd be at a stadium like this with the fans cheering my name. There is nothing better than that."""
124,04/05/2019,23:11,Under-strength Barca beaten by Celta,Barcelona rested all 11 players that started against Liverpool in the Champions League but paid the price on Saturday as they were beaten 2-0 by struggling Celta Vigo in La Liga.,"Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Philippe Coutinho were all among those left out ahead of the return at Anfield on Tuesday but Barca were not unscathed, after Ousmane Dembele hobbled off early in the first half. The club later confirmed Dembele sustained a hamstring injury and will undergo tests on Sunday but it seems unlikely the Frenchman will be fit to face Liverpool in the semi-final second leg. Dembele missed almost four months with a hamstring strain last season and suffered from problems in the same area in January and March, sitting out for another month each time. Defeat will hardly trouble Barcelona, who wrapped up their 26th La Liga title last weekend, but victory comes as a major boost for Celta, who move five points clear of the bottom three with two games left to play. Real Valladolid and Girona, both just beneath them, may feel disappointed by Ernesto Valverde's team selection, particularly given his side took six and four points off them respectively this season. The result also means Rayo Vallecano are relegated after they were thrashed 4-1 by Levante earlier on Saturday. Rayo needed Celta, the only team they could catch, to lose all three of their remaining matches. Barcelona will now quickly turn their attention back to Liverpool, who at the same time on Saturday were playing Newcastle in the Premier League, making only four changes to their own line-up from the side that lost 3-0 at Camp Nou on Wednesday. Liverpool won 3-2 but Mohamed Salah was stretchered off in the second half. Barca's changes created the strange spectacle of Celta giving a guard of honour to youngsters like Jean-Clair Todibo, Carles Alena, Moussa Wague and Riqui Puig before kick-off. Dembele lasted only six minutes and was replaced by Alex Collado, the 20-year-old midfielder thrown on for his first-team debut. Puig was perhaps the most impressive of the fledglings and he teed up Barca's best chance in the first half but Wague's shot was well saved by Ruben Blanco. Celta came on strong in the second 45 and thought they had taken the lead when Gustavo Cabral's header was palmed out by Jasper Cillessen to Nesto Araujo, who finished. Araujo was shown by VAR to have been a fraction offside. But Celta did not have long to wait. In the 67th minute, with Todibo off injured, Barca were briefly down to 10 and Maxi capitalised, brilliantly volleying in Ryad Boudebouz's cross in at the near post. There was still time for one more in the 88th minute as VAR spotted a handball by Wague in the area and Aspas converted to confirm a crucial win. Atletico Madrid had earlier missed the chance to ensure they finish above Real Madrid for a second consecutive year after they slipped to a surprise 3-0 defeat by Espanyol. Atletico needed only a point to guarantee second place in La Liga, with two games left to play, but Espanyol were deserving winners at the RCDE Stadium thanks to Diego Godin's own-goal and two strikes from Borja Iglesias, the second a penalty. ""The first goal changed the game, the second one made us worse,"" said Atleti coach Diego Simeone. ""Espanyol were deserving winners. They were better and they had more chances,"" he added. Real Madrid face Villarreal on Sunday but a third-place finish seems inevitable. To overtake their city rivals, Real will need to win all three of their remaining games and hope Atletico lose both of their last two."
125,04/05/2019,19:03,Bragging rights delayed as Atletico beaten by Espanyol,Atletico Madrid missed the chance to ensure they finish above Real Madrid for a second consecutive year on Saturday after slipping to a surprise 3-0 defeat by Espanyol.,"Atletico needed only a point to guarantee second place in La Liga, with two games left to play, but Espanyol were deserving winners at the RCDE Stadium thanks to Diego Godin's own-goal and two strikes from Borja Iglesias, the second a penalty. ""The first goal changed the game, the second one made us worse,"" said Atleti coach Diego Simeone. ""Espanyol were deserving winners. They were better and they had more chances,"" he added. The result means Barcelona, already champions, can move 12 points clear at the top of the table by beating Celta Vigo later on Saturday. Real Madrid face Villarreal on Sunday but a third-place finish seems inevitable for Zinedine Zidane's side. To overtake their city rivals, Real will need to win all three of their remaining games and hope Atletico lose both of their last two. Espanyol's victory is unlikely therefore to prevent Atleti finishing as Madrid's top club in La Liga for a third time in four years, fourth in six, but there was a lack of spark that has undermined Simeone's team too often this season. Just as concerning have been the defensive errors, which Espanyol exploited to the full. Godin slid the ball into his own net before Juanfran conceded a late penalty for a needless push. In between, Borja had nipped between Godin and Filipe Luis with ease. Like at Real, changes are expected at Atletico this summer but, unlike their neighbours, not all of them are likely to be within their control. Lucas Hernandez has already agreed to join Bayern Munich, while uncertainty hangs over the futures of Godin, Filipe, Juanfran, Saul Niguez and Antoine Griezmann. Jan Oblak has signed a new contract until 2023 but with a release clause included, reportedly set at 120 million euros. Alvaro Morata will hope to stay after enjoying a resurgence since joining on loan from Chelsea in January and he might have given Atletico an early lead against Espanyol but was unable to find the space from the angle. Instead, Espanyol took the lead at the end of the first half and while Godin turned it into his own net, it was Adria Pedrosa who made it. His driving run down the wing left Atletico's defence scrambling and his fired cross panicked Godin at the near post. Atletico hardly troubled their opponents, who doubled their lead shortly before the hour, Borja latching onto Oscar Melendo's pass before finishing impressively past Oblak. Oblak saved shots from Sergi Darder and Borja but Espanyol finally added a third after Juanfran knocked over Javi Puado in the 89th minute. Borja beat Oblak with the penalty. Earlier, Rayo Vallecano were thrashed 4-1 by Levante to leave them on the brink of relegation from the top flight. Rayo are now six points adrift of safety and can only catch Celta Vigo, who need just a point from their remaining three matches to survive."

The MLS All-Stars have an 8-4 with three drawn record against clubs from England, Mexico, Germany, Italy, Scotland and Spain. The only other appearance by a Spanish squad was when Real Madrid won 4-2 on penalties after a 1-1 draw with the MLS stars in 2017 at Chicago. ""The atmosphere in Orlando will be intense and memorable,"" MLS commissioner Don Garber said. ""Atletico de Madrid joins the list of the many prominent clubs in global soccer to play in our midseason showcase."" Atletico, the reigning Europa League champions, are second in the Spanish league. Their lineup includes Antoine Griezmann, the silver boot winner for 2018 FIFA World Cup champions France and a 2016 finalist for the FIFA Men's Player of the Year Award. ""Atletico de Madrid are proud to participate in our first Major League Soccer All-Star Game and battle the many great players of MLS,"" said club president Enrique Cerezo. ""The U.S. and Canada have always been important markets for our club and competing in the MLS All-Star Game is an excellent opportunity to connect with our fans in North America and reach out to new ones."""
127,27/04/2019,18:34,Atletico make Barca wait by squeezing past Valladolid,Barcelona were made to wait to retain their La Liga title on Saturday as closest challengers Atletico Madrid scraped past strugglers Real Valladolid 1-0 after surviving late VAR penalty drama.,"Ernesto Valverde's side would have been crowned champions for the eighth time in 11 seasons ahead of their home clash with Levante later had Atletico lost to relegation-threatened Valladolid, but Joaquin Fernandez's own goal was enough to seal the three points and delay the Barca title party. The win means Diego Simeone's Atletico are six points behind Barca, who now have to beat Levante at the Camp Nou later in order to take the title with three matches to spare before they host Liverpool in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals. Should Barca beat struggling Levante as expected, they will hold their nine-point lead over Atleti, who will no longer be able to overtake the Catalans thanks to their inferior head-to-head record. Valladolid meanwhile stay 17th, just one point and a place away from the relegation zone after a match they will feel they were unlucky to lose. Atletico were far from their intense best, and the first half was a drab affair enlivened by a few Valladolid pot shots and a fine save from Jordi Masip, who did well to tip away Antoine Griezmann's free-kick. However they upped their game early in the second half and got the breakthrough in the 66th minute when Fernandez launched himself at Saul Niguez's cross from the left and headed the ball past Masip into his own goal. That didn't stop Valladolid though, and the away side thought they would be given a chance to equalise from the spot with just four minutes left when Santiago Arias appeared to handle a cross, only for referee Mario Melero Lopez to give a corner following a long VAR check. They then forced saves from Jan Oblak before Fernando Calero hit the post with a header two minutes into stoppage time, but they couldn't make their late flurry count."
128,24/04/2019,21:33,Atletico edge five-goal thriller with Valencia to delay Barca celebrations,Atletico Madrid delayed Barcelona winning La Liga by a few days at least after Alvaro Morata and Antoine Griezmann each scored in a 3-2 victory over Valencia on Wednesday.,"Defeat at the Wanda Metropolitano would have crowned Barca kings of Spain for a 26th time in their history, with the Catalans now set to celebrate at their own Camp Nou on Saturday instead. A Barcelona win there over Levante will wrap up their fourth league triumph in five years and they could even be home and dry before kick-off, if Atletico fail to take a point at home to struggling Real Valladolid earlier in the day. Regardless, success for Ernesto Valverde's side is surely now only a matter of timing given Atletico remain nine points behind the leaders with four games left to play. Real Madrid, who visit Getafe on Thursday, are 16 adrift. If Getafe win, they will also move five points ahead of Valencia, whose chances of snatching fourth place and Champions League qualification would now appear remote. But there will be some satisfaction at least for Atletico in making Barcelona win it on their own terms while also avoiding the embarrassment of conceding the title with a loss in front of their home fans. Angel Correa's stunning strike in the 81st minute proved the winner after Valencia had fought back, Kevin Gameiro and a Dani Parejo penalty twice pulling them level after goals from Morata and Griezmann. Morata's early strike continued his excellent form since his move to Atletico in January, his finish at the back post taking his tally to six goals in 13 games for the club. Griezmann, meanwhile, back from suspension, now has 25 goals in all competitions this season, an impressive return, particularly in a side not renowned for its creativity. Atletico were ahead inside 10 minutes as Juanfran's cross met the outstretched foot of Morata at the back post. It was no less than they deserved for an aggressive opening but Valencia grew into the half and equalised shortly before half-time. Francis Coquelin's crossfield pass picked out Carlos Soler, who cushioned inside to Santi Mina. Mina flicked the ball brilliantly between Diego Godin and Stefan Savic before squaring to Gameiro, who had time to pick his spot. Atletico regrouped during the interval and were back in front four minutes after, Griezmann jumping ahead of Jose Gaya to nod in Thomas Lemar's cross. But Valencia came again and a chaotic contest took another twist when Gameiro's shot was shown by VAR to have been blocked by the arm of Saul Niguez. Parejo powered into the corner. The game was in the balance as Griezmann glanced a header wide before Correa, on as a substitute, provided the winning touch. Thomas Partey played into his feet but Correa did the rest, turning, twisting and then bending the ball inside Neto's left-hand post. Barca will have to wait."

Without Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa, who were both suspended, Diego Simeone's side looked set for a stalemate that would have given Real at least a sniff of second place. Instead Lemar, on as a substitute, tucked home at the back post to end Eibar's resistance and reduce the gap behind run-away leaders Barcelona to six points. Eibar have now won only once in their last eight games and stay 13th. Barca host Real Sociedad later on Saturday and it would take an incredible collapse for the Catalans to be caught. If they beat Real Sociedad, Alaves on Tuesday and Levante next weekend, an eighth league title in 11 years will be confirmed. But, in the same week that goalkeeper Jan Oblak signed a new contract, this victory comes as another boost to morale for Atletico, who have now won four out of their last five matches. Lemar's goal will have done his confidence no harm either, after a difficult debut season with Atleti, who paid 60 million euros to sign the Frenchman from Monaco last summer. Simeone will hope for more from the 23-year-old next term. Atletico created the only real chance of the first half and Angel Correa missed it, slid through by the busy Alvaro Morata only to see his finish saved by the feet of Marko Dmitrovic. Morata should have scored himself shortly after half-time but dragged his shot wide of the far post while Koke's long-range effort had to be palmed over. Sergi Enrich might have nicked it for Eibar had Diego Godin not intercepted at the front post and when Godin drew another excellent save from Dmitrovic after heading Koke's free-kick towards the corner, it seemed the hosts would hang on for a point. But Eibar's defence was caught too high with five minutes left as Morata threaded Koke through and he crossed to the back post, where Lemar was free to score the winner."

131,17/04/2019,15:51,Diego Costa suspected of tax fraud in Spain: report,"Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa is the latest star to fall foul of the Spanish authorities for possible non-payment of taxes on image rights, a Spanish newspaper reported on Wednesday.","""The tax administration accuses the Atletico striker of fraud totalling 1.1 million euros related to taxes related to his image rights in 2014,"" daily newspaper El Mundo reported. Contacted by AFP, a spokesman for the tax office refused to comment. saying he could not comment on ""specific taxpayer files"". Two football superstars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have already paid substantial fines in Spain for the same offence. A third star, Neymar, is reportedly being investigated in Spain over his taxes. The tax office suspects the 30-year-old Costa ""concealed income"" from a sponsorship deal he signed with Adidas shortly before he joined Chelsea from Atletico in 2014. Costa, who has both Brazilian and Spanish citizenship, returned to Atletico in 2018. Spanish public prosecutors must decide whether they will act on the tax office's suspicions and file a lawsuit against Costa, El Mundo added. The news comes a week after Costa was slapped with an eight-match ban by the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) for insulting and grabbing referee Gil Manzano during the first half of Atletico's 2-0 defeat to Barcelona on April 6. The ban means Costa will not play again this season as Atletico have been knocked out of the Copa del Rey as well as the Champions League. He is just one of several famous footballers who have fallen foul of Spain's tax authorities in recent years. A Spanish court in January handed Portuguese striker Ronaldo a suspended two-year prison sentence for committing tax fraud when he was at Real Madrid. The player, who joined Italian side Juventus last year, also agreed to pay 18.8 million euros in fines and back taxes to settle the case, according to judicial sources. Barcelona's Messi paid a two-million-euro fine in 2016 in his own tax wrangle and received a 21-month jail term. The prison sentence was later reduced to a further fine of 252,000 euros, equivalent to 400 euros per day of the original term."

""Jan Oblak has extended his contract with Atletico Madrid until June 30, 2023,"" a club statement read. ""The Slovenian player has signed his new contract that commits him to our club for four more seasons."" Oblak's previous contract contained a release clause of 100 million euros, which is likely to have been increased, rather than removed, in his new deal. According to reports in the Spanish press, the adjusted release clause will be 120 million euros. But the likelihood of Oblak leaving this summer is reduced. According to Atletico's statement, Oblak said he was ""very happy to sign a new contract and happy to be here."" Oblak added: ""I will always give my best to defend this shirt with everything I have and I will continue to work hard."" Oblak has played 203 matches for Atletico and kept an impressive 115 clean sheets. He was also named in the Champions League squad of the year for both the 2015-16 and 2016-17 seasons."

137,09/03/2019,21:33,Messi and Suarez lead Barca to Rayo victory,"Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez might have been rested but instead both played and scored as Barcelona came from behind to beat Rayo Vallecano on Saturday, ahead of their crunch Champions League second leg against Lyon.","Raul de Tomas' scintillating strike gave struggling Rayo a surprise lead at the Camp Nou but Messi converted a penalty and Suarez finished a brilliant passing move to seal a 3-1 win, after Gerard Pique had headed in an equaliser. When Barca kicked off, Atletico Madrid had just completed their own 1-0 victory over Leganes, although Diego Simeone was more cautious, resting Antoine Griezmann, Alvaro Morata and Saul Niguez, with Tuesday's trip to Juventus in mind. ""It is normal when there is an important game on Tuesday,"" said Simeone, who substituted Griezmann at half-time. ""He was not injured, he had just given all that he had to give."" There was always a risk that La Liga's top two might take their eye off the ball, given Barcelona's last 16-tie with Lyon hangs in the balance after a goalless draw in France, while Atletico hold a 2-0 lead over Juve but can expect an onslaught in Turin. ""We have a crucial match on Wednesday,"" Ernesto Valverde said. ""We know the importance it has for many reasons -- because of the opponent, the competition and because we have seen what has happened to other big teams already."" Yet both avoided slip-ups to leave Real Madrid even further adrift in La Liga before they play away at Real Valladolid on Sunday. Barca stay seven points clear of Atletico and, temporarily at least, move 15 ahead of Real. Even with a two-goal cushion for the final eight minutes, Ernesto Valverde kept Messi and Suarez on until the end, which may have surprised some, given he was accused of exhausting key players last season at the expense of success in Europe. Messi's appearance was his 443rd for Barcelona in La Liga, moving him ahead of Andres Iniesta and behind only Xavi Hernandez, on 505, in the club's all-time list. Samuel Umtiti started his second match in three months after recovering from a knee injury. ""Little by little he is reaching his level,"" said Valverde. But Philippe Coutinho was underwhelming again, despite being picked ahead of Ousmane Dembele. He poked an early chance wide after a Messi cross and De Tomas put Rayo in front soon after, driving at Pique before unleashing a sizzling shot past Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Pique headed one Messi free-kick wide and then another in at the near post, nipping in front of Rayo goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski to nod in his sixth goal of the season. Dembele came on for Arthur Melo at half-time and Coutinho dropped deeper, but it was right-back Nelson Semedo that earned the penalty, after a foul from Jordi Amat. Messi made no mistake. Rayo's belief, and energy, melted away and Barca's third was their best of the night. Suarez freed Dembele down the right and he found Suarez again with a pull-back. Instead of shooting, Suarez bounced the ball off Ivan Rakitic in the area before finally tapping home. There was nothing as free-flowing at the Wanda Metropolitano where perhaps the greatest show of creativity came from Leganes, whose players wore shirts with the name of their mothers on their backs to celebrate International Women's Day on Friday. The first half was almost entirely forgettable but despite the absence of attacking punch, Griezmann came off at half-time for Thomas Lemar, with no visible sign of an injury. Griezmann would have taken the penalty soon after, won by Angel Correa with some quick feet in the area, which lured Kenneth Omeruo into a clumsy challenge. Saul stepped up and missed, but tucked in the rebound after Andriy Lunin could only push the ball back into his path."
138,09/03/2019,00:32,Allegri warns of Champions League 'obsession' before Atletico showdown,Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri has warned against the Champions League becoming an obsession as his team desperately look to overturn a 2-0 deficit against Atletico Madrid in the last 16 second leg in Turin on Tuesday.,"Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo last summer for 100 million euros ($112 million) from Real Madrid in a bid to lift the trophy for the first time since 1996. But the 34-year-old Portuguese superstar has scored just one goal in this year's competition. ""I think expectations have been raised far too much and it has become an obsession,"" Allegri said of the elite European tournament. ""Playing in a game like the one on Tuesday should be a pleasure and a joy. If Juventus go out, it won't be a failure. ""Since I arrived, the Champions League has always been an objective, but if people say that it's a failure if Juventus go out, that is not right."" ""I find that laughable. If we go through, fine, but if not then it's just a football match and we'll try again. We've in theory already won two trophies this season. That is not a failure. ""We're heading for an eighth consecutive Scudetto and won the Italian Super Cup."" Allegri's side have lost two European finals in the past four seasons against Barcelona (3-1) in 2015 and Real Madrid (4-1) in 2017. ""Bayern Munich took 10 years to win the Champions League, while Chelsea only won it when they didn't deserve to (in 2012), as they were pinned back for most of that final,"" continued the Juventus coach. ""In my time, we always at least reached the last 16, got to the final twice and were eliminated only by the eventual winners. ""It's a different tournament to the others, as if a ball bounces badly, you don't have time to recover, you're already out."" ""The overall level in the Champions League has increased and on Tuesday we'll do our best. If we go through, then that's great, if not then we'll try again next year. ""I am very confident for Tuesday."" Allegri, 51, said he would like to continue with the Turin club beyond the summer. ""I left after four years at AC Milan, this is my fifth year at Juventus and I hope to continue. We'll see. The important thing is the work we did."" Moise Kean scored a brace as Juventus warmed up for next week's game against Atletico by easing past lowly Udinese 4-1 to up open a 19-point lead at the top of Serie A on Friday."

But the pressure is on the Juventus coach amid reports of a falling out with club chairman Andrea Agnelli after the club's first-leg 2-0 defeat in Spain two weeks ago. ""We have to win to prepare for the match on Tuesday, regardless of the advantage that we have (in the league),"" Allegri told a pre-match press conference on Thursday. ""We still need six victories (to win the title). ""The Madrid match has left us with motivation that has helped us in these 15 days. We will be ready on Tuesday and we will have a great game."" The Juventus coach confirmed he had also met with Agnelli to discuss his future. ""I met with the chairman yesterday for dinner, we are two intelligent people who have built something important in these five years together,"" said Allegri. ""We decided to talk about the renewal of the contract after the season."" The pressure has also been mounting on Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo to make the difference as the club's major objective of the season hangs by a thread in Turin next Tuesday. The top scorer in the Champions League for the last six seasons, Ronaldo was signed for 100 million euros ($112 million) last summer from Real Madrid. But the 34-year-old Portuguese superstar has scored just one goal in this year's competition as Juventus target a first European title since 1996. Ronaldo has also failed to score in his last two league games since the Madrid defeat and has been joined at the top of the Serie A scorers chart by Sampdoria veteran Fabio Quagliarella, 36, who has also scored 19 goals. Allegri confirmed that Ronaldo is available, but will start from the bench so as to be fully primed for what promises to be an epic struggle against the dogged Madrid outfit. Defenders Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini will not play on Friday either. Udinese are 15th in Serie A but have moved away from the drop zone after winning their last two Serie A games against relegation candidates Chievo and Bologna. The side from northeastern Italy also have a game in hand after their trip to Lazio was postponed. Carlo Ancelotti's Napoli travel to mid-table Sassuolo on Sunday looking to get back winning after last week's home defeat to Juventus. AC Milan, a further eight points behind in third, are targeting a fifth straight league win against bottom club Chievo. Gennaro Gattuso's side are a point above city rivals Inter, who lost 2-1 at Cagliari amid a public contract dispute with absent star striker Mauro Icardi. There are reports of ""a thaw"" between the Argentina striker, who has been stripped of the captain's armband, and club bosses after a meeting this week. Roma, meanwhile, turn their focus back to qualifying for next year's Champions League after crashing out 4-3 on aggregate after extra time amid VAR controversy at Porto midweek. Eusebio Di Francesco's side are fifth, three points behind Inter Milan who occupy the final Champions League berth, after falling 3-0 to city rivals Lazio last weekend. Last year's Champions League semi-finalists have a chance to pick themselves up against Empoli, who are three points above the drop zone, on Monday. ""Going out like this hurts,"" said Roma captain Daniele Di Rossi. ""Our focus is now on preparing for Empoli and then SPAL."" Fixtures (all times GMT)"

The city derby against Real Madrid in La Liga is scheduled for February 9. ""Koke has undergone medical tests at the University Clinic of Navarra due to some muscle problems during the game against Huesca,"" a club statement read. ""The tests have indicated that our player has suffered a grade 1 muscle injury on the anterior side of the right thigh.""

141,20/01/2019,09:10,Atletico shoot for football future in cricket-mad Pakistan,"Spain's Atletico Madrid are taking on a challenge tougher than winning La Liga -- developing football in cricket-mad Pakistan, where bat and ball are king, pitches come with stumps not goalposts, and even the prime minister is a former World Cup winner.","During a recent session at the club's new facility in Lahore -- the country's first European football academy -- a cabal of Spanish coaches watched as a new class of young Pakistani hopefuls fired off penalty kicks. ""We are not looking for players for Atletico Madrid because we know that this is going to be very difficult... Our target is to improve the football here,"" coach Javier Visea told AFP. To succeed in carving out a place for football, they will need to overcome marginal government support, poor infrastructure and a troubled history with FIFA that has resulted in multiple bans for violating the body's rules. The country remains on thin ice with the governing organisation, currently sits 199th in the FIFA rankings and has still never qualified for a football World Cup. Things weren't always so dire. The national squad boasted a top 10 place in Asian football until the 1970s. The sport remains widely watched by middle-class Pakistanis, and football video games like the FIFA franchise are as popular as ever. Those seeds of fandom are what Atletico hopes to nurture with their facility, which opened last September in the nation of over 200 million. ""We know cricket is the main sport,"" said Visea. ""But ... there are a lot of football fans, they are following (the) Premier League, they are following La Liga."" Atletico aims to promote football, health, and sports in general, he said -- along with their own brand in the vast untapped football market that is South Asia. And a promising future for football may not be as quixotic as it sounds. For decades, field hockey was the most popular sport in the country as Pakistan dominated international competitions and won four World Cup titles. The sport was only overshadowed by cricket with the rise of the dashing all-rounder, and now prime minister, Imran Khan -- culminating with the country's World Cup win in 1992 under Khan's leadership. Cricket has ruled the sporting roost ever since -- but the hope is that another strong personality with a winning streak in football could change everything again. Ten-year-old Fiza Shahid dreams of becoming a footballer like her heroes Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, practising in her backyard before joining Atletico's academy. As she sprinted down the new facility's pitch, her father Muhammad Shahid said he takes great pride in watching his daughter play the beautiful game in conservative Pakistan, where boys are more likely to be allowed to compete in sports than girls. Shahid, who is from a humble background and holds conservative religious beliefs, is a firm believer in his daughter's right to play. ""Both the sons and daughters have equal rights,"" he said. For 12-year-old Hussam Suhail the Atletico academy not only provides a place to emulate his idols but also a safe pitch to hone his skills. ""In the streets there are trees and cars coming, you can't play well, while here you can play very well without stopping,"" he said. The opening of the academy also comes as security has dramatically improved across Pakistan after years of militancy, paving the way for the gradual return of international sports. ""At the moment they asked us about coming here we were a little bit scared because all the news coming from Pakistan to Spain (is) not good news,"" said coach Daniel Limones. But things changed when he landed in Pakistan. ""We are feeling like if we are Spain, so there is no security issue or those things,"" he said."
142,17/01/2019,12:29,"Chelsea close in on Higuain loan, Morata set for Atletico - reports","Chelsea are set to add some much-needed firepower by reuniting manager Maurizio Sarri with Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuain, according to widespread reports on Thursday.","Higuain, 31, is halfway through a season-long loan at AC Milan from Juventus, with an option to make the deal permanent. However, Chelsea have reportedly reached an agreement with the Italian sides to bring Higuain on loan with the option to make the deal permanent or extend the loan for another 12 months at the end of the season. As a result of Higuain's arrival, Alvaro Morata is set to leave Chelsea to return to Spain at Atletico Madrid on loan. Higuain scored a record 36 Serie A goals under Sarri at Napoli before moving to Juventus in 2016 for then the third-highest transfer fee of all time in a 90 million euro move ($103 million). After winning two league titles with the Bianconeri, though, he was forced out by the signing of Cristiano Ronaldo in July. Milan paid 18 million euros to sign Higuain on loan, with a clause to make the deal permanent for a further 36 million euros. Yet he has struggled to settle at the San Siro, scoring eight goals in all competitions and was heavily criticised for a meltdown that saw him sent off in a 2-0 defeat to Juventus in November. Higuain only made a late appearance as a substitute when the sides met again, with Juventus 1-0 victors on Wednesday in the Italian Super Cup, which was held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Milan boss Gennaro Gattuso insisted Higuain had been suffering from a fever, but admitted earlier this week that the striker was determined to link up once more with Sarri. ""When a player makes up his mind it becomes hard to convince them otherwise,"" said Gattuso. Chelsea are badly in need of a centre-forward, with the form of the misfiring Morata and Olivier Giroud prompting Sarri to use Eden Hazard in an unfamiliar false nine role in recent weeks. Morata signed for a then club-record £60 million ($77 million) in July 2017 from Real Madrid, but after a bright start has become increasingly bereft of confidence over the past year. After two spells with Real, Morata is set to switch sides in the Spanish capital by joining Atletico, where he started his career as a youth team player."
143,16/01/2019,21:43,Atletico crash out of Copa del Rey after late show from Girona,Antoine Griezmann scored one and set up another but could not prevent Atletico Madrid tumbling out of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday as Girona progressed on away goals after a thrilling 3-3 draw.,"Griezmann came off the bench in the second half and turned the tie in Atletico's favour, teeing up Angel Correa and then scoring himself to give his team a 3-2 lead at a rocking Wanda Metropolitano. But Girona hit back one more time to go through to the quarter-finals as Seydou Doumbia's shot found the corner in the 88th minute, snatching a 4-4 draw on aggregate after last week's first leg finished 1-1. Griezmann had scored then too, and in between against Levante on Saturday. This was his eighth goal in as many matches. The Frenchman, however, had started on the bench while Atletico were punished for some uncharacteristically lacklustre defending. A sumptuous volley from Valery Fernandez and Cristhian Stuani's header put Girona in charge after Nikola Kalinic had put Atletico in front. Perhaps Diego Simeone had one eye on the Champions League tie against Juventus next month, not to mention his side's title challenge, which has them five points behind Barcelona and the Catalans' closest challengers in La Liga. But it is now six seasons since Atletico last reached the final of Spain's most prestigious cup competition, which represented their most likely source of a trophy this term. They had looked set for a comfortable night when Kalinic was allowed to drift in behind Girona's dozing defence in the 12th minute, let the ball bounce and drive in on the half-volley. Instead, Girona levelled thanks to a superb volley from Valery. The cross was flicked to the back post, where Valery cushioned the ball with his chest, before hammering it into the far corner. Correa struck the post after half-time, his shot squirming through the hands of a relieved Gorka Iraizoz, while Saul Niguez hobbled off, replaced by Rodrigo. Girona pulled ahead. Atletico were uncharacteristically generous in giving Stuani space at a free-kick and he nodded in Aleix Garcia's cross with ease. The ball had hit the net in the 59th minute and in the 61st, Griezmann entered the field. In the 65th, he set up a goal too, Kalinic letting the Frenchman's pass run but doing enough to distract Girona's defence. Correa nipped in and finished. With Girona still progressing on away goals, Atletico had just over 20 minutes to find a winner. Santiago Arias thought he had it but VAR showed him just offside. So did Griezmann, as he latched onto Thomas Lemar's scoped ball through and smashed it into the roof of the net. He celebrated like he had won the tie but there was one more sting in the tail. Borja Garcia raced clear down the right and his cutback landed at the feet of Doumbia. His shot flew through the legs of Arias and snuck into the corner."
144,16/01/2019,14:56,"Signing Hernandez this January 'unrealistic', say Bayern",Bayern Munich's sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic says Atletico Madrid defender Lucas Hernandez is unlikely to join the German champions this January as they look to replace their ageing squad with younger talent.,"Bayern, who trail Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund by six points, kick-off the second half of the German league season at Hoffenheim on Friday and have targeted Hernandez to beef up their defence in the future. ""We have had talks, which will continue, but whether he comes this winter is unrealistic,"" Salihamidzic told Wednesday's edition of magazine Sport Bild, with the transfer window to close in Germany at 1700 GMT on January 31. Hernandez, who won the World Cup with France last summer, has a market value of around 60 million euros ($68.3m). The 22-year-old, who can play left-back or centre-back, remains high on Bayern's wish list alongside Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi, 18. ""We want to sign the player and I am completely convinced of his skills -- we are in discussions with Chelsea,"" Salhamidzic said of Hudson-Odoi, but Bayern's approach for the English teenager annoyed Blues boss Maurizio Sarri, who last week branded the Bavarians ""unprofessional"". Bayern have already snapped up 18-year-old Canadian winger Alphonso Davies -- the most expensive Major League Soccer player following his $13 million (11.4m euros) arrival from Vancouver Whitecaps -- who could make his Bundesliga debut at Hoffenheim. Earlier this month, Bayern announced France defender Benjamin Pavard will join from Stuttgart on July 1, with German media valuing the transfer at 35 million euros for the 22-year-old who can play at right-back or centre-back."

A 1-0 victory for Diego Simeone's side cuts the gap from five points to two behind Barca, who will restore their advantage with a win over Eibar later on Sunday. Levante, who have not won in the league since December 3, stay 11th. Atletico had 19 shots and, unusually for them, dominated possession but they continue to rely on Griezmann's excellent scoring run for points. ""We all pull the cart in difficult moments,"" Griezmann said. ""I cannot do anything without my team-mates."" But, in their last five games, it is the Frenchman's goals that have earned wins over Levante, Real Valladolid and Espanyol, while sparing them defeats away to Sevilla and Girona. Griezmann was persistent in expressing his desire to win the Ballon d'Or in December but since the prize went to Real Madrid's Luka Modric, he has hit seven goals in seven games. Perhaps a sharpening of focus has done him good too. He could have scored early but feathered Angel Correa's cross wide while Koke thought he had, tucking Vitolo's pass neatly into the corner, only for VAR to find a foul in the build-up. In between, Stefan Savic sustained a thigh injury and was replaced by Jose Gimenez, who has himself only recently returned from a calf problem, with this his first league appearance since December 8. After a nervy start, Levante began to frustrate their opponents, whose poor decision-making in the final third had Simeone flailing on the touchline. It seemed likely the pressure would pay, however, and 12 minutes into the second half so it proved, as Thomas Partey's cutback struck the hand of Nikola Vukcevic, who had slid to block but left his arm outstretched behind his back. Griezmann banged the penalty into the roof of the net. Atletico could have made it more comfortable late on but Vitolo's shot whistled past the post, Partey powered over and Thomas Lemar found the angle too tight. One was just enough."
146,12/01/2019,17:16,Hernandez fit again for Atletico ahead of Levante test,Atletico Madrid have been delivered a defensive boost after Lucas Hernandez was declared fit to face Levante in La Liga on Sunday.,"The Frenchman has not played for Atletico since December 8 after injuring his knee in a match against Alaves. ""Lucas Hernandez has received this Saturday the medical discharge after the last training session of our team before the game this Sunday against Levante at the Wanda Metropolitano,"" a club statement read. Atletico sit second in the table, five points behind breakaway leaders Barcelona. ""Lucas will be in the squad, then we will decide (about the team),"" Diego Simeone added in a press conference. ""He's good, strong and hopefully back to the level he had when he left us. We need him."" Atletico have been hit by a number of absentees in recent weeks. They will still be without injured duo Diego Costa and Filipe Luis against Levante, as well as Saul Niguez, who is suspended. Simeone will also be hoping the club hold onto their star players this month. Goalkeeper Jan Oblak and Hernandez both have release clauses, reportedly set at around 100 and 80 million euros respectively, while Diego Godin's contract expires in the summer. Asked if he could be overridden by the club, Simeone said: ""It's normal, the club is above all of us. ""If the club improves, the team improves. So far we have gone hand in hand in the best way. We have grown with some players not arriving and with some others staying, but always the needs of the club are the priority."""
147,09/01/2019,21:37,Advantage Atletico after hard-fought draw against Girona,Antoine Griezmann helped Atletico Madrid edge towards the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday as they took a valuable away goal from a 1-1 draw with Girona.,"Griezmann's early shot squirmed its way in off both the crossbar and then goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz but Girona hit back before half-time through Anthony Lozano. Neither side could find a winner in a cagey contest at Montilivi but Atletico will be the happier, with the second leg at home still to come next week. Diego Simeone fielded a strong line-up that included Griezmann, Diego Godin, Koke, Saul Niguez and Thomas Lemar but goalkeeper Jan Oblak was left on the bench. Oblak's immense value was brought into focus by his stand-in, the 31-year-old Antonio Adan, offering a weak attempt at saving Lozano's equaliser. Atletico needed a heavy dose of fortune too as they took the lead after eight minutes. Nikola Kalinic cut the ball back to Griezmann on the edge of the area and he fired it first-time towards goal. Iraizoz did well to push it onto the crossbar but his effort drew scant reward as the ball cannoned down, off the diving goalkeeper and in. Girona were far from overawed, however, and pulled level shortly after the half-hour, Lozano's guided shot met only by a weak hand from Adan on its way into the far corner. Lozano could have had a second five minutes later but his flicked header struck the bar, while Atletico might have won it in the second half as Kalinic blazed over and his replacement, Vitolo, stung the hands of Iraizoz. Thomas Partey had arguably the best chance when Iraizoz rushed out, only to send his clearance straight to the midfielder. The goal was empty but Partey's long-range effort drifted wide."
148,06/01/2019,21:32,Madrid title hopes hanging by thread after shock loss to Real Sociedad,Real Madrid may not even challenge for the title let alone win it as a shock 2-0 defeat at home to Real Sociedad on Sunday left them even further adrift in La Liga.,"Barcelona, already seven points clear, could extend the gap over their fiercest rivals to 10 by beating Getafe later, while Atletico Madrid and Sevilla gained on the European champions too, despite playing out a 1-1 draw against each other. Antoine Griezmann's stunning free-kick earned Atletico a point at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. Madrid were reduced to 10 men in the second half after Lucas Vazquez was shown a second yellow card but by then they already trailed to Willian Jose's early penalty. Ruben Pardo wrapped up a brilliant victory for La Real, who had won this fixture only once in their last 22 attempts. This was their first victory at the Santiago Bernabeu since 2004 and then Madrid fired coach Carlos Queiroz a day later. Santiago Solari is not there yet, even if he was asked afterwards if he deserved to keep his job. ""We fight to win the next game,"" he said. The honeymoon period Solari enjoyed in November though after replacing Julen Lopetegui is well and truly over. This loss, coming after the draw away to Villarreal on Wednesday, means Madrid sit fifth, outside even the Champions League places. ""Everything went against us today,"" Solari said. ""We did everything we could but the ball just would not go in."" A stoney-faced Florentino Perez was among the 53,412 watching on, the club's second lowest attendance of the season. ""We will try to get them back,"" Solari said, before making a swift exit. Barcelona have won seven out of the last 10 La Liga titles and if they are to slip up in 2019, Atletico or Sevilla would seem the ones now able to take advantage. Gareth Bale was missing with a calf injury but it was the 18-year-old Vinicius Junior that came in, not Isco, who is yet to start a league game under Solari. La Real's penalty was awarded after 75 seconds and converted after 150. Mikel Merino ghosted past Sergio Ramos and inside Marcelo. Casemiro tried to cover but bundled Merino to the ground. Willian Jose went high and down the middle. Madrid poured forward, only to spurn a handful of chances before the break. Karim Benzema had the best of them, lashing wide with only Geronimo Rulli to beat. Rulli was not needed then but he would be, many times. He denied Vinicius, Benzema and Luka Modric in quick succession. Ramos wanted a penalty for a push in his back but the appeal was desperate. Vazquez clipped the post with a looping cross but that was not enough to hush the angry whistles at the end of the half. The second period was frantic, with chances at both ends. Vinicius and Raphael Varane, twice, failed to find a gap in a goalmouth scramble, while Vinicius played a neat one-two with Benzema but his shot sailed inches wide. La Real could have sealed it as Mikel Oyarzabal fired over from close range and the weaving Januzaj twice went close. Isco replaced Casemiro in the 57th minute and in the 61st Vazquez was sent off. A rash sliding challenge had earned him a yellow card towards the end of the first half and even if the chip at Merino's heels seemed harmless, he was foolish to take the risk. Down to 10, Madrid still pushed and had a more convincing penaty appeal when Vinicius tumbled over the arm of Rulli. Referee Jose Munuera stood firm. Januzaj should have wrapped it up when his shot was saved by the legs of Thibaut Courtois but Pardo did, heading in a cross from Willian Jose, who could have made it three in injury time. Defeat made Griezmann's free-kick seem all the more valuable as the Frenchman's fifth goal in as many games earned Atletico a point away to Sevilla. Sevilla would have leapfrogged Atletico into second with a win and took the lead when Wissam Ben Yedder fired home on the turn. Griezmann, however, intervened, whipping a superb shot across the rooted Jan Oblak and into the top right-hand corner."
149,20/11/2018,19:19,"Costa back fit, Godin unavailable for Barca clash",Striker Diego Costa returned to training on Tuesday but defender Diego Godin will miss Atletico Madrid's top-of-the-table clash with Barcelona this weekend.,"Former Chelsea forward Costa has been suffering from a foot injury which kept him out Spain's recent fixtures against Croatia and Bosnia, but photos on the club's website showed him training. Uruguayan Godin has a problem with his thigh and the 124-time capped international missed his country's friendlies against Brazil and France. ""I know what I have, I know myself, I know my body, it is a tear that will take a few weeks, 20 days or a month,"" Godin told Marca. Left-back Lucas Hernandez is fit for the fixture between table-topping Barca and third-placed Atletico but central defender Jose Maria Gimenez is a doubt to face the La Liga champions. Coach Diego Simeone faces a selection headache at the heart of his defence with Montenegro's Stefan Savic also out with a calf issue. Simeone admitted he would have to call up Atletico B teenager Francisco Montero or move Saul Niguez from his usual position in central midfield. ""It is possible that Montero will play while there is also the chance that Saul will play at centre-half which he has done in several games,"" the Argentinian boss said. The Wanda Metropolitano's pitch has been replaced in time for Saturday's game. After Atletico's 1-1 draw at Monaco on November 11, Costa criticised the surface which was laid only last September. ""The pitch is shameful, it's fatal,"" Costa told El Mundo. ""Wanda's turf is horrible, we can not have such a bad pitch,"" he added."
150,13/11/2018,13:18,New injury woe for Atletico front man Costa: club,Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa has been sidelined with a foot injury that could leave him in a race for full fitness ahead of a crucial league clash with Barcelona.,"Costa hobbled off during a 3-2 league win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, which saw the capital side close to within a point of leaders Barcelona. Atletico defender Diego Godin hit a brace in that win but has been sidelined after he, too, hobbled off before the end with a thigh injury that could rule him out for up to a month. Now Costa has joined the Uruguayan on the sidelines after suffering ""an injury to his foot,"" according to a statement by Atletico on Tuesday. ""The striker will go through adapted training sessions and undergo physiotherapy and medical treatment,"" it added, without giving a timeline for his return to competition. Costa only returned to the competitive fold earlier this month following a two-week absence due to ""muscle problems"" but played only the first half against Bilbao after complaining of ""pains"", according to Atletico coach Diego Simeone. Simeone is also without the injured Thomas Lemar (thigh) and defenders Lucas Hernandez, Jose Maria Gimenez and Stefan Savic. Atletico host Barcelona on November 24 following the break for international matches, then host Monaco four days later looking to book their ticket for the last 16 of the Champions League."
151,12/11/2018,19:00,"Injured Godin could miss Brazil, France and Barcelona","Atletico Madrid's Uruguayan defender Diego Godin is set to miss upcoming matches against Brazil, France and Barcelona after suffering a thigh injury in last weekend's league win over Athletic Bilbao.","Although the Spanish club refused to put a timeline on a return, AS sports daily reported the 32-year-old could be out for three to four weeks. If confirmed it would rule Godin out of international friendlies away to Brazil on November 16 and France, at the Stade de France, on November 20. Godin scored the winner in Atletico's 3-2 victory on Saturday which left them in third just one point behind leaders Barcelona, but could also miss the La Liga clash at home to the Catalan giants on November 24. Atletico coach Diego Simeone is already without the services of fellow defenders Lucas Hernandez, Jose Maria Gimenez and Stefan Savic."
152,10/11/2018,20:47,Atletico need VAR and late Godin winner to beat Bilbao,Diego Godin scored a 91st-minute winner as Atletico Madrid twice came from behind to beat Athletic Bilbao 3-2 in La Liga on Saturday.,"Godin's close-range finish was initially ruled out for offside at the Wanda Metropolitano but referee Jose Sanchez overturned the decision after consulting his video assistant referee. It proved a dramatic finale to a pulsating encounter, which Bilbao twice led thanks to two goals from Inaki Williams. A stunning long-range strike from Thomas Partey and Rodrigo's header 10 minutes from time, however, pulled Atletico level, before Godin snatched all three points. Victory means Diego Simeone's side move to within a point of Barcelona, who play at home to Real Betis on Sunday. Bilbao remain 17th, without a win since the opening day of the season. That run has, however, included draws against both Barca and Real Madrid, and for much of this contest they were the better side too. But after beating Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday, Atletico sustained momentum with a result made all the more impressive by their lengthy list of absentees. Godin and Diego Costa both returned from injury but 19-year-old Francisco Montero had to play alongside Godin in central defence, with Luis Hernandez, Jose Gimenez and Stefan Savic all out, along with Thomas Lemar and Koke in midfield. Atletico started brightly enough as Antoine Griezmann picked out Filipe Luis at the back post and then nipped in behind but Bilbao never looked uncomfortable. They grew into the game. Susaeta fired wide, after Rodrigo carelessly conceded possession, and then instigated the goal, darting free of the sleeping Luis. Susaeta squared for Mikel San Jose, whose first-time shot was brilliantly clawed onto the post by Jan Oblak. But the ball rolled agonisingly across the line, where Williams was perfectly placed. It was the first league goal Atletico had conceded in a first half this season and there were whistles as the players departed at the interval. Frustration grew, but Bilbao should have doubled their lead shortly before the hour. Instead, Williams shot straight at Oblak from eight yards. They would pay for it within a matter of minutes, Thomas unleashing a booming effort from range that flew past Iago Herrerin and into the corner. Level in the 61st minute, Atletico were behind again in the 64th as one pass sent the speedy Williams clear. Godin clambered at the striker's heels but could not recover. Williams slid in his second. Atletico pushed again and Bilbao never looked secure sitting back. It was a simple corner this time, delivered by Thomas and glanced inside the far post by the head of Rodrigo. There were 10 minutes left for either side to find a winner and it was Atleti that snatched it. Saul kept the ball alive at the back post, Griezmann flicked it towards goal and Godin poked over the line. The celebrations were halted by the linesman's flag. But only temporarily. Earlier on Saturday, Valencia followed up their Champions League win over Young Boys in midweek by securing only their second La Liga victory of the season away to Getafe. The decisive goal came in the 81st minute and from the penalty spot as Daniel Parejo converted after Kevin Gameiro was brought down by Bruno Gonzalez. Bruno received a second yellow card for the foul and was sent off as Valencia held on for a much-needed 1-0 win."
153,09/11/2018,02:30,Solari to make closing argument for revived Madrid job,Santiago Solari is pitching for more than just three points as Real Madrid continue their revival under the interim coach and head to Celta Vigo aiming for their fourth straight win.,"Solari's time as the European champions' stop-gap following Julen Lopetegui's sacking will expire over the international break, and club president Florentino Perez needs to decide whether to take the Argentine on permanently. Real have bounced back under Solari, with Wednesday's 5-0 drubbing of Viktoria Plzen a clear sign of life in the struggling giants. A win at bouncing Balaidos could well be enough to convince Perez the job should be Solari's, at least until the end of the season, when a more established alternatives could be available. ""We're doing fine with him,"" striker Karim Benzema said on Wednesday. ""I don't see a coach coming for one or two months, for me Solari has to stay until the end of the season. He's a great coach. Now we have more confidence and we are going to fight."" Few could begrudge Solari the opportunity to prove himself after stepping up from Madrid's B team to take charge. Madrid have scored 11 and conceded none since Solari's arrival, against admittedly modest opposition -- Melilla from the Spanish third tier, Real Valladolid at home and Plzen. Luck has also played its part, as Vinicius Junior's deflected shot prevented what looked set to be a stalemate against Valladolid with seven minutes to play. A draw there and Solari's tenure might never have got off the ground. However it was Solari's decision to bring on the 18-year-old Vinicius, whose youthful exuberance produced an ambitious strike at the end of a weaving run. Celta will offer a sterner test this weekend. They are the third highest scorers in the division and in Iago Aspas boast the sort of smart finisher Madrid might have signed in the summer. Aspas' eight goals this term puts him one up on Lionel Messi, who could return on Sunday when league leaders Barcelona host Real Betis after three weeks out with a broken arm. Messi was included in Barca's travelling squad to face Inter Milan on Wednesday but watched from the stands as his side reached the Champions League knockout stages with a 1-1 draw at the San Siro. ""We wanted him to travel with the team, to train to see how he was,"" coach Ernesto Valverde said. Valverde has been afforded the luxury of easing Messi back by his team's strong run without him. Reaching the last 16 in Europe came after five wins on the bounce, four of them without Messi, including one against Inter at home and the 5-1 hammering of Real Madrid. A tricky period of fixtures continues against Betis and ends at Atletico Madrid after the international break. Luis Suarez's with six goals in his last five games have been integral but Jordi Alba has arguably been Barca's player of the season so far. His form has forced Spain coach Luis Enrique to concede defeat in his mysterious stand-off with the full-back, calling Alba up for the first time on Thursday. Diego Costa and Koke missed out on the squad with injury as Atletico Madrid head into their clash with Athletic Bilbao on Saturday with a dizzying list of absentees. Thomas Lemar, Diego Godin and Stefan Savic were also missing for Tuesday's impressive 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund, in which Jose Gimenez pulled up with a muscle problem. Fourth-placed Atleti are four points behind leaders Barca and looking to build on the momentum gained in midweek and leapfrog Sevilla and Espanyol, who play each other in Andalusia on Sunday."
154,06/11/2018,23:14,Atletico gain sweet revenge by cruising past Dortmund,Atletico Madrid avenged their Borussia Dortmund drubbing from a fortnight ago and revived hopes of going through top of Champions League Group A by beating the German side 2-0 at the Wanda Metropolitano on Tuesday.,"Dortmund handed Atletico their heaviest defeat under Diego Simeone with a 4-0 victory 13 days ago but this contest was almost a mirror image, the hosts in control from start to finish. Saul Niguez and Antoine Griezmann scored a goal in each half to complete a win that puts Atleti five points clear of third-place Club Brugge with two games to play, and on the brink of the Champions League knock-out stage. First place is also back in sight, with Atletico and Dortmund each on nine points, even if Simeone's side have the slightly tougher task of playing Brugge away in their final fixture. ""We wanted to get one back on them after the first game,"" Saul said. ""It was tough to take and it might have gone the other way two weeks ago. Tonight was a bit of revenge for us."" After losing in Germany, Atleti were also held at struggling Leganes in La Liga on Saturday and this result, without the injured Diego Costa, Diego Godin and Koke, will do wonders for morale. The only set-back was defender Jose Gimenez being forced off at half-time with what the club confirmed was a thigh strain. ""The team responded,"" Simeone said. ""We played as a team and when everyone buys into that, you have your identity. You can feel what you do together and today the boys showed that."" Dortmund, who sit top of the Bundesliga, host Bayern Munich on Saturday and they lacked the same verve they showed two weeks ago. ""They dominated us today,"" Dortmund coach Lucien Favre said, before brushing off the suggestion this could hang over them against Bayern. ""It's just a defeat. It can happen."" England's Jadon Sancho was handed his fourth consecutive start for the visitors, his longest run in the side this season. After a bright start, the youngster faded and was replaced late in the second half. The first 30 minutes was a battle for the pace of the game, with Atletico trying to keep it fast and frenetic while Dortmund aimed to kill momentum at every opportunity. Angel Correa twice went close but otherwise Atleti's authority came to little in the way of chances until the 32nd minute. Saul began the move by playing left to Filipe Luis and finished it too, sliding the ball goalward where Manuel Akanji lashed it into his own net. In between, Filipe's pass had been brilliantly dummied by Correa. Their resistance broken, Dortmund lost their way and were hanging on at the end of the half. Thomas Partey's drive grazed the crossbar and soon after Saul skewed wide when left open at the back post. Simeone was convinced they deserved a penalty when Griezmann's effort was parried and the incoming Saul was taken out by Lukasz Piszczek. Dortmund's best chance came early in the second half when Paco Alcacer nipped in after a Francisco Montero slip. Alcacer fired across goal but with such force that Raphael Guerreiro, five yards out, hardly saw the ball as it flew off his head and over the bar. Atletico waited for their moment on the counter-attack and when it came in the 80th minute, they pounced. One pass out of defence found Gelson Martins, who helped it forward to Partey. He played inside to Griezmann, who muscled through and poked the ball past Roman Burki. Simeone turned, his fist pumping. Dortmund's hopes of a comeback were dashed and Atletico were back in with a realistic chance of topping the group."
155,05/11/2018,02:30,Wobbling Atletico aiming for bounce back against Dortmund,Atletico Madrid's underwhelming start to the season might have been overshadowed by the crisis enveloping city rivals Real but there will be no place to hide against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday.,"A fortnight ago Dortmund dealt Diego Simeone's side a 4-0 drubbing, Atletico's heaviest defeat since the coach took charge 392 matches ago, while on Saturday they were held to a 1-1 draw by lowly Leganes, 18th in La Liga and with six defeats already to their name. This was supposed to be Atletico's year, primed for a title challenge by some impressive signings in the summer and eyeing a run at the Champions League, pumped by the prospect of a final inside their own Wanda Metropolitano in June. Their failings against Dortmund and Leganes were more striking because they were caused by weaknesses in defence, their strong point under Simeone. Dortmund pounced on Atletico to hit three in 10 minutes at the Signal Iduna Park, while on Saturday Leganes equalised thanks to lax marking at a free-kick. Atletico are cast in Simeone's image and have rarely been easy on the eye during his tenure. After scoring from a nine-pass move against Huesca last month, the coach said: ""I liked it because it ended with a goal."" Their backline in recent years has been the hardest to breach in Europe. ""Nobody has the perfect way of playing,"" Simeone said last week. ""It is about a pursuit of winning."" Weaker defending has placed greater demand on the attack but Antoine Griezmann's partnership with Diego Costa, so effective last season, appears to have lost its spark. Costa has one goal all season and is yet to get off the mark in La Liga. After turning 30 last month, it is tempting to wonder if the Spaniard's best days are now behind him. Simeone remains loyal to Costa as he shares his best qualities -- grit, determination, an unrelenting will to win -- with his striker. They also define Atletico at their best. ""He is an extraordinary player and very important to us,"" Simeone said last month. ""Not least because of what he contributes to the atmosphere in the dressing room."" The rest of the team have not stepped in to fill the gap. Griezmann has five goals in 14, a decent return, but some way off the numbers needed. Thomas Lemar, the club's most exciting signing in the summer, has only two, and his unmistakeable talent has so far only been seen in fits and starts. The overall sense is Atletico are under-delivering on expectations. Some have even suggested the message of Simeone, into his eighth year in charge, might have lost its punch. More likely, perhaps, is that they simply over-achieved before. ""The biggest plus of Simeone is he knows how to convince his players of his ideas,"" former Barcelona midfielder Xavi Hernandez told Catalunya Radio on Saturday. ""He believes it is the only way to compete with Barca and Real Madrid. And his players believe it as well."" Five wins from 11 games is hardly the form of champions but Atletico still have all to play for thanks to their stumbling rivals. They sit third in the table, only four points adrift of leaders Barcelona and three ahead of Real. In the Champions League, victory over Dortmund this week could seal qualification with two games to spare and put them level on points with the Bundesliga leaders. Beating the Germans to top spot may be out of reach given their scintillating form at home and abroad but as Real Madrid . Real's success, though, particularly in Europe, has come from a knack of casting off what has gone before and peaking when it matters most. Atletico need to take a leaf out of their rival's book."
156,03/11/2018,15:33,Griezmann stunner not enough as Atletico held by Leganes,Antoine Griezmann scored a brilliant free-kick but Atletico Madrid missed the chance to go top of La Liga on Saturday after drawing 1-1 at struggling Leganes.,"Griezmann's bending effort in the second half looked likely to prove the difference in a contest short on chances at Butarque but Guido Carrillo's 82nd-minute equaliser earned Leganes a deserved point. Atletico could have moved above Barcelona, for a few hours at least, but instead Diego Simeone's side sit a point behind the league leaders, who face Rayo Vallecano later on Saturday. Leganes remain 18th and without a win in five matches. Diego Costa, Diego Godin and Koke were all struggling with injury and absent from Atleti's starting line-up, perhaps not deemed worth the risk, with a crunch Champions League clash at home to Borussia Dortmund to come on Tuesday. Atletico sit second in Group A, three points behind the German side. But a stuttering run of form will be a concern too for Simeone, whose team were thrashed by Dortmund 4-0 only nine days ago and have now failed to beat Leganes, who are fighting relegation. ""We played for more and wanted more but have to settle for a point,"" Simeone said afterwards. ""The feeling is bitter-sweet,"" added Saul Niguez. ""We know it is in these matches where the league is decided. Leganes played a great first half but we have to be more ambitious and should have won."" Neither side managed a shot on target in the first half and both goals came from set-pieces in the second. Griezmann's strike in the 69th-minute would have been a worthy winner, the Frenchman curling a left-footed effort away from the rooted Pichu Cuellar and into the corner. But Atletico never looked like putting Leganes away and instead the hosts equalised as Rodri Tarin peeled free at the back post, his finish cannoning down off the crossbar for Carrillo to bundle in. Griezmann might still have won it for Atletico in injury-time but sent Filipe Luis' cut-back flying over the crossbar from eight yards out. Simeone twisted on his heels, with his head in his hands."
157,01/11/2018,13:07,"Costa, Godin, Koke sit out Atletico training ahead of Leganes test","Atletico Madrid have concerns over the fitness of Diego Costa, Diego Godin and Koke after the trio sat out training with the first team on Thursday.","The club confirmed that Koke took part in a separate session at the Wanda Sports City after feeling discomfort in his thigh while Costa and Godin also trained alone due to muscular problems. Atletico will hope they can return for their La Liga game away to Leganes on Saturday but Diego Simeone may be reluctant to take any risks, with a crunch Champions League match at home to Borussia Dortmund coming up on Tuesday. After losing 4-0 in Dortmund last week, Atleti sit second in Group A, three points behind the German team at the halfway stage. All three were rested for Atletico´s 1-0 win over Sant Andreu in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday, as Gelson Martins gave the visitors a slender advantage heading into the second leg."
158,24/10/2018,23:30,Dortmund thrash Atletico as Sancho scores first Champions League goal,"Borussia Dortmund stunned Atletico Madrid with a 4-0 thrashing on Wednesday to move to the verge of the Champions League knockout stage, as English teenager Jadon Sancho scored his first goal in the competition.","It was the heaviest Champions League defeat ever suffered by Diego Simeone in seven years as Atletico head coach and put Dortmund top of Group A after both teams had previously beaten Club Brugge and Monaco. Axel Witsel gave Dortmund the lead at Signal Iduna Park when his first-half shot took a wicked deflection, before Raphael Guerreiro, who scored twice in the second half, and 18-year-old Sancho came off the bench to grab the other goals. Dortmund were without in-form Spanish striker Paco Alcacer, who has scored seven times in just four Bundesliga games, with a leg injury, while Diego Costa returned to partner Antoine Griezmann up front for Atletico. This was a typically tense European affair, played at a frantic pace between two strong teams eager to focus on attacking football with neither defence allowing many clear chances. With 35 minutes gone, Dortmund lost midfielder Thomas Delaney with a foot injury and the Dane was replaced by Mahmoud Dahoud, who played a hand in the opening goal. After a determined run by US midfielder Christian Pulisic, 20, Dahoud carried on the move, before the ball eventually fell to Witsel, whose shot took a big deflection before finding the net. Atletico boss Simeone brought on a fresh pair of legs in midfield for the second half, taking off Thomas Partey and bringing on Rodri. The visitors showed how dangerous they can be by driving forward with real purpose and midfielder Saul Niguez crashed a shot off the woodwork on 53 minutes with Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki well beaten. Borussia were living dangerously, but a good spell midway through the second half, with Witsel in the thick of things, turned the game the hosts' way. Achraf Hakimi on loan from Real Madrid, got in the way of a Marco Reus run into the area, but the 19-year-old soon made amends by laying on the second goal with 17 minutes to go. The left-back got in behind his man and fired in a low cross that Reus missed, but Guerreiro stabbed past Oblak. At the other end, Burki only denied Atletico winger Angel Correa, on for Niguez, with the help of the post. Dortmund sealed the win when Hakimi did the damage again, charging into the area and teeing up Sancho to tap home their third goal on 83 minutes. And it turned into a rout when Guerreiro snapped up a loose pass from Felipe Luis and fired past Oblak with a minute remaining."
159,23/10/2018,14:39,Facing Atletico is like 'toothache' for Dortmund goal-ace Alcacer,Goal machine Paco Alcacer says playing against Atletico Madrid feels like 'toothache' -- and he hopes to extract maximum revenge for past suffering when Borussia Dortmund meet them in Wednesday's Champions League clash.,"The 26-year-old, on loan from Barcelona, has needed just 109 minutes to score seven Bundesliga goals this season -- the best goal-rate in the league's history, which included a deft chip in Saturday's 4-0 drubbing of Stuttgart to keep Dortmund top of the table. In total, Alcacer has netted 11 goals in his last seven games for club and country, but now has Atletico in his sights for the Group A showdown with both teams having won their first two games. ""A toothache to play against Atletico? Well, yes, totally,"" Alcacer told Spanish newspaper Marca, having lost six of his nine games against Atletico for either former clubs Getafe or Valencia. He never faced them while with Barcelona. ""They are a team that concede very few goals and they leave few spaces, while they're always very aware of everything. ""For a striker, it's frustrating."" However, his form has been anything but 'frustrating' since arriving in Dortmund in August after two unhappy seasons at Barcelona, where his path to the first-team was blocked by Luiz Suarez. Alcacer's goal exploits quickly wrote him into Dortmund's footballing folklore. ""The freedom is playing, having minutes and enjoying the profession. I didn't have the minutes at Barcelona and now I am having them, things are going well,"" he added. However, each goal he scores also carries a tragic reminder. When he scored at Stuttgart on Saturday, he raised his arms to celebrate, as does after each goal, and looked to the heavens with the words ""Always in my mind, Papa"" tattooed on his left bicep. Alcacer was still a teenager when his world was turned upside down on the first game of the 2011/12 season. His father Francisco died of a heart-attack while leaving the stadium after watching his son play in a friendly for former club Valencia against Roma. His father would no doubt be proud of what his son has achieved in just a few weeks at Dortmund, who have told Barcelona they want to sign him permanently, with his value estimated at around 30 million euros ($34.4m). Alcacer endeared himself to Dortmund fans by scoring on his debut off the bench against Eintracht Frankfurt in mid September. In his next game, he added two more, again as a sub, against Leverkusen. Then followed a stunning hat-trick in just 31 minutes as a second-half replacement against Augsburg on October 6, which included a stunning 96th-minute winner by banging in a superb free-kick just before the final whistle to seal a 4-3 comeback win. ""We had hoped that he would fit, but we hadn't dared hope that he would score like that,"" admitted Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc. On top of his Bundesliga goals, Alcacer also scored in the 3-0 win at home to Monaco at the start of the month, then claimed three goals in two games last week on his return to the Spain team after a two year hiatus. Now comes Atletico, led by their French goal-king Antoine Griezmann, and Alcacer could well be the source of an uncomfortable night for the Spanish team at Signal Iduna Park. ""It's clear that Atletico are a great team and a great club, a top club. But we need to make things difficult for them and go from there,"" said Alcacer."
160,07/10/2018,18:54,Correa winner against Betis sends Atletico top of La Liga,Atletico Madrid shot to the top of La Liga after Angel Correa's goal proved the winner in an untidy 1-0 win over Real Betis on Sunday.,"Atletico sat seven points behind Real Madrid and Barcelona after winning only one of their opening four league games but as their rivals have stumbled, Diego Simeone's side have sprung into form. Even if Barca return to the summit by beating Valencia later on Sunday, this was Atleti's fifth win in six in all competitions, with their only dropped points coming in a stalemate away to Real Madrid. ""We look at everything quietly and continue to improve,"" Simeone said. ""We have grown."" Simeone can take some of the credit too for this victory at the Wanda Metropolitano, after throwing on both Correa and Thomas Partey as substitutes in the second half. Thomas provided the assist. ""When the players respond, the coaches look better,"" Simeone said. ""The teams that challenge up the top of the table are there because of the players they can bring off the bench."" The contest was billed as a classic clash of styles, with Atletico's stubborn defence up against the free-flowing Real Betis, who lit up the league last season with their flurry of goals. It is testament to the threat they pose that opponents have become more cautious this season and Atletico were successful here in their strategy of absorb and counter-attack. ""A great coach once said, the best Plan B is always to do Plan A better,"" said Betis coach Quique Setien. They could also have gone top with a win, such is the scrunched nature of the top half, but instead Betis stay seventh. ""We have less points than our performances deserve,"" Setien added. Diego Costa was missing with a thigh injury, allowing Nikola Kalinic to make his first start since joining from AC Milan in August. There was a lack of width and clear thinking in the first half although Betis had the best chance early on. Loren Moron raced through a rare gap in the Atletico defence but the ball got stuck under his feet and he skewed wide. Atletico posed a threat on the break but repeatedly fluffed the final pass. Kalinic struck the post early in the second half after Aissa Mandi gave it away, before Rodrigo lashed a shot at Pau Lopez. Simeone flapped his arms to beckon the home crowd ane Atleti were finding their rhythm as Antoine Griezmann pulled back for Kalinic and then Correa fired across goal but neither Griezmann nor Diego Godin turned it in. Correa, on for the quiet Thomas Lemar, had made a difference with his direct running and he deserved his goal in the 74th minute. Thomas flicked it into his path and with no better option, the forward drove low into the bottom corner. Betis pushed in the latter stages but there was little hint of an equaliser. Atletico held on."
161,04/10/2018,14:38,Injured Costa misses out on Spain squad,"Diego Costa was left out of the Spain squad announced by coach Luis Enrique on Thursday, ahead of games against Wales and England.","Costa sustained a thigh strain playing for Atletico Madrid against Club Brugge in the Champions League on Wednesday. Isco, Dani Carvajal, Inigo Martinez and Sergi Roberto are also injured. ""I really regret losing players but it gives other players an opportunity to show me their level,"" Luis Enrique said. Wolves defender Jonny Otto, on loan from Atletico, received his first international call-up while there were returns to the squad for Real Betis defender Marc Bartra, Borussia Dortmund forward Paco Alcacer, who is on loan from Barcelona, and Atletico Madrid's Koke. Koke was not picked for the games against Croatia and Spain last month but has been in fine form for Atletico. ""He deserves to be here,"" Luis Enrique said. ""The doors to the squad are always open."" Alvaro Morata was also included despite failing to score for Chelsea since the last international break. Barcelona defender Jordi Alba, a surprise absentee from Luis Enrique's first squad, was again left out. Luis Enrique denied Alba's exclusion was due to any personal disagreement dating back to his time in charge of Barcelona. ""Personal reasons do not come into it for me,"" Luis Enrique said. ""I have done it for professional reasons, there are many players out of this list who deserve to be in."" Spain play Wales in a friendly in Cardiff on October 11 before facing England in the UEFA Nations League on October 15 in Seville. Spain squad: Goalkeepers: David De Gea (Manchester United/ENG), Kepa Arrizabalaga (Chelsea/ENG), Pau Lopez (Real Betis) Defenders: Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea/ENG), Raul Albiol (Napoli/ITA), Nacho, Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid), Marcos Alonso (Chelsea/ENG), Gaya (Valencia), Marc Bartra (Real Betis), Jonny Otto (Wolverhampton/ENG) Midfielders: Sergio Busquets (Barcelona), Rodrigo, Saul, Koke (Atletico Madrid), Thiago Alcantara (Bayern Munich/GER), Dani Ceballos (Real Madrid) Forwards: Marco Asensio (Real Madrid), Alvaro Morata (Chelsea/ENG), Suso (AC Milan/ITA), Rodrigo Moreno (Valencia), Iago Aspas (Celta Vigo), Paco Alcacer (Borussia Dortmund/GER)"

Before then, Atletico face Real Betis in La Liga on Sunday. Sitting out another international break would be a blow for Costa, who was absent in September for Luis Enrique's first two matches in charge due to personal reasons. Atletico will also carry out tests on their Uruguayan defender Jose Gimenez on Thursday. Gimenez came off injured at half-time against Brugge."

Messi, who had earlier twice hit the post, then got on the scoresheet in between goals from Harry Kane and Erik Lamela, before the Argentina superstar grabbed his second late on to seal victory. ""After a few bad results it was important to do well today. Our response was very good,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde. Barca head Group B on six points alongside Inter Milan, but Mauricio Pochettino's side face a vital double-header against PSV Eindhoven after failing to collect a point from their opening two matches. The Tottenham boss admitted Spurs had few answers for Messi as his team was left with an uphill struggle to reach the knockout stages. ""He's a fantastic player,"" said Pochettino. ""His average performance is this type of game. He's always above everything."" Inter, the last Italian club to win the Champions League in 2010, again recovered from a goal down to beat PSV 2-1 in the Netherlands. A cracking Pablo Rosario strike put PSV ahead, but Inter levelled through Radja Nainggolan moments after visiting goalkeeper Samir Handanovic somehow escaped a red card for handling outside his area. Mauro Icardi, whose late goal stunned Spurs a fortnight ago, was the hero again for Luciano Spalletti's men as he pounced on hesitant defending to net the winner on the hour. PSG rebounded from their 3-2 defeat by Liverpool with an attacking masterclass against 1991 European Cup winners Red Star at the Parc des Princes. Neymar curled in a sublime free-kick to open the scoring on 20 minutes, quickly doubling his tally before Edinson Cavani, Angel di Maria and Kylian Mbappe also found the target. Former Germany international Marko Marin popped up with a consolation for Red Star, with Neymar completing his hat-trick from another stunning free-kick. ""I really liked the effort made by the whole team, but Neymar was sensational,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""He is one of the best players in Europe and that is very, very important for us."" Carlo Ancelotti's Napoli top Group C on four points after Lorenzo Insigne delivered a 90th-minute winner at home to Liverpool, who are level on three alongside PSG. Dries Mertens hit the bar for Napoli late on, but there was still time for Insigne to nick all three points at the death as he slid to poke in a cross from Jose Callejon. ""Tonight we showed this group won't just be hard for Napoli, but for everyone involved,"" said Ancelotti. ""It means a lot to us to have won against the finalists from last year."" Antoine Griezmann scored two goals to lift Atletico Madrid, last season's Europa League winners, to a 3-1 victory over Club Brugge in Spain. Arnaut Groeneveld cancelled out Griezmann's opener with a thunderous strike from the left wing, but the France international restored Atletico's lead before Koke made the points safe in stoppage time. ""I said it last season and I'll say it again -- Griezmann is the best player in the world,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone. Borussia Dortmund lead Atletico at the top of Group A on goal difference following their 3-0 defeat of a struggling Monaco outfit. Jacob Bruun Larsen broke the deadlock in Germany shortly after his introduction as a half-time substitute, with Paco Alcacer finding the net just minutes after smacking a penalty against the bar. Marco Reus fired in a third from a Bruun Larsen cross, leaving Dortmund and Atletico on six points apiece ahead of their upcoming home-and-away meetings. In Group D, American international midfielder Weston McKennie hit an 88th-minute winner as struggling Schalke edged Lokomotiv Moscow 1-0. Porto are joint-top with Schalke following a 1-0 win over Galatasaray courtesy of Moussa Marega's second-half goal in Portugal."
164,04/10/2018,00:04,Griezmann is best in the world - Simeone,Diego Simeone hailed Antoine Griezmann as the best player in the world after the Frenchman's double fired Atletico Madrid to victory over Club Brugge on Wednesday.,"Griezmann scored twice and set up a third for Koke as Atletico won 3-1 in the stadium they hope to return to for the Champions League final next year. Arnaut Groeneveld's stunning long-range effort had pulled Brugge level shortly before half-time but Atleti, and Griezmann, were too good. ""I said it last season and I'll say it again -- Griezmann is the best player in the world,"" Simeone said afterwards. ""He won the Europa League, World Cup, Super Cup and finished second in a league with Barcelona and Real Madrid."" Lionel Messi, who was simultaneously tearing Tottenham apart at Wembley, may have something to say about that but there is no doubting Griezmann's importance to Atletico. He has now been involved in 17 of their last 19 Champions League goals scored at home, chipping in with 12 goals and five assists. Those performances can only boost the French star's hopes of winning the Ballon d'Or. ""It's not me who votes but I had a big season,"" he said. ""I'm very happy and proud of my season, there are still a few months to go so we'll see."" This was Atletico's first match at the Wanda Metropolitano in this season's tournament, 241 days before they hope to walk out here again for the final on June 1. Simeone admitted the prospect of winning the cup on their own patch is a source of inspiration for his side, and they could not have made a better start. Atletico boast six points in Group A, the same as Borussia Dortmund, whom they now play twice in succession, starting with a trip to Germany later this month. A successful night was blighted only by injury, with both Diego Costa and Jose Gimenez forced off. Costa sat out the last international round with Spain for personal reasons and he may be set to miss another. Atletico are now unbeaten in six games and they started like a team with their tails up as Costa and Koke almost pulled off a neat one-two in the box while Griezmann strayed just offside before a superb lifted finish. Thomas Lemar might have scored had Stefano Denswil not made a last-ditch tackle but it was the winger's cross that found Griezmann at the back post soon after. Griezmann chested, controlled and steered the ball inside the far post. Atleti looked almost too comfortable and Brugge seemed as surprised as anyone to equalise shortly before half-time. Groeneveld rolled his studs over the ball 30 yards out and with no obvious option, whipped it, bending and dipping into the corner. Filipe Luis came on for Gimenez at the interval and Atletico gradually turned the screw, Griezmann, Costa and Lemar all causing problems for the weary Brugge defence. Another smooth combination created the goal as Griezmann played in Costa, who could have shot but instead turned back and returned to Griezmann. He made no mistake. It was Costa's last contribution. Denswil could have snatched Brugge a point but headed over from six yards and instead, Griezmann added a final flourish. He stormed down the left flank and teed up Koke to slot home from close range."

They host Club Brugge there on Wednesday, after making the perfect start in Group A with a 2-1 win away to Monaco. Atletico have reached the Champions League final twice in the last five years, losing both times to rivals Real Madrid. ""It is complicated,"" Simeone said. ""People have the dream and the dream in life is the greatest thing there is. ""To achieve such a beautiful goal, which everyone is really motivated for, to get there you have to work, to win many matches, and face many rivals and there is still a long, long road ahead. ""It is normal that people are excited. They have the right to be excited as anyone would be if the final is in your stadium that is the most beautiful stadium in the world."" Atletico endured a difficult start in La Liga after managing only one win from their opening four games. Beating Monaco has sparked a resurgence, however, and they will entertain the Belgian champions on the back of three wins and a draw away to Real Madrid. Club Brugge opened their European campaign with a 1-0 home defeat by Borussia Dortmund. ""Since Monaco, we have got better and better but we have to be consistent,"" Simeone said. ""It is the hardest thing, to keep the pace, to find the best ways for the next match. It will be a tough game against Brugge, who caused problems for Dortmund too."""
167,29/09/2018,23:05,Courtois the key as Madrid derby ends goalless,Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois came back to haunt Atletico Madrid as two crunch saves denied Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa on Saturday in a goalless draw at the Santiago Bernabeu.,"Courtois spent three seasons at Atletico on loan from Chelsea but this was his first Madrid derby for Real. He made the most of it, saving when both Griezmann and Costa had only the Belgian to beat. Gareth Bale could have won a pulsating encounter for Real too but he sidefooted wide from close range towards the end of the first half. Bale did not emerge for the second period, substituted with a thigh injury, which will be a major concern for coach Julen Lopetegui. Real play CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Tuesday. In the end, both teams could have claimed victory but neither was perhaps too disappointed with a point. Atletico maintain their resurgence after a miserable start while Real steady the ship following their hammering at Sevilla on Wednesday. Lopetegui's side move back level with Barcelona on points. Atletico sit just two behind. This match was not lacking for sub-plots. Courtois had played seven Madrid derbies for Atletico but now he was in the other team's goal. It was Julen Lopetegui's first derby for points as Real coach, although he was the fifth Real manager Diego Simeone had stood opposite. And Griezmann was up against Sergio Ramos, who very publicly slapped down the Frenchman's Ballon d'Or ambitions earlier this month. Perhaps Real took added satisfaction in presenting Luka Modric with his FIFA Best Men's Player award before kick-off. Front and centre, however, was the battle at the top of the table. Only one of the last six La Liga matches played by Real and Barca had ended with them winning, which had pulled Atleti back in the race. A blistering opening period was a blur of scuffles, mistakes and missed chances, with Atletico shading the start and Real the finish. Griezmann attempted an audacious volley that flew over and then came his team's best chance when he only had Courtois to beat. His chipped finish met the goalkeeper's forehead. Tempers flared as a sprinting Bale was shouldered out of play by Saul Niguez. Bale should have had the perfect riposte but sidefooted wide from two yards. Ramos also left the pitch, voluntarily, for a bleeding eyebrow and Diego Godin managed briefly to halt play while trying to persuade Juan Martinez Munuera to consult VAR. The ball had struck Casemiro's arm but Godin was being optimistic. Courtois frustrated Costa too, a jabbed finish blocked from the angle, while Jan Oblak almost gave a gift to Marco Asensio but the intercepting touch fell straight back into his hands. Atletico had been relieved to reach half-time - Simeone had even poked a second ball onto the pitch to disrupt Real's rhythm - but the match simmered after the restart. Bale had gone off for Dani Ceballos and it took until close to the hour before Asensio latched onto Toni Kroos' through ball. Oblak stook tall again. Both sides tightened towards the end as Costa, Thomas Lemar and Luka Modric all made way. Neither team celebrated the final whistle but they did not seem too dissatisfied either."
168,28/09/2018,15:27,"Costa in 'fantastic form' for Madrid derby, insists Simeone","Diego Simeone has pledged his full support to Diego Costa, despite the Atletico Madrid striker's La Liga drought ahead of Saturday's derby against Real Madrid.","Costa scored twice against Real as Atletico lifted the European Super Cup in August and, going further back, he hit the winner at the Santiago Bernabeu in 2013, before leaving to join Chelsea. He has struggled for goals this season, however, managing only one in the Champions League against Monaco while in La Liga he has not found the net since February, a run that includes 15 matches. ""I see him being in fantastic form and for me, in the first half the other day (against Huesca), he was above everyone else, he played very well,"" Simeone said on Friday. ""He was involved in our first goal with an assist and was always always moving and causing problems. Physically, he is strong and against Madrid, I expect him to have a great game."" Atletico will jump above their city rivals with a win this weekend, after reducing a seven-point gap to two over the last fortnight. As well as recording back-to-back wins over Getafe and Huesca, Real have slipped up against Athletic Bilbao before being blown away on Wednesday by Sevilla. ""I look beyond the last game when I look at Madrid,"" Simeone said. ""They didn't have a good match in the first half but that can happen against Sevilla because they are a great team. ""I look at them and think about the talent and potential they have. We know we're going to face one of the best teams in the world."" Real had made an excellent start to the season, with many predicting Julen Lopetegui's team could prove more unified and better balanced without Cristiano Ronaldo. But five points dropped in three games, and a worrying susceptibility to counter-attacks against Sevilla, has allowed doubts to creep in. ""In football everything can change very fast,"" Lopetegui said. ""Immediately we have a magnificent challenge, a derby against Atletico, and just as we did not get carried away by the victories, we don't get bogged down by a defeat."" Marcelo pulled up with an injury against Sevilla, which Real confirmed on Friday as a calf strain. The full-back is expected to be out for around two weeks, with his availability for Real's Champions League trip to CSKA Moscow on Tuesday also in doubt."

'Atleti' were staring at the possibility of a double-digit deficit which, even as early as October, would have been a big gap to close. ""This is a wake-up call,"" Simeone said at the time. ""It is the best thing that can happen to us."" But after back-to-back wins Atletico come into Saturday's game just two points behind Barcelona, who top the table on goal difference, and Real -- who drew away at Athletic Bilbao before being hammered 3-0 by Sevilla on Wednesday. ""We are getting used to winning again,"" said Atletico's Filipe Luis, while Angel Correa added: ""This is the Atletico we want."" Some had put a line through Atletico a month ago but they will move above Real with a win -- and could even go top if Barca's dip continues at home to Bilbao. What is clear is that neither Barcelona nor Real Madrid were as formidable as their early form suggested, while Atleti were perhaps undersold by their lumbering out of the blocks. All three have shown they are fallible. Real were torn apart in 39 first-half minutes at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, which might have been marked down as a one-off were it not for Sevilla capitalising on the same counter-attacks Espanyol had attempted the week before, but failed to exploit. Atleti have also been wasteful up front. Antoine Griezmann has been indecisive, and Diego Costa is without a league goal since February. There is also Griezmann's recent spat with Real's Sergio Ramos to add another layer of intrigue. Ramos dismissed the Frenchman's suggestion he could do little more to win the Ballon d'Or. ""Ignorance makes you bold,"" Ramos said. Perhaps the difference is Griezmann is yet to win the Champions League and in that regard, he shares the same ache as Barcelona, whose pursuit of success in Europe appears already to be disrupting their domestic rhythm. Many Barca fans have still not forgiven Ernesto Valverde for last season's quarter-final collapse against Roma and chief among the complaints was his failure to rest key players. This week he left out Philippe Coutinho, Ivan Rakitic and Samuel Umtiti against Girona and, albeit with 10 men, they drew 2-2. He left out Luis Suarez and Jordi Alba against Leganes on Wednesday, and they lost 2-1. ""Obviously it is easy now to talk about the rotations,"" Valverde said. ""In the end, matches are analysed on results -- but you can't win the league with only 11 players."" Barca host Bilbao on Saturday, four days before facing Tottenham at Wembley and Umtiti's suspension means one player he cannot leave out against Spurs is Gerard Pique, even if the defender's error-count must be a concern. Clement Lenglet is likely to replace Umtiti in London and could be given another run-out this weekend after being sent off against Girona. Elsewhere, Sevilla travel to Eibar on Saturday while Valencia, still without a win this season, play away at Real Sociedad. Fixtures (all times GMT)"

171,30/07/2018,15:49,Injury-time winner hands Tuchel first win with PSG,Virgiliu Postolachi's injury-time strike handed Thomas Tuchel his first win as Paris Saint-Germain coach after a pulsating 3-2 victory over Atletico Madrid on Monday.,"Postolachi, 18, curled a stunning shot past Antonio Adan to settle the friendly after Atletico had recovered from 2-0 down, helped by Antoine Bernede's own goal on 86 minutes. PSG welcomed back Angel Di Maria after World Cup duty and Italy's Marco Verratti, but it was Christopher Nkunku and Moussa Diaby who put them 2-0 up before Victor Mollejo pulled one back for Atletico. The win was welcome for German newcomer Tuchel, whose under-strength French champions have fallen 3-1 and 5-1 to Bayern Munich and Arsenal in their previous pre-season friendlies. Nkunku's tap-in on 32 minutes was the highlight of a drab first half in front of 22,007 fans at the 55,000-capacity Singapore National Stadium. The 20-year-old midfielder was on hand to gobble up the rebound after a strong hint of a defensive handball in the Atletico box. The lead was deserved for PSG, who had most of the play but created few clear chances apart from a long-range Di Maria free kick and Nkunku's header from a Colin Dagba shot. But Atletico were dangerous on the break. Angel Correa and Luciano Vietto both had shots blocked on the line and Kevin Gameiro fired over when one-on-one with goalkeeper Kevin Trapp. PSG changed nine outfield players at half-time -- a number that rose to 11 by 60 minutes, including an injury to substitute Alec Georgen -- as the game opened up markedly. Eighteen-year-old Tim Weah was denied by Antonio Adan and Adan then saved from Moussa Diaby -- who rattled the crossbar from the edge of the box shortly afterwards. But Diaby, 19, was not to be denied and made no mistake when he was selflessly put through by Weah on 71 minutes, planting his shot low and to Adan's left. Atletico had twice come close at the other end and they finally scored on 76 minutes when Victor Mollejo stuck the rebound from his own shot past Trapp. And with four minutes to go, they had a huge slice of luck when Borja Garces's cross deflected off the helpless Bernede and into the PSG goal. The game looked like it was headed for a draw until Postolachi popped up with the decisive strike from the top of the penalty area."
172,15/05/2018,20:19,Marseille spurred on by memories of European glory,Marseille star Dimitri Payet is determined to go down in history by beating Atletico Madrid in Wednesday's Europa League final as the club celebrates a quarter of a century since their greatest moment.,"They became the first, and to date only, French club to win the Champions League by beating AC Milan in the 1993 final, and now they are hoping to become the first team from the country to lift the Europa League trophy. ""We are lucky to have the chance to continue the love affair that this club has with European competitions,"" Payet told reporters in Lyon, where Wednesday's final will be played. Marseille are hoping the fact the game is being played on French soil will work in their favour, even if Diego Simeone's Atletico are formidable opponents. ""We can go down in history and leave an even bigger mark on this club,"" Payet added, as excitement builds around France. Marseille's glory days may be in the past, while their great rivals Paris Saint-Germain have become the country's dominant force. But OM remain France's best supported side. ""I think the expectation in Marseille and across the country is quite extraordinary and our motivation comes from that,"" said Payet, who is set to play as he recovers from a minor muscle injury that kept him out of his team's 3-3 Ligue 1 draw at Guingamp last Friday. Coach Rudi Garcia surpassed expectations just by leading Marseille into European competition this season, yet now they have reached the final after a run that started in the third qualifying round last July. Garcia said: ""This year we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the only time a French team has won the Champions League. So we have a great example to go on and become the first ones to win the Europa League."" It is Marseille's fifth European final overall -- they lost the 1991 European Cup final on penalties to Red Star Belgrade, before disappointing defeats in the UEFA Cup final to Parma in 1999 and Rafael Benitez's Valencia in 2004. The only other European trophy won by a French club remains PSG's victory in the now defunct Cup Winners' Cup in 1996. ""We are lucky to be at Marseille, a club with a love affair with European competitions that goes back to the 1990s, and we are all eager to follow in the footsteps of our illustrious predecessors,"" Garcia said. ""We know that Atletico stand in our way and that it will be a very difficult mission, but that would make it an even greater achievement if we managed to win the trophy."""
173,15/05/2018,19:03,Simeone warns of Payet threat in Europa League final,Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone is wary of the threat posed by Marseille's Dimitri Payet but believes his team's extra experience will count for something in Wednesday's Europa League final.,"""Experience is an important factor although it won't completely influence the game,"" said Simeone at a press conference on Tuesday ahead of the match in the French city of Lyon. A strong Atletico side, with a formidable defence and an attack spearheaded by Antoine Griezmann, are the favourites, having won the Europa League twice in the last decade and also narrowly lost two Champions League finals to Real Madrid, in 2014 and 2016. But Rudi Garcia's Marseille have caught Simeone's eye on their run to a first continental final in 14 years. ""They will have self-confidence, and we will need to impose our rhythm as the game goes on. We are similar teams and it will be quite a tense game,"" he said. Atletico's defence is arguably the best in Europe -- they have let in just 20 goals in La Liga this season -- and Simeone's side will need to stifle Payet to prevent Marseille from winning a second European trophy to follow their Champions League triumph of 1993. ""They are a dangerous side going forward and Payet will dictate the rhythm. Their coach has done a great job."" Simeone's sending-off in the first leg of the 2-1 semi-final triumph over Arsenal means he will be suspended for Wednesday's game. But while the Argentine will be forced to watch on from the stands, his fiery assistant, German ""Mono"" Burgos, will take charge of the team. ""It was same thing against Arsenal, when German was in charge of the side. ""I feel sad at not being there, but we have known each other for a lifetime and we understand football in the same way. I have confidence in him being in charge."""
174,15/05/2018,02:05,Atletico bid to erase pain of finals past in Marseille showdown,"After painful defeats in recent continental finals, Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid are determined to justify their status as favourites in Wednesday's Europa League showpiece against Marseille in Lyon.","Atletico lost in extra time to Real Madrid in the Champions League final of 2014, having been seconds away from victory in 90 minutes, and then lost on penalties to their city rivals in the final of the same competition two years later. An exit from this season's Champions League in the group stage came as a big surprise for a formidable side spearheaded by Antoine Griezmann in attack, but they have put that behind them to close on glory in Europe's less prestigious competition. Atletico are looking to win the Europa League for the third time in nine seasons, after triumphing in 2010 and again in 2012, shortly after 'Cholo' Simeone was appointed coach. ""We can't wait for the final to come around,"" full-back Juanfran told Radio Marca as Atletico target a first trophy since 2014, when they won La Liga. ""With 'Cholo' lots of things have changed at Atletico. Everything we have experienced in these last few years we will remember forever. I hope we can get another little medal."" It would be a first, and possibly last major medal as an Atletico player for Griezmann, who was raised not far from Lyon but has spent his whole career in Spain. The 27-year-old forward joined Atletico from Real Sociedad on the back of their title success in 2014, but could soon be on his way to Barcelona. Griezmann and Diego Costa will lead Simeone's attack as Atletico return to Lyon, where they lost 3-0 to Dynamo Kiev in the final of the now defunct Cup Winners' Cup in 1986. Atletico have had plenty of heartbreak in European finals down the years, as have Marseille. The French club have previously appeared in four, losing three, the exception being their victory over AC Milan in the inaugural Champions League final in 1993. Rudi Garcia's team were not expected to make it this far, having started their European campaign in the qualifying rounds last July. But after rousing wins over RB Leipzig in the last eight and Salzburg in the semi-finals, OM and their passionate fans are now dreaming of glory on home soil. ""Those who won the Champions League in 1993 are still heroes because nobody else has done it since,"" Dimitri Payet told UEFA.com. ""We know how tough it is. Of course, that's an added source of motivation, and if we do win the final, our names will be written into the club's history books forever."" Marseille are also battling for a top-three finish in the French league, and the fear is that fatigue will be a factor as they try to break down Atletico's brilliant defence. ""They are a big club, a super team with great players and a great coach. They are used to playing in big European matches. They are clear favourites but we will do everything to create a surprise,"" winger Florian Thauvin told sports daily L'Equipe. Payet is ""optimistic"" he will shake off a minor muscle problem to feature in Wednesday's game, where Marseille will hope to have a big support behind them. Only around 11,500 of their fans will officially be in attendance, however, but several thousand more should make the three-hour trip to Lyon. Authorities are preparing for the threat of trouble, with a big rivalry developing in recent years between Marseille and Lyon. Since reaching the final, Marseille fans have taunted Lyon and their outspoken president Jean-Michel Aulas with chants of: ""We're going to smash up your house"". There will be 1,250 police officers deployed in the city and around the Groupama Stadium, where Wednesday's match will start at 8:45pm (1845 GMT)."

""OM have the ability to win it,"" Zidane said in Corsica on Monday where he had turned up for a charity match organised by former Marseille goalkeeper Pascal Olmeta. ""It's a huge achievement just to have got to the final, they've done really well,"" said Zidane, the coach of Real Madrid. ""It comes down to details in a final. It's two huge clubs, two institutions, but Marseille has the means to do it. ""I have no advice to give them, but I believe they have every chance."""
176,14/05/2018,02:23,Griezmann set for Atletico goodbye in Europa League final,Antoine Griezmann's first major trophy with Atletico Madrid may well prove to be his last if they can overcome Marseille in the Europa League final on Wednesday.,"Griezmann's future has dominated the build-up to this week's showpiece match in Lyon, with the striker widely expected to join Barcelona in the summer. A string of Atletico players were quizzed at a club 'Media Day' last week and even if coach Diego Simeone insisted his focus was like that of a racehorse - ""head forward, I don't see or hear anything but the final"" - it is impossible to ignore the noise surrounding the Frenchman. Luis Suarez had stirred the pot by speaking about Griezmann as though a deal with Barca was already completed, which prompted an angry response from Atletico chief executive Miguel Angel Gil Marin. ""We're fed up with Barcelona's attitude,"" he said in a statement. ""How a president, player and board member speak the way they have done about the future of a player with an existing contract and just a few days before disputing a European final, is an absolute lack of respect towards Atletico."" Griezmann has certainly not dampened the speculation, saying only that he wants his future resolved before the start of the World Cup, while last week even Atletico's president Enrique Cerezo was hardly reassuring when he said: ""Antoine Griezmann is an Atletico Madrid player, as of today."" It all suggests the final could be amount to a Griezmann farewell, after a bumpy four years at Atletico, undoubtedly successful as a whole but not without a few stumbles along the way. This term, he has 30 goals in 52 appearances and, since he joined, his La Liga record stands at 79 in 142. ""I think Griezmann is big enough to know what he's doing,"" his strike partner Diego Costa said. ""For a player, when Barca want you, it makes you feel important, but he knows that he is important for us and that we want him here."" A departure seemed likely last summer when Griezmann rated his chances of joining Manchester United at ""six out of 10"" but if his teasing was then deemed slightly disrespectful, his decision to stay was applauded. Atletico had been hit with a transfer ban and Griezmann said it would feel ""dirty"" to leave, with the club incapable of bringing in his successor. But a new contract looked more like a stop-gap given it included a 100 million euro release clause, which will activate from July 1. For a 27-year-old in the prime of his career, before a World Cup, it is not a figure to deter his suitors. ""He would be cheap for the international market,"" Filipe Luis said. ""And it will be even cheaper if he wins the final."" All the more reason then for Griezmann to deliver against Marseille, and for the club that took the gamble to sign him from Real Sociedad in 2014 when other elite teams looked but decided to hold off. Marseille, meanwhile, are the club Griezmann was pictured managing while playing the game 'Football Manager' last year, when he jokingly apologised to Valere Germain and Kostas Mitroglou for not picking them in his side. The furore surrounding Griezmann also serves to highlight the brilliant job Simeone has done, against the odds, and with rivals always circling his star players. But Griezmann too has been key to Atletico's run to the final and his talent would be difficult to replace. ""Right now he is thinking about winning a title,"" Costa said. ""If Griezmann can make history here with us, win that title, then afterwards there will be time for him to decide what to do."""

Simeone resisted the temptation to rest players for the final in Lyon and was rewarded as his side moved six points clear of third-placed Real with one game to go, before the European champions host Celta Vigo later on Saturday. The capital club got off to a quick start in the local derby, as Koke collected Antoine Griezmann's pass and drove a low shot into the bottom corner to score his fourth goal of the campaign in the eighth minute. Getafe missed a chance to stay just two points adrift of seventh-placed Sevilla in the chase to qualify for the Europa League, as Fajr's 77th-minute spot-kick was kept out by Slovenian Oblak. Sevilla would have wrapped up a top-seven finish with victory in their derby at Real Betis, but Loren's equaliser with nine minutes to play snatched the home team a 2-2 draw. Managerless Sevilla, who reached this season's Champions League quarter-finals, now have to beat Alaves next weekend to secure a spot in Europe's second-tier competition. Elsewhere, Samu Castillejo scored twice as Villarreal beat relegated Deportivo La Coruna 4-2 to leapfrog Betis into fifth, with Denis Cheryshev also netting a day after being recalled to the preliminary Russian World Cup squad."

Barca striker Luis Suarez has spoken about Griezmann as though a deal has already been agreed, prompting Atletico's chief executive Miguel Angel Gil Marin to say they were ""fed up"" with the behaviour of the Catalan club. Griezmann could leave Atletico on a high by winning the Europa League final against Marseille next week. ""Griezmann is cheap, for sure, at 100 million euros in this market,"" Filipe said. ""It will seem even cheaper if he plays well in the final. That is the reality, but neither Griezmann, nor the rest of us, are thinking about this. After the final yes, but not before. ""We all want to win and it has no effect. We are delighted to play with him, but we are not just Griezmann, many players have worked hard to make this final. ""Without doubt he has been our most decisive player this season, so we want him to stay. But what happens afterwards is something completely separate from what happens this week."" Griezmann has scored 30 goals in 51 games this season, including a crucial away goal against Arsenal in the first leg of the Europa League semi-final. The Frenchman has formed a strong partnership with Diego Costa, who insists Griezmann's focus is currently on the final in Lyon. ""For a player, when Barca wants you, it makes you feel important,"" Costa said. ""But he knows that he is important for us and that we want him here. If then he leaves or not, it's his decision. ""I am very happy with him, with the group, and right now he is thinking of winning a title. If Griezman can make history here with us, win that title, then there's time after for him to decide what to do."""

The Atletico CEO said the club's stance was very clear. ""Not once have we negotiated for Griezmann nor do we have any intention to do so,"" he said in a statement issued on the team's official website. ""A few months ago, I personally expressed to Barcelona's president that our player isn't for sale nor are we going to sell him,"" he continued. ""At the same time, I let him know that his inappropriate conduct was against the integrity of the competition..."" The uncertainty over Griezmann's future could not have come at a worse time for Atletico as they prepare for next week's Europa League final against Marseille. Marin added: ""We're fed up with Barcelona's attitude. ""That a president, player and a board member speak the way they've done about the future of a player with an existing contract and just a few days before disputing a European final, is an absolute lack of respect towards Atletico."" He said Atletico would be demanding compensation from Barcelnoa should ""the player exercised his right to nullify his contract due to their pressure throughout the season"". He finished off by declaring ""enough is enough. I hope this statement serves its purpose and that us Atletico fans can enjoy this moment and prepare ourselves for a final like we should."" Marin's plea followed a report by Cadena Cope radio station that ""Barcelona have told Atletico Madrid they are going to pay Antonie Griezmann's get out clause. And Atletico know the player will be leaving at the end of the season"". That came after Atletico president Enrique Cerezo refused to clarify Griezmann's future after domestic media suggested Cerezo had met the player for dinner in a bid to persuade the Frenchman to stay at Atletico, with the promise of a bumper new contract. Cerezo has denied meeting Griezmann for talks but the Atletico president was also not definitive on the 27-year-old's future. ""I can tell you one thing: Antoine Griezmann is an Atletico Madrid player as of today,"" Cerezo said. ""I cannot tell you anything else because I do not know anything else.""

The Argentine watched Thursday's 1-0 home win in the return leg, which secured a 2-1 aggregate victory and a place in the final, from the directors' box at the Wanda Metropolitano. Simeone will now also miss the May 16 final in Lyon and his side's first two European matches of next season, while he was hit with a fine of 10,000 euros ($12,000). UEFA's disciplinary committee also charged Marseille after away supporters set off fireworks and threw objects during the second leg of their semi-final at Salzburg. Austria's Salzburg risk punishment themselves following a pitch invasion by fans and the throwing of objects, as well as a charge of improper conduct levied against club official Harald Lurzer. Marseille won the tie 3-2 on aggregate despite losing the second leg 2-1 after extra time. A decision on the cases will be made on May 31."
183,04/05/2018,03:30,'Clasico of honour' - Real look to crash unbeaten Barca's party,"Real Madrid can transform their own season by beating Liverpool in this month's Champions League final, and on Sunday they can dent Barcelona's by becoming the first team to defeat the Catalans in La Liga.","This 'clasico' at Camp Nou will have minimal impact on the league, with Barca already crowned champions and Real's passing interest in pipping Atletico to second place diminished by their ambitions in Europe. But there is still much at stake in what Madrid's daily newspaper Marca has billed ""the clasico of honour"". It could even be argued this match will go some way to defining the seasons of these two teams. Barca, in particular, have been careful in celebrating their domestic double, their players aware of the disappointment that lingers from their Champions League crash in the quarter-finals. Even as they ordered pizza and slurped beer from the top of their open-top bus down Las Ramblas this week, it was noticeable how many interviews still referenced the disappointment in Rome. ""The elimination in the Champions League, it hurt us because it was unexpected,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde. ""But it is very difficult to do what we have done and now what are we going to do? We keep trying."" To soften the blow, Barca's best response was to win the Copa del Rey and La Liga and finish unbeaten in the league for the first time, while hoping Real do not go all the way in the Champions League. The latter two are still to be decided. Real's march towards a 13th European triumph has certainly weighed heavily on Barcelona, whose sense of absence has been heightened by the progress of their rivals. ""It's amazing to be in a Champions League final for the third time in a row and have the chance to win it for the fourth time in the last five years,"" Real midfielder Toni Kroos said on Tuesday. ""It's hard for me to find words to describe that. When it comes to the Champions League, we have extra motivation."" Barca are looking to avoid defeat this weekend, and in their last three league games against Villarreal, Levante and Real Sociedad to seal a historic season. But if Real snatch a victory at the Camp Nou and also see off Liverpool, perhaps the balance is tipped in their favour. It will certainly be the last 'clasico' for Andres Iniesta as a player while Gareth Bale may also wave goodbye to this fixture, with the Welshman expected to consider his future at Real in the summer. The suggestion is both teams could give the departing Iniesta, Barca's captain, a guard of honour, even if Real refuse to do so for Barcelona's La Liga triumph. Bale was again a substitute against Bayern Munich on Tuesday, meaning he has now started only one of Real's six Champions League knock-out games. Zidane has been playing Bale, and resting key players, in La Liga matches but he is not likely to field a weakened team this weekend. Elsewhere, Sevilla will play their first match under their caretaker coach Joaquin Caparros on Friday against Real Sociedad. Vincenzo Montella was sacked after last weekend's loss to lowly Levante, which left the team eighth in the table and a point outside the Europa League qualification places. ""We have changed some subtle things but there is no time,"" Caparros said on Thursday. ""Our work with the players so far has been more than anything emotional."" Atletico Madrid, who are five points ahead of Real, host struggling Espanyol on Sunday."
184,04/05/2018,02:46,'Sad' Wenger defends Ozil after Atletico defeat,Arsene Wenger was left devastated by Arsenal's Europa League defeat to Atletico Madrid on Thursday but made a staunch defence of midfielder Mesut Ozil.,"Ozil's performance was heavily criticised by former Arsenal defender Martin Keown, who said the German had cried ""crocodile tears"" after the game, and was ""not fit to wear the shirt"". Diego Costa's strike proved decisive at the Wanda Metropolitano where a 1-0 victory secured Atletico a 2-1 win on aggregate and a place in the final against Marseille. Defeat ends Wenger's hopes of leaving Arsenal on a high as his team missed out on a shot at a major trophy and squandered their last chance to qualify for the Champions League. ""I'm very sad tonight,"" Wenger said. ""Unfortunately you have to go through that -- the game can be very cruel, sometimes very nice, but the suffering is very strong tonight. ""Looking at the chances over the two games the least we could say is we are very frustrated. The tie should have been over in the first game."" It remains to be seen how another season outside Europe's premier tournament will affect Arsenal's search both for a new coach, and new signings, this summer. ""The club now has to think about what to do for next season,"" Wenger said. ""I think there are some good ingredients in our team and they will bounce back. With the right additions in the summer I think they can compete next year."" Keown, however, was less optimistic and reserved a particularly harsh assessment for Ozil. ""He wasn't fit to wear the shirt tonight,"" Keown told BT Sport. ""I've seen this a lot this season and it needs to be said. He needs to be dug out. We expect better from him. ""These are crocodile tears I'm seeing from the player. He's not conning me."" Keown added: ""I bet he doesn't play again this season. He'll have some emotional breakdown and won't play this weekend."" When Keown's comments were put to Wenger, he said: ""I don't agree with that. You will see that he gave a lot. It was a difficult team, physically very intense. ""I'm convinced that Ozil should not be criticised by anyone just because he did not score. We had plenty of opportunities and we lose as a team."" Wenger also delivered an update on the fitness of Laurent Koscielny, who had to be carried off on a stretcher in the 12th minute after the defender went down, with nobody near him, clutching his left Achilles. Arsenal and France now face an anxious wait. ""It doesn't look very good, it's his Achilles,"" Wenger said. ""You can always hope for a miracle in the scan but if he has a ruptured Achilles, his chances for the World Cup are non-existent."" Costa was the star of the show, providing the tenacity and killer instinct Arsenal so desperately lacked. ""Costa came back here for nights like this,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone said. ""To be important, to lead from the front. This side needs an aggressive striker and that's exactly what he is."""

Arsenal's defence, fragile and nervous throughout, were particularly susceptible and this 1-0 defeat, 2-1 on aggregate, means Wenger's final season in charge will end with his team missing out on Champions League qualification for a second year in a row. For all his domestic achievements, Wenger will also depart without a European trophy to his name and it remains to be seen how sitting outside the continent's premier tournament will affect Arsenal's pursuit of a new coach, and players, this summer. ""I'm very sad tonight,"" Wenger said. ""Unfortunately you have to go through that - the game can be very cruel, sometimes very nice, but the suffering is very strong tonight."" More immediately, there was the concerning sight of Laurent Koscielny being carried off on a stretcher in the 12th minute after the defender went down, with nobody near him, clutching his left Achilles. ""It doesn't look very good, it's his Achilles,"" Wenger said. ""You can always hope for a miracle in the scan but if he has a ruptured Achilles, his chances for the World Cup are non-existent."" Koscielny's exit made a tough task all the more difficult for Arsenal, who were always going to be up against it at the Wanda Metropolitano, where Atletico have not lost in the league all season and not conceded a goal since January. It was perhaps also telling that Costa's physicality and Atletico's defensive rigour ultimately proved decisive, two qualities Wenger's Arsenal in recent years have so lacked. ""Costa came back here for nights like this,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone said. ""To be important, to lead from the front. This side needs an aggressive striker and that's exactly what he is."" Costa was hunting Arsenal's back four from the outset as he wrestled past Koscielny, knocked over Nacho Monreal before firing wide with only David Ospina to beat. Koscielny was substituted soon after, replaced by Calum Chambers, but Arsenal enjoyed one of their best spells midway through the half, dominating possession and reducing Atletico to a series of rushed clearances. At the back, however, they were shaky, as Ospina had balls booted out of his grasp by his teammates on more than one occasion while their passing out of the back was too often careless. By the end of the half, Atletico had regained the ascendancy and in injury-time, they struck. Granit Xhaka's weak header put Arsenal on the back foot and Antoine Griezmann threaded through to Costa. He held off Hector Bellerin with ease before coolly finishing past Ospina. Arsenal came again after the interval. Aaron Ramsey bundled his way through but the ball would not fall for him six yards out while Mesut Ozil flashed too sumptuous deliveries across the face of goal. Griezmann could have put the tie to bed after Costa had turned Shkodran Mustafi inside out but the defender recovered just in time to block. A vintage Costa performance would not be complete without a scuffle and he provided it when Mustafi tried too enthusiastically to grab the ball off him for a free-kick. Both players were booked and when Costa was substituted soon after, the striker was given a standing ovation. Arsenal piled forward late on in search of an equaliser but in truth, their night ended without them really creating a clear-cut chance. When the final whistle blew, Wenger marched straight down the tunnel as around him, Atletico's celebrations began."
186,04/05/2018,00:01,Koscielny doubtful for World Cup after Achilles injury,Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny looks set to miss the World Cup after the France international suffered an Achilles injury during Thursday's Europa League semi-final defeat by Atletico Madrid.,"The 32-year-old centre-back was stretchered off in tears after just 12 minutes of his side's 1-0 second-leg loss at the Wanda Metropolitano, with manager Arsene Wenger confirming he faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines. ""It doesn't look very good, it's his Achilles,"" said Wenger. ""You can always hope for a miracle in the scan but the first signs don't look very good. ""It looks that it could be ruptured but I am a bit cautious because nobody can say that just by looking at him. If he has a ruptured Achilles, his chances (for the World Cup) are non-existent. We will know more after the scan."" The injury is a big blow to France coach Didier Deschamps, with his side to begin their World Cup campaign on June 16 against Australia in Kazan. Koscielny has made 51 international appearances for France since making his debut in 2011 and has been a regular starter under Deschamps."
187,02/05/2018,20:25,Wenger admits Arsenal's future on the line in Europa League semi-final,Arsene Wenger wants a happy ending to his love story with Arsenal and admits their Europa League semi-final against Atletico Madrid on Thursday will affect the future of the club.,"Arsenal, adrift of the Premier League's top four, will have to win the tournament to qualify for the Champions League while defeat would mean Wenger's 22-year tenure ending on a dull note. Atletico are favourites, having secured a 1-1 draw and a precious away goal from the first leg in London last week. Diego Simeone's side have also not lost a La Liga game at home this season. ""I would like to finish my job well,"" Wenger said on Wednesday. ""I believe a man has to give his best as long as he is somewhere. ""With all my commitment and energy, I would like to walk out of Arsenal one day knowing that until the last day I focused only on Arsenal. ""When my job at Arsenal is finished I will see where I go from there but I want to finish this love story well."" Despite his domestic achievements, Wenger has never won a European trophy with Arsenal but perhaps just as important will be the legacy he leaves his successor. ""The next game is always the most important and this one because it influences the future of my club,"" Wenger said. ""It is a very, very big game for us because the future of Arsenal football club is not exactly the same if we qualify for the Champions League or not."" Atletico avoided defeat at the Emirates Stadium despite having Sime Vrsaljko sent off early on while Diego Costa will also return from injury for the second leg. ""In history Costa has shown he can make the difference,"" Wenger said. ""He played in England and was very successful. It is our job to keep him quiet."" Simeone will not be on the touchline at the Wanda Metropolitano after Atletico's coach was sent to the stands last week. ""I believe every manager has his own personality,"" Wenger said. ""He is doing extremely well at what he does."" Wenger confirmed David Ospina will continue in goal while Henrikh Mkhitaryan is hoping to overcome a knee problem."
188,29/04/2018,18:31,"Torres misses penalty, Gameiro scores one in Atletico win",Kevin Gamerio scored a second-half penalty just seven minutes after Fernando Torres had missed a spot-kick as Atletico Madrid claimed a 1-0 win at Alaves in La Liga on Sunday.,"Barcelona can secure the title later on Sunday if they avoid defeat at Deportivo La Coruna, but Diego Simeone's Atletico stayed in control of the race for second by moving four points clear of Real Madrid, who have a game in hand. Simeone rested several key players including Antoine Griezmann with Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg against Arsenal in mind, but the visitors did enough to edge to a first win in four games. Torres, who will leave the club for a second time at the end of the season, had an opportunity to open the scoring in the 71st minute, but saw his low penalty well saved by Alaves goalkeeper Fernando Pacheco. Former Real keeper Pacheco had only come on as a second-half substitute for Antonio Sivera after he had injured himself crashing into the post. But Atletico were awarded a second spot-kick when Mubarak Wakaso handled inside the area, and substitute Gameiro made no mistake to beat Pacheco and score his seventh league goal of the season. Winger Angel Correa was sent off for two injury-time bookings in the space of seconds after appearing to say something to the referee, but Atletico held on. The capital club's attentions will now turn to the clash with Arsenal at the Wanda Metropolitano as they look to reach a fifth European final in nine years after a 1-1 first-leg draw."
189,26/04/2018,23:19,Profligate Arsenal punished by 10-man Atletico Madrid,Arsenal's hopes of sending outgoing manager Arsene Wenger off with a trophy suffered a major blow as they could only draw 1-1 with 10-man Atletico Madrid in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final on Thursday.,"The Gunners played with an extra man for over 80 minutes at the Emirates Stadium, with Sime Vrsaljko's early red card handing them the initiative. However, they were made to rue a host of missed chances before and after Alexandre Lacazette headed them in front on the hour mark. Atletico coach Diego Simeone was also sent to the stands shortly after Vrsaljko's dismissal, but the Spaniards resisted manfully and pounced when their chance came as Antoine Griezmann prodded home a vital away goal eight minutes from time. Arsenal now need to become the first away team to score in 12 matches at Atletico's Wanda Metropolitano stadium next week if Wenger's last game in charge is to be the final in his homeland in Lyon on May 16. Moreover, Arsenal's hopes of Champions League football next season also hang on becoming the first side other than Real Madrid to eliminate Atletico from Europe for five seasons. There was a far more highly-charged atmosphere for Wenger's penultimate home game in charge than there had been for last weekend's game against West Ham United. And the hosts were given plenty of encouragement early on, even when still up against Atletico's full complement. Lacazette volleyed off the outside of the post and forced Jan Oblak into the first of a series of fine saves with a header from close range. Vrsaljko had been booked within two minutes for bringing down Jack Wilshere. And the Croatian left his side a man light after just 10 minutes when French referee Clement Turpin showed no leniency for another late challenge on Lacazette. Moments later, Simeone was also dismissed by the officious referee for taking his protests too far when an Arsenal player wasn't booked for what he thought was a similar foul. Atletico's excellent defensive record is what has carried them to five European semi-finals in seven seasons under Simeone. The visitors battened down the hatches with 10 men, but were reliant on Oblak to keep them in the tie. Wilshere headed straight at Oblak when unmarked at the back post at the end of a flowing Arsenal move. And the Slovenian then spread himself well with an outstretched leg to deny Danny Welbeck. Having weathered the Gunners' early storm, Atletico only began to threaten themselves late in the first half and David Ospina had to be alert to parry a fiercely struck Griezmann shot following a fine run from Thomas Partey. Atletico retreated ever deeper towards their own goal after the break and were finally punished on the hour mark when Wilshere's deep cross found Lacazette rising above Lucas Hernandez to head in his seventh goal in seven games. However, the French international and Arsenal could have had more. Laczette's dangerous ball across goal found no takers before he headed another good opportunity wide. And Arsenal paid heavily for their profligacy, and some comical defending, when Atletico grabbed a vital away goal on 82 minutes. Griezmann outmuscled French international team-mate Laurent Koscielny and then benefited from a slip by Shkodran Mustafi after his initial effort had been saved by Ospina to prod his 27th goal of the season into the roof of the net. There was still time for Oblak to show why Griezmann isn't the only Atletico player wanted by Europe's elite with a spectacular one-handed save to turn Aaron Ramsey's header behind and keep Los Rojiblancos on course for another European final."
190,25/04/2018,21:01,Diego Costa fit to terrorise Arsenal once more - Simeone,"Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone confirmed Diego Costa will be fit to resume his rivalry with Arsenal in a Europa League semi-final, first leg on Thursday of huge significance for the English side.","Arsenal are hoping to bid farewell to outgoing manager Arsene Wenger after 22 years in charge by winning the Frenchman's first European trophy, and securing qualification for next season's Champions League in the process. However, the formidable sight of Simeone's side stands in their way. Since the Argentine took charge in 2011, Atletico have reached five European semi-finals in seven seasons, winning the Europa League in 2012 and reaching the Champions League final in 2014 and 2016. Costa was a constant thorn in Arsenal's side during three years at Chelsea, scoring three times and losing just once in six meetings with the Gunners. But he has been sidelined since picking up a hamstring strain in Atletico's quarter-final, second leg at Sporting Lisbon. ""We will try to evaluate all the factors. We will speak among the doctors, himself and I to decide what the team needs most,"" said Simeone on whether Costa will start or kept in reserve from the bench. ""Yesterday he trained well and we will do what we deem to be right. ""In Spain and England there are many teams that have suffered because of his characteristics not just Arsenal."" In contrast to Arsenal, Atletico are already assured their place in next season's Champions League as they sit second, ahead of Real Madrid, in La Liga. However, despite punching above their weight against the might of Barcelona and Real Madrid under Simeone, Atletico haven't won a trophy since 2014. Winning the Europa League in Simeone's first season in charge in 2012 set the platform to win La Liga two years later, and he hopes recreating that winning feeling will spark another era of success. ""Being a champion is different and the best teams in the world get stronger because of it,"" he added. ""It gave us the conviction and certainty that we were on the right road. Then the other titles came: Copa del Rey, La Liga, Spanish and European Super Cups, the two lost (Champions League) finals. ""Now it has been a while since we won a trophy, but we keep trying."" Wenger also enjoyed great success in his first decade in charge of Arsenal, winning three Premier League titles. However, despite growing frustration from Arsenal fans over their inability to compete for the Premier League or Champions League in recent seasons, Simeone was glowing in his praise for Wenger's durability. ""I have admiration for a great professional. To be able stay so long at such a big club he had to reinvent himself. ""I still think of myself as a young coach. I try to observe, learn and admire (his work). Coaches are always open (to criticism) and the place he has held in world football is marvellous."""
191,25/04/2018,16:44,Simeone and Wenger go head to head in a battle of the old-timers,Arsenal's Europa League semi-final against Atletico Madrid on Thursday will be a clash of styles as stark as they come but Arsene Wenger and Diego Simeone are anything but polar opposites.,"Arsenal will flood forward at Emirates Stadium while Atletico will sit back; Arsenal will dominate possession, Atletico will counter; Arsenal will risk leaving gaps and Atletico will do everything they can to close them. ""We have a style that does not vary much,"" Simeone said last month. ""We usually play one way, with the same idea."" Wenger may share little common ground with Simeone on how best to win matches but there is no coach in the game that knows better the sense of identity and attachment to a club, which the Frenchman is now in the process of curtailing. ""I'm staying because this club has a future and that future is us,"" Simeone said at the end of last season, before extending his contract to 2020 in September. If he sees it through, he will have been in charge at Atleti for almost nine years, still 13 short of Wenger´s 22 but far closer in terms of status, impact and legacy. His standing is enhanced by two stints and five years playing for Los Rojiblancos, the first spell yielding a league and cup double in 1996, when Simeone was the captain. When they next won the Copa del Rey in 2013 and La Liga in 2014, Simeone was the coach. The cult of Simeone at Atletico is also powerful because it is unusual. In December 2011, he was their 12th appointment in 10 years and fifth in the last two. Like Wenger, he has brought stability, but in a club where previously there was none. Like Wenger too, Simeone enjoys casting Atletico as underdogs, up against rivals with far greater resources and far less concern for long-term thinking. ""What we cannot do is forget the reality of the numbers,"" Simeone said, after his side lost 1-0 to Barcelona last month. ""In 14 years Madrid and Barca have always won the league, 13 times in 14 years. We made possible the impossible once but it is clear that it will not happen every year."" They nabbed the La Liga title in 2014, an astonishing achievement, but Atletico´s priority has been qualification for the Champions League, particularly during the club´s switch to its new stadium, a move completed at the start of this season. When chief executive Miguel Angel Gil paid a rare visit to the club´s training ground earlier this month, his message was clear. ""Qualify for the Champions League,"" Simeone said. ""He has been telling me that for five years."" Wenger once suggested a top-four finish was akin to winning a trophy and he knows the challenges of leaving a long-held home, both psychological and financial. Many suspected Simeone would leave after Atletico departed the Vicente Calderon but he has stayed to oversee the transition while enduring the club selling some of its most expensive stars to make it work. Radamel Falcao, Mario Mandzukic, Diego Costa and Filipe Luis have all been allowed to leave for big sums. It remains to be seen whether Antoine Griezmann and Jan Oblak follow suit this summer. And there is Simeone and Wenger themselves, each symbols of their respective clubs but both at their least comfortable when discussing personal achievements. Simeone prefers to divert focus onto his players and the next game, just as Wenger has tried to do since announcing he will leave Arsenal at the end of the season. Atletico, and Simeone, stand in the way of a potentially glorious farewell. ""In the end, it is the pitch that talks,"" Simeone said. ""And when the pìtch talks, all the coach does is listen."""
192,25/04/2018,15:43,Wenger admits timing of Arsenal exit was out of his hands,Arsene Wenger admitted Wednesday that the timing of his departure from Arsenal after more than two decades as manager was not his call.,"The 68-year-old Frenchman -- who guided the Gunners to two domestic doubles and masterminded the 2004 ""Invincibles"", as well as winning a record seven FA Cups -- will hand over the reins to a new manager after this season. Wenger announced on Friday he would be stepping down a year before the end of his contract after another failure to sustain a Premier League title challenge. The club, in sixth place in the league, are desperate to win the Europa League as a way back into the Champions League next season. Wenger, speaking to the press ahead of Thursday's semi-final first leg against Atletico Madrid, made it clear he had not been in charge of his destiny. ""The timing was not really my decision,"" said the Arsenal boss, who added that he did not envisage retiring from the game. ""At the moment I do my job, keep my routine and focus on what I have to do every day,"" added the Frenchman, who is targeting his first European trophy. ""At the moment I work like ever. You are never sure you do the right thing, but life is interesting because you have to deal with different situations. People want to know what the future is about, for me that is completely normal. ""I honestly don't know what I will do. Will I take a little rest? I will continue to work, that is for sure. At the moment I'm not ready to commit to anything else."" Wenger said he would have no say as to who succeeds him but spoke highly of former Barcelona coach Luis Enrique. ""I don't want to influence the next manager, but of course I have a high opinion of Luis Enrique."" Wenger, who revealed former rival Alex Ferguson called him on Tuesday, said he wanted a Hollywood-style ending for the players more than for himself. ""Is there a perfect goodbye? I don't know. I just want to do as well as I can,"" said Wenger. ""This group of players deserve something special and I want to do it for them, to achieve something with them. ""My biggest satisfaction would be to be successful with the players we have."" Wenger will go into his final European home game as Arsenal boss with the boost of having Mesut Ozil, Jack Wilshere and Petr Cech available. The trio missed the weekend win over West Ham with minor problems but all trained on Wednesday. Wenger is also hopeful that Henrikh Mkhitaryan could recover from a knee injury to feature in the second leg in Madrid next week but Mohamed Elneny is out for the rest of the season."

194,25/04/2018,01:30,Europa League offers last chance for Wenger to sign off a winner,Arsenal have little time to digest Arsene Wenger's long-awaited decision to end his 22-year reign as a Europa League semi-final with Atletico Madrid offers the outgoing manager a chance to salvage some of his lost credit with the club's fans.,"Wenger admitted he stepped aside to unite a fanbase fed up with years of mediocre results having been spoiled by success and silky football in the first decade of the Frenchman's reign. Fourteen years on from Arsenal's last Premier League title, for so long Wenger could defend his record by consistent qualification for the Champions League. However, a 19-year run in Europe's premier club competition came to an end this season and Arsenal's only chance of qualifying for next season's Champions League is by winning the Europa League. To do so, though, Wenger will need to achieve something that he couldn't even manage in his peak years in charge -- win a European trophy. His two final losses in the 2000 UEFA Cup to Galatasaray and against Barcelona in the 2006 Champions League, allied to a Cup Winners' Cup final defeat by Werder Bremen when manager of Monaco in 1992, handed him the ignominy of being the only manager ever to reach the finals of all three European club competitions and lose every one. Winning three FA Cups in the last four years did little to appease Arsenal fans' demand for change. However, Wenger's legacy will be looked on far more kindly if be could bow out in his homeland next month in Lyon by guaranteeing Champions League football for his successor. ""I'm happy now we can all talk about his legacy and let's not forget that we still have to win the Europa League,"" said Arsenal's all-time top goalscorer Thierry Henry on the day Wenger announced his departure. ""Let's not get lost in celebrating the end of his era. The team has to win the Europa League. It would be an amazing achievement and Arsene never won in Europe before so it would be a great way to give him a good exit."" Hopes that Wenger's announcement would galvanise the support for the final few weeks of his reign were confounded by a subdued atmosphere for Sunday's 4-1 win over West Ham at the Emirates. But Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis insisted there will be ""an electric atmosphere"" on Thursday night with far more at stake for the club. The hosts are likely to need to feed off some positive energy from the stands to build a lead to take to Madrid in a week's time against European specialists Atletico. Since Diego Simeone took charge seven years ago, Atletico have reached five European semi-finals, and have only been eliminated by bitter rivals Real Madrid for the past four seasons in the Champions League. With Atletico sitting comfortably in second in La Liga and already assured of Champions League football next season, Simeone was able to ease the physical toil on a small squad by resting a number of key players for Sunday's 0-0 draw with Real Betis. That was Atletico's 11th straight clean sheet at the Wanda Metropolitano to emphasise Arsenal's need to take a first-leg lead to Spain. However, the Gunners' chances were not aided by the inclusion of an old foe in Diego Costa in the Atletico squad as he looks set to shrug off a hamstring injury. Costa scored four goals in six previous appearances against Arsenal in three years at Chelsea."
195,22/04/2018,22:59,Atletico draw to leave Barcelona even closer to title,"Atletico Madrid warmed up for their Europa League clash with Arsenal by playing out a 0-0 draw with in-form Betis in La Liga on Sunday, a result that left Barcelona closer still to the Spanish title.","Antoine Griezmann was left out of the starting line-up by coach Diego Simeone and Atletico drew a second blank in four days, following their 3-0 defeat away at Real Sociedad on Thursday. Atletico remain second but with four games left they are 11 points behind unbeaten La Liga leaders Barcelona, who can clinch the title next weekend when they go to Deportivo. Barcelona won the Copa del Rey at Atletico's Wanda Metropolitano with a 5-0 rout of Sevilla on Saturday, but there was decidedly less drama at the same stadium 24 hours later. Saul Niguez struck the woodwork for Atletico in the second half, not long after Cristian Tello had hit the post for Betis at the other end. Griezmann came off the bench just after the hour mark, but Simeone's side could not get the breakthrough and they are four points clear of third-placed Real Madrid, who have a game in hand having not played this weekend. Atletico head to London for their Europa League semi-final first leg against Arsenal on Thursday. Betis, meanwhile, consolidate their hold on fifth place after extending their unbeaten run to seven games. European football seems a certainty now for them next season. Elsewhere on Sunday, Las Palmas had their relegation from La Liga confirmed following an emphatic 4-0 defeat at home to Alaves. The club from Gran Canaria needed a win to keep alive their slim hopes of staying in Spain's top flight for a fourth straight season. However, they suffered a fifth successive defeat in front of a sparse crowd on a wet Sunday in the Canary Islands, with Barcelona loanee Munir El Haddadi's second-half brace having Alaves in control before Alvaro Medran and Ruben Sobrino added late goals. They are the second team to be relegated from La Liga after bottom club Malaga's fate was sealed in midweek."
196,18/04/2018,18:30,Atletico must prove to Griezmann he does not need to leave - Simeone,Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone admits his club must show they can match Antoine Griezmann's ambition if they want to hold onto the striker this summer.,"Griezmann has scored 19 goals in 22 games since the turn of the year and continues to be linked with Barcelona, who denied publically in January they had struck a deal to sign the Frenchman. After claiming last summer there was a ""7/10 chance"" he would join Manchester United, Griezmann signed a one-year contract extension at Atletico. The deal, however, retained his release clause, reported to be set at 100 million euros ($124 million). ""We want the best for Griezmann. We must make him see that this team can continue to grow, and hopefully we will,"" Simeone said on Wednesday. Second-placed Atletico trail leaders Barca by 12 points in La Liga and while that gap can be cut to nine if they beat Real Sociedad on Thursday, it would take a stunning collapse for the Catalans not to be crowned champions. It means Simeone's side are left chasing silverware in the Europa League, where they face Arsenal in the first leg of the semi-finals next week, but even winning that tournament might not convince Griezmann to stay. ""We have to show our ambitions are real, they are not just words,"" Simeone continued. ""If we continue fighting with Barcelona and go until the end in the Europa League, we will ensure that every year something good happens. ""We have to give our team all the tools so that when a player has to decide, they will want to continue with us."" Griezmann has remained tight-lipped over his future in recent weeks but told French newspaper L'Equipe in March he wanted any uncertainty resolved before the start of the World Cup. The 27-year-old is expected to be France's leading striker in Russia. ""I want to go to Russia with a clear conscience and anyway, I think that is what everybody wants,"" Griezmann said. ""I have told my sister (his agent) whether it be staying or leaving, it has to be solved before the World Cup."""
197,15/04/2018,18:30,Torres and Griezmann on target as Atletico stroll past Levante,Fernando Torres marked the announcement of his Atletico Madrid departure with a goal after coming off the bench to score in a 3-0 win over Levante on Sunday.,"Six days after confirming he will be leaving his boyhood club at the end of the season, Torres rolled back the years with a volleyed finish the 34-year-old would have been proud of in his prime. It was also his 100th La Liga goal. Torres' grievance this term has been a lack of playing time and he was a substitute again at the Wanda Metropolitano, replacing Antoine Griezmann, who was also on target. Angel Correa opened the scoring in the first half. A comfortable victory cuts the gap behind leaders Barcelona back to 11 points and restores some momentum for Atletico, with their Europa League semi-final against Arsenal less than a fortnight away. Victory also guaranteed Atletico a place in the Champions League next season. This was something of a free hit for Levante, who stay 17th, five points clear of the relegation zone. Diego Simeone's side face Real Sociedad on Thursday and Real Betis on Sunday before the first leg at Emirates Stadium but they arrived here with only two wins from their last five matches. Torres enjoyed the biggest cheer of the afternoon and followed his brilliant finish by blowing the crowd a kiss and waving both hands. It promises to be a long farewell. The Spaniard is unlikely to face Arsenal but Griezmann almost certainly will and his goal was his 19th in La Liga this season, coming without Diego Costa, who is still nursing a thigh strain. Atletico shaded the first half without creating too many clear-cut chances. But the visitors' resistance was broken in the 33rd minute when Vitolo weaved inside to the edge of the penalty area and slipped the ball left to Correa. Correa surprised the cluster of shuffling defenders by cutting back onto his right foot before using the space to guide the ball into the corner. Griezmann was convinced he should have had a penalty before half-time when he ended a one-on-one by toppling over the hand of goalkeeper Oier Olazabal. The touch, however, was not only feint, but engineered by Griezmann's dragging right foot, and the Frenchman was booked for diving. Complaints turned to celebrations after the interval, as Sime Vrsaljko volleyed in a cross first time from the right and Griezmann finished first time into the top corner. That was his last significant contribution, before making way for Torres just before the hour, and Koke was also spared the last 30 minutes, replaced by Gabriel Fernandez. Simeone's confidence was clear but Torres had the final say, the veteran sweeping home an instinctive volley from Correa's cross to wrap up a routine win."
198,13/04/2018,12:40,Arsenal face Atletico Madrid in Europa League semi-final,"Arsenal were handed a mouth-watering clash against tournament favourites Atletico Madrid in Friday's draw for the semi-finals of the Europa League, meaning the clubs will meet for the first time.","French giants Marseille will play Salzburg, a club backed by soft drinks giant Red Bull, in the other semi-final. Arsene Wenger's Arsenal will play the first leg at home at the Emirates Stadium against Atletico, led by French striker Antoine Griezmann, who are looking to win the competition for the third time in a decade. Wenger, whose side play Manchester United away in the Premier League between the two legs of the semi-final, had identified Atletico, Champions League finalists in 2014 and 2016, as the most dangerous side in the draw. ""Everybody speaks about Atletico Madrid that they look the strongest team on paper,"" he said. It will be Arsenal's first European semi-final since 2009. The first legs will take place on April 26 with the return games on May 3. ""They are a similar kind of club to us,"" Atletico director Clemente Villaverde said at the draw at UEFA's headquarters in Nyon. ""Arsenal are a great team, they're up there every year fighting for trophies and getting deep into their European competitions,"" he said. Arsenal reached the last four after surviving a scare against CSKA Moscow in Thursday's quarter-final second leg in the Russian capital. Danny Welbeck and Aaron Ramsey both scored late in the game for Arsenal to calm nerves after CSKA had raced into a 2-0 lead on the night. A 2-2 draw saw the London side through 6-3 on aggregate. Atletico lost 1-0 to Sporting in Lisbon on Thursday but advanced 2-1 on aggregate. Diego Costa, who returned to the club from Chelsea earlier this season, could be a doubt for the first leg after Atletico confirmed he had suffered a hamstring injury in the game in Portugal. He was substituted early in the second half. British bookmakers William Hill make Atletico hot favourites to win the competition, but explained why Arsenal fans still have reason for optimism. ""It could be argued that Arsenal need this more than Atletico as a route into the Champions League next season,"" said William Hill spokesman Joe Crilly. ""Their Europa League form has been in stark contrast to their Premier League form during the second half of this season and they have every chance of progressing,"" Crilly said. Sitting sixth in the Premier League, only winning the final in Lyon on May 16 will take the Gunners into the Champions League next season. Marseille would love to make it to a final being played on French soil after making it through to a first European semi since 2004. They produced a stirring comeback to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit and beat German side RB Leipzig 5-3 on aggregate in their quarter-final. Marseille will be at home in the first leg against 1994 finalists Salzburg, who produced the shock result of Thursday night by defeating Italian side Lazio 4-1 at home to win 6-5 on aggregate. Salzburg have already beaten Marseille once in the competition this season, a 1-0 victory in Austria. The teams also drew 0-0 at the Velodrome in the group stage. ""But this time it's the semi-final so it'll be different,"" Marseille director Andoni Zubizarreta told beIN Sports. The former Spain goalkeeper refused to accept it was an easy draw however. ""The four clubs have worked a lot to reach the semi-finals and yesterday Salzburg were very strong against Lazio,"" Zubizarreta insisted in reference to the four goals Salzburg hit past the Romans on Thursday."
199,09/04/2018,15:18,Torres to leave Atletico at end of season,"Fernando Torres has confirmed this season will be his last playing for Atletico Madrid, the striker's boyhood club.","Torres enjoys hero status at Atletico, where he came through the ranks as a teenager and made his first-team debut, aged 17 in 2001. But, after spells away at Liverpool, Chelsea and AC Milan, the 34-year-old's second stint in the Spanish capital has largely been as a back-up. Torres has started only three La Liga games this season under coach Diego Simeone. ""I'd like to take this opportunity to confirm that this is my last season at the club,"" Torres said on Monday. ""I felt I should let the fans know, as they have given me so much love and affection. ""Both the club and I knew that this moment was going to come. I think it is the best moment, accepting the reality that I am in, you see the prominence that I have in the team and maybe it is time to make way for others."" Torres scored 76 league goals during his first five seasons at Atletico and after making an emotional return, he had hoped to retire at the club. In between, a superb four years at Liverpool had been followed by difficult periods at both Chelsea and Milan, where Torres never rediscovered his lethal touch. ""For me it is very difficult to say goodbye to this club for the second time, because my head and my idea was to hang up my boots here,"" Torres said. ""But things do not always work out the way you want. I feel very well and I want to continue playing. I do not know if in two, three or five years I'll look for a different situation. ""I do not have any team or competition (decided), since we have made the decision not long ago. So now we listen to the proposals and among these proposals we will have to decide."" It has been suggested that Torres does not see eye-to-eye with Simeone, who is also something of an icon at Atleti, having played for five years there, before coaching the team to the La Liga title in 2014. ""My relationship with Simeone is normal, it's professional,"" Torres said. ""I've always said that I'm not going to participate in any division with Simeone. There is no problem with the coach, nor with anyone in the club, it's a decision that is exclusively mine."" Torres was struggling at Chelsea when Atleti won the league four years ago, meaning the only trophy he has lifted with the club is a Segunda Division title in 2002. Atletico, however, are strong favourites in this season's Europa League and the possibility remains that the forward will sign off after a victorious final in Lyon on May 16. Torres has scored 113 goals in 330 appearances for Atletico. He also won the World Cup with Spain in 2010, as well as the European Championships in 2008 and 2012. ""This second stage (at Atletico) has been magnificent,"" Torres said. ""I have lived magical moments and I am sure that I have others to live."""
200,08/04/2018,19:54,Ronaldo continues goal spree but Real held by stubborn Atletico,Cristiano Ronaldo's 24th goal in 15 games for Real Madrid this year was not enough to earn his side a derby victory on Sunday as an Antoine Griezmann equaliser secured Atletico a 1-1 draw.,"Ronaldo followed up last week's brilliant bicycle kick against Juventus with a poacher's finish at the Santiago Bernabeu but Griezmann's strike keeps Atletico in pole position to finish second in La Liga. They retain their four-point cushion over Real while this was perhaps the perfect result for leaders Barcelona, who are now 11 points clear at the top. It not only tightens Barca's grip on the title but will likely bring forward the point when the Catalans are mathematically certain to be champions, with the 'clasico' still a possible coronation day on May 6. ""We deserved more today clearly, it's a shame,"" Real coach Zinedine Zidane said afterwards. ""We had many chances, but in the end we could have lost the game as well."" Griezmann's goal came on his 200th appearance for Atleti while Ronaldo's was the 500th in the 161 league matches played between these two city rivals. On Griezmann, Atletico coach Diego Simeone said: ""He is a great player, he did not have a good start to the season and he knows it and it is not easy to reinvent himself in the way he did in November, December. ""I think the presence of (Diego) Costa has helped him a lot, having strength around him which allows him to be free."" In comparison to recent versions of this fixture, which have included Champions League finals, Cope del Rey finals and league games with both sides vying for the championship, this at times had a rather low-key feel. Zidane, with one eye on the Champions League quarter-final second leg against Juventus on Wednesday, started with Luka Modric and Karim Benzema on the bench, the latter coming on to spare Ronaldo the final half an hour. Los Blancos own a 3-0 advantage over Juve but Zidane insists they cannot afford to be complacent. ""Everyone sees us going through to the semi-finals and that's exactly what we should not put in our head,"" Zidane said. ""We know very well that we will have to suffer again on Wednesday."" Gareth Bale was given 90 minutes, perhaps not the most positive indicator for his chances of a start in midweek. The Welshman supplied the cross for Ronaldo's equaliser but, in truth, he was quiet for long periods here, a pale shadow of his confident, marauding best. A game that looked in danger of drifting towards a stalemate sparked into life after half-time with two goals in four minutes. Ronaldo scored the first as Bale's hanging cross was misjudged by Lucas Hernandez at the back post, allowing the striker to volley in his 23rd league goal of the season. But Atleti were soon level. Griezmann slipped in Lucas and then continued his run so he was perfectly placed to slide home the rebound after Keylor Navas had parried. Real were more aggressive in the search for a late winner but Atleti dug in. Bale almost had it but put a difficult header wide, while Sergio Ramos nodded past from a corner and saw his curling free-kick tipped over by Jan Oblak. If only Ronaldo had still been on the field to take it."
201,08/04/2018,14:13,Griezmann denies Barcelona deal is done,"Atletico Madrid striker Antoine Griezmann denied he had decided to join Barcelona next season, saying in an interview aired on French television on Sunday that such reports ""were not good information"".","Told by a reporter on TF1 that ""according to our information you are going to sign"", the French international replied: ""I don't where your information comes from but, for now, there's nothing."" TF1 insisted, nevertheless, that ""talks are well advanced"" between the Catalan giants and the 27-year-old Frenchman. Griezmann, who has a 100-million euro ($123m) buyout clause in his contract, said last month that he would decide on a move before the World Cup which starts on June 14. Last year he said that there was ""a six in ten chance"" he would move to Manchester United only to sign a contract extension with Atletico."
202,06/04/2018,01:50,Costa back at Bernabeu for Atletico against Real,"Diego Costa will walk out for his eighth Madrid derby on Sunday, four years since his last at the Santiago Bernabeu when he scored Atletico's winner.","Gareth Bale was making his home debut for Real that day back in September 2013, in the same week that Spain requested approval to snatch Costa from the clutches of Brazil and call him up to the national squad. As he celebrated, Real's fans chanted ""Costa - he is not Spanish"". All the more striking then that Costa's shot, guided past Diego Lopez and inside the far right-hand post, still remains his only goal against Real, and the 1-0 win his sole triumph against Atletico's fiercest rivals. His record heading into this weekend's derby reads played seven, won one, scored one. If Costa is looking for positive omens, however, he might draw a parallel between his initiation with Spain in 2013 and the completion of his renaissance with the national team last week. After spending the first five months of this season exiled by Chelsea, Costa is back in favour with Julen Lopetegui and back in form, for club and country. His goal in Spain's 6-1 win over Argentina has thrust him into pole position to start up front at this summer's World Cup, while his opposites-attract partnership with Antoine Griezmann has been the driving force behind Atletico's march into second place. That position, however, is what is at stake this weekend, with both sides now too far adrift to catch runaway leaders Barcelona and neither in any danger of slipping out of the Champions League spots. Atletico own the four-point advantage but Real have the momentum, having won 11 out of their last 12, a streak that includes two wins over Paris Saint-Germain and Tuesday's thumping of Juventus. Cristiano Ronaldo was the star in Turin, his spectacular bicycle kick continuing the Portuguese's astonishing goal flurry this year. He has scored 23 times in 14 games, and at least once in all of his last nine. Unlike Costa, Ronaldo is well-tuned to this fixture too. He has six goals in his last five meetings with Atletico. Bale, meanwhile, was caught stoney-faced on the substitutes bench while the Juve fans stood to salute Ronaldo's brilliance but the out-of-favour Welshman may be given a run-out this weekend. Zinedine Zidane has been prepared to use Bale in the league, where it seems the issue of his defensive resilience is less pronounced. Barcelona's players will be able to watch the derby safe in the knowledge that any result strengthens their grip on the title. The Catalans host 14th-placed Leganes on Saturday, already nine points ahead of Atletico and 13 in front of Real. If they avoid defeat, Ernesto Valverde's team will equal the Spanish record of 38 unbeaten league matches, set by Real Sociedad across two seasons in 1978/79 and 1979/80. Lionel Messi is likely to play, having come through Wednesday's 4-1 win over Roma unscathed after his niggling hamstring problem. Sergio Busquets, however, still felt pain at the Camp Nou from his previously broken toe and may be rested. Elsewhere, the league's four bottom sides go head-to-head as Levante, with a seven-point cushion over the relegation places, host 18th-placed Las Palmas. On Friday, Deportivo La Coruna are at home to already-doomed Malaga. The race for Europa Legue qualification also continues on Saturday as Sevilla travel to Celta Vigo and Real Betis entertain Eibar. Villarreal face Athletic Bilbao on Monday. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
203,01/04/2018,23:02,"Gameiro penalty edges Atletico past Deportivo, closer to Barca",Atletico Madrid cut the gap behind Barcelona to nine points in La Liga after Kevin Gameiro's penalty sealed a 1-0 win over Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday.,"Barca's 2-2 draw at Sevilla on Saturday gave Atletico a rare chance to reduce the Catalans' lead at the top, which they took with a hard-fought victory at the Wanda Metropolitano. Gameiro made no mistake from the spot in the 34th minute after referee Daniel Trujillo adjudged Atletico's Saul had been pulled down by Pedro Mosquera. While Diego Simeone's men still require a Barcelona collapse with only eight games left, Deportivo are also in need of a miracle to avoid relegation. They remain 19th and eight points adrift of safety. Elsewhere on Sunday, Valencia took one step closer to Champions League qualification after Spanish World Cup hopeful Rodrigo Moreno scored in a 1-0 win over Leganes. Their victory became even more valuable after Villarreal slipped to a 1-0 defeat by Malaga, giving Valencia a 15-point cushion in fourth place. Gonzalo Castro was the match-winner for Malaga, with a first-half penalty. Espanyol and Alaves played out a 0-0 draw while Eibar were also held to a stalemate by Real Sociedad."
204,21/03/2018,15:43,The best for Griezmann would be to stay at Atletico - Costa,Diego Costa has told team-mate Antoine Griezmann he is best off staying at Atletico Madrid.,"Griezmann has scored 23 goals in 38 appearances for Atletico this season and said on Wednesday he wants his future sorted before the start of this year´s World Cup. The French forward told L´Equipe he hopes ""to travel to Russia without concern"" after Barcelona were forced in January to deny they had already struck a deal to sign the player. Manchester United were also credited with a strong interest last summer. Costa, however, who left Atletico for Chelsea in 2014 only to return to the Spanish club earlier this season, believes his current striker partner should stay put. ""He knows that we want him, that he is a very important player. He is still with us and he has not told me he is going yet,"" Costa said on Wednesday. ""I would be happy for him to stay, everyone has to look for the best for themselves but, in my opinion, the best for him is to stay."" Costa added, with a smile: ""He called me every day to tell me to return to Atletico and now he's not going to leave me. That cannot be, he is going to stay."" Spain coach Julen Lopetegui appears to have put his faith in Costa to be the team´s leading striker this summer. A strong run of form for Atletico, alongside Griezmann, has included three goals in Costa´s last seven appearances while Chelsea´s Alvaro Morata, his chief rival, has been left out of Spain´s latest squad. It marks a stark contrast to the start of the season when Costa, sidelined by Chelsea manager Antonio Conte, was left killing time in Brazil, and Morata began his Premier League career with eight goals in as many games. ""It is very clear that it was not my fault that I was in Brazil. We all know what happened there but I'm back now and I want to do my best,"" Costa said. ""The (Spain) coach was always very clear with me that if I was not playing then it would be impossible for me to be called up. But he also said that if I was playing well then the door would be open to me and I'm grateful to him for that."" On Morata´s omission, Costa added: ""I miss Morata because we get on well. Competition is always good. Morata has been having a bad time there (at Chelsea) but he is back now scoring goals and I hope he comes back with us and we can play together."" Spain play Germany in Dusseldorf on Friday before hosting Argentina in a second friendly in Madrid on Tuesday."

But hours later he suffered a broken leg in Atletico's Europa League tie at Lokomotiv Moscow. He underwent surgery in Madrid on Friday and returned home on Saturday. ""His absence is estimated at eight weeks,"" Atletico said in a press release. That would put his return some time in mid-May, meaning he would not play for Atletico again this season and giving him little time to rediscover his form and fitness ahead of the World Cup which begins on June 14."
206,15/03/2018,19:26,Torres strikes twice as Atletico thrash Lokomotiv,Fernando Torres scored twice as Atletico Madrid romped to a 5-1 Europa League thrashing of Lokomotiv Moscow in Russia on Thursday to complete a resounding last-16 victory.,"Diego Simeone's side wrapped up an 8-1 win on aggregate to book a place in Friday's quarter-final draw. Leading 3-0 from last week's first leg, Angel Correa extended the advantage early on before Maciej Rybus levelled on the night for Russian league leaders Lokomotiv. But the La Liga title challengers opened up in the second half, with Saul Niguez scoring their fifth of the tie before Torres' quickfire double. The striker slotted in his first European goal of the season from the penalty spot in the 65th minute, before slotting home unmarked just five minutes later. Antoine Griezmann came off the bench to round off the scoring in style, with the Frenchman dinking a delicious lob into the far top corner from Correa's lay-off after the Argentinian had created the chance by flicking the ball over a defender's head."
207,09/03/2018,12:28,Russian clubs' blame European defeats on winter break,Three top Russian clubs blamed the protracted winter break on defeats in the Europa League on Thursday.,"CSKA Moscow, Zenit St Petersburg and Lokomotiv Moscow all said the three-month recess had hampered their preparations for the last 16 first leg ties. ""We've played only four matches after the winter break,"" Zenit's former Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic said after a 2-1 loss in Leipzig. ""It was hard to prepare for this match properly because it's very difficult to find a quality pitch to train on in Saint Petersburg at this time of the year. ""Now we need to forget this match and to focus on our match on Sunday at Rostov, which, I believe, will also be very difficult,"" he said. CSKA Moscow, beaten 1-0 at home by French side Lyon, also reproached the wintry weather and the poor condition of the pitch at their home venue for their lacklustre performance. ""It's not a good result for a home match,"" CSKA playmaker Alan Dzagoev told Russian TV after the match. ""Our venue's service staff did everythng they could to prepare the pitch for the match but it wasn't enough at such a (bad) weather. ""We've all failed to show our best today as it was very hard to perform creative and skilled football at the pitch of such (a low) quality."" Dzagoev also expressed hope that the pitch at Grozny, where CSKA will face Terek on Sunday, will be in much better condition. Russian league table-toppers Lokomotiv Moscow also blamed lack of match practice after the winter break and the absence of their Peruvian midfielder Jefferson Farfan and Brazilian forward Ari, who were both sidelined with injuries, for their 3-0 drubbing at Atletico Madrid. ""We've played against a very strong team that always perform at their top and never reserve their strength,"" managers Yury Semin told the club's website. ""We've made too many mistakes and paid the price for it. But we've played just a couple of games since the winter break. Besides, we played without two of our team's first-choice players."" Semin also said that Lokomotiv will need to focus on their match at Ural Yekaterinburg which he considered to be very important for his team, seeking their third domestic title ever and first since 2004. The railway-backed outfit have a seven-point lead at the top over second-placed Krasnodar, who tackle strugglers Dynamo Moscow on Saturday. Reigning champions Spartak, CSKA and Zenit St Petersburg are all one point further back."

Griezmann has been in sparkling form in recent weeks. The Frenchman has scored seven goals in his last two matches and 12 in his last nine. ""Antoine is an extraordinary footballer and when he is at his level like this, he is one of the best, and it is clear that in his present position he is in the perfect place,"" Simeone said on Saturday. ""Except for the five months when he joined and the beginning of this season, he has always been very consistent and to be consistent in football is very difficult. ""Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, they become what they are by having continuity, they do not get tired of scoring goals, they do not get tired of winning titles, and this is the goal of those who are pushing to get closer to this place."" Atletico against Barcelona has been billed as a battle between Griezmann and Messi, who himself has 34 goals already this season. Simeone admitted there is no plan that can fully contain the Argentinian forward. ""Having a footballer like Lionel, who is in an extraordinary moment, it is clear that there is no strategy that can control something that we all want to control,"" Simeone said. ""It is impossible because what he has is something natural."" For Barcelona, the challenge is to regain momentum and confidence, following Thursday's 1-1 draw at Las Palmas. Ernesto Valverde's men looked uncatchable when they pulled 11 points clear at the top in January but a patchy run of form has given Atletico hope. ""It is a situation where we have to live with this intention and give everything to win the game, because the prize is very juicy, for us to be ahead of second by eight points,"" Valverde said. ""In this we have to focus. They will also think: 'we can get to two'. If we draw everything remains the same, but whoever wins makes an important jump."""

A separate statement read: ""Nico Gaitan has been sold to Dalian Yifang, from the Chinese Super League."" Atletico have not specified the fees involved but, according to the Spanish press, Carrasco's departure will earn them around 30 million euros ($36.9 million) and Gaitan 18 million euros. Carrasco's former team Monaco are also reportedly set to receive 25 percent of the transfer fee, due to an agreement made when the winger moved in July 2015. He went on to make 124 appearances for Atletico, registering 23 goals and 17 assists. Argentinian winger Gaitan joined from Benfica in 2016 and played 49 times for the club.

Atletico Madrid and French striker Antoine Griezmann were paired with Lokomotiv Moscow, the day after another Spanish-Russian game, between Athletic Bilbao and Spartak Moscow, was marred by violence in which a Spanish policeman died of a heart attack. Bilbao will face 1993 European champions Marseille for the matches on March 8 and 15. Another French side, Lyon, must overcome CSKA Moscow to keep alive their hopes of appearing in the final which will be played at their own stadium on May 16. Lyon were comfortable 4-1 aggregate winners over Villarreal in the round of 32 and former club stalwart Bernard Lacombe welcomed the draw which sees the second leg played in France. ""We qualified well against Villarreal, who are a good club. Obviously it would be fantastic to play in our own stadium (in the final) but there are high-level opponents left in the competition and we have to respect that,"" he told beIN Sports.

215,18/02/2018,22:52,"Real Madrid win eight-goal thriller, Atletico keep up Barca chase",Man of the moment Marco Asensio scored twice and Cristiano Ronaldo was also on target as Real Madrid kept up the feel-good factor with a thrilling 5-3 victory at Real Betis in La Liga on Sunday night.,"Madrid had been 2-1 down at half-time in a fantastic game at the Benito Villamarin, but they came roaring back in the second half with Sergio Ramos, Asensio -- who had scored the opener - Ronaldo and Karim Benzema all finding the net. They survived a late Betis onslaught, and after their 3-1 Champions League last 16, first-leg win against Paris Saint-Germain in midweek, this victory confirms that Zinedine Zidane's side are looking better in La Liga now too. They remain fourth, a huge 17 points behind leaders Barcelona. However, this was their fourth win in five league outings, and they are back to within a point of third-placed Valencia with a game in hand to come at Leganes in midweek. Asensio had come off the bench to set up the two late goals that allowed Real to beat PSG and he was rewarded with a start on Sunday in Seville, while Gareth Bale also came in as the likes of Benzema and Luka Modric dropped to the bench. Asensio duly headed Madrid into an 11th-minute lead after Antonio Adan had saved a Ronaldo shot, but Betis had won when the sides last met at the Santiago Bernabeu and they hit back brilliantly. Loren and Joaquin, the latter from a free-kick, both came close before Aissa Mandi headed in a Joaquin cross to make it 1-1 in the 33rd minute. It was 2-1 shortly after, as visiting defender Nacho could only help a Junior shot into his own net, and the home fans in the crowd of over 53,000 erupted. Real also saw Marcelo limp off in the first half -- a potentially worrying sign ahead of the PSG second leg -- but they recovered superbly after the restart. Ramos, whose Sevilla past always ensures a hot reception from the Betis fans, levelled with a bullet header from a Lucas Vazquez corner. Dani Carvajal then set up Asensio for his second and Real's third as the hour approached, and Ronaldo smashed in their fourth goal in the 65th minute. The Portuguese, supposedly in decline, has now scored 10 times in six games between league and Champions League. Betis may lack the consistency to properly contest a European place, but they do provide entertainment, and Cristian Tello set up fellow substitute Sergio Leon to make it 4-3 late on. Benzema, on from the bench, completed the scoring at the death with a goal that will boost his confidence. Earlier, Kevin Gameiro came off the bench in the second half to score one goal and make another for Diego Costa as second-placed Atletico Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0. It was another clinical performance from Diego Simeone's side, who have now recorded four consecutive league victories, all without conceding a goal. They remain second, seven points behind unbeaten leaders Barcelona, who won 2-0 at Eibar on Saturday ahead of their Champions League trip to Chelsea. ""We are not stopping, we are playing well at the moment, and we are enjoying ourselves,"" said Gameiro when asked about his team's pursuit of Barcelona. Atletico, who have conceded a paltry nine goals in 24 La Liga games this season, will hope to stay within striking distance of Barcelona before going to the Camp Nou in a fortnight. Villarreal are sixth after a 1-1 draw at Espanyol, while Real Sociedad beat Levante 3-0."

They remain second, seven points behind unbeaten league leaders Barcelona, who won 2-0 at Eibar on Saturday ahead of their Champions League last 16, first leg away to Chelsea. Former Chelsea striker Costa returned for Atletico at the Wanda Metropolitano after injury prevented him from taking part in their 4-1 Europa League win over FC Copenhagen in Denmark on Thursday. Atletico created little in the first half to get the crowd of just over 60,000 out of their seats. However, they livened up after the restart, and in particular after Gameiro was sent on for Koke just before the hour mark. It was Atletico's French connection that led to the opening goal midway through the second half, with Antoine Griezmann setting up Gameiro, who took a touch before firing low past Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the far corner for his fifth league goal of the season. Gameiro then turned provider with a fine through ball for Costa, who fired home to secure the points with 10 minutes remaining, the goal his second in La Liga since returning to Spain. ""We are not stopping, we are playing well at the moment, and we are enjoying ourselves,"" said Gameiro when asked about his team's pursuit of Barcelona at the top of the table. Atletico, who have conceded a paltry nine goals in 24 La Liga games this season, will hope to stay within striking distance of Barcelona before going to the Camp Nou in a fortnight. Simeone's side are also nine points clear of third-placed Valencia, who came from behind to win 2-1 at bottom club Malaga on Saturday. Real Madrid, in fourth, are at Betis on Sunday evening. Earlier on Sunday, Real Sociedad beat struggling Levante 3-0 at Anoeta."

They did not say how long he would be absent. Godin was cleaned out by Neto as the two went up for a high ball following an Antoine Griezmann free-kick. He was taken off bleeding heavily after the incident, which happened early in the second half. Angel Correa scored the goal for Atletico, who are second in La Liga, nine points behind leaders Barcelona."

""His hard work and never give up attitude after his injury made him become a player loved by the fans and a respected leader in the dressing room."" Spanish sport daily As reported that Beijing Renhe paid 4.5 million euros ($5.59 million) for 31-year-old Fernandez, who signed for Diego Simeone's side from Celta Vigo for six million euros two years ago. The midfielder has seen his time at Atletico disrupted by injuries, including a cruciate knee ligament tear in September 2016, and he has only made 10 appearances this season. Atletico are currently second in La Liga, and take on FC Copenhagen in the last 32 of the Europa League."
219,28/01/2018,19:08,Vintage Torres downs lowly Las Palmas,Fernando Torres scored a rare la Liga goal on Sunday as Atletico Madrid made light of Diego Costa's absence to consolidate second place with a 3-0 win over lowly Las Palmas.,"Torres finished a lightning 73rd-minute counter-attack with a vintage shot into the roof of the net to double his side's lead and help move them up to 46 points, six ahead of third-place Valencia after their 4-1 home defeat by Real Madrid on Saturday. The win for Atletico means that they have also closed the gap to Barcelona to eight points ahead of the runaway league leaders' home clash later with Alaves, who are hovering one place above the relegation zone. With Costa injured, Atletico took a while to get going and had to wait until the 61st minute to open the scoring, Antoine Griezmann latching on to Juanfran's fine ball down the right flank before dinking neatly over Las Palmas stopper Leandro Chichizola. ""The first half was not very good but the coach gave us a good talking to at half-time, and we responded well,"" said Griezmann, who also hit the post twice and started the move that led to the Torres goal, the 600th scored by Atletico in all competitions during Diego Simeone's seven-year reign as coach. The Frenchman intercepted a loose pass and set Angel Correa free to scamper down the pitch and feed Torres, who shifted the ball onto his right foot and lashed home the goal that sealed the three points. An easy tap-in from Thomas Partey after great work from Yannick Carrasco two minutes from time completed the second-half rout of a desperate Las Palmas, who remain second from bottom and five points from safety. ""In the end, we had lots of opportunities and we scored three goals,"" added Griezmann, whose goal was just his seventh in the league this season but his fourth in league and cup since the turn of the year. ""I feel good, I've started the year well and I hope to continue the goals and assists. ""We still have two competitions to play for this season (La Liga and the Europa League) and we will give everything in them both. Let's see how far we are able to go."" Sevilla were denied the chance to close within three points of Real Madrid and the Champions league places after Angel Rodriguez scored a controversial equaliser deep in stoppage time to snatch a 1-1 draw for Getafe at the Roman Sanchez Pizjaun stadium. Luis Muriel had slid in a 72nd-minute for hosts but with seconds to spare Juan Cala challenged Sevilla keeper Sergio Rico for a hopeful high ball, and with the Sevilla fans and players clamouring for a free-kick, Angel lashed home the leveller and celebrated under a hail of whistles and boos."

Sarabia's strike put Vincenzo Montella's Sevilla 3-1 up in the second leg and 5-2 on aggregate, setting up a semi-final clash with Leganes."
221,24/01/2018,19:12,Spanish prosecutor wants Atletico's Hernandez jailed,"Atletico Madrid defender Lucas Hernandez could face a one-year prison sentence for failing to comply with an order to keep away from his girlfriend, the Madrid public prosecutor's office said on Wednesday.","Early last year, the Frenchman was convicted for his part in a lovers' brawl and ordered to stay at least 500 metres away from his girlfriend for six months. According to papers seen by AFP, the prosecutor said that the 21-year-old player had breached those conditions and recommended a jail sentence. In February 2017, Hernandez and his girlfriend were sentenced to 31 days of community service and six months apart for ""domestic violence"" after a brawl in which they exchanged blows. In June, the couple were arrested together at Madrid airport returning from a holiday. Hernandez spent a few hours in prison but his companion was not arrested because her court order had not been formally served. In Spain, if the accused has no criminal record, sentences of less than two years are usually suspended. Lucas Hernandez is the son of a former professional player, Jean-Francois Hernandez, and the older brother of Theo, who is at Real Madrid. Lucas was born in Marseille but came through the Atletico youth system and has played 20 times for the club this season"

And Escudero's lightning contribution all but sealed Atletico's fate. Antoine Griezmann levelled on the night with a sublime lob in the 13th minute, but the second half was only minutes old when Ever Banega scored from the penalty spot to put Sevilla back in charge. Pablo Sarabia bagged Sevilla's third in the 79th minute with a frustrated Atletico coach Diego Simeone sent to the stands at the end of the tie. ""This knock-out is my responsibility. Now we have to improve because there are still four months of competition,"" said Simeone. On Wednesday Real Madrid, leading 1-0 after the first leg, host Leganes with Alaves facing Levantes, while on Thursday Barcelona complete the quarter-finals against Espanyol."
223,20/01/2018,19:39,Barcelona deny reports of Griezmann agreement,"Barcelona have ""strongly"" denied claims made by Spanish daily Sport on Saturday that they have reached an agreement to sign Antoine Griezmann from Atletico Madrid at the end of the season.","""The Atletico Madrid forward has agreed to join Barcelona and will be under (coach) Ernesto Valverde's orders next season,"" Sport said, adding that Griezmann's current buy-out clause of 200 million euros ($240 million) drops by half on July 1. However, Barcelona later took the unusual step of releasing a statement to deny the reports from the Catalan newspaper. ""FC Barcelona strongly denies the information that has appeared over the course of the last few hours in different media regarding Atletico Madrid player, Antoine Griezmann, and an alleged deal with our club,"" said the statement on the Catalan club's website. Such a reaction can be explained by the fact that Atletico have complained to FIFA about ""repeated contacts"" between Barca and the France striker. ""FC Barcelona expresses its objections in the face of these events and reiterates its full respect for the institution of Atletico Madrid,"" added the statement. Barcelona have been scrambling to add high-quality players to their squad since Paris Saint-Germain lured Brazilian star Neymar to France in a world-record signing last August. Philippe Coutinho joined from Liverpool this month in a 180 million-euro ($220 million) deal. Not wanting to add fuel to the fire, Valverde played down the transfer talk at his press conference ahead of Sunday's trip to Betis in La Liga. ""Griezmann is a great player who plays for another club whom we respect,"" he said. ""When the transfer window is open, we are in a world where there is speculation on a daily basis and we have to live with that. ""But if you're asking me if Griezmann is a good player, well obviously he is a good player. But I repeat what I always say: I prefer to talk about my own players."" Sport says it believes Griezmann's transfer will take place after the World Cup in Russia, where he will have a key role for France, who are among the favourites. Another Catalan daily, Mundo Deportivo, reported in December that the player's family had lunch with the Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu to smooth the way for the transfer. Brazilian born Spain striker Diego Costa joined Atletico from Chelsea in September, and has proved to be the club's top performer since his debut two weeks ago. Barcelona, whose stars Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Andres Iniesta are all in their thirties, signed Ousmane Dembele from Borussia Dortmund for 105 million euros last summer, but the 20-year-old French rising star's campaign has been marred by injury."

The Catalan daily also points out that while Griezmann currently has a buyout clause of 200 million euros ($240 million), that figure drops by half on July 1.

The attack happened on Wednesday evening close to Atletico's Wanda Metropolitano stadium, shortly before the team's 2-1 defeat to Sevilla in the Copa del Rey. The two men seem to have become involved in a dispute in a bar not far from the ground in the east of the capital. The victim was admitted to hospital in a serious condition after being stabbed three times. Aged 22, he suffered injuries to his back, his shoulder and his thigh. He has undergone surgery and his life is not in danger. Police did not name the suspect but Spanish media reports said the man had previously been implicated in the death of a Real Sociedad fan before a game against Atletico in 1998. That case was later dropped due to a lack of evidence."
226,09/01/2018,21:30,Atletico breeze into Copa del Rey quarters,Atletico Madrid booked their place in the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey on Tuesday after seeing off third-tier Lleida 3-0 in the second leg of their last 16 clash and cruising to a 7-0 aggregate win.,"Playing in front of a sparsely populated Wanda Metropolitano, it took dominant Atletico until the 57th minute to extend their four-goal first leg lead, Yannick Carrasco meeting Diego Costa's cutback and slotting home the opener. Kevin Gameiro tapped in the second 17 minutes later after a neat burst into the box from Angel Correa, and Vitolo made it three nine minutes from the end, racing through and crashing home his first Atletico goal. Valencia host Las Palmas at the Mestalla later with their tie level at 1-1."
227,05/01/2018,02:03,Costa's sizzling return reignites Atletico,"Diego Costa's return to Atletico Madrid began in typically explosive fashion on Wednesday night, and his second spell in La Liga has raised hopes that his new team might challenge runaway leaders Barcelona.","Costa swept home his first Atletico goal since leaving the club for Chelsea in 2014 just five minutes into his first appearance since May, scoring Atletico's third in a 4-0 hammering of third-tier Lleida Esportiu in the Copa Del Rey and showing the goalscoring prowess that Diego Simeone's side have lacked all season. Costa came on as a 64th minute sub on Wednesday and almost immediately put his foot where it hurts to score, beating Lleida centre-back Marc Trilles to Juanfran's drilled cross and having his shin stamped on by the defending in the process. ""He'd put his foot into the blades of a fan,"" said teammate Vitolo. Costa showed the other, darker side to his game soon after deciding that the knock to the shin was nothing serious, charging back onto the pitch and getting embroiled in a row with Jorge Felix for which he was lucky not to be booked. ""In a way he never left, despite having a very good spell at Chelsea,"" said goalkeeper Miguel Anguel Moya, who stood in for Jan Oblak at Lleida. Atletico, who host Getafe on Saturday, are second in La Liga having lost only once all season but are nine points behind Ernesto Valverde's team, on 36 points after drawing six of their 17 league fixtures, more than any team in the top half of the table. They remain as dogged and as hard to beat as ever -- just eight goals conceded and one defeat in 17 league games is a testament to that -- but they have scored only 25. That's 20 fewer than Barca and a paltry total compared to third-placed Valencia, who have rattled in 36 and are two points behind Atletico. Their top scorer is Antoine Griezmann, who has improved after a slow start to the season and scored the fourth with a deflected free-kick on Wednesday but has only scored five times in the league. Sunday's match is just the sort of match Atletico have faltered at throughout this season. As well as the six league draws against the middling likes of Girona and Leganes, four in the Champions League -- including two with Azerbaijani minnows Qarabag -- cost them qualification from a group many expected them to comfortably get through ahead of eventual group winners Roma. Their first league defeat of the season came at Espanyol before the Christmas break, a 1-0 loss that came thanks to shot shy striker Sergio Garcia's first goal of the season two minutes before the end and highlighted the how blunt Atletico can look going forward against weak opposition. Atletico haven't won La Liga since Costa left for London, where he won two Premier League titles in three years straight after rifling the Madrid club to their tenth league championship with 27 goals. Real Madrid are way back in fourth, five behind Atletico as they prepare to travel to Celta Vigo, who have held Barca to two recent draws -- 2-2 at the Camp Nou in the league last month and 1-1 in the cup on Thursday."
228,04/01/2018,16:44,Football: Atletico Madrid loan Vietto to Valencia,Valencia on Thursday announced the loan signing of Argentine forward Luciano Vietto from their La Liga rivals Atletico Madrid.,"Valencia confirmed that Vietto, 24, would join on a deal until the end of the season with an option to make the move permanent then. Vietto, who failed to score in 10 games this season for Atletico, had found himself relegated down the pecking order there after Diego Costa's return to the club from Chelsea. He played under Valencia coach Marcelino at Villarreal in 2014-15 before moving to the capital on a deal until 2021. Valencia are currently third in La Liga, two points behind second-placed Atletico and 11 adrift of leaders Barcelona."
229,31/12/2017,16:00,"Atletico Madrid finally unveil Diego Costa, Vitolo",Atletico Madrid unveiled new signings Diego Costa and Vitolo on Sunday as the Spanish club's transfer ban finally comes to an end.,"Atletico had been unable to register new signings in last summer's transfer window after being handed a ban by FIFA for irregularities in relation to the transfers of minors. But they had already agreed deals to bring Spain striker Costa back to the club from Chelsea and sign winger Vitolo from Sevilla. Both will be able to make their debuts with the winter window opening on Monday. ""I know there is a lot of competition, that they have a lot of goals in them,"" said Costa, 29, of the prospect of competing with the likes of Antoine Griezmann and Fernando Torres for a starting berth in Diego Simeone's side. It was in September that Atletico announced the signing of Costa, with Spanish media saying they had agreed to pay Chelsea around 60 million euros ($71.3 million) to bring back a player who starred for them when they won La Liga and reached the Champions League final in 2013/14. Costa, who has signed a deal through to 2021, scored 20 goals for Chelsea as they won last season's Premier League title but fell out with Antonio Conte, his manager in west London. Atletico also agreed in the summer to pay the 37.5 million-euro buyout clause to sign Vitolo from Sevilla. He has spent the first half of this season on loan at Las Palmas although he has recently been sidelined with a thigh injury. ""The injury is behind me. I have spent the last month working with the physios. It's forgotten about now,"" said the 28-year-old Spain winger. Atletico, who moved into a new 68,000-seat stadium, the Wanda Metropolitano, at the start of this season, failed to make it out of the Champions League group stage. However, Simeone's side are the nearest challengers to leaders Barcelona in La Liga, sitting nine points behind in second place with more than half the season still remaining. They face lower-league Lleida in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday before returning to league action at home to Getafe at the weekend."
230,23/12/2017,12:33,Espanyol inflict Atletico's first league defeat,Atletico Madrid failed to put pressure on La Liga leaders Barcelona ahead of Saturday's El Clasico at Real Madrid as they slumped to a first La Liga defeat of the season 1-0 at Espanyol.,"Sergio Garcia struck the only goal two minutes from time when he swept Esteban Granero's cross past a helpless Jan Oblak to hand Espanyol a much-needed win to ease their relegation fears. Atletico remain six points adrift of Barca, but could end the year nine points back if the Catalans move a huge step towards the title with victory away to Real on Saturday. Diego Simeone's men will be able to call on Diego Costa when they return to action in January and the need for the Brazilian-born Spanish international striker's aggression and firepower was in evidence during an insipid 90 minutes from the visitors. Leo Baptistao should have handed Espanyol an early lead when his attempted chip floated wide with just Oblak to beat. At the other end, Antoine Griezmann thought he had won a penalty when he was upended by Pau Lopez. However, the referee's original decision to award the spot-kick was overruled by the linesman's offside flag. Diego Godin had a goal rightly ruled out for the visitors after the break for a clear push on an Espanyol defender. Substitute Kevin Gameiro had Atletico's best chance 13 minutes from time, but fired straight at Pau Lopez with Saul Niguez begging for a cross to apply a simple finish. And Atletico were for once punished for a rare slip in concentration at the back when former Real Madrid midfielder Granero's pinpoint cross was converted by Garcia for his first La Liga goal since returning to the Catalans from Qatari side Al-Rayyan. Defeat also ended an unbeaten run on the road of over a year for Atletico as Espanyol jumped up to 14th, five points above the drop zone."
231,22/12/2017,02:20,Barca tempted by Griezmann as transfer window set to open,Barcelona are making moves to bring Atletico Madrid star Antoine Griezmann to the Catalan capital while Manchester City are eyeing Alexis Sanchez as clubs around Europe prepare for the January transfer window.,"The winter window opens at one minute past midnight on January 1, but Barca are looking for a belated Christmas present in the France international. Both players will likely move in the summer but deals could be struck in January, with Sanchez holding out for a reported £400,000-per-week ($535,000) deal from the runaway Premier League leaders when his contract runs out at the end of the season. Mundo Deportivo claimed Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu has had dinner with Griezmann's parents and sister, who manages the player's affairs, and the club are looking to tie him down to a deal that would see him move in the summer. Not even Atletico's complaint to FIFA about Barca's public pursual of their star is likely to stop the move from happening, with Barca director Guillermo Amor as good as admitting the meeting took place. In August, Griezmann's former agent Eric Ohalts revealed that the France forward would have moved to Manchester United in the summer had FIFA not upheld a transfer ban that stopped the Madrid club from buying any reinforcements, and now Barca are ready to swoop. Barca still have full coffers after receiving 222 million euros ($263 million) from the world record-busting sale of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain and Griezmann's 100 million euros buyout clause means the club only need to agree personal terms, avoiding the problems they encountered when they failed to sign Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool in August. Barcelona are however still keeping tabs on Coutinho and could make a lower bid than the 100 million euros they were prepared to pay in the summer. After the Neymar signing, Paris Saint-Germain have got to sell players to comply with Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. Inter Milan are among those looking at PSG midfielder Javier Pastore, who admitted last month he was ""disappointed"" at his lack of first-team action. PSG coach Unai Emery admitted that Brazilian midfielder Lucas Moura and French international striker Hatem Ben Arfa are interested in leaving in January, but said nothing about Pastore and Angel Di Maria, who has expressed his annoyance at being forced out of the first team by new arrivals Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. Liverpool and Arsenal are keen on PSG's Julian Draxler, but the German international has revealed that he has no plans to leave Paris after finding a new role in Emery's team. The Qatari-backed Parisians were rumoured to be interested in AC Milan's rising star goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, but after reports of the stopper complaining about being coerced into signing his summer six million-euro contract extension, the club and player -- and crucially his powerful agent Mino Raiola -- have made moves towards a reconciliation. PSG have given themselves an FFP boost after agreeing the 35-million-euro sale of 21-year-old talent Gonzalo Guedes with Valencia, where the Portugal international is currently on loan from the Ligue 1 leaders. The sharks are circling Arsenal, as not just Sanchez but other attacking stars Mesut Ozil and Olivier Giroud head towards potential Gunners exits. City were denied Sanchez on the summer's deadline day, but City boss Pep Guardiola has indicated he may now wait until the summer before making his move. Sanchez is reportedly unhappy at Arsenal, and the London club are prepared to open negotiations with City -- knowing that Chelsea and Real Madrid are also both interested -- to avoid seeing the Chilean star leave on a free transfer in the close season. City's local rivals Manchester United are looking at the Gunners' other attacking star Ozil, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan the likely player to make way for the Germany international. United boss Jose Mourinho is a long-time admirer of his former Real Madrid charge but the Reds could wait until his contract expires at the end of the season if no-one else makes a winter move. Giroud could leave as Borussia Dortmund look for a partner for star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Chelsea's attacking dynamo Eden Hazard is a top target for Real Madrid, and should the Belgian make a post-World Cup move to Spain, Real's Marco Asensio is keen on joining Guardiola at City. Real are not normally a club that does business in the winter window. Chelsea are pondering an £80 million bid for Monaco star Thomas Lemar, with Blues striker Michy Batshuayi a potential makeweight as he seeks first-team football to boost his chances of making the Belgian World Cup squad. Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha is also a target for Antonio Conte's side, as is Southampton defender Virgil van Dijk, who was denied a summer move to Liverpool, while out-of-favour Blues centre-back David Luiz has Juventus and Real Madrid keen on his signature."
232,19/12/2017,16:22,Atletico report Barca for illegal Griezmann approach,"Atletico Madrid reported Barcelona to football's governing body FIFA over illegal contact made to star forward Antoine Griezmann, Atletico club sources confirmed on Tuesday.","""The complaint has been presented for repeated contact between Barcelona, the player and his team,"" an Atletico source told AFP. Griezmann renewed his contract until 2022 in June and Atletico consider contact made by Barcelona not only breaks FIFA's rules, but could also affect the integrity of La Liga. Barcelona lead the league with Atletico their closest challengers six points behind in second. ""He is a player under a long contract and this can't happen. Moreover, the club considers that it could affect the competition where Barca are currently top and Atletico second,"" added the Atletico source. Barca were slapped with a one-year transfer ban for the illegal recruitment of foreign minors by FIFA that was served in 2015. Should the Catalan giants be found guilty, they could be handed another ban on registering new players. Barcelona-based sports daily Mundo Deportivo reported on Sunday that Barca's president Josep Maria Bartomeu had recently met with Griezmann's family. The Catalan giants are expected to be willing to pay the French international's 100 million euro ($117.8 million) buyout clause at the end of the season to avoid negotiating with Atletico. Barca's director of institutional relations Guillermo Amor turned down the opportunity to deny a meeting had taken place later on Sunday after Barca's 4-0 thrashing of Deportivo la Coruna. ""If the paper says it then it is possible it is like that,"" Amor told Movistar TV. ""There could have been a coming together."" Griezmann, 26, agreed to sign a new contract with Atletico in June after the club had an appeal against a transfer ban rejected. Top scorer at Euro 2016, Griezmann said it would have been ""dirty"" to walk out on the club when they couldn't replace him until January. However, Atletico coach Diego Simeone accepted last week that Griezmann's departure at some point in the future is inevitable. ""Of course Griezmann will be able to leave at some point, as Diego Costa, Diego Ribas and Arda Turan have gone,"" Simeone told French sports daily L'Equipe. ""If a player comes to me and says, 'coach, I have a chance of a lifetime and want to leave', and if he's left everything on the pitch for me like Griezmann, I'll say, 'no problem'."" Griezmann has scored 90 goals in 179 games for Atletico since joining from Real Sociedad in 2014 and led Los Rojiblancos to the 2016 Champions League final, scoring twice to eliminated Barca in the quarter-finals. However, he was also caught up in a Twitter storm on Sunday after posting a picture of himself blacked up and mimicking a Harlem Globetrotter basketball player from the 1980s. ""I recognise that it was clumsy of me. If I have offended people, I apologise,"" he wrote shortly after and deleted the photo after receiving a wave of criticism."

However, Barca appear willing to meet his 100 million euro ($118 million) buyout clause as they seek to again unite Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez with a prolific attacker following the departure of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain in August for a world record 222 million euros. ""Barca settled on Griezmann as an objective for 2018 and they spoke with his entourage to see if he was willing to wear the blue and red shirt,"" reported Barcelona-based Mundo Deportivo.

Griezmann, 26, agreed to sign a new contract with Atletico in June after the club had an appeal against a transfer ban rejected. The top scorer at Euro 2016, Griezmann said it would have been ""dirty"" to walk out on the club when they couldn't replace him until January. However, Atletico coach Diego Simeone accepted this week that Griezmann's departure is inevitable. Many of Atletico's other outstanding players, including strikers Fernando Torres, Sergio Aguero, Radamel Falcao and Diego Costa, have also left in recent years for pastures new. ""Of course Griezmann will be able to leave at some point, as Diego Costa, Diego Ribas and Arda Turan have gone,"" Simeone told French sports daily L'Equipe. ""If a player comes to me and says, 'coach, I have a chance of a lifetime and want to leave', and if he's left everything on the pitch for me like Griezmann, I'll say, 'no problem'."" Atletico are also likely to come under financial pressure to sell after moving into a new 310-million euro stadium in September and falling to make it into the last 16 of the Champions League for the first time in five years. The club have also already committed to nearly 100 million euros in transfers for January with Costa returning from Chelsea and Spanish international Vitolo joining from Sevilla."

""Of course Griezmann will be able to leave at some point, as Diego Costa, Diego Ribas and Arda Turan have gone,"" Simeone told French sports daily L'Equipe. ""If one day Griezmann leaves Atletico and goes to a more offensive team, he'll be much better."" Griezmann has struggled to find his best form for Atletico this season -- at one stage going eight games without a goal -- but has scored four times in his last five matches.

235,15/12/2017,16:35,Griezmann will leave Atletico - Simeone,Atletico Madrid head coach Diego Simeone admitted on Friday that French forward Antoine Griezmann would likely leave the club in the near future.,"The 26-year-old was heavily linked with a move in the close season, but with Atletico under a transfer ban, signed a new contract to stay until 2022. ""Of course Griezmann will be able to leave at some point, as Diego Costa, Diego Ribas and Arda Turan have gone,"" Simeone told French sports daily L'Equipe. ""If one day Griezmann leaves Atletico and goes to a more offensive team, he'll be much better."" Griezmann has struggled to find his best form for Atletico this season -- at one stage going eight games without a goal -- but has scored four times in his last five matches. ""My players, I love them a lot. I love them growing up, I'm not ungrateful,"" Argentinian Simeone said. ""If a player comes to me and says, 'coach, I have a chance of a lifetime and want to leave', and if he's left everything on the pitch for me like Griezmann, I'll say, 'no problem'."" Spanish international Costa has since returned to Atletico from Chelsea and will be available to play when their transfer embargo is lifted in January, which could help fill the hole up front should Griezmann leave."
236,10/12/2017,18:18,Saul strike keeps Atletico on Barca's tails,Atletico Madrid bounced back from the disappointment of being dumped out of the Champions League in midweek to keep their La Liga title challenge afloat by grinding out a 1-0 win at Real Betis on Sunday.,"In the absence of top scorer Antoine Griezmann through injury, Saul Niguez once again provided a big goal for Atletico that takes Diego Simeone's men to within three points of league leaders Barcelona. The Catalans can though re-establish a six-point gap over Atletico in third with victory at Villarreal later on Sunday. Betis have now won just once in the league since September as their slide continues, putting coach Quique Setien under serious pressure. However, the hosts dominated possession throughout and were made to pay for their lack of cutting edge, as well as some fine goalkeeping by Jan Oblak. Atletico went in front with their first serious attack on the half-hour mark as Saul slid in to meet Sime Vrsaljko's cross. Of the midfielder's last 18 goals, 15 have now broken the deadlock, but unlike at Chelsea in midweek, Saul's effort proved to be the only goal. Indeed, the visitors should have had a second moments after going ahead when Angel Correa fired straight at Antonio Adan with Kevin Gameiro better placed. Betis posed more of a goal threat after the break as Sergio Leon drilled a dangerous ball across the face of the goal with no takers. Oblak then produced a wonder save to turn Cristian Tello's sweetly struck half-volley behind for a corner. Atletico substitute Fernando Torres should have sealed all three points when he somehow fired over from point-blank range with just Adan to beat eight minutes from time. However, the visitors showed why they have now gone a year without defeat away in La Liga as Atletico stood strong when faced with a barrage of Betis crosses into their box in stoppage time to record a ninth clean sheet in 15 La Liga games."
237,05/12/2017,23:38,"Atletico crash out, Chelsea sink to second place",Atletico Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League after a 1-1 draw at Chelsea that denied the English side top spot in Group C.,"It was a depressing evening for both clubs at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday as neither got what they wanted from their final group fixture. Atletico had to win to have a chance of advancing, but although Saul Niguez's second-half header put the visitors ahead, Chelsea drew level through a Stefan Savic own goal. In the end, Roma's win against Qarabag in the other group match made the result irrelevant for Diego Simeone's team, who failed to qualify for the last 16 for only the second time and the first since the 2009-10 season. It was a painful moment for Atletico and, after finishing as Champions League runners-up in 2014 and 2016, they are now consigned to the Europa League. ""It's part of football. It hurts but there are no excuses. The responsibility is ours,"" Simeone said. ""This can be a new challenge. Everything bad we can make into a positive."" Chelsea were already through to the knockout stages, but blew their chance to finish in first place and in theory earn an easier draw. Having lost and drawn against Roma, Chelsea finished second behind the Italians due to their inferior head-to-head record. That is bad news for Antonio Conte's side, who could be pitted against Champions League heavyweights including Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain in next week's last 16 draw. ""We tried to play our game. We created many chances to score. When you play this way and create so much you must be satisfied,"" Conte said. ""Our opponent (in the next round) won't be happy to play against us."" Atletico striker Fernando Torres endured a difficult three-and-a-half years with Chelsea, but he came close to giving his side an early lead on his return to west London when his shot deflected onto the roof of Thibaut Courtois' net. Unlike Torres, his compatriot Alvaro Morata has had no problems adapting to life at Chelsea and he showcased his deft touch to make space for a curling shot that flashed just wide. With Roma always expected to beat Qarabag, Chelsea knew only a win would be enough to guarantee top spot. Again Morata went close to the opener when he stretched to meet Victor Moses' cross, but Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak spread himself to block the Spaniard's close-range effort. Causing Atletico all manner of problems, Morata almost caught out Oblak with a dipping strike from wide on the left that had the keeper scrambling to save. Davide Zappacosta was next to test Oblak when the Chelsea wing-back unleashed a fierce shot that was pushed around the post. Conte's men kept pushing after the interval and Andreas Christensen's header was saved by Oblak before Eden Hazard's deflected shot looped narrowly wide. Despite that barrage, Filipe Luis, another Chelsea old boy in the Atletico side, almost put the Spaniards ahead against the run of play when his long-range shot cannoned back off a post to Koke, who should have done better than head straight at Courtois. Sparked by that near-miss, Atletico snatched the lead in the 56th minute. When Torres flicked on a corner, Niguez easily escaped Tiemoue Bakayoko's slack marking and had the simple task of heading home from close range. Christensen should have equalised from a Cesc Fabregas cross 10 minutes later, but the Chelsea defender somehow headed wide of the open goal. Pedro fared no better when his back-heeled flick was saved on the line by Oblak. Chelsea's pressure finally brought an equaliser in the 75th minute as Hazard's shot was deflected into his own net by Savic. Morata should have put Chelsea ahead moments later, but he shot too close to Oblak. There was more angst to come for Chelsea in the closing minutes when Willian missed a sitter before Michy Batshuayi's stinging strike whistled wide."
238,04/12/2017,14:24,English eyes on Griezmann for crunch Chelsea clash,"As a red-hot Antoine Griezmann hopes to keep Atletico Madrid's faint Champions League hopes alive at Stamford Bridge, the stage is also set for the Frenchman to showcase his talents to a host of Premier League suitors.","Atletico need to beat Chelsea in London on Tuesday and hope Roma don't beat Champions League debutants Qarabag in the Italian capital if they are to make the last 16 for a fifth consecutive season. The financial blow an early exit would bring to Atletico, who moved into the new 310 million euro ($369 million) Wanda Metropolitano stadium earlier this season, could precipitate Griezmann's departure from the Spanish capital. But for his loyalty to Atletico and in particular coach Diego Simeone, Griezmann could have already been out the door last summer. A number of sides, led by Manchester United, seemed willing to meet his 100 million euro buyout clause, but when Atletico's appeal against a transfer ban was rejected in June Griezmann agreed to stay on. Griezmann admitted at the time it would have been ""dirty"" to walk out on Atletico when they couldn't replace him since it is they who propelled him into the European football elite after signing him from Real Sociedad in 2014. That loyalty hasn't been wholly rewarded however, with many Atletico fans unhappy at Griezmann's frequent flirting with other sides, including La Liga rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona, often via the French press. ""For months now my name has come out linked with Manchester United,"" Griezmann wrote in his newly-released autobiography 'Behind the Smile'. ""The English press said they were willing to pay EUR100 million, which is my release clause. ""I was not going to waste time denying it. No matter how much I repeat that I am delighted at Atletico, that I have a great coach and great teammates, they ask me regularly about my future. ""At Real Sociedad I realised I had reached a moment where I had to move to keep progressing, that has not happened at Atletico Madrid. Although, again, I rule nothing out."" The backlash to Griezmann's public comments peaked when he was jeered off as he was substituted during a goalless Madrid derby two weeks ago. At the time Griezmann was on a barren run of eight games without a goal and, with no one else offering reliable back-up, Atletico's Champions League campaign stalled with defeat to Chelsea and back-to-back draws with Azerbaijanis Qarabag. ""I am with him to the death,"" insisted Simeone back then before adding ""as long as he is in my family"". All has been forgiven, if not forgotten, in the past 10 days as a stunning acrobatic opener in a 2-0 win over Roma got Griezmann back among the goals and Atletico winning again. Having won just two and scored seven goals in their previous 10 matches, Atletico have won four in a row, netting an average of three goals a game. After Griezmann's fourth in three games with a late winner against his former side Sociedad on Saturday, he was grappled in a bear hug by Simeone that showed his was fully back in the fold. One of the best nights in Simeone's glorious six years at the helm in Madrid came at Stamford Bridge in 2014, when he outwitted Jose Mourinho in a 3-1 win that took his side to the first of their two recent Champions League finals. Should they fail to replicate that performance against Conte's men on Tuesday and not get a helping hand from Qarabag it could be the beginning of a long goodbye for star man Griezmann."
239,01/12/2017,14:18,Injury ends Atletico-bound Vitolo's stay at Las Palmas,Spanish international Vitolo has travelled to Madrid to begin his recuperation from a hamstring injury before officially joining Atletico Madrid in January.,"The winger was loaned to Las Palmas for the first half of the season after Atletico paid his 37.5 million euro ($44.5 million) buyout clause from Sevilla in July. Atletico were banned from registering new players during the summer window as a punishment for breaking FIFA's rules regarding the signing of foreign players under the age of 16. ""I have come here to recuperate with the Atletico medical team. It is an agreement between the clubs,"" Vitolo said as he arrived in the Spanish capital on Friday. Vitolo's temporary move to his home town club hasn't been a successful one as Las Palmas are mired in the relegation zone and already looking for their third coach of the season following Pako Ayestaran's sacking on Thursday. A series of injuries have also meant the 28-year-old has missed out on Julen Lopetegui's recent Spain squads despite being a key player early on in Spain's World Cup qualifying campaign. Vitolo left the field in tears after his latest setback as Las Palmas reached the last 16 of the Copa del Rey against Deportivo la Coruna on Wednesday with a hamstring injury that is expected to keep him sidelined for the rest of the year. ""I have had three injuries in the short time since I arrived at Las Palmas. When I arrived I thought it would be different,"" added Vitolo. ""In the end there have been bad times, above all because of the injuries that haven't allowed me to be comfortable."""
240,20/11/2017,01:30,"Real, Barca eye progress as Atletico fear exit","Holders Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United headline a selection of teams who can secure a place in the last 16 of the Champions League this week.","Liverpool, Chelsea and Juventus are also within reach of a spot in the knockout phase, but Atletico Madrid appear destined for an early exit, with Serie A high-flyers Napoli also in deep trouble. Playing Tuesday (all times 1945 GMT unless stated) Spartak Moscow v Maribor (1700 GMT) Sevilla v Liverpool The winner of Liverpool's match at Sevilla will qualify. The two sides played out an entertaining 2-2 draw at Anfield on the opening matchday, and another point for five-time European champions Liverpool would still see them book a last-16 spot for the first time since 2008/09 if Spartak lose at home to Maribor. Russian champions Spartak cannot be eliminated on Tuesday and would secure at least third place with a draw. Slovenian outfit Maribor have to win and hope Sevilla lose to Liverpool to stay in knockout round contention. Manchester City v Feyenoord Napoli v Shakhtar Donetsk Serie A leaders Napoli host Shakhtar needing to win and score at least two goals to keep their hopes alive. The Italian side lost 2-1 in Ukraine in the reverse fixture, so need to level their head-to-head record with Shakhtar to take the group to a final matchday. Pep Guardiola's Manchester City will wrap up top spot in the group with a home win over pointless Feyenoord, or with a draw if Shakhtar lose in Naples. Besiktas v Porto (1700 GMT) Monaco v RB Leipzig Turkish champions Besiktas are on the cusp of the last 16 and will secure top spot with a draw. If Leipzig fail to beat Monaco, then they will finish in the top two regardless. Two-time champions Porto will book their ticket to the knockout stage with a victory in Istanbul if Leipzig do not win in the principality. Last season's semi-finalists Monaco have to win and hope Porto do not to have any chance of replicating their feats from last term. Borussia Dortmund v Tottenham APOEL v Real Madrid After their famous 3-1 win over the holders at Wembley last time out, Spurs just have to match Real's result on Tuesday to secure first place. Zinedine Zidane's Spanish champions will qualify with a win over Cypriots APOEL, and with a point if struggling Dortmund fail to see off Tottenham. A pair of draws against the Germans have kept APOEL's slim chances alive, but they will be out if they do not pull off a shock win over Real. Playing Wednesday CSKA Moscow v Benfica (1700 GMT) Basel v Manchester United Manchester United require just a point away to Basel to qualify and secure top spot as Jose Mourinho's team close in on a first appearance in the knockout phase since 2013-14. Paul Pogba's return from injury at the weekend inspired United to a 4-1 rout of Newcastle, just their second win in five league outings, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic also made his comeback following a serious knee injury. Basel could also qualify with victory over United if CSKA Moscow lose at home to Benfica, who must win to retain any outside chance of advancing. Paris Saint-Germain v Celtic Anderlecht v Bayern Munich Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich are already guaranteed of their spots in the last 16, with Celtic and Anderlecht scrapping to continue their continental adventure in the Europa League. Unai Emery's PSG have scored 17 goals without conceding to record four straight group-stage wins, while Edinson Cavani scored twice more as they pulled six points clear in France following a 4-1 defeat of Nantes. Bayern have been rejuventated by the appointment of 72-year-old Jupp Heynckes, winning all eight matches since he replaced Carlo Ancelotti. Qarabag v Chelsea (1700 GMT) Atletico Madrid v Roma Roma can seal their place in the next round with a point at Atletico Madrid, while Chelsea will progress with victory over Qarabag -- or if Atletico fail to win in Spain. Diego Simeone's side -- finalists twice in the past four seasons -- have drawn four of their matches so far and appear heading to a premature exit. Buoyed by their 2-1 derby win over local rivals Lazio, Roma can wrap up first place with victory if Chelsea are denied all three points in Azerbaijan. Juventus v Barcelona Sporting Lisbon v Olympiakos Lionel Messi and Barcelona will qualify and clinch top spot with a draw against last year's finalists Juventus. Massimiliano Allegri's Juve slumped to a rare defeat on Sunday, as Gianluigi Buffon and Andrea Barzagli were rested for a 3-2 loss at Sampdoria. But the six-time reigning Italian champions can move through to the knockout round if they avoid defeat and Olympiakos get a result at Sporting. Both sides in Lisbon realistically must win to harbour any hope of staying in contention."
241,19/11/2017,15:45,Real Madrid confirm Ramos nose break,"Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos had his nose broken in a bad-tempered Madrid derby at Atletico Madrid, tests confirmed on Sunday.","Ramos had to be replaced at half-time of Saturday's 0-0 draw at Atletico's Wanda Metropolitano which left both sides 10 points behind runaway La Liga leaders Barcelona. ""After tests carried out on Sergio Ramos by the Real Madrid Sanitas medical team, he has been diagnosed with a fractured nose,"" Madrid said in a statement. Real were furious referee David Fernandez Borbalan didn't award a penalty when Lucas Hernandez's boot caught Ramos flush in the face. The club didn't state how long Ramos will be sidelined, but Madrid-based sports daily Marca reported he could return as early as next weekend for Malaga's trip to the Santiago Bernabeu, with the aid of a protective mask. ""I would bleed a thousand times for this badge and this shirt,"" Ramos posted on Twitter alongside pictures of his bloodied face. ""Thanks for your support. I'll be back in no time."" Ramos is expected to miss Real's Champions League trip to APOEL Nicosia on Tuesday where a win will secure the European champions' place in the last 16."
242,19/11/2017,02:15,"Simeone defends off-form Griezmann ""to the death""","Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone insisted he will defend off-colour star forward Antoine Griezmann ""to the death"", as long as he remains an Atletico player, after Saturday's 0-0 draw against local rivals Real Madrid.","Griezmann turned his back on interest from Manchester United to sign a new contract after Atletico lost an appeal against a transfer ban in June. However, the French international, who has been Atletico's top scorer for the past three seasons, has netted just three times so far this campaign and not at all in his last eight games at club level. Despite his poor form, Griezmann has continued to be linked to other clubs, including Barcelona, and he was jeered off by large sections of the Atletico fanbase when he was substituted by Simeone 15 minutes from time. ""As long as someone is in my family, I am with them to the death. I have always been that way and I'm not going to change at nearly 50,"" said Simeone. ""All the players have to show up and not just Griezmann."" Atletico were again left to rue their lack of ruthlessness in front of goal as Angel Correa and Griezmann's replacement Kevin Gameiro passed up the best chances of a tightly-contested derby. ""I am never going to speak badly of a teammate and even less of Griezmann,"" added Atletico right-back Juanfran. ""The issue is he has set the bar so high over the past two years. ""If Correa's or Gameiro's chance goes in we are talking about how well the team played and not Antoine."" However, a stalemate left Barcelona the big winners of the day as the La Liga leaders moved 10 points clear of both Real and Atletico with a 3-0 victory earlier on Saturday over Leganes. ""Ten points is a lot but that will change for sure because Barca will not always win and we will be in the running,"" insisted Real boss Zinedine Zidane. ""The only thing we lacked was a goal. I can't criticise the players for anything tonight because we deserved more. ""We need to be patient because we are on the right track."" Real, though, were dealt a further blow as captain Sergio Ramos had to be replaced at half-time with a suspected broken nose. ""It is a fracture. He has a cut and I think it is broken,"" added Zidane. ""We still don't know how long he will be out."""
243,18/11/2017,22:52,Derby stalemate leaves Real 10 points behind Barca,Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid slipped 10 points behind Barcelona at the top of La Liga as a Madrid derby short on chances finished 0-0 at Atletico's Wanda Metropolitano on Saturday.,"Earlier, Barca also weren't at their best but Luis Suarez's double ended a five-game goal drought for the Uruguayan and Paulinho's late strike helped see off a determined Leganes 3-0. Angel Correa missed the best chance of the game after just three minutes as both Atletico and Real were left to rue a familiar lack of cutting edge in front of goal this season. After a bright start from Atletico, Real's first chance came on the counter-attack but Juanfran outpaced Cristiano Ronaldo when the Portuguese was put clean through by Luka Modric much to the home crowd's delight. The visitors slowly started to take control of possession as the first period wore on, but lacked a creative spark. Jan Oblak turned Toni Kroos's effort behind at the near post after a neat one-two with Ronaldo, before Sergio Ramos was left bloodied and eventually replaced at half-time as he was caught by Lucas Hernandez as he stooped to head into the side-netting. Ronaldo's profligacy has been blamed for Real's slump in form this season and the Portuguese was once again wayward when handed the chance to win the game 15 minutes from time. Modric picked out the World Player of the Year unmarked inside the Atletico box, but Ronaldo's tame effort dribbled wide. Both sides had chances to win it in a frantic finale as Raphael Varane headed Kevin Gameiro's lobbed effort off the line. At the other end, Ronaldo took just too long to wind up his effort as Hernandez galloped back into position to make a brave block and ensure Atletico a share of the spoils. Barca boss Ernesto Valverde admitted a 3-0 win flattered his side across Madrid at Butarque as goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen again shone. ""The important thing was to win,"" Suarez told BeIN Sports Spain. ""We always try to play our best in every game but sometimes it is not possible."" Leganes' good work in the opening half hour was undone by a goalkeeping error when Ivan Cuellar limply palmed Paco Alcacer's driven cross into the path of the grateful Suarez to smash home his first goal for a month. ""I wasn't anxious. The important thing was to feel good again and help the team,"" added Suarez. Barca's joy was tempered moments later when Gerard Pique was booked for bringing down Nordin Amrabat meaning he will be suspended for next weekend's top of the table clash at Valencia. The busy Ambrabat was the creator for Leganes' best chance before the break when he released Alexander Szymanowski inside the area, but the Argentine's curling effort was turned to safety by the in-form Ter Stegen. The German goalkeeper was called into action again early in the second period when Leganes substitute Claudio Beauvue was too quick for the Barca defence only to fire straight at Ter Stegen. In contrast, just as in the first half, Barca were ruthlessly efficient in front of goal to double their lead on the hour mark. Lionel Messi's dinked pass released Alcacer and after Cuellar parried his first effort, Suarez drilled home the rebound for his second of the afternoon. Barca rode their luck to hold out for a 12th clean sheet in their last 17 games as Ter Stegen saved one-on-one from Amrabat and Beauvue blasted well over when unmarked 10 yards out. ""Perhaps 0-3 is a bit excessive. They played well enough for the gap between the teams to not be so great,"" said Barca boss Valverde. However, Barca rubbed salt into Leganes' wounds when Paulinho rolled into an empty net when a loose ball broke off Messi in stoppage time."
244,17/11/2017,18:15,Madrid giants face similar issues ahead of derby,"Accustomed to a place at the top table in recent seasons, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid resume an old rivalry at a new home on Saturday with little room for error.","Early season struggles have left both sides eight points adrift of La Liga leaders Barcelona and four points below revitalised Valencia. The pair have each contested two Champions League finals and won a La Liga title in the past four seasons. Saturday's derby will be the first derby at Atletico's new Wanda Metropolitano stadium but the 20th since February 2014, with six wins apiece and seven draws in the 19 contests, a demonstration of how closely matched they have been. However, after stumbling out of the blocks this year, Real and Atletico find themselves playing catch up due to Barca's flying start. The poor form of their stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Antoine Griezmann, usually reliable sources of goals, has been a key problem for the Madrid sides. The two attackers went head-to-head for the Ballon d'Or last year after Ronaldo's Real and Portugal edged out Griezmann's Atletico and France in the Champions League and Euro 2016 finals respectively. However, Ronaldo has scored just once in seven La Liga appearances so far this season despite having 48 shots on goal. ""It's not my fault if (the ball) does not want to go in,"" Ronaldo told French sports newspaper L'Equipe on Thursday. ""People look at me like a goal machine, like a guy who has to score all the time."" Ronaldo's restlessness on the field has been mirrored by rising tension off it, with Madrid-based sports daily Marca reporting on his fractious relationship with Real captain Sergio Ramos this week. After being beaten 3-1 by Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley earlier this month, Ronaldo admitted the Madrid squad that delivered a first La Liga and Champions League double for 59 years had been weakened by the departures of Alvaro Morata, Pepe and James Rodriguez. Ramos later described those comments as ""opportunistic"", but Real boss Zinedine Zidane insisted on Friday ""there is no problem"" between the pair, who have been the scourge of Atletico. Ronaldo has scored more goals than anyone else in Madrid derby history with 21 in 29 games, while Ramos scored in both 2014 and 2016 Champions League finals to deny the red and white half of Madrid their first ever European Cup. ""I can say truthfully that in Sergio and Cristiano I have two players that will go down in the history of this club,"" said Zidane. ""Both of them know what is at stake and they respect each other a lot."" Griezmann has also scored in three of his last six meetings against Real, but has failed to find the net in his last seven Atletico games and was even substituted by Diego Simeone before Thomas Partey's injury-time strike earned them a hard-fought 1-0 win at Deportivo la Coruna two weeks ago. ""He is the most important offensive player we have,"" insisted Simeone on Friday. ""His best form is still to come but I have the feeling he is motivated."" Atletico's slow adaptation to the Wanda Metropolitano has played its part in their struggles. Simeone's men have failed to win any of their last four games at home in all competitions. However, the return of Koke and Yannick Carrasco from injury should at least inject some creativity back into an Atletico side badly lacking a spark. ""Koke is very important in the transition from defence to attack, as is Carrasco's movement. They are two very important players to have back,"" added Simeone. Real, by contrast, are still riddled with injuries, with Gareth Bale and Keylor Navas ruled out and Dani Carvajal possibly only fit enough for a place on the bench after a two-month absence.

245,15/11/2017,19:56,Griezmann unconcerned by goal drought,"Despite a seven match scoring drought, Atletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann insisted on Wednesday he is unconcerned ahead of Saturday's big derby against Real Madrid.","The France international had averaged more than a goal every two games in his previous three seasons for Atletico but has managed just three in 13 matches in all competitions this season. ""I'm not concerned, I'm delighted with my form. Eventually the ball will go in,"" said the 26-year-old in an interview on the official La Liga website. ""The only time I've felt pressure was when I held my daughter in my arms..."" ""But otherwise, (scoring) goals is what we're used to doing. Scoring is what we know how to do, and it will go in."" Griezmann's last Atleti goal was a penalty against Chelsea in the Champions League at the end of September. However, on Friday last week he did net a smart volley for France in a 2-0 friendly victory over Wales. ""During the week every shot goes in, but during the match, where it counts, it's more difficult for us,"" he said. Atletico may be unbeaten in La Liga this season but they've drawn five of their 11 matches and sit fourth, eight points off runaway leaders Barcelona and behind Real, their bitter city rivals, on goal difference. And while Barca and Valencia have bagged 30 goals each already, Atletico have mustered just 16. ""We're struggling to score, to put together victories. At the back I think we're solid but we're short of luck up front."" The 'Colchoneros' will host Real in the first city derby at their new Wanda Metropolitano stadium, having left the historic Vicente Calderon home at the end of last season. ""We have to win the first derby at the Wanda,"" added Griezmann. ""When our fans push, it's more difficult for our opponents."""
246,01/11/2017,01:45,Simeone defends goal-shy Atletico's style,Diego Simeone defended Atletico Madrid's style as another profligate performance left his side on the brink of an early Champions League exit after being held 1-1 at home by 10-man Qarabag.,"Back-to-back draws against the Azerbaijani champions, playing their first ever Champions League campaign, mean Simeone's men have to beat Roma at home and Chelsea away in their final two games and hope Qarabag perform more miracles to progress to the last 16. Atletico's major problem in recent months has been finding the net and their lack of cutting edge was demonstrated as they had the most attempts on goal of any side in the Champions League this season (32) for the reward of a solitary goal. Club captain Gabi claimed Atletico had lost their ""calling card"" after also conceding once again from a set-piece as Michel headed Qarabag into a first-half lead - the seventh time Simeone's men have conceded a headed goal this season. However, Simeone -- who recently renewed his contract to remain in charge of the Spanish side until 2020 -- defended his style of play. ""We have always played the same way,"" said the fiery Argentine. ""In the past six years we have won 30 or 40 games like this and the only difference is when you score the goal people talk about strength and spirit and, when you don't, they see the more negative part."" Atletico have paid a heavy price for a FIFA ban on registering new players until January, meaning club record signing Diego Costa and Vitolo can't feature until the new year. And that investment now looks questionable with Atletico, at best, set to drop into the Europa League barring an unlikely combination of results. ""I believe you get what you deserve,"" added Simeone ""We have to try to beat Roma and then destiny will decide if we deserve to continue or are eliminated."" Atletico rallied in the second half to level through Thomas Partey's fantastic long-range strike into the top corner. And the hosts had the advantage of an extra man for most of the last half-hour as Pedro Henrique saw red for a dangerous late challenge on Diego Godin. However, despite the being hemmed in, Qarabag survived as Godin, Filipe Luis and Nicolas Gaitan passed up big chances to snatch Atletico's first win in the group. ""What hurts most is that we don't have matters in our own hands, that is the cruel reality,"" added Gabi. ""We have to try and beat Roma and hope Qarabag are capable of holding Chelsea. ""At the moment we are out. We have a chance but it is very remote."""

Once again Diego Simeone's men were made to pay for their profligacy in front of goal after Michel headed the visitors into the lead five minutes before half-time. Thomas Partey's stunning drive from outside the box levelled 11 minutes into the second period and Qarabag had to survive for half an hour a man down after Pedro Henrique saw red. But Diego Godin, Filipe Luis and Nicolas Gaitan fluffed their lines with big chances to leave Atletico on the edge of the European abyss. Atletico have now won just once in their last eight games as their debut season at the Wanda Metropolitano is descending into a disaster. The hosts had started on the front foot as Antoine Griezmann's right-footed volley from the edge of the area forced Ibrahim Sehic into a smart save. However, despite the vast disparity in budgets between the sides, it was the visitors who looked the more composed side in possession as the first half wore on, drawing whistles from the frustrated home crowd. Henrique was first to threaten as he ghosted past the out of sorts Godin, but his cross was cut out by Stefan Savic with two teammates waiting to apply the finishing touch at the back post. Atletico's major problem in recent months has been finding the net and their lack of cutting edge was demonstrated as Sehic raced from his goal to smother Kevin Gameiro's shot from a narrow angle and Godin powered a header over. Simeone was infuriated when Jakub Rzezniczak was only shown a yellow card for hauling down Gameiro on the edge of the box 10 minutes before half-time. And the Argentine had even more to more to be concerned about five minutes later when Michel met Donald Guerrier's corner flush to send a header into the top corner despite Jan Oblak's best efforts. Of the 10 goals Atletico have conceded this season, seven have now come from headers as a former strength of Simeone's teams has quickly become an alarming weakness. Buoyed by a half-time dressing down from Simeone, Atletico again started the second period at a higher tempo and Gameiro somehow fired wide after Sehic had parried Angel Correa's initial effort straight back into the heart of the area. Moments later Atletico could have found themselves 2-0 behind but for a brilliant goal line clearance from Savic. That proved to be a turning point as Partey swept Griezmann's layoff into the top corner on 56 minutes. Qarabag were then reduced to 10 men just before the hour mark when Henrique was shown a straight red for a dangerous high challenge on Godin. The Uruguayan defender's eventful 90 minutes continued as he then saw a powerful header cleared off the line. Luis had the best chance to leave the 10 men without a reward when he stabbed wide when clean through. The Brazilian full-back sent another long-range effort off target and Godin saw another late header saved by Sehic. And Sehic saved Qarabag again in the dying seconds with a brilliant block from Gaitan, while Atletico were also reduced to 10 men when Savic was shown a second yellow. Atletico missed the creative impact of the injured Koke and Yannick Carrasco as a third straight home draw leaves their European dreams hanging by a thread."
248,30/10/2017,21:34,Atletico's lofty ambitions on the line - Simeone,Diego Simeone called on his Atletico Madrid side to prove they are among the best sides in the world on Monday ahead of a must-win Champions League clash against Qarabag of Azerbaijan.,"Atletico have taken a meagre two points from their opening three Group C games to put their chances of reaching the last 16 for a fifth straight season at serious risk. Chelsea lead the group on seven points, closely followed by Roma on five, and failure to progress would be a monumental blow to both Atletico's prestige and finances just months after moving into the 68,000-capacity Wanda Metropolitano stadium at a cost of 310 million euros ($360 million). ""You always want to improve, to win, to match the club's objectives,"" said Simeone. ""We want Atletico to be amongst the best sides in the world. It'd be bad if I wasn't worried."" Under Simeone's tutelage Atletico have twice reached the final and have also appeared in a semi-final and quarter-final in the Champions League over the past four seasons -- only to fall to cross city rivals Real Madrid on every occasion. However, a lack of a cutting edge up front has cost Los Rojiblancos dear both in the Champions League and La Liga so far this season and they passed up a number of chances in drawing 0-0 at Roma and Qarabag. The return of Diego Costa from Chelsea for a reported club record 55 million euros will help solve that problem once a one-year FIFA ban on Atletico registering new players ends in January. But Simeone's men will have to cope without Costa to make it out of the group stage. ""Our success in the last few years in all competitions means that if we don't get excellent results there's criticism,"" added Simeone. ""We need to live with that if we want to achieve excellence. We have a responsibility tomorrow (Tuesday). It's an important match for the club, the fans, the players and for me."" In search of a psychological boost, Atletico trained at their old Vicente Calderon stadium on Monday as a reminder of the European giants such as Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich they have beaten on home soil in the Champions League in recent seasons. ""It's always great to go back there, we've got great memories,"" said Atletico captain Gabi. ""It was a logistics thing more than anything, though. Hopefully tomorrow we can start to create memories here at the Metropolitano."" And the 34-year-old midfielder called on Atletico to use the European experience they have amassed in recent seasons to remain calm under pressure. ""We know we have no margin for error tomorrow but we've played bigger games. We can't afford to be anxious."" Atletico are again without the injured Koke and Yannick Carrasco, so Simeone is expected to stick with the side that started Saturday's 1-1 draw with Villarreal. Qarabag registered their first ever Champions League point by frustrating the Spaniards on home soil two weeks ago, but coach Gurban Gurbanov believes Atletico's perilous position makes it less likely lightning will strike twice. ""They'll be even more dangerous than usual given the fact they've got two points,"" said Gurbanov. ""It might be hard to surprise them. They're always up for it and come out motivated to win. ""We'll play in front of some amazing fans and hopefully my players can respond to that pressure."" Qarabag are also without top scorer Dino Ndlovu after he was sent off when the sides met two weeks ago."
249,30/10/2017,01:30,Punchless Atletico face Champions League knockout,"Finding themselves against the ropes, Atletico Madrid have to come out swinging and finally start landing punches to keep their Champions League dreams alive when Azerbaijani champions Qarabag visit the shiny new Wanda Metropolitano on Tuesday (1945GMT).","The move to the 68,000 capacity stadium, which will host next season's Champions League final, was seen as confirmation of Atletico's place among the European elite. Inspired by coach Diego Simeone, Atletico have twice reached the final, as well as the semis and quarters in the Champions League over the past four seasons - only to fall to cross city rivals Real Madrid on every occasion. On top of a 310 million euro ($360 million) outlay on their new home, Atletico made a huge economic effort to make their transition from the Vicente Calderon as smooth as possible despite a FIFA ban on registering new players. Simeone and key figures such as Antoine Griezmann, Saul Niguez and Koke were handed lucrative new contracts. Diego Costa also rejoined the club for a reported club record 55 million euros ($64.8 million) from Chelsea, but he and Atletico's other major recruit Vitolo can't feature until January. However, the gamble that Costa and Vitolo would provide the perfect boost to Atletico's Champions League campaign come the new year could backfire spectacularly as Simeone's men have taken a paltry two points from their opening three Group C games. Costa's old club Chelsea lead the way on seven points, closely followed by Roma on five. Atletico's problem is painstakingly obvious, they can't score goals. Griezmann's penalty in 2-1 home defeat to Chelsea last month is their only Champions League goal to date and they have managed just eight in their last eight La Liga games to fall eight points off the top. ""It's the same thing as always,"" Saul confessed after a 1-1 draw against third-tier Elche in the Copa del Rey. ""That lack of goals makes us anxious and we end up suffering."" Top scorer for the past three seasons, Griezmann's form has faltered with just three goals 11 matches. However, Simeone insisted the Frenchman has got Atletico into a ""bad habit"" of solving the team's attacking problems single-handedly for too long. Luciano Vietto, Fernando Torres and Kevin Gameiro have all been handed their opportunity to partner Griezmann in attack and failed when presented chances in front of goal. Some have also pointed the finger at Simeone's defensive tactics as Atletico have been punished for sitting back after taking the lead against Chelsea, Barcelona and in drawing 1-1 against Villarreal on Saturday. ""Simeone isn't the one missing the chances,"" wrote former Atletico favourite Paulo Futre in sports daily Marca on Sunday in defence of the Argentine. Griezmann, Yannick Carrasco and Torres all missed huge opportunities as Qarabag secured their first ever Champions League point in Baku two weeks ago. ""Now we have a final here at home,"" said Atletico's top scorer Angel Correa, his side's top scorer with a meagre four goals this season. ""We need to be calm because the only thing we lack is luck, we are creating the chances."" Atletico's fate remains in their own hands, but they need to be a lot more clinical if Costa is to avoid the ignominy of making his European return in the new year in the Europa League as his old club progress to the Champions League last 16."
250,18/10/2017,20:10,Atletico on brink of early European exit,Atletico Madrid suffered a fresh blow to their chances of progressing to the Champions League last 16 as 10-man Qarabag held on for a 0-0 draw to secure their first ever point in the competition in Baku.,"It could have been even worse for the 2014 and 2016 finalists had South African striker Dino Ndlovu won a penalty rather than being shown a second yellow card for diving 15 minutes from time. Atletico now have just two points from their opening three games and remain third in Group C behind Chelsea and Roma, who face off at Stamford Bridge later on Wednesday. The visitors had a host of chances to open the scoring in the first half, but suffered from a familiar lack of firepower in already their fourth 0-0 draw of the season. Yannick Carrasco and Antoine Griezmann were both denied by Ibrahim Sehic when clean through, whilst Jose Maria Gimenez fired inches wide from a corner before the break. However, it was Azerbaijani champions Qarabag, in their first ever season in the Champions League, who had the better chances in the second period. Ndlovu's rising effort flew inches over the bar before he thought he had won a penalty as he was clipped by Diego Godin inside the area. Instead, French referee Ruddy Buquet reduced the hosts to 10 men for what he thought was a dive. Atletico pressed unconvincingly in the search for a winner and their best chance came when Fernando Torres headed over after he too appeared to be pushed with the goal gaping five minutes from time. Buquet was unmoved, though, as Atletico's European campaign continues to stumble after a stalemate away to Roma and a 2-1 defeat at home to Chelsea."
251,15/10/2017,01:50,Atletico-Barca 'spectacle' overshadows political backdrop,Players and coaches of both Atletico Madrid and Barcelona hailed the atmosphere at Atletico's Wanda Metropolitano on Saturday as the thrills of a 1-1 draw drowned out fears the match would be overshadowed by political tension sweeping across Spain.,"Barca's previous match was played behind closed doors as a protest to a violent police crackdown on an independence referendum in Catalonia, deemed illegal by the Spanish government, on October 1. The Catalan giants' visit to the Spanish capital was marked by a wash of Spanish flags and chants of ""Viva Espana"" (long live Spain), but fans at the 68,000 capacity were more enthralled by action on the field. Luis Suarez salvaged a point for Barca nine minutes from time to cancel out Saul Niguez's stunning first-half strike for Atletico. ""It was a great game, in a great atmosphere, in a great stadium and we take it as a good point despite the fact we wanted to win,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde. ""What we like is playing and enjoying ourselves in a spectacular atmosphere like today,"" added Barca captain Andres Iniesta, who has called for dialogue between politicians on both sides of the independence debate. ""We played very well against a great team and what counts is that football is a spectacle."" Atletico only moved into the Metropolitano last month, but the stadium, which will host next season's Champions League final, has quickly received rave reviews. ""The stadium was marvellous,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""It was a great night of football for everyone with two great teams."" Both Simeone and Valverde also agreed that Lionel Messi was the star of the show once more, despite failing to add to his 17 goals this season for club and country. Messi only arrived back in Barcelona late on Thursday after rescuing Argentina's floundering World Cup qualifying campaign with a stunning hat-trick in the altitude of Quito, Ecuador on Tuesday to ensure his presence at next year's showpiece in Russia. ""Evidently that journey didn't tire him out too much,"" said a smiling Simeone. ""Messi was extraordinary. Every time the ball went through him there was danger."" Messi hit the post and saw a free-kick saved by Jan Oblak with the last kick of the game as Valverde's men had to settle for a point after opening their league campaign with seven straight wins. ""More than for the journey, he was more worn out from the tension accumulated in the games, but Leo always responds and we know the respect he demands from the opposition,"" added Valverde. ""When he gets the ball there is always the sensation anything can happen."" Real Madrid closed to within five points of Barca with victory at Getafe earlier on Saturday, but Valverde was still content with Barca's response to going behind. ""We go away with a positive feeling. We have to value the point against a great opponent, who went in front, and when Atletico go in front they manage that advantage well. ""Their tight defensive lines near their area made it difficult in the first half. ""In the second, we created chances with more clarity and that push and spirit in the second half got us a point."""
252,13/10/2017,18:13,Barca trip to Madrid 'just a game' - Valverde,"Barcelona visit Atletico Madrid in their first trip to the Spanish capital on Saturday since a Catalan independence referendum marred by violence, but Barca coach Ernesto Valverde attempted to quash talk of political tension by insisting it is just ""a game of football.""","In their last outing, Barca played behind closed doors as the October 1 referendum, deemed illegal by the Spanish government, took place amid chaotic scenes as police seized ballot papers and clashed with voters leaving 92 injured, among nearly 900 who sought medical attention. That match was described by Barca captain Andres Iniesta this week as one of the ""worst moments"" in his career, whilst Gerard Pique, an outspoken defender of Catalonia's right to self-determination, broke down in tears when addressing reporters after the match. However, Valverde hopes the biggest game of the La Liga season so far is a chance for fans to escape the political tension sweeping Spain rather than indulging in it. ""We are going to kid ourselves. It is a game between two teams who want to fight for La Liga and will be an intimidating atmosphere, but it is a game of football,"" Valverde said on Friday. ""Football is for people to enjoy themselves. To support their team, suffer with their team and enjoy it more than anything else."" Only 250 tickets have been made available to away fans at Atletico's new 68,000 capacity Wanda Metropolitano. However, many Atletico fans have taken to social media to encourage supporters not to politicise the match by waving Spanish flags by using the hashtag ""our flag is red and white"" on Twitter. Pique was jeered when playing for Spain in Alicante last week, but he received support for his willingness to speak out from Atletico defender Filipe Luis. ""I am a fan of Pique even if at times I don't agree with what he says,"" the Brazilian told El Mundo. ""He puts himself out there, he doesn't hide behind his fame to not say what he thinks. ""It is admirable and I wish more footballers were like him."" Despite a series of distractions, including the loss of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain and calls for Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu to resign on top of the Catalonia crisis, Barca have started La Liga with a perfect record after seven games. ""They have made an enormous effort in the absence of Neymar to continue being a competitive team,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone, whose side are six points behind Barca in fourth. ""They are in the generation of Pique, (Sergio) Busquets, (Lionel) Messi, (Luis) Suarez and what they transmit to the rest allows them to remain competitive. That is what they have shown in their start to the season."" That spectacular form has been thanks to Messi's 14 goals in 11 appearances for Barca this season. And the five-time World Player of the Year also rescued Argentina's floundering World Cup qualifying campaign with a stunning hat-trick against Ecuador on Tuesday to ensure their place in Russia next year. However, Barca are often vulnerable immediately after an international break with the likes of Messi and Suarez only returning to training in Barcelona on Friday. ""Many of them have come from playing decisive games and the level of tension accumulated over the break is important,"" added Valverde. ""Atletico have also had players away and if is was a less attractive match it might worry me more. ""We are aware of how difficult it will be and the magnitude of the game helps to remain concentrated."" Iniesta is, though, expected to be fit after missing Spain's final World Cup qualifiers with a hamstring strain. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
253,27/09/2017,22:59,Batshuayi hands Chelsea deserved win,Michy Batshuayi struck a dramatic winner with the last kick of the game as Chelsea inflicted Atletico Madrid's first defeat at their new Wanda Metropolitano home on Wednesday with a hugely impressive 2-1 victory.,"Substitute Batshuayi's late intervention was just rewards for a dominant Chelsea display despite falling behind to Antoine Griezmann's penalty five minutes before half-time. Former Real Madrid striker Alvaro Morata came back to haunt Atletico on his return to the Spanish capital by nodding home Eden Hazard's tempting cross on the hour mark. And Batshuayi finished off a patient team move deep into stoppage time by turning home Marcos Alonso's cross at the near post. Victory ensured Chelsea take a commanding lead at the top of Group C with six points from their opening two games ahead of Roma, who moved onto four with a 2-1 win at Azerbaijani Champions League newcomers Qarabag earlier in the day. Atletico, by contrast, are in trouble after taking just one point from their opening two games. The presence of Diego Costa dominated much of the pre-match attention after he completed his prolonged return to Atletico from Chelsea on Tuesday. Despite the Brazilian-born striker's refusal to train with the Premier League champions this season it was all smiles as he greeted plenty of his former teammates in the tunnel before kick-off. However, Chelsea haven't missed Costa so far this season as his replacement Morata has now scored seven goals in as many games. Morata, though, hadn't scored in six previous appearances against Atletico for Juventus and Real and passed up a series of early chances as Chelsea dominated. Twice the Spanish international pulled shots wide after excellent build-up play from the outstanding Hazard. Hazard was starting for only the second time this season after breaking his ankle in June, but showed no signs of rust early on as he smacked a shot from outside the box off the post. Morata then finally forced Jan Oblak into a save as the Slovenian tipped his looping header over for a corner. Chelsea's control forced Atletico boss Diego Simeone into a tactical reshuffle as he switched from his favoured 4-4-2 to 4-3-3 and was rewarded as the hosts stemmed the Chelsea tide. David Luiz snuffed out Juanfran's dangerous cross for Griezmann in Atletico's first real attack 10 minutes before half-time. However, the Brazilian was then at fault for Atletico's opener as he was penalised for hauling down Angel Correa from a corner. Griezmann kept his cool to smash the penalty past a former Atletico favourite Thibaut Courtois for his third goal in as many games at Atletico's new home. And for all Chelsea's pressure, Atletico could easily have been two up at the break as Courtois parried Koke's fierce drive and Saul Niguez fired the rebound inches wide with the final kick of the half. The second period began in the same manner as the first with Chelsea on the front foot. But it took until the hour mark to level when Morata continued his scoring streak with his head with a flicked finish from Hazard's pinpoint delivery. Cesc Fabregas should then have turned the game on its head when he somehow skewed wide from point-blank range following a goalmouth scramble. Morata had another chance to win the game as he showed impressive pace the sprint past Lucas Hernandez but pushed his finish inches past the far post 15 minutes from time. However, it was his replacement Batshuayi who proved the match winner with a smart finish after Chelsea work the ball masterfully around a tiring Atletico defence to create the opening."
254,26/09/2017,21:43,Costa delighted to be 'home' at Atletico,Spain striker Diego Costa claimed he was coming home after completing his return to Atletico Madrid from Chelsea on Tuesday.,"Both clubs finally reached an agreement for a reported initial 55 million euro deal ($64.8 million) on Thursday and the Brazilian-born striker has now completed his medical with the Spanish giants. ""I'm very happy to return home, I've always said it, Atletico is my home, I'm very, very happy,"" he told the club's website. Costa can't feature until January as his move was completed outside the transfer window. However, Atletico said he will begin training immediately and is likely to be in the stands when Chelsea are the visitors for the first ever Champions League game at Atletico's new Wanda Metropolitano on Wednesday. ""The international forward signed his new contract after successfully passing the medical tests that he underwent in two phases: last Saturday and Monday,"" Atletico said in a statement ""Starting tomorrow, he will join the team's trainings, but he will not be registered until the next winter market opens on January 1st."" Costa was Atletico's top scorer as they won La Liga and reached the Champions League final in 2013/14 before moving to Chelsea where he won two Premier League titles in three seasons. ""I'm looking forward to start contributing. I'm going to give my all for the team, as I always try to do,"" added Costa, who will wear the number 19 jersey."

However, the man who fired Atletico to La Liga in 2013/14, could still have a vital part to play in Atletico's title challenge as they maintained an impressive start to the season despite the difficulties of a ban on registering new players and with their first three league games of the season away from home as a new 68,000 capacity home was completed. Sevilla travelled to the Spanish capital unbeaten so far this season and came close early on when Pablo Sarabia's shot was deflected onto his own post by Stefan Savic. At the other end Filipe Luis then smashed the underside of the bar from Yannick Carrasco's cutback in Atletico's best effort of a first-half short on clear-cut chances. However, it took less than a minute of the second-half to break the deadlock when Carrasco showed great awareness and pace to latch onto a short back pass from Steven N'Zonzi to beat Sergio Rico to the ball, round the keeper and slot into an empty net. Griezmann then made the game safe 20 minutes from time as the French international won a tackle inside the Sevilla box before lifting himself off the floor to receive Luis's pass and drill through Rico's legs. Diego Simeone then quickly withdrew Griezmann and Carrasco to keep them fresh for Wednesday's visit of Chelsea in the Champions League. But Atletico comfortably saw out the final stages to move to within a point of La Liga leaders Barcelona, who travel to Girona later on Saturday. Real Madrid are also in action later at Alaves as they aim to close a seven-point gap on Barca following a shock 1-0 home defeat to Real Betis in midweek."

257,21/09/2017,15:58,Costa to return to Atletico from Chelsea,Chelsea and Atletico Madrid announced Thursday that they had reached an initial agreement that would see Diego Costa return to the Spanish club.,"""Atletico de Madrid and Chelsea have reached an initial agreement for the transfer of Diego Costa,"" the Spanish side said in a statement. ""The agreement is pending the formalisation of the contract between our club and the Spanish international forward. ""The English club has authorised Diego Costa to travel to Madrid in the coming days to undergo medical tests and settle his contract with our club."" Chelsea said they had ""agreed terms with Atletico Madrid for the transfer of Diego Costa"". ""The transfer will be subject to the agreement of personal terms and a medical."" Costa, 28, has been frozen out by Chelsea manager Antonio Conte and spent the transfer window angling for a return to former club Atletico that never materialised. Sports dailies Marca and Mundo Deportivo earlier said the two clubs had sealed a deal for the Brazil-born forward's return to Spain until 2021. The deal was worth 60 million euros ($71.3m), according to AS, while Marca said Atletico will pay 55 million euros with a further 10 million euros in add-ons. Costa will not, however, find himself straight back in action, with Atletico officially banned from registering new players until January. Costa was not included in Chelsea's 25-man squad for the Champions League group phase, ironically drawn in Group C along with Atletico. That ensured he would not become cup-tied and therefore remains free to play in the competition for another team in the second part of the season. The reported transfer fee smashes Atletico's record of 40 million euros paid for Radamel Falcao in 2011. Costa returns as a hero at Atletico having led Los Rojiblancos to their only La Liga title in the past two decades and the Champions League final by scoring 36 goals in the 2013/14 season. His first stint at the club ended in injury and anguish as Costa limped off with a hamstring injury less than 10 minutes into the Champions League final against local rivals Real Madrid. Atletico went on to lose in extra time. However, the fact coach Diego Simeone started the Brazilian-born striker in Lisbon despite his injury problems is testament to the Argentine's faith in Costa and Simeone has tried on several occasions to bring Costa back to the club since he left for Chelsea in 2014. Indeed, according to Spanish media reports, Costa's return was one of the key demands from Simeone before extending his contract with Atletico to 2020 earlier this month. Costa also had his mind set on a return after being told by Chelsea boss Conte that he was no longer part of his plans despite scoring 20 Premier League goals as Chelsea regained the title last season. ""I will only leave Chelsea for Atletico,"" Costa told reporters in June before returning to Brazil, where he spent all summer ignoring Chelsea's requests to return to training. A grudge match when the two sides meet in the Champions League next week will be avoided as Costa can't be registered until January. However, his return gives Atletico a huge boost in their quest to finally land the Champions League title come the new year after falling to Real in the latter stages in each of the last four seasons. Moreover, next season Atletico have the chance to lift the trophy on home soil after their new 68,000-seater Wanda Metropolitano stadium was chosen as the venue for the 2019 Champions League final."

And Yannick Carrasco secured the three points with an angled finish from another Griezmann through ball 17 minutes from time before Raul Garcia netted a late consolation for the hosts. Atletico closed to within four points of leaders Barcelona, but could be surpassed by Sevilla and Real Madrid who host Las Palmas and Real Betis respectively later on Wednesday. UEFA awarded their showpiece event for next season to Atletico's new Wanda Metropolitano earlier in the day. And the feel-good factor around Atletico following their 1-0 victory over Malaga to open their new 68,000 capacity home at the weekend continued with a commanding display in their fifth away trip in six games so far this season. The visitors needed to rely on a brilliant penalty save from Jan Oblak to go in level at half-time. The Slovenian stopper leapt low to his right to deny Aritz Aduriz after Filipe Luis had been extremely harshly penalised for a challenge on Garcia outside the box. At the other end Atletico had the killer touch they lacked in stalemates at Valencia and Roma in their Champions League opener last week. Correa was left with the simplest of finishes to roll into an empty net after Saul unselfishly squared from Griezmann's through ball to open the scoring. Griezmann then had a goal ruled out for offside and strong penalty appeals himself waived away. But despite failing to get on the scoresheet, the French international was decisive with another killer pass for substitute Carrasco to fire just inside the far corner. Oblak made another fine save to deny Iker Muniain, although the Slovenian was finally beaten when Garcia scored against his former side in stoppage time."

The noise matched the pre-match pomp as Spain's royal air force took part in a flyover, whilst the match ball was delivered by paragliders. Spanish king Felipe VI, an Atletico fan, was also in attendance, but after all the pre-match fan fare, there wasn't much for the crowd to get enthused about in the opening 45 minutes. Correa had Atletico's only two clear chances of the half as he blazed over and straight at Roberto Jimenez. At the other end Jan Oblak was forced into a fine save from ex-Atletico striker Borja Baston as Malaga broke dangerously. Atletico started the second period brighter as Roberto denied Koke and Saul Niguez before the deadlock was broken on the hour mark. Correa burst clear down the right and his low cross was expertly guided inside the near post by Griezmann on his weaker right foot. Malaga had one late chance to rain on Atletico's parade two minutes from time, but Oblak was again up to the task to turn Diego Rolan's fierce effort over the bar. Barca were also made to struggle as they had to come from behind at Getafe to open up a seven-point lead over Real Madrid, who travel to Real Sociedad on Sunday. However, Barca could be without record signing Ousmane Dembele for a number of weeks after the French winger hobbled off in the first half with a hamstring injury. ""Fortunately, it was an important test for us. We managed to turn the game around and that power of reaction the team had means a lot,"" said Barca boss Ernesto Valverde. Paulinho's 40 million-euro signing from Guangzhou Evergrande was just one of a number of much-criticised moves by the Barca board following the departure of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain. But the Brazilian international showed his worth by smashing home Lionel Messi's through ball to score the winner. ""I'm very happy to score the goal. It was the winner which was the most important thing,"" Paulinho told Barca TV. ""It was a difficult game because Getafe have players with quality and we conceded the first goal but we were calm, had patience and went looking for the result."" Barca had barely replaced Dembele with Gerard Deulofeu before they fell behind six minutes before half-time. Sergi Roberto's headed clearance fell invitingly for Gaku Shibasaki, who made his name with two goals against Real Madrid in last year's Club World Cup final for Kashima Antlers, to thunder an unstoppable dipping volley beyond Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Valverde made another change at the start of the second period as Denis Suarez replaced Iniesta. And it was the substitute who inspired Barca's revival as he collected Roberto's cut-back from the right wing before bending the ball high past Vicente Guaita into the top corner. With Messi well-marshalled and Luis Suarez way off form for most of the second period, Getafe had chances to grab a winner themselves. However, the hosts were hit with a sucker punch when Paulinho burst onto Messi's through ball and smashed across the despairing Guaita into the far corner."
261,15/09/2017,02:05,Atletico seek home comforts in new stadium debut,Atletico Madrid begin a fresh era on Saturday when their new 310 million-euro ($370 million) home opens with the visit of Malaga to the Wanda Metropolitano.,"Diego Simeone's side have been forced to play their first four games of the season away as the finishing touches were made to the 68,000-capacity venue, nearly 20 kilometres north-east from their old Vicente Calderon stadium. Work will continue outside the ground for much of the rest of the season with access roads still to be completed, forcing Atletico to launch a marketing campaign this week encouraging as many fans as possible to access the remote location close to the city's airport by public transport. ""The people at the club are worried that the atmosphere is good and that everything goes perfectly, but perfection doesn't exist,"" said Simeone, after showing his commitment to Atletico's future by extending his contract to 2020. ""It will take months for everything to take shape. When you build a house, there are problems with the bathroom, or the air conditioning, or the heating, you need a plumber or you have an argument with the architect. ""In a stadium of this size, of course we'll have those issues, but above all outside the ground."" Inside it is a different story with an immaculate pitch laid last week the final touch. The stands hug the touchline on all four sides of the ground, much to Simeone's delight, despite the initial construction on the stadium being done with an eye to Madrid's failed bid to host the 2020 Olympics. ""The stadium, the stands, the seats, it is all marvellous,"" added Simeone. ""Imagining the Atletico fans here and knowing them well, this will be a pressure cooker because the fans are glued to the pitch. ""It generates hope and enthusiasm and when there is hope and enthusiasm, good things always happen."" Atletico have held up well under the strain of playing away as they remain unbeaten this season and should have comfortably won a 0-0 draw at Roma in their Champions League opener on Wednesday but for a series of wasted opportunities. Antoine Griezmann returns from his two-game domestic suspension, whilst Atletico couldn't have hoped for a more amenable guest as Malaga travel to the Spanish capital without a point from their opening three games and with coach Michel fighting for his job. Like Atletico, Real Madrid have taken just five points from their first three games, but in very different circumstances after disappointing home draws against Valencia and Levante. Coach Zinedine Zidane also has a lack of strikers to choose from for the trip to Real Sociedad -- who top the table alongside Barcelona -- on Sunday. Cristiano Ronaldo serves the final game of his five-match domestic ban, while Karim Benzema is out with a hamstring injury. Zidane lamented Real's failure to replace the departed Alvaro Morata in the transfer market this week, particularly in the absence of Ronaldo, who showed what Real have been missing by scoring twice in a 3-0 win over APOEL Nicosia on Wednesday. ""He is a key player for us, he is always scoring goals,"" said Zidane. ""We'll be without him again on Sunday and I hope it is for the last game this season."" Elsewhere, Barcelona will be expected to keep their fine run of form rolling with a fifth consecutive win when the visit newly-promoted Getafe on Saturday. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
262,08/09/2017,02:00,"Dembele debuts, Atletico face resurgent Valencia",The most expensive player in Barcelona's history will take to the field for the first time on Saturday as Ousmane Dembele debuts in a Catalan derby against Espanyol.,"Atletico Madrid travel to a revitalised Valencia in the headline clash of the weekend, whilst there is an early start for champions Real Madrid. Here, AFP Sports looks at five things to watch from the La Liga weekend. The arrival of the 105-million-euro ($125 million) Frenchman is a much-needed tonic for Barca in the midst of continuing institutional chaos with ongoing public clashes between the board and leading players. President Josep Maria Bartomeu claimed new contracts for Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta, whose deals expire next summer, were a matter of time on Tuesday only for Iniesta to flatly deny that claim a day later. On the field Barca need to ensure they don't suffer their habitual hangover from international breaks known locally as the ""FIFA virus"". This time last year Barca suffered a shock 2-1 home defeat to Alaves as Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez started on the bench following their international commitments. With Messi and Suarez only arriving back in the Catalan capital on Thursday after two crucial World Cup qualifiers in South America, Espanyol will rarely have a better chance for a first win at the Camp Nou since 2009. It has been a highly promising week for Atletico as inspirational coach Diego Simeone extended his contract till 2020, whilst the pitch was laid among finishing touches to the club's new 68,000 capacity stadium. Since Simeone took charge in 2011, Valencia have had 11 coaches. However, their latest hire in Marcelino finally appears to putting Los Che back on the right track. Valencia took a point from a thrilling 2-2 draw away to Real Madrid before the international break and have since been further boosted by the arrivals of Goncalo Guedes and Andreas Pereira on loan from PSG and Manchester United. Should Atletico emerge unscathed from the Mestalla not having lost ground on Real after three away games to start their season, a serious title challenge is realistic. La Liga president Javier Tebas has continued his war against PSG's free-spending since snatching Neymar away from Barcelona, accusing the Parisians and Manchester City of ""peeing into the pool"" in their disrespect for financial fair play. Tebas' concerns arise from his ambition for La Liga to rival the Premier League's interest around the world and getting television rights deals to match. With that in mind, kick-off times in Spain have become gradually earlier in recent years with an eye on Asian markets. Real's kick-off against Levante at 1300 local time (1100 GMT) on Saturday will go head-to-head with City's blockbuster clash against Liverpool. Overshadowed by the wealth and glamour of Real and Atletico, two of Madrid's more modest sides Leganes and Getafe have fought out their own rivalry in the lower divisions. However, they clash for the first time ever in the top flight on Friday night at Leganes' 11,500 capacity Butarque with the hosts even having the chance to leapfrog Barcelona to the top of the table after two wins from their opening two games. Exactly a year from the day he left, Lucas Perez returned to Deportivo la Coruna from Arsenal on the final day of the transfer window. ""Money doesn't make me happy. I move for emotions, for the feelings that I have,"" said Perez, claiming he had turned down more lucrative offers to force through a return to his native Galicia. Perez scored 17 goals in the 2015/16 season before his move and will need to fire if Depor are to avoid another year of battling relegation, starting with the visit of Real Sociedad on Sunday."
263,05/09/2017,12:25,Diego Simeone extends Atletico deal to 2020,"Diego Simeone committed his future to Atletico Madrid by agreeing a two-year contract extension to remain as coach of the Spanish giants until 2020, Atletico announced on Tuesday.","""The renewal of Diego Pablo Simeone is now a reality,"" Atletico said in a statement. ""Our coach has signed a new contract that ties him to Atletico Madrid for two more seasons, until June 30, 2020."" Simeone, 47, has enjoyed huge success since taking over an Atletico side in the doldrums back in 2011. The Argentine has led Atletico to one of the most successful eras in the club's history, including a first La Liga title in 18 years in the 2013/14 season. Atletico have also reached two Champions League finals under Simeone's tutelage, but lost out in heartbreaking fashion on both occasions to cross city rivals Real Madrid in 2014 and 2016. Simeone's decision to remain brings some much-needed stability as Atletico prepare to move to into their new 68,000-capacity Wanda Metropolitano home this season. On top of La Liga, Simeone has also won the Europa League (2012), UEFA Super Cup (2012), Copa del Rey (2013) and Spanish Super Cup (2014) since returning to coach the team he had two spells with as a player. Simeone initially signed a contract to 2020 back in March 2015. However, he then asked for the deal to be reduced by two years, sparking rumours he could opening the door for a move to another of his former clubs Inter Milan or even to coach the Argentina national team. Despite being hampered by a ban on registering new players during the recently closed transfer window, Atletico have continued to build for the future by handing long-term contract extensions to leading players such as Antoine Griezmann, Koke and Saul Niguez. And Simeone has now also agreed to prolong his stay as the longest-serving coach in La Liga."
264,23/08/2017,16:14,Griezmann handed two-game ban for ref insult,France international forward Antoine Griezmann was handed a two-game ban by the Spanish Football Federation on Wednesday after he was sent off at the weekend for insulting the referee.,"The 26-year-old was dismissed during Atletico Madrid's 2-2 draw at Gerona on Saturday during the opening weekend of the La Liga season. He also received a 600-euro ($700) fine, while Atletico were penalised 700 euros. Both have the right to appeal their sanctions. Griezmann will miss league matches against Las Palmas on Saturday and Valencia on September 9. He was shown a straight red card an hour into Saturday's match after insulting the referee for not awarding a penalty in his favour. He later apologised. Real Madrid centre-back Sergio Ramos has also been handed a one-match ban after he was sent off for two yellow cards in the European and Spanish champions' 3-0 win at Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday. And Argentine Ever Banega was hit with a two-match suspension after the midfielder was also sent off for insulting the referee during Sevilla's 1-1 draw with Espanyol on Saturday."
265,17/08/2017,01:45,"New stadium, old challenge for hamstrung Atletico","For an off-season that began by losing an appeal against a one-year transfer ban, Atletico Madrid have emerged impressively unscathed as they welcome in a new era by moving to the newly built Wanda Metropolitano.","The challenge for a club revolutionised since Diego Simeone took charge nearly six years ago remains a daunting one. Despite Atletico's significant financial growth off the field in recent years, their budget still lags hundreds of millions of euros behind their competitors for domestic and Champions League honours in Real Madrid and Barcelona. Since stunning Real and Barca to win La Liga in 2013/14, Atletico have finished third for the past three seasons, but were 15 points back on champions Real last season. However, it is a sign of Atletico's progress that having to rebuild every summer after cashing in on their best players is now a thing of the past. Antoine Griezmann, Atletico's top scorer for the past three seasons, resisted the advances of Manchester United to commit his immediate future to the club in June. And in a major coup in-demand midfielder Saul Niguez also signed a nine-year contract extension after a starring role for Spain in the Under-21 European Championship. ""The club have made an important effort to maintain the players that the best teams in the world want,"" said Simeone. Holding onto their best players was more important than ever as Atletico can't register new signings until January. ""Maintaining the group that managed to have a fantastic season is not a problem. I see it as a success,"" Atletico CEO Miguel Angel Gil told the club's website. ""We should be proud to be able to continue counting on a group of players that have given us so much in the past few years."" Atletico's ban also hasn't prevented them from strengthening for the upcoming season. Spanish international winger Vitolo will join in the new year following six months on loan at Las Palmas after Atletico paid his 37.5 million-euro ($43 million) buyout clause to release him from Sevilla. And a return for the hero of Atletico's title-winning campaign three years ago, Diego Costa, is expected to be completed with the Brazilian-born striker refusing to train with Chelsea. Those reinforcements should make Simeone's men serious contenders to finally land the Champions League after being eliminated in each of the past four seasons by Real. However, they may come too late for Atletico to mount a realistic title challenge, especially as they get used to their new surroundings at the Wanda Metropolitano. Atletico will play their first three league games away from home to allow construction to be completed. Meanwhile, there are fears the intimidating atmosphere created at the Vicente Calderon won't be repeated after the move nearly 20 kilometres north-east to an out-of-town location by the city's airport. However, Gil Marin insists Atletico's fans' enthusiasm hasn't been sapped by the move. ""Before opening we have more season-ticket holders than the capacity of the Vicente Calderon which confirms the enormous social growth of Atletico Madrid."""
266,08/08/2017,14:19,Atletico's Kranevitter seals Zenit move,"Argentine international midfielder Matias Kranevitter joined Zenit St Petersburg from Atletico Madrid on a four-year deal, both clubs confirmed on Tuesday.","Neither club disclosed the fee, but reports in the Spanish media claim Atletico will receive 8.5 million euros ($10 million) for the 24-year-old. ""Atletico Madrid and Zenit St Petersburg have reached an agreement for the transfer of Matias Kranevitter to the Russian side,"" Atletico said in a statement. Kranevitter joined Atletico in December 2015 from River Plate, but made just 11 appearances for the Spanish giants in the 2015/16 campaign before being loaned out to Sevilla last season."
267,25/07/2017,18:13,Report: Simeone extends Atletico contract to 2019,"Atletico Madrid head coach Diego Simeone has extended his contract with the capital club until 2019, according to a report by Spanish radio station Cadena SER.","The 47-year-old Argentinian had shortened his contract from 2020 to 2018 after his side's Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid last year. But Cadena SER reported on Tuesday that he had ""reached an agreement with Atletico to extend his contract by an extra year"", without giving further details. Since cutting the length of his contract, Simeone has repeatedly stated his desire to stay at Atletico, who he has led to three major trophies including the 2014 La Liga title."

Atletico are moving into their brand new 70,000 capacity Wanda Metropolitano after quitting their creaking and much smaller home since 1966, the Vicente Calderón. Villarreal are finishing off the refurbishment of their main stand."
269,10/07/2017,22:04,New Real recruit Hernandez looking to learn from 'world's best players',"Real Madrid's new French left-back Theo Hernandez said Monday he joined the Spanish champions from cross-city rivals Atletico Madrid because he wants to learn from the ""world's best players"".","""I am very happy to be here, the best club in the world, and I have come here to learn from the best players in the world,"" the 19-year-old said at his official presentation at Real's Santiago Bernabeu stadium. ""I am going to follow their footsteps and try to improve each day,"" he added later at his first press conference as a Real player. Hernandez, who impressed while on loan at Basque side Alaves last season, signed with Real for the next six seasons for a reported fee of 30 million euros ($34 million). He rejected numerous offers of a new deal from Atletico, where he was under contract until 2021, and other European clubs, reiterating his desire to play for Real Madrid. Liverpool and Real's arch rivals Barcelona were both reportedly chasing the player. ""You are a Real player because of your talent, because of what you have shown you can do despite being extremely young and because of your personality,"" Real president Florentino Perez said before presenting Hernandez with a team jersey bearing his name and the number 15. ""You wanted to wear this jersey above all others even though other big clubs, as we all know, wanted you. Your determination and conviction are gestures which Real fans will not forget."" Hernandez, a France Under-20 international, joined Atletico in 2008 aged 11 but never made a first team appearance for the side. He played 38 games for Alaves on loan last season as they reached the Copa Del Rey final, where he scored a thunderbolt free-kick in a 3-1 defeat by Barcelona at Atletico's old Vicente Calderon stadium -- his only competitive appearance there. The player's father Jean-Francois Hernandez was also a professional footballer with Toulouse, Marseille and Atletico, while his elder brother Lucas Hernandez also plays for Diego Simeone's capital-city side."
270,10/07/2017,16:17,Costa given extra time off with Chelsea future uncertain,"Diego Costa has been permitted by Premier League champions Chelsea to miss the start of pre-season training on Monday, fuelling speculation he is set to rejoin Atletico Madrid.","The 28-year-old Brazil-born Spanish international is still keen on a return to Atletico despite them not being allowed to field new players until January because of a transfer ban. ""Another absentee (new signing Antonio Rudiger was also absent) was Diego Costa, after it was agreed with the club that he should have an extra few days off,"" read a statement on the club website. Costa enjoyed a fractious relationship with Chelsea manager Antonio Conte last season despite scoring 20 goals in 35 league appearances in Chelsea's title-winning campaign. Indeed the player revealed last month the Italian had texted him to say he was no longer part of his plans. However, Conte's aim of replacing Costa with Romelu Lukaku went badly astray when the Belgian international jilted Chelsea's advances for Manchester United's, despite both clubs offering the same transfer fee of £75million ($97m, 85.5m euros). Costa -- whse contract runs till 2019 -- caught the eye in his four-year spell at Atletico before joining Chelsea for £32million in 2014. Last month Atletico lost an appeal against a FIFA-imposed sanction which means that, while they can still buy players this summer, they will not be able to register or play them until January."
271,05/07/2017,23:39,Torres extends Atletico deal for an extra year,"Striker Fernando Torres will stay at Atletico Madrid until the end of next season after signing a contract extension, the La Liga club announced on Wednesday.","The former Spain international's contract had run out, but he will now stay at Atletico until June 30, 2018. The capital-city side are under a transfer ban, but it has been a successful close-season so far for coach Diego Simeone, having also seen key forward Antoine Griezmann pen a new deal to keep him at the club until 2022. ""I am really happy to continue one more year together,"" Torres said on the club's website. Torres joined Atletico's academy at the age of 11, and went on to score 91 goals in 244 games for the senior team from 2001-2007. He rejoined his boyhood club from Chelsea, where he won the 2012 Champions League title, in 2015 on loan, before signing a permanent contract last summer. The 33-year-old netted a brace in Atletico's final match at the Vicente Calderon against Athletic Bilbao in May, ahead of their move to the new Estadio La Peineta for the coming season. Torres also scored 38 international goals for Spain, winning Euro 2008, when he scored the only goal in the final against Germany, and the 2010 World Cup."

""At only 19 years of age, Theo was one of the most outstanding players in the league last season.""

""I am very happy because at Atleti we are a family and there is no better place to be,"" Saul said in a statement on the club's website. ""I will work my full potential on the field as always to pay back the trust that the club is giving to me. I'd like to thank all my teammates and the coaching staff for their help day by day so that I can be the player I am today."" Saul has scored 22 goals in 148 appearances for the Atletico senior team, helping them reach the Champions League final in 2016.

Hernandez was arrested at the Madrid airport in the company of his girlfriend, who was not arrested as her own restraining order has not yet been ratified. According to the Onda Cero radio station, the two arrived at the airport after returning from a holiday in the Bahamas. In February, Hernandez had been arrested after his girlfriend was taken to hospital with minor injuries following a fight between them. Neither made a complaint against the other but Spain's public prosecutor charged both anyway. Hernandez's younger brother Theo, 19, has also been in trouble recently. The highly-rated teenager, who is also an Atletico player but looks set to move to Real Madrid this summer, was cleared last week after a complaint of sexual assault had been made against him."

There are concerns that will prevent them from having a team that can compete at the top of La Liga and in the Champions League next season, when they move into a new 68,000-capacity stadium. But, in an interview with Sunday morning programme Telefoot, Griezmann said: ""The CAS sanction has come in. Atletico can't make any signings. With my advisor Eric Olhats we have decided to stay. ""It is a difficult moment for the club. It wouldn't be very nice to leave now. We have spoken with the board and we are going to go again for next season,"" added Griezmann, who is currently with the France squad for next Friday's 2018 World Cup qualifier away to Sweden. ""The questions about my future have been a bit annoying."" Griezmann, 26, scored for France in Friday's 5-0 friendly win over Paraguay in Rennes. He had sparked speculation by declaring last month that there was a ""six out of 10"" chance that he would go to Manchester United and a ""seven out of 10"" chance of him staying at Atletico in a separate French television interview."
280,01/06/2017,14:17,Man Utd cool interest in Griezmann - reports,"Manchester United have cooled their interest in signing Atletico Madrid's French forward Antoine Griezmann, according to British media reports on Thursday.","Europa League winners United were reported to be plotting an approach for 26-year-old Griezmann. But several media outlets, including the BBC and Britain's Press Association, said United were instead shifting their focus towards a more conventional centre-forward, citing an internal source. United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has sustained a long-term knee injury and is due to be out of contract at the end of the month. The Court of Arbitration for Sport on Thursday upheld a transfer ban against Atletico over irregularities in the signing of foreign players under the age of 18. It means the Madrid club will not be able to register new players until January 2018. Atletico were reportedly intending to sell Griezmann and replace him with his France team-mate Alexandre Lacazette of Lyon. Griezmann is close friends with United midfielder Paul Pogba and has dropped hints about wanting to move to Old Trafford in recent weeks. In a recent French television appearance, he said there was a ""6/10"" chance of him joining United and a ""7/10"" chance of him staying at Atletico. Griezmann joined Atletico from Real Sociedad in 2014 and has scored 83 goals in 160 games for the club, with whom he reached the Champions League final in 2016."
281,01/06/2017,11:00,CAS upholds Atletico transfer ban,Atletico Madrid will be unable to sign new players until January 2018 after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Thursday upheld their transfer ban.,"Atletico and city rivals Real Madrid were barred from registering new players for two transfer windows in January 2016 for irregularities in the signing of foreign players under 18. ""This ruling is unfair and causes an irreparable damage to our club,"" Atletico said in a statement. Atletico, who appealed the ban in April, are reported to be hoping to sell striker Antoine Griezmann to Manchester United and replace him with another Frenchman, Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette. Both Atletico and Real saw initial appeals rejected by FIFA last September, although CAS reduced Real's sanction in December, allowing the European champions to recruit new players as of this summer. Atletico stressed, however, that it had ""full confidence in our current squad, with which we have won direct passage to the Champions League for the fifth year in a row and have reached the semi-finals of the Champions League and the King's Cup"". ""The club has the commitment of the players and coaching staff to continue competing at the same level next season, despite this decision that is evidently detrimental to us. ""Together, team, club and supporters, we will continue to fight for our goals."" Atletico added: ""Our sports planning for next season has contemplated at all times the two scenarios that could arise once CAS announced their decision. ""From this moment on, the club will move forward in the negotiations necessary to formalise the operations to register players from the 1st of January, when we will be authorised by FIFA to register new licenses."""

The club are reported to be hoping to sell striker Antoine Griezmann to Manchester United and replace him with another Frenchman, Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette. Atletico and city rivals Real Madrid were barred from registering new players for two transfer windows in January 2016 for irregularities in the signing of foreign players under 18. Both clubs saw initial appeals rejected by FIFA last September, although CAS reduced Real's sanction in December allowing the European champions to recruit new players as of this summer. While Atletico and Real were prevented from making any signings in the January transfer window, Atletico president Enrique Cerezo is hopeful sport's highest court will grant his club a similar ruling and halve their initial two-window ban. ""We hope they lift (the ban) and we can sign this summer,"" Cerezo said in February. ""We had the same problem as Real Madrid. If they have lifted it from them, why wouldn't they lift it from us?"""
283,28/05/2017,15:20,Costa will only leave Chelsea for Atletico,"Diego Costa claims he will only leave Chelsea to return to Atletico Madrid this summer, turning his back on long-term speculation of a blockbuster move to China.","Costa scored 22 goals this season in firing Chelsea to the Premier League title for the second time in three seasons at the club. Yet, the Brazilian-born striker has struggled to settle in London and had a training ground bust-up with Chelsea boss Antonio Conte in January fuelling rumours he could be the latest star of European football to be snapped up by China's football boom. However, after losing out to Arsenal in Saturday's FA Cup final, Costa said only a return to Atletico, where he won La Liga in 2013/14, would tempt him away from Stamford Bridge. ""If the club really want to sell me and there is an offer from a different club, I will stay,"" he said. ""If the offer is from Atletico, I will think about it that much is clear. ""I am going to choose my future, not them. I won't change city or country for another that isn't Spain. ""If the club want to sell me, there is only one team and I have made that very clear."" Costa nearly rejoined Atletico last year, but the Spanish side failed to meet Chelsea's valuation. Atletico, who finished third in La Liga this season, are currently banned from registering new players in the upcoming transfer window due to irregularities in the singing of players under the age of foreign minors. However, the Court of Arbitration for Sport is set to decide on their appeal to reduce the sentence from a two transfer window ban to one this week, which would free up Diego Simeone's men to strengthen. Atletico could be in the market for a striker with top scorer Antoine Griezmann heavily linked with a move to Manchester United. Griezmann has a 100 million euro ($112 million) buyout clause, but told French TV last week there was ""six out of 10 chance"" he could join Jose Mourinho's newly crowned Europa League winners."
284,23/05/2017,20:43,Koke to stay at Atletico until 2024,"Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke has extended his contract by five years in a deal that will keep him in the Spanish capital until 2024, the La Liga club announced Tuesday.","The 25-year-old, capped 32 times by Spain, has spent his whole career at Atletico after coming through their youth system. ""Atleti is the club of my life and it's an honour to be part of its future,"" said Koke. Sporting director Jose Luis Perez Caminero added: ""It's fantastic news for all the Atleticos. Koke personifies what it is to be an Atletico. ""He is a very supportive player with the group, who works tirelessly, has the highest quality and an enormous desire for self-improvement. He is one of this team's leaders and has grown up since very young with the values of our Academy, so knowing that he will continue with us for many more years is the best of news."""
285,22/05/2017,22:27,Griezmann says six out of 10 chances of United move,French international striker Antoine Griezmann said Monday he had a six out of 10 chance of moving to Manchester United from Atletico Madrid.,"After saying a transfer to the English Premier League was ""possible"", 26-year-old Griezmann was asked to rate the possibility out of 10. ""Six,"" he said without hesitation on French television channel TMC. Atletico are likely to be powerless over top-scorer Griezmann's ability to leave with a number of clubs willing to meet his 100 million euro ($109 million) buyout clause. Griezmann joined this season's losing Champions League semi-finalists Atletico in 2014 for 30million euros after five seasons at Real Sociedad. Manchester United are not for the moment guaranteed Champions League football next season, Jose Mourinho's team aiming for victory over Ajax in Wednesday's Europa League final for a spot after finishing sixth in the Premier League."
286,21/05/2017,20:18,Simeone staying put at Atletico,Diego Simeone stressed on Sunday he will remain as Atletico Madrid coach next season after the Spanish giants waved goodbye to their Vicente Calderon stadium with a 3-1 win over Athletic Bilbao.,"Simeone has transformed Atletico's fortunes over the past five-and-a-half years and promised to stay to see the club move into their new 67,000 Wanda Metropolitano home next season. ""The journalists ask me constantly if I am going to stay. Yes, I am going to stay,"" Simeone told an adoring crowd as Atletico honoured legends past and present in a ceremony after their final competitive match at the Calderon. ""And do you know why I am going to stay? I am going to stay because this club has a future and this future is all of us."" Atletico finished third in La Liga for a third straight season since breaking Real Madrid and Barcelona's hegemony by winning the title in 2013/14. Simeone's men also fell to Barca and Madrid in the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey and Champions League respectively. However, the Argentine, who also had two spells as a player for Atletico, said his ties to the club go beyond winning titles. ""There are other teams that may have more money, a few trophies more than us, but they will never match the feeling you (the fans) have for Atletico."""
287,11/05/2017,11:15,What next for Atletico Madrid?,"Despite a brave performance and a 2-1 second leg victory, Atletico Madrid's attempt to overturn a 3-0 first leg deficit from their Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid fell short.","It is the fourth straight season Atletico have been knocked out of the competition by their local rivals. Here, AFP sports looks at five key issues facing Atletico if they are to compete once more for their first ever Champions League next season. Wednesday's win was inspired by a phenomenal atmosphere for Atletico's last ever European game at the Vicente Calderon. After 50 years Atletico will swap their home by Madrid's Manzanares river just south of the city centre for the new 67,000 capacity out of town stadium to the city's north. Doubts remain over whether the Wanda Metropolitano will be ready in time for the start of next season. However, even when the bricks and mortar are in place, replacing the emotional tide with which the Calderon has carried Atletico to 18 wins in 22 Champions League games over the past four years is a different challenge. ""The same people will be in the Metropolitano,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""Their emotion and excitement is non-negotiable. It will be their new home."" A smiling Simeone looked ahead to an ""encouraging"" future. ""That final step is still a big one and we need to keep improving,"" he added. However, one factor that threatens to halt Atletico's progress is a ban preventing them from signing new players until January. The result of the club's appeal to reduce the ban to one already served transfer window will be known before the end of the season and will have a huge bearing on Atletico's ability to make the improvements needed to compete next season. Simeone himself has been the key figure in Atletico's emergence from a sleeping giant to European power over the past five-and-a-half years. One of his former clubs Inter Milan, who sacked Stefano Pioli on Tuesday, look set to launch a new offensive for the Argentine, who reduced the length of his contract from 2020 to 2018 earlier this season. Keeping Simeone this summer is an absolute must amidst the other upheaval surrounding Atletico. Retaining Simeone will also make it far easier to hold onto a host of rising young stars. Atletico are likely to be powerless over top-scorer Antoine Griezmann's ability to leave with a number of clubs willing to meet his 100 million euro ($109 million) buyout clause. However, the Frenchman has consistently recognised his loyalty to Simeone for turning him into one of the world's best players and only he will be able to convince Griezmann into staying for another season. Generally Atletico's age profile is promising with Jan Oblak (24), Jose Maria Gimenez (22), Lucas Hernandez (21), Saul Niguez (22), Koke (25) and Yannick Carrasco (23) all with the prime years of their career to come. The riches of the new stadium and a fifth straight year of Champions League football for the first time in their history also mean Atletico are now in a position where they don't need to sell. However, two of Atletico's most vital players, Diego Godin and Gabi, are 31 and 34 respectively. ""We have to clone some players,"" said Simeone. ""The hearts of some of the players we have are huge and they transmit so much passion to their teammates."" Atletico are well-stocked in Godin's position at centre-back thanks to Gimenez, Hernandez and Stefan Savic and the Uruguayan still has a few more years at the top left in him. A long-term replacement for Gabi, who came through the Atletico academy, is a tricker task not only for his ability, but his leadership and love of the club."
288,10/05/2017,22:57,Atletico comeback falls short as Real reach final,"Real Madrid inflicted a fourth Champions League elimination on Atletico Madrid in as many years on Wednesday, losing their semi-final second leg 2-1 but progressing to the final 4-2 on aggregate.","Atletico had threatened an incredible comeback, Saul Niguez's powerful header and Antoine Griezmann's penalty inside 16 minutes cutting Real's aggregate lead to a solitary goal. The hosts fed off a ferocious atmosphere for their final Champions League match at the Vicente Calderon before moving to the Wanda Metropolitano next season. However, Isco's away goal just before half-time settled Real's nerves and left Atletico with too much to do to progress. Cristiano Ronaldo's first leg hat-trick ultimately proved decisive and Real will seek to become the first side to defend the trophy in the Champions League era when they face Juventus in the final in Cardiff on May 3. An already fierce rivalry between the Spanish giants has intensified in recent years by Real's three Champions League victories over Atletico, including in the 2014 and 2016 finals. Real fans had unfurled a huge banner that read ""tell me how does it feel"" ahead of the first leg. The home fans responded with their own ""proud to not be like you"" banner as a dig back ahead of kick-off in the return. And Atletico's players went a long way towards making amends for their meek display in the first leg eight days ago in a thrilling opening. Real goalkeeper Keylor Navas denied Koke from close range and Fernando Torres headed over, before at the other end Jan Oblak made a brilliant save from Casemiro's header. Atletico got the goal they needed to get back into the tie 12 minutes in when Koke's outswinging corner was met powerfully by Saul for his fourth Champions League goal of the season. Just three minutes later Atletico truly believed they could pull off the most unlikely of comebacks when Fernando Torres was upended by Raphael Varane inside the box. Griezmann had missed his previous two penalties against Real, including in last year's Champions League final. This time the French international found the net, albeit with a bit of fortune as Navas got a hand to his mishit spot-kick but couldn't keep it out. Fierce challenges then rained in from both sides as Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir struggled to keep control, with five players booked inside the opening 37 minutes. However, Real regained their composure to get the vital away goal they needed for some extra breathing space just before half-time. Karim Benzema somehow escaped the attention of three Atletico defenders on the by-line and cut the ball back for Toni Kroos. Oblak made another brilliant stop to deny the German, but Isco followed up from close range to bundle the ball home. Ronaldo had scored eight times in his previous three Champions League appearances, however, the closest the World Player of the Year came to adding to his record 21 goals against Atletico was a driven free-kick at the start of the second half that was beaten away by Oblak. Atletico had their chances to put the tie back on a knife-edge as Navas produced an incredible double save from Yannick Carrasco and Kevin Gameiro. The Costa Rican then got down low to his right to turn behind Griezmann's low volley and Gameiro failed to turn home another great opportunity from point-blank range. A torrential thunder storm disrupted the final stages, but lightning has now struck four times for Atletico against Real and Zinedine Zidane's side will head to Cardiff seeking a 12th European Cup."

The altercations happened as several buses carrying Real Madrid fans arrived at Atletico's ground, with home supporters greeting them by throwing bottles and other objects. Police were forced to form a barrier between the rival fans, keeping them apart to prevent further trouble. None of those injured required hospital treatment and police reported no arrests. Reigning European champions Real came into the game leading 3-0 after last week's first leg."
290,10/05/2017,17:43,Atletico's Godin slapped with three-game ban,Atletico Madrid centre-back Diego Godin's season could be over after Wednesday's Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid after he was hit with a three-game La Liga ban.,Godin was shown two yellow cards in two minutes during the final stages of Atletico's 1-0 win over Eibar on Saturday for taking his protests towards the officials too far. The Spanish football federation's competition committee handed the Uruguayan international a two-game ban on Wednesday on top of the automatic one-match suspension for a red card. Godin will miss Atletico's final two La Liga games of the season against Real Betis and Athletic Bilbao and their first league game of next season. Atletico need a remarkable fightback to reach a third Champions League final in four years as Real hold a commanding 3-0 first-leg lead.
291,09/05/2017,15:14,'We're not from Beverly Hills' - Ramos warns Atletico,Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos insists the European champions will not be cowered by an intimidating atmosphere as they visit Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon for the final time on Wednesday.,"Los Blancos are looking to seal their place in the Champions League final once more and enjoy a commanding 3-0 first leg lead. And Ramos hit back at the simplification of the rivalry between the two Madrid giants as Real's riches against Atletico's hard work. ""It seems like here we have grown up in Beverly Hills,"" said Ramos on Tuesday. ""Here there are people from humble backgrounds too. ""The sacrifice is what fills you with desire to win."" An already intense rivalry has reached new levels in recent seasons as under Diego Simeone Atletico's status and ability to challenge Real has grown. However, Atletico have consistently fallen short against Real in the Champions League. Unless they pull off a remarkable comeback, Simeone's men will bow out of European competition against their fiercest rivals for the fourth consecutive season. ""If I needed to motivate the players for a game like tomorrow I would need to leave the club,"" said Simeone. ""Tomorrow we face a very tough opponent that beat us 3-0 at their home, that beat us 3-0 in the first half of the season in the league and in two finales, one on penalties and the other equalising in the 93rd minute. ""It is clear it is a great challenge."" However, the size of Atletico's task is illustrated by the fact that Real have scored in all of their last 60 games stretching back over a year. ""We have to defend well tomorrow. That will allow us to be in the game as long as possible,"" insisted Simeone on the threat of a Real away goal that would force Atletico to score five. ""I know what we are capable of. I know these players, I've known them for five-and-a-half years and I have no doubt they are going to play well."" Even by their standards, Real are on the verge of completing the most glorious season in the club's decorated history. Should Zinedine Zidane's men complete a La Liga and Champions League double, it will be Real's first since 1957/58. Moreover, they could become the first side in the Champions League era to retain the trophy. And Ramos insisted he is relishing a challenging end to the campaign rather than wilting under the pressure. ""There is no feeling of vertigo. The contrary, it is in our own hands,"" added the Spanish international. ""The good part of the season is coming, there are two weeks left and we'll see what happens in the end. ""I would settle to be in this position every year."" After 50 years at the Calderon, Atletico move to the new 67,000 capacity Wanda Metropolitano next season. And Atletico captain Gabi admitted giving their historic home a memorable send-off adds even extra spice to Wednesday's clash. ""It is an even extra motive to think and feel the possibility of a comeback, even though we have an adverse result,"" he said. ""The other day at the Bernabeu after losing 3-0 all you heard were the Atletico fans. It gave me goosebumps. ""The fans shows us so much love and support, we have to show we can match their standards."" Zidane is expected to resort back to the side that started the first leg after making nine changes for Saturday's 4-0 win at Granada bar the introduction of Nacho for the injured Dani Carvajal at right-back. Gareth Bale remains sidelined with a calf injury. Atletico's injury crisis at right-back is expected to be resolved by the return of Juanfran after three weeks out. Otherwise, Simeone is also expected to name the same side that started the first leg."
292,09/05/2017,01:45,Simeone rabble-rouses beaten down Atletico to believe,"For all coach Diego Simeone has changed at Atletico Madrid, one thing remains the same -- an inferiority complex when faced with their richer, more successful cross-city rivals Real Madrid.","Atletico have a huge task to overturn a 3-0 semi-final first-leg deficit if they are to avoid elimination at the hands of Real in the Champions League for a fourth consecutive season in the last ever European game at Atletico's Vicente Calderon stadium on Wednesday. Simeone has been in charge for what he described this weekend as ""nearly six marvellous years."" In that time he has led Atletico to their first league title in 18 years, ended a 14-year winless streak against Real and put the club back on the map in Europe. But the defeats in the past three seasons have been all the more heartbreaking as they have come by the slimmest of margins. Real equalised in the 93rd minute of the 2014 final en route to winning their long-awaited 10th European Cup. Another late goal edged a quarter-final tie 1-0 in 2015 and last year it took a penalty shootout to separate the two when they met in the final again. For the first time last week's first leg truly showed the gulf that still exists between the sides in terms of resources. Real's financial muscle even threatens to break up this Atletico side. Theo Hernandez looks set to become the first player to cross the Madrid divide since 2000 this summer. A move for the 19-year-old is seen as Real's first step to breaking a gentleman's agreement not to poach Atletico's best players ahead of a bid to snatch their top scorer Antoine Griezmann in 2018. ""Tell me how does it feel,"" said a huge banner released from the Real fans before kick-off at the Bernabeu last Tuesday alongside signs for Lisbon and Milan, the two cities where Atletico lost to Real in the final in the past three years. And yet as the stadium emptied nearly two hours later, it was the Atletico fans, beaten but unbowed, who sang the club's anthem into the night. That scene was repeated as the Atletico fans stayed behind after Saturday's 1-0 win over Eibar, demanding the team return to the pitch from the dressing room to serenade them with chants of ""proud of our players."" That loyalty in the face of adversity is in contrast to the demands put upon Real's players. Even after scoring hat-tricks against Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals and Atletico last week, Real's all-time top goalscorer Cristiano Ronaldo said ""all he wanted"" from the home fans was not to be jeered. ""Know how to win, know how to lose, #theycannotunderstand"" Atletico posted pointedly on the club's Twitter feed on Sunday. ""Don't stop believing,"" has also been a consistent emblem of Simeone's time in charge of Atletico. And the Argentine has been relentlessly positive over the past week in the midst of Atletico's despair. ""We have to do something impossible and being Atletico Madrid we might be capable of it,"" he said immediately after the first leg. ""I am convinced of it,"" he repeated on Saturday. ""If I wasn't I wouldn't say it. If we are united and understand that it is a semi-final at home we have a chance."" Atletico's home record in the Champions League under Simeone does give some small cause for optimism. Los Rojiblancos have won 17 and drawn four of their 21 Champions League home games in the past four years, keeping 17 clean sheets. Of those results, though, only those gained against modest opponents like Austria Vienna, Olympiakos, Malmo and Astana would be enough for Atletico to go through. Most Atletico fans would settle just for finally beating Real on a famous last European night at the Calderon, even if it doesn't stop their bitterest rivals from making the final once more."
293,08/05/2017,14:30,French defender Hernandez poised for Real move - report,"Rampaging French full-back Theo Hernandez is poised to seal a move to Real Madrid from rivals Atletico for 24 million euros ($26 million), Spanish media said on Monday.","The 19-year-old left-sided defender, who has impressed on loan at Alaves this season, passed a medical at the European champions and the move is set to be announced at the end of the month, sports daily Marca said. Marca revealed Real's interest in the attacking defender four weeks ago and said they were prepared to trigger the release clause of 24 million euros for the French under-20 international. Hernandez comes from footballing stock: he is the son of former defender Jean-Francois, who was also at Atletico, and the brother of Lucas -- currently another defender at Atletico. Hernandez burst onto the scene this term with Alaves, who are 10th in Liga, and his performances saw him also linked with Barcelona."
294,06/05/2017,19:55,Simeone 'convinced' Atletico can pull off Real miracle,"Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone believes overturning a 3-0 Champions League semi-final first-leg deficit against Real Madrid would be ""impossible"" for others, but not for his side.","Simeone's men must pull off a remarkable comeback in Wednesday's second leg to avoid being dumped out of the Champions League for a fourth straight season by their cross-city rivals. ""On Wednesday we have a very difficult game. For some impossible, but not for us,"" said Simeone after Atletico secured a top-four finish in La Liga for a fifth straight season with a 1-0 win over Eibar on Saturday. ""I've told the players it is very difficult, that we are facing the best team in the world, who score goals in every game, but that it is possible. ""I am convinced of it. If I wasn't I wouldn't say it. If we are united and understand that it is a semi-final at home we have a chance."" Wednesday's clash is likely to be the final European game at Atletico's Vicente Calderon as they move to the new 67,000-capacity Wanda Metropolitano next season. Atletico were given a rousing reception throughout at the Calderon on Saturday despite the disappointment of their 3-0 first-leg capitulation to Real in midweek. And Saul Niguez's winner 21 minutes from time ensured they now need just one more point from their final two games to guarantee third place in La Liga ahead of Sevilla and avoid a Champions League qualifier in August. ""They have been nearly six marvellous years. The fans are grateful and the players continue to give their all, to fight and raise themselves after they've been knocked down,"" added Simeone, who took over as coach in 2011. ""We had big difficulties at the start of the season and situations that meant we lost our consistency that this team has always had. ""With two games to go we are in a strong position and we hope to be able to finish it off in the next game."""
295,03/05/2017,00:44,"""Unique"" Ronaldo leaves Atletico needing a miracle","Cristiano Ronaldo's sensational goalscoring record was hailed as ""unique"" by boss Zinedine Zidane as his latest hat-trick left Real Madrid on the verge of another Champions League final by thrashing Atletico Madrid 3-0.","Ronaldo's treble was his second against Atletico this season and second straight in the Champions League after hitting three past Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals. ""Goalscoring is something he has over others, that is what makes him unique,"" said Zidane. Victory extended Real's hex over Atletico in the Champions League over the past four seasons. Real have eliminated Diego Simeone's men in each of the past three years, including in the 2014 and 2016 finals, by the finest of margins. However, there was a gulf between the sides this time round as Ronaldo's 10th minute header opened the scoring. And they struck twice more in the final 20 minutes to give the scoreline the reflection Real's dominance deserved. ""The team was tremendous. I scored the goals but the team was phenomenal from start to finish,"" said Ronaldo. Victory also kept Real on course to become the first side to retain the Champions League in 27 years. ""We played great, it is not easy to score three goals (against Atletico),"" added Zidane. ""The first half hour was fantastic, we had a lot of chances to score the second, but we got it in the second-half. ""We are very happy with the performance. To score three goals and most importantly in a (two-legged) tie keep a clean sheet at home is very important."" Ronaldo is now just one goal behind Barcelona rival Lionel Messi as the Champions League's top scorer this season with 10. Seven of those have come in his last three games, though, as he struck five of Madrid's six in seeing off Bayern 6-3 on aggregate in the quarters. ""It's great to have a player like him,"" said Real midfielder Toni Kroos. ""You can play good in defence, control midfield but in the end you need a player who will score and he did. ""He always does. He scored five in the quarter-final and three today, so it's incredible for us."" There were contrasting emotions for Atletico boss Simeone. However, he refused to give up hope of a miraculous comeback on what will be the final European match at Atletico's Vicente Calderon next Wednesday (May 10) before they move to a new stadium next season. ""More than ever I am calm,"" said Simeone. ""We have to do something impossible and being Atletico Madrid we might be capable of it."" Barcelona pulled off the biggest comeback in Champions League history earlier this season by overcoming a 4-0 first leg deficit against Paris Saint-Germain.

296,02/05/2017,23:42,Ronaldo hat-trick leaves Real on verge of final,"Cristiano Ronaldo proved Atletico Madrid's Champions League destroyer once more with a hat-trick as Real Madrid took a commanding 3-0 semi-final, first leg lead on Tuesday.","Ronaldo extended his lead as the all-time top scorer in Madrid derby matches by taking his tally to 21 and put Real firmly on course to defend their title in the final in Cardiff on June 3. The Portuguese rewarded a bright Real start by heading home Casemiro's deflected cross after just 10 minutes. Ronaldo then smashed home from just inside the area and turned home Lucas Vazquez's cross in the final 20 minutes as Real continued their domination of Atletico having eliminated them in the Champions League for the past three seasons. ""The team was tremendous. I scored the goals but the team was phenomenal from start to finish,"" said Ronaldo. The sides meet again for the second leg on May 10. ""We have a good advantage but the tie isn't over yet,"" added Ronaldo. ""Atletico are a good side and it is not a coincidence they are in the semi-finals again. We have to be concentrated next Wednesday."" Atletico boss Diego Simeone, meanwhile, told his side to forget their latest derby demolition and hope for a miracle at the last European match at their Vicente Calderon stadium next week. ""We need to forget about this game,"" said the Argentine. ""It seems impossible, but it is football and football has these unexpected things that make it marvellous. ""Until the last drip of hope is gone, we will give it everything we have."" Real needed a stoppage time equaliser en route to beating Atletico in the 2014 final, scored a late winner in the quarter-finals a year later and edged last season's final between the two on a penalty shootout. However, there was far more a gulf between the sides this time round. Real piled on the pain in the opening stages for the 4,000 visiting away fans and could have killed the tie in the opening half hour. Atletico were handed a lucky escape on seven minutes when Jan Oblak parried Dani Carvajal's effort at the end of a careering run and the Slovenian recovered to also turn behind Karim Benzema's follow-up effort. There was no let off three minutes later, though, as Atletico failed to clear a corner and Casemiro's bouncing cross looped up for Ronaldo to power home a header. Oblak kept Atletico alive in the moments that followed with a brilliant save from Raphael Varane's header and more comfortable stop from Isco. However, at the other end, Keylor Navas rescued Real from conceding a vital away goal when he got a touch on the ball as Kevin Gameiro tried to round him when clean through on goal. The majority of the efforts continued to rain down on Oblak's goal as Luka Modric drilled a shot from the edge of the box inches wide. And Benzema then acrobatically turned a Ronaldo cross just over the bar. The only negative news of the night for Real was an injury to right-back Dani Carvajal just before half-time as he pulled up with a muscle problem that looks set to keep him out of the second leg. Clear-cut chances were far harder to come by after half-time as Atletico toiled to create, whilst Real sat on their lead waiting for the chance to counter-attack. However, once again in ties between these two, Real got the slice of luck to go with their extra quality. The ball rebounded up perfectly off the heels of Filipe Luis for Ronaldo to blast high past Oblak. And Ronaldo completed his second hat-trick against Atletico this season four minutes from time when Lucas Vazquez's cutback picked out the four-time World Player of the Year to slot home from close range."

300,01/05/2017,01:35,Real Madrid depth keeps rare double alive,Real Madrid welcome Atletico Madrid for the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday hoping to do something that has been beyond the reigning 11-time European champions for six decades.,"Alfredo Di Stefano -- not Cristiano Ronaldo -- was Madrid's star man the last time Los Blancos won La Liga and Europe's top club prize in the same season. The eight times Real have been crowned champions of Europe since they have always done so happy to sacrifice La Liga for the tournament they see as defining their role as the biggest and best club in the world. ""I won a Champions League with Madrid in a year in which we trained horribly,"" former Spanish international goalkeeper Santiago Canizares told radio station Cadena SER of the 1997/98 season. ""There was very little commitment, but it was like there was psychological doping when we played in the Champions League. Everyone performed."" Two years later he experienced the power of Madrid's commitment to the Champions League from the opposite side. ""Then I lost a final with Valencia against Madrid in another horrible season for them. ""They finished the league terribly, there were problems in the dressing room... and then they arrived in Paris and played us off the park."" Even this season the lure of becoming the first side to successfully defend the Champions League has edged out that of ending Barcelona's dominance of La Liga. That has been evidenced by coach Zinedine Zidane's line-ups for a string of recent Liga games sandwiched between big European ties. None of Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema, Luka Modric or Toni Kroos started any of Madrid's last three away games. In their absence the likes of Isco, Alvaro Morata and Marco Asensio have shone and Madrid won all three games, scoring 13 times in the process. Real have already played 53 games this season across five competitions and even two continents after travelling to Japan for the Club World Cup. Yet they remain on course for the most successful season in the club's storied recent history thanks to the depth of their resources. Which has thrown up a new dilemma: the performances of Madrid's youngsters have left question marks over whether a few star names deserve their place in the team for Tuesday's semi-final. Real smashed Deportivo la Coruna 6-2 on Wednesday with a team containing nine changes from the side that lost El Clasico to Barcelona days previously. Yet they laboured to beat Valencia 2-1 thanks to Marcelo's late strike when Zidane resorted to largely his preferred XI on Saturday. ""For me, it is harder to play against Madrid's B team than their A team,"" said Deportivo boss Pepe Mel. Bale's absence through injury means that one of Isco or Asensio are likely to finally start one of Real's biggest games of the season this week. However, even for Real Madrid, a squad of this size and talent may be a one-season luxury. Isco, Morata and James Rodriguez have all been heavily linked with moves away from the Bernabeu in the summer due to their lack of game time. At 21 and 22 respectively, Asensio and Mateo Kovacic have the time to be more patient, but they too will expect to graduate to first-team regulars -- or find somewhere else where they will be."

""Gimenez suffered a muscular injury in his left adductor,"" Atletico said in a statement. ""Our player will undergo further tests in the next few hours."" Atletico have been beaten by Real in the Champions League in the past three seasons, including in the final in 2014 and 2016. However, Diego Simeone's men will travel to the Santiago Bernabeu in fine form as a Kevin Gameiro double and goals from Saul Niguez, Thomas Partey and Fernando Torres sealed a 5-0 rout in the Canary Islands to move three points clear of Sevilla in third in La Liga."

Unlike league matches between the two where away allocations are restricted to a few hundred tickets, UEFA rules mean Atletico will have a large travelling support of around 4,000 at the 80,000 capacity Santiago Bernabeu. The number of security personnel will be even higher than Madrid's last European home game against Bayern Munich when riot police clashed with visiting fans at half-time. There were also violent clashes before Atletico's quarter-final home tie between police and Leicester City fans, eight of whom were handed suspended four-month jail sentences.

Atletico and city rivals Real Madrid were barred from registering new players for two transfer windows in January 2016 for irregularities in the signing of foreign players under 18. Both clubs saw initial appeals rejected by FIFA last September, although CAS reduced Real's sanction in December allowing the European champions to recruit new players as of this summer. While Atletico and Real were prevented from making any signings in the January transfer window, Atletico president Enrique Cerezo is hopeful sport's highest court will grant his club a similar ruling and halve their initial two-window ban. ""We hope they lift (the ban) and we can sign this summer,"" Cerezo said in February. ""We had the same problem as Real Madrid. If they have lifted it from them, why wouldn't they lift it from us?"""

Real will host Atletico at the Santiago Bernabeu on May 2 and Monaco are home to Italian champions Juventus on May 3, with the second legs the following week. Going into the draw at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland all four teams were making the usual noises: there is nothing to choose between any of them, they said publicly. But the 39-year-old Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon broke ranks, saying that he would prefer to avoid a wily Atletico side because they are out of the La Liga title race so can rest players for Europe. ""The only distinction from the three teams is that Atletico Madrid have a more marked and defined position in the (league) standings,"" said the stopper, who is yet to win the Champions League, calling Diego Simeone's team ""the trickiest"" of the sides left.

""Over the two legs they were better than us so they deserve to go through to the semi-finals. I think they can win the Champions League this season,"" the Spanish international said after Buffon shut out Lionel Messi and Barcelona over 180 minutes of football. French league leaders Monaco are the outsiders but they have already claimed victims in Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-finals and Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur before that. The French side -- Buffon labelled them ""feisty"" -- are full of attacking vim and have hit a staggering 141 goals in all competitions this season. And in teenage striking sensation Kylian Mbappe, 18, allied with a rejuvenated Radamel Falcao, they have the firepower to trouble any defence. The final is in Cardiff on June 3."

On the eve of Friday's semi-final draw at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland at 1000 GMT, all four teams were making the usual noises: there is nothing to choose between any of them, they say publicly. But neutrals would probably prefer not to see a rerun of the 2014 and 2016 finals, when Real beat Atletico both times, in 2014 in extra time and last year on penalties in a tight and unremarkable affair that was quickly forgotten. The 39-year-old Buffon said that Atletico, who would dearly love revenge over Real in the final in Cardiff, might have an edge over the other three teams because they are out of the La Liga title race so can rest players for Europe. ""The only distinction from the three teams is that Atletico Madrid have a more marked and defined position in the (league) standings,"" the stopper said.

Italian media are confident that the perennial Serie A winners can deliver Buffon Champions League glory at last. Gazzetta dello Sport cited strong evidence in Juve's almost ""impenetrable defence"" and Gazzetta columnist Alessandro De Calo wrote of the prospect of domestic and European domination for the Turin club: ""Henceforth, there's no doubt: there's a smell of the treble in the air."" Beaten Barcelona defender Gerard Pique concurred, tipping Juventus to lift the trophy they last won in 1996.

306,19/04/2017,01:35,Shakespeare savours Leicester's taste of big time,Leicester City manager Craig Shakespeare said his side's remarkable run to the Champions League quarter-finals left his players determined to return to Europe's top table as soon as possible.,"Appearing in the tournament for the first time Leicester cruised through the group phase and sank Europa League champions Sevilla in the last 16 before falling to Atletico Madrid in the quarter-finals. With Leicester 12th in the Premier League it may be some time before they rub shoulders with Europe's elite again, but Shakespeare said that would now be the objective. ""I hope the benefit is they want some more of it,"" he told reporters at the King Power Stadium after Tuesday's 1-1 draw with Atletico resulted in a 2-1 aggregate defeat. ""They're very disappointed, but they can be proud of what they've achieved and we can be proud of how we've conducted ourselves. They should want more of this. ""All players want to play at the highest level and the Champions League is the highest level. We have to get back to winning ways in the Premier League now."" Shakespeare, 53, has had a stunning impact since succeeding the sacked Claudio Ranieri, steering Leicester clear of the relegation zone and masterminding a 2-0 second-leg win over Sevilla. He is only under contract until the end of the season and said he was looking forward to sitting down with the club's Thai owners, the King Power travel retail group, to discuss his future. ""It's not in my hands. It's in the club's hands,"" he said. ""We'll sit down at the end of the season. I'm more than happy to sit down before that if it arises. The contract says until the end of the season. ""I've enjoyed it. I've enjoyed the Champions League. You're pitting your wits against one of the best managers and one of the best sides in the world. It's been a really, really good experience."" Atletico went 2-0 up on aggregate when Saul Niguez headed in Filipe Luis's cross mid-way through the first half, but a half-time switch by Shakespeare threatened to provide a route back into the tie for Leicester. With Marc Albrighton and half-time substitute Ben Chilwell deployed as wing-backs, Leicester pinned Atletico back and drew level on the night when Jamie Vardy slammed in from close range. Atletico had to weather heavy pressure to see the game out and victorious coach Diego Simeone was generous in his praise of his side's opponents. Shakespeare's tactical change was ""fantastic"", he said, and it had been ""almost a pleasure to compete"" against Leicester. ""They never gave up. They never let their heads drop,"" he said. ""We were living in fear all night. They pushed us all the way."" Atletico have reached the semi-finals of the Champions League for the third time in four years, having fallen to city rivals Real Madrid in the 2014 and 2016 finals. But Simeone said it was inaccurate to talk about his side as one of the great teams of Europe. ""When you talk about the greats of Europe, you have to put a financial slant on things,"" he said. ""The greats are Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Barca. But from a purely footballing point of view, we can compete. We are competitive. ""Before you try to make headlines, we're not one of the greats only in that sense. But we are a team that competes."" Atletico were joined in the last four by Real, who beat Bayern Munich 4-2 for a 6-3 aggregate victory. Atletico came within minutes of beating Real in the 2014 final, only to lose 4-1 after extra time, and went down on penalties in the 2016 decider. They also lost the 1974 final against Bayern after a replay. Asked what it will take for Atletico to finally win the tournament, Simeone replied: ""We're just going to keep trying and trying and trying and trying."""
307,18/04/2017,23:26,Vardy in vain as Atletico end Leicester fairytale,Jamie Vardy scored in vain as Leicester City's Champions League fairytale came to a valiant end following a 1-1 quarter-final draw at home to Atletico Madrid on Tuesday.,"Seeking to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit, Leicester fell further behind to Saul Niguez's first-half header, before Vardy's 61st-minute strike gave them hope. But despite heavy Leicester pressure and furious noise inside the King Power Stadium, Atletico completed a 2-1 aggregate win to reach the semi-finals for the third time in four seasons. ""We had them rattled with the effort and commitment we showed. It's no discredit to lose to a team of that calibre,"" Leicester manager Craig Shakespeare told BT Sport. ""The whole club, from the supporters to the players to the owners can be immensely proud, but I've just said to the players that they should want more of this and they've agreed that that's what they want."" Leicester had hoped to become the competition's first debutant semi-finalists since Villarreal in 2006, but they were unable to engineer a repeat of their last-16 triumph against Sevilla. Their exit brings to an end a golden adventure sparked by last season's stunning Premier League title win. Having successfully staved off the threat of relegation under new manager Shakespeare, the rest of their season now holds nothing more than a return to pre-title normality. It is the third time Atletico have eliminated Leicester from continental competition, after previous triumphs in the 1961-62 European Cup Winners' Cup and the 1997-98 UEFA Cup. Beaten by city foes Real Madrid in the 2014 and 2016 finals, Diego Simeone's side can continue to dream that this will be the year they finally end their wait for European football's biggest prize. ""I'm full of emotion and pride at the performance of my team,"" said Simeone. ""I also have to say, what a great performance from our opponents. It was almost a pleasure to compete against them."" Leicester's desire to make the most of the occasion was clear from the start, pyrotechnics greeting the players as they came out while fans twirled blue, white and gold foil flags distributed by the club. But whereas Leicester had quickly taken charge of their second-leg match against Sevilla in the previous round, Atletico made it clear they would not be pushed around. They defended with their customary tenacity, while two dangerous crosses from Yannick Carrasco -- preferred up front to the fit-again Kevin Gameiro -- demonstrated their threat on the counter. It was just as Leicester were threatening to make inroads, Shinji Okazaki stabbing wide at the near post from Vardy's cross, that the visitors tightened their grip on the tie. Filipe Luis was given space to shape a cross into the box from the left and the unmarked Saul expertly guided a header past Kasper Schmeichel's outstretched right hand. Riyad Mahrez volleyed straight at Jan Oblak at the other end after Marc Albrighton's cross was headed away, but it was the voices of the away fans that rang loudest as the half-time whistle sounded. The second half brought with it drastic changes for the hosts, with Ben Chilwell and Leonardo Ulloa replacing Yohan Benalouane and Okazaki as Shakespeare switched to a bold 3-4-3 system. Antoine Griezmann gave them a scare with an early dart into the box, but Atletico soon found themselves on the back foot. After left wing-back Chilwell thrashed over, Leicester levelled, Vardy slamming in from inside the six-yard box after Chilwell's shot had been charged down by Stefan Savic. The final half-hour was virtually one-way traffic, but Atletico repelled everything Leicester threw at them. Ulloa and Vardy both had shots blocked, while Vardy's flick was caught by Oblak and Mahrez whipped a free-kick narrowly over the bar. Leicester captain Wes Morgan, passed fit to play after six games out with a back problem, succumbed to injury late on, symbolically hobbling off as Leicester's European dream faded away."
308,18/04/2017,23:04,"We gave it our all, says Leicester's Vardy",Jamie Vardy said Leicester City would depart the Champions League with their heads held high after falling to Atletico Madrid in the quarter-finals following a 1-1 second-leg draw on Tuesday.,"Vardy's 61st-minute strike gave Leicester hope, but Saul Niguez's first-half opener, allied to Antoine Griezmann's first-leg penalty, took Atletico through with a 2-1 aggregate win. ""We absolutely gave it our all, especially in the second half. They made a lot of blocks on the line,"" Vardy told BT Sport at the King Power Stadium. ""We were in the ascendancy. We made a tactical change with Leo (Ulloa) on to give an aerial threat. Unfortunately it wasn't to be. But we gave it our all and left it all out on the pitch. ""On another day, some could have gone in. But we can be proud. From the display you've seen, it was a fantastic effort."" Leicester were making their first appearance in the Champions League following last season's 5,000-1 title triumph in the Premier League."
309,17/04/2017,20:16,Godin not fazed by Atletico's penalty pain,"Diego Godin is not worried about Atletico Madrid's abysmal recent record with penalties, he said on Monday ahead of his side's Champions League quarter-final second leg at Leicester City.","Antoine Griezmann scored from the spot to give Atletico a 1-0 win in last week's first leg, but he had squandered his previous four penalties taken during play. With Yannick Carrasco and Thomas Partey both fluffing their lines from 12 yards in Saturday's 3-0 win over Osasuna, Atletico have now failed to score their last six penalties in La Liga. But centre-back Godin told Monday's pre-game press conference: ""It's an individual process. It's one v one, you against the goalkeeper. These things can happen in football. You can score or you can miss. ""We've spoken about it with the manager and as a group. But it's totally unrelated to the 90 minutes of the game. It's a one-off and sometimes these things happen."" Atletico lost on penalties to Real Madrid in the 2016 final and coach Diego Simeone has expressed misgivings about their record on spot-kicks. ""It is hard to explain,"" he said. ""It is down to the individual every time, but it is certainly not just bad luck."" Tuesday's game at the King Power Stadium can only go to penalties if the score is 1-0 to Leicester at the end of extra time."
310,17/04/2017,16:15,Football: Fuchs in awe of Atletico's 'amazing' Griezmann,"Leicester City's Christian Fuchs professed his admiration of Antoine Griezmann on Monday, but says last week's encounter with the Atletico Madrid hotshot helped his side get the measure of him.","Griezmann scored the only goal -- a disputed penalty following a foul outside the box -- as Atletico won 1-0 in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final. But Leicester managed to keep the France striker at bay for the rest of the game and Fuchs is hopeful he and his fellow defenders will not be given the runaround in Tuesday's return leg. ""His movement on the pitch is amazing,"" Fuchs told reporters at the King Power Stadium. ""He's always finding the pockets, always between the lines, and it's hard as defenders because you don't know whether you should push up or stay back. ""In the second half we adjusted well to that and it's something we definitely learnt from."" With a 1-0 lead and the experience of playing in two Champions League finals in the last four years behind them, Diego Simeone's Atletico are strong favourites. But Leicester overcame a one-goal deficit to eliminate Sevilla in the last 16 and Fuchs believes the atmosphere at the King Power could prove a decisive factor. ""We have a great atmosphere here and the stadium will be burning tomorrow,"" said the Austrian left-back. ""Our fans have proven in the last couple of games that they're our 12th man. They can carry us to wins. They carried us to the success against Sevilla. ""When I saw the stadium before, I knew that something special would happen again. I'm fired up and I'm looking forward to it."" Fuchs is mindful that given the improbability of last season's title triumph, Tuesday's game could be the club's last chance of reaching the Champions League semi-finals for some time. ""We're here for the first time in the club's history,"" he said. ""It's something very special to us. Small Leicester City playing in the Champions League is already great and being in the quarter-finals is outstanding. ""We just enjoy the time that we have. We might never be here again, we might be at some point again. ""But right now it's simply this one game that we have and we try to give everything to be successful."""
311,17/04/2017,01:40,Date with destiny awaits reanimated Vardy,"When Jamie Vardy pictured himself making history in the Champions League, the record he set in Leicester City's loss to Atletico Madrid was probably not what he had in mind.","The England striker came off during last week's quarter-final first leg at the Vicente Calderon having completed none of his two attempted passes, in what is thought to have been a Champions League first. Leicester's 1-0 defeat left Atletico in charge of the tie ahead of Tuesday's return leg, but with Vardy now back among the goals, his team-mates hope more memorable milestones are ahead. ""Strikers go through it. I don't know why some people panic, because he is not going to score every game,"" said Leicester right-back Danny Simpson of Vardy's early-season struggles. ""He is still the same player, it had just not been happening. But in training nothing changes with him, his attitude and his confidence. He still believes in himself."" Having scored 24 goals last season in Leicester's 5,000-1 Premier League title win, Vardy found the net only five times in the first 22 games of the current campaign as his side slithered down the table. But since Claudio Ranieri's dismissal as manager, he has been a man reborn, taking his tally to six goals in seven league games with a sharply taken effort in Saturday's 2-2 draw at Crystal Palace. While Vardy's goals have helped Leicester move clear of danger, the team's return to form under new manager Craig Shakespeare has not been to everyone's liking. Leicester's players have been accused of betraying the man who oversaw last season's fairytale, with Vardy cast as chief conspirator. ""The story is out there, then people pick it up and jump on it and you're getting death threats about your family, kids, everything,"" he said recently. ""I try to get on with it, but when people are trying to cut your missus up while she's driving along with the kids in the back of the car, it's not the best. ""It's happened plenty of times. It is terrifying."" Vardy says he now gets ""abuse at every stadium"", although he admits that he feeds on the notoriety. ""Do I enjoy it? Yeah, it's just me,"" he says. ""I wouldn't change it."" The return of the angry Vardy has been a central component of Leicester's renaissance under Shakespeare, as witnessed in their last 16 second-leg victory over Sevilla. Vardy's aggressive pressing set the tone for Leicester's 2-0 win and he succeeded in getting Samir Nasri sent off for aiming a headbutt at him, an incident that left the Frenchman branding him a ""a cheat"". Vardy had sown the seeds of success in the first leg, snaffling an away goal that meant Leicester returned to England with a 2-1 deficit their performance barely merited. Ranieri was sacked the day after. It was, however, the only goal Vardy has scored in the Champions League this season. At the age of 30 and with Leicester not expected to qualify for the Champions League again in the foreseeable future, Tuesday's game may represent his last chance to leave a mark on the competition. Unsurprisingly, he has an admirer in Atletico coach Diego Simeone. ""I like him. I really rate him as a player,"" said the former Argentina bruiser. ""As a striker he is the kind of powerful striker Atletico have had. He stretches the game and is always fighting to stop the opponent playing out from the back so he can pounce on any mistake. ""Last season he was very consistent. At the start of the season he struggled a little bit, but he seems to be back on form."""
312,16/04/2017,15:02,Atletico's Gameiro fit for Leicester return,"French international Kevin Gameiro boosted Atletico Madrid's chances of reaching a third Champions League semi-final in four years as he was included in Diego Simeone's squad for Tuesday's quarter-final, second leg at Leicester City","Gameiro hasn't featured in Atletico's last five games, including their 1-0 first-leg win over the English champions, due to a groin injury. However, he and reserve goalkeeper Miguel Angel Moya have both been given the all clear to return to action, Atletico confirmed on Sunday. Simeone was afforded the luxury of resting a host of his first-team regulars for Saturday's routine 3-0 win over Osasuna. Top scorer Antoine Griezmann, captain Gabi, Koke, Saul Niguez and Stefan Savic are all expected to return at the King Power Stadium. Whether Gameiro is fit enough to start in place of Fernando Torres up front is the only doubt in the Atletico side with Simeone otherwise expected to name the same team that started the first leg."
313,13/04/2017,20:42,Eight Leicester fans handed four-month jail terms,Eight Leicester City supporters were handed four-month suspended prison terms on Thursday after fighting and violence marred their team's Champions League clash against Atletico Madrid.,"Madrid prosecutors said that the cases had been quickly dealt with as a result of the fans involved admitting the charges in exchange for a more lenient sentence. The Leicester fans were in the Spanish capital for Wednesday's quarter-final first leg which the home side won 1-0. Social media videos had shown a blue smoke bomb was let off while objects were also thrown at police in the Plaza Mayor, a popular tourist stopping off point, where supporters of the English champions had congregated. Spanish police said eight Leicester fans were arrested for ""causing a mess"" on Tuesday night. ""We are working with UEFA and the local authorities to establish the full facts of what took place and the reasons for the police response,"" a Leicester spokesman said on Thursday. ""We will also be liaising with travelling supporters before deciding on any course of action."" Fans claimed police used tear gas and rubber bullets against them as tensions boiled over in Spain and accused the authorities of being overzealous. Leicester's official fan allocation was around 2,800, but it is believed there were several thousand who travelled to Madrid without tickets. Some Leicester supporters managed to buy tickets in the home ends of the Vicente Calderon, while Atletico also had a neutral zone at the stadium. Three police officers and two English fans were injured in clashes. The eight who were charged appeared in a Madrid court after spending close to 40 hours in detention."
314,13/04/2017,01:29,"Simeone expects ""pure"" football test in Leicester return","Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone believes his side face a ""pure night"" of football when they take a 1-0 to Leicester City's King Power for the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final.","Antoine Griezmann's penalty was the only goal at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday as Atletico failed to make the most of their dominance as Leicester failed to have a single shot on goal in 90 minutes. ""We anticipate a fantastic football night. An English stadium, the fans close to the pich, it will be a pure night of football,"" Simeone said of the return leg on April 18. Griezmann was by a distance the stand out performer as he also created the penalty as he was brought down right on the edge of the box after a storming run from inside his own half. The French international had missed his last four Atletico penalties, including in last season's Champions League final. However, he dusted himself down to slot home his 24th goal of the season. ""He is a fabulous player,"" added Simeone. ""He is a complete player, you don't know what position he plays because he is all over the pitch. ""He is still growing, he is playing very well at an important part of the season and has is assuming more responsiblity in the hierarchy of the team."" Leicester manager Craig Shakespeare claimed his side had been let down by Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson's decision to award the penalty when Griezmann was upended by Marc Albrighton. ""I think we were hard done by,"" said Shakespeare. ""I think it is one of the major decisions in the game. It is a definite foul but it is outside the box."" Leicester have now lost two consecutive games after winning their first six after Shakespeare replaced the sacked Claudio Ranieri, who led the Foxes to a remarkable Premier League triumph last season. However, he backed the English champions to turn around their narrow deficit having won all four of their home Champions League games this season without even conceding a goal. ""We're still alive, we want to stay (in the Champions League) but we know we still have a challenge ahead against a very, very good team,"" said Shakespeare. ""We know it is still going to be a very difficult return match. ""We have a very good home record at the King Power, our fans enjoy these Champions League nights. ""We have to create more chances, we have to attack probably a bit more than we did tonight, but we are aware of what we need to do in the second leg."" Shakespeare, though, did accept a more open game could play into Atletico's hands as they seek to reach a third semi-final in four seasons. ""It will be very difficult because we have to be more open and attack more,"" he added. ""One of Atletico's pluses is the counter-attack, but we are still in this tie."""
315,12/04/2017,22:37,Griezmann gives Atletico slender Leicester lead,Antoine Griezmann's penalty handed Atletico Madrid a slender 1-0 advantage over Leicester City in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday.,"In a game of very few chances, Griezmann proved decisive as it was he who also won the penalty with a lung-busting run from well inside his own half before being brought down by Marc Albrighton midway through the first half. The French international put his previous penalty demons behind him to convert from the spot and put Atletico in the driving seat for a third semi-final in four seasons. However, Leicester still have reason to believe their dream run on their first appearance in the Champions League can continue when the sides meet again on April 18. The behaviour of Leicester's travelling fans was in the spotlight after 10 were arrested in violent clashes with police on Tuesday night and Wednesday before kick-off. However, the 3,000 travelling supporters high in the rafters of the Calderon were largely silenced by Atletico's dominance of the match. Unusually for Diego Simeone's men they were in almost complete control of possession, but largely limited to shots from long range. Koke came closest from distance when he drilled an effort off the outside of the post after just five minutes. Yannick Carrasco then slashed wildly at a volley when well-placed at the back post. Griezmann and Saul Niguez were next to take aim from outside the box, but both failed to find the target with powerful drives that flew over Kasper Schmeichel's goal. Leicester had been enjoying their best spell of the half when suddenly they were caught short-handed at the back on 27 minutes. Griezmann collected the ball outside his own area and ran to just inside the Leicester box before being crudely barged over by Albrighton. Schmeichel had saved a penalty in each of Leicester's two legs against Sevilla in the last 16 and Griezmann had missed his last four for Atletico, including in last season's Champions League final. However, Griezmann sent the Dane the wrong way from the spot to register his 24th goal of the season. Both sides seemed content to settle the tie at the King Power in six days' time with Atletico holding a 1-0 advantage after the break. Atletico still had the better of what few chances there were. Fernando Torres slipped at the vital moment as he prepared to unleash a shot from the edge of the area. Leicester were without captain Wes Morgan due to a back injury and his return to health will be even more important for the second leg as Robert Huth will be suspended after being booked for chopping down Griezmann. Griezmann was the standout performer and nearly added an assist to the only goal but Angel Correa couldn't quite stretch to reach his dangerous low cross 17 minutes from time. Leicester boss Craig Shakespeare protected Jamie Vardy from the threat of picking up a yellow card that would also have seen him miss the return as he was replaced by Islam Slimani. But even with a different focal point to their attack, Leicester didn't threaten an away goal as Atletico held out for their 18th clean sheet in 22 home Champions League games since Simeone took charge."

""Eight hooligans were arrested for public disorder and vandalism,"" a police spokesperson told AFP. Videos showed riot police charging at the Leicester fans, who had gathered to drink in the various bars and restaurants in the Plaza Mayor, a spot often invaded by travelling fans for Champions League matches. ""There was a group of 70 hooligans when the police charged,"" said a spokesperson for the municipal emergency services. ""On the ground we attended five people, three police officers and two English ultras for cuts and bruises, but nobody was taken to hospital."" The police source said the intervention was caused by Leicester fans ""throwing bottles at the police."""

Neymar picked up the first red card of his Barcelona career for two bookable offences as the Catalans were left to rue letting Sandro Ramirez join Malaga for free last summer. Sandro exposed some awful defending from Jeremy Mathieu to sprint clear on goal and slot past Marc-Andre ter Stegen at his near post. Malaga also had the better chances of the second-half filled with controversy as Juanpi shot straight at Ter Stegen when clean through. Neymar had been shown his first booking for delaying a Malaga free-kick whilst tying his shoelaces and stupidly charged into Diego Llorente 25 minutes from time to see red. The hosts then had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside when substitute Adalberto Penaranda finished off a flowing counter-attack. However, Barca were also infuriated with referee Gil Manzano when he somehow awarded a free-kick on the edge of the box when Sergi Roberto had been brought down clearly inside the area. Malaga finally picked off the 10 men in the final minute when Pablo Fornals unselfishly squared for Jony to smash home from close range. Barca's defeat meant Real's disappointment earlier in the day was short lived. Pepe's towering header early in the second half looked to have Real heading five points clear at the top in the Madrid derby. However, Griezmann rounded Keylor Navas to slot home at the near post five minutes from time. ""It is a draw but we've lost two points. Clearly we deserved all three points today,"" said Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane. ""We played very well, but we lacked the second goal that would have allowed us to relax."" After a slow start, Real took control of the game as the first half wore on and only two stunning stops prevented Zidane's men from taking a half-time lead. Firstly, Jan Oblak tipped over Karim Benzema's effort after a neat one-two with Ronaldo had freed the Frenchman inside the box. Moments later Cristiano Ronaldo couldn't believe his eyes when his fierce goal-bound effort was turned to safety by Stefan Savic's incredible headed clearance from under his own crossbar. Real started the second half with intent as Ronaldo headed just wide before Oblak had to rush from his goal to block Benzema's volley from point-blank range. The European champions finally made the breakthrough seven minutes into the second period when Pepe rose highest in a crowded penalty area from Toni Kroos's free-kick to power a header into the far corner. However, Atletico responded to falling behind and should have been level on the hour mark when Yannick Carrasco played in Fernando Torres clear on goal. The former Spanish international failed to finish, though, as he fired straight at the onrushing Navas. Navas has faced a barrage of criticsm this season, but he made another smart stop to deny Griezmann levelling with an outrageous overhead kick attempt. The French international wasn't to be denied from an excellent through ball from Angel Correa with five minutes remaining, however, as he coolly fired past the advancing Navas at the near post for his 23rd goal of the season. ""We know we are a strong team with an incredible mentality,"" Griezmann told Spanish TV station Movistar. ""I could see my teammates had confidence, desire and the truth is we played a great game."""

However, Barcelona now have a third straight title back in their own hands after Griezmann rounded Keylor Navas to slot home at the near post. Real lead Barcelona by three points with eight games left, but the two face each other at the Bernabeu on April 23. Barca can move top later on Saturday with victory at Malaga. Atletico had won their three previous league visits to the Bernabeu and enjoyed the brighter start as Saul Niguez was inches away from opening the scoring inside five minutes when his header from Koke's cross flew just wide. Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick separated the sides in a 3-0 Real win earlier this season and the World Player of the Year was first to threaten for the hosts as his near post drive was beaten away by Jan Oblak. Griezmann hit the post at the other end but had already been flagged offside as Atletico maintained a threat on the counter-attack. However, Real took control of the game as the first half wore on and only two stunning stops prevented Zinedine Zidane's men from taking a half-time lead. Firstly, Oblak tipped over Karim Benzema's effort after a neat one-two with Ronaldo had freed the Frenchman inside the box. Moments later Ronaldo couldn't believe his eyes when his fierce goal-bound effort was turned to safety by Stefan Savic's incredible headed clearance from under his own crossbar. Griezmann was nearly gifted the opener just before half-time as he intercepted Sergio Ramos's wayward crossfield pass and bore down on goal. But Griezmann narrowed his own angle by verging left onto his favoured foot and his low effort was turned behind by Keylor Navas. Real started the second half with intent as Ronaldo headed just wide before Oblak had to rush from his goal to block Benzema's volley from point-blank range.

320,07/04/2017,16:47,Simeone leans on Griezmann for more derby glory,Diego Simeone believes Atletico Madrid need top scorer Antoine Griezmann in top form if they are to once again derail city rivals Real Madrid's La Liga title challenge on Saturday.,"Real hold a two-point lead over Barcelona at the top of La Liga and have a game in hand as they edge towards a first title in five years. However, Atletico have won a record three consecutive La Liga clashes between the sides at Real's Santiago Bernabeu. ""We need the best of Antoine,"" said Simeone on Friday. Griezmann scored the winner as Atletico won 1-0 at the Bernabeu last season as part of a spectacular 2016 for him on a personal level. He top scored at Euro 2016 and finished third behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in the Ballon d'Or. However, with success has come attractors and Griezmann is constantly having to distance himself from speculation over a move at the end of the season with Manchester United leading the chase for his signature. ""I always want the best for footballers who give their all like Antoine,"" added Simeone, who has committed himself to remaining in charge for Atletico's move to a new 67,000-capacity stadium next season. ""He has improved enormously because he wanted to and he has looked to improve."" Griezmann has scored 79 goals in 149 games for Atletico since joining from Real Sociedad for 30 million euros ($32 million) in 2014. And any move away from Madrid in the summer will almost certainly require the buying club to pay his 100 million-euro buyout clause. ""He wanted to integrate himself into this club, which is different from the one he came from. ""He has transformed from a boy into a man on the field and taken important decisions. ""He is on course to consistently be among the top players in the world."""

Koke has still been included in the Atletico squad for Saturday's Madrid derby against Real Madrid."
322,07/04/2017,05:59,Griezmann eyes Atletico assault on Real's title lead,Antoine Griezmann believes Atletico Madrid can inflict the worst possible start to a season defining two-weeks for Real Madrid as Atletico go for a record fourth straight La Liga win at the Santiago Bernabeu.,"Griezmann scored the winner last season as Atletico became the first side to ever win away to Real in the league for three consecutive seasons. ""I see us as favourites. I believe in my teammates and the coach,"" said a bullish Griezmann on Thursday. Despite their triple assault on the Bernabeu, Atletico have still had to play second fiddle to Real after losing to their city rivals in the Champions League for each of the past three seasons - twice in the final. Real were also the dominant force when the sides last met in November as Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick sealed a 3-0 win. Zinedine Zidane's men lead Barcelona at the top of the table by two points and have a game in hand on their title rivals with Atletico 10 points back in third. ""We have to win more for the fans than for the points,"" added Griezmann. ""Madrid played great and caused us a lot of damage. Now it is a different story. We know it is going to be difficult, but I believe in my teammates. We are more complete now."" Inflicting a damaging blow on Real's bid for the first league title in five years would be some measure of sweet revenge for Atletico. However, Real have yet to taste defeat at home in La Liga this season. That record will be put fully to the test over the next fortnight as Barcelona visit on March 23. In between times Madrid also face old foes Bayern Munich for a place in the Champions League semi-finals. Real captain Sergio Ramos has been Atletico's bete noire in recent times, scoring in both the Champions League finals between the sides. But he has called on Real to not rest on their laurels and go for more history by becoming the first side to retain the Champions League in 27 years and end Barca's stranglehold on La Liga. ""You can't constantly live with what you have won in the past. You have to have ambition and belief to win titles,"" he told Madrid's website. ""As of today we can win both the Champions League and La Liga."" Both sides are in great form having each won their last five La Liga outings. However, Zidane and Atletico boss Diego Simeone's plans could be affected by their upcoming Champions League ties with Bayern and Leicester City respectively. Zidane is expected to welcome back a host of first team regulars rested for Wednesday's 4-2 win over Leganes, including Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema. By contrast, Simeone is expected to name an unchanged side from the one that beat Real Sociedad 1-0 on Tuesday with Fernando Torres partnering Griezmann up front due to Kevin Gameiro's continued absence through injury. Any slip up from Real would allow Barcelona to move top when they travel to Malaga later on Saturday. Barca boss Luis Enrique is expected to rest some of his star names ahead of their Champions League quarter-final, first leg at Juventus on Tuesday, whilst Gerard Pique and Ivan Rakitic are suspended."

""Real Madrid have reached an agreement with Theo Hernandez... to pay his 24 million euro ($25.6 million) buyout clause and incorporate him from the summer for the next six seasons,"" Marca said in an exclusive report. The deal would break a gentleman's agreement between the clubs not to sign players from their rivals since Real president Florentino Perez began the first of his two spells in charge in 2000. Former Argentina winger Santiago Solari was the last player to cross the Madrid divide when he joined Real 17 years ago. Should Hernandez move, brothers could be facing off in the Madrid derby for years to come as his older sibling Lucas Hernandez, 21, has featured regularly for Atletico this season. Real and Atletico renew their rivalry at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday."
324,19/03/2017,20:58,"Atletico coming good, Simeone warns Leicester",Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone sent a warning shot to Champions League quarter-final opponents Leicester as he believes his side have hit top form for the most decisive part of the season.,"Simeone's men brushed aside Sevilla 3-1 on Sunday just five days after the latter were dumped out of the Champions League last 16 by Leicester. ""Since the start of 2017 we have been improving,"" said Simeone, who has led Atletico to four consecutive Champions League quarter-finals. ""We are defending better and possibly today was our most consistent performance on the ball."" Diego Godin headed the hosts in front at a buoyant Vicente Calderon before Antoine Griezmann produced a stunning free-kick to double Atletico's lead. Koke added Atletico's third and despite Joaquin Correa's consolation, Atletico close to within two points of Sevilla in third in La Liga. On top of their Champions League elimination, Sevilla have now failed to win in their last three La Liga games to fall out of contention for the title. ""It is normal when you don't achieve what you want, which is to win, there is frustration and bitterness,"" said Sevilla boss Jorge Sampaoli. ""We have come from a very hard blow to take and now we have to find solutions and the real Sevilla."" However, Simeone hinted that, given the plaudits that have come Sevilla's way this season, Atletico's consistency in challenging Real Madrid and Barcelona in domestic and European competition deserves more recognition. ""Sevilla have had a magnificent season and have been lauded by the press. That highlights even more how well Atletico played. ""That provides us with the calm we need to look forward confidently."""
325,16/03/2017,00:34,Joyful Simeone hails Atletico's latest European march,Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone lauded his side's determination to keep making their mark on the Champions League after they reached the quarter-finals for a fourth consecutive season.,"Simeone's men have lost out in the final to cross city rivals Real Madrid in two of the past three seasons. However, they have another chance at Champions League glory as a 0-0 draw with Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday sealed their place in Friday's draw 4-2 on aggregate. ""Firstly there is joy,"" said Simeone. ""It shows the great effort the club and, above all, the players have made in the way they have competed and given their heart and soul in the past four years. ""Everyone has done their bit to be amongst the top eight teams in Europe."" Atletico were far from their best at the Vicente Calderon as they relied on a stunning triple save from goalkeeper Jan Oblak to prevent just a second Champions League defeat in the past four seasons. However, the Spanish side got the job done in Germany three weeks ago thanks to goals from Saul Niguez, Antoine Griezmann, Kevin Gameiro and Fernando Torres. ""We didn't need to attack like crazy,"" said Atletico's top scorer Griezmann. ""We tried to see the game out at the back and that is what we did. We are in the quarter-finals and we are all happy."" Another European reunion with Real is one of seven possible opponents for Atletico in the last eight along with Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Monaco, Leicester City and Juventus. ""Now hopefully we can get a good draw and through to the semis,"" added Griezmann. ""We have to show every year we are among the best teams in Europe and every year we achieve it."" New Leverkusen boss Tayfun Korkut was taking charge of his first Champions League game and summoned a much-improved performance as they forced Atletico onto the back foot for long spells. However, Korkut hailed Atletico's desire to defend as Oblak's miraculous triple save to deny firstly Julian Brandt and then two follow-up efforts from Kevin Volland midway through the second-half secured Los Rojiblancos' 17th clean sheet in their last 20 home Champions League games. ""I haven't seen anything like it,"" said Korkut. ""I've watched it again and it isn't just him. There were many defenders throwing themselves to block the shot. ""You see how this team defends their goal. They are all there to put their foot or any part of their body on the line."" Korkut was hired after a 6-2 thrashing at Dortmund following their first leg defeat saw Roger Schmidt sacked. And with Leverkusen languishing in 10th in the Bundesliga, Korkut is hoping to gain momentum from their impressive showing to make a late run to qualify for Europe next season. ""We saw that we have the quality to cause them problems. Atletico suffered and we had a lot of chances,"" he added. ""For me the important thing is that the team has taken the first steps forward comparing with where we have come from in the Bundesliga."""
326,15/03/2017,22:47,Oblak stars in stalemate as Atletico progress,Atletico Madrid booked their place in the Champions League quarter-finals for a fourth consecutive season but had goalkeeper Jan Oblak to thank for avoiding defeat in a 0-0 draw with Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday.,"Oblak produced a remarkable triple save midway through the second half as Atletico held on to their 4-2 first-leg advantage to take their place in Friday's draw for the last eight. ""It is not easy to be in the quarter-finals four years in a row,"" Oblak told BeIN Sports Spain. ""I hope Atletico will continue like this, keep growing like in the last few years and I am sure we can achieve great things."" On a night of few Atletico chances, the home fans didn't even get to cheer the return of hero Fernando Torres. Two weeks on from being knocked unconscious in a sickening head clash Atletico boss Diego Simeone left Torres on the bench for the full 90 minutes. ""There is always a feeling of enthusiasm, passion, the Champions League is always special,"" said Simeone, who has led Atletico to the final in two of the past three seasons. ""Evidently, this is a very important step for the club."" New Leverkusen boss Tayfun Korkut was taking charge of his first Champions League game after Roger Schmidt was sacked when Leverkusen's first-leg defeat was followed by a 6-2 thrashing at Borussia Dortmund. Korkut summoned a much-improved performance from the Germans as they forced Atletico onto the back foot for long spells. However, the damage had already been done as the hosts registered their 17th clean sheet in their last 21 Champions League home games. ""I congratulate Atletico Madrid and especially their 'keeper Oblak for a wonderful performance,"" said Korkut. ""I haven't seen anything like (the triple save). I've watched it again and it isn't just him. There were many defenders throwing themselves to block the shot. ""You see how this team defends their goal."" Leverkusen had the chance to bring the tie back to life after just four minutes but Kevin Volland pulled his shot across Oblak and beyond the far post. Atletico took until seven minutes before the break to threaten but then forced Bernd Leno into two fine saves in 60 seconds. Firstly, Angel Correa was denied before Koke's low driven shot was turned behind by the German international. Only a poor cross from Volland denied Javier Hernandez what should have been a tap-in at the start of the second half after great work from Julian Brandt. At the other end, Atletico went close twice in quick succession once more as Correa danced inside two Leverkusen challenges before stabbing just wide. Antoine Griezmann was then inches away from his 22nd goal of the season with a measured chip over Leno that floated just wide. The highlight of the match came 21 minutes from time when Oblak pulled off an incredible triple save to end Leverkusen's hopes of a comeback. Brandt pounced on a slack pass from Jose Maria Gimenez and after he was denied one-on-one with Oblak, the Slovenian twice pulled himself off the ground to save Volland's follow-up efforts. Oblak's work for the night wasn't done as he still had to make saves from long-range efforts by Leon Bailey, Wendell and Kevin Kampl to prevent Atletico slumping to just a second Champions League home defeat under Simeone. But the hosts held on to extend Spanish clubs' winning run over German sides in European competition to 11 ties."
327,14/03/2017,16:05,Griezmann seeks end to nearly man tag,"Propelled by an on-fire Antoine Griezmann, Atletico Madrid stand on the brink of a fourth consecutive Champions League quarter-final, determined to finally end their tag as Europe's nearly men.","Griezmann has experienced that feeling more than most. In 2016 the Frenchman proved himself as one of world football's most deadly forwards, but also missed out in agonising fashion in the Champions League and Euro 2016 finals, as well as finishing third behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for the Ballon d'Or. Burdened by that disappointment and the physical and mental fatigue of carrying France to the final of Euro 2016 on home soil, Griezmann's form tailed off as he failed to score a league goal between October and January. However, the new year has seen Griezmann, and as a consequence Atletico's form, revitalised with the 25-year-old scoring 12 of his 21 goals this season in 2017. Once again under the tutelage of Diego 'Cholo' Simeone, Atletico are coming good at the right time of the campaign to launch another bid for a first ever Champions League title. Bayer Leverkusen will need to launch a comeback of Barcelona proportions when they visit the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday needing to overcome a 4-2 first-leg defeat at home three weeks ago. The esteem with which Griezmann holds Simeone was key to him remaining at the Calderon last summer and why he says he will stay when Atletico move into the new 67,000-capacity Wanda Metropolitano next season despite rumours Manchester United are willing to pay the 100 million euro ($107 million) release clause in his contract. ""Simeone is the one who has made me take the leap I needed. I was promising but in three years, Cholo has helped me take the leap to in 2016 be among the three best players in the world,"" Griezmann told Television Espanola this week. ""To take that leap, Simeone is the best coach I could possibly have had. ""The weather helps a lot, my teammates are amongst the best and I have a top coach, so I am very happy here and there is no reason to leave."" To put the scale of Simeone's achievements at Atletico into context, Los Rojiblancos had only reached five European Cup quarter-finals in their history before the Argentine took over in December 2011. However, getting so close to glory and falling at the final hurdle has been all the more painful for Atletico and Simeone, especially as they have lost to cross-city rivals Real Madrid for the past three seasons in the Champions League, twice in the final. Atletico are the only club to ever lose three European Cup finals without winning the trophy. And Griezmann, who missed a penalty in last season's final, believes he and Simeone have unfinished business with the Champions League before they look to pastures new. ""He likes it here, he sees in us a squad that has more to give and he does as well,"" added Griezmann. ""He wants to go very far in Champions and La Liga and soon we will have a new stadium. I am sure he will continue with us."""
328,14/03/2017,12:59,Torres returns as Atletico eye quarters once more,Fernando Torres is expected to return just two weeks after losing consciousness in a sickening head clash as Atletico Madrid look to seal their place in the Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday.,"Atletico are strong favourites to reach the last eight for a fourth straight year as Torres was on target in a 4-2 first leg win against Beyer Leverkusen in Germany three weeks ago to give the Spanish side a commanding lead. Torres returned to full training for the first time on Monday since losing consciousness in a challenge with Deportivo la Coruna's Alex Bergantinos that provoked consternation among those on the field and watching around the world. However, thankfully the 32-year-old was released from hospital less than 24 hours later having suffered no serious injuries. ""We imagine that for Wednesday he will be available,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. Whether Torres starts depends on Kevin Gameiro's fitness as the French international missed Saturday's 1-0 win at Granada with an abdominal injury. Atletico will definitely be without captain Gabi and left-back Filipe Luis as they picked up yellow cards towards the end of the first leg to ensure they will be free to play in the quarter-finals. However, despite that apparent show of Atletico's confidence that they already have one foot in the quarters, midfielder Koke warned against complacency. ""We have a great result from the first leg, but we can't be complacent. We need to give our all again on Wednesday,"" said the Spanish international. Leverkusen travel to Spain under new management as Tayfun Korkut replaced the sacked Roger Schmidt after the Germans first leg defeat was followed up by a 6-2 thrashing at Borussia Dortmund. Atletico have only lost one of 20 Champions League games at home under Simeone. However, Leverkusen are hoping for a comeback of Barcelona proportions after the Spanish champions fought back from a 4-0 first leg defeat to beat Paris Saint-Germain 6-1 last week. ""We know it's going to be difficult and it's hardly possible, but we will give it our all and try to make the impossible possible,"" said centre-back Omer Toprak. Leverkusen, though, will be depleted by injury and suspension themselves. Benjamin Henrichs and influential midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu are banned, whilst Toprak, Jonathan Tah, Stefan Kiessling and captain Lars Bender are out injured. ""Everything is possible in football and we know we can do better,"" said striker Kevin Volland after Saturday's 1-1 draw with Werder Bremen left Leverkusen languishing in the bottom half of the Bundesliga table."
329,13/03/2017,17:02,Torres back training after nasty head clash,"Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres returned to training on Monday after recovering from a sickening head clash, suggesting he could play in Wednesday's Champions League tie against Bayer Leverkusen.","Torres lost consciousness in a challenge with Deportivo la Coruna's Alex Bergantinos in a 1-1 draw on March 2 but was later discharged from hospital with no serious injuries. Despite rejoining his team-mates on the training pitch, the 32-year-old has yet to receive the all-clear from doctors though, the club indicated. Atletico coach Diego Simeone last week said he believed Torres would be fit in time for the last 16 second leg at the Vicente Calderon, where Atletico will look to defend their 4-2 lead. The forward came off the bench to score Atletico's fourth goal in the first leg in Germany but has been sidelined for the team's last two games in La Liga."

Wanda have had ties with Atletico since January 2015 when it acquired 20percent of the club. ""The payment will be made in three annual instalments, for a total of 30,422,520 euros, with interest,"" a spokesman for Madrid Town Hall said. ""In addition the club will take over the access work, for a total of 29.875 million euros and the construction of 4,000 public parking spaces."" La Peineta -- also known as the Madrid Olympic Stadium -- was originally built to host athletics, and was renovated with a view to Madrid's failed bids to host the Olympic Games in 2012 and 2016. Built in 1904 its capacity will be increased from 20,000 to 73,000 places. The new ground's name is also a reference to the club's first real stadium, the Metropolitano, where they played their first La Liga games before moving to the Vicente Calderon in the south of the city in 1966. The Vicente Calderon, which hosts the Copa del Rey final on May 27, will be destroyed after the La Liga side have vacated the premises at the end of the season."

""He is in the recovery process and we imagine that for Wednesday he will be available,"" said Simeone. Atletico welcome Leverkusen to the Vicente Calderon boasting a 4-2 first-leg lead after Torres scored his side's fourth in Germany two weeks ago.

He hit the ground hard and appeared to have already lost consciousness. Players from both sides immediately called for urgent medical attention. Distressed Atletico defender Jose Maria Gimenez was seen crying. Deportivo fans gave the former Spanish international a standing ovation of encouragement as he was stretchered off the field. But a CT scan revealed Torres suffered no traumatic brain injuries. And the striker sent out a message on Twitter from his hospital bed just after midnight. ""Thanks to all of you who were worried for me and for your messages of encouragement,"" Torres said. ""It was just a scare. I hope to be back soon."" Atletico also confirmed that no serious damage had apparently been inflicted. ""A cranial and cervical CT scan carried out on Fernando Torres has ruled out that the Rojiblanco striker has suffered any alterations or traumatic injuries,"" Atletico said in a statement. ""Our player, who is stable, conscious and lucid, had to be removed by ambulance after being stabilised according to the usual protocol, before entering the Model Hospital of La Coruna."" The club said Torres left hospital on Friday. ""He will have to observe a 48-hour rest."" Atletico coach Diego Simeone acknowledged the widespread worries over the clash of heads but sought to play down the severity. ""The action was not pretty to watch but these are the events that unfortunately happen during a game. We wish Fernando all the best,"" Simeone told a press conference after the game ended in a 1-1 draw. ""We are all scared,"" Atletico left-back Filipe Luis told BeIN Sports. ""The news we have received until now is good. The most important thing is that Fernando is ok."" Atletico's Sime Vrsaljko and captain Gabi have also been praised for reacting quickly to ensure Torres didn't swallow his tongue whilst unconscious. The visitors had to play out seven minutes of stoppage time with 10 men as they had already made all three substitutions. Former West Bromwich Albion manager Pepe Mel was making his bow as Deportivo coach after only being hired on Wednesday.

336,26/02/2017,18:15,Messi haunts Atletico once more to send Barca top,Lionel Messi struck the winner four minutes from time as Barcelona moved top of La Liga on Sunday with a crucial 2-1 win at Atletico Madrid.,"All the goals came in the final half hour as Rafinha put Barcelona in front before Diego Godin's header quickly restored parity. However, so often the thorn in Atletico's side, Messi registered his 27th career goal against Los Rojiblancos to ease the pressure on under fire Barca coach Luis Enrique. Barcelona now lead Real Madrid and Sevilla by two points. Real, though, have two games in hand on their title rivals, the first of which comes later on Sunday at Villarreal. Defeat leaves fourth-placed Atletico just one point clear of Real Sociedad in the battle for the final Champions League slot. Following their Champions League thrashing at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain and struggles at home to Leganes last weekend, Luis Enrique switched from the Catalans habitual 4-3-3 to a 3-4-3 with Messi forced into an advanced midfield role. However, the change in tactics did little to stem Barca's slump in form early on as Atletico dominated the opening half hour. Yannick Carrasco and Godin blasted wildly off target when well placed inside the area early on. Antoine Griezmann then saw a goalbound effort blocked by French international teammate Samuel Umtiti. Atletico's best effort of the opening half came from long range, though, as Griezmann's driven effort on his weaker right foot forced a brilliant flying save from Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Barcelona thought they had gone in front against the run of play on the half hour mark when Luis Suarez headed in from close range after a goalmouth scramble. However, the Uruguayan was penalised for a handball after Jan Oblak had parried Messi's initial effort. Oblak was making his first appearance since December 12, but the Slovenian showed no signs of rustiness to once again prove his credentials as one of the finest 'keepers in the world. Firstly, Oblak produced a sensational stop to tip Messi's dipping free-kick over and then clutched Gerard Pique's header from point-blank range. Both sides passed up huge chances at the start of the second-half. Firstly, Suarez screwed his shot horribly wide after being played in by Messi. Then at the other end, Ter Stegen made another excellent stop to deny Griezmann from a narrow angle. The deadlock was eventually broken in scrappy fashion on 63 minutes as Rafinha profited from a loose ball inside the area to fire low into the far corner. However, the lead lasted only seven minutes as Godin rose higher than a host of Barca defenders to flick home Koke's free-kick for the equaliser. Yet, when Barca needed a potential season defining goal, Messi again came up trumps with his 35th in as many games this season. The five-time World Player of the Year's first effort from Suarez's cut-back was blocked, but he followed up to prod past the helpless Oblak and move Barca top of the table."
337,25/02/2017,17:02,"Barcelona still the best, warns Atletico's Simeone",Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone insisted Barcelona remain the best team in the world despite their recent struggles ahead of the sides third meeting this month on Sunday.,"A poor opening first 45 minutes in the first leg of their Copa del Rey semi-final tie cost Atletico dear as wonder goals from Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi put Barca well on their way to a 3-2 aggregate win. However, since then Barca have been thrashed 4-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League and needed a last-minute Messi penalty to see off lowly Leganes last weekend, placing coach Luis Enrique in the firing line. ""Barca are still the best in the world,"" said Simeone on Saturday. ""It is very difficult to compete as they have in the past decade. With Luis Enrique they have eight trophies, competed at the highest level and one bad game like against Paris can happen to anyone. ""We played three extraordinary halves against them and still didn't get through, that shows that they are better."" By contrast, Atletico are well on course to reach the Champions League quarter-finals for a fourth straight year after a 4-2 win away at Bayer Leverkusen in their last 16, first leg on Tuesday. Kevin Gameiro looks set to keep his place ahead of Fernando Torres alongside Antoine Griezmann up front as he shone brightest despite all three getting on the scoresheet in midweek. Atletico will be further boosted by the return of defensive lynchpin Diego Godin from injury, whilst goalkeeper Jan Oblak could make his first appearance since December after recovering from surgery on a dislocated shoulder. Luis Enrique, meanwhile, is hoping a first midweek off since the turn of the year is what Barca needed to recharge their batteries and recover their form. ""It is the first free midweek we have had in 2017. The schedule has been brutal and it is evident that takes its toll,"" said Enrique. ""The week allowed us to work on things, for the team to rest and analyse what is going on with the team."" Real Madrid's defeat to Valencia in midweek means Barca still trail their title rivals by just a point. And Luis Enrique's men can go top for at least a few hours with victory at the Vicente Calderon, with Madrid not in action until later on Sunday at Villarreal."

A Kevin Gameiro penalty then restored Atletico's two-goal advantage just before the hour mark, and while a Stefan Savic own goal gave Leverkusen hope again, Fernando Torres came off the bench to make it 4-2 late on. The home side put in a brave performance and came close to equalising in the last 10 minutes, but Torres' late goal sealed a deserved victory for the visitors ahead of the return in Spain next month. Leverkusen started brightly, while Atletico looked to hit them on the break, and in the opening 10 minutes both had chances. But in the 17th minute, the away side pounced. Cutting in from the right, Saul Niguez curled a fine shot into the far corner from the edge of the penalty area. Atletico then grasped the game by the scruff of the neck and in the 25th minute a mistake by Aleksandar Dragovic allowed Gameiro to run at goal. He then squared the ball to Griezmann, who rifled a shot past Bernd Leno. To their credit, Leverkusen rallied and Kevin Kampl forced an excellent save from Miguel Angel Moya from long range. Only a fine stop by Leno at the other end prevented Griezmann from scoring again but Leverkusen quickly pulled a goal back at the start of the second half. Benjamin Henrichs found space on the right and delivered a low cross which Karim Bellarabi turned into the far corner. It was no less than the Leverkusen forwards deserved, but their defence continued to struggle. Gameiro first hit the bar before extending Atletico's lead from the penalty spot just before the hour mark. Dragovic was at fault again as he wrestled Gameiro to the ground in the penalty area and the Frenchman calmly struck the ball down the middle to make it 3-1. Leverkusen refused to give up, and an own goal gifted them another route back into the game on 66 minutes. Fresh off the bench, Joel Pohjanpalo delivered a fine cross which ricocheted off Savic and into the Atletico net. At 3-2, the hosts looked invigorated, and Javier Hernandez nearly equalised with 10 minutes to go, his shot cleared just in front of the line by Filipe Luis. It was substitute Torres who secured the win late on, heading the ball in at the near post to make it 4-2 with just four minutes to play."

Cutting in from the right, Saul Niguez curled a fine shot into the far corner from the edge of the penalty area. Atletico then grasped the game by the scruff of the neck and in the 25th minute a mistake by Aleksandar Dragovic allowed Gameiro to run at goal. He then squared the ball to Griezmann, who rifled a shot past Bernd Leno. To their credit, Leverkusen rallied and Kevin Kampl forced an excellent save from Miguel Angel Moya from long range. Only a fine stop by Leno at the other end prevented Griezmann from scoring again but Leverkusen quickly pulled a goal back at the start of the second half. Benjamin Henrichs found space on the right and delivered a low cross which Karim Bellarabi turned into the far corner. It was no less than the Leverkusen forwards deserved, but their defence continued to struggle. Gameiro first hit the bar before extending Atletico's lead from the penalty spot just before the hour mark. Dragovic was at fault again as he wrestled Gameiro to the ground in the penalty area and the Frenchman calmly struck the ball down the middle to make it 3-1. Leverkusen refused to give up, and an own goal gifted them another route back into the game on 66 minutes. Fresh off the bench, Joel Pohjanpalo delivered a fine cross which ricocheted off Savic and into the Atletico net. At 3-2, the hosts looked invigorated, and Javier Hernandez nearly equalised with 10 minutes to go, his shot cleared just in front of the line by Filipe Luis. It was substitute Torres who secured the win late on, heading the ball in at the near post to make it 4-2 with just four minutes to play."

""Oblak has received the medical all clear at the end of Sunday morning's training session,"" Atletico said in a statement. ""The Slovenian has been able to fully train with the rest of the group since Wednesday."" Oblak's return is a timely boost with Atletico's defence depleted by injuries to centre-back Diego Godin and right-back Juanfran."

""I was glad to be involved, it's of course something really special,"" said Bellarabi. Diego Simeone's Atletico are the visitors in the Champions League on Tuesday in the last 16, first-leg, with the return in Madrid on March 15. ""But now we have to look ahead. We want to really put our foot down against Atletico and give it all we have,"" added Bellarabi. His milestone score gave Leverkusen the lead before Javier Hernandez netted twice to leave the ex-Manchester United star with five goals in his last three games. 'Chicharito' is on fire again after an 11-match goal drought in Germany's top flight. Leverkusen have won their last two league games to ease the pressure on coach Roger Schmidt, amidst reports the club contacted namesake and Mainz coach Martin Schmidt as a possible replacement. Leverkusen have not got past the Round of 16 since reaching the 2002 Champions League final and have suffered knock-out stage heartbreak in recent years. They lost to Atletico Madrid on penalties in 2015 in the last 16, after it finished 1-1 on aggregate. In 2014, they were hammered 4-0 at home by Paris St Germain at the same stage, when Zlatan Ibrahimovic netted twice, before a 2-1 loss in France. That followed a 7-1 thrashing in the last 16 in 2012 at the hands of Barcelona, for whom Lionel Messi scored a record five goals, in a 10-2 aggregate loss after a 3-1 defeat at Leverkusen."

""I feel great at the club and in Madrid,"" Griezmann told FIFA.com. Any move for the Frenchman would be complicated by Atletico's reluctance to sell as they face a transfer ban on registering new players this summer and move to a new 67,000-seater stadium. ""On a personal level I'm very happy, and in football terms we're about to move to a new stadium, which is very important,"" added Griezmann. ""We'll just have to see what the future brings, but for now I'm very happy here and I hope to win trophies with this club."" Simeone is expected to remain for at least one more season at Atletico after reducing the length of his contract that was originally supposed to go to 2020 but now will run out at the end after the 2017/18 season. And Griezmann said it is thanks to the Argentine his star has risen since joining from Real Sociedad in 2014. ""He's changed me. He's brought so many things to my game that it's hard to even begin to say what they are. ""Let's just say that I wouldn't have been regarded as one of the best players in the world if it weren't for him. ""More than anything he's helped me to be more effective in front of goal, to take every chance that comes my way, and, of course, to run and run and work hard for the team. ""You can't make it at Atletico if you don't do that."""

""I am very happy and want to keep improving at Atletico,"" Partey told the club's website. Partey, 23, joined Atletico in 2011 and made his breakthrough into the first team last season after loan spells at Mallorca and Almeria. He has scored three goals in 31 appearances for Los Rojiblancos and was part of the Ghana side that reached the semi-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations this month."
344,07/02/2017,13:37,"Atletico president rules out Costa, Aguero returns",Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo quashed rumours the La Liga side could launch bids to bring back Diego Costa or Sergio Aguero should they get a transfer ban overturned.,"Aguero has been dropped by Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola for Brazilian wonder kid Gabriel Jesus in City's last two outings and hinted an exit was looming at the end of the season after Sunday's 2-1 win over Swansea City. Despite scoring 102 times in a five-year spell at Atletico before joining City in 2011, Cerezo criticised the Argentine for leaving the club on bad terms. ""If he had left in a normal and cordial manner then there would have been no problem, but I don't know what happened to him,"" Cerezo told Spanish radio station Cope. ""He left on very bad terms rather than as a hero."" By contrast, Cerezo has consistently stated Atletico's desire to bring back Costa, who fired them to the Liga title in 2013/14. Atletico and the player's wish for a reunion was rejected last summer by Chelsea and Costa has gone on to become a huge part of Antonio Conte's side's march towards the Premier League title with 15 goals this season. However, there are doubts about his future at Stamford Bridge amid reports of a falling-out with Conte last month and reported interest from China. ""He is at a great club. They say he is going to China, but I don't see Chelsea letting him go,"" added Cerezo. Any transfer activity for Atletico in the summer window depends on the club winning their appeal against a transfer ban imposed by FIFA for unlawful signing of foreign minors. Atletico have already served one of the two transfer-window bans and, having seen cross-city rivals Real Madrid get a similar ban reduced to one window, Cerezo is hopeful the Court of Arbitration for Sport will grant them a similar ruling. ""We hope they lift (the ban) and we can sign this summer,"" he added. ""We had the same problem as Real Madrid. If they have lifted it from them, why wouldn't they lift it from us?"" Manchester United are meanwhile reportedly willing to match the 100-million-euro ($108 million) buyout clause for top-scorer Antoine Griezmann. Cerezo is determined to keep him. ""Every time I see Antoine I give him a hug,"" he said. ""Antoine is a fantastic player and loves life at Atletico."" Cerezo added that Atletico will wait for a full judgment in the case against defender Lucas Hernandez for domestic violence before deciding what action to take. Hernandez and his partner were arrested following an incident in the early hours of Friday morning. Neither made a complaint against the other, but Spain's public prosecutor has asked for both to be sentenced, with Hernandez facing a seven-month prison sentence and his partner a six-month sanction. ""When the judges have their say, we will give our opinion and say what we have to say,"" said Cerezo. ""Atletico Madrid is against any kind of domestic violence."""

Neither party made a complaint against the other but the public prosecutor has asked for both to be sentenced, with Hernandez's partner facing a six month sanction. Even if convicted, neither will likely spend any time behind bars as sentences under two years are normally suspended for first-time offenders in Spain. ""The public prosecutor accuses the Atletico Madrid defender of having committed a presumed act of domestic violence and causing light injuries,"" said Madrid's High Court in a statement. Pending their trial, the two have been banned from being within 500 metres of each other. Hernandez and his younger brother Theo, 19 and on loan from Atletico to Alaves, are both French youth internationals."

""The match situation is that one team has a clear advantage, which is us, while the other is obliged to score two goals,"" said Enrique. ""It will be a match which forces Atletico Madrid to show more."" The visitors to the Camp Nou on Tuesday have enjoyed much success in that fabled stadium in recent seasons, but Enrique said that was playing a style in which they ""camped in their own half"" whereas now they will be forced to ""press high up the pitch"". Enrique is hoping to recover injured midfield pair Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta for the game. Atletico coach Diego Simeone said his team will ""play with the same intensity that we've shown in the best moments of this season"". The Argentine admitted it will be ""difficult"" to progress but added: ""We're confident and we know how we want to approach the match. We'll give our all."" The winners will face either Celta Vigo or Alaves in the final. Those two drew their first leg 0-0 and meet on Wednesday in the return."

Atletico provided no timetable for the defender's return, but reports in the Spanish press suggested the 22-year-old would be sidelined for between one to two months. Gimenez will miss the visit of holders Barcelona in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday as well as the return leg of the semi-final on February 7. He is also likely to be unavailable for the first leg of the Champions League last 16 clash away to Bayer Leverkusen in three weeks' time. Gimenez left the pitch in tears over the weekend as he was forced off in the 55th minute against Alaves but was quick to try and downplay the severity of his injury. ""I thank you from the heart for your affection but the tears were of helplessness rather than pain. I will soon be back helping my team,"" he wrote on his Twitter account."
348,27/12/2016,18:33,Simeone to stay at Atletico next season - club chief,"Argentine coach Diego Simeone will remain at Atletico Madrid next season, the club's chief executive officer Miguel Angel Gil Marin said Tuesday.","Simeone, 46, signed a contract extension in 2015 that originally tied him to the club until June 2020, an unusually long deal by Spanish standards. But in September he reduced the deal to 2018 after talks with Atletico, sparking speculation that he may leave. Asked about Simeone's future, Gil Marin said he will stay at Atletico ""this season and the next for sure."" ""He has been with us for five years and it would be reasonable if he stayed with us many more because we are delighted,"" he added during an interview with private television La Sexta. ""We continue to grow, both him and the club, and what would be most intelligent for both parts would be to continue."" Simeone, a former Atletico midfielder, has led the club to a host of trophies since becoming coach in 2011, including the domestic title in 2014 and two Champions League finals, in 2014 and 2016. But the club's form has stuttered this season and Atletico find themselves in sixth in La Liga with 28 points. Atletico are not in league action again until January 7 as La Liga takes a winter break over the new year."

So why not remain linked to a club I love?,"" he told Spanish sports daily Marca. ""I have possibly found my place in the world, we will see,"" he added. In charge of Atletico since 2011, Simeone signed a contract in March 2015 that originally tied him to the club until June 2020. But the 46-year-old, who has been linked to many of Europe's top clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain, Arsenal and Inter Milan, in September reduced the contract to 2018 after talks with Atletico. Simeone said that decision was in the best interests of the club, which he took to the Spanish league title in 2014 and to two of the last three Champions League finals. ""I believe it is the best situation which we found to continue being demanding of myself and, at the same time, think of what is best for the club,"" he said. ""If the club continues to want to count on us, and if it carries out the efforts it has been doing for this...we can possibly remain together,"" he added. Atletico lost out on a first Champions League title to Real Madrid on penalties in May and finished just three points adrift of La Liga champions Barcelona. The club's form has stuttered this season and Simeone's side find themselves in sixth in La Liga with 28 points. Atletico are not in league action again until January 7 as La Liga takes a winter break over the new year."

However, Simeone stoutly defended his side's record in 2016 as they lost out on a first Champions League title to Real on penalties in May and finished just three points adrift of La Liga champions Barcelona. ""Taking into account where we have come from, we have ended an extraordinary year,"" said Simeone. ""It was a year in which the team managed to compete in the final of the Champions League, almost until the final day in La Liga, we are once again in the last 16 of this edition of the Champions League and the Copa del Rey has started well. ""It is true we have been a bit inconsistent in La Liga, but it was an historic year for the club."" Atletico aren't in league action again until January 7 as La Liga takes a winter break over the new year. ""The break is there to rest and we will always look for solutions that can help the team come back strong,"" said Simeone on whether the break comes at the right time for his squad. Star forward Antoine Griezmann in particular looks in need of a rest as the Frenchman failed to score for a ninth consecutive La Liga game. Griezmann was rewarded with third place in the Ballon d'Or this week for his fine year in leading both Atletico and France to the Champions League and Euro 2016 finals respectively. And Simeone insisted the goals will come in the new year should Griezmann maintain his level of performance. ""Griezmann is playing as we have become accustomed to, but unfortunately the goals aren't coming for him."""

Slovenia international Oblak, an integral part of the team since signing in July 2014 from Portuguese side Benfica, was replaced by Miguel Angel Moya in the 40th minute of the match. ""He will have to undergo surgery in the coming days,"" Atletico said in a statement. The club did not say how long the player would be sidelined but Spanish media said he would be out for three or four months. Atletico's Portuguese international midfielder Tiago, 35, also limped off during the first half at El Madrigal with discomfort in his right knee and was replaced by Saul Niguez.

353,06/12/2016,22:57,Lewandowski seals Bayern win over Atletico,A Robert Lewandowski free-kick sealed Bayern Munich's 1-0 win over Atletico Madrid on Tuesday in the Champions League with both teams already through to the knock-out stage.,"Despite the result at Munich's bitterly cold Allianz Arena, Atletico go into the draw for the last 16 as Group D winners with Bayern second. Having been knocked out in the semi-finals by Atletico last season, Bayern avenged their 1-0 defeat in Madrid in September and extended their record streak in Champions League to 15 wins at home. But Lewandowski's superb first-half strike was the difference. ""He's been hitting those in training all season,"" said Bayern's Germany defender Mats Hummels. ""We allowed them a couple of big chances early on and then nothing after that. ""We did a good job and the most important thing is that he has things in hand defensively."" Atletico, who were close to full strength, suffered their first defeat in the group stages this season having been the only team to win all of their previous five. It denied them a club record of a perfect six. Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti switched from the 4-2-3-1 formation, which won 3-1 at Mainz in the Bundesliga, with a 4-3-3 formation, surprisingly leaving Thomas Mueller on the bench. Lewandowski played either side of Arjen Robben and Douglas Costa on the wings with Thiago Alcantara, Arturo Vidal and teenage Portugal international Renato Sanches in midfield. Diego Simeone's Atletico made a bright start with Yannick Carrasco, who scored when the hosts won 1-0 in Madrid in September, twice forcing Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer into action. Bayern took the lead when Poland's Lewandowski majestically floated his free-kick over the wall from the edge of the box and into the top corner on 28 minutes. It was from almost exactly the same position Lewandowski scored from in Friday's 3-1 win at Mainz, but Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak was powerless to stop it. It was Lewandowski's 24th goal in 24 appearances for club and country this season. In celebration, the 28-year-old shoved the matchball under his playing shirt and stuck his thumb in his mouth amidst rumours in the Polish media that his wife Anna is pregnant. Atletico's defence closed down the Bayern attack after the break with Sanches twice unable to get a clean shot away from good positions due to Madrid shirts blocking him. The hosts starved Atletico of the ball with Bayern enjoying just under 75 percent possession. Thiago squandered a golden chance to add a second on 78 minutes. Costa whipped in a pin-point cross, but the Spain international's half volley from five metres out flew over the bar with the goal at his mercy."
354,05/12/2016,12:30,Flawless Atletico hunt perfect six at Bayern,Atletico Madrid can make club history at Bayern Munich on Tuesday as the Spaniards look for a record sixth group stage win with both teams through to the last 16.,"Diego Simeone's men arrive in Munich as the only side with a 100 percent record after five wins from five Champions League games. The Group D leaders are six points clear of second-placed Bayern, who they beat 1-0 in Madrid in September, thanks to Yannick Carrasco's first-half winner. Only five teams have achieved the feat of winning all six Champions League group stage games: Real Madrid (twice, 2011/12, 2014/15), AC Milan (1992/93), Paris Saint-Germain (1994/95), Spartak Moscow (1995/96) and Barcelona (2002/03). The match at Munich's Allianz Arena is a dead rubber and regardless of the result Atletico will progress as group winners with Bayern second. But Saul Niguez, who scored Atletico's winner in last season's home semi-final, said the Spaniards are taking nothing for granted. ""We still want to put on a top performance. We always want to win and fight for every title, but it will be difficult against Bayern,"" the defender said. Bayern have their own record run to maintain in Munich as their 4-1 victory over PSV in October was their 14th straight home win in the Champions League -- a competition best. Regardless, Bayern want a good performance after their 3-2 defeat at Rostov last time out. ""It's a matter of honour and pride,"" Bayern midfielder Thiago Alcantara told Sky. ""Everyone wants to win and there is nothing better than winning against a team like Atletico."" Bayern also have a score to settle after September's defeat in Madrid and semi-final exit last season at the hands of Atletico and Antoine Griezmann. Atletico lost last season's final to neighbours Real in Milan on penalties having squeezed past Bayern in the semis. Madrid beat Bayern 1-0 at home and although the Germans won the return 2-1 in Munich last May, Griezmann's crucial away goal knocked the Bavarians out on a night when Thomas Mueller and Fernando Torres had penalties saved. ""The semi-finals were painful, but it's a thing of the past. Now we want a good performance,"" said Thiago. Atletico's contrasting domestic and European fortunes so far this season continued as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Espanyol at home on Saturday. The result leaves them nine points adrift of runaway Spanish league leaders Real Madrid. Atletico have at least recovered their defensive solidity with four consecutive clean sheets following a 3-0 reverse to Real two weeks ago. Simeone has named a full strength 20-man squad for the trip to Germany, but key players like Diego Godin, Carrasco and Griezmann could be rested for their crucial La Liga match at Villarreal next Monday. Having won the Bundesliga title for each of the last four seasons -- a German league record -- Bayern find themselves in the unusual position of second in Germany's top flight, three points adrift of leaders RB Leipzig. Head coach Carlo Ancelotti experimented for Friday's 3-1 win at Mainz. He switched Thomas Mueller from the wing to the attacking midfield and opted for a 4-2-3-1 formation, rather than his prefered 4-3-3, which paid off as Robert Lewandowski netted either side of an Arjen Robben goal. It was a return to winning ways after Ancelotti admitted his side made too many mistakes in the defeat to Rostov and 1-0 league loss at Borussia Dortmund last month. ""When we look at the stats, we haven't conceded many goals, but there were many individual mistakes we made and we're working on that,"" said Ancelotti. The Italian says centre-back Jerome Boateng is out with a shoulder injury, while Arturo Vidal will feature at some point after returning from a leg injury he picked up playing for Chile.

And Diego Simeone's men were rarely troubled as two goals in 11 second-half minutes from French international duo Gameiro and Griezmann ensured Atletico remain the only side with a 100 percent Champions League record this season. Simeone can now afford the luxury of resting his key men for the trip to Munich on December 6, whilst PSV must beat Rostov at home to progress into the Europa League. Still smarting from a 3-0 defeat to bitter rivals Real Madrid on Saturday, Simeone made four changes in a bid to rediscover the defensive solidity that has defined his hugely successful five years in charge. The Argentine was rewarded with a first clean sheet in six games, whilst Gameiro took his chance after replacing the hapless Fernando Torres up front. Gameiro should have opened the scoring just eight minutes in when he met Yannick Carrasco's tantalising cross, but somehow shanked his finish well off target from point blank range. Diego Godin headed another good opening too close to PSV 'keeper Jeroen Zoet, but the visitors could have gone in front but for brilliant defensive work from Griezmann midway through the first half. Euro 2016's top scorer raced back as Atletico's last defender to ensure Gaston Pereiro couldn't get a clean strike and goal and Jan Oblak comfortably collected. Atletico had to wait until 10 minutes after the break to make the breakthrough as Griezmann fed Gameiro on the right side of the area and he drilled a low shot in off the far post. The hosts put the game to bed 24 minutes from time when Griezmann latched onto Tiago's through ball and made the most of a stumble by Zoet to fire home his first goal in three games at the near post. Gameiro was then unfortunate not to add his second of the night when a thumping header from Koke's corner came back of the bar."

Indeed, finalists in two of the past three seasons, Atletico now even face a fight to qualify for next year's Champions League after slipping to sixth as Sevilla, Villarreal and Sociedad threaten their status as Spain's third force. Yet, once again Atletico have proved themselves as a serious contender to finally deliver a first ever European Cup after becoming the first side to lose three finals without ever winning the trophy with a heartbreaking penalty shootout defeat to Real Madrid in May. ""They are once of the most respected teams on an international level, they are almost feared,"" said PSV midfielder Andres Guardado. ""They make matches seem very long. You need to make a huge effort and sacrifice to try and match their intensity and to damage one of the best defences in the world."" Atletico's defensive record has been the key to their contrasting form at home and in Europe so far this season. In the Champions League they have remained watertight, conceding just once in four games. However, Real's 3-0 win at the Vicente Calderon on Saturday was the first time Atletico had conceded three at home in the league since 2012 and the first time in Simeone's five-year reign Los Rojiblancos have failed to keep a clean sheet in five games. With that in mind Simeone looks set to ring the changes for PSV's visit with Jose Maria Gimenez set to make his first appearance since September in central defence. Sime Vrsaljko, Nico Gaitan and Kevin Gameiro are also expected to replace Juanfran, Saul Niguez and Fernando Torres from the side that started the derby against Real. Atletico can seal top spot in Group D should they better Bayern Munich's result away to Rostov. Bayern are also already through leaving PSV in a battle with the Russians to qualify for the Europa League in third with both only having taken one point so far."

PSG's Old Trafford misfit Angel Di Maria scored against Nantes but came off in the first half with a thigh injury, albeit not one expected to keep him out. Argentine playmaker Javier Pastore is set to miss the trip to London with a knee problem. Ludogorets (BUL) v Basel (SUI) at Sofia Bulgarians Ludogorets and Basel have proved the makeweights in Group A with both garnering a solitary point to date. A Europa League spot is the consolation prize that awaits the side that can cement third place. The two parted 1-1 in the first meeting in Switzerland. Previous encounters saw the Swiss win handsomely in a two-leg playoff three years ago. Ludogorets will be slight favourites, courtesy of home advantage, and they gave Arsenal a brief scare in their last outing, but let slip a two-goal lead to succumb 3-2. <strong>Group B</strong> Napoli (ITA) v Dynamo Kiev (UKR) at Naples Napoli might just about top the group but they are locked in a three-way struggle with Benfica and Besiktas for two places in the last 16. They came from behind to see off Kiev in Ukraine in the reverse fixture and badly need three points here. Their weekend 2-1 win at Udinese kept them in touch with the top four in Serie A, though prolific striker Arkadiusz Milik is still out injured. Lorenzo Insigne grabbed a brace at Udinese and the Italians will be looking to him and Jose Callejon to fire them past Dynamo, the whipping boys of the group with just one point. Besiktas (TUR) v Benfica (POR) at Istanbul (Kick-off at 1745 GMT) Benfica, level on points with Napoli, travel to Turkey's still-unbeaten Besiktas, who are just a point adrift of the top pair. A Benfica victory will take the two-time champions, top in the Portuguese league, through to the knock-out phase. But they cannot afford to be complacent against a Besiktas side which held them to a draw in Lisbon. The Turkish champions are looking to get out of the pool phase for the first time in six attempts and their fans are sure to give Benfica a hostile reception. <strong>Group C</strong> Celtic (SCO) v Barcelona (ESP) at Glasgow Top spot is still up for grabs in Group C as Barcelona, two points clear of Manchester City, travel to a Celtic side they squashed 7-0 at the Camp Nou. A win for Lionel Messi and Co. -- he is set to return after a sickness bug at the weekend -- will see the Spanish champions into the last 16, though a draw might also do it depending on the other game. Luis Suarez will be back from suspension, which is bad news for a Celtic side who are two points adrift at the bottom of the group. The Scottish giants warmed up for Barca with a 1-0 win over Kilmarnock which left them 13 points clear in their domestic league. Borussia Moenchengladbach (GER) v Manchester City (ENG) at Moenchengladbach, Germany City's Yaya Toure-inspired weekend win at Crystal Palace keeps them a point off leaders Chelsea in the Premier League. But it is at the back that they have worries, particularly the fitness of talisman centre-back Vincent Kompany, who suffered a head injury in a collision with keeper Claudio Bravo at Palace. Victory in Germany for Pep Guardiola's side will see them into the next round. The home side look on course for a Europa League slot and need to pull off a surprise win if they are to have any hope of making further progress in this competition. On current form that looks a tall order after successive domestic losses, to Cologne and Hertha Berlin, sent them into the bottom six in the Bundesliga. <strong>Group D</strong> Rostov (RUS) v Bayern Munich (GER) at Rostov, Russia (Kick-off 1700 GMT) Five-time European champions Bayern head to Russia's Rostov for their Group D clash licking their wounds after being knocked from the top of the Bundesliga. Their 1-0 defeat at Dortmund on Saturday allowed RB Leipzig to finish the weekend top of the German league table. Bayern are already into the last 16 but need a win at Rostov to stay in touch with group leaders Atletico Madrid, who they host on December 6 for a potential top-spot decider. Bayern will be without injured keeper Manuel Neuer, meaning Sven Ulreich will deputise. Rock-bottom Rostov and PSV have a single point each so are locked in a struggle for a Europa League place only. The Russians have a solid home record and held Rubin Kazan to a goalless draw on Friday. Atletico Madrid (ESP) v PSV Eindhoven (NED) at Madrid Atletico might already be through and top of the group, but they are on a poor run in the Spanish league. Beaten finalists in two of the last three editions of the Champions League, the Spaniards will qualify as group winners if they win and Bayern do worse. Coach Diego Simeone seems to be losing his iron grip a tad and success built on a rock-solid defence appears to be slipping. Phillip Cocu's PSV will be massive underdogs nonetheless and they only drew 0-0 at lowly Willem II at the weekend in domestic action, with their Dutch championship hopes evaporating slowly."

""He showed it all last season, he shows it in every game. There is so much expected of him, but he is ahead of the rest.

The performance was even more impressive given Madrid were missing six key players through injury. However, those absences forced Zidane to change his system to devastating effect with Ronaldo playing as a centre-forward and the outstanding Isco in his natural role just behind the Portuguese.

361,18/11/2016,19:37,"Ronaldo, Griezmann face final 2016 shootout",Cristiano Ronaldo and Antoine Griezmann have a late chance to enhance their cases for the Ballon d'Or as the best player in the world in 2016 when Real Madrid travel to Atletico Madrid on Saturday.,"Both are frontrunners along with Barcelona's Lionel Messi among a shortlist of 30 for the prize, but Ronaldo is the strong favourite for his fourth Ballon d'Or having beaten Griezmann in the finals of the Champions League and Euro 2016. AFP Sports looks at a spectacular year for two of Europe's finest forwards. Whilst Real have reigned in three Champions League meetings between the sides in the past three seasons, Atletico have dominated the derby for the last three years in La Liga. Griezmann slotted home a brilliantly taken winner as the red and white side of Madrid celebrated a 1-0 win at Real's Santiago Bernabeu in the last league meeting between the sides in February. Despite scoring just twice from open play in his last 13 games against Atletico, Ronaldo has remained perfect from the penalty spot. For the second time in three seasons a Champions League final ended with Ronaldo scoring from the spot to vanquish a desolate Atletico as Real edged their 11th European Cup in a shootout after a 1-1 draw in May. Griezmann also netted into the shootout in Milan, but was left to regret smashing the bar with a penalty in normal time that could have delivered Atletico their first European crown. Griezmann shrugged off that disappointment in style as he carried the hopes of host nation France all the way to the final of Euro 2016. He even had to deal with the blow of being dropped after a disappointing opening night performance against Romania. However, he came off the bench to net a 90th-minute opener against Albania and never looked back as six goals, including a famous double against old foes Germany in the semi-final, won Griezmann the Golden Boot. In contrast to Griezmann's stunning tournament, Ronaldo endured a rollercoaster of emotions in France. From throwing a reporter's microphone into a lake and missing a crucial penalty against Austria, he came good just in time with a double against Hungary that ensured Portugal didn't suffer an embarrassing group stage exit. Instead, they went on to win their first major international tournament, despite Ronaldo scoring just once more, in the semi-final against Wales. Ronaldo even had to watch Eder's winner to stun France from the sidelines having hobbled off early in the final in tears after suffering knee ligament damage. On the back of his Euros success and with Atletico finally strong enough financially to resist mega offers for their star players, Griezmann cashed in with a new contract to keep him tied to Los Rojiblancos till 2021. Once again, though, Ronaldo went bigger and better with his new five-year deal signed earlier this month securing his position as the world's highest-paid sportsman."
362,18/11/2016,19:08,Simeone: Atletico now on a par with Real,Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone believes his side can now count themselves as equals when facing Real Madrid in the last La Liga derby at Atletico's Vicente Calderon stadium on Saturday.,"Simeone has overseen a dramatic turnaround in Atletico's fortunes since taking over nearly five years ago, including ending a 14-year winless streak against Real to win the Copa del Rey in 2013. Since then Atletico have lost two Champions League finals to Real, but haven't lost in their last six league meetings with the European champions. ""We believe in our own strengths, we know our own virtues and, above all, our own deficiencies,"" said Simeone on Friday. ""We know there was a long time when they were better than us and nowadays we compete on a par with them. ""It is obvious one match is not a league, it is just one match and anything can happen."" Atletico won't be short of motivation in the first clash between the sides since Real edged May's Champions League final on penalties. The club plans to move to a new 67,000 capacity stadium next season, but as well as possibly hosting Real for the final time at the Calderon, Atletico are also in more need of the points as they trail the league leaders by six points. ""The fans will be the same as always, we need them to be the 12th man,"" added Simeone. Whilst Real are injury-ravaged without four key players in Pepe, Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Alvaro Morata, Atletico hope to be at full-strength should top-scorer Antoine Griezmann shake off a bruised left foot to start. ""He is better, he trained normally yesterday,"" said Simeone when quizzed on Griezmann's fitness. ""This morning he was treated again. He is making a huge effort to be fit. ""I hope he finishes training today in good shape and to be able to include him in the squad."""
363,01/11/2016,22:57,Griezmann strikes late winner as Atletico advance,Antoine Griezmann scored a 93rd-minute winner as Atletico Madrid secured their place in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over FC Rostov at the Vicente Calderon.,"Griezmann's brilliant volleyed effort gave Atletico the lead just before the half-hour mark, but Rostov immediately replied through Sardar Azmoun. Atletico struggled to create chances throughout, but got a break deep into added time when Griezmann fired home and the goal was allowed to stand despite Rostov's furious protests for offside. Victory keeps Atletico three points clear of Bayern Munich at the top of Group D. The Germans also qualified for the knockout phase on Tuesday with a 2-1 win at PSV Eindhoven. Atletico had scored 18 goals in winning their last five home games, but laboured against the Russians' deep-lying defence. The on-form Yannick Carrasco found some rare space in behind the Rostov back line 18 minutes in from Griezmann's fine through ball, but Soslan Dzhanaev rushed from his line to block the Belgian's effort. Griezmann opened the scoring in spectacular fashion as he spun onto a deflected effort to flick the ball into the top corner with the outside of his left foot. However, the lead lasted just two minutes as Atletico were caught by a brilliant Rostov counter-attack when Dmitri Poloz timed his pass into Azmoun to perfection and the Iranian slotted low past Jan Oblak. It was the first time Atletico had conceded in the Champions League this season and Rostov became only the second away team to score at the Calderon in the last 15 European games. The hosts dominated from then on, but lacked the creativity or physical presence up front to break down the Rostov wall of defenders. Dzhanaev comfortably smothered low shots from Koke and Carrasco, while Atletico coach Diego Simeone ended the game with four forwards on the pitch as Kevin Gameiro and Angel Correa joined Griezmann and a forlorn Fernando Torres. However, last season's finalists needed the presence of central defender Diego Godin when the winner did arrive in controversial circumstances deep into injury time. Griezmann barely celebrated as he converted what appeared to be Godin's flick-on off the underside of the bar. Yet, despite the offside flag being raised, Scottish referee Craig Thomson rightly identified the flick-on in fact came off a Rostov player, meaning Griezmann couldn't be in an offside position."
364,31/10/2016,18:00,Carrasco magic leads Atletico's case for Euro redemption,"After another case of so near yet so far for Atletico Madrid, the spectacular form of Yannick Carrasco is powering the latest strong bid from Diego Simeone's men to finally be crowned kings of Europe.","Victory at home to Champions League debutants FC Rostov on Tuesday will seal Atletico's place in the last 16 for the fourth consecutive year with two games to spare. Carrasco's goal in May's final of last season's Champions League wasn't enough as cross-city rivals Real Madrid emerged victorious in a penalty shoot-out. Atletico are now the only team to have lost three finals without ever winning the European Cup -- two of them in the past three seasons under Simeone. Yet, with the Belgian winger enjoying a breakout second season at the Vicente Calderon, Antoine Griezmann and Kevin Gameiro forging a prolific partnership up front and the best defence in Europe proving as solid as ever, Atletico could make their final year at the Calderon one to remember. Carrasco's six goals in his last four games mean he has even ousted Euro 2016's top marksman Griezmann as Atletico's top scorer this season. ""He has improved with a lot of hard work, sacrifice and, above all, understanding the potential he has,"" said Simeone after Carrasco's double saw off Malaga 4-2 in La Liga on Saturday. He has also shone in Europe. Carrasco has provided the winner in Atletico's last two Champions League outings as three 1-0 wins over PSV Eindhoven, Bayern Munich and Rostov put them in a commanding position at the top of Group D. ""I feel great. Thanks to the team I am in very good form and I hope to continue like this,"" said Carrasco. The 23-year-old has also already improved his tally of goals from an inconsistent first season in Spain when he hit five in 43 appearances in all competitions. ""May he keep improving because he has a lot to offer,"" added Simeone. ""Hopefully he understands that his biggest virtue is his ambition and hopefully he maintains that."" Atletico quickly realised the talent they have on their hands, extending Carrasco's contract to 2022 earlier this month just over 12 months into the five-year deal he signed when joining from Monaco for 20 million euros ($22 million). Carrasco may also feel he has a debt to repay in the Champions League. Despite his strike in the final against Real in Milan, he watched on as right-back Juanfran missed the crucial penalty having not stepped up to take one himself. It could have been so different for Atletico had Griezmann not hit the bar with a second-half spot-kick. The character showed by the Frenchman to shrug off that disappointment and net in the shoot-out was a reflection on his improvement not only as a player, but of his mental strength under Simeone. Griezmann arrived at Atletico just over two years ago as a talented winger and has since been transformed into one of the most potent strikers in the world. Simeone's same tonic has rubbed off on a more confident and free-scoring Carrasco."
365,21/10/2016,13:08,Carrasco pens Atletico contract extension,"Belgium international Yannick Carrasco has extended his contract with Atletico Madrid until 2022, the Spanish club confirmed on Friday.","""I'm very happy to carry on for many more years with Atletico,"" said Carrasco, after signing a two-year extension with last year's Champions League finalists. The 23-year-old winger moved to the Spanish capital from Monaco in July 2015 and has established himself as a key player in Diego Simeone's plans this season. Carrasco has scored five goals in 11 appearances this term, including a hat-trick in last weekend's 7-1 demolition of Granada, already matching his tally from his first season at the Vicente Calderon. ""It's great news for everyone involved with Atletico,"" added the club's sporting director, Jose Luis Perez Caminero."
366,07/10/2016,16:42,Atletico captain Gabi extends contract,"Atletico Madrid captain Gabi will remain with the La Liga side ahead of the move into their new stadium next season after penning a one-year extension, the club announced on Friday.","The 33-year-old midfielder, a product of Atletico's youth academy, is in his second spell with his boyhood club, having returned from Real Zaragoza to help Diego Simeone's side claim the league title in 2013-14. Atletico have also reached the final of the Champions League twice in the past three years, losing on both occasions to city rivals Real Madrid. ""I am very happy to continue for one more year at home. I always say that playing with Atletico Madrid was my childhood dream, so I cannot ask for more than what I am experiencing,"" Gabi told the club's official website."
367,30/09/2016,01:45,Spain's big three renew title battle,"After another stellar week for Spanish clubs in the Champions League, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid resume their three-way battle for La Liga supremacy on Sunday.","Real were the only Spanish side not to win in midweek, but got a creditable 2-2 draw at Borussia Dortmund to remain on course for the last 16. However, the European champions have now failed to win any of their last three games as draws to Villarreal and Las Palmas have seen their lead at the top of the table whittled down to just a point by Barca. Zinedine Zidane's men conceded a late equaliser for the second time in four days in Dortmund, but defender Danilo insisted Eibar will bear the brunt of Real's frustration when they visit the Santiago Bernabeu this weekend. ""We drew again, but we are playing well and we're calm,"" said the Brazilian international. ""We are not satisfied with the draws but Eibar will pay for that at the weekend."" Real are still without the injured Brazilian duo of Casemiro and Marcelo, but Zidane is likely to rotate his squad again with Alvaro Morata, Marco Asensio and Pepe in contention. Eibar have never taken a point off Madrid in their history, but travel to the Bernabeu full of confidence after a fine start to the season that has carried the Basque minnows to eighth in the table, just four points behind Real. Barcelona continued to shrug off the absence of Lionel Messi as they came from behind to beat Borussia Moenchengladbach on Wednesday and face a third away game in a week when they travel to Celta Vigo. Arda Turan came off the bench to turn the game in Barca's favour with the equaliser in Germany and is expected to start in Messi's place on the right side of the front line alongside Neymar and Luis Suarez in Vigo. ""All my players are full of confidence. I am happy with how all of them are performing,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique ahead of his return to the club he managed for a season before taking charge of the Catalan giants in 2014. Sergio Busquets admitted Barca do still desperately miss Messi. ""We always miss Leo. When you win by the slimmest margin, you notice it more."" Atletico secured the best Champions League result of the three Spanish giants as they repeated their 1-0 semi-final success over Bayern Munich from last season to seal a superb September. After disappointing draws to open the campaign against newly promoted Alaves and Leganes, Atletico reeled off five wins in six games in the past month, only failing to win in a 1-1 draw at Barcelona, to close to within two points of city rivals Real at the top of the table. ""In life there are moments that are difficult to repeat and we are living one of those in terms of our ownership, football, fan base and a fantastic new stadium to come,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""They are moments that can't be repeated."" Atletico can go top for a few hours at least as they kick off Sunday's programme away at Valencia. Caretaker boss Voro will once again take charge of Valencia after leading Los Che to their first two wins of the season since Pako Ayestaran was sacked to move them out of the relegation zone.

368,29/09/2016,01:35,Atletico hit new heights in latest Bayern humbling - Simeone,Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone hailed his side's display as one of the best in his hugely successful five-year reign in charge as Yannick Carrasco inflicted another 1-0 defeat for Bayern Munich at the Vicente Calderon.,"Simeone's men also beat Bayern at home in April on their way to a second Champions League final in three years. And the Argentine lauded Atletico's tactical discipline as they secured an incredible 15th clean sheet and 14th win in 18 home Champions League games under Simeone. ""I feel so proud to be the coach of this team,"" said Simeone. ""I liked everything today. We pressed high, took advantage of spaces on the counter-attack and played with intensity for 90 minutes which is very difficult to do against one of the best teams in the world. ""Tactically, the team interpreted the game fantastically. ""It was one of the best performances in my time at Atletico Madrid."" Carrasco fired home the winner 10 minutes before half-time after Jan Oblak had denied Thomas Muller with a stunning save early on with Bayern's best effort. Atletico could even afford to see top scorer Antoine Griezmann smash a penalty off the crossbar seven minutes from time. Griezmann has now missed four of six penalties he has taken for Atletico, including crucially in defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League final. However, Simeone insisted the Frenchman will remain on spot-kick duty. ""He missed a penalty like (Diego) Maradona, (Lionel) Messi, (Michel) Platini, Zico, all the best players in the world,"" added Simeone. ""He will keep taking them. He has incredible personality. ""He did 1000 things tonight that keep putting him amongst the best forwards in the world."" Griezmann replied with glowing words for Simeone's importance in his progression since joining from Real Sociedad just over two years ago. ""He has been very important for me because he has made me progress. I know I still have a lot to learn from him and I hope to continue like that,"" said the Frenchman ""It is still frustrating to miss the penalty, but it won't be the last time I miss a chance"" Defeat was Bayern's first since Carlo Ancelotti replaced Pep Guardiola in charge after a perfect eight wins from eight before the former Real coach returned to Madrid. However, it was a familiar story for Bayern, as having been knocked out by Spanish sides for the past three seasons in the Champions League, they failed to score on Spanish soil for the fourth consecutive trip. ""Atletico showed a killer instinct tonight, and we did not,"" said goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. ""We will have another chance to beat them in Munich."" Top spot in Group D is likely to come down to that meeting between the sides on December 6 as both won their opening games against FC Rostov and PSV Eindhoven. And Arjen Robben insists Bayern must find away to counteract the ""unpleasant"" tactics used by Atletico. ""That is a big game for the group phase. Last season it was a semi-final and you could see why,"" said the Dutch winger. ""They have a very unpleasant team to play against. ""We started really well. The first 15, 20 minutes were really good. We were aggressive and had chances, which you have to use in a game like that. ""We have to learn from this and keep going."""
369,28/09/2016,22:53,Atletico inflict more pain on Ancelotti's Bayern,Atletico Madrid haunted Bayern Munich once more as Yannick Carrasco inflicted Carlo Ancelotti's first defeat as coach of the German giants with a 1-0 win at the Vicente Calderon in the Champions League on Wednesday.,"The Spaniards eliminated Bayern on away goals in the semi-finals of last season's Champions League and there was to be no revenge for the five-time European champions as Carrasco drove the ball in off the inside of the post 10 minutes before half-time. Thomas Mueller had Bayern's best effort, but was denied by a sensational save from Jan Oblak early on as the German champions failed to score on Spanish soil for the fourth consecutive trip. And Atletico could even afford the luxury of missing a penalty seven minutes from time when Antoine Griezmann rattled the bar from the spot. Victory takes Atletico top of Group D with six points from their opening two games. Bayern remain second on three points with FC Rostov and PSV Eindhoven on one each after a 2-2 draw in Russia. Atletico coach Diego Simeone opted for Fernando Torres up front instead of Kevin Gameiro and the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker had an early claim for a penalty waved away when his shirt appeared to be pulled as he cut inside Javi Martinez. Bayern's first serious attempt on goal was their best as Mueller smashed a volley goalwards on 14 minutes that was brilliantly beaten away by Oblak. Not to be outdone, Bayern stopper Manuel Neuer produced a great save of his own as he got down low to his left to turn Carrasco's first effort of the night to safety. Torres missed a glorious chance to open the scoring when he somehow turned Koke's corner against the post from point-blank range with the goal gaping. And the former Spanish international was off target with another decent chance moments later as he fired into the side-netting from a narrow angle. However, Atletico finally went in front when Griezmann collected a loose ball and freed Carrasco on the left. The Belgian strode forward before unleashing a powerful effort in off the far post. Bayern took a long time to muster a response as Ancelotti brought on Arjen Robben and the on-form Joshua Kimmich. Neuer parried another powerful low effort from Carrasco to keep Bayern in the game midway through the second half. The visitors finally began to threaten in the final 15 minutes as Robert Lewandowski's glancing header flew inches wide of the far post. Robben then drove a shot just wide from the edge of the box. However, it was the hosts who had the best chance to extend their advantage when Arturo Vidal cynically chopped down Filipe Luis inside the area. Griezmann stepped up to take it, but just as in their Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid in May, he smashed his spot-kick against the bar to give Bayern a lifeline. Ancelotti's men had one final chance to rescue a point, but Robben's header drifted harmlessly over as Atletico held on to secure another major European scalp under Simeone."
370,27/09/2016,19:52,Bayern wary of 'extraordinary' Griezmann in Atletico reunion,Bayern Munich captain Philipp Lahm insists the German champions must be on guard to stop Antoine Griezmann as they travel to face their Champions League conquerors last season in Atletico Madrid on Wednesday.,"Griezmann ousted two German sides from semi-finals in recent months as his away goal sealed Atletico's path to the Champions League final after a 2-2 draw on aggregate in May and then scored twice as France dumped the world champions out of Euro 2016. ""He is an extraordinary player as he has showed against us and in the Euros,"" said Lahm. ""He is a very quick player. I don't think you can compare him with (Bayern striker) Robert Lewandowski, he (Griezmann) plays deeper and is very dangerous on the counter-attack."" Bayern have been eliminated by Spanish opposition in the past three seasons and failed to score on all three previous visits. A stat which Spanish international Javi Martinez believes means they can't be called favourites ahead of their trip to the Vicente Calderon. ""We are not favourites, we are playing against one of the best teams in Europe,"" said the midfielder. ""They have many players that are difficult to mark. The most dangerous is Griezmann, he scored in the semi-final in Munich, but what makes Atletico dangerous is how the play as a team."" Carlo Ancelotti, who led Real Madrid to the Champions League at Atletico's expense in the 2014 final, has replaced Pep Guardiola as Bayern boss with the task of turning domestic dominance into a sixth European Cup. Martinez added that Ancelotti's Bayern is slightly more direct than in the previous three years under Guardiola. And Ancelotti hailed Atletico boss Diego Simeone's much more defensive and aggressive style that has turned Los Rojiblancos into one of Europe's most feared sides. ""The trend is to play more direct, to have more efficient possession. Possession allows you to have to control, but the important thing is to have a cutting edge."" added Ancelotti. ""Simeone is a good friend, one of the best coaches in the world and I like his style and his way of playing. ""I would like to play like him now and again."" Defender Mats Hummels has recovered from a knee injury that forced him out of Saturday's 1-0 win at Hamburg as Bayern made it eight wins out of eight since Ancelotti took charge. However, Lahm admitted Atletico would be Bayern's biggest test of the season so far. ""It is a semi-finalist versus a finalist of the Champions League. It is a top match,"" said the former German captain. ""We haven't always played as well as we would like so far this season in the Bundesliga, but we have managed to win. ""It is still just the group stages, but tomorrow it is important to continue a good start to the Champions League."" However, with both sides having won their Group D openers over FC Rostov and PSV Eindhoven, Lahm admitted a draw may suit both teams. ""A point away from home against Atletico would be a good result, but our intention is to win tomorrow."""
371,27/09/2016,14:04,Bayern out to settle Spanish score in Madrid,"After three consecutive semi-final defeats against Spanish clubs in the Champions League, Bayern Munich head to Atletico Madrid for Wednesday's group match with a point to prove.","""We want to show that we can do better than in the last few semi-finals. We certainly have a score to settle there,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller before the team jetted off to Madrid. After the highs of beating Borussia Dortmund in the 2013 Champions League final came Bayern's lows of semi-final exits to Real Madrid, Barcelona and then Atletico in each of the last three seasons under Pep Guardiola. Atletico have won 25 of their last 30 home European games making the Estadio Vicente Calderon something of a cauldron. Last season's semi-final exit at the hands of Diego Simeone's Atletico was particularly painful for Bayern, who won the return leg 2-1 in Munich after losing 1-0 in Madrid as the Spanish side reached the final on away goals. ""In the last three years, we played three times against Spanish teams and always lost there,"" said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. ""We saw how strong Atletico are last season and you can't get much more of a tougher test. ""Now we have the chance to show with Carlo (Ancelotti) that we can get at least a point there -- or even three."" After Guardiola failed to steer Bayern to the Champions League final, his successor Ancelotti is the Bavarian giants' not-so-secret weapon. Two years ago, Ancelotti's Real Madrid won the 2014 Champions League final with a 4-1 extra-time win over Atletico. ""I really like Madrid and I'm looking forward to going back, I had two wonderful years there,"" said Ancelotti. Sightseeing will be the last thing on the Italian's programme, with Ancelotti more concerned about French forward Antoine Griezmann, whose goals knocked Bayern out of Europe last May. ""He could play at any big club in Europe,"" said Ancelotti. Bayern smashed Russian side Rostov 5-0 in Munich in their opening Group D match, the same night Atletico won 1-0 at PSV Eindhoven. But the German team's players know they will be in for a much sterner challenge on Wednesday. ""It will be a difficult fight in Madrid and we have to at least get a few goals,"" said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm. Bayern defender Mats Hummels, who trained on Monday after limping out of Saturday's 1-0 win at Hamburg with a knee injury, says the Bundesliga leaders have a ""pretty tricky task against one of the top favourites to win the Champions League""."
372,20/09/2016,13:11,Simeone eyes long-awaited Barca win against 'the best',Diego Simeone has one of the few feats to elude his hugely successful spell in charge of Atletico Madrid in his sights on Wednesday by claiming a first win in nine attempts at Barcelona's Camp Nou.,"Simeone's biggest achievement as Atletico boss came in winning La Liga at Camp Nou with a 1-1 draw in 2014, but despite also dumping Barca out of the Champions League in two of the last three seasons, the Argentine has yet to taste victory in the Catalan capital. ""In almost all the games that we haven't been able to win it has been due to the merit of Barcelona. We have drawn a few games, but possibly we have never deserved to win based on the 90 minutes."" Atletico went ahead in both meetings between the sides at the Camp Nou last season before their quest was undone by early red cards for Filipe Luis and Diego Godin in a 2-1 La Liga defeat in January and for Fernando Torres as Barca won by the same score in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final in April. Barca's deadly front three of Luis Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar have proved too hot even for Atletico's watertight defence to handle, and Simeone insisted Barca remain the best team in Spain despite trailing early La Liga leaders Real Madrid by three points. ""The truth is yes (Barca are the best team). They continue to play brilliant football and have the players that most make the difference individually and collectively. Despite the fact they didn't win the Champions League last year, that puts them in an incredible place."" However, Atletico can call on a in-form, superstar forward of their own in Antoine Griezmann. Euro 2016's top scorer has scored four times in his last two La Liga games as Atletico have bounced back from draws against Alaves and Leganes to open their league campaign to thrash Celta Vigo and Sporting Gijon. And Simeone backed a campaign led by French sports daily L'Equipe on Tuesday for Griezmann to end Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo's dominance of the Ballon d'Or for the past eight years. ""Hopefully Antoine will be there because last year he had an enormous season. He has started strongly again this year,"" added Simeone. ""The other day he played as a second striker and ended up defending like a second defensive midfielder. ""He is a player that offers us that option and hopefully he maintains that ambition that allows him to aspire to more every day."""
373,16/09/2016,14:12,In-demand Simeone shortens Atletico contract,"Highly rated coach Diego Simeone said Friday he has shortened his contract with Atletico Madrid by two years until June 2018, a move likely to stir fresh speculation about his future.","The 46-year-old Argentine, who took Atletico to the Spanish league title in 2014 and the Champions League final last season, has been linked to many of Europe's top clubs, including Paris Saint-Germain, Arsenal and Inter Milan. In charge of Atletico since 2011, he had hinted at his possible departure after the Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid, saying he needed time to consider his options. Simeone signed a contract with Atletico in March 2015 that originally tied him to the club until June 2020. ""It is true, we have talked and we have taken the best decision for the club and the team,"" he told a news conference when asked about media reports that the club had agreed to reduce his contract by two years. ""We have taken this decision in conjunction with the club's directors and it doesn't alter the possibility of renewing terms again once the new arrangement ends."""

However, the two Spanish giants -- last season's Champions League finalists -- have announced they will launch a final appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). ""The FIFA Appeal Committee has decided to reject the appeals lodged by Spanish clubs Atletico de Madrid and Real Madrid and to confirm in their entirety the decisions rendered by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee in the respective cases relating to the protection of minors,"" FIFA said in a statement. Both clubs were sanctioned in January, but by appealing had temporarily held off the ban during the transfer window which closed last month. They will now not be able to register any new players in either of the next two windows, in January 2017 and July-August 2017, before being able to do so once again in January 2018. Barcelona served a similar ban in 2015, with an appeal to CAS proving unsuccessful in their case. European champions Real responded by saying they will now go to the CAS in an attempt to have the decision overturned ""as quickly as possible"". ""The club regrets the decision on the ground that it is profoundly unfair and contrary to the most elementary principles of penal law,"" read a statement posted on their website. ""The club will begin the appropriate appeals procedure before the Court of Arbitration for Sport, requesting that the decision be completely overturned, with absolute confidence that said organisation will come to an entirely favourable decision. ""Real Madrid will request that the procedure be undertaken in an urgent manner in order to obtain a decision from the CAS as quickly as possible."" Under international football rules, players under 18 cannot be transferred to another country, except in limited circumstances, and all transfers need the approval of a special FIFA committee. Atletico insisted they had such clearance from FIFA for the players under investigation. ""Our club does not agree with the ruling and therefore has decided to appeal before the Court of Arbitration for Sport,"" Atletico said in a statement. ""Our organisation wishes to state that one hundred percent of the licenses of our players who are part of this investigation and continue at the club have been regularised by FIFA itself, receiving authorisation from the sub-committee to process the license and compete in different (under-age) categories."" Atletico used the close-season window to make several new signings, including those of France striker Kevin Gameiro from Sevilla and Argentina midfielder Nicolas Gaitan from Benfica. Real had an unusually quiet summer in the transfer market, although they did bring Spain striker Alvaro Morata back to the club from Juventus for around 30 million euros ($34 million)."

He eclipses Wilfried Bony as Swansea's record signing. The Welsh club paid 12 million pounds to sign Bony from Vitesse Arnhem in 2013. ""There is pressure, but it is good pressure,"" Borja told the Swansea website. ""I want to repay the transfer fee paid for me with good performances and results. It's difficult to set a target of goals, but my mantra is take it goal by goal. Hopefully I can score a lot of goals. ""It is the most important decision of my career.

Defender Nick Ansell powerfully headed home off a free-kick from Tunisian Fahid Ben Khalfallah to rock Atletico in the 44th minute. While manager Diego Simeone rung the changes in the second half his side could not find a way through the determined Victory defence. Despite the defeat, he was pleased with the benefits of the trip to Australia. ""I'm very happy. These matches are very helpful for the guys who have played,"" said Simeone, who selected seven players from his club's academy in the Atletico starting lineup. ""I take from this many positive things. The youths are learning and this is the way to improve. ""Melbourne Victory is a well-worked team, strong and compact."" It has been a heady 10 days for the twice A-League champions, who beat Italian champions Juventus on penalties in the International Champions Cup last week before claiming another high-profile scalp in Atletico Madrid. Atletico Madrid, who lost this year's Champions League final on penalties to cross-city rivals Real Madrid, won their first match in Australia against England's Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 in Melbourne on Friday. There were several heavy challenges in Sunday's game with a solid tackle by Uruguayan defender Emiliano Velazquez forcing Victory's Mitch Austin off the field with a knee injury in the first half. French defender Lucas Hernandez also limped away after a sliding tackle on Victory midfielder Oliver Bozanic in the second half. Simeone made a triple substitution midway through the second half in an effort to recharge his team. But Melbourne counterpart Kevin Muscat took off most of his leading players among six substitutions at one stage, leaving Victory with a largely youth side against the Spaniards in the final stages. Atletico will return home on Tuesday and will next play Galatasaray in Turkey as part of their pre-season on August 6."

Gameiro will arrive in Madrid on Saturday afternoon to undergo a medical. The 29-year-old joined Sevilla from Paris Saint-Germain in 2013 and was part of the side that won three consecutive Europa League titles. Gameiro enjoyed the most prolific season of his career last term, scoring 29 goals in all competitions, including 10 in Europe, but missed out on selection for Dider Deschamps' France Euro 2016 squad. Atletico coach Diego Simeone had been looking to strengthen his forward line, as Griezmann and Fernando Torres have been sharing the bulk of the striking duties. Argentinian Simeone had also added former Benfica winger Nicolas Gaitan and Croatian defender Sime Vrsaljko to his squad this summer. Atletico will be hoping to push on in the coming season, after narrowly missing out on both the Champions League and La Liga titles last campaign. They finished third behind Real Madrid and champions Barcelona in the league, and lost the Champions League final to city rivals Real on penalties."

""Thomas is on his way to becoming a top footballer and I hope to help him achieve that goal,"" Simeone said of the 22-year-old central midfielder. ""He is developing as a footballer all the time and, although young, has strength, movement and can play between the lines."" In the hyper-competitive Spanish La Liga, Partey made 13 appearances last season for third-place Atletico, including three starts.

Ghana are among 10 nations who could secure places at the 2017 finals after four days of qualifying, which start Thursday in the Seychelles. The Black Stars have destiny in their own hands, as do Algeria, Cameroon, record seven-time Cup of Nations winners Egypt and Senegal. Victories will place Cameroon and Ghana in unassailable positions while Algeria, Egypt and Senegal need draws to move beyond the reach of rivals. Cameroon, who took Euro 2016 hosts France to the wire Monday before losing a friendly 3-2 in Nantes, have dropped captain Stephane Mbia for an away clash with Mauritania. Algeria play Seychelles without injured midfield stars Riyad Mahrez, a key figure in the sensational English Premier League title triumph of Leicester City, and Yacine Brahimi.

Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali and Zimbabwe could also secure qualification if they win and get some help from rivals. Minnows Guinea-Bissau can book a first appearance at the biennial African football showpiece if they win at home against Zambia and Congo Brazzaville lose in Kenya. Zimbabwe can return to the big time after a 10-year absence provided they defeat visiting Malawi and regular Cup of Nations qualifiers Guinea do not win in Swaziland. Among those set to start for Zimbabwe will be midfielder Khama Billiat, who was voted South African Footballer of the Season this week after helping Mamelodi Sundowns become champions."

""Do I have to continue with Atletico or is it the end of a cycle? I have to think about that,"" Simeone mysteriously said. Simeone's side were beaten by Real after extra time in Lisbon in 2014, and they pushed their city rivals even further but to no avail at the San Siro. Captain Sergio Ramos, as he did with a late equaliser two years ago, scored for Real, but Atletico hit back through substitute Yannick Carrasco despite a missed penalty from Antoine Griezmann. But Cristiano Ronaldo struck the winning spot-kick after Juanfran's effort had come back off the post. ""It puts a lot of years on you,"" said Simeone. ""Congratulations to Real Madrid -- once again they were superior to us, this time at penalties. ""We started the game badly, then we got ourselves organised from the 20th minute. In the second half we could have equalised very quickly but our intention was clear.

Ronaldo scored the winning penalty just after Juanfran had missed for Atletico in Milan's San Siro stadium where the game finished 1-1 after extra-time. Real won 5-3 on penalties. Atletico's Yannick Carrasco had scored a 79th minute equaliser after Sergio Ramos opened the scoring for Real on 15 minutes. French legend Zinedine Zidane became only the seventh man to win Europe's premier club competition both as a player and coach. He was previously assistant to Carlo Ancelotti -- another of the seven -- two years ago when Real also beat Atletico in the final. ""It's huge! Ancelotti told me he hoped I'd be able to lift (the trophy) as a head coach,"" Zidane told beIN Sport. ""He was right, it's a massive joy. I'm empty, but it's all positive. ""When you achieve what we've achieved all season it means you've done well, that the messages have got through, that the players have followed me, that I've followed them and that's how we've managed to win this Champions League."" Real's Brazilian full-back Danilo paid tribute to Zidane: ""We've learnt everything with him and he created a real group. At Real Madrid we never accept that we're beaten."" Many players ended the game suffering with cramp. ""It's difficult, it's the end of the season, people are not fit any more so we have to rest now and do it for European Championship,"" said Ronaldo. Wales winger Gareth Bale overcame cramp to score his spot-kick for Real. ""I can't feel a lot to be honest, I'm cramping up. What an amazing feeling,"" he said. ""It was difficult, in extra-time a lot of people were getting cramp. We showed resilience and what we're made of. ""I had cramp afterwards, thank god it wasn't before. It's an amazing feeling, I can't describe what it feels like. ""The boys gave everything. The club, the fans have been amazing on this journey -- we deserve it."" And he said beating their bitter city rivals in the final again for the second time in three years was extra special. ""That's the most important thing. Obviously they gave a great game, I'm obviously feeling a bit sorry for them but a final's a final and you have to win."" Real's French striker Karim Benzema, who has not been picked for France's Euro 2016 squad, suggested this result would make up for his personal disappointment. ""It's great! This season has been very difficult but we fought to the end,"" said Benzema. ""We showed we're a real team and we've entered into history. I'm happy and proud. ""We're here to win titles and go through nights like this."""

390,28/05/2016,10:43,"Milan readies for glitzy, all-Spanish Champions League final",Milan's San Siro stadium is preparing for a glitzy all-Spanish final of the Champions League final on Saturday as fans of Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid packed the city in glorious summer sunshine.,"Record ten-time champions Real, who won the inaugural trophy in 1956, are gunning for their 11th title from European football's premier club event two years after a stunning comeback victory over Atletico in Lisbon secured 'La Decima'. Cristiano Ronaldo has given Real fans a huge boost with the news he is 100% fit following a training ground scare on Tuesday and coach Zinedine Zidane is counting on the Portuguese superstar to rise to the occasion. ""He's 100 percent fit and he's playing a Champions League final, when you transcend yourself,"" said Zidane, appearing in a first Champions League final as a coach after succeeding Rafael Benitez at the helm earlier this season. Zidane, who won the trophy as a player with Real in 2002, is seeking to emulate Italian Carlo Ancelotti in steering Real to victory, in what is the Frenchman's first season in charge at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium, two years after a stunning comeback win over Atletico in Lisbon. ""We've had two weeks to prepare and now what the players want is for the ball to start rolling,"" said ZIdane. It is the fourth time the final of Europe's premier club event will to be held at the San Siro, and the first since Bayern Munich beat Valencia in 2001. Even before kick-off, a slice of Champions League history will be made. R&amp;B star Alicia Keys will become the first artist to perform live at the final during a glitzy, nine-minute opening ceremony that will feature 400 dancers and be capped by Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli singing the competition's anthem. Atletico, however, are the ones hoping to be singing and dancing in the streets of Milan later Saturday as the 'Rojiblancos' go in search of a maiden trophy. Coached by former Argentina international Diego Simeone, Atletico have won the Europa League -- European football's second-tier competition -- twice in recent years (2010, 2012) and threatened the decades-long dominance of Real and Barcelona in 'La Liga', which they won in 2014 to add to a Spanish Cup victory in 2013. Two years after Real's shock comeback win in Lisbon, Simeone is ready to end a 113-year wait to be crowned kings of Europe. ""I like to have 113 years of history on my back. I love the pressure,"" said Simeone, who will be hoping seven-goal striker Antoine Griezmann or Fernando Torres continue their fine form in the competition. Torres -- a Champions League winner with Chelsea in 2012 -- said he's ready to give it everything. ""There's no doubt, it's the most important game I am ever going to play,"" said Torres, who returned to his childhood club in 2014 following an ill-fated spell in Serie A with AC Milan. ""With Chelsea and the Spanish national team I've won a lot of titles, but this is really special for me. To me it means everything. It's the game of my life."""
391,27/05/2016,16:27,Torres ready to eclipse Chelsea title feat,Fernando Torres is dreaming of eclipsing his Champions League triumph with Chelsea and making history for the second time in the competition by leading Atletico Madrid to victory over Real Madrid on Saturday.,"Torres won the elite European title with the London side in 2012 when they beat Bayern Munich 4-3 on penalties to add their name to the trophy for the first time. But on that occasion the Spanish marksman played only a bit part, and it wasn't with the club where he spent his entire childhood. Torres came through the ranks of Atletico, spending seven seasons in La Liga before signing for Liverpool in 2007, then Chelsea three years later. The 32-year-old returns to familiar ground having spent an ill-fated loan spell with AC Milan in Serie A two seasons ago. Although it was his ""hard work"" that got him here, Torres admits he owes a debt to coach Diego Simeone. ""The club and Simeone gave me a chance to come back to my childhood club. It's been hard,"" said Torres. Kept on the bench by then Chelsea coach Roberto Di Matteo for the 2012 final, Torres only appeared six minutes from the end when he replaced Salomon Kalou and did not take any of Chelsea's penalties on the way to their spot-kick victory. Now considered one of Atletico's veterans, Torres put his situation into perspective when he said: ""Koke and Saul (Niguez) were only kids at the club when I was playing for Atletico's first team."" Although he has scored only one of Atletico's 14 goals in the competition this season, as opposed to the seven-goal haul of French teammate Antoine Griezmann, Torres has been hugely influential. Four years on from Munich, Torres is ready to do it all again -- although this time the Spaniard is expected to start. ""There's no doubt, it's the most important game I am ever going to play,"" added Torres. ""With Chelsea and the Spanish national team I've won a lot of titles, but this is really special for me. To me, it means everything. It's the game of my life. ""To me it means everything. I've played for great teams... this one is special, it's different. It's maybe the biggest thing I dreamt of as a kid."" He added: ""Obviously I know this stadium and I have many friends here. I'm sure tomorrow they will be behind Atletico Madrid. ""Let's hope the fans get behind us here tomorrow and create a magical night for us."""
392,27/05/2016,14:11,Simeone shouldering history as Torres awaits 'game of my life',"Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone is ready to shoulder ""113 years of history"" ahead of a Champions League final with Real Madrid that striker Fernando Torres has labelled the ""game of my life"".","Record ten-time champions Real are the hosts at the San Siro stadium in Milan on Saturday when Atletico will seek to avenge their stunning defeat to their bitter city rivals in a pulsating 2014 final in Lisbon. Real have beaten Atletico only once in their 10 meetings since, meaning there is huge expectation on Atletico to show they can also beat the competition's most successful club when it matters most. But Simeone says he won't be shying away from the challenge. ""I like to have 113 years of history on my back. I love the pressure, I love it,"" he told media at the San Siro ground traditionally shared by Serie A giants AC Milan and Inter Milan. ""To play a final is fantastic. To win it, there's nothing better."" Atletico were a whisker away from being crowned champions of Europe for the first time two years ago, until Sergio Ramos's 93rd minute header pushed the final into extra-time. Atletico crumbled and Real prevailed 4-1 to claim 'La Decima' -- stretching their record to 10 titles. Torres -- a Champions League winner with Chelsea in 2012 -- said he's ready to give it everything. ""There's no doubt, it's the most important game I am ever going to play,"" said Torres, who returned to his childhood club in 2014 following an ill-fated spell in Serie A with AC Milan. ""With Chelsea and the Spanish national team I've won a lot of titles, but this is really special for me. To me it means everything. It's the game of my life."" Atletico and Real made history in 2014 by becoming the first clubs from the same city to feature in the Champions League final. But Torres said they want to write a new page in the competition's history books. ""Real Madrid is a great club, one of the best. We share the same city and we know what this means,"" he said. ""But we can't sit back and think of what we've achieved already... this is a big opportunity for us to create history and we want to go out and write a new chapter."" Captain Gabi said: ""We lost the final but it built pride among the players. Now we have a fresh chance, but no one's gifted us anything. We had to work hard to get here."" Simeone's men go into the final boasting 35 clean sheets in 56 games this season, including shutouts at home to Barcelona and Bayern Munich when they were dumped out of the competition in the quarters and semis respectively. Yet the Argentinian hailed the ""great work"" of Real coach Zinedine Zidane, and pinpointed Brazilian midfielder Casemiro as the danger man. ""He (Zidane) has done some amazing work,"" said Simeone. ""He's notably made the decision to rely a lot on Casemiro, which has changed the team."" Asked if he was Real's most important player, Simeone added: ""For the balance of Real Madrid, yes."" Real's other danger man, however, is likely to be Cristiano Ronaldo, who has the chance to match and surpass his own record of scoring 17 Champions League goals in a season. But Gabi believes Atletico have the tools to master what will be their toughest ""game in three years"". ""Madrid always play these games at a very high level. It's going to be our toughest game in three years,"" he said. ""But there's nothing better than winning a Champions League title against one of the best."""
393,27/05/2016,01:30,"Eyes on 11th Champions League crown, insists Ronaldo",Cristiano Ronaldo insists personal goals will be put to one side as Real Madrid seek to embellish their incredible European record with victory over Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final on Saturday.,"Ronaldo, a three-time world player of the year, has never scored a goal at the San Siro but has the chance to match and surpass his own record of scoring 17 Champions League goals in a season. Yet two years after Real defender Sergio Ramos levelled at the death to inspire a stunning, extra-time comeback and secure a 10th triumph in Lisbon, the Portuguese superstar insists winning an 11th crown is far more important than who hits the net at the San Siro. ""It would be nice to equal or even pass the (scoring) record, but I am not obsessed with that because the most important thing is to win,"" Ronaldo said when asked about adding to his 16-goal tally in the competition this season. Victory would see Real Madrid embellish their reputation as the most successful club in Europe having won the inaugural edition, the European Champions Clubs' Cup, in 1956 when Argentinian Hector Rial struck the winner in a 4-3 victory over fallen French giants Stade Reims in Paris. Atletico's achievements may pale in comparison, but the threat from Diego Simeone's men, who have restricted Real to only one win in their past 10 meetings since the 2014 final, is real. Before winning two Europa League titles in 2010 and 2012, the 'Rojiblancos' last continental trophy was the now defunct European Cup Winners' Cup in 1962. Yet only two years after Lisbon, Simeone's men are back having stunned Barcelona in the quarter-finals, and ended the hopes of the Catalan giants' former coach Pep Guardiola when they ousted his Bayern Munich side on away goals in the semi-finals. Real fans may have the history, but Zinedine Zindane's men have beaten Atletico only once in 10 meetings since their 4-1 victory in Lisbon two years ago. Unsurprisingly, Simeone is bullish ahead of a clash that Ronaldo says will settle which side rules the roost in the Spanish capital. ""We've already played two of the top three teams in the world and now we're facing the third in the final,"" Simeone told UEFA.com. He believes the key to beating Real will be breaking down a solid defence and making sure his players remain vigilant at set-pieces. ""Madrid are different to Barcelona and Bayern; they're a much more direct team who are a massive threat from set pieces. ""We'll be ready and will look to play the game on our terms. Fingers crossed, that will be enough for us to do what we want, which is to win."" Whoever wins, says Ronaldo, will earn the local bragging rights: ""We will see who is the best. I am positive. I think Real are better than Atletico, but we have to show it on the pitch."" But Real have plenty of reason to be wary. Two years ago, Atletico were a whisker away from avenging their European Cup final defeat to Bayern Munich in 1974 (4-0) after Diego Godin gave Simeon's men a 36th minute opener. Ramos's 93rd minute leveller, however, pushed the match into extra time and, with the fresh momentum, Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Ronaldo, from the spot, struck to compound Atletico's misery. Now, it is Ronaldo, Bale and French striker Karim Benzema who could have their work cut out, while Ramos and Pepe, Zidane's preferred centre-back partnership, will be wary of a repeat of recent history. Atletico have recorded 35 clean sheets in 56 games this season, including shutouts at home to Barcelona and Bayern Munich when they were dumped out of the competition. They also managed a 1-0 win at Real's Santiago Bernabeu to inflict Zidane's only La Liga defeat in four months in charge when the sides last met in February. Ronaldo, who suffered an injury scare in recen days, admitted: ""Atletico always play the same way. We know there will be very few opportunities because they all play behind the ball. ""It is no coincidence that Barca and Bayern couldn't score many goals against them."""
394,26/05/2016,15:37,Five key Champions League final clashes,Real Madrid face local rivals Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final for the second time in three years at Milan's San Siro on Saturday.,"Atletico are aiming to win the competition for the first time after losing out 4-1 to Real after extra-time in the final in Lisbon two years ago. By contrast, Real are already the most successful side in Champions League history as 10-time winners. Here, AFP sports looks at five key clashes that could decide the outcome. - Cristiano Ronaldo v Juanfran Three-time World Player of the Year Ronaldo is looking to match his own record of 17 goals in a single Champions League season, which he set with Real's fourth from the penalty spot in the final two years ago before famously tearing off his shirt to show off his toned torso. Atletico right-back Juanfran's understated nature couldn't be more different. However, his consistently solid defensive displays have seen the former Real player seal his place in Spain's Euro 2016 squad and keep Ronaldo quiet in recent Madrid derbies. The Portuguese has scored just twice as Real have won just one of the last 10 matches between the sides. - Sergio Ramos v Antoine Griezmann Ramos broke Atletico hearts two years ago as it was his stoppage time header that sent the game into extra-time, with Los Rojiblancos just seconds away from victory. Real's captain has had a poor season by his standards as he has often been bothered by a shoulder injury, but has returned to form in a 10-game unbeaten run since early April. Griezmann is Atletico's major goal threat. The Frenchman has scored 32 times this season, including a double to knock out holders Barcelona in the quarter-finals and the all-important away goal that sealed Atletico's place in the final against Bayern Munich in the semis. Moreover, Griezmann also scored the winner the last time these two sides met in February. - Luka Modric v Koke The stars at both ends of the field will be dependant on midfield maestros Modric and Koke to provide them with the service necessary to make the difference. Modric's ability to control the game with his range of passing has made him arguably Real's most consistent performer this season. Koke's phenomenal work rate has seen him run more per match than any other player in the Champions League this season at well over 12km (7.5 miles) per game. However, the Spanish international also adds a touch of class to Atletico's midfield and has 17 assists this season. - Karim Benzema v Diego Godin The secret to Atletico's success in Diego Simeone's five seasons in charge has been a rock-solid defence led by Uruguayan warrior Godin. Thanks to Godin's discipline and organisation, Atletico have already kept 35 clean sheets this season, including eight in their 12 Champions League games and five in their last nine outings against Real. Benzema had his best ever goalscoring season in La Liga with 24 in 27 games, but is still to register for Real in a final and has scored just three times in 22 appearances against Atletico. - Gareth Bale v Filipe Luis Bale is in the best form of his Real career three years after joining for a world record fee and has been the man for the big occasion since moving to the Spanish capital, scoring against Atletico in the final two years ago and in the 2014 Copa del Rey and Club World Cup finals. However, that is Bale's only goal against Atletico and his glory moment in Lisbon only came after Luis went off injured. The Brazilian briefly left Atletico after Lisbon for Chelsea only to rejoin at the start of this season and has kept Bale in check whenever he has been faced by the Welshman."
395,25/05/2016,19:36,Ronaldo wants extended Real stay,Three-time World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo has stressed his desire to remain at Spanish giants Real Madrid beyond the end of his current contract in 2018.,"""It is clear I want to stay here, I want to continue here,"" he told Spanish television station La Sexta on Wednesday. Ronaldo has been an astonishing success at Real since joining for a then world record £80m ($116 million) from Manchester United in 2009. The Portuguese has broken the club's all-time goalscoring record with 364 goals in 347 games on route to being crowned as the world's best player in 2013 and 2014. However, with two years left on his current deal, the 31-year-old has been continuously rumoured with a move to free-spending French champions Paris Saint-Germain or a return to United. ""They can forget everyone else because Real Madrid are the best. It is easy,"" added Ronaldo. ""There have been good moments and bad moments...that is life. ""Now I am happy and I want to continue being at this club because I don't see any club that is better than Real Madrid. ""If you weigh everything up, there is no one better."" Spanish radio station Cadena SER reported a new deal for Ronaldo could be announced as early as next week after Real take on Atletico Madrid in Saturday's Champions League final. ""It is better that (club president) Florentino Perez says it,"" continued Ronaldo. ""I think it would be an intelligent move from Real Madrid."""
396,25/05/2016,15:21,Ronaldo trains ahead of Champions League final,Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo alleviated concerns over his fitness ahead of Saturday's Champions League final against Atletico Madrid as the three-time World Player of the Year returned to training on Wednesday.,Ronaldo limped off towards the end of training on Tuesday after suffering a knock on a persistent left thigh problem. Real's all-time record scorer missed three games last month due to injury and was also left out a practice match on Saturday by coach Zinedine Zidane as a precaution. Ronaldo is aiming to break his own record of 17 Champions League goals in a season in Milan having already netted 16 in the competition so far this campaign. The Portuguese set his record mark with a goal from the penalty spot as Real beat Atletico 4-1 after extra-time in Lisbon two years ago in the only other final between two sides from the same city.
397,24/05/2016,16:30,Champions League final goal like losing virginity - Ramos,"Hero of Real Madrid's Champions League triumph two years ago, defender Sergio Ramos compared his first final experience to losing his virginity ahead Saturday's clash with Atletico Madrid in a rematch of the 2014 final.","Ramos broke Atletico's hearts with his stoppage time equaliser to deny Diego Simeone's men a first ever European Cup before a rampant Real ran out 4-1 winners after extra-time. ""The first time is like when you make love, you always remember it, but after it is true you can improve,"" said the Spanish international on Tuesday. ""The first one has a special taste because I was the protagonist with a great goal, but I am optimistic and ambitious. ""I like to turn the page and continue filling my honours list. Hopefully I'll have the good fortune to lift (the Champions League) again."" Atletico have bounced back from the blow at Lisbon with just one defeat in the subsequent 10 Madrid derbies since. However, that also saw Real get the upper hand in last season's Champions League quarter-final tie between the two as another late strike from Javier Hernandez sent Los Blancos into the last four. ""We are very clear in the ideas we have, in what we want to do and how to approach this game,"" added Ramos. ""We know the opponent very well. We know the team we will have in front of us and, unless perhaps they have changed their style and philosophy, it is Atletico Madrid. ""We know it will be a very competitive, hard game against a side that plays with a lot of intensity and character."""
398,24/05/2016,14:09,Ronaldo confident of Champions League glory despite injury scare,Cristiano Ronaldo played down fears over his fitness ahead of Real Madrid's Champions League final against Atletico Madrid on Saturday after the three-time World Player of the Year limped off towards the end of training on Tuesday.,"""I am fine. I had a little problem in training, a dead leg as they say here, but tomorrow or the next day I will be fine,"" he said. Ronaldo will be aiming to break his own record of 17 Champions League goals in a season in Milan having already netted 16 in the competition so far this campaign. His 17th two years ago came in the final against Atletico as Real ran out 4-1 winners after extra-time. ""It would be nice to equal or even pass the record, but I am not obsessed with that because the most important thing is to win,"" he added. And Ronaldo insisted Real will show they are the kings of the Spanish capital once more despite winning just once in 10 games against Atletico since lifting their 10th European Cup in Lisbon. ""We will see who is the best. I am positive. I think Real are better than Atletico, but we have to show it on the pitch."" To do so Real must break down a rock solid Atletico defence that has kept 35 clean sheets in 56 games this season, including shutouts at home to Barcelona and Bayern Munich in dumping the Spanish and German champions out at the quarter-final and semi-final stages respectively. Atletico also managed a 1-0 win at Real's Santiago Bernabeu to inflict Real coach Zinedine Zidane's only La Liga defeat in four months in charge when the sides last met in February. ""Atletico always play the same way. We know there will be very few opportunities because they all play behind the ball,"" continued Ronaldo. ""It is no coincidence that Barca and Bayern couldn't score many goals against them."" Ronaldo has been dogged by a persistent thigh injury which forced him to miss three games last month. He also came off at half-time of Real's final La Liga game of the season -- having scored twice in the first-half to take his tally for the season to 51 -- at Deportivo la Coruna 10 days ago. Zidane confirmed Ronaldo also didn't play in a practice match on Saturday as a precaution, but expects him to be fully fit for the final. ""There will be no problem. He felt something on Saturday when we had a game between us and he didn't play as a precaution,"" said Zidane. ""He will be ready for Saturday and I think we are in good shape physically."" However, there isn't such good news for French defender Raphael Varane as Zidane confirmed he will miss Saturday's final and his participation at Euro 2016 is now in jeopardy due to a hamstring injury. Varane was unlikely to start at the San Siro in any case with captain Sergio Ramos and Pepe Zidane's preferred central defensive partnership. An 11th European Cup would cap a sensational start to Zidane's senior management career having turned around Real's fortunes with 21 wins from 26 games since replacing the sacked Rafael Benitez in January. ""I think everybody feels the fun comes back a little bit when he arrived,"" said Real midfielder Toni Kroos. However, the Frenchman -- who won the Champions League for Madrid with a sensational volleyed winner in the 2002 final --- insisted he still has a lot to learn as a coach. ""I have a lot to learn, the desire I have to learn is tremendous and I am convinced I am going to improve,"" said Zidane. ""I have a lot to do to be a good and important coach in football."" And Zidane rejected Ronaldo's assertion that Atletico's success in reaching a second Champions League final in three years is solely due to their defensive record. ""It will be a difficult game because we are playing against a team that doesn't just defend well. ""Everyone talks about them defending well, but they are a complete team. They can also cause you problems playing with the ball."""
399,23/05/2016,19:33,Atletico buy French second division side Lens,Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid on Monday completed the takeover of bankrupt French second division side Lens through a Luxembourg company.,"""We hope to bring in Atletico's expertise,"" said Ignacio Aguillo, a member of the Spanish side's board, told a press conference after a French commercial court approved the takeover. Atletico will have a direct 35% stake in Lens, while Aguillo is a major shareholder in Solferino, a Luxembourg company that will have the remaining 65%. Lens, known as the ""blood and gold"" because of their shirt colours, won the French championship in 1998 but have become embroiled in financial controversy in recent years. Relegated in 2011, Lens won a promotion place back to Ligue 1 in 2014 but this was blocked by the French league because of budget irregularities. The sanction was overturned in one appeal but the promotion was later ruled definitively invalid. Lens stadium has been refurbished for the European Championship finals -- England will play their key group game against Wales there -- but Lens will be the only second division host of Euro 2016. Promotion is ""a clear objective,"" Aguillo said. ""We will respect the identity of the club,"" added the Spanish businessman, who said the new owners had a ""long term ambition"" for Lens. Aguillo is a partner in the Solferino company with French businessman, Gilles Fretigne, chief financial officer for the European operations of Amber Capital, a US hedge fund. The Spanish businessman said the takeover still needs the approval of the Atletico shareholders and there would be a general assembly in June. Facing debts of 12 million euros ($13.5m), Lens president Gervais Martel, who will remain in charge, put the club under the control of a bankruptcy court to force an accelerated sale. Lens had previously been controlled by Azerbaijani businessman Hafiz Mammadov who rescued Lens in 2013 with 20 million euros of his own money but failed to provide promised new investment."
400,21/05/2016,10:49,Griezmann one of the world's top three - Simeone,"Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone hailed star forward Antoine Griezmann as ""one of the best three players in the world"" as Atletico prepare to face local rivals Real Madrid in next Saturday's Champions League final.","Griezmann has enjoyed his best ever goal-scoring season with 32 goals in all competitions. However, the French international has been particularly effective in the Champions League as his double against Barcelona in the quarter-finals and vital away goal at Bayern Munich in the last four allowed Atletico to upset the odds and reach a second final in three seasons. ""He has worked very hard, pushed himself and knows how to listen,"" Simeone said on Saturday. ""The best way to improve in any job is to listen. Without doubt he is one of the best three players in the world."" The majority of the stars will be on Real's side as Atletico aim to avenge their defeat in agonising fashion in the final two years ago by winning the competition for the first time in Milan next weekend. Simeone's men were on course for victory in Lisbon until Sergio Ramos headed Real level deep into injury time and Los Blancos ran out 4-1 winners after extra-time. Yet, despite the presence of three-time World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo, the world's most expensive player in Gareth Bale and the likes of Karim Benzema and Luka Modric, Simeone expects the Real to play on the counter-attack. ""In the Champions League that is clearly the route they have chosen,"" added Simeone. ""I expect an opponent that will wait for their opportunity. The presence of Casemiro in midfield has given them a lot of power defensively and in the Champions League they have played on the counter-attack."" Real's route to the final has been a much easier one on paper than Atletico's treacherous course past Dutch champions PSV before dumping out Barca and Bayern. Los Blancos brushed aside Roma before squeezing past Wolfsburg and Manchester City. However, Simeone also reserved praise for how Zinedine Zidane has revived Real's fortunes since taking over as coach from the sacked Rafael Benitez in January. ""He has recovered the confidence, intensity and the speed of their attack,"" added the Argentine. ""He has a more concrete style to make the most of the three strikers. ""To get to a Champions League final is an important demonstration of his work."""

The 35-year-old, formerly of Chelsea, Lyon and Juventus, will hope to help Atletico to a first Champions League title in next Saturday's final against Real Madrid and avenge their 2014 defeat to their city rivals. However, Tiago has been omitted from Portugal's 23-man squad for Euro 2016 next month with coach Fernando Santos opting not to risk him after an injury-plagued campaign."

That strike was one of nine goals in 47 appearances in all competitions this season. And Niguez's fine form was also rewarded with a call-up to Vicente del Bosque's provisional 25-man Spain squad for Euro 2016 on Tuesday despite being uncapped at full international level. The new deal only extends Niguez's contract by one year, but a significant wage rise is hoped to ward off interest from Premier League clubs with Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur reportedly interested. ""We are all very happy with the agreement reached with Saul,"" said Atletico sporting director Jose Luis Caminero. ""He is an excellent footballer, who has been brought through our academy and reinforces our decision to bring through our own players. ""He is in great form, but he can still improve a lot because he has enormous potential."""
404,18/05/2016,13:30,Fears raised over Champions League final pitch,A senior UEFA executive on Wednesday raised concerns about the quality of the Champions League final pitch just 10 days ahead of Europe's biggest club match of the season.,"Keith Dalton, senior match operations manager with UEFA, said organisers face ""a lot of challenges"" in getting the surface ready at Milan's San Siro stadium for the game on May 28 between Spanish rivals Real and Atletico Madrid. ""We are facing a lot of challenges to get this pitch up to the level it needs to be for the Champions League final,"" Dalton said in a speech at the World Stadium Congress conference being held in Doha. ""The grounds keeper, with all due respect to him, is very junior and he is the only one with the technical expertise operating that stadium. ""The rest of the guys can just hold a fork."" Afterwards, Dalton, whose speech outlined UEFA's requirements for Champions League matches and also European Championship games, added that he was sure the pitch would be ready but UEFA wanted it to be perfect for the final. The Champions League final is the high point of the European club season, arguably the most high-profile annual football game in the world and is expected to draw in a crowd of some 300 million television viewers. Previous concerns about a pitch prior to a Champions League final included worries surrounding the 2008 final in Moscow between English sides Manchester United and Chelsea, which was played on a new grass surface laid on top of an artificial playing area. However, there were no repercussions after the final which United won on penalties. The game later this month between the two Spanish clubs is the fourth Champions League or European Cup final to be held at the 80,000-capacity San Siro. The last final to be played at the famous Italian venue was between Bayern Munich and Valencia, in 2001, which the German side won on penalties 5-4 after the sides played out a 1-1 draw. The May 28 clash will be the second final between the two Madrid rivals. They met previously in 2014 when Real Madrid won 4-1 after extra time to secure the club's record tenth title in the competition. That was the first and -- so far -- only time two teams from the same city had contested a Champions League final. The game will be Real's 14th final and Atletico's third. Atletico are yet to win the trophy. The Madrid sides finished second and third in this year's La Liga, with Real Madrid claiming the runners-up position behind Barcelona."
405,08/05/2016,21:20,Simeone proud despite end of Atletico's title charge,"Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone said he was proud of his side's title challenge, despite a 2-1 defeat to already-relegated Levante on Sunday ending their hopes of winning La Liga.","Fernando Torres had given Atletico the perfect start with the opening goal inside two minutes. However, Simeone's men seemed to suffer from the aftereffects of sealing their place in the Champions League final against Bayern Munich in midweek, as goals from Victor Casadesus and former Manchester United forward Giuseppe Rossi mathematically ended Atletico's title chances with just one game remaining. ""There aren't any excuses. We are ending a fantastic season and we are one game away from competing with Barcelona and Real Madrid,"" said Simeone. ""That makes me happy because in other years we were out of it with 10 games remaining. ""We were a little bit short. I am hurting to fall at the penultimate hurdle, but I am delighted to have been fighting until now for the championship. I am so proud of what we have done."" Simeone was made to pay for leaving top scorer Antoine Griezmann and inspirational defender Diego Godin on the bench with one eye possibly on Atletico's clash with Real in the Champions League final later this month. However, he also lauded Levante's performance just six days after their relegation to the second division was confirmed. ""What Levante have done is enormously noble. They have gone down and they fought until the end,"" added Simeone. ""That is what makes football great that a team can come from playing in the semi-finals of the Champions League and lose."""
406,08/05/2016,19:13,"Five-star Barca edge towards title, Atletico beaten","Barcelona are one win away from retaining their La Liga title after Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar all scored as they thrashed Espanyol 5-0 in the Catalan derby on Sunday.","Real Madrid moved into second place, a point behind Barca with one game remaining, as they racked up an 11th straight La Liga win, 3-2 over Valencia, thanks to two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo. However, Atletico Madrid's title hopes are over as they lost 2-1 at already relegated Levante. Barca will be champions with victory at Granada next weekend, who crucially are now mathematically safe from relegation after a 4-1 win at Sevilla. Real Madrid travel to Deportivo la Coruna on the final day of the season. Elsewhere, Sporting Gijon remain out of the relegation zone thanks to their superior head-to-head record with Getafe after the two drew 1-1. Rayo Vallecano also remain in the bottom three after losing 2-1 at Real Sociedad. Barca were out to avoid a repeat of their title collapse in 2007 when a last-minute equaliser from Espanyol at the Camp Nou on the penultimate day of the season handed Real the title. The world club champions got off to a perfect start when Messi curled a delightful free-kick into the top corner. Ivan Rakitic had a second ruled out for offside minutes later as Barca tried to kill the game off as early as possible. However, they had to wait until seven minutes into the second half for the second as Messi teed up Suarez to fire high past Pau Lopez. Suarez maintained his four-goal lead over Ronaldo as the league's top scorer as he powered home his 56th goal of the season from Neymar's corner. A howler from Lopez handed Rafinha an open goal to tap home his first goal since suffering a serious knee injury at the start of the season, before Neymar rounded off the scoring. Madrid shrugged off the absences of Gareth Bale and Luka Modric through injury to move above Atletico for the first time in 2016 with victory over Valencia. Ronaldo missed a huge chance to open the scoring when he fired too close to Diego Alves, but the three-time World Player of the Year made amends with his next opportunity moments later when he fired into the far corner for his 48th goal of the season. Valencia felt hard done by for Madrid's second three minutes before half-time as the referee overruled his linesman, who had flagged Karim Benzema offside, before he slotted home as the ball through to the French striker deflected off Valencia defender Joao Cancelo. The visitors' bright start to the second period was rewarded when Rodrigo pounced on an error from Raphael Varane to halve the deficit. Ronaldo quickly restored Real's two-goal advantage, but Andre Gomes ensured a nervy finish when he smashed home from the edge of the box before Valencia were reduced to 10 men late on when Rodrigo was shown a straight red card. Atletico paid for their exertions in setting up a second all-Madrid Champions League final against Bayern Munich in midweek, despite getting off to a brilliant start when Fernando Torres opened the scoring from Koke's pass after two minutes. Diego Simeone had left inspirational central defender Diego Godin and top scorer Antoine Griezmann on the bench and was made to pay when Victor Casadesus headed Levante level on the half hour mark. Griezmann was introduced for the second half and came closest to finding a winner for Atletico when Diego Marino turned his near post effort wide 15 minutes from time. But Giuseppe Rossi finished off a sweeping Levante counter-attack in the final minute to end Atletico's hopes of an unlikely second title in three years."
407,07/05/2016,14:30,"La Liga, not old Espanyol ghosts on the line - Luis Enrique",Barcelona coach Luis Enrique insisted his side won't be distracted by local rivals Espanyol's desire to destroy their La Liga title chances in the Catalan derby on Sunday.,"Luis Enrique's men hold the slenderest of advantages in the title race with two games remaining as they lead Atletico Madrid thanks to their better head-to-head record while Real Madrid lie a point behind in third. In eerily similar circumstances Barca were embroiled in a three-way title race with Sevilla and Real when Espanyol travelled to the Camp Nou on the penultimate day of the season nine years ago. Then, a last-minute equaliser from Raul Tamudo, which came to be known as the ""Tamudazo"", snatched the title from Barca's grasp and allowed Real to be crowned champions the following weekend. ""The Tamudazo doesn't interest me at all. I don't remember what happened four weeks ago let alone nine years,"" Luis Enrique said on Saturday. ""I am only worried about being better than Espanyol. ""They are different games. It is a derby where the league is in play so it is even more transcendental. ""It is our last game at home and we have to go for it from the off."" Barca's once commanding nine-point lead was whittled down due to three consecutive league defeats last month. However, they have scored 16 goals without reply in winning their last three matches and the coach believes his side have shown the character needed to turn the situation around and retain their title. ""I don't see there being a delicate situation here. The only thing is that we have lost our advantage. ""In the lst three games we have won 8-0, 6-0 and 2-0. We have lost the advantage because our rivals keep winning, but the league is won in 38 games not in 30, nor in 10."" Indeed, Barca could even be proclaimed champions on Sunday if they win, Atletico lose at already relegated Levante and Real drop points at home to Valencia. Both Atletico and Real booked their places in the Champions League final in midweek and Luis Enrique is hoping for a European hangover for the sides from the Spanish capital to avoid Barca needing to win at a Granada side fighting for their lives next weekend. ""Tomorrow we have the chance to be champions. Why not? We are the only ones with that possibility,"" he added. ""I am only interested in tomorrow's game. We will then see what happens and if Granada are safe or not. We are concentrating on Espanyol and the chance to win three points which could make us champions."" Luis Enrique is expected to make just one change from the side that beat Real Betis last weekend with Marc-Andre ter Stegen replacing the injured Claudio Bravo in goal."
408,05/05/2016,17:12,Goal-getting Griezmann learning from Simeone,Atletico Madrid's Champions League goal hero Antoine Griezmann says he is learning every day from inspirational coach Diego Simeone.,"Griezmann scored the vital goal as Atletico ousted Bayern Munich on away goals on Tuesday to book their place in a second Champions League final in three years against Real Madrid in Milan on May 28. ""Every day I learn from him and my teammates. I knew that I personally still could improve and that I was going to help the team,"" Griezmann said on Thursday. ""The truth is this squad has a lot of quality. We still have plenty more to give and my objective was to fight for everything."" Griezmann wasn't part of the Atletico side that lost out 4-1 after extra time to Real in the final two years ago. However, after a 31-goal season that has also kept Atletico well in the fight to win La Liga with two games remaining, he is relishing the chance to deliver on the biggest stage. ""It will be a great final. For me it is the first time and I will enjoy it as I always do,"" he added. Atletico are tied on points with Barcelona at the top of La Liga, but need the Catalans to slip up in one of their two remaining games due to Barca's superior head-to-head record. ""Now we need to think about La Liga. That is what is important for us and then we will have time to think about the final. ""I don't think the fans care who we got in the final, they are just happy and excited to be there."""
409,05/05/2016,13:38,Madrid press pays homage to Champions League capital,Madrid's sports papers hailed their city's dominant football teams the day after Real Madrid set up a second Champions League final in the three years against Atletico Madrid on Thursday.,"Real edged a thrilling final in 2014 for their 10th European Cup in Lisbon as Sergio Ramos's injury-time header denied Atletico their first European Cup by sending the game to extra-time before Los Blancos ran out 4-1 winners. ""Madrid, capital of the Champions League,"" said sports daily Marca in their digital edition. ""The second part of what was lived in Lisbon, will be celebrated in Milan. ""Real Madrid and Atletico will go face-to-face once more in the San Siro with the memory of Sergio Ramos's goal."" Rival sports daily AS splashed ""Long live Madrid"" across its front page. ""Until 2014 in Lisbon no Champions League final had seen two teams from the same city face off,"" said AS editor Alfredo Relano. ""Madrid has improved its record, duplicating its success in case another city - Milan, Manchester or London - tries to equal it."" There was praise for Real coach and former legendary player Zinedine Zidane, who has led his side to the final after just four months in the job since replacing the sacked Rafael Benitez. Zidane can now win the Champions League in a third different role at Madrid having scored a stunning winning goal in the 2002 final and been coach Carlo Ancelotti's assistant two years ago. ""The miracle of Zidane,"" said the online version of El Pais. ""The French coach took on a moribund team in January, but has captivated the players and fans to qualify for the Champions League final."" There was also some mischief from the Barcelona-based press, forced to watch on as their two great La Liga rivals prepare for another final. Just as two years ago, Atletico dumped Barca out at the quarter-final stage. However, despite repeated criticism of Atletico's rough and defensive style, Barcelona daily Sport showed which side they are on with a front cover carrying a picture of Atletico coach Diego ""El Cholo"" Simeone celebrating his side's semi-final win over Bayern Munich. ""Cholo fans, but only for a day,"" ran the headline."
410,04/05/2016,23:09,Real edge past City to set up all-Madrid final,Real Madrid will face Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final for the second time in three years after overcoming Manchester City 1-0 in their semi-final second leg on Wednesday.,"Brazilian midfielder Fernando deflected Gareth Bale's cross into his own net after 20 minutes at the Santiago Bernabeu for the only goal of the tie after the first leg ended goalless. Fernandinho came closest to taking City to their first ever Champions League final when his shot clipped the outside of the post a minute before half-time. Real beat Atletico 4-1 after extra time in Lisbon two years ago to win the competition for a 10th time and will be hoping for a repeat when they face Diego Simeone's men in Milan on May 28. ""It is another final. It has been very difficult to get there,"" Madrid defender Sergio Ramos -- whose 93rd-minute header sent the previous final against Atletico into extra time -- told BeIN Sports Spain. ""We have shown we know how to win a final and we are going to try and do it again."" City's performance over the two legs left much to be desired, but goalkeeper Joe Hart claimed the difference between the sides had been the luck Real enjoyed in the only goal of the game. ""We could easily be in the final but they managed the game well,"" he told BT Sport. ""They've beaten us with a very lucky goal but it is what it is."" The hosts were given a huge boost before kick-off as Cristiano Ronaldo made his return after a three-game absence due to a thigh injury. By contrast, City were dealt a massive injury blow inside 10 minutes when captain Vincent Kompany was forced off once more with a muscle problem in an injury-disrupted campaign. Ronaldo was looking to equal his own record of 17 Champions League goals in a season, but sent his first chance well over the bar with a header from Dani Carvajal's cross. However, Madrid got the luck they needed to swing the tie in their favour with their next attack as Bale was played in on the right of the City box and his intended cross spooned up off Fernando and into the far corner to leave Joe Hart helpless. The difference in European pedigree between the clubs couldn't have been starker as Madrid were playing in their 27th semi-final, whilst City were in the last four for the first time. That inexperience looked to be taking hold as City enjoyed decent spells of first-half possession without troubling the Real defence. However, they came within inches of finding the crucial away goal just before the break when Kevin De Bruyne picked out Fernandinho and the Brazilian midfielder's low driven shot clipped the outside of the post. The goalmouth action was all in City's box early in the second period as Hart was called upon to keep his side in the match. Luka Modric spurned a huge chance to put the tie to bed when he fired straight at Hart as the Croatian seemed surprised himself not to have been flagged offside. Hart also kept out a Ronaldo header and fierce drive from the edge of the box as Madrid pressed. Bale then saw a looping header come off the bar as, just as in the first leg, Madrid constantly caused City problems from set-pieces. Yet, out of nothing City nearly snatched the goal they needed a minute from time when top scorer Sergio Aguero's first serious effort of the tie dipped onto the roof of the net. Real keeper Keylor Navas then injured himself in scurrying from his goal to clear a long through ball. Yet, despite a frantic finale, Madrid continued their record of not conceding a goal at home in the Champions League this season to progress to their 14th European Cup final."
411,04/05/2016,17:50,Atletico president rejects 'ugly' football slur,Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo has hit back at critics of the Spanish side's defensive tactics after reaching a second Champions League final in three years.,"An incredible rearguard action from a Bayern Munich onslaught saw Atletico hold out for a 2-1 defeat against the German giants on Tuesday to progress on away goals after edging the first leg 1-0 last week. ""Today ugly football played against the best football in the world,"" raged Bayern midfielder Arturo Vidal afterwards. ""The only time they saw the ball was their goal."" However, Cerezo hit back as Atletico have now beaten defending European champions Barcelona and a Bayern side on the verge of their fourth Bundesliga title to reach the final. ""Our football is ugly? It is marvellous and we play to win,"" he told Radio Marca on Wednesday. ""We are in an enviable situation."" Atletico could face city rivals Real Madrid in the final in Milan on May 28th should Real overcome Manchester City in the other semi-final on Wednesday. Real's Sergio Ramos equalised deep into stoppage time to prevent Atletico their first ever Champions League title in the final two years ago before Real ran out 4-1 winners after extra-time. And having also conceded late on to Bayern in their only other final appearance in 1974, Cerezo believes Atletico are owed a bit of luck in the final. ""I always say the Champions League owes us one and possibly it is this one. It would be our first one and would round off a marvellous season,"" he added. ""We have already beaten PSV Eindhoven, Barcelona and Bayern so we don't care whoever is next."""

After Atletico had beaten Bayern 1-0 in Madrid, Griezmann's crucial away goal in Munich means Diego Simeone's Atletico will face either Real Madrid or Manchester City in the final. ""We're delighted,"" said Griezmann. ""It was difficult, a really hard game. We had a great opponent in front of us and we had to both defend and try to score. That's what we did. ""They were better, but we scored an away goal, which was important."" Atletico, level on points with Barcelona at the top of La Liga with two games of the campaign left, face a busy few weeks. ""We need to keep grounded and first of all think in the Liga before the final,"" added Griezmann. Bayern and coach Pep Guardiola will rue Thomas Mueller's saved first-half penalty just after Xabi Alonso had given the hosts the lead by crashing home a first-half free-kick. There was similar drama in the second half when Manuel Neuer saved Torres' late penalty attempt for Atletico. ""We want to win the tournament,"" said the 32-year-old Torres, who won the 2012 Champions League title while at Chelsea. ""We have the chance to create history and the opponent is irrelevant. ""We've beaten the champions of Holland, Spain and now Germany (PSV Eindhoven, Barcelona and Bayern) to get the final. ""It was very intense and I'm so proud of this team. ""It's fully deserved and we're closer to our dream. ""When you play against a side like Bayern, you can't play the game you want. ""They created a lot of chances and put us under a lot of pressure. ""In the second half, we did things differently, pressed them high, counter attack and we got the goal. ""The most important thing is we're in the final."" Simeone said he was stunned by his side's ability to cope with the stress in the pressure-cooker atmosphere of Munich's Allianz Arena. ""I really have to say we played against the best team I have faced in my whole career, it was unbelievable how they played,"" said Simeone. ""It was great to see my team play with such intensity. ""When Bayern missed their penalty, we had a good chat in the half-time break and we coped with the pressure they put on us in the second half. ""We achieved our goal, we have seen that we are a very strong team, but we were really good defensively."" Simeone also singled out Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak and Neuer for their saves to deny Mueller and Torres respectively. ""They were two great saves by the goalies, I have to say how difficult it is to cope with this situation at Bayern, playing away from home. It's unbelievable what we have achieved,"" said Simeone. ""Now we have beaten three of the strongest teams in Europe."" Having lost 4-1 to Real Madrid in the 2014 Champions League final, Atletico will now bid for their first European crown at the third attempt having also lost the 1974 final -- to Bayern. ""This is another chance for us to win the Champions league final. We have 15 days to prepare and whoever gets through to the final will be just as prepared,"" replied Simeone when asked if he would prefer to play Real or City in the final."

However, Thomas Mueller then had a penalty saved and Antoine Griezmann grabbed a decisive away goal for the Spaniards in the 54th minute. Robert Lewandowski put Bayern back in front on the night but Atletico held on despite Fernando Torres having a spot-kick saved by Manuel Neuer.

Diego Simeone's Atletico have won all of their last seven games and have not conceded a goal in the last 602 minutes. Atletico have arrived in Munich holding a slender lead after Saul Niguez's early solo strike in last Wednesday's first leg sealed Madrid's 1-0 home win. Bayern have lost just twice in 23 previous home meetings against Spanish sides in Europe. They have won their 11 home Champions League games since being thrashed 4-0 in Munich by Real Madrid two years ago in the semi-finals. Bayern need at least a goal -- and must stop Atletico from scoring -- to keep their dreams of reaching a fourth Champions League final in seven years. Martinez says they will be going all out at the sold-out Allianz Arena. ""We are going to attack from the first minute and we want to score an early goal,"" said the Spain international. ""We know it's going to be difficult to score against them, they defend with 11 men and are very compact, but we have one of the best attacks in Europe and we have to show patience. ""We know we have to prevent them from scoring. ""They didn't just get to the Champions League semi-final by playing well in defence, they have great players, who like to go forward. ""Atletico have one of the strongest defence in Europe, but I think we can reach the final because I trust my team and we are strong across the board. ""We are going to have more ball and fight for the result with our fans behind us, it'll be very different at home for us."" Bayern coach Pep Guardiola is bidding to avoid losing to Spanish opposition in the semi-finals of the Champions League for the third year running after losing to Real, then Barcelona in his previous campaigns. ""We want possession, we want to attack and score goals, but that won't be easy against Atletico,"" said the 45-year-old, who will coach Manchester City next season. ""They have good defensive players, but they are very good going forward and are compact, but we will try and fight our way through."""
415,02/05/2016,20:39,Guardiola eager to break Spanish semi curse,Pep Guardiola insists Bayern Munich can make it third time lucky against Spanish opposition in Tuesday's Champions League semi-final return leg with Atletico Madrid at the Allianz Arena.,"Atletico come to Munich holding a slender lead after Saul Niguez's early solo strike in last Wednesday's first leg sealed Madrid's 1-0 home win. Guardiola, who will coach Manchester City next season, wants to sign off in Munich by winning a sixth European title with Bayern in the Champions League final in Milan on May 28. Bayern's head coach could finish his third and final year in Munich with the treble. The Bavarian giants are set to win a fourth consecutive German league title on Saturday away to Ingolstadt and face rivals Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final on May 21. But the Champions League title is the one both Guardiola and Bayern crave, especially after the failed semi-final attempts of the last two years. In 2014, Bayern were routed 4-0 in Munich by Real Madrid, when Sergio Ramos and Cristiano Ronaldo both netted twice, after the Bavarians had lost the first leg 1-0 at the Bernabeu. In last year's semi, Lionel Messi tore the Bayern defence apart in the second-half in the first-leg in Barcelona. He scored two goals, then created one for Neymar, in Barcelona's 3-0 win at the Camp Nou, before Bayern bowed out despite winning the return leg 3-2 in Munich. ""It's the third semi-final in a row. It's very important to reach the final, but it was just as important as against Real and Barcelona when we didn't manage it,"" said Guardiola. ""Against Real, we didn't have Ronaldo, (Gareth) Bale, (Karim) Benzema or (Angel) Di Maria under control. ""Against Barcelona, we weren't ready, we only had 14 available players, but we're ready for tomorrow and it will be a different game."" Guardiola insists his side has improved since their home debacle against Madrid two years ago. ""We learnt from the game against Real,"" said the 45-year-old. ""We have only conceded 15 goals in the Bundesliga this season and have not allowed many goal chances. ""What I have noticed in my time here is that we can defend very well high up the pitch and not just in the penalty area."" Bayern need at least a goal -- and must stop Atletico from scoring -- to keep their dreams of reaching a fourth Champions League final in seven years. Guardiola is still smarting from the German media's criticism from the first leg. He left Thomas Mueller, Bayern's all-time top scorer in European football, on the bench and the Germany star is set to start on Tuesday. ""We need our best performance to reach the final,"" said Guardiola. ""We must not think about how many goals we have to score, first we need to defend well and control the game. ""We did not win or lose because Thomas Mueller wasn't there (in the first leg), and tomorrow we will not win or lose because Thomas is or isn't there."" Guardiola implied centre-back Jerome Boateng will start. The Germany centre-back played for an hour in Saturday's 1-1 league draw with Borussia Moenchengladbach after 99 days out with a groin injury. French winger Franck Ribery, who picked up a back injury last Friday, is also an option. ""I don't know if Jerome's fit for 120 minutes, I'll know that if he plays the 90 minutes,"" said Guardiola. ""I can only judge that myself tomorrow, he's only had three days to regenerate for the game, so we'll have to see how he is. ""Ribery is fit and he is one more option for us."""

Atletico are bidding to reach the Champions League final on May 28 in Milan having lost 4-1 after extra-time in the 2014 final to neighbours Real Madrid. Spain international Torres says they will do everything to ensure Bayern coach Pep Guardiola signs off his third and final year in Munich with a third defeat to Spanish opposition in the European semi-finals. ""We'd die for each other, we fight for each other on the field and it'll be a another battle against Bayern tomorrow,"" said Torres. The 32-year-old is enjoying a new lease of life at Atletico having played in 10 of Madrid's European games this season and says the secret to their success is simply hard work. ""The most important thing is that we know who we are and that we are nothing unless we work as a team,"" he said. ""We've conceded one of the fewest amount of goals in Europe this season and we score in nearly every game, so if you put the two together, it's a good combination. ""I enjoy every day and every game and when I see young players who play at the highest level, it's wonderful and you have to learn from their attitude. ""I am thankful to be back here with Atletico, but tomorrow, we are going to play a very important game which we want to win."" With centre-back Diego Godin, the cornerstone of the Atletico defence, back from a hamstring injury, Simeone refused to be drawn as to whether he would start the Uruguay international. ""we are lucky in that we have four good defenders available to us,"" said the Atletico coach with Lucas Hernandez, Stefan Savic and Jose Maria Gimenez also bidding for a starting berth. ""In the first leg we played in a way that feels good for us. ""The work we have done these past four-and-a-half-years is slowly paying off. ""We have some new players and it is really great to work with them. ""I am nervous before every game. ""We have to see what line-up Bayern use tomorrow, but we want to win tomorrow, play our football and to be successful."""
417,02/05/2016,01:30,Bayern's Guardiola under pressure for Atletico return,Bayern Munich's coach Pep Guardiola knows he needs to prove his critics wrong by overturning a 1-0 first-leg deficit against Atletico Madrid in Tuesday's crunch home Champions League semi-final.,"Guardiola and Bayern are bidding to avoid losing a semi-final to a Spanish side for the third year running having lost the first-leg last Wednesday at Atletico after Saul Niguez's early solo strike. Having won 14 titles in four years at Barcelona and six titles so far in three years with Bayern, Guardiola hopes to sign off in charge of Munich by lifting the Champions League trophy at the final on May 28 in Milan. Bayern have exited the Champions League semi-finals for the last two years running with defeats to Real Madrid in 2014, then to Barcelona last year. Another exit at the hands of Spanish opposition will not go down well in Bavaria, especially in the wake of Guardiola's decision to start the first leg in Madrid with Germany star Thomas Mueller, Bayern's top scorer in Europe this season, on the bench. The decision drew plenty of criticism from the German media and, by his own admission, the Munich leg is Guardiola's ""final bullet"" in the battle to prove any critics wrong before he leaves to coach Manchester City next season. ""I have read in a German newspaper that my work in Munich will only be valued, and the job considered done, if I win the Champions League. That's how it'll be seen,"" Guardiola told reporters after Bayern saw off Benfica in the quarterfinals. Bayern have been unstoppable at home in Europe this season, winning all five games at the Allianz Arena, but needed extra time to come back from 2-0 down to beat Juventus 4-2 at home in the second leg of the last 16. They have won all 11 home games in Europe since being hammered 4-0 in the Munich leg by Real Madrid in the 2014 semi-finals, having lost 1-0 in Spain. But, as they demonstrated in Saturday's 1-1 Bundesliga draw at home to Borussia Moechengladbach, they are simply not currently playing well, as they typically sat back after taking an early lead through Mueller's header. The result denied Bayern the victory which would have confirmed them as Bundesliga champions, now they have to wait until Saturday's away game at Ingolstadt when they could become the first club to win four straight German league titles. The good news from the Gladbach draw is that Germany defender Jerome Boateng is fit again after 99 days out with a groin injury having played the first 68 minutes in Munich. ""It was important to get a few minutes. I hope with the emotions of the game I'll have the strength to play for the 90 minutes (against Atletico). The tempo will be very different,"" said Boateng. ""Our chances are good. We're playing at home, the pitch will be good and we want to put pressure on from the start."" In turn, Diego Simeone's Atletico were boosted by the news Uruguay defender Diego Godin and Belgium winger Yannick Carrasco took part in training on Sunday after injury. Godin has missed the last two weeks with a hamstring injury and is set to return as the cornerstone of Atletico's defence in their bid to repeat their run to the 2014 final, there they lost 4-1 to Real Madrid after extra-time. ""It is the best thing to have great games and the tiredness matters little,"" said Atletico's Antoine Griezmann, the goal-scorer in their 1-0 Spanish league win over Rayo Vallecano on Saturday, when Simeone made seven changes. ""We are very enthusiastic. Every player dreams of playing in a Champions League semi-final and we will give everything."""
418,30/04/2016,22:43,Griezmann: Fatigue won't affect tireless Atletico,Atletico Madrid's top scorer Antoine Griezmann insisted tiredness won't derail their attempt to reach a second Champions League final in three years at Bayern Munich on Tuesday.,"The Spanish side travel to the German champions with a 1-0 first leg lead. Griezmann was forced off the bench to score the winner as Atletico also maintained their La Liga title hopes with a 1-0 win over Rayo Vallecano on Saturday as coach Diego Simeone made seven changes from the side that started the first leg against Bayern. And despite Atletico's long season and high-energy style, Griezmann believes they are where they dreamed of being at the start of the season. ""It is the best thing to have great games and the tiredness matters little,"" said Griezmann after netting his 30th goal of the season. ""We are very enthusiastic. Every player dreams of playing a Champions League semi-final and we will give everything."" Griezmann rode to Atletico's rescue with a brilliant volley barely a minute after coming on as a second-half substitute to ensure Atletico remain level on points with Barcelona at the top of La Liga with just two games remaining. ""The important thing was to win and on a personal level I'm happy to score the goal,"" Griezmann told Movistar+. ""Now we need to rest. We have a great game to come on Tuesday and we'll try to get a good result there to go through to the final."""
419,29/04/2016,02:05,Bayern poised to make history despite Atletico distraction,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich can become the first club to win a fourth consecutive Bundesliga title by beating Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday, amidst the distraction of their Champions League semi-final.","Bayern hold a seven-point lead and with three games left, a win over Gladbach at Munich's Allianz Arena will confirm a fourth straight German league title, a feat no other team has achieved before. But Bayern are still smarting from Wednesday's 1-0 Champions League defeat at Atletico Madrid. Guardiola has been criticised by the German media (""Has Pep mullered Bayern's final chances?', asked Bild""), plus ex-Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld (""the tactic didn't work""), for his selection. Thomas Mueller, Bayern's top-scorer in Europe, and Franck Ribery both started on the bench leaving Bayern with it all to do in Tuesday's return leg in Munich. Guardiola scoffed when asked if he would rest some of his stars against Gladbach. ""We still need another win, we only have a few days to prepare and then we face Atletico three days later,"" he said. ""We have to win against Gladbach first."" In the wake of the Atletico defeat, only their fifth of the season, Bayern are feeling the pressure in their bid for a repeat of the 2013 treble. ""We would make a mistake if we quarrel now, I want to go to Milan,"" said chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge as the Champions League final will be held in the Italian city on May 28. Guardiola is likely to start with Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze up front against Gladbach. Defender Jerome Boateng could well play his first minutes since suffering a groin injury in January. Having beaten Munich 3-1 at Borussia Park in December, Gladbach are chasing a rare home-and-away double but will be without US international Fabian Johnson, who has a leg injury. Should Gladbach shock Bayern, Borussia Dortmund will look to delay the Munich title party with victory over last season's runners up VfL Wolfsburg at the Signal Iduna Park. Dortmund are set to lose their third star player to Bayern in three years after captain and defender Mats Hummels announced he wants to join the Bavarian giants next season. Dortmund have said they will accept only ""an exceptional offer"" for the World Cup-winner, who has a market value of 32 million euros ($36.32m). Should he leave with a year left on his contract, Hummels will follow Goetze, who left for Bayern in 2013 for 37m euros, and striker Robert Lewandowski, who signed on a free transfer in 2014. Dortmund have won their last three games by a 3-0 scoreline and have already qualified for the Champions League. Despite reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League, Wolfsburg have lost their Bundesliga bite in 2016 and are now 10th, six points away from the European places. Their 2-0 defeat to Augsburg last Saturday meant they have dropped 16 points in their previous six games. Bayer Leverkusen could take a big step towards a direct Champions League berth when they host fellow European aspirants Hertha Berlin on Saturday. Leverkusen have won their last six, conceding just two goals in the process, and could secure their place in the Champions League's group stage with a win. Fourth-placed Hertha have not won since March. There will be a crunch clash on Monday in the relegation battle when Werder Bremen host VfB Stuttgart. Stuttgart, who are 15th, are only two points clear of Werder and a win would see Bremen climb out of the relegation play-off spot with two games left. ""We're fully aware of how crucial this game is. We're going to do all we can to claim the points, I can guarantee that,"" said Bremen's Senegal international Papy Djilobodji. Fixtures (all times 1330 GMT unless stated)"
420,28/04/2016,00:50,"Bayern punished for slow start, admits Guardiola","Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola conceded his side had paid a heavy price for a slow start as Saul Niguez's sensational 11th minute solo effort handed Atletico Madrid a slender 1-0 from their Champions League semi-final, first leg on Wednesday.","The German champions dominated possession, but struggled to create chances as Atletico held out for their 33rd clean sheet of the season to take a huge step towards their second final in three years. ""We had talked before the game about how Atletico tend to start well,"" said Guardiola, who will leave Bayern to join Manchester City at the start of next season. ""It is not a great result for us. It is always unpleasant to have not scored an away goal, but we still have 90 minutes."" Bayern also lost the first leg of their semi-final in Spain to Real Madrid and Barcelona in the previous two years of Guardiola's tenure. And despite being on the verge of a third German title in as many years in Munich, Guardiola's men must turn the tide if he is to avoid the embarrassment of leaving for Manchester without having conquered Europe. ""In the Champions League you need to use the full 90 minutes, which we didn't manage here and didn't play well for the first 15 minutes. ""We have to play more intelligently in the return match, we need patience and we only need a goal to take the game to extra time."" Bayern captain Philipp Lahm also lamented Bayern's inability to score an away goal and was far from happy with the state of Atletico's stodgy pitch. ""We didn't think we'd have so many chances to score in the second half as we did, but we didn't use them. ""You have to use them in games like this, but we still have 90 minutes to come with the fans behind us to try and turn the game around. ""At home, the pitch will be watered, the ball will roll better and we'll get our passing game going."" By contrast, Atletico were jubilant after 21-year-old Niguez announced his arrival on the European stage with what he described as the ""most beautiful and most important goal"" of his career. Niguez eased past four Bayern challenges before curling left-footed in off the far post. ""I was dribbling with the ball, I saw that I'd got by two opponents so when I got into the area I thought about getting it onto my stronger foot, and because it was on my left, I placed it,"" he said. ""It's the most beautiful and most important goal I've scored."" Despite being under the cosh for almost the entire second half, Atletico were inches away from doubling their advantage when Fernando Torres struck the post 15 minutes from time. ""It was a fantastic night and I'm happy for all Atletico fans,"" said Torres. ""We've got what we wanted which was to get the scoreline in our favour and we have the second leg to come. ""We suffered and kept suffering, kept fighting, that's what we do. ""Bayern have a level few teams have but we kept on doing our thing."""
421,27/04/2016,22:40,Atletico gain edge against Bayern,A sensational solo effort from Saul Niguez handed Atletico Madrid a precious 1-0 advantage over Bayern Munich from the first leg of their Champions League semi-final at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday.,"The Spanish under-21 international skipped past four Bayern players before firing into the far corner to give Atletico the perfect start after 11 minutes. Bayern dominated for long spells thereafter, but the closest they came to a vital away goal was a thunderous long-range effort from David Alaba that came back off the crossbar. Atletico will travel to Bavaria for the return next Tuesday looking to complete the job to reach their second final in three years and exact revenge for their defeat to Bayern in the 1974 final. Bayern lost the first legs of their semi-finals in Spain in the previous two seasons to Real Madrid and Barcelona on their way out of the competition. And they couldn't have made a worse start once more in the Spanish capital as, roared on by a vociferous support, Atletico flew out of the blocks early on. Niguez had already had a long-range effort saved by Manuel Neuer before he opened the scoring in stunning style. The 21-year-old picked the ball up near halfway and skipped past four half-hearted Bayern challenges before curling a left-footed shot in off the inside of the far post. Atletico nearly gifted Bayern an equaliser immediately as Jose Maria Gimenez's miscued clearance pinballed around the area before the Uruguayan atoned for his initial error by clearing off the line. Bayern were dominant in possession, but struggled to create clear-cut chances against an Atletico side that now hasn't conceded at home in their last seven Champions League knockout ties. Alaba shot wide from distance, while Douglas Costa's free-kick nearly caught out Jan Oblak at his near post. Yet, it was Atletico who squandered a big chance to make it 2-0 before the break when Antoine Griezmann's shot from a narrow angle was turned behind by Neuer. Bayern were completely dominant after the break as Atletico tired and dropped deeper towards their own goal. Alaba smashed a wonder strike off the underside of the bar from fully 35 yards before Javi Martinez's powerful header from Costa's corner was gratefully grasped by Oblak low to his right. Guardiola had controversially left Thomas Mueller on the bench despite his 31 goals in all competitions this season. The future Manchester City boss eventually called upon the German World Cup winner and Franck Ribery in search of a vital away goal. Costa came close again seconds after Mueller's arrival as his attempted lob over Oblak dipped just over the bar. Oblak was called into action again to parry an Arturo Vidal piledriver from distance. Yet, once more Atletico had the best chance to put the tie beyond the German champions in the final stages as Fernando Torres hit the post from Griezmann's fine through ball and Neuer saved Koke's follow-up effort. Oblak made simple saves from Mehdi Benatia and Vidal in stoppage time as Atletico held out to record their 33rd clean sheet of the season."

The extra ball was thrown onto the pitch from near the Atletico bench by a ball boy, in what appeared to be a case of gamesmanship. Spanish federation rules stipulate that as the culprit couldn't be identified at the time by the referee, Simeone is held responsible as the most senior figure on the bench. The Argentine will though be free to sit on the bench for Atletico's Champions League semi-final, first leg against Bayern Munich later on Wednesday. ""It is clear the referee took the correct decision,"" Simeone said after Saturday's match. The news is a big blow to Atletico's title hopes as they lie second in the table behind Barcelona only due to their inferior head-to-head record. Simeone will miss home games against Rayo Vallecano and Celta Vigo as well as the trip to Levante. Atletico have 10 days to launch an appeal."

424,27/04/2016,01:35,Winning at Atletico all the more special for Torres,Fernando Torres believes winning Atletico Madrid's first ever Champions League would be an even greater feeling than lifting the World Cup.,"Atletico face the might of five-time winners Bayern Munich in the first leg of their semi-final at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday. Torres was on the opposition side when Atletico reached the last four for the first time in 40 years two years ago and even scored for Chelsea as the Spaniards went through 3-1 on aggregate. The 32-year-old returned to Atletico in January 2015 after a seven-year absence hoping to finally get the chance to win silverware with his boyhood club, who he captained between 2001 and 2007. And despite winning the European Championship twice and the World Cup with Spain as well as the Champions League with Chelsea, his love for Atletico would make European success there the sweetest of his distinguished career. ""I feel very lucky to have been with great teams. The national team gave me the chance to live some incredible nights and win big titles,"" said Torres. ""But for me personally nothing compares to what it would be like to do it with Atletico."" Atletico are also in with a chance of winning La Liga for the second time in three years as they are level on points with Barcelona at the top of the table with three games to go thanks in part to Torres's fine goalscoring run of five goals in six games. Torres sang Atletico coach Diego Simeone's name from the stands as the Argentine -- then a dynamic midfielder -- inspired the Rojiblancos to a league and cup double in the 1995-96 season. Now Torres is determined for this Atletico side to write themselves into the club's history books with a historic double of their own. ""We have a fantastic opportunity in front of us, a great tie against one of the big favourites without doubt,"" he added. ""What we want to do is write new history. Hopefully in a week's time we can say we have taken another step towards it."" Bayern are also desperate to reach the final in coach Pep Guardiola's final season in charge having fallen at the semi-final stage in the last two seasons to Spanish opposition in Barcelona and Real Madrid. Xabi Alonso will anchor the Bayern midfield on his return to the Spanish capital after five seasons at Real Madrid, but was keen to highlight Atletico's defensive strengths rather than those of his old Liverpool teammate Torres. ""There are facets in which they are probably the best team in the world,"" said Alonso of Atletico's remarkable 32 clean sheets this season. ""They are in the top five of teams in Europe and they deserve to be there."" Atletico are expected to be missing one of their key defensive lynchpins, though, as Diego Godin is a major doubt due to a hamstring injury. By contrast, Bayern's defence could be handed a huge boost by the return of German international Jerome Boateng as he made the trip to Madrid after three months out with a groin injury."
425,26/04/2016,21:03,Guardiola: Atletico as tough as Barca or Madrid,Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola has insisted his side face as stern a task in their Champions League semi-final against Atletico Madrid as in their failed attempts at this stage in the past two seasons.,"Guardiola, whose side face Atletico at the Vicente Calderon in their semi-final first leg on Wednesday, will leave Bayern at the end of the season to join Manchester City. However, before he does so he has a final chance to leave his legacy in Germany by winning the Bavarians' sixth European Cup. Bayern's attempt to win the Champions League has faltered in embarrassing fashion against Spanish opposition in the semi-finals in the past two seasons as they conceded five goals against both Real Madrid and Barcelona. However, with Atletico in their second semi-final in three years and level at the top of La Liga with Barcelona, Guardiola believes Diego Simeone's men deserve the same level of respect. ""The biggest title that Atletico have won with Simeone and his coaching staff is to be compared with Barca and Real Madrid and that in Europe they are as feared as Barca or Madrid,"" said Guardiola, who won 14 trophies in four years with Barca between 2008 and 2012. ""Any team can win one year, but continuity and continuing to win year after year is the most difficult thing in sport and that is what they have achieved."" Bayern are just one win away from sealing a third Bundesliga title in as many years under Guardiola and the Spaniard said City will get a better coach next season for his experiences in Munich, even if he doesn't deliver the Champions League. ""In three years we have made it to the semi-finals. From what I have experienced in Munich if we don't win the Champions League the work won't be complete,"" added Guardiola. ""I am very lucky to have experienced what I have in Germany for three years. ""I am calmer, a better coach and I have enjoyed it a lot."" Bayern captain Philipp Lahm believes the German champions must score away in the first leg having failed to do so in Spain in the past two years. ""We know that in the last two semi-final away legs we didn't score and tomorrow that is what we have to do."" Despite their huge upturn in fortunes under Simeone in the past four and a half years, Atletico are still looking for their first ever Champions League triumph. Atletico's defensive resistence proved too strong for Barcelona's star front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar as they dumped the defending champions out in the quarter-finals. Simeone admitted that Bayern's variety of attacking options offers a different threat, but is confident his side can overcome the odds once more. ""They have different characteristics that make them even stronger,"" said Simeone. ""It is clear the one that wins isn't the one with most soldiers, but the one that utilises them better."" And Simeone dismissed the suggestion that Atletico can enjoy the tie more with the pressure firmly on Bayern to finally deliver the Champions League under Guardiola. ""We can only think about what we are playing for and the big opportunity in front of us,"" added Simeone. ""We are the ones that compete and we have to concentrate on just one thing; which is to win."""
426,26/04/2016,02:17,Leicester an inspiration for giant-killing Atletico,"Leicester City's remarkable run to the verge of the Premier League title has inspired Atletico Madrid in their aim to land a historic Champions League and La Liga double, claims defender Filipe Luis.","Atletico face Bayern Munich in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on Wednesday looking to cause another big upset after dumping defending champions Barcelona out in the quarter-finals. The budget used to put together Diego Simeone's side pales into comparison next to the riches of the other three semi-finalists as the world's richest club Real Madrid face the Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City in the other semi-final. However, former Chelsea defender Luis believes Leicester's meteoric rise to the top of the Premier League is an inspiration to clubs the world over that money can't always buy success at the top level. ""It is happening this year in the Premier League with Leicester. They are a modest team that are almost champions of the Premier League,"" said the Brazilian international. ""In football these epic things happen because, although there is a difference in budget, we are the team that plays most as a team. ""We don't have a superstar, we have a team where everyone runs and fights for the person next to them and that makes us stronger."" The pain of missing out in the final minute of the final against bitter rivals Real two years ago is still fresh in Atletico minds as they target a first ever Champions League triumph. However, they are also seeking revenge against Bayern as they conceded an equaliser in the final minute of extra-time against the German giants in their only other final 42 years ago before Munich went on to dominate the replay 4-0. Atletico's brilliant defensive organisation proved too good for Barca's star front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar in the last round. However, the Spaniards are likely to be without lynchpin Diego Godin for the first leg due to a hamstring injury. And Luis believes Bayern's deadly duo of Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller offer a different threat. ""Bayern are a different team to Barcelona because Bayern play with two goalscorers in the area and two very wide players,"" he added. ""Barca play with just Suarez in the area. Bayern have a lot of resources, they will have the majority of the ball for sure, but we also believe in our strengths."" In contrast to Atletico's relative lack of experience at this stage of the competition, Bayern have made it to the last four for the fifth consecutive season. However, they have fallen in embarrassing circumstances to Spanish opposition in the semi-finals at the hands of Real Madrid and Barcelona in the past two seasons. And there is extra pressure on coach Pep Guardiola to deliver the Champions League in his final campaign in Bavaria before joining Manchester City next season. ""We have to be ready. We know that Atletico are a totally different proposition to what we have experienced so far,"" said Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. ""They threw Barcelona out and we know, of course from our coach, that we will be playing against a brutally hard opponent and experience a heated atmosphere in their stadium."" In contrast to Atletico's tight three-way battle with Barca and Real Madrid for the Spanish title, Bayern can focus their attention on Europe as they are just one win away from sealing a record fourth Bundesliga. And their defensive troubles could be eased by the return of German international Jerome Boateng through injury after three months out with a groin injury. However, Arjen Robben looks set to miss at least the first leg with an groin problem."

Guardiola made seven changes to his starting line-up in Berlin as his side produced just six shots on goal in the German capital and he expects a tougher test in Madrid. ""It will be a completely different game,"" said the Spaniard. ""It's difficult to always play at 100 percent and I understand if the players already had an eye on Wednesday's game against Atletico."""
428,22/04/2016,12:50,Atletico's Godin major doubt for Bayern semi-final,Atletico Madrid look set to be without key defender Diego Godin for at least the first leg of their Champions League semi-final against Bayern Munich due to a hamstring injury.,"""Godin suffered a grade I-II muscle injury in his right hamstring,"" Atletico said in a statement on Friday, without specifying how long the Uruguayan international will be sidelined. However, Madrid sports daily Marca reported Godin will be out for at least 10 days meaning he will miss the first leg at home to the German champions on Wednesday and faces a race to be fit for the return leg at the Allianz Arena on May 3. Godin also looks set to miss home games against Malaga and Rayo Vallecano with Atletico level on points with Barcelona at the top of La Liga with just four games remaining."
429,19/04/2016,02:15,Barca on brink of implosion on La Liga super Wednesday,"Barcelona must reverse an amazing loss of form to win all five of their remaining La Liga games to be assured of retaining their title, starting with a trip to Deportivo la Coruna on Wednesday.","The Catalan giants have taken just one point from their last four La Liga games and lost four of their last five in all competitions having previously enjoyed a 39-game unbeaten run stretching back six months. Only Barca's superior head-to-head record separates them from their Champions League conquerers Atletico Madrid at the top of the table with Real Madrid lurking just a point further back after a run of seven straight league wins. All three face tough tests on a Wednesday evening of action that will go a long way to settling the title with the fixture list for all three favourable in the final four games. Barca are up first as they travel to Galicia in a desperate search to snap their worst run of league defeats in 13 years. Coach Luis Enrique and key defender Gerard Pique insisted Barca can and will win the league if they play like they did against Valencia on Sunday despite slipping to a 2-1 defeat thanks to a mixture of bad luck, poor finishing and a brilliant goalkeeping display by Diego Alves. ""If there is a team capable of doing it and much more given what they have done, it is this Barca,"" said Enrique. ""We don't have any margin for error, but I prefer to lose like this than win playing badly,"" added Pique. ""Football is like this, sometimes it is marvellous, sometimes it is so cruel."" However, Pique's absence at the heart of Barca's defence through suspension will be a huge loss for Enrique with Marc Bartra expected to cover in the absence of Jeremy Mathieu and Thomas Vermaelen. Atletico face a daunting trip to Athletic Bilbao with the Basques still eyeing Champions League football next season having moved to within six points of fourth-placed Villarreal at the weekend. A 2-1 victory at San Mames propelled Atletico towards the title two years ago and Diego Simeone's men could be further boosted by the absence of Bilbao's two top scorers this season in Aritz Aduriz and Inaki Williams through injury. ""We have the possibility to play an important game in Bilbao and continue competing in the four games left afterwards,"" said Simeone when quizzed on Atletico's title chances. ""It will be difficult, but we have to do what the schedule demands of us and that is win, win and win again."" Atletico will be forced into at least one change as captain Gabi is suspended, but Fernando Torres will start alongside 29-goal Antoine Griezmann up front after scoring in four consecutive games for the first time since he was at Liverpool in 2010. Real will have the advantage of knowing what Barca and Atletico have done when they kick-off in the late game at home to Villarreal. Zinedine Zidane could afford the luxury of resting the likes of Sergio Ramos, Casemiro and Luka Modric for Saturday's 5-1 rout of Getafe on Saturday with all three expected to return. The much-criticised Danilo is also expected to start at right-back with Dani Carvajal a major injury doubt. There are also huge clashes at the bottom of the table with four teams separated by two points in the battle to avoid relegation. Two of them face each other as Granada host Levante on Thursday looking to open up a gap on the bottom three. Getafe go in search of their first win in 14 games at Real Sociedad, whilst Sporting Gijon look to take advantage of Sevilla's poor recent run when they host the Europa League semi-finalists at El Molinon.

But Bayern coach Pep Guardiola has said he does not know if Boateng will be fit to play in their Champions League semi-final, first leg clash at Atletico Madrid in ten days time, with the return leg in Munich on May 3. ""I'll only make my decision after I see how things are,"" said the Spaniard ahead of Bayern's German Cup semi-final on Tuesday at home to Werder Bremen. ""He has been injured for three months and he needs some conditioning."" If fit he is a shoe-in for the Germany team at the European Championships in France from June 10-July 10."
431,17/04/2016,20:21,Torres on target as Atletico join Barca atop La Liga,Fernando Torres struck his fourth goal in as many games as Atletico Madrid moved level with Barcelona at the top of La Liga with a routine 3-0 win over Granada on Sunday.,"Koke ensured Atletico would have no hangover from their efforts in dispatching Barca from the Champions League in midweek as he swept home the opener on 15 minutes before teeing up Torres to dink home just before the hour mark. Substitute Angel Correa rounded off the scoring with a cool finish seven minutes from time. Victory takes Atletico back a point clear of third-placed Real Madrid and level with Barca on 76 points with the Catalans aiming to halt an alarming dip in form later at home to Valencia. Atletico were met by a euphoric full house at the Vicente Calderon just four days after dumping Barca out the Champions League at the quarter-final stage for the second time in three seasons. And Koke almost got the hosts off to the perfect start when he flashed a shot inches over from Juanfran's cut-back in the first minute. However, the Spanish international was deadly accurate with his next chance as he rifled home his fifth goal of the season after Torres's initial effort had been blocked. Atletico's rock-solid defence was rarely troubled as they held out for a 30th clean sheet of the season, but Ruben Rochina was inches away from an equaliser on the half hour mark when he smashed a long-range shot against the post. All of Torres's goals in his last four outings have come from Koke assists and that combination worked a treat once more for Diego Simeone's men when the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker latched onto an inch-perfect pass before lifting the ball over the onrushing Andres Fernandez. Simeone then withdrew top-scorer Antoine Griezmann and Koke with Wednesday's difficult trip to Athletic Bilbao in mind. Correa was one of those introduced and the Argentine international showed great composure to slot home the third from Saul Niguez's flick-on. Elsewhere, Athletic Bilbao moved to within six points of Villarreal in the fight for the fourth Champions League place with a hard-fought 1-0 win at Malaga thanks to Raul Garcia's second-half header. Villarreal lost 2-1 at Rayo Vallecano in a result with huge ramifications at the bottom of the table. Miku's brilliant header handed the Madrid side all three points after Adrian Lopez had cancelled out Javi Guerra's early opener for Rayo. Victory moves Rayo five points clear of the relegation zone with just five games remaining. Sevilla will almost certainly have to win a third consecutive Europa League to make it back into the Champions League as they were held 1-1 at home to Deportivo la Coruna to stay 11 points behind Villarreal."

""I am very curious about this game, it will be big experience for all the players and the fans there will support their team for the full 90 minutes,"" added Guardiola. He has a perfect record of seven Champions League semi-final appearances in seven years with both Barcelona (from 2008-2012) and Bayern (2013-16). But Guardiola was full of praise for Atletico's Argentinian coach Diego Simeone, who steered his team to the 2014 Champions League final and knocked Barcelona out in the quarter-finals. While Atletico's forwards Fernando Torres and Antoine Griezmann tend to grab the headlines, Guadiola said Madrid's Uruguay defender Diego Godin and Slovenian goalkeeper Jan Oblak are the reasons they concede few goals. Guardiola praised Simeone, who took charge in 2011, for turning Atletico from Spanish league also-rans to the team which humbled Champions League holders Barcelona. ""I never trained with him or played against him (during my career), I don't know him and I've spoken to him perhaps twice,"" said Guardiola. ""But his players do exactly what he wants and they follow him without any doubts. ""He's perhaps one of the best coaches in the world. ""Over ten years Atletico didn't beat Real Madrid, then Simeone arrived and changed all that."" Bayern's veteran Spain international midfielder Alonso said the Germans can expect a tough test in Madrid and only a good performance will silence the local support. ""Like Pep, Simeone has a lot of passion. He's a good coach, but we'll have to blend all of that out and focus on ourselves,"" said Alonso. ""If we play well, then the atmosphere won't be a deciding factor. ""They don't concede many goals and there is always an unbelievable atmosphere for home matches. ""We want to make sure we get a good result from the first leg."" Sammer says Bayern will face two 'monsters of passion' in Atletico and Simeone. ""It will be extreme against Atletico and we have a lot of respect, but we also have a few players who can stop them and limit the tempo,"" said Bayern director of sport Matthias Sammer. ""Atletico are monsters of passion, they are honest and authentic, from what I have seen."" Bayern host Schalke on Saturday in the Bundesliga holding a seven point lead over second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Sammer says Bayern can not afford to give any more points away in their bid to become the first club to win four straight Bundesliga titles. He is convinced Dortmund's dramatic 4-3 defeat to Liverpool in the Europa League quarter-final, second leg, will only serve to boost their domestic performances. ""I say with full conviction; Dortmund will not give any more points away,"" he said. ""Their mourning from yesterday will be converted into energy, so Saturday's game against Schalke is like a final for us."""

Atletico, the Diego Simeone-coached team that knocked out defending champions Barcelona in the quarter-finals, and Bayern have previously met once in European action, in the 1974 final, the Bundesliga side running out 4-0 winners in the replay following an initial 1-1 draw. Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski said the Bundesliga team would be wary of Atletico. ""@Atleti did show the strength in the match with Barcelona. We must maintain maximum concentration,"" the Polish international tweeted. Bayern's Spain international Javi Martinez added: ""That will be a difficult game against a strong opponent."" For outgoing Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini, the semi-final will be a return to the club he managed in 2009-10. City's only games against Real, unbeaten in their last eight games against English clubs and in the semi-finals for a record sixth successive time, were in the 2012-13 group stage. They drew 1-1 at home and lost 3-2 away. City's sporting director Txiki Begiristain said: ""It's a great tie against the team that has won the competition the most times. ""But we have got this far and we want to keep dreaming."" The first leg of the semi-finals will be played on April 26-27, with the second leg scheduled for May 3-4. The final will take place at Milan's San Siro stadium on May 28."
434,14/04/2016,14:26,Semi-final line-up rekindles memories of Madrid derby final,For the fifth consecutive year two Spanish sides will contest the Champions League semi-finals as Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid eye a repeat of the Spanish capital derby in the final two years ago.,"However, Friday's draw at 0930 GMT in Nyon also offers the tantalising possibility of Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola facing his future employers Manchester City in the English side's debut at this stage of the competition. Atletico ended Barcelona's reign as champions with a 2-0 win over the holders in an eerily similar tie for Diego Simeone's men to their passage to the last four two years ago when they ousted Barca at the quarter-final stage. The similarities to 2014 don't end there as the final four was made up of Atletico, Real, Bayern and English involvement with City's place then taken by Chelsea. Real rolled over Guardiola's Bayern 5-0 on aggregate in the semis before snatching Atletico's first ever European Cup away from them with Sergio Ramos's stoppage time equaliser in Lisbon as they eventually ran out 4-1 winners after extra-time. ""We won't have anything easy. City have incredible financial power and Real Madrid and Bayern are historic teams in this competition,"" said Simeone. ""For Atletico to be among the four best teams in Europe is an important step, but just that, because we want more."" Real are relieved just to make it to a record sixth consecutive semi-final as they had to overturn a 2-0 first leg deficit to see off Wolfsburg on Tuesday 3-0 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick. Ronaldo's wish of a return to Portugal to face Benfica in the last four was ended as away goals from Arturo Vidal and Thomas Mueller ensured Bayern return to the semis looking to made amends for their thrashings at the hands of Real and Barca in the past two seasons. ""I know that Cristiano would have liked Benfica in the semi-finals, I am sorry for him,"" said Guardiola, who has now reached the semi-finals in all seven of his campaigns as a coach. ""We've achieved our objective and now we want to get to the final. ""From what I read in Germany it would seem that if I leave without winning the Champions League my work will have been incomplete."" Despite bowing out to Spanish opposition in the past two years, a visit to future employers City could prove even more awkward for Guardiola than a return to his homeland. The 45-year-old Catalan will assume his role at the Etihad next season, but outgoing City boss Manuel Pellegrini has again demonstrated he is a Champions League specialist having also guided Villarreal to their sole semi-final appearance in 2006 and Malaga to the quarter-finals in 2013. ""To be in the semi-finals is a great achievement,"" said Kevin de Bruyne, City's match winner against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday. ""But it is not done yet. We are looking forward to the semis. It is only two games away from the final. We will try to do everything to reach the final."""
435,14/04/2016,02:59,Slumping Barca must bounce back - Enrique,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique admitted his side are suffering a slump in form after a third defeat in four games saw them dumped out of the Champions League by Atletico Madrid.,"Antoine Griezmann struck twice for Atletico in a 2-0 win Wednesday to seal their passage to the last four at Barcelona's expense for the second time in three years, 3-2 on aggregate. ""It is clear that we are not in our best form, especially if you consider how we were playing before, but we need to lift ourselves,"" said Enrique, whose side's dreams of a treble were dashed. Barca had gone 39 games without tasting defeat before losing back-to-back La Liga games to Real Madrid and Real Sociedad to leave Atletico also breathing down their necks just three points behind in the title race with six games remaining. Enrique's men will return to the Vicente Calderon in May for the Copa del Rey final and he insisted a league and Cup double would still mean a successful season despite missing the chance to become the first side to retain Europe's top trophy since it became the Champions League in 1992. ""The team wanted to retain the title, it was one our objectives and excited every Barca fan, but it isn't to be,"" said Enrique. ""We are finding it much more difficult than normal to score goals and suffering defensively too. We all have to improve and I'm the first one in that regard,"" he added. ""The objectives for Barcelona are always the highest possible. We should be proud that Barca are always favourites for everything. ""We understand that we have to accept defeat, we have other competitions coming up that we can win. For any coach in the world to win two titles is a successful season."" Victory ended Atletico's seven-game losing streak against Barca dating back to when the Madrid club sealed their La Liga title at the Camp Nou in 2014. Diego Simeone's men also reached the Champions League final that season before losing in heartbreaking fashion to local rivals Real Madrid in the final. Real lie in wait once more along with Bayern Munich and Manchester City in Friday's semi-final draw. Simeone is determined Atletico's journey towards a first Champions League title won't end in the last four. ""I don't have any thought for the semi-finals other than winning,"" he said. ""We won't have anything easy. City have incredible financial power and Real Madrid and Bayern are historic teams in this competition. ""For Atletico to be among the four best teams in Europe is an important step, but just that, because we want more."" Griezmann was Atletico's hero as he took his tally for the season to 29 in all competitions with a towering first-half header before sealing the tie from the penalty spot two minutes from time. However, the Frenchman was quick to laud the collective effort of his side as they shut out Barca's fearsome front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar for their 29th clean sheet of the season. ""Everyone works hard defensively and tactically we are nearly perfect,"" said Griezmann. ""We are very happy tonight. I'm happy because I scored two goals and tomorrow we won't talk about these two goals but the great effort of the team to be in the semi-finals."""
436,13/04/2016,22:53,Griezmann double dumps Barca out of Europe,Atletico Madrid dumped holders Barcelona out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage for the second time in three seasons as Antoine Griezmann's double sealed a 2-0 win on Wednesday to progress 3-2 on aggregate.,"Griezmann put the hosts ahead on away goals with a fine first-half header before converting from the penalty spot two minutes from time after Andres Iniesta had handled inside the area. Barca, meanwhile, were left to rue referee Nicola Rizzoli's decision to give a free-kick on the edge of the box in injury time instead of a penalty when Gabi appeared to be inside the area as he was penalised for handball. Defeat is Barca's third in four games after a 39-match unbeaten run stretching back six months and sees their quest to become the first side to retain the competition in the Champions League era come to an end. Roared on by a vociferous 55,000-strong crowd at the Vicente Calderon, Atletico were worthy winners as Barca's star front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar were limited to precious few clear-cut chances. Atletico will be joined by local rivals Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayern Munich in Friday's semi-final draw. The home side were far the better team before the break as captain Gabi fired over before Griezmann placed his first big headed chance from Filipe Luis's cross too close to Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Messi's most significant involvement in the first 45 minutes saw him scurrying deep into his own half to dispossess Yannick Carrasco in a sign of the five-time World Player of the Year's desperation to get into the game. Atletico made the all-important breakthrough nine minutes before half-time when Griezmann's header was this time precise and powerful enough to beat Ter Stegen from Saul Niguez's brilliant cross. The goal awoke Barca sufficiently to force Jan Oblak into his first save of the evening from Neymar's curling effort. Ter Stegen ensured Barca went in at the break just one goal down as he held a Carrasco drive at the second attempt before Niguez could follow in for the rebound. Atletico had two more chances to extend their advantage early in the second period as Koke's cut-back was cut out by Gerard Pique with Griezmann waiting for a tap in. And then as Barca struggled to clear a corner, Niguez's looping header came back off the crossbar with Ter Stegen stranded. Griezmann had another chance to give Atletico a cushion but fired straight at Ter Stegen on his weaker right foot at the end of a lightening counter-attack. However, Barca began to impose themselves in the final half hour as Atletico tired and Suarez tested Oblak with a fierce effort from inside the area that the Slovenian handled impressively. Suarez was lucky to escape a red card in the first leg after clashing with Juanfran and Filipe Luis and got off lightly once more when he was just shown a yellow card for elbowing Uruguayan international teammate Diego Godin. Neymar was also booked for kicking out at Juanfran moments later as Barca began to lose their cool. Iniesta was also lucky not to be sent-off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity as he blocked Luis's pass into Griezmann's path for the penalty. The French international kept his head to slot home the resulting spot-kick. However, there was still time for late controversy as Rizzoli only awarded Barca a free-kick on the edge of the box as Gabi handled. Messi's free-kick drifted inches over and with it Barca's chances of a second consecutive treble were gone."
437,13/04/2016,22:50,Bayern see off Benfica to reach semis,"Bayern Munich came out on top in an entertaining Champions League last-eight clash with Benfica, reaching the semi-finals with a 3-2 aggregate victory, after a second-leg 2-2 draw in Lisbon on Wednesday.","Pep Guardiola took his German champions to the Estadio Da Luz with a 1-0 first-leg lead thanks to Aruto Vidal's early strike at the Allianz Arena last week. After a slow start to the game, Benfica drew back onto level terms in the tie in the 27th minute, as Raul Jimenez escaped the Bayern defence to nod past Manuel Neuer. But Vidal smashed home his second goal of the quarter-final tie seven minutes before half-time to leave Rui Vitoria's Benfica needing two unanswered goals to progress. The tie appeared all but over shortly after the restart when Thomas Mueller pounced in trademark fashion. Benfica did manage to create a grandstand finale of sorts through Talisca's set-piece, but it could have been more exciting had Bayern's Javi Martinez been sent off for the cynical foul that lead to the free-kick. Five-time winners Bayern progress to the last four for the sixth time in the last seven seasons, leaving their opponents without a semi-final appearance in Europe's premier club competition since 1990. Benfica were undisputed underdogs, and they started this match not just with a deficit to overturn, but without three key forwards. Top scorer Jonas, who has scored 32 goals this season, was ruled out through suspension, while Nicolas Gaitan and Greek Kostas Mitroglou failed to recover from injuries. Roared on by the home crowd, the hosts started quickly and Bayern centre-back Joshua Kimmich did well to deflect a free-kick behind. After Vidal headed tamely at Ederson Moraes, in the side with regular goalkeeper Julio Cesar still sidelined, Benfica struck almost from nowhere. Eliseu skipped forward from left-back, before chipping in a delicious cross which was headed home by Jimenez for his third Champions League goal of the campaign. Bayern were rocked and Jimenez should have put Benfica in front on aggregate just a couple of minutes after opening the scoring. The former Atletico Madrid man was given far too much room inside the visitors' penalty area, but he stabbed a weak effort straight at Neuer. Just when the Portuguese champions were starting to gain a measure of control, Vidal pounced to put Bayern firmly in the driver's seat. Captain Philipp Lahm timed his run in behind to perfection and his cross was only palmed as far as Vidal by stand-in goalkeeper Ederson, and the Chilean did the rest with a thumping left-footed finish. World Cup winner Mueller pounced in the 53rd minute after Martinez headed Xabi Alonso's corner across the face of goal, to effectively seal Bayern's place in the semi-finals with his eighth goal in Europe this term. Benfica were suddenly stretched and Douglas Costa raced clear of a flat-footed home defence, only to see his low effort bounce back off the post. The Bavarians were given a huge slice of luck when Martinez hacked down Benfica substitute Goncalo Guedes when the teenager was clean through on goal, but only saw yellow. Brazilian Talisca, who had also come off the bench, delightfully curled the resulting free-kick out of Neuer's reach and into the top corner to give Benfica a glimmer of hope. Vitoria's men continued to attack in a spirited display, but after Talisca narrowly missed with another free-kick, they ran out of steam."
438,13/04/2016,19:52,Torres ban hands striking role to Carrasco,Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone opted for Belgian winger Yannick Carrasco to compensate for the absence of Fernando Torres up front as his side look to dump Barcelona out at the quarter-final stage of the Champions League for the second time in three seasons.,"Torres is suspended after being sent off in the first half of the first leg eight days ago after firing Atletico into an early lead. Barca fought back through two Luis Suarez goals to hold a precarious 2-1 lead as they look to continue their quest to become the first side to retain the Champions League. Augusto Fernandez comes in for Torres in the only change to both sides' starting line-ups from the first leg. The Argentine will start in midfield with Carrasco moving further forward to partner Antoine Griezmann in attack. An alarming dip in form has seen Barca take just one point from a possible nine in La Liga. However, coach Luis Enrique keeps faith with his preferred European 11 as Suarez, Jordi Alba, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta return to the side that started Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Real Sociedad.

439,13/04/2016,02:30,"Atletico, Benfica out to upset Champions League odds","Atletico Madrid and Benfica are both looking to turn around small first-leg deficits in their Champions League quarter-final home matches on Wednesday, and in the process blow the competition wide open.","Atletico go into the return leg against reigning champions Barcelona at the Vicente Calderon 2-1 down, while Benfica welcome German champions Bayern Munich to Lisbon after an opening 1-0 defeat. Fernando Torres' red card and a Luis Suarez brace turned the all-Spanish tie on its head, although the Torres away goal keeps Atletico well in contention for a semi-final spot. Diego Simeone's Los Rojiblancos lost to city rivals Real Madrid in the final two years ago and are desperate to go one better, although they have lost their last seven meetings with Barca. But the Catalan giants have shown signs of fallibility in recent weeks, with back-to-back league defeats seeing their La Liga lead cut to just three points over the capital city side. ""In a scenario like tomorrow all that has happened in the past is forgotten at the start of the game,"" said Atletico coach Simeone. ""Then as the game develops certain situations may develop that are repeated (from previous games)."" Suarez will return for Barca after being banned for the weekend loss at Real Sociedad, but former Liverpool striker Torres, who has scored in his last three games, is suspended. ""We need to overcome the absence of Fernando and control a marvellous footballer like Suarez,"" said Simeone. ""Fernando will offer us a lot between now and the end of the season, he has improved a lot in this final part of the season,"" added Atletico captain Gabi. ""But Atletico have always overcome the absences of big players."" Benfica also have a key forward missing through suspension. Jonas has scored 32 goals in all competitions this season, but the Brazilian's yellow card in Bavaria means that the Portuguese champions will be looking to Greek Kostas Mitroglou and Raul Jimenez to provide the goals needed to turn the tie around. Rui Vitoria's side are also waiting on the fitness of key attacking midfielder Nicolas Gaitan, with the Argentine struggling with a thigh problem. ""We will make a decision tomorrow. We will need to wait until kick-off time to see if he is available,"" Benfica coach Vitoria told a press conference on the eve of the game. ""We managed to ensure that the tie will be decided at home but it will still be extremely difficult for us to go through. ""We will be coming up against a very strong team who are used to playing in matches like these and are contenders to win the trophy."" Bayern, who last won the trophy in 2013, are still firm favourites to progress thanks to Arturo Vidal's second-minute strike in Bavaria last week. Outgoing coach Pep Guardiola, who will join Manchester City at the end of the season, is still on track to match the feat of Jupp Heynckes and win the treble of Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League in his final campaign at the Allianz Arena. ""We will go out there to defend well and try to score a goal to go through,"" the Spaniard told a press conference on Tuesday. ""Tactically we know what we need to do. Above all we will need to show great character in front of more than 60,000 spectators."" While Bayern and Barca have both won Europe's elite competition on five occasions, only Real and AC Milan have won more, they will have their work cut out to join Manchester City and Real Madrid in the last four."
440,12/04/2016,19:26,"Barca confidence not shaken by blip, insists Messi",Five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi insists Barcelona's belief hasn't been affected by a poor run of form as they travel to Atletico Madrid on Wednesday holding a precarious 2-1 first-leg lead in their Champions League quarter-final.,"A run of just one point from their last three La Liga games has seen Atletico close to within three points of Barca at the top of La Liga. ""Our mindset remains the same,"" Messi wrote on his official Facebook page. ""We work hard all year to have a chance of winning trophies at the end of the season. We continue to believe in ourselves."" Barca remain on course to repeat their treble feat of last season and become the first side to retain the Champions League in the process. However, the European champions also had luck on their side to ensure the narrowest of first-leg leads as Fernando Torres was sent off for two rash challenges before half-time at the Camp Nou, after firing Atletico into an early lead. By contrast, Luis Suarez went unpunished despite aiming a kick at Juanfran and clashing with Filipe Luis off the ball. Suarez went on to turn the game around with Barca's two goals after the break to take his tally for the season to 45 in 45 games. The Uruguayan's presence was badly missed as Barca slipped to a 1-0 defeat at Real Sociedad, with the former Liverpool striker suspended. And Suarez's influence has turned the rivalry with Atletico on its head over the past two seasons as Barca have won the last seven meetings between the two. However, Atletico previously enjoyed a six-game unbeaten run against the Catalans, including a 1-0 win at the Vicente Calderon to eliminate Barca at this stage of the competition two years ago. ""You always try and improve game-to-game against them,"" Atletico boss Diego Simeone said on Tuesday. ""Within the characteristics we have we'll look for the variations we can to cause them problems and, most importantly, win the game."" And Simeone hopes his side can prey on slight faults in Barca's game that have been punished in recent weeks by Real Madrid and Real Sociedad after a 39-game unbeaten run. ""In a scenario like tomorrow all that has happened in the past is forgotten at the start of the game,"" said the Argentine. ""Then as the game develops certain situations may develop that are repeated (from previous games)."" Atletico will miss the on-form Torres, who has scored in his last three games, through suspension. ""We need to overcome the absence of Fernando and control a marvellous footballer like Suarez,"" added Simeone. ""Fernando will offer us a lot between now and the end of the season, he has improved a lot in this final part of the season,"" said Atletico captain Gabi. ""But Atletico have always overcome the absence of big players."" Torres's absence is likely to be the only change in the Atletico team from the first leg with Augusto Fernandez bolstering the midfield and Yannick Carrasco moving into a more advanced position. Barca are set to be unchanged from the first meeting between the sides as Gerard Pique has shrugged off a hip injury to be included in Luis Enrique's 19-man squad."
441,09/04/2016,23:03,"Barca beaten again at Sociedad, Atletico, Real apply pressure",Barcelona suffered a second consecutive La Liga defeat to blow the title race wide open as Mikel Oyarzabal's header handed Real Sociedad a 1-0 win over the European champions on Saturday.,"Atletico Madrid are now only three points behind Barca after goals from the on-form Fernando Torres, Antoine Griezmann and Koke saw them come from behind to win 3-1 at Espanyol. Cristiano Ronaldo also kept Real Madrid in the hunt a further point back in third with a goal and two assists in a 4-0 rout of Eibar. Barca still need to drop points in two of their last six games thanks to their better head-to-head record with Atletico. However, the pressure is now firmly on the Catalans after tasting defeat for the second time in a week after seeing a 39-game unbeaten run snapped by Real Madrid last weekend. ""It is an exciting and open league which the best team will win,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""We played very badly in the first half. In football at this level against a team that defends like Real Sociedad defended we needed much more order, control and possession to do damage to the opponent."" Barcelona have now not won in their last seven visits to Sociedad and lost each of their last four league meetings in San Sebastian. Just as in last season's 1-0 win under the tutelage of David Moyes, Sociedad made the perfect start as 18-year-old Oyarzabal soared to power home Xabi Prieto's cross into the far corner. Barca were without the suspended Luis Suarez and badly missed the 45-goal Uruguayan's presence as they struggled to create clear-cut chances. Luis Enrique had rested Andres Iniesta, Ivan Rakitic and Jordi Alba with one eye on the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final at Atletico on Wednesday. However, all three were called upon as Barca chased the game after the break and Geronimo Rulli had to produce a brilliant save to prevent Iniesta's left-footed drive finding the top corner. Rulli came to Sociedad's rescue once more to deny Messi his 500th career goal from close range moments later. And Rulli saved from Messi and Iniesta once more late on to seal a three points celebrated as wildly in Madrid as by the home fans at Anoeta. Real Madrid bounced back from their Champions League embarrassment against Wolfsburg in midweek despite coach Zinedine Zidane making eight changes as they look to overturn a 2-0 deficit against the Germans at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday. ""I'm happy with the way we played, more in the first half than the second,"" said Zidane. ""We know what awaits us and what we are playing for on Tuesday. Now we just have to rest and prepare well."" Despite the changes, the hosts were always comfortable against the Basque minnows from the moment Rodriguez smashed home a sumptuous free-kick after just five minutes. Ronaldo showed he was in a generous mood on 18 minutes when he unselfishly squared for Vazquez to turn home the second. A typically clinical Madrid counter-attack followed just two minutes later as Jese bore down on goal before teeing up Ronaldo to smash home his 30th La Liga goal of the season and extend his lead to four over Suarez in the battle to be the league's top scorer. The roles were reversed for the fourth just before the break as this time Ronaldo picked out Jese's unmarked run to the far post to leave the Spanish under-21 international with the simplest of finishes. In contrast to Enrique and Zidane, Atletico boss Diego Simeone named his strongest available side and was rewarded with a vital win as his side stormed back from Pape Diop's opener for Espanyol. ""We are giving it everything we have. We are intense, persistent and we keep fighting,"" said Simeone. Torres latched onto Koke's through ball before firing low into the net for this third goal in as many games to equalise 10 minutes before the break. Griezmann completed the comeback when he drilled another Koke assist in off the far post just before the hour mark for his 20th La Liga goal of the season. Atletico then had a series of chances to kill the game on the counter-attack, but had to wait until two minutes from time for their third when Koke stooped to head home Torres's cross."

""They don't scare us, but they are having an spectacular season. At the moment they are the second best team in Spain, as the league shows,"" Pique said on Monday. ""It will be more difficult than Saturday because they are a team that sits deep and breaks well on the counter-attack. ""In the end it depends on us. If from the first minute we want the ball, move it quickly, the fans are with us like they were on Saturday, and it all comes together, I think we are almost unstoppable."" Often keen to spice up the rivalry between Barca and Real Madrid, Pique had put the hosts in front at the weekend before goals from Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo turned the game around. Barca paid homage to legendary former player and coach Johan Cruyff before the game and Pique claimed the Dutch great's legacy had been to turn the rivalry between Madrid and Barca around as the Catalans go in search of a second consecutive treble. ""We need to be confident in ourselves. If we talk about Cruyff, he arrived in 1988 (as coach) when I was one-year-old,"" added Pique. ""When he arrived, beating Madrid saved Barcelona's season, it was our goal. Now we are in 2016 and the roles have changed."" Indeed, despite a first defeat in six months, Barca are still well-placed to repeat their treble feat as they also face Sevilla in the final of the Copa del Rey on May 22. ""The game on Saturday is forgotten. What concerns me is winning La Liga, the Champions League and the Copa del Rey,"" Pique continued. ""Everything is well-set and I am convinced we are going to win. We lost a game, we congratulate them and move on. This team is capable of winning everything. ""We have all the ingredients to play a great game tomorrow."" Barca boss Luis Enrique insisted he has ""blind faith"" in his players and his side's style of play despite being consistently caught out by Real's prowess on the counter-attack even when Barca were leading at the weekend. Atletico knocked Barca out at this stage of the competition two years ago on their way to the final. However, Enrique has won all six of his meetings as coach against Diego Simeone's men since taking charge at the start of last season. ""Atletico Madrid are a top team with a clear style of play,"" said Enrique. ""That is why they are where they are, competing with Barca and Madrid despite not having the same financial conditions. ""It doesn't matter what happened on Saturday, they are an opponent that will make our lives difficult."" Enrique is expected to make only one change with Marc-Andre ter Stegen replacing Claudio Bravo in goal. Atletico boss Diego Simeone confirmed Fernando Torres will start up front for the visitors after scoring in a 5-1 rout of Real Betis on Saturday. However, Atletico have big problems at the centre of their normally rock-solid defence. Diego Godin is expected to shrug of a hamstring injury to start, but with Stefan Savic and Jose Maria Gimenez doubtful, 20-year-old Lucas Hernandez looks set to face Barca's fearsome front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar."

""@JoseMaGimenez13 has a hamstring muscle injury in the back of the right thigh,"" Atletico said on their official Twitter account. Uruguay travel to face Brazil on March 25 before hosting Peru four days later. Simeone said he had rejected Gimenez's request to continue at El Molinon as Atletico's faint remaining hopes of the La Liga title faded away. Barcelona can extend their lead over Atletico at the top to 11 points with just eight games to play with victory at Villarreal on Sunday. ""He said that he felt he had torn (the hamstring) and we are not going to continue tearing a leg,"" said Simeone. Godin also suffered the recurrence of a hamstring problem as Atletico saw off PSV Eindhoven to make the last eight of the Champions League on Tuesday. Both now face a race to be fit for the first-leg of Atletico's quarter-final away to Barcelona on April 5."

However, Atletico felt the after effects of their efforts in seeing off PSV Eindhoven after extra-time and penalties in the Champions League in midweek as Antonio Sanabria and Carlos Castro turned the game around in the final stages. Barcelona can now move 11 points clear at the top when they travel to Villarreal on Sunday. Third-placed Real Madrid can also close the gap on Atletico to a point when they host Sevilla. ""We were always clear that the objective of the club is to be in the top three,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""That is what we are working towards. This defeat goes against any aspiration to be champions."" Simeone named a youthful side with an average age of 23 as he made five changes from the team that started against PSV on Tuesday. Atletico have often felt they have been prejudiced by the scheduling of their La Liga fixtures around European games this season. And Simeone hinted at his frustration at having to play at early on Saturday, whilst Barcelona and Real Madrid aren't in action till Sunday. ""I don't like to look for excuses. I'm happy that we are premium, we play at four o'clock and they see us in China,"" he added ironically. Griezmann retained his place up front and was once again Atletico's only serious goal threat as he opened the scoring just before the half hour mark. Sporting had reason to feel hard done by as Pablo Perez looked to have taken the ball before making contact with Saul Niguez on the edge of the area. And there was no stopping Griezmann's effort from the resulting free-kick as he curled the ball over the wall and into the top corner. Simeone looked to hold out for the three points as he withdrew his three most attacking players in Griezmann, Angel Correa and Luciano Vietto after the break. However, for once Atletico's defensive resilience let them down. Sanabria fired a warning shot when he struck the post from a free-kick 12 minutes from time. But presented with a similar opportunity a minute later, the Paraguayan rifled a free-kick through the Atletico wall to leave Jan Oblak unsighted. Castro missed a glorious chance to make it 2-1 four minutes from time when he smashed Sanabria's unselfish square ball off the bar in front of an open goal. Of further concern for Atletico was that opportunity came about as Jose Maria Gimenez pulled up with a hamstring injury making him a doubt for the first-leg of their Champions League quarter-final away to Barcelona on April 5. With Simeone having made all three substitutions, the visitors had to see out the final few minutes with 10 men. And they couldn't do it as Sanabria again burst down the left and this time his low cross was converted at the far post by the relieved Castro."
447,18/03/2016,13:05,Barca out to avenge Atletico in Champions League quarters,Holders Barcelona and their feared attacking trident drew fellow Spaniards and 2014 finalists Atletico Madrid in the Champions League last eight on Friday.,"Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar, Barcelona's feared attacking trio, will seek revenge for their 2-1 aggregate quarter-finals exit at the hands of Diego Simeone's formidable charges two seasons ago. ""With Atletico Madrid everything is complicated,"" said Barcelona representative Javier Bordas, who was in Nyon for the draw. ""Their strengths are well known. They are water-tight at the back and can hurt you in attack,"" he said of the side who have shipped just three goals in the competition so far. ""They are our number one rival in the Spanish league, I don't believe there was a tougher side we could have drawn. We know this is going to be really tough."" Atletico eliminated Barca 2-1 on aggregate in the quarter-finals on their way to the 2014 Champions League final. That season Atletico went unbeaten in six games against Barca, but since then the Catalans have won all six meetings between the sides. But while Atletico coach Diego Simeone was unflinching he heaped praise on his rivals, and if he was worried he was not showing it. ""I have said before, they work more on set-pieces, they have more counter-attacks, Neymar has been there longer, the presence of Suarez, they are a different team with more options,"" he said. ""Barcelona are the best in the world for sure and what can be better for us than playing against the best in the world? It makes me very excited."" In another tantalising pair up new money outfits Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain face off after Swedish giant Zlatan Ibrahimovic's side toppled Chelsea in the last round. It is a first ever quarter-finals for City. PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaïfi was confident his side, fresh from wrapping up a fourth straight French Ligue 1 title in record time, can get to their first Champions League semi-final in twenty years. ""In the quarter-finals there are only good teams left. We have enormous respect for Manchester City, But I believe our players will produce another big European performance. I'm convinced we can keep up the pace that saw us overcome Chelsea and offer our supporters a first semi-final since 1995,"" he said. Having overcome Juventus in a dramatic come back in midweek five-time European champions Bayern Munich will have been relieved to have drawn Portugal's Benfica. Bayern winger Franck Ribéry warned there was no room for complacency even if the Germans, led by Pep Guardiola in his last season before a switch to Manchester City, are unlikely to lose any sleep over the pair up. ""We will have to remain very focussed, it's the quarter-finals, you don't take these matches lightly. After the group games you never have an easy match,"" said the Frenchman. ""We need a good result in the first game at home. But it's a great draw for us,"" he said. Zinedine Zidane's ten-time winners Real Madrid and the Champions League's runaway top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo (13 goals), drew Germans Wolfsburg, with the added comfort of playing at home in the second leg against the quarter-final débutants. Emilio Butragueno the Real Madrid director of institutional relations, warned against complacency however. ""They are a German team, they are in the quarter-finals for the first time and they motivation in playing us will be huge. ""We know what it means in Europe to commit a single error and we hope to be back here for the semi-finals. There was conversely a sense of glee at Wolfsburg, whose directors beamed with delight as the draw was made. ""We can't wait"" said Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking. ""For Wolfsburg, the fans and the club it's a wonderful draw. Real Madrid are a massive side but you've always got a chance."" The two legs of the quarter-finals will be played between April 5-13, with the semi-finals on April 26/27 and May 3/4. The final will take place in Milan on May 28."
448,17/03/2016,16:11,Europe's big guns ready for quarter-final draw,The draw for the Champions League quarter-finals in Switzerland on Friday promises to throw up plenty of tantalising ties in the first stage of the competition where any two teams can face each other.,"Restrictions on clubs from the same country facing off are lifted for the last eight, bringing the chance of either an all-German or all-Spanish clash. Defending champions Barcelona are firm favourites for the title after a comfortable 5-1 aggregate victory over Arsenal in the last 16, although no side has ever retained the European crown since it moved to its current guise of the Champions League. That suggests a title defence is harder than it may seem, and the likes of Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain are all expected to challenge Luis Enrique's men for the trophy to be played for in Milan on May 28. The most thrilling climax to a last 16 second leg was saved until last, as five-time champions Bayern produced a thrilling fight-back on Wednesday to knock out last season's runners-up Juventus in extra-time. Bayern legend and CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge on Thursday proclaimed his disappointment that two sides of the stature of the German and Italian champions could meet so early in the tournament. ""What I do not like at all is that it is all dependent on the draw,"" he said. ""UEFA should consider whether or not it should bring in seeding or something like that. It's no longer acceptable, I'm tired of fate."" With murmurs of the traditionally bigger clubs breaking away to form a European Super League, Rummenigge's ideas may be supported by some of the sides in the last eight hat. But the likes of Wolfsburg and Benfica, who could still potentially go head-to-head in the quarters, are unlikely to want any such seeding process. Wolfsburg reached this stage in Europe's premier competition for the first time by seeing off Belgian surprise packages Gent, who battled hard but to no avail in a 4-2 aggregate loss. Benfica, although they are two-time winners, have not won any continental trophy since their second European Cup back in 1962. Despite Rummenigge's views, Bayern head coach Pep Guardiola has said that he does ""not care"" who the Bavarians are drawn against in the next round. The Spaniard, who led Barcelona to two Champions League titles during his time in charge at the Camp Nou, will join Manchester City at the end of the season and could even be pitted against his future employers -- who eased past Dynamo Kiev to progress further than ever before. ""I don't care who we play next. If you want to reach the semi-finals then you have to be ready to beat any opponent,"" said Guardiola, for whom Thomas Mueller's 90th-minute equaliser protected a record of having never failed to reach the last eight as a coach. While many eyes will be on the possibility of an El Clasico showdown, Atletico Madrid's dramatic penalty shoot-out victory over PSV Eindhoven means that Spain have the most quarter-final representatives for the fifth successive season. The last country to provide more than two sides at this stage was England in 2011, but Premier League outfits have struggled in recent years. English champions Chelsea fell to their French counterparts PSG for the second season in a row, this time losing both matches 2-1. The draw takes place at UEFA headquarters in Nyon at 1100GMT."

According to Spanish press reports, Godin is expected to be sidelined for at least three weeks. That would rule the 30-year-old out of Uruguay's visit to Brazil on March 25 and meeting with Peru in Montevideo on March 29. Uruguay have made a positive start to their qualifying campaign with three wins from their first four games and will be able to call upon Luis Suarez for the first time since the 2014 World Cup for a competitive fixture after his nine-match international ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini. Godin also looks set to miss Atletico's La Liga clashes with Sporting Gijon and Real Betis. However, of greater concern for coach Diego Simeone will be whether the inspirational central defender will be fit for the first leg of Atletico's quarter-final on April 5 or 6. Simeone's men will find out who they will face in the last eight on Friday. Atletico sit eight points adrift of Barcelona in second in La Liga with nine games to play."
450,16/03/2016,01:55,Belief key to Atletico's penalty success - Simeone,Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone hailed his side's belief as they edged out a brave effort from PSV Eindhoven to reach the Champions League finals 8-7 in an agonising penalty shootout on Tuesday.,"Neither side was able to break the deadlock across 210 minutes of the two-legged tie. However, Atletico were clinical from the spot as they converted all of their penalties with Juanfran slotting home the winner after Luciano Narsingh hit the crossbar with PSV's eighth attempt. ""It was an enormous celebration for the whole stadium,"" said Simeone. ""The spectacle you see in the stands was tremendous. We won't ever stop believing, that is for sure."" It is the second consecutive season that Atletico have progressed to the last eight on penalties after overcoming Bayer Leverkusen in similar fashion last season. Yet, despite Atletico's spectacular efficiency from the spot, Simeone insisted they hadn't practised penalties beforehand. And he said the credit should go to his assistant German Burgos for deciding which players should take the responsibility. ""We don't practise penalties. It isn't the same to do it with all the fans behind the goal, the tension of the game and 120 minutes in the legs,"" he added. ""It is an act that shows personality, authority and decisiveness. ""German did it against Leverkusen and he did it again today. All the congratulations should be for him because it isn't easy to choose."" Right-back Juanfran was Atletico's unlikely hero, but he also hailed the belief installed by Simeone as the key to their success. ""It was a heart-stopping tie,"" he said. ""We believe, our coach makes us believe and we have a lot of hunger and heart."" Atletico fell just short against city rivals Real Madrid in last season's quarter-finals and most memorably in the 2014 final when they were a minute away from winning the competition for the first time. Juanfran is hoping to avoid Madrid and La Liga leaders Barcelona in Friday's quarter-final draw. ""I don't want to draw a Spanish side,"" he added. ""Whoever we get will be very strong and it will be tie just like this one."" PSV coach Phillip Cocu admitted he was left with a bittersweet taste having seen his young side match one of Europe heavyweights over the two legs and come so close to a place in the quarter-finals for the first time in nine years. ""There are mixed emotions. On the one hand I am very proud. We played well in the two games, but especially here,"" he said. ""Tactically we played very well with a lot of discipline. ""We were close to the quarter-finals in the penalties, so there is also great disappointment."" ""If we had scored, the chances of going through were huge. They would have needed to score two and we defended well. ""We needed a little bit of luck. With the few chances we had you have to be clinical and in the end we couldn't score."""
451,15/03/2016,23:35,Atletico edge out PSV in penalty thriller,"Juanfran's winning penalty sent Atletico Madrid into the Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday, clinching an agonising 8-7 penalty shoot-out win over PSV Eindhoven after neither side could manage a goal in 210 minutes across the two legs of the tie.","The first 14 spot-kicks of the shootout were then converted in clinical fashion before PSV's Luciano Narsingh smashed his effort against the bar. Juanfran then stepped up to convert the winning penalty and keep Atletico's hopes of a first ever Champions League victory alive. It is the second consecutive season that Diego Simeone's men have progressed to the last eight on penalties after seeing off Bayer Leverkusen in similar fashion a year ago. And PSV will be left to lament Jan Oblak's brilliant save to tip Jurgen Locadia's effort onto the post in the second-half of normal time as the Dutch champions came so close to causing a huge upset. With the tie delicately balanced, Simeone opted for an extra midfielder in Augusto Fernandez in place of Luciano Vietto from the start, but the hosts were overrun for the first half hour by the visitors. However, Atletico did enjoy the best chance of the first-half when Koke's low cross found Antoine Griezmann unmarked just six yards out, but Jeroen Zoet got down to deny the French international his 24th goal of the season. PSV had captain and top scorer Luuk de Jong back after he missed the first-leg through suspension and the former Newcastle United striker was a constant menace to the usually unflappable Diego Godin. De Jong was unfortunate when the ball fell just behind him after Oblak cut out dangerous cross from the right. Atletico settled into their stride at the start of the second-half, but still relied on a set-piece to carve out an opportunity as Jose Maria Gimenez rose highest at the back post only to head Koke's corner inches wide. As the hosts opened up, though, PSV became even more of a threat on the counter-attack and were somehow denied the vital away goal on the hour mark when Locadia's shot was brilliantly tipped onto the post by Oblak and De Jong's follow-up header from point-black range blocked on the line by Filipe Luis. Luis stung the palms of Zoet from outside the area and Yannick Carrasco blasted the rebound over on the volley as Atletico struck back moments later. Simeone sent on Fernando Torres for Fernandez in an attempt to break the deadlock. The former Liverpool and Chelsea striker at least offered Atletico more of a reference point in attack and twice came close with an attempt lob which landed on the roof of the net before Zoet palmed away his fierce near post drive. Atletico suffered a huge blow just before the end of normal time when Godin limped off to be replaced by 20-year-old Lucas Hernandez. However, the young Frenchman had a great chance to make himself a hero early in extra time when he headed over from a corner. Griezmann's range was off again when he shot straight at Zoet after great work by Saul Niguez as Atletico dominated during the first period of extra time. Yet, it was PSV who came closest after the break, but Andres Guardado curled just wide to send the game to penalties."
452,15/03/2016,20:12,Carrasco joins Griezmann in Atletico attack,Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone handed a rare start up front to Belgian winger Yannick Carrasco for his side's crucial Champions League last-16 clash with PSV Eindhoven on Tuesday.,"The tie is finely balanced at 0-0 after the first leg in the Netherlands three weeks ago. Carrasco impressed in a forward role alongside top scorer Antoine Griezmann in Atletico's 2-1 defeat to Barcelona in January, but missed the first leg due to an ankle injury. Argentine midfielder Augusto Fernandez replaces compatriot Luciano Vietto in Simeone's only change from Saturday's 3-0 win over Deportivo la Coruna.

453,14/03/2016,21:06,Simeone wary of PSV's counter threat to Atletico,Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone has warned of PSV Eindhoven's threat on the counter-attack as the Spanish side seek to reach the Champions League quarter-finals for the third consecutive season on Tuesday.,"The tie is finely balanced at 0-0 ahead of PSV's trip to the Vicente Calderon, where Atletico have only conceded in three of 14 Champions League games under Simeone. However, the Argentine is wary that with a full house of 55,000 expected to put the onus on Atletico to attack, they could be caught out by a vital away goal for the Dutch champions. ""I think that PSV's best quality is the counter-attack,"" said Simeone. ""With spaces they work very well and have players that arrive late into the box."" Atletico will be at full-strength as Fernando Torres has shrugged off the knee injury which saw him miss Saturday's 3-0 win over Deportivo la Coruna. However, the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker is expected to start on the bench with Yannick Carrasco and Luciano Vietto set to partner Atletico's top scorer Antoine Griezmann in attack. And Atletico captain Gabi admitted progress once more to the last eight is vital to the club's growth both on and off the pitch since Simeone's arrival four years ago. ""Tomorrow is decisive and we have the obligation to get the result we need in front of our fans,"" he said. ""We know what is at stake for the fans and the club. Our progress in this competition is very important and we are in great form heading into tomorrow."" Indeed, Atletico have scored three times in three consecutive La Liga games for the first time in a year and beaten Real Madrid since the sides last met three weeks ago. However, PSV midfielder Andres Guardado admitted it is breaching Atletico's rock-solid defence which remains his side's biggest challenge. ""We are playing against the best defence in Europe and it will be very difficult to score a goal,"" said the Mexican international. ""But we believe in our qualities and the tie will be decided on whether we can score here. ""The way I think we can win the game is by believing in our potential. We are a very offensive team and it is rare that we don't score. ""We can't drastically change our style of play."" PSV will at least be able to recall top scorer and captain Luuk de Jong, who missed the first-leg through suspension. And they have a recent guide of how to go about eliminating Atletico as Celta Vigo dumped Simeone's men out of the Copa de Rey in January with a 3-2 win at the Calderon having drawn the first-leg 0-0 at home. ""I've watched many Atletico games, so I know their qualities and way of playing,"" said PSV coach Phillip Cocu. ""We have to believe in ourselves to achieve the objective of going through. The Celta game is an example of how we can get the result we need."""
454,14/03/2016,01:46,Atletico's dogged defence drives European dream,"Often overshadowed by the glitz and glamour of Real Madrid's galacticos and collective brilliance of Barcelona's attacking triumvirate of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar, Atletico Madrid have carved out their own golden era on a historically great defence.","PSV Eindhoven travel to the Vicente Calderon for the second-leg of their Champions League last-16 clash on Tuesday, with the tie finely balanced at 0-0, tasked with one of the most difficult challenges in European football: breaching the Atletico backline. In 14 Champions League matches at home since Diego Simeone rode to Atletico's rescue four years ago, only three sides have managed to score with Benfica, earlier this season, the only away team to win in the Spanish capital. Quiet but efficient, Atletico's defensive numbers this season are on course to be the best of all time. With a remarkable 27 clean sheets in 42 games in all competitions, goalkeeper Jan Oblak is set to break Paco Liano's Spanish record of 18 for the fewest number of goals conceded in a La Liga season. Oblak has been beaten just 12 times in 29 Liga games so far, four of which came in two games against Messi, Suarez and Neymar. Thanks to Real Madrid's administrative tardiness in trying to land David de Gea last August, Oblak remains the most expensive goalkeeper in Spanish football history after his 16 million euro ($17.8 million) switch from Benfica in 2014. Yet, faced with the daunting task of replacing Thibaut Courtois, Oblak had a difficult start to life at the Calderon. He initially lost out to Miguel Angel Moya in the battle to be Simeone's first choice and it wasn't till this stage of last season's Champions League that he began to prove his worth. Brought on to replace the injured Moya, Oblak kept a clean sheet and saved a penalty as Atletico progressed in a shootout against Bayer Leverkusen. ""I always laud the work, commitment and, above all, the way in which he won his place,"" Simeone said of the Slovenian. ""He waited for his moment, worked hard and when someone works the rewards come. ""He has an enormous future. We hope he doesn't stop improving."" Atletico were so keen to make sure Oblak is part of their promising future they gave him a major pay rise and extended his contract to 2021 last month. Yet, Oblak is far from the only rock in Atletico's defensive wall. Having seen Radamel Falcao, Diego Costa and Arda Turan sold in recent years, the one player Simeone has insisted he'll never let go is Uruguayan braveheart Diego Godin. The return of left-back Filipe Luis after a year at Chelsea has reunited three-quarters of the defence that won Atletico the La Liga title and went within a minute of winning the Champions League in 2013/14. Juanfran has been installed as Spain's first-choice right-back, whilst, at just 21, Jose Maria Gimenez is already one of the world's best centre-backs. More than names, though, it is Simeone's relentless insistence on hard work and organisation that makes Atletico so hard to breakdown. ""Simeone is the stone around which this project is constructed,"" said Godin. ""He has strengthened this group of players. He has made the players and fans believe, not just with words but with acts."" In four years under Simeone, Atletico have won a trophy every season. After the Europa League, UEFA Super Cup, Copa del Rey, La Liga and Spanish Super Cup, only one piece of silverware has eluded the Argentine: the Champions League. Coming so close before losing out in heartbreaking fashion to Real Madrid in the final two years ago has only hardened Simeone's desire to deliver Europe's premier title to the Calderon for the first time. The next step is seeing off PSV to reach the last eight for the third consecutive season. Having constructed steely foundations, Atletico believe their time is coming."
455,03/03/2016,23:51,Luis Enrique relishing 'beautiful' treble chase,"Barcelona boss Luis Enrique said he is looking forward to the most ""beautiful"" part of the season as his side close in on another league, Cup and Champions League treble.","Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick as Barca set a Spanish football record of 35 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions with a 5-1 win at Rayo Vallecano on Thursday. Barca are well set for a sixth La Liga title in eight years as they lead Atletico Madrid by eight points and Real Madrid by 12 with just 11 games to go. The Catalans will also face Sevilla in the Copa del Rey final and hold a 2-0 first-leg lead over Arsenal in the last-16 of the Champions League. ""We are approaching the final third of the season and the most beautiful part is still to come,"" said Luis Enrique. ""We have to wait and see what we can achieve, but whatever we do it will be deserved."" Despite their remarkable unbeaten run, the European champions haven't always been at their best in recent weeks. However, they looked back on top form at Vallecas despite their cause being eased as Rayo were reduced to nine-men. ""You always know the difficulties that a team like Rayo can present, but we overcame those in the best way with the attitude, intensity and ruthlessness we showed,"" continued Enrique. ""We played very well and when we are at this level in terms of attitude and intensity, it is very hard for the opponents."" The only negative on the night for the Catalans was another missed penalty as Luis Suarez failed to build on his two-goal lead over Cristiano Ronaldo in the fight to be La Liga's top scorer when his spot-kick was brilliantly saved by Juan Carlos in the second-half. Barca have now missed six of their 13 penalties in the league this season with the star front trio of Messi, Suarez and Neymar all missing twice. ""It is a facet we have to improve on, but it doesn't overly concern me if we have the game wrapped up beforehand,"" Enrique added."

However, Isco's late strike from Ronaldo's cut-back secured the points in stoppage time. Real trail second-placed Atletico by four points, but do open up a four-point lead of their own on Villarreal after they were held 0-0 at Celta Vigo. Barcelona can extend their lead over Atletico at the top to eight points with victory at Rayo Vallecano on Thursday. Gary Neville's Valencia moved into the top half of the table as they benefited from spectacular own goal by Malaga goalkeeper Carlos Kameni to win 2-1 at La Rosaleda. Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane was without a host of first team regulars as the suspended Dani Carvajal and Sergio Ramos joined the injured Marcelo, Luka Modric, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema on the sidelines. Real had former Levante 'keeper Keylor Navas to thank for not getting off to a terrible start as he produced a brilliant save low to his left to prevent Giuseppe Rossi giving the home side a shock lead. Ronaldo caused controversy with an outburst claiming Madrid ""would be top"" of the league if his teammates matched his standards after defeat to Atletico at the weekend. The three-time World Player of the Year made amends by opening the scoring from the spot on 34 minutes after Lucas Vazquez had been tripped inside the area by Lucas Orban. Injuries to Benzema and Bale opened the door for 18-year-old Borja Mayoral to get his first league start and he took his opportunity when his shot from the edge of the box hit the post and cannoned into the net off Marino's back three minutes later. However, Levante were back in the game instantly as the Real defence were caught flat-footed appealing for an offside flag that never arrived and Deyverson slotted into the bottom corner. Madrid had much better control of the game after the break and Ronaldo was desperately unlucky not to restore their two-goal lead when he struck the post from James Rodriguez's fine through ball. However, Zidane's men needed to rely on Navas once more to secure the points as he made a flying save to parry Ruben Garcia's shot from distance. And Isco answered his recent critics with a calm finish from Ronaldo's cut-back in stoppage time to round off the scoring. Defeat leaves Levante still rooted to the foot of the table, six points off safety. Villarreal's hopes of temporarily usurping Real Madrid into third were dashed in a game of few chances in Vigo as the visitors registered a sixth consecutive clean sheet in La Liga. Sevilla closed the gap on Villarreal to nine points in their quest for Champions League football as Fernando Llorente's early strike handed the Europa League holders their 15th straight home win in all competitions, 1-0 over Eibar. Valencia moved up to ninth as they recovered from Duje Cop's early deflected opener to register just Neville's third league win. Kameni punched the ball into his own net under pressure from Denis Cheryshev just before half-time and Real Madrid loanee Cheryshev completed the turnaround when he fired into the bottom corner five minutes after the break. Aritz Aduriz continued his push to be included in Spain's squad for the Euro 2016 with a hat-trick in Athletic Bilbao's 4-1 win over Deportivo la Coruna to take his tally for the season to 30."

""This competition will form a key part of our pre-season training and will be a great opportunity for me to put my players through their paces ahead of the new season,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone. The tournament debuted last year with a total of 221,000 fans at the MCG across the event week to watch Real Madrid, Manchester City and AS Roma."
458,28/02/2016,15:28,Derby defeat compounds Madrid's season to forget,Defeat for the third consecutive year at home in La Liga to Atletico Madrid ended Real Madrid's realistic title hopes before the end of February.,"Barcelona lead Real by nine points and also have a game in hand on Zinedine Zidane's men, who are now in a battle with Villarreal just to qualify automatically for next season's Champions League in third. Here, AFP Sports look at what has gone wrong this season for the richest club in the world. - No stability Rafael Benitez lasted barely seven months as coach at the beginning of the season before being ditched for club legend Zidane. Benitez's results weren't to president Florentino Perez's liking - most notably a 4-0 home hammering at the hands of Barcelona in November. Yet, the decision to replace Benitez with Zidane -- a huge name but with no previous managerial experience at the top level -- is symptomatic of Perez's misguided planning. When Benitez left Madrid were just two points adrift of Barcelona, by Saturday they were nine. ""Consistency is the key word, to win the league you have to be consistent,"" Benitez told BT Sport after his sacking. ""Barcelona has a style of football, a model of football. Real Madrid is changing managers every year so you have to start again and that is the reason Real Madrid has won one league title in the last seven."" - Ronaldo's rage hides failings Cristiano Ronaldo's rant that Madrid ""would be top"" if his teammates matched his standards not only spoke of a split dressing room riddled with clashing egos, but was a window into Ronaldo's anger at a frustrating campaign. Ronaldo's numbers of 34 goals in 33 games again look spectacular, but dig deeper and the three-time World Player of the Year has had barely any positive impact on the big games. The Portuguese hasn't scored in five La Liga games against top-five opposition. Indeed, just under 40 percent of his La Liga goals have come in two thrashings of Espanyol. He missed a crucial penalty as Real were held 1-1 at Malaga last weekend and missed his side's two best chances against Atletico on Saturday. - Injuries Ronaldo later rectified his comments, claiming to have only been speaking about his physical shape when suggesting he was superior to his teammates. He expressed frustration at not having the likes of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Marcelo, all of whom have spent significant time on the sidelines, alongside him at the weekend. Welsh star Bale has played just 17 of Madrid's 34 games this season. Ronaldo also hinted a poor pre-season, more concentrated on money-spinning trips to Australia and China than preparing for the campaign ahead, could be to blame. - A golden age for Barcelona and Atletico Madrid Atletico became the first visiting side ever to win three consecutive league games at the Bernabeu. Barcelona remain on course to become the only side ever to win back-to-back trebles of league, Cup and Champions League. For all Real's troubles, much of the criticism comes from being judged against two of the best teams in the world going through the greatest period of sustained success in their history with an Argentine at the heart of both. Barca's golden run has been spearheaded by five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi. At Atletico it is the coach, Diego Simeone, who has turned a perennially under-achieving club into a European power. Before Simeone's arrival, Atletico hadn't won a derby for 13 years. His transformation of Los Rojiblancos has been so complete that even he admitted it is now ""normal"" for the red and white half of Madrid to come out on top."
459,27/02/2016,19:58,"Real would be top if everyone was like me, rages Ronaldo",Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo claimed the Spanish giants would be top of La Liga rather than nine points behind Barcelona if his team-mates matched his standards.,"Ronaldo had a day to forget in front of goal as Real waved goodbye to any lasting hope of mounting a title challenge in a 1-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid on Saturday with even coach Zinedine Zidane admitting their challenge was over. ""If everyone was at my level, we would be top,"" said Ronaldo. ""Every year according to the press it seems I am rubbish, but the numbers and statistics don't lie."" Madrid have endured a season from hell as Zidane replaced the sacked Rafael Benitez in January, whilst the club has suffered a series of institutional embarrassments, including being eliminated from the Copa del Rey for fielding an ineligible player. The final whistle was met by a chorus of discontent from the home fans as they called for president Florentino Perez to resign. A mounting injury list has also taken its toll as they were without Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Pepe, and Karim Benzema had to be replaced by 18-year-old Borja Mayoral at half-time. And Ronaldo claimed that, despite Perez's multi-million euro investment, Madrid don't have a good enough squad to compete at the top level. ""I don't want to undervalue any of my teammates, but when the best aren't there it is difficult to win."" ""I like to play with Pepe, Karim, Bale, Marcelo. I don't want to say that Jese (Rodriguez), Lucas (Vazquez), (Mateo) Kovavic are not good players, they are very good, but to win a competition you need the best."" Defeat was Zidane's first in nine games since taking charge last month and he admitted that he had been shocked by his side's poor display. ""Today is a big blow. To lose at home to Atletico is difficult to take,"" said the Frenchman. ""I didn't expect the game we saw today. ""The league is over. It was already difficult and I said yesterday if you drop more points it is even more so. ""We're not just going to throw the league away because whatever happens we have goals, games to play and things to win. That is the idea we have to have going forward."" Victory meant Atletico became the first visiting side ever to win three consecutive league games at the Bernabeu and solidified their position in second, four points ahead of Real. ""Today we were Atletico Madrid. There is no better example of what we are than what we showed today,"" said coach Diego Simeone. ""Once again the fans of Atletico Madrid can feel immensely proud of their players."" Simeone's men trail Barcelona by five points, but the European champions can regain their eight-point advantage when they host Sevilla on Sunday. ""Barcelona are very good, it is difficult to see them losing three games,"" added Simeone. ""We have to focus on our own objective which was to finish in the top three, but everyone wants to finish as high as possible."" Atletico's title bid has been hampered by a lack of goals in recent games, but Antoine Griezmann ended a five-game drought to slot home his 20th of the season early in the second half. ""I'm happy on a personal level and also for the team,"" said Griezmann. ""We played a great game, we very solid at the back and, although we didn't have many chances, one of them went in."""
460,27/02/2016,18:04,Griezmann inflicts Zidane's first Madrid defeat,Zinedine Zidane suffered his first defeat since taking charge of Real Madrid as Antoine Griezmann's solitary goal kept Atletico Madrid's faint La Liga title hopes alive with a 1-0 win at the Santiago Bernabeu.,"Griezmann finished off a lovely team move eight minutes into the second half as Atletico became the first visiting team ever to win at the Bernabeu three seasons in a row. Diego Simeone's men move to within five points of leaders Barcelona while Real's chances of landing just a second title in eight years now look completely gone as they now trail Atletico by four points in third. Barca can restore their eight-point lead at the top when they face Sevilla on Sunday. An error-strewn first half was played at a pace that suggested both sides had already given up on their title hopes. The first shot on target didn't arrive until the half-hour mark when Cristiano Ronaldo's free-kick was beaten out by Jan Oblak. The rebound eventually found its way to Karim Benzema just inside the area, but the Frenchman pulled his shot past Oblak's far post. Atletico were quite content to frustrate the hosts with 10 men behind the ball for long spells, but the visitors ended the half the stronger and were unfortunate not to be in front when Keylor Navas produced a brilliant save to tip Griezmann's drive from 25 yards over. Navas also had to be aware moments later to prevent Koke's drive sneaking in at his near post. Real were dealt a blow at the break as Benzema had to be replaced by 18-year-old Borja Mayoral -- who starred as Los Blancos reached the quarter-finals of the youth Champions League in midweek with a 3-1 win over Manchester City -- at half-time. However, the hosts had a great chance to break the deadlock just three minutes after the restart when Ronaldo dragged his shot wide with just Oblak to beat from Luka Modric's through ball. That miss proved costly five minutes later as Atletico produced the move of the match to snatch all three points. Griezmann played in Filipe Luis in acres of space on the left and the Brazilian full-back showed great awareness to return the ball back into the path of the French international to fire low past Navas for his 20th goal of the season. The goal brought waves of discontent from the Real fans with calls for president Florentino Perez to resign. Atletico had the chance to kill the game off 24 minutes from time when they cut through Real's brittle defence once more, but Navas rushed from his goal to block Saul Niguez's attempted chip. At the other end, Ronaldo should have levelled moments later when he headed straight at Oblak from Dani Carvajal's inch-perfect cross. Real claimed in vain for a penalty when Danilo tumbled under Gabi's unwise challenge inside the area 15 minutes from time, but referee Clos Gomez was unmoved. Zidane threw on wingers Lucas Vazquez and Jese Rodriguez in the search for an equaliser, but having sacrificed Isco and James Rodriguez, Real lacked the creativity to break down Atletico's brilliant defence as they held out for a 26th clean sheet of the season."
461,26/02/2016,16:46,Zidane lauds Simeone ahead of first derby clash,Zinedine Zidane has hailed the remarkable job done by Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone ahead of his first taste of the Madrid derby as Real Madrid boss on Saturday.,"""We are going to play a team who have a great coach. He is very important for his team and someone I have appreciated as a player and a coach,"" said Zidane. ""He has a competitive team. Now I must find the keys to play our best and win the match."" Simeone has seen off three previous Real coaches in Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Rafael Benitez during his four-year spell at Atletico in which he has turned around the history of their rivalry with Real. Atletico hadn't won a derby for 14 years before winning the Copa del Rey at Real's Santiago Bernabeu stadium in 2013, but haven't lost a La Liga fixture to their city rivals in five games since. ""I can't evaluate what happens at other teams, but I do value the continuity and the work we have done with the players and the club to obtain this stability,"" said Simeone. ""I am thankful for that and the results also help."" Both sides have seen their title hopes fade in recent weeks as Barcelona have moved eight points clear of Atletico at the top of the table with Real a further point behind in third. Indeed, the European champions have stretched their lead over Real by seven points since Zidane took over from Rafael Benitez last month. And ahead of his biggest match in charge, Zidane admitted it is normal that some have doubts over his ability to transform from a great player into a great coach. ""It is a specal match because it is a derby. I understand that people have doubted my abilities as a coach,"" he addded. ""It is normal, people can think what they want, but I have to concentrate on what I do. I am clear about the ideas of what I want to do as a coach."" Zidane confirmed that left-back Marcelo will join Welsh star Gareth Bale on the sidelines with a calf problem. However, Zidane insisted that Real won't give up on the title race even if they lose against Atletico. ""No matter what we are not going to give up until the end. There are points to play for. ""It is always going to be harder if we drop points, but we have games to play, we have the Champions League and we need to concentrate only on ourselves. Our season doesn't end tomorrow."""
462,26/02/2016,02:15,Derby win a must for Ronaldo in Barca chase,Cristiano Ronaldo insists Real Madrid can still catch La Liga leaders Barcelona if they can overcome their hoodoo against local rivals Atletico Madrid on Saturday.,"Real trail Atletico by a point and are nine adrift of Barca with just 13 games remaining, but can move up to second place should they beat Diego Simeone's men for the first time in six league games. ""It is a game we need to win,"" Ronaldo told Madrid's website. ""It is an important game at home, in front of our fans and against a very strong team that defends well. ""We know that (winning) La Liga will be difficult, but we need to fight until the end. Football is box full of surprises and anything can happen."" Real are expected to once again be without Gareth Bale as the calf injury that was initially expected to keep the Welsh star out for three weeks in mid-January drags on. Karim Benzema is likely to return having missed the 1-1 draw at Malaga last weekend, whilst James Rodriguez could start after being left on the bench by Zinedine Zidane at La Rosaleda. Zidane's record at the Bernabeu since taking over has been impeccable with four wins and 20 goals from four games. However, Atletico's rock-solid defence will pose a much more difficult obstacle to break down. Simeone's men recorded their 24th clean sheet in 38 games this season in a 0-0 draw at PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League in midweek. However, goals at the other end of the field has been the major problem for Atletico with just one in their last three games. ""The goal will come. We need to keep going and, if we have to be patient, I'll be the first to wait,"" said Simeone. Stefan Savic misses out through injury, so Jose Maria Gimenez will come into the Atletico defence. Meanwhile, Fernando Torres is likely to earn a recall to the starting line-up unless Yannick Carrasco recovers in time from an ankle ligament injury. Barca can maintain their stranglehold on the title race when Sevilla visit the Camp Nou on Sunday. The Andalusians' charge for a top-four finish has been maintained by their brilliant home form as they still haven't won away in the league all season. That run seems highly unlikely to chance as Barca seek to extend a 33-game unbeaten run in all competitions. However, the last time the European champions tasted defeat it was to Sevilla in October. ""Stats are there to be broken,"" said Barca's top scorer Luis Suarez. ""We are dedicated to playing well and getting good results."" With three La Liga games to come in seven days, Barca boss Luis Enrique is likely to rotate with the likes of Arda Turan and Sergi Roberto in line to start. Similarly with Sevilla aiming to catch Villarreal, who they trail by eight points, in fourth, coach Unai Emery may prioritise more winnable clashes with Eibar and Getafe in the next week. However, Villarreal are strong favourites to stretch their commanding lead over the Europa League holders to 11 points when they host Levante on Sunday. Gary Neville's upturn in fortunes as Valencia boss continued with a 4-0 win over Rapid Vienna on Thursday to seal a remarkable 10-0 aggregate win and a fourth consecutive victory in all competitions. With fears of being dragged into a relegation battle eased, Valencia could even challenge for a Europa League place should they continue their momentum at home to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.

Savic was surprisingly chosen ahead of Jose Maria Gimenez for Atletico's 0-0 draw away to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Wednesday with the Uruguayan now set to return alongside Diego Godin in central defence. Atletico and Real trail La Liga leaders Barcelona by eight and nine points respectively with defeat for either side almost certain to end any realistic title hopes."

However, Atletico failed to take advantage meaning all is to play for when the sides meet again on March 15 at the Vicente Calderon for a place in the last eight. Vietto was handed a start ahead of Fernando Torres as Griezmann's strike partner and should have opened the scoring after just three minutes. Gabi's long ball through the middle caught the PSV defence flat-footed and the Argentine lifted the ball over the advancing Zoet, but Jeffrey Bruma got back just in time to clear the ball off the line. PSV had seen off Manchester United in the group stages to reach the last-16 for the first time in nine years and showed signs they could produce another upset during the first-half. The home fans and coach Phillip Cocu were furious when Jurgen Locadia went down under Gabi's challenge inside the area, but referee Daniele Orasato was unmoved. Yet, Atletico were constantly finding space in behind the Dutch champions defence and Koke was next to have a go at chipping the ball over Zoet but didn't get enough on his effort to beat the 'keeper. Griezmann then had the best chance of the game when he raced onto Koke's through ball to beat the offside trap, but Zoet rushed from his line to make a vital save. PSV could even have been in front before half-time when Davy Propper shot straight at Jan Oblak from close range after great work by Pereiro. Chances were harder to come by in the second period as neither side ran the risk of conceding the winner. Diego Godin did have the ball in the net just after the hour mark, but his header from Koke's corner was rightly ruled out for a foul on Hector Moreno. PSV were then forced to try and see out the final 20 minutes when Pereiro picked up an unnecessary second booking for a flying elbow on Godin.

Atletico lie second in La Liga, but trail leaders Barcelona by eight points, while they are the favourites to progress to the quarter-finals in Europe ahead of the game at the Philips Stadion. ""To reach a final you have less games to play than to win a league and after being as close as we were (in 2014) the objectives become bigger, but we must not forget to go one game at a time,"" Simeone said. Atletico have lost just once in nine matches in La Liga since Christmas, and that came away at Barcelona. Their biggest strength has been their rock solid defence, as shown in their 0-0 draw with Villarreal on Sunday. ""The team is in a good moment. We have had two wins in a row followed by a draw against one of our rivals,"" added the Argentinian, whose team have a huge match away to cross-town rivals Real on Saturday. ""This is a difficult run of games. PSV will be tough opponents and they are physically very strong. ""I like what I have seen of them, but we go into the game with enthusiasm."" PSV qualified from their group at the expense of Manchester United and are on course to retain the Dutch title, sitting a point clear of Ajax at the top of the table. Their coach, the former Barcelona midfielder Philip Cocu, has urged his side to make sure they avoid conceding an away goal before the second leg at the Vicent Calderon next month. ""They have a clear style of play. Would I settle for a 0-0 draw? Keeping a clean sheet could be very important,"" he said. ""Atletico have a consistent side, they're a great team unit, they won't give anything away. They always play the same way -- they are winners and they play a compact game despite a busy fixture list."" PSV's hopes of breaking down the away defence are not helped by the absence of leading scorer Luuk de Jong due to suspension. Atletico are without Yannick Carrasco and Tiago Mendes but Simeone says Augusto Fernandez is physically ready to return after several weeks out injured."

The Bernabeu holds 81,000 compared to the Calderon's 55,000 capacity. However, last week the Bernabeu was finally ruled out as a potential venue as it was announced that American rock legend Bruce Springsteen will play a concert there on May 21. Barca are aiming to win the trophy for a record 28th time in their bid to repeat their treble-winning feat last season in claiming the Champions League, La Liga and the Cup. Sevilla last won the Copa del Rey in 2010, but were the last team to beat Barca back in October."

Atletico Madrid also failed to gain significant ground on Barca as they were held 0-0 at home by Villarreal to move eight points behind in second. However, Gary Neville's upturn in fortunes as Valencia boss continued with a third win in a week, 2-1 at Granada. Zinedine Zidane's men were left to rue Ronaldo's miss from the spot to make it 2-0 before the break when Carlos Kameni dived to his left to parry the three-time World Player of the Year's effort. ""It is obviously going to be difficult because we have dropped two points, but we won't give up,"" said Zidane. ""There are 39 points still to play for. You think the league is lost, but the players and myself don't believe that."" Madrid were without the injured Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale, while James Rodriguez was left on the bench by Zidane. The visitors were lucky to go in front as Ronaldo headed home Toni Kroos's free-kick despite clearly standing in an offside position. There was no doubt about the penalty award two minutes later, though, when Ronaldo was brought down by Weligton. Yet, despite being normally lethal from the spot, the Portuguese was denied by a fine low save by Kameni. Malaga missed a great chance to level before the break as Jesus Navas parried Duje Cop's shot into the air and Sergio Ramos got back to clear the looping ball off the line. And Navas then made an incredible stop just after the restart when Nacho turned Juanpi's cross towards his own goal. Yet, the Madrid stopper was finally beaten when Malaga's two centre-backs combined for the equaliser as Weligton's low cross was coolly slotted home at the back post by Albentosa. Chances were far harder to come by at the Vicente Calderon as the two best defences in the league stood firm. Atletico's top scorer Antoine Griezmann headed Juanfran's inch-perfect cross just wide before Angel Correa's audacious chipped effort forced Villarreal goalkeeper Alphonse Areola into his only serious save after half-time. And Villarreal could have snatched all three points on the break when Cedric Bakambu blazed over with just Jan Oblak to beat. Elsewhere, Neville's Valencia again rode their luck, but recorded back-to-back league wins for just the second time this season as Granada passed up a wave of second-half opportunities. With confidence high from their 6-0 thrashing of Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday, Valencia started the stronger and only great saves from Andres Fernandez prevented Paco Alcacer and Andres Gomez from giving Valencia a half-time lead. Dani Parejo eventually opened the scoring 10 minutes after the break when he swept home Alcacer's knockdown. However, Granada should have levelled in the final half hour as David Barral hit the bar and Youssef El-Arabi fired off target from close range. Santi Mina sealed the points for Valencia on the counter-attack before Edgar Mendes pulled a goal back in stoppage time. ""I think at the moment we need to win all our games to keep the momentum going,"" said Neville. ""The dressing room changed significantly in the last week in terms of mood as when you win there is a stronger belief."" Sevilla remain eight points off Villarreal in the battle for the final Champions League place as they blew a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Rayo Vallecano. Real Sociedad's surge up the table continued as Jonathas's brilliant strike handed them a 1-0 win over Athletic Bilbao in the Basque derby to move into the top half."

Atletico then held on to record their 15th clean sheet in 24 Liga games this season to leapfrog Real Madrid back into second place. Barcelona have two games in hand on both capital clubs and host Celta Vigo later on Sunday. Torres was handed his first start since early January and rewarded boss Diego Simeone with a smart finish after great work from Carrasco down the right. The former Liverpool and Chelsea striker then missed a huge chance to double Atletico's lead on 13 minutes when he failed to hit the target when clean through on Vicente Guaita. Getafe rarely threatened the Atletico goal, but the visitors did suffer a big setback when Carrasco hobbled off with ankle ligament damage early in the second period. The Belgian international is now a major doubt for both Atletico's trips to PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League last-16 next week and the Madrid derby in a fortnight. Elsewhere, Sevilla closed the gap on Villarreal in the battle for the fourth Champions League place to eight points with a 2-0 win over relegation threatened Las Palmas. Second-half goals from Ever Banega and Kevin Gameiro overcame the Canary Islanders' resistance to register Sevilla's 13th consecutive home win in all competitions. Basque minnows Eibar's brilliant second season in the top flight continued as they saw off Levante 2-0 to move up to sixth. And Real Sociedad moved into the top half with their third straight win 3-0 over Granada."

He has also kept 18 clean sheets in 29 appearances in all competitions this term."
471,04/02/2016,19:45,Atletico's Filipe Luis ban reduced to one game,Atletico Madrid left-back Filipe Luis's ban for a dangerous challenge on World Player of the Year Lionel Messi has been reduced from three games to one after the club's appeal was upheld on Thursday.,"Luis was shown a straight red card just before half-time in Atletico's 2-1 defeat to Barcelona last weekend for catching Messi on his left knee with his studs, sparking wild protests from Barca boss Luis Enrique. The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) initially said the suspension was due to the ""special seriousness"" of the challenge. However, Atletico claimed the ban was excessive and had their case upheld by the Federation's Appeals Committee. Atletico are still facing a defensive crisis for the visit of Eibar on Saturday with Diego Godin and Juanfran also suspended and Stefan Savic struggling with a thigh strain."
472,04/02/2016,18:06,Atletico keen on Diego Costa return,"Atletico Madrid have made the return of Chelsea striker Diego Costa to the Vicente Calderon as their primary transfer target for next season, club president Enrique Cerezo admitted on Thursday.","Atletico have money to spend after selling Colombian international Jackson Martinez to Chinese side Guangzhou Evergrande for 42 million euros ($46 million) on Wednesday. And Cerezo now has his sights set on Costa who fired Los Rojiblancos to the La Liga title in 2013/14 before joining Chelsea. ""We will try everything possible and see what Chelsea say, but it doesn't depend solely on us. We always try to bring the best players and Diego is one of them,"" Cerezo told Spanish radio station Cadena Cope. Martinez's departure was the latest demonstration of the growing financial power of Chinese clubs, but also came as a relief to Atletico as they made a profit on the 35 million euros they paid for the misfiring striker just six months ago. The 29-year-old scored just three times in 22 appearances and made just one start in La Liga since November. ""It was a magnificent deal for the three parties. Very good for the club that have bought him, magnificent for us and also for the player,"" added Cerezo."

""The challenge scared me,"" Enrique said after the game. Atletico were eventually reduced to nine men at the Camp Nou as Diego Godin was also sent off in the second-half as they fell three points behind Barca in the title race. The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) said the suspension was due to the ""special seriousness"" of the challenge. Atletico are facing a defensive headache for their next La Liga clash against Eibar on Saturday with right-back Juanfran also suspended, whilst Montenegrin centre-back Stefan Savic suffered a thigh strain in training on Wednesday."
474,03/02/2016,08:16,Martinez joins Evergrande in record China deal,Asian champions Guangzhou Evergrande smashed China's transfer fee record Wednesday when they announced a deal to secure Atletico Madrid's unsettled Colombian striker Jackson Martinez for 42 million euros ($46 million).,"Martinez, 29, is the latest Europe-based player to move to the cashed-up Chinese Super League and was described as a ""goal poacher"" and ""fox in the box"" in a Chinese-language statement on the club's website. The purchase broke the week-old Chinese record fee of 28 million euros, paid by Jiangsu Suning to acquire Brazilian midfielder Ramires from Chelsea. It lifted the Chinese Super League's total spending during the current transfer window to 203.9 million euros, according to website transfermarkt which tracks commercial dealings in the sport, second only to the English Premier League. Atletico bought Martinez last year from FC Porto where he had scored an impressive 92 goals in 133 games, but he struggled to establish himself in Spain, scoring just two goals in 15 La Liga appearances. Chinese businesses have invested huge sums in football since President Xi Jinping, an avowed fan of the sport, declared that hosting, qualifying, and winning a World Cup were national goals. In the past, the highest-profile international signings by Chinese clubs tended to be ageing stars in their 30s nearing the end of their playing days. But many of those bought in the current transfer window have been in their late 20s. Questions have been asked about whether some are past their prime, but David Hornby, sports business director of the Mailman brand management group in Shanghai, said: ""These are not guys at the end of their career just looking for a pay-out."" In 2015 a powerful political committee headed by Xi released a 50-point plan to put his ambition into effect, including establishing tens of thousands of soccer schools and making the game compulsory for some elementary and middle-school students. Investors have since ploughed more money into football in ""an attempt to be looked favourably on by the government"", said Tom Elsden, sports strategy manager at Mailman. ""This has stimulated the growth of football immensely. It's really that government mandate that's pushing it."" Factoring in the top two levels of the sport, Chinese clubs have so far spent 252.7 million euros in the current transfer period -- which runs until February 26 in China -- while English clubs splashed out 295.1 million euros before the European window closed on Monday, according to transfermarkt. The second-tier China League One ranked ahead of the Bundesliga in Germany, Spain's Primera Division and France's Ligue 1 for spending. On Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media service, many criticised the high cost of signing Martinez, but the most popular comments were from fans who defended Evergrande's move. ""Seeing some people saying it's not worth it, I think it's overdone,"" wrote one user. ""I wonder if you guys watch football at all? You're all displeased with Martinez? China football fans' demands are really high now!"" Another wrote that China's billionaires were ""playing a big game of chess"" with their football investments. The Guangzhou club, majority owned by property developer Evergrande and internet giant Alibaba, sold Brazilian striker Elkeson to domestic rivals Shanghai SIPG last month. But Martinez will join Brazilian international Paulinho in a squad who won a fifth consecutive domestic crown in October. The following month they claimed their second AFC Champions League title in three years."

Los Che also face the daunting task of meeting European champions Barcelona in the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey in midweek. Siqueira, 29, has made just seven appearances for Atletico this season having been usurped in the pecking order at left-back by fellow Brazilian Filipe Luis's return to Los Rojiblancos from Chelsea."
476,31/01/2016,13:21,Atletico's Fernandez suffers knee ligament damage,Atletico Madrid midfielder Augusto Fernandez is expected to miss the majority of the remainder of the season after suffering knee ligament damage in his side's 2-1 defeat to Barcelona on Saturday.,"""The medical tests confirm that Augusto suffered a partial tear of the lateral internal ligament in his left knee,"" Atletico said in a statement on Sunday. Spanish media reported the Argentine will be sidelined for two to four months, meaning he will definitely miss Atletico's trip to Real Madrid at the end of February and their Champions League last-16 tie against PSV Eindhoven. The 29-year-old has made just six appearances for Atletico since joining from Celta Vigo earlier this month. Uruguayan defender Diego Godin also suffered a minor ankle sprain before being sent-off at the Camp Nou. As a result, Godin is already suspended for the visit of Eibar next weekend and is expected to recover in time to face Getafe in a fortnight."
477,30/01/2016,19:30,Barca red hot title favourites - Simeone,Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone conceded his side's title chances may have gone as they were reduced to nine men in losing 2-1 to league leaders Barcelona on Saturday.,"Victory moved the European champions three points clear of Atletico - having also played a game less - and seven ahead of third-placed Real Madrid. ""Barcelona continue to be very strong. In their strikers they have the goals and play that makes the difference,"" said the Argentine. ""They are in a very good position, they have three points more than us and a game in hand. ""There is a long way to go and we will see, but normally they don't falter."" Koke had given Atletico the perfect start at the Camp Nou with his 10th-minute opener a just reward for the visitors' strong start. However, two goals in eight minutes from Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez pierced Atletico's usually rock solid defence to put Barca well on course for a fifth title in seven years. ""I am left with the team's response to a difficult start and conceding the goal,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""We had 15 minutes where against a team as good as Atletico Madrid we were camped in their area and scored twice which put us in command. ""The objective was to kill the game. Despite them having one and then two players less we struggled to kill it off and it was an open game until the end."" Barca's performance was in keeping with recent games against Malaga and Athletic Bilbao as they struggled in the opening stages, but still had enough quality in Messi, Suarez and Neymar to eventually dig themselves out of trouble. The Catalans have already played nine games this year, on the back of a hectic schedule to end 2015 which saw them travel to Japan to win the Club World Cup. And defender Javier Mascherano admitted there has been signs of tiredness in their recent displays. ""We lacked the spark we have had in other games and it cost us. We put a lot into the game in midweek (against Athletic Bilbao) and it is not easy to play every two-and-a-half days. ""It is not an excuse, but, against the nine men, we made sure of the result, didn't take risks and won the three points. ""I think the result makes us stronger going forward. It was important to put some distance between ourselves and Atletico."""
478,29/01/2016,20:14,"FIFA grant Real, Atletico provisional suspension","FIFA have granted Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid a provisional suspension of their one-year ban on registering new players pending the outcome of their appeals, both clubs confirmed on Friday.","Both clubs were handed the sanction for their dealings in the signing of under-age foreign nationals by football's governing body earlier this month and immediately announced their decision to appeal. ""FIFA's Appeals Commission has decided to provisionally suspended the sanction imposed on the club,"" Real Madrid said in a statement. ""The FIFA Appeals Commission has granted us the provisional suspension of the sanction whilst the appeal presented by the club is resolved,"" Atletico added via their official Twitter account. The ban is due to take effect from when the transfer window shuts on Monday and, barring a successful appeal, will rule out the registration of new players until July 2017. Atletico were also fined 900,000 Swiss francs (820,000 euros) and Real 360,000 (330,000 euros). European champions Barcelona suffered a similar sanction in 2015. Barca were initially banned in April 2014, but managed to delay the sanction taking effect until the transfer windows in January and the summer of 2015 by also having their ban provisionally suspended despite an ultimately unsuccessful appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). By delaying the ban, Barca managed to sign the likes of Luis Suarez and Ivan Rakitic in the summer of 2014 to propel them to a treble of La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey. The same option will be open to Real and Atletico to sign this summer if their appeal is not heard by the time the transfer market reopens on July 1."
479,29/01/2016,18:59,"Torres out of Barca trip, Atletico future in doubt",Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres will miss his side's top of the table clash with Barcelona on Saturday due to an ankle injury and faces an uncertain future at his boyhood club.,"Torres's loan deal from AC Milan expires at the end of the season, but Atletico have been hit with a one-year ban on registering new players from February by FIFA. The club would therefore need to hope their appeal against the ban is successful or sign Torres on a permanent deal before Monday's transfer deadline to secure his long-term future at the club. The former Liverpool and Chelsea striker returned to a hero's welcome at the Vicente Calderon last January, seven-and-a-half years after he left for England. However, his decline in performance in recent years has continued, scoring just eight times in 50 games since his return, including none in his last 19 appearances. As a result, Atletico coach Diego Simeone has insisted that Torres will have to earn a longer term deal between now and the end of the season, but the 31-year-old is still loved by the Atletico fans who remember his better days when he captained the club whilst still a teenager. Indeed, despite being sidelined by injury, his name was chanted in Atletico's 3-2 Copa del Rey defeat by Celta Vigo on Wednesday. ""There is no division between Simeone and Torres for Atletico fans. They love us both unconditionally,"" Simeone said on Friday. ""The fans want Atletico to win. They haven't stopped loving (deceased former player and coach) Luis Aragones who is no longer there, or Kiko, who has retired. Idols like Torres will be loved forever."" Of more pressing concern for Simeone is how to end Barcelona's 25-match unbeaten run and regain top spot of La Liga at the Camp Nou. Atletico and Barca are locked on 48 points at the top of the table, but Barca have a game in hand. Simeone's men boast the best defence in Europe - having conceded only eight goals in 21 league games this season - but even Atletico have been unable to stop Barca's star front three of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez. The South American trio have combined for nine goals in Barca's five consecutive wins over Atletico since Suarez joined last season. ""Barca are the best team in the world and these three guys have a special partnership that is difficult to see,"" added Simeone. ""There is normally always jealousy and egos, but there it is the total opposite. ""The arrival of Suarez has strengthened the whole system and the marvellous thing about those three is that there is no envy. There are healthy, happy people and for those of us who love football that is marvellous."""
480,25/01/2016,21:31,Atletico appeal transfer ban,Atletico Madrid lodged an appeal Monday against a one-year transfer ban imposed by FIFA over their dealing in under-age players.,"The ban starts from the July transfer window this year and finishes with the January transfer market in 2017. Real Madrid were hit with the same punishment. Atletico were also fined 900,000 Swiss francs (820,000 euros) and Real 360,000 (330,000 euros). However, both clubs are still allowed to sign players until the end of the month. Atletico in a statement announced that they had ""lodged an appeal against the decision by FIFA's disciplinary commission"". World football's governing body FIFA said the alarm was raised over the two clubs by FIFA's Transfer Matching System and its disciplinary committee completed the inquiry. Under international football rules, players under 18 cannot be transferred to another country, except in limited circumstances. All transfers need the approval of a special FIFA committee. European champions Barcelona have just completed a one year ban for similar reasons."
481,16/01/2016,16:12,Simeone to lean on Griezmann during transfer ban,Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone insists he won't waste any energy on the one-year transfer ban handed to the club by FIFA in midweek until all appeal routes have been exhausted.,"The La Liga leaders and city rivals Real Madrid were both sanctioned on Thursday for irregularities in the signing of foreign nationals under 18. ""I am not going to waste energy in this situation because what interests me is that things go well (on the field). ""With the appeal anything can happen. Until there is a clearer situation after the appeal I can't make any more comment."" Both clubs can make transfers until the end of the month, but will then be banned from registering any new players until July 2017 unless their appeals are succesful. However, Atletico look well-set to be able to cope with any ban having invested heavily in young talent over the past year. The stunning form of Antoine Griezmann has not just carried Simeone's men to the top of the table, but also to the last 16 of the Champions League and quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey. Griezmann came off the bench to score twice against Rayo Vallecano in the Cup on Thursday to take his tally for the season to 16 and Simeone lauded the Frenchman's progress since he joined the club from Real Sociedad 18 months ago. ""I always saw in him the need for absolute freedom because he is physically so strong. He notices where he can damage the opponent and for that reason he was performed so well during all this time,"" said Simeone. ""He is quick, can score with his head or his feet, he is a very complete player and he has been given something by his teammates and the club, which is consistency. ""He is now a man on the pitch. His effort shows that talent is very important, but it is nothing without hard work."""
482,14/01/2016,23:04,Atletico shrug off transfer ban to reach Cup quarters,Atletico Madrid bounced back from a difficult day for the club off the field to book their place in the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey with a 3-0 win over Rayo Vallecano.,"FIFA handed the Liga leaders and rivals Real Madrid a one-year transfer ban to take effect from July on Thursday for alleged irregularities in the signing of minors. Both clubs have signalled their intention to appeal, but unlike Real, who were expelled from the Cup earlier in the competition for fielding an ineligible player, Atletico could at least console themselves with a place in the last eight. ""I was preparing for the game, so the club phoned me to explain the stuation. They have notified us (of the ban) and the club will appeal,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""It is the people in the offices that have to fix this more than us."" Angel Correa's stunning strike in off the underside of the bar brought an uneventful first half to life six minutes before the break. With the tie still evenly balanced after a 1-1 draw in the first leg, coach Diego Simeone introduced top scorer Antoine Griezmann from the bench 20 minutes from time. And for the fifth game in a row, one of Simeone's substitutes scored as Griezmann forced the ball home from close range 10 minutes later. Griezmann then added his 16th goal of the season in stoppage time as he beat Rayo 'keeper Yoel to a long ball before slotting into an empty net. Gary Neville's Valencia also cruised into the quarter-finals in comprehensive fashion with a 3-0 win away to Granada to seal a 7-0 aggregate victory. Neville is yet to taste victory in La Liga in five attempts since taking charge last month, but has now won each of his three cup ties. Already carrying a healthy 4-0 lead from the first leg, Neville named an experimental side, but was rewarded for giving youth its chance as Wilfried Zahibo netted his first goal for the club just before half-time. Spanish international Paco Alcacer then made it 2-0 within seconds of coming on as a substitute before Pablo Piatti rubbed salt into Granada's wounds five minutes from time. ""I am happy with the result, performance and to have kept a clean sheet,"" said Neville. Atletico and Valencia join holders Barcelona, Sevilla, Athletic Bilbao, Celta Vigo, Las Palmas and second-tier Mirandes in Friday's quarter-final draw."
483,14/01/2016,14:03,"Real, Atletico hit by one year transfer bans",FIFA on Thursday banned Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid from buying players for one year over their dealing in under-age players.,"The ban will start from the July transfer window this year and finish with the January transfer market in 2017. Atletico were also fined 900,000 Swiss francs (820,000 euros) and Real 360,000 (330,000 euros). ""The two clubs were found to have violated several provisions concerning the international transfer and first registration of minor players as well as other relevant provisions with regard to the registration and participation of certain players in competitions,"" said a FIFA statement. Barcelona has just ended a one year ban for similar reasons. Real and Atletico were ""issued with a reprimand and given 90 days in which to regularise the situation of all minor players concerned,"" FIFA said. They can still sell players during the transfer ban. FIFA said the alarm was raised over the two clubs by FIFA's Transfer Matching System and its disciplinary committee completed the inquiry. Under international football rules, players under 18 cannot be transferred to another country, except in limited circumstances. All transfers need the approval of a special FIFA committee. ""The investigations concerned minor players who were involved and participated in competitions with the clubs over various periods between 2007 and 2014 (Atletico Madrid) and between 2005 and 2014 (Real Madrid),"" FIFA said. The ban follows a similar sanction handed to European champions Barcelona, who were unable to register new players during 2015. Barca were initially banned in April 2014, but managed to delay the sanction taking affect until the transfer windows in January and the summer 2015 by launching an ultimately unsuccessful appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). By delaying the ban, Barca managed to sign the likes of Luis Suarez and Ivan Rakitic in the summer of 2014 to propel them to a treble of La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey. The news is just the latest institutional embarassment for Real Madrid just over a week after they appointed French legend Zinedine Zidane. Madrid have sacked two Champions League winning coaches in Carlo Ancelotti and Rafael Benitez in the past seven months, as well as being thrown out of the Copa del Rey for fielding an ineligible player. The sanction could also be bad news for the likes of Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United, who had targeted Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale with Real highly unlikely to dispose of their best players without the chance to sign suitable replacements. La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid's usually hectic transfer policy will also be put on hold. However, Diego Simeone's men look better placed to cope with the ban having invested heavily in young talent over the past year. Neither Real no Atletico made an immediate comment on whether they would appeal."
484,03/01/2016,02:30,Simeone demands improvement from leaders Atletico,Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone has demanded more from his side in the second half of the season despite looking down on Spanish football's perennial powerhouses Barcelona and Real Madrid.,"Thomas Partey's late winner in a 1-0 victory over Levante on Saturday moved Los Rojiblancos two points clear of European champions Barcelona at the top of the table, albeit having played a game more. Real meanwhile trail their city rivals by five points ahead of their trip to Valencia on Sunday. Atletico's success so far this season has been built on a rock solid defence that has conceded just eight goals in 18 league games. An 11th clean sheet of the campaign was needed to see of bottom of the table Levante, though, as their struggle for goals continued as big summer signings Jackson Martinez and Luciano Vietto again failed to find the net. And Simeone is well aware his side need more firepower to have any chance of repeating their incredible feat of beating Barca and Madrid to the title two years ago. ""We have one game to go until the end of the first half of the season, but leading the league will not distract us from the improvements we need,"" said Simeone. ""I think we can play better, have more speed in our game, be more decisive, consistent, make better choices in the final third and score more goals. That is what concerns me."" Simeone certainly won't be lacking for options in the coming months despite Atletico's involvement on three fronts as they have also reached the last 16 of the Copa del Rey and the Champions League. Argentine internationals Augusto Fernandez and Matias Kranevitter will be free to feature for the first time against Rayo Vallecano in the Cup in midweek after completing moves from Celta Vigo and River Plate respectively. And Partey's game-changing displays from the bench against Levante and in setting up Angel Correa for the opening goal in a 2-0 win over Rayo earlier in the week have made the young Ghanaian a candidate to displace the more established Koke and Gabi from Simeone's preferred starting line-up. ""Once again the changes gave us the quality we needed in the game, especially in the movement for the goal,"" added Simeone. ""It ended up taking the game where we wanted it from the start. From Thomas's introduction we had more movement, we could play the ball out from the back easier and it ended with the goal. ""I don't have a commitment to anyone and I only treat them on what I see in training and especially the games. ""They know that the best way to compete is to have competition amongst one another."""

487,13/12/2015,22:31,"Real Madrid beaten again at Villarreal, Atletico joint top",Real Madrid's La Liga title hopes were dealt another huge blow as they suffered a third league defeat in five games to Roberto Soldado's solitary goal at Villarreal on Sunday.,"Atletico Madrid's 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao earlier in the day means Real now trail their city rivals and Barcelona by five points at the top of the table. Real were outplayed in the first-half, but reacted after the break and were left to rue a hat-trick of missed chances by troubled French striker Karim Benzema as defeat piles the pressure on under fire coach Rafael Benitez. Elsewhere, a late own goal salvaged a point for Valencia in Gary Neville's first taste of La Liga action as Los Che battled back with 10 men to draw 1-1 at Eibar. Real had won five consecutive games since being thrashed 4-0 at home by Barca last month, but were forced onto the back foot by a whirlwind start from Villarreal. Jonathan dos Santos had already smacked the inside of the post before Soldado turned home Cedric Bakambu's pass against his old club on eight minutes. Bakambu had two great chances to double Villarreal's advantage before half-time, but the Congolese striker pulled his shot wide when clean through on Keylor Navas before firing over from inside the area. Having been dominated in the first-half, Madrid came out a different side after the break and had a series of chances to turn the game on its head. Benzema had scored five times in his last two outings for Madrid despite his off-field problems which saw him indefinitely banned from playing for France in midweek, however his range was off as he volleyed inches wide from Gareth Bale's through ball. Another fine Bale cross was blasted over by Benzema moments later before Bale had a great chance himself, but on his weaker right foot didn't have the power to beat Alphonse Areola in the Villarreal goal. Benzema had one final chance to rescue a point, but his and Madrid's night was summed up when he headed wide when unmarked inside the area 17 minutes from time. Victory takes Villarreal back to within a point of fourth-placed Celta Vigo. At the Vicente Calderon, Atletico were forced to come from behind as they conceded for just the seventh time in 15 La Liga games this season when Aymeric Laporte swept home Benat Etxebarria's corner at the back post. Atletico had barely threatened in the first-half but levelled with the last action of the half as Saul Niguez headed in at the near post. Jan Oblak made two great saves at the start of the second period from Eneko Boveda and Aduriz to keep Atletico in the game. And they proved vital as Antoine Griezmann's stunning strike from 25 yards with Atletico's only serious effort of the second-half delivered a vital three points. ""We always work to be better and it is clear that we continue on our course, looking to improve without looking at the other teams,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""It is not easy to concede first and come back. We are happy with our work, but we don't understand any other way than through sheer effort."" Valencia escaped from Eibar with a point despite another disappointing display after crashing out of the Champions League against Lyon in Neville's first game in charge in midweek. Sergi Enrich deservedly opened the scoring for Eibar with the last kick of the first half. However, the turning point came midway through the second period when Valencia goalkeeper Jaume Domenech saved Saul Berjon's penalty after Lucas Orban had been very harshly sent off for supposedly elbowing Dani Garcia. And Valencia got the slice of luck they needed when David Junca turned the ball into his own net five minutes from time. A point leaves Valencia seven points off the top four in eighth. ""The last 20 minutes is the minimum that Valencia should show every week,"" said Neville. ""We wanted to win, a draw is not ideal, but it is positive given the circumstances."""

""Tiago suffered a non-displaced fracture in the third section of the right tibia,"" Atletico said via their official Twitter feed. However, the club refused to confirm how long the 34-year-old is expected to be sidelined. ""We love him a lot as a player and a person,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone. ""I am sure that from tomorrow he will be counting the days until he can play again. ""We send him all the energy of the group and hopefully he recovers quickly."" Tiago has been a crucial member of Atletico's success in recent seasons and had started all but one of their 18 games in La Liga and the Champions League so far this season."

However, Atletico struggled to create clear-cut opportunities and were nearly made to pay when David Simon headed against the bar for the visitors. Atletico have unusually been the biggest spenders in Spain over the close season after a quiet summer in the transfer market for Barcelona and Real Madrid. Jackson Martinez made his debut up front, whilst Filipe Luis returned at left-back after a difficult year at Chelsea. However, it was last season's top scorer Griezmann who again made the difference. The French international had already seen one effort fly just wide of the target before his free-kick from the edge of the box clipped the Las Palmas wall and wrong-footed Raul Lizoain. Simon had a great chance to level just before the hour mark as he was left unmarked at the back post from a corner but his header clipped the bar on its way behind. Martinez's underwhelming bow was then cut short as he was replaced by Fernando Torres. However, the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker almost handed Las Palmas an equaliser as he directed another dangerous corner towards his own goal and forced Jan Oblak into a brilliant save to ensure all three points. Atletico could have added to their added to their lead in the closing stages as Luis nearly marked his homecoming with a fine individual goal only to be denied by Lizoain. The Las Palmas 'keeper was beaten by another free-kick in stoppage time, but this time Koke's effort came back off the post. Earlier, David Moyes's Real Sociedad could only manage an uneventful 0-0 draw away at Deportivo la Coruna in a repeat of the result in the former Manchester United coach's first game in charge of the Basques last November. Espanyol got off to a winning start against Getafe thanks to Salva Sevilla's fine free-kick."
490,20/08/2015,02:17,Atletico still primed to be La Liga's third force,"Ahead of the start of the Spanish league season this weekend, AFP sports looks at the five sides best placed to upset Barcelona and Real Madrid's dominance of La Liga this season.","Atletico Madrid (Last season: third) Atletico's remarkable title triumph in 2013/14 is the only time Barca and Madrid have been denied the title for the past 11 years, but Diego Simeone's men look better placed to launch another title challenge than they did to defend their crown 12 months ago after another busy summer at the Vicente Calderon. The signings of strikers Jackson Martinez and Luciano Vietto to join forces with Antoine Griezmann and Fernando Torres in attack provide a frontline as deadly as when Radamel Falcao and Diego Costa were paired together in the early stages of Simeone's reign. Simeone also has a core of very promising youngsters to call on as Jose Maria Gimenez, Saul Niguez, Oliver Torres and Angel Correa are all expected to feature heavily. The loss of Arda Turan to Barcelona will sap the midfield of some creativity, but unlike in previous seasons Los Rojiblancos have been able to withstand big money bids for the likes of Griezmann, Diego Godin and Koke to form a team capable of challenging for honours at home and abroad. Valencia (Last season: fourth) Valencia's big investment last summer to get back into the Champions League has hamstrung their freedom in the transfer market as they have struggled to meet financial fair play regulations. Moreover, Los Che look set to lose their most important player from last season in Nicolas Otamendi. The promising young talents of Santi Mina and Zakaria Bakkali add to an already impressive array of attacking talent, but coping with the demands of European football with a small squad means a return to the top four is likely to be the height of Nuno Espirito Santo's men's ambition this season. Sevilla (Last season: fifth) Another Europa League title, their fourth in 10 years, provided a route back to the Champions League for Sevilla, but also acted as a shop window for some of their stars to snap up bumper contracts on offer around Europe. As ever, the club's sporting director Monchi appears to have dealt well with the money received from the sales of Aleix Vidal and Carlos Bacca with eight new signings providing plenty of options for coach Unai Emery. The capture of Ukranian star Yevhen Konoplyanka on a free transfer from Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk could prove to be the deal of the summer. Villarreal (Last season: sixth) Villarreal signalled their intent to break into the top four with the double capture of the highly-rated Samu Castillejo and Samuel Garcia from Malaga for 16 million euros and by bringing Roberto Soldado back to La Liga after a disastrous spell with Tottenham Hotspur. However, with competition at the top of the table so stiff, Marcelino's men may target winning the Europa League as the most realistic route back into the Champions League. Athletic Bilbao (Last season: seventh) The high point of Athletic's season may have already come before the league campaign even gets underway as they beat Barcelona 5-1 on aggregate to claim their frist trophy in 31 years in the shape of the Spanish Super Cup. A reliance on 34-year-old striker Aritz Aduriz makes a return to the top four unlikely, but the Basques are always dangerous in Cup competitions and could go far once more in the Copa del Rey and Europa League."
491,04/08/2015,15:41,Torres scores with first touch in Atletico win,Fernando Torres scored with his first touch as Atletico Madrid cruised to a 3-0 exhibition match victory over Sven-Goran Eriksson's Shanghai International Port Group (SIPG) in China on Tuesday.,"The former Liverpool and Chelsea striker came on at half-time and scored just seconds after the restart with a neat header from Yannick Carrasco's looping cross. In an open and attacking game played in very humid conditions at Shanghai Stadium, Atletico had opened the scoring in the ninth minute when Antoine Griezmann latched onto a long forward pass to slot the ball past SIPG keeper Sun Le. Moments before conceding, SIPG playmaker Dario Conca -- the third highest paid player in the world when he signed for Guangzhou Evergrande in 2011 -- could have scored. But the Argentine's low drive did not trouble Atletico keeper Jan Oblak. SIPG, currently leading the 16-team Chinese Super League, were without four first team regulars currently on international duty with China at the East Asia Cup in Wuhan. But they did not look out of place against their more illustrious opponents. However, in the 24th minute Atletico extended their lead when the ball fell to Griezmann on the edge of the box. The Frenchman scored his second of the night when his tame shot evaded SIPG keeper Sun to make it 2-0 to the Spanish giants. Atletico's Lucas Hernandez should have put his side further ahead in the 28th minute when the French defender crashed a header off the bar from close range. Torres scored the final goal of the match just after half-time, after which the pace of the game dropped considerably. SIPG's Ivorian forward Jean Evrard Kouassi troubled Atletico on the flanks in the second half with some dangerous balls into the box, but Shanghai lacked the firepower to breach the net of the 2014 Spanish League champions. Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group owns 20 per cent of Atletico Madrid and helped arrange its visit to China. Atletico beat Japanese club Sagan Tosu 4-1 on penalties on Saturday in the first game of their two-match Asian tour."

497,08/07/2015,13:58,Tottenham deal for Alderweireld,Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday signed Belgian defender Toby Alderweireld from Atletico Madrid -- setting up a potential legal battle with Premier League rivals Southampton.,"The London club are reported to have paid 10.4 million pounds (14.5 million euros) for the 26-year-old international who made a reputation for himself during a one-year loan at Southampton. Southampton had an option to buy Alderweireld but Atletico could pay £1.5 million to cancel that agreement. Southampton say the Spanish side did not do so on time and so they should have been allowed to sign the player Alderweireld. But Tottenham said Alderweireld has signed a contract until 2020 and showed pictures of the player in a Spurs shirt on their website. Alderweireld said on Twitter that he was ""very excited"" to move to Spurs, while also thanking Southampton who he called a ""great club"". ""I'm very proud to become a Spurs player,"" he said on the Spurs website. ""I'm very happy to be here and I hope to have a wonderful time with this team.

And Barcelona said that coach Luis Enrique had requested the signing as the Catalans look to strengthen their midfield following the departure of long-serving Xavi Hernandez. However, he arrives at the Camp Nou at a time of uncertainty, with a board running club affairs until elections for a new president are held on July 18. Barcelona therefore added that the signing comes with a clause that will allow the incoming president to sell Turan back to Atletico, albeit doing so will incur a fine of 10 percent of the transfer fee paid. In any case, Turan will not be able to make his debut for Barcelona until 2016, by which time the reigning European champions will have completed a FIFA-imposed transfer ban.

Juventus released a statement which said: ""Juventus Football Club can announce that an agreement has been reached with Atletico Madrid for the services of Mario Mandzukic, who has signed a four-year contract. ""A fee of 19m euros, payable in three separate installments, has been agreed, with a potential extra two million to be added if certain performance-related targets are met."" Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri said last week he was happy the club had moved to capture Mandzukic, who after a mitigated season at Atletico had been a target for Manchester United. ""We signed Mandzukic because we wanted him. He's a great player and I am very happy he's here,"" said Allegri, who in his first season in charge of the Old Lady steered Juve to the Champions League final only to suffer a 3-1 defeat to Barcelona. Mandzukic, who scored his country's opener in a recent 1-1 Euro 2016 qualifying draw against Italy, is one of Europe's top strikers but, having quit Bayern Munich in 2014 due to issues with coach Pep Guardiola's style of play, he then failed to completely convince Diego Simeone last season at Atletico. With Paulo Dybala (Palermo) and Simone Zaza (Sassuolo) recently added to a Juve front line comprising Alvaro Morata and Fernando Llorente -- who is being linked with a move to Monaco -- Allegri expects Mandzukic to settle quickly. But the 48-year-old coach said neither player would be a direct replacement for Tevez. ""Mandzukic has scored goals in every league, he has great character, is an international player and will do well,"" said Allegri. ""It's not like we have to replace Tevez. It's more a case of signing players and evaluating our playing style. Mandzukic is here, we have Simone Zaza, Kingsley Coman, Alvaro Morata and Dybala - all of whom are young, quality players."" Juve also got Sami Khedira from Real Madrid for free, signing the German international midfielder to a four-year deal as they look to strengthen what the club describes as ""one of the strongest midfields in world football"". Allegri added last week he expects Paul Pogba to remain for at least one more season despite reported interest in the French international from the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain."

""We are not in a position to comment on any proceedings that are ongoing. No further information can be provided for the time-being,"" said a FIFA spokesperson when contacted by AFP on Wednesday. Barcelona unsuccessfully appealed that ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), however, the appeal did delay the application of the ban until January which allowed them to sign seven players, including Luis Suarez last summer. The same route of appeal would be open to both last season's Champions League finalists should any ban be enforced. Cadena SER also reported that Madrid's unusually busy January transfer window had been carried out with one eye on a possible ban.

However, the visitors had to play the final 14 minutes with 10 men as Arda Turan was shown a second yellow card and Hernandez finally broke the deadlock over the two legs when he slotted into an empty net from Cristiano Ronaldo's pass. Madrid came into the game ravaged by injuries and suspensions as Marcelo, Luka Modric, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema missed out forcing coach Carlo Ancelotti to deploy Sergio Ramos in an unusual midfield position. The hosts still had by far the better of the first 45 minutes with Benzema's replacement Hernandez smashing into the side-netting with the first opening of the game. Ronaldo then pulled a shot wide from 20 yards on his weaker left foot, but Atletico grew into the game as the half went on and Turan tested Iker Casillas with a long-range effort that the Spanish captain comfortably handled. However, it was Real who ended the half the stronger as only great defending from Juanfran denied Hernandez at the back post before Jan Oblak did well to parry Ronaldo's dipping free-kick to safety. The best chance of the half fell to the World Player of the Year when Ronaldo was fed by James Rodriguez, but Oblak scampered from his goal to block in a similar manner to his vital save from Bale at the beginning of the first-leg. It was the hosts who again started on the front foot at the start of the second period as a sensational through ball from Isco played Hernandez in behind the Atletico defence, but the Manchester United loanee again failed to hit the target as his shot squirmed just wide of the far post. Atletico boss Diego Simeone then surprisingly withdrew top scorer Antoine Griezmann. However the visitors soon had their clearest opening of the night when Gabi's dinked cross picked out the run of Koke from midfield, only to see his header easily clutched by Casillas. Arguably the decisive moment in the tie came 14 minutes from time when Turan was shown a second yellow for a high challenge on Ramos. Moments later Oblak came to his side's rescue again when he turned Hernandez's effort wide after he spun away from Diego Godin. Hernandez finally got the all-important goal after brilliant work from Rodriguez and Ronaldo left the Mexican with the simplest of finishes from close range."
504,21/04/2015,17:52,Simeone: Real absences won't affect Atletico,Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone has refused to accept a host of injuries and suspensions to key Real Madrid players has given his side the upper hand in their Champions League quarter-final tie.,"Simeone's side travel to the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday with a semi-final place on the line after a 0-0 draw in the first-leg last week extending Atletico's unbeaten run over Real to seven games this season. The hosts will be without the injured Luka Modric, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, as well as Marcelo through suspension. ""The characteristics of the players that will come in are not the same,"" Simeone said on Tuesday. ""That alerts you to the enthusiasm those that will replace them will play with, but not much changes for us. We just need to look for a way to cause them problems."" Atletico held on particularly in the first-half at the Vicente Calderon last week as Real peppered Jan Oblak's goal. But Simeone insisted he wasn't surprised by the European champions' performance despite the fact they have failed to score in four visits to the Calderon this season. ""Their intensity in the first-half was among the best they've played all season. ""They moved the ball, were direct and quick. It is what you expect of one of the best teams in the world and that is what they are."" By contrast, Atletico are almost at full strength as Simeone confirmed that Modric's Croatian international teammate Mario Mandzukic will be fit to feature despite an ongoing ankle problem meaning the suspended Mario Suarez is the only man unavailable to the Argentine."
505,21/04/2015,02:12,How Simeone painted Madrid red,"In the dying moments of Diego Simeone's second Madrid derby in charge of Atletico, a banner was lowered behind the goal his side was defending to display a stinging message: ""Wanted: A dignified rival for a decent derby"".","The display by the Real Madrid ultras had more truth to it than the usual chutzpah exchanged between rival fans. It had been 13 years since Atletico had beaten Real, a run that would stretch into a 14th year and 25th match when Real's reserves won out once more at the Vicente Calderon five months later. Suddenly, though, on an unseasonably cold Madrid May evening, the tide began to turn in the Spanish capital. Having waited for so long for a derby win, Atletico did so in style by beating Real in their own backyard at the Santiago Bernabeu to win the Copa del Rey in what proved to be Jose Mourinho's last competitive game in charge. In 14 derbies in less than two years since, Atletico have won six to Real's four and added the Spanish Supercup and an unthinkable La Liga title to their trophy haul in just over three years since Simeone took over. Moreover, three of the five trophies won under the Argentine have been garnered by overcoming the vast gap in financial wealth between Atletico and their neighbours, as well as Spanish football's other powerhouse, Barcelona. Simeone has revolutionised a club that once used to revel in their label as ""El Pupas"" - the jinxed ones. Even the club's own marketing campaign used to be based around a confused young boy asking his father ""why do we support Atleti?"" Now they have the charismatic leader that means their faith is no longer blind. On Atletico's league title parade last season, Simeone addressed the adoring masses with the symbolic message: ""This is not just a league title, ladies and gentlemen, this is something much more important that these boys have shown you, that if you believe and you work, you can achieve."" The remnants of Atletico's historic ability to come up on the wrong side of destiny were still to dog them, though, in the Champions League final in Lisbon against Real last May. One minute away from winning a first-ever European Cup, just as they had been 40 years ago in their only previous final against Bayern Munich, they conceded with barely a minute remaining. Real went on to romp to a 10th European Cup 4-1 in extra-time with Simeone being sent off for storming on to the field to confront Raphael Varane as tempers flared. Yet, it is a testament to the change in mental strength around the club that rather than be beaten down by that experience, Atletico have rolled off a seven-game unbeaten streak in the derby themselves this season, which leaves Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, second leg, tantalisingly poised after a 0-0 first-leg stalemate last week. ""Atletico is a very different club now,"" said Fernando Torres on his return to his boyhood club in January. 'El Nino' had never scored at the Bernabeu in six years in his first stint at Atletico; he did so twice in his first visit in his second spell as Atletico dumped Real out of the Copa del Rey just days after his return. However, as much as Simeone and his players publicly try to deny it, there remains unfinished business from Lisbon. Simeone himself acknowledged ahead of last week's first leg that victories in the league, Cup or Supercup cannot be compared to Europe's premier club competition. Now, presented with the chance to land a knock-out blow to an injury-hit Real in the competition they cherish the most, another date with destiny awaits Torres and the rest of Simeone's men at the Bernabeu on Wednesday."
506,21/04/2015,02:07,Injury-hit Real tasked with breaking down Atletico wall,Real Madrid have the unenviable task of beating city rivals Atletico Madrid at the eighth attempt this season if they are to progress to a fifth consecutive Champions League semi-final.,"The European champions have failed to overcome Atletico in seven games since beating Los Rojiblancos in last season's Champions League final, including last week's 0-0 draw in the first-leg at the Vicente Calderon, and have also been struck by a series of injuries and suspensions to key players. Luka Modric and Gareth Bale will miss out after limping off with knee and calf injuries respectively in the 3-1 win over Malaga at the weekend, whilst Marcelo is banned and Karim Benzema faces a race against time to be fit due to a knee problem. Given those absences, the return to fitness and form of James Rodriguez is a huge boost for Los Blancos. The Colombian World Cup star has scored twice in four games after a two-month injury layoff due to a broken foot to take his tally to an impressive 14 in his first season at the Bernabeu. ""Before I was out I was scoring goals, playing at a good level and now I think it is the same,"" he told Madrid's website. ""I want to continue like this, using my characteristics to help the team achieve important objectives. ""We are all dreaming of getting through this round and if I can score as well then it would be great. The most important thing is to win and get through this very difficult game, but we are in our own stadium with our own fans. I think it could be a great game."" However, Real will be faced with arguably the best defence in Europe on Wednesday. Atletico have conceded just once in their last eight Champions League games and have shutout their local rivals in four of their previous seven meetings this season. ""Atletico are an intense team that are very good at the back,"" added Rodriguez. ""There is always pressure. We have to manage it and we are going to do everything we can to win an 11th European Cup."" By contrast, Atletico have a clean bill of health with striker Mario Mandzukic expected to shake off an ongoing ankle problem to start alongside the in-form Antoine Griezmann up front. Diego Simeone's men remain the underdogs in just their second Champions League quarter-final in 18 years, but midfielder Raul Garcia refuted the suggestion they have less to lose than the holders. ""I don't think we have less pressure. It is the quarter-finals of the Champions League and the two teams want to go through. ""Time will give more value to what we are achieving. Now it seems normal to be in the quarter-finals, to get to the semis would be very important."" Garcia maintained the Atletico party line of recent weeks in insisting there is no thirst for revenge after losing out in heartbreaking circumstances to Real in the Lisbon final last May. However, he also dismissed the idea that Atletico now have a mental hold over Carlo Ancelotti's men having beaten them over two legs in the Spanish Supercup and the Copa del Rey already this season. ""Lisbon is forgotten. We don't live in the past. We would have loved to have won, but it doesn't change anything. If we had won, we would still want to go through now. ""We have to forget the previous games this year too. They only serve to know that we are doing the right things. We always say the games that have already been played don't matter."""
507,19/04/2015,11:51,Reports: Bale and Modric to miss Atletico return,"Real Madrid suffered a double injury blow as Spanish media reported on Sunday that both Gareth Bale and Luka Modric have been ruled out of their decisive Champions League quarter-final, second leg against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday.","Both players limped off during Saturday's 3-1 win over Malaga with Bale suffering a left calf problem after less than five minutes and Modric injuring his right knee on the hour. Real boss Carlo Ancelotti refused to rule out the former Spurs duo for Atletico's visit immediately after the match. However, Madrid sports daily Marca reported that both players left the Santiago Bernabeu on crutches and could be set for several weeks on the sidelines. Modric's injury is expected to be the more serious as it was reported he has sprained knee ligaments. The Croatian has only recently returned from a five-month injury lay-off and his presence has coincided with Madrid's upturn in form in recent weeks. Real and Atletico are locked at 0-0 after the first leg last week in a repeat of last season's Champions League final. Real were victorious on that occasion, 4-1 after extra time, but they have been unable to beat Atletico in seven attempts this campaign."
508,16/04/2015,17:37,Torres: Gerrard is the 'best I've ever played with',Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres has hailed former Liverpool teammate Steven Gerrard as the best player he has ever played with ahead of a host of Spanish World Cup winners.,"Torres won back-to-back European Championships as well as the 2010 World Cup with Spain playing alongside the likes of Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta, but he said Gerrard, who he shared a successful spell with at Liverpool between 2007 and 2011, is his ideal player. ""It is very difficult to choose because I have had the luck to play with a lot of great footballers. For me, the best is and has been Gerrard,"" Torres said in an interview with Spanish newspaper Marca. ""I would chose him above all if I had to have him in my team, if I had him behind me. Steven Gerrard is the best player I have played with throughout my career, therefore my ideal player would be very like him."" After leaving Liverpool for a disappointing four-year stint at Chelsea, Torres is now back where his career began at Atletico. And the 31-year-old hinted that he could be involved in coaching at Atletico's youth academy once the time comes to hang up his boots. ""For me it would be nice to work with the kids. I think it is important that they have the right coaching and the club is doing a good job in that aspect at the moment. ""I compare it to when I started and now they have a lot more facilities and can develop much better."""

511,15/04/2015,14:03,Mandzukic clears Carvajal of biting in battle of Madrid,Atletico Madrid striker Mario Mandzukic on Wednesday cleared Real rival Dani Carvajal of biting him in their Champions League clash but a punch delivered by the Real defender could still cost him a ban.,"Mandzukic backed Carvajal's denials of a bite in a Twitter statement after the bruising quarter final clash encounter on Tuesday night which ended 0-0. ""Yesterday's match was very hard and both teams gave everything, but for me there was no controversy, no bite, or anything,"" the Croat striker said. ""We're all thinking about Saturday's match against Deportivo which is very important."" Mandzukic ended the Champions League game with a bloodied face after an elbow from Real defender Sergio Ramos. But his clash with Spanish international Carvajal dominated post-match talk. Battling in the penalty area, Mandzukic's arm is raised to hold back his rival. As Carvajal moves round, his mouth comes close to Mandzukic's arm and then he lands a punch in the striker's stomach. Serbian referee Milorad Mazic was unsighted and Carvajal was extremely lucky not to concede a penalty for the punch. But the images soon dominated social media and Carvajal, who could still face retroactive action by UEFA, was quick to react on his Twitter account. ""I saw after the game that I am accused of biting an opponent player, I want to clarify that I have not bitten anyone, nor attempted to,"" he said. Film from the mixed zone after the game, broadcast by Spanish channel Neox, showed a small mark on Mandzukic's arm. But there was no way of telling whether it was a bite or a cut. While Mandzukic's comments will ease Carvajal's woes, he could still face action over the punch. And his absence for the second leg would be a blow for Real Madrid next Wednesday. They will already be without another key defender Marcelo who reached his yellow card limit in the game. Atletico Madrid's Mario Suarez made an apology meanwhile for making comments about the Serbian referee after the goalless draw. ""The referee was very bad. You can't have a Serbian in charge of a Champions League quarter-final, that isn't taking it seriously enough,"" Suarez fumed after the game. ""I hope that in the second-leg the referee will be better with more fluid and normal decisions. ""The referee wasn't up to it, but they made mistakes as we do."" The 28-year-old defensive midfielder was booked in the game and will be suspended for the return. And he quickly backtracked on his comments on Twitter. ""I'd like to apologise if anyone was offended by my words after the match, that wasn't my intention,"" he said. ""I wanted to say that in a match of this magnitude you should designate a referee from a major league."" However his Brazilian teammate Miranda also said the referee for such a big game should not come from ""a minor league""."
512,15/04/2015,11:50,Carvajal denies bite after blood battle with Mandzukic,The Champions League battle of Madrid left Atletico striker Mario Mandzukic with a bloodied face and controversy over whether he was bitten by Real defender Dani Carvajal.,"Carvajal strongly denied even trying to bite the Croatian striker. But he could still face action for landing a punch at Mandzukic that the referee did not see. Madrid newspapers speculated that the 23 year-old Spanish international could be suspended for next week's return match in their Champions League quarter final. The tie was left 0-0 after Tuesday's first leg at the Vicente Calderon stadium, but there was much spotlight on the Carvajal-Mandzukic clash. Battling in the penalty area, Mandzukic's arm is raised to hold back his rival. As Carvajal moves round, his mouth comes close to Mandzukic's arm and then he lands a punch in the striker's stomach.

Film from the mixed zone after the game, broadcast by Spanish channel Neox, showed a small cut on Mandzukic's arm. But there was no way of telling whether it was a cut. The 28-year-old Croatian had already been in the wars. He was left with a bloody nose thanks to a stray elbow from Madrid defender Sergio Ramos. Carvajal's absence for the second leg would be a blow for Real Madrid next Wednesday. They will already be without another key defender Marcelo who reached his yellow card limit in the game. Football bites have been a major talking point since Uruguayan Luis Suarez was banned from all football activity for four months last year for sinking his teeth into Italian World Cup opponent Giorgio Chiellini. Atletico Madrid's Mario Suarez made an apology meanwhile for making comments about the Serbian referee after the goalless draw. ""The referee was very bad. You can't have a Serbian in charge of a Champions League quarter-final, that isn't taking it seriously enough,"" Suarez fumed after the game.

The 28-year-old picked up a booking and will miss next week's second leg through suspension. But he risks much worse than that after claiming UEFA should not have put a Serbian in charge of such an important match. ""The referee was very bad. You can't have a Serbian in charge of a Champions League quarter-final, that isn't taking it seriously enough,"" fumed Suarez. ""I hope that in the second-leg the referee will be better with more fluid and normal decisions. ""The referee wasn't up to it, but they made mistakes as we do. ""The game was very evenly balanced, we know each other so well and the tie is still open."" Suarez quickly tried to backtrack on social media, taking to Twitter to explain his comments. ""I'd like to apologise if anyone was offended by my words after the match, that wasn't my intention,"" he said. ""I wanted to say that in a match of this magnitude you should designate a referee from a major league."" Real Madrid dominated the first half at the Vicente Calderon stadium but couldn't break the deadlock. However, coach Carlo Ancelotti challenged his players to match their first-half performance against Atletico Madrid for the full 90 minutes next week. The European champions have now failed to score in all four visits to the Calderon this season as Atletico extended their unbeaten run over Los Blancos this season to seven games. However, Real were by far the dominant side in the opening period and would have been out of sight in the tie had it not been for a string of fine saves from Atletico keeper Jan Oblak. ""It is the best of the bad results,"" said Ancelotti. ""Atletico are one of the best sides in the world defensively and Oblak had a great game. ""I think that in the first-half we deserved more than to be 0-0 at half-time. We need to highlight the performance in the first-half which was fantastic. ""In the second-half, Atletico pressured more and the game was more even. ""It isn't a brilliant result but we have confidence for the return leg, especially based on the first-half performance."" Atletico boss Diego Simeone also hailed Oblak's contribution after the Argentine kept faith with the Slovenian despite the return to fitness of Miguel Angel Moya. ""Oblak was great, especially in the chance for (Gareth) Bale, which was the clearest opportunity. ""The best thing was the reaction we had. Any other team that had been damaged as we were in the first-half would have ended up relenting, but in the second-half the game became much closer to what we had imagined at the start."" And Simeone insisted that Atletico's hoodoo over Real won't count for anything come the return leg on April 22 at the Santiago Bernabeu, the scene of Los Rojiblancos first win over Real for 14 years in the Copa del Rey final two seasons ago. ""It doesn't mean anything because the 14 years did not mean anything for the final and we won the Cup. It will be a different game. It is a classic game with the tension and excitement that anyone who loves football likes to see."" A second period short on chances was overshadowed by refereeing decisions. Madrid defender Dani Carvajal was forunate to escape without being sent-off and giving away a penalty for a punch on Mario Mandzukic."
514,14/04/2015,22:46,Atletico extend unbeaten run over Real in stalemate,Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid will fight it out for a place in the Champions League semi-finals next week after the two couldn't be separated in a 0-0 first-leg draw at the Vicente Calderon on Tuesday.,"The visitors had by far the better of the chances, particularly in the first period, and Atletico were grateful to goalkeeper Jan Oblak for keeping them in the tie with a string of fine saves. However, for the fourth time this season Real failed to score at the Calderon as Atletico extended their unbeaten run in the Madrid derby this season to seven games. And the sides meet for the eighth time at the Santiago Bernabeu on April 22. Atletico boss Diego Simeone kept faith with Oblak in goal ahead of the fit again Miguel Angel Moya and that decision paid dividends after just four minutes when Gareth Bale pounced on an uncharacteristic error from Diego Godin, but placed his shot too close to the on-rushing Slovenian, who spread himself well to make the save. Oblak was kept busy throughout the first 45 minutes as he held a free-kick from Cristiano Ronaldo before palming away another fiercely struck shot from Bale. His best stop was yet to come as he dived low to his left to turn James Rodriguez's inventive attempt with the outside of his left foot to safety. At the other end, Iker Casillas wasn't forced into action until eight minutes from the break when he comfortably held Antoine Griezmann's shot on the turn. The chances continued to come for the visitors as Luka Modric blasted just over when well-placed at the edge of the box before Oblak was tested again by Rodriguez at the end of a stunning counter-attack led by Raphael Varane. Atletico started the second period more brightly with Arda Turan heading wide from Juanfran's cross. Mario Mandzukic was then left with a bloody nose thanks to a stray elbow from Sergio Ramos and the Croatian was on the end of more rough treatment soon after when Dani Carvajal punched him in the stomach. Carvajal wasn't punished at the time by Serbian referee Milorad Mazic so could yet be banned for the return leg. Real still dominated possession after the interval, but couldn't get the break of the ball inside the area as Atletico somehow scrambled the ball clear 20 minutes from time with Ronaldo and Bale having numerous attempts blocked. The European champions were dealt a blow a minute from time as Marcelo saw a yellow card that will keep him out of the second leg. And it was Real who were forced to hold on in the final stages as Casillas scrambled clear Mario Suarez's effort from close range."
515,13/04/2015,18:13,"Simeone puts faith in Oblak, Mandzukic","Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone confirmed on Monday that Mario Mandzukic and goalkeeper Jan Oblak will start his side's Champions League quarter-final, first leg against Real Madrid.","Croatian striker Mandzukic returned to training on Sunday after missing league outings against Real Sociedad and Malaga in the past week due to a recurring ankle injury and is expected to take the place of Fernando Torres alongside Antoine Griezmann in attack. Oblak, meanwhile, was one of the heros of Atletico's last 16 win on penalties over Bayer Leverkusen as he replaced the injured Miguel Angel Moya and saved from Hakan Calhanoglu as Los Rojiblancos won the shootout 3-2. Neither Mandzukic or Oblak were part of the Atletico side that were just a minute away from delivering the club's first ever Champions League last season until a stoppage time Sergio Ramos goal allowed Real to go onto clinch their 10th European Cup by adding three more goals in extra time to run out 4-1 winners. Atletico have responded in style to that disappointment by winning four and drawing two of the six Madrid derbies between the two sides this season. However, Simeone believes it is another famous victory against Madrid from two years ago in the Copa del Rey final that Atletico can draw inspiration. ""I am not looking back at the previous games. To play in the quarter-finals of the Champions League is not the same as a league game or the Copa del Rey. ""We have a great game ahead of us and our intention is to play with intensity. I forsee a similar game to the one we played two years ago in their stadium (Copa del Rey final). They played with great intensity and I imagine it will be very similar tomorrow."" Despite ending Real Madrid and Barcelona's 10-year dominance of the Spanish game to win La Liga last season, Simeone has repeatedly insisted that Los Rojiblancos cannot be expected to compete with Spanish football's two perennial powerhouses over the 38-game league season. However, under Simeone Atletico have been cup specialists in winning the Europa League, Copa del Rey, Spanish Supercup and reaching the final of the Champions League last season for the first time in 40 years. And Atletico have already shown their ability to beat Real over two-legs twice this season in the Supercup final and the Copa del Rey last 16. ""In a league campaign of so many games you can see who are the teams with the biggest budget"" added the Argentine. ""In a knockout tie the difference is reduced. Tomorrow is the first of two games and both sides have a chance to go through."""
516,13/04/2015,14:29,Ancelotti targeting more Champions League glory,Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti insisted his side's focus is on retaining the Champions League not gaining revenge over Atletico Madrid when the two sides meet for a seventh time this season in the first leg of their quarter-final on Tuesday.,"Ancelotti's men have failed to beat Los Rojiblancos in all six previous meetings, drawing two and losing four, most notably in a 4-0 thrashing when they last met in February. However, Real were the victors in last season's Champions League final between the two and Ancelotti, who could become the first coach to win the Champions League four times, wants Los Blancos to be the first side to retain the trophy since the AC Milan side he played for in 1990. ""We are not obsessed with Atletico Madrid. We have the desire required for the Champions League quarter-finals,"" the Italian said on Monday. ""It could take us to the semi-final, which is very close to the final. Then once you are in the final there are only two options; to win it or lose it. ""Therefore, our objective is not to beat Atletico Madrid, but to dream about winning the 11th European Cup."" Ancelotti described Real's humilation the last time they visited the Vicente Calderon as his worst game in charge of Madrid. However, the Real side that will take to the field on Tuesday will be much changed with five first-team regulars back from either injury or suspension. ""We come into the game in good shape. You can't compare it to what happened in February. Everyone has recovered, the team is fresh and it is clear we can use a high tempo in the game. ""We can play with intensity and it will be vital to show courage and personality because they are two very important characteristics. This team has a lot of courage."" And Ancelotti dismissed suggestions that his job is on the line should Real once again fail to overcome their more humble city neighbours. ""This game is only part of the season. Afterwards there will be other games and I think that the judgement of my work will come at the end of the season."" Left-back Marcelo was one of those to miss the 4-0 thrashing and he insisted that Real can not allow themselves to be mentally affected by the six derbies they have failed to win this season. ""Atletico are a great team, they fight a lot, they are very intense and we are not thinking in the other games that we couldn't win,"" said the Brazilian international. ""I think it is completely different now and we have two games to show that we can win."" Ancelotti confirmed that Gareth Bale is 100 percent fit to take his place in the starting line-up after missing Saturday's 3-0 win over Eibar, whilst James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos return from suspension meaning Isco is likely to miss out. The only doubt in Ancelotti's starting line-up is at centre-back where the former Chelsea boss has to choose between the fit again Pepe and Raphael Varane to partner Sergio Ramos."
517,13/04/2015,02:07,"Atletico, Real face quarter-final with revenge in mind","Last season's Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid meet for the seventh time this season in Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg with revenge in mind for both.","Real took the spoils in Lisbon last May as Sergio Ramos's stoppage time header denied Atletico their first ever European Cup and sent the game into extra time when Los Blancos romped to a 4-1 win. However, the tables have been turned this season as Atletico have won four and drawn two of the six meetings so far this season. That run has included two aggregate victories over two legs in the Spanish Supercup and the Copa del Rey. Yet, it was their last encounter in La Liga in February that was the most embarrassing for Real as Atletico romped to their biggest victory in a Madrid derby for 28 years in a 4-0 rout. ""The last result against Atletico is a motivating factor for us,"" said Real boss Carlo Ancelotti. ""It will be a different game, but difficult as it always is against Atletico. ""We come into the game in good form, we are motivated and we will give everything we have. ""I don't have any doubt that it will be an intense game. ""That will be an important component of the game, but there will also be others that we need to utilise."" However, unlike that most recent meeting at the Vicente Calderon when they were without five first-team regulars, Real are at full strength for the first time in five months. James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos return from suspension after missing Saturday's 3-0 win over Eibar which moved Real back to within two points of Barcelona at the top of La Liga. Meanwhile, Gareth Bale returned to training on Sunday and is expected to fit to start. Atletico have received a huge injury boost of their own with the news that Mario Mandzukic will be available after overcoming an ankle problem which kept him out of their last two games. The Croatian has scored 20 goals since signing from Bayern Munich last summer, including two in three games against Madrid at the Calderon. Raul Garcia is also expected to recover from an elbow problem meaning Diego Simeone will also have a fully-fit squad to choose from. However, the Argentine has a number of key decisions to make, most notably in goal where the in-form Jan Oblak kept his place ahead of the fit again Miguel Angel Moya for Saturday's 2-2 draw at Malaga and in central defence where Jose Maria Gimenez and Miranda will battle it out to partner Diego Godin. The draw at Malaga extended Atletico's unbeaten run in all competitions to eight games, albeit with four draws along the way. Most encouragingly for Simeone's men is the return to goalscoring form of Antoine Griezmann. The Frenchman scored twice at La Rosaleda to take his tally over the last three games to four and move one ahead of Mandzukic at Atletico's top scorer this season."
518,12/04/2015,02:21,Real fired up for Atletico revenge - Ancelotti,Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has said his side will be out to avenge the humiliation of their 4-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid in February when the sides meet in the Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday.,"Los Blancos beat Atletico 4-1 after extra time to win their 10th European Cup in last season's final, but the La Liga champions have turned the tide in the Spanish capital this season with four wins and two draws in six previous meetings this campaign. The most recent of those matches was the most embarrassing for Real as Atletico outplayed Ancelotti's men from first minute to last to seal their biggest win in a Madrid derby for 28 years. ""The last result against Atletico is a motivating factor for us. It will be a different game, but difficult as it always is against Atletico,"" said Ancelotti after his side closed to within two points of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with a 3-0 win over Eibar on Saturday. ""We come into the game in good form, we are motivated and we will give everything we have."" In stark contrast to when the sides last met, Real will be at full strength as Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez return from suspension, whilst Gareth Bale is expected to shake off the muscle problem which forced him to miss out on Saturday. Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Marcelo, Luka Modric and Rodriguez all missed the 4-0 thrashing due to either injury or suspension and Ancelotti insisted that having their experience back in the side will help to compete with Atletico's famed intensity. ""I don't have any doubt that it will be an intense game. ""That will be an important component of the game, but there will also be others that we need to utilise. ""I am very clear about Tuesday, the only thing we lack is the result."" Atletico had a far more uncomfortable afternoon as they were held to a 2-2 draw at Malaga. Antoine Griezmann took his tally for the season to 21 as he opened and rounded off the scoring either side of a Fernando Torres own goal and lovely finish from Samuel Garcia midway through the second-half. ""We wanted to win the game, but it wasn't to be. It was a difficult match against an opponent that played with a lot of intensity,"" said the French international. ""Now we need to rest and think about the Champions League."" A draw does at least leave Atletico well placed for a return to the Champions League next season as they lead Sevilla and Valencia by four points in the fight for a top four finish."
519,07/04/2015,22:39,Atletico too good for Moyes's Sociedad,Atletico Madrid moved to within six points of La Liga leaders Barcelona thanks to a comfortable 2-0 win over David Moyes's Real Sociedad on Tuesday.,"The champions never looked in danger from the moment Mikel Gonzalez headed into his own net after just two minutes. Antoine Griezmann then doubled the hosts' advantage against his former club shortly afterwards to end the game as a contest inside the first 10 minutes. Barcelona can regain their nine-point lead over Atletico when they and closest challengers Real Madrid are in action against Almeria and Rayo Vallecano respectively on Wednesday. ""Both the goals are down to mistakes we made,"" lamented Moyes. ""I don't think it is a free-kick on the first goal, but we have to defend it and we didn't. We made mistakes and we made mistakes for the second goal as well."" Defeat all but ends Sociedad's outside hopes of qualifying for the Europa League, but the former Manchester United boss insisted he never thought that was a realistic target having taken over the Basque outfit with the remit of avoiding relegation. ""I've aways felt like it would be too difficult to make Europe. The distance to make up was too far,"" Moyes added. ""We've been on a very good run. We've had two difficult away games and I think the players have done a lot of good things."" Sociedad beat Atletico 2-1 when the sides met back in November and came into the game having lost just one of their last eight La Liga games, but were on the back foot straight away as Arda Turan volleyed against the post inside 60 seconds. The visitors managed to scramble the rebound behind but from the resulting corner, Gonzalez could only flick Koke's in-swinging delivery into the far corner. Eight minutes later it was 2-0 as Geronimo Rulli could only parry Koke's fierce drive into the path of Griezmann, who slammed the ball high into the net but refused to celebrate out of respect to the club he spent nine years with prior to his big money move to Atletico last summer. Griezmann came close to inflicting more pain on his former employers as he was denied by a last-ditch tackle from Gonzalez before nodding just wide from another dangerous corner. Sociedad gradually grew into the game, but only seriously threatened Jan Oblak's goal when Chory Castro's powerful shot forced the Slovenian into a smart save. Atletico took the sting out of the game in the second-half with next week's Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid in mind. However, they were still characteristically solid at the back to secure a fifth consecutive clean sheet and move four points clear of Valencia in the fight to make it back to the Champions League next season."

""It happened 10 matches ago, against Leverkusen, he turned his ankle,"" said Simeone. ""But he always maintained his consistency in every match. Against Leverkusen he played more than 80 minutes on one leg but with incredible commitment to the team."" Simeone said Mandzukic had gone to see him on Sunday to tell his coach that he was only playing at 70 percent and no longer felt able to give his all to the team. ""Tomorrow he won't play but we're hoping that when he comes back he can take his place (in the team),"" added Simeone. Atletico need Mandzukic, who has scored 12 league goals this season, to get fit quickly as they play Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals on April 14 and 22."
521,04/04/2015,20:17,Atletico up to third with win at Cordoba,La Liga champions Atletico Madrid moved up to third thanks to a routine win 2-0 away at Cordoba on Sunday.,"Antoine Griezmann latched onto a poor pass from Bruno Zuculini to drill home the opener after just five minutes before Saul Niguez made it 2-0 six minutes before half-time on his return after a lengthy injury layoff. Valencia can regain third sport with victory over Villarreal on Sunday, whilst the top two Barcelona and Real Madrid are also in action on Sunday against Celta Vigo and Granada respectively. Cordoba remain rooted to the foot of the table after a 10th consecutive defeat and there seemed little doubt that Atletico would secure their first away win since January from the moment Griezmann drove at the Cordoba defence and slotted home his 18th goal of the season early on. Diego Godin could have doubled Atletico's lead shortly afterwards, but sent his header too close to Cordoba 'keeper Juan Carlos. However, it was no surprise when the visitors made it 2-0 from another set-piece as Jesus Gamez's throw-in was flicked on by Jose Maria Gimenez and Saul nodded the ball into the far corner. Atletico were able to comfortably sit on their lead after the break with Cordoba only coming close in the closing stages when former Manchester United reject Bebe sent a thunderous strike off the crossbar. Earlier, Sevilla maintained their pursuit of a top four finish with a comfortable 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Aleix Vidal pounced on an error by Athletic goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz to open the scoring after just three minutes. Carlos Bacca then stabbed home his 20th goal of the season midway through the first-half to double Sevilla's lead. And Athletic's miserable afternoon was rounded off as Iker Muniain had to be stretchered off in tears after appearing to suffer a serious knee injury. Victory extended Sevilla's unbeaten run at home to 31 games stretching back over 13 months and they could have a vital part to play in the title race with both Barcelona and Real Madrid still to visit the Sanchez Pizjuan this season."

Wanda Chairman Wang Jianlin, a diehard football fan, said his company was delighted at their deal. ""The Wanda Group is delighted to be able to contribute to the growth of Atletico Madrid and their development in the Asian market, as well as counting on their magnificent experience in youth coaching which will without doubt help in the growth of Chinese football,"" said Wang in a statement published on Atletico's site. Last January, club president Enrique Cerezo met Wang in Beijing to put into place the agreement and purchase. According to the terms, Atletico will set up a football academy in Spain for young Chinese players while the team will also tour China in the years to come. The deal is further evidence of Atletico's intention to maintain their recent success at the top of the European game. Los Rojiblancos ended Barcelona and Real Madrid's 10-year domination of La Liga by winning the title and reaching the Champions League final last season, whilst they will face Real in a repeat of that final in the last eight of this season's competition in April. Last week inspirational coach Diego Simeone extended his contract with the club until 2020. ""This is a very important step for the club in its effort to construct a leading brand on a global level. It will help us to maintain the level of competitiveness on a sporting level of the past few years and consolidate us among the top clubs worldwide,"" added Atletico CEO Miguel Angel Gil Marin. Wang's love of football has paid handsome dividends before. His Wanda Group greatly increased its profile in China after he bought a Dalian football club in 1994, renamed it after the firm, and transformed it into the strongest team in China. In February, the Wanda Group agreed to buy Infront -- the Swiss sports marketing group headed by FIFA president Sepp Blatter's nephew and which holds some broadcasting rights to the World Cup -- for 1.05 billion euros ($1.2 billion). The Chinese property and entertainment conglomerate is looking to increase its influence in the global sports business, as Beijing bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics while rumours swirl that China could seek to host the 2026 football World Cup."

""The club is undergoing a period of solid growth and I chose to stay where I am,"" Simeone told a news conference. ""I am convinced that the club will continue to grow, I see it getting stronger, I see it enthusiastic."" In January Chinese multi-billionaire Wang Jianlin bought a 20 percent stake in Atletico and Simeone has reportedly been told the club will not need to sell their best players to meet huge debt repayments as in the past. Wang, who is number 42 on Forbes magazine's list of the world's richest people with a fortune estimated at $18 billion, will invest a much-needed 45 million euros ($52 million) into the Atletico coffers for his share of the club. Simeone has had a successful spell at the Spanish side since he took charge in December 2011 after the club suffered a humiliating King's Cup loss to third-division side Albacete. Simeone led Atletico to the 2012 Europa League title before his side beat city rivals Real Madrid in the 2013 King's Cup final held at Real's Bernabeu stadium. Under his watch Atletico won its first La Liga title in 18 years in 2013-14 and narrowly lost to Real Madrid in the Champions League final."

Real emerged victorious in the Lisbon final last May as Sergio Ramos's stoppage time header prevented Atletico from winning the trophy for the first time, before goals in extra-time from Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo sealed a 4-1 win. However, the tables have turned quickly in the Spanish capital with Atletico winning four and drawing two of the six meetings between the sides this season, including a 4-0 rout in their most recent clash last month. Real were shorn of five key first team regulars that day and the club's director of institutional relations, Emilio Butragueno, is confident it will be a different story when the European champions are at full-strength. ""I think the Champions League has a different perspective and the circumstances are different,"" he said. ""If we can get all our injured players back, the first game is on the 14th, so we have three weeks to go, which is a long time.

""They are very dangerous opponents and we have a lot of respect for them. We have the experience from the group stages of a win and a defeat, and after eliminating Chelsea they have shown their credentials as strong candidates for the competition,"" Enrique told Barca's website. ""Although the absence of Ibrahimovic and Verrati are important, I am sure they will be replaced by top players and will be just as dangerous. ""The second leg at home isn't significant. It is important to get a good result in the first leg and try to qualify for the semi-finals in front of our own fans.""

""I never had any doubt I made the right decision in coming here. This is something I'll never forget,"" said Torres, who came through the ranks to captain the club before leaving for Liverpool 2007. ""To play in the Champions League on nights like this is a gift."" Mario Suarez scored the only goal of the night in normal time as Atletico cancelled out the Germans' 1-0 first leg advantage to send the tie the full distance. And in a topsy-turvy shootout that included five misses, Atletico squeezed through to the last eight for the second consecutive season. ""The last time I was at a Champions League game at the Calderon I was 11 or 12,"" added Torres. ""To experience it on the field is incredible. I can only thank the fans. The were supporting us until the end and that is why they are the best fans in the world."" The drama at the Calderon outweighed good football as chances were hard to come by throughout the 120 minutes. ""We controlled the game but with the score as it was, it wasn't easy,"" said Torres. ""A draw was a fair result over the two legs and once it goes to penalties, the team that has the most luck wins."" To cap a glorious night for Atletico, it was also confirmed that inspirational coach Diego Simeone is nearing an agreement with a club on a contract extension until 2020. ""We are going to have good news in the coming days,"" his sister and agent Natalia Simeone told Television Espanola. Simeone himself insisted he had not yet put pen to paper and instead wanted to highlight the incredible effort made by his players despite missing the experienced duo of Diego Godin and Tiago through suspension. ""I value greatly the effort of the group, they work very hard. They never give up, and you can see that today even with those that haven't played as many minutes (throughout the season),"" said the Argentine. ""It is very difficult for a team like Atletico Madrid to be in the best eight teams in Europe two years in a row."" Leverkusen boss Roger Schmidt, meanwhile, hailed the efforts of his young side to take last season's beaten finalists to the brink of elimination. ""After conceding an early goal we defended very well, we made an extraordinary effort. ""We have to bear in mind that we have a young team without much experience and it isn't easy to resist such pressure in a stadium like the Vicente Calderon.

And after a topsy turvy shootout including five missed penalties, Stefan Kiessling blazed Leverkusen's final effort over the bar to hand Atletico a place in the last eight. Atletico boss Diego Simeone sprung a huge surprise prior to kick-off by handing on-loan Villarreal midfielder Cani his full debut at the expense of captain Gabi. Mario Mandzukic was also recalled up front at the expense of Fernando Torres, but it was at the other end where the Croatian proved his worth early on as he cleared a shot from Son Heung-Min off his own line after Atletico struggled to clear a Leverkusen corner. The Korean had an even better chance moments later as the Germans counter-attacked with menace, but a poor touch allowed Miguel Angel Moya to scurry from his goal and collect the loose ball. That was to be Moya's last involvement as he limped off with an injury to be replaced by Jan Oblak. However, fortune favoured the home side 27 minutes in when Suarez's shot from Cani's cushioned header was deflected past the helpless Bernd Leno. Mandzukic then had a huge chance to put last season's beaten finalists ahead in the tie when he latched onto Arda Turan's through ball, but he was caught for pace by Wendell and the Brazilian full-back made a fine last-ditch challenge. The visitors ended the first 45 minutes the better and only a fine interception from Miranda prevented them from having a goal to show for it as he cut out Wendell's dangerous low cross with Leverkusen bodies waiting to add the final touch. Cani's Cameo ended at the break as he was replaced by Raul Garcia, but despite a positive start to the second period from Atletico, chances were had to come by for both sides. Karim Bellarabi tested Oblak from distance with an effort from distance that the Slovenian comfortably held, whilst Arda Turan volleyed over Griezmann's cross at the other end. Turan came close again 10 minutes from time when he was found by another neat pass from Griezmann, but this time his driven effort was beaten away by Leno. Torres was introduced for Mandzukic seven minutes from end of normal time, but it was Garcia who had the best chance to win the game when his fierce strike was turned behind by Leno early in the second period of extra time. However, despite a fine save from Koke in the shootout, Leno couldn't stop Atletico from progressing as Hakan Calhanoglu, Omer Toprak and Kiessling all fluffed their lines from the spot."

""Tomorrow I expect the Calderon that has pushed us to achieve great things,"" Simeone said on Monday. ""I don't want the stadium to be quiet even for a moment."" Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt, meanwhile, insisted that Atletico remain the favourites despite his side's slender advantage. ""For me the result we got three weeks ago is a positive one, but we haven't done anything yet,"" he said. ""Atletico continue to be the favourites and we'll have to give it our all tomorrow. We know that Atletico are very strong at home."" Atletico have come unstuck domestically of late, though, and go into Tuesday's game on the back of a four-game winless streak. A big part of that slump in form has been a lack of discipline with Diego Simeone's men ending three of their last five games with 10 men. Los Rojiblancos will again be without two key players through suspension against Leverkusen as Diego Godin and Tiago miss out, and Schmidt knows his young side will need to keep their head amongst the cauldron-like atmosphere in the Spanish capital. ""We know that Atletico have a very strong mentality and they fight a lot. In such a heated atmosphere we need to keep a cool head. ""I am not worried about the atmosphere, but excited by it. It is part of the big challenge that faces us. ""If we want to go through, we need to make a huge effort and we need to enjoy the pressure of the atmosphere.""

However, they have won 20 of their last 22 European games at the Vicente Calderon, including wins in all three of their group games earlier this season without conceding a goal. Another clean sheet is likely to be in order if Diego Simeone's men are to progress to the last eight with goals of their own in short supply in recent weeks. Since thrashing Real Madrid 4-0 last month, Los Rojiblancos have found the net just once in their last four games. ""In football there are moments in a season where sometimes you are more deadly in front of goal than others. Sometimes the goal comes easily and other time you have loads of good chances and it doesn't go in,"" said Simeone after Saturday's 0-0 draw away at Espanyol. ""We need to keep going, roll up our sleeves and work hard because that is the only way we know how to improve."" Simeone will also be without two of his most experienced campaigners in Diego Godin and Tiago through suspension. However, top scorer Mario Mandzukic is expected to return to the starting line-up for the first time since defeat in Leverkusen after a spat with Simeone in place of Fernando Torres. In contrast to Atletico's slump in form, Leverkusen come into the game full of confidence having won their last five games without even conceding a goal. The Germans could even have put the tie to bed at home with a series of promising counter-attacks that lacked the final finish. Captain Simon Rolfes, though, is backing his side to get the away goal that would go a long way to sealing their place in the last eight for the first time since the reached the final in 2002. ""We need to tick off the last few games and concentrate on Atletico. If we stand up for each other, then we also have a good chance in Madrid. ""We are always good for a goal away from home, but it's just as important that we don't concede one."" The first meeting between the two was a feisty affair with 10 yellow cards, a red for Tiago and a bust up between the two coaching staffs. And Leverkusen boss Roger Schmidt believes his side will need to keep a cool head in the cauldron like atmosphere in the Spanish capital. ""We need a super game, but we'll head down there with a lot of self confidence for the second-leg,"" he said. ""We're still the underdogs, but we've shown that we have a good chance.

Atletico finished with ten men at Leverkusen's BayArena. Defensive midfielder Tiago was sent off for the final quarter of an hour for a second booking while centre-back Diego Godin is also suspended for the return leg after a second-half yellow card. Simeone also has injury worries having been forced into two changes before the break when both right winger Saul Niguez and right-back Guilherme Siqueira came off injured. ""Leverkusen could have decided the match if they had scored again, so we can live with the situation and we still have a good chance at home,"" said Atletico coach Simeone. ""We have to be positive in the return leg, we had our chances, but it wasn't our night. ""They had us under a lot of pressure and made things hard for us.

""Diego and Tiago are suspended for the return leg and we have a lot of injuries, but we still have a lot of hope."" Bayer, the 2002 Champions League finalists, edge closer to breaking their last 16 jinx having failed to pass this stage of the competition in their last three previous attempts. Roger Schmidt's Leverkusen ended their three-match winless streak in the Bundesliga in style by stunning the 2014 finalists. Having been humiliated 4-0 at home by Paris Saint Germain last season at the same stage, Leverkusen produced a spirited performance. Their potent pressing game nullified the threat of Atletico striker Mario Mandzukic and attacking midfielder Antoine Griezmann, who have scored 37 goals between them this season, while replacement Fernando Torres faild to make an impact. But Schmidt admits his side still face an up-hill task at Atletico's Vicente Calderon Stadium for the return leg on March 17. ""Nothing has been decided, but I think it was important to have not conceded a goal and we managed to subdue an attack which includes Mandzukic, Greizmann and Torres,"" said Schmidt, who is in his first season in charge. ""The door is still open for Atletico, but we have shown we are also good for a goal or two. ""We have to try and score in Madrid, which will really give us a chance. ""We can definitely live with the 1-0, we still have every opportunity and we see that we have a clear chance to reach the quarter-finals. ""The team did outstandingly well. They gave little away, showed a lot of maturity so the deserved winner walked off the pitch."" Leverkusen grabbed the winner when Germany winger Karim Bellarabi's back-heeled pass found Turkey international Calhanoglu, who blasted his shot from a tight angle. ""I think we were clearly the better team and therefore we deserved the win,"" said Calhanoglu. ""I gave it all I had for the goal, but we have to play just as well in the return leg as we did today and then we have a good chance."" Bayer goalkeeper Bernd Leno was the hosts' hero after a superb diving reflex save in the first-half to deny Tiago -- which TV pundit and ex-Germany goalkeeper Oliver Kahn described as ""world-class"". ""I thought it was in, then you saw Leno's hand come from nowhere to deny him. That was world-class,"" said an impressed Kahn."

Reigning Spanish league champions Atletico played the last quarter of an hour with ten men after defensive midfielder Tiago was sent off for a second booking. Bayer, the 2002 Champions League finalists, edge closer to breaking their last 16 jinx having failed to pass this stage of the competition in their last three previous attempts. Roger Schmidt's Leverkusen ended their three-match winless streak in the Bundesliga in style by stunning the 2014 finalists. Having been humiliated 4-0 at home by Paris Saint Germain last season at the same stage in the competition, Leverkusen produced a spirited performance. Their potent pressing game nullified the threat of Atletico striker Mario Mandzukic and attacking midfielder Antoine Griezmann, who have scored 37 goals between them this season. The hosts controlled the early stages as Mandzukic found himself in the unusual position of clearing a 12th-minute shot off the line from Leverkusen centre-back Emir Spahic. The Bosnia captain then rattled the top-left corner of the goal post with a long-range strike on 26 minutes with Atletico goalkeeper Miguel Angel Moya beaten. Madrid's best chance of the first-half came when Juanfran's shot was blocked and Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno out-jumped the waiting Griezmann to deny the Frenchman an easy header right in front of goal on 39 minutes. Atletico coach Diego Simeone was forced into two changes before the break as both right winger Saul Niguez and right-back Guilherme Siqueira came off injured. Leno kept Atletico out with a superb diving reflex save to deny Tiago just before the half-time whistle. Leverkusen took the lead when Karim Bellarabi cut across the face of the goal, then his back-heeled pass found Calhanoglu, who blasted his shot past Moya from a tight angle on 57 minutes. Simeone brought on Spain's ex-Liverpool and Chelsea striker Fernando Torres for the final 25 minutes in a bid to get Atletico a crucial away goal. Having already been booked early in the first-half, Tiago's dismissal for his second yellow gave Leverkusen the numerical advantage, but Atletico kept up the pressure as Leno endured a busy final 20 minutes."
537,24/02/2015,20:47,Atletico's Simeone targets focused display,"Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone says concentration and control will be key for last season's finalists when they face Bayer Leverkusen away in Wednesday's Champions League last-16, first leg tie.","Madrid arrive in Germany in a rich-vein of form with ex-Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic having claimed 20 goals in all competitions this season and the defending champions third in La Liga. Bayer, who reached the 2002 Champions League final where they were beaten by Real Madrid, are struggling for form having leaked a late equaliser at Augsburg on Saturday in a 2-2 draw and are winless in their last three games to leave coach Roger Schmidt under pressure in his first season in charge. To make matters worse, history is against Leverkusen who have lost their last four two-legged ties against Spanish opposition. The Germans were humiliated at the hands of Barcelona in 2012, then Paris St Germain last year at the same stage of the competition and have never won a last 16 tie in the current format. But Argentinian-born Simeone says he wants to see a poised display from his team at Leverkusen's BayArena. ""It's a huge match for us. We want to keep control of the game and also keep possession of the ball,"" said the 44-year-old. ""We have to be careful. If we're in possession, Leverkusen will apply a lot of pressure to get the ball back. ""We're in very good shape and are really enthusiastic. But we have to be very focused - this is always very important for our performance. If we do that, we get a good result."" Typically for a Champions League coach, Simeone ignored Leverkusen's below-par results and insisted his side must respect the home side, that lost a 5-4 thriller to Wolfsburg ten days ago when striker Son Heung-Min scored a second-half hat-trick only to end up on the losing side. ""Leverkusen have a good coach and good players, they're a well-balanced team. It's always important to show respect to your opponents,"" he said. ""I don't know if teams give us more respect now just because we've done well in the past. ""There may be more attractive opponents than us, who you would rather face, but we're here."" Schmidt had earlier insisted Leverkusen are the under-dogs to reach the quarter-finals, but Simeone quickly rebuffed the 'favourites' tag for his team. ""I don't think we're the favourites in this tie. It starts at 0-0 so anything is possible,"" he said."
538,24/02/2015,17:38,Leverkusen aim to bounce back against Atletico,"Roger Schmidt has called on underdogs Bayer Leverkusen to brush off recent results when they host 2014 finalists Atletico Madrid in Wednesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg, clash.","Leverkusen are winless in their last three games after conceding a late equaliser in Saturday's 2-2 draw at Augsburg following back-to-back Bundesliga defeats to Werder Bremen and Wolfsburg. They face an up-hill challenge to contain Atletico's goal-scoring duo of Mario Mandzukic and Antoine Griezmann, who have 37 goals between them already this season. Defending Spanish league champions Atletico are currently third in La Liga and hammered Real 4-0 in the Madrid derby a fortnight ago. Leverkusen have never won a last-16 tie in the current format. They have been humiliated by Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain at the same stage of the competition in recent years and Schmidt is under pressure to avoid any repeat. ""No one in Spain likes to play against them, even Real Madrid,"" said Leverkusen coach Schmidt in Tuesday's press conference. ""When you play the 2014 finalists, we have to see ourselves as outsiders, but it's two games and it doesn't matter what the statistics say. ""We have to show we are able to give a team like this a few problems and showed in the group stages at home that we can make life difficult for any team. ""Atletico are a tough side, they have had an unbelievable year, but I am optimistic we will have our chances. It will be an intensive game. ""We want to show our fans from the very first minute that we have a chance."" Schmidt admits his side will have their work cut out containing the aerial prowess of ex-Bayern Munich striker Mandzukic, who has netted 20 times this season. ""Mandzukic is good in the air, so we have to defend crosses well, but we have also experienced this in the Bundesliga,"" said Schmidt. ""Atletico are good at winning the second-ball. We've dealt with this before but tomorrow night it will be at a higher level."" But Leverkusen's South Korea striker Son Heung-Min is relishing the chance to show what his side can do against last season's finalists. ""Atletico are a very good side, but we are excited to see what we can achieve in the Champions League,"" said Son, who scored a hat-trick against Wolfsburg ten days ago. ""We're all motivated to win this game. ""We just have to focus on our game and put in our best performance. We're at home, which is an advantage. ""Atletico like to counter-attack, so we have to be careful, not just think about going forward. ""We have to be cautious, but this is a chance to show what we can do."""
539,24/02/2015,02:10,Atletico duo aim to keep goals flowing in Leverkusen,"Atletico Madrid arrive at Bayer Leverkusen for Wednesday's Champions League last 16, first leg, clash hoping for a sixth straight clean-sheet in Europe, with Mario Mandzukic and Antoine Griezmann hunting more goals.","Between them the pair have already bagged 37 goals this season as the 2014 Champions League finalists look to leave Leverkusen's BayArena with an advantage in the hunt for a quarter-final place. Former Bayern Munich striker Mandzukic has already shown Pep Guardiola what he is missing in Bavaria by scoring 20 goals, while Griezmann has hit the net 17 times for Atletico this season. French midfielder Griezmann says Diego Simeone's Madrid need a good start in Leverkusen, just as they had in Saturday's 3-0 home league win over Almeria to stay third in the table. ""We need to keep working and enjoying the games like we are at the moment,"" said the Frenchman after netting in the 20th and 29th minute following Mandzukic's 13th-minute penalty. ""We need to face all the games the same way, trying to win and coming out flying from the start."" The only casualty for Madrid is midfielder Koke, who will miss the first leg with a hamstring injury having, scored two goals and provided four assists in the group stages. Olympiacos were the last team to score against Atletico when they enjoyed a 3-2 group stage win in Greece back in September. Since then, Madrid have scored 12 goals without reply in Europe, including a 5-0 thumping of Malmo and a 4-0 thrashing of Olympiacos in the return leg. Bayer have never won a last-16 tie in the competition's current format and will have to work hard to change that statistic against an Atletico side who finished top of Group A ahead of Juventus. Leverkusen are winless in their last three league matches and have had little to cheer about at this stage of the competition in recent years. They were thumped 4-0 at home by Paris St Germain last season on the way to a 6-1 aggregate defeat. That came two years after Lionel Messi ran riot when Bayer's 3-1 defeat in Leverkusen preceded a 7-1 humiliation away to Barcelona in 2012 when Messi netted five times. Leverkusen are without Australia winger Robbie Kruse, who has an ankle injury, while defensive midfielder Sven Bender and defender Tin Jedvaj are doubtful with knee and hamstring injuries respectively. Having dropped to sixth in the Bundesliga after Saturday's 2-2 draw with Augsburg, qualifying for next season's Champions League is of more pressing concern than progressing in this season's edition. ""Of course I am concerned for our European qualification for next season,"" said Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller. ""We have simply given too many points away this season. ""A few things aren't working as we'd like them to."" South Korea striker Son Heung-Min will be looking to add to his three Champions League goals in six games so far this season, having also netted a Bundesliga hat-trick in Leverkusen's 5-4 defeat to Wolfsburg ten days ago. Leverkusen will be with suspended defender Omer Toprak, who was sent off in their final group stage match at Benfica which ended in a goalless draw."
540,15/02/2015,22:57,"Messi hat-trick fires Barca, Atletico beaten by Celta",Lionel Messi marked his 300th La Liga appearance with his 31st Barcelona hat-trick as the Catalans moved within a point of Real Madrid at the top of the table with a 5-0 win over Levante.,"However, champions Atletico Madrid remain seven points off the top in third after losing 2-0 at Celta Vigo. Barca have now won 11 straight matches in all competitions and never looked in danger despite coach Luis Enrique making eight changes from the side that beat Villarreal in the Copa del Rey in midweek. Messi teed up Neymar to open the scoring early on and then took over scoring duties himself to push out his all-time La Liga tally to 269 goals. Yet, even the Argentine was upstaged by a stunning overhead kick from substitute Luis Suarez to round off the scoring. Victory tied Pep Guardiola's best ever run of consecutive wins during his hugely successful four-year spell in charge at the Camp Nou. But Enrique insisted it is winning at the season's end which matters most. ""Records are obviously positive, but they don't interest me,"" he said. ""The players aren't overly euphoric because they know how hard it is to win titles. ""If the fans are euphoric then great. We need to be optimistic, but it isn't important how many games we have won. What counts is if they help us to win trophies."" Messi, Neymar and Javier Mascherano were the only survivors from Wednesday's 3-1 Cup semi-final, first leg win over Villarreal as Enrique continued to use the vast resources of his squad. Those changes did understandably provoke a subdued start, but Barca's luck was in on 17 minutes when Neymar mishit Messi's dinked pass over the Levante defence only for the ball to spin high into the air and drop into the far corner of the net. Messi didn't need the same fortune to make it 2-0 as Marc Bartra robbed the ball deep inside the Levante half and fed his teammate to slot home his 35th goal of the season. The four-time World Player of the Year doubled his tally just before the hour mark as Sergio Busquets's lovely pass into Pedro was turned across goal by the Spanish international for Messi to tap home. Neymar was then upended inside the area by Ivan Lopez and, having handed penalty taking duties to the Brazilian when Neymar missed from the spot in midweek, Messi wasn't going to give up the opportunity for his fifth hat-trick of the season as he sent Marino the wrong way. Suarez was introduced at Neymar's expense shortly afterwards and the former Liverpool man provided his own moment of brilliance 17 minutes from time as he caught Adriano's cross flush on the volley for just his fourth La Liga goal. Atletico were a shadow of the side that thrashed Real Madrid 4-0 last weekend as a fifth league defeat of the season all but ended their title hopes. Celta dominated the opening 45 minutes without creating a clear-cut opportunity, but they were handed the chance to open the scoring in controversial circumstances from the penalty spot as the referee missed a handball by Augusto Fernandez in the build-up before Nolito was upended by Mario Suarez inside the area. Nolito stepped up to send Miguel Angel Moya the wrong way from the spot and could only look on in disbelief moments later when Joaquin Larrivey somehow failed to turn his cross into an open goal. Atletico then came alive as Sergio Alvarez saved from Saul Niguez and Antoine Griezmann, but they were caught on the break 19 minutes from time when Michael Krohn-Dehli fed Fabian Orellana to drill the ball into the far corner. Valencia needed an Alvaro Negredo penalty 19 minutes from time to see off Getafe 1-0 and move back above Sevilla into fourth. The on-loan Manchester City striker cheekily chipped home the winner from the spot after he had been brought down by Juan Rodriguez. Villarreal's chances of a top four finish were dented, however, as they were undone by second-half goals by Alberto Bueno and Gael Kakuta in a 2-0 defeat at Rayo Vallecano."
541,08/02/2015,12:35,Koke injured in Atletico's derby destruction,Atletico Madrid may be without key midfielder Koke for over a month after he suffered a torn hamstring in his side's 4-0 thrashing of Real Madrid on Saturday.,"""The player suffered a torn hamstring in the back part of his left leg,"" the defending Spanish champions said. Koke, a 23-year-old Spain international and an integral part of the Atletico midfield, is set to miss the Champions League last-16 first-leg with Bayer Leverkusen this month and possibly the league clashes against Sevilla and Valencia. ""Incredible performance from the team! And thanks for your messages! I hope to be back soon,"" he wrote on his official Twitter account. The victory pulled Atletico within four points of their capital neighbors, and level with Barcelona, who play their game in hand later on Sunday at Athletic Bilbao. Koke's loss was bittersweet as he was replaced by 20-year-old Saul Niguez, who went on to score a stunning overhead-kick and set up the third goal for Antoine Griezmann. Saul also injured himself in the process of teeing up Griezmann but scans have ruled out anything more serious than just a knock on his left knee. Defender Diego Godin also played the majority of the game with a broken nose after clashing with Sami Khedira after ten minutes. However, the club confirmed the Uruguayan won't need surgery on the injury."
542,31/01/2015,15:13,"Neymar to be enjoyed, not criticised - Luis Enrique",Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has leapt to the defence of Brazilian star Neymar after claims from Atletico Madrid players he was showboating as the Catalans knocked the Spanish champions out of the Copa del Rey in midweek.,"Neymar scored twice as Barca won 3-2 on the night at the Vicente Calderon to progress into the semi-finals 4-2 on aggregate. However, Neymar was targeted by Atletico players in an ill-tempered affair as the hosts finished the game with just nine men. Enrique admitted after the match that he had substituted Neymar in the second-half to protect him from further rough treatment. And he believes players of Neymar's ability should be afforded more protection rather than being questioned for showing their full repertoire of skills. ""Brazilians see football as a way of enjoying themselves whilst competing,"" Enrique said on Saturday. ""Spain is a strange country where people are more offended by a nutmeg than destroying someone with five fouls. ""If you take football, samba or other things away then he is no longer Brazilian. They have another way of understanding the game. He should continue to enjoy it and so should we."" Neymar's run of seven goals in his last six games has played a major role in Barca's upturn in form since losing their opening game of 2015 away at Real Sociedad. However, they face another of the form teams on Sunday night when Villarreal hope to extend their 18-game unbeaten league run at the Camp Nou. The sides will meet three times in just over a month as they also clash in the Copa del Rey semi-finals, and Enrique insisted his side have to disrupt Villarreal's passing game. ""Both of us are in good form. At home we are very strong and the support of the fans is important, but I have no doubt they will present difficulties. ""We need to press well. In the first game there we struggled and won late on. We need to be very effective in our pressing."""
543,29/01/2015,09:14,Barca edge nine-man Atletico in five-goal thriller,Neymar bagged a double as Barcelona twice came from behind to book their place in the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey with a 3-2 win over nine-man Atletico Madrid to seal a 4-2 aggregate victory.,"Fernando Torres struck for the hosts inside the first minute to cancel out Lionel Messi's winner in last week's first leg, but Neymar grabbed a vital away goal just nine minutes later. Raul Garcia briefly restored Atletico's lead from the penalty spot, but Barca were in front by half-time thanks to a Miranda own goal and a wonderful counter-attack rounded off by Neymar. Atletico captain Gabi was then sent-off during half-time as players and coaches from both sides clashed at the end of the first period. The home side should have been reduced to nine men earlier when Arda Turan somehow escaped with just a yellow card after throwing his boot at one of the officials in the second-half, but did eventually see another red card when Mario Suarez picked up a second booking late on. ""I liked the way the team reacted after conceding in a strange way in the first minute,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""Neymar showed the attitude he always does. He is a player with a lot of confidence and helps us all in all phases of the game."" Torres scored twice in the first minute of each half of the second leg as Atletico dumped city rivals Real Madrid out of the competition in the previous round and he repeated the trick after just 38 seconds. The former Chelsea striker latched onto Guilherme Siqueira's clearance and skipped past Javier Mascherano before volleying in off the far post to register his first goal at the Vicente Calderon since rejoining his boyhood club. Barca responded in fine style to that early blow, though, as a slick move sparked by Messi saw Luis Suarez release Neymar in behind the Atletico defence and he calmly slotted home for his 20th goal of the season. Atletico were given a lifeline when Juanfran was bodychecked by Mascherano and Jesus Gil Manzano pointed to the spot despite the contact appearing to take place outside the area and Garcia confidently stepped up to slam home the spot-kick. The lead again only lasted only eight minutes, though, as Miranda could only turn Messi's corner into his own net. The game then turned definitively in Barca's favour when Manzano didn't award a second penalty when Griezmann's shot hit Jordi Alba on the arm. Barca then broke upfield and Alba squared for Neymar to dance round Jan Oblak before rolling home his second goal of the evening. Tempers flared when Manzano brought an exhilarating first-half to an end with Gabi failing to return for the second period having been sent-off in the tunnel. ""I just said to the referee it was a penalty and a red card, you will see on TV that you have made a mistake,"" Gabi told Canal Plus. ""Then he told me that I was sent-off. I didn't say anything else. The team was left with an numerical disadvantage and you could see that in the second-half."" Diego Simeone's men were extremely fortunate to not then go down to nine men when Turan incredibly threw his boot at an assistant referee for failing to award the hosts a free-kick. The Turkish international was shown a yellow card by Manzano, which should also mean he will escape retrospective punishment as the incident was seen by the referee. Barca comfortably saw out the remaining 40 minutes by dominating possession and should have added to their tally when Messi shot straight at Oblak 20 minutes from time. Suarez was then dismissed four minutes from the end when Messi was upended for the umpteenth time as Atletico continued to lose their discipline. Next up for Barcelona will be a semi-final meeting with Villarreal or Getafe, who play the second leg of their quarter-final on Thursday."
544,22/01/2015,01:32,Messi hands Barca slender Cup lead over Atletico,Lionel Messi struck five minutes from time to hand Barcelona a vital 1-0 lead heading into the second leg of their Copa del Rey quarter-final with Atletico Madrid.,"Atletico looked set to round off a fine day for the club after the confirmation that Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin will spend 45 million euros ($52 million) for 20 percent of the club by holding out for a 0-0 draw. However, Juanfran was penalised for kicking Sergio Busquets inside the area late on and Messi was relieved to slot home at the second attempt after seeing his penalty saved by Jan Oblak. The two sides will meet again at the Vicente Calderon in Madrid on Wednesday, January 28. ""It's a good result, but we've got the return leg to go and that will be another intense 90 minutes,"" said Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta. ""We've put in a great shift against a team that's really difficult to overcome. ""We're happy to win 1-0. Keeping a clean sheet is very important, but it doesn't guarantee anything."" Atletico boss Diego Simeone remains confident that his side's tremendous home form can see them turn the tie on its head. ""We still have a chance against an opponent that played very well. The tie is still very open,"" he said. Fernando Torres was paired once more with Antoine Griezmann up front for Atletico after the pair combined to allow Torres to score in the opening minute of each half as they secured a 4-2 aggregate win over Real Madrid in the last 16 a week ago. However, just like in their league meeting 10 days ago, it was Barca who made a fast start this time and Atletico goalkeeper Oblak was forced into a fine save to turn Neymar's curling effort behind after just four minutes. Atletico weathered the early storm without any further scares and grew into the game. Torres saw a low shot deflect wide off Gerard Pique, whilst Guilherme Siqueira's cross from the left was just too high for Griezmann as the Frenchman's header sailed harmlessly over. Barca's best chance of the opening half arrived 10 minutes before the break when Ivan Rakitic's ball into the box landed at the feet of Luis Suarez, but he somehow blazed over with just Oblak to beat from point-blank range. Torres then failed to find Griezmann as he gifted the ball to Pique to end a promising break and that was to be the former Chelsea striker's last involvement as he was replaced at half-time by Mario Mandzukic. A similar pattern ensued after the break as Barca enjoyed plenty of possession without being able to create many clear-cut chances against the well-organised ranks of Atletico defence. Oblak was alert to a low drive by Andres Iniesta from the edge of the area, but Barca's frustrations began to bubble over as both Suarez and Javier Mascherano were booked for taking the protests towards the referee too far. However, Jose Luis Gonzalez rightly pointed to the spot when Busquets was upended by Juanfran seven minutes from time and despite a fine save by Oblak to stop Messi's penalty, the Argentine followed-up to slot home the rebound. Barca could have taken an even greater advantage to the Calderon had Miranda not got a touch to divert a Messi cross towards Neymar into Oblak's grateful arms moments later."
545,21/01/2015,16:45,Tycoon Wang's Atletico deal sparks China's football interest,Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin has become the latest foreign investor to be enticed by the riches and glamour of European football after agreeing to buy a 20 percent stake in Spanish champions Atletico Madrid.,"Wang, who is number 42 on Forbes magazine's list of the world's richest people with a fortune estimated at $18 billion, will invest a much-needed 45 million euros ($52 million) into the Atletico coffers for his share of the club. Despite great success on the field, which included a run to the Champions League final as well as a first La Liga triumph in 18 years last season, Atletico have consistently had to sell their best players to meet huge debt repayments. Los Rojiblancos' income of 120 million euros for the 2012/13 season saw them languishing in 20th in Deloitte' Money League of the world's richest clubs, and was just over a fifth of that enjoyed by Real Madrid and Barcelona, the two richest clubs on the planet. Wang is a known to be a diehard football fan and his Wanda Group greatly increased its profile in China after Wang bought a Dalian football club in 1994, renamed it after the firm, and transformed it into the strongest team in China. However, he sold Dalian Wanda in 2000 when he was said to have become disillusioned with widespread corruption in the Chinese game at that time. Wang's investment follows a pattern of La Liga's top sides following the lead of other European clubs looking east for resources in a time of economic crisis at home. Six-time Spanish champions Valencia were recently acquired by Singaporean businessman Peter Lim. Real and Barca remain beyond the reach of wealthy investors due to their fan-owned membership model. However, both have lucrative shirt sponsorship deals with middle-eastern airline companies Emirates and Qatar Airways. Wang's, though, is the first serious move from the Chinese market into European football and appears to be looking for more of a return closer to home than investments from the oil-rich Middle East made in English champions Manchester City and French giants Paris Saint-Germain. As part of the agreement Atletico will be responsible for drafting a plan specifically focused on the growth of Chinese grassroots football overseas. ""This investment will not only provide a golden opportunity for young Chinese players sent overseas by Wanda to be selected by leading European football clubs, it will also strengthen the quality of Chinese football and narrow the gap between the rest of the world,"" Wanda Group said in statement. Despite a remarkable rise to the forefront of the Olympics medals tables in recent times, China remains a backwater on the football pitch. The world's most populous country has only ever been to one World Cup in 2002 when they lost all three games in their home continent in South Korea and Japan. However, a revolution is already in the offing. China have won all three group games in progressing to the quarter-finals of the Asian Cup, where they will meet hosts Australia on Thursday. In the short-term, Wang's money will help Atletico remain competitive at home with the powerhouses of Real and Barca, but it could also be pivotal in helping China finally make the grade on the pitch at a global level in years to come."
546,21/01/2015,10:48,China tycoon Wang scores latest goal with Atletico Madrid,Chinese multi-billionaire Wang Jianlin's purchase of a 20 percent stake in Spain's reigning football champions Atletico Madrid is the latest in a series of overseas acquisitions by one of the world's richest football fans.,"Wang's sprawling Wanda Group has previously bought up US cinema chain AMC and British-based yachtbuilder Sunseeker, along with another Madrid landmark, the Edificio Espana skyscraper. He made his fortune in property. But with China's real estate sector facing headwinds he has been looking to diversify, turning to culture and tourism as the firm's new growth drivers and expanding into film production, theme parks, print media and art investment. And while Wang's 45 million euro ($52 million) Spanish acquisition may represent the first mainland Chinese investment in a top European football club, he is no stranger to the sport. The 60-year-old is a diehard football fan and Wanda Group greatly increased its profile in China after Wang bought a Dalian football club in 1994, renamed it after the firm, and transformed it into the strongest team in China. But Wang sold Dalian Wanda in 2000. He was said to have become disillusioned with widespread corruption in the Chinese game at that time. Wang topped the Forbes China Rich List in 2013 with an estimated net worth of $14.1 billion. He was displaced last year by charismatic Internet entrepreneur Jack Ma, although his wealth will have been boosted by the flotation of a Wanda subsidiary in Hong Kong last month. Wang himself owns more than 98 percent of Wanda Group, with the remaining sliver held by his only son, Wang Sicong. ""Our goal is to make Wanda a brand like Walmart or IBM or Google -- a brand known by everyone in the world, a brand from China,"" he told CNN last year. Wang is the eldest son of a captain in the Chinese Communist army during the civil war and Second World War and is himself a veteran of the People's Liberation Army. He runs Wanda Group ""with military rigour and precision"", Fortune magazine reported. Wanda executives claim the company has ""never once had a project come in late or over budget"", the magazine said. He is unmistakably close to Beijing, holding multiple official titles including delegate to the ruling Communist Party congress in 2007. Wang, who has penchants for karaoke and collecting, has an impressive selection of fine art, and can also count global A-listers Nicole Kidman, Leonardo DiCaprio and Catherine Zeta-Jones among his acquaintances. They flew in for a red-carpet event to showcase Wanda's plan for an $8.0 billion studio complex in the eastern city of Qingdao."

It will provide ""all-round support for the development of Chinese football"", the statement said, adding that both sides will spend 30 million euros on a youth training centre in Madrid to foster young talent, including players from China. Wang is number 42 on Forbes magazine's list of the world's richest people, with a fortune estimated at $18 billion, and was named as China's second-wealthiest man last year. The flotation of one of his firm's subsidiaries may have since propelled him into first place. He is a diehard football fan and Wanda became a household name across China after Wang bought a Dalian football club in 1994, renamed it after the firm and transformed it into the strongest team in China. But Wang sold Dalian Wanda in 2000 after he became disillusioned with widespread corruption in the Chinese game at that time. More recently Wanda has been looking to diversify away from the real estate sector -- which is facing considerable challenges in China -- by investing in an ever-expanding portfolio of companies including cinema chain AMC and yacht builder Sunseeker. Atletico, last year's La Liga champions, have racked up debts in recent years despite their success on the field. Chairman Enrique Cerezo agreed the deal with Wang in Beijing, state-run news agency Xinhua said. Xinhua said Wanda Group is currently funding a youth training project which sent 90 young Chinese footballers to Spain, with the number expected to reach 180 by 2017. ""What we are doing is to raise the level of Chinese game,"" Wang was cited by the news agency as saying. ""Hopefully, three to five among those 90 young players will play for top European clubs in the future and in five years, Spain-trained players will fill the Chinese team in the Asian Cup,"" he added, referring to the continental championship, which is currently being played in Australia. The two sides will collaborate on setting up three football schools in China, the Wanda statement said, and Atletico may tour China later this year."

Rodriguez, who missed out on selection for the 2010 World Cup finals after being banned for four matches although he did appear at last year's edition, enjoyed a more successful time at Porto where he was a member of three title-winning sides and the 2011 Europa League trophy. Parma will require all the 80-times capped 2011 Copa America winner's combativeness as they are presently bottom of the Serie A table after 19 matches, nine points adrift of safety."

Madrid sports daily AS said Wang planned to pay 40 million euros ($46 million) for the stake. The club declined to confirm the reports to AFP. Various media reported that Cerezo and Wang were expected to sign the deal on Wednesday. Reports said the deal would also involve opening Atletico Madrid football schools in China, sponsorship deals and a possible tour by the club to China later this year. Wang is number 42 on Forbes magazine's list of the richest men in the world, with a fortune estimated at $18 billion. Last year he paid 265 million euros to buy the Edificio Espana, an iconic skyscraper in central Madrid, from Santander bank."
550,18/01/2015,13:58,Ronaldo double takes Madrid four points clear,Cristiano Ronaldo rounded off a week where he was named world player of the year for the third time scoring a double as Real Madrid opened up a four-point lead at the top of La Liga with a 3-0 win away to Getafe on Sunday.,"The visitors had to wait 63 minutes to make the breakthrough before he fired home Karim Benzema's pass to set them on the road to victory. Gareth Bale then doubled the visitors' lead before Ronaldo rounded off the scoring with a trademark header from James Rodriguez's cross. Barcelona can cut Madrid's lead back to a solitary point when they travel to Deportivo la Coruna later on Sunday. Perhaps suffering from the after effects of their Copa del Rey elimination to Atletico Madrid in midweek Madrid started sluggishly, but were rarely threatened by a goal-shy Getafe. The European champions finally started to get going after 20 minutes as Marcelo drove a fierce effort just over on his weaker right foot before Benzema was denied by Jordi Codina. Isco then tested the Getafe 'keeper with a piledriver from the edge of the box which Codina did well to turn over and Toni Kroos came even closer a minute before the break when he rattled the crossbar from long range. Codina continued to frustrate Madrid at the start of the second period with good saves from Benzema and James Rodriguez. However, his resistence was finally broken just before the hour mark with a brilliant team goal as Isco and Rodriguez combined to free Benzema and the Frenchman produced an exquisite piece of skill on the byline to cut the ball back for Ronaldo to slam home. Just four minutes later it was 2-0 as this time Rodriguez was the provider with a fine low cross that Bale prodded past Codina with the outside of his left foot. The winning margin could even have been greater for Ancelotti's men as Ronaldo outfoxed Codina with a free-kick that whistled inches past the post with the 'keeper beaten. Ronaldo wasn't to be denied his second of the afternoon 11 minutes from time, though, as another sumptuous cross from Rodriguez allowed the Portuguese to plant a firm header past the helpless Codina to register his 36th goal of the season. Getafe failed to force Iker Casillas into a single save, but did come within inches of a consolation goal when Alvaro Vazquez fired against the post from Alex Felip's low cross late on."
551,16/01/2015,02:03,Torres proving the doubters wrong - Simeone,Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone claimed Fernando Torres's double to take the La Liga champions into the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey at Real Madrid's expense had proved the former Chelsea striker's critics wrong.,"Torres scored in the first minute of each half to ruin Cristiano Ronaldo's Ballon d'Or celebrations as the Cup holders were dumped out 4-2 on aggregate after a 2-2 draw at the Santiago Bernabeu. ""When he came out of the academy he was a boy, too young for everything that happened then but he still responded well,"" said Simeone. ""He went away, grew up and now is a man. I am very happy for him. In games like this he responds as he did. ""The fans are happy and his arrival has helped us, despite some people's doubts."" Torres was only handed a start due to an illness suffered by Mario Mandzukic in the day before the game, but his inclusion proved to be inspired as he slotted home from Antoine Griezmann's cross after just 46 seconds. Sergio Ramos levelled before the break, but Griezmann and Torres combined once more at the start of the second period before Ronaldo salvaged a draw on the night for Carlo Ancelotti's men. Simeone admitted such an early blow helped to sap the home side's energy, but refused to accept Atletico now have the Indian sign over their neighbours after going five derbies unbeaten so far this season. ""Such an early goal changed the rhythm of the game. It wasn't in the plan."" ""Every time we face Madrid we face an extremely strong team. They are the best team in the world, they just won the Club World Cup and the Champions League."" Despite scoring his first two goals at the Bernabeu, Torres refused to hail his performance as his best in an Atletico shirt and reserved special mention for the part played by Griezmann in setting up both goals. ""To play at the Bernabeu is difficult. As soon as they equalised they could see a chance to go through, but the second goal allowed us closer to the finish line. ""We want to keep advancing in all competitions. We need to enjoy this moment because we are happy. ""It was a great game, but it is not my happiest day in Atletico shirt. I finished well today but it is thanks to Griezmann."" Ancelotti lamented his side's slow start to both halves, but believes elimination at such an early stage of the competition could help their defence of the Champions League. ""The key to the game was the two errors we committed at the start of each half, but we can't forget other parts of the game like how we played in the first hour, which for me was spectacular. ""Now we have three weeks to prepare well for the Champions League and this is very good for the team."" And Ronaldo agreed with his coach that the rest accumulated in the coming weeks should help them to finish the campaign strongly. ""We can't take away the value of the Cup, but the league and the Champions League are more important. ""We always want to win, but we have to look at the positives. This will allow us to concentrate on other competitions. ""At times it is better to take one step back to then take two forward."""

553,14/01/2015,18:38,Mandzukic a doubt for Madrid derby,"Atletico Madrid striker Mario Mandzukic is doubtful for his side's Copa del Rey last 16, second leg away to holders Real Madrid on Thursday due to a fever.","The Croatian did not train with his team-mates on Wednesday as the Spanish champions finalised their preparations to defend a 2-0 first leg lead. ""Mandzukic couldn't train because of a fever, so we will wait until tomorrow before taking a decision,"" Atletico boss Diego Simeone said on Wednesday. The absence of Atletico's top scorer this season could open the door for Fernando Torres to make his second start since returning to his boyhood club earlier this month. Torres has failed to impress in his two outings since returning to Spain, against Real Madrid and Barcelona in the past week, but Simeone remains confident his former team-mate will come good. ""Before he was a boy and now he is a man, he has gained a lot of football experience,"" he said. ""When the team needs him he will give us his strength and his goals."""
554,12/01/2015,19:19,Loew rewarded for World Cup win as coach of year,Joachim Loew's feat in guiding Germany to the 2014 World Cup trophy earned him the coach of the year award at the FIFA Ballon D'Or ceremony in Zurich on Monday.,"The 54-year-old beat Carlo Ancelotti -- who coached Real Madrid to their 10th Champions League title -- and Atletico Madrid's Argentinian handler Diego Simeone, who took them to the Spanish title and to the Champions League final. Loew, who moved up from assistant coach to the top job after the 2006 World Cup which Germany hosted and reached the semi-finals, said that the award rounded off a sensational year. ""It is for me a huge honour, it is the icing on the cake and the cake was winning the World Cup,"" said Loew. Loew, who also guided Germany to the Euro 2008 final where they lost to Spain, said that Germany's win in Brazil was no accident but had been the fruits of long hard labour. ""Winning the World Cup was the consequence of many years hard work and lots of right decisions."" Loew, who was an industrious midfielder in his playing days and turned out four times for the then West Germany, paid tribute to his players who secured the trophy with a 1-0 win over Argentina, a goal in extra-time by Mario Goetze proving the difference. ""I was lucky to have a superb team too who were always there for me and always put the ideas into practice,"" said Loew. It was a gift to be able to work with such a group of players."""
555,12/01/2015,00:14,Barca star trio down Atletico to ease crisis talk,"Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez were all on target as Barcelona eased talk of a club crisis with a 3-1 win over La Liga champions Atletico Madrid on Sunday.","Messi shrugged off speculation surrounding his future at the Camp Nou to cross for Neymar to scramble home the opener and then tee up Suarez to register just his second La Liga goal. The Argentine also handed Atletico a route back into the game, though, when he was adjudged to have brought down Jesus Gamez inside the area on the hour mark and Mario Mandzukic slammed home from the penalty spot. However, Messi made amends by sealing the three points when he slotted home from close range three minutes from time to move Barca back to within a point of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. Atletico are now four points adrift of Real, who also have a game in hand over both their title rivals. Barcelona had failed to beat Atletico in six meetings last season and wouldn't have been looking forward to facing Simeone's men after an unsettling week at the Camp Nou. A 1-0 defeat to Real Sociedad last weekend was followed by sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta's sacking and the club's under fire president Josep Maria Bartomeu calling club elections for the end of the season. Meanwhile, reports suggested defeat could have cost Barca boss Luis Enrique his job with relations between him and Messi at breaking point after the Argentine missed training on Monday. And Enrique acknowledged that he will only silence his critics by continuing to put a winning team out on the field. ""Victories are the only thing that can calm the situation,"" he said. ""I need to transmit the best idea of how to play football to my players and be as competitive as possible. If we are capable of winning titles or not will be the judge of my era."" Atletico boss Diego Simeone, meanwhile, lamented his side's slow start. ""I think there were two games. In the first-half Barca were better, dynamic and intense. We played badly in the first-half,"" said the Argentine. ""In the second-half we were competitive. It was much closer to what we normally are in the second. We scored and could have got an equaliser, but in the end the third goal finishes the game."" In the end Messi did his talking on the pitch as Barca's star-studded South American frontline guided them to victory. Barca went in front on 12 minutes when the four-time World Player of the Year danced past Gamez and pulled the ball across goal. Suarez failed to make a proper contact, but Neymar was on hand to sweep home his 17th goal of the season. Atletico 'keeper Miguel Angel Moya then kept his side in the game with a fine double save to firstly parry Jordi Alba's fierce drive and then block Suarez's effort on the rebound. The visitors were on the ropes in the first 45 minutes and teenage centre-back Jose Maria Gimenez was lucky to escape unpunished when he flew in dangerously on Neymar to leave the Brazilian with a bloodied ankle. Neymar missed a guilt-edged chance to double Barca's advantage midway through the half when he headed wide with the goal at his mercy after brilliant play by Messi and Suarez. However, when the second goal did come, Atletico had a right to feel hard done by as Messi appeared to use his hand to speed past Gamez before sliding the ball through for Suarez to slot home. Referee Alberto Undiano Mallenco balanced up that perceived injustice on the hour mark, though, as he pointed to the spot when Gamez went down under a challenge from Messi. It was the first time that Messi had ever conceded a spot-kick in La Liga and Mandzukic didn't pardon him as he slammed high into the roof of the net. Fernando Torres was introduced by Simeone as Atletico searched for an equaliser and he was only denied a ninth goal in 12 games against Barca by Claudio Bravo's quick-thinking as the Chilean 'keeper rushed from his line to intercept Mandzukic's dangerous low cross. But in a week where he has dominated the headlines, Messi rounded off his fine performance with a first goal against Atletico in eight games when he pounced on a loose ball inside the area to side-foot home."
556,08/01/2015,01:35,"No crisis, but Ancelotti concerned by passive Real",Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti believed his side lacked penetration as they left themselves with a mountain to climb if they are to progress to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey after a 2-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid.,"Ancelotti's men have now suffered back-to-back defeats after a run of 22 consecutive wins to end 2014 and three of their five losses this season have come at the hands of the Spanish champions. Both sides meet again for the second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu on January 15. ""I think to call it a crisis is a bit exaggerated,"" said the Italian. ""We controlled the game well until the penalty and then we didn't play well in the final part of the game. ""We needed a bit more efficiency in the final pass in the first-half. We played a lot of square balls, but Atletico also defended well. They always defend together and compact so it is difficult to find a solution."" Ancelotti had left Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench, but otherwise named a strong side including Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez and Karim Benzema. The World Player of the Year was summoned after Raul Garcia had put Atletico in front from the penalty spot just before the hour mark, but made little impact as the hosts went onto double their lead through Jose Gimenez's powerful header 13 minutes from time. ""Ronaldo was a bit tired, so it was a risk to play him for the full 90 minutes,"" Ancelotti explained. ""We have a chance. It is clear that Atletico have the advantage, but at home anything can happen. The odds aren't in our favour but we will try our best."" Fernando Torres's return to Atletico ensured there was a buoyant atmosphere at the Vicente Calderon throughout. And he was delighted to register his first win over Real as an Atletico player despite a far from perfect performance on his part which saw him replaced after an hour. ""I am happy for many reasons,"" said the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker. ""For the result, the atmosphere we experienced, the fans, for everything."" ""The result gives us a great chance, but 2-0 is never definitive at the Bernabeu. There 90 minutes can seem like a very long time."" Atletico boss Diego Simeone insisted Torres will improve with more time to adjust to his new teammates and the Argentine reserved special praise for the fringe members of his squad after making seven changes from the side that beat Levante at the weekend. ""Fernando transmits excitement and energy to the fans. He is fast, strong, but he needs time to bed into our style of play. ""To compete with other teams you have to compete inside the squad. Thanks to the work of the coaches those who don't always play are always alert and ready. ""To compete in the competitions you have to use the whole group. It doesn't matter if it is a friendly, the Champions League, Copa del Rey or La Liga we will try to compete."""
557,06/01/2015,15:19,Torres eyes dream homecoming in Madrid derby,"Fernando Torres was responsable for the second highest attendance of the season at the Vicente Calderon on Sunday despite the fact there was no match to see as 45,000 Atletico Madrid supporters welcomed 'El Nino' home.","Torres will be free to make his second debut for his boyhood club, for whom he scored 82 goals in over 200 appearances between 2001 and 2007, against their closest and bitterest rivals when Real Madrid come to the Calderon for the first leg of their Copa del Rey last 16 tie on Wednesday. ""I'm back at home after seven long years. I'd been waiting a long time for this to come true and now my feelings are a bit strange. I still don't believe this is real"", Torres told the club's website. However, the 30-year-old is well aware of the hard work that lies ahead of him if the real reality check is not to be for the thousands that attended his presentation on Sunday still in awe of the baby faced assassin they saw leave for England during tougher times for the club. As Torres has struggled for form and fitness in recent years at Chelsea and earlier this season in an ill-fated loan spell at AC Milan, Atletico have soared under his former teammate Diego Simeone. Since the Argentine took charge three years ago, Atletico have only lost three out of 18 two-legged ties on route to winning the Europa League, the Spanish Supercup and the Copa del Rey. However, one of those defeats came to Real in comprehensive fashion in last season's Cup semi-final as Los Blancos ran out 5-0 winners on aggregate. ""The club has been able to build a team in which the word team is a strength and that has led to successes,"" added Torres. ""For my part, I have found a path which has given me great satisfaction, but something seemed to be missing. ""This reunion closes a circle that started when I was just 10 years old wearing this shirt and now I hope to enjoy it. ""I will always give my all and more for this shirt because it's what I feel. The fans know it is going to be like that."" Real boss Carlo Ancelotti acknowledged the lift that Torres's arrival has given Atletico. ""Without playing Torres has brought enthusiasm to the fans and received their love,"" said the Italian, who managed Torres for five months at Chelsea. ""Torres has quality, experience and in this atmosphere, which is his, he will be motivated and desperate to do well."" The European champions also have reason to be motivated after their 22-game winning run was snapped by defeat at Valencia on Sunday and Ancelotti admitted he is likely to make changes at the Calderon. ""We are focused on a match that will be difficult. We will continue with the same fight and desire as we have done until now. ""There could be changes. There are some players that haven't recovered yet, but we will play our strongest team available."" Ancelotti confirmed that Keylor Navas will start all of his side's Cup games in goal ahead of Iker Casillas and that Gareth Bale will retain his place in the side despite criticism of his performance at Mestalla."
558,04/01/2015,15:12,Torres keen for titles after hero's welcome,"Fernando Torres has targeted trophies to add to the love of the Atletico Madrid faithful after he was presented in front of 45,000 fans at the Vicente Calderon on Sunday.","Torres was forced to watch from the stands as Atletico beat Levante 3-1 on Saturday as his move from AC Milan cannot be officially completed until the Italian transfer window opens on Monday. However, El Nino, who captained Atletico before leaving for Liverpool in 2007, is set to make his second debut for the club against arch rivals Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. ""Off the pitch I have been through many things. On a personal level I am more mature and very happy to be here,"" he said. ""On the sporting level things have changed too. At 24 I realised something very hard, that I needed to leave so that the club and I could grow. ""It was the most difficult moment of my career. The club has grown and time has proved us right. I have also won trophies, but I want to win trophies here."" Ironically as Atletico's status has soared in recent years following the appointment of Torres's old teammate Diego Simeone as coach, the Spanish international has suffered a long-term slump. The 30-year-old failed to live up to his price tag as the most expensive signing in British football history when he swapped Liverpool for Chelsea in 2011 for £50 million ($77 million) despite adding the Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup to the two European Championships and World Cup he won with Spain. An unhappy four-month loan spell at Milan followed in which Torres scored just once in 10 appearances for the Italian giants. Yet, he is still fondly remembered at the Calderon where he scored 82 goals in 214 appearances during his previous spell, including leading his boyhood club back to the top flight in 2002. And Torres admitted that a return home was the boost he needed to re-energise his career. ""I needed something that would excite me and I could only find that here,"" he added. ""You can see the response of the fans on a day like today. ""There are many people waiting who love Atletico Madrid. The fans have never been a problem for the team. They know that they win more points than any other team in Spain. ""I am sure that on Wednesday we will have an incredible derby."""
559,03/01/2015,17:58,Griezmann double keeps Atletico on Real's shoulders,La Liga champions Atletico Madrid remained in the race to retain their title with a comfortable 3-1 win over Levante on Saturday thanks to two goals from Antoine Griezmann.,"With Fernando Torres watching on from the stands before his move back to his boyhood club is concluded on Monday, Griezmann was under pressure to continue his fine form after scoring a hat-trick as Atletico closed 2014 with a 4-1 win away to Athletic Bilbao two weeks ago. And he duly obliged with two headed finishes from close range early in each half before Diego Godin nodded in Atletico's third after Nabil El Zhar's deflected effort had given Levante hope. Atletico are now level with Barcelona in second place and one point behind leaders Real Madrid, with the latter two sides in action against Real Sociedad and Valencia respectively on Sunday. Torres was the star attraction before kick-off as he took his seat in the directors' box to much acclaim. However, on the field, Griezmann ensured Los Rojiblancos' former captain will find it hard to get into the side for the visit of Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. The French international had a goalbound shot blocked by Loukas Vyntra and Mario Mandzukic headed just wide as the hosts began brightly. Diego Simeone's men were finally rewarded on 18 minutes when Guilherme Siqueira's cross from the left looped into Griezmann's path and he nodded past the helpless Diego Marino. Atletico should have extended their lead before half-time as Arda Turan fired just over, Mandzukic saw a goal ruled out for handball and Marino then made a fine save to deny the Croatian from point-blank range. Yet, they looked to have made the game safe just 60 seconds into the second period as despite more heroics from Marino to claw a Mandzukic header off the line, he couldn't react in time to prevent Griezmann's follow-up effort crossing the line. The unlucky Mandzukic saw another header drift wide and Tiago's deflected shot flew into the side-netting as Atletico continued to dominate. However, they were stunned just after the hour mark when Levante halved the deficit. Mandzukic was again heavily involved again as he did brilliantly to turn Victor Casadesus's header off his own line, but the ball fell to Ivan Lopez and his drive clipped El Zhar on its way into the far corner. Simeone then withdrew Turan and Mandzukic with one eye to Wednesday's repeat of last seasons' Champions League final against Real. And, not for the first time this season, the Argentine's side needed to rely on their threat from set-pieces to seal the three points eight minutes from time when Godin headed home Tiago's in-swinging cross."
560,29/12/2014,11:45,Torres completes loan return to Atletico,Former Liverpool and Chelsea striker Fernando Torres completed his return to boyhood club Atletico Madrid after his new owners AC Milan agreed a loan deal with the Spanish champions on Monday.,"Torres agreed a permanent transfer with the San Siro club from Chelsea on December 27 but was swiftly loaned back to the club where he built his reputation on a deal set to run until the end of the 2015-16 season. The Madrid giants, who lost last year's Champions League final against arch rivals Real Madrid, confirmed the 30-year-old's return to the Vicente Calderon on their website. ""Fernando Torres returns to Atletico Madrid after an agreement reached by our club with Milan for the international striker to play on loan for the remainder of the season and one more,"" read an official club statement. ""The player will have a medical on January 5. He returns home, where he trained as a player and became one of our biggest stars."" Torres shot to stardom at his childhood club when he was made captain at just 17 in 2001 and went on to score 91 goals in 244 appearances for Atletico. ""I was not a Liverpool fan or a Chelsea fan in Madrid,"" he once said. ""I was an Atletico fan. I still am. Maybe they're the only badge I will kiss."" After his rise in Madrid, he was then snapped up by Premier League club Liverpool where he spent four successful seasons before a high profile 50 million pounds (63.8 million euros/$77.9m) transfer to Chelsea where he struggled badly to reach his previous heights. Torres scored some memorable goals for the Stamford Bridge outfit, notably in the 2012 Champions League semi-final win over Barcelona and the 2013 Europa League final when the Blues edged Benfica 2-1 in the final minute. He also won the FA Cup as well as the Champions League but came in for constant scrutiny over his scoring rate of 45 total goals, 20 in the Premier League, in 172 matches. The Spanish international, who also won the 2010 World Cup and 2008 and 2012 European championships, also found his place in the national team called into question. He has scored just one goal for AC Milan this season."
561,27/12/2014,20:42,Chelsea confirm Torres Milan move,"Spain striker Fernando Torres will join AC Milan permanently from Chelsea in the New Year, the English Premier League leaders said Saturday.","The news came several hours after Spanish media reports claimed the former Liverpool forward would be returning to his first club Atletico Madrid. The 30-year-old had joined Milan on a two-year loan at the beginning of this season. He won the Champions League, the Europa League and the FA Cup in three-and-a-half years at Stamford Bridge, but never lived up to goal-scoring expectations after a £50 million (64m euros, $78m) transfer from Liverpool. Torres will join Milan permanently on January 5, Chelsea said. The deal does not rule out a return to Atletico in the upcoming transfer window, though. The Spanish champions have indicated they do not have the funds for a permanent deal themselves, but may yet sign him on another loan deal from Milan once he has left Chelsea. In fact, Sports newspapers such as Marca and AS and national daily El Pais had said earlier that Torres's move back to Atletico was decided after the Madrid club's Italian player Alessio Cerci agreed to move to Milan in return. A return home could be what Torres needs to reignite a once sparkling career. The World Cup winner and double European champion scored 46 goals in 172 Chelsea appearances, but only 20 of those came in 110 league outings -- a poor return when compared with the 65 Premier League goals he scored in 102 appearances for Liverpool. Torres moved to Stamford Bridge late on January transfer deadline day in 2011 for a then record British fee. Initial struggles appeared to be a crisis of confidence, as he managed just one goal in 18 appearances before the end of the season. The following season he scored 11 goals, including a hat-trick against QPR and a vital breakaway goal against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final, but still looked a shadow of his former self. His best season in a Chelsea shirt came in the following campaign as he scored 22 goals across seven competitions, including the winner in the Europa League final against Benfica. He managed only 11 goals the following season, after which Jose Mourinho broke up his misfiring striking trio of Torres, Samuel Eto'o and Demba Ba, all of whom left the club. Since his move to Milan he has scored just one goal in 10 appearances."
562,27/12/2014,19:19,Torres set for Atletico return - reports,"Spain's former Chelsea and Liverpool striker Fernando Torres is set to return to La Liga champions Atletico Madrid, local media reported on Saturday.","The 30-year-old will make the switch from AC Milan, where he is on loan from Chelsea, back to his boyhood club seven years after he departed, newspapers reported. The clubs had yet to officially announce the move. Sports newspapers such as Marca and AS and general ones such as El Pais said Torres's move back to Atletico was decided after the Madrid club's Italian player Alessio Cerci agreed to move to Milan in return."

But Griezmann levelled straight from the kick-off at the start of the second period and completed his hat-trick after Raul Garcia had put the visitors ahead from the penalty spot. Victory moves Atletico back to within three points of Barcelona, who were 5-0 winners over Cordoba on Saturday, in second. However, Real have a game in hand on their two main title rivals as they won their fourth trophy of the year in the Club World Cup final against Argentine side San Lorenzo in Morocco on Saturday. ""This was my best match since I've been here. I need to keep on this path and keep working,"" Griezmann said. At the new San Mames both sides were missing a number of key players with Aymeric Laporte and Ander Iturraspe banned for the hosts, while Atletico were without the suspended duo of Koke and Mario Mandzukic, as well as Miranda through injury. It was the Basque outfit who settled much quicker, and went ahead after 17 minutes when Markel Susaeta's free-kick was expertly nodded into the far corner by the unmarked Rico. Atletico failed to create anything of note in the opening 45 minutes, and could have been even further behind at the break had Aritz Aduriz decided to shoot when he was released clear on goal by Susaeta rather than trying to turn inside before being crowded out. However, the champions emerged a different side after an inspired half-time pep talk from Diego Simeone and equalised straight from the kick-off as former Real Sociedad winger Griezmann came back to haunt his old Basque rivals once more with a precise header from Juanfran's cross. Seven minutes later Atletico completed the comeback in controversial circumstances as the referee pointed to the spot when Tiago hit the floor under minimal contact between he and Mikel San Jose inside the area. Once the protests from the home fans and players had finally subsided, Garcia kept his cool to send Gorka Iraizoz the wrong way from the spot. If Ernesto Valverde's men felt hard done by at the penalty decision, they were handed a reprieve 22 minutes from time when Iker Muniain was extremely fortunate to escape with just a yellow card after a reckless studs high challenge into the knee of defender Jose Gimenez. That decision wasn't to prove too contentious, though, as Atletico wrapped up the points five minutes later when Griezmann pounced on a slip by Carlos Gurpegi to calmly stroke the ball past Iraizoz. The Frenchman sealed his first Atletico hat-trick nine minutes from the end thanks to more generous officiating as he tapped into an empty net despite clearly being in an offside position after the ball ricocheted off Garcia. Elsewhere, Villarreal and Malaga remained in the hunt for the top four with victories over Deportivo la Coruna and Elche respectively. It was a more comfortable afternoon for Villarreal at home to Depor as they recorded a seventh straight win in all competitions 3-0 thanks to Jonathan dos Santos's first goal for the club and two second-half strikes by the in-form Luciano Vietto. Malaga, meanwhile, had to come from behind to record a third consecutive league win after falling behind to David Lomban's header on the verge of half-time. However, second-half goals from Ignacio Camacho and on-loan Liverpool midfielder Luis Alberto mean they join Villarreal and Sevilla on 30 points, just one off Valencia in fourth."
564,14/12/2014,22:26,Villarreal end Atletico's 28-match unbeaten home run,Spanish champions Atletico Madrid suffered their first home league defeat in 28 matches as Luciano Vietto blasted home the winner six minutes from time to hand Villarreal a 1-0 win at the Vicente Calderon on Sunday.,"An uncharacteristically error-strewn performance from Diego Simeone's men was deservedly punished by the visitors, who could have been out of sight before the goal but for two fine saves by Miguel Angel Moya. Defeat leaves Atletico now seven points adrift of leaders Real Madrid and still three off second-placed Barcelona, who were the last team to beat Atletico on home soil in La Liga back in May 2013, whilst Villarreal move up to sixth. The result also rounded off a perfect weekend for Real Madrid as they extended their lead at the top to four points after sealing their 20th consecutive win in all competitions 4-1 over Almeria on Friday, whilst Barcelona stumbled to a 0-0 draw at Getafe 24 hours later. ""I can only talk about the match because I was concentrated on the play,"" said Simeone, who gave Vietto his professional debut during his stint in charge of Racing Club in Argentina. ""It was an even match in terms of chances and the side that was more efficient was always going to have more chance to win. ""They won the game with a goal by Vietto and I am happy for him despite the fact we had gone more than a year without losing here."" Villarreal boss Marcelino, meanwhile, believed his side deserved the win after running Real Madrid, Barcelona and Sevilla close this season. ""This group deserved a victory like this,"" he said. ""We have been very close in other games against the big sides where we have played well but not won."" Atletico were playing for the first time at the Calderon since a Deportivo La Coruna fan was killed in clashes near the stadium ahead of a meeting between the two sides a fortnight ago. The club had promised to crackdown on their unruly ultras, but the unusually flat atmosphere in front of a half-empty stadium seemed to affect the Spanish champions in a first-half littered with errors. Villarreal had the best chance of the opening half when Denis Cheryshev burst clear but opted to go for goal himself rather than square to the unmarked Vietto and Moya made a comfortable save. Mario Mandzukic had a wonderful chance to continue his fine goalscoring form when he latched onto Diego Godin's knockdown after the break, but former Atletico 'keeper Asenjo bravely blocked the Croatian's effort from point black range. Moments later Mandzukic was denied by referee Pedro Jesus Perez Montero as he harshly ruled out the former Bayern Munich man's headed finish for a push on Mario Gaspar. In their push for a winner, though, Atletico were leaving themselves exposed on the counter and were only pardoned by a poor touch from Vietto when he was this time released clean through on goal by Cheryshev. The Argentine's mis-control allowed Moya to get a vital touch before Diego Godin completed the clearance. Atletico were thankful to another fine stop from Moya to prevent Cheryshev opening the scoring with a piledriver from a narrow angle. Yet, there was nothing he could do to prevent Vietto inflicting a first league defeat at home in 19 months when he turned Godin and fired high into the net six minutes from time. Earlier, Sevilla's hopes of securing a return to the Champions League next season suffered a blow as they were held 0-0 at home by a resilient Eibar at the Sanchez Pizjuan. A point means Sevilla remain in fourth, but are now only two points in front of Valencia, whilst Eibar move up to ninth."
565,13/12/2014,16:41,Atletico complete signing of Argentine Correa,Atletico Madrid on Saturday announced that they have completed the signing of young Argentine midfielder Angel Correa after his transfer was postponed in the summer because of a heart problem.,"Correa, 19, underwent successful surgery in New York after the illness was detected during a medical with Atletico in May and has now secured his transfer from Copa Libertadores winners San Lorenzo. Reigning Spanish champions Atletico, who are third in La Liga ahead of Sunday's home meeting with Villarreal, confirmed that Argentina under-20 international Correa has signed ""for the remainder of this season and the following four campaigns."" Correa, who helped San Lorenzo win the Argentine title last year, is therefore tied to Atletico until 2019."
566,08/12/2014,19:37,Simeone readying for Juve's Group A 'final',"Diego Simeone believes a fired-up Juventus will play ""like it's a final"" when the Turin giants host his Atletico Madrid side on Tuesday looking to clinch their place in the last 16 of the Champions League.","Atletico, beaten 4-1 in last year's final by city rivals Real Madrid, have already booked their ticket for the knockout phase after winning four Group A fixtures on the trot following a shock opening-day loss to Olympiakos. Although a draw would see Juventus qualify in second place, coach Massimiliano Allegri insists the Italian champions are aiming for a win with a two-goal margin that would clinch top spot. Simeone is not taking Juve lightly and says the Spanish champions will have to be focused from kick-off. ""We'll be up against a team that is desperate to get a result. They're going to be fired up, really determined, so we have to be prepared for that right from the start,"" Simeone told media at Juventus Stadium on Monday. ""Last season they didn't qualify for the last 16 and they don't want a repeat. They're going to be playing like it's a final."" In the sides' October 1 fixture at the Vicente Calderon stadium, Arda Turan's 75th minute strike secured a 1-0 win for Atletico on what was the first competitive fixture between the Spanish and Italian champions. Since then, however, Juventus have made significant progress, ditching the 3-5-2 formation, once favoured by former coach Antonio Conte and used initially by Allegri, in favour of a more progressive 4-3-1-2. Juventus, who have won their past two outings at home to Olympiakos and away to Malmo, trail Atletico by three points with the Greek side a further three points adrift in third place. Midfield maestro Andrea Pirlo was still recovering from an early season injury when Juventus lost 1-0 in Spain in October. Now on top form, underlined by his stunning last-minute goal that clinched victory in the city derby against Torino two weeks ago, Simeone highlighted the ageing Italy star as a significant threat. ""The first thing you have to say about Pirlo is he's a fantastic player. His ability to read the game quickly is a huge asset, we have to pay close attention to him,"" added Simeone. One of the players likely to cross Pirlo's path is Koke, but the 22-year-old embraced the prospect of facing a formidable midfield that also includes Paul Pogba and Claudio Marchisio. ""They have a strong midfield, we saw that at the Calderon even when they were without Pirlo,"" said Koke. ""It will be a tough match-up tomorrow evening. But we're not going out to play for a draw. We always play to win."""
567,08/12/2014,02:10,Juve confident of Atletico win and top spot,Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci insists the Italian champions can pull off a Champions League shock and snatch first place in Group A from Atletico Madrid on their way to qualifying for the last 16 on Tuesday.,"The Turin giants host the reigning Spanish champions requiring just a draw to claim their place in the knockout phase of the competition for the first time since 2012 when they were knocked out in the quarter-finals by Bayern Munich. But Bonucci has echoed coach Massimiliano Allegri's demands by calling for Juve to win with the two-goal cushion that would secure top spot. ""We're a team that has been designed to attack, not to contain. On Tuesday we'll be going out to win and to finish top of the group,"" said Bonucci after Friday's scoreless draw away to Fiorentina. Bonucci has had to adapt in recent weeks as Allegri has leaned towards a more attack-minded 4-3-1-2 formation. In Juve's last Champions League outing away to Malmo the 47-year-old Italian adopted the latter, with a crucial 2-0 win the result of his decision to move the Italians away from the 3-5-2 instilled by former coach Antonio Conte. Allegri adopted a 3-5-2 for Friday's trip to Fiorentina where, a year after a 4-2 defeat at the Artemio Franchi stadium, Juve had expected another tough game from Vincenzo Montella's men. Allegri is expected to return to a four-man defence for Tuesday. ""When we play with three at the back, we manage to read the game better, but even in a four-man defence I've shown I can play to the highest level,"" said Bonucci. Whether that will be enough to contain an Atletico side that has won their past five games, scoring 15 and conceding just once in the process, remains to be seen. Diego Simeone's visitors have a three-point lead on Juventus and are already qualified for the last 16, but midfielder Raul Garcia says the Spanish champions won't be taking the game lightly. Garcia told Tuttojuve.com: ""We're going through a really good period, we've won our last five games, scored 15 goals and conceded one. ""We're working really well and want to keep that good run going. Against Juve we we'll play with our usual objective and that means we're going to Turin to win."" While a draw for Juve would see them qualify in second place, an Atletico victory as well as an Olympiakos win at home to Malmo would end Juve's run in the competition. Olympiakos, who sit three points behind in third, would secure second spot because of their better head-to-head record having scored twice in a 3-2 defeat in Turin. Juventus lost 1-0 in Athens. Juve's determination to claim all three points against Atletico was clear from Allegri's team selection on Friday. He left Carlos Tevez, Claudio Marchisio and Alvaro Morata on the bench with only Tevez (61) and Marchisio (79) making late appearanecs. After a poor start to their group campaign, Juve's recent revival has only strengthened belief they can beat Atletico. French teenager Kingsley Coman, who partnered Fernando Llorente up front in Florence, told Juventus tv: ""It will be a great game, and an open one at that. We can't aim for the draw, we have to try and attack and grab first spot by winning the match. ""We struggled a bit at the start of the competition. We dropped the odd important point, but in our last two games we've been more efficient, as we also hope to be against Atletico."""
568,26/11/2014,23:54,Mandzukic treble helps Atletico into knock-out rounds,Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic blasted a hat-trick as last year's beaten finalists Atletico Madrid booked their place in the knock-out rounds of the Champions League with a 4-0 win over Olympiakos on Wednesday.,"Juventus are in pole position to join the Spanish champions in qualifying from Group A after goals from Spaniard Fernando Llorente and Argentina's Carlos Tevez gave them a 2-0 win at Malmo, who are eliminated. Atletico coach Diego Simeone warned his players against getting complacent ahead of the final match ""We know it will still be very difficult,"" he said. ""No one would have thought we would be in this position (after losing their first game) and thanks to the effort of the players we have won four games in a row and can win the group."" Olympiakos can still qualify in second place but must beat Malmo at home in two weeks time and hope Juve lose to Atletico in Italy. Raul Garcia opened the scoring for Atletico before Mandzukic took over but the Spaniards still need a draw against Juve in Turin in two weeks -- or a defeat by no more than one goal -- to finish top of Group A. Arsenal, who had lost their two previous matches in the league to Swansea and Manchester United, were another side to secure a last 16 berth as Yaya Sanogo scored his first goal for the club. His strike, just two minutes in, followed by a second-half goal from Alexis Sanchez, helped the north Londoners to a 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund at the Emirates, although the Germans still lead Group D by two points. ""We are a team that likes to go forward but sometimes we dominate the game and we maybe forget to take precautions to defend. We did that better tonight,"" said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. Two goals from Chancel Mbemba gave Anderlecht their first win of the group stage with a 2-0 success against Galatasaray that secured them the consolation place in the Europa League. Title-holders Real Madrid continued their perfect record in this season's competition as Cristiano Ronaldo netted in a 1-0 Group B win at Basel. That goal, set up by Karim Benzema, took Ronaldo level with former Real star Raul on 71 Champions League goals, second only to Lionel Messi, whose hat-trick on Tuesday took him on to 74 goals. The result gave a boost to Liverpool's chances of qualifying for the last 16 despite the English side being pegged back by a late Georgi Terziev leveller in a 2-2 draw at Bulgarians Ludogorets. Liverpool and Ludogorets trail Basel by two points in the race for second place but the English side know they must win at Anfield in two weeks time to ensure they progress, or else Basel's name will go into the draw for the last 16. ""We are disappointed with the goal we conceded in the end but it is irrelevant, we need to beat Basel in the final game,"" said Liverpool manager Brendan Rogers, who was nonetheless happy with the result. ""This is a real confidence boost for us, because Ludogorets are a really difficult team to play against."" Ludogorets are out as they cannot finish above either Liverpool and Basel, even in the unlikely event they were to win at the Bernabeu in their last match. Liverpool suffered a torrid evening as Dani Abalo gave the Bulgarians a third-minute lead. Rickie Lambert's first Champions League goal followed by a strike from Jordan Henderson, teed up by Raheem Sterling, put the visitors in the driving seat by half-time, but they couldn't hold out. Bayer Leverkusen added their name to the last 16 qualifiers despite being beaten 1-0 at home to Monaco in Group C. Lucas Ocampos scored the only goal of the game in Germany 18 minutes from time from close range after being teed up by Nabil Dirar. It means the French side need only avoid defeat at home to Zenit St Petersburg in two weeks to join Leverkusen in the knock-out stages. Zenit beat Benfica 1-0 in Russia -- the result that secured Leverkusen's qualification -- thanks to a goal from Portuguese winger Danny. Leverkusen can ensure top spot in Group C by winning away to Benfica, who are already out, in two weeks, while Zenit must beat Monaco to progress."
569,26/11/2014,22:52,Mandzukic hat-trick eases Atletico into last 16,Spanish champions Atletico Madrid secured their place in the last 16 of the Champions League with 4-0 over Olympiakos on Tuesday thanks to a hat-trick from Mario Mandzukic.,"A fast start by last season's beaten finalists was rewarded when Raul Garcia prodded home at the near post after an awful attempted clearance from ex-Atletico goalkeeper Roberto. Mandzukic had suffered a broken nose when Olympiakos beat Atletico 3-2 on matchday one, but the Croatian had a far more enjoyable evening this time round and opened his account with a tap in after Alberto Botia failed to cut out Cristian Ansaldi's low cross. And he completed his hat-trick with two powerful headed finishes in three minutes just after the hour mark. Victory for Juventus away to Malmo means Atletico just need to avoid defeat by two or more goals when they travel to Turin in two weeks' time in order to top the group. Olympiakos, meanwhile, now need a big favour from Atletico if they are to progress as they need to beat Malmo at home next time out and hope Diego Simeone's men win in Italy. The visitors hadn't played a competitive game in 17 days as the Greek league was suspended following the recent international break due to a violent attack on a senior official of the country's referee board. And they looked decidedly rusty as Atletico opened them up time and again down the Spaniards' right in the opening stages. The first of many forays forward by right-back Juanfran caused panic in the Olympiakos area after just two minutes but neither Garcia or Mandzukic could bundle the ball home. Mandzukic was then just inches from connecting with another low cross from Juanfran to the near post. However, Olympiakos failed to learn their lesson as the opener arrived in similar circumstances as Roberto fired an attempted clearance straight at Juanfran's feet and this time his cross was converted at the near post by Garcia. Roberto redeemed himself somewhat by getting down low to his left to turn Ansaldi's fierce drive behind and Tiago should have down better when he fired well over from a well-worked free-kick. A lack of pace cost Mandzukic moments later when he was played in behind the Olympiakos defence before being crowded out by a bunch of recovering defenders. However, he was presented his first goal of the evening when Botia swiped at fresh air from Ansaldi's low cross and the Croatian slotted home at the far post. The former Bayern Munich striker was first to threaten after half-time as well as his goalbound effort was deflected behind by Alejandro Dominguez. Mandzukic was perfectly placed again to make it 3-0 just after the hour mark when he powered a header into the bottom corner from Arda Turan's inviting cross. Moments later he sealed his first hat-trick in Atletico colours with another header from Gabi's free-kick that had too much power for Roberto. Mandzukic was then withdrawn to a hero's ovation from the Vicente Calderon crowd as Antoine Griezmann entered the fray. And the Frenchman thought he had added a fifth goal when he headed home at the far post from Koke's corner, but referee Wolfgang Stark ruled it out for a foul on Roberto, much to the dismay of the home fans."
570,25/11/2014,02:30,Atletico eye last 16 berth against Olympiakos,Greek champions Olympiakos face a tough task if they are to prevent last season's beaten finalists Atletico Madrid sealing their passage into the last 16 of the Champions League at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday.,"Olympiakos haven't played a competitive game since thrashing Panthrakikos 5-1 on November 9 as the Greek league was suspended last weekend following a violent attack on a senior official of the country's referee board. Michel's men have a realistic chance of reaching the last 16 for a second consecutive year as they are tied with Juventus on six points in second place in Group A, three behind Atletico with two games to play. Olympiakos shocked Diego Simeone's men with a 3-2 win at the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium in September, but the Spanish champions have reeled off three straight victories without even conceding a goal since to put themselves in pole position to progress. The root of that revival was back-to-back victories over Juventus and Malmo in Madrid before they rode their luck in winning 2-0 in Sweden last time out. Indeed, Atletico have won seven and drawn one of their eight home Champions League games since returning to the competition for the first time in four years last season and stretched their unbeaten home run in the league to 26 games with a 3-1 win over Malaga on Saturday. ""We know that we had three games at home coming up and now we have won the first one against Malaga, which is important because it was a difficult game,"" defender Diego Godin said on Monday. ""We are going well in the league, we are where we want to be and now we have a final on Wednesday in our stadium and with our fans behind us. ""It is important to take advantage of our strength at home, but just because we are playing at home doesn't mean we will definitely win. We need to keep fighting."" Godin will be partnered in central defence once more by young compatriot Jose Gimenez as Miranda remains sidelined with a thigh injury picked up whilst on international duty with Brazil. However, he is the only absentee from Simeone's squad as Mario Mandzukic has shrugged off the shoulder injury that forced him off against Malaga, whilst Guilherme Siqueira and Mario Suarez return after being suspended at the weekend. Olympiakos will bring two familiar faces with them to the Spanish capital in the form of coach Michel, who faced Atletico 25 times during a 12-year playing career with Real Madrid, and goalkeeper Roberto, who began his career with the Los Rojiblancos. Yet, despite failing to get a prolonged run in the team during two spells at the Calderon, Roberto insists revenge will not be at the forefront of his mind on Wednesday. ""I spent nine years there and they made me what I am. It is a place where I grew, learned the values of football, about the position of a goalkeeper and the profession,"" he said. ""On a personal level victory would mean a lot, but it wouldn't be revenge because it is a club that I have in my heart."""
571,02/10/2014,03:30,"Juventus as good as Barca, Real Madrid - Simeone",Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone believes Italian champions Juventus are as good as Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid despite his side inflciting Juve's first defeat of the season in a 1-0 win on Wednesday.,"""For me they are at the level of Madrid or Barcelona,"" said the Argentine. ""Watching the videos over and over, they are one of the hardest teams I have seen to attack or cause damage against. ""They have two magnificent strikers, full-backs or wingers that attack and defend, brilliant players in midfield and an enormous goalkeeper that everyone knows."" Simeone's men have made a habit of upsetting Barca and Real in recent seasons as they broke their 10-year long dominance of La Liga by winning the Spanish league title last season. Arda Turan's stike 15 minutes from time was enough to add Juventus to their list of big-name scalps and breathe new life into Atletico's Champions League campaign after a surprise 3-2 defeat to Olympiakos on matchday one. Malmo's 2-0 victory over the Greeks leaves all four sides in Group A on three points after two games, but Simeone insisted that Juventus remain the team to beat. ""I wouldn't say we have recovered from the defeat (against Olympiakos), with four teams on three points it all starts over, but it could be that Juventus will be the strongest team in the group."" For Juventus there was yet more disappointment on the road in the Champions League after their shock elimination at the groyp stages in last season's competition. The Old Lady of Italian football has now lost four of its last five away games in Europe's premier club compeition and captian Gianluigi Buffon admitted that is a record they must improve on. ""Now all we can do is look at the games we have at home, but we have to improve when we are playing away."" Buffon had hinted in his pre-match press conference that Juventus would have been happy to come away from the Vicente Calderon with a point. And he recognised that a more daring approach may also be required if they are to progress to the later stages of the competition after failing to even egister a shot on target. ""Atletico are an elite team in European football and it could be that influenced our thinking. ""In any case, to mature as a team on the international level we need to risk more in looking for the victory."" Turan's goal ended Buffon's five-match run without conceding to start the season as Juventus had made a 100 percent start to the new campaign under new boss Massimiliano Allegri. In a game of very few clear-cut chances, the Turkish international stole in ahead of Stephan Lichsteiner to convert Juanfran's cross and Allegri rued his side's lack of killer instinct at both ends of the field. ""They took advantage of their only chance. We go away with a defeat after playing very well, but it is clear we have paid dearly for that one error,"" he said. ""In the first-half we didn't have very many chances, but in the second we had three or four clear ones on counter-attacks where we failed with the last pass."""
572,01/10/2014,22:48,Turan strike hands Atletico vital win over Juventus,Atletico Madrid got their Champions League campaign back on track as Arda Turan's goal 15 minutes form time was enough for a 1-0 win over Juventus on Wednesday.,"Chances had been hard to come by in a physical contest between the Spanish and Italian champions, but Turan's cool finish to end Juventus' run of over 500 minutes without conceding this season sealed a vital three points for Diego Simeone's men. Malmo's 2-0 victory over Olympiakos means all four sides in Group A are tied on three points with four matches to play. Last season's beaten finalists Atletico came into the game desperate for the points having been surprisingly beaten away to Olympiakos on matchday one. However, Simeone's decision to opt for the more defensively minded Saul Niguez ahead of 30 million euro summer signing Antoine Griezmann was a hint of the cagey encounter to come as chances were few and far between. Indeed the most noteworthy moment of the opening half was Atletico striker Mario Mandzukic tearing off the mask he had been wearing to protect a broken nose after receiving an elbow in the face form Leonardo Bonucci, for which the Italian defender was booked. Mandzukic also had the only effort on target of the first period as his low effort was comfortably beaten to safety by Gianluigi Buffon. Juventus were enjoying over 60 percent of possession, but the closest they came to breaking the deadlock before the break came from a Paul Pogba shot from outside the box that curled just past the post. Simeone introduced Griezmann for Saul eight minutes into the second-half and was rewarded with Atletico's best spell of the match. The home fans cries for penalty were turned away by German referee Felix Brych just before the hour mark despite the ball clearly striking the arm of Martin Caceres from Raul Garcia's cross before Buffon scrambled it clear. Juventus had seemed to have weathered that spell as the game became disjointed with both sides giving away possession far too cheaply. However, with 15 minutes remaining Turan sneaked in ahead of Stephan Lichsteiner at the back post to turn home Juanfran's cross. The goal forced the visitors onto the front foot and they very nearly got an equaliser via an unlikely source as Atletico captain Raul Garcia was grateful to see his attempted clearance form Lichsteiner's cross fly just past his own goal.

Atletico are in desperate need of the points at the Vicente Calderon after losing their opening game in the group 3-2 to Olympiakos two weeks ago.

""For us it is a final. We will prepare for it like the big match it is, we need three points and in front of our fans we will do everything possible to get the win,"" said Godin. The Uruguayan was the last man to beat Juve goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon as his header eliminated Italy from the World Cup at the group stages. Since then Buffon and the Juventus defence have kept five clean sheets in making a 100 percent start to the season in all competitions. ""It is clear that Juventus are showing the defensive solidity they have had for a few years now. ""We will have to defend well and attack well to score goals. They have had a great squad for a number of years, but this year they have started especially well."" Atletico boss Diego Simeone confirmed that La Liga regular Miguel Angel Moya will continue in goal after Jan Oblak endured a tough debut against Olympiakos. However, Atletico captain Gabi remains a major doubt as he sat out training on Tuesday after suffering an ankle injury in the 4-0 win over Sevilla at the weekend. ""I have a lot of respect and admiration for what Juventus have achieved over the last few years,"" said Simeone. ""They are always a very competitive team. They have great players in attack and defence and don't make many errors. We will need to play at a very high level."""
576,30/09/2014,02:15,Atletico desperate for win in Juventus clash,Last season's Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid are in desperate need of three points to kick-start their European campaign when Italian champions Juventus visit the Spanish capital on Wednesday.,"La Liga champions Atletico were surprisingly beaten 3-2 in their first group match away to Olympiakos a fortnight ago, conceding as many goals as they did in the whole of the group stage last season in the process. However, Diego Simeone's men appear to have rediscovered their defensive solidity in the past week with back-to-back wins and clean sheets, including an impressive 4-0 thrashing of the previously unbeaten Sevilla at the weekend. Simeone's return to the touchline after a six-game ban in all competitions appeared to galvanise the team and supporters alike, and the Argentine has called on the fans to recreate the atmosphere for the visit of Juventus. ""The atmosphere is what we need in all the games at the Calderon,"" he said. ""There was a perfect communion between what the team offered and what the fans experience in the stadium. It felt like there was a mountain of us on the pitch."" Despite Atletico's Champions League struggles in Greece, they have managed to beat Real Madrid twice already this season in the league and Spanish Super Cup. And Simeone believes those games should give his side heart that they can take down Massimiliano Allegri's side, who have won all six of their games so far this season. ""There is a difference when you are competing across a whole season compared to the situation in one game. ""When we play against Madrid, Barcelona or Juventus it is clear we have a chance because it is just one game."" Atletico were also aided by the return of striker Mario Mandzukic against Sevilla as the Croatian played with a mask protecting a broken nose he suffered just 11 days previously against Olympiakos. However, Los Rojiblancos may have to do without influential captain Gabi as he limped off at half-time at the weekend with an ankle injury. Juventus' bid to make up for the disappointment of bowing out at the group stages last season got off to a good start on matchday one as two goals from Carlos Tevez gave them a 2-0 home win over Malmo. Italian international Claudio Marchisio believes the match against the Swedish champions was an encouraging sign and is hoping to take a huge step towards winning the group in Madrid. ""We haven't been able to make the step up in Europe over the last three years. We started well in our first game at home, where in previous seasons we missed important opportunities,"" he told the club's website. ""Now we've got a tricky game in Madrid. We need to also try and pick up a result there because we'd gain a lot of confidence from beating a great team like Atletico. ""Opening up a six-point gap on them would represent a big step forward towards qualification, even though the result in Athens showed us there are no easy games in this group and that Olympiakos are also capable of giving us a run for our money."" Juve will once again be without Andrea Pirlo as he is yet to feature this season due to a thigh injury."
577,26/09/2014,09:21,Rampant Ronaldo not in need of rest,World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo has insisted he has no intentions of slowing down after firing 12 goals in his first eight appearances this season.,"Ronaldo followed up his hat-trick in a 8-2 rout of Deportivo la Coruna last weekend by scoring four times in a match for the third time in his Madrid career as the European champions continued their return to form with a 5-1 thrashing of Elche in midweek. Real also received a boost as Barcelona dropped points for the first time this season against Malaga to cut their lead over Madrid to just four points. And with a tricky trip away to Villarreal this weekend on the horizon, Ronaldo says he will not be resting as coach Carlo Ancelotti rotates his squad. ""We are at the start of the season and I want to play to gain confidence and rhythm,"" said Ronaldo. ""When the right games come I will rest and rotate, but now isn't the right moment. I want to be continue to be better."" Ronaldo's goalscoring record so far this season is all the more remarkable as he took a three-week break at the beginning of the campaign to ease knee and hamstring injuries. Ancelotti said in midweek that break had been key to his sensational return to form, but, worryingly for Real's rivals, Ronaldo believes he can still improve physically after suffering from tendonitis in his left knee towards the end of last season. ""I feel good and without any pain. I am still improving and I have a little way to go so I want to continue like this. ""I can still be better physically. I trained really hard during the break after not having a good pre-season, but now I feel confident and without pain."" Ancelotti also confirmed after the win over Elche that Karim Benzema and Luka Modric would return to the side for the trip to El Madrigal with Isco and Asier Illarramendi set to drop to the bench. However, the Italian's biggest decision is who to play in goal after handing a debut to Keylor Navas in midweek after starting captain Iker Casillas for Real's first eight games of the season. Barcelona appear to have an easier task on paper as they return home to the Camp Nou to face Granada after back-to-back away fixtures. Luis Enrique's men stretched their run of clean sheets to six games this season in a turgid 0-0 draw at Malaga, but failed to manage a single shot on target during the 90 minutes. Enrique is likely to make a number of changes ahead of Tuesday's trip to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League and Lionel Messi could even be rested as the Argentine is the only Barca player to have started every game so far this season. Barcelona were knocked off the top of table on Thursday on goals scored after Valencia defeated Cordoba 3-0. The game of the weekend comes at the Vicente Calderon as champions Atletico Madrid host Sevilla who are third on 13 points, the same as Valencia ans Barcelona. Atletico got back to winning ways in midweek with a hard-fought 1-0 win away to Almeria, but needed their sixth goal out of seven they have scored in the league so far this season from a set-piece to do so as centre-back Miranda headed home his third goal of the season. Sevilla are likely to prove an even tougher test, though, as they moved onto 13 points after five games thanks to their fourth consecutive victory at home to Real Sociedad in midweek.

578,16/09/2014,23:07,Mitroglou on target as Olympiakos surprise Atletico,Kostas Mitroglou banished memories of his ill-fated move to English side Fulham with a fine goal on Tuesday to help Olympiakos to a thrilling 3-2 victory over last season's beaten Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid.,"The 26-year-old, who earned a multi-million pound move to Fulham in January on the back of a steady stream of goals for the Greek champions only to return to Greece on loan this summer, rounded off an impressive showing by the hosts in their opening Group A game against the Spanish champions. Atletico began their European campaign in defeat, having gone all the way to last season's final without losing a single match before their final defeat to city rivals Real in Lisbon. Jan Oblak hadn't played since his 16 million-euro ($20.7m) move from Benfica in the close season and the 21-year-old Slovenian goalkeeper had a nightmare debut as he conceded two goals in the first 31 minutes. First the Atletico defence allowed the Greek side far too much space and Ibrahim Afellay teed up 20-year-old French defender Arthur Masuaku, the former Valenciennes man sending a superb shot past Oblak in the 13th minute. Atletico dominated for the next 20 minutes and went close on several occasions, including from two headers by Mario Mandzukic, who received a bleeding nose in an aerial challenge earlier in the half, and one from Raul Garcia. However, it was the hosts who scored just after the half-hour mark as a wonderful dummy by Mitroglou completely confused the Atletico defence and former Barcelona winger Afellay was on hand to tuck the ball home. The visitors, though, hit back in the 38th minute as Mandzukic beat former French international defender Eric Abidal to a cross and headed past Roberto, the hosts' former Atletico goalkeeper. The second half was also an open affair with Roberto making a good save from Cristian Ansaldi and Mitroglou should have done better when found unmarked by the impressive 33-year-old Argentinian Chori Dominguez. Atletico decided another striker was required to partner Mandzukic up front and took off skipper Gabi, sending on French international Antoine Griezmann with just over half an hour remaining. However, the Greek side had the bit between their teeth and deservedly added another with 16 minutes to the final whistle with a goal created and scored by former Fulham players as Pajtim Kasami did superbly well to set up Mitroglou and he provided an equally fine finish. Atletico kept on plugging away and Griezmann set up a frenetic final four minutes as he converted Koke's cross."
579,13/09/2014,23:25,Ancelotti failing to find Real's missing balance,Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti insisted that his star-laden side needs to find a balance between attack and defence as they were again humbled by local rivals Atletico Madrid 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.,"Atletico have yet to be beaten by Real in three meetings already this campaign after suffering a heartbreaking Champions League final defeat to Los Blancos back in May as they also won the Spanish Super Cup last month 2-1 on aggregate. A second consecutive La Liga defeat for Real leaves Ancelotti's men six points adrift of Barcelona and four behind Atletico after just three games of the new league season. And the Italian was at a loss to explain how his side petered out in the second period after a promising opening 45 minutes, just as they did in losing 4-2 to Real Sociedad a fortnight ago. ""The first-half was good like at Anoeta and the second-half wasn't,"" said Ancelotti. ""We played with intensity and aggression in the first-half which is what you have to do to beat Atletico, but we didn't do that in the second-half."" Real's deficiencies from set-pieces were once again laid bare after just 10 minutes as Tiago headed home Koke's corner. However, the hosts responded through Cristiano Ronaldo's equaliser from the penalty spot and were only denied a half-time lead by some superb goalkeeping from Miguel Angel Moya. It was a different story after the break, though, as Atletico grew into the game after the introduction of Arda Turan and Antoine Griezmann and won it 13 minutes from time when Turan swept the ball into the far corner from the edge of the box. ""I think the mistake for the first goal cost us the game because we used so much energy to level we paid for it in the second-half,"" added Ancelotti. However, he insisted it is not his favoured 4-3-3 system that was to blame for the defeat. ""We don't have a problem with this system. We know the system very well, we had a problem with intensity in the second-half today in the way we had a problem with attitude at Anoeta. ""I have a lot of experience. This isn't the problem. As I have said many times, too many times, we need a balance with quality players."" Atletico boss Diego Simeone, meanwhile, said his side's victory was a massive morale boast for a squad that has been overhauled after their La Liga winning campaign last season. ""I think it is the first time we have won twice in a row in the league at the Bernabeu and that is very important for our fans and a new group of players,"" said Simeone, who watched the game from the stands as he continues to serve an eight-game touchline ban. ""We still have difficulties ahead to have the consistency we want, but with the work rate they showed and the play they showed in the second-half I am happy."" Despite his side once again proving they can beat the biggest sides in the world even on the road, though, Simeone insisted the victory hadn't changed his opinion that another title challenge will be beyond Atletico. ""The greatest thing about football is that it always gives you a chance and I think we have taken advantage of that, but today's result doesn't change the discourse. ""There were 10 or 11 players that left, but we have a nucleus that is the strength of our group and hopefully the new players will continue to grow. ""The strength of our game remains our work ethic."""
580,13/09/2014,22:08,Derby delight for Atletico over Real,Atletico Madrid gained some measure of revenge for their heartbreaking Champions League final defeat to Real Madrid by beating the European champions 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.,"A second consecutive La Liga defeat for Real leaves them already six points adrift of leaders Barcelona after just three games as they were 2-0 winners over Athletic Bilbao earlier in the day thanks to a double from Neymar. Atletico got off to the best possible start as Tiago headed home Koke's corner, but Real were soon level as Cristiano Ronaldo won and then converted a penalty midway through the first-half. However, with suspended coach Diego Simeone watching on from the stands, Atletico grabbed all three points 13 minutes from time when Arda Turan swept home Juanfran's low cross. Ronaldo was playing after a three-week layoff due to injury, but even his return couldn't cure Madrid's weakness at set-pieces which was exposed in their 4-2 defeat to Real Sociedad last time out. Atletico went in front with the first clear opening for either side as Koke's in-swinging corner was met with a bullet header from Tiago at the near post. The conceding of the goal led to large swathes of the Bernabeu booing Real captain Iker Casillas when he touched the ball. However, the hosts responded well to going behind and after Miguel Angel Moya had produced a stunning save to claw away a Gareth Bale free-kick, Ronaldo levelled from the penalty spot after he had been felled by Guilherme Siqueira. Karim Benzema then had a great chance to put Real in front after a neat one-two with Ronaldo but his first touch let him down and Moya flew out from his goal to smother. And Moya denied the Frenchman once more with a great low save after Benzema had powered a Ronaldo cross towards goal just before the break. Real's momentum towards the end of the first-half petered out after the restart, though, as Atletico began to take control after the introduction of substitutes Turan and Antoine Griezmann. Turan was inches away from restoring Atletico's lead when he cut inside Alvaro Arbeloa and curled the ball just wide 15 minutes from time. The Turkish international made amends just two minutes later though as he swept the ball into the far corner at the end of a lovely move involving Griezmann, Juanfran and Raul Garcia. Atletico now trail Barcelona by two points after the Catalans made it three wins from three under new boss Luis Enrique as Neymar came off the bench to score twice in a 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao at the Camp Nou. The Brazilian had been left out of the starting line-up after his exertions in captaining his country for the first time in wins over Colombia and Ecuador in the past week, but made the difference in a tight contest when he slotted home from Lionel Messi's pass 11 minutes from time. And the two combined once more five minutes later as this time Messi breezed past three Athletic defenders before cutting the ball back for Neymar to side-foot home. ""Messi is the best in the world. He is a star and I am improving with him,"" Neymar told Canal Plus. ""I am very happy with the game today. It went perfectly with the two goals. ""We knew we would suffer a little bit, but we managed to remain tight at the back and then went onto win the game."" Enrique was also quick to laud the impact made by Messi in creating both goals, as he also did for Sandro's winner at Villarreal two weeks ago. ""It is evident that he is best in the world in any attacking aspect,"" he said. ""This version of Messi helps us a lot because he is a game changer. He does things in training that you can't imagine, things I haven't even seen on the Playstation."" Neymar's entrance gave Barca the extra touch of class they needed to breakdown the Basques, who had defended doggedly to keep Messi and company at bay for most of the afternoon. Aymeric Laporte's wayward pass was picked off by Sergio Busquets and he fed Messi before the Argentine freed Neymar in behind the Athletic defence to roll home his first goal of the season. Messi played the role of provider once more six minutes from the end as he floated down the right wing and pulled the ball back for the unmarked Neymar to slot home."
581,02/09/2014,00:56,Southampton secure Alderweireld loan deal,"Southampton have signed Belgian international defender Toby Alderweireld from Spanish champions Atletico Madrid on a season-long loan, the Premier League club revealed on Monday.","The 25-year-old, who can play at right-back and centre-back, won La Liga with Atletico last season and played in their Champions League final defeat by Real Madrid. He has won 37 international caps and was a member of the Belgium team that reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Brazil. ""I am delighted that we have been able to bring Toby to the club,"" said Southampton manager Ronald Koeman. ""He is a strong defender and is also very good at building up the play when we play out from the back. ""He played in the top league in Spain and against top teams in Europe, so he has a lot of confidence and experience, and he has a big future because he is still young."" Alderweireld began his professional career at Dutch giants Ajax and spent nine years at the Amsterdam club, winning three Eredivisie titles and one Dutch Cup. He told the Southampton website: ""I'm very happy to be here. ""I think this is an upcoming club. Southampton put a lot of effort in to get me, so now I want to give something back to the club by doing my best to help the team. I want to give everything for Southampton."" After finishing eighth in the Premier League last season, Southampton lost manager Mauricio Pochettino to Tottenham Hotspur and saw key players Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren and Calum Chambers leave. But they have also brought in several new players, with Alderweireld following Dusan Tadic, Graziano Pelle, Fraser Forster, and Shane Long to St Mary's."
582,31/08/2014,21:33,Atletico seal deal for Torino's Cerci,"La Liga champions Atletico Madrid have reached an agreement with Torino for the signing of Italian international Alessio Cerci, the Spanish club announced on Sunday.","The 27-year-old becomes Atletico's 10th signing of the summer as they look to bolster their squad following the departures of Diego Costa, Filipe Luis and Thibaut Courtois to Chelsea. ""The agreement reached with Torino for the transfer of Cerci is great news for everyone,"" Atletico sporting director Jose Luis Perez Caminero told the club's website. ""He was a clear objective to finalise strengthening our squad ahead of the important challenges we have this season. ""We have had to make a significant effort after all the moves we have made this summer, but we are convinced it is worth it because he is going to be a key part of our team."" Cerci scored 13 goals and provided 12 assists as Torino finished seventh in Serie A last season to qualify for the Europa League. He was also included in Cesare Prandelli's World Cup squad, but made just one appearance off the bench in Brazil as Italy lost 1-0 to Costa Rica."
583,24/08/2014,02:15,Atletico capable of another title challenge,"Just days after claiming his side couldn't challenge Spanish football's elite for another season, Diego Simeone's words were shot down by another stellar performance and trophy for his Atletico Madrid side on Friday.","Atletico ended the 10-year hegemony of Real Madrid and Barcelona atop La Liga last season with a stunning run to the title and were within 90 seconds of sealing their best ever season with a first ever Champions League triumph. In the end they were denied by old foes Real as Sergio Ramos equalised in stoppage time in Lisbon before Los Blancos stormed to a 4-1 victory after extra time. However, rather than suffering a hangover from that defeat and the loss of three key players in Thibaut Courtois, Filipe Luis and Diego Costa to Chelsea, they healed some of those scars with a first home victory over Real in 15 years to win the Spanish Super Cup on Friday. Simeone's discourse remains unchanged. His reasoning that with both Madrid and Barca having spent well over 100 million euros ($133 million) each, their depth of quality will count over 38 games. ""Over one or two games we all have a chance. In a league of 38 games, the same Barca, having a bad season according to all the experts, nearly ended up champions,"" he said after winning his fifth trophy at the club in under three years in charge. ""Madrid too had a bad start to the season and if they had beaten Valencia at home four games from the end they would have been top. ""It is very difficult to fight over so many games, but in one match we are competitive and capable of beating anyone. ""Over a full year you need to do things extraordinarily well, at 110 percent like we did last year."" Atletico took advantage last year of a minor dip from the big two. Simeone's men won the title with 90 points, a tally which wouldn't have been enough to be champions in any of the previous four seasons. However, they contributed to the lowering of that tally by claiming two draws with Barca and a win and a draw against Madrid in their four league games against the big two. Moreover, there is reason to believe ahead of their La Liga opener away to Rayo Vallecano on Monday that they could even be stronger this season, particularly in attacking areas. Mario Mandzukic has gotten off to the perfect start as he tries to emulate Costa's prolific 36-goal season from last term as he scored the winner against Real after just 90 seconds on Friday. The 30 million euro capture of French international Antoine Griezmann is a significant upgrade on the departed Adrian Lopez, whilst 23-year-old Mexican international Raul Jimenez could easily surpass the feats of an ageing David Villa. Of more concern is whether Atletico's watertight defence that led them to so many crucial 1-0 wins in the title run will remain as solid. Vitally the central defensive pairing of Miranda and Diego Godin has been retained despite interest from Barca and Bayern Munich. Guilherme Siqueira, a 10 million euro capture from Benfica, has the pace and La Liga experience from a spell at Granada to cope with the expectations of replacing Luis at left-back. However, the biggest doubt surrounds another signing from Benfica, Slovenian goalkeeper Jan Oblak. The 21-year-old is the most expensive goalkeeper in Spanish football history after arriving for 16 million euros, but was benched by Simeone in favour of a much cheaper option in Miguel Angel Moya for both legs of the Super Cup. For all the money spent by Chelsea on Atletico players in recent months, it is the Chelsea owned player in Courtois, who spent three seasons on loan in the Spanish capital, who is likely to prove the hardest to replace."
584,23/08/2014,14:11,"Atletico title favourites, claims Barca boss",Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has said Atletico Madrid are the favourites to retain their La Liga title despite the millions spent by his side and Real Madrid in recent months.,"Atletico showed their success was no one season wonder as they claimed the first domestic trophy of the season in Spain with a 2-1 aggregate victory over Real to win the Spanish Super Cup on Friday. ""The favourite for the league is Atletico,"" said Enrique, whose side get their La Liga campaign underway at home to Elche on Sunday. ""It is not just out of respect for the defending champion. They continue with the same ideas from last season and they have perfected them despite changing players. ""I said last season I saw them as favourites for the league and the Champions League and they said it was a brave thing to say, but they are the clear favourites. ""Madrid are our eternal rivals and they have strengthened. It will be a very exciting championship. We have the desire having not won anything last season and no one will beat us for desire."" Enrique is still hoping to have Neymar available for the visit of Elche despite the Brazilian striker suffering an ankle sprain in training on Thursday. Pedro Rodriguez has returned to training after suffering from a bout of gastroenteritis and is expected to be fit for selection. Claudio Bravo, Ivan Rakitic and Jeremy Mathieu could make their competitive debuts, but other big money signings Marc-Andre Ter Stegen and Thomas Vermaelen are injured and Luis Suarez remains suspended for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup."
585,20/08/2014,02:22,"Di Maria Real's best player, claims Simeone",Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone claimed compatriot Angel di Maria is Real Madrid's best player after the Argentine midfielder started on the bench as the Champions League finalists drew 1-1 in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Tuesday.,"There are runours that Di Maria will move away from the Spanish capital, given the wealth of attacking options after the arrival of World Cup star James Rodriguez, with Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain reportedly interested. However, Simeone claimed he is even more vital to Real than World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. ""In the first-half despite defending close to our area we had three or four chances to score a goal,"" he said. ""The second half was more or less the same, with a little bit better play from Madrid with the introduction of Di Maria. ""That was logical because he is the best player they have. It is an important draw and allows us to play a for the trophy at home with a 50-50 chance. ""It is my opinion that Di Maria is Madrid's best player for sure. His ability to change games in the middle of the park helps everyone else to play well."" Real boss Carlo Ancelotti rebuked Simeone for failing to mention Ronaldo and Bale, who both scored as Real beat Atletico 4-1 after extra time in the Champions League final in Lisbon back in May. ""He has forgotten the World Player of the Year and Bale, who scored in Lisbon. He has forgotten many players, but it is true Di Maria is one of many great players we have. ""He is a Real Madrid player and I will use him as I think is best."" Ronaldo was replaced at half-time due to a minor muscle injury, but Ancelotti is convinced the Portuguese won't be sidelined for any prolonged period of time. ""He had a strain after the first-half and he wasn't comfortable. We will evaluate him tomorrow and do all the proper checks, but it doesn't appear anything too serious,"" said the Italian. Rodriguez had also surprisingly started on the bench, but he made his presence felt after replacing Ronaldo in the second-half as he scored his first goal for Madrid 10 minutes from time to open the scoring. However, Atletico weren't to be denied and Raul Garcia flicked home two minutes from time to give them a vital away goal heading into the return leg at the Vicente Calderon on Friday."
586,20/08/2014,01:22,Atletico response denies James dream start,A Raul Garcia equaliser two minutes from time denied James Rodriguez a dream home debut for Real Madrid as Atletico Madrid salvaged a 1-1 draw in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Tuesday.,"Rodriguez had surprisingly started on the bench, but replaced Cristiano Ronaldo at half-time when the World Player of the Year was substituted due to the reported recurrence of a knee injury. Colombian world cup star Rodriguez opened the scoring with his first goal for Real 10 minutes from time. However, Atletico got a precious away goal to take into the return leg at the Vicente Calderon on Friday when Garcia flicked home a late corner from close range. Despite leaving James and Angel di Maria on the bench from the off, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti saw his side dominate possession in the opening 45 minutes against a typically physical Atletico side. However, Real created precious little in front of goal and it was Atletico who had the better chances in the first-half as both Mario Mandzukic and Saul Niguez forced Iker Casillas into smart saves down to his left. Ronaldo's only impression on the match, before he departed, came four minutes before the break as he rose highest to meet Gareth Bale's cross, but couldn't get enough purchase in his header and the ball floated wide. The Portuguese then made way for Rodriguez at the break and Real instantly made a greater impression on the Atletico goal as Bale's powerful right-footed effort was beaten away by Moya. There was an escape for the Atletico 'keeper on his debut 20 minutes from time, though, as he could only parry Bale's fierce free-kick back into the danger area and Toni Kroos blazed over with the goal at his mercy. Real continued to push in search of the winner and thought they had it on 80 minutes when Rodriguez fired home with the aid of a deflection off Cristian Ansaldi. Yet Atletico responded with the kind of spirit that willed them to the La Liga title last season and Koke's fierce shot had to be turned away by Casillas. There was nothing the Spanish captain could do moments later as the unmarked Garcia flicked home Koke's corner. Real will now have to score at least once when they visit the Calderon later in the week if they are to continue their quest for six trophies this season having already collected the UEFA Super Cup with a 2-0 win over Sevilla last week."
587,19/08/2014,02:15,Atletico struggle to keep up in arms race with Real and Barca,"Just three months after remarkably breaking Barcelona and Real Madrid's grip on the La Liga title, Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone has denied any repeat of their miracle championship triumph is possible.","""We have to try to compete with Sevilla, Valencia and Athletic Bilbao for the Champions League places,"" he claimed on Monday ahead of his side's Spanish Super Cup first-leg against Real on Tuesday. ""With 95 million euros we have signed nine players, Real Madrid have signed two players for 95 million. That is the difference."" The other major difference is that success has also brought Atletico the struggle of holding onto their best players. Top scorer Diego Costa and Filipe Luis have joined Thibaut Courtois in returning to his parent club Chelsea after a three-year loan spell in the Spanish capital. That money has been reinvested in a promising attacking trio of Antoine Griezmann, Mario Mandzukic and Raul Jimenez, but the major coup of the close season for Atletico has been holding onto the likes of Koke, Diego Godin and Miranda despite interest from Barca and Bayern Munich. By contrast, Real have splashed over 100 million euros on the squad that won both the Champions League and Copa del Rey last season without having to sanction any significant sales, although Angel di Maria could exit before the end of the transfer window. An already oversubscribed midfield has been bolstered by World Cup winner Toni Kroos and the competition's top goalscorer James Rodriguez, whilst Costa Rican goalkeeper Keylor Navas will rival Iker Casillas to be number one. ""I think we have a better team than last season because we have signed three players that add quality to the team,"" Real coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Monday. Of the three title contenders, though, it is Barcelona who have undergone the most significant change as they look to bounce back from a first trophyless season in six years. The first change at the Camp Nou over the summer was the coach as they turned to former captain Luis Enrique to replace Gerardo Martino in the hope he can have the same impact as his former teammate Pep Guardiola did in charge. With a two transfer window ban only temporarily suspended, Barca have also been very active in the market with the capture of controversial Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez leading their 150 million euro outlay. Suarez won't even be able to play until late October after his appeal against a four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport last week. However, he could return for a mouth-watering first El Clasico clash between Real and Barca at the Santiago Bernabeu should the game be scheduled for Sunday, October 26. Enrique's main task will be finding a blend for all of Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar to function together as all three look to shake off a disappointing end to their respective World Cups. For all their attacking talent, questions also remain over Barca's defence despite the expensive recruitment of Jeremy Mathieu from Valencia and Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen. Goalkeepers Claudio Bravo and Marc-Andre Ter Stegen will also battle to succeed the departed Victor Valdes as number one after being signed for 12 million euros apiece. Outside of the big three, Europa League winners Sevilla have made the most significant moves in a bid to get back into the Champions League as they have brought in Barca loanee Gerard Deulofeu, Argentine international Ever Banega and Liverpool reject Iago Aspas. Valencia should also be back in contention for the top four after Singaporean businessman Peter Lim finally completed his takeover of the club with Spanish under-21 international striker Rodrigo their big name signing of the summer. Meanwhile, Basque duo Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad retain ambitions of Champions League football despite losing Ander Herrera and Griezmann to Manchester United and Atletico respectively."
588,18/08/2014,13:20,"Real even better than last season, insists Ancelotti",Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti believes his side will be even stronger this campaign than the one which won the Champions League and Copa del Rey last season.,"Madrid have added World Cup stars James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos and Keylor Navas at an expense of over 100 million euros as they aim to lift a potential six trophies this season. They already have one to their name after defeating Sevilla 2-0 to win the European Super Cup in Cardiff last week and will face Atletico Madrid in a repeat of the Champions League final over two legs on Tuesday and Friday in the Spanish Super Cup. ""I think we have a better team than last season because we have signed three players that add quality to the team,"" Ancelotti said on Monday. Whilst Rodriguez and Kroos went straight into the starting line-up for the victory over Sevilla, Navas has had to wait to make his competitive debut and Ancelotti confirmed that Iker Casillas will once again start in goal. Argentinean midfielder Angel di Maria also didn't feature in Cardiff amidst reports that he could be sold before the end of the transfer window with Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain reportedly interested. However, Ancelotti dismissed comparisons with Mesut Ozil this time last year before his deadline day move to Arsenal. ""Di Maria is available like all the other players. It could be that he starts and has his chance, but he is just like the other players. Tomorrow one team will play and on Friday a different team will play. ""I don't remember the Ozil situation and I am not going to start talking about that topic because I will lose my concentration on tomorrow's game. ""I don't know what Di Maria has decided. He is ready and it could be that he can help us. Until August 31 that is the line we will take. Whether he stays or goes, after that everything will return to normal."" Atletico have also been busy in the transfer market as they have brought in nine players to help replace Thibaut Courtois, Filipe Luis and Diego Costa who have all moved to Chelsea. However, despite ending the dominance of Real and Barcelona to win La Liga last season, coach Diego Simeone has played down expectations ahead of the new campaign. ""We need to look at Sevilla, Valencia and Athletic Bilbao. We will try to fight with them for the Champions League places,"" said the Argentine. ""With 95 million euros we have signed nine players, Real Madrid have signed two players for 95 million. That is the difference."" Atletico will hand debuts to their star signings Antoine Griezmann and Mario Mandzukic in attack. However, Arda Tura misses out with a hamstring injury and new goalkeeper Jan Oblak will start on the bench as he lacks match fitness after suffering a hip injury in pre-season."

The money received from the sales of Costa and Filipe Luis has however been reinvested in an exciting new frontline as Mario Mandzukic joined from Bayern Munich, Mexican international Raul Jimenez was signed from Club America, and Antoine Griezmann moved from Real Sociedad for 30 million euros ($40 million, £24 million). All three are in line to make their competitive debutes at the Santiago Bernabeu, but playmaker Arda Turan misses out due to a hamstring injury. The Super Cup is one of the few titles Atletico have missed out on during Simeone's three years in charge as they were just edged out on away goals by Barcelona last season. And midfielder Mario Suarez is determined to make amends for their heartbreaking 4-1 defeat to Real after extra time in Lisbon three months ago having been just over a minute away from wining the Champions League for the first time in the club's history. ""On Tuesday we are playing for an important title against our eternal rivals and we will face it as we always do. We want to win and everybody knows that,"" said Suarez. ""It will be very difficult. The two teams know each other very well and it will be a great, hard-fought game as all derbies are. ""We know that the team that commits the fewest errors and is more concentrated across the 180 minutes will be the one with most chance of winning the trophy."" Real haven't rested on their laurels after claiming a tenth European crown as they have splashed over 100 million euros on World Cup stars James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos and goalkeeper Keylor Navas. Colombian Rodriguez and Germany playmaker Kroos made an immediate impact in their debuts as Real won the first of a potential six trophies this season by defeating Sevilla 2-0 to win the UEFA Super Cup last week. However, Navas has had to wait for his opportunity as Iker Casillas started against Sevilla in Cardiff despite his poor form in Spain's disastrous campaign at the World Cup. Real boss Carlo Ancelotti, though, hasn't yet declared who his first choice 'keeper for the campaign will be and Navas is willing to push Casillas for his place in the side. ""I have come here to work with humility and to try hard every day, which is what I have done my whole life. I am at the disposition of the coaching staff and I will never give up,"" Costa Rican Navas told the club's website. ""Now we need to think about the next game. We want to win and we have that winning mentality. ""The team is very motivated and we know it is an important title that we will all fight to win."" The second leg will be played at Atletico's Vicente Calderon stadium on Friday evening before both clubs begin their league campaigns next Monday."

""Atletico Madrid again suffered the cruelty of football in a continental final."" After leading 1-0 for nearly an hour, Atletico let Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos equalise in injury time in the 93rd minute, sending the Champions League final in Lisbon into extra time. Over the next 30 minutes, Real tore apart a physically exhausted Atletico, scoring another three goals to leave the final tally at 4-1. Pro-Real daily Marca splashed a giant photo of Ramos roaring in triumph above the headline ""La Decima!"" -- Real fans' term for the longed-for 10th title -- for which it thanked his ""providential header"". The result echoed the last time Atletico reached the European finals in 1974 when Bayern Munich's Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck equalised 1-1 in the 119th minute. Two days later they played a deciding game, which Bayern won 4-0. ""Forty years later, Atletico Madrid loses a European cup final, again. Forty years later, they do it following a very similar script to that of 1974 when a goal by Schwarzenbeck forced a deciding game in which Bayern had no opposition,"" said an article in Barcelona-based daily Mundo Deportivo. ""What a way to go!"" for Atletico, read a headline in the paper, under pictures of dejected Atletico players and jubilant Real fans. Spain's leading daily, El Pais, delivered a similar verdict. ""The European cup was historically important as it crowned Real Madrid for the 10th time, its king of kings, and condemned Atletico in as cruel a fashion as it did four decades ago,"" the paper said. ""This time it was not a tall German who would frustrate Atletico but Sergio Ramos, who is a Real Madrid player in his genes."" Major sports daily AS said Ramos's goal helped to make up for an error by Real's goalkeeper captain Iker Casillas, who was criticised for letting in Atletico defender Diego Godin's header in the 36th minute. ""The Decima has to be special and it was. It could not just be another Cup, a win like others, or a similar happiness,"" said AS sports writer Juanma Trueba. ""The heroism, concentrated in the unbreakable faith of a team in the last minutes of standard play, was an infinite cruelty seen from the perspective of Atletico de Madrid,"" he added. ""Atletico were champions for 56 minutes, almost an hour, to which you have to add the six minutes they were champions 40 years ago. It happened the same way as it did then. When they thought they were victors, when everyone did, except Real Madrid.""

""The price tag means nothing to me,"" said Bale who moved to Real last year from Tottenham in a world record deal. ""I would have come here for a penny if it meant I could play in the big tournaments and win the big titles. ""It's unbelievable to lift this trophy -- it will be a memory which will live with me forever."" Bale said he never gave up hope that Real would win the match despite needing an injury-time header from Sergio Ramos to take the final into extra-time. ""We have played Atletico four times this season and they are always close games. It was difficult when they went in front, but we kept trying to break them down,"" added Bale. ""But we got the goal in injury time. That gave us the momentum. ""We kept playing our game, we kept attacking and we always believed we could win."" Bale did briefly fear his missed chances may have proved costly. ""I had a feeling it may not be my night, but I told myself to keep persevering and that one will come. ""When I had the chance in extra-time I just told myself 'don't miss it'."" And Bale's coach Carlo Ancelotti praised his perseverance to once again be in the right place at the right time after also scoring the goal that handed Real the Copa del Rey against Barcelona last month. ""He tried before in the game and his final shot just wasn't good enough, but at the right moment he was ready to score. ""Not just today but all season he has been a very important player for us and I am sure that he will be even better next year."" Ancelotti now becomes only the second man after Bob Paisley to win the competition three times after also achieving the feat with AC Milan in 2003 and 2007. The Italian, though, admitted that he feared the worst as time was running out towards the end of normal time. ""The hardest thing was getting the equaliser. We suffered a lot in trying to get it because Atletico didn't give us space and they defended very well. ""We tried with all our energy and eventually the game changed. The goal we scored gave us a lot of strength to keep going."" Such was Real's relief at winning their 10th European crown after a 12-year wait that captain Iker Casillas said it meant more than winning the World Cup with Spain four years ago.

609,22/05/2014,02:11,Football: Koke leads Atletico's resurrection,"There are few players that represent the turnaround in Atletico Madrid's fortunes since the arrival of Diego Simeone as coach than Jorge Resurreccion, or Koke as he is more commonly known.","Simeone's own resurrection of Atletico has carried the club to four trophies in two and a half years -- including a first La Liga title in 18 years this season -- and into Saturday's Champions League final against Real Madrid in Lisbon. A product of the Atletico youth academy, the 22-year-old has had a stellar season which has seen him become not just a regular in Simeone's set-up but also in the Spanish national team. However, he didn't always seem destined for great things. Koke was part of the Atletico side that were eliminated from the Copa del Rey by third-tier Albacete just days before Simeone's arrival in December 2011 and has admitted he was on the verge of leaving the club when the transfer market opened the following month. ""Simeone has helped me improve physically and on the ball,"" he told Spanish newspaper El Pais. ""When he arrived I was about to leave, I wasn't playing a lot and I needed minutes to keep improving. ""The manager told me to trust in him, that I wouldn't necessarily be a starter every week but to work hard because my opportunity would come. We believed in each other."" That trust has borne spectacular success for both men as on top of being Atletico's top creator with 18 assists this season, Koke has also shown an eye for important goals amongst his tally of seven for the season. He scored the winner in vital away victories at Real Sociedad, Malaga and Athletic Bilbao as well as scoring at home to Real Madrid in the 2-2 draw at the Vicente Calderon in March and the only goal of the game in the second leg as Atletico eliminated Barcelona from the Champions League at the quarter-final stage. That form will see him follow his best season at club level with his first senior international tournament at the World Cup after winning the under-21 European Championship last summer. ""I have blind faith in Koke, he thinks a lot about the team,"" said Spain coach Vicente del Bosque after naming Koke in his provisional 30-man squad for the tournament in Brazil next month. ""He has given a lot to Atletico and Atletico has given a lot to him. He can play in any position and he always does well. He is an important discovery."" Del Bosque's words have been shared by Spain's most decorated player of all-time in Xavi Hernandez, who believes the Atletico starlet will be his successor in the national team. ""He is destined to carry the baton in the Spanish national team for the next 10 years. He is already an extraordinary player,"" said the Barcelona midfielder. There have been rumours that Koke could even replace Xavi at Barca in the coming years, while he has also attracted interest from Manchester United. However, of more pressing importance is securing his status as a living legend amongst the Atletico fan base by being part of the first Rojiblancos side to win the Champions League and deny rivals Real their much-awaited 10th European crown in the process."
610,21/05/2014,02:05,Football: Atletico inspired by spirit of Aragones,Atletico Madrid face Real Madrid in the Champions League final on Saturday attempting to put to bed one of the club's most painful nights.,"Los Rojiblancos missed out on the European Cup by a matter of seconds to what became an all-conquering Bayern Munich side 40 years ago. Bayern, featuring Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd Mueller, went on to win three European Cups in a row, and yet they almost never won the first, as they went into the final minute of extra time 1-0 down. The goal had been scored by Atletico's greatest player of all-time, Luis Aragones, just six minutes from the end of extra time, but the Spaniards were denied when Miguel Reina -- father of current Napoli goalkeeper Pepe Reina -- let Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck's hopeful effort slip through his grasp. In the days before penalty shoot-outs, Bayern went on to win 4-0 in the replay in Brussels just two days later. On Sunday an estimated 200,000 Atletico Madrid fans crowded round the Neptuno fountain and surrounding streets in the centre of the Spanish capital to celebrate their side's first La Liga title in 18 years. However, amongst chorus upon chorus of chanting, it wasn't inspirational manager Diego Simeone or top scorer Diego Costa who was the most prominent name, but that of Aragones. The man who also coached Spain to the first of three successive major tournament victories at the European Championship in 2008, died on February 1 this year aged 75. Since then he has become an inspiration for arguably the most successful season in Atletico's 111-year history. A picture of Aragones adorned the plane that took the players to the away leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against AC Milan. Once the seven-time European champions had been easily disposed of 5-1 on aggregate, it was one of Aragones' famous decrees ""win, win and win again"" that met the players in a spectacular display by the Vicente Calderon crowd as they hosted Barcelona in the last eight. Even after clinching the title with a hard-fought 1-1 draw away to Barca on Saturday, Simeone thanked all those at the club who had helped bring about the success. Among that list he included Aragones, who he said ""was surely defending in our box during the second half."" Defeat to Bayern in the '74 final was not just heartbreaking. It helped mould a culture of pessimism around the club that was generally sustained despite the odd trophy for the following four decades. Yet, under the Simeone revolution, the tide is turning within the Spanish capital. Since the Argentine's arrival two and a half years ago, Atletico have won more trophies than Barcelona or Real Madrid. Far from being the self-confessed ""cursed ones"", Atletico beat Real in their own backyard to end a 14-year hoodoo in the Madrid derby and win the Copa del Rey final little more than a year ago. The day after Aragones' death, they went top of the league for the first time in 18 years and, despite being briefly knocked off their perch, had the mental fortitude to get back and stay there. ""The capacity to motivate comes from showing them the shirt of this club. The motivation is to play for Atletico Madrid not against whoever is in front us,"" says Simeone. However, the chance to not only win their first Champions League title but also continue Real's 12-year wait for their treasured 10th European crown would be the strongest signal yet that the balance of power has tipped to the red and white side of Madrid. Yet, Atletico's need is also urgent. Any such power shift is likely to be fleeting. The motivation to play for that shirt is complete right now, but unlikely to last long as Europe's big spenders circle to pluck off their best players and possibly Simeone himself. Saturday's date in Lisbon represents their best shot of European glory for 40 years. Given the harsh financial realities that affect performance at the top level of the Champions League, it could take them 40 years or more to get another chance."

When Simeone arrived back at Atletico two days before Christmas in 2011, the club sat four points from the relegation zone and had just been eliminated by third tier Albacete over two legs in the Copa del Rey. Nearly two-and-a-half years later nine of those beaten by Albacete were parading around Stamford Bridge having just defeated Chelsea 3-1 to reach the club's first Champions League final for 40 years. Simeone had been welcomed back as a prodigal son straight away. A key component of the side the last time Atletico won the league 18 years ago, the club's spiral coincided with his departure as just four seasons later they were relegated. Led back to the top flight by a fresh-faced Fernando Torres, the Atletico fans became accustomed to loving and losing as one by one each of their heroes was picked off by richer foes abroad. Torres' transfer to Liverpool in 2007 was followed by the departures of Sergio Aguero, Diego Forlan and David de Gea before Simeone's appointment. Even a period of sustained success under the Argentine which reaped the Europa League in 2012, Champions League qualification and a first victory over Real Madrid in 14 years in the Copa del Rey final last season, Atletico couldn't hold onto their star player. Last summer it was Radamel Falcao who departed in a 60 million euro move to football's latest nouveau riche fad in Monaco. Yet, Simeone's incessant focus on a team that works completely as one rather than relying on individual stars has, even in Falcao's absence, propelled Los Rojiblancos to even greater achievements. Simeone's repeated soundbites in press conferences had played down Atletico's title chances at every chance this season. However, after the first leg of their Champions League semi-final against Chelsea, his mask slipped slightly when bombarded by questions linking top scorer Diego Costa to Chelsea next season. ""We may envy others for wealth, but we envy no one for competitive spirit,"" he replied. It is that unrelenting competitiveness that has allowed Atletico to achieve what few believed was possible in derailing Barcelona and Real Madrid's hegemony at the top of La Liga. When Valencia last achieved the feat 10 years ago, the world and Spanish football was in a different place. An economic boom had allowed the likes of Valencia and Deportivo la Coruna to spend well beyond their means to compete at home and abroad. Whilst the financial crisis has crippled the rest of Spanish football in the meantime, Barcelona and Real have continuously got richer thanks to their expanding brands around the globe and an imbalanced TV deal structured to allow the big two to take nearly 50 percent of the total value of the rights. Last summer every single La Liga side lost one or more of their best players barring Barca and Madrid. The continued exodus of the likes of Alvaro Negredo, Jesus Navas, Roberto Soldado, Falcao and Fernando Llorente only serving to increase the gap. When Valencia won the league 10 years ago they did so with 77 points. For the past two seasons Real and Barca were crowned champions respectively with 100. A three-way race has lowered that tally slightly this season, but Atletico easily surpassed their club record of 87, which came in a 22-team league in 1995/96, to register 90. To keep that level of consistency up for 38 games is extraordinary in itself, to do so in a season in which they will play 61 matches in total speaks volumes of Simeone's ability to motivate and manage his squad throughout the season."

621,12/05/2014,03:04,Football: Diego Costa's World Cup twists and turns,"Playing at a World Cup in the land of your birth is a dream for most footballers, however Diego Costa's road back to Brazil will see him lead the line for their arch-rivals.","Costa made his debut for Brazil against Italy in March 2012. In March of this year he made a new debut against Italy, this time for Spain. After just two friendly appearances for La Selecao, Costa was allowed under FIFA rules to switch allegiance to Spain. He did that in November of last year and now he will be a key player in the World Cup Group B battles against Netherlands, Chile and Australia. The nationality changes was one of many twists and turns in the career of the 25-year-old goalscorer. Signed by Portuguese side Braga when he was just 17, Costa joined Atletico Madrid a year later. However, it was not until he returned to Atletico with Diego Simeone at the helm after four loan spells at Celta Vigo, Albacete, Valladolid and Rayo Vallecano that he even became a first-team regular at the club. And last season he scored 20 goals and formed a lethal partnership with Colombian star Radamel Falcao as Atletico beat city rivals Real Madrid for the first time in 14 years to win the Copa del Rey. This season, in Falcao's absence, he has taken another step up to become the team's talisman and top scorer. ""He will be the best injection Spain will have in Brazil. He is different to everyone else,"" Simeone said recently. ""He has great physical and mental strength, but can also still improve a lot. The Spanish national team will help him improve as well because it is a different style of play."" Costa failed to shine on his Spanish debut, but he did show flashes to suggest he is able enough technically to cope with his new teammates' tiki-taka style, which is in stark contrast to Atletico's power-based, counter-attacking game. Should his adaption prove successful he could turn out to be the final piece of the jigsaw for a Spanish side that has won the last two of their three consecutive major tournaments without a central striker in form. At the 2010 World Cup, David Villa scored his five goals from a wide left position, whilst at the Euros in 2012, Fernando Torres won the competition's golden boot with just three goals and having started just two of six games. Off the field Costa appears to have been welcomed with open arms by other members of the squad. ""He is a player that I love,"" said Barcelona full-back Jordi Alba before the Italy game, whilst coach Vicente del Bosque has tried to play down the controversy over Costa's switch of allegiance. ""His is a unique case. He was born in Brazil, but was formed here and has shown in his club that he deserves to come with us, that is why I have called him up,"" explained the former Real Madrid boss. However, Costa's volatile temperament could yet be tested. Never one to shy away from confrontation with opposing defenders or fans, he will be under intense scrutiny and is sure to receive a hostile reception from an unforgiving Brazilian public. For all the positive traits he can bring, should he lose his head Spain's chances of retaining their title could be ruined in an instant. That is a risk Del Bosque has proven himself ready to take."
622,07/05/2014,23:08,Football: Real's title hopes dashed by Valladolid draw,Real Madrid's La Liga title hopes were all but ended as they conceded five minutes from time to draw 1-1 away to Valladolid on Wednesday.,"Sergio Ramos' free-kick had given Madrid the lead 10 minutes before half-time, but Humberto Osorio's late header rounded off a horrible evening for the visitors as Cristiano Ronaldo also hobbled off with an injury in the first 10 minutes putting his participation in the Champions League final in doubt. The draw leaves Real four points behind leaders Atletico Madrid and a point adrift of Barcelona with two games to play. Real will be mathematically out of the title race should Atletico win at home to Malaga on Sunday and Atletico could be crowned champions for the first time in 18 years should Barcelona also drop points away to Elche. Madrid captain Iker Casillas was back in goal in a La Liga match for the first time in 17 months, but he nearly had to pick the ball out of his net after just five minutes when Javi Guerra's header from close range clipped the outside of the post. Madrid then suffered a huge blow when Ronaldo limped off to be replaced by Alvaro Morata. The Portuguese punched the top of the dugout in frustration as he left the field and could now miss the rest of Real's season, including the Champions League final against Atletico on May 24. In Ronaldo's absence Sergio Ramos took on free-kick duties and continued his tremendous scoring streak of late with his fifth goal in four games as his dipping free-kick had to much power for Jaime in the Valladolid goal. Ramos could even have had a second before half-time as his header from Luka Modric's corner flew just wide. The visitors had to withstand some concerted pressure from Valladolid in the second period as Guerra saw an acrobatic overhead kick fly inches past 25 minutes from time. And the hosts finally got their reward when Alvario Rubio's corner from the right was powered into the far corner of the net by Osorio. The result could have been even better for Valladolid as Zakara Bergditch led a three-on-one counter-attack moments later, but the Frenchman's final pass was cut out by the covering Pepe."

Just a week after a fan threw a banana at Barcelona's Brazilian defender Dani Alves, another player, Levante's Senegalese midfielder Pape Diop, was subjected to monkey taunts on Sunday. ""UEFA and its president Michel Platini strongly condemn all forms of discrimination including recent racist behaviour of fans in Spain,"" Platini's spokesman Pedro Pinto said in a message on Twitter. ""UEFA has tough rules and sanctions against all forms of discrimination for all of its competitions,"" he added. ""Where instances occur outside of our jurisdiction, we support appropriate action being taken by the relevant authorities."" The 28-year-old Diop accused Atletico Madrid fans of subjecting him to monkey-chanting abuse as his side inflicted a shock 2-0 defeat on the Liga leaders at the weekend. He reacted by dancing in front of the travelling fans at the final whistle, and television images showed some furious Atletico supporters making monkey gestures. ""It affected me a lot,"" Diop said. ""I don't have anything against the Atletico fans. It is a provocation I get in many grounds. It has to stop. I don't know if it is racism or a lack of respect,"" he added. ""They have to stop making monkey gestures at black players."" Spain's professional football league, the LFP, said it ""strongly condemns"" any racist, discriminatory, violent, xenophobic or intolerant acts, especially in football and sport. The league warned of sanctions for serious breaches of anti-racism laws and said all member clubs would be obliged to follow special training to prevent a repeat of such behaviour. ""The LFP will pursue this type of behaviour,"" it said in a statement. The monkey slurs made headlines in the British press. ""Spanish football must face up to the fact that they have a serious racist problem. They can't continue to bury their heads in the sand,"" tweeted former England international Gary Lineker who once played for Barcelona. A week earlier, Barcelona's Brazilian international Alves shone a spotlight on racism in Spanish football when he took a bite out of a banana thrown at him during his side's win over Villarreal. Star players of different nationalities and races including Neymar, Sergio Aguero and Luis Suarez joined a ""we are all monkeys"" campaign after the incident. The alleged banana-thrower was subsequently arrested and handed a lifetime ban from the stadium by Villarreal. Alves said it was not a one-off. ""I have been in Spain 11 years and it has been the same for 11 years. You have to laugh at these backward people,"" he said after the game. Top-selling Spanish sports daily Marca said a delegation of Atletico players visited Diop in the changing rooms after the match to offer their apologies. But there was no official public reaction from the club. ""Diop's little dance directed at the Atletico fans was over the top,"" Barcelona-based sports daily Mundo Deportivo said Monday. ""But the alleged racist shouts were, too ... just like any other insult,"" it added. The reaction echoed the tone of some comments by Spanish football officials after the Alves banana-throwing scandal a week earlier. ""It is not everyone. I want to think these are isolated incidents. In football there is no racism, not at all,"" Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque said at the time. Salvador Rodriguez Moya, journalist and author of ""Black card to racism"" which recounts 300 racist acts in Spanish football, said it would be wrong to condemn all of Spain and all Spanish football as racist, describing the incidents as isolated and anecdotal. ""But it is still true that it is like a sleeping volcano, which could erupt at any moment,"" Moya said in an interview."

We can't avert our eyes,"" he added. Ramon Miravitllas, journalist, author and academic who has written about politics in sport, said parts of Spain suffered from ignorance of history and other cultures. ""In deepest Spain there is still today not racism but class structure, selectiveness, exclusion, or a lack of understanding of certain cultures,"" he told AFP.

Diego Simeone's men are on a run of nine straight league wins and another victory away to mid-table Levante will give Los Rojiblancos the chance to wrap up the championship at home to Malaga next weekend and avoid needing to get something from their daunting visit to Barcelona on the final day of the campaign. Even in the wake of his side's famous 3-1 win over Chelsea, Simeone insisted he was immediately ""preparing and focusing on the objective of beating Levante."" Full-back Filipe Luis echoed his coach's sentiments and believes they will have beaten ""the best team in Europe"" if they go on to win La Liga or the Champions League. ""This team never gives up. There are a lot of very important games before Lisbon and we are going to try and win them all,"" said the Brazilian. ""Real Madrid are the most difficult opponent you can face, they are the best team in Europe in my opinion, but we always approach games with humility and try our best to win. There is a long way to go though and now Levante is the most important game."" Simeone is expected to make a few changes to the side that started at Stamford Bridge with captain Gabi back from suspension and the likes of Raul Garcia and David Villa set to feature. However, top scorer Diego Costa should be fit to start despite being withdrawn late on in midweek due to a knee injury. Real Madrid could be nine points adrift of Atletico, albeit with two games in hand, by the time they kick-off later on Sunday at home to Valencia. Los Blancos enjoyed a fantastic win in midweek themselves as they hammered European champions Bayern Munich 4-0 at the Allianz Arena to qualify for their first European final for 12 years. Having already lifted the Copa del Rey, Real could still win an historic treble this season should Atletico stumble in their final few league games. And coach Carlo Ancelotti is savouring the success of his first season in charge. ""Obviously I am very happy, you have to enjoy the good moments because, sooner or later, the bad moments will come,"" he told Sky Italia. ""It gives me great satisfaction to take Real Madrid to the final 12 years later."" Barcelona also maintain a slight chance of retaining the title, although they need both Atletico and Real to slip up as well as winning their three remaining games. The Catalans can close the gap on Atletico to one point when they host relegation-threatened Getafe earlier on Sunday and, despite looking like they will miss out on a major trophy for the first time in six years, midfielder Sergio Busquets insists they have to put the pressure on both sides from the capital. ""We still have the end of La Liga to come, but it has not been a good season when it comes to results,"" he said on Thursday. ""We know that we don't depend on ourselves and that makes it more difficult, but we still have hope. We need to exhaust all the possibilities."" Fixtures (all times GMT)"

Then last May Los Rojiblancos exacted revenge by beating Real for the first time in 14 years in the Portuguese's last competitive game in charge of Los Blancos to win the Copa del Rey last May. Atletico have built on that success and are on course for the greatest season in their history as they are just three games away from winning both La Liga for the first time in 18 years and a first ever Champions League. Both sides' success this season has been built upon a solid defensive base and Atletico captain Gabi is not expecting a goal-fest over the two legs. ""Without a doubt Mourinho's teams are very well prepared tactically and they are going to come here to play their usual game, to not leave any space at the back, to play on the wings and in the air, it's similar to what we do here,"" he said on Sunday. ""It's going to be a very competitive game of two teams with very similar styles. We are very excited about the game and we have to play well at home because that could determine the second leg. ""It has been a hard season but the most important thing is what is coming up. The team has been capable of making it into the situation we are in now but we cannot relax, we haven't achieved anything yet. ""We are in a great situation and on Tuesday we want to take a big step towards the final, but we have to do the talking on the pitch."" Atletico will be boosted by the news that on-loan Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois will be available to play against his parent club as UEFA declared a clause in his contract forcing Atletico to pay an extra fee to field him as ineligible. The Belgian international has becomes a key part of the Atletico side over the past three seasons and Gabi is confident that despite his tender age the 21-year-old has the temperament to handle the situation without any problems. ""He was a bit uncertain at first waiting to see what would happen, but he's always been certain that he wants to play and he was sure that they could would resolve it. ""He's very excited, this opportunity doesn't come along very often, if you are in a team that gets to the semi-finals and possibly the final it is difficult for that to happen again and it's a great opportunity for him. ""He's very focused and even though he is very young, he has the capacity to not let that affect him."" Simeone's men were handed a further boost on Sunday as midfielder Arda Turan returned to training meaning the Argentine coach now has a full-fit squad to choose from. Mourinho has no such luck as he must lift his players from a stunning 2-1 defeat at home to the Premier League's bottom club Sunderland on Saturday that left their title hopes in tatters. Eden Hazard missed that match as he continues to recover from a calf injury picked up in the quarter-final win over Paris Saint-Germain, but Chelsea are hopeful the Belgian international will be fit to play some part at the Vicente Calderon. Branislav Ivanovic is also suspended so Ashley Cole is expected to be handed a rare start with Cesar Azpilicueta moving across to right-back."

638,11/04/2014,14:25,"Football: Courtois free to face Chelsea, insist UEFA","Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois will be free to face his parent club Chelsea in the Champions League semi-finals, UEFA claimed on Friday.","European football's governing body said that any provision in Courtois' loan agreement preventing his participation is against the competition's rules. ""Both the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations contain clear provisions which strictly forbid any club to exert, or attempt to exert, any influence whatsoever over the players that another club may (or may not) field in a match,"" they said in a statement. ""It follows that any provision in a private contract between clubs which might function in such a way as to influence who a club fields in a match is null, void and unenforceable so far as UEFA is concerned."" Atletico director Clemente Villaverde confirmed that he had met with UEFA officials to clarify the situation and that the Belgian international would be free to play without the Spanish side having to pay an extra fee to Chelsea. ""Courtois could have played in any case, it was just that there was a penalty clause in the contract if he did,"" he told Canal Plus. ""Effectively the rules of the competition are established by UEFA and the statement from the committee was a warning that there would be a violation in the case that the player wasn't allowed to play freely."" Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay later insisted there was no dispute. ""The loan was arranged at the start of the season. He could play against Chelsea - that was never in doubt,"" he told Sky News. Courtois has been a key player as Atletico progressed to the semi-finals of the competition for the first time in 40 years by knocking out Barcelona with a 1-0 win in their quarter-final, second leg on Wednesday to seal a 2-1 on aggregate victory. However, Atletico president Enrique Cerezo had told Spanish radio station Onda Cero after that match that his side would have to pay ""a lot of money"" for Courtois to face Chelsea due to a provision in his contract, estimated in the Spanish media be three million euros ($4.17 million) per match. Courtois has already faced Chelsea once as an Atletico player in the European Supercup last season as the Spaniards ran out 4-1 victors."
639,11/04/2014,14:05,"Football: Madrid no pushovers for Bayern, warns Ancelotti",Carlo Ancelotti believes Real Madrid's pairing with Bayern Munich in the Champions League semi-finals represents just as much a challenge for the German champions as it does for his side.,"Bayern are trying to become the first team in the Champions League era to retain the trophy and also eliminated Madrid at the same stage in 2012 on penalties after a 3-3 draw on aggregate. ""I think Bayern Munich are a great team. They have individual and collective quality and have had a great season,"" Ancelotti said on Friday. ""Pep Guardiola is one of the best coaches in the world and has experience. It is a very difficult tie for us, but also for Bayern Munich. I don't think it is easy to play against Real Madrid. ""At this stage of the competition when you get to the semi-finals all the teams are good. Bayern Munich could be the favourites, but our objective is to win the Champions League and if we want to win it we have to beat Bayern Munich."" Ancelotti also played down the importance of having to travel to Munich for the second leg. However, of more pressing concern for the Italian is the fitness of World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese has missed Real's last two games due to injury and is expected to also be ruled out of the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona on Wednesday due to a hamstring problem. Ancelotti confirmed Ronaldo will be sidelined for Saturday's La Liga game at home to Almeria, but is hopeful the competition's top scorer this season with 14 goals will be fit to face Bayern in the first leg at the Santiago Bernabeu on April 23. ""Cristiano is not available for tomorrow. He had a small injury against Dortmund and we thought it best to leave him out and let him have more treatment. ""We don't know if he will be fit for the game on Wednesday. I think he will recover quickly, but it is clear that if we are not going to take risks and if he is not 100 percent then he will not play in the final."" The draw does leave alive the potential for a Madrid derby in the Champions League final as Atletico Madrid were paired with Chelsea in the other semi-final. Atletico were handed a boost just hours before the draw as UEFA released a statement stressing that goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois would be allowed to play against his parent club Chelsea despite an agreement between the clubs that would have forced Atletico a reported three million euros ($4.17 million) per match to field the Belgian international. However, former Chelsea midfielder Tiago Mendes insisted that the 2012 European champions remain the favourites to make the final despite Atletico's heroic efforts in eliminating Barcelona in the quarter-finals. ""Chelsea are the favourites. They have a great team and a great coach,"" he said. ""They are used to playing finals and winning titles. It will be difficult, but we have a great desire to get to the final."""
640,09/04/2014,22:42,Football: Five facts on Atletico Madrid,Five facts on Atletico Madrid after they beat Spanish rivals Barcelona to reach the Champions League semi-finals:,"-- Atletico Madrid are coming out of four decades in the football wilderness. They have reached the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since 1974. -- They join Real Madrid in Friday's draw and if pitted against each other it will be a repeat of the 1959 European Cup semi-final. Real needed a replay to win then with the legendary Alfredo di Stefano and Ferenc Puskas scoring in the 2-1 win. -- Koke, scorer of Atletico's first goal against Barcelona, joined the club at the age of eight and made his debut when just 17 in a 5-2 hammering at Barcelona. Barcelona's Xavi said ahead of the quarter final that Koke would replace him in Spain's national team. -- Former Argentine international and Atletico player Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011 when Atletico were just four points above the relegation zone. In his first year in charge, the side won the Europa League, European Supercup and Copa del Rey. -- Atletico Madrid are battling back from tackling a debt mountain. in 2013 they had to sell striker Radamel Falcao to Monaco for 60 million euros ($83 million) when their debt was officially estimated at 170 million euros but some experts said it was up to 300 million euros."
641,09/04/2014,22:41,Football: Atletico Madrid beat Barcelona to reach last four,Atletico Madrid reached the semi-finals of the Champions League for the first time since 1974 on Wednesday as they beat Barcelona 1-0 in their quarter-final second leg clash to progress 2-1 on aggregate.,"Atletico -- who last beat Barcelona four years ago -- got the only goal of the game through Koke, his first in this season's tournament, in the fifth minute. Barcelona rarely threatened to level and star player Lionel Messi had an especially torrid night as he failed to score against Atletico for the sixth successive game. Reaching the semi-finals will see Atletico join city rivals Real, only the fourth time clubs from the same city have reached the last four -- Real and Atletico having done so in 1959, AC Milan and Inter Milan in 2003 and Arsenal and Chelsea in 2009."

644,06/04/2014,02:30,"Football: Tiredness an issue for Barca, Atletico",Barcelona and Atletico Madrid bosses Gerardo Martino and Diego Simeone believed their sides struggled physically as they laboured to victories over and Real Betis and Villarreal respectively on Saturday.,"Atletico remain a point clear of the Catalans with six games to go in La Liga, but it was their Champions League quarter-final clash that occupied the minds of both coaches as the sides meet on Wednesday at the Vicente Calderon for the second leg after a 1-1 draw at the Camp Nou on Tuesday. Martino admitted Barca hadn't matched their standards of late as two goals from Lionel Messi and Jordi Figueras own goal was enough to see them past bottom of the table Betis 3-1. ""I expected that the game wouldn't have the same level of play as the other day against Atletico. Tuesday took a lot out of us. I saw a bit of the Atletico game and the same happened to them,"" he said. ""Today, as an exception, we value the result above everything. It wasn't due to concentration or underestimating the opponent, Betis played very well. At some points our work rate dropped a bit because we were lacking a bit physically. ""I hope that on Wednesday we will be better than today. I don't want to make excuses, but between Tuesday and next Wednesday appears the Betis game and it is normal that this happens. ""Normally the result isn't so favourable and this time it is, so we value it a lot as it allows us to continue putting pressure on the leaders."" It was a similar story for Atletico as Raul Garcia's early header was enough to squeeze out a third straight 1-0 home league win. ""Today was a difficult game. We played better in the first-half, but we didn't find space in between the lines like we wanted and scored through a set-piece,"" said Simeone. ""In the second-half Villarreal were superior in terms of possession. They didn't have many chances at goal, but we also couldn't create anything on the counter-attack. It is a very important victory that we will value a lot. ""We were tired towards the end and that is normal. The strength and energy that we have had at other times we didn't have today, but the team played with their head and when you play intelligently it can supplement that lack of energy. ""Now we need to think about the game in the Champions League, it is important for the club. It will be a great match. Hopefully we can recover in these four days."" It was a much more comfortable evening for Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti as despite being without Cristiano Ronaldo his side cruised to a 4-0 win away to Real Sociedad to remain three points off the top. Real were also in Champions League action in midweek as they beat Borussia Dortmund 3-0, but, in stark contrast to Atletico and Barca, they got stronger as the game went on as Gareth Bale, Pepe and Alvaro Morata scored in the final 25 minutes after Asier Illarramendi had opened the scoring just before half-time. ""It is not easy to recover after a game like Wednesday and in that aspect the intensity of the players in the second-half was very good,"" said Ancelotti. ""We have the desire to fight until the last game. Despite the fact we are behind in the table, we will fight until the end."""

647,02/04/2014,17:29,Football: Five problems a transfer ban causes Barcelona,"Spanish giants Barcelona were hit by a one-year transfer ban from football's governing body FIFA on Wednesday for ""serious"" breaches of rules in acquiring under-age players.","Here, AFP sports looks at what problems the Catalans could face should the sanction be upheld. - Can't replace Valdes or Puyol This summer's transfer window was already set to the be the most important in Barca's recent history as captain Carles Puyol and veteran goalkeeper Victor Valdes have indicated their intention to leave the club in June. Twenty-one-year-old German international 'keeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen was on the verge of completing his move from Borussia Monchengladbach to replace Valdes with another three signings planned to boost the depth of the squad ahead of next season. Barca are already very short of options at centre-back and the inability to find a successor to Puyol will put enormous pressure on the club's vaunted La Masia academy. - Another blow to the club's battered reputation Just a few years ago Barcelona enjoyed worldwide acclaim for their ""more than a club"" motto as they had UNICEF rather than a commercial sponsor on their shirts and produced one of the best teams the world has ever seen under Pep Guardiola largely with players from La Masia. However, Guardiola's departure has coincided with a commercial sponsorship agreement with Qatar Airways and the controversial signing of Brazilian star Neymar which led to Sandro Rosell resigning as the club's president and Barca being charged with tax fraud. - Camp Nou referendum up in the air The news comes at the worst possible time for Barca's embattled board, led by new president Josep Maria Bartomeu as their proposal for a 600 million euro ($827 million) refurbishment of the Camp Nou will go to a vote of the club's members on Saturday. It was already expected that the referendum could allow the Barca support to voice their displeasure at the board who refused to call new presidential elections despite Rosell's resignation in January. - Huge distraction at most important time of the season FIFA's bombshell fell barely 12 hours after Barca had drawn at home to Atletico Madrid in the first-leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday. Gerardo Martino's men also trail leaders Atletico by just a point with seven games to go in La Liga and face Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey final on April 16. The players and coaching staff must once again block out negative news off the field to concentrate on their fight for titles on three fronts. - Could rob La Masia of future talent Whilst the majority of those who graduate from Barca's academy come from the local Catalan region, Barca have never been adverse to acquiring talent from outwith Spain at a very young age. Most famously of all, four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi left his native Argentine to join Barca aged 13. FIFA's clampdown may scare off Barca's future attempts to discover a new Messi."
648,02/04/2014,00:34,"Football: Barca, Atletico bosses content despite drawing once more",Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino believes his side did everything in their power to break down a dogged Atletico Madrid as they were held 1-1 at the Camp Nou in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday.,"Diego Ribas had put Atletico in front with a wonder strike 11 minutes into the second-half, but Barcelona responded 19 minutes from time when Neymar swept home Andres Iniesta's sublime through ball. That goal ensured the sides drew for the fourth time in as many encounters this season, but Martino was happier with his side's display than in their three previous meetings with Atletico. ""Apart from the individual performances that we can talk about, the overall display of the team leaves me very calm. Against possibly the best counter-attacking team in Spain, if not Europe, we gave up two chances in the first-half and a goal from 30 metres. ""We created three or four good chances ourselves, which is a lot against this Atletico team. I love managing a team that always tries to play in this manner. ""When the team has played badly in the past I have said so, but tonight it is fair to say that the team played very well."" Both sides suffered injury blows as Barca's Gerard Pique will be sidelined for four weeks due to a hairline fracture in his right hip, whilst Atletico's top scorer Diego Costa looks set to miss the return leg too due to a hamstring injury. Twenty-three year-old central defender Marc Bartra was forced into action after just 10 minutes by Pique's injury, but Martino has every confidence that the youngster can deputise ably for the experienced Pique in the coming weeks. ""In these situations you need to be able to count on everyone. Unfortunately, these things happen but Bartra played very well. ""I was not surprised by his performance, although to be able to come on as he did after just 10 minutes and adjust to the game straight away was very impressive."" Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone, meanwhile, lauded the effort of his side's players as they desperately held on in the final 20 minutes after Neymar had brought Barca level. ""I am very happy. The team worked as a group and showed enormous heart. I go through the same feelings and emotions as an Atletico fan and I know the fans can be immensely proud of the effort the team put in tonight."" Simeone refused to elaborate on how long Costa may be sidelined for, but he praised the contribution made by Diego as replaced the Spanish international after half an hour and made his mark in spectacular style with a wonderful opening goal. ""I am very happy for him because he has worked away in the background very quietly waiting for his opportunity. ""The team needs him and he needs the team, but tonight he played a complete game."" However, the Argentine coach refused to say his side now had the upper hand as they take an away goal back to the Vicente Calderon for the return next Wednesday, April 9. ""I loved the game. There were two teams with very different styles playing in their own way to break the other. ""We know it will be an extremely tough game again against a team with enormous talent. ""We have to recover well, play on Saturday and then prepare for the second-leg on Wednesday."""
649,31/03/2014,19:37,"Football: Atletico the Robin Hood of Spain, claims Tiago",Atletico Madrid midfielder Tiago Mendes has compared his side's ability to compete with the far richer Barcelona and Real Madrid this season to the tale of Robin Hood.,"Atletico face Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final at the Camp Nou on Tuesday and also lead La Liga ahead of the two traditional giants of Spanish football with just seven games remaining. Diego Simeone's men have overcome the odds despite having an annual budget of almost 400 million euros ($550 million) less than Barca and Real and Tiago believes people in crisis-hit Spain can associate with the hard work that has taken Atletico to the top. ""I think that we have our own identity. It is very easy for people to identify with us, also because in society we are living through a period of crisis and we are fighting in the Champions League with a much lower budget,"" he said at his side's pre-match press conference on Monday. ""That is where the similarity between Robin Hood and our team comes from."" Atletico have already faced Barca three times this season, twice in the Spanish Supercup and once in La Liga at the Vicente Calderon back in January. All three encounters ended in draws, however four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi's involvement in two of those games was limited by injury and Simeone is expecting to face a much stronger Barca side at the Camp Nou this time around. ""Tomorrow will be the most difficult for sure. In the first game in the Supercup we played at home and then they weren't as strong as they are now. ""In the game in La Liga (Lionel) Messi also wasn't at 100 percent. We are going to compete against the best Barcelona side we have faced this season. ""Tomorrow Barcelona will want to finish the tie off and we need to stop them in whatever way we can."" Since making his return from two months out due to a hamstring injury just before the latest clash at the Calderon, Messi has hit top form, scoring nine times in his last five games in all competitions. The Argentine has now struck 36 times in as many games this season, but Atletico's Diego Costa is only three behind Messi with 33 goals so far this campaign. And Simeone believes his star man is just as important to Atletico as Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are to Barca and Real Madrid respectively. ""Without doubt (he is just as important). Just like Ronaldo is for Real Madrid or Messi for Barcelona, Diego Costa is for us. Each one has his own style, but they are all fundamental to their teams. ""Tomorrow two players in amazing form will face off. Messi has shown that he has had a good rest in those two months that he didn't play and that is good for us Argentines ahead of the World Cup,"" he said with a wry smile. Midfielder Raul Garcia is the only major absence from Simeone's squad as he is suspended so David Villa could come in to start against his former club."

Victory brought Martino's men back into the title race as they now trail leaders Atletico Madrid and Real by just one point with nine games remaining. However, the Argentine warned that his side can suffer no slip-ups of the kind they have suffered at Real Sociedad and Valladolid in recent weeks if they are to retain their title, starting with Celta Vigo's visit to the Camp Nou on Wednesday. ""Last weekend has allowed us to get back in the league. Now we have to continue playing well against Celta and what remains of the league season. We cannot make a mistakes,"" he said on Tuesday. ""Our wish is to perform at a high level and to have similar individual performances to those we had on Sunday. ""The competitions are entering their final stage and if we don't maintain that level it will endanger our chances of winning any titles. ""Generally, we need to be consistent. That is why we are not in a different position today, above all in the league. If we had maintained consistency in our performances and results, we would be in a much better position."" Martino has left Xavi out of his 18-man squad for the game against Celta with the Catalan derby away to Espanyol and a return to Champions League action against Atletico Madrid next week in mind. Pedro Rodriguez, Alexis Sanchez and Marc Bartra are also likely to feature after being left on the bench at the Bernabeu."
653,25/03/2014,02:15,Football: PSG ready for acid test of European ambitions,"When Qatar Sports Investments bought Paris Saint-Germain in 2011, they gave themselves five years to win the Champions League, but hopes are high in the French capital that they could get there ahead of schedule.","Having matched last season's achievement of reaching the quarter-finals of Europe's leading club competition, PSG are now preparing to face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea in this year's last eight next month. It will be the first true test of Laurent Blanc's side, who have not been suitably challenged domestically and have cruised through to this stage in Europe without having to play any of the continent's biggest names. PSG have lost just one league game since March last year and last Friday's 1-0 victory at Lorient allowed them to make it a club record eight wins on the bounce in all competitions. Under Blanc, they are 10 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 and are almost certain to retain the title won last year under Carlo Ancelotti. They have scored 70 goals in 30 league matches and Zlatan Ibrahimovic alone has 40 in all competitions, breaking the club record for the most goals in one campaign. But they are only doing what their enormous budget means they should be doing. In France, no other club can really compete financially -- not even Monaco -- and that gulf has translated onto the field. Two draws in two games against Monaco and a draw at home to third-placed Lille before Christmas suggest that it has not been a cakewalk, but even Blanc himself says that their domestic league is not enough of a challenge to prepare them for the pressures of Europe. Even there they have not been presented with a true test of their credentials, having cruised through a group containing the modest trio of Olympiakos, Benfica and Anderlecht before brushing aside a struggling Bayer Leverkusen. No wonder sports daily L'Equipe's front page headline asked if PSG were 'Ready For The Big Step Up' prior to the draw being made last Friday, and Chelsea will be just that. Possession is king for PSG, with Thiago Motta, Marco Verratti and Yohan Cabaye all available to Blanc in midfield, but Mourinho's side will be happy for their opponents to have the ball. Chelsea will also ask serious questions of a defence that has looked vulnerable at times in Europe this season - goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu was PSG's best player in the second leg against Leverkusen, and a fractured cheekbone suffered by captain Thiago Silva against Lorient is a cause for alarm. Silva and Ibrahimovic are the biggest influences in this PSG side and, at the age of 32, the latter is personally driven by the desire to win the biggest prize of all in club football having fallen short so many times before. In France, observers are confident of PSG's credentials, with 60 percent of those responding to a L'Equipe poll saying that Blanc's side would beat Chelsea, while Mourinho himself tried to claim at the weekend that PSG against his side. The financial incentive is certainly there for PSG, with the club's mega-rich owners offering a bonus of 1 million euros (£833,000, $1.38m) per player if they can win the trophy this year. But that might prove a step too far. After all, this season's quarter-final line-up is the strongest in recent memory, with all eight clubs advancing having won their groups. Six of the eight quarter-finalists have won the European Cup 23 times between them. Atletico Madrid have at least been to the final. ""There are teams who have a legitimacy in the Champions League in terms of experience that we don't have, but I think the consideration that our opponents have for us has increased,"" said Blanc recently, although PSG need only look to Chelsea if they doubt that patience might still be required even when throwing enormous of money chasing the dream. A decade ago, the London club were themselves new to this level and they reached the last eight or further seven times in 12 seasons before finally winning the trophy in 2012."
654,21/03/2014,11:15,Football: Chelsea's Torres hints at Atletico return,Chelsea striker Fernando Torres has potentially opened the door on a return to Atletico Madrid after expressing an interest in working under former team-mate Diego Simeone.,"""In football, you never know,"" he told the Friday editions of several British newspapers. ""You don't know where you are going to be tomorrow, in a week's time, or in 10 years' time. ""I've had a lot of admiration for 'Cholo' (Simeone), ever since we were team-mates. He taught me a lot in the seasons we played together at Atleti."" Torres, 30, has failed to impress since joining Chelsea from Liverpool for a British-record fee of £50 million in January 2011, scoring only 44 times in 161 appearances. His status was further undermined recently when manager Jose Mourinho was shown on French television complaining that Chelsea ""lack a scorer"" during a conversation recorded without his knowledge. Simeone is enjoying a fine season with Atletico, who are challenging for the Spanish title and have reached the Champions League quarter-finals, and Torres says that he would be intrigued to work with him. ""I always want to work with people I admire,"" added Torres, who left Atletico to join Liverpool in 2007. ""I admired Rafa Benitez from the outside and I had the chance to work with him (at Liverpool and Chelsea). The same goes for Jose Mourinho or (former Atletico and Spain coach) Luis Aragones. ""Simeone is like Pep Guardiola or like other coaches who you'd like to go and see how they coach and learn."""

658,12/03/2014,11:32,Football: Atletico savour return to Europe's elite,Atletico Madrid on Wednesday savoured their rise from the ashes under the guidance of Diego Simeone after thrashing seven-time European champions AC Milan.,"""Greats of Europe"" said the Marca sports daily after Atletico hammered Milan 4-1 on Tuesday night -- with two goals from new hero Diego Costa -- to ensure a 5-1 aggregate win and a Champions League quarter-final place for the first time since Simeone played for the club in 1997. When the Argentine arrived back in the Spanish capital in December 2011, Atletico were an underachieving mid-table side burdened by a huge debt. In his first 17 months in charge Simeone delivered Europa League, European Supercup and Copa del Rey titles. Despite having to sell Radamel Falcao to Monaco last year for 60 million euros ($83 million) to balance the books, this season Atletico have become serious challengers to perpetual Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona as well as the rest of Europe. With just 11 games to go in La Liga, Atletico are in front of Barcelona and just three points adrift of leaders Real. They have now won seven and drawn one of their eight Champions League games on their return to the competition for the first time in four years. Simeone insisted his side will remain ""humble"" whoever they are paired with in the last eight. But for a club that has in the past excelled in shooting itself in the foot, he has created an extraordinary belief among players and fans alike. ""We have not been in this competition for a few years and we were desperate to make an impression,"" said Raul Garcia, who scored Atletico's third goal on Tuesday. ""That is what we are doing day by day and we will see how far we can go."" The Calderon crowd could certainly play a big part if the Atletico bandwagon is to roll into the semi-finals. Nearly 50,000 were crammed in the stadium waving red and white flags and drowning out the Champions League music as the teams emerged with a chorus of the club's anthem. ""The fans were incredible,"" said Simeone. ""Things went how we and they wanted them to. ""When we walked out onto the field and saw all the flags, we had the chance to savour an extraordinary football moment."" The star of the show from then on was Diego Costa as the new Spanish international continued his claim to be Vicente del Bosque's primary striking option at the World Cup by scoring twice to take his tally for the campaign to 29 goals in all competitions. Costa's rise to prominence has mirrored that of his team. The Brazilian-born striker spent the first six months of Simeone's reign on-loan at relegation threaten Rayo Vallecano, one of four loan spells he was farmed out on before returning to strike up a deadly partnership with Falcao last season. In the Colombian's absence he has moved up another level, becoming the focal point of the team with his aggressive style of play that symbolises Atletico's approach as a group. ""He can still improve. He has great physical and psychological strength and I am sure there is still plenty more to come from him,"" insisted Simeone. ""His participation with the Spanish national team will help him improve because they have a different style of play and he adapts well to any style. ""He is destined for great things and everything that happens to him is thanks to his humility. No one has gifted him anything, he has done it himself and everything he does has its base in his work rate and desire."""
659,12/03/2014,00:26,Football: Simeone open to all Spanish quarter-final,Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone welcomed the possibility of meeting La Liga rivals Real Madrid or Barcelona in the quarter-finals of the Champions League after his side thrashed AC Milan 4-1 in the second leg of their last 16 tie on Wednesday to progress 5-1 on aggregate.,"It is the first time since Simeone was an Atletico player back in 1997 that Los Rojiblancos have reached the last eight of the Champions League and the Argentine insists they must enjoy the experience no matter who they are paired with. ""We will wait until the opponent comes out of the hat. It doesn't bother me at all if it is a Spanish team. ""We will continue with humility as we always do and you can't choose who you play. All we can do is relax and recuperate."" Already leading 1-0 from the first leg three weeks ago, Atletico made a fast start and went in front on three minutes through an acrobatic effort from Diego Costa. Kaka's headed equaliser 24 minutes later briefly gave Milan hope of a comeback, but Arda Turan's deflected effort restored Atletico's lead before half-time. And goals in the final 20 minutes from Raul Garcia and Costa once more rounded off a glorious evening for the hosts. ""We started better and it seemed like the tie was well on track, but then they grew into the game. We weren't getting to them on the wings and it complicated things for us. ""It was not so much the second goal, but the third goal that allowed us to relax because it was then very difficult to come back in the tie."" Milan boss Clarence Seedorf congratulated Atletico on a deserved win over the two legs, but lamented his side's luck as Arda's deflected goal came when they were having a good spell. ""Congratulations to Atletico, they deserved this victory, especially in the second-half. ""We lost control of the game. Their second goal arrived when we were having our best spell in the game, but that is football."" Seedorf has only been in charge of the seven-time European champions since January as he replaced the sacked Massimiliano Allegri. The Rossoneri's season is now effectively over as they lie 11th in Serie A, nine points off the European places. And the former Dutch international admitted he now has to build the side with an eye to returning Milan to their former glory next season. ""I arrived to help and improve the situation. Next season we will build something new and better. This year everything started badly and now we are trying to fill the holes. ""There will be a natural change in the side. We still have 11 games left and we need to get as many points as possible to finish the season with dignity."""
660,08/03/2014,21:54,"Football: Barcelona suffer shock defeat, Atletico go top",Barcelona slumped to their third defeat in seven league games as they lost away to relegation-threatened Valladolid 1-0 on Saturday.,"Italian Fausto Rossi scored the only goal of the game as he slammed home from close range after 17 minutes. Atletico Madrid took advantage of Barca's slip up to move top of the table thanks to their better head-to-head record against Real Madrid as a double from David Villa handed them a 2-0 win over Celta Vigo at Balaidos. However, Real can retake their place at the top and move four points clear of Barcelona with victory over Levante at home on Sunday. Victory for Valladolid had significant consequences at the other end of the table as La Pucela moved out of the relegation zone with just their fifth league win of the campaign. ""What we lacked today is normally what distinguishes the team; our circulation of the ball and our movement off the ball to find space. As a consequence of that we lacked penetration,"" Barca boss Gerardo Martino admitted. ""We lacked ideas, movement and penetration, but I didn't in any way see a lack of attitude."" Defeat means the Spanish champions will likely have to beat Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu in two weeks time to have any chance of retaining the title. And with his side's Champions League last 16, second leg with Manchester City just four days away, Martino admitted his side are a long way off their best form. ""It is clear that right now we are not in our best form and we need to be to be able to beat Real Madrid. There are still 15 days to go until that match for us to find ourselves. Right now we have the Champions League to worry about. ""Today we didn't play well, just like we didn't play well in the game straight after the Manchester City game, in San Sebastian (a defeat to Real Sociedad). We will try to make sure it is the reverse on Wednesday."" Despite the majority of his squad having been away on international duty in midweek, Martino named almost his strongest starting line-up with only Jordi Alba and Andres Iniesta missing out. However, after lionel Messi had forced goalkeeper Diego Marino into an early save at the end of a swift counter-attack, it was Valladolid who had the upper hand in the opening half hour. Rossi opened the scoring with his first goal for Valladolid as he took advantage of a ricochet off two Barca defenders inside the area to fire past Victor Valdes. Barca reacted as the first-half drew to a close and Marino had to be alive to deny Messi twice from range before Cesc Fabregas also tested the keeper with a drive from the edge of the box. Marino made another good save just three minutes after the restart as the Argentine squeezed a shot towards goal with his weaker right foot from a narrow angle. Barca's best opening dropped at the feet of Neymar as he was brilliantly played in by Fabregas, but he blasted over from close range. Atletico, meanwhile, recovered from their own travel sickness as they put two consecutive away league defeats behind them in Vigo. After a first-half short on clear-cut opportunities, Villa pounced on a defensive error from Jonathan Castro to fire low past Yoel Rodriguez just after the hour mark.

662,04/03/2014,02:15,"Football: Costa debuts as Spain, Italy finalise World Cup preparations",Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa is set to make his long-awaited debut for Spain when the world champions host Italy on Wednesday in their final match before both sides name their squads for the World Cup.,"Ironically Costa also made his debut for the country of his birth, Brazil, against the Azzurri just over a year ago. However, he has since switched allegiance to his adopted country and having missed friendlies against Equatorial Guinea and South Africa in November due to injury, will get his first taste of action for Spain at his club ground of the Vicente Calderon. The 25-year-old is expected to rival Manchester City's Alvaro Negredo for the lone striker's role in Brazil later this year as coach Vicente Del Bosque has left out his previously preferred pairing of David Villa and Fernando Torres from his 22-man squad. Gerard Pique is Spain's only big name absentee through injury so Sergio Ramos will be partnered in central defence by either Javi Martinez or Raul Albiol, and Ramos said the game will take on extra significance with the World Cup just three months away. ""It will be a nice game because Italy is one of the biggest teams in the world. They have always had the utmost respect from the Spanish national team, so I am sure the fans will enjoy it,"" he said. ""The World Cup will be here before we know it, so the players and fans are more motivated."" Del Bosque has yet to confirm who will be his first-choice goalkeeper in Brazil. Captain Iker Casillas remains the favourite despite not playing in La Liga with Real Madrid as he has been in fine form in the Copa del Rey and Champions League. ""I hope to play against Italy. To be in the national team is very important for me and I am grateful for the confidence the coach has shown in me,"" Casillas told Spanish radio station MelodiaFM. Del Bosque has often used two goalkeepers in friendly matches, though, so Barcelona's Victor Valdes could also be involved. Chelsea's Cesar Azpilicueta and in-form Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara are also expected to get the chance to further their claims for a place in Del Bosque's World Cup squad. Italy will be out to avenge recent defeats to La Roja in the Euro 2012 final and on penalties in last year's Confederations Cup semi-final. However, they are more affected by injuries and disciplinary issues as Mario Balotelli missed out on Cesare Prandelli's 26-man squad due to a shoulder problem. Roma's Daniele de Rossi was also left out due to Prandelli's code of conduct after punching Inter Milan's Mauro Icardi during their 0-0 draw on Saturday. Giorgio Chiellini has been called up despite missing the last three weeks due to injury, drawing the ire of Juventus boss Antonio Conte who criticised Prandelli's decision to include the defender after his side's 2-0 win over AC Milan on Sunday. Paris Saint Germain midfielder Marco Verratti returns to the squad for the first time in a year, whilst Torino forward Ciro Immobile and Parma defender Gabriel Paletta could make their debuts."
663,03/03/2014,02:04,Football: Spanish confidence quietly building for title defence,Spain will start the defence of the World Cup they won for the first time in 2010 as they ended in South Africa by facing th Netherlands in Salvador on June 13.,"Whilst not as decisive as when the two sides met in the final four years ago, the presence of a highly-rated Chile side alongside Australia as their opponents in Group B, allied to the prospect of a last 16 clash against Brazil for the side that finishes second in group, make it imperative for the holders to get off to a good start. When the draw took place in December there was an initial air of pessimism around Spain's chances to continue their historic run of winning three major championships in succession. A 3-0 beating handed down by Brazil in the Confederations Cup final last year was still fresh in the memory as Spain plodded through qualification, scoring just 14 times in eight games. However, as winter turns to spring there is a growing sensation that there could yet be enough left in La Roja's golden generation to become the first side to retain the trophy since Brazil in 1962. The principal issues that plagued Vicente del Bosque's side during 2013 for now appear to have worked themselves out. Firstly, any doubts surrounding captain Iker Casillas' position as first-choice goalkeeper have been eased as despite not playing in La Liga he went nine games and over 950 minutes without conceding in the Copa del Rey and Champions League until he was finally beaten by Klass-Jan Huntelaar's spectacular consolation volley as Real Madrid thrashed Schalke 6-1 last week. The lack of form and fitness shown by the heroes of previous triumphs in David Villa and Fernando Torres have been compensated by Diego Costa's switch of allegiance from Brazil to his adopted land, whilst Alvaro Negredo's stunning start to life with Manchester City has also made him a strong candidate to lead the line come the summer. Between them Costa and Negredo have notched 50 goals this season and should add a directness and physical presence to Spain's play that was missing even in winning the European Championships with Cesc Fabregas as a false nine in 2012. Costa has yet to make his debut for Spain, but was included by Del Bosque in a 22-man squad for Wednesday's friendly at home to Italy. The absence of Torres, Villa and other World Cup winners in Juan Mata and Fernando Llorente from that squad underlined the depth of talent still on offer to Del Bosque. Barcelona continue to be the most represented club amongst Del Bosque's latest squad with seven of the 22 coming from the Spanish champions. And Barca boss Gerardo Martino's rotation policy could also prove beneficial to Spain come June and July. Martino has insisted on limiting the likes of Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta's minutes to ensure there is no repeat of the 7-0 aggregate thrashing a jaded Barca suffered at the hands of Bayern Munich in last season's Champions League semi-finals. In Iniesta's case in particular the rest accumulated appears to have worked as he has hit his best form in recent weeks as Barca's bid for trophies on three fronts reaches a decisive stage. Finally, the performance of the Spanish sides in Europe has also stoked confidence. Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid all won away from home in the first legs of their Champions League last 16 ties and whilst their progression in the competition will mean more games for a number of key players, it also demonstrates that Spain's best remain difficult to knock off their perch."
664,02/03/2014,19:05,Football: Ronaldo salvages Real point from Madrid derby,Cristiano Ronaldo equalised eight minutes from time as Real Madrid remained on top of La Liga thanks to a pulsating 2-2 draw against Atletico Madrid at the Vicente Calderon.,"Karim Benzema had fired Real into a third minute lead when he converted Angel di Maria's cross. However, despite being denied a clear penalty when Sergio Ramos tripped Diego Costa, Atletico were in front by half-time thanks to fine strikes by Koke and Gabi. Another turned down penalty appeal for a foul on Costa led Atletico assistant boss Mono Burgos to be sent to the stand as he tried to confront the referee midway through the second-half. And Atletico were left to feel hard done when Ronaldo spun on the edge of the box to drill home a late equaliser. A point for both sides means Real remain three points clear of Atletico, but Barcelona can move to within a point of Los Blancos should they beat Almeria later on Sunday. Carlo Ancelotti's men came into the game full of confidence after thrashing Schalke 6-1 on their return to Champions League action in midweek and took just three minutes to open the scoring. A short corner from the right was worked back to Angel di Maria and his in-swinging cross was slotted home at the back post by Benzema. The home fans and players were left incensed seven minutes later when Costa was tripped inside the area by Ramos, but referee Carlos Delgado Ferreiro waved away claims for a penalty. Some of the Atletico players took their protests too far, though, as Arda Turan appeared to push Ferreiro and was lucky to only receive a yellow card. That decision added fire to an already intense atmosphere inside the Calderon and the home support inspired Atletico as they went on to dominate the majority of the first-half. However, Atletico were thankful to Thibaut Courtois for preventing the visitors from doubling their lead twice in quick succession as he saved from Benzema and a near post backheel from Ronaldo. Atletico were level on 27 minutes when fine work from Turan teed up Koke inside the area and he smashed a low right-footed drive into the far corner. Diego Lopez then had to be quick off his line to prevent Costa from a narrow angle moments later. But the hosts did go in front in spectacular fashion in stoppage time at the end of the half when Gabi collected a short free-kick and fired high into Lopez's top right-hand corner from 35 yards. Costa had a great chance to make it 3-1 seven minutes after the restart as he raced past Pepe to a long ball over the Real defence, but his weak shot squirmed wide of the target. At the other end Benzema was inches away from his second of the afternoon when he volleyed Modric's cross wide. More controversy was to ensure, though, as Costa appeared to bundled over inside the area, this time by Alvaro Arbeloa, but again Ferreiro didn't point to the spot and instead booked Costa for diving. That led to Burgos having to be visibly restrained from confronting the referee by Atletico players and officials as he was sent to the stands for protesting. The drama continued as seconds later Courtois had to be alert to parry Gareth Bale's flicked header. Ronaldo should have levelled 16 minutes from time when he headed wide when unmarked from Dani Carvajal's cross. However, the Portuguese made amends eight minutes later when he fired home a loose ball from the edge of the area to give Real a share of the spoils."

However, Courtois has consistently stated that he will not go back to Jose Mourinho's side unless he is guaranteed first team football and with Petr Cech enjoying a return to his best form this season, Courtois would be open to another year in the Spanish capital. ""My agent handles that and tells me what is important. Atletico want me to stay and Chelsea to return. We need to see where I feel best, although I am still not sure and therefore have not taken a decision,"" he told Spanish sports daily AS. Rumours in Spain have also suggested that Real Madrid could hijack any attempt by Atletico to sign the player on a permanent basis. However, with Atletico and Real set to face each other in a crucial match in the La Liga title race on Sunday, Courtois played down suggestions he could be playing anywhere other than Atletico or Chelsea next season. ""I am concentrated on Atletico and I belong to Chelsea. If anyone in Europe wants to sign me they have to talk to Chelsea and then the English club will decide what to do. Everything has to go through them and if it doesn't then there is nothing to talk about. ""I have a contract with Atletico until June and then two more years with Chelsea. If any offer comes in, Chelsea have to decide if they want me to leave, but that is not the case. Right now Atletico and Chelsea are the only two teams for me."" Courtois has the unenviable task of stopping an on-form Real frontline of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema at the Vicente Calderon this weekend after they each scored twice in Real's 6-1 mauling of Schalke in the Champions League in midweek. However, he is confident that Atletico's more cautious approach could see them get the win they need to join Real on 63 points at the top of La Liga. ""We are different to Schalke. They were very open against Madrid. They left them a lot of space and Madrid have a lot of pace to take advantage of that. ""We know that it will be a very difficult game given the level at which they are currently playing. ""It will be a question of who defends best. We need to be concentrated and tight at the back to keep a clean sheet because we will have our chances going forward. It will be a great game and hopefully we can dedicate a win to our fans."""

668,20/02/2014,03:35,Football: Atletico tie not over: Seedorf,AC Milan coach Clarence Seedorf said the Italians' Champions League quarter-final bid is far from over despite suffering a 1-0 defeat to high-flying Atletico Madrid on Wednesday.,"Milan had kept Diego Simeone's side on a tight leash throughout a dramatic encounter at the San Siro but paid the price for hitting the woodwork three times in an enthralling first-half. As the Rossoneri tired, Atletico striker Diego Costa headed an 83rd minute winner just inside Christian Abbiati near post after defender Ignazio Abate had headed a corner towards the back post. Two weeks ahead of the second leg at the Vicente Calderon stadium, Diego Simeone's are now favourites to qualify for what would be their first quarter-final appearance since 1997. But Milan refuse to throw in the towel. Former Milan great Seedorf, in his first Champions League game as coach, applauded Milan's efforts and said the tie is not over yet. ""On the whole lads showed a lot of spirit and determination and I also saw some great individual performances,"" said the Dutchman, the only player to have won Europe's most prestigious club trophy with three different clubs -- Ajax, Real Madrid and twice with Milan. ""At the end we were tired and we perhaps paid for our efforts. It's a positive result for them but the tie is not over. I know the Vicente Calderon (stadium) well but the stadium also knows me."" Milan spurned three chances to score in the first half, the first on 15 minutes when Adel Taarabt's ball was put through for Kaka only for the Brazilian to send a curling left-footed strike off Thibaut Courtois's crossbar. Minutes later Taarabt's cross was met by Andrea Poli but Courtois performed heroics to palm the winger's precision header off the post. After Emiliano Insua saw yellow for a crunching tackle on Mattia De Sciglio which left the defender hobbling off to be replaced by Abate, a Balotelli backheel on the counter found Kaka, whose latest effort skimmed the bar on its way over. For Simeone, Atletico had a first half to forget. ""After a strong start we began suffering down the right and we weren't sharp enough coming out,"" said the former Inter, Lazio and Atletico defensive midfielder, who steered the Spaniards to Europa League victory in 2012. Simeone boosted his midfield for the second half and immediately began to look the stronger side. Shortly after the restart Costa was allowed space at the back post to attempt a bicycle kick when a cross was whipped but his effort was off target. Milan created few real chances, a Kaka drive going wide and striker Mario Balotelli being restricted to free kick attempts which came to nothing. Ghanaian Michael Essien sent a glancing header wide of Courtois's upright but Atletico clearly had the momentum. On 75 minutes, Costa held off his marker to set up Raul Garcia, whose drive from 20 metres was blocked down low by Abbiati. Seedorf replaced Balotelli with Pazzini on 77 minutes but by then a tiring Milan had little left to offer. The visitors pressed and, after a first-time Garcia effort had just missed the target, Costa struck to stun the hosts. Milan's last chance came from French defender Adil Rami, whose powerful freekick went a metre wide of the Atletico goal. Kaka had plenty of reason to bemoan his earlier misses but the Brazilian was defiant. ""We created plenty of chances so I don't want to talk about bad luck but it's clear that if we'd had put one of those chances away we'd be talking about a different game,"" said the Brazilian. ""It's not the result we wanted but now we have to turn our focus to the second leg and believe that we can come through it."""

673,11/02/2014,02:14,Football: Spotlight on Seedorf as Atletico approach,AC Milan coach Clarence Seedorf awoke to the reality of the real challenges facing his side and question marks over his approach just over a week before welcoming Atletico Madrid to the San Siro.,"Seedorf replaced Massimiliano Allegri in early January and after crashing out of the Italian Cup quarter-finals to Udinese, the Rossoneri's league form under the Dutchman has yet to fully convince. The former Milan midfielder steered his side to two successive wins and a draw to pull clear of the bottom half of the Serie A table and instill some belief that a revival was on. But the wake-up call came on Saturday when a clinical display by Rafael Benitez's Napoli exposed the task that awaits Milan if they are to snatch a top five finish and a place in the Europa League next season. Seedorf's arrival at one of Italy's iconic clubs prompted a media storm, as much for his popularity during his successful 10-year spell at the club as for the fact it is his first real coaching appointment. After being outclassed 3-1, his credentials faced a first grilling from the critics who have followed the steady decline of the seven-time European champions since a 2012 summer clear-out of top players, including the Dutchman. So far, the jury remains out with reports on Monday claiming the defeat to Napoli had irked club president and owner Silvio Berlusconi. Club CEO Adriano Galliani was quick to pour water on the embers when he told Sky Sport Italia: ""There has been no criticism from Berlusconi regarding the work of Seedorf."" -But a week before Atletico's visit for a Champions League last 16 clash that Milan will be desperately looking to win, Seedorf's choices for Saturday's game were widely questioned. Some reports hastened to question the decision to leave captain Riccardo Montolivo and Sulley Muntari, who are both suspended for the Atletico fixture, on the bench against such a strong side as Napoli. But he explained: ""Montolivo is in good shape... but we have to think about the games coming up and against Atletico we will be without Montolivo and Sulley Muntari so I have to test alternatives."" It meant Michael Essien made his debut, albeit an unremarkable one, alongside Nigel de Jong and Seedorf later admitted the Ghanaian, like many of his players, will require some time to adapt to his demands. There were also questions over central defenders Philippe Mexes, handed the captain's armband, and Adel Rami as well as an ineffective Mario Balotelli, who finished the match early and in tears. Milan's defence, notably Mexes, crumbled under a Napoli attack which produced a brace for Argentinian Gonzalo Higuain, while Balotelli was virtually inexistent and replaced by a far more motivated Giampaolo Pazzini on 73 minutes. Balotelli sat on the bench shedding tears that were later attributed to his emotional state only days after confirming paternity of a 14-month baby girl, Pia, born to model and former girlfriend Raffaella Fico. Seedorf will expect a more focused approach against Atletico, but in the meantime he stood behind the 23-year-old striker. ""I don't see what the fuss is about. It's a human reaction and it's not the first time it's happened to a player. It's also happened to me,"" he said. With next season's Champions League virtually beyond Milan -- Napoli are 18 points better off in third -- the only hope of qualifying is to win this year's competition. Atletico suffered only their second defeat of the season on Sunday and slipped to third place but have the same points, 57, as leaders Barcelona and second-placed Real Madrid. Seedorf, meanwhile, hinted he is only beginning a project that could take several years to complete. ""It will take a long time to get the team the way I want it. We have professional pride so our goal is to improve,"" he told media on Monday. ""We have to remain calm and determined to bring out the best from here to the end of the season. I am not worried. When I said that there was much work to be done I am not telling stories."""

The away draw leaves Real three points behind La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid, who moved to the top of the table with a 4-0 win over Real Sociedad earlier on Sunday. Ronaldo is now likely to be banned for another crucial league encounter against Villarreal next weekend and Ancelotti wasn't convinced his star man deserved to see red.

Brazilian defender Marcelo was stronger in his criticism of the decision. ""It is hard when you lose a player in an unjust manner.

""Athletic are a very good team, but we had bad luck today."" After withstanding some intense pressure from Athletic in the opening 45 minutes, Madrid looked set for an 11th consecutive victory in all competitions as Ronaldo's cross was turned home by Jese Rodriguez. However, a stunning strike from Ibai Gomez brought the hosts level before Ronaldo clashed with Gurpegi. Madrid then had Diego Lopez to thank for salvaging a point as the keeper tipped over another dipping effort from Gomez before denying Aritz Aduriz late on. ""The game was difficult for both teams,"" added Ancelotti. ""In the first-half Athletic pressed a lot and that made it difficult to play the ball on the ground so we played more on the counter-attack. ""In the second-half, the intensity of their pressure dropped a bit and we played better in possession, we scored and had good control of the game. ""Bilbao scored a fantastic goal, but in general I personally am satisfied with how Real Madrid played.""

679,01/02/2014,15:05,Football: Bale out of Madrid trip to Bilbao,Welsh winger Gareth Bale will miss a second consecutive game due to a calf injury as Real Madrid travel to fourth-placed Athletic Bilbao in a key La Liga clash on Sunday.,"Bale was substituted at half-time in last weekend's 2-0 win over Granada due to the problem and has been unable to train with his teammates all week. The 24-year-old has now missed a total of eight games to injury in four separate spells since joining from Tottenham Hotspur for a reported 91 million euros ($122.7million) back in September. However, Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti is confident he will be fit in time for the first leg of Real's Copa del Rey semi-final against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. ""He is not available for tomorrow because he hasn't trained all week with the group,"" Ancelotti told a press conference on Saturday. ""Tomorrow he will train and he will be available for Wednesday. He doesn't need another mini pre-season. The problem he had was very small, he just needs to train and gain confidence. ""His problems don't worry me. Before he had a knock and was out for 20 days, but when he came back he played well. Now he has a small problem, but it is not a serious injury."" Madrid enjoyed a perfect January as they racked up eight wins and eight clean sheets to move to within a point of Atletico Madrid and Barcelona at the top of La Liga, as well as progressing to the last four of the Cup. However, Ancelotti knows that facing an in-form Athletic team, who have scored 15 goals in their last three league games, will be a stiff test of his side's title credentials. ""It is a very good test looking at the table. They are a very strong team and they don't need to prove anything. ""We have a period of important games coming up. January was a good month and we have the ability to repeat what we did in them in February. What we did in January could allow us to have a very good next couple of months."" Jese Rodriguez, who scored the winner against Espanyol in a 1-0 win in midweek, is expected to keep his place in the absence of Bale.

680,01/02/2014,13:00,"Football: Aragones, the architect of Spain's golden era","One of the key figures in the creation of Spain's historic World Cup and double European Championship-winning team, Luis Aragones, died on Saturday at the age of 75.","Aragones was the Spain coach when La Seleccion ended a 44-year wait to win a major international tournament when they beat Germany to take the European Championship in 2008. Despite a public clamour for him to stay on at the time, Aragones stood by his pre-tournament decision to step aside. In his absence, Vicente del Bosque took over to lead the side to more glory at the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 before defending their European title in Poland and Ukraine two years later. ""Without doubt, he led the way in this extremely succesful era,"" Del Bosque told the RFEF website. ""It is a sad day for our football. We have lost a key man in the history of modern sport."" Aragones is credited with implementing the tiki-taka playing style of the Spanish side that has become world renowned. However, he also changed the mentality of a side that, while always talented, had been pegged as perennial underachievers. After a disappointing exit to France in the last 16 of the 2006 World Cup was followed by a shock defeat to Northern Ireland at the beginning of qualifying for the 2008 Euros, Aragones took the brave decision to drop Real Madrid's all-time leading scorer Raul from the squad. Released from under the shadow of a man who had been a national hero, Fernando Torres and David Villa led their country to glory in Austria and Switzerland as Villa finished as the competition's top scorer, while Torres netted the winner against Germany in the final. However, his time in charge of the national team was also blighted by an accusation of using racist language to describe French striker Thierry Henry in an attempt to motivate Henry's then Arsenal teammate Jose Antonio Reyes. Aragones protested his innocence, claiming his words had been misinterpreted, but he was fined 3,000 euros ($4,100, £2,500) by the RFEF for the incident. At club level he will be most fondly remembered as a legendary player and manager at Atletico Madrid. He won three La Liga titles and two Spanish Cups during 10 years as a player with Los Colchoneros, making 370 appearances and scoring 172 goals. Indeed, he scored the opening goal in the 1974 European Cup final against Bayern Munich, but after a late equaliser in extra time, the Germans went on to win a replay 4-0 two days later. It was at Atletico where Aragones also began his managerial career the next season, and he led Atleti to one of the most famous wins in their history as they beat Argentine side Independiente to win the Intercontinental Cup after Bayern refused to take part in the competition. Aragones also guided Atletico to one La Liga and three Copa del Rey titles during three spells as coach with the club in total. The ""wise man of Hortaleza"" managed nine clubs in total, including a brief spell at Barcelona in the late 1980s. His illustrious career was to end on an unfortunate note as he was sacked after just one season in charge of Fenerbahce in 2009. However, his legacy remains intact in Spain as the man who took the first step on what has become a golden era of dominance. As Iker Casillas, who Aragones made captain of the national team after the controversial dropping of Raul, said after his death: ""His idea has, up to this day, brought us great results. We will always remember him."""

""The RFEF wants to express its pain and consternation at the death of a man who was a player and coach at a number of Spanish clubs and around the world, and the Spanish national team coach at the beginning of its most glorious era of success at international level."" As well as the Spanish national side, Aragones managed 10 different clubs during a 35-year coaching career. He is most fondly remembered at Atletico Madrid, with whom he won La Liga in 1976/77 and three Copa del Rey titles across three spells in charge. ""Luis Aragones was a great player and coach, but more than that a great person and friend,"" said the Atletico president Enrique Cerezo in a statement on the club's website. ""He was an Atletico man above all else. I want to express on behalf of all those at the club our condolences to the family."" His crowning glory came on the international stage, though, in Austria and Switzerland in 2008 when he guided the until-then perennially underachieving Spanish national side to their first major tournament victory since 1964. Despite emerging victorious over Germany in the final in Vienna, Aragones stood by his pre-tournament decision to step down as Vicente del Bosque took over to guide Spain to their first World Cup in 2010 before retaining their European title two years later. Aragones returned to management just once after leaving La Seleccion, at Turkish side Fenerbahce, but his reign was short lived as he was sacked after a disappointing first season in charge. Tributes to Aragones poured in from those he was in charge of throughout his illustrious career. ""Today someone who has made an impression as much on me as a person as in my professional career has left us. Rest in peace boss. Thank you for everything,"" Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas posted on social networking site Instagram alongside a picture of he and Aragones. ""One of the greats has left us, it is a very sad day,"" added Real Madrid's Xabi Alonso on Twitter. One of his former clubs, Sevilla, also announced they will wear black armbands in their La Liga match against Malaga on Saturday night. Although widely revered in Spain, Aragones's coaching career was not short of controversy, most notably in 2004 when he was accused of using racist language to describe then Arsenal forward Thierry Henry in a bid to motivate Henry's club teammate Jose Antonio Reyes. Aragones protested his innocence, claiming his words had been misinterpreted, but he was fined 3,000 euros ($4,100, £2,500) by the RFEF for the incident."

In Bilbao, Aritz Aduriz had powered the hosts into a deserved lead four minutes before half-time and Athletic were only denied a bigger advantage at the break by two outstanding saves from Thibaut Courtois. However, Atletico regrouped at the break and levelled 10 minutes after the restart when Raul Garcia smashed home Emiliano Insua's cross. Diego Costa sealed their passage into the last four in the final stages as he slotted home his first goal of 2014 on the counter-attack to inflict Athletic Bilbao's first ever defeat at their San Mames ground, which they have used since the start of the season. Atletico will travel to the Santiago Bernabeu, where they beat Real 2-1 in last year's final, for the first leg of the semi-final next week with the return to come at the Vicente Calderon the following week. ""In the first 30 minutes we were in control of the tie, if not the match,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""From then until half-time they had a great end to the half, but we came out strong in the second-half and got the goal which gave us confidence and strength."" Simeone's men will now face Real three times in little over three weeks in league and Cup. However, they are unbeaten in four meetings against Madrid and Barcelona this season and the Argentine feels his side now believe they can compete with Spain's big two. ""This season we will play four more games against Barcelona and Real Madrid and that is good because it tests you more, but you also lose the fear of playing in those games."" Barcelona's passage into the semi-finals was far smoother as they thrashed Levante at a sodden and sparsely populated Camp Nou. Sergi Roberto's early own goal had given the visitors some hope of an improbable comeback from last week's 4-1 defeat. However, that was quickly extinguished as Adriano's long-range strike and Carles Puyol's thumping header gave Barca the lead on the night before half-time. Two goals in quick succession after the break from close range by Alexis Sanchez extended the hosts lead. Cesc Fabregas rounded off the scoring as his low effort beat Javi Jimenez at his near post 21 minutes from time."
684,26/01/2014,21:37,Football: Atletico Madrid see off Rayo to move top,Atletico Madrid moved back to the top of La Liga thanks to a comfortable 4-2 win at Rayo Vallecano on Sunday.,"David Villa gave the visitors the perfect start with his 11th goal of the season, but Diego Simeone's men were thankful to goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois moments later as he saved Jonathan Viera's penalty. Arda Turan doubled Atletico's advantage at the end of a fine team move and the Turkish midfielder was on hand to double his tally just before half-time after Viera's strike had briefly given Rayo hope. Saul Niguez's then put through his own net under pressure from Diego Costa to make it 4-1 before Joaquin Larrivey's headed consolation rounded off the scoring. Los Rojiblancos now lead local rivals Real Madrid by one point, but Barcelona can move back level with Atletico at the top should they beat Malaga at home later on Sunday. With top-scorer Costa still to score in seven games in 2014, Villa's return to goalscoring form has come just at the right time and he slotted away the opener confidently from Costa's unselfish cut-back. And Spain's all-time leading scorer was delighted to net his second goal in as many league games. ""I am very happy to be able to help the team get the victory and score a goal,"" said Villa. ""It is very important to continue winning, particularly away from home."" However, he insisted his side wouldn't dwell on their position atop the table as they now prepare for their Copa del Rey quarter-final, second leg away to Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday night. ""We can't think about being leaders. Now it is the time to think about the Cup and we need to keep going game by game."" Rayo had the perfect chance to level just four minutes later when Manquillo was harshly adjudged to have clipped Alberto Bueno inside the area. However, Courtois dived low to his right to palm away Viera's resulting spot-kick. Rayo keeper Ruben Martinez then kept his side in the game with an excellent double save from Costa and Jose Sosa. But there was nothing he could do to prevent Atletico doubling their lead on the half hour as excellent play from Costa and Sosa teed up Turan to roll into an empty net. Viera halved the deficit nine minutes later as his shot deflected off Miranda past the helpless Courtois. The visitors restored their two-goal cushion before half-time, though, as Turan slotted home Gabi's free-kick from a tight angle at the back post. Costa thought his moment had arrived 16 minutes from time as he stretched to meet Filipe Luis' low cross, but the ball clipped Saul on its way into the net and was credited as an own goal. Larrivey pulled another goal back for Rayo almost instantly from Viera's cross, but there was to be no late drama as Atletico returned to winning ways after two draws in their last two league outings. A 15th defeat of the season leaves Rayo still rooted in the relegation zone, five points off safety. Earlier, Athletic Bilbao continued their fine form with a 5-1 win away to Osasuna to move five points clear of Villarreal in the fight for the fourth Champions League place."

Gerard Pique quickly levelled from another corner, but despite intense pressure from the visitors after the break they couldn't find a way through. The point leaves moves Barca one point clear of Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga, but Atletico can go top should they beat Sevilla later on Sunday. Levante had been 6-0 down at half-time on their way to a 7-0 thrashing at the Camp Nou on the opening day of the season. However, Los Granotes made a far more positive start this time around as Vyntra headed home Andreas Ivanschitz's cross as Barca conceded from a corner for the sixth time in La Liga this season. The lead only lasted nine minutes as the visitors levelled in similar circumstances as Pique climbed highest to head home Xavi's corner. Thereafter, though, Barca struggled to create opportunities against Levante's back five in the first period with Xavi's drive from the edge of the box that drifted wide their best effort from open play. Gerardo Martino's men were more precise in their build-up play after the break and Alexis Sanchez managed to get in behind the Levante backline five minutes after the restart, but he delayed when faced with Levante keeper Keylor Navas and was eventually snuffed out. Fabregas was next to try his luck with a powerful shot from distance that was parried away by Navas. And Navas had to be at his best five minutes later as he denied Messi after he had been played in by a neat one-two with Fabregas before Juanfran blocked Xavi's follow-up effort on the line. Juanfran again put his body on the line to turn another goalbound effort from Messi behind moments later. However, Levante were maintaining a threat on the counter-attack and Valdes had to get down to hold Ivanschitz's header from Ruben Garcia's cross. Ivanschitz forced Valdes into another flying save 15 minutes from time as Barca left themselves exposed by pouring forward in search of a winner. However, they came desperately close to a winner five minutes from time when Cristian Tello's curling effort was brilliantly turned behind by Navas."
688,18/01/2014,18:21,"Football: Ronaldo, Bale on target as Madrid move joint top",Real Madrid moved level on points with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga with a 5-0 hammering of bottom-placed Real Betis on Saturday.,"Cristiano Ronaldo continued his fantastic week after lifting the Ballon d'Or on Monday with a thumping long-range drive to open the scoring before Gareth Bale silenced his recent critics with a trademark free-kick to make it 2-0. Karim Benzema then notched his 100th goal for Madrid in first-half stoppage time as he blasted home after classy play from Luka Modric. Angel di Maria made it four just after the hour mark with another stunning effort from distance and Alvaro Morata rounded off the scoring in stoppage time. All three leading clubs are now tied on 50 points, but Barca and Atletico can move back in front when then face Levante and Sevilla respectively on Sunday. Bale had struggled since his return from a calf injury at the beginning of the year with coach Carlo Ancelotti even admitting on Friday that the Welshman could do better. But the Italian praised the former Spurs man's display as his side produced their best display of the year to date. ""Bale played well, as did the whole team. We played with great quality and concentration throughout the game,"" he said. ""Everything went well and therefore we have to be happy. ""It was an important opportunity for us to go to the top of the table and we can sleep well tonight."" It was once again Ronaldo who stole the show early on as he opened the scoring 10 minutes in with a thunderous drive from 25 yards out that flew into the top left-hand corner of Stephan Andersen's net. Ronaldo nearly had another memorable goal to add to his collection 10 minutes later as he skipped past two Betis defenders before firing across the face of the goal. The visitors didn't have to wait long to double their advantage, though, as Bale did make his mark with a dipping free-kick on 25 minutes that beat the stationary Andersen, although the Danish keeper should have done better. Ruben Castro missed a wonderful opportunity to pull a goal back for the hosts when he failed to connect with Leo Baptistao's fine low cross six minutes before half-time. Instead, it was Madrid who struck again before the break as Modric continued his fantastic form of late with a wonderful piece of composed play inside the box to tee up Benzema to fire home at the near post. Andersen redeemed himself somewhat at the start of the second period as he made a fine low save to his right to prevent Ronaldo doubling his tally and also turned away a fiercely struck effort from Benzema. However, there was nothing the Betis keeper could do to prevent Di Maria making it four as he arrowed a low left-footed drive from 30 yards into the bottom corner. And Betis's afternoon was summed up in stoppage time when Morata nipped in to prod past Andersen as the home defence appealed in vain for offside."
689,12/01/2014,20:58,Football: Pepe winner moves Madrid closer to leaders,Real Madrid moved to within three points of La Liga leaders Barcelona and Atletico Madrid with a hard-fought 1-0 win over Espanyol on Sunday.,"Portuguese defender Pepe got the only goal of the game when he rose highest to head home Luka Modric's free-kick 10 minutes after half-time. Cristiano Ronaldo should then have added to his side's lead on a number of occasions. But despite their star man having an off night in front of goal, Madrid comfortably held on for the three points as Espanyol created nothing of note after falling behind. The hosts had started on the front foot and should have been in front after just three minutes when Cristian Stuani skewed his header wide when unmarked just six yards out. Thereafter, though, Madrid had the better of the chances in the first-half without ever completely dominating the game. Ronaldo uncharacteristically fluffed his lines after Karim Benzema's fine solo run down the left had freed the Portuguese inside the area. Espanyol keeper Kiko Casilla also had to beat away Angel di Maria's long-range drive and a free-kick from Ronaldo. However, the visitors best chances of the first 45 minutes came just before the break when Modric led a counter-attack, but after feeding Di Maria the Argentine failed to pick out one of four available teammates. The ball eventually fell to Gareth Bale and his cross was headed just wide by Benzema. Madrid did make the breakthrough 10 minutes into the second-half as Modric's free-kick towards the back post was powerfully headed low into the far corner by the unmarked Pepe. For Ronaldo, who is expected to pick up his second Ballon d'Or in Zurich on Monday, frustration continued to build as he also dragged an effort wide after being released by Di Maria. Bale was starting a league game for the first time in nearly a month and his looked short of match sharpness as he contributed little before being replaced by Jese Rodriguez 15 minutes from time. Casilla produced a stunning one hand save to prevent Ronaldo once more as he bore down on goal and Ronaldo then somehow fired wide with Casilla prone on the floor having parried Benzema's initial effort."
690,05/01/2014,17:55,Football: Sanchez hat-trick puts Barca back on top,Barcelona moved back to the top of La Liga on goal difference with a comfortable 4-0 win over Elche on Sunday thanks to a hat-trick from Alexis Sanchez.,"The Catalans are tied with Atletico Madrid on 49 points with the two set to meet for the first time in the league this season next weekend at the Vicente Calderon. Lionel Messi was once again watching from the sidelines as he nears a comeback from a hamstring injury and Neymar was left on the bench having recently returned from a Christmas break in Brazil. However, Sanchez and Pedro Rodriguez once again proved able deputies as they slotted home inside the opening 15 minutes. Xavi Hernandez also missed a second-half penalty for the hosts, but it mattered little as Sanchez rolled home his second goal from Pedro's pass shortly afterwards. And the Chilean sealed his first hat-trick for the club with a stunning free-kick 21 minutes from time. Barca now lead Real Madrid by eight points, but Madrid can cut the gap on the leaders to five with victory over Celta Vigo on Monday. It took Gerardo Martino's men just seven minutes to open their account in 2014 as Jordi Alba's enticing cross from the left was expertly finished by Sanchez at the back post. Victor Valdes was making his return in goal for Barca after six weeks out with a calf injury, but he was very nearly beaten on 14 minutes when Richmond Boakye fired a powerful drive off the outside of the post. Moments later, though, Barca had made the game safe as Cesc Fabregas' 10th assist of the season released Pedro to round Elche keeper Tono and roll the ball into an unguarded net. Pedro could have added to his tally twice more in the first-half as he flashed a shot just past the far post before seeing an attempted chip over Tono also float off target. Barca had a great chance to extend their advantage four minutes after the break when Cristian Sapunaru upended Fabregas inside the area and was extremely fortunate not to be shown a red card for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity. And Elche had another slice of luck when Xavi side-footed the resultant spot-kick wide of the target. The third goal did finally arrive just after the hour mark as Pedro unselfishly squared for Sanchez to double his tally for the afternoon. Six minutes later Sanchez sealed his hat-trick with a fine curling free-kick from 25 yards that brought wild celebrations from Martino on the touchline."

692,03/01/2014,02:15,"Football: Barca, Atletico jostle for position, Basque derby on cards","After a short winter break, Spain's top-flight clubs are back in action this weekend with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid jostling for position at the top of the table and a Basque derby also on the cards.","Reigning champions Barcelona and Diego Simeone's Atletico are level on points at the top and are due to face each other in a mouthwatering fixture in Madrid next weekend. Prior to that, though, Atletico go to Malaga on Saturday and Barcelona entertain Elche on Sunday before both sides have Copa del Rey ties to think about in midweek. Atletico, who have signed Argentine midfielder Jose Ernesto Sosa on loan from Metalist Kharkiv until the end of the season, will face a Malaga side who won their last two league games of 2013 to climb up into mid-table. Brazilian full-back Filipe Luis insists that the Rojiblancos are fully focused on their trip to La Rosaleda as they look to keep the pressure on Barcelona. ""Knowing the coach and the squad, nobody is thinking about the Barcelona game. Maybe the supporters are, but we all know that the Malaga match is vital,"" he said. ""We have not won there in two or three years and it is a difficult venue for us."" Both Atletico and Barca have enjoyed stunning starts to the campaign, winning 15 and drawing one of 17 games in La Liga, but the Catalans have not always performed convincingly since Gerardo Martino took over as coach in the summer. Nevertheless, the champions have been boosted by the return to the squad of goalkeeper Victor Valdes after injury, while Lionel Messi is also edging closer to a comeback. Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta is hoping a win against Elche - who sit just two points above the drop zone - can set his team up for a successful 2014. ""A good new year for us means winning everything"" said the man who scored Spain's World Cup-winning goal in 2010. ""When you have the chance to reach the top, you have to fight hard, and that's the kind of ambition that we hope will take us into April and May in contention. The team is playing well, and we need to grow from here."" Real Madrid, who sit third in the table, five points adrift of the top two, are in action on the Monday Three Kings Day holiday with a home fixture against Celta Vigo at the Santiago Bernabeu. The extra time to prepare for that game was used up playing in a glamour friendly against Paris Saint-Germain in Qatar on Thursday, which Carlo Ancelotti's team won 1-0 thanks to a first-half goal from young striker Jese. ""We are coming from behind but we have the whole second half of the season to come back and win the league,"" Ancelotti said. The first weekend of the New Year features the enticing prospect of a Basque derby between fifth-placed Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao at Anoeta. Athletic sit four points clear of their neighbours in the final Champions League qualifying position and have lost just one of their last 10 Liga games. Meanwhile, la Real, who finished fourth last season, have doubts over several players for the game, including the influential Xabi Prieto. That is not the only derby on the cards, with Valencia entertaining city rivals Levante at the Mestalla in what will be their first game since the appointment of Argentine-born former Barcelona and Spain striker Juan Antonio Pizzi as coach. Pizzi, who led San Lorenzo to the Argentine Torneo Inicial title last month, has replaced the sacked Miroslav Djukic in charge of Los Che, who sit level on points with Levante coming into their first game of 2014.

695,17/12/2013,06:01,Football: Year of new arrivals ends with Barca still on top,"In a year in which Barcelona started and finished on top of La Liga, 2013 was otherwise filled with change in Spain as the arrivals and departures of star players and coaches dominated the headlines.","Barca began the year with an almost unassailable lead in the title race and despite the unfortunate absence of coach Tito Vilanova for a large part of the second-half of the season, as he continued cancer treatment in New York, the Catalans wrapped up their 22nd league title with a club record 100 points. However, there was to be disappointment once more in the Champions League semi-finals for Barcelona as they suffered an embarrassing 7-0 aggregate defeat to eventual champions Bayern Munich. Real Madrid were also eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year as they too lost to German opposition in Borussia Dortmund. Another season of failure in Madrid's quest for a 10th European title ensured Jose Mourinho's rollercoaster ride as coach in the Spanish capital would come to an end. Yet, there was to be one final embarrassment for Mourinho as Atletico Madrid ended their 14-year winless streak against their city rivals by winning the Copa del Rey 2-1 in Real's own Santiago Bernabeu stadium. A third trophy in little over 18 months under the tutelage of Diego Simeone was the highlight of another stellar year for Atletico as they announced themselves as serious candidates on all fronts. Atletico cruised into the last 16 of the Champions League as group winners on their return to the competition for the first time in four years and only goals scored separates them from Barca the top of La Liga this season. The form of Simeone's men is even more impressive given the sale of Radamel Falcao to Monaco in June for 60 million euros ($82 million, £50 million). The Colombian wasn't the only big name to leave La Liga as Real Madrid sold Gonzalo Higuain to Napoli and, somewhat controversially, let Mesut Ozil join Arsenal on the final day of the transfer window. However, as ever, the giants of Madrid and Barcelona were more active in bringing in star names. Madrid moved first to replace Mourinho with two-time Champions League winning coach Carlo Ancelotti from Paris Saint-Germain. Real president Florentino Perez then showed his intention to build a new project full of young Spanish stars as under-21 internationals Isco and Asier Illaramendi were snapped up for just short of 70 million euros. But the big splash Madrid had been waiting to make all summer finally arrived on September 1 as they finally announced the capture of Gareth Bale for a reported 91 million euros, although sources in England claimed the figure to be higher than Real's world record capture of Cristiano Ronaldo for 94 million euros in 2009. Barca's business was done in reverse, their star signing Brazilian striker Neymar bought before the 2012/13 campaign had even finished in May for 57 million euros. Sadly, though, they too were forced into a change of manager when Vilanova was forced to resign due to his on-going ill health in late July leading to the appointment of Argentine Gerardo Martino. Both Bale and Neymar have settled in well without outshining their seniors in Ronaldo and World Player of the year Lionel Messi respectively. Neymar had the better start and was decisive in the only meeting between the sides so far this season with a goal and assist in Barca's 2-1 win in October. Bale, meanwhile, was affected by a number of niggling muscle injuries early on caused by the lack of a proper pre-season. However, his slow start as quickly been forgotten by a flurry of goals and assists in November and December as Madrid closed to within five points of the leaders."

697,15/12/2013,23:00,Football: Costa double takes Atletico level with Barca,Atletico Madrid joined Barcelona at the top of La Liga as a double from Diego Costa guided them to a 3-0 win over Valencia on Sunday.,"After a disappointing first-half, Costa opened the scoring in style with a stunning individual effort 14 minutes after the restart. Just four minutes later substitute Raul Garcia rattled home a loose ball inside the area to seal the three points. Costa then saw a penalty saved by Diego Alves, but made no mistake when handed a second opportunity from the spot six minutes later to move level with Cristiano Ronaldo as La Liga's top scorer on 17. Both Atletico and Barca, on 43 points from 16 games, now have a five-point lead over Real Madrid after Los Blancos could only manage a 2-2 draw at Osasuna on Saturday. Atletico boss Diego Simeone made seven changes from the side that started in the 2-0 Champions League win over Porto in midweek as he resorted to his strongest available line-up. However, the hosts still found it hard going in the opening 45 minutes as Valencia controlled possession without posing a threat to Thibaut Courtois's goal. Atletico started the second period with far more urgency and after Tiago had turned Miranda's cross just wide, Costa ran half the length of the field before finishing low past Alves. Garcia then came on to replace David Villa and with virtually his first involvement in the game he made it 2-0 with an accurate drive into the far corner from inside the area. Costa's direct running was causing the Valencia defence all sorts of problems and he had the chance to make it three when he was pulled down by Victor Ruiz inside the area 15 minutes from time. But Alves dived to his right to turn away the resulting penalty -- the third time Costa has missed from the spot already this season. Costa wasn't to be denied a second time, though, as after he had been felled by Antonio Barragan, he blasted high past the helpless Alves. Earlier, Athletic Bilbao strengthened their position in fourth place with a 1-1 draw away to Sevilla. Alberto Moreno fired the hosts in front after four minutes only for Markel Susaeta to level two minutes later. Susaeta also saw a first-half penalty saved by Beto, but in the end Athletic were happy to settle for the point which moves them two clear of fifth-placed Villarreal. Real Sociedad moved to within four points of their Basque neighbours Athletic as they hammered bottom of the table Real Betis 5-1 at Anoeta. Imanol Agirretxe scored twice, whilst Antoine Griezmann, Ion Ansotegi and Xabi Prieto were also on target as Sociedad recorded their third straight league win. And Almeria moved out of the relegation zone with a 0-0 draw at home to Espanyol."

""We have done very well in this first part of the competition,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""Today we were clinical in the first-half, but we suffered a bit too with the chances that Porto had. ""I am very happy with the result because the team continues to be competitive."" With Atletico already assured of first place in the group, Simeone rested a number of first team regulars from the start and it was no surprise that Porto started the brighter. Jackson Martinez went desperate close to the opener on eight minutes as he connected sweetly with Danilo's cross from the right and the ball rebounded to safety off the crossbar. Six minutes later it was Atletico who went in front as Garcia's fierce effort from a narrow angle caught Porto keeper Helton napping at his near post. Silvestre Varela then saw a headed effort clip the bar as Porto responded positively and they had a glorious chance to equalise when Aranzubia upended Martinez inside the area. However, Josue's powerful spot-kick was placed too close to the keeper who redeemed himself with a smart save. It wasn't to be Martinez's night as he struck the post once more moments later. And Atletico eventually took advantage of Porto's high line on the counter-attack as Costa raced onto Oliver Torres' through ball to round Helton and squeeze home his fourth goal in just three Champions League appearances. David Villa replaced Costa at the break as Simeone looked ahead to Saturday's visit of Valencia in La Liga. Without their top scorer, Atletico were happy to sit on their lead rather than go in search of a third and as a result the second-half was far less of a spectacle as Porto pressed without having creating any clear openings of note. However, that was of no concern to Simeone's men who now await to see who they will face in the last 16 when the draw is made in Nyon, Switzerland on December 16."

701,05/12/2013,21:53,Football: Aragones makes swift retirement U-turn,"Spain's Euro 2008-winning coach Luis Aragones on Thursday denied reports that he had retired, insisting he was still open to the right offer.","In an interview with Spanish website Voz Populi, the 75-year-old had said earlier in the day: ""Luis is in the past: he's finished, I won't coach any more."" But later on Thursday he claimed his words had been misinterpreted and that he was still interested in coaching, as long as a good enough offer came up. ""About this, no-one is retiring, never,"" Aragones told the Mundo Deportivo newspaper. ""I haven't announced anything. They misinterpreted my words, at no moment did I want to say that I was retiring. ""Time has passed and I haven't returned to coaching because none of the offers I've had in this time have tempted me, but that doesn't mean that I've left."" However, his earlier comments on Vozpopuli.com had suggested otherwise. ""Age has retired me and it wasn't a difficult decision to make,"" he said. ""Before retiring, when I left Turkey (where he had coached Fenerbahce until 2009), I knew it was going to be difficult to continue and today I know it is definitive. ""There are many circumstances. Age, where can you coach, how can you coach... there are many things which make you say that it is finished."" If he did choose to retire, he could be well satisfied with his contribution to football in Spain. As well as the Spanish national side, Aragones trained ten different clubs during a 35-year coaching career.

Defeat was the first sign that Barca could be missing the influence of the injured Lionel Messi and Victor Valdes, but Xavi insisted those that are available have to show the right attitude when they face Athletic. ""They are important players and you are going to miss them, but that wasn't the principal reason for the defeat. We didn't do enough to win. ""We need to have intensity from the start and in San Mames it will be another test. ""We need to turn it around and go for it from the off with that intensity that we lacked (against Ajax)."" Barca are likely to also be without full-backs Adriano, Jordi Alba and Dani Alves on Sunday, but Sergio Busquets and Alexis Sanchez will return after being rested in midweek. Athletic have had an impressive start to the campaign themselves as Monday's 2-1 win over Malaga moved them to within a point of Villarreal in the final Champions League spot. Ernesto Valverde's side are unbeaten at home since the opening of the new San Mames in September with four wins and two draws from six games at their new stadium. The visit of the league leaders will prove their biggest test to date, but striker Aritz Aduriz is hoping they can take advantage of Barca's series of injuries. ""They are very important players for them. We will see if we are capable of taking advantage of it, although the other players have all it takes to replace them,"" he told sports daily Marca. ""To me they seem just as good as always. Until now they have won almost every game. Their level is just as good if not better than in previous seasons."" Real Madrid have the chance to cut their gap to Barcelona to three points for 24 hours at least when they host Valladolid on Saturday. Carlo Ancelotti's men continued their free-scoring form with a 4-1 destruction of Galatasaray in the Champions League on Wednesday despite playing the majority of the match with just 10 men. Madrid have now scored 26 times in their last six games at home and in Europe and could be boosted by the return of Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese missed Wednesday's game due to a slight muscle strain, but Ancelotti confirmed that the player himself is confident he will be fit in time to face Valladolid. And even if La Liga's top scorer doesn't make it, Valladolid boss Juan Ignacio Martinez is aware of the daunting task facing his side. ""It is very difficult to get anything there because they are very good and, moreover, they have gained a lot since the return of Xabi Alonso,"" he said. ""We will try to compete well and hopefully remove the bad taste in our mouth we had after defeat in the last game against Osasuna."" Second-placed Atletico Madrid are also in action on Saturday away to Elche as they too can put the pressure on Barcelona by moving level on points with the Catalans. Diego Simeone will recall a number of first team regulars, including Diego Costa and David Villa, having left six players back in Madrid to rest while the remainder of his squad travelled to Russia for a 1-1 draw with Zenit St Petersburg in the Champions League in midweek.

707,26/11/2013,21:00,Football: Courtois error ends Atletico's perfect record,A huge error from Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois allowed Zenit St Petersburg to snatch a vital Champions League point against the high-flying Spaniards as they drew 1-1 in Russia on Tuesday.,"An under-strength Atletico, already assured of a pass to the knockout stages as Group G leaders, had taken the lead eight minutes into the second-half when Adrian Lopez broke clear of the Zenit defence and finished confidently low past Juri Lodigin. However, the Russians were saved 17 minutes from time when Courtois allowed teammate Toby Alderweireld's looping header to drop into his own net to end Atletico's 100 percent record in the Champions League so far this season. The result does still dent Zenit's chances of progressing to the last 16 as they now need to beat Austria Vienna on matchday six and hope that Porto drop points against the Austrians later on Tuesday or when they visit Madrid in two weeks time. With Atletico already assured of top spot coach Diego Simeone left a number of his first-team regulars, including Diego Costa, David Villa and Diego Godin back in the Spanish capital. And Atleti boss Diego Simeone was full of praise for those who had come in and aquitted themselves well, especially Adrian. ""It was a difficult game in a difficult stadium to come to against very good players, but we got a good result,"" he said. ""I always underline the work of the group, but Adrian in the way he is improving is becoming closer to the player that we need."" Zenit dominated possession but struggled to breakdown Atleti's solid defence in the first-half with Hulk's piledriver from the edge of the area that was beaten away by Courtois their most dangerous effort. Atletico had failed to take advantage of the space Zenit were allowing them to counter-attack into during the first period, but they finally got it right just after the break as Raul Garcia released Adrian and he kept his composure to slot home his second goal in as many games. Garcia then nearly doubled the visitors' advantage as he rattled the crossbar, whilst at the other end Alexander Kerzhakov headed a great chance over from close range. Zenit's equaliser was to arrive in comic fashion though as Courtois let Alderweireld's header go, believing it was going out for a corner, only to be left embarrassed when the ball dipped underneath his crossbar. Garcia had another chance to win the game eight minutes from the end, but this time was denied by a smart low stop from Lodygin as the spoils were shared. Zenit coach Luciano Spalletti said he was pleased with his team's performance. ""We played a good match against very strong opponents,"" he said. ""My players showed almost all they could. Unfortunately we missed too many scoring opportunities tonight. But I'm pleased with my team's performance."" ""We have drawn all three of our home matches in the group. Today the draw looks a fair result."""

709,22/11/2013,02:15,"Football: Barca begin vital run without Messi, Valdes",Injury-ravaged Barcelona could be without seven first-team players as they look to consolidate their position at the top of La Liga at home to Granada on Saturday.,"The Catalans will begin a run of eight games across three competitions before Christmas without four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi after he tore his left hamstring in Barca's last outing away to Real Betis a fortnight ago. Barca's injury crisis has deepened since then as goalkeeper Victor Valdes will also miss the rest of the year after rupturing a calf muscle in Spain's 1-0 friendly defeat to South Africa in midweek. Right-back Dani Alves also returned from international duty with a calf problem that will see him sidelined for up to 10 days, whilst Gerard Pique, Cesc Fabregas and Xavi Hernandez are doubts and Jordi Alba remains out injured. Valdes' absence means that 38-year-old stopper Jose Manuel Pinto will start in goal for the next six weeks. And defender Javier Mascherano is confident Pinto's experience will be key in deputising for the on-form Valdes. ""The injuries to Victor and Leo are very important, but every player is able to play,"" he said on Thursday. ""The squad is very big. Valdes is important for what he represents and for the excellent level he has had until now. But we have to support Pinto, he has always responded when he has needed to. ""He is a keeper with a lot of experience. We cannot forget that he has won two Copa del Reys and had very good performances."" With such a raft of injuries, coach Gerardo Martino may be forced to hand 21-year-old Sergi Roberto his first start of the season in midfield. Neymar, meanwhile, will carry the significant burden of compensating for the loss of Messi in attack. Should Barca slip up at the Camp Nou on league duty for the first time in over a year, Real Madrid will be confident of cutting their six-point deficit on the leaders when they travel to Almeria. Los Blancos will be able to unleash the on-fire Cristiano Ronaldo fresh from his hat-trick that sealed Portugal's place in the World Cup with a 3-2 win over Sweden in midweek. ""It has been a very intense few days with our national teams, but we have two days in front of us to prepare in the best way possible for the next game,"" Ronaldo told Madrid's website. ""My only goal, like the whole dressing room, is to now work so that all Real Madrid fans continue to be excited by their team."" Ronaldo has also scored nine times in his last four games for Madrid and will look to continue his lethal partnership with Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema in attack. However, Real suffered a serious injury blow during the international break as Sami Khedira suffered cruciate ligament damage that is likely to keep him out for the rest of the season. Brazilian midfielder Casemiro is expected to make his first start of the campaign in the German's absence. Coach Carlo Ancelotti also has a problem at left-back as both Marcelo and Fabio Coentrao are sidelined for the next few weeks through injury. Second-placed Atletico Madrid are also in action on Saturday as they host Getafe at the Vicente Calderon. Atleti's top-scorer Diego Costa is not expected to be fit, though, as he is still struggling with the thigh injury that prevented him from making his Spain debut in the world champions' friendly encounters with Equatorial Guinea and South Africa in the past week.

The injury delays Costa's long-awaited and controversial first appearance for Vicente del Bosque's team. ""This injury will prevent him from accepting Vicente del Bosque's call-up for the Spanish national team for the games against Guinea and South Africa, for which he had been named,"" Atletico said. ""The striker will be on a sporting rest undergoing physiotherapy,"" the club said. Costa, who has also acquired Spanish nationality, was called up last week for the friendly matches against Equatorial Guinea on Saturday and South Africa on Tuesday next week. The Atletico Madrid man declared his intention to play for Spain, for whom he qualifies on residency grounds, and rejected a call-up from Brazil boss Luiz Felipe Scolari last month. ""It was quite a difficult decision to choose between the country where you were born and the country that has given you everything, which is Spain,"" he said at the time. ""I looked at it, weighed it up and the correct thing is to play for Spain because here I have done everything, all that I have in my life and that I have been given has been in this country. ""I feel a special love for this country, here I feel very valued for what I do every day and I feel the love of the people."" Costa had represented Brazil twice as recently as March in friendly games against Italy and Russia. However, as he hadn't played a competitive international he was still able to switch his allegiance to Spain. Scolari slammed Costa's decision, saying the player had turned ""his back on the dream of millions."" Costa came up through the youth ranks at Barcelona Esportivo Capela in Sao Paulo but his first professional contract was with Sporting Braga in Portugal, whom he joined in February 2006. After joining Los Rojiblancos in 2007, he was farmed out on loan to Celta Vigo, Albacete, Valladolid and finally Rayo Vallecano. He returned to Atletico from Rayo last July. Del Bosque will also be without Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who picked up a sprained knee ligament during the Catalan side's 4-1 win over Real Betis in La Liga on Sunday. Barcelona said Fabregas will need roughly one week to recover. He will be replaced by Barcelona's Marc Bartra."

The Argentine was also substituted with a hamstring problem against Atletico Madrid in August and pulled up with a thigh problem in Barca's win over Almeria at the end of September. Messi has failed to score in La Liga since returning from that injury, marking his longest run without a league goal in over two years. However, he had appeared to have returned to form when he scored twice in Barca's 3-1 win over AC Milan in midweek."

The Portuguese added the third from the penalty spot before Bale played in Sami Khedira to make it 4-0 after just 36 minutes. Antoine Griezmann restored some pride for the visitors with his sixth goal in his last three league games after the break. But Ronaldo rounded off the scoring with a sensational free-kick to take his tally for the season to 24 goals in just 17 games. Victory moves Real to within two points of neighbours Atletico Madrid and three of leaders Barcelona with the top two both in action on Sunday. ""We scored very quickly and so things went very well. The truth is that after going ahead 4-0, we relaxed a bit and played more slowly in the second-half,"" Ronaldo told Gol TV. ""Overall, I am satisfied with the way we played, although we are not yet at 100 percent, we keep winning."" Another stunning display from Ronaldo led to calls from the Bernabeu crowd for him to win the Ballon d'Or, but he insists he is not concerned by whether he is crowned the world's best player for a second time come January. ""I don't want to talk about the Ballon d'Or. I give my answers on the field. It is something that doesn't depend on me and, therefore, it doesn't bother me that much."" Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema started together up front for the fourth consecutive game after combining for 12 goals and eight assists in the previous three. And it didn't take the hosts long to get into their stride as Ronaldo fired a dipping long-range effort off the top of the crossbar after just eight minutes. The Portuguese did then open the scoring four minutes later when he controlled Benzema's clever low cross inside the area before smashing the ball past the helpless Claudio Bravo. And Ronaldo turned provider moments later as his cut-back from the by-line picked out Benzema inside the box and he stroked home his eighth goal of the season. It was 3-0 before the half-hour mark as Markel Bergara was harshly penalised for handling Ronaldo's fiercely struck effort and the former Manchester United man stepped up to double his tally for the afternoon. Bale then passed up his first big opportunity when he side-footed wide after being played in by the impressive Luka Modric. However, the Welshman made amends nine minutes before the break when he provided his fifth assist in four games by playing in Khedira to fire home from the edge of the area. With the game already won, Real's intensity dropped a little after the interval and Griezmann thought he should have won a penalty on the hour mark as he looked to have been clipped as he rounded Diego Lopez. Just 60 seconds later, though, the Frenchman did notch a consolation with a lovely chipped finish over Lopez from Carlos Vela's pass. Griezmann could even have had a second moments later when he prodded just wide of the far post. Typically, however, Ronaldo was to have the final say as he rattled home a wonderful 25-yard free-kick 14 minutes from time to seal his 23rd hat-trick for Madrid."

717,07/11/2013,12:00,Football: Simeone's Atletico revolution takes Europe by storm,"With a 100 percent record in the Champions League and 11 wins from 12 games in La Liga, Atletico Madrid have been one of the revelations of European football this season.","A 4-0 hammering of Austria Vienna on Wednesday meant Atletico joined holders Bayern Munich as the only sides to have won all four of their group games and ensured simple passage into the last-16 on their return to the Champions League for the first time in four years. Diego Simeone's men also split traditional powerhouses Barcelona and Real Madrid in La Liga, a point behind the Catalans and five ahead of their city rivals. However, the high they are currently riding is no flash in the pan. Since Simeone's arrival at the club in December 2011, the man who was a star player the last time Atletico won the league back in 1995/96, has completely turned around what was an underachieving sleeping giant. Whilst world class talents like Fernando Torres, Sergio Aguero and Diego Forlan came and went from the Vicente Calderon, the overall organisation of the club and lack of balance on the field prevented them from ever truly punching their weight over the past decade. Simeone's arrival brought about an instant change in fortunes. In his first six months in charge the team shot up the table to just miss out on Champions League football on the final day of the season and stormed to the Europa League by winning every single game in the knockout stage. That was followed by more silverware as they hammered Chelsea 4-1 in the European Super Cup thanks to a Radamel Falcao hat-trick and, powered by the Colombian, they started last season in similar fashion winning 11 of their opening 13 games before being defeated, as the always did, to Real in the Madrid derby. Simeone's powers of motivation and tactical nous even managed to end that curse though, as Atletico eventually beat Real for the first time in 14 years at the best possible time, in the best possible scenario. A Copa del Rey final at the Santiago Bernabeu, 40,000 Atleti fans there to witness them break down the biggest psychological barrier on enemy territory. ""Before his arrival we were all a little floored because things weren't going well, we had been fairly eliminated from the Copa del Rey by (second division) Albacete,"" admitted midfielder Koke, the man christened the ""new Xavi"" by certain sections of the Spanish press. ""The manager arrived and he totally changed this mentality. He showed us how to have a positive mentality and since then everything has gone well."" The continued rise of Atletico's stock this season is arguably Simeone's greatest achievement as they have taken on the extra rigours of Champions League football and coped with Falcao's departure to Monaco without any sort of stumble. Young players that he has blooded like Koke and Mario Suarez have become regulars in the Spanish squad, whilst Diego Costa's transformation under his tutelage saw Spain and Brazil squabble for the services of the striker who has now scored 16 goals in as many games this season. Simeone has continued to play down his side's chances of winning La Liga, repeatedly dismissing the competition as a ""boring league"" which only the big two can win due to the financial disparity between them and the rest. Therefore, it could on the biggest stage of all where Atletico truly make their mark; the Champions League. ""We trust in our coach because he knows how to draw the maximum from every one of us,"" full-back Juanfran told the media ahead of the Vienna return. ""It is clear that Atletico has always been a cup team, the elimination format suits us. I am one of those that believe that the Spanish league continues to be the best, the strongest and most competitive, and perhaps it will be harder to win the league than the Champions League."" Unbeaten in their last four meetings with Barca and Madrid, they have already shown they can compete with the continent's best when the distance is reduced to two games rather than 38."
718,05/11/2013,02:45,Football: Last-16 in sight for on fire Atletico,In-form Atletico Madrid can seal their place in the last-16 of the Champions League when they host  Austria Vienna at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday.,"One defeat in 17 games in all competitions this season sees Atletico trail Barcelona by just a point at the top of La Liga, but their cruise through Group G has arguably been even more impressive on their return to the competition for the first time in four years. An opening day victory at home to Zenit St Petersburg has been followed up by impressive wins on the road at Porto and in Austria two weeks ago to leave Diego Simeone's men needing just one win from their final three games to seal their passage into the knockout stage. The visitors' 3-0 win in Vienna was marked by a stunning performance from Diego Costa on his Champions League debut having been suspended for the opening two games of the campaign. Costa scored twice, including one superb solo effort as he ran half the length of the field to slot home, and has continued his rampant scoring form in recent weeks to take his tally to 15 goals in as many games this season. Atletico defender Diego Godin hailed the partnership Costa and David Villa have struck up since the latter arrived to fill the considerable gap left by the departure of Radamel Falcao to Monaco in June. ""They have started the season very well in both La Liga and the Champions League. ""Hopefully they will continue in this form because they are two fundamental players and key to the overall functioning of the team."" Both frontmen will be out to impress on Wednesday with Vicente del Bosque set to announce his Spanish squad for the friendly against South Africa later this month on Thursday. Playmaker Arda Turan remains the only major absentee for Atletico so either Adrian Lopez or teenage sensation Oliver Torres are expected to be handed their first Champions League start. With just one point from their opening three group games, Vienna almost certainly need to take something from their visit to the Spanish capital if they are to keep their hopes alive of reaching the knockout stages in what is the first time they have qualified for the group stage. Coach Nenad Bjelica will have to watch the match from the stands after being sent-off in the meeting between the two sides three weeks ago. However, the Violets did get their domestic campaign back on track with a much needed 3-0 win over Wiener Neustadt on Sunday to move up to fifth in the Austrian Bundesliga."

Group E Chelsea (ENG) v Schalke 04 (GER) Chelsea host Schalke smarting from their shock 2-0 defeat at Newcastle at the weekend, a defeat that could lead Blues boss Jose Mourinho to tinker with his line-up. After an opening loss to Basel Chelsea have got into their European stride, with impressive wins against Steaua Bucharest and at Schalke last time out. ""We are in a stable position to qualify in the Champions League but if we lose again we are in a difficult position,"" Mourinho warned. Schalke, sharing top spot with Chelsea on six points, travel to Stamford Bridge on the back of a 2-0 win over Hertha Berlin in the Bundesliga. Basel (SUI) v Steaua Bucharest (ROM) Basel came away from Bucharest with a disappointing draw a fortnight ago which left them in third and on target for a post-Christmas ticket to the Europa League. After upsetting Chelsea in their first group game though they will be anxious to bag all the points here to keep them in the running for a place in the knockout stages. Group F Borussia Dortmund (GER) v Arsenal (ENG) Dortmund ruined Arsene Wenger's 64th birthday celebrations with a 2-1 win at the Emirates a fortnight ago. Dortmund 'keeper Roman Weidenfeller is wary of a reaction, saying: ""We have irritated them with our win in London. Now they want to strike back."" The Bundesliga outfit could not be in better shape, meting out a 6-1 drubbing to Vfb Stuttgart last Friday. Arsenal, second on goal difference to Dortmund, make the trip in good heart themselves having seen off Liverpool 2-0 to pull five points clear in the Premier League. Wenger said: ""We go to Dortmund now and we were very disappointed with how we lost to them. It was a very sloppy goal when we were in control but we got a good result in Germany last season against Bayern Munich. So we have been there before and are used to the atmosphere over there and hopefully we can get a good result."" Napoli (ITA) v Marseille (FRA) Rafael Benitez's Napoli are on a three-match winning run in Serie A, and host Marseille after a 2-1 win at the Velodrome on matchday three. That's left the Italians bang in contention for a place in the knockout round, level on six points with Dortmund and Arsenal, while for pointless Marseille, who ended a five match losing run in Ligue 1 on Saturday, it's a case of win or bust. The Italians are without right back Giandomenico Mesto, who underwent knee surgery on Monday. Group G Zenit St Petersburg (RUS) v FC Porto (POR) Zenit can steal a march on Porto for the runners-up spot by beating them on Wednesday and open up a four point gap with two games remaining. The Russian side made heavy weather of beating Porto in their match a fortnight ago as the hosts played most of the match with only 10 men. Zenit, though, go into the game having seen their eight match winning streak ended at the weekend with a 1-1 draw by Amkar Perm. Porto too were held to a surprise draw, 1-1 away at unheralded Belenenses. Porto boast a good away record away against Russian sides, winning four and losing one, while Zenit have never lost at home to Portuguese clubs in five matches. Atletico Madrid (ESP) v Austria Vienna (AUT) Atletico have made light work of a weak group and can seal their place in the Last 16 -- for the first time since the 2008/09 campaign -- with victory over an Austrian team they outclassed last month in a 3-0 win. A win for Atletico would also set a new club record of four successive wins in European club football's premier competition, beating the three in the 1958/59 season. Atletico warmed up for the game with a comfortable 2-0 win at home to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday for their 11th win in 12 La Liga games. Coach Diego Simeone will be looking to his Brazilian-born striker Diego Costa to inflict more pain on their opponents after he scored a double against them in the first match. ""It's not just his goals, in his participation in the play and the connection he has with the other players he makes the team better,"" purred Simeone of his leading scorer, who has more than made up for the sale of Falcao in the close season. Group H Ajax (NED) v Celtic (SCO) Ajax need at least a point from this game if they are not to be in serious danger of missing out even on third spot and a place in the Europa League. Celtic by contrast will be seeking a repeat of the win they grabbed against the Dutch side last month which reignited hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages for the second successive season. Ajax have made their worst ever start to a CL campaign while Celtic are bidding to avoid a third successive away defeat. Celtic manager Neil Lennon says that he wants his players to take their chances otherwise it could prove very costly. His Ajax counterpart, though, Frank de Boer believes that if his young team repeat the performance they produced against Celtic in the first game they will take the points. ""If we play like that again in two weeks, then we will beat them in the Amsterdam ArenA. I really believe in that."" Barcelona (ESP) v AC Milan (ITA) Barcelona can all but seal their place in the Last 16 with victory at home to a woefully out of sorts and injury-hit Milan side. Barcelona's worries are small by comparison to the Italians, who have made their worst start to a Serie A season in over 20 years, their loss to Fiorentina at the weekend their fifth of the season already. However, coach Massimiliano Allegri appears to be benefiting from some unaccustomed patience from the club directors who have called for no one to panic. However defeat in Barcelona and a Celtic win would really heap pressure on them in the chase for the second spot. The Scottish side are yet to host them and will fancy their chances of avenging an unfortunate defeat at the San Siro."
722,01/11/2013,22:58,Football: Barca down Espanyol thanks to Sanchez strike,Barcelona extended their lead at the top of La Liga on Friday as they overcame stiff resistence from Espanyol to win the Catalan derby 1-0 at the Camp Nou.,"Alexis Sanchez scored the only goal of the game midway through the second-half when he tapped home Neymar's pinpoint cross to score for the third consecutive game. However, it was another frustrating evening for Lionel Messi as he failed to score for a fourth consecutive La Liga match. Barca now lead second-placed Atletico Madrid by four points and Real Madrid by nine with both sides from the capital having played a game less. The hosts were almost back to full strength after resting a host of first-team regulars for the 3-0 win over Celta Vigo in midweek as Gerard Pique, Javier Mascherano, Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Neymar all returned to the side, whilst Martin Montoya deputised for the injured Adriano at left-back. However, the toll of five games in 13 days appeared to affect the Spanish champions as their build-up play was laboured in the first-half and they caused Espanyol very few problems. Kiko Casilla was forced into an early save from Alexis Sanchez after nice work by Iniesta and Messi. But it was the visitors who had the best chance of the half when Victor Sanchez sneaked in behind Dani Alves and Victor Valdes had to race from his line to turn the midfielder's effort behind. Barca did come to life just before the break as Iniesta's volley from the edge of the area was parried by Casilla before Alves struck the post from similar range. The pattern continued after the restart with Espanyol happy to sit 10 men behind the ball and wait for Barca. Gerardo Martino's men nearly made the breakthrough on 54 minutes when Casilla produced a fine save to turn away Messi's flicked header. Neymar then bent a stunning effort inches wide of Casilla's left-hand post as the pressure built from Barca. And it was the Brazilian who finally unlocked the Espanyol defence as his wonderful low cross between the legs of two defenders left Sanchez with the simplest of finishes at the back post to register his seventh goal of the season. Messi saw a free-kick fly just wide with nine minutes remaining as Barca went in search of the goal that would kill the game off. Substitute Pedro Rodriguez ought to have doubled the advantage when he fired into Casilla's legs two minutes from time, but Barca held on to register their 10th clean sheet in 17 games this season."

They make me feel spectacular despite the fact that I am far away from my country, home and family,"" Godin told the club's website. ""What can be better than being here with people who love you and make you feel like one of them."" Godin arrived at Atletico from Villarreal in August 2010 after staring for Uruguay at the World Cup in South Africa. And after a difficult start, the 27-year-old has become a pivotal figure in the club's success under Diego Simeone. Godin was part of the side that won the Europa League in 2012 and helped Atletico beat Real Madrid for the first time in 14 years to lift the Copa del Rey in May. This season Atleti trail leaders Barcelona by just a point in La Liga and are well on course for the last-16 of the Champions League having won all three of their group games so far. ""He is a very important player on the field and he strengthens the consistency of the group inside the dressing room,"" added the club's sporting director Jose Luis Perez Caminero. ""We will continue to back the squad we have and maintain the group that is offering us such joy."""

""It was quite a difficult decision to choose between the country where you were born and the country that has given you everything, which is Spain,"" he said on Atletico's website. ""I looked at it, weighed it up and the correct thing is to play for Spain because here I have done everything, all that I have in my life and that I have been given has been in this country. ""I feel a special love for this country, here I feel very valued for what I do every day and I feel the love of the people."" Costa had also been included in Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari's preliminary squad for their two friendlies against Honduras and Chile next month. However, Scolari confirmed on Tuesday that Costa was no longer part of his plans and slammed the player's decision to ""turn his back on the dream of millions."" Costa had represented Brazil twice as recently as March in friendly games against Italy and Russia. However, as he hadn't played a competitive international he was still able to switch his allegiance to Spain. ""I want the people to understand that in no moment was I giving up on Brazil,"" he added. ""I don't see it like that. Simply that here I feel very valued and played my whole career. ""I have family in Brazil, it is where I was born and where, hopefully, I will live once I stop playing football. I hope that the people understand and respect that."" The demand for Costa's services from two of the favourites to lift next year's World Cup represents a huge turnaround in the career of a player that only became a first-team regular at Atletico last season. Although he came up through the youth ranks at Barcelona Esportivo Capela in Sao Paulo, his first professional contract was with Sporting Braga in Portugal, whom he joined in February 2006. After joining Los Rojiblancos in 2007, he was farmed out on loan to Celta Vigo, Albacete, Valladolid and finally Rayo Vallecano. However, on his return to Atletico from Rayo last July, he was imbedded into a side on the up since the arrival of coach Diego Simeone in December 2011. Costa struck up a fine partnership with Radamel Falcao and was the top scorer in the Copa del Rey as Atletico won the competition for the first time in 17 years. This season, with Falcao having left to join Monaco, he has become Atletico's focal point and leads the league with 11 goals in 10 games, three more than Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. And he also made a huge impact on his Champions League debut last week with a double, including one sensational solo effort, as Atletico continued their 100 percent record in the competition with a 3-0 win at Austria Vienna."

Villa then made the game safe with a quickfire brace just after half-time. La Liga's top-scorer Diego Costa took his tally to 13 goals in 13 games in all competitions when he slotted home from Villa's pass 25 minutes from time before Gabi rounded off the scoring in stoppage time. Torres had been handed a start in place of the injured Arda Turan and the Spanish Under-21 international was in the right place at the right time as he slotted home at the back post from Koke's cut-back. Atletico boss Diego Simeone was happy with the impact that Torres made not only with his goal, but his overall display. ""I could see that the team needed the characteristics that Oliver has. ""He was ready to play and he responded brilliantly today. I expect a lot of him, but he is young and still learning."" Costa ought to have scored twice before half-time as he firstly slotted wide when clean through on goal and was then denied by Betis keeper Guillermo Sara who stood up well to turn his effort behind for a corner. Sara had to be replaced by Stephan Andersen at half-time due to an injury, but the Dane's first job was to pick the ball out of the net as Villa neatly flicked home Costa's cross at the near post eight minutes after the restart. And three minutes later Villa smashed home his fifth goal of the season after Koke's pass towards Torres deflected fortunately into his path. ""In the second-half we found Villa in the areas where he lives, in the box,"" Simeone added. ""It is normal for a player of his standing to need to score. We need the best version of Villa and today we saw a glimpse of that."" Costa finally got the goal he craved when Villa's lovely through ball allowed him to plant a left-footed finish into the far corner. He was then withdrawn with one eye on the upcoming league matches against Granada and Athletic Bilbao in mind, but Atletico still had one more goal in them when Gabi fired low into the corner with the last kick of the game. Villarreal strengthened their hold on fourth spot with a 4-1 thrashing of Valencia at the Madrigal. Early goals from Ikechukwu Uche and Hernan Perez put the hosts 2-0 up at half-time before a Giovanni Dos Santos double completed the rout after the break. Real Sociedad continued their recovery with a 3-0 win over the still winless Almeria to move up to ninth. Sevilla also moved into the top half of the table with a 2-1 win over 10-man Osasuna."
728,26/10/2013,21:50,Football: Ancelotti backs beleaguered Bale,Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has backed Gareth Bale to come good despite another insipid performance from the Welshman in the 2-1 defeat by Barcelona on Saturday night.,"Bale was handed just his second start since joining Los Blancos for 91 million euros ($125.5 million, £77.6 million) last month, but failed to make an impact on the game before being replaced by Karim Benzema after an hour. The 24-year-old occupied a variety of positions across the frontline during his time on the field, but Ancelotti explained that his starting position in the centre of the pitch was merely a defensive tactic to pressure Sergio Busquets before moving into wide areas when Madrid had the ball. ""They are his first games and he needs to learn the combinations with the other players. ""He played a good game, he worked hard for the team."" ""He didn't change positions from the wing to the centre a lot. He just looked to pressure Busquets when they had the ball and then play on the wing where there was more space."" Goals either side of half-time from Neymar and Alexis Sanchez were enough to hand Barca victory as Jese Rodriguez's reply for Madrid in stoppage time was merely a late consolation. However, Ancelotti was convinced his side should have been awarded a penalty with the score at 1-0 when Cristiano Ronaldo appeared to have been caught by Javier Mascherano inside the area. ""Naturally the penalty seems very clear to me. Everyone has seen it apart from the referee who didn't,"" he said. ""The second-half was very good. We pressured more and played more. We controlled the game and had good opportunities to score."" Ancelotti did, though, play down suggestions that Madrid could also have been awarded a penalty in the first-half for a handball against Adriano, who was already on a yellow card at the time. ""That decision is much more difficult. It was very fast and at that stage of the game it is a difficult decision to make as if he gives the penalty there may be a card as well."" Barca boss Gerardo Martino refused to get involved in the debate over the performance of the referee, but hailed his side's display in the first half as a throwback to the wonderful football they produced at times under Pep Guardiola and Tito Vilanova. ""I think generally the whole team produced a great performance in the first half. ""That was the Barca we are used to seeing, but afterwards it wasn't the same and we had to make changes. ""During 20 minutes in the second half I could see that we were too deep and giving the initiative to Madrid. We made changes to modify this and after that we counter-attacked better and had more control in the final 15 minutes."" Even in the first period. however, Lionel Messi wasn't able to dictate his usual influence on the game as he started wide on the right. ""His performance was like the rest of the team, he started very well and then dipped a bit. Apart from the defence and the great game that (Victor) Valdes played, I would evaluate everyone else as a collective. ""Messi has played many times where he played today. He worked very hard and I would give him great credit. If he, like the other big players, is able to do this then things will go well."" Victory moves Barca six points ahead of Madrid, but Martino is wary of talking up his side's advantage with just 10 games of the season gone. ""It counts more for our confidence than mathematically. There is still 70 percent of the league to go, both Madrid and Atletico are still close and they can make up that gap."""

And Costa rounded off the scoring just after the interval as he guided home Emiliano Insua's cross. Victory means Atletico, allied to Zenit St Petersburg's 1-0 win away to Porto, are well in control of Group G on nine points, five points clear of the Russians in second. However, Simeone was quick to play down suggestions that Atletico could be serious candidates to lift the European Cup for the first time come May. ""We know the difficulties that come with playing in the Champions League, especially combining three competitions with our squad,"" he said. ""It is important to interpret the game well on the field and we hope to seal our qualification at home in a few days."" Atletico were handed a huge boost before the game as Costa was passed fit and he was surprisingly partnered by Garcia with David Villa dropping to the bench. And Simeone was quick to praise the work of the club's medical staff to get Costa ready, as well as the contribution of the unsung Garcia. ""The doctors work very well with the players. ""We knew we had to impose our rhythm on them and Raul Garcia brings us a lot of strength. ""Koke and Arda (Turan) also provide a lot of service to Diego."" Simeone was vindicated with his team selection just eight minutes in when Koke released left-back Filipe Luis and he rolled the ball across goal to leave Garcia with the simplest of finishes. Costa had missed Atletico's opening two wins in the group due to a suspension hanging over from last season and La Liga's top scorer didn't waste time in making his impression on Europe's premier club competition. He collected the ball inside his own half, drove forward past one defender and then sent an unerring low finish past Heinz Lindner into the far corner. Koke and Costa could easily have added to the tally before half-time as they fired off target, but the hosts could also count themselves unlucky not to have registered before the break as Philipp Hosiner volleyed off the bar at the back post. Insua was forced into action at half-time in place of the injured Luis and the Argentine had an impact just eight minutes after the restart as he crossed for Costa to fire home his 12th goal of the season. With the game won, Simeone then withdrew Costa to keep him fresh for Sunday's league game against Real Betis and, without the Brazilian-born striker, Atletico seemed more content to preserve what they had than go in search of a fourth goal."
730,22/10/2013,22:55,Football: Three and easy for Atletico in Vienna,Atletico Madrid moved to within touching distance of the Champions League last-16 with a 3-0 win over Austria Vienna at the Ernst-Happel Stadion on Tuesday.,"Diego Simeone's men had the three points virtually wrapped up within the first 20 minutes as Raul Garcia tapped home the opener before Diego Costa ran half the length of the field to slot home and double the advantage. And Costa rounded off the scoring just after the interval as he guided home Emiliano Insua's cross. Victory means Atletico, allied to Zenit St Petersburg's 1-0 win away to Porto, are well in control of Group G on nine points, five points clear of the Russians in second. Atletico were handed a huge boost before the game as Costa was passed fit and he was surprisingly partnered by Garcia with David Villa dropping to the bench.

731,02/10/2013,23:50,Football: Ancelotti not worried about Bale fitness,Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti insisted he is not concerned about the general fitness of Gareth Bale after the Welshman missed Real's 4-0 win over FC Copenhagen due to a thigh strain.,"It is the second time in two weeks that Bale has been sidelined by a thigh problem as he also missed the league matches against Getafe and Elche. And Ancelotti hinted that he will miss Saturday's game away to Levante as well as Wales' remaining World Cup qualifiers against Macedonia and Belgium before returning after the international break. ""We are not worried, but he was not able to play today due to a small problem,"" Ancelotti told a press conference. ""The scan didn't show anything special, he has just to recover his condition because his pre-season was not so good. ""Now we have time because there is a two-week break and I think he will be ready then. ""It is normal that he is not happy because he wants to play, but it is not a big problem because he will have time to play when there is no risk of injury."" On the field Ancelotti's men put the disappointment of Saturday's 1-0 derby defeat to Atletico Madrid behind them as doubles from Cristiano Ronaldo and Angel di Maria saw them cruise to victory over the Danish champions. ""It was a good match. At the start of the game we had good intensity and our attitude was also very good. ""We changed our system a bit because we knew the team in front of us would be very compact in the centre of the pitch so we wanted to free Di Maria and Ronaldo to have more chances from crosses. ""We used the wings very well, particularly in the first and second goals."" Real's victory allied to Juventus' 2-2 draw with Galatasaray leaves Ancelotti's men in a commanding position in the group, four points ahead of the Italians in second place. And with Madrid meeting Juventus in their next two games, Ancelotti wants to secure first place in the group as soon as possible. ""I think it is important to always do the best and that includs being first in the group. ""I'm not sure it is so important in terms of playing the second-leg of the last-16 game at home, but for the confidence of the team it is important and something we want to achieve as soon as we can."""
732,01/10/2013,12:40,Football: Casillas back as Real look for European response,Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas will make his first appearance at the Santiago Bernabeu in nearly nine months when Los Blancos host FC Copenhagen in the Champions League on Wednesday.,"Casillas has lost his place in the side to Diego Lopez since breaking a bone in his hand in January, but coach Carlo Ancelotti has opted to play the Spanish number one in the Champions League and Copa del Rey. The 32-year-old has played just 15 minutes of competitive action so far this season after being forced off with a rib injury early in Madrid's 6-1 win away to Galatasaray on matchday one, but has recovered in time to take his place between the posts against the Danish champions. Despite their incredible start to their European campaign, Madrid are under some pressure to bounce back from their 1-0 derby defeat to Atletico Madrid on Saturday. That result left Ancelotti's men five points behind Atletico and Barcelona in La Liga and the Italian's tactics and substitutions were heavily criticised after Real created little of note against their city rivals. However, Cristiano Ronaldo defended his new boss afterwards and said the responsibility lies with the players to perform better. ""There are new players and new ideas, but the coach is doing a phenomenal job,"" he told reporters. ""He is a great person and a great coach. This doesn't have anything to do with him, the responsibility is ours. ""I don't think we are doing so badly, we have only lost one game, but hopefully we can improve."" Gareth Bale could also make his first start as a Real player at the Bernabeu after making his home debut as a second-half substitute against Atletico. Another former Spurs player Luka Modric is expected to come back into the side after surprisingly being dropped from the start at the weekend, whilst 20-year-old striker Alvaro Morata may finally get his chance up front ahead of the off-colour Karim Benzema. Copenhagen, meanwhile, also got their campaign off to a good start by holding Italian champions Juventus to a 1-1 draw at home two weeks ago. However, veteran defender Olof Mellberg, who enjoyed two spells in Spain with Racing Santander and Villarreal, believes they will have to play even better to take anything from the game on Wednesday. ""I expect it will be an even more difficult game than the one we played against Juventus at home,"" he told Madrid sports daily AS. ""To obtain something positive we need to play extremely well, them to have a bad day and to have a bit of luck. We need everything to go our way to get a good result."""

735,29/09/2013,18:49,Football: On-form Diego Costa set for Spain call up,Brazilian-born Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa looks set to be included in Vicente del Bosque's Spain squad for the champions decisive World Cup qualifiers against Belarus and Georgia next month.,"Costa is eligible to play for La Roja on residency grounds having lived in Spain since 2007. The 24-year-old made two appearances for his native country earlier this year in friendlies against Italy and Russia, but he can still represent Spain as he hasn't played in a competitive match at senior level. Costa has started the season in fantastic form and his eighth league goal in just seven matches was enough to hand Atletico a memorable 1-0 win over arch city rivals Real Madrid on Saturday. That goal brought him level with Lionel Messi as La Liga's top goalscorer this season and his return in front of goal has meant Diego Simeone's men have barely missed the departed Radamel Falcao. ""No one has been in contact with me, but how can I say no to a national coach?,"" Costa told Spanish TV station La Sexta. ""I hear the rumours, but it doesn't keep me awake at night. I am calm, if one day they propose something to me then I will think about it. ""Obviously it is an honour that Spain are watching me, but I am not going to go crazy about it."" Costa's time in Spain hasn't always gone so swimmingly though. After signing for Atletico in 2007 he was farmed out on loan to Celta Vigo, Albacete and Rayo Vallecano. Indeed he wasn't even a regular in the Atletico side until midway through last season, but he went onto score 20 goals in all competitions, including a strike during the Copa del Rey final as Atletico beat Real Madrid for the first time in 14 years. However, his on field demeanour has often been condemned and he is currently serving a four-match ban in European competition after being sent-off for headbutting an opponent in Atletico's Europa League match against Czech side Viktoria Plzen last season. Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari criticised the potential move last week, claiming the rules regarding eligibility were outdated. ""It is a backward rule. I remember the fifties when (Alfredo) Di Stefano played with Argentina and Spain. The same thing happened with (Jose) Alfatini and (Ferenc) Puskas,"" he said. ""The day will come when a country will contract 20 players and build a national team."" However, Scolari's reaction has been criticised in Spain with commentators pointing out that the Portugal side he managed in two European Championships and a World Cup also had two naturalised Brazilians in former Barcelona midfielder Deco and Real Madrid defender Pepe. Centre-forward is one of the few positions in which Del Bosque has struggled to find consistency of selection since the dip in form and injuries suffered by Fernando Torres and David Villa since the 2010 World Cup. Indeed, the former Real Madrid coach has more recently opted to play midfielder Cesc Fabregas in a more advanced position. However, Costa still believes it would be difficult for him to find an automatic place in the starting line-up. ""I am privileged that one day I might be able to choose between two great national teams. ""Scolari has trusted in the squad he has and Spain have their 11 starters. It is more difficult for a player that has never been called up and when you have players of the calibre of (Alvaro) Negredo, (Roberto) Soldado or Villa it is even more so."" Spain face Belarus in Palma on October 11 and Georgia four days later in Albacete knowing that four points will be enough to mathematically guarantee their place at next year's finals."

Atletico had the stroke of luck they needed 25 minutes from time though as the ball ricocheted around the Zenit area and struck Arda Turan on its way into the net. Leo Baptistao sealed the three points with his first goal for the club 10 minutes from time. ""I was delighted with the reaction of the boys after the equaliser,"" Simeone told Canal Plus. ""We had clear dominance of the game in the first-half, but we didn't have many clear chances at goal. ""They then scored and had another shot against the bar, but the team clicked at that point and we got back in front. ""We could have killed the game off earlier, but the third goal sealed it and I am very happy overall."" It was a familiar feeling for Zenit as the Russians were also beaten in Spain on matchday one last season by Malaga, but in truth they deserved little more from a disappointing display that only sparked into life for a brief spell after half-time. Atletico were without their top-scorer so far this season in Diego Costa through suspension and the Brazilian's presence was missed in the opening period as the hosts failed to make the most of their dominance in possession. Turan and David Villa saw early efforts from range easily held by Juri Lodigin before Koke prodded wide from inside the area after good work by Mario Suarez. Atletico's best chance of scoring looked like it was going to be from a set-piece and so it proved as they opened the scoring six minutes from half-time when Miranda rose highest to nod home Koke's corner. Koke nearly added a second moments later with a wonderfully curling effort from fully 30 yards that drifted just wide as Atletico finished the half strongly. However, it was roles reversed at the start of the second as after Thibaut Courtois produced a stunning save to turn Alexander Kerzhakov's header behind, Hulk fired an unstoppable effort past the Belgian from outside the area. Hulk was desperately unlucky not to add a second to his tally moments later as he fired a free-kick off the crossbar. Yet, the game swung back in Atletico's favour on 64 minutes as Turan put the hosts back in front in bizarre fashion when Konstantin Zyryanov smashed a clearance off the Turk's shins and the ball rebounded into the net. Lodigin then kept the Russians in the game with a fine save from Villa's free-kick, but Leo did make the game safe for Atletico with virtually his first touch after replacing Adrian Lopez as he collected Turan's pass and curled beautifully into the far corner."

743,25/08/2013,00:20,"Football: Barca without injured Messi, Real wait on Bale",World Player of the Year Lionel Messi will miss Barcelona's trip to Malaga on Sunday as he continues to recover from a thigh injury as Real Madrid remained poised to welcome Gareth Bale.,"Messi was substituted at half-time in Barca's 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid on Wednesday and Barca boss Gerardo Martino confirmed the 25-year-old had not been included in his squad as a precaution. ""He is developing well,"" Martino told a press conference on Saturday. ""It is just a precaution. We are optimistic, but it is just three days since the injury occurred and it would be risky to play him, especially so early in the season."" Messi's absence should mean a start for Cesc Fabregas in the false nine role he often occupies for Spain. However, Martino was tight-lipped on whether or not Neymar would be handed his first start for the club after coming off the bench to net his first Barca goal on Wednesday. ""Just because Messi isn't there doesn't mean Neymar has to take the reigns,"" said the coach. ""Neymar is improving all the time, but we need to take things bit by bit to ensure everything goes well in the end. My intention is that when he plays he is able to show all that he can do."" Real Madrid meanwhile aren't in action until Monday night when they travel to face Granada. However, it is looking increasingly unlikely that they will travel to Andalusia with Bale amongst their ranks as there was still no confirmation of his move from Spurs on Saturday. Spanish media reported that the 24-year-old had already arrived in Spain and is waiting in Marbella for the world record deal to be completed before flying to Madrid to be presented to the fans and the media in the coming days. Real will be without Xabi Alonso for up to three months after he broke a bone in his foot earlier this week and minor injuries to Sami Khedira and Asier Illarramendi mean manager Carlo Ancelotti's midfield options are limited. Meanwhile the Italian also has to decide whether to stick with Diego Lopez in goal or recall club captain Iker Casillas after he was surprisingly benched for Real's 2-1 win over Real Betis last weekend. In the night's action on the field, Real Sociedad failed to make it three wins in a week as they were held 1-1 by promoted Elche. The Basques took a huge step towards qualifying for the Champions League group stages for the first time in a decade in midweek as they won 2-0 away to Lyon. However, they were on the back foot straight away in Alicante as Ferran Coro scored the hosts first goal in the top-flight for 24 years. Sociedad improved mightily after the break though and were deservedly level 16 minutes from time when Carlos Vela turned home Xabi Prieto's cross. Espanyol moved alongside Sociedad on four points after two games as they came from behind to beat Valencia 3-1. Helder Postiga scored his first goal for Valencia against the run of play after just 10 minutes. However, David Lopez's equaliser ensured Javi Aguirre's men went in level at half-time and second-half goals from Cristian Stuani and Thievy Bifouma rounded off a fine victory for the Catalans."
744,20/08/2013,02:15,Football: Atletico's Costa backs Villa to gun down Barca,"Atletico Madrid began life without Radamel Falcao with a 3-1 win away to Sevilla on Sunday, but they face a far more daunting task against Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup on Wednesday.","A double from Brazilian forward Diego Costa overshadowed David Villa's debut for Atleti after Spain's all-time record goalscorer joined from Barca for a paltry initial fee of just 2.1 million euros ($2.8 million, £1.8 million) last month. However, Costa believes Villa will prove to be a more than capable deputy for Falcao who scored 70 goals in his two seasons with Los Rojiblancos before a 60 million euro move to Monaco in June. ""You notice the absence of Falcao because he is a great player, but we have Villa who is also a beast and we know that he is going to do just as well,"" Costa told the club's website. ""His work and commitment for the team is amazing. He is a very humble person and he has a great attitude. I think with the quality he has he will give a lot to Atletico."" Villa will be desperate to impress against his former employers after never truly getting a consistent run in the side after breaking his tibia in the Club World Cup back in December 2011. A troublesome on field relationship with Lionel Messi and Barca's capture of Neymar in June made Villa's exit from the Camp Nou somewhat inevitable. But with Champions League football and a regular starting place on offer at Atleti he has the perfect platform to show he should be Vicente Del Bosque's first-choice striking option come the World Cup next year. Under Diego Simeone's tutelage Atleti have already improved mightily and an unlikely success against the Catalans over two legs would mean a fourth trophy in little over a year. Simeone ruled out any idea of a title challenge from Atleti in the strongest terms following the Sevilla result, castigating La Liga as a ""boring"" championship that is only about two clubs. However, Barca goalkeeper Victor Valdes rejected claims that there is no competition for the big two in Spain and is expecting a tought test from Atleti. ""They showed against Sevilla that they will be a very difficult opponent. It will be another test for this Barca. ""You only have to watch how Betis played against Real Madrid, the Sevilla-Atletico game and Valencia this weekend. It will be a difficult game wherever we play."" After a dream start to his career in charge of the Spanish champions thanks to Sunday's 7-0 trouncing of Levante, Barca boss Gerardo Martino could hand Neymar his first competitive start at the Vicente Calderon. The Brazilian only made an appearance as a second-half substitute at the weekend. And while the goalscoring performances of Pedro and Alexis Sanchez may keep him on the bench once more, Spanish international duo Andres Iniesta and Jordi Alba are expected to return after also being rested by Martino following their gruelling trip to Ecuador to represent the world champions last week."
745,16/08/2013,02:10,Football: Martino bringing back Barca intensity - Xavi,"Barcelona midfielder Xavi Hernandez believes his side will rekindle their intensity and pressing under the tutelage of new manager Gerardo ""Tata"" Martino.","The Argentine was appointed less than four weeks before Barca kick off the defence of their league title against Levante on Sunday, after Tito Vilanova had to resign due to on-going health problems. However, Xavi believes the squad are adjusting well to Martino's methods and has backed the new coach to be a success despite his lack of managerial experience in Europe. ""He is a leader, capable, prepared and has experience,"" the 33-year-old told Barcelona sports daily Sport. ""He is transmitting a lot to us. We are recovering a little of the intensity and rhythm that perhaps we lost for various reasons towards the end of last season. We are pressing very well and working well physically. ""He is adding things that he is influencing a lot. For example, on set-pieces we are working differently. We are adjusting and he is a guy that is very clear about what he wants."" Martino's insistence on pressing high up the field was very evident in his only game at the Camp Nou so far as Barca destroyed Santos 8-0 in a friendly that formed part of the deal to bring Neymar to the Spanish champions. The Brazilian international will also make his competitive Barcelona debut against Levante, but World Player of the Year Lionel Messi is a doubt as he continues to recover from the quadriceps injury that forced him to miss Argentina's friendly with Italy on Wednesday. Captain Carles Puyol will definitely be absent for the Catalans after he underwent knee surgery to remove a cyst last month, but Cesc Fabregas and Pedro Rodriguez should be fit to play despite missing Spain's friendly with Ecuador in midweek due to minor injuries. Real Madrid also get their league campaign underway on Sunday with a new man in charge as Carlo Ancelotti makes his bow at the Santiago Bernabeu where Real Betis are the visitors. Los Blancos have enjoyed a superb pre-season that encompassed victories over Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Inter Milan and Ancelotti will have a wealth of midfield options to choose from following the capture of Isco and Asier Illarramendi from Malaga and Real Sociedad respectively. Arguably the most enticing fixture of the opening weekend though comes at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan where a new-look Sevilla side host Atletico Madrid. Atletico enjoyed a fantastic campaign last season as they finished third and won the Copa del Rey. As a result they will face Barcelona in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup next week and have Champions League football to look forward to. However, coach Diego Simeone has insisted it is important that his team maintain the consistency they showed in the league last season, starting on Sunday. ""We need to continue in the same way, looking for the consistency we had last season. Therefore, we can't look beyond the present and that is Sevilla,"" he told the club's website. ""We need to start again at zero and not get away from going game by game. We have had a good pre-season, especially physically, and we have been competitive."" New signings David Villa and Leo Baptistao are likely to be involved for Atleti as they try to compensate for the loss of Radamel Falcao, who joined Monaco back in June. However, the transfer activity at Atleti hasn't compared to that at Sevilla and coach Unai Emery could hand debuts to as many as 10 new recruits as the Andalusians have rebuilt following the departures of Jesus Navas, Alvaro Negredo and Gary Medel."
746,14/08/2013,11:18,Football: Diego Costa extends Atletico deal,"Atletico Madrid forward Diego Costa has extended his contract with the Spanish side for a further three years, tying him to the club until 2018.","The Brazilian scored 20 goals last season as Los Rojiblancos finished third in La Liga and claimed an historic victory over neighbours Real Madrid to lift the Copa del Rey. His performances had attracted attention from clubs around Europe with Liverpool reportedly trying to activate the buy-out clause in his previous contract with a bid in the region of 24.5 million euros ($32.5 million, £21 million) last week. However, the 24-year-old insisted that he is delighted to have extended his deal with Atleti. ""I am very happy with this deal after fighting for a long time to win the affection of the fans, my team-mates and people inside the club,"" he told the club's website. ""It is a very special moment and I am very happy here."" Costa is expected to have an even more prominent role this season as Atletico return to Champions League action after a four-year absence without their top-scorer for the past two seasons Radamel Falcao, who joined Monaco for 60 million euros back in June. Atletico get their La Liga campaign underway on Sunday night when they travel to face a new-look Sevilla side."
747,12/08/2013,02:32,Football: La Liga transfers - six to watch,Six key signings to look out for as the new La Liga season gets underway on Saturday:,"NEYMAR (Barcelona) By a distance the most discussed transfer in Spanish football this close season was Neymar's 57 million euro ($74m, £48.7m) move from Santos to Barcelona. The 21-year-old had long been linked with a move to the Spanish champions, but Barca's 7-0 two-leg humiliation at the hands of Bayern Munich in last season's Champions League semi-final accelerated the Catalans push for an extra option in attack. How Neymar combines with World Player of the Year Lionel Messi remains to be seen, but as he showed in a starring role at the Confederations Cup in June, the Brazilian international has the pace, skill and finishing ability to give Barca the reliable scoring outlet apart from Messi that they have lacked in recent seasons. ISCO (Real Madrid) Somewhat scorned by Barcelona's dominance of the Spanish national team in recent times, Real Madrid have invested heavily in two of the squad that helped Spain retain their Under-21 European Championship title in June. Isco was the first to arrive for a reported fee of 30 million euros after leading Malaga to the quarter-finals of the Champions League last season on their first participation in the competition. However, whilst the 22-year-old has shone brightly in pre-season, he may find first-team opportunities in his preferred play-making role behind a main striker limited at the Bernabeu due to the presence of German international Mesut Ozil. ASIER ILLARRAMENDI (Real Madrid) Having secured Isco, Madrid then spent 38.9 million euros to activate Illarramendi's release clause from Real Sociedad in a move intended to see the 23-year-old eventually succeed the ageing Xabi Alonso. Like Alonso, Illarramendi has a fine range of passing and is most effective playing just in front of the back four. And whilst the incredible wealth of midfield options available to new Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti may make it difficult for Illarramendi to claim a place in the side straight away, he will see plenty of minutes as Alonso is rested for the more straightforward league games later in the season. DAVID VILLA (Atletico Madrid) As soon as Neymar's move to Barcelona was confirmed it seemed inevitable that Villa would be on his way out of the Camp Nou and Atletico have arguably done the best business of the transfer window by snapping up Spain's all-time record goalscorer for an initial fee of just 2.1 million euros. Diego Simeone's side were in the market for a striker having sold Radamel Falcao to big-spending Monaco and it is hoped that a regular place in the side and playing as a central striker as opposed to the wide position he occupied at Barcelona will see Villa recover his golden touch in front of goal. Until breaking his tibia midway through the 2011-12 season, the 31-year-old had scored at least 20 league goals for 10 straight seasons and should he repeat that figure, Atletico will be well-compensated for the loss of Falcao who scored 70 goals in his two seasons in the Spanish capital. BENAT ETXEBARRIA (Athletic Bilbao) With so little money being spent by those outside the big two, the most significant transfer between two Spanish clubs not involving Madrid or Barca was Benat's return to Athletic Bilbao from Real Betis for eight million euros. The Basques were still flush with cash from the sale of Javi Martinez to Bayern Munich for 40 million euros last year and struggled mightily last season having failed to replace the Spanish international. Whilst Benat offers a lot more flair and less power than Martinez, he should make an excellent signing for Athletic with the service he provides allowing Ander Herrera, Oscar de Marcos and Iker Muniain to recover the form they showed in the 2011/12 season when Athletic reached both the Copa del Rey and Europa League finals. Benat's excellent delivery from set-piece situations will also be a handy asset as with the likes of Mikel San Jose, Kike Sola and Aritz Aduriz in their ranks, Ernesto Valderde's men will be extremely dangerous from corners and free-kicks. KEVIN GAMEIRO (Sevilla) The biggest transfer fee paid by a club outside the big two was Sevilla's capture of Gameiro from Paris Saint-Germain for a reported 10 million euros. A former French international, Gameiro had seen his playing time with the French champions severely limited by the signing of Zlatan Ibrahimovic last season but could be given a new lease of life in a very new-look Sevilla side. Spanish internationals Alvaro Negredo and Jesus Navas have both gone to Manchester City, but Gameiro should still be able to rely on decent service from Ivan Rakitic and Piotr Trochowski as he returns from nearly a year out through injury."

749,12/08/2013,02:30,"Football: Gap widens as Barca, Real spend and rest sell","Looking at the Spanish sports pages over the typically baking summer months, it would appear the Spanish game was in rude health both on and off the pitch.","In Catalonia, Neymar has dominated attention after his 57 million euro ($74 million, £48.7 million) move from Santos to Barcelona was confirmed in June, whilst, in the capital, Real Madrid backed up their 69 million euro investment in the young Spanish duo of Isco and Asier Illarramendi with an on-going pursuit of the 100 million euro rated Gareth Bale in a saga that looks set to run well into the final days of the transfer window. But beneath the big two, the game in Spain has continued to reflect the general ailing Spanish economy with even clubs in the Champions League forced to sell their best players. As a result, the already colossal gap between Real and Barca and the rest continues to increase as do fears that by continuing to use an unbalanced TV deal that greatly favours the big two, La Liga descends further into a turgid two-horse race. However, whilst both Barca and Real have been active in the transfer market, there are concerns that both have so far failed to bring in the type of players they really needed after falling at the semi-final stage of the Champions League last season. Neymar's arrival should certainly ease the scoring burden that Lionel Messi has carried almost single-handedly for the past two seasons, but the Catalans still look very threadbare at the back with captain Carles Puyol having undergone two operations during the close season and not due back till at least September. Real meanwhile have bolstered an already strong midfield, but haven't so far replaced Gonzalo Higuain after he joined Napoli last month leaving only Karim Benzema and youngster Alvaro Morata to fill the lone striker's position. There is though already a great deal more calm around Los Blancos following the departure of Jose Mourinho with the management team of Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane highly-respected by the squad and the players themselves coming together as a unit following the public clashes and fallouts that marked the Portuguese's final season at the Bernabeu. That greater unity should mean Real push Barca a great deal closer than they did last season, but the title will again be defined by small margins. Such is their dominance that firstly Real and then Barca amassed 100 points in winning the title in the past two seasons and with the gap only set to widen between them and the rest, it is highly likely whoever becomes champions will need to register a century of points once more. In the battle for Champions League places, Atletico Madrid seem the best set despite losing star man Radamel Falcao to Monaco. Atletico have arguably done the best business in terms of value for money as they replaced the 60 million euro Colombian with David Villa for an inital fee of just 2.1 million euros. Continuing an uncharacteristic period of stability since Diego Simeone took charge of the club in December 2011, Atletico are only the only club to finish in the top six last season that haven't changed manager over the close season and they are heavy favourites to be the best of the rest once more. Further down, Valencia, Sevilla, Real Betis and Real Sociedad are all likely to be in the mix for the European places despite all losing key players in recent months. Valencia have replaced new Spurs signing Roberto Soldado with a former Spurs player, Helder Postiga, for a tenth of the price they sold Soldado, whilst Sevilla have also seen two Spanish internationals depart as Jesus Navas and Alvaro Negredo have joined Manchester City. However, they will still most likely battle it out for the final Champions League place as last season's surprise package Sociedad haven't invested heavily in their squad despite the 39 million euro windfall they received from Illarramendi's departure. Betis have lost their key creative lynchpin in Benat Extebarria after he rejoined Athletic Bilbao and the Basques themselves will be hoping for a far more successful campaign than their 12th-placed finish last season following the appointment of the highly-rated Ernesto Valverde as manager."
