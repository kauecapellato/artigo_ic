0,13/02/2021,17:38,Haaland spares Dortmund blushes,A late equaliser from Erling Braut Haaland spared Borussia Dortmund's blushes on Saturday as they drew 2-2 at home against Bundesliga rivals Hoffenheim.,"Haaland's 81st minute strike averted a fourth defeat in five Bundesliga games for crisis-hit Dortmund. Yet even a draw leaves Dortmund three points adrift of the Champions League places in sixth, and heaps more pressure on interim coach Edin Terzic. Dortmund have won just four of ten league games since Terzic took the reins from Lucien Favre in December, prompting growing speculation over his future. Yet veteran defender Mats Hummels defended his coach on Saturday and backed Dortmund to revive their season. ""It's never the case that things are exactly how you want them a few weeks after a new coach takes over. That wasn't the case years ago under Jurgen Klopp, and it isn't the case now under Edin,"" Hummels told Sky. ""We're working hard, and success will come,"" he added. England international Jadon Sancho gave Dortmund a perfect start, racing up the left-wing to score his fourth league goal this season on 24 minutes. The lead didn't last long, as Munas Dabbur scuffed a shot past Marwin Hitz to level just seven minutes later. Ihlas Bebou bundled in Hoffenheim's second just after half-time, the ball bouncing off the Togolese and into the goal as Hitz tried to beat away a dangerous cross from the left wing. Haaland had a goal ruled out for offside in the second half before pouncing on a misplaced pass to snatch a crucial late equaliser. Fellow Champions League hopefuls Bayer Leverkusen also dropped points after they conceded two late goals to draw 2-2 with strugglers Mainz. Lucas Alario tapped in a low Moussa Diaby cross to give Leverkusen the lead on 14 minutes. Patrik Schick appeared to have sealed three points with a second on 84 minutes. Yet second-from-bottom Mainz were rewarded for a brave performance as late goals by Robert Glatzel and Kevin Stoeger saved a point and continued their recent revival under new coach Bo Svensson. Elsewhere, Werder Bremen were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Freiburg while Sami Khedira helped rescue a 1-1 draw for Hertha Berlin against boyhood club Stuttgart. ""It was the first time I'd ever played against Stuttgart so it was strange, but it was nice to come back,"" Khedira, who joined Hertha from Juventus in January after a decade abroad, told Sky. Austrian striker Sasa Kalajdzic headed in his ninth goal of the season to give Stuttgart the lead at the end of a scrappy first half. Veteran midfielder Khedira came off the bench in the second-half and set up a late equaliser for 17-year-old Luca Netz to save the capital club from a fifth straight defeat."
1,12/02/2021,22:01,Bayern Munich win race to sign Upamecano,"France defender Dayot Upamecano will join Bayern Munich from Bundesliga rivals RB Leipzig next season, according to reports Friday.","Both magazine Kicker and daily Bild say Bayern will pay 43 million euros ($52 million) to activate the buy-out clause in Upamecano's Leipzig contract, which runs until 2023. European champions Bayern appear to have fought off competition from Liverpool and Chelsea, who also wanted to sign the centre-back. Upamecano will replace David Alaba, 28, who is set to leave Bayern when his contract expires in June after repeatedly turning down extension offers. Bayern sports director Hasan Salihamidzic told Bild he could confirm the transfer of the 22-year-old Upamecano. ""I can and we at FC Bayern are very happy about it,"" said Salihamidzic. ""We had very good, intensive and professional talks with Dayot and his agent Volker Struth over many months. ""We knew that we had very strong competition. ""We presented him with our vision of his career at FC Bayern."" Salihamidzic said the transfer details were finalised while Bayern were in Qatar where they beat Tigres in Thursday's Club World Cup final to claim a sixth title in the last year. ""During the past week in Doha, I spoke once again with everyone involved,"" added Salihamidzic. ""At the end of a long process, players, family and management were convinced that FC Bayern is the right partner."" Upamecano started on the bench in Friday's Bundesliga match at home to Augsburg, but Leipzig sports director Markus Kroesche stopped short of confirming the transfer. ""Basically, it's a fact that he has a buy-out clause and we aren't in the driver's seat, I can't say more than that,"" Kroesche told broadcaster DAZN. He insisted that Upamecano was rested because of Tuesday's Champions League last 16, first leg tie against Liverpool in Budapest."
2,07/02/2021,22:26,Leipzig face in-form Wolfsburg in Cup quarters,"RB Leipzig will face Wolfsburg in the quarter-finals of the German Cup after Sunday's draw, while Borussia Moenchengladbach will host Borussia Dortmund in the other all-Bundesliga tie.","Leipzig are second in Germany's top division while Wolfsburg are third and on a run of five straight wins in league and cup. The other top flight side left in the competition, Werder Bremen, will travel to second-tier Jahn Regensburg as clubs eye a cup that looks much more winnable with Bayern Munich out of the way. Bayern's conquerers at the last-32 stage Holstein Kiel have been rewarded for their penalty shootout win over Darmstadt in the last 16 with a trip to Rot-Weiss Essen, who play in the fourth division. Essen will likely be no pushover however after having knocked out Bayer Leverkusen, Arminia Bielefeld and second division team Fortuna Duesseldorf in previous rounds. Quarter-final draw, matches to be played March 2 and 3: RB Leipzig v Wolfsburg Borussia Moenchengladbach v Borussia Dortmund Jahn Regensburg v Werder Bremen Rot-Weiss Essen v Holstein Kiel"

UEFA's statement thanked the two clubs ""for their close cooperation and assistance in finding a solution to the issue at hand, as well as the Hungarian Football Federation for their support and agreeing to host the match in question."" Confirmation of Budapest as hosts ended any doubt about the tie taking place after the imposition of strict entry rules in Germany to combat the spread of the pandemic. UEFA's regulations stipulated that the home side must find a way of hosting the match or risk forfeiting it as a 3-0 defeat. The decision from the German authorities on travel bans also places a question mark over another Champions League last-16 match, as Borussia Moenchengladbach host Manchester City on February 24. Introduced a week ago the new rules, slated to last until the day after the Liverpool game, ban travellers from countries hit by new, more contagious Covid-19 variants such as Britain. Budapest was chosen as a neutral venue after Bundesliga side Leipzig's request for a travel exemption for their English rivals was turned down by the German government. Though there are some exceptions for medical workers and others in key professions the new protocol contains no special provision for professional sportspeople. Liverpool's German manager Jurgen Klopp had said he believed an exemption should have been made for his side to travel."
4,05/02/2021,14:39,Liverpool's Leipzig Champions League trip to be moved to Budapest - reports,Talks are reportedly underway to hold Liverpool's Champions League last 16 first leg tie at RB Leipzig in Budapest although the German club said no decision had yet been made.,"The English club have been barred from entering Germany for the fixture on February 16 because of entry rules imposed to combat the coronavirus pandemic. UEFA's regulations say the home side must find a way of hosting the match or risk forfeiting it as a 3-0 defeat. Liverpool's German manager Jurgen Klopp said he believed an exemption should have been made for his side to travel. All Premier League sides are being tested at least twice a week with UEFA also undertaking a testing programme for teams in the Champions and Europa League. ""It's not our decision, nobody from Germany called me and asked me how is the situation in England,"" Klopp said at a press conference on Friday. ""With all the stuff we are doing here, the record we have with cases, the discipline we show with all the stuff we do, I think it would be absolutely reasonable to make an exception."" British media report that Leipzig are in discussions to host the game at the Puskas Arena in the Hungarian capital, among other options. A spokesperson from the Hungarian Football Federation told AFP it would accept a request if one was made. ""Everything is still possible but no decision has yet been made. We have to verify certain points,"" a Leipzig official told AFP on Friday. Later, Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann said he remained confident the encounter would go ahead. ""I go on the principle that the match won't be cancelled. In any case, we'll prepare as well as possible to try and play well against Liverpool,"" he said. The decision from the German authorities also places a question mark over another Champions League last-16 match, as Borussia Moenchengladbach host Manchester City on February 24. bur-dac/ilp/smr/iwd/gj/kca/pb"

According to AFP sports subsidiary SID, Leipzig are now looking for an alternative location. The Bundesliga club are set to host Premier League champions Liverpool in a Champions League last-16, first leg game but the planning for the match has been upended by Germany's recently updated travel restrictions. The new rules, slated to last until the day after the game, ban travellers from countries hit by new, more contagious coronavirus variants such as Britain. Though there are some exceptions for medical workers and others in key professions, the interior ministry has repeatedly said that there are ""no special provision for professional sportspeople"". According to German media reports, UEFA's regulations decree that Leipzig must find a way of hosting the match or risk forfeiting it as a 3-0 defeat. Potential solutions include playing the game at a neutral ground outside of Germany, or switching the home and away legs of the tie so that the first leg would be in Liverpool."
6,02/02/2021,14:07,Leipzig seek Liverpool travel exemption for Champions League tie,RB Leipzig said Tuesday that they have asked the German authorities to grant Champions League opponents Liverpool an exemption to strict new German coronavirus entry rules.,"""On Monday, we requested an exemption for Liverpool's entry into the country,"" said Leipzig spokesman Till Mueller. The Bundesliga club are set to host English champions Liverpool in a Champions League last-16 game on February 16, but the match has been thrown into doubt by a partial travel ban which Germany introduced last weekend. The new rules, slated to last until the day after the game, ban travellers from countries hit by new, more contagious coronavirus variants such as Britain. Though there are some exceptions for medical workers and others in key professions, an interior ministry spokesperson told AFP on Monday that the new rules contained ""no special provision for professional sportspeople"". Yet Mueller said Leipzig were working on a solution to the problem. ""We are of course in discussions with the authorities, with Liverpool and with UEFA,"" he said, adding that the club had filed an exemption request with the federal police. ""We hope that we receive a quick response because a lot depends on this,"" he added. According to German media reports, UEFA's regulations decree that Leipzig must find a way of hosting the match or risk forfeiting it as a 3-0 defeat. Potential solutions include playing the game at a neutral ground outside of Germany, or switching the home and away legs of the tie. Yet Leipzig club bosses insisted that they were optimistic that the game would go ahead as planned. ""It is not our aim to play the game in St. Petersburg or elsewhere,"" club director Oliver Mintzlaff told Bild. Commercial director Florian Scholz added that the club were ""working on the assumption that Liverpool can enter the country""."
7,01/02/2021,18:25,Leipzig's clash with Liverpool threatened by new German travel rules,"Germany's strict new travel restrictions have cast doubt over RB Leipzig's Champions League last 16 meeting with Liverpool, after a government spokesperson told AFP on Monday that the rules do not exempt professional athletes.","The ban on travellers from countries hit by new, more contagious coronavirus variants such as Britain contains ""no special provision for professional sportspeople"", an interior ministry spokesperson told AFP. Introduced on Saturday and in place until February 17, the new rules could scupper Premier League champions Liverpool's trip to Leipzig's Red Bull Arena the day before. Unless they are granted special exemption, Liverpool staff and players would be unable to enter Germany from Britain according to the rules. While coach Jurgen Klopp would be allowed into the country as a German national, he would have to leave most of his team behind. Germany introduced the tougher travel restrictions on certain countries in a bid to limit the spread of new coronavirus variants. The countries affected by the ban are Britain, Ireland, Portugal, Brazil and South Africa, as well as the southern African kingdoms of Lesotho and Eswatini. The entry restrictions cover arrivals by air, bus, rail and sea, and allow exceptions for medical workers and others in key jobs. Yet the interior ministry spokesperson said Monday that there would only be ""a few, narrow exemptions""."
8,29/01/2021,03:03,Hoffenheim plot new Bayern shock on Munich return,"As the architect of Bayern Munich's single defeat in 2020, Hoffenheim coach Sebastian Hoeness hopes to again down the European champions in the Bundesliga on Saturday when he returns to his former club.","Bayern host mid-table Hoffenheim at the Allianz Arena seeking revenge for September's 4-1 league defeat - their only loss of 2020 in any competition. The shock win over the European champions ""will certainly still be in our heads,"" admitted Hoeness, ""but we want to use this game to annoy Bayern again"". Bayern hold a seven-point lead in the table and are near full-strength with only Corentin Tolisso and Tanguy Nianzou sidelined. After poor results around Christmas, Hoffenheim are back up to 11th thanks to back-to-back 3-0 wins against strugglers Hertha Berlin and Cologne. However, the European champions are a huge test for Hoffenheim on Hoeness' return to Munich, where the 38-year-old coached the reserves last season having previously worked with Bayern's junior teams. A key factor Saturday is the form of Hoffenheim striker Andrej Kramaric, who has scored twice in each of his last two games. Leading the pack chasing Bayern, RB Leipzig host Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday night with both clubs eager to bounce back from defeats. After crashing 3-2 at second-from-bottom Mainz, Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann compared Bayern to Germany's high-speed ICE trains and his team to a regional train, struggling to ""catch up"". In order to get back on track, Leipzig must beat third-placed Leverkusen, who trail them by three points. ""The game has no direct influence on the title race - it's all about qualifying for the Champions League,"" Nagelsmann insisted Thursday. Leipzig welcome back Yussuf Poulsen after a groin injury, but playmaker Emil Forsberg is sidelined by a knee knock. Leverkusen, who crashed at home to Wolfsburg last weekend, are missing midfielders Julian Baumgartlinger, who underwent knee surgery on Monday, and Nadiem Amiri, who is quarantined after testing positive for Covid-19. Having slipped out of the European places to seventh, Dortmund host Augsburg on Saturday chasing a first win in four games. ""We have to correct mistakes from set-pieces,"" said caretaker coach Edin Terzic after Dortmund conceded three goals from deadball situations in a 4-2 defeat at Gladbach. Erling Braut Haaland scored twice in the Gladbach defeat, but Dortmund need him and England winger Jadon Sancho to fire their attack. ""When they (Augsburg) make mistakes, we have to be there - ice-cold,"" added Terzic. Eintracht Frankfurt, who are a point above Dortmund in the table and bouyed by a 5-1 thrashing of Bielefeld, are home on Saturday to Hertha Berlin, where Pal Dardai is back in charge. The 44-year-old replaces Bruno Labbadia, who was sacked following their 4-1 thrashing at home by Werder Bremen. Frankfurt striker Luka Jovic has scored three goals in three appearances off the bench since returning on loan from Real Madrid. Dardai predicts it could be ""5-4 or 6-5"" at Frankfurt, who ""score a lot of goals.... we're going there to score one more"". The Croatia striker scored twice in last September's 4-1 win over Bayern and has also netted two goals in Hoffenheim's recent wins against Hertha and Cologne. He is back in form after contracting Covid-19 on international duty last October which sidelined him for seven games. Kramaric will test Bayern's defence and his four goals in two games, ""speak for themselves,"" said Hoffenheim coach Hoeness. 76 - the minutes Luka Jovic has needed for three goals off the bench having been loaned back to Eintracht Frankfurt after failing to settle at Real. 18 - home league games since Bayern last lost at the Allianz Arena when Leverkusen managed a 2-1 win in November 2019. 1 - the single victory Hoffenheim has managed at the Allianz Arena, poaching a 2-1 win in Munich in October 2019.

9,23/01/2021,17:52,Leipzig slump to surprise loss at Mainz,US international Tyler Adams scored his first Bundesliga goal Saturday but RB Leipzig suffered a blow to their title hopes with a shock 3-2 defeat away to crisis club Mainz.,"Adams, 21, opened his German league account with a tap-in, pouncing on the rebound after Marcel Sabitzer hit the bar to put Leipzig ahead early on. A rare fumble from goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi allowed Moussa Niakhate to equalise for Mainz, but Marcel Halstenberg quickly restored the lead. Niakhate equalised for a second time shortly before half-time, before Leandro Barreiro turned in a Danny Da Costa cross just after the break to hand second-from-bottom Mainz only their second win this term. League leaders Bayern Munich, who play Schalke on Sunday, can now pull seven points clear at the top after third-placed Bayer Leverkusen also dropped points with a 1-0 defeat to Wolfsburg. Leverkusen started furiously, but Wolfsburg were more clinical and took the lead through a Ridle Baku header on 35 minutes. Manchester United loanee Timothy Fosu-Mensah came on at half-time for Leverkusen to make his Bundesliga debut, but his team remained toothless in the second half. The win saw Wolfsburg break into the top four, leapfrogging both Borussia Dortmund and high-fliers Union Berlin, who fell to their second defeat in a row with a 2-1 loss away to Augsburg. Florian Niederlechner broke his 16-game goal drought to put Augsburg in front on 17 minutes, before Marcus Ingvartsen drew Union level with a precise finish. Niederlechner restored the lead just after half-time, before giving away a penalty with a foul on Grischa Proemel. Yet his blushes were spared by keeper Rafal Gikiewicz, who saved Ingvartsen's spot-kick to deny former club Union a point. Union's defeat allowed in-form Eintracht Frankfurt to jump to sixth with their 5-1 win over Arminia Bielefeld. Andre Silva put Frankfurt ahead on 25 minutes, Filip Kostic doubled the lead with a sumptuous long-range effort two minutes later, and Kostic set up Silva for Frankfurt's third. Bielefeld hit back through a Sergio Cordova header, but an own goal from Joakim Nilsson and a goal from Real Madrid loanee Luka Jovic sealed the win for Frankfurt in the second half. Elsewhere, Freiburg came from behind to beat local rivals Stuttgart at home for the first time since 2012. Congolese winger Silas Wamangituka bundled in an early opener for Stuttgart, but goals from Ermedin Demirovic and Jeong Woo-yeong turned the game on its head to seal a 2-1 win for the hosts."
10,22/01/2021,03:05,Nagelsmann promises Leipzig will 'attack' Bayern in title chase,Julian Nagelsmann says his RB Leipzig team are ready to push Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich all the way this season as they prepare for Saturday's trip to lowly Mainz.,"""We're still within striking distance (of Bayern) and want to keep attacking,"" said Leipzig coach Nagelsmann. Mainz are second-from-bottom and winless in their last nine games but gave Bayern a huge scare three weeks ago, taking a two-goal lead before losing 5-2 at Munich's Allianz Arena. However, Nagelsmann says his team were ""incredibly mature"" on Wednesday against the stubborn defence of Union Berlin, which eventually cracked in Leipzig's 1-0 home win. Ten minutes into his cameo appearance on Wednesday, Emil Forsberg combined with Dani Olmo to unpick the Union defence with great footwork. Nagelsmann dubbed the pair ""phonebox kickers"" for the close-quarters skills which led to Forsberg's winning goal, and the Swede could feature at the weekend. Bayern meanwhile are at bottom side Schalke on Sunday with goalkeeper Manuel Neuer chasing a league record at his former club. On Wednesday, Neuer equalled Oliver Kahn's record of 196 Bundesliga clean sheets. But Bayern have looked vulnerable in recent weeks. They have won their last two league games, but were lucky to get a 1-0 victory at Augsburg on Wednesday after Alfred Finnbogason hit the post with a late penalty. ""We had to fight tooth and nail at the back,"" admitted Neuer after his first clean sheet in the league since October. Coach Hansi Flick admitted that ""it's been a long time"" since his side has dominated matches as much as last season, when Bayern won the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup titles. At the halfway stage of the campaign, Schalke are level on seven points with Mainz, 10 away from the guaranteed safety of 15th place. American striker Matthew Hoppe, 19, will try to test Neuer after grabbing headlines by scoring five goals in his last three games. The Royal Blues have beefed up their attack by bringing back Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. The Dutch veteran, 37, who netted 126 goals for Schalke from 2010 until joining Ajax in 2017, hopes to shake off a calf strain to face Bayern on Sunday. Leverkusen's French winger scored arguably the goal of the midweek round of matches in Tuesday's 2-1 win over Dortmund with a superb finish after Leon Bailey's diagonal pass. Great work by Diaby, 21, then put Florian Wirtz into space to score the winning goal to end Leverkusen's winless run of four league games. 22: Goals Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski has scored in 17 league games this season. At the same point of the 1972/72 season, in which Gerd Mueller set the all-time record of 40 goals, 'The Bomber' had scored 17 times. 422: Matches Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer needed to equal the league record of 196 clean sheets, set by ex-Germany keeper Oliver Kahn, who took 557 games. 4 - At 17 years, 261 days old, Leverkusen midfielder Wirtz, who is still at school, is the youngest player to score four Bundesliga goals, beating the previous records of Kai Havertz and Timo Werner, who are now both at Chelsea.

11,16/01/2021,21:03,Leipzig blow chance to knock Bayern off top of Bundesliga,RB Leipzig were left rueing their squandered chance to replace Bayern Munich as Bundesliga leaders on Saturday after being held to a 2-2 draw at Wolfsburg.,"For the second consecutive Saturday, Leipzig, who lost 3-1 last weekend at home to Borussia Dortmund, missed out on first place. ""It's tough, you always have to deliver and when you look at the other results, three points would have been great,"" Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann said. ""I am sure Leverkusen and Dortmund would say the same thing,"" he added after rivals Bayer Leverkusen lost at Union Berlin on Friday while Dortmund drew at home to Mainz. ""There are a lot of good teams in the league and you have to go to your limits each time."" Embattled Bayern, who crashed to a 3-2 league defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach and were then dumped out of the German Cup in midweek, host Freiburg on Sunday. They stay a point ahead in the table. Nagelsmann's men got off to a great start when Nordi Mukiele gave them an early lead after converting a pass from Emil Forsberg. However, Wolfsburg roared back with goals from Wout Weghorst and Renato Steffen, whose shot clipped the chest of Leipzig defender Willi Orban on its way into the net. Orban made amends when he tapped home Leipzig's equaliser in the second half. Fourth-placed Dortmund also dropped points as captain Marco Reus missed a late penalty in their 1-1 draw at home to strugglers Mainz, who climbed off the bottom. ""I could have decided the game. I am very, very sorry,"" said a crestfallen Reus, who buried his face in his shirt after firing wide from the spot 15 minutes before the final whistle. ""The disappointment is huge. We wanted to climb the table and we've missed the chance to take another step."" Defender Levin Oztunali gave Mainz the lead when he beat Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki from 20 metres just after half-time. Belgium defender Thomas Meunier equalised, but Dortmund's 16-year-old striker Youssoufa Moukoko deserved credit for keeping the ball alive in the area and providing the crucial pass. Reus fired his spot-kick wide after a foul on Meunier in the area. Later, Stuttgart got the rub of the green on their new pitch as Silas Wamangituka converted a last-gasp penalty to earn a 2-2 draw with Moenchengladbach. Nagelsmann compared their pitch to a potato field after Leipzig's 1-0 away win a fortnight ago and Stuttgart reacted by spending 150,000 euros ($181,000) on a new surface which was laid Monday. Gladbach were 2-1 up deep into added time thanks to a Denis Zakaria effort, after Lars Stindl's spot-kick had been cancelled out when Nicolas Gonzalez scored Stuttgart's 3,000th Bundesliga goal. Wamangituka converted a 96th-minute penalty after VAR ruled Stuttgart forward Sasa Kalajdzic was fouled when he backed into Gladbach defender Ramy Bensebaini. Union are so far the only top five club to win this weekend after beating third-placed Leverkusen 1-0 in Berlin. Leverkusen were the second big name to crash in the capital city after Dortmund lost at Union last month. Union's home win was overshadowed by allegations of a racist slur aimed at Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri, which the hosts are investigating. On Saturday, Union signed 19-year-old winger Leon Dajaku on loan from Bayern Munich for the rest of the season. Werder Bremen claimed their first home victory since October with late goals in a 2-0 win at home to Augsburg. Bremen winger Felix Agu, 21, celebrated his first league start by setting up Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie before sealing the points with a goal of his own. ""There is nothing better, I really enjoyed that,"" said Agu, who had played a total of 91 minutes on his three previous league appearances. Hoffenheim drew 0-0 at home to Arminia Bielefeld while Cologne against Hertha Berlin finished in a goalless stalemate, with all four teams in the bottom six places."
12,09/01/2021,20:33,Haaland hits double as Leipzig miss out on top spot,"Erling Braut Haaland netted twice on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund won 3-1 at RB Leipzig, who missed the chance to take top spot in the Bundesliga from Bayern Munich.","Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho scored his second goal in as many weeks by firing home on 55 minutes after Haaland's cross was deftly flicked into his path by captain Marco Reus. Haaland headed home a Sancho cross with 19 minutes remaining and grabbed his second goal in the 84th minute, before Alexander Sorloth scored a late consolation for Leipzig. The result means Bayern stay two points clear of second-placed Leipzig despite crashing to a 3-2 defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday, while Dortmund are five points behind the European champions in fourth."
13,08/01/2021,02:45,Dortmund hunt win at high-fliers Leipzig to rejoin title race,Borussia Dortmund are hunting a win at second-placed RB Leipzig on Saturday to get back in the Bundesliga title race while elsewhere two German league records could be equalled this weekend.,"At the top of the table, Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick can claim 100 league points in his first 39 games if the league leaders win at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday. Pep Guardiola is the only other Bundesliga coach to have reached the milestone in the same number of games after taking charge of Bayern in 2013. At the other end of the table, bottom side Schalke could equal the league record of 31 games without victory if they lose or draw at home to Hoffenheim. In Saturday night's top match, Dortmund head to Leipzig in the ""role of the hunter"", according to sports director Michael Zorc, chasing an away win to trim the eight-point gap behind leaders Bayern. A late Jadon Sancho goal sealed their 2-0 win at home to Wolfsburg last Sunday, but Dortmund are fourth after defeats to Stuttgart and Union Berlin in December dented their title hopes. Dortmund must break their habit of conceding goals at set pieces which has drawn fierce internal criticism. ""Too often we haven't played grown-up football and our style was bound to see us drop points,"" Dortmund defender Mats Hummels fumed in Sport Bild, harsh criticism caretaker coach Edin Terzic regards as ""legitimate and productive"". Up front, Dortmund striker Erling Braut Haaland needs to finish his chances after the 20-year-old fired a blank last Sunday on his return after a hip injury. Haaland's 16-year-old understudy Youssoufa Moukoko is struggling with a knee injury. Dortmund have lost five of their 14 games this season and Terzic can ill-afford to lose at Leipzig, 10 days before facing third-placed Bayer Leverkusen. ""The whole of January will set the tone for the rest of the Bundesliga season,"" Terzic admits. Leipzig are on a nine-match unbeaten run in the Bundesliga, including a thrilling 3-3 draw at Bayern last month, and their defence has only conceded nine league goals all season. Their head coach Julian Nagelsmann is ""already planning"" the club's first win over Dortmund since 2017, ""because we're brave enough, in a very good mood"" and have home advantage. Nagelsmann is missing several players as Christopher Nkunku aggravated an ankle injury in training, while new signing Dominik Szoboszlai is struggling with a groin problem. The Liverpool loanee has scored five goals in his last seven league games which has helped Union Berlin climb to fifth ahead of Saturday's home game against Wolfsburg. With Germany striker Max Kruse recovering from a knee injury, burly 23-year-old Awoniyi spearheaded Union's attack by setting up team-mate Sheraldo Becker before tapping home to seal a 2-0 win at Werder Bremen last Saturday. The Nigerian international is making an impact at Union after seven loan moves in three different countries since joining Liverpool in 2015 after winning the African Under-20 Championships. 19 - the league goals scored by Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski, who netted twice against Mainz last Sunday. Haaland is his nearest rival on 10 goals. 97 - the league points Flick has accumulated as Bayern Munich head coach in his first 38 games with 31 wins, four draws and three defeats since taking charge in November 2019. 31 - Jadon Sancho's goal against Wolfsburg was his 31st in the Bundeliga. The England winger turns 21 in March and no-one else has scored so many German league goals at such a young age. Fixtures (all times 1430GMT unless stated)"
14,02/01/2021,23:20,Olmo fires RB Leipzig top of Bundesliga ahead of Bayern Munich,RB Leipzig dislodged Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table Saturday as Dani Olmo's second-half goal was enough to seal a 1-0 win at Stuttgart.,"""It was really good for me and the team to start the year with a win,"" Olmo told DAZN. With European champions Bayern at home to strugglers Mainz on Sunday, Leipzig took the chance to go a point ahead as Olmo fired through the legs of Stuttgart goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Stuttgart's Swiss shot-stopper had earlier pulled off some heroics by using his foot to save a Emil Forsberg first-half penalty attempt. Leipzig also wasted a golden chance when Amadou Haidara fired wide just after the break. With 23 minutes left, Spain midfielder Olmo finally got the breakthrough, finishing a move he started after Leipzig had moved the ball across the Stuttgart penalty area. ""It feels good to be top,"" admitted Leipzig defender Willi Orban. ""The first half was good, the second was better - we were clearly the dominant team."" Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen blew the chance to take first place after stumbling to a 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt which saw them drop to third as the league resumed after a two-week break. ""I have made my feelings clear in the dressing room,"" Leverkusen head coach Peter Bosz told Sky. ""We deserved to lose. Frankfurt had a better claim to the victory."" Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri scored with a deft back-heel flick to give the visitors the lead after only 10 minutes in Frankfurt. However, Amin Younes equalised to make it 1-1 at half-time before Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada put in a cross which Leverkusen defender Edmond Tapsoba turned into his own net. Before kickoff, Frankfurt director Fredi Bobic confirmed reports his club are interested in Bayern's teenage striker Joshua Zirkzee, 19, after selling Dutch forward Bas Dost to Brugge. Zirkzee could back up Frankfurt's top scorer Andre Silva, who has notched nine league goals this season. Union Berlin rose to fourth - into the Champions League places for the first time in the club's history - after their 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi, who has scored in his last three league games, capped another impressive display with a goal and assist. After Bremen lost the ball in their own half, the 23-year-old Nigeria international took advantage of a two-on-two situation by drawing the defence and passing to Sheraldo Becker, who fired home on 12 minutes. Awoniyi doubled Union's lead on 28 minutes by tapping the ball over the line, just out of the reach of Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka. Bremen had a penalty appeal turned down when a shot by Japan midfielder Yuya Osako clipped the hand of a Union defender, then Romano Schmid had a goal ruled offside. Hoffenheim lost both defender Kevin Akpoguma and Germany midfielder Sebastian Rudy with early leg injuries as they crashed to a 3-1 home defeat to Freiburg. With the hosts struggling to reshuffle, Freiburg were 3-0 up at half-time thanks to a Baptiste Santamaria goal, a Vincenzo Grifo penalty and an own goal by Senegal defender Kasim Adams. Hoffenheim scored a second-half consolation goal through Togo winger Ihlas Bebou. Borussia Moenchengeladbach, who host Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 next month, earned their first win in five league games with a 1-0 victory at Arminia Bielefeld. Swiss striker Breel Embolo netted the winning goal just after half-time when he held off a defender and fired home. Mid-table Augsburg rebounded after back-to-back defeats with a 1-0 win at Cologne with Brazilian winger Iago netting the late winner. Bottom side Schalke are now 30 games without a win -- one short of the Bundesliga record -- after a 3-0 defeat away to Hertha Berlin. Former Tottenham manager Christian Gross, installed as Schalke's fourth head coach this season, got off to a losing start as Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi, Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba and his replacement, Poland forward Krzysztof Piatek, scored for Hertha. Having netted two minutes after coming off the bench, Piatek had a second late goal ruled offside."
15,17/12/2020,18:14,RB Salzburg's Szoboszlai joins sister club RB Leipzig,"RB Leipzig, who have drawn Liverpool in the last 16 of the Champions League, announced on Thursday they have signed winger Dominik Szoboszlai from sister club RB Salzburg as he becomes the 18th player to move from the Austrian side to the Bundesliga outfit.","The 20-year-old Hungary attacker reportedly cost 20 million euros ($24 million) and has signed a contract until June 2025 in a move from the teams owned by energy drink brand Red Bull. Szoboszlai had also attracted the attention of Bayern Munich and Real Madrid by scoring 26 goals, and creating 34 more, in 82 games since joining Salszburg in July 2017 from their second division feeder club FC Liefering. In August, Szoboszlai told German magazine Kicker he wanted to play in one of Europe's best leagues with ""a top five team"". After Salzburg failed to reach the last 16 of the Champions League, Szoboszlai could line up against Liverpool in Leipzig's home first leg on February 16. Leipzig's chief executive Oliver Mintzlaff said they invested the money from reaching the knockout stages to sign Szoboszlai and bring ""additional quality"" to their squad. The transfer window only opens next month, so Szoboszlai is only eligible to make his debut against Borussia Dortmund on January 9, which could pit him against his ex-Salzburg team-mate Erling Braut Haaland. The pair spent 12 months together at Salzburg in 2019, when Haaland scored eight goals in six Champions League group stage games with Szoboszlai on the left wing. Having knocked Manchester United out of the Champions League with a 3-2 home win in their final group stage game to reach the knock-out stages, Leipzig are deep in the Bundesliga title race. They earned a 3-3 draw at defending champions Bayern Munich a fortnight ago. Their 1-0 win at Hoffenheim on Wednesday leaves Leipzig third in the German league table, level on 27 points with Bayern and one behind leaders Bayer Leverkusen."

The victory left Leipzig a point clear of defending champions Bayern, who can regain first place at FC Union later on Saturday in Berlin. The home win capped a good week for Leipzig, who knocked United out of Europe on Tuesday with a 3-2 victory to reach the last 16 of the Champions League. Borussia Dortmund, also through to the knock-out stages in Europe, lost ground in the title race, dropping to fifth, after crashing 5-1 at home to Stuttgart, whose winger Silas Wamangituka netted twice."
17,09/12/2020,14:30,Manchester United scramble for answers after Champions League exit,Manchester United's third appearance in a Champions League final in four years in 2011 was proof they had established themselves as European football heavyweights.,"But their ejection at the group stage of this season's competition at the hands of RB Leipzig on Tuesday is yet more stark evidence of how far they have fallen since the Alex Ferguson era. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men battled hard last season just to qualify for the Champions League and had one foot in the knockout stages after an away win against Paris Saint-Germain followed by a 5-0 hammering of Leipzig at Old Trafford. But a shock defeat away to Istanbul Basaksehir made life difficult and a home defeat to PSG followed by the 3-2 defeat in Germany dumped them out of the competition. United now have to contemplate an unwanted run in the Europa League, Europe's second-tier competition, which they won in 2017. The three-time European champions still see themselves as continental royalty but their record over the past decade makes for grim reading. Since the 2011 final, in which they were beaten by Barcelona, the furthest they have gone is the quarter-finals, in 2014 and 2019. They have won just two individual knockout matches in the Champions League in 10 seasons. Solskjaer took responsibility for United's chastening exit in Leipzig, after his side went 3-0 down before mounting a late and ultimately fruitless comeback. ""We didn't perform as a team well enough and that's always the manager's responsibility, to get everyone ready,"" he said. ""We knew they were going to come at us, we knew they were going to put crosses in the box and unfortunately we conceded two goals and we never got going."" United were inches away from pulling off one of their trademark miracle comebacks but it was not to be. The late drama should not obscure the problems United face -- they looked disorganised at the back after switching to a back five and were outclassed by last season's semi-finalists in the first half. Captain Harry Maguire said the players had to look at themselves. ""It's a tough group but we felt we should get through,"" he told BT Sport. ""That's the standards of this club. I'm gutted for everyone, we worked so hard to reach this competition. No matter what group we got, it would be tough. We have to do more."" Former United players Rio Ferdinand and Paul Scholes, who were crucial parts of Ferguson's teams, believe United need more of an identity and want to see an end to the chopping and changing of personnel and formations. ""I think Manchester United need to have a plan, a strategy of playing consistently, so that players can start to build relationships based off of memory, based off of knowing where people are going to be on the pitch,' Ferdinand told BT Sport. 'Until you do that, you won't have sustained success. You might have the odd result, but you will not have consistency which they are lacking.' The club remain committed to Solskjaer, whose exploits as a player mean he retains great credit with supporters. But there is a sense that they are only ever one or two games from a crisis and the speculation over the Norwegian manager's future never entirely disappears. Former United defender Phil Neville robustly defended his former team-mate after the defeat. ""There are managers in the Premier league that are below Ole Gunnar Solskjaer that have got great reputations that don't get the stick that Ole gets,"" he said. ""The narrative from inside the club is far different from outside, where there just seems to be a total witch-hunt to get this boy out of a job,"" he added. One handy habit Solskjaer does have is his ability to conjure up a big result after a major disappointment. He has a chance to switch the narrative again on Saturday, at home to Manchester City."
18,09/12/2020,00:40,Solskjaer refuses to blame Champions League exit on Pogba disruption,"Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer refused to blame claims that Paul Pogba is ""unhappy"" for their Champions League exit after a 3-2 defeat at RB Leipzig.","United were punished for a slow start, conceding early goals by Manchester City loanee Angelino and Amadou Haidara before Justin Kluivert put Leipzig 3-0 up midway through the second half. United pulled back goals in the final ten minutes as Pogba came on to score a late header to make it 3-2 after Bruno Fernandes converted a penalty. In the build-up, Pogba's agent Mino Raiola said the World Cup-winning France midfielder, 27, is ""unhappy"" and needs a ""change of scene"" after struggling to establish himself under Solskjaer. Solksjaer gave a terse answer when asked if Raiola's comments had unsettled his side. ""The squad is fine, they are a team and they stick together, as soon as Paul's agent realises it's a team sport and we work together, the better,"" he said. ""That is the last thing I want to say about it,"" Solksjaer replied when asked if he had spoken to Pogba about Raiola's comments. Instead, the Norwegian blamed the defeat on his side's lethargic start. ""We didn't perform well enough as a team,"" he said. ""We knew they would come at us and put crosses in the box and, unfortunately, we conceded two goals and never got going. ""We just didn't turn up until they scored the second goal - then we started playing."" He praised his team's fightback. ""They gave their all, I can't fault anyone's effort and we were close to getting the third, which would have been an achievement against a good Leipzig side,"" he added. The 47-year-old said he needed to cure United of their habit of beginning slowly in European games. ""We didn't start until it was 2-0, which is something we need to address again, we need to manage that better,"" Solskjaer added. United face a Manchester derby at the weekend. ""As a footballer you can't feel sorry for yourself. You can do for a few minutes tonight, but that's it. We have a massive game on Saturday and we need to focus on that."" Leipzig avenged their 5-0 thrashing against Manchester United at Old Trafford in October to the delight of their coach Julian Nagelsmann. ""It wasn't easy to have had a 5-0 defeat in October, then to have to win the second game to go to the knock-out stage,"" said Nagelsmann who steered Leipzig to the semi-finals last season. ""We got the win today and I think it's deserved."""

United pulled back goals in the final ten minutes as Bruno Fernandes converted a penalty and replacement Paul Pogba scored with a deflected header, but Leipzig held on. Leipzig's victory avenged their 5-0 drubbing by United at Old Trafford in October. Man Utd manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made five changes from the side which won 3-1 at West Ham at the weekend, including Luke Shaw at left-back for his 150th appearance after recovering from a hamstring injury. Pogba, whose agent has said the midfielder is ""unhappy"" at Old Trafford, started on the bench, but his late header gave United hope in Germany. The hosts took the lead with just two minutes gone as Marcel Sabitzer's cross-field pass was met by left-back Angelino and his left-foot strike flew past David de Gea. The United goalkeeper was beaten again on 13 minutes when Haidara finished a move he started by volleying home. It could have been 3-0 moments later when Emil Forsberg fired wide from close range with the goal at his mercy. A speculative Mason Greenwood header and a half-chance by Marcus Rushford were all United produced in the opening half hour. Leipzig had a goal disallowed when Ibrahima Konate headed onto the post and Willi Orban tapped home only to ruled offside by VAR. United tightened their defence in the second half with Donny van de Beek replacing left winger Alex Telles, while Pogba came on for the final half hour. United threatened as Fernandes fired wide and then hit the post, just before more poor defending allowed the hosts to grab their third goal. Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann boosted his attack by bringing on forwards Yussuf Poulsen and Kluivert, who snapped up a Sabitzer cross and chipped De Gea with 69 minutes gone. There was drama in the closing stages after Konate brought Greenwood down and Fernandes converted the penalty on 80 minutes. Pogba then met a Fernandes deep corner unmarked at the far post and his header deflected off Konate to make it 3-2 on 82 minutes, but Leipzig held on in the tense closing exchanges."

23,07/12/2020,14:24,Nagelsmann backing buoyant RB Leipzig to see off Man Utd,RB Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann says his confident side can seize their chance in Tuesday's key Champions League match at home to Manchester United with only the victors assured of a last 16 berth.,"""I'm not sure for whom the situation in the group is psychologically worse,"" said Nagelsmann. ""Manchester were first in the group for a long time, now they can be eliminated with one game. ""We have fought our way back and can still make it through on our own terms."" Ahead of Tuesday's final round of matches, leaders Man Utd, Paris Saint-Germain and third-placed Leipzig are all on nine points in Group H. However the Germans have the worst goal difference, due mainly to their 5-0 thrashing at the hands of Man Utd at Old Trafford in October. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's United had looked certain to reach the last 16 after an impressive win at Paris Saint-Germain followed by their home rout of Leipzig. However, United's shock loss away to Istanbul Basaksehir threw the group open. Last week's 3-1 home defeat to Paris Saint Germain set up a tense final round of games. Leipzig boosted their last 16 hopes with a last-gasp 4-3 win at Basaksehir and then gained a 3-3 draw at Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday. ""It gives us a good feeling. We know we can keep up with teams at this level,"" Nagelsmann added. RB Leipzig, backed by Austrian energy drinks giants Red Bull, want to be a regular fixture in the last 16 of the Champions League. After last season's run to the semi-finals, it would hurt the ambitious German club to bow out in the group stages with a home defeat. ""We are up for it. I am convinced that when we have a great match plan again - we can beat Manchester,"" said Leipzig captain Marcel Sabitzer. Having scored with a brilliant header against Bayern last Saturday, playmaker Emil Forsberg says Leipzig are ""in a good mood and hungry"". They will be without key defender Dayot Upamecano, who is suspended. Despite facing Bayern and United inside three days, Nagelsmann insists his side can cope. ""We're not whining about it,"" said the 33-year-old. ""You don't have to tell the players that they are tired, you have to tell them that they are machines. And they are,"" he added with a grin."
24,07/12/2020,10:56,Comeback kings Man Utd brace for Leipzig Champions League decider,Manchester United will travel to RB Leipzig for Tuesday's Champions League match confident they can reach the knockout stages but knowing they have made life unnecessarily hard for themselves.,"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team looked certain to ease out of the group phase after an impressive win at Paris Saint-Germain followed by a 5-0 hammering of RB Leipzig at home. But a shock defeat away to Istanbul Basaksehir threw Group H wide open and last week's home reverse against PSG leaves the French champions, United and Leipzig locked together on nine points. United need just a draw at the home of the German team, who are third in the Bundesliga. That would take them through on the basis of a superior head-to-head record. The three-time European champions can take heart from their striking away form this season, with the exception of their ill-fated trip to Turkey. They have won all five of their Premier League away games, taking their total of consecutive league wins on the road to a club-record nine. But United, desperate to re-establish themselves among the European elite, have also made a habit of getting themselves into difficulty -- they have trailed in every away game in the top-flight this season. Saturday's match at West Ham was no different. Solskjaer's men were 1-0 down at half-time and could have been further behind before a stirring second-half comeback. Paul Pogba, Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford all scored in a 3-1 win at the London Stadium that took the team, at least temporarily, into the top four of the Premier League. ""The boys now have the belief and the confidence that we can turn things around,"" said Solskjaer. ""You don't panic. ""Yeah, we were under pressure before half-time, and half-time came at a good time for us. We had to clear our heads and go again. We've done it too often now to be a coincidence, those comebacks. ""It's in these boys and in this badge. Of course you are very happy with the away form and how we're performing."" United have enviable firepower in their ranks and can be devastating on the break but the feeling remains that they are rarely in total control of their destiny. The Norwegian boss has a decision to make in midfield, with Fred absent after a red card in the defeat to PSG. Bruno Fernandes is the key man creatively, as he showed again at West Ham, creating eight chances after coming on at half-time. Does Solskjaer stick with Pogba, who has been a peripheral player this season? Does he throw in Nemanja Matic alongside Scott McTominay to give greater defensive ballast? Or can he find room for all three? There are also potential issues up front, with both Anthony Martial and Edinson Cavani withdrawn during the West Ham victory with niggles. Leipzig, last season's Champions League semi-finalists, will likely need to win to progress from Group H, because PSG are expected to beat Basaksehir. That could play into United's hands, giving them space to exploit. But they cannot afford to produce a display as limp and disjointed as they did in the first half against West Ham. McTominay said it was important to put last month's hammering of Leipzig out of their minds. ""The result at home is completely out of the equation now,"" the Scotland midfielder told MUTV. ""We forget about that. It's a game where we have to go and win. It's a game where you can't just go there and play for a point. You have to go and approach it like you want to win that football match and that's definitely what we're going to do."""

""We knew before the game that we could come back, but the fact we had to do it was news to us,"" said Mueller. ""At the end of the day, we can live with the result."" Christopher Nkunku's early goal for Leipzig was cancelled out by a superb equaliser from Jamal Musiala, 17, before Mueller tapped home to put Bayern 2-1 up. However, the lead lasted barely a minute as Justin Kluivert -- son of former Dutch star Patrick Kluivert -- levelled before half-time with his first goal for Leipzig. A thumping Emil Forsberg header from an Angelino cross put visitors Leipzig 3-2 ahead soon after the break. Bayern took a share of the points when Kingsley Coman produced a towering cross -- his third assist of the night -- for Mueller to head home the equaliser on 75 minutes. ""That really was a top game between two teams who really wanted to win,"" said Forsberg. ""It was awesome to be out there on the pitch - you live for games like that."" The result leaves Bayern two points clear at the top and Leipzig still waiting for a first win in Munich, after five attempts. Earlier, Borussia Dortmund dropped more points as they laboured to a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt with star striker Erling Braut Haaland sidelined. The result left Dortmund third in the table, four points behind Bayern. After suffering a shock 2-1 home defeat last weekend against struggling Cologne, Dortmund missed the finishing of top scorer Haaland, who is out until January with a leg injury. Dortmund's defence was caught napping when they conceded an early goal by Frankfurt's Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada. Dortmund raised their tempo and equalised with a superb strike from 18-year-old US forward Giovanni Reyna, but they failed to breach the Frankfurt defence again despite finishing the stronger. Borussia Moenchengladbach, who will try and clinch a place in the Champions League last 16 next week away to Real Madrid, drew 2-2 draw at Freiburg, where they have not won since 2002. Gladbach went ahead when Swiss striker Breel Embolo netted with an excellent first-time shot on 23 minutes. Freiburg equalised with a header by defender Philipp Lienhart and then took the lead just after the break when Vincenzo Grifo converted a penalty. Gladbach levelled when Alassane Plea hit the top corner of the net with a wonderful curling shot on 50 minutes. The result leaves Freiburg 14th, a point from the bottom three, while Gladbach are seventh and are seven points behind Bayern. Having ended their 18-match winless run by shocking Dortmund 2-1 last weekend, Cologne backed it up with a 2-2 draw at home with Wolfsburg to climb to 15th. Cologne's 18-year-old striker Jan Thielmann opened the scoring, but Maximilian Arnold equalised with a magnificent free-kick. Winger Ondrej Duda restored Cologne's lead when he shot into the corner on 43 minutes, but Wout Weghorst rescued a point away for Wolfsburg just after the break. Cologne are only out of the relegation places on goal difference while Wolfsburg are fifth. Arminia Bielefeld earned their first win since September with a 2-1 victory at Mainz, although both clubs remain in the bottom three. Sixth-placed Union expect to be without in-form striker Max Kruse for the foreseeable future after the 32-year-old injured his hamstring in Friday's 3-1 derby defeat at Hertha Berlin. Kerem Demirbay will miss Bayer Leverkusen's game at bottom side Schalke on Sunday after the midfielder was quarantined after testing positive for Covid-19. The rest of the Leverkusen squad have returned negative tests, the club confirmed."

""In some situations, Bayern don't seem quite as keen, no longer quite as focused,"" due to this season's dense fixture list, Nagelsmann said on Friday. Nagelsmann's men then host Manchester United on Tuesday with a last 16 place in the Champions League at stake. First up, Leipzig will try to earn their first win in Munich at the fifth attempt having yet to score at the Allianz Arena. Leipzig can usurp Bayern as league leaders, ""but that doesn't mean we are on an equal footing,"" insisted Nagelsmann. ""We have a good plan, the boys are up for it, but it will still be very difficult,"" Nagelsmann added. Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski, who has already scored 15 goals this season, and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer were both rested for Tuesday's 1-1 draw at Atletico Madrid in preparation. Leipzig striker Alexander Sorloth, who turns 25 on Saturday, is chasing his first Bundesliga goal after finally ending his drought in the Champions League. After 10 games without finding the back of the net, the Norway forward was hugely relieved to claim Leipzig's last-gasp winner at Basaksehir Istanbul on Wednesday. ""Basically, it would be nice if he could score another one,"" added Nagelsmann after Sorloth had a penalty attempt saved in last weekend's home win against Arminia Bielefeld. Curiously on their four previous games at the Allianz Arena, Leipzig lost 3-0, 2-0 and 1-0 before holding Bayern to a goalless draw in Munich last February. ""When you follow it logically, it could be that we will win,"" joked Nagelsmann. The 33-year-old was full of praise for counterpart Hansi Flick and said he was ""a very, very fine bloke."" He steered Munich to last season's treble, but says Leipzig can not afford to have too much respect for the Bavarians. ""We want to be courageous and take something from the game - the best case is three points, but you can't guarantee that especially against with the record champions."" In Munich, Flick returned the compliment by praising Nagelsmann, who took Leipzig to the semi-finals of the Champions League in August. Leipzig have ""gone through an unbelievable development"" and under Nagelsmann's stewardship they ""play very variable football. I value him very much as a coach,"" said Flick."
27,04/12/2020,03:00,Buoyant Leipzig out to make history at Bayern Munich,RB Leipzig chase a first away win at Bayern Munich in Saturday's top-of-the-table Bundesliga clash after being buoyed by their last-gasp winner in the Champions League.,"Alexander Sorloth's last-minute goal sealed a 4-3 win at Basaksehir Istanbul on Wednesday and Leipzig can reach the last 16 by beating Manchester United at home next Tuesday. Before that, second-placed Leipzig are chasing a first away win over Bayern at the imposing Allianz Arena, where the Bundesliga leaders have not lost for a year in any competition. Bayern hold a two-point gap over Leipzig in the league. ""It's going to be an awesome game,"" prophesied midfielder Emil Forsberg, ""we want to take something from there."" Since reaching the Bundesliga in 2016/17 after rising from Germany's fifth tier, Leipzig have beaten Bayern once in 10 games and never away. The last three league meetings all ended in draws. ""I can't remember the last time we drew three times in a row against a Bundesliga side - that's proof that it won't be easy for us,"" said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. ""We're at home, we want to win to defend our lead at the top of the table, so we're taking it very seriously,"" he added. On their last four visits to the Allianz Arena, Leipzig lost 3-0, 2-0, 1-0 and then held Bayern to a goalless draw in February. ""If you follow the sequence logically, then it could be that we will win,"" said Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann with a grin. Having already won 3-2 at Borussia Dortmund in last month's top-of-the-table clash, Bayern have a chance to see off another rival. Captain Manuel Neuer and striker Robert Lewandowski were rested for Tuesday's 1-1 draw at Atletico Madrid with Bayern already through to the last 16 of the Champions League as group winners. However, Nagelsmann is unhappy that there is barely a three-day gap between facing Bayern and Man Utd, ""at some point it will catch up with us"". Borussia Dortmund are already feeling the effects of a constant stream of fixtures ahead of Saturday's away match at Eintracht Frankfurt. After last weekend's shock 2-1 home defeat loss to Cologne, Dortmund need to bounce back with a first win in Frankfurt for seven years. Dortmund trail Bayern by four points in the table and expect star striker Erling Braut Haaland to be sidelined until January with a leg injury. Haaland sat out Wednesday's 1-1 draw at home to Lazio, in which defender Mats Hummels had to be helped off with an ankle injury. England midfielder Jude Bellingham was also left limping, while defender Thomas Meunier and midfielder Emre Can were already sidelined with knocks. On Sunday, third-placed Bayer Leverkusen can inflict more misery on bottom side Schalke who are on a 25 match winless streak, inching towards the league record of 31 games without a win. The Norwegian striker was flooded with relief after ending his goal drought by scoring Leipzig's crucial winner in Istanbul on Wednesday. Sorloth admitted ""it was pure emotion, that was a very important goal"" both for him and his club. Having cost 20 million euros ($24 million) from Crystal Palace in September to replace Timo Werner, Sorloth had drawn a blank in his previous ten Leipzig games. After netting 24 times in 34 games on loan at Turkish side Trabzonspor last season, Sorloth could mark his 25th birthday this Saturday with a goal past Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. 22 - the goals Bayern Munich have scored in ten games against RB Leipzig, who have managed 12. 7 - the goals Robert Lewandowski has scored for Bayern in ten games against Leipzig. 10 - out of Dortmund's 21 league goals this season scored by Haaland, who is expected to sit out their next four Bundesliga games.

28,02/12/2020,21:08,Sorloth grabs dramatic late winner for Leipzig,"Alexander Sorloth's stoppage-time strike gave RB Leipzig a dramatic 4-3 win over Istanbul Basaksehir in a remarkable Champions League game on Wednesday, as the Germans piled pressure on group rivals Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain.","Irfan Can Kahveci's superb hat-trick looked to have rescued a draw for Basaksehir as they came back from 3-1 down to draw level, but Norwegian striker Sorloth came off the bench to lash in the winner in the second minute of added time. The result leaves Leipzig on nine points in Group H, level with United and three ahead of PSG before those sides kicked off at Old Trafford later. It means that, whatever happens there, Leipzig will qualify for the last 16 if they beat Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side at home in their final match next week. ""It was a crazy game,"" said Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann after Sorloth scored his first goal since signing for Leipzig from Crystal Palace for a reported 20 million euros ($23 million) as a replacement for Chelsea-bound Timo Werner. ""In the first half we were very good, we had 12 shots on goal, but over the course of the game, the second half didn't necessarily mean that we looked like winners. It was a lucky victory."" Semi-finalists last season, Leipzig had already lost 5-0 in Manchester and 1-0 in Paris in this season's competition, but they were well on top in the early stages in Istanbul and were rewarded as Yussuf Poulsen diverted in Marcel Sabitzer's shot for the opener. Nordi Mukiele then doubled their lead with the interval approaching, although Kahveci curled in a fine goal from the edge of the box to reduce the deficit in first-half stoppage time. Still Leipzig looked to be cruising to victory when Dani Olmo made it 3-1 in style midway through the second half, but Turkish international Kahveci pulled another one back and then, after Poulsen struck the post at the other end, he completed his hat-trick from a free-kick with five minutes remaining. However, Sorloth -- who was the top scorer in the Turkish Super Lig last season on loan at Trabzonspor -- saved the day for Leipzig with a goal that would not have been warmly received in Manchester. In Wednesday's other early kick-off, Krasnodar beat Rennes 1-0 in Russia, with Marcus Berg scoring the only goal. Both sides were already eliminated from Group E with Sevilla and Chelsea through, but Krasnodar's victory means they will parachute into the Europa League and winless Rennes will not be involved in European football at all in the new year."
29,28/11/2020,17:41,Lewandowski hits 15th goal of season as Bayern Munich stay top,Robert Lewandowski claimed his 15th goal this season in all competitions as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich came from behind to claim a 3-1 win at Stuttgart on Saturday.,"After 19-year-old striker Tanguy Coulibaly gave Stuttgart a shock early lead, Kingsley Coman equalised before Lewandowski drilled home from 20 metres to put Bayern 2-1 up at the break. Brazil winger Douglas Costa, a second-half replacement for Coman, grabbed Bayern's third goal late on to seal the win which leaves the holders two points clear of RB Leipzig. Dortmund are third, four points behind Bayern, after crashing to a shock 2-1 defeat at home to Cologne, as Leipzig climbed above them thanks to a 2-1 home win over Arminia Bielefeld. Cologne avoided a club record 19th match without a win with their first victory in Dortmund since 1991."
30,27/11/2020,03:05,Tension gets to Tuchel at crunch point in season for PSG,"Paris Saint-Germain are in their usual position on top of Ligue 1 but, with their Champions League hopes still in the balance, their coach Thomas Tuchel has been letting the tension get to him.","The German appeared particularly agitated as he spoke after PSG's 1-0 win over RB Leipzig on Tuesday, a crucial victory in the context of their European campaign but one that came in another unconvincing performance from last season's Champions League runners-up. ""You always ask me the same thing. If you have the balls to do that, why don't you go into the dressing room and say it to the players,"" an angry Tuchel said in response to one question about the quality of PSG's display against the Germans. ""I am tired of always having to answer to these expectations."" Tuchel's exasperation is partly understandable, given PSG still have qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League in their hands and are two points clear at the top of Ligue 1 despite being plagued by injuries, suspensions and coronavirus infections this season. The run to last season's Champions League final also makes him a difficult man to sack, but he is out of contract after this campaign and any chance of him signing a new deal appears slim. It needed a soft penalty converted by Neymar, and poor finishing from their opponents, for PSG to beat Leipzig, but they face Manchester United at Old Trafford next Wednesday and a defeat there could still leave them staring at a group-stage exit from the Champions League for the first time since the Qatari takeover of 2011. Given the nature of their performances recently, it is not easy to imagine them winning that game, and their domestic displays could even offer a glimmer of hope to the teams below them. The reigning champions lost 3-2 at Monaco last weekend and they are two points above second-placed Lille before hosting mid-table Bordeaux on Saturday. Marco Verratti could get a run-out for Paris after injury with a view to the Italian featuring at Old Trafford, but the likes of Juan Bernat, Idrissa Gana Gueye and Julian Draxler are all still injured. The story goes that as a kid Dia was on his way to a trial at Saint-Etienne when his father's car broke down, while Lyon rejected him for being too small. He seemed to have given up on a football career as he worked as an electrician, while a trial in Wales did not work out. But Dia signed his first professional deal with Reims in 2018 and, having recently turned 24, he has developed into one of the stars of the Ligue 1 season so far. Dia, who was born in France but recently made his international debut for Senegal, has eight goals in nine league games for Reims. All of his goals have come away from home, and on Sunday he goes back to Lyon as a player now very much in the spotlight. 3 - PSG have suffered three defeats in their first 11 Ligue 1 games this season, their most at this stage of a season since the Qatari takeover of 2011 that transformed the club. 50 - Neymar's next Ligue 1 goal will be his 50th. He has so far scored 49 times in 57 Ligue 1 games for PSG. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is currently the quickest PSG player to get to 50, having done so in 59 matches. 13 - Marseille this week set a new record for the most consecutive defeats in the Champions League. Their 2-0 home loss to Porto made it 13 losses in a row stretching over three campaigns."
31,24/11/2020,23:30,Neymar keeps PSG on course in Champions League with Leipzig win,A nervy Paris Saint-Germain were outplayed for long spells but held on after an early Neymar penalty to beat RB Leipzig 1-0 on Tuesday and revive their Champions League campaign.,"Last season's runners-up had lost two of their opening three matches in Group H and would have been staring at an early exit from the competition had they lost again to the Germans behind closed doors at the Parc des Princes. Yet Neymar's 11th-minute spot-kick proved enough for a PSG side struggling with injuries and suspensions, as Leipzig failed to convert any of the chances that came their way. ""We are a team who, in the difficult moments, manage to stick together and do a good job. Once again we proved that,"" captain Marquinhos told RMC Sport. Both PSG and Leipzig are now level on six points with two games still to come, with Manchester United three points clear at the top of the section after easing to a 4-1 victory over Istanbul Basaksehir. Crucially, PSG have the head-to-head advantage over Leipzig, thanks to an away goal, if the two teams end level on points. They lost 2-1 when the teams met in Germany three weeks ago. Thomas Tuchel's team go to Old Trafford next and the feeling is that the French champions could still just as easily advance to the last 16 in first place as they could fail to qualify at all. They brushed Leipzig aside in the semi-finals of last season's competition in Lisbon in August but collapsed worryingly in their last meeting with Julian Nagelsmann's team after taking an early lead. Here they again went in front and then succeeded in seeing the game out despite struggling desperately to maintain possession and stop the waves of Leipzig attacks. ""There are lots of things that happen that people maybe don't know about,"" insisted Marquinhos, with PSG having struggled with injuries, suspensions and coronavirus infections all season. Here they were without as many as six first-team regulars. ""I don't think we had the means to put in an exceptional performance, but the most important thing was the victory."" The decisive spot-kick was awarded when Marcel Sabitzer was rather harshly adjudged to have fouled Angel di Maria. Neymar stepped up to roll the ball home from 12 yards for his first Champions League goal of the season on what was his first start in almost a month after injury. Alongside him, Kylian Mbappe saw his European goal drought go on -- Ligue 1's leading scorer has still not scored a Champions League goal in 2020 in eight appearances. Nevertheless, PSG did not need their French World Cup-winning superstar to be at his best as Leipzig -- who have not managed to replace Timo Werner since the Germany striker left for Chelsea -- were unable to turn their dominance of possession into goals. Dayot Upamecano saw his header tipped over by Keylor Navas and Emil Forsberg turned a Dani Olmo cross over the top in the first half. The pressure continued at the start of the second half, but Forsberg and Sabitzer notably missed the target and the chances dried up after the home side reverted to a three-man central defence in the closing stages."
32,23/11/2020,16:22,Injury-hit PSG look for Mbappe to get back among goals in Champions League,Paris Saint-Germain continue to be plagued by injuries but coach Thomas Tuchel is optimistic the fit-again Kylian Mbappe can make the difference in Tuesday's vital Champions League encounter with RB Leipzig.,"PSG host the German club at the Parc des Princes having lost two of their opening three matches in Group H. Beaten 2-1 in Leipzig three weeks ago, another defeat here could push last season's Champions League runners-up to the brink of elimination in the group stage for the first time since the Qatari takeover of the club in 2011. Mbappe missed the defeat in Germany because of a hamstring injury, but returns here looking to end a run of seven Champions League games without a goal in 2020. Neymar is also expected to start after the world's most expensive player made his return from several weeks on the sidelines as a substitute in Friday's 3-2 defeat by Monaco in Ligue 1. ""If 'Ney' and Kylian don't score then it has a big impact on us. They are decisive boys and I hope he (Mbappe) will be able to score tomorrow,"" said Tuchel when asked about the form of the France striker in Europe. Mbappe is fresh from scoring twice in the 3-2 defeat in Monaco, making him the leading scorer in Ligue 1 with nine goals from just seven appearances and taking him to 99 goals in total for PSG since signing for the club in August 2017. ""We need goals and we need him to put in a big performance, and I get the feeling he is ready. He played for France and then he scored against Monaco, so now is the time for him and 'Ney' to be decisive again,"" added Tuchel. Injuries and suspensions have hampered the French champions ever since the season started and will do so again at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday. Mauro Icardi, Julian Draxler, Idrissa Gana Gueye and Thilo Kehrer are all on the sidelines along with Spanish left-back Juan Bernat, who is recovering from a knee operation and last week told AFP he hoped to be back by ""February, or mid-March"". Midfield duo Marco Verratti and Ander Herrera were on Monday rated as doubtful by PSG. Centre-back Presnel Kimpembe is suspended after being sent off in Leipzig last time out."
33,21/11/2020,23:11,Haaland scores four as Dortmund cut Bayern's lead,Erling Braut Haaland netted four goals and Youssoufa Moukoko became the youngest player in Bundesliga history on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund routed Hertha Berlin 5-2 to trim Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the table to just a point.,"It was the first time the 20-year-old Haaland had scored four goals in a game for Dortmund since his January debut, with all of them coming in the second half. ""I drank a Red Bull at half time, I got some wings and everything was good,"" said Haaland. The Norwegian now has 10 goals in seven Bundesliga matches this season to give him a total of 31 goals in 30 games in all competitions for Dortmund. After Matheus Cunha gave Hertha a first-half lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, Dortmund roared back. Haaland equalised when he tapped home an Emre Can pass on 47 minutes. He grabbed his second two minutes later with perfect timing to slip his marker and fire in a Julian Brandt pass. Haaland wrapped up his hat-trick on 62 minutes, just before Raphael Guerreiro stabbed the ball home from close range to make it 4-1. Cunha converted a late penalty, but the night belonged to Haaland who finished a move he started with 10 minutes to play. There was still time for history to be made as Moukoko made a late cameo off the Dortmund bench to replace Haaland. One day after his 16th birthday, Moukoko is the youngest player in Bundesliga history. ""He's only just turned 16 -- that is amazing,"" Haaland said of Moukoko. ""He has a big career ahead of him."" Dortmund's romp in Berlin moved them second in the standings, behind defending champions Bayern who stayed top despite a 1-1 home draw with Werder Bremen. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer produced great stops to twice deny US forward Josh Sargent as Bremen earned their first point at Bayern for a decade. ""We had to invest a lot,"" Neuer told Sky. The 34-year-old bounced back after conceding six goals in Germany's crushing defeat by Spain in midweek with two brilliant first-half saves in quick succession. He used a boot to block a Sargent shot, then lunged across goal to save from Ludwig Augustinsson. In the dying stages, Neuer then stood tall to block a shot by Sargent, who had broken clear. Bayern coach Hansi Flick was far from pleased that Bremen took the lead in his 50th game in charge, saying his team ""have to defend better"". Bremen deservedly went ahead just before half-time when midfielder Maximilian Eggestein finished off a superb attack. ""We conceded a very cheap goal, that's how Bremen's plan worked and they defended very well,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. Kingsley Coman equalised in the 62nd minute at the Allianz Arena by meeting a Leon Goretzka cross at the far post. Bayern forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting fired over with the goal at his mercy five minutes from time. However, Neuer's heroics at the other end preserved the draw. Bayer Leverkusen are third after their 2-1 win at strugglers Arminia Bielefeld thanks to Aleksandar Dragovic's late winner. The victory was a relief for Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, who scored a embarrassing own goal early in the second half. Leverkusen were 1-0 up thanks to a Leon Bailey goal when Hradecky sliced a clearance, which rolled into the empty net behind him. Dragovic stabbed home from close range two minutes from time to spare Hradecky's blushes. RB Leipzig sit fourth after Yussuf Poulsen came off the bench and produced a deft second-half volley in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt after winger Aymen Barkok gave the hosts an early lead. Despite having seven players quarantined with the coronavirus, a depleted Hoffenheim drew 3-3 at home with Stuttgart. Schalke's winless run stretched to 24 league games, dating back to January, after losing 2-0 at home to Wolfsburg. A Daniel Caligiuri equaliser two minutes from time gave 10-man Augsburg a 1-1 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach."
34,20/11/2020,11:29,Neymar back for PSG ahead of Champions League resumption,"Neymar is set to return from injury for Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1 on Friday with a view to facing RB Leipzig in a crucial Champions League match next week, the club said.","The Brazilian, who has been sidelined since injuring a thigh muscle against Turkish club Basaksehir in the Champions League on October 28, came through a training session with the PSG squad without any problems on Thursday. Coach Thomas Tuchel said on Thursday that Neymar could play ""a few minutes"" against Monaco. The injury ruled him out of Brazil's World Cup qualifiers during the international break. PSG, last season's beaten finalists, need to beat Leipzig at home on Tuesday to remain in contention to qualify for the knockout stage. Kylian Mbappe is also back in the PSG squad for the visit to the principality despite being troubled by injuries since the start to the season. Italian pair Marco Verratti and Mauro Icardi are still not ready to return from injury but PSG coach Thomas Tuchel said he was hopeful they would be available for selection against Leipzig. Reigning champions PSG are top of Ligue 1 despite losing two games during a rocky start to the campaign."
35,16/11/2020,17:04,Haaland's Dortmund set to defy Norway isolation order,"Dortmund, Leipzig and Hertha Berlin look set to defy a call for 10 days of self-isolation for their Norwegian players, including Dortmund's Erling Haaland, after a member of the national squad tested positive for Covid-19.","Adhering to the request from the Norwegian football federation would prevent Haaland from playing for Dortmund on Saturday, as it would do too for Leipzig striker Alexander Sorloth and Hertha Berlin goalkeeper Rune Jarstein. Norway full-back Omar Elabdellaoui tested positive at the weekend prompting Norway to cancel their trip to Bucharest to play Romania, and UEFA then cancelled the game. There is a 10-day self-isolation strategy in Norway, but the Bundesliga clubs are suggesting that once the players are back in Germany they are subject to local protocol. The football federation in Norway says their players have all signed written documents promising to follow their code. ""German law applies on German soil,"" Dortmund insisted Monday, who travel to Berlin to play Hertha on Saturday. Hertha Berlin explained their position in local law terms ""once Rune has returned two negative tests he'll be back with the group"". RB Leipzig are voicing a similar argument. Meanwhile the Scandinavians have assembled an entire new squad including 13 uncapped players for Wednesday's match against Austria in Vienna that Norway must win to finish top of their Nations League group."
36,12/11/2020,14:13,RB Leipzig branch into India by partnering ISL side FC Goa,Last season's Champions League semi-finalists RB Leipzig are branching into India after announcing on a three-year partnership with Indian Super League (ISL) side FC Goa on Thursday.,"The Red Bull-backed German club have been in talks since 2018 with Goa, who finished top of the ISL league last season, but lost in the play-offs. The deal, which runs until June 2023, includes holding football training camps for young players in India, which for the moment may have to happen online due to the coronavirus pandemic. It also involves the training of coaches and exchange of know-how regarding club structures. FC Goa co-owner and president Akshay Tandon said Leipzig are the ""perfect partner"" given their experience of climbing the German football pyramid since their formation in 2009. ""They have shown the world of football how to build from the ground up... and that's something we resonate with,"" he added. Leipzig's CEO Oliver Mintzlaff hinted that the partnership could result in an Indian player coming to Germany ""at some point"". RB Leipzig shook up German football by climbing from the fifth tier to reach the Bundesliga in 2017/18 when they finished runners up behind Bayern Munich to qualify for the Champions League. Last season, they reached the knock-out stages of Europe for the first time, beating Tottenham and Atletico Madrid before losing to Paris Saint-Germain in the semi-finals. Mintzlaff said that as Bundesliga's international TV revenues have been declining recently, this was a good opportunity to bring German league football to the Indian market. Goa's ""innovative approach"" makes it a ""perfect fit"" for the ambitious German club, he added. Founded in 2014, Goa won the Indian Super Cup in 2019 and finished top of the ISL table last season under Spanish coach Juan Ferrando. Leipzig are the latest European club to branch into India. Last year, English Premier League side Manchester City's parent company bought a majority 65 percent stake in ISL franchise Mumbai City FC."
37,07/11/2020,18:33,"Leipzig go top in Germany ahead of Bayern, Dortmund showdown",RB Leipzig went back to the top of the Bundesliga table on Saturday with a 3-0 home win over Freiburg before Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund clash in the evening showdown.,"Defender Ibrahima Konate fired home Leipzig's opener before midfielder Marcel Sabitzer added their second goal with a 70th-minute penalty. Manchester City loanee Angelino claimed Leipzig's third with a stunning free-kick which curled over the Freiburg wall just before the final whistle. The home win put Leipzig top, a point ahead of Bayern and Dortmund who meet later at Signal Iduna Park. ""We really deserved the win - we were very, very good in the first-half,"" said Leipzig head coach Julian Nagelsmann. He was especially pleased with Konate's opening goal from a towering cross before winger Christopher Nkunku, who scored in the mid-week win over Paris Saint Germain, won the penalty which Sabitzer converted after the VAR scrutinised the decision. ""We have trained a lot from set pieces,"" said Nagelsmann. ""It certainly wasn't an obvious penalty, but if the VAR says it was, then it must have been,"" he added after Nkunku went down after the slightest of touches from Freiburg defender Nicolas Hoefler. Union Berlin climbed to fourth with a 5-0 home thrashing of strugglers Arminia Bielefeld. Former Germany striker Max Kruse helped set up Union's first three goals, then converted a late penalty. After just three minutes, Japan winger Keita Endo scored his first goal for Union when he swept home Sheraldo Becker's final pass after Kruse's superb long pass. Endo went off with an injury soon after, but Union kept up the pressure as Kruse set up the next two goals for centre-back Robert Andrich and winger Becker. Kruse, 32, capped an outstanding display by converting a penalty before Cedric Teuchert, a right wing replacement for Becker, grabbed Union's late fourth goal. At the other end of the table, bottom side Mainz were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Schalke, who sit one place above them and have now gone 23 games without a league win dating back to January. After Daniel Brosinski and Jean-Philippe Mateta converted penalties for Mainz, Mark Uth pulled a goal back for Schalke who were 2-1 down late on. Schalke took a deserved point back to Gelsenkirchen when Mainz defender Jeremiah St. Juste turned the ball into his own net eight minutes from time. After five games without a win, Hertha Berlin roared back with a 3-0 win in the fog at Augsburg. Forwards Matheus Cunha, Dodi Lukebakio and Krzysztof Piatek, who cost Hertha 24 million euros ($28 million) from AC Milan in January, got on the scoresheet as Augsburg's defence crumbled."
38,03/11/2020,18:52,"'Not the worst time to face PSG', says Leipzig boss Nagelsmann","Injury to Paris Saint-Germain stars Neymar and Kylian Mbappe gives RB Leipzig a slight advantage for Wednesday's Champions League group match in a repeat of last season's semi-final, says their coach Julian Nagelsmann.","""Of course it's not a disadvantage that Mbappe and Neymar won't play - they are fantastic players - but PSG have other very good players that many teams in Europe would like to have in their ranks,"" Nagelsmann told a press conference on Tuesday. ""It's definitely not the worst time to face them, but we also have several injured players."" Mbappe was been ruled out of the Group H clash with a hamstring injury, while PSG were already missing Brazil forward Neymar, who has a thigh strain, and Mauro Icardi. The match in Germany is a rematch of last season's Champions League semi-final when PSG won 3-0 in Lisbon with Neymar and Mbappe in their ranks. Leipzig, who sit third in the group, are eager to bounce back from their 5-0 hammering at Manchester United last week. PSG are second in the section but level on three points with the Bundesliga club. ""With these two players (Neymar and Mbappe), PSG would be a bit stronger, but we also are missing players,"" said Nagelsmann, who must do without midfielders Lukas Klostermann and Konrad Laimer due to knee injuries. ""After the defeat in Manchester, fatigue was noticeable - it's hard to come home without a point, but that's part of the job. ""Defeats are hard to digest, we like to win, but we'll probably come out of them stronger if we learn the right lessons and learn them quickly."""
39,03/11/2020,10:47,Blow for PSG as injured Mbappe to miss Leipzig clash,Paris Saint-Germain announced on Tuesday that Kylian Mbappe has suffered a hamstring injury and will miss their Champions League game at RB Leipzig.,"The French World Cup -winning forward's last-minute defection is a significant blow for PSG with Neymar and Mauro Icardi already ruled out of Wednesday's game in Germany. Thomas Tuchel's side take on Leipzig playing catch-up in Group H after losing to Manchester United in their opening game. Mbappe scored a penalty in the league win over Nantes on Saturday before being withdrawn and heading straight down the tunnel clutching his right hamstring. At the time Tuchel was unconcerned about the 21-year-old's fitness for the Leipzig game. ""It is just fatigue. It's not an injury,"" the PSG manager said after the 3-0 win. But medical tests have subsequently confirmed that the player is suffering ""a right hamstring muscle problem"", PSG said. Wednesday's game is a rematch of August's Champions League semi-final in Lisbon which PSG won 3-0 before losing to Bayern Munich in the final."
40,28/10/2020,23:06,Rashford hat-trick as Man Utd smash Leipzig 5-0 in Champions League,Marcus Rashford scored a second-half hat-trick as Manchester United seized control of their Champions League group with a thumping 5-0 win against German league leaders RB Leipzig on Wednesday.,"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side, who have endured a rocky start to their season, now have six points from two games after building on their impressive opening win against Paris Saint-Germain United took the lead midway through the first half when Marcus Greenwood, 19, received a through ball from Paul Pogba and stroked the ball across Peter Gulacsi and into the far corner. Substitute Rashford struck three times after coming on in the 63rd minute to remind Solskjaer he is the main man at Old Trafford. Anthony Martial also got in on the act, scoring a penalty on an outstanding night for the three-time European champions, who are now three points clear at the top of Group H. Greenwood, who last month was sent home in disgrace by England for breaking coronavirus protocols, started up front alongside Martial, with Rashford and Bruno Fernandes surprisingly left on the bench. Leipzig started brightly, pinning the home side back but United soon settled. Fred forced an early save before Luke Shaw had a shot blocked by the head of Yussuf Poulsen and Martial burst into the box but failed to find Pogba. The home side broke the deadlock when Pogba drove forward from midfield and found Greenwood, who had timed his run into the box perfectly and hit his shot with unerring accuracy. United had a nervous wait as VAR looked at a potential off-side but the goal was allowed to stand. Leipzig came back strongly, pinning United back for long spells of the rest of the first half. United had an appeal for a penalty soon after the break when the ball hit Ibrahima Konate's arm but a VAR check ruled there was no penalty. United goalkeeper David de Gea produced a sharp save to keep out a Konate effort at the back post from a tight angle after the ball was flicked on by Poulsen. The visitors, now with substitutes Marcel Sabitzer and Alexander Sorloth on the pitch, were playing with urgency but United looked dangerous on the break. Fernandes sent a superb first-time ball through to Rashford, who raced through and slotted past Gulasci. The linesman had raised his flag for offside but VAR checked the decision, ruling that the forward started his run in his own half and awarded the goal. Rashford rifled home again four minutes later to make the score 3-0 but unselfishly allowed Martial to take the penalty after the Frenchman was brought down in the box. But the England man completed his hat-trick in added time to cap a devastating display."

The outstanding performer for the Bundesliga leaders this season, Angelino has picked up four goals from seven games, including a quickfire brace to set up Leipzig's victory over Istanbul Basaksehir in their opening Champions League outing last week. Now 23, Angelino joined City's youth academy from Deportivo La Coruna, his local club in the north-western Spanish community of Galicia, as a teenager in 2013. Yet he has struggled to break into Guardiola's side in recent years. Following loan spells at Girona, Mallorca and Dutch side NAC Breda, the Spaniard -- full name Jose Angel Esmoris Tasende -- made just six Premier League appearances for City last season. He initially joined Leipzig for six months in January, but signed a new loan deal in September, citing better prospects in the Bundesliga than in Manchester. ""I had the niggling feeling that I wasn't going to play anymore or that I didn't quite fit in (at City),"" he said in an interview with Spanish sports daily Marca last week. By contrast, 33-year-old coach Nagelsmann appears to be the perfect match for Angelino. The Leipzig boss, who combines possession football with the team's trademark blistering breaks, has moved the left-back Angelino into a more attacking role this season. ""If I'm honest, Nagelsmann was the reason I signed again for Leipzig. His tactics and style of football suit me perfectly,"" the player told Marca. Nagelsmann himself has sought to play down his own influence on Angelino, instead praising Guardiola and City for providing him with the finished product. ""He obviously came from a very, very good coach. He was a very educated player when he arrived, so the time he needed to adapt was a lot shorter,"" said the Leipzig coach after his side beat Basaksehir. A return to Manchester seems unlikely in the short term, with German media reporting that Angelino's current deal will almost certainly see him join Leipzig permanently at the end of the season. According to Bild, Leipzig will have to sign the Spaniard on a four-year, 18 million-euro ($21m) deal if he plays more than 12 league games this term. Yet on Wednesday, the 23-year-old has the chance to show Manchester what it is missing against City's fierce rivals United. And despite United's prestigious history, Angelino believes that his side are well equipped to take all three points at Old Trafford. ""From what I've seen of United so far, they are sometimes world class and sometimes average,"" he told local newspaper Mitteldeutsche Zeitung after the group-stage draw earlier this month. ""We don't need to be afraid of them."""

43,27/10/2020,03:00,Man Utd search for home comforts as Leipzig test looms,Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has stopped the rot at Manchester United but he must rediscover the winning formula at home as he prepares for Wednesday's visit of RB Leipzig in the Champions League.,"United's collapse against Tottenham in early October plunged the club back into crisis mode as the Norwegian scrambled to fix his broken defence. The sense of panic has receded, with a 4-1 win at Newcastle followed by an impressive 2-1 away victory against Paris Saint-Germain in United's European opener. But the Red Devils played out a drab 0-0 stalemate against Chelsea at an empty Old Trafford at the weekend, leaving them without a Premier League win at home this season. Solskjaer's team became the first United side since the 1972/73 season to fail to win any of their opening three home league matches -- leaving them languishing in the lower reaches of the table. Despite the underwhelming result, the manager was sanguine after Saturday's home draw, which came after an embarrassing 3-1 reverse against Crystal Palace and the humiliating 6-1 thumping by Tottenham both at Old Trafford. ""We had a clean sheet, we had some pressure, we stopped the home run of defeats,"" he said. ""We wanted to win, of course you want to win at home, but I think it's a solid performance when you think of the week we've had. We've had a very good week with two wins and a draw."" In sharp contrast to their poor home form, United have been genuinely impressive on the road. Their eye-catching victory in Paris was their 10th consecutive away win, excluding games at neutral venues -- a new club record. Solskjaer has speculated that one reason for the drop-off in home form is the change of routine during the lockdown period. He is also desperate for the return of fans to add noise and colour. The manager changed the pre-match routine before the Chelsea game in an effort to turn round his side's Old Trafford fortunes, taking them to stay in a hotel the night before the game. Despite United's inconsistency, defender Luke Shaw believes they are heading the right direction. ""When we're on the pitch now, it feels different to what it was before (at the start of the season). Before, we made a lot of sloppy, silly mistakes -- individual mistakes -- and I think we've learned from that and we've worked hard in training,"" he said. ""We knew we needed to improve, and I think we need to build on this today (Saturday) and take it to Wednesday."" Victory against the Bundesliga leaders would put United in a strong position to finish in the top two in Group H, with a double-header to come between Leipzig and PSG. But Julian Nagelsmann's in-form team, who started their European campaign with a 2-0 win against Istanbul Basaksehir, also have a chance to stamp their authority on the group. Solskjaer must decide whether to stick or twist against the Germans, who reached the semi-finals of last season's Champions League. He played a makeshift three-man central defence of Axel Tuanzebe, Luke Shaw and Victor Lindelof in Paris, with Aaron Wan-Bissaka and new signing Alex Telles operating as wing-backs. But Solksjaer reverted to a back four against Chelsea, with Harry Maguire, who endured a rocky start to the season on and off the pitch, back in the side. Solskjaer also has decisions to make in midfield. Scott McTominay and Fred have started all three games since the international break, with Paul Pogba coming on as a substitute each time to add forward thrust. Solskjaer is spoilt for choice up front, with new signing Edinson Cavani and Mason Greenwood in the mix and Anthony Martial available despite his domestic ban alongside Marcus Rashford. The Norwegian is becoming used to false dawns but a win against the German league leaders would be another sign that United might be heading in the right direction."
44,24/10/2020,18:30,Lewandowski hits hat-trick as Bayern Munich rout Frankfurt,Robert Lewandowski took his Bundesliga tally to 10 goals in five games this season with a hat-trick as Bayern Munich thumped Eintracht Frankfurt 5-0 on Saturday.,"Lewandowski has scored nine goals in his last three league games and wrapped up his treble within an hour at the Allianz Arena. Defending champions Bayern have scored 22 goals this term -- 10 more than league leaders RB Leipzig who stayed top with a 2-1 win over 10-man Hertha Berlin. Bayern sit one point behind in second place. In Munich, Leroy Sane marked his return from injury with the fourth goal during a brief cameo, before England Under-17 midfielder Jamal Musiala also came off the bench to net the fifth. However, Bayern's victory could come at a price as Canadian left-back Alphonso Davies was in clear distress after going off early with an ankle injury. Lewandowski underlined his status as one of the world's best strikers last season by scoring a career-best 55 goals in 47 games, including 34 in the Bundesliga. The Polish international opened the scoring on 10 minutes when he fired home after a Thomas Mueller pass. Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp couldn't do anything to stop Lewandowski's header from a Joshua Kimmich corner in the 26th minute. Bayern had a penalty appeal turned down when Douglas Costa's cross clipped the hand of Frankfurt's Makoto Hasebe. Lewandowski wrapped up the victory on the hour mark with a clinical finish from another Costa cross. After sitting out the last two games, Sane ghosted past a defender and drove a shot into the bottom corner with 18 minutes to play. Manuel Neuer pulled off a great save to deny Frankfurt striker Bas Dost before Musiala grabbed the final goal as the visitors suffered their first league defeat of the season. Leipzig came from behind to seal a 2-1 win over Hertha, whose Colombian striker Jhon Cordoba scored in the eighth minute. Leipzig drew level when defender Dayot Upamecano fired home from a free-kick on 11 minutes, but Berlin were reduced to 10 men after the break when substitute Deyovaisio Zeefuik was shown two yellow cards within four minutes of coming on. Leipzig made the man advantage count when Marcel Sabitzer converted a penalty with 13 minutes left. Hertha were lucky not to finish with nine men when another sub, Jessic Ngankam, scythed down Leipzig left-back Angelino and the referee changed his decision to a yellow card having initially showed a straight red. Borussia Moenchengladbach warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League game at home to Real Madrid with a 3-2 comeback win at Mainz. Germany midfielder Lars Stindl gave Gladbach an early lead, but the visitors were 2-1 down at half-time after French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta scored twice for Mainz. Gladbach midfielder Jonas Hofmann converted a penalty on 76 minutes, after a shot by replacement Marcus Thuram was blocked by a Mainz hand before Matthias Ginter headed the winner as Gladbach climbed to fifth. Union Berlin were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Freiburg as Vincenzo Grifo's first-half goal was cancelled out two minutes later by Union midfielder Robert Andrich."
45,20/10/2020,23:34,'Dangerous' Angelino guides Leipzig to Basaksehir win,"RB Leipzig sporting director Markus Kroesche said Angelino was ""dangerous"" after the Manchester City loanee continued his excellent early-season form with two first-half goals in the 2-0 Champions League opening win over Istanbul Basaksehir on Tuesday.","The Spaniard found the net for the third game in a row as Leipzig, unbeaten table toppers after four games in the Bundesliga, continued their winning ways on the European stage. A left-back by trade, Angelino has now scored four goals in all competitions this season, helping Leipzig plug the gap left by star striker Timo Werner's move to Chelsea. ""It's obviously a great result for us,"" he told broadcaster DAZN. ""We have to keep going and hopefully I will score a few more."" The 23-year-old, who joined the club on loan from City last January, has flourished in a more attacking role in recent weeks, and he terrorised the Basaksehir back line during a lively first half hour on Tuesday. ""Angelino was outstanding for us in the second half of last season. He's now playing further forward and he is dangerous in front of goal,"" Kroesche told broadcaster DAZN. ""He feels good here and he suits the way we play football perfectly,"" he added. Semi-finalists last season, Leipzig began their third Champions League campaign with a clinical performance, striking early before sitting back to defend the lead in the second half. Both Angelino and Dayot Upamecano forced early saves from Basaksehir keeper Mert Gunok, and it was the loanee who landed the first blow on 16 minutes. Darting into the box like a centre-forward, he picked up a chipped through ball from Emil Forsberg before turning on a sixpence around Martin Skrtel to fire a low shot past Gunok. He doubled the lead just four minutes later, hammering in a first-time finish from just inside the box after Yussuf Poulsen launched a smash-and-grab attack from midfield. The goalscorer dropped deeper in the second half as Leipzig soaked up pressure and Basaksehir searched in vain for a way back into the game. It was a baptism of fire for last season's Turkish champions, who are playing in Europe's most prestigious competition for the first time this year. ""It was the first Champions League game for me and the club, and it felt good. We will try to pick up some points in the coming games,"" midfielder Berkay Ozcan told DAZN. The win sends Leipzig top of Group H after the first round of matches, with the Bundesliga leaders set to face Manchester United at Old Trafford in their second group game next Wednesday."
46,14/08/2020,14:42,"'Mini Mourinho', protests, young signings - five things about Leipzig",Leipzig's shock quarter-final win over Atletico Madrid sees the German club facing Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League semi-finals next Tuesday barely a decade since their creation.,"Under Julian Nagelsmann, 33, a rising star among German coaches, Leipzig are also challenging Bayern Munich's domination of the Bundesliga. Here are five things to know about the German club: Leipzig were founded in 2009 when Red Bull took over the licence of fifth-tier side SSV Markranstaedt, near Leipzig, renaming and re-branding the club. The city of Leipzig was chosen under advice from Germany legend Franz Beckenbauer, a friend of Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz. The team shot up Germany's league pyramid with four promotions in seven seasons. As recently as 2013-14, they were still in the third division. They reached the Bundesliga in 2016-17, making a flying start by briefly keeping Bayern Munich from first place in the league table before finishing second. However, their Bundesliga arrival was met with hostility by Germany's established clubs, unhappy about their commercialism. As the German Football League (DFL) insist a sponsor can not appear in a club's title, the fabricated German word RasenBallsport - literally 'LawnBallsport' - make up the initials RB. Under the league's '50+1' rule, clubs must hold a majority of their own voting rights, but all Leipzig members are Red Bull employees. ""There's football being played to perform for a soda can,"" grumbled Borussia Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke in 2016. Leipzig had the last laugh by beating Dortmund 1-0 in only their second Bundesliga match. ""11 cans beat an 11 who bottled it,"" retorted Leipzig's then-boss Ralf Rangnick. However, some German fans were as unimpressed as Watzke. A severed bulls head appeared pitch side when Leipzig opened their 2016-17 season with a narrow German Cup win over neighbours Dynamo Dresden. Protests by home fans followed when Leipzig played away, particularly at Cologne, Moenchengladbach and Dortmund. Flags bearing insulting or threatening slogans aimed at Red Bull boss Mateschitz often appeared when the club visited. Things got out of hand in February 2017 when a large group of Dortmund supporters attacked visiting RB fans, including women and children, resulting in ten injuries. Dortmund's then-captain Marcel Schmelzer scolded their fans, ""we don't know you like that"", in a video message and a stand was closed for the next home game. Leipzig have always resisted the urge to use Red Bull's huge finances to buy established stars. Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi were both considered ""too old, too expensive"" by Rangnick back in 2016. The policy remains of developing young talent. After becoming one of the Bundesliga's best central midfielders, Naby Keita was 23 when Liverpool signed him in 2018 for around 60 million euros ($70 million). Timo Werner, 24, joined Chelsea in June after scoring 34 goals for Leipzig last season. Captain Yussuf Poulsen, a veteran at 26, was signed in 2013-14 when Leipzig were in the third division. In Nagelsmann, signed last season from Hoffenheim, Leipzig secured arguably Germany's brightest coaching talent, nicknamed 'Mini Mourinho'. In the current squad, ex-Barcelona academy product Dani Olmo, 22, and US midfielder Tyler Adams, are both fulfilling promise after scoring on Thursday against Atletico. RB Leipzig have made no secret of their desire to challenge the established order in German football by rivalling Bayern or Dortmund and finished third in 2019/20 to qualify for next season's Champions League. In each of their four seasons in Germany's top flight, Leipzig qualified for Europe by finishing in the top six. Under current Southampton manager Ralph Hassenhuettl, Leipzig finished their debut Bundesliga season in 2016-17 second to Bayern, leaving Dortmund third. They are gaining valuable experience in Europe. Leipzig were eliminated after the Champions League group stages in 2017-18 - their debut campaign - and also bowed out early in the Europa League last season. However, this year under Nagelsmann, they finished top of a group containing Benfica, Lyon and Zenit Saint Petersburg, beat Tottenham in the last 16 and eliminated 2014 and 2016 finalists Atletico in the quarter-finals. cpb-ryj/nr/dmc <org>SPORT LISBOA E BENFICA - FUTEBOL</org> <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org>"
47,14/08/2020,00:48,"'Proud' Leipzig boss Nagelsmann relishing facing ex-mentor, PSG coach Tuchel",RB Leipzig boss Julian Nagelsmann says he is relishing facing former mentor and Paris Saint Germain coach Thomas Tuchel in the Champions League semi-finals following his side's stunning win over Atletico Madrid.,"Leipzig, who were only founded in 2009, booked a semi-final berth at their first attempt in the knock-out stages when US midfielder Tyler Adams hit an 88th-minute winner. It sealed the Germans' win after a Joao Felix penalty for Atletico had cancelled out Dani Olmo's header for Leipzig early in the second half. Leipzig now face PSG next Tuesday, also in Lisbon, for a place in the August 23 final. It was PSG's German coach Tuchel, 46, who gave Nagelsmann his first break at Augsburg 12 years ago as a scout which saw him then become a coach. ""They are a top team with a top trainer,"" said the 33-year-old Nagelsmann, whose playing career was ended in 2008 by a knee injury. ""I have often played (as a coach) against him (Tuchel) but rarely won. ""That should change now. I would also be satisfied with a bad game if we win,"" Nagelsmann added. When coach of his former club Hoffenheim, Nagelsmann lost twice and drew against Tuchel, who was then in charge of Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga between 2016 and 2017. Nagelsmann was full of praise for PSG, who came back against Atalanta on Wednesday to win after scoring two late goals. ""They are a team full of stars,"" Nagelsmann added, referring to Neymar and fellow PSG forward Kylian Mbappe. ""You could see yesterday at the end what quality they have. ""Angel di Maria is coming back, Mbappe will be fit enough to play from the beginning. ""It's clear that we need another top performance to get into the final."" Nagelsmann's Leipzig held their nerve after Felix equalised before Adams came off the bench to seal the winner after superb work in the build-up by left-back Angelino and midfielder Marcel Sabitzer. ""I was getting ready for extra-time and thinking about who I would bring on, so I am happy that I didn't have to do that,"" added Nagelsmann. ""I couldn't believe we scored that beautiful goal. ""We had trained for the situation when we went 1-0 up, but things didn't work out exactly. ""The boys sorted things out for themselves and showed how mentally strong they are, so I am really proud of them."" This is the first time Leipzig have made the knock-out stages of the Champions League and having already beaten Tottenham in the last 16, they want to make more are history. Their captain Yussuf Poulsen, 26, who joined in 2013-14 when Leipzig were in Germany's third division, acknowledged the magnitude of the achievement for the eastern Germany club backed by energy drinks firm Red Bull. ""This is a story that you couldn't have written better,"" said the Denmark striker. ""It is a great day, a great moment, we have to enjoy it, then have a better game in the semi-finals in five days."" Poulsen said Nagelsmann's meticulous preparations had been a key. ""We were just well prepared, everyone knew what to do,"" he said. ""But we also had some players on the pitch who were not playing Champions League for the first time,"" he added after Leipzig bowed out in the group stages in 2017-18. ""If we'd played a game like that two years ago, it might have turned out differently."""

Atletico's Joao Felix had earlier scored a penalty to cancel out Dani Olmo's opener. Defeat ends a disappointing season for Atletico, who finished third in La Liga, 17 points behind Real Madrid. ""We didn't have that physical sharpness or rhythm,"" said Simeone afterwards. ""At the end of a season with so much pressure, so much need to get into the Champions League, and the need to integrate new players. ""We came with a lot of hope. The feeling is a lot of bitterness but I know the players gave everything. They gave it their all."" Questions will be asked about Simeone's future and his ability to turn this Atletico side into winners again, while sticking to his defensive style of play. ""I have nothing to say to anyone about what we did this season. It's a good season, third in La Liga, quarter-finalists in Champions League,"" Simeone said. ""Next season will be tough, very tough."" Simeone admitted Leipzig were the better team and deserved to go through to the semis. ""They were better, faster,"" he added. ""We gave everything and we leave with dignity, with an opponent who deserves their victory."""

They will face Paris Saint-Germain for a place in the final. Holding midfielder Adams scored the winner in the 88th minute, his first goal for the club, after a Joao Felix penalty had cancelled out Dani Olmo's opener for Leipzig. ""I am not your typical goal scorer, but I am happy I could help the team,"" said Adams, who came on as a substitute. Adams' effort came after his fired shot took a cruel deflection of Stefan Savic and flew in. ""Coming into this game, I was told I wasn't starting but needed to be ready to come off the bench and make an impact, so I had to get myself in the right mindset to come out and help in anyway possible,"" added the 21-year-old. ""We are really excited, we know Paris Saint-Germain are a good team and we saw that yesterday what they did against Atalanta, with the players they had on the field, so we need to match that energy. ""Now it's about recovering in the right way, getting our mentality and preparing a game plan, but we are confident in our abilities like you saw today and we will bring what we are capable of."""
50,13/08/2020,23:56,Leipzig beat Atletico to book historic meeting with PSG,Leipzig stunned Atletico Madrid 2-1 on Thursday to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time as Tyler Adams' 88th-minute winner earned them a showdown with Paris Saint-Germain.,"Atletico looked to have secured extra-time at the Estadio Jose Alvalade when Joao Felix won and then scored a penalty to cancel out Dani Olmo's headed opener early in the second half. But Adams proved an unlikely hero for Leipzig, coming off the bench to snatch victory in Lisbon after his fired effort took a cruel deflection of Stefan Savic and flew in. The win marks an historic night for Leipzig, who were only formed 11 years ago and played their first ever season in Germany's top flight in 2016. Progress to the last four also puts another feather in the cap of their coach Julian Nagelsmann, whose stock will rise even further after ousting Diego Simeone, one of this competition's most gnarly tacticians. ""I'm perhaps one of the happiest coaches in the world,"" Nagelsmann said. ""We were the better team, the result is totally OK. The second goal is a bit lucky but we found the space behind the defensive line. I think we were the better team today."" Their challenge is now to defeat PSG on Tuesday, the French champions who have only played three matches in almost half a year and needed a late escape to see off Atalanta on Tuesday. ""It's normal that when you get to the next round, you want more,"" Nagelsmann said. ""Tonight we're happy. Tomorrow we'll start looking at Paris. That will be another difficult game but we'll have a plan."" For Atletico and Simeone, this was an opportunity spurned to go far in Europe at the end of what has been a disappointing season in Spain. After Real Madrid's loss against Manchester City, only Barcelona are left to fly the Spanish flag in this tournament and they face a formidable challenge against Bayern Munich on Friday. Questions will be asked again about the future of Simeone, who has struggled to recreate an Atletico side capable of challenging for major honours. His notoriously defensive approach, which saw off holders Liverpool in the last 16, looked outdated here against the slick, quick and free-flowing style of their opponents. ""It hurts a lot,"" said Atletico's Saul Niguez. ""They had superiority in many areas on the pitch, inside, outside. Many times we were not even close to stopping them."" A forgettable first half was more worrying for Atletico, who struggled to escape their own half, even if Leipzig never really turned their pressure into any chances. Marcel Halstenberg had the best opening but lashed over on the volley at the back post while the excellent Dayot Upamecano headed straight into the hands of Jan Oblak when given too much space in the box. In between, VAR took a long time looking at a possible Atletico penalty but the contact between Peter Gulasci and Niguez's heel was minimal and the correct decision was made. Leipzig were still in the ascendancy after half-time. Sabitzer had been captain until he picked up a knee injury in June and it was his perfect cross that created the opener, Olmo nipping in at the front post and heading past Oblak into the far corner. Simeone threw on Felix to spark his team into life and the 20-year-old made a difference. He played a neat one-two with Diego Costa before poking the ball away from the lunging Lukas Klostermann. Felix went down and then got up to score the penalty. Atletico owned the momentum but they let it go as the game drifted towards extra-time. Leipzig sensed an opportunity and in the 88th minute, they struck. The ball was brilliantly switched left to Angelino, whose pulled cross fooled the retreating Atletico defence and landed at the feet of Adams on the edge of the area. He had time to size up his shot, the finish spinning up off the left foot of Savic and leaving Oblak helpless."

Despite permission from Chelsea, Werner turned down the chance to play for Leipzig in the quarter-finals in order to focus on settling into life in London. In his absence Poulsen, who has recovered from an ankle injury in May, is set to partner on-loan Czech forward Patrik Schick in Lisbon. ""We know that we can't completely replace Timo one to one,"" Poulsen told AFP subsidiary SID. ""But I also know that the coach has a lot of ideas on how we can approach this and be at least as effective in Lisbon as we were in our previous Champions League games. ""As long as I'm in the starting eleven, I always agree with the coach,"" he joked. Leipzig were only founded in 2009 and are in the knock-out stages of the Champions League for the first time. After beating Tottenham in the last 16, they are eager to extend their run under ambitious head coach Julian Nagelsmann. Despite being just 26, Poulsen has spent seven years at Leipzig and has come up with them from Germany's third division to Europe's top table. The Denmark international has scored 63 goals and created 51 more in 250 appearances for the club from Germany's east. He has the distinction of being the first Leipzig player to score a Bundesliga hat-trick, doing so against Hertha Berlin in March 2019. Now, after weeks of uncertainty due to the coronavirus pandemic between February's last-16 win and the quarter-final, Poulsen said the Germans are ready to face an experienced Atletico side. ""We're all really looking forward to the game,"" said the Dane. ""We've worked hard for it and we're happy that we can finish it. ""There were times when that wasn't certain, so it's a great feeling to be in Lisbon. ""Once you're there, you must have the determination to go all the way to the final and the title."" Under Diego Simeone, Atletico are hunting their first Champions League title after losing the 2014 and 2016 finals to arch-rivals Real Madrid. ""Those responsible have been doing a very good job at Atletico for many years,"" said Poulsen. ""Of course Atletico is the favourite, we are more the underdog. ""We're in the Champions League quarter finals for the first time, they've always been fully involved for the last eight, ten years. ""But, of course, we have a chance and we believe we do."" Under Nagelsmann, RB Leipzig play a brand of attacking football and big things are expected from their talented Spanish attacking midfielder Daniel Olmo, a product of Barcelona's youth academy. In contrast, Atletico have earned a reputation for tough defending with their back four notoriously hard to break down, as Liverpool found to their cost in the last 16. ""Yes, there are a few differences, but whoever says that Atletico only sit deep and defend, only knows the team partially,"" warned Poulsen. ""They can also push very high, but are very well trained to prevent a goal from being scored. ""We can learn from that too."""
53,10/08/2020,18:36,Leipzig boss Nagelsmann unfazed by Atletico virus cases,RB Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann says he is fully focused on their Champions League quarter-final despite two detected cases of coronavirus in the squad of Thursday's opponents Atletico Madrid.,"Atletico's Angel Correa and Sime Vrsaljko, who tested positive for COVID-19 at the weekend, have been isolated and left at home but the match in Lisbon is due to go ahead as planned. Atletico breathed a sigh of relief on Monday as their players and staff all returned negative results in a further round of testing before the team flew to Portugal. ""We know that there are clear UEFA protocols for such cases. If it remains two cases, it won't have much effect,"" said Nagelsmann. ""We are concentrating entirely on our preparation and won't let it get to us."" RB Leipzig, who were only founded in 2009, had never got to the knockout stages in Europe's top club competition before this season, and having beaten Tottenham in the last 16, they are eager to claim another big-name scalp. Nagelsmann's biggest concern is trying to replace the firepower of Timo Werner, who netted 34 times this term, including four goals in the Champions League, before the Germany striker joined Chelsea last month. Denmark striker Yussuf Poulsen is set to partner Czech Republic forward Patrik Schick, who is on loan from Roma, up front on Thursday. ""Once you're there, you must have the determination to go all the way to the final and the title,"" Poulsen told AFP subsidiary SID. The German side are fully aware of what to expect against Diego Simeone's Atletico, who have plenty of experience at this stage of the competition. ""Atletico are a strong team, they show it every year in the Champions League,"" said Leipzig's Dani Olmo, with Atletico finishing runners-up in both 2014 and 2016. ""We have trained very well and we are ready for this big task,"" he added."
54,09/08/2020,22:15,Champions League setback as Atletico report two positive coronavirus tests,"Spanish side Atletico Madrid on Sunday reported two positive coronavirus tests, just four days before they face Leipzig in Portugal for a place in the Champions League semi-finals.","""On Saturday, all members of the first team and the club's party to Lisbon underwent tests as required by UEFA protocols to participate in the quarter-finals of the Champions League,"" said a club statement. ""Among the results known today, two positives have appeared and they are self-isolating in their respective homes."" It was not revealed whether the two positive cases involved players or backroom staff. Atletico said UEFA as well as the Spanish and Portuguese football and health authorities have been informed and that a fresh round of tests will be carried out on the squad and support team. They admitted this could mean last-minute changes to travel schedules as well as accommodation plans in the Portuguese capital. ""The club will coordinate the new schedules with UEFA and as soon as there is a new plan it will be made public,"" added the statement. ""We also request the utmost respect over the identity of the two positive cases."" The team were due to travel to Portugal on Monday for the closing stages of the Champions League which is being held in Lisbon as a precaution against COVID-19 rather than risk having teams travelling across Europe for home-and-away ties. The self-contained eight-team tournament will be staged behind closed doors, starting on Wednesday with the final set for Lisbon on August 23. Spain has so far been one of the countries worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic, with 310,000 registered infections and 28,500 deaths. Although most sports have returned from a months-long lockdown caused by the virus, there are concerns that numbers of cases are beginning to rise again. In recent days, Spain has seen local quarantines imposed in the Basque Country, Catalonia and Aragon. Protective face masks have been made compulsory in several busy areas, especially in the Madrid region. Last month, Atletico's city rivals Real Madrid announced forward Mariano Diaz had tested positive for COVID-19. Sevilla, meanwhile, reported an unnamed player had also contracted the illness. Real have since been knocked out of the Champions League but Sevilla are still involved in the Europa League. They play English side Wolves in their quarter-final in Duisburg, Germany, on Tuesday. The Champions League had been put on hold since March because of the virus with the last-16 stage only completed on Friday and Saturday. In their statement on Sunday, Atletico were keen to reassure football authorities, explaining that they had followed a very strict protocol even after the end of La Liga season on July 19. Weekly tests were carried out on July 26 and August 2. For its 'Final Eight' tournament in Portugal, UEFA has planned strict protocols -- each team will have to provide test results before travelling to the country, and will be tested again on the eve of their first match. Each positive test will require the individual to self-isolate."

Leipzig could reportedly make the deal permanent at the end of the 2020/21 campaign for 15 million euros. Henrichs failed to impose himself in Ligue 1, making just 44 appearances in all competitions for Monaco, scoring once."
56,08/07/2020,15:28,RB Leipzig sign South Korea's Hwang to replace Werner,"RB Leipzig announced Wednesday the signing of Hwang Hee-chan from their sister club Red Bull Salzburg to replace Timo Werner, but the South Korea forward is unavailable for the Champions League next month.","The 24-year-old inherits the number 11 shirt Werner vacated when he left for Chelsea last month. Hwang has agreed a five-year contract in a transfer reportedly worth nine million euros ($10 million). He is the 17th player in eight years to move from Salzburg to Leipzig as both clubs are backed by Austrian energy drink giant Red Bull. ""He fits perfectly into what we require, can play any position in attack, on the wing or acting as a central striker,"" said Leipzig sports director Markus Kroesche. ""With his speed and agility he makes our attack even more flexible."" However, Leipzig pointed out Hwang has signed for 2020-21 campaign and will miss the Champions League finals tournament in Lisbon next month. The German side, who finished third in the Bundesliga last season and knocked out Tottenham in the last 16, will discover their quarter-final opponents in Friday's draw. Hwang scored 16 goals making 22 assists in helping Salzburg win the Austrian league and cup double last term. Last autumn, Hwang also bagged three goals in six Champions League matches in the group stages alongside Norwegian teen Erling Braut Haaland, who netted eight time in Europe before his January transfer to Dortmund. This is the second stint in Germany for Hwang, who spent 2018/19 on loan at fallen giants Hamburg in the second division."
57,02/07/2020,18:31,RB Leipzig get provisional green light for fans to return next season,"RB Leipzig were granted provisional permission on Thursday to allow up to 20,000 spectators to attend their home games next season, raising hopes Bundesliga fans could return across Germany.","The top-flight season finished last Saturday, with the last nine rounds of matches played behind closed doors after the Bundesliga resumed in mid-May following the coronavirus lockdown. Clubs including champions Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Cologne have been working on hygiene concepts which could allow fans back into their grounds for the 2020/21 Bundesliga season, currently ear-marked to start on either September 11 or 18. However, RB Leipzig are the first top-flight outfit to get the provisional green light. The health authority in the east German city has approved the club's plan to allow their Red Bull Arena, which has a usual capacity of 41,000, to be half full on matchdays. ""RB Leipzig has presented a hygiene concept which is sustainable from the point of view of the public health department and which is suitable to significantly reduce the incidence of infections,"" a city official told AFP subsidiary SID. ""For this reason, the public health department has confirmed the hygiene concept of RB Leipzig."" Supporters would only be able to sit -- the terraces would remain empty -- and face masks would be compulsory. But the club reacted cautiously, as state politicians in Saxony must first lift the current ban on events with more than 1,000 people and the infection rate would have to remain low. ""The public health department will support the concept in principle if the pandemic situation continues to develop positively,"" said Ulrich Wolter, an RB Leipzig board member. The German Football League (DFL) has yet to comment on the developments. On Wednesday, DFL chief executive Christian Seifert said the league can not decide the number of fans allowed into grounds at each of the 18 Bundesliga clubs as permission has to come from each local health authority. ""There can be no off-the-peg solution,"" Seifert told daily paper Welt. ""I am not a fan of generally committing to 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000 spectators,"" he added, as the infection rate varies in each of Germany's 16 states."
58,27/06/2020,18:01,"Bremen snatch play-off survival chance, champions Bayern rout Wolfsburg","Werder Bremen gave themselves hope of avoiding relegation from the German Bundesliga by thrashing Cologne 6-1 to grab a play-off place on the last day of the season, while champions Bayern Munich routed Wolfsburg before lifting the trophy on Saturday.","Japan striker Yuya Osako scored twice as Bremen stole the lifeline of the relegation/promotion play-off place from Fortuna Duesseldorf, who lost 3-0 at Union Berlin and were relegated with Paderborn, finishing one point behind Bremen. Florian Kohfeldt's Werder will face second-tier opponents in either Heidenheim or possibly neighbours, rivals and fellow fallen giants Hamburg in the play-off first leg on Thursday. Bremen have spent more seasons than any other team in the Bundesliga, having only spent one term in the second tier, in 1980-81. A burst of goals from Osako, Milot Rashica and Niclas Fuellkrug -- all in the space of eight minutes -- had Werder 3-0 up at the break against Cologne at the Weserstadion. Former Everton midfielder Davy Klaassen then fired home a rebound just after the break before Osako, facing his old side, added his second and USA international Josh Sargent completed the rout. Dominick Drexler pulled a goal back for Cologne. Werder, the four-time Bundesliga champions, also needed a favour from Berlin and got one as Union beat Fortuna 3-0 with goals from Nigerian duo Anthony Ujah and Suleiman Abdullahi either side of veteran midfielder Christian Gentner's effort. Bremen will find out their play-off opponents on Sunday, with Heidenheim currently in the play-off place ahead of the final round of matches in the second division. At Wolfsburg, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski scored a penalty for his 34th league goal of the season, finishing as the top scorer for the fifth time. Kingsley Coman, Michael Cuisance and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet as Bayern, champions for the eighth straight season, finished 13 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Mueller set up Coman for Bayern's opening goal to finish the campaign with a league record 21 assists, and his goal that rounded out the win was also Bayern's 100th league goal this season -- one short of the Bundesliga record. Wolfsburg captain Josuha Guilavogui was sent off for a second yellow card after fouling Cuisance, leading to Lewandowski's penalty. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach and RB Leipzig secured qualification for next season's Champions League after 2-1 wins over Hertha Berlin and Augsburg respectively, as fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen missed out by two points despite beating Mainz 1-0. Dortmund, who had already wrapped up second place, crashed to a 4-0 home defeat by Hoffenheim, for whom Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric scored all four goals, including one penalty. That result allowed Hoffenheim to leapfrog Wolfsburg and take sixth place, although both sides will go into the Europa League next season along with Leverkusen. Before kick-off in Dortmund, Mario Goetze, whose winning goal sealed Germany's victory in the 2014 World Cup final, was given a send-off by the club. He will leave this summer with his contract having expired, but the 28-year-old attacking midfielder has not announced his future club. Elsewhere, Timo Werner signed off with a brace in RB Leipzig's 2-1 win at Augsburg in what was his final appearance for the club before moving to Chelsea. Schalke's disastrous second half of the season was completed with a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Freiburg as they finished the season 12th, having been third in December. Eintracht Frankfurt beat bottom side Paderborn 3-2 in Saturday's other game."
59,18/06/2020,17:02,"Werner turned down Champions League quarter-finals chance, say Leipzig","Chelsea-bound Timo Werner opted not to play for RB Leipzig in the Champions League quarter-finals this August, the Bundesliga club revealed Thursday, even though he is ineligible to play in Europe for his new club this season.","Earlier in the day, Chelsea confirmed that the 24-year-old Germany international had signed a five-year deal from July 1, which rules him out of playing for former club Leipzig in Europe this August. Werner, who has scored 32 goals this season, will remain with the German club for their last two league games before the Bundesliga season ends on June 27. RB Leipzig, who have never previously made the knock-out stages in Europe, are through to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, which would have also been Werner's first appearance at that level. The quarter-finals, which have yet to be drawn, are due to be held in Lisbon with the final on August 23 in the Portuguese capital. According to Leipzig, Werner, who scored four goals in eight Champions League games this season, opted not to play for them again in Europe. ""The decision came from Werner's side. We had to accept it as it is,"" revealed Leipzig's sports director Markus Kroesche. ""Therefore, it was no longer a big issue between the clubs."" His new club Chelsea still need to play their last 16, second leg, against Bayern Munich having been hammered 3-0 at home in the first leg. However Werner is ineligible, as he was not registered for Chelsea when the second-leg should have taken place in March before games were postponed due to the coronavirus. Werner's transfer fee of around 60 million euros (£53 million, $67 million) makes him the most expensive German signing from the Bundesliga. Kroesche explained that Werner turned down the Champions League's quarter-finals in order to settle into his new club. ""He wants to prepare for the Premier League season with Chelsea,"" explained Kroesche. ""He wants to take his time to come into a new environment."""
60,12/06/2020,22:38,Olmo double keeps Leipzig on Champions League path,Two goals in two minutes from Dani Olmo gave RB Leipzig a 2-0 win at Hoffenheim on Friday to allow them to close within a point of second-placed Borussia Dortmund in the German Bundesliga.,"Leipzig now have 62 points with three games left although Dortmund, still hopeful of chasing down Bayern Munich for the title, have a game in hand. They face Fortuna Duesseldorf on Saturday. Leipzig remain comfortably on course for a return to the Champions League, having already made the quarter-finals this season, with a six-point cushion over closest pursuers Borussia Moenchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen who play at the weekend. Spanish midfielder Olmo found the net after nine and 11 minutes while substitute Christopher Nkunku was close to a third in stoppage time when a shot came off the post."
61,10/06/2020,17:12,"Chelsea target Werner 'a brutal weapon', says Hasenhuettl","Germany striker Timo Werner could be a ""brutal weapon"" in the Premier League if his move from RB Leipzig to Chelsea goes through, according to his former coach Ralph Hasenhuettl.","Media reports claim the English side are poised to meet the release clause, said to be around 60 million euros (£53 million, $67 million) in Werner's contract despite the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. ""The football (in England) is very intense and fast. That in turn suits Timo,"" Hasenhuettl told German magazine Sport Bild. ""With his speed, he can be a brutal weapon in the right team."" Werner played under Hasenhuettl, who now manages Southampton in England's top flight, when the Austrian coach was in charge of Leipzig from 2016 until 2018. The 24-year-old has a career-high 25 goals in the Bundesliga this season, including three hat-tricks. Only Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski, who has found the net 30 times, has scored more times in Germany's top flight this term. Hasenhuettl said fleet-footed Werner has the speed to make an impact in England, but will need extra support from Chelsea boss Frank Lampard. Werner is a sensitive player who ""sometimes needs a shoulder to lean on, or a little more encouragement,"" said Hasenhuettl. ""But what I always liked about him is that he scores goals that nobody else can. ""Give him a little bit of space and he is almost unstoppable. ""He has so many qualities that will always put him above others."""
62,09/06/2020,03:10,'Turbo Timo' Werner gives new-look Chelsea goal threat,"When Timo Werner seals his imminent move from RB Leipzig to Chelsea, the German's turbulent rise from national pariah to one of Europe's most feared forwards will be complete.","Chelsea are willing to meet the 60 million euro (£53 million, $67 million) release clause in Werner's contract despite the economic crisis caused by coronavirus. But for the pandemic, Werner could have been lining up for Liverpool next season after the 24-year-old admitted to being flattered by Jurgen Klopp's interest. However, Liverpool, concerned by the financial fallout from the virus, were not willing to pay Werner's release clause before it expired this month. So instead Chelsea are set to add some much-needed firepower to Frank Lampard's revamped attack next season. The Germany international has scored 31 goals for Leipzig in all competitions this season, including four in five games since the Bundesliga returned last month. Werner has already proved he can trouble Premier League defences. He played an influential role as Leipzig thrashed Tottenham in the Champions League last 16, bagging the only goal of the first leg from the penalty spot. Michael Ballack knows exactly what it takes to shine in the Premier League after leaving Germany and the former Chelsea and Bayern Munich midfielder believes Werner has the qualities required to adapt to English football. ""I think it's a good decision for both sides. For Timo, because he fits there, because the way (Chelsea) play football suits him,"" Ballack said. ""He is a robust player, is very fast, but he is also physically good in a duel and he will quickly get used to it."" The fanfare around Werner comes just two years after his reputation had taken a major hit amid World Cup misery and diving accusations. That storm was a far cry from Werner's humble upbringing in Stuttgart, where his father Guenther Schuh played at the amateur level. Mario Gomez, an icon at Stuttgart, was Werner's hero as a child and fuelled his dreams of playing for his hometown club. He fulfilled that ambition in 2013, becoming Stuttgart's youngest ever debutant aged 17 and their youngest scorer when he netted three times in his first 10 appearances. Earning the nickname 'Turbo Timo' because of his electric pace, which he attributes to running up mountains with his father as a child, Werner has been clocked at 11.1 seconds over 100 metres. ""When I was younger it quickly became clear to me that if you want to become a professional, you have to do more,"" he said. Werner became the youngest player to make 50 Bundesliga appearances, but despite his goals, Stuttgart were relegated in 2016. That convinced Werner to accept an offer to join newly-promoted Leipzig -- an unpopular decision not just to the spurned Stuttgart faithful but German football public at large given the anger at Leipzig's rise thanks to the backing of Red Bull. Slammed for a lack of loyalty, Werner found himself public enemy number one when a blatant dive against Schalke enraged fans and pundits alike in 2016. The unassuming Werner rebuilt his confidence to head to the 2018 World Cup as Germany's leading striker, but failed to score in three games as the holders crashed out at the first hurdle for the first time since 1938. Seeking help from a sports psychologist, Werner showed his maturity by using the backlash to fuel his development. ""He told me that I could silence everyone who doesn't like me by doing just one thing: scoring,"" Werner told Focus magazine at the time. Werner's mission was quickly accomplished as his goals fired Leipzig into the Champions League, earning widespread admiration just months after he had been pilloried by the critics. With 92 goals in all competitions since joining Leipzig, Werner should add the goal threat Chelsea have often lacked this season. After a blistering start to the campaign, Tammy Abraham's form had stagnated before the virus lockdown, with an ankle injury hampering his progress. Werner's ability to cut in from the left or play through the middle offers options to complement Abraham and Olivier Giroud as Chelsea look to take the next step in their development under Lampard."
63,06/06/2020,21:00,Leipzig pour cold water on Werner Chelsea talk,"RB Leipzig on Saturday cast doubt on news that Germany striker Timo Werner was closing in on a move to Chelsea, saying that the widely reported transfer was far from a done deal.","""Timo Werner hasn't triggered the (release) clause (in his contract), and we haven't received a transfer contract from any club,"" said Leipzig's sporting director Oliver Mintzlaff. ""Timo Werner is in the driver's seat now, not us,"" Mintzlaff said, adding that Werner ""indicated a few weeks ago that he was looking into a transfer"". According to media reports in Germany and England this week, Werner has agreed to move to Chelsea at the end of the season, with the Premier League club ready to pay around 50 million euros (£44.5 million). On Saturday, Mintzlaff said he was pleased that Werner had renewed his contract last summer to avoid Leipzig losing him on a free transfer. He added that he did not expect any complications over Werner's departure due to the changes in the football calendar brought about by the coronavirus crisis. ""We are sure that we will find a solution with his new club which allows us to end the Bundesliga season with Timo,"" he said."
64,06/06/2020,17:42,Lewandowski scores 30th Bundesliga goal of season as Bayern close on title,Robert Lewandowski scored his 30th league goal of the season on Saturday as Bayern Munich came from behind to claim a 4-2 victory at Bayer Leverkusen and move a step closer to the Bundesliga title.,"After Lucas Alario secured an early lead for the home side, Bayern struck twice in quick succession just before half-time to turn the game in their favour after Kingsley Coman's equaliser. Lewandowski netted in the second half as Bayern established a 10-point lead over title rivals Borussia Dortmund, who host Hertha Berlin later on Saturday. The game also saw Bayern lend their support to protests over the death of black American man George Floyd, with all their players wearing armbands bearing the slogan ""Black Lives Matter"". With their talisman and Bayern transfer target Kai Havertz ruled out with a muscle injury, Leverkusen turned to Alario to lead the line against the champions. The Argentine delivered after just nine minutes, beating the offside trap after a throw-in to slot the ball past Manuel Neuer. A mistake from Moussa Diaby allowed Coman to curl in the equaliser, before a fizzing shot from Leon Goretzka and an elegant lob from Serge Gnabry saw Bayern take a two-goal lead before half-time. Lewandowski finished the job with a well-placed header after the break, reaching the 30-goal mark for only the second time in his Bundesliga career, but there was still time for 17-year-old Florian Wirtz to curl in a consolation goal for Leverkusen before the final whistle. Elsewhere, a late equaliser from Christian Strohdiek gave bottom-of-the-table Paderborn a faint glimmer of hope in the race for survival, as they snatched a 1-1 draw away to RB Leipzig. Chelsea-bound Leipzig striker Timo Werner set up Patrik Schick on 27 minutes to give Leipzig the lead, but they were forced to defend it with 10 men after Dayot Upamecano was booked twice in the first half. Strohdiek's last-minute strike gave Paderborn their fourth draw in five games, though Steffen Baumgart's side remain eight points off Fortuna Duesseldorf who occupy the relegation play-off place. Duesseldorf themselves missed the chance to move towards safety, as they battled to a dramatic 2-2 draw against 10-man Hoffenheim. A headed opener from Rouwen Hennings and a red card for Hoffenheim's Benjamin Huebner put the home side in pole position, but the visitors struck back with goals from Munas Dabbur and Steven Zuber before Hennings saved a point with a late penalty. Uwe Roesler's side remain three points adrift of survival, after goals from Moussa Niakhate and Pierre Kunde Malong gave fellow strugglers Mainz a rare 2-0 win over local rivals Eintracht Frankfurt."

The hosts' boss Markus Gisdol made four changes from Wednesday's loss at Hoffenheim, starting Rafael Czichos in place of suspended Sebastian Bournaauw, red carded in the defeat. Leipzig's Julian Nagelsmann switched both his wing-backs from Wednesday's draw to Hertha Berlin as Angelino, on loan from Manchester City, and French youth international Nordi Mukiele started. The home side took an early lead as Cordoba poached for his 10th home goal of the campaign. Midfielder Elvis Rexhbecaj's effort deflected onto the far post and the Colombian finished from the rebound after seven minutes. The sides were level 13 minutes later as Schick headed home Angelino's cross. Things went from bad to worse for Gisdol's men four minutes later as Cordoba was forced off with an injury and replaced by Anthony Modeste. Leipzig's took the lead eight minutes from the break as Christopher Nkunku claimed his first goal since January. Austria midfielder Konrad Laimer played a clever ball into the box and former Paris Saint-Germain attacker Nkunku dinked his finish over the onrushing Timo Horn. Leipzig went further ahead three minutes into the second-half as Werner, who has been linked with a move to Premier League leaders Liverpool, raced clear in a rapid counter-attack and beat Horn with a side-footed finish. Cologne hit back four minutes later as Leipzig failed to clear outside their area and Modeste curled home a shot. Leipzig's two-goal lead was re-established less than two minutes later as Spain midfielder Dani Olmo scored his first goal since joining Leipzig in January with a curling shot of hos own from the edge of the box. Substitute Modeste seemed to have won the chance to reduce the advantage with 18 minutes left but was denied a penalty by VAR after Lucas Klostermann's tackle. Two minutes Modeste then wasted a one-on-one with Peter Gulasci and Nagelsmann's Leipzig held on for three points."

However, Nagelsmann was furious that Leipzig conceded a weak goal from a corner with only nine minutes gone when Hertha midfielder Marko Grujic, on loan from Liverpool, fired home unmarked. ""We started well, but fell behind because we defend a set piece like a school team,"" fumed Nagelsmann. ""We simply did nothing, everyone is standing in position, yet he (Grujic) could finish with his foot, in the box. ""This is the second time in a row in a home game that we conceded from a set piece,"" said Nagelsmann whose team drew 1-1 against Freiburg in their last home game. ""We have to blame ourselves for this. We're happy that we scored another point, but I'm not happy at all."" Piatek, who joined Hertha in January for around 25 million euros ($27 million) from AC Milan, netted his second goal in nine Bundesliga matches when he fired home a penalty on 82 minutes. Piatek's penalty snatched a point, stretched Bruno Labbadia's unbeaten record as Hertha head coach to three games and spared the blushes of Jarstein. The Norwegian shot-stopper was embarrassed when he parried an effort by Leipzig striker Patrik Schick but allowed the ball to roll over his flailing arm and into his net to make it 2-1 on 68 minutes. Leipzig had just been reduced to 10 men when defender Marcel Halstenberg was sent off for a second yellow card after a late foul on Brazil Under-23 striker Cunha, who was playing against the club he left in January. The first-half finished 1-1 after Hertha took an early lead when Grujic volleyed into the top corner with nine minutes gone. The hosts fought back and equalised when defender Lukas Klostermann headed home a corner with 24 minutes gone. The result leaves Leipzig third in the table, two points behind Dortmund, beaten 1-0 on Tuesday by leaders Bayern Munich who are seven points clear and on course for an eighth straight German league title. ""Today it (three points) was on a silver platter and we didn't take it,"" added Nagelsmann. Schalke are winless in ten games as their free fall down the table continued with a 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Fortuna Duesseldorf. US midfielder Weston McKennie gave Schalke the lead just after the break with a diving header, but Fortuna hit back with two goals in five minutes from Rouwen Hennings and Kenan Karaman. Schalke's third straight defeat leaves them ninth having been third in December. Cologne striker Mark Uth failed to convert a penalty for the second game in a row in his side's 3-1 defeat at Hoffenheim as both teams finished with ten men. Austria midfielder Christoph Baumgartner could have finished with a hat-trick after opening the scoring early on, had a goal ruled offside then scored with a header just after the break. Cologne were reduced to 10 men when Belgian defender Sebastian Bornauw was shown a straight red for fouling Baumgartner, who set up defender Steven Zuber to leave Hoffenheim 3-0 up early in the second-half. Hoffenheim had defender Benjamin Huebner sent off for a second yellow card on 51 minutes before Florian Kainz gave Cologne hope with a goal on the hour mark. Uth, who also had a penalty saved in Sunday's draw with Duesseldorf, had his spot-kick saved on 77 minutes when Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann guessed the right corner. Bottom side Paderborn earned a point in a goalless draw at Augsburg, while mid-table Union Berlin drew 1-1 with Mainz in the capital."

Piatek, who joined Hertha in January for around 25 million euros ($27 million) from AC Milan, netted his second goal in nine Bundesliga matches when he fired home a penalty on 82 minutes. Piatek's penalty snatched a point, stretched Bruno Labbadia's unbeaten record as Hertha head coach to three games and spared the blushes of Jarstein. The Norwegian shot-stopper was embarrassed when he parried an effort by Leipzig striker Patrik Schick but allowed the ball to roll over his flailing arm and into his net to make it 2-1 on 68 minutes. Leipzig had just been reduced to 10 men when defender Marcel Halstenberg was sent off for a second yellow card after a late foul on Brazil Under-23 striker Cunha, who was playing against the club he left in January. The first-half finished 1-1 after Hertha took an early lead when Grujic volleyed into the top corner with nine minutes gone. The hosts fought back and equalised when defender Lukas Klostermann headed home a corner with 24 minutes gone. The result leaves Leipzig third in the table, two points behind Dortmund, beaten 1-0 on Tuesday by leaders Bayern Munich who are seven points clear and on course for an eighth straight German league title. ""Today it (three points) was on a silver platter and we didn't take it,"" added Nagelsmann. Schalke are winless in ten games as their free fall down the table continued with a 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Fortuna Duesseldorf. US midfielder Weston McKennie gave Schalke the lead just after the break with a diving header, but Fortuna hit back with two goals in five minutes from Rouwen Hennings and Kenan Karaman. Schalke's third straight defeat leaves them ninth having been third in December. Cologne striker Mark Uth failed to convert a penalty for the second game in a row in his side's 3-1 defeat at Hoffenheim as both teams finished with ten men. Austria midfielder Christoph Baumgartner could have finished with a hat-trick after opening the scoring early on, had a goal ruled offside then scored with a header just after the break. Cologne were reduced to 10 men when Belgian defender Sebastian Bornauw was shown a straight red for fouling Baumgartner, who set up defender Steven Zuber to leave Hoffenheim 3-0 up early in the second-half. Hoffenheim had defender Benjamin Huebner sent off for a second yellow card on 51 minutes before Florian Kainz gave Cologne hope with a goal on the hour mark. Uth, who also had a penalty saved in Sunday's draw with Duesseldorf, had his spot-kick saved on 77 minutes when Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann guessed the right corner. Bottom side Paderborn earned a point in a goalless draw at Augsburg, while mid-table Union Berlin drew 1-1 with Mainz in the capital."
68,26/05/2020,15:29,Leipzig's Poulsen out for 'foreseeable future',RB Leipzig forward Yussuf Poulsen could be out for the rest of the season after the Bundesliga club said on Tuesday he had damaged ligaments in his right ankle.,"Leipzig said an MRI scan on Monday showed the Denmark international ""suffered ligament damage to his right ankle in yesterday's win at Mainz and will be out for the foreseeable future"". Poulsen, 25, was injured after a heavy tackle early in the 5-0 win at Mainz, which moved Leipzig move up to third in the Bundesliga behind leaders Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, who meet on Tuesday. Despite the blow to his ankle, Poulsen played the full 90 minutes against Mainz, scoring with a powerful header and setting up two more goals. The injury leaves Poulsen at risk of missing the rest of the Bundesliga season, which is due to finish on June 27 after ending a two-month hiatus forced by the coronavirus pandemic. In his absence, Czech Republic striker Patrik Schick, on loan from Roma, is set to partner Timo Werner up front against Hertha Berlin on Wednesday. Under new coach Bruno Labbadia, Hertha won their two matches since the restart with a 3-0 romp at Hoffenheim and a 4-0 thrashing of Union Berlin last Friday. Leipzig will face Brazil Under-23 striker Matheus Cunha, who has scored in Hertha's last four games following his January transfer from Leipzig for 18 million euros ($19 million)."
69,24/05/2020,17:48,Werner bags hat-trick as Leipzig trounce Mainz,Timo Werner bagged a hat-trick as RB Leipzig routed Mainz 5-0 behind closed doors on Sunday to climb to third in the German league table as the striker moved to within three goals of the Bundesliga's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski.,"It was the 24-year-old's third Bundesliga hat-trick having also netted three times when Leipzig romped to an 8-0 home win against Mainz last November. Werner's treble leaves him on 24 goals, while Bayern Munich striker Lewandowski claimed his 27th Bundesliga goal this season in the league leader's 5-2 win over Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. Leipzig's victory was the tenth win for the visiting team in 17 matches since the Bundesliga restarted last weekend. Werner opened the scoring in Mainz after 11 minutes when he converted a low cross. Yussuf Poulsen then marked his 250th appearance for Leipzig by heading home a Marcel Sabitzer cross on 23 minutes. The pair reversed roles for the third when Poulsen laid a pass off to Sabitzer who showed great finishing to make it 3-0 at the break. Werner grabbed his second goal three minutes into the second-half when Kevin Kampl played him into the area. The visitors were attacking at will when Kampl had a goal ruled out for offside soon after. With 15 minutes left, Poulsen's floated free-kick was met by Werner who volleyed past Mainz goalkeeper Florian Mueller to wrap up his hat-trick. The win leaves Leipzig third and seven points behind leaders Bayern. Augsburg also enjoyed an away win with a 3-0 romp at Schalke. Heiko Herrlich enjoyed a perfect first Bundesliga game on the touchline as Augsburg coach, a week after he missed the loss to Wolfsburg because he broke quarantine rules to buy toothpaste. David Wagner's Schalke continued their slide down the table, falling to eighth following another poor defensive display. Eduard Loewen, Noah Sarenren Bazee and Sergio Cordova scored as Augsburg moved seven points clear of the relegation play-off place. ""I'm totally happy,"" said Herrlich, whose team host the league's bottom side Paderborn on Wednesday. ""We'll be celebrating quietly, because we don't have much time. ""But we have managed to turn things around,"" he added after Augsburg ended a run of four straight defeats. The 48-year-old Herrlich apologised to his squad after breaking a week-long coronavirus quarantine by leaving the team hotel -- to buy toothpaste and skin cream -- before the Wolfsburg match last weekend. With Herrlich back in charge, Augsburg enjoyed their first win in seven league games. Having been as high as third last December, Schalke are winless in their last nine league games, including last Saturday's 4-0 drubbing at Borussia Dortmund. ""We were extremely stupid at the start,"" fumed Schalke coach David Wagner. Loewen gave the visitors the lead after just five minutes with a superb free-kick which flew into the top corner from 30 metres out at a near-empty Veltins Arena. Augsburg doubled their lead 14 minutes from time when Schalke defender Salif Sane was wrong-footed by a long ball and substitute winger Bazee rifled home. Cordova came off the bench to score in injury time, latching onto a loose pass from Sane, rounding goalkeeper Markus Schubert and firing into an empty net. Augsburg host Paderborn on Wednesday, the same day Schalke visit strugglers Fortuna Duesseldorf, who occupy the relegation play-off spot in 16th."
70,17/05/2020,21:04,Five things from the Bundesliga comeback,Bayern Munich maintained their four-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga as Germany gave fans across the world their first taste of elite football for two months amid empty stands and stringent hygiene guidelines designed to curtail the spread of the coronavirus.,"AFP looks at the five things we learned from one of oddest weekends in the game's history. The Bundesliga has a head start of at least a month on the other major leagues aiming to restart this summer, and some of strange scenes seen in Germany will become the new normal should football return to England, Italy and Spain. La Liga and Serie A are aiming for mid-June as a potential start date for their suspended seasons, and fans in both countries may have to get used to silent, empty stadiums, socially-distanced goal celebrations, footballers in face masks and the spectre of players catching COVID-19. Italy's clubs for example are debating a medical protocol that currently rules that if a player tests positive for the virus he and anyone who has come into close contact with him must be quarantined for two weeks, in contrast to Germany where only the player is isolated. How Bundesliga teams fare under their hygiene regulations could provide the model for the coming months. Heading into his team's tough trip to giant-killers Union Berlin, Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick wondered whether his team would be able to last a full 90 minutes after only being given the go-ahead to resume full team training last week. However a dominant display in the German capital, against a team that had already beaten two different league leaders at home this season, showed why they are the strongly-tipped to win their eighth straight league title. Bayern had two thirds of possession at the Alten Foesterei stadium, and once Robert Lewandowski slotted home his 26th league goal of the season from the penalty spot five minutes before the break, the result was never in doubt as the champions went on to claim a 2-0 win. In the aftermath of Dortmund's 4-0 thumping of Ruhr rivals Schalke, teen striking sensation Erling Braut Haaland was a young man of few words with the awaiting media desperate for something from the 19-year-old goal machine. However, according to AFP subsidiary SID, Haaland mumbled a total of eight English words to reporters, including ""Why not?"" and ""Yes"". It didn't really matter, as Haaland had done his talking on the pitch, picking up where he left off before the world went into virus lockdown. The Norwegian, who turns 20 this summer, swept home the opener, the league's first goal of its restart, before laying on the first of Raphael Guerreiro's brace, showing once again that he is Europe's player to watch. He has 41 goals this season in all competitions and 13 for Dortmund in just 12 games since joining in January from Red Bull Salzburg. Specialist website DWDL.de reported on Sunday that over six million people in Germany watched the first top-tier matches in two months, with 3.68 million tuning into broadcaster Sky Germany's subscription channels on Saturday. A further 2.45 million tuned into the 'Konferenz' -- a simultaneous live broadcast of the five afternoon games -- on free-to-air Sports News Channel. Sky Germany had a market share of 27.4 percent on their pay-to-view channels and 18.2 percent on their free channel. The German Football League (DFL) told AFP that matches were televised by more than 70 broadcasters worldwide, all on previously-agreed deals. British newspaper the Daily Mail reports that UK viewers were left frustrated as the BT Sport application showing the matches buckled under the weight of demand from fans. Germany has one of the world's most vibrant football fan cultures, with raucous fans packing stadiums where entrance fees are priced at a fraction of what Premier League fans have to shell out. And while millions tuned in to watch some live football, a significant portion of match-going supporters are livid at the idea of games going ahead without the noisy backdrop provided by German fans. On Saturday Augsburg fans left a banner inside their team's ground which read ""Football gives life -- your business is sick"". St Pauli, meanwhile, on Sunday published a picture on Twitter of a banner that read: ""Football lives through its fans! Without you, it's all nothing!"""
71,16/05/2020,17:36,Leipzig title hopes hit by Freiburg draw on Bundesliga restart,"RB Leipzig were held to a 1-1 draw by Freiburg as the Bundesliga restarted following the coronavirus suspension on Saturday, suffering a further knock to their dwindling title hopes.","Julian Nagelsmann's third-placed side sit four points behind league leaders Bayern Munich ahead of the reigning champions' visit to Union Berlin on Sunday, and it would have been worse if Freiburg midfielder Robin Koch's late effort had not been ruled out by VAR. Leipzig's title dreams had started to slip away before the lockdown started, as back-to-back draws with Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg in March had seen them fall five points off the pace. Players and coaches sitting on the bench wore protective masks in compliance with the stringent safety guidelines implemented to allow the Bundesliga to resume before Europe's other top leagues. The hosts started brightly at an eerily-quiet Red Bull Arena, with Timo Werner and Nordi Mukiele both going close to opening the scoring in the first half an hour. But Freiburg claimed a surprise lead 12 minutes before half-time as Vincenzo Grifo's low corner was diverted in by centre-back Manuel Gulde. Leipzig continued to dominate possession in the second period and wasted a golden chance in the 57th minute as on-loan Everton winger Ademola Lookman volleyed wide when totally unmarked just yards from goal. Freiburg had to rely on their goalkeeper the next time Leipzig carved them open, as Alexander Schwolow stretched out a leg to brilliantly deny Werner a 28th goal of the season. Leipzig gave themselves fresh hope of turning the game around in the 77th minute, though, as Yussuf Poulsen headed past Schwolow. The home side pushed for a winner, as Marcel Sabitzer and Patrik Schick joined Lookman in coming off the bench, but failed to carve out another clear-cut opportunity. Instead, it was Freiburg who thought they had snatched a dramatic injury-time victory, only for Koch's close-range finish to be ruled out for offside following a VAR review."

73,11/03/2020,14:45,Spurs forced back to drawing board after Champions League collapse,Tottenham's 4-0 aggregate thrashing by Leipzig added the misery of an early Champions League exit to a season in which the 2019 finalists have been brought crashing back down to earth.,"A never-say-die spirit carried Spurs to the club's first-ever final in Europe's top club competition last year after memorable fightbacks at Barcelona, Manchester City and Ajax. Faced with the same mountain to climb, there was nothing left in the Tottenham tank during a 3-0 defeat in Leipzig on Tuesday. The comeback against Ajax in the semi-finals was arguably the high point of Mauricio Pochettino's five-and-a-half-year spell in charge that turned his team from Europa League regulars into Champions League contenders. Less than six months after Tottenham's 2-0 defeat to Liverpool in the Madrid final, Pochettino was replaced by Jose Mourinho, and it appears even the Portuguese does not believe their run as a Champions League club will continue next season. ""With the squad we have at the moment it's going to be very, very difficult,"" said Mourinho, whose side sit eighth in the Premier League, seven points adrift of the top four. ""These problems are not going to disappear from today to tomorrow."" A run of six games without a win is the worst of Mourinho's long managerial career. However, there are mitigating circumstances. The loss of Harry Kane and Son Heung-min to long-term injuries has robbed him of Tottenham's two main goal threats. January signing Steven Bergwijn is also set to miss the rest of the season, while Moussa Sissoko has been a big miss in midfield. ""I think every team in the world would struggle with five or six of their most important players missing, it is as simple as that,"" said Mourinho. ""All the players that were on the Leipzig bench, in my team they would play."" Yet, it is hard to see how Mourinho's negativity is helping his squad to do any more than limp towards the end of the season. ""A broken team that under the joyless stewardship of Jose Mourinho has been broken still further,"" wrote the Guardian. ""They looked here exactly what they are: the eighth-best team in the Premier League, exhausted and error-prone, bad in defence and bad in attack, with no discernible long-term strategy and no identifiable short-term plan."" As Leipzig roared into the last eight for the first time in the club's history, Tottenham were offered a mirror image of what they once were in the peak years of Pochettino's reign. The Germans are a young, hungry, energetic, exciting team led by one most coveted emerging managers in European football in Julian Nagelsmann. Spurs are paying the price for not building on the foundations laid by Pochettino. Not a single player was signed for 18 months between January 2018 and July 2019 that put a huge strain on a stretched squad. Funds were finally released last summer but the Argentine was sacked just three months into the season after more than £100 million ($129 million) was spent on Tanguy Ndombele, Ryan Sessegnon and Giovani Lo Celso. Even as Mourinho has bemoaned his lack of resources, Ndombele and Sessegnon have rarely featured, with the French midfielder receiving stinging public criticism from his coach after Saturday's 1-1 draw at Burnley. Mourinho was keen to stress he does not foresee a summer overhaul in the transfer market. ""When we start (next season) we will have Sissoko, Kane, Son, Bergwijn and Ben Davies, so that is massive,"" he said. But if they do not have Champions League football to look forward to, holding onto some of those stars and starting the cycle all over again will be a tougher task. ""Tottenham's current travails merely underline what a stunning job Pochettino did for those few magical seasons,"" added the Guardian. That is little consolation for Spurs, who appear back where they started when Pochettino was appointed nearly six years ago."
74,11/03/2020,01:31,Weak Spurs exposed as Leipzig cruise into Champions League quarters,Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli questioned his side's mental strength after RB Leipzig cruised to a 3-0 win on Tuesday to progress 4-0 on aggregate to the quarter-finals for the first time.,"Leipzig captain Marcel Sabitzer struck twice in the first 21 minutes before substitute Emil Forsberg added the third late on with his first touch. ""We were second to a lot of balls. To concede them goals shows our mentality wasn't strong enough,"" added Alli. ""We had to show maturity and fight and we didn't do that and we were punished."" Unlike many fixtures across Europe this week, there were no restrictions on supporters attending due to the spread of coronavirus and the Leipzig fans were able to enjoy a nerve-free evening. Spurs travelled to eastern Germany shorn of striking options without the injured Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Steven Bergwijn. However, it was at the other end that they buckled inside the opening quarter of the game as two errors from goalkeeper Hugo Lloris turned a tough task into an impossible one. Leipzig took just 10 minutes to open the scoring when Lloris did not get a strong enough right hand to stop Sabitzer's strike from outside the box finding the bottom corner. Timo Werner then fired home from close range only to be denied by the offside flag as Leipzig opened up the Tottenham defence at will. And the visitors did not learn their lesson as Sabitzer met Angelino's cross with a powerful header, but Lloris should still have done better to keep the ball out at his near post. Tottenham have now failed to win their last six games in all competitions -- the longest winless streak of Jose Mourinho's managerial career. And the Portuguese again blamed that run on his lack of options due to an injury list that also includes Moussa Sissoko, Davinson Sanchez and Ben Davies. ""People can say excuses but I'm pretty sure it is bad for anyone,"" said Mourinho. ""I don't think anyone would resist to such a situation."" Spurs produced a remarkable fightback from 3-0 down on aggregate away at Ajax in last season's semi-finals to make the final for the first time in the club's history thanks to Lucas Moura's hat-trick. But in keeping with their collapse since that night in Amsterdam last May, Mourinho's men lacked the quality and belief needed to reproduce that thrilling fightback. Forsberg took just 32 seconds after replacing Sabitzer to fire the third goal into the far corner three minutes from time. ""It's a great moment for the history of the club, for me as a manager, and for my young team,"" said Leipzig's 32-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann. ""It's totally deserved we go to the next round. We were the better team, scored four goals, conceded none, so we are very happy."" Tottenham's season now hinges on refinding their domestic form if they are not to miss out on the Champions League next season for the first time in five years. Spurs are eighth in the Premier League, seven points adrift of the top four, and in desperate need for Mourinho to exact revenge on Manchester United for his sacking last season when the Red Devils visit north London on Sunday. ""We know this hasn't been a good season but we can't hide,"" added Alli. ""Confidence is gone at the minute but we have a big game at the weekend and we have to pick ourselves up and go again."""
75,10/03/2020,23:04,Leipzig cruise past Spurs into Champions League quarters,Tottenham crashed out of the Champions League as RB Leipzig cruised to a 3-0 win on Tuesday to progress to the quarter-finals for the first time 4-0 on aggregate.,"Leipzig captain Marcel Sabitzer struck twice in the first 21 minutes to put the tie to bed before substitute Emil Forsberg added the third late on with his first touch. Unlike many fixtures across Europe this week, there were no restrictions on supporters attending due to the spread of coronavirus and the Leipzig fans were able to enjoy a nerve-free evening. Spurs travelled to eastern Germany shorn of striking options without the injured Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Steven Bergwijn. However, it was at the other end that they buckled inside the opening quarter of the game as two errors from Hugo Lloris in goal turned a tough task into an impossible one. Mourinho left club record signing Tanguy Ndombele on the bench after publicly criticising the French midfielder's desire in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Burnley, but the switch to a 3-4-3 formation did little to prevent Spurs' winless streak in all competitions stretching to six games. Leipzig took just 10 minutes to open the scoring when Lloris did not get a strong enough right hand to stop Sabitzer's strike from outside the box finding the bottom corner. Timo Werner then fired home from close range only to be denied by the offside flag as Leipzig opened up the Tottenham defence at will. And the visitors did not learn their lesson as Serge Aurier was caught napping by a purposeful burst from Angelino. The Manchester City loanee's cross was met by a powerful header by Sabitzer, but Lloris should still have done better to keep the ball out at his near post. Lloris did make some measure of amends by saving from Werner and Patrik Schick to keep the score down before half-time, while at the other end Peter Gulasci was finally forced into action by Erik Lamela. Spurs produced a remarkable fightback from 3-0 down on aggregate away at Ajax in last season's semi-finals to make the final for the first time in the club's history thanks to Lucas Moura's hat-trick. But in keeping with their collapse since that night in Amsterdam last May, Mourinho's men lacked the quality and belief needed to reproduce that thrilling fightback. Moura was again the one source of inspiration as he teed up Dele Alli for Spurs' best chance of the night, but the England midfielder's mishit effort was easily saved by Gulasci. Forsberg was more clinical just 32 seconds after replacing Sabitzer to fire into the far corner three minutes from time. Tottenham's season now hinges on refinding their form in the Premier League if they are not to miss out on the Champions League for the first time in five years. Spurs are languishing in eighth in the Premier League, seven points adrift of the top four, and in desperate need for Mourinho to exact revenge on Manchester United for his sacking last season when the Red Devils visit north London on Sunday."
76,09/03/2020,14:17,Fans allowed at Leipzig v Tottenham Champions League clash: city,"Supporters of RB Leipzig and Tottenham Hotspur will be allowed to attend the second leg of their Champions League last 16 tie, authorities in the German city announced on Monday, despite the coronavirus outbreak.","""This decision applies for this match only,"" Leipzig city spokesman Matthias Hasberg told SID, an AFP subsidiary. Leipzig host Spurs at the Red Bull Arena on Tuesday with a 1-0 lead from the first leg last month. The city explained the decision by saying that England is ""not a high risk area"" for the virus while match tickets are ""personalised"" and easily traceable -- minimising the risk of contagion. The Saxony region has up to now been left largely untouched by the outbreak of COVID-19, with 10 cases of the 1,112 recorded in Germany according to official figures released on Monday morning. This decision however goes against the recommendation of the country's health minister Jens Spahn, who on Sunday requested that all events with more than 1,000 people be cancelled ""until further notice"". The news comes after police in Paris ordered Paris Saint-Germain's match with Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday to be played behind closed doors, with the Ligue 1 champions looking to overturn a 2-1 first leg deficit. bur-dac/cfe/td/cw <org>TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR</org>"
77,09/03/2020,03:45,TV star Werner dreams of 'big team' future,"Ahead of what is the most important home game in the club's brief history, RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner believes he has the ""potential to play for a big team"".","Leipzig welcome Tottenham to the Red Bull Arena on Tuesday in the Champions League last 16. They are favoured to go through to the quarter-finals, holding a 1-0 advantage after winning in London thanks to a 58th-minute Werner penalty. Speaking as part of an interview for Sky TV Germany's ""The Timo Werner Special"", to be aired before the game, he said: ""I have the potential to play for a big team."" While the quote may have appeared to be a slight dig against his current side, Werner suggested his attitude reflects his desire to improve rather than simply a wish to move on. ""I believe it would be different (at a bigger club) because the pressure would be much greater."" Werner, who turned 24 on Friday, said he needed to improve his consistency to a point where he ""shows Timo Werner exists in 30 out of 30 games, not 28 out of 30"". ""For me, having (consistency) in mind is one thing I still have to learn. To be there 100 percent every game, to know every game, to understand that each game is about the championship. ""At the end of the day you need to become a champion -- that's always the case with big clubs."" Werner, who has been heavily linked to Liverpool as well as fellow Bundesliga title hopefuls Bayern Munich, has scored 21 times in 25 league games this season -- second only to the man who may keep him out at Munich, Robert Lewandowski with 25. Werner was subbed on in the 60th minute in his side's 0-0 draw away at Wolfsburg at the weekend after overcoming a muscle injury but was unable to snatch a valuable goal for his side. The Stuttgart-born Werner will be front and centre for Germany in this year's European Championships, having locked down the role with some strong performances for club and country after a disappointing World Cup in 2018. But while Werner may have one eye on this summer's competition, he's been unable to hide his admiration for another Stuttgart-born hero of German football -- Jurgen Klopp. Speaking to Sky in late February, Werner said the current European champions were the ""best team in the world at the moment"" and he was ""honoured to be linked with them"". ""Klopp is the best coach in the world at the moment. There is a lot to suggest that my style of play would suit it there,"" said Werner. Never one to engage in transfer speculation, the German manager was coy when asked if Liverpool planned to chase Werner to join a front-line including Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane amid reports the German's release clause stood at a relatively low 51 million euros. ""From my point of view, it's obviously nice (that he wants to come here) but that's all I can say about it,"" said Klopp."
78,09/03/2020,03:40,Spurs' spiral the sign of a club in decline,Tottenham travel to Leipzig on Tuesday needing to overturn a 1-0 first leg deficit to prevent adding an early Champions League exit to a season spiralling out of control.,"Saturday's 1-1 draw at Burnley stopped the rot of four consecutive defeats in all competitions that has seen Jose Mourinho's men fall behind in the race for a top four finish in the Premier League and eliminated from the FA Cup by bottom-of-the-table Norwich. Failure to fight back in Germany will also halt the progress Spurs have made in the Champions League in recent years. Under Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham went further in the competition for each of the past three seasons, culminating in a rollercoaster run to the final last season. Rather than using defeat in Madrid to Liverpool last June as a springboard to continue competing with the European elite, Spurs have unravelled. Pochettino was sacked just three months into this season after five-and-a-half years in charge that transformed the club's fortunes. Rather than follow the template of Pochettino's appointment with a young and forward-thinking coach like Leipzig's Julian Nagelsmann, Spurs chairman Daniel Levy was wowed by Mourinho's past. The Portuguese has 25 trophies to his name, but the last of them came three years ago and recent spells at Chelsea and Manchester United did little to suggest he was the man to take Spurs forward. So it has proved with Mourinho's negativity contributing to the gloom around the club. After losing Harry Kane and Son Heung-min to injury, Mourinho has repeatedly stated the end of the season cannot come soon enough. The 57-year-old is quick to bemoan his lack of resources at what is now the eighth richest club in the world, according to Deloitte's Football Money League. However, he was scathing of Tottenham's club record signing Tanguy Ndombele after hooking the French midfielder at half-time on Saturday. ""My thinking was that in the first half we didn't have a midfield. Simple as that,"" he said. ""I'm not going to run away and I have to say that Tanguy had enough time to come to a different level. ""I know that the Premier League is very difficult. For some players, it takes a long time to adapt to a different league, but a player with this potential and responsibility has to give us more than he is giving us."" Mourinho dressing down an underperforming star player in public is nothing new, but evidence from his previous clubs suggests it does little good. At 23, and in his first season in England, it is questionable as to whether Mourinho's criticism of Ndombele is the best way for Spurs to realise the potential of their £63 million ($82 million) signing. Levy also has to bear his share of the blame for Spurs' decline. As he oversaw a £1 billion project for the club's new stadium that ran well over budget and time, he allowed Pochettino's squad to stagnate without a single signing between January 2018 and August 2019. At the same time, Levy demanded exorbitant fees for players that could have been sold to reinvest in the squad and saw many of those assets depreciate. Christian Eriksen was sold to Inter Milan in January for a cut-price £17 million with just six months left on his contract. Levy faces another crossroads come the end of a season that Mourinho so desires. Does he back his bet on an experienced coach by meeting his demands in the transfer market, or cut his losses on a coach he signed until 2023 in November on a reported £15 million a year?"

""Unfortunately ... amidst the great uncertainty surrounding this topic ... a mistake was made on our part,"" the statement continued. ""We would like to extend our apologies."" Leipzig added that they were trying to contact the fans, reportedly as many as 20, in order to invite them to their next home game. While not as badly affected as nearby Italy, cases of coronavirus in Germany rose to 157 on Monday, up from 129 the previous day. Otherwise known as COVID-19, the virus has now spread to 10 of Germany's 16 states, with more than half the confirmed cases in North Rhine-Westphalia, the country's most populous state. Leipzig's draw with Leverkusen left them three points behind Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich."
80,22/02/2020,20:52,"Leipzig run riot at Schalke, Haaland hits 40th goal of season","RB Leipzig stayed within a point of Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga after a 5-0 thrashing of Schalke on Saturday, while Erling Braut Haaland scored his 40th goal of the season in Borussia Dortmund's 2-0 win at Werder Bremen.","Leipzig remain second in the table after captain Marcel Sabitzer opened the scoring with less than a minute gone in Gelsenkirchen with a powerful drive. Germany striker Timo Werner, defender Marcel Halstenberg, new signing Angelino and playmaker Emil Forsberg added second-half goals as Leipzig built on their 1-0 mid-week Champions League win at Tottenham with another impressive away display. Leipzig sit just behind Bayern who squeezed past bottom side Paderborn on Friday when Robert Lewandowski netted twice in a 3-2 victory. Sabitzer gave Leipzig a spectacular lead by smashing a long-range shot past goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel. An hour later, Werner claimed his 21st league goal by rifling into the top corner past Nuebel, who will join Bayern for 2020/21. It turned into a rout when Halstenberg headed Leipzig's third goal on 68 minutes, then Angelino, on loan from Manchester City, beat two defenders for their fourth on 81 minutes. In the dying stages, Leipzig winger Christopher Nkunku produced his fourth assist to tee-up Forsberg, on for Werner, to fire home. Earlier, Haaland, 19, scored his 12th goal in eight games for Dortmund at Bremen to keep Lucien Favre's side third in the table, four points behind Bayern. Haaland, who scored twice in Tuesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg win over Paris Saint-Germain, also netted 28 goals for Salzburg before joining Dortmund for 20 million euros ($22 million) in December. Dortmund ground out victory after showing some early nerves in Bremen where they crashed to a 3-2 German Cup defeat earlier this month. ""We allowed them almost nothing and controlled the game more in the second half,"" said Dortmund midfielder Emre Can. ""Then Bremen got tired and we scored our goals at the right time."" Centre-back Dan-Axel Zagadou gave the visitors the lead by volleying home a Jadon Sancho corner on 52 minutes. ""Another crappy goal conceded from a dead-ball situation. It's getting very tight for us now,"" said Bremen's Dutch midfielder Davy Klaassen whose side are second from bottom. Haaland doubled the advantage by drilling Achraf Hakimi's square ball into the corner on 66 minutes to score his ninth Bundesliga goal. After five straight league defeats, Bremen remain 17th and five points from safety. They suffered another blow in the relegation battle as Fortuna Duesseldorf, who are a place above them, enjoyed a 2-0 win at Freiburg. Fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach slipped six points behind Bayern, albeit with a game in hand, as Lucas Ribeiro's injury-time strike snatched Hoffenheim a 1-1 draw at Borussia Park. Matthias Ginter had powered in an early opener for Gladbach, but the hosts were made to pay after Alassane Plea saw a 75th-minute penalty saved by Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann. Despite splashing out 77 million euros ($83 million) on transfers in January, Hertha Berlin's poor form continued in a 5-0 thrashing at home to Cologne. Hertha were brought crashing back down to earth after Alexander Nouri won his first game in charge following Jurgen Klinsmann's shock resignation last weekend at Paderborn. The home side defended woefully and were 2-0 down inside 22 minutes as Jhon Cordoba scored an early double. The Colombian striker exploited a four-on-two situation for his first goal and easily escaped his marker to head in the second. Midfielder Florian Kanz added two goals of his own before Mark Uth curled home a free-kick 20 minutes from time as Hertha capitulated. There was a minute's silence at all grounds before kick-off in Germany's top flight to honour the nine victims of the Hanau shootings earlier this week."
81,07/02/2020,03:15,In-form Bayern out to 'boss' Leipzig in Bundesliga showdown,"After getting a mid-week ""wake-up call"" in the German Cup, Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich are relishing the chance to prove their might in a top-of-the-table clash at home to RB Leipzig on Sunday.","Bayern's sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic insists the defending champions want to show nearest rivals Leipzig ""who is the boss"" at Munich's Allianz Area. Salihamidzic said the hosts are embracing ""the role of favourites"", adding that Leipzig had been ""weakened a bit"" by poor results. Bayern swept to the top of the table last weekend for the first time since October and have won their last eight games. However, Hoffenheim found plenty of space to attack in Wednesday's German Cup third-round tie as Bayern conceded two goals in the final 10 minutes as a comfortable 4-1 lead became a nervy 4-3 victory. ""Perhaps it's quite good to realise before the Leipzig game, that things won't simply work of their own accord,"" admitted Bayern midfielder Joshua Kimmich. Head coach Hansi Flick called the narrow win a ""wake-up call"". Leipzig, who spent more than a month over Christmas top of the table, have had cold water poured on their title aspirations in recent weeks. A shock 2-0 loss at Eintracht Frankfurt a fortnight ago cost them a four-point lead. Then Bayern went a point ahead at the top after Leipzig's 2-2 draw at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach last Saturday. Another loss at Frankfurt in mid-week, when top-scoring striker Timo Werner and playmaker Emil Forsberg both started on the bench, saw Leipzig dumped them out of the German Cup. ""Leipzig will want to show a reaction,"" Kimmich said. Sunday's clash will also see the league's leading scorer Robert Lewandowski, who has 22 goals in 20 games, go head-to-head with his nearest rival Werner, who is on 20. Before Bayern and Leipzig slug it out, third-placed Borussia Dortmund could go top on Saturday with a win at Bayer Leverkusen. Erling Braut Haaland, 19, has a record eight goals in his first four games for Dortmund, who were knocked out of the German Cup in midweek when they went down 3-2 at Werder Bremen. Sports director Michael Zorc slammed the team for playing ""listlessly, comfortably and slowly"". Haaland has yet to play a full 90 minutes for Dortmund as he works his way back to full fitness after a knee injury in December. Lewandowski is making the headlines with 35 goals in 29 games after scoring two more in Wednesday's cup win against Hoffenheim. However, a big factor is the space and chances being created behind him by Mueller, who has seven goals and nine assists in the 14 games since Flick replaced Niko Kovac as head coach in November. Mueller's form has sparked debate in Germany over whether head coach Joachim Loew should recall the player for Euro 2020 despite telling the 30-year-old last March that his international career is over. 180 - The minutes Haaland has needed to score eight goals in four games for Dortmund. 22 - The goals Lewandowski has scored in 22 league games. Only Gerd Mueller, in the 1972/73 season, has ever scored as many goals in the same number of games. 17 - The age of Dortmund midfielder Giovanni Reyna, who scored his first goal for the club in Tuesday's cup defeat at Bremen when he beat two defenders and curled his shot into the top corner. 44 - The goals Lewandowski and Mueller have scored between them for Bayern in all competitions this season.

Nagelsmann, their 32-year-old coach, responded to a disappointing performance by questioning whether his team has the right mentality to win the league for the first time in the club's short history, calling them ""still far from being a top team"". ""We need to decide whether or not we push towards the title, or whether we stay here, have something to eat and drink, and fall back into the pack,"" he added. Leipzig host third-placed Gladbach on Saturday, with a trip to face defending champions Bayern coming up next weekend. ""If you are completely honest, the coach was right,"" Hungarian shot-stopper Gulacsi told AFP in Leipzig. ""We hadn't implemented everything as we had discussed it during the week,"" before the Frankfurt defeat. ""The coach chose the right moment, it was important, and right, to get the team fired up before this important phase against Moenchengladbach and Bayern."" Leipzig entertain a Gladbach side sitting two points back in the title race, and any slip could let in Bayern, who face strugglers Mainz away on Saturday. ""We want a reaction. We want to bounce back, we want to show we have character,"" said the 29-year-old Gulacsi, once on the books at Liverpool. Leipzig won 3-1 away when the sides last met in August, but Gulacsi is wary of the threat posed by their attack, not least impressive French striker Alassane Plea. ""Their forward line has great speed and physical attributes, it's going to be a difficult game, but we are ready and want the three points at home."" Following the Frankfurt defeat, Leipzig's stars were slammed by senior club figure Ralf Rangnick after a celebrity hairdresser flew over from England to give a group of players pre-match trims. ""After a game like that, it looks a bit unfortunate,"" Gulacsi admitted. ""But the matter had no direct impact on the game and each player must know what he needs to get his best performance the next day."" After facing Gladbach and Bayern, Leipzig, who were only founded in 2009, play their first ever Champions League knock-out tie against Tottenham Hotspur, with the first leg in London on February 19. ""This is a big test and opportunity for us, these are important games to send a signal to our rivals,"" said Gulacsi. ""This is what you look forward to -- playing for the best places in the league and, to stay top, you have to beat your rivals. ""In the Champions League, these are the games we have been fighting to play in."" After he scored five goals in his first two Borussia Dortmund appearances, German bookmakers are offering short odds on the 'wunderkind' scoring more goals on his own than Saturday's opponents Union Berlin. The 19-year-old scored twice off the bench in last Friday's 5-1 trouncing of Cologne after claiming a hat-trick on his debut as a substitute in the 5-3 win at Augsburg. ""I just have to keep training and get into even better shape,"" he warned after last week's game. 59 - The number of minutes Haaland has needed to score his five Bundesliga goals. 21 - The number of league goals scored by Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski. At the same point in 2015/16, when he netted a career-best 30 goals, the Pole had a mere 17. 24 - The combined tally of league goals scored by Gladbach's attack of Plea, Breel Embolo, Patrick Herrmann and Marcus Thuram.

""In the first half, we didn't really know how we were ahead,"" admitted Werner, a few days after extending his contract with the club until 2023. ""We were a bit lucky, but it was good to score the second goal at the very beginning of the second half."" Leipzig, who were drawn in Champions League Group G alongside Zenit Saint-Petersburg, Benfica and Lyon on Thursday, had beaten Union Berlin and Eintracht Frankfurt in their first two games. They continued their strong form as Werner latched onto Emil Forsberg's through ball to slip a shot between the legs of Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer and give the visitors a 38th-minute lead at Borussia Park. Leipzig caught their hosts cold less than two minutes into the second period, as Yussuf Poulsen sent Werner racing in on goal again, and the 23-year-old made no mistake. He made it five goals in just three league appearances in the final minute of added time after Breel Embolo had briefly given the home fans some hope, slotting calmly into the bottom corner after a poor back-header by Matthias Ginter. A first defeat of the season leaves Gladbach seventh on four points. Last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund will have an opportunity to retake top spot when they visit promoted Union Berlin on Saturday, while reigning champions Bayern Munich host Mainz."
84,25/08/2019,17:57,'Comfortable' Werner fires Leipzig to nervy victory after contract extension,Timo Werner celebrated his new contract by helping RB Leipzig to a 2-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on Sunday.,"Werner, who has been linked with a move to Bayern Munich, signed a new deal which will keep him at Leipzig until 2023. ""I am happy about the contract extension and my goal, but most of all I am happy about the win,"" Werner told the club's official TV channel after the game. ""It means a lot to me that our fans celebrated so loudly after they announced the extension in the stadium."" The new contract was announced shortly before kick-off, and the 23-year-old Germany international promptly proved his worth by opening the scoring with a poacher's finish. With just 10 minutes on the clock, Werner hooked the ball in at the far post after Yussuf Poulsen had flicked it on at a corner. Poulsen appeared to have decided a tense game in the home side's favour with a sumptuous volley ten minutes from time. Leipzig, though, had to survive six nervy minutes of injury time after Goncalo Paciencia pulled one back for Frankfurt in the 89th minute. The win leaves Leipzig in joint second alongside Freiburg with six points from their first pair of games. Wolfsburg have also won two in two after they cruised to a 3-0 win at Hertha Berlin in Sunday's other game. Hertha had a penalty decision in their favour overturned by VAR in the first minute, and were left furious when Wolfsburg were given a spotkick at the other end shortly afterwards. The home side's protests of a handball fell on deaf ears, however, and Wout Weghorst stepped up to open the scoring for Wolfsburg. ""It's not up to me to comment on the referee's decision,"" Hertha coach Ante Covic told Sky. ""These people are always being judged from every possible angle."" Josip Brekalo doubled the lead eight minutes from time with a darting run into the box, and Jerome Roussillon smashed in the third in injury time."
85,25/08/2019,16:20,Bayern target Timo Werner extends contract at Leipzig,"Bayern Munich transfer target Timo Werner has signed a contract extension keeping him at RB Leipzig until 2023, the Bundesliga club confirmed on Sunday.","The announcement, which was made just before Leipzig's first home game of the season against Eintracht Frankfurt, ends speculation that Bayern would sign Werner on a free transfer in 2020. ""I am happy to have extended my contract. It was a long process, but I wanted to be completely sure that I could make the next steps in my development at this club,"" said Werner. The 23-year-old striker had previously held firm against all new contract offers, and openly hinted at his interest in a move to Munich last season. Yet Bayern's interest appeared to cool over the course of the summer, as the German champions instead signed Ivan Perisic and Philippe Coutinho on loan to bolster their attack. According to magazine Kicker, a new buyout clause in Werner's contract means Bayern would now have to pay around 30 million euros ($33.7 million) to bring the striker to Munich. Leipzig sporting director Markus Kroesche said the new contract was a ""positive signal"" for the club, as they look to challenge for the Bundesliga title under new coach Julian Nagelsmann. ""It underlines our aim to keep key players with us in the long term and to establish ourselves at the top of the league,"" he said."
86,18/08/2019,20:25,Leipzig dominate newcomers Union Berlin,"Julian Nagelsmann started his RB Leipzig career with a bang as his side hammered Bundesliga new boys Union Berlin 4-0, as the home fans staged a silent 15-minute protest against the visitors.","Leipzig, one of the favourites to challenge Bayern Munich for the Bundesliga title this season, were always going to provide Union with a difficult initiation. It was the first time the capital city outfit had conceded four goals at home since November 2014, when they lost 4-1 to 1860 Munich. Christopher Nkunku, who arrived from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer, scored just three minutes after being substituted on for Germany striker Timo Werner, who also got on the scoresheet. Marcel Halstenberg and Marcel Sabitzer also scored for the visitors, who took a 3-0 lead into halftime. Union Berlin fans used their debut fixture in the top-flight to stage a 15-minute silent protest aimed at opponents RB Leipzig's ownership by an energy drinks company. Home fans remained quiet for the opening quarter of an hour at the Stadion An der Alten Foersterei as an expression of their opposition to the way Leipzig are run. Red Bull controls the club in one of the few exceptions to German football's ""50+1"" principal that members should own a majority of shares. Ironically, the visitors took the lead 57 seconds through Halstenberg after the Union crowd began to chant for the first time. Midfielder Halstenberg took advantage of a seemingly unfocused Berlin, curling home while unmarked on the edge of the box. Leipzig coach Nagelsmann said his side were prepared for the boycott and used it to their advantage. ""For a coach it isn't so bad at all - you can talk directly to your players (from the sideline),"" he said. ""The boys knew that after 15 minutes it would get really loud - and the atmosphere was unbelievably good afterwards. ""I would always wish that the (Berlin) fans would give it everything from the opening whistle as it's a great atmosphere here at Union - unbelievable."" Leipzig added a second 15 minutes later as heavy rain began to fall, with Marcel Sabitzer punishing Berlin for a defensive mistake inside their own half. Werner added another in the 42nd minute with a powerful strike into the top corner, with the shellshocked home side struggling to keep up with the visitors' talented outfit. Nkunku's goal in the 69th minute made it 4-0. Union boss Urs Fischer said his team couldn't afford to give teams of Leipzig's quality so many chances. ""When you're playing against a Champions League participant... And you provide so many gifts as we did, you don't need to wonder why the score is 4-0 at the end of the match,"" he said. Earlier on Sunday, a Martin Hinteregger strike after 36 seconds was enough to see Eintracht Frankfurt to a narrow 1-0 victory over TSG Hoffenheim on Sunday in their opening game of the new Bundesliga season. After winning an early corner in the opening 10 seconds, the Hoffenheim defence was caught off guard when Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada played it short to winger Filip Kostic, who curled it to the waiting Hinteregger who volleyed into the top of the net. Kostic was a constant threat throughout for the home side, vindicating Frankfurt's decision to make his loan deal permanent during the summer. Despite the loss, the visitors put in a strong performance under new coach Alfred Schreuder, showing promise as the side enters the post-Nagelsmann era."

""Your planned boycott in the first 15 minutes is not good for us players,"" Gikiewicz, who started on Sunday, added."

Marcos Alvarez's 74th minute penalty then sparked fears of a late collapse for Leipzig, who were not the top-flight side to struggle on Sunday. 2018 cup winners Eintracht Frankfurt needed a late hat-trick from Ante Rebic to beat third-tier neighbours Waldhof Mannheim 5-3. Slow out of the blocks, Frankfurt were left stunned as Valmir Sulejmani struck twice in the opening 11 minutes to put Mannheim 2-0 up. Last season's Europa League semi-finalists quickly rallied, however, drawing level through fine goals from Daichi Kamada and Filip Kostic. Jan-Hendrik Marx's long-range screamer then put Mannheim back in front, before Rebic struck three times in the last 15 minutes to see Frankfurt through. Both of Berlin's Bundesliga teams reached the second round, Hertha and newly promoted Union Berlin seeing off fourth-tier opposition. Union waltzed to a 6-0 victory over Germania Halberstadt, while a brace from Vedad Ibisevic helped Hertha to a 5-1 win over VfB Eichstaett. Paderborn, also new arrivals in the top flight, were taken to extra-time by fourth-tier side Roedinghausen before eventually winning in a penalty shootout."

The England Under-21 international joined Everton from Charlton in 2017, scoring four goals in 48 matches for the club. He played 24 times in all competitions for manager Marco Silva last season, starting six games and scoring once. ""I'm very happy to be back here and would like to continue where I left off in the second half of 2018 for RB Leipzig,"" Lookman told the club's website.

""He is a dynamic player who can play in several positions and offers us several possibilities to vary our game."" The 21-year-old attacking midfielder came through the PSG youth system and since making his debut in December 2015 has made 78 appearances scoring 11 times. He appeared in 22 Ligue 1 matches last season, starting 13 times, but did not play in the Champions League. ""I am looking forward to wearing the RB Leipzig jersey. I am convinced that the club's style of play suits me very well,"" said Nkunku. Although skilful and capable of dazzling play, Nkunku has often been erratic and PSG need to balance their books to meet Financial Fair Play regulations. Leipzig already have two other young Frech players, 20-year-old defender Dayot Upamecano and another PSG youth product, 22-year-old striker Jean-Kevin Augustin."
91,04/06/2019,12:25,Rangnick steps down as sporting director,"RB Leipzig sporting director Ralf Rangnick will step down from his current role to oversee the development of Red Bull-owned clubs in New York and Brazil, Leipzig announced on Tuesday.","At a press conference on Tuesday, Rangnick confirmed that he would be taking on the role of ""Head of Sport and Development Soccer"" at Red Bull. The role will see him focus on the development of MLS club New York Red Bulls and the company's Brazilian club, who recently merged with second tier outfit Bragantino. ""In the shower during the winter break, I began to think about what I would do after this season. I wanted a new challenge for myself, and I wanted what was best for RB Leipzig and for the other Red Bull clubs,"" said Rangnick. The 60-year-old will be replaced at Leipzig by Paderborn sporting director Markus Kroesche, the club confirmed on Tuesday. Rangnick has been sporting director at Leipzig since 2012, helping to guide the club from the fourth tier into the Champions League. He has also had two spells as Leipzig coach, overseeing the club's promotion to the Bundesliga in 2016 and their run to the German Cup final this year. Though he was always set to make way for Julian Nagelsmann in the Leipzig dugout ahead of next season, Rangnick had repeatedly denied rumours that he would also step down as sporting director. Rangnick will continue to live in Leipzig, and said he would ""happily give advice"" to both Kroesche and Nagelsmann in future. Rangnick has always been a key figure in Red Bull's football empire, having also served as Red Bull Salzburg sporting director between 2012 and 2015. Even since giving up the role, he has faced accusations of conflict of interest, with 23 players having moved from Salzburg to Leipzig since 2012. On Tuesday, he said that he would have nothing to do with Salzburg in his new role, but that they and Leipzig would be a model for his work in New York and Brazil. ""I want to do exactly what I did in Leipzig and Salzburg in 2012: assess the situation and see what we can do in terms of scouting, squad planning and coach development."" Rangnick said he hoped to take Bragantino into the Brazilian first division as quickly as possible, and open new youth academies in both countries."

Yet Bayern's cup victory appeared to end speculation over the Croatian's future, as home fans chanted his name before kick-off and after the final whistle. ""We never questioned whether he would be here next season, that was never a topic for us,"" Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told ARD after the game, echoing comments he had made at an event in Berlin the day before. ""At the end of the day, trophies are what is expected at Bayern."" Rummenigge, who was considered one of Kovac's strongest boardroom critics this season, said that it had been a ""curious"" season, but that the team had played ""amazingly"" on Saturday. The victory appears to be a final vindication for the under-fire coach, coming after the Bavarians won the Bundesliga title last Saturday, having clawed back a nine-point deficit from rivals Borussia Dortmund. ""I had to stay calm, I know how difficult the job is. Trophies are important,"" Kovac told ARD. He picked up a second trophy in a week on Saturday, as Bayern beat Leipzig 3-0 at the Berlin Olympic Stadium. Kovac addressed the fans directly with a loudspeaker after the game, thanking them for their support. ""I thanked the fans, without them, we would not have made it out of the hole we were in earlier in the season,"" he told ARD. Kovac is now the first coach to have won the German Cup in two successive seasons with two different clubs, having beaten Bayern with Eintracht Frankfurt in last year's final. ""Last year, I cried because I was leaving the club. This year it was a bit less emotional but the emotions are always there,"" he said."

Both Robben and Ribery came off the bench to make their final appearance in a Bayern shirt, and Lewandowski hailed the iconic duo after helping Bayern to victory with a goal either side of half time. ""These titles are for Franck and Arjen, they have done so much for the club and we have to thank them,"" the Polish striker told public broadcaster ARD. The win sees Bayern lift the golden German Cup trophy for the 19th time in their history, just a week after securing a seventh successive Bundesliga title last Saturday. ""It was a difficult season at times, but I think we can now say that in the end, it was a very good season,"" said Lewandowski. The campaign has been particularly tough for Bayern coach Niko Kovac, who has faced constant criticism both from inside and outside the club in his first year in charge. Yet the fans chanted Kovac's name before and after the final whistle as Bayern ended their season on a high. ""It will take a few days to sink in that it is now actually over, but it was good to go out with the double,"" Robben told ARD. Both sides probed rather frantically for an opener in the first half, and Manuel Neuer denied Yussuf Poulsen with a reflex save on ten minutes. It was Bayern who broke the deadlock, though, Lewandowski flicking in a superb header in the 29th minute after a fine move on the left from Coman and David Alaba. Coman had a free run at goal and rounded goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi shortly before half-time, but his shot was cleared on the line by Ibrahima Konate. Emil Forsberg had a similar chance for Leipzig just after the break, but came off second best in a one-on-one with Neuer. A breathless second half saw chance after chance fall at either end, until Coman's 77th minute strike put Bayern out of reach. The Frenchman found the top corner after elegantly bringing down a loose ball in the penalty area. He later came off for departing veteran Franck Ribery, who was making his final appearance for Bayern alongside fellow winger Arjen Robben. By that point it was already 3-0, as Lewandowski had broken free of the back line and lifted the ball over Gulacsi to secure victory five minutes from time."

""I want to throw myself into the task (of winning the cup), everything else, everything concerning my position, is secondary,"" he said on Friday. Just hours earlier on the other side of Berlin, Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said that Kovac's job did not depend on the outcome of the final. Kovac admitted that it had been an ""intense"" season, and said that winning the league title last weekend had lifted a weight off his shoulders. ""The season was long, and when you reach your goal you feel more comfortable and the tension drops. But we have had time to relax with our families and now we are focused on tomorrow,"" he said. Saturday will be a third return home in three years for native Berliner Kovac, who led former club Eintracht Frankfurt to back-to-back cup finals in 2017 and 2018, and delivered a shock victory over Bayern last year. ""Last year shows that there are no favourites in a cup final"" Kovac warned on Friday. ""Both teams will want to win and you need a little bit of luck."" The Bayern coach heaped praise on Leipzig, saying that they were the ""hardest opponent we could have got in the final"". He said that he would have to pick his best team for Saturday's game, suggesting that departing veterans Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery would start on the bench in their final game for Bayern. ""It will be their last game so it is a difficult decision to make,"" he said, hinting that the likes of Serge Gnabry and Kingsley Coman would be in the starting line-up. ""I know what it means to end your playing career, but we also have players who have played really well since January."" Leipzig coach Ralf Rangnick, meanwhile, said that it did not matter to his team whether Robben and Ribery began the game or not. ""If they come off the bench, we will have to play well, just as we will do from the beginning."" Leipzig are targeting a first major trophy of their ten-year history, and Rangnick said his side hoped to use the final as a springboard to challenge Bayern for further domestic titles in future. ""We have always been knocked out early in the cup before, so we are happy to get this far,"" he said. ""Bayern remain the benchmark for everyone, but we hope to narrow the gap, that is our ambition."" ""We need to keep making clever signings. If we had had one or two players more at times this year, we might even have been in the title race."" Leipzig finished third in the Bundesliga, 12 points behind champions Bayern. After a narrow 1-0 defeat to the Bavarians in December, they managed to postpone Bayern's title celebrations with a 0-0 draw in Leipzig two weeks ago. ""We only conceded one goal against them this season, but we also didn't score any,"" said Rangnick. ""If we are going to beat them on Saturday, we will need to score at least one, maybe even two or three goals."""
95,24/05/2019,17:10,Neuer to make cup final return for Bayern,"Bayern Munich's goalkeeper and captain Manuel Neuer will play in this weekend's German Cup final against RB Leipzig, coach Niko Kovac revealed on Friday.","Neuer, 33, has been out injured since mid-April after sustaining a calf injury in a Bundesliga game against Fortuna Duesseldorf. The Bayern number one had hoped to return to the first team two weeks ago, but was still out of action when Bayern wrapped up the league title in Munich last weekend. Kovac, though, said on Friday that his captain would be back on the pitch at the Berlin Olympic Stadium on Saturday evening. ""Manuel will play tomorrow, because he is our captain and has played well this season,"" said the Bayern coach. Neuer said that the cup final in Berlin was always ""something special"". ""The coach knows that I have missed the last few weeks, but we have played some matches in training so I am well prepared."" Kovac also revealed that midfielder Leon Goretzka would not be fit for the final against Leipzig. Neuer, who missed last year's final due to injury, said he could sympathise with Goretzka. ""It is an emotional game tomorrow. I feel for Leon, because he is injured and will miss his first ever cup final,"" said the Bayern keeper."
96,17/05/2019,16:12,'A lot of unrest' - Leipzig coach Rangnick hoping Bayern lose title,RB Leipzig coach Ralf Rangnick has said that his team will benefit if Bayern Munich surrender the Bundesliga title to Borussia Dortmund on Saturday.,"Bayern go into the final round of games two points ahead of Dortmund, and hope to wrap up a seventh straight title before they face Leipzig in the German Cup final in Berlin next weekend. ""If Bayern were to lose out on the title from the good position they are in, then it would lead to a lot of unrest,"" Rangnick told AFP subsidiary SID on Friday. ""In terms of preparation for the cup final, that certainly wouldn't be an advantage for them."" Bayern will be crowned champions unless they lose at home to Frankfurt and Dortmund beat Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday. Leipzig, meanwhile, hope to ruin Bayern's domestic double hopes and secure the first major trophy of their 10-year history in Berlin on May 25."
97,11/05/2019,18:02,Dortmund take title race to wire as Bayern held,Bayern Munich missed the chance to wrap up a seventh successive Bundesliga title as they were held to a goalless draw at RB Leipzig on Saturday and rivals Borussia Dortmund edged a nervy 3-2 win over Fortuna Duesseldorf.,"Chelsea-bound US international Christian Pulisic found the net in his final home game for Dortmund, helping them to battle back to within two points of league leaders Bayern ahead of the final round of games next weekend. Bayern can now secure the title with a win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt next Saturday, while Dortmund must win at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Dortmund, who looked dead and buried after slipping four points behind last week, enjoyed the rub of the green as they stumbled to victory over Duesseldorf. Pulisic, who will join Chelsea next season, bid an emotional farewell to the Dortmund fans before the game and then opened the scoring on 41 minutes. A howler from stand-in goalkeeper Marwin Hitz allowed Oliver Fink to equalise, but Thomas Delaney restored the lead for Dortmund. Hitz then gave away a penalty with a foul on Dodi Lukebakio, but the Belgian dragged the ball wide from 12 yards. Mario Goetze appeared to seal the win for Dortmund on 90 minutes, but Dawid Kownacki pulled one back for Duesseldorf minutes later to make it a nerve-jangling finish for the hosts. In Leipzig, Leon Goretzka's stylish scissor-kick sent Bayern into ecstasy after half-time, but the goal was ruled out by VAR. Serge Gnabry hit the bar later in the second half, but Bayern could not force the winner. At the other end of the table, Nuremberg and Hanover were finally relegated as Stuttgart secured the relegation play-off place with a 3-0 win over Wolfsburg. Hanover went down fighting as goals from Waldemar Anton, Ihlas Bebou and Walace saw them beat Freiburg 3-0. Yet Anastasios Donis, Gonzalo Castro and Daniel Didavi were on the mark for Stuttgart to condemn Hanover and Nuremberg to the drop. Nuremberg, meanwhile, suffered a 4-0 defeat to Borussia Moenchengladbach thanks to an own-goal from Lukas Muehl and strikes from Thorgan Hazard, Denis Zakaria and former Nuremberg man Josip Drmic. The thumping win sees Gladbach go fourth overnight, leapfrogging both Eintracht Frankfurt and Bayer Leverkusen, who were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Schalke, Guido Burgstaller cancelling out Kai Havertz's opener. Frankfurt have the chance to break back into the top four with a win over Mainz on Sunday. Werder Bremen also kept their European hopes alive with a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim, and Hertha Berlin snatched a late 4-3 victory away to Augsburg. Johannes Eggestein's first-half goal condemned RB Leipzig-bound coach Julian Nagelsmann to defeat in his last home game in charge of Hoffenheim. Andre Hahn and Michael Gregoritsch put Augsburg ahead three times but goals from Marvin Plattenhardt and Marko Grujic kept Hertha in the game before a late brace from Salomon Kalou secured three points."
98,07/05/2019,12:12,Bayern target Werner could leave Leipzig in 2020 - Rangnick,RB Leipzig coach Ralf Rangnick has hinted that star striker Timo Werner may yet stay at the club for another year before joining Bayern Munich on a free transfer.,"Werner, 23, has scored 19 goals this season as Leipzig have secured a top four spot and reached the German Cup final. His excellent form has seen him linked with a move to Bayern, whom Leipzig face both in the Bundesliga this weekend and in the cup final later this month. With Werner's current contract set to expire in 2020, Rangnick and Leipzig had previously ruled out allowing the striker to leave on a free transfer at the end of next season. Yet at an event organised by LVZ newspaper on Monday, Rangnick admitted that the wantaway striker may yet stay on for another season under new boss Julian Nagelsmann. ""I can't rule out Timo staying until 2020,"" said the Leipzig coach. ""We will see in the summer whether he moves away or if he stays to fire us into the Champions League again."" Rangnick said he would like Werner to stay, but also felt Leipzig deserved not to lose the player on a free transfer. He also confirmed that he was already looking for a new number nine in case Werner were to join Bayern at the end of this season. ""If he does leave, then we need a replacement who can guarantee us 15 to 20 goals a season,"" he said."
99,30/10/2018,13:31,RB Leipzig set to be without Forsberg until mid November,RB Leipzig expect to be without Emil Forsberg until the middle of next month as their Swedish playmaker struggles to overcome a groin injury.,"""I assume he will be available at the latest after the next international break,"" said Leipzig coach Ralf Rangnick, whose team is fifth in the German league table. ""The medical department is working at full speed."" The international break ends November 20. Forsberg, who has scored three goals and set up three more in 12 club games this season, suffered the injury in Sweden's goalless draw against Russia nearly three weeks ago and has not played since. He will miss Wednesday's German Cup, second round match at home to Hoffenheim and Saturday's Bundesliga derby at sixth-placed Hertha Berlin. Forsberg is also doubtful for the return Europa League game at Celtic on November 8, after Leipzig won the first leg 2-0, as well as the Bundesliga clash at home to Bayer Leverkusen three days later. Rangnick added: ""We strive to ensure that he will be fit."" Forsberg set the record for the most assists in a single Bundesliga season, setting up 22 goals and scoring a further eight more in 2016/17. It bettered Kevin de Bruyne's previous record of 21 assists, set in 2014/15 for Wolfsburg before he joined Manchester City."
100,07/10/2018,20:45,Leipzig hit six to go second in Bundesliga,"RB Leipzig put their early season stumbles behind them on Sunday, walloping 10-man Nuremberg 6-0 to go second in the Bundesliga ahead of the international break.","It could have been even worse for the visitors, with Nuremberg keeper Fabian Bredlow saving a 63rd-minute penalty from Timo Werner after Tim Leibold was red carded for a challenge in the box. Leipzig wasted no time in getting on the scoreboard, with Kevin Kampl scoring in the third minute. Danish forward Yussuf Poulsen doubled the advantage just four minutes later, before Marcel Sabitzer added another in the 21st minute. Werner took advantage of a lucky rebound in the 31st minute, burying the ball in the bottom right corner to bring up his 50th Bundesliga goal and a scoreline of 4-0. Sabitzer (55th minute) and Werner (59th minute) added one more each in the second half, before Leipzig took their foot off the accelerator in the final 30 minutes. Leipzig are three points behind Borussia Dortmund who defeated Augsburg 4-3 on Saturday while champions Bayern Munich ended the weekend in sixth place after a 3-0 home loss to Moenchengladbach. It continues a rollercoaster run of results for the promoted Nuremberg. In the past three match days, comprehensive victories over Hanover (2-0) and Dusseldorf (3-0) bookended a 7-0 defeat away at Dortmund. Ante Rebic scored for the third Bundesliga game in a row but was also sent off as Eintracht Frankfurt capped a successful week with a 2-1 win at Hoffenheim. The visitors were made to work for their victory at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena after being reduced to 10 men in the 62nd minute when Croatia forward Rebic received his second yellow card of the game. Paris Saint-Germain loanee Kevin Trapp preserved Frankfurt's victory in the 93rd minute with a stunning one-handed reflex save, denying Hoffenheim after Ishak Belfodil's last-gasp header looked set to snatch them a point. Hoffenheim dominated an exhausted Frankfurt in the dying stages, with on-loan Arsenal teenager Reiss Nelson scoring his second goal in three appearances to trim the deficit in the 82nd minute. Frankfurt's opening goal came against the run of play in a first half dominated by the home side. Hoffenheim had several clear-cut chances but could only hit the woodwork. From a wayward throw in, Luka Jovic's long pass up the left hand side drew Hoffenheim keeper Oliver Baumann out of his box. Rebic noticed Baumann advancing and chipped it over the retreating keeper. Eintracht doubled their lead just 30 seconds after half-time, with Jovic taking advantage after Baumann failed to handle a low cross from Filip Kostic to hammer it home. In Sunday's opening game, Freiburg drew 0-0 at home to Bayer Leverkusen."
101,26/09/2018,22:49,Seven-up Dortmund keep heat on Bayern Munich,Teenager Achraf Hakimi scored on debut as Borussia Dortmund waltzed to a 7-0 win over Nuremberg on Wednesday to keep the heat on Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich.,"Real Madrid loanee Hakimi, 19, scored Dortmund's third goal as Lucien Favre's side obliterated Nuremberg to move to within two points of Bayern in second place. Jacob Bruun Larsen's stylish finish gave Dortmund the lead early on, the Danish striker latching onto Christian Pulisic's through ball and lofting the ball over Fabian Bredlow in the Nuremberg goal. With Dortmund in complete control, Marco Reus doubled the lead on 32 minutes, as his long range effort was deflected past a helpless Bredlow. Hakimi's moment came just after half-time, as he rounded off a Dortmund counter attack by blasting the ball into the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Reus added another a few minutes later, and Manuel Akanji picked up his first ever Bundesliga goal before substitutes Jadon Sancho and Julian Weigl completed the rout. ""We put pressure on them from the very first minute, did our job at the back and took our chances,"" Akanji told the official club TV channel. ""It was a great feeling to score my first goal for the club."" Borussia Moenchengladbach, meanwhile, are among those chasing Dortmund after they battled to a 3-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt to go fourth. Gladbach forced several saves from Kevin Trapp in the first half before Alassane Plea finally broke through in the 56th minute, the Frenchman rifling the ball in from a tight angle to grab his sixth goal in all competitions. Thorgan Hazard doubled the lead with a sweetly struck finish ten minutes later, and though Ante Rebic's goal gave Frankfurt a flicker of hope, it was extinguished by Nico Elvedi's 85th minute header. Elsewhere, RB Leipzig battled to a 2-0 win over Stuttgart, while Wolfsburg were held to a goalless draw in Mainz. Captain Willi Orban put Leipzig in front on the stroke of half-time, tapping in the rebound after Kevin Kampl had forced a save from Ron-Robert Zieler. Timo Werner had a goal ruled out by VAR in the second half before Jean Kevin Augustin whipped in Leipzig's second to seal the win. Wolfsburg failed to take advantage of a comedy of defensive errors from Mainz. Twice gifted possession in the first half, Josip Brekalo first struck the post on 23 minutes, and then fired the ball straight at Mainz goalkeeper Florian Mueller. Earlier, two goals from Kevin Volland saw Bayer Leverkusen continue their recovery with a 2-1 win at Fortuna Duesseldorf. After a breaking the deadlock with a tap-in after half-time, Volland nodded in Kai Havertz's elegant cross to double the lead, and Rouwen Hennings late penalty was not enough to prevent a second win in a row for Leverkusen."

""The boys (striker Augustin and midfielder Mukiele) will be back in the squad for training tomorrow and I hope they paid attention to this warning,"" said Rangnick after the draw in Frankfurt. ""The topic is now closed for us and we are looking forward to Wednesday's league game against VfB Stuttgart."" Hosts Frankfurt went ahead against Leipzig when Swiss midfielder Gelson Fernandes took advantage of disruption in the Leipzig defence to score the opening goal on 26 minutes with RB centre-back Wili Orban off the pitch. The burly Leipzig defender was being treated for injury on the sidelines when Fernandes fired home a rebound after a save from Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi. Germany striker Timo Werner then wasted a chance to equalise late in the first half, but the Leipzig forward mistimed his header and sent the ball over. After a determined start to the second half, Leipzig were rewarded when Forsberg equalised from the penalty spot on 54 minutes after his cross had been handled by Filip Kostic. The opportunities then came thick and fast for Leipzig as Forsberg fired wide from close range and Werner was unable to convert a late chance. Earlier, rising Germany star Kai Havertz ended Bayer Leverkusen's miserable losing start to the season with a second-half winner to seal a 1-0 victory over Mainz and escape the Bundesliga's bottom three. Havertz, 19, who made his Germany debut in the 2-1 friendly win against Peru earlier this month, claimed his first Bundesliga goal of the season with a powerful header midway through the first half. After losing their first three games of 2018/19, Leverkusen climbed up to 15th, leaving bottom side Schalke, who were beaten 2-0 at home by league leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday, as the only team in Germany's top flight to have lost all four games this season. However, Leverkusen made hard work of the win at their own BayArena. Only an intervention by the video assistant referee denied Mainz the opening goal just after the break when their Sweden striker Robin Quaison, who had just come on, headed the ball into the net, but replays showed the ball clipped his hand in the build-up. After the let off, Leverkusen took their chance to claim their first win of the season when Havertz headed home a cross from his Germany team-mate Julian Brandt on 62 minutes. Ridle Baku, 20, fired wide with a late chance for Mainz, who suffered their first defeat of the season to drop to seventh."

Danny Welbeck nodded in a second just after half-time and Aubameyang curled in the Gunners' third, with Mesut Ozil also on target before a lapse in concentration saw Vorskla hit back with two late goals. ""I think we played well in the first half and in the beginning of the second as well,"" Aubameyang told BT Sport. ""We have to improve and try to fight not to concede a goal like we did in the last minute."" Premier League leaders Chelsea made a winning start to their Group L campaign as Willian's seventh-minute effort was enough to see off PAOK at a hostile Toumba Stadium. Eden Hazard was omitted from the Chelsea squad at his own request due to fatigue, but manager Maurizio Sarri fielded a strong side as the Blues extended their winning run to six games in all competitions. ""We were in control of the match for 90 minutes. We had a lot of opportunities. We missed them and so I'm very happy with the three points, very happy with the performance, but not very happy with the result,"" said Sarri. ""When it's time to kill the match, we have to kill the match."" Steven Gerrard's Rangers acquitted themselves well on their first appearance in the group stage of a European competition since the 2010-11 Champions League, as they came away with a 2-2 draw against Villarreal. A disastrous start for the Glasgow side saw Carlos Bacca fire Villarreal ahead inside 60 seconds, but Scott Arfield turned home a cross from Daniel Candeias to level on 67 minutes. Gerard Moreno put the hosts back in front almost immediately, only for Kyle Lafferty to again hit back for Rangers as Gerrard's men made a solid start in Group G. Leigh Griffiths hit a late winner for Celtic in a 1-0 home victory over Rosenborg, a team Brendan Rodgers' side knocked out in this season's Champions League qualifying rounds. Salzburg triumphed in the clash of Red Bulls in the other Group B fixture as Fredrik Gulbrandsen scored a minute from time to give the Austrian club a 3-2 victory over RB Leipzig. Marseille, last season's runners-up, slumped to a 2-1 home defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt in Group H as Luka Jovic grabbed an 89th-minute winner for the reigning German Cup champions. Lucas Ocampos opened the scoring early for Marseille, who were playing behind closed doors at the Stade Velodrome after numerous crowd incidents last season. But Lucas Torro levelled on 52 minutes for Eintracht before Jovic's late strike won it. Dudelange, the first Luxembourg team to play in the Europa League group stage, made seven-time European champions AC Milan work hard for a 1-0 win in Group F. Luxembourg's Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa were in the crowd as Dudelange, who have a dozen non-professional players in their squad, succumbed to a deflected second-half goal by Gonzalo Higuain. Record five-time winners Sevilla launched their Group J campaign with a 5-1 rout of Standard Liege, as Ever Banega and Wissam Ben Yedder both netted twice for the Spaniards."
104,19/09/2018,18:29,"When two Red Bulls collide in Europa League, the sponsor wins","When two Red Bulls clash in the Europa League on Thursday, it will only be possible because their sponsor has tried to ensure that the two ""brothers"" are not quite as similar as they appear.","RB Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg wear the same colours. Their shirts carry the same sponsor and almost identical club badges, all showing the charging bulls logo of the Austrian energy-drink company. The two clubs symbolise the rising power of football franchising designed to enhance both squad and brand building. UEFA, the governing body of European football, introduced a rule to protect the ""integrity of European club competitions"" in 1998, after British holding company ENIC bought, or took stakes in, half a dozen clubs: Tottenham Hotspur, Slavia Prague, Glasgow Rangers, Vicenza, Basel and AEK Athens. Two clubs with the same owner cannot play in the same competition, yet on Thursday two Red Bulls collide. That is possible because, ""following a long investigation"" completed in June 2017, UEFA decided they did not share an owner. They accepted that Austrian drinks billionaire Dietrich Mateschitz had surrendered direct control of Salzburg, remaining only as the shirt and stadium sponsor. Yet Salzburg still appear to function as part of a supply chain which also includes the New York Red Bulls of the MLS and Red Bull Brasil, which plays in the Sao Paulo state league in Brazil Since the start of 2015, 12 players have gone from Salzburg directly to fast-rising RB Leipzig, who under German rules cannot officially be called ""Red Bull"", in the bigger Bundesliga. They include Naby Keita, who moved from Salzburg to Leipzig for 15 million Euros in 2016 and then to Liverpool for an estimated 75 million euros this summer. Red Bull are not alone. Professor Simon Chadwick of the University of Salford in England told AFP that there are ""between 15 and 20 entities"" who have embarked on a multi-club strategy. They range from AS Monaco, which has bought Cercle Brugge of Belgium, and the Italian Pozzo family which owns Udinese of Italy's Serie A and Premier League Watford and also owned Granada FC in Spain, to the global ambition of Red Bull or the City Football Group. The Abu Dhabi owned company largely avoids problems with UEFA by controlling clubs in different continents: Manchester City, New York City, Melbourne City and Club Atletico Torque in Uruguay, although it has stakes in Yokohama Marinos in Japan and Girona of La Liga. ""Purely in football terms, as football clubs, this is very much about building a talent acquisition network,"" Chadwick said. ""To win football matches, you need the best possible talents and to get the best possible talents, if you operate on a network basis you have more people in more places watching more games, scouting more players"" But Red Bull, which is also heavily involved in motor sports, ice hockey, extreme sports and sailing, and the City group have bigger aims. ""It's about brand visibility"" and ""trying to cultivate a new type of global fan"" who supports an entire network of clubs, Chadwick said. Commercially, whatever the final score when Leipzig play Salzburg, Red Bull will win."

""I think they underestimated us today,"" Zimmermann told Sky. ""We played brilliantly going forward, and created a lot of chances. Sadly, we lost two points in the end."" Leipzig made a nervy start to the game, and Marvin Ducksch squandered a gilt-edged opportunity to put Duesseldorf ahead after just six minutes. Half chances fell to Bruma and Timo Werner as the home side settled, but Fortuna remained dangerous swarming forward on the counter-attack. Augustin found the net for Leipzig just before half-time, bundling in the rebound after Emil Forsberg had stung the palms of Fortuna keeper Michael Rensing. The Frenchman, though, was ruled offside. Duesseldorf wasted no time after the break and took a deserved lead on 47 minutes, Zimmermann linking up with Niko Giesselmann to sweep the ball into the bottom corner. The home side responded with tenacity and were rewarded on 68 minutes, when Augustin picked up a loose ball in the box and prodded it past Rensing. Matheus Cunha came within inches of scoring a brilliant winner for Leipzig ten minutes from time, but his overhead kick bounced just the wrong side of the post, before Ducksch forced a flying save from Peter Gulacsi at the other end."

Dortmund scored four goals without replay in an impressive display to better Bayern Munich's 3-1 win over Hoffenheim on Friday on the opening weekend of the German league season. Dortmund fell behind at Signal Iduna Park when Leipzig attacked from the kick-off and Witsel's slip allowed France Under-21 striker Jean-Kevin Augustin to score in the opening minute. Despite the early setback, Dortmund dug deep under new head coach Lucien Favre and scored three goals in a dazzling first-half display. ""Leipzig were better than us, especially at the start, they were faster, better in the challenges. That was dangerous, because we did not defend well, but we reacted. ""We scored at the right moments, then the confidence came back, but there are many things to correct, many tactical things and a lot of details."" The hosts drew level on 21 minutes when Syria-born midfielder Mahmoud Dahoud powered home a header. Dortmund's new captain Marco Reus then provided the second goal when his free-kick on 40 minutes was headed into his own net by Leipzig's Marcel Sabitzer. Witsel, who joined in a 20-million-euro ($22.9 million) transfer from Chinese side Tianjin Quanjian, made amends for his early blunder by scoring Dortmund's stunning third goal. When fellow new signing Thomas Delaney forced Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi into a diving save, Witsel was on hand to athletically smash the ball into the net on 43 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Leipzig, who have now already played seven games this season including a goalless Europa League qualifier at Ukraine side Zorya Luhansk on Thursday, did not have the legs to fight their way back. ""It's a weird feeling for us,"" said Leipzig coach Ralf Rangnick. ""If you look at the scoreboard at half-time - I can't remember having seen such a distorted game in the last few years. ""We lost the game from set-pieces and balls into the box, because of this, we weren't rewarded for the massive effort we put in. ""The team looked fresh and were up for it, so I'm not worried at all."" Reus sealed the convincing win when Dortmund's 18-year-old junior England international Jandon Sancho came off the bench and provided the final pass for the Borussia skipper to roll into the net on 90 minutes. ""We showed spirit and character, but had a bit of luck, too,"" said Reus. ""The win is incredibly important and gives us confidence."" Earlier, Anthony Ujah came off the bench to score Mainz's late winner in a 1-0 victory over Stuttgart. Nigeria striker Ujah, 27, was sent on in the 66th minute and grabbed the winner ten minutes later after a mistake by Stuttgart's ex-Germany defender Holger Badstuber."

But Leipzig's Scandinavian stars turned the game as Danish forward Poulsen equalised on 60 minutes before Swedish playmaker Forsberg scored the go ahead goal with 21 minutes to go. Leipzig's substitute left-back Marcelo Saracchi was sent off 23 minutes from time for a last man foul, but French striker Jean-Kevin Augustin sealed the win by netting the visitors' third goal in added time. ""We definitely didn't bring our 'A' game in the first half. After the break, we played with a lot more pace,"" admitted goal-scorer Forsberg. ""All in all, it was a tough game. ""Viktoria fought well and didn't make it easy for us."" Leipzig's laboured display was understandable given their horrendous fixture list over the last three weeks. This was their fifth competitive match of the young after two rounds of home-and-away Europa League qualifiers. They have another European tie against Ukraine's Sorja Luhansk on Thursday before their opening Bundesliga game of the season at Borussia Dortmund on Sunday. In other first-round cup fixtures, second division Cologne ran riot in the capital as they hammered fourth tier team Dynamo Berlin 9-1 with striker Simon Terodde scoring four goals at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. On Saturday, holders Eintracht Frankfurt, who beat Bayern 3-1 in last season's final, crashed out in the first round with a 2-1 defeat at fourth-division Ulm. And mighty Bayern Munich needed a late Robert Lewandowski goal to secure a 1-0 German Cup win at Drochtersen/Assel, a fourth division village side who had a car salesman, tax advisor and stonemason in their team."
108,15/08/2018,18:00,Schalke reportedly join Leipzig in race to sign Germany star Rudy,"Schalke 04 are reportedly the latest big-name Bundesliga club chasing Bayern Munich midfielder Sebastian Rudy, who has also been linked to RB Leipzig.","Domenico Tedesco, Schalke's head coach, was photographed leading a three-man delegation from last season's German league runners-up through Munich airport on Tuesday, but refused to confirm reports of a meeting with Rudy. ""We were not in Munich for the sake of pleasure... Everything else is speculation, and I won't participate in that,"" Tedesco replied to questions about Rudy, a defensive midfielder. After agreeing to sell Germany Under-21 centre-back Thilo Kehrer for a reported 37 million euros ($42.3 million) to Paris Saint-Germain last week, Schalke can certainly afford Rudy, who has a market value of around 15 million euros. The 28-year-old moved in 2017 on a free transfer from Hoffenheim to Bayern, where he is under contract until 2020, but he was not used in key games last season. Rudy has made 26 appearances for Germany but played just 31 minutes at the World Cup, suffering a broken nose in the last-gasp 2-1 win over Sweden, as the Germans crashed out in the group stage. Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has already said the club has too many midfielders and Arturo Vidal has since been sold to Barcelona. RB Leipzig's director of sport Ralf Rangnick on Wednesday described reports they have already signed Rudy as ""the mother of all fake news"", but did not rule out a future deal. ""According to how things currently stand, Sebastian Rudy will not move to RB Leipzig, but I do not know yet how things will look in a week or two,"" added Rangnick. Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann, who will take over at RB Leipzig for the 2019/20 season, says Rudy would slot into the vacancy left by Naby Keita, who has joined Liverpool. Rudy has a reputation for being a midfield organiser rather than an eye-catching match-winner. ""He is not a player who clearly stands out, but someone who brings a good structure into the game,"" said Nagelsmann. Bayern, who have won the Bundesliga each of the last six seasons, open the new campaign at home to Hoffenheim on August 24. Schalke kick off their 2018/19 campaign a day later at Wolfsburg while RB Leipzig travel to Borussia Dortmund on August 26."
109,09/07/2018,14:32,Rangnick returns as RB Leipzig coach for next season,"Former coach Ralf Rangnick will take charge of RB Leipzig again this season on a one-year deal, the Bundesliga club announced on Monday.","Leipzig parted ways with Ralph Hasenhuettl after a disappointing 2017/18 season which saw them finishing sixth in the German top flight and miss out on Champions League qualification. The 60-year-old Rangnick was previously coach of the club as they made their way through the divisions between 2012 and 2016, before retiring and becoming sporting director. But with Julian Nagelsmann due to join in July 2019, from Hoffenheim, Rangnick has stepped in as a stop-gap. Rangnick said that Leipzig -- who finished second to Bayern Munich two seasons ago in their debut Bundesliga campaign -- were hoping to bring Everton forward Ademola Lookman to Germany permanently after a successful loan spell. ""We're still in talks over Ademola Lookman -- we want him back and he wants to come,"" he said."

Marsch has the Red Bulls off to a strong start to the MLS campaign, with 10 wins and two drawn from 16 matches. They rank second to Atlanta United in the Eastern Conference but with three fewer matches played. ""We are fully supportive of Jesse and his decision to pursue a new opportunity,"" Red Bulls sporting director Denis Hamlett said. ""Jesse played a large role in establishing our club identity."" Marsch, 44, went 58-35 with 25 drawn in 3 1/2 MLS seasons coaching New York. Armas, a 45-year-old New York native, played 66 matches for the US national squad. The former midfielder spent his first two MLS seasons with the Los Angeles Galaxy then played the final decade of his career with the Chicago Fire. Armas spent four years as an assistant coach for the Fire before joining the Red Bulls' staff in 2015. We are confident in Chris Armas,"" Hamlett said. ""We know Chris and the coaching staff will have our team ready to compete each week and they will continue to find ways to improve and work towards our ultimate goal of winning MLS Cup."" Armas will guide the Red Bulls, who have only one loss in their past 10 matches, for the first time on Sunday when they visit arch-rival New York City FC, which sits only one point behind them in the table."
111,21/06/2018,19:32,'Honesty' best policy: Nagelsmann to join Leipzig at end of next season,Highly-regarded coach Julian Nagelsmann said Thursday that he will quit Hoffenheim to take charge at Bundesliga rivals Leipzig -- but only after the end of next season.,"Nagelsmann, just 30 years old, became coach at Hoffenheim in 2016 and guided them to third place in the table last season. On Thursday, he penned a deal with Leipzig which will run until 2023. ""It was important for me to have an early clear attitude,"" said Nagelsmann. ""In this industry, we always demand honesty, which is what we have proved and I expect others to respect that, too."" Sixth in the Bundesliga last season, Leipzig are without a coach for the 2018/2019 campaign after the departure of Ralph Hasenhüttl."
112,14/03/2018,15:54,Leipzig want to delay Bayern title party,French striker Jean-Kevin Augustin says hosts RB Leipzig are determined to prevent Bayern Munich being confirmed as Bundesliga champions for the sixth straight year as early as this Sunday.,"Bayern, who play Besiktas away in the Champions League on Wednesday, will arrive at Leipzig's Red Bull Arena on Sunday with a 20-point lead in the Bundesliga table with eight league games left. Given their clear advantage, it is just a matter of time before Bayern are again crowned league champions. Mathematically, it could all be over by Sunday night. Bayern can equal their own Bundesliga record, set in 2013/14, of winning the title with seven league games in hand if they beat Leipzig and both of their nearest rivals, Schalke and Borussia Dortmund, draw or lose. Leipzig, currently sixth in Germany's top flight, finished second to Bayern last season and are eager to spoil their high-profile rivals' potential party plans. ""Bayern are an exceptional club, also at international level, but we aren't afraid of them,"" Augustin told magazine Sports Bild. ""We want to pick up points against Bayern and prevent them being champions in our stadium."" Bayern have made a habit of wrapping up the league title early in recent seasons. When they won the 2012/13 treble under Jupp Heynckes, the Bundesliga was secured with six games left. Heynckes' predecessor Pep Guardiola set the current record of winning with seven games to spare the following season when Bayern won 3-1 at Hertha Berlin on March 23, 2014. Last season, under Carlo Ancelotti, Bayern won the title with three games left. Leipzig are hoping to claim Bayern's valuable scalp on Sunday. RB broke a three-match losing streak in the league when Augustin scored in their 1-1 draw at home to Dortmund a fortnight ago. Augustin, 20, cost Leipzig 16 million euros ($19.7m) when he arrived from Paris Saint-Germain last July and has scored three goals in his last four league games. Leipzig are winless in their last four league games and desperate to beat Bayern to boost their hopes of a Champions League place next season. ""It's going to be a big game,"" said Augustin. ""We need to counter-attack well and finish off our chances in a good performance."""
113,11/03/2018,21:39,Germany forward Werner commits future to RB Leipzig,"Germany international striker Timo Werner said Sunday he will remain with RB Leipzig next season, quashing rumours of a move away from last year's Bundesliga runners-up.","""I have a contract until 2020 and I feel good at Leipzig,"" Werner said after Sunday's 0-0 draw against his former club Stuttgart. ""I will stay here next season whatever the case,"" the 22-year-old added when asked if he would see out his contract with the club. Werner has repeatedly found himself the subject of transfer speculation, with Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Chelsea all touted as potential suitors. He was the leading German scorer with 21 goals in the Bundesliga last season, and has netted 10 times this term despite not scoring in his last seven matches. Werner made his international debut against England last March and is expected to be a key player in Joachim Loew's squad at the World Cup in Russia."
114,09/03/2018,12:28,Russian clubs' blame European defeats on winter break,Three top Russian clubs blamed the protracted winter break on defeats in the Europa League on Thursday.,"CSKA Moscow, Zenit St Petersburg and Lokomotiv Moscow all said the three-month recess had hampered their preparations for the last 16 first leg ties. ""We've played only four matches after the winter break,"" Zenit's former Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic said after a 2-1 loss in Leipzig. ""It was hard to prepare for this match properly because it's very difficult to find a quality pitch to train on in Saint Petersburg at this time of the year. ""Now we need to forget this match and to focus on our match on Sunday at Rostov, which, I believe, will also be very difficult,"" he said. CSKA Moscow, beaten 1-0 at home by French side Lyon, also reproached the wintry weather and the poor condition of the pitch at their home venue for their lacklustre performance. ""It's not a good result for a home match,"" CSKA playmaker Alan Dzagoev told Russian TV after the match. ""Our venue's service staff did everythng they could to prepare the pitch for the match but it wasn't enough at such a (bad) weather. ""We've all failed to show our best today as it was very hard to perform creative and skilled football at the pitch of such (a low) quality."" Dzagoev also expressed hope that the pitch at Grozny, where CSKA will face Terek on Sunday, will be in much better condition. Russian league table-toppers Lokomotiv Moscow also blamed lack of match practice after the winter break and the absence of their Peruvian midfielder Jefferson Farfan and Brazilian forward Ari, who were both sidelined with injuries, for their 3-0 drubbing at Atletico Madrid. ""We've played against a very strong team that always perform at their top and never reserve their strength,"" managers Yury Semin told the club's website. ""We've made too many mistakes and paid the price for it. But we've played just a couple of games since the winter break. Besides, we played without two of our team's first-choice players."" Semin also said that Lokomotiv will need to focus on their match at Ural Yekaterinburg which he considered to be very important for his team, seeking their third domestic title ever and first since 2004. The railway-backed outfit have a seven-point lead at the top over second-placed Krasnodar, who tackle strugglers Dynamo Moscow on Saturday. Reigning champions Spartak, CSKA and Zenit St Petersburg are all one point further back."
115,23/02/2018,13:32,Arsenal paired with AC Milan in Europa League last 16,"Arsenal, the last surviving British club, on Friday drew seven-time European champion AC Milan in the last 16 of the Europa League.","Arsenal struggled to overcome Swedish minnows Ostersunds in the last round, being booed off by their fans at the Emirates after losing 2-1 on Thursday but going through 4-2 win on aggregate. Atletico Madrid and French striker Antoine Griezmann were paired with Lokomotiv Moscow, the day after another Spanish-Russian game, between Athletic Bilbao and Spartak Moscow, was marred by violence in which a Spanish policeman died of a heart attack. Bilbao will face 1993 European champions Marseille for the matches on March 8 and 15. Another French side, Lyon, must overcome CSKA Moscow to keep alive their hopes of appearing in the final which will be played at their own stadium on May 16. Lyon were comfortable 4-1 aggregate winners over Villarreal in the round of 32 and former club stalwart Bernard Lacombe welcomed the draw which sees the second leg played in France. ""We qualified well against Villarreal, who are a good club. Obviously it would be fantastic to play in our own stadium (in the final) but there are high-level opponents left in the competition and we have to respect that,"" he told beIN Sports. RB Leipzig, who dropped into the competition after being eliminated from the Champions League, will play Zenit Saint-Petersburg, who won the Europa League in 2008. Borussia Dortmund meanwhile face potentially the weakest team in the last 16, Czech side Plzen."
116,23/02/2018,02:10,Five things to look out for in the Bundesliga,"Bayern Munich coach Jupp Heynckes will be chasing a 38-year-old club record when his team host Hertha Berlin on Saturday, but will do so without the injured James Rodriguez.","Heynckes is looking to become the first Bayern coach to win 15 games in a row as his team look to consolidate a commanding 19-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Second-place Borussia Dortmund host Augsburg on Monday, with fans from both sides set to boycott the game. Elsewhere, Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time against Mainz on Friday, while RB Leipzig look set to host Cologne without star midfielder Naby Keita. Here are five things to look out for in this weekend's Bundesliga action: Jupp Heynckes has worked wonders since returning to Bayern Munich, and on Saturday he looks set to break an incredible club record. Heynckes, who has led Bayern to 23 victories in 24 games since October, could now become the first Bayern coach ever to win 15 games in a row. The 72-year-old watched his side romp to victory over Besiktas in midweek to pick up a 14th consecutive win, equalling a club record set under Pal Csernai back in 1980. Bayern are expected to be without James Rodriguez, who was forced to leave the pitch after 44 minutes against Besiktas with a calf problem. A diagnosis on Wednesday confirmed that the Colombian will be out of action for no more than a few days. More fan protests are expected this Monday when Borussia Dortmund take on Augsburg in the Bundesliga's second Monday night fixture. Last week's inaugural Monday game saw fierce protests from Eintracht Frankfurt fans, who blew whistles and held up banners in protest at the new scheduling. This Monday, both Dortmund and Augsburg fan groups are expected to continue protests. Around 300 Dortmund fan clubs have reportedly signed up to a boycott led by the influential fan group ""Suedtribuene Dortmund"". ""We accept every opinion and every protest, as long as it is carried out peacefully,"" said Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. RB Leipzig will be without star midfielder Naby Keita when they host Cologne on Sunday evening. The Guinean midfielder left the field after just an hour in Leipzig's defeat to Frankfurt on Monday, having pulled his hamstring. Captain Willi Orban is also a doubt after suffering a cut to his knee in a collision with Frankfurt's Sebastien Haller on Monday. Coach Ralph Hasenhuettl, though, claimed that the injuries were not a disaster for his team, as Leipzig look to muscle their way back into the top four this weekend. ""We have enough quality to replace both of them,"" insisted Hasenhuettl. Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time on Friday evening, as the Wolves travel to Mainz for a crucial bottom of the table clash. Labbadia took charge of the struggling Wolves after Martin Schmidt's sudden resignation earlier this week, and is now tasked with leading the club back to safety. ""We have to use every hour available to us,"" said Labbadia. ""I will demand of my players that they invest everything into this fight."" Relegation threatened Hamburg find themselves in last chance saloon ahead of Saturday's visit to arch rivals Werder Bremen. Hamburg have not won in 10 games, and are now six points from safety as they prepare for a must-win game over fellow strugglers Bremen. ""The derby is coming just at the right time,"" said Hamburg's Aaron Hunt. ""It is a great chance for us to turn things around.""

117,22/02/2018,23:41,Arsenal survive Ostersunds scare as policeman dies in Bilbao clashes,"Arsenal scraped into the last 16 of the Europa League despite a 2-1 second-leg defeat by Ostersunds, but Thursday's action was marred by violent clashes at the match between between Athletic Bilbao and Spartak Moscow which left a police officer dead.","Two quickfire first-half goals gave Swedish minnows Ostersunds hope of a sensational comeback at the Emirates, but Sead Kolasinac's goal just after the interval saw Arsenal hang on for a 4-2 win on aggregate. The north London giants move into Friday's last-16 draw, but Ostersunds will take all the plaudits for a brave display full of quality. ""At 2-0 we thought we had a chance. We played well, won the game but it was just short of the miracle,"" Ostersunds coach Graham Potter told BT Sport. A Basque police officer died as security forces clashed with fans of Russian club Spartak Moscow in Bilbao. ""We can confirm that a Basque policeman died Thursday,"" said a press spokesman for Ertzaintza, the Basque police region. However, he would not comment on reports that the officer died as a result of the violence. ""Five people have been arrested. We do not know if they are all supporters of Spartak, but many of them are Russians."" More than 500 police officers had been deployed for the high-risk return leg of the tie, which Bilbao won 4-3 on aggregate despite a 2-1 loss on the night. Having cruised to a 3-0 victory in the first leg last week, Arsene Wenger's Arsenal appeared complacent and were caught out by the vibrant visitors to the Emirates. Midfielder Hosam Aiesh capped off a slick move for the underdogs to pull one back in the 22nd minute, running onto Saman Ghoddos' through ball and slotting into the corner with the aid of a deflection off Calum Chambers. The hapless Arsenal centre-back was caught out just 69 seconds later as the home fans were left stunned, with winger Ken Sema spinning Chambers and drilling a low finish past Gunners goalkeeper David Ospina. Potter may have been thinking back to his side's missed injury-time penalty in the first-leg 3-0 loss, but they continued to press as Arsenal laboured. The Premier League side made it to half-time with a 3-2 aggregate lead intact, but were booed off the field by their own supporters. Unsurprisingly, Wenger's men were much-improved after the break and left-back Kolasinac capitalised on uncertainty in the Ostersunds defence to hammer home with his weaker right foot. But instead of building on that goal, Arsenal continued to be largely outplayed by their unheralded opposition, with Ghoddos and Curtis Edwards both going close to restoring the two-goal cushion. The Swedes ran out of legs as their continental adventure came to an end with a famous victory, but Arsenal were left facing plenty of questions ahead of Sunday's League Cup final against Manchester City. ""We were nowhere near it and not good enough,"" said Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere. ""We are through and that is all that counts. We will see who we get tomorrow and refocus on the big game on Sunday."" Marcel Schmelzer's late equaliser saw Borussia Dortmund grab a 1-1 draw at Atalanta to edge into the next round. Michy Batshuayi's double had brought Dortmund back from 2-1 down to win last week's home game 3-2, and Schmelzer struck seven minutes from time on Thursday to keep the German side in Europe. Belgian striker Batshuayi accused Atalanta fans of racist abuse after the game, writing on Twitter: ""2018 and still racists monkey noises in the stands... really? hope you have fun watching the rest of @EuropaLeague on TV while we are through... #SayNoToRacism. #GoWatchBlackPanther."" Serie A leaders Napoli gave RB Leipzig a serious fright in Germany, but a 2-0 win was in vain as last week's 3-1 loss proved too much to come back from. Leipzig held on to continue their debut European campaign with Napoli left to focus on defending their one-point lead over Juventus in Italy."
118,21/02/2018,23:50,Butt seriously: Chain-smoker Sarri given room to light up in Leipzig,Chain-smoking Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri expressed his gratitude to RB Leipzig bosses for building a room where he can puff away on Thursday as his team attempt to overturn a 3-1 deficit in their Europa League tie.,"Serie A leaders Napoli -- dropped into the second-tier European competition after their Champions League exit -- slumped to a shock home defeat in their last 32, first leg and play the away fixture in Germany on Thursday. Sarri was relieved to hear that the Bundesliga club have built a specially-adapted area and switched off smoke detectors to allow him to puff away undisturbed in the dressing room. ""We always ask for a different room for the staff, seeing as there wasn't one. If you can smoke I'm very grateful as well as other staff members,"" Sarri told a press conference ahead of the game in the Red Bull Arena. There is normally a strict no-smoking rule in the dressing rooms of the Red Bull Arena but an exception was made for 59-year-old Sarri who practically chews cigarettes when under pressure. ""Sarri is a passionate smoker, that's really incredible. I have never seen anyone who smokes so much. Thank God he has to hold back during games!"" Napoli captain Marek Hamsik said recently. Leipzig staff decided to erect a three-metre wide and three-and-a-half-metre high concrete barrier in which the Tuscan coach can safely smoke. For safety, fire alarms in the hall have also been disabled. Ironically RB Leipzig suspended two of its young players Idrissa Toure and Vitaly Janelt last year after they were caught smoking a shisha pipe in a hotel while on duty with the Germany Under-19 national team. Meanwhile, Sarri dismissed claims that his side were not taking the Europa League seriously, although he conceded they played ""like clowns"" in the first leg. ""We played like clowns, 70 percent of responsibility is mine, the rest the staff and players, tomorrow (Thursday) we want the desire to take revenge,"" said Sarri, who had fielded a second-string side. Sarri conceded Napoli's fans were more interested in winning a first Serie A title since 1990 as the home crowd stayed away in droves from the Leipzig game. ""The fans are interested in the championship now, and we will do everything to make them happy but this should not undermine the mentality of the team. ""Last Thursday's performance was a bolt from the blue for me as well. We have to drag the fans with the performance, but those who live in Naples know that. ""It's obvious Leipzig are over-riding favourites. We don't play differently at home or away, but we need to make up for the first leg and have a little bit of madness to think we can qualify."""
119,08/02/2018,19:44,RB Leipzig owe Red Bull 82 million euros,"The amount Bundesliga club RB Leipzig owe their backers Red Bull has leapt to 83.164 million euros ($101.9m), according to a government-backed magazine.","The Bundesanzeiger, published by Germany's department of Justice, say the club added 30 million euros to the 52.384m they owed the Austrian energy drinks giants at the end of 2015. The jump can be explained by Leipzig splashing out for Liverpool-bound Naby Keita, Oliver Burke and Timo Werner, plus head coach Ralph Hasenhuettl, just before last season. Keita, who will move to Anfield next season for around 75 million euros, was signed from sister club Red Bull Salzburg for 15 million euros in July 2016. Scotland winger Burke, now at West Bromwich Albion, also cost 15.2m euros from Nottingham Forest in August 2016. Werner, now a regular in the Germany team, made his breakthrough after joining from Stuttgart for 10 million euros in July 2016. Overall, RB Leipzig has a total debt of 97 million euros while salaries increased last year from 34 to almost 54 million euros. However, a club spokesman said they are unconcerned by the leap in their debt. ""The loans stands against player assets with significantly higher market values, which the Keita transfer impressively shows,"" an RB spokesman told SID, an AFP subsidiary. RB Leipzig, currently third in Germany's top flight, are again on course for a Champions League spot even if they do trail runaway league leaders Bayern Munich by 18 points. The club has only been around since 2009 when Red Bull acquired the German Football League (DFL) licence of a now-obsolete fifth-tier club. Four promotions in seven years meant RB Leipzig joined Germany's top flight for 2016/17 and finished second, qualifying for the Champions League, last season. Having finished third in the group stages of the Champions League this term, Leipzig dropped to the Europa League and host Napoli in the last 32 next Thursday."
120,05/02/2018,12:11,Five things we learned from the Bundesliga weekend,"Michy Batshuayi made a blistering start to life at Borussia Dortmund on Friday, firing the team back into the top four with two goals on his debut.","The Belgian wasn't the only debutant to make an impact, as 20-year-old English forward Ademola Lookman grabbed a late winner in his first game for RB Leipzig. The goal saw Leipzig move up to third in the Bundesliga, drawing level on points with second-place Bayer Leverkusen. Both Leverkusen and Leipzig are now 18 points behind leaders Bayern Munich, whose victory over Mainz on Saturday was overshadowed by speculation over coach Jupp Heynckes' future. Here are five things we learned from this weekend's Bundesliga action. Who needs Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang when you have Michy Batshuayi? Just three days after joining Dortmund on a six-month loan deal, Batshuayi enjoyed an explosive debut, grabbing two goals and an assist to inspire his new team to a 3-2 victory in Cologne. ""The way the game went for him today was like a dream,"" said coach Peter Stoeger of his new striker. Batshuayi, meanwhile, is already dreaming of big goals for his six-month sojourn in Westphalia. ""I want to get into the Champions League with Dortmund,"" he said. ""I want to win every single game."" Bayern Munich's dominance of the Bundesliga continued at the weekend, but there was more attention paid to Jupp Heynckes' future. The 72-year-old's contract runs until June, and he has repeatedly refused to talk about extending it. ""I can imagine that readers, viewers and listeners are bored of this topic,"" he said on Friday. Since coming out of retirement to take over at Bayern in the autumn, Heynckes has led the team to 14 victories in 15 Bundesliga games, so it is little wonder that the club would like him to stay beyond the end of the season. ""If I stood naked in front of him, I might have a small chance of persuading him to stay,"" joked club president Uli Hoeness earlier in the week. Everton loanee Ademola Lookman grabbed the headlines on Saturday, scoring 12 minutes into his RB Leipzig debut to secure a late victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach. The 20-year-old Englishman might, however, want to invest in a pair of new boots. ""He was lucky that I didn't take him off again straight away,"" admitted Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""He was just sliding around in the boots he was wearing. They were the only pair he had brought with him from England, and he didn't want to take them off."" Both goalkeepers were left blushing in Gelsenkirchen as Werder Bremen snatched a late 2-1 win over Schalke. Bremen 'keeper Jiri Pavlenka allowed Yevhen Konoplyanka's shot to slip through his fingers in the first half. His error was overshadowed by the woes of opposite number Ralf Faehrmann, however -- he first fumbled a free-kick to gift Bremen an equaliser, before being nutmegged by Zlatko Junuzovic's late winner. ""Ralf said sorry in the dressing room, and I told him he had nothing to apologise for,"" said Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco. Michael Gregoritsch will have enjoyed watching the Super Bowl on Sunday, having secured three points for Augsburg just hours earlier. The Austrian scored Augsburg's second in a 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt, and celebrated by miming a quarterback's throw. ""I will definitely be watching the Super Bowl later,"" admitted Gregoritsch after the game. ""My four best friends are coming over; I never sleep after a game anyway."""
121,31/01/2018,15:11,Agent fee scuppers Leipzig's Embalo bid,"RB Leipzig's attempt to sign 16-year-old Portuguese talent Umaro Embalo from Benfica collapsed at the last minute because the Germans baulked at paying his agent, according to media reports on Wednesday.","The teenage winger arrived in Leipzig last Sunday to undergo a medical and sign a deal, while Benfica's president had already flown to Germany for talks with the Bundesliga club. The transfer window closes in Germany on Wednesday at 1800 (1700 GMT), but the deal fell through when Leipzig's CEO Oliver Mintzlaff reportedly refused to pay a fee to Embalo's agent. Leipzig were close to paying 15 million euros ($18.7m) for the Portugal Under-17 forward, who has also attracted interest from Barcelona and Manchester United."
122,18/01/2018,12:04,RB Leipzig set to sign teenager Embalo - report,"Bundesliga side RB Leipzig are reportedly close to signing rising star Umaro Embalo, 16, from Portuguese side Benfica.","Embalo has played for Benfica's youth teams since 2015 and is the captain of Portugal's Under-17 team. The right winger has reportedly also been monitored by Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United, but the German league club are said to be the front-runners in the bid to sign him. The teenager has yet to play for Benfica's senior side, but has played five games in UEFA's Youth League. German daily Bild confirmed Thursday that, after RB's director of sport Ralf Rangnick jetted to Lisbon last week, Benfica president Luis Filipe Vieira flew to Leipzig by private jet for more talks on Wednesday. Embalo should cost around 15 million euros ($18.3m), plus extras based on future performances. Meanwhile, according to Danish broadcaster TV3, RB Leipzig are also close to signing Mads Bidstrup, 16, from FC Copenhagen, a midfielder who Rangnick has previously expressed an interest in."
123,14/01/2018,09:39,Liverpool-bound Keita hits wonder goal for Leipzig,Naby Keita showed why Liverpool want to sign him in this transfer window by scoring a superb goal for RB Leipzig in Saturday's 3-1 Bundesliga win over Schalke.,"The 22-year-old Guinea midfielder, who already has a contract with Liverpool to join them next season, showed his class with a thunderbolt of a shot to give Leipzig the lead just before half-time. The result lifted Leipzig to second, 13 points behind leaders Bayern Munich who won 3-1 at Bayer Leverkusen on Friday, while Schalke drop to third. Liverpool reportedly want to bring Keita to Merseyside early after losing Philippe Countinho, who signed for Barcelona last week for 160 million euros ($192 million). However, before kick-off, Leipzig's director of sport Ralf Rangnick insisted Keita will not leave until the end of the season. ""There is no offer from any club, we found a solution last year in September and I expect him to play 19 more games with us,"" Rangnick told Sky. Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool are set to pay around 70 million euros for the midfielder, but reports say they would pay an extra 15 million for Keita to join them early. After Leipzig's Jean-Kevin Augustin had a penalty saved by Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann, Keita struck by rifling a shot home off his right boot on 41 minutes. He was taken off after fouling Alessandro Schoepf on 54 minutes -- his fifth booking this season which means he is suspended for next Saturday's game against Freiburg. Schalke drew level on 55 minutes when Brazil defender Naldo headed home, but Leipzig sealed the win with two goals in quick succession as Timo Werner came off the bench to score on 69 minutes after great work from Emil Forsberg. Portugal midfielder Bruma then slammed home a third goal two minutes later as Schalke suffered a first loss in 13 games, a run stretching back to September. Earlier, Nigel de Jong made an unhappy return to the Bundesliga by conceding a first-half penalty as Mainz threw away the lead in a 3-2 defeat at Hanover. The defensive midfielder played for the Netherlands in the 2010 World Cup final defeat by Spain and won the 2012 Premier League title with Manchester City. The 33-year-old, who played for Hamburg between 2006 and 2009, has signed for Mainz until the end of the season. His new club claimed early goals by Japan striker Yoshinori Muto and Alexander Hack. However, after Hanover striker Niclas Fuellkrug made it 2-1 with a header towards the end of the first half, De Jong brought down midfielder Felix Klaus in the area and the referee pointed to the spot. Fuellkrug netted the resulting penalty on 38 minutes, then hit the winning goal 15 minutes from time to complete his hat-trick. The defeat leaves Mainz 15th in the table, just a point above the bottom three, while Hanover climb to 10th. There was a happier return for Germany striker Mario Gomez, back at Stuttgart after an eight-year gap, as he helped seal a 1-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin. With time running out, former Bayern forward Gomez was brought down in the area by Hertha's Niklas Stark. While the German international was appealing for a penalty, the ball looped off Stark's boot and into the net for the winning own goal on 78 minutes. The result leaves Stuttgart 12th, one place below Hertha, who hit the post through Austria international Valentino Lazaro in the first half. Elsewhere, Augsburg climbed to seventh with a 1-0 win over strugglers Hamburg thanks to a winning header by South Korea international Koo Ja-Cheol. Eintracht Frankfurt blew the chance to jump from ninth to third after French striker Sebastien Haller gave them a lead at home to Freiburg, who equalised through a header by defender Robin Koch in the second half in a 1-1 draw. Werder Bremen and Hoffenheim played out a 1-1 draw as Czech international Theodor Gebre Selassie's second-half goal for hosts Bremen cancelled out Benjamin Huebner's first-half header."
124,13/12/2017,14:22,Bayern maintain iron-grip as Leipzig falter,RB Leipzig risk falling off the pace in the pack chasing run-away Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich with their coach Ralph Hasenhuettl admitting his side is flagging.,"""We're running close to empty and you can see the team is torturing itself,"" said Hasenhuettl after his team scraped a 1-1 draw on Tuesday to just hold onto second place in the table. The Austrian's youthful squad have struggled to meet the demands of having to play virtually every three days in recent weeks, but now have just one game left before the Bundesliga breaks for winter. Last week's 2-1 home defeat against Besiktas meant they bowed out of the Champions League in the group stages and will face Napoli in the last 32 of the Europa League in February. ""It is especially difficult for our younger players. In this three-day rhythm, which goes on and on, you lose your power at some point,"" admitted midfielder Kevin Kampl. Leipzig are at risk of being caught by their league chasing rivals. They have taken only five points in as many games while Bayern have tightened their iron-grip on first place by winning seven of their last eight Bundesliga games. Jupp Heynckes' Bavarians could open a ten-point gap if they beat bottom side Cologne and third-placed Schalke fail to beat Augsburg on Wednesday. Leipzig are currently on 28 points, but Schalke, Dortmund, Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Moenchengladbach are all within three points behind. In Wolfsburg on Tuesday, Leipzig struggled to get back on level terms after Paul Verhaegh slotted an early penalty for the hosts. Hasenhuettl's side finally got the break when Marcel Halstenburg equalised on 52 minutes. However in the closing stages, goalkeeper Peter Gulasci pulled of a string of saves as Divock Origi, on loan from Liverpool, nearly restored Wolfsburg's lead. Leipzig then had defender Dayot Upamecano sent off in injury time for a second yellow card and the French teenager is suspended for Sunday's visit of Hertha Berlin in Leipzig's final Bundesliga game of 2017. ""Against, Hertha, we want to show some of our old strength again,"" said Kampl."
125,06/12/2017,23:10,Late defeat confirms Champions League exit for Leipzig,A late strike from Talisca saw RB Leipzig end their first Champions League campaign with a bitter 2-1 defeat at home to Besiktas on Wednesday night.,"Porto's comprehensive 5-2 victory over Monaco in the other Group G game meant that even a win would not have been enough for Leipzig to progress from the group stage. With their Champions League exit beyond doubt, Leipzig appeared to have salvaged some pride by coming from behind to level against group winners Besiktas thanks to a Naby Keita strike three minutes from time. But Talisca's 90th-minute effort snatched victory for the Turkish side. Spanish striker Alvaro Negredo's ninth-minute penalty had given Besiktas the lead after Willi Orban's was penalised for a reckless challenge on Jeremain Lens. With Porto running riot at home to Monaco, Leipzig were never really in with a chance of leapfrogging the Portuguese side to take second place. The Bundesliga side did respond well, and Orban could have made amends when a loose ball fell to him in front of the Besiktas goal on 15 minutes. However, he dragged his shot onto the post, while Timo Werner and Bruma both forced smart saves from Tolga Zengin later in the first half. Having greeted Besiktas with a chorus of boos and whistles, the Leipzig fans soon turned on the referee as their team surged forward. Werner was ruled offside after finding the net on 21 minutes, before the referee waved away an optimistic penalty appeal from Jean-Kevin Augustin. Zengin continued to frustrate Leipzig after the break, making five saves before the hour mark to keep his team's lead intact. Augustin scored from an offside position on 65 minutes, and Stefan Ilsanker headed over the bar from close range as Leipzig continued to push for the equaliser. The introduction of Dominik Kaiser lifted the home side again with 15 minutes to go. Having joined Leipzig when they were still in the fourth tier of German football, Kaiser was given a roaring reception as he made his Champions League debut. Boosted by his arrival, Leipzig bore down on goal again, with Bruma forcing another flying save from Zengin. Zengin would finally be beaten when Keita broke through the defence in the 87th minute, lofting the ball over the Besiktas goalkeeper to level the scores. The consolation was short-lived, however, as the ball fell to Talisca at a Besiktas corner, and the Brazilian swept the ball into the top corner to restore the lead. Having finished third in Group G, Leipzig's first season in European competition will continue in the Europa League in the new year."
126,01/12/2017,15:43,Timo Werner not going to Real say RB Leipzig,"German international centre forward Timo Werner will not be leaving RB Leipzig for Real Madrid in the next year, the Bundesliga club's sports director Ralf Rangnick said on Friday.","Asked about persistent rumours surrounding the 21-year-old, Rangnick replied: ""Not this winter nor next summer. We will keep Timo Werner here. We are engaged in intensive talks with his agent."" Asked about a story in Marca, the Spanish sports daily, linking Werner to Real, Rangnick said: ""These are things I don't take seriously."" Werner is under contract with Leipzig until 2020. The club are second in the Bundesliga, three points behind Bayern Munich, and visit Hoffenheim on Saturday. Leipzig are third in their Champions League group but will reach the knockout stages if results go their way in the final round of games on Wednesday. Leipzig will lose their other star player next summer. The Guinean midfielder Naby Keita agreed to join Liverpool after the English club said it would pay his buy-out clause of 70 million euros ($83 million)."
127,21/11/2017,22:54,RB Leipzig destroy Monaco to aid last 16 hopes,Devastating RB Leipzig boosted their chances of qualifying for the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday by taking Monaco apart 4-1 with a four-goal first-half demolition that saw them draw level on points with second-place Porto in Group G.,"Leipzig took full advantage of slack Monaco defending and Porto drawing 1-1 at Besiktas earlier on with a free-flowing attacking display that saw the Bundesliga side reignite their knockout hopes. Ralph Hasenhuettl's team stay third due their head-to-head record, which has Porto on top, 5-4 over their two matches. Monaco are out of Europe after failing to win once and picking up just two points from their five matches. Ligue 1 side Monaco needed a win to have any chance of qualifying but gifted Leipzig a sixth-minute lead when defender Jemerson sliced an innocuous Marcel Sabitzer cross past befuddled Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic. After scoring the opener Jemerson turned provider for the opposition three minutes later, his weak pass out from the back easily intercepted by Kevin Kampl, who scampered forward before feeding Timo Werner with an easy chance that the German happily slotted home. Monaco briefly rallied, and Radamel Falcao was unlucky to see his close range stab at goal, after confusion in the Leipzig defence, kicked away by RB stopper Peter Gulacsi, but the Colombian soon had an impact at the other end, clumsily bringing down Willi Orban in his own area and allowing Werner to double his tally from the penalty spot. Falcao made up for his mistake two minutes before the break when he met Rony Lopes' free-kick before Gulacsi could connect with his fist to reduce the deficit to two. But the striker's struggling teammates let him down only with seconds of the half to spare, with Naby Keita spinning Kamil Glik before charging towards goal and ending Monaco's European hopes with a neat finish. Monaco, fresh from a domestic disappointment after a draw at Ligue 1 new boys Amiens at the weekend, failed to rally, and Leipzig cruised to a win that gives them a chance of qualifying from the group. They host leaders Besiktas on December 6 needing to do better than Porto do at home to rock-bottom Monaco."
128,07/11/2017,13:19,"Keita hit with 415,000 euros fake licence fine - report","Liverpool-bound Naby Keita has reportedly been hit with a 415,000 euros ($480,009) fine for allegedly using a forged driving licence.","The Guinea international and RB Leipzig midfielder fell offside with police after twice attempting to gain a German driving permit by using fake Guinean documents. Germany daily Bild quote the figure of 415,000 euros, due to calculations based on Keita's daily salary, and Leipzig's district court would only confirm to SID, an AFP subsidiary, that the fine is a ""six-figure sum"". The 22-year-old, who will join Liverpool for the 2018/19 season, has lodged an appeal against the penalty and should the matter now go to court, the case is likely to be heard next year. Prosecutors in Leipzig accuse Keita of forgery after he allegedly tried to use fake Guinea driving documents to obtain a German licence last December, then again in January. Staff at Leipzig's licensing centre became suspicious and handed the documents to police. Forgery experts identified the papers as ""total counterfeits"", according to Leipzig's district court. However, a spokesman for Keita's club RB Leipzig said that ""after detailed discussions with the player, we don't assume this is a forgery matter"". He is not the first football star in Germany to be hit recently with a huge fine for a driving-related offence. Germany winger Marco Reus had to pay a penalty of 540,000 euros in 2014 when it emerged he had been driving without a valid driving licence. Keita has also landed himself in hot water on the pitch in recent weeks after being sent off three times in seven games for both club and country."
129,04/11/2017,18:10,Werner fires Leipzig back to winning ways,Timo Werner proved his readiness to return to the Germany team as his late goal sealed RB Leipzig's 2-1 come-from-behind win at home to Hanover 96 in the Bundesliga on Saturday.,"The 21-year-old, who has just recovered from a neck injury, is set to feature for the world champions in high-profile friendly matches against England and France in the next 10 days after missing his country's matches last month. On Saturday he set up Yussuf Poulsen's equaliser and then netted an 85th-minute winner after the Brazilian Jonathas had given the visitors the lead. The result left Leipzig provisionally second in the table, one point behind defending champions and current leaders Bayern Munich and two points ahead of Borussia Dortmund in third. Dortmund play host to Bayern later (1730 GMT) in the game of the weekend. Before kick-off on Saturday, Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl declared ""this is a game which will be decided by mentality,"" and his team proved him right. Having beaten Dortmund 4-2 last weekend, Hanover were on course for another major scalp when Jonathas fired home on 56 minutes against the run of play. Werner earlier had a first-half effort disallowed for offside, then rattled the woodwork just before the break. Liverpool-bound midfielder Naby Keita, who has been accused by German police of using a forged driving licence, helped turn the game when he came on for the final half hour. Leipzig drew level when Werner's pass to Poulsen was tapped home by the Danish international at the far post with 20 minutes left. Werner then grabbed the winner by rifling home a cross from substitute Emil Forsberg five minutes from time. Elsewhere Schalke, who are now undefeated in their last six games in all competitions, climbed to fourth with a 1-0 win at Freiburg as Daniel Caligiuri scored the only goal against his old club. Hamburg climbed out of the bottom three with a 3-1 win at home to Stuttgart, who had midfielder Dzenis Burnic sent off after just 13 minutes for two yellow cards. Aaron Hunt put Hamburg ahead from a free-kick after a goalkeeping blunder by Ron-Robert Zieler, but Stuttgart levelled just after half-time when Daniel Ginczek converted a penalty. However, Filip Kostic put Hamburg back in front and Germany Under-17 international Jann-Fiete Arp, with his second in two games, sealed the win. Borussia Moenchengladbach dropped to seventh after their 1-1 draw at home to Mainz. Mainz took the lead on 19 minutes through French defender Abdou Diallo, but Gladbach equalised when towering Danish centre-back Jannik Vestergaard headed home midway through the second half. Mid-table Augsburg and Bayer Leverkusen shared the points in a 1-1 draw as Kevin Volland's strike just after the break was quickly cancelled out by Austrian defender Kevin Danso."
130,04/11/2017,16:09,Keita accused of using forged driving licences,"Liverpool-bound midfielder Naby Keita could face a six-figure fine after allegedly twice using forged licences to try to obtain a German driving permit, a report claimed on Saturday.","The RB Leipzig defensive midfielder and Guinea international, who is joining Liverpool for 2018/19, is accused of two counts of forgery which carries a minimum penalty of 100,000 euros ($115,195), according to Bild. The daily newspaper claims Keita, 22, is also under investigation for driving in Germany without a valid licence. German prosecutors accuse Keita of using forged Guinean licences at the licensing centre in Leipzig in December 2016, then again six weeks later in January, in order to get a permit. The drivers licences from the West African nation were apparently so badly forged that employees in Leipzig became suspicious and handed them to police. ""Both documents were identified as complete forgeries,"" a court official told Bild. ""It's a six-figure penalty,"" confirmed the official when asked how much a potential fine would be. By comparison, Germany winger Marco Reus was fined 540,000 euros in December 2014 when it emerged he had driven for years without a valid licence. Leipzig, who started this weekend third in Germany's top flight, say they are aware of Keita's legal problems. ""We know abaout this. After detailed discussions we're not assuming this is a forgery matter,"" said Leipzig's press officer Florian Scholz. ""Naby's lawyer is involved and is waiting for access to the records."" Before Saturday's German league match against fourth-placed Hanover 96, Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl was tight-lipped. ""I only heard about this yesterday and I have not discussed the issue with Keita,"" said the Leipzig boss. Keita has also landed himself in hot water on the pitch in recent weeks after being sent off three times in seven games for both club and country."
131,29/10/2017,14:21,Leipzig wait on Keita for Porto clash,RB Leipzig are waiting to see how Liverpool-bound Naby Keita recovers from a foot injury for their Champions League clash at Porto on Wednesday.,"Leipzig's key midfielder hurt his foot four minutes before the final whistle in Leipzig's 2-0 Bundesliga defeat at Bayern Munich on Saturday. ""He took a blow on the foot and then had a lot of pain,"" said RB coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""I hope it will be no problem for Wednesday."" The injury happened when Keita was kicked by Bayern's Spain international Thiago Alcantara, who later came to the Leipzig dressing room to apologise, according to Hasenhuettl. Keita was able to take part in a light training session on Sunday. ""He's already getting better, the kick wasn't so bad,"" Hasenhuettl told reporters. Leipzig are second in Group G, five points adrift of Besiktas in their first Champions League season and are hoping for another win over Porto, who they beat 3-2 at the Red Bull Arena a fortnight ago. On Saturday, Keita limped off against Bayern leaving RB to finish the match with nine men after Hasenhuettl had used up his three substitutions and captain Willi Orban had been sent off after just 13 minutes. The result left Bayern three points clear at the top of the Bundesliga table, four ahead of third-placed Leipzig. RB were beaten twice by Bayern this week after also losing 5-4 on penalties in Wednesday's German Cup clash which finished 1-1 after extra time when Keita had earlier been sent off. Keita, who will join Liverpool next season, was shown a red card on 54 minutes in the second-round cup defeat after receiving two bookings which left Leipzig to play for more than an hour with ten men."

Both sides currently sit behind league leaders Borussia Dortmund, who hope to return to winning ways when they host Hanover 96. Here are five things to look out for on this Bundesliga weekend: Emotions are sure to run high when RB Leipzig head to Munich this Saturday, after tensions boiled over during Wednesday's cup clash. Leipzig sporting director Ralf Rangnick squabbled with Bayern players at half-time, while coach Ralph Hasenhuettl accused the referee of ""double standards"". The team played 65 of the 120 minutes with ten men on Wednesday, after Naby Keita's red card, and Hasenhuettl is expected to rotate his exhausted squad. Werner, Lukas Klostermann and Diego Demme should all return to the starting line-up. ""It will be a very difficult game (on Saturday),"" said Leipzig forward Marcel Sabitzer. ""We will need to push ourselves to the limit. The only good thing is that Bayern have also had to play 120 minutes."" Borussia Dortmund head to Hanover in good spirits on Saturday, having picked up their first win in four games with a midweek victory over Magdeburg. Dortmund still top the Bundesliga, but their five-point lead has evaporated in recent weeks, following defeat by RB Leipzig and a 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt. Bosz had been accused of reckless tactics after the string of disappointing results, but vowed this week that he would not change his philosophy. ""The system was working at the beginning of the season,"" Bosz protested. ""It was fun to watch, and fun for the players."" Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Mario Goetze are expected to return to the starting team against Hanover. Still bottom of the table and without a win this season, Cologne face an in-form Bayer Leverkusen side in the Rhine Derby on Saturday. After the shock departure of sporting director Joerg Schmadtke last week, victory in the cup against Hertha Berlin has given Cologne hope ahead of the derby. The relegation-threatened club have beaten their local rivals just once since 2011, and they should expect no mercy from Leverkusen this time around. ""It sounds tough, but if Cologne are already on the ground, we should keep kicking them,"" said Leverkusen striker Julian Brandt. Thorgan Hazard's winner fired Borussia Moenchengladbach into the next round of the German Cup on Tuesday, and the Belgian has promised more of the same against Hoffenheim this weekend.

134,26/10/2017,00:18,Werner penalty miss hands Bayern cup win,Bayern Munich squeezed past 10-man RB Leipzig in Wednesday's dramatic German Cup second-round clash with a 5-4 win in a penalty shoot-out after Timo Werner missed the final crucial kick.,"Although Leipzig's midfielder Naby Keita was sent off with half an hour left, Emil Forsberg gave RB the lead before Bayern's Thiago Alcantara equalised as the tie finished 1-1 after extra-time to go to penalties. When Bayern converted all five of their spot-kicks, all the pressure was on Leipzig star Werner for the crucial 10th penalty. The 21-year-old Germany striker had his head in his hands as his weak shot was saved by Munich's shot-stopper Sven Ulreich. ""I'm just glad I could help the team,"" beamed the relieved Ulreich, stand-in for injured Manuel Neuer. Bayern advance to the third round after the first of a double-header this week between the Bundesliga giants who meet again in the league on Saturday at Munich's Allianz Arena. Bayern are second in Germany's top flight with Leipzig third and just a point behind. ""It's a shame that this great match was ruined by Keita's sending off,"" fumed Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""The boys can be proud of themselves, but that does not detract from their frustration that I felt in the locker room. They gave everything and were not rewarded."" This was an action-packed cup tie as Leipzig had three clear penalty appeals before referee Felix Zwayer finally pointed to the spot. Bayern had an almighty scare on 35 minutes when Arturo Vidal brought down Forsberg right on the edge of the penalty area. Zwayer initially signalled for a penalty, but changed the decision to a free-kick just outside the area, which Forsberg fired over the bar. Vidal was booked for the foul while Keita saw his first yellow just before the half-time whistle for fouling Thiago Alcantara. Bayern had another penalty scare when Jerome Boateng clattered Leipzig striker Jean-Kevin Augustin on 51 minutes. Again, Zwayer again waved on play. Liverpool-bound Keita was sent off for his second booking on 54 minutes when he held back Robert Lewandowski as the pair chased the ball. Despite the numerical disadvantage, Leipzig took the lead with a penalty at the third time of asking. RB striker Yussuf Poulsen went down after the slightest of contact from Boateng, but this time Zwayer awarded the penalty and Forsberg drilled it home on 68 minutes. The lead lasted five minutes. Boateng made amends for conceding the penalty when his long pass picked Thiago unmarked to head the equaliser. RB goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi pulled off the first of three outstanding saves on 80 minutes to deny Lewandowski as the hosts clung. In the first period of extra-time, Gulacsi then denied Thiago and Joshua Kimmich with rapid-fire saves. When the game went to a shoot-out, David Alaba, Mats Hummels, Sebastian Rudy and stand-in captain Arjen Robben all converted their penalties for Munich before Werner's blunder sent Bayern through. In the other ties, there was an upset earlier when Hertha Berlin crashed out after a 3-1 defeat at home to Cologne, who are bottom of the Bundesliga. In the other all-Bundesliga ties, Wolfsburg squeezed past Hanover 96 with a 1-0 win while Werder Bremen enjoyed a shock victory at home to Hoffenheim by he same margin. On Tuesday, Swedish teenager Alexander Isak shone for holders Borussia Dortmund in their 5-0 romp at third-division Magdeburg. The 18-year-old Isak scored and set up a goal on his first start for the club with star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubayemang out with a leg injury After Gonzalo Castro gave Dortmund a first-half lead, Isak showed ice-cold finishing by slotting home on 47 minutes. The floodgates opened in the final 16 minutes as Andriy Yarmolenko, Marc Bartra and Shinji Kagawa all scored."

The Bundesliga clash on Saturday is also a mouth-watering prospect with just a point separating third-placed Leipzig and Bayern, who are second. Leipzig's home cup match against Bayern is the plum tie of the second round, which includes holders Borussia Dortmund at third-division Magdeburg on Tuesday. ""We're in the flow. The fans can look forward to some fireworks,"" said Leipzig's Sabitzer, the match-winner in Saturday's 1-0 league victory against Stuttgart. Leipzig's CEO Oliver Mintzlaff was more reserved, insisting Bayern ""are in a class of their own with a top squad full of world-class players"" even without their injured stars. ""We'll need a perfect day, but we believe in ourselves and want to show again that we are good for a surprise,"" he added. Mueller tore a hamstring in Saturday's win at Hamburg and Spain's Thiago Alacantara is set to step into the attacking midfield role. Hummels, who will be replaced by Niklas Suele if he fails to be fit, is relishing the back-to-back showdowns against Leipzig. ""They have an incredible amount of quality and play a very intensive game with very intensive counter-pressing,"" said Hummels. ""You have to be very awake and think very, very fast. ""That is the most important thing - that you are switched on from the first second to the fact that the opponent can make your life hard."" Bayern beat Leipzig twice in the Bundesliga last season, romping to a 3-0 victory in Munich last December, with three goals in the opening 45 minutes, before winning 5-4 away last May.

He came off the bench at half-time, set up Corentin Tolisso's winning goal on 52 minutes and then went off injured three minutes later.

Ten people, including four policemen, were injured as Leipzig fans were attacked. ""Red Bull, get lost - football belongs to us"", read a poster publicising the protest in Dortmund, while the ultras' website urged fans to demonstrate. The Austrian drinks brand is accused by some of using football for the sole purpose of advertising, and is often the target of anger from the Bundesliga's most fanatical supporters. The German Football Association punished Dortmund by ordering the closure of the rowdy ""Yellow Wall"" section for a match, but in Leipzig's following game, fans of Borussia Moenchengladbach unfurled banners in solidarity with Dortmund. This time, police have planned a massive deployment. ""Those who want to challenge or attack our visitors will find us on the way,"" police officer Edzard Freyhoff said. ""Our threshold of intervention will be very low."" Regional police chief Gregor Lange added: ""We have to protect the supporters of Leipzig and Dortmund from violent elements and criminals, who do not deserve to be called fans."" Two groups of supporters issued a joint statement online explaining their position: ""We will never accept a multi-national company to use football to publicise it. ""In the stadium, our motto will be the same as last year: to show that no money in the world can buy fanaticism, fidelity or a culture of supporters."" RB Leipzig, who shot up from the German fifth tier to the Bundesliga in seven years thanks to Red Bull's investments, won over some support from the general public last season by being the only team to challenge Bayern Munich, finishing in second place."
138,27/09/2017,14:15,Germany star left dizzy by din in Besiktas,"Germany striker Timo Werner has sought medical advice after he had to come off early in RB Leipzig's defeat at Besiktas because of dizziness caused by the ""deafening"" noise from the crowd .","""Timo had circulation and breathing problems,"" said Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl after the 21-year-old was hauled off on 32 minutes complaining of dizziness in Tuesday's 2-0 away defeat. Hasenhuettl said Werner went to see a specialist doctor as soon as Leipzig returned home after Tuesday's away defeat and the striker is set to play in Germany's key World Cup qualifier away to Northern Ireland next week. Werner struggled with the intense noise from Besiktas' fans at the Vodafone Arena and after ear plugs failed to reduce the din for him, he put his hands over his ears in clear distress before being taken off. Hasenhuettl admitted the thunderous noise from the Turkish crowd was a reason for the defeat in the first away Champions League game in the German club's history. ""In the first half, the lads were a little overwhelmed by the occasion,"" said Hasenhuettl. ""It's impossible to prepare your team for an atmosphere like this. There was a deafening noise. ""It was clear to see that being the young team we are, we need to gain some experience. ""It was a lesson for all of us. ""I saw who I can count on in times like these."" The entire RB Leipzig team struggled with the din as first-half goals by ex-Liverpool winger Ryan Babel and Brazilian Talisca sealed the win which left Besiktas top of Group G. ""You don't play every weekend against a backdrop where you can hear nothing else from five metres away. You couldn't communicate on the pitch,"" said defender Stefan Ilsanker. Liverpool-bound Naby Keita, who is currently suspended in the Bundesliga for a red card, produced a poor performance at Besiktas and was taken off after 59 minutes, which did not impress Hasenhuettl. ""Naby was not good today, maybe it would have been better not to have taken him,"" admitted the Leipzig coach with the Guinea midfielder to join Liverpool next season. Having drawn their opening Champions League match 1-1 at home to Monaco -- RB Leipzig's debut in Europe -- the German club, which finished a surprise second last season in the Bundesliga, is third in their group."
139,20/09/2017,14:27,German FA investigate Baier for obscene gesture,Augsburg captain Daniel Baier could face a heavy German Football Association (DFB) fine after being investigated for making an obscene gesture during a televised Bundesliga match.,"When Baier was tackled near the RB Leipzig bench late in Augsburg's 1-0 victory during Tuesday's bad-tempered match, the 33-year-old spat in the direction of RB coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. The television camera caught Baier also making an obscene gesture. The DFB confirmed Wednesday they will investigate, referee Daniel Siebert not having seen the incident. Baier claims he twice tried to apologise, both after the final whistle on the pitch and again in the dressing room, but that Hasenhuettl rejected the apology. ""He should have been shown a red. It was a pity that the fourth official didn't see it. He (Baier) did not apologise,"" fumed Hasenhuettl. Immediately after the match, Augsburg's skipper saw no reason to say 'sorry'. ""What should I apologise for?"" he told Sky. ""My god, it's a football match and emotions are involved. ""I made a gesture, what more can I say?"" However, he apologised in a statement posted on social media channel Instagram on Wednesday. ""Out of the emotion, I let myself be swept into making a gesture that I don't know how I got to,"" Baier wrote. ""I apologise to all those who interpreted it as offensive. ""I apologised to the team before training, because the senseless gesture pushed our great performance into the background. ""I hope that those at RB Leipzig will also think differently following last night, when I tried to apologise on the pitch and later in their dressing room to clean up the misunderstanding."" There is a history of bad-blood between the pair after Hasenhuettl previously commented on Baier's behaviour. Augsburg are having a stellar start to the season with 10 points from their first five league games to go third in Germany's top flight. In contrast, Champions League side RB Leipzig are struggling to recapture last season's form, which saw them finish second to reigning champions Bayern Munich. They are eighth having lost twice in the league so far this season after starting the 2016/17 campaign with a record 13-game unbeaten run on their Bundesliga debut."
140,14/09/2017,02:25,Leipzig can compete on European stage - coach,"RB Leipzig have shown that they can compete at the top level of European football, coach Ralph Hasenhuettl said after the German club's 1-1 draw with Monaco on their Champions League debut on Wednesday.","""We have made our first steps here. We played well against a strong opponent, and showed that we can compete at this level,"" said Hasenhuettl. ""It was a good start from us all, and it makes us want more."" Leipzig picked up a point from their first ever Champions League fixture, after Emil Forsberg's first half opener was quickly cancelled out by Monaco's Youri Tielemans. The Leipzig coach admitted that he felt his team could have taken all three points against Monaco, and said that both he and his players had been cautious as they made their first foray into Champions League football. ""I think everyone noticed that we weren't as calm on the ball and that we didn't take as many risks as usual. ""I chose not to bring on another forward towards the end, because it's always possible to concede from set pieces, and Monaco showed towards the end that they could be dangerous."" The cautious approach, Hasenhuettl said, was partly down to the absence of Liverpool bound midfield star Naby Keita, who was ruled out of Wednesday's fixture with a groin injury. ""We did miss Naby. If he had been there, then we probably would had a bit more stability and a bit more penetration going forward. To get a point without him is a great achievement."" It is nearly thirty years since the city of Leipzig, where the German Football Federation was founded, has hosted a game in European club competition. The historical significance, Hasenhuettl said, had not escaped him and his team. ""The atmosphere gave us goosebumps tonight,"" said striker Timo Werner. ""We really wanted to win, but Monaco defended well."" ""I also noticed that the expectations were high, and the people of Leipzig were excited to see a game at this level,"" said Hasenhuettl. ""For us it was obviously something special."" The Austrian even broke with his usual touchline dress code of tracksuit and trainers, donning a suit to mark the occasion of RB's Champions League debut. ""The players started laughing when I came to give the team talk, because they're not used to seeing me in a suit."" Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim, meanwhile, told reporters that his team's lack of potency going forward was down to the personnel changes he had endured during the summer, most notably the departure of Kylian Mbappé to Paris Saint Germain. ""Every season, it's different,"" said Jardim. ""It's a new team. You can't compare this team to the one we had last season or the one we had two seasons ago."""
141,13/09/2017,23:24,Leipzig hold Monaco on Champions League debut,Youri Tielemans levelled a minute after Emil Forsberg's opener for RB Leipzig to salvage a 1-1 draw for French champions Monaco in the Champions League on Wednesday.,"With Leipzig making their competition debut, Forsberg's goal raised the roof at the Red Bull Arena. It will go down in history as his club's first on European football's biggest stage, though it is unlikely to be their last. ""It's something special to have score Leipzig's first ever goal in the Champions League,"" said Forsberg after the game. ""I'm very proud."" Despite their inexperience at this exalted level, Leipzig appeared undaunted in this Group G tie. Teenager Dayot Upamecano was imperious at the back, while in-form striker Timo Werner looked dangerous up front. With Monaco's back line holding firm, and their wingers Djibril Sidibe and Adama Diakhaby struggling to strike on the counter-attack, there were few chances to speak of in the opening half an hour. But in the 33rd minute, Leipzig struck. Swedish winger Forsberg found space on the left and blasted the ball past Diego Benaglio at the near post. The euphoria, though, was short-lived as a deep cross from Sidibe found Diakhaby, who nodded the ball down for Tielemans to prod past Peter Gulacsi. ""The coach told me I'd play as the second attacker and talked to me about my positioning and I think it went well for me,"" said Tielemans. Werner, who had twice come centimetres from scoring in the first half, was threatening again after the break, and began to pick up more space as he was switched to a wider position on the left. ""It was obviously an incredible feeling today,"" said 21-year-old striker Werner. ""We were desperate to win today, but sadly we couldn't quite do it."" Several half-chances fell Werner's way, but it was Jean-Kevin Augustin who came closest to breaking the deadlock, denied in a one-on-one with Benaglio. He had another chance in injury time, breaking free of the defence in the Monaco penalty area, only to be called offside. Yet on a night where neither side reached their penetrative best, it ended a point apiece. Leipzig's Champions League debut crowned a blistering rise from the lower leagues since their founding in 2009. After finishing second in the Bundesliga last season, the club were celebrating the biggest night of their history against Monaco. Against more experienced opposition and without their star midfielder Naby Keita, it was not a given that they would avoid defeat in their maiden Champions League appearance. Many of those on the pitch had played for Leipzig since the club was in the second or third division. Few had any idea how RB's still young squad would react to the pressure of playing on club football's biggest stage. The more dangerous side over long periods, Leipzig will nonetheless be as happy as Monaco with the draw. Leipzig next face Besiktas in Turkey, with Monaco hosting Porto."
142,13/09/2017,14:39,Real target Werner plans to join 'big club',"Timo Werner has admitted he wants to join a ""big club"" amidst reports Real Madrid are interesting in signing the Germany striker, who makes his Champions League debut on Wednesday.","Werner will play the first Champions League match of his career at Leipzig's Red Bull Arena when RB make their debut in European football's top club competition against last season's semi-finalists Monaco. The 21-year-old forward, who has a contract until 2020, is in a rich vein of form, scoring six goals in his last four games for club and country. Werner forced his way into the plans of Germany's head coach Joachim Loew for next year's World Cup by helping his country win July's Confederations Cup final in Russia. He has now earned a place in Loew's first-choice team. However, he has told magazine Sport Bild that he eventually wants to move on from Leipzig, and Spanish newspapers Marca and AS have already reported Real's interest in the striker. ""Until now, everything has gone well with Leipzig, therefore I don't think about what could happen in one, two or three years, but of course I what to play for a big club at some point,"" he said. Werner scored 21 goals in 31 league games last season to help Leipzig finish second in Germany's top flight to Bayern Munich. ""FC Bayern are also a big club, but that's not a topic I will busy myself with,"" he said. ""In Spain, in Barca, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid three clubs tops,"" added Werner, who puts English Premier League clubs ""Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City"" in the same bracket. RB Leipzig's head of football Oliver Mintzlaff says he hopes Werner can take the ""next step"" in his career with the east German club. The striker does not rule out staying, providing Leipzig keep challenging for titles. ""Perhaps, RB will also become a big club, I am quite sure of that,"" said Werner. However he was vague about possible extension negotiations. ""If I don't extend, that doesn't mean I'll leave next summer, but on the other hand, it doesn't often mean that one stays if you have a five-year contract,"" he added."
143,09/09/2017,15:41,"Bring on Monaco, boasts Leipzig coach",RB Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl says his side proved they are ready for their Champions League debut at home to Monaco on Wednesday after producing two stunning goals in the Bundesliga.,"Leipzig earned a 2-0 win at Hamburg on Friday after Liverpool-bound Naby Keita unleashed a fierce drive from outside the area, which hit the top right-hand corner from 20 metres, following a quickly-taken free kick. Fleet-footed German international striker Timo Werner then grabbed his fifth goal in four games for club and country by holding off two defenders and scoring to cap a powerful run. ""It almost unfair on the opposition when he runs with speed like that,"" quipped Hasenhuettl after Werner's stunning second-half effort. Having worn down the Hamburg defence, Leipzig earned their second straight win in Germany's top-flight to set themselves up for the reigning French champions. ""We can now mix up our game, we have many different faces and will pick the necessary one,"" said Hasenhuettl with one eye on Monaco. ""We're looking forward to the game, because it is a reward for last season."" Hasenhuettl is concerned about Keita, who will join Liverpool for 70 million euros ($84.3m) next season, after the Guinea midfielder picked up a knock in Hamburg. ""I hope it's not so bad,"" said Hasenhuettl. RB Leipzig are not a conventional club with a long history. They were founded in 2009 when energy drinks giants Red Bull bought a licence from a fifth-division club near Leipzig and four promotions in seven years took them to Germany's top flight. A record run of 13 matches unbeaten at the start of their first Bundesliga season heralded Leipzig's arrival in 2016/17 and they finished second to Bayern Munich on their debut year in Germany's top flight. The club's full name is RasenBallsport Leipzig -- the moniker is a made-up German word meaning ""grass-ball sport"" because the German Football League (DFL) forbids using a sponsor's name in a club's title. Despite having a huge budget, Hasenhuettl and Leipzig's director of sport Ralf Rangnick only recruit players in their early 20s, whose talent they can nurture, and have no interest in buying established stars. A good example is Werner, who was bought for 10 million euros when Stuttgart were relegated in 2015/16. The 21-year-old scored 21 league goals last season to propel him into the Germany team, which won the Confederations Cup in July and he netted twice in last Monday's 6-0 rout of Norway in a World Cup qualifier. But for now, Leipzig are focused on hosting Monaco, who reached the semi-finals of last season's Champions League. ""It's going to be an emotional highlight,"" said Leipzig captain Willi Orban. ""Many of us have not yet played in a Champions League game before."""
144,31/08/2017,13:13,Leipzig sign Kampl as cover for Liverpool-bound Keita,RB Leipzig announced Thursday they have signed Slovenia midfielder Kevin Kampl as a possible replacement for Guinea international Naby Keita who has agreed to join Liverpool for the 2018-19 season.,"The 27-year-old Kampl switches from Bayer Leverkusen for a reported fee of 20 million euros ($23.7 million). His versatility as a defensive midfielder or winger means Kampl could potentially fill the playmaker role Keita will vacate when he leaves for Anfield at the end of the current season. Kampl has made 67 appearances in Germany's top flight for former clubs Borussia Dortmund and Leverkusen since moving to the Bundesliga in 2015 from Leipzig's sister club Red Bull Salzburg. With the transfer window set to close in Germany on Thursday, Leverkusen wasted no time in signing Greek teenage defender Panagiotis Retsos from Olympiakos for a reported 17.5 million euros on a five-year contract. ""Bayer Leverkusen have always played in the Champions League, despite a lot of competition nationally, that really impressed me,"" said the South African-born Retsos."
145,27/08/2017,17:48,Werner double helps Leipzig floor Freiburg,Germany striker Timo Werner netted twice as RB Leipzig came from behind to floor Freiburg 4-1 on Sunday and get their Bundesliga season on track.,"All four Leipzig goals came after the break as they roared back after a poor first half on the back of losing their opening match of the season 2-0 at Schalke last weekend. Werner's goals were a timely reminder for Germany head coach Joachim Loew, who included the fleet-footed forward for World Cup qualifiers against the Czech Republic on Friday in Prague and against Norway in Stuttgart four days later. Werner and his forward partner Jean-Kevin Augustin were instrumental in turning the game around. Freiburg took a deserved lead at the Red Bull Arena when left winger Marco Terrazzino escaped his marker and Florian Niederlechner slotted home his cross on 24 minutes. But Leipzig flew out of the blocks for the second half and were level within three minutes as a corner by Emil Forsberg was headed home by Werner. Leipzig then took the lead when captain Willi Orban tapped home on 55 minutes after some good work by new signing Augustin, recruited from Paris Saint-Germain. The Frenchman raced down the right wing before firing in a cross which centre-back Orban simply had to tap home. Augustin then provided the killer pass which put Werner into space to slot home his second on 69 minutes and make it 3-1. Augustin made way for Portuguese midfielder Bruma on 76 minutes and just two minutes later the new signing from Galatasaray netted with a stunning shot from the edge of the area. To compound Freiburg's misery, midfielder Nicolas Hoefler was sent off inside the final 10 minutes after his foul on Forsberg saw him earn a second yellow. A fortnight before they make their Champions League debut at home to Monaco, the victory was a timely confidence booster for Leipzig. On Saturday, two goals from Robert Lewandowski sealed a 2-0 win for defending champions Bayern Munich at Werder Bremen. Borussia Dortmund are top of the fledgling table on goal difference from Bayern after a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin, with goals by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Nuri Sahin."
146,07/05/2017,01:47,Leipzig promise new recruits for Champions League debut,RB Leipzig's director of sport Ralf Rangnick says new signings are set to follow after the Bundesliga club secured direct qualification in next season's Champions League on Saturday.,"RB Leipzig capped a superb first Bundesliga campaign as strikers Timo Werner and Davie Selke scored twice in their 4-1 thrashing of Hertha Berlin. Leipzig, founded by energy drinks giants Red Bull in 2009, only reached Germany's top flight this season after four promotions in seven years. They are second only to champions Bayern Munich in the table and are certain to finish in the top three, which means a direct path into the Champions League group stage. With Red Bull's billions behind them, Rangnick says RB are set to open the cheque book to recruit for their Champions League debut. ""When we play in the Champions League, we'll have to strengthen the squad,"" said Rangnick, 58, before kick-off in Berlin. ""The whole thing of course will have to take into account the requirements of financial fair-play. ""Whether three or four new additions will be enough, I do not know, perhaps we'll need five or six and we need more quality across the board."" Leipzig have won 20 of their 32 games in Germany's top tier. They are the first club since Kaiserslautern in 1998 to qualify directly for the Champions League immediately after promotion to the Bundesliga. ""No one could have anticipated that we would have played a season like that and had so many points,"" added Rangnick. ""At the start of the season, we just talked about being worry-free (from relegation) from the first match, therefore we're very happy."" Coach Ralph Hasenhuettl was emotional at the final whistle at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. ""I am simply proud,"" said the 49-year-old. ""There is no better place to celebrate direct qualification in front of so many fans. That was sensational,"" he added after around 10,000 RB fans made the one-hour trip to Berlin. With 19 league goals to his credit, Leipzig's Werner, 21, is the highest-scoring German striker in the Bundesliga this season. ""Today the joy of reaching the Champions League dominates all else,"" said Werner. ""We have earned this over the year and have achieved something great. ""This was our little 'cup final', next year we will be amongst the best teams in Europe."" Werner made his Germany debut in March's 1-0 friendly win over England. He will discover on May 17 whether he is part of die Mannschaft's squad for June's Confederations Cup in Russia from June 17-July 2 or will join Germany's Under-21 team at June's junior European championships in Poland. ""It's the next goal I have,"" he said. ""If I go to the Under-21s, then I will also be pleased. ""There is also something to be won there, but of course if I go to the Confed Cup then I will of course be absolutely delighted."""
147,06/05/2017,21:22,RB Leizpig claim direct Champions League berth,RB Leipzig capped off a superb first Bundesliga campaign with automatic qualification for next season's Champions League as Timo Werner scored twice in Saturday's 4-1 thrashing of Hertha Berlin.,"Leipzig, founded by energy drinks giants Red Bull in 2009, only reached Germany's top flight this season after four promotions in seven years. They lie second in the table and are certain to finish in the top three, which means a direct path into the Champions League group stage. ""I am very proud. There is no better place to celebrate before so many fans,"" said Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl as 10,000 RB fans travelled to Berlin. They are the first Bundesliga club since Kaiserslautern in 1998 to qualify directly for the Champions League immediately after winning promotion. Germany striker Werner, 21, now has 19 league goals in a superb season. ""We have deserved this over the course of the season,"" said Werner. ""We have achieved something big and belong among the top teams in Europe."" He netted the opener on 12 minutes with a bullet header from a curling cross from midfielder Marcel Sabitzer. A howler by Hertha goalkeeper Rune Jarstein, who slipped attempting a clearance, allowed Yussuf Poulsen to knock the ball across the empty Berlin goal for Werner's simple tap-in on 54 minutes that made it 2-0. Hertha pulled a goal back when Leipzig's substitute midfielder Rani Khedira -- younger brother of World Cup winner Sami -- headed the ball into his own net on 85 minutes. But Davie Selke, on for Poulsen, netted on 89 minutes and again in stoppage time to seal RB's victory. Hertha remain on course for a Europa League place in fifth. Earlier, Juan Bernat netted as champions Bayern Munich laboured to a 1-0 win over bottom club Darmstadt, which confirmed their relegation. Bayern, Bundesliga champions for the fifth year in a row, were made to work at the Allianz Arena and Darmstadt might have snatched a point, but Hamit Altintop's late penalty was saved. Bernat beat two defenders then coolly chipped Darmstadt goalkeeper Michael Esser for the 18th-minute goal that proved to be the winner. Bayern are 10 points ahead of RB Leipzig while Darmstadt are now an insurmountable nine points from safety with just two games left. Elsewhere, Borussia Dortmund took a step towards a direct Champions League place by climbing into third with a 2-1 win at home to Hoffenheim, who slip to fourth. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's second-half header which proved the winner saw him join Bayern's Robert Lewandowski on 28 goals in the race to be the Bundesliga's top scorer. Marco Reus gave Dortmund a controversial lead after just four minutes, replays showing he was a metre offside when Gonzalo Castro's final pass put him behind the defence to tuck home. Hoffenheim were then left fuming when Reus controlled the ball with his arm -- which the referee missed -- before firing in a cross which hit defender Pavel Kaderabek's hand. Referee Felix Brych pointed to the spot, but justice was seen to be done when Aubameyang fired wide on 14 minutes. The Gabon hot-shot made amends when he headed home on 82 minutes, but Hoffenheim pulled a goal back when ex-Leicester City striker Andrej Kramaric slotted in a late penalty. Hoffenheim are now two points behind Dortmund with two games remaining. Ingolstadt, 17th in the table, still have a chance of staying up after their 1-1 draw with Bayer Leverkusen. Sonny Kittel's second-half goal for the hosts was cancelled out by Leverkusen's 17-year-old midfielder Kai Havertz, leaving Ingolstadt three points from safety. Winger Andre Hahn scored a 94th-minute equaliser in mid-table Borussia Moenchengladbach's 1-1 draw with Augsburg, whose Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason netted their goal. Wolfsburg, the 2009 champions, are now three points clear of the bottom three after their 2-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt thanks to goals by Daniel Didavi and Mario Gomez."
148,15/04/2017,19:24,Delight as Leipzig Champions League dream comes true,Germany striker Timo Werner said RB Leipzig's dreams had come true as their 4-0 rout of Freiburg on Saturday guaranteed them a crack at the Champions League next season.,"With five games left, Leipzig are guaranteed to finish their first Bundesliga season in the top four. The first three teams in Germany's top flight qualify directly for the Champions League, while the fourth-placed side goes into a play-off for a group stage berth. Danish striker Yussuf Poulsen gave hosts RB an early lead before putting Werner in behind the Freiburg defence just before the break for his 16th league goal this season. Guinea midfielder Naby Keita netted with a superb shot on 51 minutes before Diego Demme hit a late fourth to claim his first goal for RB. ""It was another important step. Now we want to achieve more and fulfil our next dream,"" said Werner, with one eye on Europe. This was Leipzig's fourth straight win and their Champions League chance is reward for a club that started their first Bundesliga season with a record 13-match unbeaten run. ""Of course, I am delighted,"" said coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""We were prepared for a very hard game and we found the right solutions. ""We took the pace out of the game with the third goal and you could see in the second-half that Freiburg certainly know how to play. ""But once we went 3-0 up, we managed to calm the game down."" Leipzig are the only club from the former East Germany in the top tier. There could be two German clubs making their Champions League debuts next season as third-placed Hoffenheim are also on course for a group stage berth alongside runaway league leaders Bayern Munich. Saturday's win for Leipzig was over-shadowed by the death of a 56-year-old fan who collapsed before kick-off with heart failure and died later in hospital. ""Football now takes a backseat for us. Our condolences and deep sympathy are with the family of the deceased,"" the club wrote on their Twitter account. It is the second time in recent weeks that an RB fan has passed away on the day of a Leipzig home game after a supporter also died before their defeat to Wolfsburg on March 11."
149,08/04/2017,17:59,Poulsen's late strike trims Bayern's lead,Yussuf Poulsen's late goal sealed ten-man RB Leipzig's 1-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday to trim Bayern Munich's runaway lead to seven points with seven Bundesliga games left.,"Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern host Borussia Dortmund on Saturday evening when Robert Lewandowski and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang -- the league's top scorers -- go head-to-head. But before the heavyweight clash in Munich, second-placed Leipzig took their chance to reduce the 10-point gap and sealed the win in a dramatic final five minutes. Hosts Leipzig were reduced to 10 men when captain Willi Orban was sent off for a second yellow card on 88 minutes for a marginal foul on Leverkusen's Germany forward Kevin Volland. With a large hint of sarcasm, Leipzig's 24-year-old captain shook hands with the referee before going off having also been booked in the opening exchanges for a challenge on Volland. But despite the numerical disadvantage, Leipzig claimed the three points through their Scandinavian combination. Swedish playmaker Emil Forsberg put in the cross -- his 16th assistant of the season -- for Denmark's Poulsen to slot home for the dramatic winner. Leipzig's victory was a big step towards direct Champions League qualification next season and they are seven points ahead of third-placed Hoffenheim, who crashed to a 2-1 defeat at Hamburg. Elsewhere, ex-Germany midfielder Aaron Hunt stole the show for Hamburg -- who are unbeaten at home in their last nine league games -- with both goals as Hoffenheim suffered only their third defeat this season. Wolfsburg, the 2009 German champions, remain on the brink of the relegation battle in 14th -- just one point from the bottom three -- after their 4-1 hammering away to Schalke, who are in mid-table. Schalke's Daniel Caligiuri scored against his former club while Germany's striker Mario Gomez scored his seventh goal in six games when he netted a late consolation penalty for Wolfsburg. Also down the bottom of the table, Mainz are only out of the relegation places on goal difference after their 1-0 defeat at Freiburg when ex-Bayern striker Nils Petersen scored the second-half winner. Borussia Moenchengladbach are challenging for a Europa League place next season after their 3-2 win at Cologne as captain Lars Stindl scored their winner nine minutes from time. Hosts Cologne twice came from behind to equalise, but Gladbach held on to leave them just a point from the top six, which carries a European place for 2017/18."
150,28/03/2017,16:51,Leipzig's Werner back training after injury 'catastrophe',"Germany striker Timo Werner returned to training with Bundesliga high-fliers RB Leipzig on Tuesday, less than a week after tearing a thigh muscle while making his debut for the world champions.","Werner, 21, hurt his left thigh in last Wednesday's 1-0 home win against England, which RB coach Ralph Hasenhuettl labelled a ""catastrophe"" as his club prepare to play three games in seven days. But Werner completed a 30-minute training run on Tuesday, then finished with some sprints, before signing autographs and posing for pictures with fans. Nevertheless, Hasenhuettl says Werner still needs time to recover as second-placed Leipzig prepare for Saturday's home match against bottom side Darmstadt following two successive league defeats. ""It was just a bit of work to activate the muscle, the fact he can do some light running is normal,"" said Hasenhuettl. ""We already know that it will probably take some time. We are just doing what we can."" With 14 league goals this season, Werner is Leipzig's top scorer and RB need the forward back soon with league games at Mainz on April 5 and then at home to Bayer Leverkusen three days later. Hasenhuettl did have some good news as Danish striker Yussuf Poulsen and Guinea midfielder Naby Keita both returned to training. The Darmstadt game is too soon for Poulsen, who injured his leg in a shock 3-0 defeat to Hamburg on February 11, but Keita should start after collapsing following the loss to Wolfsburg a fortnight ago. Leipzig are 13 points adrift of leaders Bayern Munich in Germany's top flight, but Hasenhuettl says the priority is getting back to winning ways after taking just seven points from their previous seven league games. ""We go into this week well recuperated, you can tell the players appreciated a few days off and used the few free days, they are much fresher in the head,"" said the RB coach."
151,18/03/2017,18:57,Leipzig collapse again with Bayern out of sight,Second-placed RB Leipzig crashed 3-0 at Werder Bremen on Saturday to suffer a shock second consecutive Bundesliga defeat which could see Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern Munich extend their runaway lead.,"The Bavarian giants started the weekend 10 points clear in their seemingly unstoppable march to a fifth straight German league title, which will become 13 points if they win at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday. Having begun their first Bundesliga season with a record 13-match unbeaten run, Leipzig's title challenge has collapsed following four defeats in their last seven games, taking a meagre seven points. ""We started well, but then you concede your first goal with their first shot,"" complained Leipzig's coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""We can't rely upon the momentum, that rub of luck, like we could in the first half of the season,"" he added. After losing 1-0 at home to Wolfsburg last weekend, Leipzig folded again in Bremen as Werder's Austria international Zlatko Junuzovic scored their first goal and set up their second. The dead-ball expert crashed home a curling, thunderbolt goal from outside the area on 34 minutes, then provided the free-kick which saw relegation-threatened Bremen double their lead. Junuzovic spotted Florian Grillitsch unmarked on the edge of the area and the attacking midfielder beat Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi on 59 minutes. Leipzig's humiliation was complete as their defence capitulated when Bremen's Fin Bartels led a counterattack and Florian Kainz tapped home on 90 minutes. All three Bremen goals were scored by Austrians -- an extra-bitter pill for RB, who are sponsored by Austria's energy drinks giant Red Bull. Leipzig are now just three points ahead of third-placed Borussia Dortmund after Dortmund's lacklustre 1-0 home win over Ingolstadt on Friday. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the league's top scorer, hit the winner. Anthony Modeste claimed a hat-trick as Cologne broke into the top six with a 4-2 win over Hertha Berlin. The Frenchman needed less than 30 minutes to claim his second hat-trick of the season after also netting three against Hamburg last October. Japan striker Yuya Osako gave Cologne an early lead, then set up Modeste's first goal on 35 minutes. His second followed two minutes later as the Frenchman showed some ice-cool finishing to make it 3-0 to the hosts. Hertha's top scorer Vedad Ibisevic pulled a goal back on 50 minutes when he converted a penalty after Cologne's goalkeeper Timo Horn fouled Berlin midfielder Niklas Stark in the area. Modeste wrapped up his hat-trick by finishing off a superb Cologne counter on 63 minutes, then Hertha's US international John Brooks headed home to make it 4-2 with 20 minutes left. Fresh from their mid-week Champions League exit at Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen suffered a 1-0 defeat at Hoffenheim thanks to Sandro Wagner's second-half goal for the hosts. Mario Gomez scored Wolfsburg's winner for the second week running when he slotted home on the stroke of half time to seal a 1-0 victory over bottom side Ingolstadt. Mid-table Augsburg were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Freiburg. Greek defender Konstantinos Stafylidis equalised for Augsburg in the first half after Freiburg's Florian Niederlechner had converted a penalty."
152,10/03/2017,01:52,German fans start to feel love for RB Leipzig,"The name 'RB Leipzig' remains a red rag for most hardcore German fans, but the controversial Bundesliga club is winning over mainstream supporters, and rightly so, says Michael Ballack.","RB Leipzig are second only to Bayern Munich in the German top flight and on course to qualify directly for the group stages of next season's Champions League. They are the only club from a city in former East Germany currently in the Bundesliga. Founded in 2009, when Red Bull took over a German Football League (DFL) licence, they are by far the youngest club in Germany's top flight. Backed by the energy drinks giants, RB Leipzig resisted the urge to buy big-name stars for their first season, snapping up young talent to nurture -- with impressive results. Playing eye-catching football, their young squad opened the club's first season at the top level with a Bundesliga-record 13-match unbeaten run. They picked off established names like Borussia Dortmund, Hamburg, Schalke and Wolfsburg in the process. But they have received anything but a warm welcome in Germany's top tier. Fans of rival clubs have shown given them the cold shoulder -- or indeed worse -- due to the perceived commercialism they are seen to represent. In August, a severed bull's head was thrown from the stands during a German Cup game in Dresden. In September, home fans staged a sit-down protest in front of the RB team bus which meant kick-off had to be delayed before their game at Cologne. And in February, hooligans in Dortmund attacked Leipzig supporters, including families with children, which led to the hosts being fined by the German Football Association (DFB). The animosity was intensified after Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke last year described Leipzig as a club ""performing"" to sell cans of drink. But the resentment and even pure hatred Leipzig have been shown by diehard 'Ultras' here is not reflected by mainstream football supporters, according to a new survey. ""It is acknowledged that refreshing football is being played in Leipzig and that their fans know how to behave,"" Gunter A. Pilz, an expert on German football fan culture, told SID, an AFP subsidiary. ""These factors can positively change the image that a billionaire from Austria came to create a club solely for advertising purposes."" In a survey of 5,950 fans from Bundesliga clubs across Germany by market research company LSC Management, more than three quarters said they feel RB Leipzig have enriched the Bundesliga. Some 94.5 percent believe the club is doing a good job. ""As a result, the opinions towards RB Leipzig are far more positive than what has been presented by a marginal group of so-called 'fans',"" concluded the survey. ""Even among the 'Ultras', there are quite a few who acknowledge this,"" added Pilz. ""There will, however, always be those who, in their fight against the commercialisation of RB, see them as the enemy."" Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl is pleased his squad are winning people over after regularly experiencing hostility from opposing fans at away games. ""I am delighted that we are able to win fans over through the way we play,"" he said. ""We're pleased that we are able to offer people a nice weekend experience."" Ex-Germany captain Ballack believes some of the resentment shown towards Leipzig is just jealousy at Red Bull's investment in the club and the city. ""I think it is an debate based on envy,"" Ballack, who hails from Chemnitz, near Leipzig, told magazine Sport Bild. ""Every city would see themselves as lucky if a sponsor like Red Bull, with someone like (co-founder billionaire) Dietrich Mateschitz, would come and provide economic support for the local club."" A separate survey of 1,000 fans ranked Leipzig as the seventh most popular club in Germany, another indication of the rising support RB are nurturing. Leipzig's fans promote a non-violent, family-friendly culture. As one banner fittingly read during their recent home defeat to Hamburg: ""Better to be obsessed with great sport (football), than by hate and envy."""
153,27/02/2017,16:14,Rising star Werner hoping for Germany call-up,"Rising star Timo Werner, currently the Bundesliga's best homegrown striker, is in line for a senior call-up for next month's internationals against England and Azerbaijan after praise from Germany coach Joachim Loew.","With 13 league goals for second-placed RB Leipzig, Werner -- who only turns 21 next Monday -- is the top-scoring German in the Bundesliga. Werner's clinical finishing has been a key part of Leipzig's rise this season since his arrival last year from relegated Stuttgart. Germany play a home friendly against England in Dortmund on March 22 and a 2018 World Cup qualifier away to Azerbaijan four days later in Baku. Last week Loew said Werner has the potential to develop into a world-class striker, suggesting he could hand Werner his first full cap. ""It's an honour for me when the national coach says that about me,"" Werner told Kicker having scored in Leipzig's 3-1 win over Cologne on Saturday. ""There is still a lot of work to do, but hearing something like that is of course an incentive."" Werner says he is not counting on a first call-up, ""but I hope for one. Every footballer wishes to be called up for the national team"". Germany play in the Confederations Cup this June in Russia and Loew says he wants to blood young talent ahead of the 2018 World Cup, when his team will defend their title. Werner will be involved with Germany's under-21s at the European junior championships in Poland -- unless the senior call-up comes to go to Russia. Werner is fourth in the scoring charts in Germany, behind Gabon's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of Borussia Dortmund, Poland's Robert Lewandowski at Bayern Munich and Cologne's French striker Anthony Modeste."
154,19/02/2017,17:38,Leipzig down Gladbach to trim Bayern's lead,RB Leipzig cut Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the Bundesliga to five points on Sunday as Emil Forsberg and Timo Werner netted in a 2-0 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach.,"Leipzig brushed off consecutive defeats with an impressive display at Borussia Park to trim the lead of Bayern, who had needed a 96th-minute Robert Lewandowski goal to draw 1-1 at Hertha Berlin on Saturday. Germany hopeful Werner, who is in contention for a call-up when die Mannschaft play England next month, and Forsberg were involved in both goals as RB returned to winning ways after defeats to Hamburg and Dortmund. Second-placed RB took the lead when Forsberg, who signed a new deal until 2022 earlier this month, slammed home Werner's pass on 31 minutes for the Swedish play-makers sixth league goal this season. Leipzig's Hungary goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi then saved Thorgan Hazard's penalty on the stroke of half-time sending Leipzig into the break at 1-0. Werner, who is just 20, doubled RB's tally with his 12th league goal of the season when he swept Forsberg's final pass past Gladbach's goalkeeper Yann Sommer on 55 minutes to put the visitors 2-0 up. However, Leipzig endured a nervous final 10 minutes as the hosts turned up the pressure. Gladbach pulled a goal back nine minutes from time when towering Danish centre-back Jannik Vestergaard beat Gulacsi with a header from a corner. Leipzig's Austria midfielder Marcel Sabitzer forced Sommer into a diving save in added time as RB chased a third goal. The result leaves Leipzig eight points clear of nearest rivals Borussia Dortmund, who beat Wolfsburg 3-0 at home on Saturday to go third, while Gladbach are tenth in the table."
155,09/02/2017,18:48,Dortmund apologise to Leipzig over fans' violence,Borussia Dortmund's CEO and president met their RB Leipzig counterparts on Thursday to apologise for last weekend's violent attacks by hooligans as police say they have started prosecuting the culprits.,"Dortmund police have reportedly started criminal proceedings in 32 cases after violent attacks broke out before last Saturday's German league match when hooligans set upon Leipzig fans, including women and children. During the attacks, four police officers and 10 visiting fans were injured, but the levels of hatred aimed at RB and their fans have shocked Germany's football community. Around 60 banners, many bearing insulting slogans aimed at Leipzig, were displayed by Dortmund fans inside the stadium. Dortmund captain Marcel Schmelzer condemned the violence in a video message to fans at their stadium before Wednesday's German Cup win over Hertha Berlin. Now CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke and president Reinhard Rauball have apologised in person. ""They stressed that no sporting or emotional rivalry justified either the verbal slurs and banners personally attacking Leipzig club officials or the violence towards RB Leipzig fans,"" read a joint statement from the clubs. ""Rauball and Watzke assured RB executives that Borussia Dortmund began investigating the incidents and identifying culprits immediately after the game and have co-operated very closely with police. ""They will, of course, keep RB updated of any developments and will bring together those responsible for the safety of spectators in order to establish how the situation could have escalated as it did. ""Representatives from both clubs agree that the goal must be to find a solution which ensures the events of last Saturday are not repeated in the future."" Dortmund can expect to be heavily punished when the German Football Association complete their investigation. Borussia are already on probation after fans rioted following their German Cup final defeat to Bayern Munich on penalties last May in Berlin and were fined 75,000 euros ($80,000). RB Leipzig were founded in 2009 by energy drinks giants Red Bull and reached the Bundesliga for the first time this season, but are widely unpopular because of their perceived commercialisation of German football. Watzke had been one of RB's most outspoken critics, having said Leipzig ""play football to perform for cans of drink"". Germany's coach Joachim Loew led the voices condemning Watzke's comments, which the World Cup winner said escalated the situation in Dortmund."
156,08/02/2017,17:11,Leipzig play-maker Forsberg extends deal,"RB Leipzig have given Swedish playmaker Emil Forsberg a contract extension until 2022, the Bundesliga high-flyers said on Wednesday.","Forsberg's impressive form this season includes five goals and nine assists at a club currently second in their debut season in Germany's top tier. The 25-year-old Sweden international has been given a one-year extension having signed a five-year deal in March 2016. ""Emil is an absolute performer and key figure at RB Leipzig. He has had an outstanding Bundesliga season and feels at ease with the club and the city,"" said Leipzig's director of sport Ralf Rangnick. ""The early extension of his contract confirms, once more, the way we want to keep working together in the next few years."" According to the English media, Liverpool had been considering a 20 million pound (23.4m euros, $25m) bid for Forsberg during January's transfer window. He joined Leipzig from Malmo in January 2015 for four million euros and helped the German club win promotion from the second division last season. ""I feel right at home here, I feel valued and I want to achieve a lot with RB Leipzig,"" said the left winger. ""The club is ambitious, has huge potential and I want to contribute my part to a successful future."""
157,05/02/2017,14:44,"Women, children attacked in Dortmund fan clash","Borussia Dortmund have threatened to ban any fans responsible for the violent attacks on RB Leipzig supporters, including children and women, that led to 28 arrests before a Bundesliga match.","""We can assure you: Borussia Dortmund will do its utmost to clear up our own fans' misconduct and sanction them as hard as possible,"" Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke and president Reinhard Rauball wrote in an open letter. ""To put it plainly, anyone who expresses his opinion not by arguments, but by raw violence and clumsy insults, can not -- and will not -- be allowed to be part of this club."" Dortmund can also expect to face tough sanctions with the German Football Association (DFB) set to investigate the violence. A crowd of 81,360 saw Dortmund's 1-0 home win over second-placed RB Leipzig on Saturday, but there were ugly scenes outside Borussia's Signal Iduna Park stadium before kick-off when some of the 8,500 visiting fans were targeted. ""In the build-up to the match, in the Strobelallee area (outside the ground), RB Leipzig supporters were bombarded with stones and cans from Borussia Dortmund fans,"" police said in a statement. RB Leipzig were unable to tell SID, an AFP subsidiary, how many of their fans were hurt, but German daily Bild claimed at least 10 visiting supporters were hospitalised. After a group of around 500 hardcore 'Ultra' Dortmund fans went on the rampage, police weighed in with pepper spray and batons. Arrests were made for offences including assault, grievous bodily harm, breach of the peace, insulting behaviour and resisting arrest. ""All in all, there was extreme aggressiveness and violence from Dortmund supporters, which was directed against any person recognised as a Leipzig fan, regardless of whether they were small children, women or families,"" added Dortmund police. ""In connection with this, four officers and a police dog were injured."" Leizpig, who are in their first season in Germany's top flight, slammed the attacks as ""unacceptable"". ""The attacks of Dortmund fans against opposing spectators and the police, plus insults and offences against women and children, are not acceptable and are embarrassing for the whole of football in Germany,"" said RB Leipzig in a statement. ""The fact that people were confronted with violence at a football match is unacceptable. ""We expect from Mr Watzke and Mr Rauball that these scenes, which were committed by several perpetrators, will be fully explained in the interests of the entire Bundesliga. ""We are glad that, according to our information, the injured RB Leipzig fans were able to return home."" RB Leipzig, who are backed by energy drinks giant Red Bull, are unpopular amongst German fans for the commercialism the club is perceived to represent, but Dortmund fans were particularly unwelcoming. There were several offensive banners in the Dortmund stadium aimed at RB, including ""Burnout Ralph, go hang yourself!"" after Leipzig's sports director Ralf Rangnick resigned from Schalke in 2011 with burnout."
158,04/02/2017,20:38,Aubameyang strike helps Bayern extend lead,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted his 17th Bundesliga goal of the season Saturday as Borussia Dortmund's 1-0 win over flu-hit RB Leipzig left Bayern Munich four points clear at the top.,"Aubameyang remains two goals ahead of Bayern hot-shot Robert Lewandowski in the race to be the German league's top scorer thanks to his superb first-half winner. The Gabon striker headed home after teenage French winger Ousmane Dembele ghosted past two RB defenders down the right wing and crossed for Aubameyang to head home unmarked on 35 minutes. Leipzig made Dortmund work for the win as Germany winger Marco Reus squandered two of Dortmund's four clear second-half chances. ""We won the game, that's what counts,"" a relieved Reus told Sky. ""We put up a good fight, it was a very aggressive game and the win is okay."" There was drama in added time as Leipzig sub Federico Palacios Martinez, making his Bundesliga debut, put the ball in Dortmund's net, but was flagged for a marginal offside. Leipzig struggled without top-scorer Timo Werner, midfielder Diego Demme and striker Marcel Sabitzer, who all have flu, while playmaker Emil Forsberg was suspended. The result lifted Dortmund from seventh to third, eight points behind Leipzig, who are four adrift of Bayern after Carlo Ancelotti's Bavarians had earlier drawn 1-1 with Schalke in Munich. Lewandowski's deft chip gave Bayern an early lead at the Allianz Arena before Schalke defender Naldo drilled home a free-kick on 13 minutes to level. Captain Philipp Lahm made his 500th appearance for Bayern, who had to work for their point. ""It was a tough game because Schalke played well,"" said Ancelotti. ""We started well, but were not so compact and our lines between the midfield and defence were too far apart from one another. ""We could only increase the pressure slightly at the end, but it was not enough."" Bayern made a bright start by taking the lead after nine minutes. Arturo Vidal threaded a pass to Lewandowski and the Poland striker lifted his shot over Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann. But Schalke kept their composure and equalised four minutes later when Naldo hammered a free-kick past Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. It completed the scoring, but both sides squandered clear first-half chances as Schalke striker Guido Burgstaller hit the crossbar, just like Lewandowski did at the other end. This was a tight, bruising encounter as Schalke fought hard for the point which left them 11th. ""Our plan would have worked out 100 percent if we'd won, but we can be very happy and can live with the point,"" said a delighted Schalke coach, Markus Weinzierl. Hoffenheim, the last team in a top European league to lose their unbeaten record last weekend, are fourth after their 4-0 hammering of Mainz at home. Midfield playmaker Sebastian Rudy's long pass was chested down by striker Mark Uth, who drilled home his shot with five minutes gone to put Hoffenheim 1-0 up. Midfielder Marco Terrazzino headed their second nine minutes from time with replacement striker Adam Szalai then scoring two goals off the bench against his old club. Hertha moved up to fifth with a 1-0 win at home to strugglers Ingolstadt as Japan midfielder Genki Haraguchi scored the winner after just a minute at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Cologne are sixth following their 1-0 win at Wolfsburg thanks to Anthony Modeste's second-half penalty, having been fouled by Wolves goalkeeper Diego Benaglio in the area. Borussia Moenchengladbach picked up their second straight win with a 3-0 victory at home to Freiburg courtesy of goals from captain Lars Stindl, striker Raffael and winger Patrick Herrmann to go tenth."

""I was impressed by the way we didn't lose our way after going behind,"" said RB coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""That was a big point against a very good opponent. We were very clever, very flexible, in the way we acted."" With Germany coach Joachim Loew watching, Hoffenheim took the lead at Leipzig's Red Bull Arena when midfielder Sebastian Rudy, who will join Bayern next season, started a copybook counter-attack from his own box. Hoffenheim moved the ball quickly until ex-Leicester striker Andrej Kramaric squared for midfielder Nadiem Amiri to tap-in on 18 minutes. Leipzig kept their composure and Guinea playmaker Naby Keita forced his way into the Hoffenheim area to lay the ball off as Timo Werner netted his 11th goal this season. Hoffenheim were reduced to 10 men for the last 30 minutes when Wagner was sent off for a clumsy tackle on Leipzig's Stefan Ilsanker. Leipzig grabbed the winner when Keita stepped on the gas and passed to Austria international Sabitzer, who fired home from 22 metres out. Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern stayed top with a hard-fought 2-1 win at battling Werder Bremen. Bayern went ahead when Franck Ribery's pass found Arjen Robben and the Dutch winger curled his shot inside the post from outside the area on 31 minutes. David Alaba doubled the lead with a sweetly-struck curling free-kick on the stroke of half-time. But Bremen, who had last scored against Bayern in April 2014, dug deep and put up a spirited display at their Weser Stadion. Germany striker Max Kruse pulled a goal back on 53 minutes and ex-Arsenal winger Serge Gnabry caused lots of problems down the right flank, but Bayern ultimately held on. ""That was an important win in a difficult game,"" said Bayern boss Ancelotti. ""After conceding the goal, we lost our shape and we were a bit anxious and made problems for ourselves, I have to admit that. ""But by the end, we had the game under control."" Cologne battered bottom side Darmstadt 6-1 at home as Japan striker Yuya Osako scored twice in the rout. Ex-Germany midfielder Torsten Frings, Darmstadt's new coach, cut a frustrated figure as Cologne raced into a 3-0 half-time lead through an own goal by Aytac Sulu, Osako and Anthony Modeste. Darmstadt's Sidney Sam netted a second-half penalty before Osako, ex-Dortmund midfielder Milos Jojic and Latvia striker Artjoms Rudnevs netted for Cologne. The result leaves Darmstadt seven points from safety while Cologne stay seventh. Relegation-threatened Ingolstadt remained 16th, but boosted their survival chances with a 3-1 win over Hamburg, who drop to second from bottom. Pascal Gross, Markus Suttner and Almog Cohen, who netted a penalty, scored for Ingolstadt before Hamburg's Japanese captain Gotoku Sakai pulled a goal back. Wolfsburg slid towards the relegation zone with a 2-1 home defeat against Augsburg, whose Dominik Kohr scored the winner after Halil Altintop equalised following Germany striker Mario Gomez's early goal for the Wolves. Eintracht Frankfurt went third on Friday with a 1-0 win at Schalke with their burly striker Alexander Meier, the league's top scorer in 2014-15, netting a first-half winner."

""The size of the city, the number of fans, sponsors and media interest means Leipzig has a big dimension. ""We can be more than just a regional team in the long term,"" he added, with RB -- who enjoyed a record start to their first Bundesliga season with 13 games unbeaten -- on course for next season's Champions League. They are three points behind Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern, but eight ahead of Hoffenheim in third. Hoffenheim earned a 1-1 draw at Bayern in November and are the only team in Germany's top flight still with an unbeaten record after seven wins and 10 draws this season. Their emergence has not gone unnoticed at Bayern, who snapped up burly centre-back Niklas Suele and defensive midfielder Sebastian Rudy for next season. Under Julian Nagelsmann, 29, the youngest coach in Bundesliga history, Hoffenheim are a tough team to crack. ""It's going to be a huge challenge,"" said Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""I expect to face a very, very brave (Hoffenheim) team, it will be a high-class -- and probably close -- game. ""They like to dominate possession and are cool on the ball."" Germany's in-form strikers, Leipzig's Timo Werner and Hoffenheim's Sandro Wagner, will go head-to-head. Both have hit 10 goals each this season and the hot-shots are hoping to fire their way into the plans of Germany coach Joachim Loew at Leipzig's Red Bull Arena. Leipzig will be missing Scottish winger Oliver Burke, who has a cold. Also Saturday Bayern are at strugglers Werder Bremen, who are just above the relegation places. Bayern -- for whom winger Franck Ribery will be hoping to be involved -- have won their last five games against Bremen, scoring 22 goals without reply. ""We know what's coming at us but we will not be overawed,"" said Bremen's coach Alexander Nouri. ""We will do well to believe in ourselves and we can influence the present, I don't look at the past."" Bremen's first-choice goalkeeper Jaroslav Drobny is suspended after being sent off in the 2-1 defeat to Borussia Dortmund for a kick on Germany winger Marco Reus, which also earned him a 10,000 euro fine. Reserve Felix Wiedwald, 26, who lost his place at the start of the season, is relishing his chance. Bremen will be able to include Germany winger Serge Gnabry, who has shaken off an upset stomach, but captain Clemens Fritz is doubtful with a sore throat. On Sunday the league's top-scorer, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has 17 goals in 15 league games, should feature for fourth-placed Borussia Dortmund at Mainz. The Gabon striker is back after his country's early Africa Cup of Nations exit. Dortmund defender Neven Subotic, who has joined Cologne on loan until the end of the season, is set to make his debut for his new club at bottom side Darmstadt.

161,19/01/2017,14:31,Can RB Leipzig break Bayern's domination?,The Bundesliga resumes this weekend after the winter break with one key question looming: can new boys RB Leipzig sustain their challenge to Bayern Munich's domination?,"Bayern claimed a record fourth straight Bundesliga title last season, in Pep Guardiola's final year, and under his successor Carlo Ancelotti they have reassumed their place at the top of the German league table. That is apart from three weeks, ending in mid-December, when RB Leipzig temporarily knocked them off their perch. Order was restored with Bayern returning top, albeit on goal difference, before RB Leizpig were then dealt a 3-0 hammering in Munich on December 21 with all goals coming in the first half. Bayern are at Freiburg on Friday in the first round of league games in 2017 and three points ahead of Leipzig, who have a tough restart. On Saturday, RB host fourth-placed Eintracht Frankfurt, then Hoffenheim -- the only team still unbeaten in Germany's top flight -- before playing Borussia Dortmund away. RB Leipzig's recent results in friendlies ahead of the second half of the season have been erratic. They were thrashed 5-1 by Ajax at their Portugal training camp, but then beat Rangers 4-0 in Leipzig last Sunday. ""We have improved from game to game, we are fresher and had a good dress rehearsal against Rangers,"" said coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""With the exception of Ajax, we have prepared well and I am convinced we will be in top condition against Frankfurt."" Sweden midfielder Emil Forsberg, suspended for their next three games, will be missing and playmaker Naby Keita is struggling to be fit for Frankfurt with a back injury. But Timo Werner, Leipzig's top scorer so far with nine goals, says their pre-Christmas hammering at Bayern has hardened the squad's resolve. ""Even on a good day, it would have been very hard to take some points, because Bayern were very good,"" the 20-year-old told Bild. ""Nevertheless, it has also made us more hungry, because it's shown us our limits, what is still missing, in order to really have some bite at the top."" Leipzig's goal, says Werner, is to work hard and keep learning to still be in the title race when they host Bayern on May 13 -- the penultimate weekend of the Bundesliga season. RB are currently on course for a Champions League place next season and, unlike Bayern, can focus solely on the Bundesliga, following their German Cup first-round exit last August. Leipzig have already punched above their weight this season. The club, backed by energy drinks giants Red Bull, was founded in 2009 and reached the Bundesliga with four promotions in seven seasons. They then set a league record by going unbeaten in 13 games at the start of their first season, fuelling belief they can end Bayern's reign. ""If a team can manage to do it this season, then it's Leipzig. Perhaps,"" Hertha coach Pal Dardai said cautiously. There are justified concerns RB Leipzig's young squad, whose average age is 24, does not have the experience to sustain their early pace. ""The second half of the season will be harder, because the clubs now know what to expect against Leipzig and they will adjust appropriately,"" forecasted Frankfurt's sports director Fredi Bobic. A warning to Leipzig comes in the shape of Wolfsburg, who were second to Bayern in 2014/15 and reached last season's Champions League's quarter-finals but are currently battling relegation. Hans-Joachim Watzke, CEO of sixth-placed Dortmund, who are nine points behind Leipzig, is respectful of what RB have achieved, but says their final placing in May is what counts. ""The only clubs who have been around the past few years are Bayern and us,"" Watzke told Die Welt. ""A year and a half ago, it was also predicted that Wolfsburg will constantly surpass us (Dortmund). ""I said at the time 'a swallow doesn't make a summer' and in Leipzig all the usual mechanisms are now in motion. ""Many of their players are now being contacted by other clubs and they will have to deal with setbacks."""
162,17/01/2017,03:00,Scottish teenager Burke at home with Leipzig,Scotland's Oliver Burke plans to fly his mum over to Germany to supply a taste of home cooking as he seeks to cement his future at RB Leipzig.,"A Scotland international at just 19, the pacy teenage winger was told to forget everything he had learned tactically at Nottingham Forest after RB signed him for a reported 15 million euros (£13 million, $16 million) last August. Leipzig, backed by energy drinks giants Red Bull, are enjoying a stellar first season in Germany's top flight after starting with a record 13-match unbeaten run. But a 3-0 pre-Christmas drubbing against league leaders Bayern Munich set them back and they resume on Saturday after the winter break with the first in a series of tough fixtures, against Eintracht Frankfurt. Since signing a five-year contract with Leipzig, second in the Bundesliga table just three points behind Bayern, Burke says he has been on a steep learning curve. And he said he plans to bring his mum over to help him make the transition. ""The thing I miss most is my mum's cooking -- I am not the best chef,"" he told AFP. ""I feel at my strongest when my family are here and I miss them when they're not. ""It's brilliant that I can get them over to live with me."" Burke says he immediately knew that he had made the right decision to leave English football. ""As soon as I stepped through the door here, I knew it was the perfect club for me,"" he said. ""The facilities are great and everyone has made me feel welcome."" But Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl said the teenager had to start from scratch tactically. Burke says he has been using his mobile phone to swot up on video analysis alongside German lessons three times a week. ""I'm learning every day on the pitch and watching all the video analysis I can, even on my phone,"" he said. ""I'm constantly looking where I can improve."" Hasenhuettl says the hard work is paying off and Burke's progress was on display as he scored on Sunday in RB's 4-0 thrashing of Glasgow Rangers in a friendly. ""We've worked hard with 'Oli' in the past few weeks, you could see that from the way he played (against Rangers),"" said Hasenhuettl. ""He is eager to learn and things are becoming second nature to him. ""He still has a few mistakes in his game to iron out, which could be dangerous for the opposition, but he is an option for us."" Burke said RB's stunning start to their first top-flight season did not catch him by surprise, even if he has had to settle for a bit-part role so far, starting just one of his 13 league games to date. ""To be honest, from speaking with the coaches, you could see where they want to be, so I wasn't surprised (at their strong start),"" he said. ""It all happened very quickly under my own eyes and we have adapted really well. ""Now we have to keep going and push on in the second half of the season."" Burke says inexperienced Leipzig, whose average age is just 24, must forget the defeat at Bayern as they bid to bridge the three-point gap. ""Bayern are obviously a very strong team and have a lot more experience than we do, but that game has gone and there's no point dwelling on it,"" said Burke. After hosting Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday -- Bayern are away to Freiburg on Friday -- Leipzig's tough start to 2017 continues with matches against Hoffenheim and Borussia Dortmund in back-to-back games with all three opponents in the Bundesliga's top six. ""We should take some confidence from the Rangers game. It's all about taking three points from each game now,"" said Burke, who took his chance against the Scottish team when he netted two minutes from the break in sub-zero temperatures. ""It was my first start at the Red Bull Arena,"" he added, ""so it was a great feeling to score against Rangers."" More opportunities may follow for the Scottish teenager because Sweden's Emil Forsberg was sent off against Bayern and is banned for the next three games."

The centre-back, who was being watched by Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United, could make his debut in Sunday's home friendly against Scottish giants Rangers. ""Dayot fits perfectly with our club in terms of his age, his potential and his playing style,"" said Leipzig's director of sport Ralph Rangnick. ""He has developed well at Red Bull Salzburg over the last year and a half and has attracted a lot of attention with his performances. ""We're pleased that despite numerous offers from international top clubs, he has decided to join us in order to make the next step in his career. ""We're convinced he will be able to strengthen our squad's quality straight away."" Upamecano was part of the France team which won the Under-17 European championships in 2015 and played 23 matches for Salzburg, who he joined from Valenciennes in July 2015. Leipzig are second only to Bayern Munich in Germany's top flight having started their first Bundesliga season with a record run of 13 matches unbeaten. Ralph Hasenhuettl's young guns were beaten 3-0 by Bayern in Munich just before the January winter break and are three points behind Carlo Ancelotti's Bavarian giants. Leipzig will play their first German league match of 2017 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt, who are fourth, on January 21."

""We played really well, the coach Carlo Ancelotti put his team together magnificently, we are happy,"" Rummenigge declared. He suggested anger had spurred the team to produce a superb performance as they found themselves 3-0 up by half-time at the Allianz Arena. ""When we're angry like that, our team is hard to stop. And over these past few days we were a little angry,"" he said. ""The players gave an important signal here. ""Our win wasn't only largely merited, it was a demonstration of class."" Rummenigge also had the grace to praise Leipzig, the club from the east of the country that was only formed seven years ago. ""Leipzig were thoroughly dominated but they are having a super season. The Bundesliga should rejoice in once again having a club from east Germany. ""They do things well, they aren't second by chance, we have to congratulate them."" Bayern's Thiago Alcantara and Xabi Alonso scored early goals before Leipzig winger Emil Forsberg was shown a straight red card, leaving the visitors to play an hour a man down. Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi then conceded the penalty which Lewandowski converted on 45 minutes to put Bayern 3-0 up at the break. Bayern go into the month-long winter break with Rummenigge revealing Dutch striker Arjen Robben would likely be remaining with the club for another season. ""He's staying at Bayern Munich, we want him to stay and I reckon we'll be able to announce possibly in January that a deal has been reached, I'm very optimistic about it."" The Bayern supremo said contract extensions already signed by Lewandowski, Franck Ribery, and now probably Robben delivered ""a signal especially in the direction of England that we don't let players who are important to us to leave""."

It left the visitors to play an hour on Wednesday at Munich's Allianz Arena a man down in the top-of-the-table clash. Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi then compounded his team's problems by fouling Douglas Costa to concede a penalty which Robert Lewandowski converted on 45 minutes to make it 3-0. The result left Munich three points clear of their battered opponents at the top of the German league table heading into the winter break. ""That was a lesson, it was a top show from Bayern,"" admitted Leipzig coach Hasenhuettl. ""Our system only works when everyone is in sync and we had a few players who weren't 100 percent fit. ""You can't do much to defend against Bayern when they play like that."" Any chance Leipzig had of clawing their way back from 2-0 down was ended by Forsberg's dreadful tackle on Philipp Lahm when the Sweden international trod on the Bayern captain's Achilles tendon. ""We don't need to talk about the red card by Emil,"" added the Leipzig boss. ""We all make mistakes, so I'm not going to demonise him, but I'm still proud of how the team has done so far."" Prior to the Munich showdown, Leipzig had kept Bayern off top spot for three weeks at the start of the month and the two teams have been in a neck-and-neck battle since. But Ancelotti's side dominated and shut Leipzig out after the break as they used their 75 percent possesssion to dish out a masterclass to their young rivals, who are in their first German league season. ""We were very aggressive and quickly established control,"" said Bayern's Italian coach. ""Everything was in tune - the pace and the gameplay, which gives us self-confidence, but we must still improve."" Lahm said Bayern had wanted to prove a point to their Bundesliga rivals. ""All of Germany had an eye on this game and was looking forward to it,"" said the Bayern captain. ""It was a duel between two teams who wanted to prove themselves. ""We wanted to throw down a marker before the winter break, which we managed to achieve, especially in the first half."" Leipzig captain Willi Orban admitted his side had simply been outplayed. ""We had made a lot of plans, but it was not the game that we had wanted,"" said the centre-back. ""Bayern were just better today and really deserved it."""

Rangnick, in recounting the tale, replied that it was not something he had given consideration to when planning his garden. Nevertheless, Mateschitz landed his private helicopter a few hours later at a sports field adjacent to Rangnick's house to continue the discussion. Over the course of the next few hours -- and countless cups of coffee -- Rangnick explained what he would do if he was in charge of RB Leipzig, who were down in Germany's fourth division at the time. As he was later to do, Rangnick outlined how he would get rid of any players the wrong side of 30 and sign eager, young talent to nurture. By the time the coffee went cold, he had the job and Mateschitz flew home. Four promotions in the seven years since they were founded in 2009 saw RB Leipzig join Germany's top flight this season and got off to a flying start with a record 13-match unbeaten run. The team has never lost when Mateschitz was in the stadium. He made a rare appearance for Saturday's impressive 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin and will also be at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday, where his team will hope to make it five wins from five with Mateschitz in attendance.

In 2014, when RB had just won promotion to the second division, Mateschitz predicted they would soon be in the top flight -- now, the Champions League is beckoning.

168,20/12/2016,12:02,'Outsiders' Leipzig pile pressure on leaders Bayern,RB Leipzig are playing on their role as underdogs to score some psychological points ahead of Wednesday's crunch Bundesliga clash against Bayern Munich.,"""If we win, it would be a fairly big surprise. Anything other than a Bayern win would be a disappointment from a Munich point of view,"" Ralf Rangnick, Leipzig's sports director, told SID, an AFP subsidiary, on Tuesday. ""For us, this is a bonus game, which we go into as outsiders. ""We want to build on our good performances and perhaps get a scoop."" Bayern host Leipzig at the Allianz Arena with the sides neck and neck on 36 points with the champions topping the table on goal difference. Leipzig, only founded in 2009, had a stellar 2016, gaining second division promotion in May and going a record 13-matches unbeaten at the start of their first season in Germany's top flight. ""From a sporting perspective, it was a dream year,"" said Rangnick. ""Everyone in Germany, and also us in Leipzig, are of course surprised by this fantastic first half of the season."" Leipzig's success has come with a squad, with an average of 23, who were mostly unheard of before this season. They have nothing to lose in the club's first league match against star-studded Bayern, which has 15 internationals in their squad and seven World Cup winners from Spain and Germany. ""Any team which is forced onto the defensive by Bayern don't have a chance,"" said Rangnick. ""Our style of play is characterised by a high level of willingness to run, aggression and passion. ""But we have never played against a team whose individual players have such quality."" Bayern have a habit of signing up top talent from their rivals and club president Uli Hoeness has already suggested Leipzig's coach Ralph Hassenhuettl could be a future Munich manager, to follow on from Spain's Pep Guardiola and current incumbent Carlo Ancelotti from Italy. ""If we should ever look for a (native) German-speaking coach, he certainly is one of the three candidates to think about,"" Bayern president Uli Hoeness told Bild. ""It's going to be a while before Bayern get a German coach,"" Austrian-born Hassenhuettl observed drily. On average, Leipzig have run four kilometres (2.5miles) more than their opponents per league game and Hassenhuettl intends to make Bayern run for their lives. ""We want to make sure that Bayern have to do something and also that they have to cover 110 kilometres,"" he said, referring to the average distance covered in a Bundesliga game. Rangnick acknowledges that while prestige and three points are at stake, the showdown will have little bearing on who lifts the title next May. The 58-year-old has been here before. He was Hoffenheim coach in 2008/09 when the club were top midway through their first Bundesliga season, only to eventually finish seventh. ""If the example of Hoffenheim tells us something, it's that the title 'Autumn champions' (the name given to the table leaders in December) is worth practically nothing,"" said Rangnick. He also doubts Leipzig will make any new signings in the January transfer window. ""There is no reason to change anything,"" he said. ""From our side, it is not planned that we'll sign any new players in the winter break."""
169,19/12/2016,02:15,Bayern under pressure for 'electric' showdown,"Bayern Munich face an acid test of their status as Bundesliga leaders in Wednesday's crunch showdown when they host second-placed RB Leipzig, who know they have nothing to lose.","The Bavarian giants have won the Bundesliga title at a canter in each of the last four seasons, but Leipzig, who were only founded in 2009, have torn up the form book in their first season in Germany's top flight. Just like Bayern, they have won 11 of their 15 league games, with three wins and a single defeat. Both clubs have 36 points, but Munich are top on goal difference. A shock 1-0 defeat to Ingolstadt ten days ago is the only blot on Leipzig's record having so far beaten the likes of Dortmund, Leverkusen, Schalke and now Hertha Berlin, following Saturday's 2-0 home win. ""Quick, compact and greedy -- they are the best opponent we have faced so far,"" was Hertha coach Pal Dardai's appraisal of Leipzig, who had gone a record 13 matches unbeaten at the start of their debut Bundesliga season. The Bundesliga breaks for winter after this round of mid-week matches and the Allianz Arena showdown is the standout tie. Having led for three weeks until early December, Leipzig knocked Bayern off the summit for 24 hours after their impressive win over Hertha before Munich's 1-0 victory at bottom side Darmstadt put them top again on Sunday. ""We're proud to have a game on Wednesday against Bayern Munich which will electrify the whole of Germany and will certainly inspire across the borders,"" said Leipzig's Austrian coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. Last month, Bayern's president Uli Hoeness dubbed Leipzig their ""second enemy"" in Germany alongside Borussia Dortmund before withdrawing the comment, but the Bavarians clearly feel threatened by Leipzig. RB are one of the few German clubs who have deep pockets like Bayern with the financial weight of Austrian drinks giants Red Bull behind them. Their team has an average age of just over 23 and there is little fear ahead of their historic first Bundesliga match against Bayern. ""We want to, we can, but we don't have to,"" said defender Stefan Ilsanker when asked about the pressure to win in Munich. Leipzig are set to be without injured defensive midfielder Naby Keita (thigh) and defender Marcel Halstenberg (hip), but Leipzig's young guns are relishing the test of their mettle. ""The anticipation is huge. We'll put everything into it and I can hardly wait,"" said centre-back Willi Orban, who scored against Hertha. Centre-backs Orban and Ilsanker will be tasked with containing Bayern's Thomas Mueller and Robert Lewandowski, while Leipzig's top scorer Timo Werner, who has nine league goals, will face Germany's Mats Hummels. Bayern will be missing his centre-back partner Jerome Boateng, who needs a shoulder operation. Head coach Carlo Ancelotti says he already knows his line-up and it's more than likely Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery will start on the flanks. While Leipzig impressed against Hertha, Bayern were lacklustre in Sunday's 1-0 win at Darmstadt which was settled by a superb goal from Douglas Costa. ""We took three very important points, without which it would have been difficult on Wednesday against RB Leipzig,"" said Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. ""But we can't be satisfied with the performance -- that wasn't FC Bayern today and Wednesday will be a duel between equals."" An unthinkable defeat would mean Bayern go into the winter break with the German media inevitably asking all sorts of uncomfortable questions of Ancelotti's star-studded squad. ""The respect is huge and it's going to be a demanding test. We will have to put in a top performance, a standard one isn't going to be good enough against a team like that,"" said Hummels.

170,18/12/2016,01:56,Leipzig's Orban relishing Bayern showdown,RB Leipzig's goal-scorer Willi Orban is relishing the prospect of Wednesday's Bundesliga showdown and the chance to stop hosts Bayern Munich topping the German league table at Christmas.,"Leipzig knocked Bayern, who are at bottom side Darmstadt on Sunday, off the top of the German league on Saturday with a 2-0 win over fourth-placed Hertha Berlin. Goals either side of half-time by striker Timo Werner and burly centre-back Orban sealed the win at Leipzig's sold-out Red Bull Arena to leave RB three points clear. Bayern can regain top spot with three points at Darmstadt, because of their superior goal difference. Regardless of the Darmstadt result, Wednesday's clash at Munich's Allianz Arena between Bayern and Leipzig will see Germany's top two teams meet in the final round of matches before the January winter break. Either centre-back Orban, 24, or midfielder Dominik Kaiser, 28, will lead RB Leipzig out for the first time in the club's brief seven-year history against Bayern's star-studded squad. ""We want to give it everything we have, the anticipation is already very high, because it's an absolute highlight,"" said Orban, who captained Leipzig against Hertha with Kaiser on the bench. ""Bayern are, of course, a top team, and we'll need a top performance in every position if we want to take something from there. 100 percent. ""We want to show how far we have come and prove that we can put in our best performance when it matters. Then we'll see if that's enough. ""We need to recover well first, but I can hardly wait for the game."" Leipzig responded to last weekend's shock 1-0 defeat at Ingolstadt with a polished display as Orban's powerful header on 62 minutes put the game beyond Hertha. ""It was a nice moment for me, to be able to help the team, because at 2-0 it pushed us forward,"" he said. ""It was the sort of performance we wanted after a good week of training. ""We were very good, very focused, carried out the match plan well and deserved the win against one of the top teams in the league."" Orban admitted he was relieved to have come through the 90 minutes without a yellow card. A fifth booking this season, against Hertha, would have seen him suspended to Wednesday's crunch clash. ""I wasn't thinking about it during the game, but I sure was before, so I'm glad I didn't get a booking, because it would have been bitter if I had missed the Bayern game,"" he said. RB Leipzig were only founded in 2009 when Austrian drinks giants Red Bull took over a German Football League (DFL) licence. Red Bull's billionaire founder Dietrich Mateschitz, 72, made a rare appearance at the Hertha game and will be in Munich. RB Leipzig have never lost when he has attended a match. ""He's coming too, hopefully it's a good sign,"" said Orban with one eye already on Munich."
171,13/12/2016,18:09,Stunned RB Leipzig target return to top in Germany,RB Leipzig are targeting a quick return to the top of the Bundesliga table as they prepare to take on main rivals Hertha Berlin and Bayern Munich in quick succession.,"Having spent three weeks leading the German league, new boys RB Leipzig, backed by Austrian drinks giants Red Bull, were beaten 1-0 by strugglers Ingolstadt last weekend which saw Bayern cut the three point gap to go top again on goal difference. The shock defeat broke Leipzig's eight-match winning streak and ended their record run of 13 matches unbeaten for a club at the start of their debut Bundesliga season. Now second-placed RB face the teams either side of them in the table during the space of five days. They host third-placed neighbours Hertha Berlin on Saturday at the Red Bull Arena, then have a daunting trip to Bayern's Allianz Arena next Wednesday before the start of the Bundesliga's winter break. ""Our senses have been sharpened, the pressure is gone, and now we have the goal to start a new run, although our next few games won't be easy,"" said Leipzig's coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. After the Hertha and Bayern tests, his side face a tough run at the start of 2017. They resume after the four-week winter break in January by hosting Eintracht Frankfurt (currently 5th), then unbeaten Hoffenheim (4th) before playing Borussia Dortmund (6th) away to begin the new year with a bang. Hasenhuettl admits the next five league games will be an acid test for his young team, which has an average age of just over 23. ""It is the phase in which we will see how good we really are and where we can place ourselves,"" said the Austrian. Leipzig are the only club from former East Germany in the top tier and neighbours Hertha will travel south also looking for a win after their shock 1-0 defeat at home to Werder Bremen last weekend. ""They will also be up for it and will do everything they can to make a success of it,"" said Hasenhuettl, with Hertha currently six points behind Leipzig."

But Saturday's shock 1-0 defeat at Ingolstadt, who had been bottom before kick-off, allowed Bayern to cut the three-point gap with a 5-0 win at home to Wolfsburg and go top of the table on goal difference. Hasenhuettl, 49, who has been tipped as a possible replacement for Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, endured a horror return to Ingolstadt, who he left in May. Brazilian defender Roger scored Ingolstadt's first-half winner with a header from a set-piece. ""We didn't play well in the first half. Defeats always hurt, it doesn't matter against who,"" said Hasenhuettl, whose side battered the Ingolstadt goal with 13 shots, to the hosts four, but could not score. ""We allowed the opponent to force their own game on us, we had little influence and didn't show enough courage. ""We were better after the break, but we couldn't make our 300 percent (more shots) count. The ball didn't want to go in. ""This is a set back, but we can handle it."" This was only Ingolstadt's second win of the season. The Bavarian strugglers had Australia striker Mathew Leckie sent off on 94 minutes for two yellow cards in quick succession, but his team held on and the win took them off bottom leaving Darmstadt, who lost 1-0 at Freiburg, last. ""The team did exceptionally well, they followed the plan exceptionally well,"" said coach Maik Walpurgis, who used his replacement goalkeeper for the last 30 minutes after injury to Danish shot-stopper Martin Hansen. ""We had two good goalkeepers and certainly the necessary luck in the second half."" Both Bayern and Leipzig have 33 points with Germany's top two clubs set to meet in Munich on December 21 in a pre-Christmas showdown. Both clubs are six points ahead of nearest rivals Hertha Berlin, who suffered a shock 1-0 home defeat to Werder Bremen after Germany striker Max Kruse scored the first-half winner. Bayern had no such problems as they hammered strugglers Wolfsburg with Robert Lewandowski netting twice and Thomas Mueller ending his goal drought in the Bundesliga having gone 999 minutes without scoring. The victory came without both first-choice centre-backs as Jerome Boateng was on the bench with a shoulder injury and Mats Hummels was ill. ""Our performance was good,"" said Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti, who again used a 4-2-3-1 formation having used a 4-3-3 in Tuesday's 1-0 Champions League win at home to Atletico Madrid. ""We had good control after it was 1-0, we can play both systems, but the team feels better with the 4-2-3-1. ""I am very happy for Thomas. The goal is good for him, he always does a good job and works hard for the team."" To further help Bayern's cause, they are the only side in the top seven to have picked up three points this weekend. Defeat leaves the 2015 German Cup winners Wolfsburg on the verge of the bottom three. ""Bayern deserved the win,"" admitted Wolfsburg's coach Valerien Ismael, who again left out want-away German forward Julian Draxler. ""When you travel to Munich, you need to be strong in your head and have a lot of self-confidence in your luggage. ""They showed their domination and at the moment Bayern Munich is not our benchmark."" It was a humbling return to the Allianz Arena for Wolfsburg's ex-Bayern forward Mario Gomez. ""It's brutal. It's depressing when things really get going (for Bayern) and after that it's obviously very difficult,"" said the Germany striker,"
173,10/12/2016,17:39,Bayern regain top spot as Leipzig lose unbeaten record,Robert Lewandowski netted twice as Bayern Munich returned to the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 5-0 win over Wolfsburg after RB Leipzig lost their unbeaten record.,"Leipzig's shock 1-0 defeat at bottom side Ingolstadt, who finished with ten men, ended their three-week stint as leaders as Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern cut the three-point gap and regained top spot on goal difference with both teams on 33 points. Second-placed RB had their 13-match unbeaten run ended -- a record for a club at the start of their first Bundesliga season -- as coach Ralph Hasenhuettl endured a horror return to Ingolstadt, who he left after last season. Ingolstadt's Australia striker Mathew Leckie was sent off for two yellow cards in quick succession in the tense final stages. But his team held on for the win which took them off the bottom leaving Darmstadt, who lost 1-0 at Freiburg, now last. Bayern host Leipzig on December 21 at Munich's Allianz Arena, where the hosts romped to a heavy win over Wolfsburg. The 2015 German Cup winners have fallen from grace and defeat leaves Wolfsburg 15th, only clear of the relegation zone on goal difference. Head coach Valerien Ismael, who took over after Dieter Hecking was sacked in October, left Germany's attacking midfielder Julian Draxler out of the squad. The 23-year-old cost 35 million euros ($37.3m) from Schalke in August 2015 and Wolfsburg say they are open to sell him in January's winter break. Bayern started with Jerome Boateng on the bench with a shoulder injury and his centre-back partner Mats Hummels was missing with gastroenteritis. Arjen Robben opened the scoring by cutting in from the right and curling his superb shot around Wolfsburg's goalkeeper Diego Benaglio on 18 minutes. Lewandowski netted five goals in a record nine minutes in the same fixture in September 2015 and the Poland hot-shot needed just 21 minutes to also get on the scoresheet. To compound Wolfsburg's problems, defender Marcel Schaefer went off with a knee injury after 23 minutes as it finished 2-0 at the break. Lewandowski added his second on 58 minutes, Mueller grabbed his first league goal of the season by firing home Robben's pass on 76 minutes then Brazil winger Douglas Costa added Bayern's fifth just before the whistle. Fresh from their 2-2 Champions League draw at Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund needed a 90th-minute Marco Reus goal to rescue their 1-1 draw at ten-man Cologne. Cologne took the lead when Germany defender Jonas Hector fired in a long-range free-kick and Artjoms Rudnevs slipped his marker, heading past Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller on 28 minutes. But Reus rescued a point when he cooly slotted Adrian Ramos' cross for a point which kept Dortmund sixth as Cologne had Salih Ozcan sent off late on for a second yellow. Hamburg stay in the bottom three despite their 1-0 home win over Augsburg as both sides finished with ten men. The hosts took the lead when Nicolai Mueller hit the post and Serbia international Filip Kostic converted the rebound on 68 minutes. Hamburg had Lewis Holtby sent off just before the break for lashing out after Augsburg's midfielder Dominik Kohr's rough tackle. But Kohr was also shown a red when he earned his second yellow soon after. On Friday, Hoffenheim were held to a goalless draw at Eintracht Frankfurt but are now the only unbeaten team in Germany's top flight."
174,09/12/2016,01:45,Top meets bottom as Leipzig head to Ingolstadt,"Bottom faces top on Saturday when basement dwellers Ingolstadt host unbeaten Bundesliga leaders RB Leipzig, who are chasing an eight straight win to keep Bayern Munich off the top.","RB Leipzig's coach Ralph Hassenhuettl returns to Ingolstadt, who he left in May having taken them from the bottom of the second division to Germany's top flight in his three seasons. Ingolstadt, who have slipped down to 18th in the tablea fter their 2-1 defeat at Werder Bremen, have yet to win a match at home this season. Leipzig, meanwhile, have the best away record in the Bundesligawith five wins and two draws. RB are the surprise package this season and have now been top of the table since Bayern's 1-0 defeat at Borussia Dortmund a fortnight ago. Timo Werner, the club's top scorer with eight goals, has been in the spotlight for the wrong reasons this week. After being awarded a penalty just 19 seconds into last Saturday's 2-1 win at home to Schalke, replays showed Werner dived. Second-placed Bayern Munich host VfL Wolfsburg on Saturday in a repeat of the match which broke four Bundesliga records last season when Robert Lewandowski scored five goals in nine minutes. Bayern's Germany forward Thomas Mueller is without a Bundesliga goal is his 12 games so far, while Lewandowski has been regularly hitting the net. The Poland hot-shot netted twice in last Friday's 3-1 win at Mainz before drilling in the winning goal in Tuesday's 1-0 home win against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League. Wolfsburg are struggling with just two wins this season to leave them just two points from the relegation zone and their Germany forwards Julian Draxler and Mario Gomez have failed to gel. They have picked up just four league points since Valerien Ismael replaced Dieter Hecking as head coach in October. Cologne host a Borussia Dortmund side buoyed by their 4-1 romp at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach last Saturday and Wednesday's 2-2 draw at Real Madrid. Both Cologne and Dortmund are just outside the Bundesliga's top five. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice to leave him as the league's top scorer with 15 goals so far, while Cologne crashed to a 4-0 drubbing at Hoffenheim last weekend. The match pits the league's top strikers against each other with Anthony Modeste having hit 12 goals in 13 league games. Both Aubameyang and Marco Reus are in form as the pair both scored at Real. Andre Schubert is in danger of becoming the sixth Bundesliga coach fired this season and his Borussia Moenchengladbach badly need a win at Mainz on Sunday. Gladbach are winless in their last eight games following Tuesday's 4-0 trashing at Barcelona. Schubert's side are currently 13th, five points from the relegation places, and their last league win was in late September. Director of sport Max Eberl says Gladbach's next three Bundesliga games, against bottom-half clubs Mainz, Augsburg and Wolfsburg are crucial. Fourth-placed Hoffenheim, who along with Leipzig are the league's only unbeaten teams, are at Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday with both sides on 25 points. Under Julian Nagelsmann, the youngest coach in Bundesliga history at 29, are one of the league's surprise packages this season. Frankfurt, fifth, are gaining momentum and are unbeaten in their last eight games, triggered by a 2-2 draw at home to Bayern and earned a 2-1 win over Dortmund a fortnight ago.

175,07/12/2016,02:30,"Messi or Ronaldo? No thanks, says Leipzig boss","Neither Lionel Messi nor Cristiano Ronaldo would be considered fresh enough at youthful Bundesliga leaders RB Leipzig, says sports director Ralf Rangnick.","Founded in 2009, Leipzig are bankrolled by energy drinks giants Red Bull and are currently top of the Bundesliga after four promotions in seven years. Impressively, they have done it with a squad without superstars and an average age of 23. Eight of the players who started Saturday's 2-1 win over Schalke played for RB in the second division last season. Rangnick, 58, became sports director in 2012 when Leipzig was in the fourth division. He showed the door to those the wrong side of 30 signing youngsters on their first or second contracts, including current club captain Dominik Kaiser. And Rangnick shakes his head when asked if he would like to sign Real Madrid's Ronaldo, 31, or Barcelona's Messi, 29. ""It would be absurd to think that it could work with them here,"" said Rangnick with a grin. ""They are both too old and too expensive."" His most recent recruits illustrate the point with Scotland winger Oliver Burke, 19, signed from Nottingham Forest, Guinea midfielder Naby Keita, 21, and Brazilian defender Bernardo, 21, both from sister club RB Salzburg. ""We have the youngest team -- and most unexperienced -- in the league,"" he said. Rangnick admits the success of RB Leipzig -- the only club from former East Germany currently in the Bundesliga -- has caught him by surprise. ""I don't know if it's a revolution, but it's unusual that a team, who was in the fourth division three-and-a-half years ago is now on 33 points after 13 games,"" he said. ""Nobody expected this."" Leipzig are unpopular with some German fans, who say the team only exists to sell Red Bull's drinks. Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke described RB Leipzig as 'performing cans', words he may regret now as Dortmund lost 1-0 at Leipzig's Red Bull Arena in September. ""If that was true, then 11 'cans' beat 11 'bottles', which in German (slang) means 'someone who played poorly' - I say that with a twinkle in my eye,"" said Rangnick with a grin."" Rangnick has been here before. He was coach of Hoffenheim in 2008/09, who are bankrolled by a German software billionaire, and were also unpopular until they beat Bayern to first in the league table by Christmas, only to eventually finish seventh. ""Whenever a new club comes along, fans of rival teams see them as an opponent and an enemy. ""It was the same with Hoffenheim, we were disliked in the second division, but really disliked when we went up to the Bundesliga. ""Then we played Bayern and we were top, and everyone was supporting us. ""There are people, not just in Leipzig, who think we deserve what is happening to us right now. ""Neutrals will say we deserve what we have with such young players."" Rangnick is seen as one of Germany's most talented managers. He was sounded out about becoming England manager when Roy Hodgson stood down after Euro 2016 before Sam Allardyce's ill-fated 67-day reign. ""I still think it was an honour that they asked a German coach if I was available,"" he said. ""But even if they had offered it to me, I wouldn't have stopped working for Reb Bull completely. ""We are building our own tradition and writing our own story right now."" Rangnick rejects the notion that Leipzig are Germany's version of Leicester City, last season's surprise Premier League winners, ""we share the first three letters in our names, but little else"". ""In a normal season, Bayern will win the title, but maybe this isn't a normal season. ""Our match against them (December 21) won't be decisive, but it will be exciting. ""Last season, we were the favourites in each (second division) game. This season we have nothing to lose."""
176,03/12/2016,20:35,"RB Leipzig knock Bayern off top, extend record",RB Leipzig again knocked Bayern Munich from top spot in the Bundesliga table on Saturday as their 2-1 win at home to Schalke 04 left them three points clear.,"Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern had regained the lead with a 3-1 win at Mainz on Friday night, but Leipzig replaced them less than 24 hours later. Bayern and Leipzig are set to meet at Munich's Allianz Arena on December 21 in a mouth-watering pre-Christmas showdown. A second-half own-goal from Schalke's Bosnia international Sead Kolasinac sealed Leipzig's win, their 10 league victory, extending their record unbeaten run to 13 matches in their first Bundesliga season. Leipzig took an early lead in controversial fashion as Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann conceded a penalty with just 19 seconds gone when the referee judged he had made contact with RB's top scorer Timo Werner. Replays showed the Leipzig forward dived, but the 20-year-old Werner drilled in his eighth league goal of the season. Faehrmann was booked to add insult to injury for Schalke Schalke regained their composure and drew level when Bosnia winger Kolasinac drilled home a cross on 32 minutes. But the 23-year-old, who has been linked to Liverpool, turned the ball into his own net two minutes into the second half following a free-kick from Leipzig's Emil Forsberg. Faehrmann tipped the ball onto the bar to deny a header from Leipzig defender Marcel Halstenberg 20 minutes from the end and with time running out Schalke's Brazil centre-back Naldo cleared off the line from Forsberg. This was Schalke's first defeat in 13 games, dating back to the end of September, to leave them eighth. Earlier, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice as Borussia Dortmund prepared for their Champions League clash at Real Madrid with a 4-1 rout of Borussia Moenchengladbach. With both sides already into the last 16, the victor at Real's Bernabeu on Wednesday will be confirmed as Group F winners and fifth-placed Dortmund warmed-up with an emphatic win over Moenchengladbach at Signal Iduna Park. Fleet-footed Marco Reus weighed in with three assists as Dortmund fought back after Gladbach took the lead with six minutes gone when Brazilian forward Raffael slotted home from the edge of the area. Lukasz Piszczek headed home and Ousmane Dembele also netted in the second half to seeal an emphatic win. Hertha Berlin held onto third with a 3-2 comeback victory at 10-man Wolfsburg as Salomon Kalou converted the winning penalty in the 91st minute. Wolfsburg coach Valerien Ismael dropped Germany international Julian Draxler from his starting line-up and his side responded with two goals in the opening 20 minutes. Ex-Real Madrid striker Borja Mayoral gave Wolfsburg a 12th-minute lead before Marvin Plattenhardt put Hertha level by expertly drilling his free-kick over the wall. Wolfsburg went back in front when midfielder Paul Seguin, who was later sent off for a second booking five minutes from time, slammed his shot home on 18 minutes. Alexander Esswein levelled for Hertha 20 minutes from time before Daniel Caligiuri fouled Plattenhardt to concede the penalty Kalou converted for the winner. Hoffenheim, who along with RB Leipzig are the only unbeaten teams in the Bundesliga, are fourth after romping to a 4-0 win at home to Cologne. Ex-Bayern striker Sandro Wagner scored twice for Hoffenheim while Jeremy Toljan and Mark Uth also got on the scoresheet. Bayer Leverkusen, who host Group E winners Monaco on Wednesday with both teams through to the knock-out stages of the Champions League, drew 1-1 at home to Freiburg. Janik Haberer gave Freiburg a shock first-half lead before Hakan Calhanoglu levelled after the break. Leverkusen's Javier Hernandez failed to convert a late penalty as the Mexico striker fired his spot-kick at the feet of Freiburg goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow. Werder Bremen climbed out of the bottom three with a 2-1 win at home to Ingolstadt, who are second from bottom, thanks to Fin Bartels' second-half winner."
177,23/11/2016,21:26,Leipzig out to defend top spot from Bayern,RB Leipzig are determined to defend their hard-earned status as the new Bundesliga leaders with a win at Freiburg on Friday to pile the pressure on faltering Bayern Munich.,"Leipzig, sponsored by Austrian energy drinks giant Red Bull, went top last Friday with a 3-2 win at Bayer Leverkusen, setting a new Bundesliga record in the process. No club has gone unbeaten in their first 11 German league games after promotion. Fifth-placed Hoffenheim are the only other unbeaten team in Germany's top flight. Leipzig are three points clear of second-placed Bayern, who lost 1-0 at Borussia Dortmund last Saturday and suffered a 3-2 defeat at Rostov on Wednesday in the Champions League. RB can add extra pressure by going six points clear at Freiburg. Bayern host Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday at Munich's Allianz Arena looking to bounce back from straight defeats. Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge says Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern are ""hunting"" Leipzig -- music to the ears of RB coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""From a sporting perspective we have stirred up the wasps nest, so of course there is a bit of buzzing,"" quipped the Leipzig boss. Bayern are set to host Leipzig on December 21 in what is shaping up to be a pre-Christmas showdown. One big factor in Leipzig's favour this season is that, having exited the German Cup in the first round, they are only involved in the Bundesliga. In contrast, Bayern are busy with the Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup. Freiburg, who were promoted alongside RB Leipzig last season, are no pushovers at their Schwarzwald Stadium, winning four of their five home games this season. ""Both teams run a lot and have good systems in place,"" said Hasenhuettl. ""Freiburg were second-division champions last year ahead of us, that is why I expect a very difficult task. ""It won't play a role that we go into this game as table leaders. Freiburg wouldn't do anything different if we were second."" Leipzig will be without ex-Germany defender Marvin Compper, who has an ankle injury, with Greece's Kyriakos Papadopoulos or wingback Stefan Ilsanker to deputise. Austria forward Marcel Sabitzer (head injury) and Guinea midfielder Naby Keita (foot problems) are also out."
178,21/11/2016,10:23,Five things we learned from the Bundesliga,"Bayern Munich are not top of the Bundesliga for first time in 14 months, new leaders RB Leipzig made history and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang dedicates his goal to a French rapper.","Here are five things we learned from the eleventh round of matches in the Bundesliga: Unbeaten RB Leipzig have usurped Bayern from the top of the league table and Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel thinks the new leaders can be the Leicester City of Germany. Last season, Leicester were the shock winners of the English Premier League and Tuchel says record-breaking Leipzig can do the same in Germany. ""Last year we had the phenomenon of Leicester City in England. Leipzig can go on exactly the same path,"" said Tuchel. ""I'm convinced of that when I see them."" Leipzig set a new record of 11 games unbeaten for a club at the start of their first Bundesliga season with a 3-2 win at Bayer Leverkusen on Friday. The result left them three points clear of second-placed Bayern, who lost 1-0 at Tuchel's Dortmund on Saturday. ""It's nice for the league, it's what everyone wanted -- but not us,"" snapped Bayern's captain Philipp Lahm after Bayern's 1-0 defeat at Dortmund in Germany's 'Der Klassiker'. Aubameyang's goal settled a bad-tempered clash as Dortmund claimed their first home league win over Bayern since 2012. Bayern are finally spluttering having won a record four consecutive German league titles since 2012/13. For the first time since September 2015, Bayern are off top spot as new coach Carlo Ancelotti tasted defeat for the first time in 11 German league games. To compare, his predecessor Pep Guardiola lost his first league games on his 29th match during his debut Bundesliga season in 2013/14. ""Bayern are missing the fitness, the joy and the authority in their play,"" observed Sky expert and ex-Germany captain Lothar Matthaeus. ""A lot of things which made them strong last season are missing now."" Aubameyang has celebrated scoring Dortmund goals with somersaults and by donning a Batman outfit in the past, but he dropped to the turf for three push-ups after scoring the winning goal against Bayern. ""It was for my mate Gradur. He's a famous rapper from France, who was in the stadium,"" explained Aubameyang as the artist has performed push-ups in his music videos. Gradur -- full name Wanani Gradi Mariadi -- is a star in France where his debut album 'L'homme au bob' went to Number One. Leipzig is roughly 300kms from the coast, but RB's head coach Ralph Hasenhuettl is comparing the new Bundesliga leaders to icebergs -- the real danger is their potential lying under the surface. Only around ten percent of an iceberg is above the waterline and Hasenhuettl used the image in a motivation video before Friday's 3-2 win at Leverkusen to inspire his side to sink their opponents. ""We tried to show the team their true potential is like an iceberg before the match,"" said the Austrian, whose side is unbeaten in their first 11 Bundesliga games -- a record for a newly-promoted team. ""Much of the potential that we have is not yet on display. ""We had an incredibly good attitude and we're hard to beat,"" he added with Leipzig to play second-placed Bayern in Munich on December 20. Guardiola's Manchester City are Borussia Moenchengladbach's next opponents on Wednesday with Andre Schubert's 'Foals' dropping fast down the league table. Gladbach's 2-1 defeat at home to Cologne on Saturday left them 11th and winless in their last six league games dating to the end of September. The Champions League home match against City is a daunting prospect given Manchester's 3-1 home win over Barcelona three weeks ago and head coach Schubert is under pressure. ""Now comes the question about the coach,"" Gladbach's director of sport Max Eberl fumed to Sky after the Cologne defeat before even asked about Schubert. ""For me, that's absurd. Today a team lost who had deserved to win."" A heavy defeat to City will do little for Schubert's future with Hoffenheim, Dortmund and Barcelona, away, their forthcoming opponents."
179,18/11/2016,23:53,Bundesliga upstarts Leipzig knock Bayern off top,RB Leipzig claimed another milestone in their fledgling history on Friday by taking three points in a 3-2 comeback win at Bayer Leverkusen to knock Bayern Munich off the top of the Bundesliga.,"The Bundesliga new boys, now unbeaten after 11 games, have a three-point lead on Bayern Munich, who are at Borussia Dortmund on Saturday evening in the battle of Germany's top clubs -- dubbed ""Der Klassiker"". Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern need to win at Dortmund to retain top spot on goal difference. ""From a psychological point of view we really did very well in the second-half when we were behind twice,"" said Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. After exchanging goals in the first four minutes -- Leverkusen's Kevin Kampl scoring after a minute before teammate Julian Baumgartlinger's own goal drew Leipzig level -- Leverkusen's German international winger Julian Brandt put the hosts ahead again just before half-time. The turning point came when Brandt earned a penalty on 54 minutes only for Hakan Calhanoglu's shot to be cleared by Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi. Swedish international Emil Forsberg equalised for Leipzig following an impressive solo run on 67 minutes and defender Willi Orban headed in the winner on 81 minutes for the Bundesliga upstarts. Leipzig earned their place in Germany's top flight with four promotions in seven years and have now set a Bundesliga record run for a newly promoted club by going 11 games unbeaten. The club, sponsored by Austrian energy drink giants Red Bull, have 27 points from 11 games with champions Bayern Munich on 24 points. But the newcomers have come under fire from rival fans who believe the club's sponsors have undermined the German idea of football not being an advertising product. On Friday night the team bus was sprayed with paint on its way to the BayArena stadium. Borussia Dortmund boss Hans-Joachim Watzke even weighed into the debate during the week. ""For the first time we have a case where nothing, but absolutely nothing, has developed in an historic fashion. We play football to promote a canned drink!"" said Watzke."
180,17/11/2016,02:28,Germany's new-boys Leipzig eye history in Leverkusen,RB Leipzig can claim a milestone in their fledgling history on Friday by taking a point at Bayer Leverkusen to knock Bayern Munich from the top of the Bundesliga table.,"""We definitely want to take something there and remain unbeaten. If there is a point available, then there will also be three,"" said Leipzig's coach Ralph Hasenhuettl ahead of the clash at Leverkusen's BayArena. Second-placed Leipzig, backed by Austrian drinks giants Red Bull, can become the first club to go 11 games unbeaten at the start of their first German league season if they avoid defeat. Ahead of the weekend's matches, both Bayern and Leipzig, who have earned four promotions in seven years, have 24 league points. A draw or win would see Leipzig top the table, at least overnight, ahead of Bayern, who are at Borussia Dortmund on Saturday evening in the battle of Germany's top clubs -- dubbed 'Der Klassiker'. But Hassenhuettl says usurping Bayern -- who Leipzig face in Munich on December 20 in a pre-Christmas showdown -- is not the priority. ""If we take points, the table will look like that,"" said the Austrian. ""But that's not a subject for us, it's neither the team's motivation, nor something we will let put us under pressure. ""We have other things to worry about, namely a tough away match."" Leipzig have question marks over top-scorer Timo Werner (upset stomach), who has five goals in ten league games, and teenage Scotland winger Oliver Burke (virus). ""It will be close for Oliver, Timo will most probably be okay,"" said Hasenhuettl. Following their 1-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur a fortnight ago, Leverkusen are on course for the last 16 in Europe. Bayer, who are eighth in the table, need a win to warm-up for Tuesday's Champions League group stage match at CSKA Moscow, but their coach Roger Schmidt says Leipzig have proved they deserve respect. ""Leipzig, with their financial possibilities and professional structure, are not your average newly-promoted team,"" said Schmidt, whose team won their three games before the international break. ""We want to climb the table, but we have our own goals. ""Before the international break, we made a very good impression, which we want to resume on Friday."" Leverkusen hope to have midfield hard-man Charles Aranguiz, but the Chile international picked up an injury in a World Cup qualifier against Uruguay. Captain Lars Bender, also a candidate for the defensive midfield, has not trained for two weeks with a heel injury. Kevin Kampl (bruised foot), Omer Toprak (thigh), Joel Pohjanpalo (foot fracture) and Vladlen Yurchenko (hairline shin fracture) are all out."
181,07/11/2016,13:58,New boys RB Leipzig want bigger stadium,"RB Leipzig are neck-and-neck with Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table, but the new boys are already thinking big with plans for a new stadium.","Leipzig earned their place in Germany's top flight with four promotions in seven years and are on a Bundesliga record run for a newly-promoted club by going ten games unbeaten to draw level on 24 points with Bayern. But according to daily newspaper Bild on Monday, RB Leipzig, who are sponsored by Austrian energy drink giants Red Bull, have had plans rejected for a new 70,000-capacity stadium outside the city centre in the exhibition district. RB Leipzig currently play at the Red Bull Arena -- an impressive stadium, renovated for the 2006 World Cup -- which is a short walk from the city's railway station. However, it's capacity for 45,000 fans is already deemed too small by club bosses who want more hospitality boxes and seating. City officials were delighted that Leipzig's Zentralstadion, now renamed the Red Bull Arena, is finally being regularly full for German league games and four of the five Bundesliga games so far have been sold out. But Leipzig's mayor Burkhard Jung has said the club can not build elsewhere in the city and can only use the area of land they currently occupy for a new stadium. ""The Red Bull Arena can be reached by foot from the railway station and is well connected by the tram system,"" said Jung. ""Above all, it anchors the football and the club in the city and in the city's society."" But it's clear the city is doing all it can to keep the club happy. The post of 'RB commissioner' is now being created in the town hall administration to act as a direct contact with the club for all stadium questions. RB Leipzig want to make a final decision on plans for a new stadium, or a renovation of the current one, decided by the beginning of December."
182,06/11/2016,18:07,Leipzig equal record to draw level with Bayern,Bundesliga new boys RB Leipzig drew level on 24 points with Bayern Munich at the top of the table on Sunday with a record-equalling 3-1 win over Mainz.,"Leipzig have now matched Bayern's run of seven wins and three draws from their first ten German league games. They equal the record for a team in their first Bundesliga season, set by MSV Duisburg, who also went ten games unbeaten in the 1993/94 campaign. Timo Werner and Emil Forsberg scored all three Leipzig goals and it threatened to turn into a rout as the hosts wasted four clear chances with the scoreline flattering Mainz, who drop to tenth. After Bayern were held to a 1-1 draw at Munich's Allianz Arena on Saturday, Leipzig seized their chance to match the Bavarian giants' points tally, but stay second on goal difference. Leipzig, who were only founded in 2009, earned their place in Germany's top flight this season with four promotions in seven years. Their pre-Christmas showdown with Bayern at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday December 20 is building to be a top-of-the-table clash. But Leipzig are keeping their feet firmly on the ground, repeatedly rejecting the tag of 'Bayern's Hunters', which the German media is eager to bestow upon them. ""This is a dream, but we won't blow things up to say we're hunting Bayern,"" insisted 20-year-old Werner after his two goals. A falsely triggered fire alarm delayed kick-off by three minutes at Leipzig's Red Bull Arena, but the 43,000 spectators barely had time to find their seats when Werner gave Leipzig the lead. Left winger Forsberg had his shot blocked, but Werner tapped home the rebound for his fourth goal of the season with three minutes gone. Werner returned the favour by out sprinting Mainz's Nigerian defender Leon Balogun and steered the ball into Forsberg's path for the Sweden international to double their lead on 21 minutes. A minute from the break, Forsberg also sprinted past Balogun before squaring for Werner, who fired home off his left foot to make it 3-0 at the break. Mainz coach Martin Schmidt brought on defender Stefan Bell for winger Jairo Samperio for the second half, but Forsberg and Werner both had second-half chances and could have added four more goals. Werner went off to loud applause, making way for Scotland winger Oliver Burke for the final 20 minutes. Mainz pulled a goal back 16 minutes from time when Bell out jumped his marker from a corner and placed his header into the far corner."
183,25/10/2016,15:44,Unloved Leipzig emerge as Bayern's closest challengers,RB Leipzig's remarkable unbeaten start to the Bundesliga season has seen them suddenly emerge at the head of the pack chasing reigning champions and league leaders Bayern Munich.,"The newly-promoted team have won five and drawn three of their eight matches so far in their debut Bundesliga season. Guinea international Naby Keita netted twice in Sunday's 3-1 win over Werder Bremen to leave them second, two points adrift of Bayern, who they face away on December 20 in their last outing before the winter break. It is no surprise, then, that Bayern are paying close attention to what's going on at RB Leipzig, who earned their Bundesliga place with four promotions in seven years. ""They could be very dangerous, personally I find Leipzig very convincing,"" said Bayern defender Mats Hummels, whose team-mate Joshua Kimmich, signed from RB in 2015, was in the Red Bull Arena to watch his ex-club beat Bremen. But the Bundesliga new boys are working hard to keep their feet on the ground, resisting the tags of 'Bayern-hunters' imposed on them by a German media eager to talk up a potential title race. RB Leipzig's sporting director Ralf Rangnick says any title talk is far too premature, insisting: ""We've made a good start so far, nothing more."" It certainly has been a very good introduction to life in Germany's top tier. They have claimed the scalps of Borussia Dortmund, Hamburg and Wolfsburg, and RB Leipzig are closing in on the record of 10 games unbeaten at the start of a season for a promoted club, set by MSV Duisburg in 1993/94. Austrian head coach Ralph Hasenhuettl says his side must ""stay humble and keep being greedy"" for league points. The club, which was founded by energy drinks giants Red Bull in 2009, have been given the cold shoulder by German football fans. A severed bull's head was thrown onto the pitch during a German Cup game at Dynamo Dresden in August. Then Cologne fans staged a sit-down protest in September which meant the Leipzig team bus arrived late for an away league game. Placards with anti-RB Leipzig slogans from rival fans regularly appear during games, but the negative sentiments pull the team together. ""We take the aggression from rival fans and turn it into positive energy for us,"" said defender Willi Orban. Any RB fans dreaming of Europe next season would be well advised to remember Hoffenheim, who finished the first half of their debut Bundesliga season in 2008/09 top of the table -- only to end up seventh. But there are good reasons to believe RB Leipzig can finish in the top four to earn a Champions League berth for next season. The young team, which has no superstars, is eager to learn and is flexible. ""We changed the formation against Bremen after 45 minutes -- and the boys did it superbly well,"" said Hasenhuettl. ""At the moment, there is an answer for everything."" They have had sell-out crowds of over 40,000 for three of their four home games and there is a euphoria building in the city -- formerly part of the communist East Germany -- at having a top-flight team. The previous dominant force in town was Lokomotiv Leipzig, Germany's very first champions in 1903 and Cup Winners' Cup finalists in 1987 who have since gone bankrupt and are now in the fourth tier -- alongside RB's second team -- after being reformed. ""There was already a huge amount of promotion euphoria amongst the fans and that's good,"" said Rangnick of RB's run. On top of that, sponsors Red Bull will be able to splash out for a new signing in January, should Hasenhuettl want to strengthen his squad. And while most of their rivals are involved in two or even three competitions, Leipzig can focus just on the Bundesliga for the rest of the season having been knocked out of the German Cup in August."
184,23/10/2016,17:48,Keita propels unbeaten RB Leipzig past Bremen,Guinea international Naby Keita scored twice as Bundesliga newcomers RB Leipzig defeated Werder Bremen 3-1 on Sunday to climb up to second place in Germany.,"Keita capped off a superb solo run to put Leipzig in front just before half-time, and the midfielder struck again on 74 minutes when he powered home a cross from former Bremen striker Davie Selke. Serge Gnabry gave the visitors hope as he cut the deficit in half almost immediately, but Germany Under-21 international Selke, who left Werder for Leipzig in July 2015, sealed the win deep into stoppage time. Ralph Hasenhuettl's Leipzig extended their unbeaten start to their maiden campaign in the German top flight as they pulled to within two points of leaders Bayern Munich. Werder, who lost their first four matches this term, dropped to 15th in the table after seeing a three-game unbeaten run snapped. Schalke collected just their second win after a dreadful start to the campaign as they eased past Mainz 3-0 in Gelsenkirchen. Algerian midfielder Nabil Bentaleb, on loan from Tottenham Hotspur, scored either side of a Max Meyer strike to fuel the Royal Blues' continued resurgence. Reigning champions Bayern defeated Borussia Moenchengladbach 2-0 on Saturday with goals from Arturo Vidal and Douglas Costa to return to winning ways after back-to-back draws in the league. Borussia Dortmund twice fought back from two goals behind to salvage a 3-3 draw at lowly Ingolstadt after 18-year-old US international Christian Pulisic popped up with an equaliser at the death. Hoffenheim, like Bayern and Leipzig, also remain undefeated following an impressive 3-0 victory away to Bayer Leverkusen."
185,16/10/2016,20:13,Unbeaten Leipzig down Wolves to go third,Controversial new-boys RB Leipzig are up to third in the Bundesliga after claiming another big-name scalp in Germany's top flight with a 1-0 win at VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday.,"Sweden international midfielder Emil Forsberg's winner gave unbeaten RB their fourth win in seven games as Wolfsburg joined Borussia Dortmund, Hamburg and Augsburg, in losing to Leipzig. The result, a third defeat in seven games with three draws and just one win, is a disaster for Wolfsburg, who reached the Champions League's knock-out stages last season. They are now fourteenth, just two points from the relegation places. High-profile summer signing and Germany striker Mario Gomez is yet to score for his new club and the latest defeat could spell trouble for coach Dieter Hecking. ""We have to have discussions and see how we react,"" said Wolfsburg's director of sport Klaus Allofs. ""We have to see that we come out of this as a club. ""That could be with, or without, the coach."" Sponsored by Austrian energy drinks giant Red Bull, RB Leipzig are unpopular with fans of traditional clubs, who fear the rise of corporate-backed entities in Germany's top flight. RB were only founded in 2009, but have risen through the ranks with four promotions in seven years to reach the Bundesliga. Their young squad, which has no big-name stars, are winning over neutral fans by playing eye-catching football, including Forsberg's superbly struck shot which curled in from outside the box on 70 minutes. Alongside leaders Bayern Munich, second-placed Cologne and sixth-placed Hoffenheim, Leipzig are one of the few unbeaten teams in the German league. Earlier, Mainz moved up to seventh with a 2-1 win at home to local rivals Darmstadt. Just 48 kilometres (30 miles) separates the two clubs and while Mainz are knocking on the door of the top six, the result left Darmstadt 15th in the table, just above the relegation places. Argentinian striker Pablo De Blasis gave Mainz the lead at the Opel Arena with a brilliant flick after just five minutes to claim his fourth goal in seven league games this season. Darmstadt were awarded a penalty just before the break when Mainz captain Stefan Ball fouled striker Antonio-Mirko Colak, but the Croatian forward had his spot-kick saved by Danish goalkeeper Jonas Loessl. It was a busy first-half as both sides hit the crossbar. Mainz doubled their lead when Turkey international Yunus Malli was brought down by Darmstadt captain Aytac Sulu, but got up to bang home the spot kick on 57 minutes. Darmstadt scored a late consolation when Mainz substitute Niko Bungert, who came on in the 90th minute, gave away a penalty for handball which midfielder Jerome Gondorf gratefully converted in injury time. Bayern remain two points clear at the top of the Bundesliga despite their 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, which left the defending champions winless in their last three matches."
186,13/10/2016,05:08,Fans fear the rise of Germany's 'plastic clubs',"The promotion of RB Leipzig to the Bundesliga has caused resentment amongst hardcore-fans of traditional teams, sparking fears that 'plastic clubs' could ruin the traditional culture in Germany's top flight.","RB Leipzig are backed by Austrian energy-drinks giants Red Bull, who took over a football licence and founded the club in 2009. The team was renamed RasenBallsport Leipzig, specifically to get around the German league rule forbidding teams from carrying a sponsor's name. Four promotions in seven years has taken Leipzig to the Bundesliga and their young squad are unbeaten after six games on their first season in the top tier. They have beaten both Borussia Dortmund and Hamburg, while drawn with other powerhouse clubs Cologne and Borussia Moenchengladbach. But their impressive performances so far in their debut season has earned little respect from Germany's hardcore fans -- labelled 'Ultras'. Some Leipzig matches have been boycotted and a severed bull's head was even thrown onto the playing area for an away German Cup match. Ultra fans of Cologne blocked the Leipzig team bus for their home game in September, which led to the kick-off being delayed, while banners reading ""We Hate RB"" were on display around the city. Borussia Dortmund's Ultras boycotted their away game in Leipzig last month, with supporters groups refusing to put their money into Red Bull's pockets. ""Red Bull Leipzig is leading the whole system of football to ad absurdum,"" filmmaker and Dortmund fan Jan-Henrik Gruszecki told broadcaster Sport1. ""Traditional clubs like Dortmund, Schalke, Cologne and Bayern Munich want to make money and play football. ""Red Bull want to sell a product and a brand. This is the basic difference."" Hostility towards sponsored teams in Germany's top flight is nothing new, but RB Leipzig have crystallised growing resentments. Ingolstadt, Bayer Leverkusen, Wolfsburg, Hoffenheim and now Leipzig are all backed by wealthy companies or individuals. None are widely popular and all are dubbed plastic clubs. When Wolfsburg, backed by car manufacturers Volkswagen, played Bayer Leverkusen, sponsored by pharmaceutical firm Bayer, last season, trade magazine Kicker dubbed it 'El Plastico', a play on words using the 'El Clasico' reference to the Real Madrid-Barcelona clash. Theoretically, Germany has a rule that should prevent individuals or institutions owning clubs outright. The 50+1 rule also states that a club must hold a majority of its own voting rights. But Leipzig bypassed the 50+1 rule with 51 percent of the club owned by Red Bull employees -- and the other 49 percent is owned by Red Bull. ""The peculiarity of the culture of football in Germany is that the clubs were founded as an association, in which the supporters have control of power and decision-making,"" Jonas Gabler, an expert on football culture in Germany, told AFP. ""The wishes and interests of the fans are taken very seriously. ""This interaction of fans with their clubs is an essential element of the culture of football. ""Now fans have the impression that this tradition is perverted by clubs who are created by companies."" Fans of traditional teams criticise plastic clubs for relying on a sponsor, who can withdraw the cash at will, and for taking the place in the top flight of a less wealthy club. For example, Leipzig beat Nuremberg, who have a strong tradition in Germany's top flight, to an automatic promotion spot last season. Reasonable ticket prices are a feature of German club football, but fans fear a deterioration of the mutual respect between clubs and their supporters could lead to a rise in prices. ""Many leaders personally reject this economic model. And many prefer not to oppose the majority of fans on this, so they remain cautious,"" observed Gabler."

""I'm sure that Leipzig will be in a single-digit place in the table at the end of the season,"" said Augsburg coach Dirk Schuster.

189,25/09/2016,19:50,Record-signing Burke nets for unbeaten Leipzig,Scottish teenager Oliver Burke scored his first Bundesliga goal on Sunday as new-boys RB Leipzig drew 1-1 at Cologne to remain unbeaten in Germany's top flight.,"Leipzig are backed by Austrian energy drinks giants Red Bull and are unpopular with fans of Germany's traditional clubs due to the commercialism they represent. For example, the match kicked off 15 minutes late after Cologne fans blocked the Leipzig team bus en route to the stadium. Banners around the Cologne stadium typically read ""Money kills"" and ""Piss Off, RB"". But Leipzig, who won four promotions in seven seasons since being founded in 2009, earned the away draw to stop host Cologne going second. Burke, 19, netted on his first start for Leipzig when the winger drilled home Marcel Sabitzer's pass with five minutes gone. Japan striker Yuya Osako levelled on 25 minutes while Cologne's French striker Anthony Modeste had a second-half goal ruled out for offside. The result leaves Cologne third and Leipzig seventh. Both sides are unbeaten in their first five games. Burke, who has been compared to Wales' star Gareth Bale, cost Leipzig 15 million euros ($16.8m) from Nottingham Forest, to become the most expensive Scottish transfer of all time. He says he does not understand the resentment from German fans towards his new club since arriving in Leipzig in August. ""I read on the internet that the club polarises in Germany,"" he told Germany daily Bild, in an interview before kick-off, having made his debut in RB's shock 1-0 win over Borussia Dortmund. ""Personally, I do not understand it. ""In England, it's quite normal that money is invested in football in order to create something new. ""Our fans and the atmosphere at the home games are fantastic, that's the end what counts. This is simply an outstanding club."" Earlier, Schalke 04's worst start to a Bundesliga season in the club's history was confirmed with a 2-1 loss at Hoffenheim. It was their fifth straight league defeat and piles the pressure on new coach Markus Weinzierl. They are the only club to still have no points in Germany's top flight. Having been recruited from Augsburg while sports director Christian Heidel was poached from Mainz, Weinzierl has endured a disastrous start. ""It's not down to him and I very much hope that all the people involved here support him"", said Schalke's captain, Germany defender Benedikt Hoewedes. ""We need to stand together, as men, and improve."" Werder Bremen's dramatic 2-1 win over Wolfsburg on Saturday had seen Schalke take Bremen's place at the bottom of the table. With Germany coach Joachim Loew watching, Schalke were on course for their first league points of the season after taking a fourth minute lead at Hoffenheim's Rhein Neckar Arena. Swiss striker Breel Embolo -- who cost Schalke 22 million euros ($24.5m) from Basel -- fired in a cross which Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting headed home. But Hoffenheim drew level when Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric, signed from Leicester City, headed them level on 17 minutes. And midfielder Lukas Rupp slotted home what proved to be the winning goal when his shot beat Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehermann on 41 minutes. Hamburg sacked coach Bruno Labbadia on Sunday after their 1-0 defeat to leaders Bayern Munich, their fourth-straight loss which left them 16th. Weinzierl is now the next boss sweating about his future with Schalke two places below in rock bottom. They play their next Europa League group stage match at home to RB Salzburg on Thursday, then face Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach next Sunday at home in the Bundesliga."

Klostermann is one of the stars of newly-promoted Leipzig, who last weekend beat Borussia Dortmund 1-0 in the Bundesliga.

191,28/08/2016,20:41,Sabitzer strike rescues debutants RB Leipzig,"After four promotions in seven seasons, RB Leipzig made an impressive Bundesliga debut on Sunday, twice coming from behind as Marcel Sabitzer's equaliser sealed a 2-2 draw at Hoffenheim.","Founded in 2009 by Austrian energy drink's firm Red Bull, RasenBallsport Leipzig are widely unpopular amongst German football fans, due to the commercialism they represent and resentment caused by their sponsor's deep pockets. For example, a severed bull's head was thrown onto the playing area at last Saturday's German Cup defeat at Dynamo Dresden and some fans of Borussia Dortmund, Leipzig's opponents for their first home league match in a fortnight, plan a boycott. But under Austrian coach Ralph Hasenhuettl, the talented young Leipzig side, lacking any big-name stars, proved themselves on their debut in Germany's top flight. ""I'm very happy with the point, which we deserved,"" said Hasenhuettl. ""In the first few minutes we behaved a bit naively, but quickly got up to the level."" They had two clear chances in the first-half, but fell behind when Hoffenheim's Lukas Rupp fired home from 15-metres out. The visitors drew level when Leipzig captain Dominik Kaiser scored against his ex-club on 58 minutes. Hoffenheim looked to have won the game when Sebastian Rudy's breakaway led to Mark Uth re-establishing the hosts' lead on 83 minutes, until Austrian international Sabitzer equalised in the 90th minute. When defender Benno Schmitz, a product of the Bayern Munich academy, fired in a late cross, Sabitzer, who spent last season at sister-club RB Salzburg, was waiting to tap home at the far post. After the result, Leipzig announced they have signed Scottish teenage winger Oliver Burke on a five-year-contract from Nottingham Forest, reportedly beating Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur to his signature. ""This transfer pleases us particularly because a lot of top clubs were interested and as well and we have added more quality to our attack,"" said Leipzig's director of sport Ralf Rangnick. Earlier, Julian Schieber's dramatic injury-time winner sealed Hertha Berlin's 2-1 victory at home to newly-promoted Freiburg to claim his first goal since knee surgery in March 2015. Hertha were cruising to a 1-0 win at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, thanks to Vladimir Darida's second-half goal before the game burst into life in the final ten minutes. Ex-Dortmund striker Schieber came off the bench for Vedad Ibisevic with 85 minutes gone and Freiburg drew level with a stunning header from their captain Nicolas Hoefler in the 93rd minute. But Hertha roared back as Schieber latched onto a blocked shot from Japan winger Genki Haraguchi and his crude shot rolled into the goal in the 95th minute. ""It's a dream for any footballer to score the winning goal in front of home fans shortly before the end, even if it was a scuffed shot,"" said Schieber. The hosts dominated possession and went ahead in the second half when Darida fired home, unmarked, from the edge of the area. Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou, who suffered a double bereavement in the last two weeks following the death of his mother and father, was left on Hertha's bench for the final dramatic ten minutes which yielded the two goals. On Friday, last season's champions Bayern Munich kicked-off the season with a 6-0 hammering of Werder Bremen at the Allianz Arena. Poland hot-shot Robert Lewandowski, the 2015/16 top-scorer in Germany with 30 goals, netted a hat-trick for Bayern to resume his rivalry with Borussia Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who scored 25 times to finish second. Dortmund laboured to a 2-1 win over Mainz as Aubameyang netted twice, with a header and then converted a second-half penalty."
192,27/08/2016,14:48,Germany's new-boys RB Leipzig compared to Apple,"Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann has defended Sunday's opponents, Red Bull-sponsored RB Leipzig, and compared the unpopular Bundesliga new-boys to the rise of software giants Apple.","Founded in 2009 when the Austrian energy drinks manufacturer bought their licence, RasenBallsport Leizpig has earned their place in Germany's top flight with four promotions in seven years. They will make their debut in Germany's top flight at Hoffenheim, but the new boys are already immensely unpopular with football fans across the country for the commercialism they represent. They will be the fourth commercially-backed team in the Bundesliga, along with VfL Wolfsburg (sponsored by VW), Bayer Leverkusen (backed by pharmaceutical giants Bayer) and Nagelsmann's Hoffenheim, backed by software billionaire Dietmar Hopp. Their mere presence in Germany's top flight has evoked a strong 'tradition against commercialism' debate amongst fans. ""Of course, there are clubs who draw strong emotions. It's great when fans in Cologne or Moechengladbach sing their songs, like they have for years and years,"" Nagelsmann told Munich-based newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung. ""But we should give credit to the work done by clubs, whether they are recently new or have been around for decades. ""In the business world, when a new start-up arrives on the scene with great new inventions, no one says 'they have no tradition, so this product is crap and I don't want it'. ""It's seen as a great, young company whose product everyone wants. ""30 years ago, no one knew of Apple, yet today everyone has an iPhone. ""Incidentally, even 'traditional' clubs spend money. 'Tradition' alone doesn't pay the wages of expensive players."" But even the name RB Leipzig has annoyed some fans, because it flaunts the rules drawn up to keep commercialism out of German football. 'RasenBallsport' (GrassBallsport) is a fabricated German word, an unsubtle way for Red Bull to circumnavigate German Football League (DFL) rules that a team can not carry a sponsors name. Nagelsmann says RB Leipzig deserves respect for having risen through the German league system without splashing out on big-name signings, despite their deep pockets. ""This (RB Leipzig) is a club which also has a sponsor behind it, just like many others,"" added Nagelsmann. ""They have polarised people, for example, because Red Bull is also involved in extreme sports, but Leipzig (the club) is doing nothing to harm society. ""They are educating talent, helping with (players) personal development or school studies. ""When 20 young men work with a discipline and a good team spirit towards a goal, that is much better than when they are just getting up to mischief on the streets."""
193,26/08/2016,04:04,Defiant RB Leipzig braced for Bundesliga hostility,"RB Leipzig make their Bundesliga debut on Sunday, but the East German outfit, sponsored by energy drinks manufacturer Red Bull, are already far from popular in Germany's top-flight.","For the 2016/17 season, the Bundesliga will finally have a club from former East Germany for the first time since Energie Cottbus were relegated in 2009 - the year RB Leipzig was founded. Leipzig is where the German Football Association (DFB) was founded and, since the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, had never had a team in Germany's top-flight. But there will be no warm welcome from rival fans for Sunday's first match at Hoffenheim. ""The Bundesliga has found a new object of hatred, the RB Leipzig,"" commented weekly newspaper Die Zeit. In an extreme example, a severed bull's head was thrown onto the pitch by fans of second-division Dynamo Dresden during last Saturday's German Cup first-round away defeat. Banners reading 'Kill the Bulls' and 'Red Bull deserves beatings' on display in Dresden were typical of those seen around German grounds when RB Leipzig play away. At Erzgebirge Aue in February 2015, a banner compared Red Bull's owner Dietrich Mateschitz to Adolf Hitler and RB Leipzig's fans to Nazis. The level of hostility shown towards the German league new boys is more than just petty jealousy from former second division rivals. Some fans of Borussia Dortmund, who will be the first Bundesliga club to visit Leipzig's Red Bull Arena on September 10, plan to boycott the game. There is little respect from within German football to the considerable feat of having earned four promotions in seven years with a team lacking star signings. ""You don't have to like us, but no one will knock us off our path,"" said RB Leipzig's director of sport Ralf Rangnick defiantly. RB Leipzig is seen as the embodiment of the commercialism that the average German fans loathes. The new kids on the Bundesliga block have endless cash reserves and are bankrolled by Austrian billionaire Mateschitz. The club was only founded in 2009 -- when Red Bull bought the licence from fifth-division minnows SSV Markranstadt -- and RasenBallsport (GrassBallsport) Leipzig was born. 'RasenBallsport' is a fabricated German word, an unsubtle way of getting around Red Bull's problem that, under German Football League (DFL) rules, a team may not carry a sponsor's name. They also navigated their way around the DFL's '50+1' rule to prevent any individual having a controlling stake in a club. Red Bull owns 49 percent of RB Leipzig, but the remaining 51 percent is owned by employees of the Austrian drinks firm. Such rule-bending means RB Leipzig has been dealing with hostility from within German football since they started life seven years ago. ""This club is not my favourite and never will be,"" said Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke tersely. Despite achieving Bundesliga status, the club has resisted the urge to bring in a big-name signing for their debut. Werder Bremen's Davie Selkie joined in 2015 and was the club's top scorer with a modest 10 goals in 30 games as they finished second in last season's second division behind Freiburg. None of their internationals -- USA striker Terrence Boyd, Denmark forward Yussuf Poulsen, Guinea midfielder Natby Keita or Hungary's Zsolt Kalmar -- are household names in Germany. Centre-back Marvin Compper won his single cap for Germany back in 2009. They have an impressive youth system, which produced Bayern Munich and Germany defender Joshua Kimmich. Their deep resources means some fans feel they could be a threat to Bayern's dominance of the German league. ""I don't want to be 80 by the time RB win their first Bundesliga title,"" said Mateschitz last year, giving the club eight years to lift the German league trophy. Bayern's chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge was reserved in his welcome of the Bundesliga new boys. ""It is good for the Bundesliga that there is a club from the east in the Bundesliga again,"" he told magazine Sport Bild. ""But I believe that fans from the east would have been more pleased if Dynamo Dresden had done it."" However, the Bayern boss was emphatic when asked when RB Leipzig would win their first Bundesliga title. ""I will never see that happen,"" he snapped."
194,27/07/2016,12:31,Olympics: Dane turns down Rio to prepare for Bundesliga,Striker Yussuf Poulsen has turned down the chance to play for Denmark at the Rio Olympics to help get newly promoted RB Leipzig ready for the Bundesliga season.,"The 22-year-old was selected for the Danish team to play at the Rio Games from August 5 to 21, but the forward has opted to stay behind to help Leipzig prepare for their first season in Germany's top flight, which opens on August 26. The final for the men's Olympic football tournament takes place on August 20 and, had Denmark progressed that far, Poulsen would have struggled to be included when Leipzig kick off their first Bundesliga campaign the following weekend. Having only been created in 2009, when energy drink manufacturer Red Bull took charge, RB Leipzig have won three promotions in the last seven seasons to reach the Bundesliga. And Poulsen wants to be included for their opening match against Hoffenheim on August 28. ""It wasn't an easy decision for me, for the last few weeks I have been thinking a lot about my goals and made my decision after some constructive talks with those in charge at the club,"" he told German daily Bild. ""I want to help establish RB in the Bundesliga, so I decided the best thing for me is to stay here to put in the best possible training for the new season."" His friend and rival for the striker's berth at Leipzig, Davie Selke, will travel to Rio to play for Germany at the Olympics."
195,08/05/2016,18:43,Controversial RB Leipzig win promotion to the Bundesliga,"Just seven years after being founded, RB Leipzig, sponsored by energy drinks giants Red Bull, will play in the Bundesliga next season after their second division promotion was confirmed Sunday.","Goals by Sweden's Emil Forsberg and Marcel Halstenberg sealed their 2-0 win at home to Karlsruhe, in front of 42,559 fans, which means they will join second division champions Freiburg in Germany's top flight next season. ""Right now there is nothing better, it's unbelievable,"" said Leipzig's ex-Germany defender Marvin Compper. ""We had to break down a lot of resistance, but at the end we deserve to go up. ""There are no other words for this."" But RB Leipzig will not receive a warm welcome in the Bundesliga from many fans of Germany's top clubs. Rasenballsport Leipzig were founded in 2009 when Red Bull, owned by Austrian billionaire Dietrich Mateschitz, bought the licence from lower league side SSV Markranstaedt. They changed their name, but German Football League (DFL) rules meant they were not allowed to copy the likes of Red Bull New York or Red Bull Salzburg in using the company name in the title. After a year in Germany's fifth division, the rise was constant: three years in the regional (fourth division), a year in the third tier and two in the second, before finally winning full Bundesliga status. RB Leipzig will become the 55th club to play in the Bundesliga, and next season will be the first since 2008/09 when a club from the former East Germany will feature in the top flight. They can expect a cold reception in the Bundesliga, especially against traditional clubs like Borussia Dortmund and Schalke. Like Bayer Leverkusen, who are sponsored by pharmaceutical company Bayer, VW-backed Wolfsburg and Hoffenheim, who are bank-rolled by software magnate Dietmar Hopp, RB Leipzig are unpopular with fans due to their backing. During RB's rise through the leagues, opposition fans rioted during matches, organised protests and staged boycotts, while Leipzig's players have been spat at. After a long search, Ingolstadt's Ralph Hasenhuettl was appointed as Leipzig coach for next season, while Ralf Rangnick will be director of football after coaching the side this term. Hasenhuettl was booed by his club's own fans in his final home match against Bayern Munich on Saturday and later broke down in tears in the post-match press conference. ""You'd rather be Rangnick's jester than king of the Schanzer? (Ingolstadt's nickname)"", questioned one banner at Ingolstadt's Audi-Sportpark stadium. The current Leipzig squad includes Rani Khedira, brother of Germany midfielder Sami Khedira, Compper, who won his single cap for Germany in 2008, and USA international striker Terrence Boyd, but bigger names are sure to be signed before next season. The only downside to Leipzig's promotion celebrations at their Red Bull Arena stadium on Sunday was written all over Rangnick's grimacing face. The RB boss suffered a suspected torn hamstring after slipping while being chased by players who were successful in their attempts to pour beer over him."

But home fans marred the victory by displaying several derogatory banners aimed at Mateschitz and his club. Seventh-placed RB Leipzig is hoping for promotion to Germany's top tier this year, but is unpopular with German football fans due to the millions of euros invested by the drinks company. ""Out of Austria, only the best for Germany,"" read the text on one banner, under a drawing of Mateschitz dressed in a Nazi uniform, referring to Austria-born Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. Another read: ""An Austrian calls and you follow blind, every child knows how that ended. You would have made good Nazis,"" aimed at the RB Leipzig club. Aue are likely to be fined by the German Football Association (DFB), who are expected to investigate the matter. ""It's a mess, we strongly distance ourselves from the banners,"" fumed Aue's president Helge Leonhardt. ""Three points won, but in the end a lot of prestige and recognition lost!"" The club put out an official statement distancing themselves from the banners. ""We condemn these banners in the strongest possible terms,"" read the statement. ""We want nothing to do with people who bring these banners and signs, with such despicable content, into our stadium. ""A minority of fans ensured that there was a nasty taste left after a successful evening for Erzgebirge Aue. ""We want to apologise to RB Leipzig for this."""
197,07/11/2014,03:00,Drinks giants aim to take Leipzig into Bundesliga,"Having inspired a series of Formula One world titles, Austrian energy drink giant Red Bull is now aiming to lift RB Leipzig all the way from Germany's regional leagues to the Bundesliga.","Since the company founded RasenBallsport Leipzig and pumped in millions of euros in sponsorship, three promotions have followed in five years. With Germany's capital celebrating the 25th year anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, East Germany could have a football club back in the Bundesliga next season with RB Leipzig currently third in the second division. Red Bull's owner Dietrich Mateschitz ultimately wants the club to win the German title. ""A few years go by so quickly, but eventually it will happen,"" the 70-year-old billionaire told SID, an AFP subsidiary, when asked if winning the Bundesliga is realistic. In the meantime, he wants Leipzig to reach the top tier to challenge the likes of recent German title-winners Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. ""If we did not want that at some point, then we might as well hang up our boots,"" he insisted. ""To talk about promotions as a foregone conclusion would be absurd, but you need ambitious goals and it wouldn't be a bad thing if we get in the first division as soon as possible."" Currently in the Germany's second tier, RB Leipzig is bidding to become the first club from the former German Democratic Republic in the top flight since Energie Cottbus were relegated in 2009. The current squad contains several players with Bundesliga experience, including midfielder Rani Khedira, brother of Real Madrid's World Cup winner Sami and Germany international Marvin Compper. The RB Leipzig story began just five years ago when Red Bull bought amateur club SSV Markranstaedt, who were languishing in the fifth division, after first considering other clubs. They changed the club's name and the fourth Red Bull football team came into existence after New York Red Bulls, FC Red Bull Salzburg and Red Bull Brazil. The name change by-passed the German Football Association (DFB) rule which prohibits teams being named after a sponsor and the unusual RasenBallsport (grass ball-sport) moniker allows the team to be known as RB Leipzig for short. Big-money sponsorship of Bundesliga teams is nothing new with Hoffenheim, who were promoted in 2008, backed by software billionaire Dietmar Hopp. Likewise, VfL Wolfsburg have car manufacturers VW Volkswagen behind them and Bayer Leverkusen are sponsored by drug manufacturers Bayer. RB Leipzig are well placed to be in contention for promotion next May and already has a World Cup-standard stadium. The 44,345-capacity Red Bull Arena stadium, formerly known as Zentralstadion, hosted matches during the 2006 World Cup. RB Leipzig's budget of around 30 million euros, with a reported similar figure being invested in a training centre, means they are a force to be reckoned with in Germany's second tier, where teams have an average budget of between 15 and 20 million euros. But the rise of the heavily-backed and branded club has received mixed reactions in Germany. On one hand, a former East German club back in the Bundesliga paints a romantic picture of a ""Beacon of the East"" according to Leipzig's managing director Ulrich Wolter. On the other, Red Bull's considerable investment does not sit comfortably with their Bundesliga rivals. In Germany, there is the ""50 + 1"" rule, which means every club must have a controlling stake to prevent commercial interests from taking control. Wolfsburg and Leverkusen are exempt as they were founded as factory teams. While RB Leipzig's management board was elected by club members, it is heavily influenced by Red Bull, which has drawn criticism from the German media. And a group of their second-division rivals, with Berlin's FC Union most vocal, have already protested by forming a ""Nein zu RB"" (No to RB) campaign. Union's 2-1 win against Leipzig in Germany's capital in September was marked by a 15-minute silent protest and with the majority of the home fans dressed in black, the match felt like a funeral. Football magazine 11Freunde described Leipzig's rise as a ""resounding slap in the face to football's culture"" and they are not alone in that opinion. ""This development is bad for the overall economic performance of the Bundesliga,"" Borussia Dortmund's managing director Hans-Joachim Watzke told magazine Der Spiegel. ""People are afraid, nobody wants to mess with Red Bull."" Leipzig's rise hits a nerve with German football fans who see the team as the product of a ""marketing machine"", according to sports marketing specialist Peter Rohlmann. ""I don't think it's a model, Red Bull (Leipzig) is an exception,"" Rohlmannn told AFP. ""But this is a very big risk: if the money disappears, so does the club."""
