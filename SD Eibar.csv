0,22/01/2021,00:29,Suarez double fires Atletico seven points clear,Eibar goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic scored a penalty against Atletico Madrid on Thursday but a brace from Luis Suarez saw the La Liga leaders come from behind to win 2-1 at Ipurua.,"Dmitrovic drove an early spot-kick past fellow goalkeeper Jan Oblak, only for Suarez to inspire the comeback, his second also a penalty which he earned himself and then converted in the 89th minute. Another late victory for Atletico means they pull seven points clear of second-placed Real Madrid and 10 ahead of third-placed Barcelona, with another game in hand over both still to come. Dmitrovic said he was nominated as Eibar's penalty taker by coach Jose Luis Mendilibar. ""The idea that I would take it came from Mendilibar -- it was my turn today, but it's a shame because it hasn't been of any use,"" Dmitrovic said. ""He took it because the others have missed,"" said Mendilibar. ""He will keep taking them until he misses, that's the rule."" Suarez, meanwhile, moves level with Lionel Messi at the top of La Liga's scoring charts on 11 goals, the Uruguayan increasingly looking like a player that can lead his side to the title. He had Marcos Llorente's pressing to thank for his equaliser but the second was almost entirely down to him, the 33-year-old chasing down a long punt downfield before tumbling over following a clumsy swing of the leg by Anaitz Arbilla. Suarez chipped the penalty coolly down the middle. ""He takes responsibility,"" said Diego Simeone. ""He never leaves the game, he always plays with that intelligence that he has."" ""He is extraordinary,"" Simeone added. ""We're glad he is with us."" Atletico were the victims of an upset in the Copa del Rey a fortnight ago when they lost to third-tier side Cornella, whose spirited run came to an end at the hands of Barcelona on Thursday. Atletico's defeat by Cornella could have jolted their momentum. Instead they have responded with two wins in the league, against Sevilla and now Eibar, who stay 15th."
1,29/12/2020,21:47,Home draw with Eibar ends Barcelona's gloomy year on drab note,Barcelona ended a difficult year with another disappointing result as they were held 1-1 at home by struggling Eibar on Tuesday.,"The result left Barcelona in sixth place in La Liga, seven points behind Atletico Madrid who have played two fewer matches. The six-time Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi is nursing an ankle injury and watched from the stands. In his absence Martin Braithwaite took an eighth minute penalty kick, and missed. The Dane did put the ball in the net in the 25th minute but the strike was disallowed. Although Barcelona dominated possession and took far more shots, Eibar took the lead after 57 minutes. Their captain Kike Garcia pounced after a defensive mistake from Ronald Araujo. Ousmane Dembele levelled 10 minutes later with a right foot shot but Barcelona could not find the winning goal. In the other early game, Lucas Ocampo converted an early penalty and Youssef En-Neyri added a second after the break as Sevilla beat visiting Villarreal 2-0. Sevilla moved onto a tie for third with Real Sociedad and Villarreal."
2,28/12/2020,16:03,Real resume Atletico chase as Messi absent for Barca,Real Madrid will attempt to sign off the year with a sixth win on the bounce as Zinedine Zidane's in-form side continue their pursuit of La Liga leaders and city rivals Atletico Madrid on Wednesday.,"Defending champions Real are level on 32 points with Atletico but have played two games more than Diego Simeone's men ahead of their trip to Elche. Karim Benzema has been the driving force behind Real's excellent December run, claiming key goals in wins over Athletic Bilbao, Eibar and Granada after securing the club a spot in the Champions League knockout phase. Eden Hazard is also in line to feature after recovering from his latest injury setback. The Belgian was an unused substitute in last week's victory over Granada and has made just three league starts this campaign. Real coach Zinedine Zidane hopes the short festive break afforded to his players over Christmas will not interrupt the momentum built over a domestic five-game winning streak. ""We're going to keep working hard. We have an awful lot of games, we should be pleased with what we're doing,"" said Zidane. ""We're going to lose games again, but we're going to try to win as many as possible. From time to time it's inevitable."" Atletico have responded well to the 2-0 defeat by Real earlier this month that snapped their 26-match unbeaten league run. However, the loss of Kieran Trippier is a substantial blow to a defence that has conceded just five goals in 13 matches, easily the fewest in the division. The England defender, an ever-present for Atletico in La Liga and Europe this term, was recently hit with a 10-week ban for breaching betting rules and will be unavailable until March. The club is said to be considering an appeal. Diego Costa has reportedly asked to terminate his contract for family reasons, having just returned from a blood clot that sidelined the Brazil-born Spain international for a month. Joao Felix is expected to return after missing the 2-0 win at Real Sociedad, although the Portuguese star hasn't scored in the league since November 7. Barcelona will bid to end a turbulent 2020 on a winning note at home to Eibar, but Ronald Koeman's side will be without Lionel Messi after the Argentine was granted an extended break as he recovers from an ankle knock. The six-time Ballon d'Or winner admitted his aborted departure in the summer had affected him at the start of the season, but stressed he felt ""excited"" to play under Koeman. ""Barca is my life, I'm in love with the club. And the city, my children were born here,"" Messi said in an interview with Spanish TV channel La Sexta broadcast on Sunday. ""I feel good right now, ready to fight for everything."" The Celta Vigo forward, the leading Spanish scorer in La Liga three of the past four years, has inspired a turnaround at Balaidos after the team won just one of their first 10 matches. The 33-year-old Aspas, who in November became the club's all-time leading scorer in the top flight, has netted eight times in 15 appearances this term and led Celta back into the top half following four wins in five games before Christmas. Much like with Real and Benzema, who is level at the top of the scoring charts with Aspas, Celta's success in 2021 could heavily rely on the former Liverpool attacker. 500 - Diego Simeone will take charge of his 500th match as Atletico boss against Getafe on Wednesday. He has won 300 games since his appointment in December 2011. 35 - Lionel Messi has been involved in more La Liga goals than any other player this year. The Argentine has scored 19 times and provided 16 assists. 9 - the number of games without a win for Real Sociedad across all competitions. Two weeks ago the Basques held top spot, but three successive defeats have dropped Imanol Alguacil's side six points off the pace."
3,20/12/2020,23:41,'Phenomenal' Benzema stars as Real Madrid move level with Atletico at La Liga summit,"Karim Benzema was described as ""phenomenal"" after scoring the opening goal and creating two others as Real Madrid won 3-1 at Eibar on Sunday to move level on points with city rivals Atletico at the top of La Liga.","Benzema and Luka Modric scored inside the first 13 minutes in the Basque Country to put Zinedine Zidane's men on their way to a fourth straight league win, with Lucas Vazquez scoring a late third after Garcia Kike pulled one back for Eibar. ""He is decisive. What he does is phenomenal,"" said Real coach Zinedine Zidane in praise of French compatriot Benzema. ""Not just in terms of goals. I'm repeating myself on Karim, but he doesn't just score goals. Karim brings clear-sightedness to our game, that's very important. ""When he scores it's even better, but beyond that he is very important to us."" Real sit behind Atletico on goal difference, but have the better head-to-head record, which is how level teams are split at the end of the season. Diego Simeone's Atletico have two games in hand, though, after Saturday's 3-1 success against Elche. Fifth-placed Barcelona are eight points adrift of the Madrid pair following their 2-2 draw this weekend with Valencia. Eibar started brightly, but fell behind in the sixth minute as Rodrygo fed Benzema to slot in his seventh league goal of the season. Benzema, who was also hailed by Zidane as the greatest ever French centre-forward earlier this week, created the second goal seven minutes later, cutting inside and picking out Modric who fired home right-footed. The striker should have doubled his tally in the 16th minute, but he headed Modric's cross past the post. Real went close to a third goal again when home goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic kept out Rodrygo's close-range effort, but Eibar got themselves back into the match in spectacular style before the half-hour mark. Kike collected the ball outside the area before curling a fine finish past Thibaut Courtois. Benzema thought he had restored the visitors' two-goal lead before half-time, but was flagged for a marginal offside, with VAR upholding the linesman's decision. Eibar, sitting 14th in the table, wasted an excellent chance to equalise 11 minutes after the break, as Takashi Inui shot wide following a rare mistake from Real captain Sergio Ramos. The reigning champions struggled to put the game to bed in the second half, with Marco Asensio striking a free-kick narrowly off target shortly after coming on as a substitute. The capital giants survived a late scare when VAR decided not to award Eibar a penalty after the ball struck Ramos's arm. Vazquez wrapped up the points in injury time with a cool finish from a tight angle, having been played in by Benzema. Earlier on Sunday, former Spain international Roberto Soldado scored twice as Granada moved into sixth with a 2-0 win over Real Betis, while Getafe beat Cadiz 2-0 and Celta Vigo made it four straight victories by seeing off Alaves by the same scoreline."
4,18/12/2020,03:14,In-form Benzema has Madrid on 'right track' for title charge,"Real Madrid's top scorer this season Karim Benzema said the La Liga champions are ""on the right track"" ahead of potentially returning to the top of table with a win at Eibar on Sunday.","Madrid, who last led the league last season, trail leaders Atletico Madrid and second-placed Real Sociedad on goal difference after a Benzema double in Tuesday's 3-1 victory over Athletic Bilbao took his tally up to 10 across all competitions for the campaign. Coach Zinedine Zidane had been under pressure following a run of three games without a win in November with Spanish press linking former Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino and ex-Madrid forward Raul forward to the Frenchman's job. ""We are on the right track. We work together, we score goals, we don't concede,"" Benzema told the club's television channel. ""We have to continue game by game. They are all finals and three points,"" the 32-year-old added. Zidane hailed Benzema, who last played for France in 2015, as the best centre-forward in their country's history after his midweek performance. The World Cup winner praised Benzema's selfless efforts with the forward supplying three assists this term. ""That's why I like him so much, I love him, he's not only thinking about goals,"" he said. ""He gets involved in the game, if he needs to pass to a teammate he'll do it."" Before Madrid's trip to the Basque Country late on Sunday, Atletico host 14th placed Elche on Saturday for their first league fixture since last weekend's capital city derby loss to Zidane's men. Forward Diego Costa returned to training this week after recovering from thrombosis but is unlikely to feature for Diego Simeone's side before the end of the calendar year. Later on Saturday, early runaway leaders Real Sociedad head to Levante but have drawn their previous six fixtures in all competitions and will be without Belgium playmaker Adnan Januzaj due to a muscle problem. Fifth-placed Barcelona welcome Valencia after defender Jordi Alba described Wednesday's win over Real as their ""best game of the season"". It allowed the Catalans to move six points off the leaders ahead of this weekend. Sociedad's captain has been sidelined with a muscle problem since December 3's Europa League draw with Rijeka but could come back for the trip to Ciutat de Valencia. The Spain attacker had scored seven goals and created three more, and the Basques failed to win and dropped down to second in his absence."
5,13/12/2020,23:50,"Messi saves lacklustre Barca, Sociedad reclaim top spot","Lionel Messi saved Barcelona from another embarrassing result by scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 win over lowly Levante, while Real Sociedad returned top of La Liga on Sunday.","Messi struck with 14 minutes remaining of a lacklustre display from Barca at the Camp Nou which will do little to ease fan fears following their 3-0 hammering at the hands of Juventus midweek. Ronald Koeman's side are still way off the pace in the title race, nine points behind Sociedad who reclaimed first place despite only drawing 1-1 with Eibar. Barcelona do however have two games in hand on the Basque outfit. Atletico are level on 26 points with Sociedad and also have two games in hand while Real Madrid are now just three points behind the leaders having played one less after beating their local rivals 2-0 on Saturday. Villarreal are four points off the lead in fourth after drawing 1-1 at Real Betis, who are one point behind Barca in ninth. ""The team is working well, they gave the maximum,"" said Koeman. ""We still lack a little confidence in ourselves, in our game, but we had a lot of chances, and I have nothing to say about the attitude of the players in this match."" Barca managed to force several saves from Aitor Fernandez, with the Levante goalkeeper doing particularly well to push away a stinging shot from Martin Braithwaite in the 16th minute and Antoine Griezmann's header five minutes later. However the best chance of the opening period fell to Jorge de Frutos in the 12th minute, the Spaniard somehow shooting straight at Marc-Andre ter Stegen after the ball broke kindly for him right in front of goal. Barca continued to dominate possession in the second half but if anything looked less threatening, with Fernandez being called into action largely for shots that were hit straight at him. However with Levante looking more comfortable than a side of their level should at the Camp Nou, Messi saved his team with a clinical finish off the post after collecting Frenkie de Jong's pass. It was hardly the sort of display to honour Sergio Busquets' 593rd appearance for the club, which takes him level at fourth of all time for matches played for Barca alongside Carles Puyol. However the three points are a boost ahead of the visit of Sociedad on Wednesday, which is then followed up by another home clash with Valencia on Saturday. Earlier Ander Barrenetxea gave Real Sociedad the lead in San Sebastian with a thumping strike in the 20th minute, but Sergi Enrich turned home with 25 minutes remaining to send his team 10th on 15 points. Sociedad would have had a bigger gap between them and Atletico had Igor Zubeldia's 80th-minute tap-in not been ruled out by VAR for an extremely tight offside. Sunday's draw was Sociedad's sixth in as many games in all competitions, and came after another 1-1 draw at Napoli on Thursday which saw them squeeze into the last 32 of the Europa League. Granada won 1-0 at Elche in Sunday's other match, a win that keeps them one point ahead of Barcelona."
6,25/06/2020,22:01,"Valencia top-four bid ""impossible"" after Eibar defeat",Valencia's chances of making La Liga's top four appear to be over after they were beaten 1-0 away at relegation battlers Eibar on Thursday.,"Geoffrey Kondogbia's own-goal after 16 minutes gave Eibar the lead at Ipurua, where they were the better side in a victory that could prove crucial to their survival. Valencia could have no complaints and defeat leaves them eighth in the table, seven points adrift of Sevilla in fourth. Since La Liga restarted, they have won only once in four matches. They squeezed into the Champions League last year on the final day of the season but another rescue act looks unlikely, with defender Jose Luis Gaya admitting after the game that finishing in the top four feels ""impossible"". ""We knew what to expect here on this pitch, we knew once Eibar get in front it's very difficult,"" Gaya said. ""It feels impossible to qualify for the Champions League now. ""We're far behind and it's going to be very hard now to recover. It's very difficult, we're really frustrated because we haven't taken our opportunity."" Victory for Eibar moves them six points clear of Real Mallorca in the relegation zone, a significant advantage even with seven games still to play. After restarting with a loss and two draws, Eibar had been sucked into the battle at the bottom but this win puts them in a strong position to guarantee top-flight status for a seventh consecutive year. Their goal was fortunate as Valencia failed to clear a routine corner and as Kondogbia turned his back the ball rebounded off his leg and flew in. ""We weren't playing well before,"" said Eibar's Pedro Leon. ""We had a lost a bit of rhythm but now we feel like we're on the right path again."""
7,20/06/2020,22:10,Getafe stumble again in race for top four,Getafe's hopes of finishing in La Liga's top four took another knock on Saturday as their disappointing return from the three-month suspension continued with a 1-1 draw at home to Eibar.,"Peter Etebo's smart finish put Getafe in front at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez before Eibar's Charles equalised from close range on the stroke of half-time. Eibar might even have snatched victory, only to have a late goal from Pedro Bigas ruled out for offside. Getafe have now taken just two points from three games since the restart, with Atletico Madrid primed to take advantage when they host struggling Real Valladolid later on Saturday. Victory for Atletico would send them four points ahead of Getafe and five clear of Real Sociedad, who have also lost momentum and face Real Madrid on Sunday. ""It's clear we needed to win to give us a boost,"" said Getafe's Jaime Mata. ""It would have kickstarted us after the break but we have to keep fighting until we get that win. People say our ambitions are too high but we are going to keep fighting."" Getafe are punching above their weight towards the top of the table, having enjoyed a remarkable four years under coach Jose Bordalas. They were only promoted to the top tier in 2017 and missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day last year, edged out by Valencia. But their challenge may not extend so far this term given this draw followed a stalemate at home to struggling Espanyol and defeat by newly-promoted Granada. It contributes to a more prolonged dip in form that has included only two wins in nine. Eibar are without a victory themselves in five matches but this was a valuable point that gives them something to build on in their battle to avoid relegation. They sit 16th, three points above the bottom three. With their coach Jose Luis Mendilibar serving a touchline ban, Eibar fell behind after half an hour when Marc Cucurella's deep cross was volleyed back in by Angel Rodriguez and Etebo steered the ball first time into the corner. But Eibar responded and when Getafe's defence failed to push out together after a botched Eibar free-kick, Bigas was left free to nod across to Charles, who had a simple finish. Neither team really deserved to win it in the second half but Eibar thought they had when Pape Diop's cross grazed the top of Bigas' head and bounced in. But Bigas had strayed just offside and Eibar had to settle for a point. Earlier, Espanyol were beaten 3-1 at home by Levante, a blow to their morale after they resumed with an impressive win over Alaves and hard-fought draw against Getafe. Espanyol stay bottom, three points adrift of safety. Athletic Bilbao climbed to ninth after Inigo Martinez's flicked finish was enough to beat Real Betis 1-0. Betis' Sergio Canales missed an 85th-minute penalty in the defeat, which leaves coach Rubi on the brink of the sack."
8,14/06/2020,21:29,"Marcelo takes knee, Hazard off as Real Madrid return with win",Real Madrid stayed two points behind Barcelona after a 3-1 win over Eibar on Sunday in a game which saw Marcelo take a knee and Eden Hazard suffer another injury.,"In their first game in three months following the coronavirus suspension, Toni Kroos, Sergio Ramos and Marcelo all scored in the opening 45 minutes. Brazilian defender Marcelo marked his 37th minute goal by taking a knee and raising a fist in sympathy with the Black Lives Matter movement. Hazard, playing for the first time since February after undergoing ankle surgery in March, was replaced in the second half with what appeared to be a recurrence of the same injury."
9,05/05/2020,21:23,Eibar players and staff fear fresh outbreak from La Liga restart,Players and coaching staff of La Liga outfit Eibar said on Tuesday they are afraid that restarting competitive matches could contribute to a fresh outbreak of the coronavirus in Spain.,"In a statement released independently of the club, Eibar's players and coaches said it would be impossible to physically distance themselves from each other, as recommended by the Spanish government. Eibar, who sit 16th in the table, are aware of the statement but have said they will still adhere to the timetable set out by La Liga for training and then matches to return. ""We are afraid to start an activity where we will not be able to meet the first recommendation of all experts, which is physical distancing,"" said Eibar's players and coaching staff in a statement. ""We are concerned that by doing what we love most, we could catch the virus, infect our family and friends, and even contribute to a new outbreak of the epidemic, with the terrible consequences that would have for the entire population. ""The priority must be the health of everyone and it is time for that idea to prevail with facts, not just words. Only with that clear premise would it make sense to return to competition. We ask for guarantees. We demand responsibility."" Later, La Liga defended the move to restart the campaign. ""Of course we understand that people have various emotions, including fear. This is an unprecedented time,"" it said in a statement. ""However, we are taking many precautions for a safe and controlled return of football. Playing football will be safer than, for example, going to the super market or pharmacy."" Players in the Spanish top-flight are undergoing tests and working individually at training grounds this week as part of a plan to move gradually into groups, with the aim of resuming games behind closed doors in June. Spain has been one of the worst-hit countries in the world by the coronavirus pandemic. There have been 25,613 deaths in the country, according to the latest figures on Tuesday. As part of the government's de-escalation programme, adults were allowed outside to exercise last weekend for the first time in seven weeks."
10,24/02/2020,03:14,Defiant Messi gives troubled Barca hope of Champions League glory,Lionel Messi has said Barcelona are not playing well enough to win this season's Champions League but his four goals against Eibar on Saturday were a reminder that with him there will always be hope.,"Barca play Napoli in the first leg of the last 16 on Tuesday and will be expected to go through, even if their opponents are on a strong run, having won six out of their last seven matches, including victories over Juventus and Inter Milan. Yet despite a whirlwind couple of months of political wrangling, remarkably Barcelona approach this tie sitting top of La Liga and with a spring in their step, in large part due to Messi. His quadruple in the 5-0 rout at Camp Nou on Saturday was cathartic and not only because Real Madrid, whom Barca face in the Clasico on Sunday, failed to regain first place after losing to Levante a few hours later. ""It was a win we needed,"" said coach Quique Setien. Messi has scored seven quadruples in his career but none executed amid such an intense time of pressure, with the spotlight on the Argentine. While other players might have sulked or crumbled, Messi delivered with another breathtaking performance that underlined his ability to drag this troubled team through even the most turbulent of periods. ""He's been in this form for 14 or 15 years and he keeps performing like this,"" said Setien. ""He's a guarantee for any club and for any coach and that's what makes him the best player in the world. He can do things that others can only dream about."" Messi could have had many reasons to feel upset but he hasn't let them affect his performances. Barcelona's board sacked Ernesto Valverde last month, despite Messi's public backing three days before, and failed to sign a striker in the transfer window with Luis Suarez and Ousamane Dembele both out injured. The club's technical secretary Eric Abidal then said the squad were the main reason for Valverde's departure while the president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, has been accused of hiring a PR company that criticised key players, including Messi, in a bid to improve his image online. Barcelona have denied the allegations but when asked in an interview with Mundo Deportivo last week if he was convinced, Messi said he would wait to see if they were true. He also admitted, ""the way we are at the moment, I don't think it's enough to win the Champions League"" and identified Real Madrid, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool as greater threats. Setien was more optimistic on Friday. ""There are things that I agree with and others evidently... I have seen every year how Champions Leagues are won and I think we could have the same chance as other teams,"" he said. ""It is true that there is no margin for error and there are things we have to try to improve and do better. We are not happy with everything but I think we are growing little by little and we are reaching levels that will allow us to challenge."" Yet if Messi were to win the Champions League this season, it would surely represent one of his most impressive achievements. With the likes of Frenkie de Jong and Arthur Melo in midfield and the excellent Marc-Andre ter Stegen in goal, they do not lack for talent but weaknesses in defence remain, not to mention a fragility against the counter-attack. And by appointing Setien, a coach devoted to a very particular style, Barcelona are having to change mid-season, with Setien admitting this month that it would take time for the players to understand his methods. ""It's not easy,"" said Messi. ""We come from playing under Valverde to playing differently now and being asked to do something else. The truth is we are learning and we still have a lot to learn."" But with in-form Napoli fast-approaching and then Madrid to come at the Santiago Bernabeu, time is not on Barcelona's side. For now, they will look to Messi."
11,22/02/2020,18:35,Messi scores four as Barcelona rout Eibar,Lionel Messi scored four goals as Barcelona began a crunch week in their season by thrashing Eibar 5-0 in La Liga on Saturday.,"Barca play away at in-form Napoli in the Champions League on Tuesday before facing title rivals Real Madrid next weekend, with pressure on the team, and Messi, amid a period of political turbulence at the club. Yet on the pitch, Messi showed no sign of distraction as the 32-year-old completed the second fastest of his now 36 career hat-tricks, after just 40 minutes at Camp Nou. Messi added a late fourth after being teed up by Martin Braithwaite, Barcelona's emergency signing who enjoyed an excellent cameo off the bench by claiming two assists, the second for Arthur Melo in injury-time. Braithwaite's contribution and Messi's return to form delivered a timely boost ahead of what could prove a pivotal few days in Barca's season. Messi had gone four games without a goal in La Liga, his longest drought since 2014, even if those matches saw him register five assists. He now has 22 goals in 28 appearances this term. And Braithwaite's arrival from Leganes on Thursday drew criticism after Barcelona capitalised on a curious La Liga rule that allows clubs to sign outside of the transfer window if they have lost a player to injury for more than five months. Leganes, without their top scorer, were beaten earlier by fellow strugglers Celta Vigo but Braithwaite made the perfect start with his new team, to suggest he could yet prove a useful addition during the run-in. Messi said in an interview with Mundo Deportivo last week that Barcelona, ""the way we are now"", will not have enough to go all the way in the Champions League, placing further doubts around the direction of the club on the back of his public spat with technical secretary Eric Abidal. The Argentinian also described as ""strange"" the allegations, which have been denied by the club, that president Josep Maria Bartomeu hired a PR company that has criticised Barca players, including Messi, on social media. Yet Saturday's victory means Quique Setien's side go top of La Liga, temporarily at least, with Real Madrid able to restore their one-point lead at the summit if they beat Levante later on Saturday. Whatever happens, the reward for the winner of the Clasico next weekend will now claim first place, in a meeting at the Santiago Bernabeu that could have a considerable psychological impact on the title race. With Napoli to come first in midweek in the Champions League last 16 first leg, Bartomeu will hope this result against Eibar sets the tone for recovery, particularly given the fans had waved white handkerchiefs, whistled and sang songs in protest against the club's president before kick-off. Messi quickly got to work, scoring a brilliant first goal in the 14th minute after collecting the ball centrally, around 30 yards out. He had three Eibar defenders in front of him but found a way through, nutmegging Anaitz Arbilla before chipping delicately into the corner. The second came in the 37th minute as Sergio Busquets found Arturo Vidal, who feathered a flick into Messi's path. Messi surged forward, past his stumbling opponents, and fired in. His third, three minutes later, was the simplest of the trio and arrived only after he tried to play in Antoine Griezmann. His generosity was rewarded as a sloppy Griezmann touch meant the ball cannoned back to Messi, who apologetically poked in. Setien was able to take Griezmann off with 18 minutes left and introduce Braithwaite for his debut. Braithwaite's first contribution was a skewed cross but things improved immeasurably from there, as two passes across goal gave Messi his fourth and Arthur his first."
12,19/05/2019,20:58,Barcelona's Semedo suffers concussion ahead of Copa del Rey final,"Barcelona added Nelson Semedo to their lengthy list of injury concerns on Sunday, six days before their Copa del Rey final against Valencia.","Full-back Semedo suffered a concussion during Barca's 2-2 draw with Eibar and joins Luis Suarez, Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Philippe Coutinho, Ousmane Dembele and Kevin-Prince Boateng in the group of players with fitness problems ahead of the final in Seville. ""Nelson Semedo has a head injury picked up in the game against Eibar,"" a club statement read. ""The player will remain overnight under observation in hospital in Bilbao. The player is expected to return to Barcelona on Monday."" Semedo was substituted at half-time against Eibar as Lionel Messi scored twice in Barcelona's final La Liga game of the season. Suarez will definitely miss the match against Valencia after undergoing surgery on a knee injury, while Dembele is also struggling with a hamstring strain. Coutinho hobbled off with a thigh problem against Getafe last weekend, although the club hope he will recover just in time for the final."
13,17/05/2019,02:15,Valencia seek perfect end to remarkable recovery in La Liga,Valencia lost to Arsenal in the Europa League semi-finals but hold pole position for La Liga's last Champions League spot as the race for the top four reaches its climax on Saturday.,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's hat-trick ended Valencia's hopes of qualifying by lifting a trophy and their chances looked slim in the league too, when they trailed Getafe by three points ahead of the penultimate weekend. But a 3-1 win over Alaves, combined with Getafe losing away to a wounded Barcelona, means it is Valencia with their fate in their own hands, as they prepare to face Real Valladolid at Jose Zorrilla. A superior head-to-head over Getafe means they need only match the result of Jose Bordelas' side, who host a Villarreal team sitting 14th and with little left to play for. Yet Valladolid's position appears in Valencia's favour too. Victory away at Rayo Vallecano last weekend means their safety is already secured. Win, and Valencia will be guaranteed Champions League football in consecutive seasons for the first time in seven years, a feat that not too long ago seemed almost unthinkable. After five games, they were 15th and still to win. After 10, they were 14th, having won once and scored seven goals. After 15 games, they had won three but were back in 15th, ground to a halt by nine draws. When Marcelino was appointed in 2017, he was the club's 12th coach in five years and only one of them -- Nuno Espirito Santo -- had overseen enough matches to make even one full league season. Most waited for the trigger to click but Marcelino stayed and after 10 draws in 13 games, they won, coming from behind in the Copa del Rey to beat Segunda B side Ebro, who had a man sent off after 29 minutes. ""There was this click,"" said striker Kevin Gameiro in an interview with AFP this month. ""And there was also a bit of luck."" Defeats by Girona, Juventus and Real Madrid tempered hopes of a recovery but in between came three victories in a row and after, five games unbeaten, including a Champions League win over Manchester United. Eighth in the table at the start of the year, Valencia then surged through March and April, 10 wins thrusting them within sight of the top four. ""The word surrender does not exist in my vocabulary,"" said Marcelino. They stumbled again, twice, defeated last month by Atletico Madrid and Eibar, the resurgence almost evaporating in the space of four days. But their rivals wobbled too as Getafe lost their nerve and Sevilla faded, the bounce from bringing in Joaquin Caparros to replace Pablo Machin proving short-lived. Sevilla's decision to act has them lying sixth, needing to win at home to in-form Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and needing both Valencia and Getafe to lose. Valencia's decision to persevere may be about to pay off, a top-four finish the perfect boost ahead of the Copa del Rey final on May 25 against Barcelona, who will be without Luis Suarez and perhaps goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. ""The spirit of the team has merged with the spirit of Valencia, which is always: never give up,"" said striker Rodrigo earlier this month. For Getafe, the Europa League would be a disappointment, even for a team who were promoted to the top flight only two years ago and whose annual wage bill is more than ten times less than Real Madrid, the club they hope to finish one place behind. ""Everything can still happen,"" said Bordalas. Getafe have a chance, which is perhaps more than can be said for Girona, whose players and coach Eusebio Sacristan conceded their loss at home to Levante last weekend had been decisive in the fight against relegation. ""All that's left is to say sorry,"" said an emotional Eusebio afterwards. ""I was convinced I could do it but I failed."" They are 18th, needing to make up three points and a six-goal deficit in goal difference to overtake Celta Vigo on the final day. Celta have the added advantage of hosting already-relegated Rayo Vallecano while Girona play at Alaves. Barcelona's title-winning campaign will end away at Eibar on Sunday just as Real Madrid's miserable season finishes at home to Real Betis."
14,20/04/2019,18:33,Atletico extend lead over Real with narrow win over Eibar,Atletico Madrid needed Thomas Lemar to come off the bench and score an 85th-minute winner against Eibar on Saturday as they stretched their lead over Real Madrid to seven points in La Liga.,"Real play at home to in-form Athletic Bilbao on Sunday but Atletico took another step towards finishing above their city rivals for a second consecutive year by squeezing past Eibar 1-0 at Ipurua. Without Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa, who were both suspended, Diego Simeone's side looked set for a stalemate that would have given Real at least a sniff of second place. Instead Lemar, on as a substitute, tucked home at the back post to end Eibar's resistance and reduce the gap behind run-away leaders Barcelona to six points. Eibar have now won only once in their last eight games and stay 13th. Barca host Real Sociedad later on Saturday and it would take an incredible collapse for the Catalans to be caught. If they beat Real Sociedad, Alaves on Tuesday and Levante next weekend, an eighth league title in 11 years will be confirmed. But, in the same week that goalkeeper Jan Oblak signed a new contract, this victory comes as another boost to morale for Atletico, who have now won four out of their last five matches. Lemar's goal will have done his confidence no harm either, after a difficult debut season with Atleti, who paid 60 million euros to sign the Frenchman from Monaco last summer. Simeone will hope for more from the 23-year-old next term. Atletico created the only real chance of the first half and Angel Correa missed it, slid through by the busy Alvaro Morata only to see his finish saved by the feet of Marko Dmitrovic. Morata should have scored himself shortly after half-time but dragged his shot wide of the far post while Koke's long-range effort had to be palmed over. Sergi Enrich might have nicked it for Eibar had Diego Godin not intercepted at the front post and when Godin drew another excellent save from Dmitrovic after heading Koke's free-kick towards the corner, it seemed the hosts would hang on for a point. But Eibar's defence was caught too high with five minutes left as Morata threaded Koke through and he crossed to the back post, where Lemar was free to score the winner."
15,06/04/2019,19:34,Zidane vague on Bale's future after scrappy win over Eibar,Zinedine Zidane refused to guarantee Gareth Bale's future at Real Madrid after the Welshman struggled again in a 2-1 victory over Eibar on Saturday.,"Karim Benzema scored twice at the Santiago Bernabeu as Madrid came from behind after Marc Cardona, starting only after an injury to Pedro Leon in the warm-up, gave Eibar a surprise lead. But Madrid improved and a pair of Benzema headers ensured the groans and whistles that had soured the atmosphere for much of the opening hour turned to cheers and applause at the end. Much of the frustration was again directed at Bale, who started here after being dropped by Zidane for the defeat to Valencia on Wednesday. Asked afterwards if Bale would be at Real Madrid next season, Zidane said: ""We'll see, I'm not going to tell you what's going to happen. Gareth is a Real Madrid player, he has two years left on his contract. We will see. It is not the time to talk about this."" Bale's below-par performances and a lack of support from either coach or fans seem so inter-linked now, it is difficult to know what comes first. He departed again to whistles with 14 minutes left, a conciliatory hand slap from Zidane offering little consolation as he trudged off. Benzema's trajectory has been the opposite, the Frenchman now with six goals in five La Liga games, four of them since Zidane took over. ""Karim has had a great season,"" Zidane said. ""His goals have perhaps changed people's perception of him. But he has never changed as a player."" Madrid's win means they are 10 points adrift of leaders Barcelona and two behind Atletico Madrid. Barca and Atletico play each other later on Saturday. Eibar stay 11th. Zidane has insisted his players are not on trial but his changing line-ups at least suggest he is examining his options before the summer. This time Sergio Ramos was rested, while Casemiro, Toni Kroos and Lucas Vazquez also dropped out. In came Nacho, Federico Valverde, Isco and Bale. Bale's half began badly as he failed to control Valverde's overhit pass and then got worse as he missed a one-on-one when his finish was saved by Marko Dmitrovic. The scattering of whistles became a chorus after he dragged a shot wide from 25 yards and it was no surprise his confidence drained away, a poor touch following shortly after. Bale was not the only one. Madrid lacked precision or purpose, as opponents were allowed through unchecked and passes went astray. In the 39th minute, as the fans' frustration was reaching its peak, Eibar scored, a crisp move down the left ending with a cute pass from Gonzalo Escalante to Cardona, who chipped into the net. The second half started better for Madrid, with Benzema scoring only to be called back for offside before the Frenchman headed in the equaliser just before the hour. Marco Asensio did brilliantly to weave into space and dig out the cross. Bale might have been in but Asensio's pass struck the back of his heel and the Welshman departed with 14 minutes left, to disgruntled whistles. Madrid scored the winner without him. Kroos' whipped cross was again met by the forehead of Benzema and, again, the ball found the net. Benzema should have completed his hat-trick late on but one finish was palmed away by Dmitrovic and another, with the goal gaping, looped over. He even hit the post with a bending effort in injury-time. The treble was not to be."
16,06/04/2019,18:44,Benzema double gives Madrid win over Eibar but Bale struggles again,Karim Benzema is one of the few Real Madrid players to have had his future guaranteed by Zinedine Zidane and he repaid his coach's faith on Saturday by scoring twice in a 2-1 win over Eibar.,"Madrid had to come from behind at the Santiago Bernabeu after a dismal first-half performance included Marc Cardona, playing after an injury to Pedro Leon during the warm-up, gave Eibar a surprise lead.

17,09/12/2018,23:30,Bale snaps drought as Real edge past struggling Huesca,Gareth Bale ended a run of 802 minutes without a goal in La Liga as Real Madrid won 1-0 at bottom side Huesca on Sunday to climb back to within five points of leaders Barcelona.,"The Welshman struck his first goal in the league since the start of September to lift Real to a fourth win in five matches and move the European champions up to fourth place. ""He (Bale) and the rest of the team were all fantastic. He scored a great goal and it was enough to get the win,"" said Real coach Santiago Solari. ""His goal and the general character of the team were crucial in taking all three points."" ""It wasn't a game to remember, but if you want to win La Liga, you have to win these matches,"" the Argentine added. Bale put a halt to his longest spell without scoring in the league since joining Real as he expertly cushioned in a volley from an arcing cross by Alvaro Odriozola on eight minutes. Huesca winger Ezequiel Avila forced a brilliant stop from Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, the Belgium international punching the ball to safety midway through the first half. Bale nearly added to his haul on 25 minutes when his fierce drive from the edge of the area was tipped over by a scrambling Aleksandar Jovanovic. Gonzalo Melero should have levelled for Huesca right after the break only to nod wide of the goal despite having the whole target at which to aim. A swerving David Ferreiro shot drew another smart save from Courtois as Real withstood a spirited fightback from the hosts, but Bale continued to threaten and forced two further saves from Jovanovic. Courtois turned over a late Moi Gomez free-kick and Huesca, who slumped to a 10th defeat in 15 games this season, were denied a point when Dani Carvajal headed off the line from Christian Rivera. Elsewhere, Borja Mayoral salvaged a point for Levante with a stoppage-time equaliser in a thrilling 4-4 draw away to Eibar. Eibar, who beat Madrid 3-0 in their last home game, led 4-2 with 15 minutes to play after a quick-fire brace by Charles added to goals from Sergi Enrich and Gonzalo Escalante. But Levante snatched a draw as Tono halved the deficit before Mayoral struck at the death. Real Betis shot up to seventh with a 2-0 home win over second-bottom Rayo Vallecano following goals by on-loan Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Giovani Lo Celso and Brazilian centre-back Sidnei. Real Valladolid won for the first time in six games as Toni Suarez and Antonito found the net in a 2-1 victory at Real Sociedad."
18,15/09/2018,18:41,Barcelona fight back to beat Real Sociedad,Barcelona came from behind to beat Real Sociedad on Saturday as Atletico Madrid lost further ground in the La Liga title race by drawing at home to Eibar.,"Seven points is now the gap between Atleti and Barca, who were in danger of slipping up themselves when Aritz Elustondo put Real Sociedad in front at Anoeta. But the hosts missed a series of excellent chances and paid the price, as two goals in three minutes from Luis Suarez and Ousmane Dembele clinched a hard-fought 2-1 win. ""The league is defined by these kind of games,"" Suarez said afterwards. ""Last year we also came back from 2-0 after many years without winning here. The reaction says a lot about this team."" Atletico rallied too, Borja Garces equalising with virtually the last kick of the game, but there were no celebrations at the Wanda Metropolitano. Garces' strike was enough only to rescue a 1-1 draw for Diego Simeone's side, who had looked on course for defeat when Eibar's Sergi Enrich bundled home in the 87th minute. Barcelona might easily have dropped points too had their opponents been more clinical. Mikel Oyarzabal and Theo Hernandez both could have made it 2-0 after half-time but the former blazed over and the latter was denied by Barca keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Within minutes, they were behind, as two crosses caused havoc in Real Sociedad´s defence, with Suarez and Dembele perfectly placed to pounce. Barca coach Ernesto Valverde had made the surprise decision to omit Sergio Busquets from his starting line-up, presumably with Tuesday´s Champions League opener against PSV Eindhoven in mind. But it was testament to the hosts' performance that Busquets was called upon in the second period after Philippe Coutinho had also been introduced at half-time. ""In the first half they closed us down well but Philippe coming on in the second half helped changed the dynamics,"" Suarez said. Simeone might also have liked to keep one eye on their Champions League game against Monaco on Tuesday, but a victory was much-needed following defeat to Celta Vigo two weeks ago. Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa, however, were both sloppy in the final third and Eibar might even have scored earlier, twice denied by the woodwork. It means Atleti have now recorded their worst league start since 2009. ""I would worry if we had not created those chances to score,"" Simeone said. ""The team also showed a reaction after their goal. We continued to push forward and managed to take a point."""
19,15/09/2018,15:21,Atletico held by Eibar to extend poor start,Atletico Madrid's stumbling start in La Liga took a turn for the worse on Saturday as a late equaliser from Borja Garces was only enough to rescue a 1-1 draw at home to Eibar.,"Eibar appeared to have snatched a shock victory when Sergi Enrich finished in the 87th minute, only for Borja to salvage Atletico a point with virtually the last kick of the game. But there were no celebrations at the final whistle. Atletico were considered serious title challengers this season but another two points dropped means they have now taken only five from their first four games. Real Madrid and Barcelona, who both play later on Saturday, could be seven points clear by the end of the day. Atleti created enough chances. They had 18 shots in total, but Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were both wasteful and as the game wore on, Eibar's confidence grew. Diego Simeone might have liked to keep one eye on their Champions League opener against Monaco on Tuesday, with this year's competition holding extra kudos for the club, because the final will be held here at the Wanda Metropolitano next June. But defeat to Celta Vigo two weeks ago left them five points adrift of Madrid and Barca, and while the season is still young, a victory here was much-needed to kickstart their campaign. Costa was available, after the striker missed Spain's two internationals for personal reasons, while summer signings, Thomas Lemar and Rodrigo, both came in. But Lemar, who was bought for 70million euros from Monaco, and should play against his former club in midweek, is yet to find his feet at Atleti and the Frenchman came off just before the hour-mark after a disjointed display, to muted applauds. Eibar could have taken the lead when a sizzling half-volley from Cote grazed the crossbar in the opening five minutes but that was close as they came in the first half, which was largely an impressive showreel of Atletico misses. Griezmann was guiltiest, first seeing a shot saved by Marko Dmitrovic with his feet and then failing to tee up Costa when he would have been better finishing himself. Saul, Diego Godin and Costa were all too imprecise to beat the imperious Dmitrovic but Koke had no excuse when he too feathered wide from six yards shortly after half-time. After yet another missed pass, Lemar was replaced by Angel Correa but as Atletico became frantic, Eibar could have capitalised, Anaitz Arbilla's drive again clipping the crossbar on its way over. With 20 minutes left, Griezmann raced clear but lashed the ball into Dmitrovic's body. It seemed the game could even end in defeat for Atletico when the ball landed perfectly for Enrich to smash in for Eibar from two yards. Borja, however, spared some of Atletico's blushes with a superb shot into the corner deep into injury-time but the roar from the crowd was short-lived. There was only disappointment at the final whistle."
20,05/05/2018,23:42,Villarreal boost Europa League hopes with late win over Valencia,Villarreal moved to within touching distance of qualifying for the Europa League after Mario Gaspar scored a late winner to beat rivals Valencia on Saturday.,"Gaspar headed in Manuel Trigueros' free-kick in the 86th minute at Estadio de la Ceramica to secure a dramatic 1-0 win over Valencia, who have also sealed their place in next season's Champions League. Valencia's place in the top four was guaranteed even before kick-off after Real Betis had earlier lost to Athletic Bilbao. Villarreal's victory means they will be guaranteed to finish in La Liga's top seven if Getafe, in eighth, fail to beat Las Palmas on Sunday. This season, the team that finishes seventh in the table will also qualify for the Europa League, as well as fifth and sixth, after Barcelona won the Copa del Rey. Valencia had the better of the chances in the first half but Santi Mina missed a one-on-one with Sergio Asenjo and they were made to pay the price. Trigueros swung in a cross from the left and Gaspar rose highest at the front post, flicking the ball with his head into the far corner. Villarreal could still finish fifth after Athletic Bilbao beat Betis thanks to two goals in the final 15 minutes from Iker Muniain and Aritz Aduriz. Celta Vigo's chances of playing European football next seasona are all-but over after they were held to a 1-1 draw by already-relegated Deportivo La Coruna. Girona's hopes were also diminished by a 4-1 defeat at home to Eibar."
21,18/02/2018,18:24,"Gameiro, Costa on target as Atletico keep up Barcelona chase",Kevin Gameiro came off the bench to score one goal and make another for Diego Costa as Atletico Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0 in La Liga on Sunday.,"It was another clinical performance from Diego Simeone's side, who have now recorded four consecutive league victories, all without their mean defence conceding a goal. They remain second, seven points behind unbeaten league leaders Barcelona, who won 2-0 at Eibar on Saturday ahead of their Champions League last 16, first leg away to Chelsea. Former Chelsea striker Costa returned for Atletico at the Wanda Metropolitano after injury prevented him from taking part in their 4-1 Europa League win over FC Copenhagen in Denmark on Thursday. Atletico created little in the first half to get the crowd of just over 60,000 out of their seats. However, they livened up after the restart, and in particular after Gameiro was sent on for Koke just before the hour mark. It was Atletico's French connection that led to the opening goal midway through the second half, with Antoine Griezmann setting up Gameiro, who took a touch before firing low past Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the far corner for his fifth league goal of the season. Gameiro then turned provider with a fine through ball for Costa, who fired home to secure the points with 10 minutes remaining, the goal his second in La Liga since returning to Spain. ""We are not stopping, we are playing well at the moment, and we are enjoying ourselves,"" said Gameiro when asked about his team's pursuit of Barcelona at the top of the table. Atletico, who have conceded a paltry nine goals in 24 La Liga games this season, will hope to stay within striking distance of Barcelona before going to the Camp Nou in a fortnight. Simeone's side are also nine points clear of third-placed Valencia, who came from behind to win 2-1 at bottom club Malaga on Saturday. Real Madrid, in fourth, are at Betis on Sunday evening. Earlier on Sunday, Real Sociedad beat struggling Levante 3-0 at Anoeta."
22,04/12/2017,18:59,Valencia outcast Orellana joins Eibar,"Valencia midfielder Fabian Orellana will join Eibar on loan until the end of the season, the Basque club confirmed on Monday.","The temporary move for the Chilean international will be made permanent if Eibar stay up at the end of the season. ""The interest of the club and their sporting project attracted me,"" said Orellana, who claimed to have turned down other offers. Orellana joined Valencia at the end of the January transfer window earlier this year from Celta Vigo after a falling out with then coach Eduardo Berizzo. However, he made just 17 appearances for Los Che and hasn't played a single minute since Marcelino Garcia Toral took charge this season. Orellana will have to wait until the new year to make his Eibar debut once the transfer window reopens in January. Eibar look well set to retain their top-flight status for a fifth straight season as three consecutive wins have taken them up to 13th, seven points clear of the drop zone."
23,22/10/2017,23:42,Routine win keeps Real pressure on Barca,Real Madrid moved back to within five points of La Liga leaders Barcelona with a hassle free 3-0 victory over Eibar on Sunday.,"Madrid have struggled at the Santiago Bernabeu this season, dropping points in four of their previous six home games. However, Eibar did most of the damage for them as Paulo Oliveira's own goal and a goalkeeping mistake from Marko Dmitrovic to allow Marco Asensio's shot through his grasp handed the European champions a 2-0 half-time lead. Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to pick up FIFA's 'The Best' award in London for his goals in helping Real land a Champions League and La Liga double for the first time in 59 years earlier in the year. Yet, the Portuguese's off colour La Liga form this season continued as it was Asensio who shone as his partner up front with Karim Benzema rested. ""It is obviouly better when Cristiano scores, but I am not worried,"" said Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane. ""The season is very long and if he is top scorer in the Champions League then bit-by-bit (his form) will return in La Liga."" Asensio teed up Isco inside two minutes only for Dmitrovic to parry the Spanish international's tame effort. Real's defending in the first period left a lot to be desired, but Eibar showed why they have only managed to score three times all season as their final ball continually let them down in dangerous areas. And the visitors didn't help themselves at the back either when Oliveira flicked a header into his own net from another Asensio delivery. Asensio then scored his first goal in two months with a low strike from Isco's cut-back that Dmitrovic should have stopped. Those two combined once more for Real's first chance of the second period, but again Isco placed his finish too close to Dmitrovic. Zidane had the luxury of bringing Benzema and Marcelo off the bench. And they combined to round off the scoring as Marcelo drilled the Frenchman's pass into the bottom corner eight minutes from time. Victory moves Real back above city rivals Atletico Madrid into third after Los Rojiblancos ground out a 1-0 win at Celta Vigo earlier on Sunday. Atletico's attacking options while they wait for Diego Costa's return in January have been much criticised in recent weeks, particularly after a 0-0 draw at Azerbaijani champions Qarabag on Wednesday left their chances of reaching the Champions League last 16 in peril. However, on his first league start of the season, Kevin Gameiro fired home a loose ball from a corner from close range on 28 minutes for the only goal of the game. ""I've come through a difficult time,"" Gameiro, who missed the start of the season through injury, told BeIN Sports Spain. ""Now that I am able to play, I can help the team and score goals."" Despite the sparse crowd at Balaidos caused by the closure of a stand on security grounds, Celta swarmed forward after the break. Jan Oblak produced fine saves to deny Iago Aspas and in stoppage time from John Guidetti, while Aspas also clipped the bar with a free-kick. Villarreal's revival under new coach Javier Calleja continued with a 4-0 thrashing of Las Palmas. Second-half strikes from Cedric Bakambu, Mario Gaspar and Nicola Sansone added to Ximo Navarro's own goal helped move the Yellow Submarine up to sixth. And Leganes sit fifth after Claudio Beauvue scored the only goal to beat off-form Athletic Bilbao 1-0."
24,20/09/2017,00:04,Messi hits four as Barca maintain perfect start,Lionel Messi added four more goals to his soaring early season tally as a much-changed Barcelona maintained their 100 percent start to La Liga by routing Eibar 6-1 on Tuesday.,"Paulinho and Denis Suarez also netted for the second consecutive game as Barca stretched their lead at the top of La Liga to seven points over Real Madrid, who host Real Betis on Wednesday. Earlier, Valencia moved up to third as Simone Zaza scored a seven-minute hat-trick in a 5-0 thrashing of Malaga. Barca boss Ernesto Valverde heavily rotated his side for the first time since taking charge with six changes from Saturday's hard-fought 2-1 win at Getafe. And contrary to their fortunes last season, Barca's back-ups proved Valverde can take the luxury of resting some of his star names with Paulinho particularly impressive on his first start. The hosts had goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen to thank early on for not falling behind though as he made a smart save when one-on-one with Sergi Enrich just four minutes in. Messi opened the scoring in nonchalant fashion from the penalty spot on 21 minutes after Nelson Semedo had been felled by an ungainly challenge from Alejandro Galvez. Paulinho's 40-million-euro ($48 million) signing from Guangzhou Evergrande was one of a series of moves that drew stinging criticism for Barca's board following Neymar's world-record departure for Paris Saint-Germain. However, after coming off the bench to score the winner at Getafe, Paulinho powered home his second Barca goal from Suarez's corner seven minutes before half-time. Paulinho also played his part in Barca's third with a cute dummy that freed Messi and, when his shot was parried by Marko Dmitrovic, Suarez fired home the rebound. Enrich reduced the arrears when he capitalised on some sloppy Barca defending to slot home David Junca's cross. However, Messi quickly restored Barca's three-goal lead with a lovely measured finish from the edge of the box. The five-time world player of the year completed his 43rd career hat-trick just after the hour mark by prodding through Dmitrovic's legs from Paulinho's pass. And he added his 12th goal in just eight games this season three minutes from time after a neat one-two with Aleix Vidal. Barca lead second-placed Sevilla, who host Las Palmas on Wednesday, by five points with Valencia now just a point further adrift as their unbeaten start to the season under new coach Marcelino Garcia Toral continued at Mestalla. By contrast, a fifth straight defeat to start the season sees Malaga slip to bottom of the table and plunges coach Michel into further danger of becoming the second La Liga boss to be sacked this term. ""I am tremendously proud of the performance of the players. It is a joy to be able to enjoy it with our fans,"" said Marcelino. Santi Mina got the rout started after just 17 minutes with a neat header from Carles Soler's cross. Zaza then completed his first ever hat-trick with three clinical close-range finishes between the 55th and 62nd minute before substitute Rodrigo rounded off the scoring. And the former Juventus striker shrugged off a bust-up with Marcelino after being dropped for Saturday's 1-1 draw at Levante. ""I didn't have anything to prove,"" Zaza told BeIN Sports Spain. ""What happened on Saturday is already forgotten, I think it is normal that a player is angry when he doesn't play."""
25,04/03/2017,19:57,Harsh words sparked Real Madrid response - Ramos,Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos acknowledged a team meeting following the European champions' recent slump was key to their reaction in a 4-1 win over Eibar on Saturday.,"Madrid put Wednesday's 3-3 draw at home to Las Palmas behind them as despite missing Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, a double from Karim Benzema and further goals from James Rodriguez and Marco Asensio ensured a comfortable afternoon in the Basque country. ""We spoke about a few things that obviously haven't come out and I'm happy about that because they belong in the dressing room,"" said Ramos. The Spanish international denied reports that he had told teammates only Ronaldo was exempt from running for the team due to his exceptional goalscoring record. ""Here we all have to run from first to last. There are no untouchable players,"" he added. ""We are all equal and I think that is the key to the competition within the group. ""You saw that today. Players that haven't had a lot of minutes, like Danilo, Lucas Vazquez or Asensio are desperate to play. They are hungry and that is going to help us aspire to winning titles."" Madrid's slip-up in midweek had allowed Barcelona to go top of the table, albeit having played a game more than Real. Victory at Ipurua moved Zinedine Zidane's men back two points clear of their title rivals, although Barca can retake top spot with a win at home to Celta Vigo later on Saturday. ""With Barca leading we were obliged to win here at a difficult place to come,"" said Ramos. ""The team had a very clear idea of what we had to do from the first second to win the game. We had to press in their half of the field, win the second balls which was fundamental and in the end we are happy with a job well done."" Midfielder Casemiro claimed Madrid are almost unbeatable if they maintain the attitude they showed in Eibar. ""If we start as motivated in every game, with the quality we have, it is almost impossible for us to lose,"" the Brazilian told BeIN Sports Spain. And Casemiro wants a repeat performance when Madrid travel to Napoli defending a 3-1 lead for the second leg of their Champions League last 16 tie on Tuesday. ""In football you have the chance to change the script every three days. We have changed and returned to being Real Madrid again... we will go to Napoli stronger."""
26,06/01/2017,03:00,Exemplar Eibar show 'another way' in money-driven sport,"In a league dominated by the wealth of the two richest clubs in the world, Spanish side Eibar are punching above their weight to show ""another kind of football is possible"".","A town of just 27,000 people sandwiched between Bilbao and San Sebastian in the northern Basque region is enjoying a third consecutive season of top-flight football as the likes of Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo pass through their 6,200 capacity Ipurua stadium. Despite their limitations Eibar are far from just making up the numbers and they host Atletico Madrid this weekend just two places and five points behind the Champions League finalists, in eighth. Eibar believe they can be a model for modest clubs all over Europe. ""With little money Eibar have done a lot,"" said Juan Carlos Castaneda Aguirre, proud president of supporters club La Casa de Cantabria. ""We have a lot of heart."" From the president to the fans, Eibar have used their heads to defy the odds since promotion to La Liga for the first time in their history in 2014. No sooner had Eibar won promotion, they had to raise 1.7 million euros ($1.4 million) to comply with new Spanish football regulations to safeguard the finances of all clubs. Failure to raise the funds would have seen Eibar denied promotion and relegated to the third tier -- despite being one of very few Spanish clubs not burdened by debt. A crowd-funding campaign called ""defend Eibar"" saw the club's number of shareholders grow from just 1,800 locally to 10,000 across the world with the help of high-profile figures such as then-Real Madrid and now Bayern Munich midfielder Xabi Alonso. ""Eibar were only known here. We created a story and we were able to sell shares in Eibar in 69 countries across the world,"" said ex-president Alex Aranzabal, who oversaw the campaign. The money raised ensured Eibar could compete in La Liga and their financial prudence eventually paid off at the end of their debut season. Despite finishing in the bottom three after a disastrous second half of the season on the pitch Eibar were saved from relegation as Elche, who finished 13th, were demoted for unpaid tax debts. Since then Eibar have gone from strength-to-strength. A new collective television deal has seen the club's budget grow from 18 million euros in their debut top-flight season to 43 million euros this year. The side coached by Jose Luis Mendilibar are still living in a different world to the 630-million-euro budget enjoyed by European champions Real Madrid or 695 million euros over at Barcelona. However, that hasn't prevented them from playing David to their Goliath on the field. In October, Eibar held Madrid 1-1 at the latter's Santiago Bernabeu. ""To see a team from a town like this play against the best team in the world and draw shows that another kind of football is possible,"" added Aranzabal. ""People in football normally look for results in the short term. The Eibar model isn't a short-term one, it is a solid model that tries to build a strong project, but that needs time. ""I am convinced that the same thing we have done at Eibar can be done in other places in Spain, France, Germany or England."" Most of all, football has given a once-booming industrial town -- thanks to an old arms factory -- something to be proud of again. ""Eibar is a small club, but they have values. It is a true family,"" said defender French Florian Lejeune, who has the unenviable task of stopping Atletico star and compatriot Antoine Griezmann on Saturday. ""They are a serious club that are showing good things, that is stable and manages money well."""
27,11/08/2016,14:03,Swansea announce club-record Borja move,"Spanish striker Borja Baston has joined Swansea City from Atletico Madrid for a club-record fee of 15.5 million pounds ($20.1 million, 18 million euros), the Premier League side announced on Thursday.","The 23-year-old signed a four-year contract after successfully undergoing a medical and will wear the number 10 shirt at the Liberty Stadium. He eclipses Wilfried Bony as Swansea's record signing. The Welsh club paid 12 million pounds to sign Bony from Vitesse Arnhem in 2013. ""There is pressure, but it is good pressure,"" Borja told the Swansea website. ""I want to repay the transfer fee paid for me with good performances and results. It's difficult to set a target of goals, but my mantra is take it goal by goal. Hopefully I can score a lot of goals. ""It is the most important decision of my career. I want to settle and spend several years here. I am very happy to be here. I am eager to contribute to the success of the team."" Borja joins compatriot and fellow striker Fernando Llorente at the Liberty and becomes head coach Francesco Guidolin's seventh signing of the close season. He could make his debut in Swansea's Premier League opener at Burnley on Saturday. Borja came through the youth system at Atletico, making one first-team appearance in 2010, and has spent time on loan at Murcia, Huesca, Deportivo La Coruna, Real Zaragoza and Eibar. Capped up to under-19 level, he scored 18 goals for Eibar last season, making him the third-highest Spanish scorer in La Liga."
28,06/03/2016,17:54,Messi double keeps Barca record rolling,A Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona tightened their grip on the La Liga title race with a comprehensive 4-0 win at Eibar on Sunday to open up an 11-point lead at the top.,"Munir El Haddadi tapped home the opener from Luis Suarez's cross before Messi doubled Barca's advantage with a brilliant individual effort just before half-time. Messi doubled his tally from the penalty spot before Suarez lashed home the fourth six minutes from time. Barca's 11th consecutive league win also stretches their record unbeaten run to 36 games. Atletico Madrid can close the gap at the top to eight points when they visit Gary Neville's Valencia later on Sunday. Real Madrid remain 12 points adrift of Barca in third despite Cristiano Ronaldo's four-goal show in a 7-1 demolition of Celta Vigo on Saturday. ""It is evident we are well-positioned in the league, but there are plenty of points to play for and meetings with direct rivals to come,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""I am very happy to see the team evolve and improve without ever losing their ambition."" The European champions were without the suspended Neymar, who made the most of his free weekend to return to his native Brazil. However, El Haddadi made the most of his rare chance to start with a simple finish at the back post eight minutes in after Messi's brilliant pass had played in Suarez behind the Eibar defence. Suarez was surpassed by Ronaldo in the fight to be La Liga's top scorer and the Uruguayan look determined to hit back early on, but fluffed his lines with just Abel Riesgo to beat two minutes later. El Haddadi should have teed up Suarez for a tap-in from another Messi through ball midway through the half, but the youngster overhit his pass and the ball slipped just wide. Eibar then enjoyed a concerted period of pressure and were desperately unlucky not to level when Borja Baston's cross hit Sergio Busquets and flew inches past the far post. Yet, just when Eibar looked the most likely to score, Messi killed the game as a contest as he intercepted the ball in midfield and drove towards the Eibar goal before firing into the far corner for his 20th league goal of the season. The second half was far shorter on goalmouth action, but there was time for Messi to put Barca's recent troubles from the penalty spot behind him when Ivan Ramis blocked the Argentine's cross with his hand. Messi took responsibility after Suarez had missed from the spot against Rayo Vallecano in midweek and coolly dispatched the penalty for his 35th goal of the season. And Suarez finally got the goal he craved to move back to within one of Ronaldo in the scoring charts with a brilliant nutmeg of Capa before smashing the ball into the far corner. That goal also took Suarez, Messi and Neymar's combined tally for the season to 100."
29,29/11/2015,18:30,Benitez hails hard-working Madrid bounceback win,Real Madrid coach Rafael Benitez lauded his players' work rate despite another underwhelming display as they beat Eibar 2-0 on Sunday to close to within six points of Barcelona at the top of La Liga.,"Gareth Bale's first Madrid goal in three months just before half-time and Cristiano Ronaldo's late penalty got Real back to winning ways a week after being humiliated 4-0 at home by Barca. And Benitez hinted that a lack of hard work may have been at the root of Madrid's inferiority last weekend as he was quick to praise the difference in attitude of his players at Ipurua. ""A victory like today is a win for the team. A victory thanks to the work of everyone who has participated, including those who came on to lend a hand,"" said Benitez. ""The important thing was to get the three points and do so with this spirit of sacrifice. ""The fans know that the most important thing when you have players of this quality is that they also work as they did today. That is the key if we want to continue being strong in the future."" Barcelona's sensational form of late spearheaded by Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar has seen many write off Madrid's title chances just 13 games into the campaign. However, Benitez warned that after a spate of early season injuries, his side will get stronger as the season wears on. ""We are in November. We have missed a lot of players through injury and the team is recovering players slowly but surely. ""I am still optimistic and think we have a great team to keep fighting in every game until the end."""
30,27/11/2015,01:35,Madrid seek Clasico redemption at humble Eibar,"Real Madrid will be hoping a change of scenery provides an upturn in fortunes when they travel to Basque minnows Eibar's 6,000 capacity Ipurua on Sunday aiming to make amends for their 4-0 humiliation by Barcelona.","Club president Florentino Perez insisted he still has full confidence in coach Rafael Benitez despite both being targeted by the Madrid fans with calls to resign last weekend. That confidence was unlikely to have been assured, though, by a nervous final 15 minutes in Ukraine on Wednesday as Madrid slipped from cruising into a 4-0 lead away to Shakhtar Donetsk to holding on for a 4-3 win. Benitez made a series of changes in Lviv with Brazilian midfielder Casemiro one of those to come in to add extra bite to the midfield. And he insists they must look ahead in trying to close the six-point gap to Barca at the top of the table rather than dwelling on the problems on and off the field over the past week. ""The defeat to Barcelona is in the past, we need to look forward. Now we have a tough game away from home,"" he said ""I am here for what Benitez tells me to do, he is a great coach. We are with him, with the president and the fans. Staying together I am sure we will win."" However, Madrid can expect an extremely tricky test against an Eibar side that are surpassing all expectations on just their second season in the top flight and currently sit sixth. ""It is difficult for any team to play at Ipurua. We are playing really well and have the confidence that we can get something positive from the game,"" Eibar midfielder Adrian Gonzalez told the club's website. Madrid have mounting injury problems in defence as Raphael Varane came off against Shakhtar with a hamstring problem, whilst Sergio Ramos and Marcelo are also out. Isco is banned after his frustrated kick out at Neymar last weekend. However, Eibar are also without one of their key creators through suspension in Keko Gontan. In contrast to Madrid's woes, Barcelona's week just got better after inflicting a thrashing at the Bernabeu as they stuck six past Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday. Lionel Messi scored twice on his first start following a two-month injury layoff as did Luis Suarez to take Messi, Suarez and Neymar's combined tally for the calendar year to an incredible 121. Yet, Barca boss Luis Enrique urged for caution amid claims Barca could go onto repeat their treble winning feats of last season. ""These players are very intelligent and they know perfectly that we are in the first third of the season and the best is still to come. ""It is a pleasure when you have the profile of the players we have and things go as you want. I am sure that at some point it will turn in the other direction and you need to be prepared to overcome all the moments."" Next in Barca's firing line are Real Sociedad at the Camp Nou on Saturday. However, Sociedad did make a good start to life under former Barca B coach Eusebio Sacristan with a 2-0 win over Sevilla in their first game since the sacking of David Moyes. The on-form Sergi Roberto is a doubt for Barca, but Javier Mascherano and Andres Iniesta are expected to return after being left out in midweek. Atletico Madrid are Barcelona's closest challengers at the top of the table and Diego Simeone's men will be confident of holding onto second place when they host Espanyol hoping to extend a nine-game unbeaten run. Meanwhile, Sevilla and Valencia meet on Sunday night hoping to get their lacklustre seasons going with both coaches Unai Emery and Nuno Espirito Santo's jobs under pressure.

""I've had three wonderful seasons here. My time at Eintracht will always remain a wonderful memory,"" said Inui.

34,22/05/2015,02:19,"Relegation, Europe to play for on Liga final day","Almeria, Deportivo la Coruna, Eibar and Granada will fight it out to avoid the two remaining relegation places when the Spanish league season comes to a close on Saturday.","The makeup of Spain's representatives in next season's Champions League will also be decided with Valencia and Sevilla still vying for fourth place, whilst Atletico Madrid need a point to secure third and avoid a tricky qualifier in August. Deportivo and Granada hold the advantage in the battle to avoid the drop as they lead Eibar and Almeria by two points. However, they both face tough tasks this weekend as Depor travel to champions Barcelona, whilst in-form Granada host Atletico. ""It is difficult to get anything at the Camp Nou. We are facing the best team in the world, but we need to show that we are playing for our lives,"" said Deportivo striker Oriol Riera. ""For us there is no other game. This is the one that will decide where we will play next season."" Barca, though, may not be in a forgiving mood despite having the title sewn up as the Camp Nou is expected to pay homage to Xavi Hernandez on his final league game for the club after a 17-year playing career. Having previously won just twice in the league since September, Granada have won their last three games since Jose Ramon Sandoval took charge earlier this month to keep their survival hopes alive. ""A month ago it was almost impossible to survive and now we are just one game away from achieving it. A draw could do us and everyone believes we will do it,"" said midfielder Ruben Perez, who looks set to feature against his parent club. Atletico will definitely achieve their objective of qualification for the Champions League group stages with a point, but could still be usurped should they lose and Valencia win at Almeria. ""It is difficult to think that one game could define a season, but it is true that for us this point is very important,"" added Atletico midfielder Tiago. Almeria's chances of staying up could be decided both on the pitch and in the court room in the coming days. Even should they beat Los Che to avoid the drop, a final decision on whether they are to be docked three points for unpaid sums to Danish club Aalborg for the transfer of Michael Jakobsen in 2010 will be made by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Tuesday. A Valencia slip-up in Almeria would also have consequences at the top as Sevilla could move into fourth with victory at Malaga. However, Sevilla also have a second chance at Champions League qualification as they will go straight into next season's group stages even if they finish fifth should they retain the Europa League against Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk on Wednesday. On paper, Eibar have by far the easiest task on Saturday when they host the already relegated Cordoba. The Basque minnows have won just one of their last 19 La Liga games, but remain confident of surviving in their first ever season in the top flight with a little help from Barcelona and Atletico. ""Barcelona are in good form and will want a good goodbye for Xavi and Atletico Madrid are playing for third place,"" said goalkeeper Xabier Irureta. ""We need to do our job and wait and see. If things go as normal then we have a great chance of staying up."" Athletic Bilbao can also seal the final Europa League place with victory at home to Villarreal. The Basques are currently seventh, which would yield a European place if Barca beat them in the Copa del Rey final next weekend. Anything other than a win, though, would allow Malaga to snatch seventh by beating Sevilla. Meanwhile, at the Santiago Bernabeu, Carlo Ancelotti could take charge of his final match as Real Madrid coach when Los Blancos play out a meaningless final game of the campaign against Getafe."
35,11/04/2015,18:00,Ronaldo fires Madrid to within a point of Barca,Cristiano Ronaldo took his tally for the season to 49 as Real Madrid cut the gap on La Liga leaders Barcelona to just a point with a comfortable 3-0 win over Eibar.,"Ronaldo opened the scoring with his first free-kick goal for nearly a year before Javier Hernandez crowned a rare start with the second before half-time. Madrid eased up after the break ahead of their Champions League quarter-final against Atletico Madrid in midweek, but there was still time for Jese Rodriguez to fire home a third eight minutes from time. Barcelona face a stiff test if they are to regain their four-point lead at the top as they travel to Sevilla later on Saturday. Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti had handed outings to Hernandez, Jese, Asier Illarramendi and Keylor Navas, making six changes from Wednesday's 2-0 win over Rayo Vallecano. James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos were out suspended, whilst Gareth Bale missed the game through injury. The hosts took their time to get going, but were only denied the opener in incredible fashion on 19 minutes as Sergio Ramos' initial shot came off the bar, Isco's follow-up effort then came off both posts and Hernandez was flagged offside as he fired in the rebound. Madrid only had to wait four more minutes to make the breakthrough as Ronaldo's swerving free-kick flummoxed Xabi Irureta to end a run of 56 attempts at goal from free-kicks without scoring for the World Player of the Year. The Portugal captain should have had a second moments later as he sliced Hernandez's fine low cross wide at the end of a lightning quick counter-attack from the European champions. Hernandez then got the goal his performance deserved as the Manchester United loanee headed Alvaro Arbeloa's cross into the far corner. Irureta made amends for his earlier mistake by making a fine save to deny Ronaldo low to his left just before half-time and also showed good hands to trap Luka Modric's volley soon after the restart. Ancelotti then took the opportunity to replace Ramos, Luka Modric and Marcelo with one eye on Real's return to Champions League action away to Atletico on Tuesday. Hernandez should have had his second of the afternoon 15 minutes from time when he turned Pepe's knockdown goalwards, but Mikel Arrubarrena managed to divert the ball over the bar. Instead it was Jese who rounded off the scoring on his first start of the season with a purposeful run into the area before firing low across Irureta into the far corner."
36,21/11/2014,02:20,Real Madrid giants enter land of Eibar's little people,"Real Madrid's superstars, flying high at the top of La Liga, enter the land of Spanish football's little people on Saturday when they take on humble Eibar in the Basque country.","Unlike Real's cavernous, fabled Bernabeu with its 85,000-capacity, Eibar's Ipurua stadium has room for just 5,000 fans -- they have had to build temporary seating to accommodate fans wanting to see Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. The contrast between the two adversaries is also highlighted by their respective budgets -- 10-time European champions Real are worth 500 million euros. Eibar, promoted last season, survive on 30 times less. Despite the gulf in class and financial resources, Eibar have not been intimidated in La Liga where they sit comfortably in mid-table. ""At the Ipurua, we can cause trouble for anybody,"" said Eibar midfielder Saul Berjon. However, Real are expected to keep rolling on as they start the weekend with a two-point lead over Barcelona. They are undefeated in 13 matches in all competitions, scoring 52 goals and conceding just eight, although their planning for the trip to Eibar hasn't been helped by a thigh injury to influential midfielder Luka Modric. He will be out for around three months after picking up the injury while on international duty with Croatia. ""It's a big blow for the club because Luka had been in great form,"" said German team-mate Toni Kroos. Barcelona host Sevilla, who are just two points behind them, facing a potential crisis of confidence having seen a six-point lead over Real disappear over the autumn. Luis Enrique's team now face a testing stretch of games -- after Sevilla, they travel to Apoel Nicosia in the Champions League, go to Valencia, face a derby against Espanyol before completing their European duties against Paris Saint Germain. That game is likely to decide top spot in Group F and a seeded spot in the knockout round in the new year. ""We must get back to rediscovering beautiful football which characterises the team,"" said Enrique, whose gamble on signing Luis Suarez has yet to pay dividends with the controversial Uruguayan striker still seeking a first league goal. Superstar Lionel Messi did little to calm Barcelona nerves this week when he gave an interview to an Argentine newspaper where he said he wished to remain at the Camp Nou but that ""sometimes, things don't go the way you want them to"". Messi is without a goal in three matches in La Liga but on Saturday he once again gets a chance to go past Telmo Zarra's record of 251 goals to become the leading all-time scorer in the history of the league. Meanwhile, seven months after being sacked by Manchester United, David Moyes returns to the dugout as coach of Real Sociedad with a trip to Deoprtivo La Coruna in store for the Scot. Valencia are at Levante where they find themselves in the midst of a bizarre legal wrangle. News website Plaza Deportiva reported the club are in dispute with DC Comics in the United States who claim that the club's bat logo infringes their Batman design."
