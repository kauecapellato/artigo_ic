0,10/02/2021,21:09,Marseille claim 'welcome' French Cup win,"Crisis-hit Marseille eased to a ""welcome"" first victory since suspending coach Andre Villas-Boas by beating second-tier Auxerre 2-0 in the French Cup last 64 on Wednesday.","Argentina striker Dario Benedetto, with his just his fifth goal in 29 games this season, and Ahmadou Dieng found the net for Marseille. ""Qualification is welcome in the period that we are going through, we are in a tough place,"" said stand-in coach Nasser Larguet. ""There was not a great quality of play, but on the other hand, there was great team spirit, lots of energy, we saw the boys put in maximum effort. ""And then the satisfaction of seeing Dario Benedetto score his goal, it had been a while. The players remained united until the end."" Marseille had blown a two-goal lead to draw with Lens and lost 2-0 to arch-rivals Paris Saint-Germain since Villas-Boas was suspended following comments made after a defeat by Monaco. The principality side also booked their spot in the last 32, as Stevan Jovetic scored in a 1-0 win at Grenoble. Ligue 1 leaders Lille reached the next round as 19-year-old Guinean midfielder Aguibou Camara's early goal secured a 1-0 victory over Dijon. Lille, who have not even reached the Cup semi-finals since winning the double in 2010-11, sit two points clear of Lyon at the summit of the top-flight table. News of the sacking of Nantes coach Raymond Domenech emerged during the Canaries' 4-2 loss to Lens, with the former France boss missing the game after a positive Covid-19 test. Holders PSG start their trophy defence later on Wednesday with a game at Ligue 2 outfit Caen."
1,08/02/2021,14:20,"Bayern fume, Mbappe flies, Zlatan's milestone: European talking points","Bayern Munich's preparation for the Club World Cup was disrupted despite victory, Kylian Mbappe rediscovered his supersonic speed and Lionel Messi starred from the bench, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic notched his 500th club goal at the weekend.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Bayern Munich's weekend started well, Kingsley Coman's deflected strike securing a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin on Friday as they maintained a seven-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga from RB Leipzig. They then boarded a plane for Qatar in preparation for a night flight to the Club World Cup, but the necessary de-icing of the aircraft meant they were refused permission for take-off due to a ban on flights between midnight and 7:00 am. That meant a departure seven hours later than planned, ruining plans to train on Saturday and hampering preparations for Monday's semi-final against Al Ahly. ""Those in charge (at the airport) don't have an inkling of what they've done to our team,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. ""Of course it was not optimal,"" said Joshua Kimmich. ""Nonetheless I think that we will be able to win the match."" It was what made Kylian Mbappe so breathtaking when he first broke through but it was something that had not been seen so often this season. On Sunday the France star produced a stunning sprint to finish off a counter-attack and score Paris Saint-Germain's opener in a 2-0 win at Marseille. Mbappe's run was clocked at an incredible 36 kilometres per hour, but he managed to slow down enough to control Angel di Maria's pass and score his 16th Ligue 1 goal this season, as PSG stayed third, three points behind leaders Lille. ""The feeling is coming back because I am playing every game now,"" said Mbappe, who was often on the bench in Thomas Tuchel's final matches in charge but has hardly missed a minute under new coach Mauricio Pochettino. ""I am finishing games stronger. I am not so burnt out. It can only be a good thing."" PSG's Champions League last 16, first leg in Barcelona is just eight days away. The last time Lionel Messi came off the bench in La Liga, he was introduced at half-time and scored twice in a 5-2 win over Betis. On Sunday he again came on as a substitute against Betis, this time in the 57th minute. Moments later he scored Barcelona's equaliser, and he then played a key part in their second before fellow substitute Francisco Trincao's late strike secured a 3-2 win. Messi was rested at the start along with Frenkie de Jong and Pedri, with coach Ronald Koeman appearing to prioritise Wednesday's Copa del Rey semi-final, first leg at Sevilla, and with the PSG Champions League tie approaching too. Barca, like Real Madrid, are seven points behind La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid, who have two games in hand and play on Monday against Celta Vigo. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's brace was key in setting AC Milan on the way to a 4-0 win over Crotone that kept them two points clear of Inter atop Serie A, but it also saw the former Sweden striker reach a remarkable milestone. The goals were his 500th and 501st at club level since starting out with Malmo in 1999. Now 39, he is in his second spell with Milan and his hoping to win a second Scudetto with the Rossoneri, after starring in their 2011 title triumph. Ibrahimovic scored 14 goals that season and already has 14 this season, in just 11 appearances. Mesut Ozil made his second substitute appearance in five days for new club Fenerbahce but could not help turn Istanbul's Intercontinental derby, as Galatasaray headed back to the European side of the Bosphorus with a 1-0 win. Ozil had helped set up a goal in Fenerbahce's 2-1 win at Hatayspor last Wednesday. Against Galatasaray, the ex-Arsenal man came on for the last 27 minutes with Fenerbahce already trailing. It is shaping up to be quite a title run-in in Turkey, with Galatasaray, Besiktas and Fenerbahce all level on 48 points at the top."
2,07/02/2021,23:52,"Mbappe sparks PSG win over Marseille, but Lille top in France","Kylian Mbappe set Paris Saint-Germain on the way to a 2-0 win over troubled Marseille on Sunday, keeping the reigning champions within three points of Ligue 1 leaders Lille who earlier recorded their sixth consecutive victory.","Mbappe burst through at incredible pace to give PSG the lead on the counter-attack in the ninth minute at the Velodrome, with Mauro Icardi adding a second for Mauricio Pochettino's side. The victory was achieved despite Neymar -- who celebrated his 29th birthday on Friday -- only appearing as a substitute having missed training with a stomach bug. PSG stay third, a point behind Lyon and three adrift of Lille, who won 2-0 at Nantes. Marseille finished with 10 men after Dimitri Payet's late sending-off, and are down in ninth having won just once in 11 games. The Parisians go to Barcelona in the Champions League on February 16 but Mbappe insisted their thoughts remained on domestic matters as they first play in the French Cup in midweek and then host Nice next weekend. ""In previous years we might have been able to concentrate more on the Champions League but this year we really need to stay focused on the league because we are trailing,"" the World Cup winner told broadcaster Canal Plus. ""But maybe that's not a bad thing because we are forced to play with intensity in every game and that can mean that you're not taken by surprise when it comes to the Champions League."" 'Le Classique' is the biggest fixture in French football, and the build-up to the 100th meeting of Marseille and PSG had been dominated by recent events in the Mediterranean city. Marseille's game last weekend against Rennes was postponed after several hundred supporters attacked the club's training ground, and three days later coach Andre Villas-Boas was suspended by the club after declaring at a press conference he wanted to resign. Nasser Larguet, the head of Marseille's youth academy, took charge for Wednesday's draw at Lens and was again on the bench against PSG. The last league meeting of the teams in September was won 1-0 by Marseille, but was marred by five late red cards, including for Neymar. The Brazilian later accused Marseille defender Alvaro Gonzalez of racism, although no action was taken due to a lack of evidence. Ligue 1 top scorer Mbappe sprinted onto Angel di Maria's pass to control and fire past Steve Mandanda for the opener, his 16th of the season. Canal Plus clocked Mbappe's stunning sprint at 36 kilometres per hour. Di Maria then hobbled off injured, before Icardi made it 2-0 midway through the first half. Icardi got in front of Alvaro to meet Alessandro Florenzi's cross, the ball coming off the back of his neck and looping into the net. Icardi was replaced by Neymar midway through the second half, with the Brazilian immediately becoming involved in a flashpoint with Alvaro. The Spaniard was lucky only to concede a corner rather than a penalty as he tried to stop the world's most expensive player, but Alvaro did jar his knee in the process and came off soon after. The home side then had Payet dismissed for a high boot on Marco Verratti. Canada's Jonathan David continued his recent scoring streak with a brace as Lille saw off Nantes to reclaim top spot from Lyon, who beat Strasbourg 3-0 on Saturday. David has five goals in as many games after pouncing on a defensive mix-up to put Lille in front early on and then scoring a fantastic second seven minutes from time following a one-two with Renato Sanches. ""We are on a magnificent run but nobody is pulling away because everyone is winning,"" said Lille coach Christophe Galtier. Struggling Nantes have gone 15 matches without a win, including seven games under Raymond Domenech, the former France coach who was appointed in December. Earlier Aleksandr Golovin scored a hat-trick on his first start since August after injury as fourth-placed Monaco defeated bottom club Nimes 4-3 to extend their winning run to seven matches. Golovin also set up Kevin Volland for Monaco's fourth."
3,06/02/2021,16:32,PSG's Pochettino 'hopeful' over stomach-bug victim Neymar for Marseille,Paris Saint-Germain coach Mauricio Pochettino said on Saturday he is optimistic Neymar will feature in the weekend's trip to arch-rivals Marseille despite the Brazil attacker suffering from a stomach bug,"PSG head to the Velodrome on Sunday for the 100th meeting between the outfits and three points off leaders Lille, who travel to Nantes earlier on. ""Neymar's suffering from gastroenteritis, like a lot of people can suffer from. We will assess his state tomorrow, and we hope he will recover enough to be in the squad,"" Pochettino told a press conference. While the world's most expensive player could still make it PSG will definitely be missing goalkeeper Keylor Navas who has an adductor issue and Thimothee Pembele who has contracted Covid-19. Italy midfielder Marco Verratti has recovered from the virus but Spain playmaker Ander Herrera remains sidelined for the tie against a side in turmoil. Marseille are without a win in a month, supporters invaded the training complex and coach Andre Villas-Boas resigned in midweek."

5,02/02/2021,16:59,Villas-Boas 'suspended' by Marseille after offering to resign in transfer row,"Andre Villas-Boas was ""suspended"" by Marseille on Tuesday after earlier offering to resign as coach at a press conference in which he revealed the Ligue 1 club signed midfielder Olivier Ntcham from Celtic against his wishes on transfer deadline day.","""This protective decision had become inevitable given the recent scheming and attitudes shown which have seriously damaged Olympique de Marseille as an institution,"" a club statement said. The suspension is a likely first step towards Marseille definitively parting company with the 43-year-old from Portugal, who became coach at the Velodrome in 2019. Yet Villas-Boas earlier said he wanted ""nothing from OM, no money. I just want to leave."" He said his decision came after Ntcham, a 24-year-old former France Under-21 international, joined on loan from Celtic until the end of the season just before the winter transfer window closed. Villas-Boas said he had not been in favour of the deal and knew nothing about it. ""The transfer window closed with the arrival of a new player on deadline day. It was not a decision that was taken by me. I had nothing to do with the decision,"" he said. ""I found out this morning when I woke up and looked at the press. I had specifically said no to that player and he was never on our list of targets. ""Because of that I have handed in my resignation to the board."" In their statement, Marseille described the coach's comments -- aimed at the club's Spanish sporting director Pablo Longoria -- as ""unacceptable"". Villas-Boas, the former Porto, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur manager, had already said last week that he expected to leave when his contract expires at the end of this season, with Marseille on a run of just one win in nine games in all competitions. Three straight league defeats have seen last season's Ligue 1 runners-up slip to ninth in the table before they face Lens on Wednesday. Their scheduled match at home to Rennes on Saturday was postponed after several hundred angry fans stormed the club's training ground, leading to 25 arrests. The supporters were demonstrating against the poor results but also against the running of the club by president Jacques-Henri Eyraud. The protesters were condemned as ""thugs"" by Marseille's owner, the American tycoon Frank McCourt, who likened the incidents to the deadly January 6 assault on the US Congress. stt-ama/fbr/smr/as/mw"

7,01/02/2021,14:47,"Messi fuels Barcelona revival, Marseille violence, Poch beaten: Talking points from around Europe","Lionel Messi kept up his improved form in La Liga as Barcelona won again amid more controversy about the Catalans' finances, while there was drama on and off the field in France and the Milan clubs continue to fight it out at the top of Serie A.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Barcelona have said they will take legal action against Spanish newspaper El Mundo after it published details at the weekend of Lionel Messi's current contract, which it says is worth up to 555 million euros ($674 million) over four years. El Mundo called it the ""colossal contract that ruins Barcelona"", just as the Catalans are wrestling with a dire financial situation, worsened by the pandemic, and with Messi's future currently up in the air. Yet the Argentine underlined his value to Barca by scoring a superb free-kick in their 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao. Barca are unbeaten in 10 n La Liga, winning eight, with Messi scoring eight times in that run. However, both Barcelona and Real Madrid are 10 points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, who beat Cadiz 4-2 and still boast a game in hand. Marseille's weekend game against Rennes in Ligue 1 was postponed after angry supporters attacked the club's training ground, while the players were there, in what was called ""a frenzy of unjustifiable violence"". Local police said 25 arrests were made and seven officers were injured after several hundred Ultras stormed La Commanderie in a protest against the club leadership and the team's poor recent run of results. Marseille's owner, the American tycoon Frank McCourt, called the protestors ""thugs"" and likened the incidents to last month's storming of the US Congress. The growing crisis comes with the former Champions League winners having slumped to ninth in Ligue 1 and after coach Andre Villas-Boas indicated he will leave at the end of the season. On the pitch in France, the title race is hotting up after reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain suffered their first defeat under new coach Mauricio Pochettino, conceding at the death to lose 3-2 at struggling Lorient despite Neymar scoring two penalties. It was a fifth defeat in Ligue 1 this season for PSG, who are third, three points behind leaders Lille. Lille beat Dijon 1-0, while Lyon are two points off top spot in second after scoring late to beat Bordeaux 2-1. It could even become a four-way fight. Monaco are six points off the lead after winning their last five games. Bayern Munich maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the German Bundesliga by beating Hoffenheim 4-1 as Robert Lewandowski scored his 24th goal of the league campaign. After a mini slump, the Bavarians have now four on the bounce and remain well clear of nearest rivals RB Leipzig. The result against Hoffenheim also allowed Hansi Flick's side to exact perfect revenge for their 4-1 defeat away to the same opponents in September, in what was their only loss in 46 matches in all competitions across a remarkable 2020. The only cloud on Bayern's weekend came as midfielder Corentin Tolisso was dropped and fined for getting a tattoo, therefore falling foul of Covid-19 quarantine regulations. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's spat with Romelu Lukaku dominated the headlines last midweek as Inter beat AC Milan in their Coppa Italia derby. On Saturday Ibrahimovic missed a penalty for the fourth time this season but Ante Rebic followed up to score and Franck Kessie later netted another spot-kick as Milan won 2-1 at Bologna. That result kept the Rossoneri two points clear of Inter at the top of Serie A, as Antonio Conte's side beat Benevento 4-0 with Lukaku scoring a brace at San Siro. The Belgian is on 14 league goals for the season and Inter remain best-placed to overhaul Milan, even if Roma, Juventus, Lazio and Napoli all also won at the weekend."
8,31/01/2021,17:29,Marseille's US owner links fan violence to Capitol riot,"Olympique Marseille's American owner Frank McCourt has strongly condemned ""thugs"" who attacked the club's training ground on Saturday, comparing the violent protest to the deadly January 6 assault on the US Congress.","""What happened some weeks ago in Washington DC and what happened yesterday (Saturday) in Marseille follow a comparable logic,"" McCourt wrote in a statement on the club's website on Sunday. ""A few sources feed an inferno of opinions, invectives, and threats that are amplified by social media creating the conditions that lead to violence and chaos,"" he stated. French prosecutors said 18 people remained in custody following the attack by several hundred disillusioned supporters that caused widespread damage. The hardcore Ultras, who were demonstrating against the club leadership and the team's poor recent run of results, assembled in front of Marseille's La Commanderie training ground on Saturday afternoon, throwing smoke bombs and firecrackers. ""A frenzy of unjustifiable violence put the lives of those present in danger,"" a club statement read. ""Theft was committed and vehicles damaged. Five trees were burnt down... several hundred thousand euros worth of damage was caused."" Former Marseille owner Bernard Tapie said he could understand the fans' anger, but condemned the violence. ""It makes me unhappy to see that. What they did was understandable, but it is totally unacceptable,"" Tapie told local newspaper La Provence. The 'Dodgers Nation' fansite of American baseball team the Los Angeles Dogers also mocked McCourt, the franchise's former owner. ""Three things in life are certain: death, taxes, and Frank McCourt being bad at everything he does,"" the lead article on the website said. Several European newspapers featured the scenes of chaos from the city on their front pages, with Germany's Bild and Italy's La Gazzetta dello Sport notably leading with the story. The Mediterranean city's public prosecutor Dominique Laurens said investigations were ""continuing throughout today (Sunday)"" into the violence which led to the postponement of the club's Saturday evening Ligue 1 fixture against Rennes at their Velodrome stadium. Police made 25 arrests on Saturday night. Seven police officers suffered minor injuries, and three police cars were badly damaged. McCourt said that Marseille fans ""love their club. ""It is therefore impossible for me to recognise the supporter status for these small groups of thugs."" He pledged that Marseille would ""work cooperatively with all authorities to ensure those found responsible for these horrendous acts of violence are held accountable to the full extent of the law"". Marseille president Jacques-Henri Eyraud told Canal Plus on Saturday night: ""We are all astonished: staff, coaching staff and players. We were not expecting a savage horde to turn up and destroy everything. ""I think we avoided an even worse situation. It could have been a tragedy. Everyone is shocked, players and staff. These are not real supporters, they are hooligans, delinquents, people who have no respect for anything."" Marseille have won just one of their last nine games in all competitions and languish in seventh place in Ligue 1, 14 points behind leaders Lyon, albeit with two games in hand.

""We are all astonished: staff, coaching staff and players. We were not expecting a savage horde to turn up and destroy everything,"" Marseille president Jacques-Henri Eyraud told Canal Plus. ""I think we avoided an even worse situation. It could have been a tragedy. Everyone is shocked, players and staff. These are not real supporters, they are hooligans, delinquents, people who have no respect for anything."" The French league reacted to the incidents by postponing Marseille's home game against Rennes, scheduled for Saturday evening, ""to a later date"", even though it was due to go ahead behind closed doors due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Marseille were second in Ligue 1 when last season ended early because of the pandemic. However, they have lost their last three league matches and have slid 14 points behind leaders Lyon, albeit with two games in hand. A 2-1 win for Lens at Montpellier on Saturday saw Marseille slip to seventh place. They have won just one of their last nine games in all competitions and are due to visit Lens in midweek before hosting fierce enemies Paris Saint-Germain next weekend. On Friday coach Andre Villas-Boas admitted he expected to leave at the end of the season. ""The place needs a clear-out... I'm responsible for the results and right now they're awful,"" the Portuguese former Porto, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur coach said. For several weeks supporters have organised protests before home matches, which are all being played behind closed doors. On Saturday an increased number of banners attacking club leadership, including Eyraud, were hung around the city on motorway bridges, roundabouts and even the Corniche overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. ""Follow AVB, get out of here"", ""Parisians, get out of here"", ""Give us back OM"", read some of them. Eyraud, who was born in Paris, was a frequent target after he angered fans during a conference on management when he talked about the ""danger"" of having too many Marseille residents or club supporters working at the club. ""JHE: No Marseille fans at OM? Get out of here"", said one banner unfurled above a motorway, and ""JHE, Marseille vomits you out"" said another at the Prado roundabout, a few metres from the Stade Velodrome. ol-stt-mdm/fbr/pb/bsp/as/dj"
10,29/01/2021,14:52,Villas-Boas to walk away from 'disastrous' Marseille,Andre Villas-Boas said Friday a poor second season at the helm of Marseille means he is likely to leave in June as a contract extension would only materialise with a dramatic turn of form.,"The former Spurs and Chelsea chief described Marseille's recent run as ""disastrous"" after being dumped out of the Champions League and dropping to sixth in Ligue 1. ""It looks like the end,"" the Portuguese said. ""I think it'll all be over in June."" ""I'm demanding nothing because looking at where we are it wouldn't be right. And I think everyone agrees with that,"" he explained with the club on a three-match losing streak in the league. After finishing second last season a contract extension had been mulled, but Villas-Boas poured cold water on the idea on Friday saying the club needed a clear out. ""I can't see an extension materialising, we're 13 points off the top. ""The place needs a clear out including myself, unless I get 10 straight wins maybe not. But I'm responsible for the results and right now they're awful.

11,24/01/2021,00:36,Villas-Boas optimistic Marseille will overcome troubles,Andre Villas-Boas said he was confident Marseille will emerge from their turbulent run after his team slid to a third successive Ligue 1 defeat following Saturday's 3-1 loss at Monaco.,"""There is no crisis. The mindset was good, the players were concentrated and focused. I think we'll come through this because the guys are giving everything,"" said Villas-Boas. Nemanja Radonjic skipped clear of the home defence to give Marseille the lead on 12 minutes at the Stade Louis II, but Monaco equalised early in the second half through Guillermo Maripan's header. Aurelien Tchouameni's first goal in the French top-flight put Monaco ahead before Stevan Jovetic's thumping free-kick in stoppage time sealed a fifth victory in six games for Niko Kovac's resurgent team. ""The goal at the start of the second half really hurt us,"" said Villas-Boas. ""We lost confidence. We conceded three goals from set-pieces even though we've been solid in that area. The first half was good, the second not very good."" Arkadiusz Milik made his Marseille debut off the bench after signing on an 18-month loan from Napoli, but the Polish striker was unable to arrest his new club's slump as they lost a third league game in a row for the first time since April 2015. They remain sixth and 13 points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain, while Monaco are closing in on the top three with just a point separating them and Lyon. While Villas-Boas refuses to give up the fight, a tough run of fixtures threatens to plunge Marseille into deeper trouble as a return to Europe fades from view. His side return home to face Rennes next weekend, with a second meeting against Lens in a fortnight preceding the visit of bitter rivals PSG to the Velodrome on February 7. Villas-Boas also confirmed midfielder Morgan Sanson was set to complete a move to Aston Villa after he was left out of the squad against Monaco. ""Sanson didn't have his head in the right place to play, seeing as the club has decided to let him leave,"" he explained. The 26-year-old is expected to join Villa for an initial fee of 15 million euros ($18.3 million). Earlier on Saturday, Nice won for just the second time in 11 outings as Youcef Atal's second-half goal was enough for a 1-0 victory at Lens."

Zinedine Zidane's side are playing catch up to Atletico Madrid, despite having played a game more, after draws against struggling Elche and Osasuna, two of the league's bottom three, in recent weeks. Alaves beat Madrid 2-1 in the capital in late November but have won just once in eight matches since, their slide into a relegation scrap costing coach Pablo Machin his job last week with former Spain international Abelardo Fernandez returning to take charge. AC Milan v Atalanta, Saturday 1700 GMT Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasted little time shaking off any rust accrued while sidelined by a muscle injury as he scored twice against Cagliari on Monday, in his first Serie A start in two months. The 39-year-old Swede has scored 12 goals in just seven starts this season, second only to Cristiano Ronaldo in the league, and Milan this week strengthened their attack with the signing of ex-Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic on a free transfer. ""Zlatan and I have a lot of experience. In football, it's important to instill fear in your opponents, to fight and to protect your team,"" said Mandzukic, who could make his debut against an Atalanta side that arrives in Milan unbeaten in nine league outings. Monaco v Marseille, Saturday 2000 GMT Marseille are reeling after two straight defeats followed a draw at lowly Dijon, a run that has shattered any fanciful Ligue 1 title dreams and cast considerable doubt over the future of coach Andre Villas-Boas. ""I am at the service of the board. I am not here to cause problems. If they decide that I am not up to it in terms of results, then it will be the time to leave. If a change is needed, I am at their service,"" Villas-Boas said following Wednesday's 1-0 home loss to Lens. Club president Jacques-Henri Eyraud blasted the players as ""not fit to wear the shirt"" in the wake of last weekend's defeat by bottom side Nimes. A trip to Niko Kovac's in-form Monaco could spell further trouble at the Velodrome. Schalke v Bayern Munich, Sunday 1430 GMT With their 30-match winless run finally over, Schalke will want no reminding of what happened when they met Bayern Munich on the opening day of the season -- a crushing 8-0 defeat setting the tone for a disastrous first half of the campaign. In 19-year-old US forward Matthew Hoppe, Schalke have found a ray of hope in their fight against relegation, but the Royal Blues are eight points from potential safety at the halfway stage. Bayern have clawed out tough wins over Freiburg and Augsburg in their two previous games to regain control atop the Bundesliga, sending a ""signal to the rest of the chasing pack"" their hunger remains strong despite a recent dip, says Manuel Neuer. Sporting v Braga, Saturday 1945 GMT Having sparred with their rivals off the pitch over the handling of Covid-19 cases, Sporting Lisbon got the better of Porto in Tuesday's semi-final thanks to two late goals from Cape Verde-born Jovane Cabral. A day later, Braga overcame their ""outrage"" at Benfica's efforts to seek a postponement of their tie, booking a place in the final in Leiria with a 2-1 victory over an opposing side hit by a raft of coronavirus infections. Sporting and Braga have combined to win each of the past three editions of the Portuguese League Cup, the former lifting the trophy in 2018 and 2019 before Braga defeated Porto in last year's final under current Sporting boss Ruben Amorim."
13,22/01/2021,03:10,Villas-Boas navigates storm in Marseille as title chances fade,Marseille are never far away from a crisis and the southern French giants are in trouble again after a run of defeats which have led to coach Andre Villas-Boas admitting to some uncertainty about his future.,"Former Chelsea boss Villas-Boas had to be persuaded to stay at Marseille for this season despite leading the 1993 Champions League winners to second place in Ligue 1 in the last, curtailed campaign. He clearly sensed that repeating that performance would be a very difficult, if not impossible, task and Marseille were dreadful in the Champions League group phase, losing five of their six games. However, all was going well in Ligue 1 as OM won six games in a row to sit right in contention in mid-December. Since then, though, they have won just once in seven, and suffered home defeats to struggling Nimes and Lens in the last week. That has left Marseille sixth, 10 points off leaders Paris Saint-Germain, albeit with a game in hand. After losing 2-1 to Nimes, club president Jacques-Henri Eyraud fumed at his players, telling them they were ""not fit to wear the shirt"". ""I am at the service of the board. I am not here to be an obstacle,"" Villas-Boas said after Wednesday's 1-0 loss to Lens, a game played out to a backdrop of banners in the empty stands at the Velodrome with messages such as ""you are disgusting"" and ""you are an embarrassment to us"". Villas-Boas did, though, make it clear he was not about to give up the fight ahead of a huge match at fourth-placed Monaco on Saturday. ""We will be playing all our direct rivals in our upcoming matches. We missed a chance to close in on the sides above us but I hope to turn things around. I don't think this is dead yet."" Brest midfielder Lasne, 32, is not one of the more remarkable players in France. However, he has become an integral part of the Brittany side since Ibrahima Diallo was sold to Southampton for a reported 15 million euros ($18.2m) in October. Meanwhile, off the pitch Lasne has written a book to be released on February 1 and called MurMures (the second capital 'M' is deliberate and the title translates as 'Murmurs'). The book -- conveniently published by the publishing house founded by his father -- is not about football but a series of stories related to Lasne's experience during France's first coronavirus lockdown in early 2020 -- the title of the book perhaps also makes reference to being walled in as a ""mur"" in French is a wall. He told AFP he was inspired to write by a trip to the supermarket just before the lockdown. ""There was a sort of anxious atmosphere. You could tell something was up,"" he said. ""When I got home I wrote some stuff down about. My wife read it and encouraged me to do some writing every day."" 7 - The number of points collected, out of a possible nine, by Paris Saint-Germain in three Ligue 1 games under Mauricio Pochettino. The Argentine missed his team's 1-0 win in Angers last weekend after testing positive for Covid-19. Forced into self-isolation in his Paris hotel room, it is unclear if Pochettino will be back for Friday's game against Montpellier. 7 - Rennes are unbeaten in seven games, the longest streak in the division. They can move to within three points of second-placed Lille with a win when the sides meet on Sunday. 17 - Lyon go into Sunday's Rhone-Alpes derby against Saint-Etienne having lost just once in their last 17 games, although that loss came last weekend against Metz. In contrast, Claude Puel's struggling Saint-Etienne have managed just one win in their last 17 matches."
14,21/01/2021,23:22,Milik joins Marseille on loan from Napoli,"Marseille have signed Poland striker Arkadiusz Milik on an 18-month loan from Napoli with an option to buy, the Ligue 1 club announced on Thursday.","The 26-year-old Milik has not played for Napoli this season and joins a Marseille side who have slipped off the title pace in France in recent weeks. ""I am happy and proud to announce that I am officially a player of Olympique de Marseille, one of the most prestigious clubs in Europe,"" he said on Twitter. ""I'm ready for this new adventure. Allez OM."" Media reports in France suggested Marseille could opt to make the deal permanent for eight million euros ($9.7 million), with four million euros in possible bonuses. Milik, who joined Napoli from Ajax in 2016, scored 48 goals in all competitions for the Serie A side. A three-match winless run has left goal-shy Marseille sixth in Ligue 1, 10 points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain and second-placed Lille. Coach Andre Villas-Boas has come under increasing pressure and said he would leave the club if asked to by the club board following Wednesday's 1-0 home loss to Lens. The Portuguese will be hoping that Milik can help his team rediscover their best form, with Florian Thauvin, who has been heavily linked with a move away from the Stade Velodrome, their top-scorer in the league this season with only six goals."
15,21/01/2021,00:14,Villas-Boas under pressure after latest Marseille defeat,"Andre Villas-Boas said on Wednesday he would leave his role as Marseille coach if asked to by club bosses, after seeing his side lose 1-0 at home to Lens in Ligue 1.","The hosts, who followed a goalless draw with Dijon by losing to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions Trophy and then to Nimes, came unstuck again as Simon Banza netted a second-half winner for the visitors at the Stade Velodrome. OM remain sixth in the Ligue 1 table, albeit with a game in hand, 10 points behind leaders PSG and second-placed Lille. They have only won one of their last eight matches in all competitions. ""My place is at the disposal of the management,"" said former Chelsea and Tottenham manager Villas-Boas. ""I am not here to be an obstacle."" A drab match saw few chances, with the majority of the best opportunities falling to seventh-placed Lens, who moved within a point of their beaten opponents. Banza met Massadio Haidara's cross to score his third league goal of the season from close range in the 59th minute. The closest Marseille came was a late free-kick from Dimitri Payet which flew narrowly over the crossbar. ""We have to do better, find a way not to concede from a cross,"" added Villas-Boas, whose side visit Monaco on Saturday. ""I have to believe in myself and in my players to change this run of form. Monaco is coming up, I am focused on that, to find the team, the solutions."" The game against Lens was one of two that Marseille had in hand over their rivals. They remain eight points behind Lyon, who occupy the third and final Champions League spot."
16,16/01/2021,20:42,Stuttering Marseille slump to shock home defeat,Florian Thauvin missed a penalty as Marseille's hopes of staying in the Ligue 1 title race were dealt another blow in a shock 2-1 home defeat by struggling Nimes on Saturday.,"France World Cup winner Thauvin sent a woeful spot-kick wide in the first half and Swedish winger Niclas Eliasson then converted twice from close range after the break to give the away side an unassailable lead behind closed doors at the Velodrome. Argentine forward Dario Benedetto pulled one back late on for Andre Villas-Boas's side but this result left them with just one win in six Ligue 1 games. Beaten narrowly by Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions Trophy in midweek, Marseille are sixth in the league, now eight points behind leaders Lyon, albeit still with a game in hand. ""We risk losing touch with the teams at the top, who are more consistent than us,"" said Villas-Boas. ""We were very bad and we paid an expensive price for it. We can't go from playing well against Paris to a miserable match like today."" Nimes move off the foot of the table after their first win in nine, but they remain in the bottom three. Lyon are at home to Metz on Sunday, but Paris Saint-Germain -- a point off the top in second -- can move provisionally top by winning at Angers later on Saturday. PSG are without their new coach Mauricio Pochettino, who is isolating after it was revealed on Friday that he had tested positive for coronavirus. Meanwhile relegation-threatened Lorient's home game against fellow strugglers Dijon has been postponed after a Covid-19 outbreak in the Brittany side."
17,13/01/2021,23:08,Returning Neymar helps PSG to Champions Trophy triumph over Marseille,Neymar scored on his return to action for Paris Saint-Germain as they beat arch rivals Marseille 2-1 to win this season's Champions Trophy.,"The Brazilian rolled home an 85th minute penalty to put PSG two goals ahead following Mauro Icardi's first-half opener to give new coach Mauricio Pochettino the first trophy of his reign in the French capital, and managerial career. The Champions Trophy is the French equivalent of a Super Cup, usually contested at the start of the season by the league champions and French Cup winners. With PSG winning both last season, Marseille had been selected as their opponents as the Ligue 1 runners-up. This season's edition was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Hopes were high for a feisty tussle in Lens after Marseille's league win at PSG in September ended with five red cards and Neymar accusing Marseille centre back Alvaro Gonzalez of racism in the aftermath. However it was a largely tame encounter in northern France, with the most noteworthy incident being substitute Neymar's goalscoring return after a month away. The 28-year-old hadn't featured for the French champions since being stretchered off with an ankle injury during a 1-0 defeat to current league leaders Lyon on December 13. Icardi thought he had given PSG the lead with a 22nd minute tap-in, only to have the goal ruled out for offside after Kylian Mbappe strayed past Marseille's back line to collect Leandro Paredes' defence-splitting pass. Seven minutes later it was Mbappe's turn to have a goal chalked off when he started his run too early to connect with a long pass from his captain Marquinhos. Icardi finally put dominant PSG ahead six minutes before the break with a goal typical of his poacher's style, first meeting Angel Di Maria's raking long ball with a close-range header that Steven Mandanda pushed onto the post. The Argentine was quickest to follow up as the ball dribbled back out from the goal, and he tapped in his second goal is as many games since returning from injury. He almost doubled his side's lead in first half stoppage time when he hit a left-footed strike back off the crossbar. Neymar returned to action in the 65th minute and was immediately targeted by Gonzalez, the Argentine fouling the superstar attacker several times in what looked like a continuation of the pair's spat. However it was Neymar who had the last laugh when he stepped up to score the decisive second goal for PSG from the penalty spot after Icardi was brought down by Marseille's substitute keeper Yohann Pele. Dimitri Payet pulled one back for Marseille with a minute remaining but it was too little too late for Andre Villas-Boas' side."
18,12/01/2021,17:54,Neymar set to return for PSG in 'special game' for Pochettino,Neymar is in line to return for Paris Saint-Germain after four weeks on the sidelines in Wednesday's Champions Trophy game against bitter rivals Marseille.,"""Neymar is available and will be in the squad. We will decide tomorrow (Wednesday) if he plays or starts on the bench,"" PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino said at a virtual press conference ahead of the game. The world's most expensive player has not played since being stretchered off with an ankle injury at the end of PSG's Ligue 1 defeat to Lyon on December 13, missing his side's last five matches as a result. Neymar was one of three PSG players sent off in an ugly ending to PSG's most recent meeting with Marseille, who finished with nine men. The Brazilian later accused Marseille defender Alvaro Gonzalez of racism, although in the end no action was taken due to a lack of evidence. Wednesday's game is just PSG's third since former Tottenham Hotspur coach Pochettino was appointed as the successor to the sacked Thomas Tuchel, and offers the chance for him to win his first piece of silverware with the Qatar-owned club. The Champions Trophy is the French equivalent of a Super Cup, usually contested at the start of the season by the league champions and French Cup winners. With PSG winning both last season, Marseille have been selected as their opponents as the Ligue 1 runners-up. Played overseas in the last 10 years, including most recently in China, this season's edition was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic and is taking place in less exotic conditions behind closed doors in Lens in northern France. Nevertheless Pochettino, who played for PSG, called it a ""special match, but winning the game almost matters more than winning a trophy at the end of it"". His first game at the helm ended in a 1-1 draw with Saint-Etienne last week, before he oversaw a first win as PSG beat Brest 3-0 on Saturday to leave them a point behind Ligue 1 leaders Lyon at the campaign's halfway stage. While Neymar returns, young full-back Colin Dagba on Tuesday became the latest Paris player to test positive for Covid-19 and has joined team-mates Rafinha and Thilo Kehrer in having to isolate. Marseille, coached by Andre Villas-Boas, beat PSG 1-0 in that last, fiery meeting in the league in September, their first win over their greatest rivals in nine years. ""Andre and I both coached Tottenham. I have great affection for him and we get on well with each other,"" Pochettino said of his opposite number."

Coach Andre Villas-Boas said Lirola had been on sporting director Pablo Longoria's radar since the summer. ""Pol was already on our list in August. He's a player who Pablo appreciates. It wasn't difficult to do, he was interested himself too,"" Villas-Boas said during a press conference. Lirola, 23, has started just four games for the Tuscan club this term after joining from Sassuolo in September. He will compete with Japan's Hiroki Sakai for a starting berth in Villas-Boas' side, who are sixth in Ligue 1. On Wednesday they head to Lens to face Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions Trophy, the French equivalent of a Super Cup that in normal times is the curtain-raiser to the season."

But, he said, the financial pressures of the coronavirus pandemic could offer ""an opportunity to change the face of football"" Marseille's 1-0 victory over PSG in Ligue 1 in September was marred by five red cards, Angel Di Maria spitting at Marseille centre back Alvaro and Neymar accusing the same opponent of racism. The Champions Trophy usually pits the Ligue 1 champions against the French cup winners, but since PSG finished top of the league when the season was halted and won the cup, they face the league runners up Marseille in Lens on Wednesday. The Marseille coach said the encounters between the clubs, dubbed ""Clasicos"" in France, were ""always hot"". ""Fans demand we play these matches with aggression and authority. The match at the Parc des Princes was out of control at the end, but that was more because of provocation from the other side than from us"", he told a press conference. ""So we will go with humility, but also aggression and intensity."" Marseille have not won a trophy since 2012 but Villas-Boas said that was to do with Qatari financial backing for their rival. ""OM have won no titles since PSG changed the face of French football. It's not OM's fault, it's the reality of the most unbalanced championship in the world,"" he said. ""The norm is that PSG win all the national competitions. So we don't have this pressure to win."" ""When an opportunity comes up, you have to do the best you can."" A meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday between club presidents and the French players union, on wage cuts in the face of Covid-19. Villas-Boas said football had a chance to adjust its priorities. ""Clubs have lost their heads, all we've done is bullshit with transfers at 300 million euros. It could be good that the pandemic is pushing everyone to question themselves and that everyone calms down,"" he said. ""There are debts everywhere, losses of 300, 400, 500 million. Even at Real (Madrid) and Barca. We have to stop."" ""Of course, it's going to affect the employees of the game, that is to say us.

Defender Presnel Kimpembe, who suffered a thigh injury in the goalless draw at Lille a week later, was pictured returning to training for the capital city club on Monday. However the pair are still doubts for the Champions Trophy match against Marseille, who finished second to PSG in Ligue 1 last season, in Lens on Wednesday. New coach Mauricio Pochettino said after Saturday's 3-0 win over mid-table outfit Brest that he did not know whether he would be able pick Neymar midweek.

""We are interested but there haven't been any advanced talks with the club or the player. It's not as advanced as that, it's not for the coming days.

Marseille stay fourth in the table, four points behind leaders Lille. The hosts' coach Andre Villas-Boas made two changes from the midweek defeat at Rennes as Nagatomo, Japan's second-most capped player, and Alvaro Gonzalez came into the starting lineup. The visitors' boss David Guion changed formation from Wednesday's victory over Nantes picking a five-man midfield as Mathieu Cafaro, who scored the winner, came in on the right. Nagatomo, making just his fourth start of the season, made the error for the opener after 21 minutes. Arber Zeneli played a low cross into the box and Nagatomo deflected the ball into his own net. The former Inter Milan left-back's performance then took a further turn for the worse with a yellow card five minutes later for a challenge on French attacker Cafaro. Thauvin brought the sides level just before the interval when the French striker prodded home Dario Benedetto's wayward header. Japan right-back Hiroki Sakai and France playmaker Dimitri Payet attempted to claim late winners but the outfit from the Champagne region held on for a point. Earlier, Opa Nguette and Farid Boulaya scored in Metz's 2-0 win over Lens to send their side up to eighth. Later, Lyon can go top with a win over 11th-placed Nice."

On Thursday, the newspaper published an article headlined: ""When Villas-Boas insults and threatens one of our journalists."" On Friday, the former Tottenham, Chelsea and Zenit St Petersburg coach offered an apology at his press conference. ""I had a reaction that I regret,"" said Villas-Boas. ""The substance of my thought has not changed, but I understand that the way I expressed it provoked your criticism, which is fair. Freedom of expression is one of the most precious human rights. ""I don't have a problem with the press or with criticism, but I had a bad experience with two articles that, for me, attacked my dignity and integrity as a professional and as a person. ""I had a reaction that a person cannot have, I regret it and I am ready to apologise to the journalist."" Marseille struggled again in the Champions League this season and the journalist had written that this continued a career pattern for Villas Boas and that his results in the competition were ""not brilliant"". That had drawn complaints from the Portuguese coach at earlier press conferences, on one occasion lamenting that the writer was not in the room. On Wednesday morning, La Provence published another article on the subject. That evening, Villas-Boas approached the journalist after his brief press conference. ""Thank you. Keep it up, I'll get you,"" he reportedly said after striking the journalist on the shoulder. ""If I'm lucky enough to get you... keep on like this, that's fine."" The dispute continued in the stadium car park. According to another witness, Villas-Boas approached the journalist and ""insulted him in Portuguese"".

With coach Andre Villas-Boas absent, suspended after receiving a red card on the bench in the game against Nimes last Friday, Marseille pounced on two early turnovers by Monaco. After Monaco gave the ball away on the edge of their box in the fifth minute, Dario Benedetto burst down the left edge of the penalty area and chipped the ball to the far post where Florian Thauvin headed in. Eight minutes later, after Marseille won the ball back in the Monaco half, Thauvin returned the favour. He swung in a left-foot cross from the right which Argentine Benedetto, running in unmarked, volleyed home. As Monaco pressed in the second half, Thauvin dropped into his own penalty and conceded a 78th minute penalty with a dangerous high challenge on Wissam Ben Yedder. Ben Yedder sent Steve Mandanda the wrong way from the spot kick, but the Marseille goalkeeper dealt serenely with Monaco's desperate attempts in the closing minutes. Marseille leapfrogged Lille and Lyon to move into second, one-point behind Paris Saint-Germain. On Sunday, PSG entertain Lyon after Lille host Bordeaux, but Marseille will end the weekend with two games in hand on all three."
27,08/12/2020,17:57,Aguero could return for Man City's Marseille clash,Sergio Aguero could be fit enough to feature on the bench for Manchester City in their last Champions League group game against Marseille on Wednesday.,"Aguero, City's record goalscorer, has played just four times this term after knee surgery in the close season. The 32-year-old striker has missed the last three matches after suffering discomfort in his knee, with a hamstring injury adding a further complication to his troubled return. Aguero's last appearance came as a substitute in the Champions League win at Olympiakos on November 25. ""We are going to decide tomorrow. Maybe he is on the bench,"" Guardiola told reporters on Tuesday. ""Tomorrow we are going to do a training session and see how his reaction is in his body, not just his knee. ""The important thing is the last two, three, four days he was part of the group in the training and his reaction and the niggles he had in the recent past were disappeared."" Aguero's availability means the Argentine might be involved in Saturday's crucial derby against Manchester United as City look to get back in the title race. ""He's working incredibly hard to come back and this is the most important thing,"" Guardiola said. ""So, of course he needs a little bit more time for the injury and for his physicality, but we are patient so we would love to have him fit and ready."" City are already through to the Champions League last 16 as Group C winners, but Guardiola suggested he would not make a host of changes from the Premier League win against Fulham last weekend. ""We're going to play the game to win the game and I don't rotate the team. I try to put all the players in the best condition for any game and decide the best team for this specific game,"" Guardiola said. He said he did not have ""one team for one competition and one for another one"". City have become regulars in the knockout stages of the Champions League, but they are yet to win the competition. They have just one semi-final appearance in 2016, while has Guardiola, a two-time winner as Barcelona manager, has overseen three consecutive quarter-final defeats, including last season's shock loss to Lyon. Despite those flops, Marseille boss Andre Villas-Boas believes City are good enough to win the Champions League. ""The expectations have been very high for City but there will be nobody with more willingness to win it than Pep at this moment,"" Villas-Boas said. ""In the Champions League I'm no expert. Pep is the expert, he's won it twice as a manager. ""City have been waiting so long, and the quality they have is second to none, the options they have."""
28,25/11/2020,23:16,Marseille slump to record 13th straight Champions League defeat,"Marseille broke an unwanted record for the most consecutive Champions League defeats on Wednesday, going down 2-0 at home to Porto to make it an unlucky 13 straight losses in the competition.","The French club, who won the inaugural edition of the Champions League in 1993, have now passed the previous record of 12 defeats in a row set by Belgian side Anderlecht between 2003 and 2005. The Nigerian Zaidu Sanusi gave Porto the lead six minutes before half-time in a match played behind closed doors at the Velodrome. Porto then had on-loan Liverpool midfielder Marko Grujic sent off midway through the second half but they went 2-0 up soon after. Marseille defender Leonardo Balerdi gave away a penalty and was sent off for a second yellow card. Sergio Oliveira converted the spot-kick and the Portuguese club are close to joining Manchester City in qualifying from Group C with two games remaining. In contrast, Andre Villas-Boas's pointless side are eliminated from the competition after four defeats out of four this season, but could still catch Olympiakos to take third place and salvage a place in the Europa League knockout rounds. They host the Greek side next week before finishing their campaign away to City. Marseille's current run started when they lost their last three matches in the 2011/12 competition, although they did make it to the quarter-finals in that campaign. Then they lost all six group games in the 2013/14 season before returning to Europe's elite club competition this season after a seven-year absence."

Marseille climbed to within three points of Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain, with all the top outfits on nine games ahead of PSG's clash with third-placed Rennes on Saturday. PSG lead Ligue 1 with 21 points, Lille have 19 and Rennes and Marseille both have 18. The acrobatic 72nd minute shot from the edge of the area from midfielder Sanson was set up by Dimitri Payet, who had come on as a substitute with 20 minutes remaining at a cold, windy and empty Stade de la Meinau. Payet replaced former Newcastle player and France international Florian Thauvin, who was playing his 200th game for Marseille. After a miserable first half without a single shot on target from either side Strasbourg defender Anthony Caci hit the crossbar with a deflected shot just ahead of the hour. The visitors also appealed for a penalty when the ball appeared to hit Stefan Mitrovic's hand but the referee waved play on. Strasbourg coach Thierry Laurey is currently sidelined with Covid-19 and his side are second bottom on six points from 10 games."

Moussa Marega gave Porto an early lead behind closed doors at the Estadio do Dragao before Dimitri Payet blazed a penalty over for Marseille. He was made to pay as Sergio Oliveira scored from the spot to make it 2-0 for Porto before the half-hour mark and the Colombian Luis Diaz sealed the win for the home side with a fabulous third in the second half. Marseille, who are coached by the former Porto boss Andre Villas-Boas, are still without a point after three games in Group C, having also lost away to Olympiakos (1-0) and at home to Manchester City (3-0). They lost their last three matches in the 2011/12 competition, although they did make it to the quarter-finals in that campaign. Then they lost all six group games in the 2013/14 season before returning to Europe's elite club competition this season after a seven-year absence."
31,27/10/2020,23:04,Masterly De Bruyne inspires City past tame Marseille,Manchester City made it two wins from two in their latest bid for Champions League glory as Kevin De Bruyne starred in a straightforward 3-0 win at Marseille on Tuesday.,"The English side, who have never reached the semi-finals under Pep Guardiola, sit top of the early Group C table after their opening victory at Porto last week. With De Bruyne running the show in midfield on his first start since returning from injury, City cruised past a largely ineffective Marseille. Andre-Villas Boas's men, playing in their first Champions League campaign since 2013, are rooted to the foot of the group after back-to-back defeats. Porto sit second behind City after a 2-0 win over Olympiakos in Group C's other match on Tuesday. City, who have only won two of their opening five Premier League games this season, started with Ferran Torres up front in the absence of injured duo Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus. The visitors dominated the early stages without creating many clear-cut chances, but were handed the opening goal in the 18th minute. Marseille midfielder Valentin Rongier's dreadful pass put De Bruyne in the clear, and the Belgian squared for Torres to slot in his third City goal since signing from Valencia. City appeared likely to win without any help from their opponents, but Marseille defender Leonardo Balerdi contrived to lose the ball inside his own area and was fortunate to see Oleksandr Zinchenko's effort clip the base of the post. The home side were much improved after the interval, though, and City goalkeeper Ederson was lucky to fumble a long-range strike from Florian Thauvin onto his post and behind. But any hopes of a push for a late OM equaliser were put to bed 14 minutes from time. Phil Foden stood a high ball up to the back post which Raheem Sterling nodded down for Ilkay Gundogan to score. It was not long before De Bruyne collected his second assist of the game, as his low pass was tapped home by Sterling."
32,26/10/2020,02:25,Villas-Boas aiming high with Marseille in French love affair,"Andre Villas-Boas loves Marseille and the French giants' supporters love him for ending their seven-year absence from the Champions League, in which they host Pep Guardiola's Manchester City this week.","There was a once a time, a decade ago now, when ""AVB"" and Pep were the two most coveted coaches in Europe, both winning European trophies in the same 2010/11 season in charge of Porto and Barcelona respectively. The young Villas-Boas shared some of the same reference points as Guardiola. Both crossed paths with Jose Mourinho in the early years of his career and Bobby Robson was a mentor to both, giving a young Villas-Boas work in the scouting department at Porto and then making Pep a central part of his team at Barcelona. ""AVB"" was just 33 in 2011 when, as Guardiola led Barcelona to the Champions League, he won four trophies with Porto including the Europa League. His career did not quite scale the expected heights after that. He left for Chelsea but did not last the season, and by the time the London club beat Guardiola's Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals en route to winning the trophy, Roberto di Matteo was in charge. Their paths did not cross then, but they will now, with Villas-Boas hoping to outfox Guardiola and damage City's European prospects. Marseille are up against it after losing 1-0 to Olympiakos last week, while City beat Porto. But the OM coach is unlikely to have changed the optimistic outlook with which he came into the campaign. ""We can compete in this group. We can't be too down after being in Pot Four when the draw was made,"" Villas-Boas told AFP last week. ""I like to aim high. We dreamt of being in this competition, so now we are targeting the last 16."" For Marseille being in the Champions League is a huge deal. France's best-supported club remains the only Ligue 1 team ever to have won the competition, in 1993. Although they reached the Europa League final in 2018, OM had been absent from the Champions League for seven years before Villas-Boas led them back there thanks to a second-place finish in the last, curtailed Ligue 1 campaign. Appointed in 2019 to return to coaching in Europe, three years after leaving Zenit Saint-Petersburg for China, ""AVB"" quickly won over the club's fans and they were horrified when he nearly walked away in the close season. Unhappy at seeing sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta depart, Villas-Boas threatened to go too before being persuaded to stay for the final year of his contract. Now he could be prepared to extend that deal. ""In February we can talk. The January transfer window will have closed and we will more or less be able to see where we stand,"" he told AFP. ""The most important thing is that I am very happy here. I am emotionally attached to this club, to its history, the players who have played here, its impact in Europe. It's magnificent."" Villas-Boas has restored pride to Marseille, and with players like Dimitri Payet and Florian Thauvin, there is hope they can enjoy more success this season. Marseille have already beaten PSG for the first time in nine years. It will nevertheless not be the same against City without the presence of 60,000 fans at the Velodrome, one of Europe's most spine-tingling atmospheres. Instead the health crisis means the stadium will be empty on Tuesday. ""The biggest disappointment for us is to return to this competition and find ourselves -- with OM's European history, two Champions League finals, three finals in the UEFA Cup or Europa League -- playing without our fans, when the fervour of the supporters is sort of the thing that defines OM,"" Villas-Boas said. ""We were not able to celebrate qualifying because of the times we are in, and now we can't experience it with our supporters. That is tough."""
33,23/10/2020,03:50,French clubs seek solace amid poor Champions League form and Mediapro dispute,"Just two months after Paris Saint-Germain's run to the final of the Champions League in Lisbon, and Lyon's appearance in the semi-finals, a miserable midweek for Ligue 1 clubs in Europe's elite competition offered no relief at a time when French football is in crisis off the field.","PSG lost 2-1 at home to Manchester United after Marcus Rashford popped up with a late winner for the visitors, and Marseille conceded even later to lose 1-0 at Olympiakos. It was left to Rennes to salvage some pride, but a 1-1 draw with Russian novices Krasnodar still leaves them up against it. On the pitch, Ligue 1 remains the poor relation among Europe's ""Big Five"" leagues, and the outlook is not being helped by the economic crisis and a worrying dispute with the game's chief domestic TV rights holder. Chinese-owned Spanish firm Mediapro did not meet a scheduled 172 million-euro ($203m) payment due this month and is now trying to renegotiate the record deal it agreed for four seasons starting this year, citing the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Mediapro won the rights after agreeing to pay over 800 million euros per season, out of a total deal worth a record 1.15 billion euros annually. Clubs now face an uncertain future, just as they are being starved of gate revenue due to restrictions on gatherings as a result of the pandemic. The French league (LFP) has taken out a loan of 112 million euros to tide over clubs in the short term, but it is unclear what happens next with Mediapro CEO Jaume Roures saying the company intends to honour the full term of their deal while also indicating the next scheduled payment may not be forthcoming either. ""If there were no TV rights it would be catastrophic for everyone,"" admitted Montpellier president Laurent Nicollin. Meanwhile, interested observers elsewhere believe French clubs will have no choice but to renegotiate the deal. ""There was no pandemic when Mediapro offered the money they did. Nobody knew there was going to be a pandemic and that all the bars would close, that the season would start later than planned,"" LaLiga president Javier Tebas told AFP. ""The conditions were no longer the same so this is all normal. We have also negotiated with many operators."" The France superstar endured a difficult night in PSG's loss to Manchester United and has now gone six games without scoring in the Champions League. It is a worrying run for a player who had previously been so prolific both with his current club and Monaco, and it is notable that Rashford has now scored as many Champions League goals in Paris since the start of 2018/19 as Mbappe. Perhaps he was tired after starting twice and playing another 45 minutes as a substitute for France during the recent international break, and it will be interesting to see if PSG coach Thomas Tuchel starts him on Saturday against Dijon or gives him a rest ahead of the Champions League trip to Istanbul Basaksehir. 1 - France's three representatives collected a solitary point between them in the Champions League in midweek. 24 - PSG have scored 24 goals without reply in their six previous home meetings with Dijon in league and cup. They notably won 8-0 in January 2018. 6 - Lille went top of Ligue 1 last weekend for the first time in six years. They have their best record seven games into a season since 1952."
34,04/10/2020,23:51,"Marseille and Lyon's struggles continue in draw, Rennes stay top",Marseille and Lyon continued their shaky starts to the season on Sunday with a 1-1 draw that leaves both sides languishing in mid-table in Ligue 1.,"Marseille are 10th on nine points following the draw at the Groupama stadium while Rudi Garcia's Lyon, who reached the semi-finals of last season's Champions League, are two points and four places back. Andre Villas-Boas' Marseille have not won in the four matches since they beat Paris Saint-Germain last month while Lyon's winless run already stretches to five matches in the six-game-old season. The hosts have drawn four of those matches and struggled to break down Marseille even though the away side played most of the match with 10 men following Dmitri Payet's 19th-minute red card for a high challenge on Leo Dubois. Marseille had taken the lead thanks to talisman Payet's smart finish just three minutes before he was sent off, but Houssem Aouar levelled from the penalty spot just before the half hour mark and that's how the scores remained. Aouar, who was set to be leaving in the summer transfer window which closes on Monday, thought he had also scored the winner with 14 minutes remaining only to see his goal ruled out for what looked like a soft foul on Marseille keeper Steve Mandanda. ""In the circumstances it's a good point which gives us some confidence,"" said Villas Boas. ""I'm happy because the players gave everything, we rediscovered the spirit that we has last season."" Earlier Rennes clung on to top spot in Ligue 1 after scrabbling to a 2-2 home with Reims which allowed Lille to move level on points with the leaders with a 3-0 win at Strasbourg. Rennes were leading at the break and were set to go back clear in first place but Boulaye Dia barged through the home defence before slotting home the goal that would give Reims a point in the 66th minute. Lille meanwhile stormed to victory in Alsace thanks to goals from Zeki Celik, Renato Sanches and Burak Yilmaz which maintained their unbeaten start to the season. Both sides are on 14 points, one ahead of newly-promoted Lens, who drop down to third but are on a storming run after beating 10-time league champions Saint-Etienne 2-0 on Saturday. Champions PSG meanwhile are lurking ominously a further point back in fourth after destroying Angers 6-1 on Friday night."

The Brazil attacker claimed the Spanish centre-back had called him a ""monkey"". ""The disciplinary commission states that it does not have sufficient proof to allow it to establish the substance of the facts concerning discriminatory language,"" the LFP said. Marseille's victory at Parc des Princes on September 13 was marred by an injury-time scuffle which saw five players red-carded. Neymar was sent off for slapping Gonzalez on the back of the head and was given a two-match ban for the incident. Last week, PSG's Angel Di Maria received a four-match ban for spitting during the fixture."

PSG have stood by the world's most expensive player, saying the club ""strongly supports"" him, but Neymar conceded he would accept his punishment which is expected to be revealed by the French league's disciplinary commission on Wednesday. ""Yesterday I revolted. I was punished with red because I wanted to hit someone who offended me,"" Neymar said in a lengthy Instagram post Monday. ""I thought I could not leave without doing something because I realised that those in charge would not do anything, did not notice or ignored the fact."" Neymar was dismissed for slapping Gonzalez on the back of the head, with team-mates Layvin Kurzawa and Leandro Paredes also sent off, as well as Marseille's Dario Benedetto and Jordan Amavi. ""In our sport, aggressions, insults, swearing are part of the game, of the dispute. You can't be affectionate. I understand this guy partly, all is part of the game, but racism and intolerance are unacceptable,"" Neymar continued. ""Should I have ignored it? I don't know yet... Today, with a cool head, I say yes, but in due course, my companions and I asked the referees for help and we were ignored. ""I accept my punishment because I should have followed the path of clean football. I hope, on the other hand, that the offender will also be punished. ""Racism exists. It exists, but we have to stop it. No more. Enough!"" ""The guy was a fool. I also acted like a fool for letting me get involved in that,"" he added. PSG have lost their opening two games of the season for the first time since 1984/85, and face another spell without Neymar whose first two seasons in France were marred by injuries. They host Metz on Metz on Wednesday in what was originally scheduled to be their Ligue 1 season opener. Meanwhile, Marseille issued a statement of their own defending Gonzalez. He denied racism and accused Neymar of being a bad loser. ""Alvaro Gonzalez is not racist. He has shown us that by his daily behaviour since joining the club, as his team-mates have already testified,"" the statement read. The league's disciplinary commission, which will decide the punishments, could investigate Neymar's accusations against Gonzalez, who Marseille claim was spat on by Angel Di Maria. Marseille pledged to ""fully cooperate"" with any investigation and said the club would remain at the disposal of the commission. Any racist behaviour carries a maximum suspension of 10 matches. Spitting directed at another player can lead to a ban of up to six matches. Kurzawa meanwhile could be suspended for up to seven matches for violent conduct after aiming a punch at opposition full-back Amavi."

""Look at the racism. That's why I hit him,"" Neymar, who was returning from coronavirus quarantine, said as he left the pitch. Gonzalez later denied making a racist comment. ""The only regret I have is not hitting this idiot in the face,"" Neymar then posted after the game, before replying to a Gonzalez tweet to call him a ""racist"".

""It's easy for VAR to show my 'aggression'. 'Now I'd like to them to show the image of the racist who called me a 'MONKEY SON OF A BITCH'. I'd really like that!"" Neymar tweeted. Florian Thauvin's close-range volley on 31 minutes earned Marseille a first victory over their bitter rivals since November 2011 but the ugly scenes overshadowed the game at Parc des Princes. Neymar ""told me it was a racist insult, but I didn't hear anything on the pitch"", PSG coach Thomas Tuchel said. ""There is no place for racism in football but I don't think that was the case,"" Marseille coach Andre Villas-Boas told Telefoot. ""We'll have to look at it."" According to Telefoot, Gonzalez replied ""What racism?"" when he was asked about the incident. He also tweeted a picture of himself surrounded by multi-racial teammates. ""There's no place for racism,"" the Spaniard wrote, adding: ""Sometimes you have to learn to lose and take it on the field."" PSG sporting director Leonardo suggested referee Jerome Brisard lacked the experience to officiate such a highly-charged fixture. ""Fourteen yellow cards and five reds means the match was out of control,"" said Leonardo. ""Not to criticise the referee but perhaps it's not the time to officiate a 'clasico'."" Tuchel tried to downplay the defeat. ""I'm not angry. I think you have to separate the performance and the result. We played a great match, I'm happy with the quality, mentality and the effort,"" he said. ""I told the players if we continue to play like that we'll win every match. It was a great performance but the result is what it is."" PSG, runners-up to Bayern Munich in the Champions League final last month, have now lost their opening two games of a season without scoring for the first time since 1978/79. A frenzied schedule awaits Tuchel's coronavirus-hit side, starting with the visit of Metz in midweek and a trip to Nice next Sunday, and Neymar now faces a suspension. Marseille find themselves with an early six-point advantage as they attempt to close the gap on PSG, French champions seven of the past eight years. After fielding a depleted line-up at Lens on Thursday, Tuchel was able to recall Neymar and Angel Di Maria for a match played in front of around 4,000 supporters in Paris. However, Kylian Mbappe remained absent after testing positive for the coronavirus on France duty at the start of the week with Mauro Icardi and Marquinhos also still missing. Marseille 'keeper Steve Mandanda produced a magnificent reflex to keep out an effort from Marco Verratti just a minute in as tempers bubbled over frequently in the capital. Thauvin, who shone in Marseille's opening 3-2 win at Brest before the international break, made the breakthrough when he turned in a Dimitri Payet free-kick from point-blank range. Di Maria found the net for PSG just past the hour but had strayed behind the last defender, and Marseille's celebrations were cut short in similar fashion moments later when a Benedetto goal was ruled offside. PSG's last goal came in the 3-0 win over RB Leipzig in the Champions League semi-final on August 18, and Neymar poked wide from a Pablo Sarabia cross before the contest deteriorated at the finish. ""It's a bit disappointing we ended like that,"" said Thauvin. ""We didn't want to get into that sort of game."""

Both games ended in 1-0 defeats, but that is where the similarities end. PSG went toe-to-toe with Bayern in Lisbon. In Lens, the French champions enjoyed almost three quarters of possession but managed only one shot on target while the home team threatened on almost every attack. PSG only fielded four of the same starters in the two games. Against Lens, coach Thomas Tuchel gave league debuts to 18-year-olds Arnaud Kalimuendo and Kays Ruiz. ""We were playing together for the first time. It takes time, otherwise football would be simple and easy,"" said Italian international midfielder Marco Verratti. Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, Mauro Icardi and Angel di Maria, who between them scored two thirds of PSG's league goals last season, were all absent after testing positive for Covid-19. So was key central defender Marquinhos. Tuchel complained that the absence of the attacking ""Fantastic Four"" meant Ruiz and veteran Ander Herrera had to play attacking roles that do not suit them. ""It was necessary for them to create things and that's not their strength,"" Tuchel said. He could not say ""exactly"" whether any of the absent stars will be able to play on Sunday but added that they have been missing training. ""If they're there, OK, but they'll be in a physical condition where I can't expect them to be decisive. ""I'm not worried, but realistic,"" Tuchel said. ""If we have to play with the same team against Marseille, we'll do it."" The only expected change is number two goalkeeper Sergio Rico, in place of 20-year-old Pole Marcin Bulka, who presented Lens with their goal on Thursday by attempting to pass to Verratti. Verratti, returning from a calf injury that forced him to watch most of the Champions League final rounds from the bench, played the whole match against Lens. ""Normally, the maximum for him should have been to play 60 or 70 minutes,"" Tuchel said. ""We took a risk"". The French league season kicked off on August 21, two days before the Champions League final. Even though it has made a slow start with PSG and European semi-finalists Lyon absent, games postponed because of the coronavirus and an international break, PSG are already six points behind leaders Nice after Patrick Vieira's side won their first two games. PSG finished 12 points ahead of Marseille with a game in hand when last season was brought to an early halt by the pandemic and have won the league three straight years. PSG face a frenzied scheduled, hosting Metz next Wednesday before travelling to pacesetters Nice the following Sunday. Other than turning Icardi's loan into a permanent move and signing Rico, normally free-spending PSG have been quiet this summer, though Tuchel said he hoped veteran full-back Alessandro Florenzi would arrive from Roma over the weekend. av-ah/fbr/ole/pb/gj <org>SOCIETE D'EDITION DE CANAL +</org>"

The former Inter Milan and Galatasaray defender is Marseille's third signing this transfer window after the arrival of two 21-year-olds, French midfielder Pape Gueye from Watford and Argentine defender Leonardo Balerdi on loan from Borussia Dortmund. ""I might be 34 years old, but I can run more than anyone. Physically I feel good, I've trained every day, I'm a good professional,"" Nagatomo told reporters during his presentation. ""Other teams wanted me, but as soon as I got the offer from Marseille, I told my agent that I wanted to play here."" Nagatomo becomes the third Japanese to wear the Marseille jersey after Koji Nakata (2005-2006) and Hiroki Sakai who has been at the club since 2016. He arrives as an understudy to Frenchman Jordan Amavi, who coach Andre Villas Boas confirmed would remain Marseille's starting left-back. ""Amavi was our first pick last year, and that's not going to change... We made that clear to him (Nagatomo),"" said Villas-Boas, whose team will take part in this year's Champions League. ""We've signed an experienced player. He has a lot more experience than Jordan at this level of the Champions League. ""He has played 12 Champions League games in the last two and a half years at Galatasaray. That's what interests us."" Nagatomo said: ""Amavi is a great player. He is physically and technically very strong. But we have lots of matches ahead of us this season. ""We have the Champions League, the league and the cup. We're playing in several competitions and we can't go through the season with just 11 of us. All the players will have a role to play. I came here to play and help out the team.""

He has 122 Japan caps, winning the Asian Cup in 2011 and appearing at three World Cups. Nagatomo becomes the third Japanese to wear the OM jersey after Koji Nakata (2005-2006) and Hiroki Sakai who has been at the club since 2016. OM have already signed two 21-year-olds, French midfielder Pape Gueye from Watford and Argentine defender Leonardo Balerdi on loan from Borussia Dortmund.

""I admit I went through a difficult period but I worked a lot and I'm proud because I didn't give up."" ""I think I'm at 70 or 80 percent,"" he added. ""But if you had told me after so long without playing I was going to be at this level, I would have signed right away."" Marseille's scheduled opener last weekend was postponed after they suffered five cases of Covid-19. Dimitri Payet, Bouna Sarr and Alvaro Gonzalez were notable absentees for the trip to Brest as the club reported three further infections this week. However, goalkeeper Steve Mandanda and left-back Jordan Amavi were cleared to play after stints in quarantine, while Argentine defender Leonardo Balerdi made his Marseille debut after signing on loan from Borussia Dortmund. Thauvin needed just 20 minutes to fire Marseille in front, gathering possession on the right and slashing inside in trademark style before sweeping home on his left foot via a telling deflection that lifted the ball over Gautier Larsonneur's despairing dive. His free-kick picked out Duje Caleta-Car to volley in a second on 27 minutes, the goal belatedly awarded after a lengthy VAR review overturned an initial offside decision. Romain Faivre smashed in his first Brest goal just before half-time as Marseille's vulnerability in their first competitive match since March 6 continued to give the home side reason to believe. A Gaetan Charbonnier strike was ruled out for offside and the forward then sliced wide of an open goal before Marseille restored their two-goal advantage when another Thauvin free-kick was headed in by Croatian centre-back Caleta-Car. Charbonnier stabbed beyond Mandanda a minute from time to set up a nervy finish but Marseille clung on as Brest captain Jean-Kevin Duverne's last-gasp header landed on the roof of the net. Niko Kovac earned his first Ligue 1 victory as Monaco coach earlier on Sunday as his side won 1-0 at Metz. Teenage centre-back Benoit Badiashile scored for the second game in a row and Monaco held on despite playing almost half the match a man down following the dismissal of Youssouf Fofana. ""It was a very difficult match, especially in the second half with a player less. The reaction of the team, down to 10, was very good just like last week when they came back from 2-0 down,"" said Kovac, whose opening game in charge against Reims ended in a 2-2 draw. ""I'm happy to have won, particularly as Monaco's last win came back in February."" Jonathan Bamba continued to rediscover his scoring touch with Lille winning 1-0 at Reims. Lille winger Bamba, who scored only one goal in 26 league appearances last season, hit his second in two games of the new campaign in the 32nd minute of a dour game. Bamba crossed his arms across his chest after scoring, dedicating his goal to actor Chadwick Boseman, who played the superhero from ""Black Panther"" and died on Friday at the age of 43. Bordeaux are in second place, two points behind leaders Nice, after a 2-0 triumph at Angers courtesy of goals from Nigeria international Josh Maja and Toma Basic. Nantes are one of five sides on four points, along with Rennes, Lille and Monaco, as they defeated Nimes 2-1 despite finishing the game with just nine men. Romain Hamouma netted twice for Saint-Etienne in a 2-0 win over promoted Lorient as last season's French Cup runners-up also made a belated start to the new campaign."
47,25/08/2020,11:39,French football club Marseille reports three more virus cases,"French football giants Marseille announced Tuesday that three more people have tested positive for the coronavirus, following five players last week.","""Marseille has just learned that three new suspected cases of COVID-19 have been detected in its professional squad,"" the club said in a statement. Marseille, which had to cancel what would have been the Ligue 1 season opener last Friday because of the five existing coronavirus cases, added that it had notified the French league about the new infections. The five players already infected, whose names have not been divulged, are all asymptomatic, according to the club. Besides Marseille, several other Ligue 1 clubs have been affected by the virus, including Nimes, Montpellier, Lens, Nice, Angers, Monaco and Brest. Paris Saint-Germain, meanwhile, have obtained a derogation from league officials to push back their season-opening match, initially scheduled on Saturday against Lens, to September 10. PSG played in Sunday's Champions League final, losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich, meaning there would have been just six days between matches. Their return to domestic duty will come at a busy time, however, sandwiched between France's international match against Croatia on September 8 and the French capital side's opening home fixture of the season five days later against arch-rivals Marseille."
48,19/08/2020,13:43,Marseille boss Villas-Boas urges support for virus-infected players,Marseille coach Andre Villas-Boas on Wednesday urged support for the club's players infected by coronavirus.,"The club announced Tuesday the positive COVID-19 tests for three players, taking to four the number infected. The positive tests saw the French league forced into postponing the opening match of the 2020/21 Ligue 1 season, which had been scheduled to be between Marseille and Saint-Etienne on Friday. ""Unfortunately we live this week between a certain anxiety and bad news,"" Villas-Boas said. ""The pandemic that stubbornly continues to scare and affect so many families has ended up knocking on our door."" Villas-Boas vowed that ""we will soon be together again"". ""It's the moment to be careful and to support others and at the same time keep hope for the time ahead."""
49,18/08/2020,17:43,Ligue 1 season start reshuffled after Marseille virus cases,The French football league (LFP) on Tuesday reshuffled the opening weekend of Ligue 1 after the game scheduled to kick off the season was postponed following three more positive coronavirus tests at Marseille.,"Marseille were due to play Saint-Etienne on Friday evening in the first game shown by the league's new broadcast partner Mediapro on its specially created pay channel, Telefoot. The LFP filled the Friday evening slot by bringing forward the game between Bordeaux and Nantes, initially scheduled for Saturday. It will be the first league match in France since March 8. The LFP said the postponed Marseille match was to be played on either September 16 or 17 ""subject to changes in sanitary conditions within the Olympique de Marseille club"". The three fresh coronavirus cases took the total at Marseille to four, and the club said on Tuesday that all details had been relayed to the LFP. The LFP guidelines say that four cases mean the virus is ""widespread"" at a club. Regional daily La Provence reported that the three positive tests announced on Tuesday were from goalkeeper Steve Mandanda and midfielders Maxime Lopez and Valentin Rongier, names that the club would neither confirm nor deny to AFP, citing medical confidentiality. The earlier positive reportedly came from defender Jordan Amavi, who also hinted that was the case on social media. Andre Villas-Boas' side cancelled a friendly on August 14 against Stuttgart of Germany as a precaution. Fellow Ligue 1 side Nimes announced two new suspected cases in its squad and all employees have been put in isolation pending test results. Nimes had hosted Marseille on August 9 in a friendly. They are due to host Brest on Sunday in the first round of Ligue 1 matches. Some 40 players from 11 clubs have tested positive for COVID-19 in recent weeks. The vast majority contracted the virus after resuming training in June, leading to quarantine and a flurry of cancelled pre-season matches. Two matches slated for this weekend -- Paris Saint-Germain against Metz and Montpellier against Lyon -- had already been postponed because PSG and Lyon are playing Champions League semi-finals in Portugal. Because of the health crisis, stadium capacity has been capped at 5,000 though fan groups at several clubs said the rules mean they will not go to matches. Similarly, the collective of PSG ultras, the club's main fan group, said on social media that they will not hold an event on Tuesday evening, when their club plays Leipzig in the semi-final of the Champions League behind closed doors in Lisbon. ""We have not found any place that can accommodate our fervour while respecting the sanitary conditions,"" they posted."
50,17/08/2020,00:08,"New suspected coronavirus cases at Marseille, five days from new season","Three new cases of suspected coronavirus were revealed by French football giants Marseille on Sunday, just five days before they are due to kick-off the new Ligue 1 season.","The cases are amongst the ""workforce"", a statement said, and if confirmed would take the number at the club to four in the last four days. Andre Villas-Boas' side already cancelled a friendly on Friday against Stuttgart of Germany as a precaution. Under health protocols adopted in recent weeks which are awaiting final approval, the four cases could mean Marseille's scheduled opener against St Etienne on Friday may be called off. At least 37 Ligue 1 players from 11 clubs have tested positive for COVID-19 in recent weeks. The vast majority of them contracted the virus after resuming training in June, leading to quarantine and a flurry of cancelled pre-season matches. With only one positive case announced, fellow top-flight sides Bordeaux, Dijon, Lens, Monaco and Nimes have not seen their preparations too disrupted. On the other hand, Lille (with four cases), Saint-Etienne (five), Montpellier (six), Nantes (seven) and Strasbourg (nine) have all seen their pre-season affected. Montpellier, Nantes and Strasbourg have had to cancel several friendlies. ""When the players become negative again, we will be able to use them. But in what state, I do not know,"" said Strasbourg coach Thierry Laurey. Two matches will not take place this weekend - between Paris Saint-Germain and Metz and the game featuring Montpellier against Lyon. That is due to the Champions League semi-final commitments of PSG and Lyon in Portugal. ""Clubs have great fears over the resumption of the championship,"" said one unnamed Ligue 1 president. ""We are afraid of being in the situation where for three months we had the car in the garage without being able to take it out, and when we finally can get back on the road there is a risk of it breaking down."" Nice, meanwhile, have already decided to play their first match behind closed doors next Sunday against Lens. If Marseille do welcome Saint-Etienne on Friday, it will be at a relatively quiet Velodrome where only 5,000 fans will be allowed. Marseille's request for an exemption to allow 20,000 people inside the ground was rejected by local government."
51,04/08/2020,14:02,Marseille's Montpellier friendly cancelled due to suspected virus case,"Marseille announced on Tuesday their pre-season friendly match with fellow Ligue 1 side Montpellier has been cancelled following a suspected coronavirus case in their opponent's squad, less than three weeks before the start of the French top-flight campaign.","In a statement, Marseille said both clubs had agreed to call off the clash at the Stade Velodrome, which was scheduled to take place on Wednesday, ""as a health precaution"". One unidentified Montpellier player has tested positive for COVID-19 and will be tested again on Friday. If the case is confirmed, it will be the fifth player in Michel Der Zakarian's squad to be affected by the disease since the start of the pandemic. Midfielder Junior Samba, who was placed in an induced coma at the end of April, was the first Ligue 1 player to test positive for the virus. The cancellation comes following Montpellier's friendly last week with Strasbourg, who a few days after the match announced five of their players had tested positive for the virus. Andre Vilas-Boas's side are set to open the new term by hosting Saint-Etienne on August 21."
52,08/02/2020,23:30,Monaco up to fifth after frantic Ligue 1 finish,Former West Ham forward Payet proved the difference for Marseille as he struck from distance shortly after half-time at the Stade Velodrome to extend Marseille's unbeaten run to 16 matches in all competitions.,"Andre Villas-Boas' side are still nine points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain, who play Lyon at the Parc des Princes on Sunday. ""Today we needed a moment of inspiration, and Payet gave it to us,"" said Villas-Boas. Payet's winner covered up an uncharacteristically subdued Marseille display in which relegation fodder Toulouse dominated for long stretches and could easily have levelled in the closing stages. Marseille came into the match having beaten Saint-Etienne 2-0 midweek and a goalless draw last weekend. ""I think tiredness hit us, as well as a bit of anxiety,"" Villas-Boas said. Payet could have had a second late in the game but fired just wide after bursting through the Toulouse defence. Veteran goalkeeper Steve Mandanda preserved Marseille's lead with an impressive diving save from Belgian forward Aaron Leya Iseka's shot in the 85th minute. Marseille now have an eight-point lead over third-placed Rennes after they dropped points in a goalless draw with Brest. Lille are just one point further back after they beat troubled club Angers 2-0 on Friday. Angers' chairman Said Chabane was charged this week with sexual assault after several women made allegations. Patrick Vieira's Nice side slumped to a 3-1 defeat at home to Nimes despite scoring first but the club backed by chemicals giant INEOS are just two points behind Monaco despite a patchy restart since the winter break."
53,05/02/2020,23:42,Payet dedicates win to Marseille fans caught in Saint-Etienne no-go zone,Dimitri Payet scored a brilliant goal as second-placed Marseille claimed a 2-0 victory at Saint-Etienne on Wednesday to cut the gap to Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain back to 12 points although hundreds of their diehard fans were stopped from watching the game.,"Andre Villas-Boas' Marseille opened up a six-point lead over third-placed Rennes, who lost 1-0 at Lille on Tuesday, by bouncing back from successive goalless stalemates against Bordeaux and Angers. The match was delayed by 15 minutes after clashes between the two sets of fans outside the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. According to firefighters and the Saint-Etienne prosecutors' office, there were no injuries or arrests. However, the game was played without visiting supporters -- believed to number around 400 -- who left under police escort despite making a round trip of around 650km. Payet gave Marseille a seventh-minute lead with a magnificent individual goal, shaping to cross before cutting onto his left foot and hammering the ball past bewildered home goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier from what seemed an impossible angle. The former West Ham United star has scored 10 goals in all competitions this season. ""I was looking for the cross, but I saw that he (Ruffier) wasn't in his goal at all, so I took the opportunity to hit it hard,"" Payet told Canal+. ""I will dedicate this match to our supporters who unfortunately this evening made the round trip but couldn't reach the stadium."" Saint-Etienne rarely threatened, although Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda had to be alert to keep out Lois Diony's effort shortly before half-time. The away side made the points safe in the 85th minute, as Nemanja Radonjic drilled a fine left-footed shot into the bottom corner. Earlier on Wednesday, Lyon failed to close the gap to the top three as they were held to a goalless draw at home by lowly Amiens. Rudi Garcia's side sit sixth in the table, seven points adrift of Rennes, who occupy the third and final Champions League qualification spot. Rayan Cherki, 16, came off the bench but was denied a winner when his effort struck the post. ""Too many players have been below their normal level,"" said coach Garcia. ""We gave our best and it wasn't much."" Elsewhere, bottom club Toulouse were cut further adrift with a 1-0 loss to Strasbourg, while Montpellier moved into fifth despite a 1-1 home draw with Metz. On Tuesday, PSG edged to a 2-1 victory at Nantes to strengthen their position at the top of the table."

The hosts rarely threatened against a solid Angers outfit at the Stade Velodrome, but did extend their unbeaten run in all competitions to 12 matches. Villas-Boas defended his side when asked if they rely too much on star Dimitri Payet, who missed the game through suspension. ""With 11 guys behind the ball, where do you want us to go? You need dribbling, winning duels, finding the last pass or goal and Payet does just that,"" said the Portuguese coach. ""But Barcelona are (Lionel) Messi-dependent, Juve are (Cristiano) Ronaldo-dependent. If we are Payet-dependent, I have no problem with that."" Nemanja Radonjic fired narrowly wide for Marseille on the stroke of half-time, while the away side almost snatched a 90th-minute winner when Antonin Bobichon's effort flew over. But Angers failed to muster a single shot on target, with their opponents managing just two. Marseille sit five points clear of Rennes in the race for automatic qualification for next season's Champions League group stage, after the third-placed side were held to a 1-1 draw at Nice on Friday. Elsewhere on Saturday, Monaco slipped to a 3-1 home defeat by Strasbourg to leave new coach Robert Moreno still waiting for a first Ligue 1 win after three matches. The principality club, who drew 3-3 with PSG before being thrashed 4-1 by the champions in former Spain boss Moreno's first two league games, sit 12th in the table and eight points behind Rennes. Montpellier edged out struggling Dijon 2-1 to move into fourth, while former Sunderland winger Wahbi Khazri scored twice in Saint-Etienne's 2-1 win over Nimes."

The visitors stretch their unbeaten run to nine games and moved eight points clear of the Bretons with the win. ""A draw might have been fairer for a match like that,"" Villas-Boas said. ""It's a very good result for us as we move away from our opponents in the table."" Reigning champions PSG have two games in hand on Marseille and face Robert Moreno's Monaco on Sunday and again three days later in a rescheduled match. Marseille are bidding for a first French title since 2010 and underlined their credentials as PSG's closest challengers by ending third-placed Rennes' five-game winning streak. Visiting goalkeeper Steve Mandanda only had to make one difficult save to deny Benjamin Bourigeaud just before half-time at Roazhon Park, after Alvaro had struck the woodwork for Marseille. On Saturday, struggling Lyon visit Bordeaux, while Lille have the chance to leapfrog Rennes and move into the Champions League places when they face Dijon on Sunday."
56,05/01/2020,18:21,Marseille avoid Cup embarrassment after penalty shoot-out,Andre Villas-Boas' Marseille needed penalties to win away to fourth-tier Trelissac in the last 64 of the French Cup on Sunday.,"Lassana Diakhaby and Ange Gnaleko missed the crucial spot kicks for the minnows as the 10-time former winners avoided a second straight cup exit to a side from National 2. Abdoulaye Diaby scored for the hosts after 20 seconds following a goalkeeping howler by Yohann Pele and France midfielder Dimitri Payet equalised after 20 minutes for the visitors who had Japan right-back Hiroki Sakai sent off in the closing stages of normal time. ""In your worst dreams you don't need to suffer in that way,"" Villas-Boas said. ""If we had been knocked-out without Sakai and with a humiliation like that, it would have been tough to take,"" he added. Pele made up for his early mistake by saving Diakhaby and Gnaleko's efforts before Lucas Perrin slotted the winning penalty. Marseille were knocked out of the competition by Anrezieux at the same stage last season."
57,03/12/2019,21:09,"Maja hat-trick hammers Nimes, Marseille close gap",Nigeria international Josh Maja scored a hat-trick as Bordeaux hammered Nimes 6-0 to go third in Ligue 1 as Andre Villas-Boas' second-placed Marseille moved within two points of leaders Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday with a 2-0 victory at Angers.,"London-born Maja, 20, who joined the French club from Sunderland in January, netted three times in half an hour in a game delayed for 25 minutes as more than 20 Bordeaux fans invaded the pitch at the Matmut Stadium. The supporters, who climbed down onto the field after 11 minutes, were targeting club president Frederic Longuepee after being refused from flying a banner calling for his resignation. ""It's an amazing feeling, I don't think it has sunk in yet,"" Maja told broadcasters Canal+. ""Once I get home and speak to my family will I realise what I've done and I'll be really happy,"" he added. Maja, who made his debut for the Super Eagles in October's friendly draw with Ukraine, claimed his first after 24 minutes and added a second to double his tally for the season 13 minutes later. He saved his best finish for this third effort firing high above Paul Bernardoni eight minutes into the second half for his first hat-trick in senior football. Nicolas De Preville and a double from Brazilian midfielder Otavio made sure of all three points moving Paulo Sousa's side up to third in the table, five points behind Marseille. Midfielder Dimitri Payet was involved in both goals at Angers, setting up Morgan Sanson for the opener before converting from the penalty spot as Andre Villas-Boas' side extended their unbeaten run to five. ""PSG's position doesn't occupy our minds, our goal is to finish second at the end of the season,"" Villas-Boas said. ""If we can beat Bordeaux on Sunday it can allow for a bit of a gap on other teams before the Christmas break,"" he added. The Portuguese boss kept faith with the side which beat Brest 2-1 on Friday electing against giving match-winner Nemanja Radonjic a spot in the starting lineup. Angers boss Stephane Moulin made five changes from the weekend's loss to Nice as Ismail Traore took over the captaincy from Thomas Mangani. Villas-Boas' men claimed the lead after 17 minutes as Sanson registered his second goal in four league games. Payet played his free-kick quickly to find midfielder Sanson who side-footed cooly past Ludovic Butelle. The former West Ham playmaker doubled the advantage after 41 minutes slotting his third penalty of the season. Japan right-back Hiroki Sakai was tripped up in the Angers box and the France attacker scored his fifth goal of the season. Marseille held on during the second half to move on to 31 points, with PSG, who have played two games fewer, on 33. Elsewhere, Italian Cristian Battocchio scored a hat-trick as Brest moved up to 12th spot with a 5-0 hammering of Strasbourg. And Lyon lost 1-0 at home to Lille after defensive errors enabled Jonathan Ikone to grab the decisive goal. On Wednesday PSG can restore their five-point lead over Marseille as they welcome Nantes, who have recovered from a run of four straight defeats, to the French capital."
58,25/11/2019,00:04,Marseille retake second place in Ligue 1 with Toulouse win,Marseille reclaimed second spot in Ligue 1 when they won 2-0 at 10-man Toulouse who cracked in the final 15 minutes.,"Earlier on Sunday, Bordeaux edged in-form Monaco 2-1 at home to briefly climb into third and Saint-Etienne drew 0-0 at home against Montpellier. In Toulouse, the home team were reduced to 10 men when right back Steven Moreira drove his studs into Bouna Sarr's knee and received a red card after a video review. Marseille dominated a scruffy match but struggled to break down Toulouse. The home team defended in depth and even had a chance to take the lead in the 70th minute but goalkeeper Steve Mandanda saved Ibrahim Sangare's header with his foot. Marseille responded with a decisive moment of inspiration in the 76th minute. Dimitri Payet drew defenders then threaded a clever reverse pass to the darting Dario Benedetto who danced past Baptiste Reynet and coolly slid the ball into the goal. Three minutes later, Toulouse presented Marseille with a second. Left-back Issiaga Sylla drove a clearance into Valere Germain. The ball bounced to Nemanja Radonjic, who advanced into the penalty area and curled a shot into the net. ""We played a good game and the victory is deserved,"" said Marseille coach Andre Villas-Boas. Toulouse ""closed up the game after the red card,"" said Villas-Boas. ""Don't forget Mandanda's decisive save before we opened the scoring. We knew that the first goal would be very important. ""We keep our second place and we have to keep going like this."" Marseille climbed to 25 points from 14 matches, eight behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain but one ahead of Angers. Bordeaux and Saint-Etienne are fourth and fifth on 22. Toulouse remain second from bottom. Depleted Bordeaux, already deprived of defenders Mexer and Vukasin Jovanovic who were both suspended, midfielder Youssef Ait Bennasser, who could not play because he is on-loan from Monaco, lost centre-back Laurent Koscielny to injury on Sunday morning and winger Jimmy Briand during the warm-up. Monaco, who had climbed away from the relegation zone with three victories in their previous four league games, took the lead against Bordeaux with a goal by Islam Slimani on 15 minutes. After that, even though the hosts' fans fell silent in the first half as part of a protest against their owners, the visitors failed to exploit the makeshift home defence. Instead, Brazilian Pablo levelled with a powerful header from a corner after 29 minutes. In the 67th minute, Slimani handled while standing in the wall at a free kick, conceding a penalty and incurring his second yellow card. Nicolas de Preville converted the spot-kick to give Bordeaux victory. ""There were a lot of players from the starting XI who were not here,"" Bordeaux midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni said. ""This shows the strength of character of our team. Some of them didn't have much playing time this season. They stood up."" Later on Sunday, Saint-Etienne drew 0-0 at home against Montpellier as the sides managed just two shots on target."
59,11/11/2019,00:17,Payet fires Marseille to fiery derby win after fans attack Lyon bus,Dimitri Payet scored twice as 10-man Marseille beat rivals Lyon 2-1 on Sunday in a bad-tempered derby which was overshadowed by the behaviour of a record home crowd.,"The build-up to the game was focused on former Marseille boss Rudi Garcia's return to the Stade Velodrome after his controversial decision to join Lyon as coach, but it is more likely to be remembered for ugly scenes off the pitch. Home supporters attacked the Lyon bus with stones, bottles and other projectiles on its way to the stadium, before visiting players were repeatedly bombarded with objects thrown from the crowd while taking corners during the match. Payet netted a first-half double as Marseille moved second in the Ligue 1 table, eight points adrift of Paris Saint-Germain. The Lyon team coach was left with two shattered windows by the pre-game ambush, with club president Jean-Michel Aulas threatening to pull his team out of the match if anything else happened. ""We were bombarded with stones, bottles and other projectiles. It's a disgrace, it's just sick,"" regional newspaper La Provence reported an unidentified passenger of the bus saying. The match was also suspended for two minutes in the second half due to thick smoke billowing around the pitch, coming from pyrotechnics by the record Marseille crowd of 65,421. Earlier in the evening, around 6,000 fans had gathered at a city beach to perform a short but boisterous ceremonial parade to celebrate Marseille's 120th anniversary. Controversy also reigned on the pitch early on, as Marseille were awarded a penalty in the 13th minute for a clear handball by Thiago Mendes. But there was a lengthy stoppage for a VAR review, before Leo Dubois collapsed to the floor in apparent agony after being lightly slapped by Dario Benedetto as the players waited for the penalty to be taken. Another VAR check deciding against sending off the Marseille forward, with Payet slamming the spot-kick into the top corner five minutes after it had been originally awarded. Lyon struggled to pose a threat up front, although their players did have to avoid several missiles, including plastic bags and cups, thrown from the stands. Marseille moved two goals in front when Payet, who was in inspired form, won the ball from Bertrand Traore inside his own half, before later finishing the move with a low drive into the bottom corner. Lyon gave themselves hope shortly after the interruption as Moussa Dembele headed home in the 59th minute when Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda and defender Alvaro left Traore's cross for each other. Spaniard Alvaro was sent off just minutes later for hauling down Dembele with the striker clean through on goal. But OM managed to hold on despite some late Lyon pressure, with Martin Terrier blasting the final chance wide in the 90th minute. ""It's a night to enjoy,"" said Marseille boss Andre Villas-Boas. ""Payet was very motivated, he had a great match. ""I hope it will continue. We had a great desire to win the game. We felt that, and we had talked about that desire this week."" Garcia's Lyon remain 14th in the table, only four points above the relegation zone. Elsewhere on Sunday, Lyon's local rivals Saint-Etienne moved up to fourth with a 3-2 victory at Nantes, who have slipped from second to ninth in the table after four straight league defeats. PSG had extended their advantage at the top on Saturday thanks to Mauro Icardi's late winner in a 2-1 success at Brest."
60,08/11/2019,02:35,PSG hail Navas as bitter rivals Marseille and Lyon clash,"If Paris Saint-Germain have been held back in recent years by their lack of a truly top-class goalkeeper, Keylor Navas showed just why they were so keen to bring him to the French capital with his midweek performance in the Champions League.","The Costa Rican joined PSG in September from Real Madrid as Alphonse Areola moved in the other direction, and on Wednesday his late penalty save helped secure a 1-0 win over Club Brugge that clinched his side's place in the last 16. The last line of defence for Real as they won three successive Champions Leagues between 2016 and 2018, Navas is yet to concede a goal in Europe since arriving in Paris. Indeed, the 32-year-old has let in only five goals in 12 matches for Thomas Tuchel's side. ""He is an extraordinary goalkeeper. He won three Champions Leagues with Real Madrid in a competition where goalkeeper is such an important position. They can change the outcome of a game,"" remarked midfielder Marco Verratti after Wednesday's game, in which Mauro Icardi scored the winner. ""He will bring so much experience and calmness to the side,"" said sporting director Leonardo. Leading sports daily L'Equipe on Thursday gave over its front page to the goalkeeper with a headline referencing 1982 Jean-Paul Belmondo action comedy The Ace of Aces. And yet less than a week ago it is true that Navas hardly covered himself in glory as PSG suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at Dijon. Then again, neither did any of his teammates, and Europe is where this team will really be judged. A trip to Real Madrid later this month, when Neymar should be fit again, could be revealing. In Ligue 1, PSG have lost three of their opening 12 games and yet they are already seven points clear of Angers at the top. They travel to face Brest on Saturday where Tuchel will again have to decide whether to leave the club's all-time top goal-scorer, Edinson Cavani, on the bench. Icardi has been preferred to the Uruguayan recently and has now scored eight times in the last seven matches. Few tears were shed among Marseille fans when Garcia left his job as coach at the Velodrome at the end of last season. In contrast, there was plenty of unrest in the Lyon support when the 55-year-old was appointed as successor to the sacked Sylvinho last month. Garcia's recent past with Marseille was always going to be difficult to swallow for Lyon fans given the frankly bitter rivalry that has developed between the clubs. On Sunday, Garcia heads back to Marseille with his new team for the 'Olympico' as the sides jostle for position in a packed table behind PSG. Lyon are 10th but sit just four points behind Marseille in fourth and have won their last three games, including a precious 3-1 defeat of Benfica in the Champions League in midweek. Garcia has been dealt a major blow, though, with the news that Memphis Depay -- scorer of 11 goals in 14 games this season -- will miss the match with a hamstring injury. 8 - The number of goals scored by Mauro Icardi in PSG's last seven matches. 5 - Lyon have won their last five Ligue 1 meetings with Marseille and are unbeaten in 10 encounters since a 4-2 defeat in May 2014. 10 - Lille are unbeaten in their last 10 home league games, a record they will hope to extend as they entertain Metz on the rebound from a 4-1 loss at Valencia which eliminated them from the Champions League."
61,02/11/2019,21:00,Relief for Villas-Boas as Marseille down Lille,Marseille took advantage of two comical defensive mix-ups to secure a 2-1 win at home to Lille on Saturday that sent them up to third in Ligue 1 and alleviated some of the pressure on coach Andre Villas-Boas.,"Morgan Sanson stroked home the opening goal on 48 minutes after Lille goalkeeper Mike Maignan spilled a cross following a hefty collision with team-mate Gabriel. The Brazilian centre-back unwittingly gifted Marseille a second goal 11 minutes from time when Valentin Rongier's tame shot struck Dario Benedetto before Adama Soumaoro's attempted headed clearance struck Gabriel and looped in off the post. Lille captain Soumaoro rose magnificently to nod in a corner to give the visitors hope but Marseille held on to move level with second-place Nantes on 19 points. It was just a second win in seven league outings for Marseille and the ideal tonic for a team dumped out the League Cup in midweek following a display branded ""shameful"" by Villas-Boas. That 2-1 loss at Monaco followed a 4-0 humbling away to Paris Saint-Germain, a defeat which left OM winless in 16 Ligue 1 meetings with their greatest rivals. ""I think we deserved the win. We played with everything we'd been missing the past two matches,"" said Villas-Boas. ""We spoke (this week). We were all frustrated because we played two good second halves, which shows we're capable of doing it. It just needs to be applied for 90 minutes."" As for Lille, Christophe Galtier's side have not won away from home in the league since March and missed the opportunity to reduce the gap to leaders PSG. The defending champions suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at the hands of Dijon, who started the weekend at the foot of the table, on Friday with coach Thomas Tuchel accusing his expensively-assembled team of ""being too passive and not playing together"". It was the third loss of the season for PSG who could also see their lead at the top trimmed to just five points by the end of the weekend. Saturday's evening clash between Nimes and Rennes was postponed due to heavy rain."
62,30/10/2019,23:37,Monaco pile on misery for Marseille with League Cup win,"Marseille's season suffered another setback Wednesday when they were knocked out of the French League Cup 2-1 at the hands of Monaco, just days after they endured a 4-0 defeat by PSG in Ligue 1.","With just one win in their last seven matches, the pressure is on coach Andre Villas-Boas with a cup exit compounding Marseille's modest seventh position in the league table which sees them already 11 points behind champions PSG in the title race. Despite making seven changes from the side which started the 1-0 win over Nantes last weekend, Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim still had enough firepower to see off Marseille. Both Monaco's goals came in the first half. On-loan striker Jean-Kevin Augustin opened the scoring in the 25th minute from a cross from Ruben Aguilar. Aguilar added the second goal five minutes from the interval. Marseille grabbed a consolation in the 77th minute when Benjamin Lecomte put through his own goal. There will be no let up for Marseille this weekend when they welcome third-placed Lille to the Stade Velodrome."
63,05/08/2019,18:15,Marseille sign Argentina striker Benedetto,"Marseille have signed Argentina forward Dario Benedetto from Boca Juniors on a four-year deal, the Ligue 1 outfit announced on Monday.","Benedetto, 29, who has made five international appearances since his debut in 2017, has reportedly cost the French club 16 million euros ($17.9 million). He scored 39 goals in 63 matches in three years, twice winning the league for Argentine giants Boca after spells with Tijuana and Club America in Mexico and Gimnasa, Arsenal and Defensa in his home country. Following Spanish defender Alvaro Gonzalez he is Andre Villas-Boas' second summer signing since the Portugese coach took the reins from Rudi Garcia ahead of the new campaign. The Velodrome side start the new term by hosting Reims on Saturday in their fifth season outside of the Champions League. In order to comply with UEFA's financial fair play regulations Marseille have been forced to sell winger Lucas Ocampos and Clinton N'Jie and they chose against renewing Mario Balotelli's contract."
64,25/07/2019,13:23,Cameroon striker Njie signs for Dynamo Moscow,"Cameroon international Clinton Njie has completed his transfer from Marseille to Dynamo Moscow, the Russian Premier League side announced on Thursday.","""Clinton Njie to Dynamo!!! Today, the Cameroon forward signed a contract with our club for four years,"" Dynamo Moscow wrote on their Twitter account, adding that he will wear the number nine shirt. The transfer fee has not been made public. The 25-year-old began his career at Lyon. After an unsuccessful two-year spell at Tottenham Hotspur, he joined Marseille, initially on loan, in 2016. Njie first played for Cameroon in 2014 and was a part of their squad in the recent Africa Cup of Nations, scoring in their last 16 defeat by Nigeria."
65,16/07/2019,17:46,Outcast Rami to miss Marseille US trip,"France World Cup winner Adil Rami has been left out of the Marseille squad for the pre-season tour of the US, the club announced on Tuesday.","Rami, 33, was already the subject of a club disciplinary procedure by the Ligue 1 side. The decision followed the appearance of the World Cup winning defender as a participant on a physically demanding French television gameshow. The episode was broadcast on June 29 but recorded late last season, at a time when Rami claimed he was injured and was missing training under former coach Rudi Garcia. ""Adil Rami needs to ask himself, but deeply, about his status, his profession as a footballer, on his rights and his obligations as a player especially as a world champion,"" Marseille president Jacques-Henri Eyraud said on July 10. Eyraud added the centre-back had not been sacked. In June, ex-Baywatch star Pamela Anderson revealed the pair had broken up following a high-profile two-year relationship. Under new boss Andre Villas-Boas, Marseille will face fellow French clubs in Bordeaux and either Montpellier or Saint-Etienne in a pre-season tournament in Washington later this month as well as playing MLS outfit DC United. Fellow World Cup winner Florian Thauvin will also miss the trip to the US after suffering an ankle injury in a 4-0 loss to Rangers on Sunday. So far this summer France's only Champions League winners have lost all three of their friendlies including the rout against the Scottish side. Marseille will miss out on European football completely for the coming campaign after finishing in fifth place in Ligue 1 last season."
66,03/07/2019,19:32,Uber Eats bows to fans and removes green from Marseille shirt logo,Uber Eats has changed the colour of the logo that will appear on Marseille shirts next season to placate the club's fans.,"In the company logo the word 'eats' is green, but that is the colour of one of Marseille's hated rivals, Saint-Etienne. Fans responded to news of the sponsorship with a campaign on social media and with a banner hanging from a bridge over one of the main streets of the city demanding ""no green on our shirts"". ""Partner of all those who love OM, Uber Eats will be displayed in black on the jersey,"" tweeted the company on Wednesday, with a picture of the club's jersey with both 'Uber' and 'eats' in black."
67,29/05/2019,20:09,Villas-Boas to impose 'radical philosophy' on Marseille,"Andre Villas-Boas made a bold start to his reign as Marseille coach by declaring on Wednesday he wants to impose a ""radical philosophy"" on the fallen French giants.","Marseille handed Villas-Boas a two-year contract on Tuesday, giving the former Chelsea, Tottenham, Porto and Zenit St Petersburg coach the chance to revive the fortunes of a club that has slumped again this season. The 1993 European champions missed out on qualifying for European football next season after finishing fifth in Ligue 1 despite a team comprising Italian striker Mario Balotelli and France international Florian Thauvin. ""There will be victories, there will be defeats and we are going to struggle to get to (qualify for the Champions League) but we have the capacity to do it,"" Villas-Boas said in his first press conference. ""I will lay down my life to get Marseille back to their best level. I will let the results do the talking but I'm confident because this team is capable of it."" The former protege of Jose Mourinho admitted he did have a tendency to want to ""control everything"" and said he was ""a little bit obsessed by the organisational side of things"" but he stressed he wanted his players to play with a smile on their faces. ""My philosophy is to be radical but we must strike a balance, based on this culture in French football of technical excellence, but blend it with speed and creativity,"" he said. Villas-Boas was Mourinho's assistant at Porto and became the youngest coach to win a UEFA competition, lifting the Europa League trophy. A move to the Premier League and Chelsea followed but he was sacked after just seven months and later took over at Tottenham. After 18 months at Spurs, Villas-Boas resurfaced at Zenit St Petersburg in 2014, winning the Russian Premier League title and cup during a two-year spell. A stormy spell at Shanghai SIPG followed before a period out of football during which he took part in last year's Dakar Rally, withdrawing with injury after an early crash. Villas-Boas said it was possible that Ricardo Carvalho, the former Portugal defender, could become his assistant on the Marseille coaching staff. Carvalho played at Ligue 1 club Monaco from 2013 to 2016."
68,21/01/2019,00:08,Last-gasp Dembele wins derby for Lyon as Marseille halt slide,"Moussa Dembele grabbed a stoppage-time winner for Lyon in a 2-1 victory over bitter foes Saint-Etienne on Sunday, while Marseille snapped a wretched run of nine games without a win as they beat Caen 1-0 in Ligue 1.","Romain Hamouma headed Saint-Etienne into the lead on 21 minutes at the Stade Geoffroy Guichard, but Nabil Fekir converted a second-half penalty to haul Lyon level following a handball by Loic Perrin. An unmarked Dembele headed over in the dying stages after coming on as a substitute, but the forward made no mistake with another chance moments later to floor the hosts in the 95th minute. ""We do this job for this kind of feeling,"" said Lyon coach Bruno Genesio. ""It was an excellent derby. Both teams got properly into it."" Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes had earlier pulled off a stunning triple save to keep the visitors in the game, twice denying the in-form Wahbi Khazri before tipping away Hamouma's follow-up. Saint-Etienne again had a chance to win the match in a frantic goalmouth scramble but Remy Cabella was thwarted by Lopes and Leo Dubois produced a vital block to repel Lois Diony's subsequent effort. ""Honestly, I knew this job was cruel but today was a bit of a knockout blow,"" said Saint-Etienne coach Jean-Louis Gasset. ""We gave everything. Both teams had chances and would have each deserved a point."" A pitch invasion by angry home fans caused a lengthy stoppage when Lyon won 5-0 last season, and tempers again briefly threatened to boil over following the final whistle on Sunday. Lyon climbed back above their rivals into third place after dealing Saint-Etienne a first home loss of the season. Earlier, Marseille recorded a first win since late November despite losing the influential Dimitri Payet to a knee injury after just 24 minutes. Morgan Sanson, on as a substitute for Payet, guided home a header from a Kevin Strootman cross two minutes after the interval to earn Marseille a welcome three points. Caen played most of the second half with 10 men after Frederic Guilbert was dismissed for a second booking. Marseille had faced angry supporters in heated exchanges following last weekend's 1-1 home draw with Monaco, the culmination of a dismal run that included a humiliating French Cup defeat by fourth-tier amateurs Andrezieux at the start of the month. ""I'm not relieved. I'm happy for the players because it confirms the good things we'd done in the last two matches against Monaco and Saint-Etienne,"" said Marseille coach Rudi Garcia, who again faced calls to resign from Marseille fans in the away section. He also provided an update on Payet, saying he was unsure whether he would be available for next week's visit of Lille. ""I don't know. It's never good when it's the knee,"" said Garcia. ""He felt it all of a sudden... I think it was a Caen player who fell on top of him, or something like that, when he was on the ground."" Marseille moved up to seventh and to within six points of the Champions League spots after inflicting a fifth home defeat in six outings on a Caen outfit with just three wins all season. Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani both scored hat-tricks on Saturday as Paris Saint-Germain romped to their biggest-ever home win with a 9-0 thrashing of bottom side Guingamp. Meanwhile, Thierry Henry's nightmare spell in charge of Monaco took another turn for the worse as Cesc Fabregas gifted Strasbourg a goal and fellow new signing Naldo was shown a seventh-minute red card in a 5-1 home humbling."
69,06/01/2019,17:08,Marseille suffer cup humiliation to fourth-tier Andrezieux,Marseille have been plunged deeper into crisis after they were embarrassingly dumped out of the French Cup 2-0 by fourth-division Andrezieux on Sunday.,"Goals from Bryan-Clovis Ngwabije in the 17th minute and Florian Milla seven minutes from the end humiliated Rudi Garcia's side, who last season reached the final of the Europa League, and leaves them winless in seven matches. Ngwabije, who hadn't scored a goal since the start of the season, told Eurosport that he had ""dreamed"" of making such a big impact. Marseille's poor run of form has seen them knocked out of both domestic cup competitions and the Europa League, which they exited at the group stage last month. They are a whopping 20 points behind runaway Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain, but more importantly five away from Lyon and the final Champions League place. Marseille join fellow Ligue 1 sides Montpellier, Nimes and Angers out of the cup. Meanwhile struggling Monaco, locked in a relegation battle, struggled to a 1-0 win over fifth-tier Canet en Roussillon despite playing with a man extra for over 70 minutes. Moussa Sylla's second-minute strike ensure just the fifth win in all competitions for Thierry's side, who are second-from-bottom in Ligue 1."
70,22/12/2018,23:24,Mbappe fires PSG past Nantes as Monaco lose again,"Kylian Mbappe grabbed the winner as Paris Saint-Germain beat Nantes 1-0 to go into the winter break unbeaten in Ligue 1, as Thierry Henry's Monaco suffered defeat by rock-bottom Guingamp on Saturday.","World Cup star Mbappe stole in at the far post in the 67th minute for his 13th league goal of the season, making him France's top scorer with Neymar away on holidays in Brazil. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel can also go on holiday relaxed with his club on 47 points, as second-placed Lille, 13 points adrift, lost 2-1 at home to Toulouse. ""I'm very happy because we can see the progress of the team,"" said Tuchel. ""You can feel the energy, it's a good thing to build on next year."" With Neymar away, Angel Di Maria was in the line-up and came closest to making it 2-0, forcing a fine save from Nantes goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu, who then watched the Argentine hit the crossbar from the rebound. Meanwhile, third-placed Lyon drew 1-1 at fourth-placed Montpellier after opening the scoring thanks to their captain Nabil Fekir before a great header from Ruben Aguilar gave the surprise-package southerners a share of the spoils. Henry's Monaco were dreadful and the former Arsenal striker spat on the ground after Nolan Roux of Guingamp made fools of the Monaco defence to make it 2-0. ""I'm not going to have a good holiday,"" bemoaned Henry. ""Now you have to work and make do with what you have. ""It's necessary to work and work. There are still a lot of points to play for and that's the only positive thing about this evening."" Monaco were champions in 2017 but now have 13 points from 18 matches, just two more than Guingamp, and vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said the club needs to dip into the January transfer market. ""Until tonight, I thought we didn't need new players, but we do,"" Vasilyev told Canal+. ""It's difficult to analyse right now as I'm upset like the supporters. I understand the disappointment, it's up to us to act and draw the right conclusions."" Strasbourg paid hommage to the victims of a terror attack that killed five people on December 11 in their first home game since as they won 2-0 against Nice. Meanwhile, Marseille, in sixth, drew 1-1 at Angers and fifth-placed Saint-Etienne beat Dijon 3-0."
71,26/11/2018,00:21,Thauvin hat-trick lifts Marseille into top five,A hat-trick from Florian Thauvin gave Marseille a 3-1 win at Amiens and lifted them back into the Ligue 1's top five on Sunday.,"Marseille have had a mediocre start to the season with last year's beaten finalists suffering the humilation of elimination from the Europa League at the group phase. But Thauvin's commanding performance in northern France showed their fortunes are on the up, partly thanks to the return of influential central defender Jorge Rolande after a six-month absence with an Achilles injury. Marseille went behind to Bakaye Dibassy's strike but Thauvin equalised on 26 minutes. With 10 minutes remaining Thauvin curled a free kick over the Amiens wall and a small deflection helped it fly into the left-hand corner. Virtually from the restart, Dmitri Payet was felled by Jordan Lefort as he prepared to shoot in front of goal. But Payet's spot-kick was too straight and easily saved by Amiens goalkeeper Regis Gurtner. Thauvin got his third goal when Maxime Lopez delivered a pass to the right and the France international's shot squeezed in at the near post. Marseille have 25 points, one fewer than Lille who were beaten 2-0 at Patrick Vieira's Nice. Third-placed Montpellier blew the chance of overtaking Lyon, who beat Saint-Etienne 1-0 in the central French derby on Friday, when they were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Rennes. Paris Saint-Germain stretched their lead to 15 points at the top after barely breaking sweat in a 1-0 win at home to Toulouse on Saturday that set them up for the midweek Champions League clash against Liverpool. Neymar and Kylian Mbappe were rested to allow injuries to heal but are expected to return for the must-win Group C match."
72,12/11/2018,00:10,Cavani bags hat-trick as perfect PSG leave Henry's Monaco down and out,Thierry Henry's disastrous start as coach of Monaco continued on Sunday as Edinson Cavani's VAR-assisted hat-trick helped Paris Saint-Germain to an easy 4-0 win in the principality that saw them extend their perfect record in Ligue 1 this season.,"Neymar netted a penalty to complete PSG's victory, as they made it 13 wins from 13 league games under Thomas Tuchel, further stretching their start to the season that is a record in France and in Europe's so-called big five leagues. The result for them came after a week marred by revelations from French investigative website Mediapart that youth scouts at PSG had subjected potential signings to racial profiling over several years. But while they go 13 points clear of second-placed Lille at the Ligue 1 summit, the club who have been their main challengers in recent seasons continued their deeply worrying slump, with Henry again left to look on helplessly from the touchline. Champions in 2017, Monaco are in the relegation zone and five points away from outright safety having failed to win in six matches in all competitions since the Arsenal and France great took charge. They have now gone 16 games without a win altogether, with this result following a 4-0 home reverse against Club Brugge which knocked them out of the Champions League. Monaco are on their worst run in France's top flight in 32 years, at a time when Football Leaks claims about their Financial Fair Play breaches and the arrest of their Russian billionaire owner Dmitry Rybolovlev on corruption charges have cast a further shadow over the club. ""We are playing for survival, nothing else,"" said Henry, who has picked up a squad cursed by injuries. Here he was missing a dozen players due either to injury or suspension at kick-off, while both Belgian international Nacer Chadli and his replacement Jordi Mboula had to come off hurt. ""We lost two more players tonight, so it is starting to become a lot,"" he said, adding: ""I am staying positive because even with all that we managed to create chances against PSG."" The average age of his bench here was under 19, while his starting line-up featured a 17-year-old debutant in defence in Benoit Badiashile. It was little wonder that PSG -- themselves showing six changes following their Champions League draw at Napoli -- found the going so easy. They went ahead in the fourth minute when Neymar drove the ball across goal for Cavani to convert. The goal was initially disallowed before being given by the Video Assistant Referee, and the same thing happened in the 11th minute when Cavani turned the ball in again after the flag was wrongly raised for an offside against Moussa Diaby. In contrast to those two goals, a fine Julian Draxler finish in first-half stoppage time was initially given before being disallowed on review. However, Diaby squared for Cavani to complete his hat-trick in the 54th minute, and Neymar then rolled in a penalty after Kylian Mbappe had been fouled by France teammate Djibril Sidibe. ""I am very satisfied with the result, and with the fact we showed the hunger to win a 13th straight game. That is extraordinary,"" said Tuchel. ""Monaco and Henry are in a very difficult situation with lots of players out injured. This wasn't the night for Monaco to challenge us. They can do that if they have all their players back but not today."" Elsewhere on Sunday, Lucas Ocampos and Adil Rami scored as Marseille bounced back from a run of four straight defeats to beat Dijon 2-0 on an emotional afternoon at the Velodrome. A minute's silence was held before kick-off in memory of the eight people killed when two buildings collapsed in the southern French city on Monday. The result lifted Marseille up to sixth, back to within three points of third-placed Montpellier, who beat them 3-0 last weekend. Bordeaux were held to a goalless draw by Caen, while Rennes drew 1-1 with local rivals Nantes."
73,08/11/2018,23:42,"Arsenal progress despite Sporting stalemate, Chelsea ease through","Arsenal booked a place in the Europa League knockout stage and extended their unbeaten run to 15 matches despite a 0-0 draw with Sporting Lisbon on Thursday, while Olivier Giroud's first goal of the season sent Chelsea through.","But Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck, given a rare start just hours after being named in Gareth Southgate's England squad, had to be stretchered down the tunnel with what looked a nasty ankle injury in the first half. Arsenal midfielders Matteo Guendouzi and Aaron Ramsey were both visibly upset after Welbeck, who is out of contract at the end of the campaign, went down after jumping to win a header. ""It is mentally challenging (playing after a teammate is injured) but sometimes it comes with the game, and Danny has had a lot of injuries,"" winger Alex Iwobi told BT Sport. ""We wish him the best and will keep on encouraging and motivating him to get back."" Unai Emery's Gunners were the better side for long periods at the Emirates against a team who have already had three different managers this term, but were forced to settle for a point despite Sporting being reduced to 10 men late on when former Barcelona centre-back Jeremy Mathieu was sent off. But Arsenal did secure a last-32 spot regardless, as Vorskla Poltava lost 1-0 at home to Azeri outfit Qarabag in the other Group E game. Chelsea made it four wins from four matches in Group L by edging out a spirited BATE Borisov 1-0 in Belarus. Giroud ended his 11-game goal drought this season by giving Chelsea a 53rd-minute lead, and the Premier League giants held on despite BATE striking the woodwork three times in the match. ""I was hoping to score soon because I came back late from the World Cup and I was lacking maybe a bit of efficiency and luck but you always need to keep working hard and keep the faith and that's what happened tonight,"" France striker Giroud told BT Sport. The Londoners moved six points clear of Hungarians Vidi at the top of the group and have not tasted defeat in 17 matches since losing the Community Shield to Manchester City in August. Steven Gerrard's Rangers saw their 11-game unbeaten run in this year's Europa League come to a dramatic end as they threw away the lead three times in a 4-3 defeat at Spartak Moscow. Both sides were the beneficiaries of comical own goals in a crazy first half which ended with Glenn Middleton putting the Scots 3-2 ahead, but Luiz Adriano and Sofiane Hanni both scored in the space of 71 seconds to snatch Spartak victory. Rangers are now level on points with Spartak in an incredibly tight Group G, one point behind leaders Villarreal after the Spaniards' goalless draw with Rapid Vienna in Austria. ""For me, football is about levels and, if you don't defend properly and you don't do the basics well enough, high-level players and high-level teams normally punish you and that was the case tonight,"" Gerrard told the Rangers website. Reigning Scottish champions Celtic gave themselves a lifeline in Group B, as Odsonne Edouard's 79th-minute strike saw them beat RB Leipzig 2-1 in their must-win clash at Parkhead. Salzburg, semi-finalists last season, qualified for the next round with a 5-2 thrashing of Rosenborg in the group's other match, as Japanese forward Takumi Minamino scored a hat-trick. Elsewhere, Eintracht Frankfurt reached the last 32 with their fourth win from as many group games by beating Apollon Limassol 3-2 in Cyprus, while Lazio joined them in progressing from Group H as goals from Marco Parolo and Joaquin Correa secured a 2-1 win over Marseille to eliminate last season's runners-up. AC Milan stayed just a point adrift of Group F leaders Real Betis after Suso's second-half equaliser grabbed a 1-1 draw in Spain. Record five-time winners Sevilla needed a late penalty from Ever Banega to claim a 3-2 victory at Akhisar Belediyespor, after having a man sent off, losing a two-goal lead and seeing the Turks miss a spot-kick of their own."

Paul Lanse made sure of the result and put his side level on 25 points with Lille in the table with a neat side-footed finish with 20 minutes left. Montpellier took their chance to snatch second spot from Lille after their rival's 2-1 defeat at runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain on Friday night. PSG are 11 points clear of their nearest challengers after Kylian Mbappe and Neymar fired the champions their 12th straight win, beating Tottenham Hotspur's old 11-match record for consecutive wins at the start of a season. ""Yes it's serious, it's serious to play a second half like the one we played,"" said Marseille coach Rudi Garcia. ""So it will change. I am very angry, I am as responsible as the players for this defeat, but my team is the one that played the first half, not the second. How to explain it? I've no idea."" With Sunday's defeat Marseille slip back to sixth thanks to a last-gasp Romain Hamouma winner that gave Saint-Etienne a dramatic 4-3 win over Angers and allowed them to jump up to fifth. In Sunday's other match Nantes hammered rock bottom Guingamp 5-0."
75,26/10/2018,13:01,"Chastened by Champions League woes, PSG head to old foe Marseille",Paris Saint-Germain's deepening Champions League woes have turned the focus back to the strength of competition -- or lack of it -- in the French top flight as they prepare to face bitter rivals Marseille this weekend.,"On Wednesday, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe were shut out and PSG needed a brilliant injury-time goal from Angel di Maria to salvage a 2-2 draw at home to Napoli. Thomas Tuchel's side now face a real fight just to qualify for the Champions League knockout rounds, having already been beaten at Liverpool. After disappointing last-16 exits against Barcelona and Real Madrid in the last two seasons, Tuchel is tasked with finally making the Qatar-owned club a genuine contender in the Champions League. It is therefore galling for those in charge in the French capital to find themselves at risk of an early exit. ""I knew it was perhaps the most difficult group we have had in my time here,"" said midfielder Marco Verratti after Wednesday's game. ""Now we need to go and get a great result in Naples, and then everything will be decided at home against Liverpool. I still think we can qualify."" Tuchel admitted Paris have to improve, but weaknesses in his team were badly exposed by Napoli. Yet at the same time PSG go to Marseille having won all 10 games in Ligue 1 this season, smashing the previous French record of eight straight victories at the start of a campaign, set by Olympique Lillois in 1936. Another three points on Sunday and PSG will match Tottenham Hotspur's achievement of 11 successive wins at the start of the 1960-61 season, a record in Europe's big five leagues. Tuchel's team are already eight points clear of Lille atop the table, and 11 points above Marseille in fourth. A sixth title in seven seasons seems inevitable even now. That should not be a huge surprise, given that PSG's operating budget -- a reported 500 million euros ($568m) -- is almost double that of France's next richest club, Lyon. When PSG played Lyon earlier this month, they won 5-0, and perhaps the lack of a proper challenger domestically removes some sharpness from their game in Europe. Nobody said that of Monaco when they reached the semi-finals of the Champions League in 2017, of course. Nevertheless, the results of French teams in Europe this season have led to much soul-searching. Europa League finalists last season, Marseille are already staring at an early exit from the competition after losing 3-1 to Lazio on Thursday, not ideal preparation for the meeting with PSG at the Velodrome. Marseille, the only French team to have won the Champions League, despise the club from the capital, and the clash between the country's two biggest sides is a major event in France. However, seven years and 17 games have passed since Marseille last beat PSG. Second-placed Lille host Caen on Saturday, while Thierry Henry makes his home debut as Monaco coach against Dijon. The former Arsenal and France star lost 2-1 at Strasbourg in his first match in charge last weekend. His depleted team then drew 1-1 with Club Brugge in Belgium in the Champions League, and Monaco have now gone 12 games without winning. ""I know every little corner of the stadium and lots of memories will come back,"" said Henry of returning to the Stade Louis II, where he began his playing career. ""I am not looking for excuses but starting with two matches away from home was not the best way to reassure ourselves. ""Monaco are not used to being in this situation. We have several players who played for struggling teams last season and we need their experience."""
76,22/10/2018,00:06,Vieira's Nice continue to struggle with Marseille loss,Patrick Vieira's Nice slumped to a fourth defeat in five home league games this season as Morgan Sanson's first-half strike fired Marseille to a 1-0 win in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"It was a laboured performance from Nice, who sit 14th in the table and only two points above the relegation play-off spot, eight points adrift of fourth-placed Marseille. Vieira may need a good run of results if he is to keep his job long enough to take on former Arsenal and France teammate Thierry Henry when his side visit Monaco on December 8. ""Unfortunately, tonight's match reflects our other home games,"" said Vieira. ""(Forwards) Allan (Saint-Maximin), Mario (Balotelli) and Myziane (Maolida) have not been successful. In the last 30 metres there has been a lack of quality, we haven't always made the right choices."" For Marseille, all eyes will now be on next Sunday's clash with arch rivals and runaway league leaders Paris Saint-Germain at the Velodrome. The hosts went into the match having mustered only seven goals in nine league games this season, and Vieira responded by handing Mario Balotelli just his third start of the campaign up front. The first decent chance at the Allianz Riviera fell to the Italy international, but after latching onto a long ball forward from Dante his well-struck volley was kept out by the legs of Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda. A clever dummy from Balotelli created space for Allan Saint-Maximin, but his shot was tame and easily gathered by Mandanda. The away side grabbed the lead in the 42nd minute, though, as full-back Bouna Sarr skipped clear down the right-hand side and crossed for Sanson to smartly turn and fire into the bottom corner. Nice plugged away in search of an equaliser but never looked like having the quality to break through, with centre-back Dante's looping volley onto the roof of the net the best effort Vieira's men could muster. Balotelli, who was strongly linked with Marseille during the close-season before opting to stay at Nice, has failed to score this term after netting 43 goals over the last two campaigns. ""Mario? He was just like the team -- very good in the first half, then he wasn't as good. He still has to work,"" said Vieira. Earlier on Sunday, Montpellier moved into third as goals from Gaetan Laborde and Andy Delort sealed a 2-0 win over Bordeaux, while Saint-Etienne drew 1-1 against Rennes. Henry suffered a miserable return to French football on Saturday as Monaco lost at Strasbourg in his first match as a head coach, while PSG thrashed Amiens to make it 10 successive wins to start the season."
77,30/09/2018,23:18,Bamba double leads Lille to victory over Marseille,Jonathan Bamba hit a second-half penalty and struck at the death as Lille stunned Marseille 3-0 on Sunday to move up to second place in France's Ligue 1.,"Marseille travelled north hoping to close the 11-point gap to arch-rivals Paris Saint-Germain after the capital club tightened their grip on the lead with a 3-0 win at Nice on Saturday. But Marseille coach Rudi Garcia, who famously led Lille to a rare league and Cup double in 2011, was sent back to the drawing board after a mediocre performance by the southerners left them in sixth place. Lille, in second, are now eight points behind PSG with Montpellier one point further behind in third after a trouble-hit 3-0 win over Nimes earlier on Sunday. Marseille showed little attacking flair in a balanced first half in Lille. And Garcia's men were made to pay for their lack of creativity when Nicolas Pepe got up from a foul just after the hour mark to send 'keeper Steve Mandanda the wrong way from the spot. The hosts doubled their lead on 86 minutes when Bamba, from an almost carbon copy foul, got up to beat Mandanda. Lille completed the win in some style, Fode Ballo-Toure barging Japan defender Hiroki Sakai off the ball to set up Bamba for an easy tap-in from close range in the closing minutes. Earlier, former champions Montpellier risked losing all three points due to unruly fans who forced two stoppages in their 3-0 win over local rivals Nimes. The first 'Languedoc derby' in 25 years had promised plenty of drama, but neither players nor officials were quite ready for the incidents that threatened its cancellation and the points to be awarded to struggling Nimes. Dominant from the outset, Montpellier had taken their lead to 3-0 by the 79th minute thanks to goals from Ambroise Oyongo, Andy Delort, who scored a penalty 10 minutes into first-half stoppage time, and Gaetan Laborde. But virtually claiming all three points wasn't enough for some of the rowdier fans in the crowd who -- following an initial seven-minute interruption when a barrier caved in -- then climbed the barriers to run on to the pitch. French riot police quickly restored order, while Montpellier president Laurent Nicollin intervened in a bid to restore calm. The incidents could lead to sanctions for Montpellier, who are now nine points behind runaway leaders and champions Paris Saint-Germain, who saw Neymar hit a brace Saturday in a 3-0 win at Nice. ""I can understand the fans, but they should also control their behaviour,"" said Montpellier coach Michel Der Zakarian. ""The club will be heavily sanctioned, we will pay fines, and maybe they will close that part of the stadium. ""Everyone will be sanctioned,"" added Der Zakarian, who was quick to praise his players. ""You can't take anything away from the players, we dominated them (Nimes) from start to finish."""
78,26/09/2018,23:14,Record-setting PSG make it seven wins in seven,Paris Saint-Germain set a new club record on Wednesday when a 4-1 victory over Reims gave them a seventh win from seven games this season and an eight-point lead in Ligue 1.,"With a perfect 21 points, new coach Thomas Tuchel surpassed the previous best start of 19 points by predecessor Unai Emery last season. The champions can now claim another slice of history on Saturday where a victory over Nice will allow PSG to equal Lille's all-time record of eight wins at the start of a season set back in 1936-1937. Missing the injured Lassana Diarra and suspended Kylian Mbappe, PSG surprisingly fell behind to Reims after just two minutes on Wednesday when Xavier Chavalerin stunned the Parc des Princes. But Edinson Cavani levelled after five minutes and then won the 24th-minute penalty which was converted by Neymar. Uruguay striker Cavani hit the third before half-time to take his season's goal tally to five, the same as Neymar. Thomas Meunier tucked away the fourth in the 55th minute after being set up by young striker Moussa Diaby much to the delight of watching US basketball legend Michael Jordan in town for this week's Ryder Cup. Moussa Dembele scored his first two goals for Lyon in two minutes in Dijon to set his team on course for an 3-0 victory that lifted them into second in Ligue 1. The 22-year old striker, who joined from Celtic on August 31, scored the opener after 17 minutes with a first-time chip over the goalkeeper and two minutes later added a second, acrobatically putting home a rebound. Martin Terrier headed a third in the 35th minute. On a night when six early matches produced six red cards, Lyon played the last 34 minutes with 10 men after Lucas Tousart received a second yellow card. Dijon's Enzo Loiodice followed in the final minute. Lyon are on 13 points from seven games, eight behind PSG. Lille, who started the evening in second, lost 1-0 at Bordeaux. Francois Kamano put the home team ahead after just seven minutes. Lille played the last few minutes with 10 men after Adama Soumaoro received a second yellow card. The other two teams who could have climbed to second, Marseille and Montpellier played games that followed similar patterns until the dying seconds. Montpellier fell behind at Caen to a goal by Saif-Eddine Khaoui after 10 minutes. Andy Delort and Damien Le Tallec resplied and put the visitors ahead and, briefly, second in the league. But Yacine Bammou leveled after 64 minutes. Seven minutes from time, Montpellier's Vitorino Hilton was sent off for a wild sliding tackle. Caen created dangerous chances, but Montpellier held on to draw 2-2. In Marseille, Kenny Lala broke away and put Strasboug ahead after 27 minutes. The home team replied twice just before half time. After Florian Thauvin was sent flying in the 41st minute, Dimitri Payet coolly converted the penalty. Then Morgan Sanson curled a shot inside the post to put Marseille ahead on the stroke of half time. After Jordan Amavi received a straight red in the 52nd minute the 10 men of Marseille held out until the 89th minute when Nuno Da Costa leveled for the visitors. Marseille responded with one last attack, and Valerie Germain met a low cross with a ferocious shot to secure a 3-2 win."

Danny Welbeck nodded in a second just after half-time and Aubameyang curled in the Gunners' third, with Mesut Ozil also on target before a lapse in concentration saw Vorskla hit back with two late goals. ""I think we played well in the first half and in the beginning of the second as well,"" Aubameyang told BT Sport. ""We have to improve and try to fight not to concede a goal like we did in the last minute."" Premier League leaders Chelsea made a winning start to their Group L campaign as Willian's seventh-minute effort was enough to see off PAOK at a hostile Toumba Stadium. Eden Hazard was omitted from the Chelsea squad at his own request due to fatigue, but manager Maurizio Sarri fielded a strong side as the Blues extended their winning run to six games in all competitions. ""We were in control of the match for 90 minutes. We had a lot of opportunities. We missed them and so I'm very happy with the three points, very happy with the performance, but not very happy with the result,"" said Sarri. ""When it's time to kill the match, we have to kill the match."" Steven Gerrard's Rangers acquitted themselves well on their first appearance in the group stage of a European competition since the 2010-11 Champions League, as they came away with a 2-2 draw against Villarreal. A disastrous start for the Glasgow side saw Carlos Bacca fire Villarreal ahead inside 60 seconds, but Scott Arfield turned home a cross from Daniel Candeias to level on 67 minutes. Gerard Moreno put the hosts back in front almost immediately, only for Kyle Lafferty to again hit back for Rangers as Gerrard's men made a solid start in Group G. Leigh Griffiths hit a late winner for Celtic in a 1-0 home victory over Rosenborg, a team Brendan Rodgers' side knocked out in this season's Champions League qualifying rounds. Salzburg triumphed in the clash of Red Bulls in the other Group B fixture as Fredrik Gulbrandsen scored a minute from time to give the Austrian club a 3-2 victory over RB Leipzig. Marseille, last season's runners-up, slumped to a 2-1 home defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt in Group H as Luka Jovic grabbed an 89th-minute winner for the reigning German Cup champions. Lucas Ocampos opened the scoring early for Marseille, who were playing behind closed doors at the Stade Velodrome after numerous crowd incidents last season. But Lucas Torro levelled on 52 minutes for Eintracht before Jovic's late strike won it. Dudelange, the first Luxembourg team to play in the Europa League group stage, made seven-time European champions AC Milan work hard for a 1-0 win in Group F. Luxembourg's Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa were in the crowd as Dudelange, who have a dozen non-professional players in their squad, succumbed to a deflected second-half goal by Gonzalo Higuain. Record five-time winners Sevilla launched their Group J campaign with a 5-1 rout of Standard Liege, as Ever Banega and Wissam Ben Yedder both netted twice for the Spaniards."
80,16/09/2018,22:55,Payet stunner helps Marseille thrash Guingamp,Dimitri Payet scored a stunning goal as Marseille thrashed Guingamp 4-0 at the Stade Velodrome on Sunday to move second in the Ligue 1 table.,"After Florian Thauvin had opened the scoring early in the second half, Payet met a dipping ball 30 yards from goal with a magnificent side-footed volley which flew into the net off the crossbar. Winger Thauvin added another spectacular goal late on, and Payet teed up Kostas Mitroglou to finish off a blistering second-half display. Rudi Garcia's Marseille took second place from Lille in the table on goal difference, but remain five points adrift of reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain, who brushed aside Saint-Etienne 4-0 on Friday. The best chance for the home team in a disjointed first-half performance fell to Thauvin, but his shot was blocked after a jinking run had created space inside the box. Marseille coach Garcia sent on Maxime Lopez at half-time to replace Lucas Ocampos, and his side almost took the lead in the 50th minute when Greek striker Mitroglou somehow sent a diving header onto the post from barely a yard out. OM were posing a far greater threat in the second period, and Thauvin looped a 57th-minute header over Guingamp goalkeeper Karl-Johan Johnsson to score with the first shot on target of the match. Marseille wrapped up the points against a toothless Guingamp 17 minutes from time, as former West Ham star Payet produced an early goal-of-the-season contender. Thauvin did his best to match Payet, as he showed great control before cutting inside and curling a wonderful strike into the far top corner from the edge of the area. The 25-year-old, who scored 26 goals in all competitions last season, has now netted five times in as many appearances this term. Payet turned provider in the 83rd minute, rolling the ball perfectly into the path of Mitroglou, who had time to take a touch and slot in to complete the rout. Guingamp remain rooted to the foot of the table, having lost all five of their matches so far in the campaign."
81,10/09/2018,18:31,Marseille ordered by UEFA to play Europa League game behind closed doors,"Marseille are no longer at risk of being kicked out of European competition but will have to play their next Europa League game behind closed doors, UEFA said on Monday.","The French giants had appealed to European football's governing body against a threatened ban from competing in continental competition that was handed down in July. The ban, suspended for two years, was related to numerous crowd incidents in last season's Europa League in games against RB Leipzig and Salzburg as well as in the final against Atletico Madrid in Lyon. But instead of that they will now have to play their first home game of this season's Europa League group stage, against Eintracht Frankfurt on September 20, in an empty Stade Velodrome. The threat of having to play a second home game behind closed doors will hang over them for a two-year probationary period, although Marseille will also have to shut the stands at both ends of their ground for their other two Europa League group games, against Lazio and Apollon Limassol of Cyprus. Marseille, who lost last season's final 3-0 to Atletico, were sanctioned for crowd disturbances, acts of damage, setting off of fireworks and the throwing of objects in last season's European campaign, said UEFA. In addition to the stadium ban, a fine of 100,000 euros ($116,041) has been maintained, and Marseille have also been ordered to foot the bill for damage caused by their supporters at Lyon's stadium during the final."
82,03/09/2018,00:32,Marseille come from behind to stun Monaco,Marseille came from behind to beat southern rivals Monaco 3-2 on Sunday thanks to a 90th minute winner from Valere Germain.,"Konstantinos Mitroglou kissed Dimitri Payet's right boot after his superb cross allowed the Greek to give Marseille the advantage right on half-time at the Stade Louis II. Youri Tielemans hit back for Monaco on 48 minutes before World Cup winner Adil Rami, watched by US actress girlfriend Pamela Anderson, failed to clear properly and Falcao gobbled up the loose ball to smash a shot into the roof of the net and put the home side ahead. But Florent Thauvin equalled things up from a Hiroki Sakai pass before Germain's header sneaked in at the near post to give Marseille a memorable win. Rami joked that his error ""had made a match of it, all on my own"". ""I am going to get down to work, I need to show a better side of myself,"" he said. With seven points from four games, Marseille trail leaders Paris Saint Germain, who beat Nimes 4-2 on Saturday, by five points."

The 22-year-old winger scored 11 goals in 46 matches, in all competitions, for Red Star last season as they won the Serbian league title.

84,26/08/2018,22:53,Marseille close in on Roma midfielder Strootman,"Roma's Dutch international midfielder Kevin Strootman is poised to join French club Marseille in a deal reported to be worth 25 million euros ($29 million), sources close to the Italian club said on Sunday.","""He will be in Marseille tomorrow (Monday),"" a spokesman for the Roman club told AFP with the transfer window in France closing next Friday. The 28-year-old was not named by Roma coach Eusebio Di Francesco in his squad for Monday's Serie A game against Atalanta. ""There are negotiations in progress for Kevin, the various parties are evaluating it,"" Di Francesco confirmed at the team's pre-match press conference. According to media reports, agreement has been reached on a five-year deal with an annual salary of six to seven million euros. ""Since his arrival in Rome he has always been considered an important player,"" continued Di Francesco. ""It's a choice to make together, we have to see the desire of everyone to continue together."" Strootman arrived in Rome in 2013 from PSV Eindhoven, but suffered a serious knee injury the following year which sidelined him for almost two seasons. But he has found his place again in the Roma side and was a semi-finalist in last season's Champions League with the team. The Dutchman worked with current Marseille coach Rudi Garcia during his time with Roma between 2013 and 2016. Garcia nicknamed Strootman ""the washing machine"" because of his ability to make the most of even bad passes. Capped 41 times for the Netherlands, before his injury he was considered one of the emerging midfield stars of the game, earning the captain's armband aged 22 in 2012."

He was forced off midway through the second half, with Yohann Pele taking his place. Marseille also lost Bouna Sorr to a fractured toe on a miserable night for last season's Europa League runners-up. Mandanda was the back-up to Hugo Lloris during France's triumphant World Cup campaign in Russia, although he did play in their last group game, a 0-0 draw with Denmark. The injury setback means he will miss France's matches against Germany and Netherlands early next month in the inaugural UEFA Nations League."
86,19/08/2018,23:22,"Magical Nimes stun Marseille, Mandanda injured",Newly-promoted Nimes humiliated their distinguished southern neighbours Marseille 3-1 on Sunday to maintain their fairytale start to life back in Ligue 1.,"Goals from Denis Bouanga, Sada Thioub and Renaud Ripart earned last season's Division Two runners-up a famous scalp in their first home game in the French topflight since the 1992/93 season. And it came a week after they opened with a 4-3 win at Angers which has lifted the side with the lowest Ligue 1 budget into the unlikely position of second in the fledgling table, level on points with the wealthiest team in the league, Paris Saint-Germain. As if this embarrassing loss wasn't punishment enough for Marseille coach Rudi Garcia he suffered another blow when his World Cup winning keeper Steve Mandanda had to come off with an apparent injured thigh. Bouanga stunned Garcia's men when he fired the former employers of Eric Cantona into a 34th minute lead, Mustapha Diallo supplying the assist from the left. The Stade des Costieres erupted in celebration to mark the club's first Ligue 1 goal scored at home in 25 years. The Le Mans-born Gabon international was inking his name in the club's history just a month after joining from Lorient. Nimes were in front until four minutes after the restart when Florian Thauvin stylishly completed a move against the run of play begun when Valere Germain intercepted a Nimes freekick. Parity lasted until after the hour when Bouanga was at the heart of a counter finished off by Thioub who rounded Mandanda to tap in to an empty net. Marseille's hopes of salvaging something took a hit when Mandanda came off, with Yohann Pele coming on in the France World Cup winner's place. Ripart rounded off a magical evening for Nimes three minutes from time to leave Marseille already lagging three points off PSG. Earlier, Bordeaux were beaten 2-1 by Toulouse with the loss failing to lift spirits at the club after the suspension of coach Gustavo Poyet. The Uruguayan's future is in serious doubt after he was served with a one week ban for an angry tirade at club bosses over the sale of striker Gaetan Laborde to Ligue 1 rivals Montpellier. Eric Bedouet, one of Poyet's assistants, took charge for Sunday's derby but hopes of a pick-me-up on the pitch were dashed by Leya Iseka and Mathieu Dossevi, who scored for Toulouse in either half. Bedouet sprang to the defence of Poyet at the post-match press conference, describing the former Chelsea and Tottenham player as ""a charming, competent man...who loves the club"". ""It's never ideal when a manager leaves like that,"" he added in explanation of the team's showing in the derby defeat."

It capped a miserable week for beaten Europa League finalists Marseille, who will have to make do with a return to Europe's second-tier competition despite beating Amiens 2-1. Nice missed out on the Europa League with Saturday's defeat, and coach Lucien Favre announced he was leaving the club after the game. Marseille's defeat by Atletico Madrid on Wednesday in Lyon had ensured that the third-placed finishers in Ligue 1 would join the top two in the group stage of Europe's premier competition, rather than face the qualifying rounds. ""The group this year has done very well, it is a fair reward to finish third,"" Lyon captain Nabil Fekir told French television, before refusing to commit his future to the club. ""I don't know, frankly. I gave everything at Lyon, we'll see for the future. It hasn't been perfect this season, but it's a good finish."" Lyon were the first of the three sides in contention to slip up, as Alassane Plea raced clean through on goal and fired through the legs of home goalkeeper Anthony Lopes to put Nice ahead. OL desperately needed a quick leveller after half-time and Depay provided just that. Fekir did excellently to twist into space and square for Depay to tap home. Depay has arguably been the best player in France during the latter stages of the season, and the Dutchman produced the moment of magic needed to send Lyon into the Champions League. The former Manchester United flop showed magnificent creativity and execution to roll a free-kick under the wall and into the bottom corner to score his 18th goal of the campaign and his ninth in as many games. Depay completed a sublime treble late on by dinking the ball over away goalkeeper Walter Benitez, and although Plea fired home from long range in the 89th minute, Lyon held on as Nice missed on a Europa League spot. Marseille struck first in the race for the Champions League against Amiens at the Stade Velodrome, as teenager Boubacar Kamara's clever pass picked out Morgan Sanson who slammed a fierce shot into the roof of the net to give Rudi Garcia's men an 11th-minute lead against Troyes. Just seconds after Lyon fell behind at the Groupama Stadium, things got even better for Garcia's team as Kostas Mitroglou reacted quickest after Lucas Ocampos' header was saved to stab in the ninth goal of his first Ligue 1 season. But Amiens hit back to give Lyon a boost, as Moussa Konate took advantage of some terrible home defending to halve the deficit before half-time. Visiting midfielder Thomas Monconduit was rightly sent off for a horrendous challenge as he slammed his studs into the planted leg of Ocampos, who was lucky not to escape serious injury, early in the second half. Marseille saw out the win, but the three points provided little joy as results elsewhere meant they wasted two chances to return to Europe's top table in just four days. ""Everyone started screaming in the stands and we thought it was 3-3 in Lyon,"" said Marseille star forward Florian Thauvin. ""We've had a good season, but haven't been rewarded."" Monaco knew that they would be assured of a Champions League place if they avoided defeat and a double from Rony Lopes and Jordi Mboula's late strike saw them relegate Troyes with a comfortable win. That result sent Troyes down to the second tier with already-relegated Metz, as Toulouse secured a playoff with a 2-1 victory over Guingamp. Elsewhere, Caen held champions Paris Saint-Germain to a goalless draw to secure safety, while Bordeaux thrashed Metz 4-0 to join Marseille and Rennes in the Europa League."
93,18/05/2018,02:10,Jaded Marseille prepare for Champions League last chance,"After Dimitri Payet's tears and the bitter disappointment of losing the Europa League final, Marseille must rouse themselves for one last effort as they try to snatch a Champions League place.","Saturday in France brings the final round of games in Ligue 1, with Marseille locked in a three-way fight with Monaco and Lyon for two Champions League qualifying berths behind title-winners Paris Saint-Germain. Marseille are at a disadvantage though, and not just because of the mental and physical scars left by their 3-0 defeat at the hands of an Antoine Griezmann-inspired Atletico Madrid in Lyon. Rudi Garcia's team are fourth in the table, a point behind Lyon and three points behind Monaco. Their goal difference is also inferior to that of their rivals. They host Amiens at the Velodrome needing to win and hope Lyon slip up at home to Nice at the same time. Monaco need just a draw at relegation-threatened Troyes to secure their top-three spot. ""We are all disappointed and frustrated. But having lost one final, we have another one coming up on Saturday,"" said striker Valere Germain, who was haunted by missing a great early chance to put Marseille ahead against Atletico. ""We need to win at all costs to get into the Champions League and experience more of these kinds of nights against top teams. ""There is no fear of losing everything. We knew that we had everything to play for this week."" One player they have lost is skipper Payet, who came off crying in the first half of the final after clearly aggravating a hamstring injury that prevented him from playing in the 3-3 Ligue 1 draw at Guingamp last weekend. One consequence of Wednesday's game -- which could end up benefiting OM -- is that the top three in France will now all qualify automatically for the Champions League group stage. Previously, the team finishing third in France would have entered in the third qualifying round in late July. However, with Atletico having already qualified via their position in La Liga, the berth on offer to the Europa League winner is passed down to Ligue 1. It would be a huge surprise if Monaco missed out, even if their opponents Troyes need to win to realistically stand any chance of avoiding automatic relegation. But Lyon's position is more fragile. Bruno Genesio's side had won eight games in a row before a late collapse saw them lose 3-2 in Strasbourg last time out, denting their morale before a tricky final assignment at home against Nice. The visitors need to win to be sure of joining Rennes in qualifying for the Europa League, and their in-form striker Mario Balotelli will be determined to make an impact in what should be his last appearance for the club. ""We are lucky because our fate is in our own hands. It is down to us to seize our chance,"" insisted Genesio. Saturday's other games include champions PSG away to Caen, who need a draw to be sure of staying out of the relegation play-off place, a position currently occupied by Toulouse. All the focus was on Payet's injury and Germain's miss, but Thauvin's poor performance was another factor in Marseille's final defeat. It will also have been noted by France coach Didier Deschamps as he prepared to announce his World Cup squad on Thursday evening. Thauvin has been outstanding in the league this season, though, scoring 22 goals, and he can be the man to keep Marseille's Champions League dream alive.

94,17/05/2018,07:51,Atletico see off Marseille to win Europa League,"Antoine Griezmann was the hero for Atletico Madrid as the French striker scored twice in their 3-0 win over Marseille in Wednesday's Europa League final, allowing his club to win the trophy for the third time in nine seasons.","It is Griezmann's first major title as an Atletico player, and a fitting way to bow out if he leaves at the season's end, with Barcelona tipped as his next destination. Griezmann -- brought up in Macon, just 70 kilometres from Lyon -- scored once in each half, his lethal finishes coming either side of Marseille losing Dimitri Payet to injury, the French side's captain coming off in tears. He now has 29 goals for the season, although it was Gabi's late strike that put the seal on the victory. Marseille had been desperate to win the second European trophy in their history, on French soil, 25 years after beating AC Milan in the inaugural Champions League final in Munich. But it was a flat night for their huge support, who threatened to ruin the occasion by constantly lighting flares and setting off firecrackers at one end of the stadium, with some even being thrown onto the pitch towards the end. The game carried on regardless, with Rudi Garcia's side well beaten by Diego Simeone's Atletico. Their triumph comes after their agonising defeats to city rivals Real Madrid in the Champions League finals of 2014 and 2016. They had previously won the Europa League in 2010 and again in 2012, the latter coming just six months after Simeone's appointment. Simeone served a touchline ban here, meaning assistant German 'Mono' Burgos nominally took charge, but that did not perturb them on the field. Having fallen into this competition by virtue of a shock group-stage exit from the Champions League, Atletico were the favourites against a Marseille side whose continental campaign had begun in the the third qualifying round last July. Just being in this final, their 19th European game of the season, was an achievement for Garcia's team. But they will look back on the evening with regrets. After all, they had started well and had a great chance to open the scoring inside four minutes, Valere Germain shooting over from an excellent position after being slipped in by Payet. It was the kind of chance that does not come up often against an Atletico side who had kept 33 clean sheets in all competitions this season before this game. Having been on top, Marseille were then punished for sloppy defending as they fell behind in the 21st minute. Goalkeeper Steve Mandanda opted to play a pass to Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa, deep in midfield, rather than clear long. The Cameroonian's attempt at a touch was awful, and Gabi pounced on the loose ball, sending Griezmann through to finish. That subdued the massed ranks of Marseille fans, and things got worse for them when Payet, their captain and most influential player who had been struggling with a hamstring problem ahead of the game, came off crying just after the half-hour mark. OM needed to take the game to Atletico in the second half, but instead they conceded again just four minutes after the restart. It was a glorious goal, Griezmann finding Koke and then latching onto the return ball as he stormed into the box before lifting a deft finish over Mandanda and in. Substitute Kostas Mitroglou nearly set up a grandstand finale, his header coming off Jan Oblak's post, before Gabi's low drive in the 89th minute made it 3-0."
95,17/05/2018,00:34,"'Just the beginning' for Marseille, says owner McCourt",Marseille's American owner Frank McCourt pledged there was more to come from the French giants following Wednesday's 3-0 Europa League final defeat by Atletico Madrid in Lyon.,"Marseille had been desperate to win the second European trophy in their history, on French soil, 25 years after beating AC Milan in the inaugural Champions League final. But two goals from Antoine Griezmann and a late third from Atletico captain Gabi handed the Spanish club a deserved third Europa League title in nine seasons. ""Like all the fans, I am obviously disappointed with our loss tonight. But above all, I'd like to remind everyone of our team's incredible journey during the tournament,"" said former Los Angeles Dodgers owner McCourt, who purchased Marseille in October 2016. ""Our team has shown tremendous commitment this whole time. It's the OM I love to see and want to see at every game. The season we've had, and it's not over yet, has been amazing."" Marseille finished a dreadful 13th in 2015/16 -- the club's lowest position in 15 years -- but rebounded to end the campaign fifth last year and go into the final weekend of this season chasing a Champions League berth. Rudi Garcia's team are fourth, a point behind Lyon in third place which now guarantees a spot in the Champions League group stage as a result of Atletico's Europa League triumph. ""This exceptional step shows us that OM can do great things. This is just the beginning. We have great ambitions. Our aim is to build over the long term and to make OM a team capable of competing for titles every year in France and in Europe,"" McCourt said."
96,16/05/2018,03:00,"Griezmann, Atletico target European glory against Marseille",Antoine Griezmann is hoping to get his hands on a first major trophy with Atletico Madrid as the Spanish club prepare to take on Marseille in Wednesday's Europa League final.,"Griezmann has only won the Spanish Super Cup since joining Diego Simeone's side four years ago, featuring in the team that lost on penalties to Real Madrid in the Champions League final in 2016. Atletico's build-up to this match has been overshadowed to some extent by constant speculation about his future, with the France striker being tipped to join Barcelona after the World Cup. But his Atletico team-mates are confident the 27-year-old is fully focused on leading his side to what would be their third Europa League title since the start of the decade. He will spearhead the attack alongside Diego Costa. ""We have been speaking about him all year. Physically he is in good shape and for him it is important to win a title because he needs it, and that is the only thing that matters to him,"" said veteran midfielder Gabi. ""I hope it is not his last final because we need him and he knows that we want him to stay."" This game is a sort of homecoming for Griezmann, who has spent his whole club career in Spain but grew up in Macon, less than an hour's drive from Lyon. The memories of their agonising defeats to Real in the Champions League finals of 2014 and 2016 remain fresh for Simeone and his side. However, Simeone has worked wonders with Atletico since being appointed in late 2011 and sealing Europa League victory six months later. The Spanish side have greater collective experience of European finals, but Simeone was not keen to draw too many comparisons with what has come before. ""It is never good to make comparisons. The Champions League is one thing and the Europa League another,"" said Simeone, who will serve a touchline ban on Wednesday after being sent to the stands against Arsenal in the semi-finals. ""Experience is an important factor although it won't completely influence the game,"" he added. Having dropped into this competition following a surprise group-stage exit from the Champions League, Atletico are favourites, but Marseille are motivated by the prospect of playing on home soil. They are also driven by the desire to win a second European trophy, just as the club marks 25 years since beating AC Milan in the 1993 Champions League final. ""I think the expectation in Marseille and across the country is quite extraordinary and our motivation comes from that,"" said Dimitri Payet, who is confident of beng fully fit after a minor muscle injury. Marseille, who have lost three other European finals, have come all the way from the qualifying rounds in this season's Europa League, starting out last July. ""We know that Atletico have the experience. They came out of the Champions League while we came through the Europa League qualifiers,"" said coach Rudi Garcia. ""But we have experienced players too, players who have played in and won European finals, the Champions League in the case of Luiz Gustavo. We want to enjoy the moment, let our hair down."" Garcia is confident of having a full squad at his disposal, despite concerns over the fitness of centre-back Rolando, Bouna Sarr and striker Kostas Mitroglou. Meanwhile, authorities in Lyon are hoping the match, which will kick off at 8:45pm (1845 GMT), will not be marred by violence. Only around 11,500 Marseille fans will officially be in attendance in a crowd of close to 60,000 and those without tickets have been urged not to travel amid fears of trouble between them and fans of Lyon. A big rivalry has developed in recent years between the clubs, and there will be 1,250 police officers deployed in the city and around the stadium."
97,15/05/2018,20:19,Marseille spurred on by memories of European glory,Marseille star Dimitri Payet is determined to go down in history by beating Atletico Madrid in Wednesday's Europa League final as the club celebrates a quarter of a century since their greatest moment.,"They became the first, and to date only, French club to win the Champions League by beating AC Milan in the 1993 final, and now they are hoping to become the first team from the country to lift the Europa League trophy. ""We are lucky to have the chance to continue the love affair that this club has with European competitions,"" Payet told reporters in Lyon, where Wednesday's final will be played. Marseille are hoping the fact the game is being played on French soil will work in their favour, even if Diego Simeone's Atletico are formidable opponents. ""We can go down in history and leave an even bigger mark on this club,"" Payet added, as excitement builds around France. Marseille's glory days may be in the past, while their great rivals Paris Saint-Germain have become the country's dominant force. But OM remain France's best supported side. ""I think the expectation in Marseille and across the country is quite extraordinary and our motivation comes from that,"" said Payet, who is set to play as he recovers from a minor muscle injury that kept him out of his team's 3-3 Ligue 1 draw at Guingamp last Friday. Coach Rudi Garcia surpassed expectations just by leading Marseille into European competition this season, yet now they have reached the final after a run that started in the third qualifying round last July. Garcia said: ""This year we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the only time a French team has won the Champions League. So we have a great example to go on and become the first ones to win the Europa League."" It is Marseille's fifth European final overall -- they lost the 1991 European Cup final on penalties to Red Star Belgrade, before disappointing defeats in the UEFA Cup final to Parma in 1999 and Rafael Benitez's Valencia in 2004. The only other European trophy won by a French club remains PSG's victory in the now defunct Cup Winners' Cup in 1996. ""We are lucky to be at Marseille, a club with a love affair with European competitions that goes back to the 1990s, and we are all eager to follow in the footsteps of our illustrious predecessors,"" Garcia said. ""We know that Atletico stand in our way and that it will be a very difficult mission, but that would make it an even greater achievement if we managed to win the trophy."""
98,15/05/2018,19:03,Simeone warns of Payet threat in Europa League final,Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone is wary of the threat posed by Marseille's Dimitri Payet but believes his team's extra experience will count for something in Wednesday's Europa League final.,"""Experience is an important factor although it won't completely influence the game,"" said Simeone at a press conference on Tuesday ahead of the match in the French city of Lyon. A strong Atletico side, with a formidable defence and an attack spearheaded by Antoine Griezmann, are the favourites, having won the Europa League twice in the last decade and also narrowly lost two Champions League finals to Real Madrid, in 2014 and 2016. But Rudi Garcia's Marseille have caught Simeone's eye on their run to a first continental final in 14 years. ""They will have self-confidence, and we will need to impose our rhythm as the game goes on. We are similar teams and it will be quite a tense game,"" he said. Atletico's defence is arguably the best in Europe -- they have let in just 20 goals in La Liga this season -- and Simeone's side will need to stifle Payet to prevent Marseille from winning a second European trophy to follow their Champions League triumph of 1993. ""They are a dangerous side going forward and Payet will dictate the rhythm. Their coach has done a great job."" Simeone's sending-off in the first leg of the 2-1 semi-final triumph over Arsenal means he will be suspended for Wednesday's game. But while the Argentine will be forced to watch on from the stands, his fiery assistant, German ""Mono"" Burgos, will take charge of the team. ""It was same thing against Arsenal, when German was in charge of the side. ""I feel sad at not being there, but we have known each other for a lifetime and we understand football in the same way. I have confidence in him being in charge."""
99,14/05/2018,22:51,Marseille can win the Europa League says homeboy Zidane,Marseille native Zinedine Zidane says his hometown club can win the Europa League Wednesday when they meet Atletico Madrid in the final.,"For many years a huge mural portrait of Zidane at Marseille's Corniche paid tribute to Zidane's brace of goals in the 1998 World Cup final, although he never actually played for Marseille. ""OM have the ability to win it,"" Zidane said in Corsica on Monday where he had turned up for a charity match organised by former Marseille goalkeeper Pascal Olmeta. ""It's a huge achievement just to have got to the final, they've done really well,"" said Zidane, the coach of Real Madrid. ""It comes down to details in a final. It's two huge clubs, two institutions, but Marseille has the means to do it. ""I have no advice to give them, but I believe they have every chance."""
100,10/05/2018,20:06,Champions League future trumps Europa frenzy for Marseille at Guingamp,"Europa League final fever may be gripping Marseille, but for their future Champions League hopes the French giants face an equally crucial clash against Guingamp on Friday.","Much to Marseille's joy, the fixture was brought forward a day to allow Rudi Garcia's men ample time to recover and prepare for their Europa League final against Atletico Madrid on May 16. But Friday's trip to Brittany could be just as important as next week's final date in Lyon: Marseille are battling both Monaco and Lyon to finish runners-up to Paris Saint-Germain and claim Ligue 1's second automatic spot for the Champions League. With two matches remaining, Marseille, in fourth, trail Monaco by one point and Lyon by two points. Failure to beat Guingamp in the sides' penultimate league match of the season would deliver a huge blow to Marseille's hopes of qualifying for Europe's premier club competition next season, and perhaps sow unawanted seeds of doubt ahead of a final clash with Atletico that the whole of France, according to Marseille president Jacques-Henri Eyraud, wants the southerners to win. ""We are all really grateful that French football is giving Marseille so much support in this Europa League campaign,"" Eyraud said after receiving confirmation of the rescheduled fixture in midweek. ""We feel we're riding a really positive wave that, I hope, will carry us to victory."" Garcia has calmed expectations, labelling Marseille as ""underdogs"" for what will be the club's fifth European final. So far, they have won just one of their five previous finals -- the 1993 Champions League. The former Roma coach will expect a humble, though determined approach from his players on Friday. Although Marseille have beaten Guingamp in their two previous meetings, both in the league, the Brittany side -- currently 11th in the table -- triumphed the last time they met in Brittany, a 2-1 win in August 2016."
101,02/05/2018,13:26,Marseille within touch of European glory days,Marseille face Salzburg on Thursday within touching distance of their first European final in almost a decade and a half.,"Goals from Florian Thauvin and Clinton Njie in last week's Europa League semi-final first leg kept alive the French club's quest for a first continental title since their triumph in the inaugural Champions League final in 1993. They subsequently reached the UEFA Cup final in 2004, losing to Rafael Benitez's Valencia in Gothenburg. Success in Salzburg (kick-off 1905 GMT) would leave the American-owned Ligue 1 side facing serious opposition in the shape of Atletico Madrid or Arsenal. They face off in Thursday's other semi-final tied at 1-1 after last week's first leg at the Emirates in London. In Marseille's favour should they prevail in Austria is the fact that the May 16 final is being staged in Lyon, just a couple of hundred kilometres inland from their Mediterranean headquarters. When American billionaire Frank McCourt bought the slumbering French giants in October 2016 after their worst finish -- 13th -- in Ligue 1 in 15 years he promised to restore the glory days of the once-dominant club. With Rudi Garcia's arrival as coach on a three-year contract and investment in new players Marseille finished fifth last season, and are now fourth, one point behind third-placed Monaco with three games of the season remaining. But before their fans start booking accommodation for the final their team must see off a Salzburg side that have not lost at home all season and who beat Marseille 1-0 in the Europa League group phase. Garcia for one was not taking anything for granted, declaring after last week's win: ""We have to remain humble, nothing's done yet. ""If we can take everyone to the final in France that would be brilliant but we are not there yet."" Garcia has good reason to inject a note of caution, judging by Salzburg's escape act against Lazio in the quarter-finals. Trailing 4-2 after the first leg in Rome and seemingly done and dusted the Austrian champions coached by Marco Rose wiped the floor with Lazio 4-1 in the second leg to progress 6-5 on aggregate. ""Against Lazio a lot of people thought we were dead and buried but we knew how to turn things around,"" commented Salzburg's Swedish-born Kosovo midfielder Valon Berisha. Marseille though will be bitterly disappointed if they don't hit the right notes in Mozart's home city. They breezed into the last four with a 5-2 aggregate rout of RB Leipzig, confirming they are on an upward trajectory under former Lille and Roma coach Garcia. On the pitch last week's scorer Thauvin is in enjoying the form of his life, playmaker Dimitri Payet is at his best again setting up both goals last week while Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo is proving an inspired signing. In attack Garcia is counting on Valere Germain to regain his form having scored only one goal in the past two months. The Marseille-born striker, who is due to start in place of injured Kostas Mitroglou, told AFP he'd often experienced these fallow spells but that hasn't diminished his confidence ""because I've also had fantastic months, like last August, or between December and February when I was scoring all the time"". He can take heart from the example set by his compatriot Karim Benzema, who fired Real Madrid into the Champions League final on Tuesday with a double after a miserable run when he scored only once in 12 matches."
102,29/04/2018,23:15,"Draw dents Marseille Euro bid, Cavani sets PSG record with rescue act",A late leveller from Ismael Traore put the brakes on Marseille's bid for Champions League football next season as the southern giants were held to a 1-1 draw at Angers on Sunday.,"Marseille travelled west hoping to move into the Ligue 1 top three after Monaco were held to a scoreless draw at home to Amiens on Saturday as Lyon took second by beating Nantes. Paris Saint-Germain, who battled back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Guingamp on Sunday, wrapped up the title with plenty of room to spare two weeks ago. On paper, three points were well within Marseille's grasp. Coach Rudi Garcia certainly appeared to believe so as he left both Dimitri Payet and Kostas Mitroglou on the bench ahead of Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at Salzburg. But despite a third-minute penalty from Florian Thauvin, misfiring Angers finally got back on level terms thanks to Traore's header from a free-kick on 79 minutes. Marseille remain fourth, one point behind Monaco in the third and last Champions League qualifying position. But Garcia remained confident that Marseille will reach their objectives both at home and in Europe. ""We've dropped two points, which is a regret because we're approaching the end of the season,"" he said. ""But we still have three matches to play, and Monaco also dropped points. It's not over yet."" He added: ""Now, we'll turn our focus to the Europa League and do everything we can to make the final. Then we host Nice (in Ligue 1) and we'll start our bid to move up one or two places in the table. ""Everything is possible."" After Monaco's slip-up, motivation should not have been an issue for Marseille at the Raymond Kopa stadium. But Garcia's men struggled to build on the early lead provided by Thauvin after Abdoulaye Bamba had fouled Valere Germain during the first corner of the game. In wet and slippery conditions both keepers were kept on their toes. Marseille shot-stopper Yohann Pele produced a great one-handed save to thwart Flavien Tait from a tight angle minutes before the interval. But Ludovic Butelle was the busiest of the pair, the 35-year-old forced into action quickly after the restart to charge down Jordan Amavi's angled strike before palming a wicked curling effort from Thauvin over the bar moments later. The greasy pitch made for a scrappy affair with passes, and shots, going astray. But not even those challenges were an excuse for Angers missing a golden chance to level on 70 minutes. Karl Toko Ekambi's run through the middle into the area saw the ball stop dead, with Pele stranded. Yet, faced with an empty goal, Thomas Mangani sent his effort high over the bar from 16 yards out. But the home fans were finally given reason to celebrate when Traore rose highest at the back post to meet Tait's free-kick from deep on the left and fire a header past a rooted Pele and into the bottom corner. Champions PSG needed two goals from Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani to rescue a point at home to mid-table Guingamp. Ludovic Blas and Jimmy Briand had put Guingamp on course for a shock win at the Parc des Princes before Cavani became his club's all-time Ligue 1 top scorer with a 75th-minute penalty and leveller seven minutes from time. The brace took Cavani's career total to 115 goals in the French top flight. Rennes boosted their hopes of fighting for a Europa League place with a precious 2-1 win over Toulouse that pushed the Brittany side up one place to sixth. They are now just one point behind fifth-placed Saint-Etienne."
103,26/04/2018,23:09,Marseille take control in Europa League semi against Salzburg,"Florian Thauvin and substitute Clinton Njie netted to give Marseille a 2-0 win over Salzburg in their Europa League semi-final first leg on Thursday, keeping the French club's dreams of European glory alive.","Dimitri Payet set up both goals for OM at a packed Velodrome, as more than 62,000 fans saw Thauvin grab an opener that had more than a suspicion of handball about it. Cameroon international Njie then made it 2-0 less than three minutes after coming off the bench in the second half, to leave Marseille firmly in control of the tie ahead of next week's return in Austria. Marseille are desperate to reach a Europa League final that will be played in France, at the home of their bitter rivals Lyon, on May 16. They are aiming to win a second European trophy, a quarter of a century after their triumph in the inaugural Champions League final in 1993. Rudi Garcia's side would perhaps not be the favourites if they did make it through to face either Arsenal or Atletico Madrid, who drew 1-1 in London in Thursday's other game. However, they have enough quality in their ranks to trouble anyone, even if Salzburg might feel aggrieved at not at least grabbing an away goal. The opener arrived with just 15 minutes played, as Salzburg goalkeeper Alexander Walke came for a Payet free-kick but couldn't get to it, and Thauvin arrived to finish at the back post with a combination of his head and an arm. Scottish referee Willie Collum did not see anything wrong with the goal, and he also waved away Salzburg penalty appeals early in the second half when Stefan Lainer went down as he crashed into Maxime Lopez in the box. Moments after that, Marseille goalkeeper Yohann Pele produced an excellent save to deny Hannes Wolf, and the home side doubled their lead in the 63rd minute. Substitute Njie released Payet down the left and then controlled the return ball in the box before firing home, sparking jubilant scenes in the vast home crowd. Norwegian substitute Fredrik Gulbrandsen hit the post with a half-volley at the other end late on, and Salzburg may live to regret not scoring that precious away goal as they look to become the first Austrian side to reach a European final in over 20 years."
104,25/04/2018,18:28,Marseille host Salzburg eyeing return to European glory days,"A quarter of a century on from giving French football its crowning moment in Europe, Marseille are dreaming of continental glory once again.","But the club that won the inaugural Champions League in 1993 -- still the only time the European Cup has been won by a French side -- must first come through a Europa League semi-final against Austria's Red Bull Salzburg, with the first leg at the Velodrome on Thursday. If Marseille can win before a sell-out crowd of more than 60,000 on Thursday night (kick-off 1905 GMT), it will set them up to finish the job in next week's return and keep them on course to make a final that will be played in France, at the home of their bitter rivals Lyon. Given that Atletico Madrid and Arsenal meet in the other semi-final, Marseille cannot be seen as favourites to lift the trophy. Nevertheless, the rousing 5-2 win over RB Leipzig in the second leg of the quarter-final at the Velodrome confirmed that they are a club on the up again under Rudi Garcia. The former Lille and Roma coach has spearheaded Marseille's revival on the field since American tycoon Frank McCourt's takeover of the club in late 2016. McCourt immediately launched his 'Champions Project', aimed at getting the club back into Europe's top club competition again as soon as possible. They are currently locked in a fierce battle with Lyon and Monaco for two Champions League qualifying berths in Ligue 1 behind champions Paris Saint-Germain. But with Florian Thauvin in the form of his life, Dimitri Payet at his best again and Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo proving an inspired signing, they could yet win the Europa League and, in the process, qualify for the Champions League anyway. Asked at Wednesday's pre-game press conference how he has approached the match with his players, Garcia said: ""I am telling them to continue scoring goals but to stop conceding so many. We need to be more rigorous at certain periods in games. ""Tomorrow, we are at home, at the Velodrome, in front of a full stadium. The atmosphere will be the same as against Leipzig, but we must not forget there will be a second leg to come there."" Given PSG's well documented difficulties in the Champions League, Marseille's run has given French football a boost, a year after Lyon lost in the last four of the same competition. This is OM's first European semi-final since 2004, when Didier Drogba's goals saw off Newcastle United in the UEFA Cup before they lost to Rafael Benitez's Valencia in the final in Gothenburg, Sweden. Marseille can be confident, even if Garcia has labelled his team simply ""an outsider determined to reach the final"". However, they will be without influential Japan right-back Hiroki Sakai due to a knee injury, and Salzburg's run in Europe so far this season means they deserve respect. On course to win a fifth consecutive Austrian title, Marco Rose's Salzburg have already drawn with and beaten the French giants in the group stage. This will be their 19th game in Europe this season, a run that started in the Champions League qualifying rounds and continued on to wins against Borussia Dortmund and Lazio in the last two rounds of the Europa League. ""We have come this far, so of course we want to take the next step to the final,"" Israeli striker Munas Dabbur, who scored in the win over Lazio, told the club's website. ""We face really strong opponents though, who have become even more dangerous in recent weeks."" Coached by the Leipzig-born Rose, Salzburg are the first Austrian semi-finalists in a major UEFA club competition since Rapid Vienna lost to PSG in the 1996 Cup Winners' Cup final. That was the last time any French club won a European trophy."
105,13/04/2018,12:40,Arsenal face Atletico Madrid in Europa League semi-final,"Arsenal were handed a mouth-watering clash against tournament favourites Atletico Madrid in Friday's draw for the semi-finals of the Europa League, meaning the clubs will meet for the first time.","French giants Marseille will play Salzburg, a club backed by soft drinks giant Red Bull, in the other semi-final. Arsene Wenger's Arsenal will play the first leg at home at the Emirates Stadium against Atletico, led by French striker Antoine Griezmann, who are looking to win the competition for the third time in a decade. Wenger, whose side play Manchester United away in the Premier League between the two legs of the semi-final, had identified Atletico, Champions League finalists in 2014 and 2016, as the most dangerous side in the draw. ""Everybody speaks about Atletico Madrid that they look the strongest team on paper,"" he said. It will be Arsenal's first European semi-final since 2009. The first legs will take place on April 26 with the return games on May 3. ""They are a similar kind of club to us,"" Atletico director Clemente Villaverde said at the draw at UEFA's headquarters in Nyon. ""Arsenal are a great team, they're up there every year fighting for trophies and getting deep into their European competitions,"" he said. Arsenal reached the last four after surviving a scare against CSKA Moscow in Thursday's quarter-final second leg in the Russian capital. Danny Welbeck and Aaron Ramsey both scored late in the game for Arsenal to calm nerves after CSKA had raced into a 2-0 lead on the night. A 2-2 draw saw the London side through 6-3 on aggregate. Atletico lost 1-0 to Sporting in Lisbon on Thursday but advanced 2-1 on aggregate. Diego Costa, who returned to the club from Chelsea earlier this season, could be a doubt for the first leg after Atletico confirmed he had suffered a hamstring injury in the game in Portugal. He was substituted early in the second half. British bookmakers William Hill make Atletico hot favourites to win the competition, but explained why Arsenal fans still have reason for optimism. ""It could be argued that Arsenal need this more than Atletico as a route into the Champions League next season,"" said William Hill spokesman Joe Crilly. ""Their Europa League form has been in stark contrast to their Premier League form during the second half of this season and they have every chance of progressing,"" Crilly said. Sitting sixth in the Premier League, only winning the final in Lyon on May 16 will take the Gunners into the Champions League next season. Marseille would love to make it to a final being played on French soil after making it through to a first European semi since 2004. They produced a stirring comeback to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit and beat German side RB Leipzig 5-3 on aggregate in their quarter-final. Marseille will be at home in the first leg against 1994 finalists Salzburg, who produced the shock result of Thursday night by defeating Italian side Lazio 4-1 at home to win 6-5 on aggregate. Salzburg have already beaten Marseille once in the competition this season, a 1-0 victory in Austria. The teams also drew 0-0 at the Velodrome in the group stage. ""But this time it's the semi-final so it'll be different,"" Marseille director Andoni Zubizarreta told beIN Sports. The former Spain goalkeeper refused to accept it was an easy draw however. ""The four clubs have worked a lot to reach the semi-finals and yesterday Salzburg were very strong against Lazio,"" Zubizarreta insisted in reference to the four goals Salzburg hit past the Romans on Thursday."

South Korea international Kwon Chang-Hoon curled in an equaliser for Dijon with a quarter of an hour remaining. But Germain was again involved as Marseille regained the lead on 88 minutes, his near-post header from a corner was bundled in from point-blank range by Argentine Lucas Ocampos. A frenetic finale saw Dijon reduced to 10 men when Cedric Yambere was harshly sent off after conceding a penalty for a foul on Ocampos, although the spot-kick from Payet was saved by Baptiste Reynet. But Payet, overlooked by Didier Deschamps for his latest France squad, atoned deep into stoppage time after winning another penalty, this time converting as Marseille pulled five points clear of fourth-placed Lyon. Marseille go to Germany next week for the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final against RB Leipzig, with top scorer Florian Thauvin once more unlikely to feature as he nurses a hamstring injury. Lyon, who beat Marseille 3-2 ahead of the international break, can reduce the gap on Sunday when they host a relegation-threatened Toulouse side."

UEFA said this is punishment for fans throwing fireworks onto the pitch during the second leg of their last-16 tie with Real. They were also sanctioned for fans using a laser pointer and were fined a total of 43,000 euros ($53,000). Marseille were slapped with a ban on their fans travelling to their next two away matches in Europe after supporters were involved in violence in the Europa League game at Athletic Bilbao.

108,19/03/2018,15:58,Depay grabs Lyon dramatic win over top-three rivals Marseille,Memphis Depay's last-gasp winner clinched Lyon a thrilling 3-2 victory at Marseille on Sunday that kept them firmly in the hunt for Champions League qualification.,"Kostas Mitroglou looked to have snatched Marseille a vital point with an 84th-minute equaliser to make it 2-2, but Depay showed great bravery to nod home in the final minute of normal time. Bruno Genesio's Lyon are now just two points adrift of their opponents in the race for the third and final Champions League spot, after following a six-game winless run with back-to-back victories. Marseille had forged ahead in the 31st minute through Portuguese defender Rolando, but Lyon levelled as Adil Rami put through his own net before Houssem Aouar scored early in the second period. Both sides clashed after the final whistle, with fights also breaking out in the tunnel as Marseille frustrations boiled over. ""Over the whole game, it was deserved, we had more chances and we controlled the game,"" said Lyon coach Genesio. ""We're back to two points and it's very possible to catch them, but we need to repeat the performances we put in against the big teams against the so-called weaker teams."" Both teams looked dangerous going forward early on, with Lyon forward Mariano Diaz seeing an effort spin narrowly wide of the far post, before visiting goalkeeper denied Dimitri Payet with a sprawling save. Marseille dominated possession, but Lyon always looked a threat on the counter-attack and Steve Mandanda had to get down quickly to push away Bertrand Traore's low drive. It was Rudi Garcia's hosts who struck the first blow, though, as Rami nodded a Payet free-kick back across the area for his centre-back partner Rolando to turn the ball in through the legs of Lopes. Mandanda made a magnificent save to tip Maxwel Cornet's curling effort onto the post, but Lyon equalised in fortuitous circumstances shortly afterwards. Traore completely miskicked with the goal gaping, but the ball ricocheted off Rami and looped past a stranded Mandanda. It took Lyon less than seven minutes of the second period to take a deserved lead, as Traore picked out Aouar on the edge of the area and the 19-year-old midfielder curled low into the corner to score his fourth league goal of the season. A draw would have been an excellent result for Marseille with a five-point lead to defend, but Lyon continued to outplay their hosts and Mandanda had to show all of his agility to get a vital hand on Traore's backheeled effort. Marseille managed to get a grip on proceedings and some terrible defending from the away side gifted Mitroglou the equaliser as Jeremy Morel's sliced clearance dropped for the Greek striker to head home. But former Manchester United winger Depay, who came on as a second-half substitute, leapt highest to direct Diaz's flick-on header into the far corner and spark wild Lyon celebrations. Earlier on Sunday, Dani Alves snatched champions elect Paris Saint-Germain a 2-1 victory at Nice in an early kick-off aimed specifically at the Asian television market. The Brazilian full-back stepped up in the absence of his injured compatriot Neymar with a late header after Angel Di Maria had cancelled out Allan Saint-Maximin's early opener for Nice. ""After the defeat against Real Madrid (in the Champions League), we have reacted very well. I'm pleased to see how the team has responded after that loss,"" PSG coach Unai Emery said. ""We were lacking that little something to forget the defeat. Perhaps a tiny element of it will never leave. But we've won against Metz, Angers, and now here and I like that."" PSG remain in total control of the title race, with reigning champions Monaco 17 points adrift in second place, with Marseille now seven points further behind. Claudio Ranieri's Nantes missed the chance to retake fifth spot from Rennes as they were held to a 1-1 draw at rock-bottom Metz, while Saint-Etienne moved into the top half of the table with a 2-0 win over Guingamp."

""Today he was ill,"" Emery said. ""I hope Neymar will be well enough to train tomorrow and will be ready for Sunday, but we will wait."" The Brazilian was sent off when the clubs drew 2-2 in Marseille in October. Neymar scored last Saturday as PSG bounced back from their 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie by thrashing Strasbourg 5-2.

Atletico Madrid and French striker Antoine Griezmann were paired with Lokomotiv Moscow, the day after another Spanish-Russian game, between Athletic Bilbao and Spartak Moscow, was marred by violence in which a Spanish policeman died of a heart attack. Bilbao will face 1993 European champions Marseille for the matches on March 8 and 15. Another French side, Lyon, must overcome CSKA Moscow to keep alive their hopes of appearing in the final which will be played at their own stadium on May 16. Lyon were comfortable 4-1 aggregate winners over Villarreal in the round of 32 and former club stalwart Bernard Lacombe welcomed the draw which sees the second leg played in France. ""We qualified well against Villarreal, who are a good club. Obviously it would be fantastic to play in our own stadium (in the final) but there are high-level opponents left in the competition and we have to respect that,"" he told beIN Sports.

113,23/02/2018,02:10,PSG focused on Real Madrid despite Marseille double-header,Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery says his side will be using two upcoming matches against arch-rivals Marseille at the Parc des Princes as preparation for the Champions League clash with Real Madrid.,"PSG's games with Marseille are usually the biggest fixtures on the French footballing calendar, but Spaniard Emery insists that Sunday's Ligue 1 match and next week's French Cup quarter-final come second to trying to keep alive their European dream. The big-spending capital club were beaten 3-1 in the first leg of their last-16 tie last week as Cristiano Ronaldo scored a double for reigning champions Real. ""These are two 'clasicos' (against Marseille)...which will serve to prepare us for Real,"" Emery wrote this week on his personal website. PSG, who were held to a 2-2 draw at Marseille earlier this season, are 12 points clear at the top of the French table and set to reclaim the title they lost to Monaco last season. It would be a fifth league crown in six seasons for the Parisians but, for all the money poured into the club by their Qatari owners, PSG have not been able to translate domestic domination into European success, with the 6-1 humiliation at Barcelona a year ago the low point. Emery attracted a lot of the blame for that performance and for the loss to Zinedine Zidane's Real at the Santiago Bernabeu, where he removed striker Edinson Cavani with the score still level. But the former Sevilla coach argues that PSG are much better at home, where they had beaten Barca 4-0 in the first leg last season. ""It is above all at the Parc that we remain a powerful force,"" he added. ""Marseille and Real Madrid know they have to come to Paris, but they don't really know what is facing them. Together we will do it."" Cavani scored twice in a 5-2 romp against Strasbourg last weekend, the second set up by world-record signing Neymar. But Cavani's on-field gestures make it clear he thinks the Brazilian should pass to him more often and their strained relationship is under the microscope. For Marseille, there might never be a better time to go to the Parc des Princes as they look to end a 15-match winless streak against PSG dating back to November 2011. They have not finished in the top three since 2013 but are regaining some consistency and punch under Rudi Garcia and enter the weekend one point behind Monaco in the race to finish second. The warm-up to the main event is the latest round in another of France's bitterest rivalries as Saint-Etienne travel the 70 kilometres to Lyon. Whatever happens on the field, expect fireworks. Lyon's thumping 5-0 victory in the return fixture in November saw captain Nabil Fekir provoke anger from the Saint-Etienne fans by holding up his shirt in front of them, culminating in a yellow card and a one-match suspension. Both sets of fans have been persistently guilty of setting off flares at games and the resentment between the clubs runs deep. Bruno Genesio's Lyon have gone four league matches without a win to slip six points adrift of Marseille in the race for a Champions League spot.

""It's ruined, this tifo,"" Michel Tonini, leader of the fan group that commissioned the banner, told AFP. ""It's ridiculous. At the end of the day it's created the opposite effect when we just wanted to liven up the stadium."" He added: ""We prepared it ourselves, there's nothing to do with Netflix in it. They're just happy to have a tifo the day of their promotion."" But other fan groups were strongly opposed to the collaboration, with the head of another supporters' club notably unhappy with the way Marseille is portrayed in the series. ""I don't like it at all, it's already a crap series that sinks Marseille more than it shows it off,"" said Christian Cataldo. ""Bandits, drugs, they are in other places than just Marseille. I don't want to be associated with this series."" Faced with the controversy, Netflix decided to pull all advertisements inside the ground promoting the show featuring French actor Gerard Depardieu. The 69-year-old, who plays the city's mayor in the series, had been expected to take part in a ceremonial kick-off before the match, but those plans were also shelved due to fears over a negative crowd reaction."
115,08/02/2018,22:29,Blazing Marseille attack draws attention from Paris stars,"Marseille open the Ligue 1 weekend by taking one of the hottest attacks in Europe to the fortress of one of their ancient rivals, Saint-Etienne.","Marseille's motto is ""Straight to goal"" and they are living up to it in 2018 with 27 goals scored in all competitions since the start of the year as they have risen to second in the table. In the big five European leagues, only Paris Saint-Germain, whose superstars are running away with Ligue 1, have hit more. Marseille's total includes 15 league goals since January 1, two fewer than PSG and the same as Barcelona, Real Madrid and Lazio. In their last league game, Marseille scored five times in the first 56 minutes before easing up as they won 6-3 at home to Metz. On Tuesday, they travelled to second division Bourg-en-Bresse, rested several starters and won 9-0 in the French Cup. ""It's a hallmark of my teams that they have lots of different scorers,"" said Rudi Garcia, who built a similarly explosive attack when he guided Lille to the league title in 2011. Marseille have four scorers in double figures, led by Florian Thauvin with 14 and followed by Valere Germain on 13 and Morgan Sanson and Lucas Ocampos both on 10. The recent surge has been fuelled by the improving form of two veterans, Dimitri Payet and Kostas Mitroglou and the transformation of youngster, Clinton Njie, into Garcia's trump card off the bench. Thauvin, who has two international caps, is growing into a star in his second stint in Marseille. He hit a hat-trick against Metz and is both scoring and creating as he strives to force his way into the France squad for the World Cup. Mitroglou, the veteran Greek striker who has struggled since his signing last year, hit a hat-trick on Tuesday to follow a goal off the bench in Metz. ""He's starting to pay off his fee,"" Garcia said. Payet suggested his form is improving when he scored direct from a free kick for the first time in almost a year against Bourg. Saint-Etienne, reinforced by winter recruits Mathieu Debuchy, Paul-Georges Ntep, Neven Subotic and Yann M'Vila, have won two in a row. Yet while the Marseille attack is on fire, the worry is that the fans of the two clubs might set the stadium ablaze. The use of flares and smoke bombs by fans has more than doubled this season. The French authorities estimate that there have been 1,502 incidents so far, up from 679 at the same stage last season, French sports daily L'Equipe reported. Marseille fans lead this league with a score of 384 and were punished with partial closure of the Velodrome for the Metz game. Saint-Etienne are second in the smoke table. On Saturday, leaders PSG play in Toulouse in a last run out before the Valentine's Day Champions League encounter with Real Madrid. PSG will be without Kylian Mbappe after French football's disciplinary commission announced on Thursday that the young French striker would be banned for a second match for a foul on Ismaila Sarr of Rennes during the League Cup semi-final on January 30. Mbappe suffered a knock in January and has struggled for form. The enforced absence allows him to rest but also offers Angel Di Maria, who has been in sparkling form, the chance to cement a place in the lineup. e between Kylian Mbappe and Angel Di Maria has also been the subject of much scrutiny this week. Mbappe suffered a knock in January and has struggled for form just as the older Argentine has regained his sparkle."

Edinson Cavani restored the lead for Unai Emery's team on 27 minutes when he turned in a Layvin Kurzawa cross at the far post, and Thiago Silva then rattled the crossbar with a header from a corner. Di Maria added a third just prior to the hour with a composed finish after he was released in behind the home defence by a pass from Italian midfielder Marco Verratti. He completed his hat-trick just three minutes later by forcing home a rebound from close range after Sochaux goalkeeper Lawrence Ati Zigi parried a fierce shot from Cavani. Dani Alves finished the game in goal for PSG after Kevin Trapp was sent off in the closing stages for a foul outside his area on Sochaux striker Thomas Robinet. Earlier, both Kostas Mitroglou and Lucas Ocampos scored hat-tricks as in-form Marseille crushed a hapless Bourg-en-Bresse in a heavily lopsided last 16 tie. Rudi Garcia's side, who are second in Ligue 1 after thrashing Metz 6-3 last week, romped into a 4-0 lead inside 20 minutes at the struggling Ligue 2 side and showed no mercy against hapless opponents. ""We had an actual nightmare, the two sides were a world apart,"" admitted Bourg-en-Bresse coach Herve Della Maggiore. ""We watched them play."" Despite making six changes to the starting XI, Marseille ended the tie as a contest with early goals from Luiz Gustavo, Dimitri Payet, Ocampos and Mitroglou. Greek international striker Mitroglou has struggled to nail down a place in the team since joining from Benfica last year, but he strolled through the vacant home defence to score the fifth before half-time. Argentinian Ocampos grabbed his second early in the second half, although he was made to wait to complete his treble as Marseille went a game-high 23 minutes without scoring before he headed home. Mitroglou quickly got back in on the act as some more awful defending allowed him to nod in his seventh goal for the club, before Clinton N'Jie wrapped up the scoring with number nine from the penalty spot. Marseille have now won eight and drawn one of their last nine matches in all competitions, scoring 30 goals in the process. But they fell well short of their record win -- a 19-0 French Cup victory over Stade Raphaelois in 1933."

Lyon doubled their lead before the half-hour as Bertrand Traore, making his first league start since early November, volleyed in at the near post past replacement keeper Seydou Sy. But Senegal international Balde held off a succession of defenders before rifling in a low angled drive to halve the deficit just three minutes later. Radamel Falcao then equalised on 36 minutes when he converted the rebound after seeing his penalty, awarded for a foul on Kamil Glik, saved initially by Anthony Lopes. It took the Colombian to 17 league goals for the season -- trailing only Paris Saint-Germain duo Edinson Cavani (21) and Neymar (18). But Monaco were reduced to 10 men on the stroke of half-time as Balde, booked moments earlier for kicking away the ball in frustration, was shown a second yellow card for a nasty foul on Ferland Mendy. The hosts then lost captain Falcao to a thigh injury 10 minutes into the second half, but it was his replacement Stevan Jovetic who set up Portugal international Lopes for the winning goal a minute from time. Lyon conceded possession cheaply inside their own half, and the Montenegrin striker rolled the ball into the path of Lopes who drilled into the far corner to complete a sensational turnaround and help avenge last month's 3-2 loss in the French Cup. ""It was a very tough match. We conceded two goals far too early, we lost two players to injury and had a man sent off, everything was against us,"" Lopes said. ""But we showed we are a strong team and we deserved to win on the basis of the second half. It's our best match in terms of solidarity, but not in quality. We showed that we're a real team."" The result bumped Monaco up to third, one point behind Marseille, while Lyon finished the weekend a point outside the Champions League places in fourth after dropping from second. ""It was a sin not to have won tonight,"" Lyon coach Bruno Genesio said. ""Even worse to lose after the way we started. We had a really good start but then we practically stopped playing when we were 2-0 ahead."" Earlier, Claudio Ranieri's Nantes slumped to a 3-2 defeat at Caen as Damien Da Silva scored twice for the hosts, including an 80th-minute winner, after Yacine Bammou had grabbed a brace for the Canaries. Yeni Ngbakoto's stoppage-time goal at Roazhon Park edged Guingamp to a 1-0 victory at Rennes. A superb Neymar free-kick helped PSG to a 3-0 win at troubled Lille on Saturday as the Ligue 1 leaders began a decisive month as they mean to go on. The world's most expensive player netted the second goal at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy after Yuri Berchiche had opened the scoring just prior to half-time. Giovani Lo Celso's delightful chip secured the victory late on, with PSG now 11 points clear of Marseille at the top of the table.

French side Marseille sealed their spot in Monday's draw with a 0-0 draw against Salzburg to join the Austrians in progressing from Group I. Rudi Garcia's Ligue 1 team moved into the last 32 for the second straight season. Atalanta, coming off the back of a stunning 5-1 win at Everton a fortnight ago, edged out in-form Lyon 1-0 to finish top of Group E as Andrea Petagna scored his fourth goal of the season in the 10th minute. Lyon could now be drawn to face one of the eight sides slipping down from the Champions League in the last 32, including Atletico Madrid and Napoli. Everton made it two wins from two under new manager Sam Allardyce by cruising to a 3-0 victory over Apollon Limassol in Cyprus, although the former England boss did not travel with the squad due to a medical appointment. Forward Ademola Lookman, 20, scored a double with close-season signing Nikola Vlasic adding a late third to salvage some pride for Everton as they avoided finishing bottom of the group. ""It's been good (under Sam Allardyce). Different training, different tactics. I'm enjoying it,"" Lookman told BT Sport. Former Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic's brilliant overhead kick helped Zenit St Petersburg beat Real Sociedad 3-1 to finish first ahead of the Spaniards in Group L. Gennaro Gattuso is still waiting for a first win as AC Milan coach after a 2-0 loss at Rijeka following their embarrassing draw at Serie A minnows Benevento at the weekend. But the Croatian outfit missed out on joining Milan in the last 32 as AEK Athens pipped them to second courtesy of a goalless draw at Austria Vienna. Moldovan side Sheriff Tiraspol slipped from first to third in Group F after a 2-0 defeat by FC Copenhagen, dropping below the Danes and group winners Lokomotiv Moscow, who beat bottom side FC Zlin by the same score.

""I'm very disappointed for Pat, a true friend and a real good guy. We have lost a leader,"" said Mandanda of the former France captain who also played 379 times for Manchester United. Evra had been widely condemned for the assault on a Marseille fan which took place ahead of a Europa League tie at Portuguese side Vitoria Guimaraes last week. And Mandanda acknowledged his former team-mate had made a major error. ""As a professional you need to set an example and this is not the kind of thing you can do,"" he said. ""But he's only human and the circumstances shouldn't have been like they were either."" At the match in question a group of fans had come to the pitchside to harangue the player. France coach Didier Deschamps described Evra's sanction as heavy on Friday. ""I'm neither condemning him nor judging him,"" said Deschamps, for whom Evra played at Monaco and with France. ""But it's something that you just can't do and he knows that."" Marseille president Jacques-Henri Eyraud said Friday that it was a sombre day for the 1993 European champions. ""Today, there is sadness, firstly for Patrice Evra, who obviously understood the consequences of his actions and who will no longer be able to display his passion at Marseille,"" said Eyraud. ""Then, for the supporters of Marseille, who are stigmatised because of the irresponsible behaviour of a handful of them."" In contrast to how Evra is remembered in Manchester, in France there has been a whiff of sulphur to Evra's reputation since a players' strike at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa whilst he was captain."

Luiz Gustavo put the home side ahead just before the break, sweeping home after a Florian Thauvin shot had been blocked. Thauvin then made it 2-0 just after the restart before Morgan Sanson got the third.

Lyon captain Nabil Fekir scored twice -- taking his tally for the season to 11 -- in a 5-0 demolition of bitter rivals Saint-Etienne, but he could face punishment after a provocative celebration sparked a late pitch invasion that forced a 30-minute delay. Memphis Depay rolled in Lyon's first goal on 10 minutes -- after the match was briefly interrupted by a flurry of smoke bombs inside the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard -- before Fekir made it 2-0 on 25 minutes. Leo Lacroix was sent off for Saint-Etienne just after half-time, with goals from Mariano Diaz and Bertrand Traore piling on the misery for the home side before Fekir completed the rout. But the France international triggered a furious reaction in the stands after removing his shirt and dangling it in front of the home fans, prompting the deployment of riot police to clear the pitch of a horde of supporters. ""Perhaps it's not a gesture to do, there was no need for that. I don't regret it but there you go,"" Fekir told Canal+. ""I think it's a shame, the solution was to win the match,"" Lyon coach Bruno Genesio said. ""There's no point in rubbing it in and provoking. You need to be able to remain modest.

Earlier, Mario Balotelli scored the only goal of the game as Nice beat Dijon 1-0, only for his afternoon to be marred when he was sent off late on. The Italian striker converted a penalty five minutes from half-time for his sixth league goal of the campaign. He was then sent off for the third time in Ligue 1 since moving to Nice at the start of last season, receiving a straight red card for chopping down Dijon defender Cedric Yambere from behind with a minute left. Balotelli remonstrated with the fourth official as he went off but Nice held on to end a run of four successive league defeats and six consecutive losses in all competitions. ""Without criticising anyone, it seems a bit harsh. He wanted to win the ball and had no intention to hurt anyone,"" said Nice coach Lucien Favre of Balotelli's sending-off. ""But it is true that a tackle from behind is a straight red. He was annoyed after the match and thought it was too hard on him. But now he's ok.""

A 6.5-million-euro signing from Standard Liege in 2014, Batshuayi scored 17 goals in Ligue 1 last season, and 23 times in all competitions in a rather poor Marseille outfit that finished 13th in France. The 22-year-old was however part of the Belgium squad at Euro 2016 and netted with his first touch on his tournament debut, converting a cross from his new Chelsea team-mate Hazard in a 4-0 win over Hungary. Batshuayi spent his first season at Marseille as understudy to Andre-Pierre Gignac, before the France international left for Mexican side Tigres at the end of the last campaign. Although he signed a contract extension in January, tying him to the club until 2020, he had been expected to leave this summer as Marseille scramble to balance their books or face a transfer ban."

""Bernard has the double attraction of being a great hope for the future whilst also having already gained a great deal of experience,"" said club vice-president Vadim Vasileyev. A French international at five age group levels, Mendy is Monaco's first signing of the close season as they seek to strengthen the side that came third in Ligue 1 last season."
136,22/05/2016,00:14,Ibrahimovic lifts French Cup in PSG swansong,Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored two goals and set up another as Paris Saint-Germain defeated bitter rivals Marseille 4-2 to clinch a 10th French Cup title on Saturday in the Swede's final game with the club.,"Blaise Matuidi struck PSG's opening goal inside two minutes at the Stade de France, but Marseille hit back just 10 minutes later through on-loan Newcastle midfielder Florian Thauvin. Ibrahimovic then converted a penalty immediately after half-time to restore the capital club's lead, before he played in Edinson Cavani to add a third goal on 56 minutes. The 34-year-old Swedish star signed off in trademark spectacular style with his second of the evening, the 156th and final goal of his PSG career, eight minutes from time as Laurent Blanc's side repeated last year's domestic treble despite a late consolation from Michy Batshuayi. ""I'm very happy to win my final match with a fantastic team,"" said Ibrahimovic. ""We've worked hard over the four years. It was an incredible adventure for me, especially when you know how things were when I arrived and how they are now. ""It's mission accomplished. I didn't learn to speak French but I've won everything. I came, I saw, I conquered."" Marseille interim coach Franck Passi lamented his side's slow start to both halves, rueing a lack of concentration. ""You must not give away goals like the ones we conceded because it's difficult for us to score them,"" he said. ""It needed to stay at 1-1 for longer, we had the chances but we only scored two goals. ""We couldn't to afford to concede a goal so quickly, we needed to be more focused."" With the Ligue 1 crown and French League Cup already in the bag, PSG were aiming to move level with record 10-time French Cup winners Marseille in a repeat of the 2006 final, won 2-1 by Paris. Ibrahimovic, who last weekend broke Argentine striker Carlos Bianchi's single-season club record of 37 league goals, was aiming to bring down the curtain the down on a glittering four-year stay in the French capital in fitting fashion having already helped PSG to 11 trophies. However, Abdelaziz Barrada fired an early warning signal to PSG in their quest for another title when the midfielder's 25-yard drive flashed just wide of Salvatore Sirigu's right-hand post with less than a minute gone. Blanc's side were ahead though with their first attack as Angel Di Maria, provider of 18 assists in his first Ligue 1 campaign, delivered another from a wicked right-wing cross that was turned in by Matuidi from close range. But Marseille, who were hoping to salvage their season after finishing 13th in the league, responded on 12 minutes as Thauvin's strike from just outside the area clipped Thiago Silva's leg to wrong-foot Sirigu. Thauvin was fortunate to escape punishment when he blocked Ibrahimovic's goalbound strike with his hand shortly before the interval, but Marseille were caught out seconds after the restart as Nicolas Nkoulou bundled over Matuidi inside the box. Ibrahimovic slotted past Steve Mandanda from the penalty spot to put PSG back in front on 47 minutes, before Paris' record goalscorer played in Cavani to steer home a third nine minutes later after Chile international Mauricio Isla lost possession in midfield. Matuidi then released Ibrahimovic to stroke home a fourth on 82 minutes and guarantee PSG a 10th successive win over Marseille, despite Batshuayi converting a rebound three minutes from the end after Sirigu could only parry Benjamin Mendy's low shot. Blanc then withdrew Ibrahimovic, who will leave Paris when his contract expires at the end of June, to a rapturous ovation late on in the final act of a remarkable chapter in PSG's history."

After a serious slump in the first half of the season last year's winner Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette failed to make the cut despite his 12 goals since January. Winner in 2013 and 2014 Zlatan Ibrahimovic is Ligue 1's top scorer with 32 goals and is top passer with 13 assists and looks to be hot favourite to pick up a third award in the final season of his PSG contract. Angel di Maria has also run defences ragged but cannot boast the same statistics or wield the same authority as his Swedish teammate. Playmaker Ben Arfa has been unstoppable with the ball at his feet and has led Nice to the brink of Champions League qualification in scintillating style and scored 17 Ligue 1 goals. While Diarra's performances have been the one constant in Marseille's awful season, the former Chelsea, Arsenal and Real Madrid star is tipped to join arch rivals PSG in the summer. The Player's Union also elect a coach of the year with PSG handler Laurent Blanc in the running after winning the League and League Cup with a French Cup final to come. Ben Arfa's coach Claude Puel, who took Monaco to the 2004 Champions League final, may well pip Blanc after a thrilling season at Nice. Also on the list are early season form team Angers' coach Stephane Moulin and Thierry Laurey who has worked wonders on a shoe-string budget at relegation threatened Corsican minnows Gazelec Ajaccio. Players short list: Hatem Ben Arfa (FRA/Nice), Lassana Diarra (FRA/Marseille), Angel Di Maria (ARG/PSG), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (SWE/PSG) Coaches short list: Laurent Blanc (FRA/Paris SG), Thierry Laurey (FRA/Gazélec Ajaccio), Stéphane Moulin (FRA/Angers), Claude Puel (FRA/Nice)"

But Ivory Coast international Sio snatched a contentious equaliser 10 minutes from time, controlling the ball with his hand before beating Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic from close range as the visitors' protests fell on deaf ears. Fabinho nearly scored a dramatic injury-time winner for Monaco, but the Brazilian's effort was cleared off the line by Fallou Diagne as Rennes ended their two-game losing run. ""I think Monaco played better and created three or four good situations,"" said the principality club's coach Leonardo Jardim. ""We missed these chances and then Rennes scored a beautiful goal with a piece of control of great quality,"" he added bitterly of the equaliser. ""When you work, you always do so to win, and when you don't win you are disappointed, but it is still in our hands if we are to reach our objective."" Monaco trail second-place Lyon, 3-2 winners at Toulouse on Saturday, on goal difference in the race for France's second automatic Champions League qualifying spot, with Nice and Saint-Etienne both two points adrift. Earlier, crisis-hit Marseille were again left to rue costly mistakes as the 10-man hosts were held to a 1-1 draw by Nantes. Sunday's game at the Velodrome was played in front of fewer than 20,000 fans as Marseille served a partial stadium ban following crowd trouble during their 0-0 draw against Bordeaux a fortnight ago. Michy Batshuayi went close to scoring the opening goal on 29 minutes when his low strike was tipped onto the post by Nantes goalkeeper Maxime Dupe, but it was a familiar tale as Nicolas Nkoulou gifted Nantes the lead two minutes later. A breakdown in communication between Nkoulou and goalkeeper Steve Mandanda resulted in the former diverting a cross into his own net when there appeared to be little danger. However Florian Thauvin, whose goal in a 1-0 win against Sochaux in midweek sent Marseille through to next month's French Cup final against Paris Saint-Germain, grabbed an equaliser just after the break. But Marseille's hopes of snapping a 10-match winless streak in the top flight suffered a damaging blow when Alaixys Romao was sent off on 55 minutes for kicking out at Yacine Bammou. And there was worse to come for OM as Abou Diaby, starting his second straight game after 18 months out through injury, hobbled off midway through the second half. ""There was a lack of rhythm in the first half and we started the game poorly. Then there was the goal which was a bit unlucky and that knocked down my players' confidence to a level even lower than it was at the start of the game against Sochaux,"" said OM interim coach Franck Passi. ""Since the start of the season quite a few things have gone against us, but the players never give up. Faced with adversity, to get back level and earn a point is important,"" he added, with OM five points above the relegation zone with three games left to play. Saint-Etienne remain firmly in the hunt for the third and final Champions League place as Nolan Roux struck two second-half goals in a 2-0 victory over Lorient, stretching their winning run to five matches. Montpellier all but banished their relegation fears after thrashing bottom side Troyes 4-1, while Gazelec Ajaccio climbed out of the bottom three, at the expense of Reims, following a 3-2 victory against Bastia in the Corsica derby."

Wednesday's 1-0 victory at Sochaux in the last four of the French Cup, which set up a showdown with bitter rivals Paris Saint-Germain next month, was one of the few positives for Marseille in a season which has lurched from bad to worse. Sunday's game at the Velodrome was played in front of fewer than 20,000 fans as Marseille served a partial stadium ban following crowd trouble during their 0-0 draw against Bordeaux a fortnight ago. Michy Batshuayi went close to scoring the opening goal on 29 minutes, but the Belgian striker's effort was tipped onto the post by Nantes goalkeeper Maxime Dupe. And just two minutes later Marseille fell behind in needless circumstances as a breakdown in communication between Nkoulou and goalkeeper Steve Mandanda resulted in the former diverting a cross into his own net. However, the home side responded on 49 minutes as Thauvin picked up the ball just inside the Nantes area, wriggling free past two defenders before calmly slotting past Dupe. But a moment of madness from Romao, who lashed out at Bammou, checked any momentum Marseille had been building and allowed Nantes, whose coach Michel Der Zakarian announced he will step down at the end of the season, to halt a four-game losing streak."

It was the first match back in charge for OM interim coach Franck Passi, after he also stood in earlier this season in the aftermath of Marcelo Bielsa's shock resignation, and he was pleased with how the team reacted to Michel's departure. ""I'm proud of my players. They had a challenge and they rose to the occasion,"" Passi said. ""The point was to take Marseille to the Stade de France, it was our only door (to save our season) and the players were wide awake tonight. ""This season has been crazy so let's be crazy, we will push PSG in the final."" Passi gave just a second start of the season to injury-plagued midfielder Abou Diaby and partnered Steven Fletcher with Michy Batshuayi in attack, but Marseille were toothless in the opening 45 minutes. Sochaux have used the confidence found in a Cup run that has seen them beat Bastia, Nantes and Monaco from the top flight, to embark on a five-match unbeaten streak and move away from danger of relegation to the third tier. In a dire first half the hosts had the only chance of any note, but after Benjamin Mendy could only partially clear, Florian Martin blazed his effort well wide. Marseille came out after the interval in improved form and took the lead when much-maligned winger Thauvin, on loan from Newcastle United, collected Fletcher's pass, before racing past his marker and finishing coolly at the near post. Albert Cartier's Sochaux had plenty of possession in the last half an hour but barely threatened an equaliser. The closest they came was through a Raphael Caceres free-kick which sailed harmlessly over. PSG edged to victory at Lorient on Tuesday night, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic grabbed the winner 15 minutes from time with his 42nd goal of the season. Laurent Blanc's men are still targeting a domestic clean sweep of trophies ahead of the French League Cup final against Lille on Saturday."

143,17/04/2016,23:14,"Monaco regain second, deepen crisis at Marseille",Monaco regained the initiative in their battle with Lyon for an automatic pass to the Champions League next season with a 2-1 defeat of crisis-club Marseille in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"Goals in the second half from Bernardo Silva and Andrea Raggi moved Monaco back into the all important second spot on 58 points, two clear of Lyon, with four games remaining. Marseille, who got a consolation stoppage time goal from Michy Batshuayi, were left languishing fifth from bottom, six points off the drop zone, at the end of a week when owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus put the ailing French giants up for sale. Monaco, dominating the encounter at their Louis II home, took a deserved lead two minutes after the restart when Silva went on a 40 metre charge towards the box, the Portuguese international shrugging off Marseille's Lucas Silva to fire low past the helpless Steve Mandanda. Silva had been thwarted by quick work from the Marseille keeeper towards the end of the first half. That was after Monaco's Lacina Traore had the ball in the back of the net only for the referee to disallow his effort for offside. Traore and Helder Costa were starting in place of Vagner Love and Thomas Lemas as manager Leonardo Jardim reshuffled his pack after last weekend's 4-1 loss at Lille. On 75 minutes Raggi wrapped up the win. The shaven-headed Italian defender controlled the ball well off a corner sent over by Silva and helped on its way by the head of Nabil Dirar to shoot right-footed from the edge of the box. On Friday Alexandre Lacazette grabbed a late equaliser as 10-man Lyon salvaged a 1-1 draw against fourth-placed Nice. Twenty four hours later Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paris Saint Germain ripped Caen to pieces in a 6-0 thrashing at the Parc des Princes. The champions are 28 points clear. The result came quick on the heels of PSG's disappointing 3-2 aggregate Champions League quarter-final defeat to Manchester City. Ibrahimovic scored twice, taking his tally to 32 league goals this season to equal his previous best, while Argentine playmaker Angel di Maria, so ineffective against City, netted with a sumptuous lob. Other goals came from the returning Blaise Matuidi, banned for the City game, a typically marauding Edinson Cavani run and shot made it five and defender Maxwell turned home a Cavani cross for 6-0. Coach Laurent Blanc conceded that the rout ""doesn't cancel out"" the massive disappointment felt by PSG of their Champions League exit. ""This win doesn't cancel out anything, it doesn't allow us to progress to the Champions League semi-finals,"" he said. They must now turn their attentions to the French Cup semi-final with Lorient on Tuesday and the League Cup final against resurgent Lille next Saturday at the Stade de France."
144,11/04/2016,13:08,Fans fed up as Marseille crisis shows no sign of ending,"The crisis at Marseille gets deeper and deeper with the French giants' interminable struggles on the field leading to mockery from their own fans, who have turned on the team as well as the club's owner.","Marseille's 0-0 draw at home to Bordeaux in Ligue 1 on Sunday was played out to fan protests at the team's struggles that featured banners depicting goats and the Benny Hill theme tune being played from the stands. But, along with the humour, the supporters also continued their theme of fury at the perceived apathy of owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who inherited the club after the death of her husband Robert in 2009. ""Margarita rich incompetent heiress get lost!"" read one banner unfurled behind the goal at the north end of the Stade Velodrome, while another read: ""Margarita go back to your real job, housewife."" The game itself ended in more bad blood with around 200 supporters having to be dispersed by riot police firing tear gas. Marseille are on a club record run of 14 home top-flight games without a win since they beat Bastia 4-1 in September. Home or away, they have not won in nine and as a result they are not safe yet from the threat of relegation, with just six points separating them from the drop zone and five matches still to play. ""We need three more points to ensure survival. It has been a difficult season. We need to finish it as well as possible and start again next season,"" said goalkeeper and captain Steve Mandanda, just about the only Marseille player to avoid the wrath of the disgruntled support in recent weeks. Marseille's season has never recovered from the disarray of last summer, when Marcelo Bielsa resigned in the wake of a 1-0 home defeat to Caen on the opening weekend of the campaign after uncertainty reigned for weeks surrounding his future. Spanish former Real Madrid player Michel was eventually appointed as his successor but has been unable to revive the fortunes of a team who finished fourth last season but saw a host of key players depart in the close season, including Dimitri Payet, Andre Ayew and Andre-Pierre Gignac. Marseille could yet salvage silverware from their season as they have a French Cup semi-final away to Ligue 2 Sochaux next midweek, but even if they win that their all-conquering bitter rivals Paris Saint-Germain could lie in wait in the final. Media reports in France have indicated that president Vincent Labrune wants Michel sacked but Louis-Dreyfus, with her hands firmly on the purse strings, refuses to sanction the necessary pay-off. She stated last week that Michel would see out the season, but Marseille legend and current club ambassador Basile Boli broke ranks to speak out publicly against the Spaniard on Sunday. ""I was surprised by Michel's choices,"" Boli, who scored the winning goal when OM beat AC Milan in the 1993 Champions League final and later played for Rangers, told media after Sunday's game. In particular, Boli was perplexed at Michel's decision to leave 19-goal leading scorer Michy Batshuayi on the bench against Bordeaux. ""There are experienced players you need to look to in these difficult moments and there we had a new-look team,"" he added before giving his backing to the protesting fans. ""The Marseille shirt is important and has a history. Marseille deserve better than that. This is a city that lives for football. The fans are going mad seeing their team like this and I understand them."""
145,03/04/2016,20:55,Heat on Michel as Bastia pour pain on Marseille,Bastia beat 10-man Marseille 2-1 in Ligue 1 on Sunday as speculation mounted that the struggling southern giants may sack their Spanish coach Michel.,"The result keeps Marseille in 13th place without a win since February 2, and more painfully, on fewer than half the points tally of their arch-rivals, champions Paris Saint-Germain. Speculation was already mounting this week that Marseille were considering sacking Michel, a former Real Madrid winger who has coached Getafe and Seville in his homeland and Olympiakos in Greece. ""We're stuck and it hurts,"" said Michel, who left the game in a car with the club president Vincent Labrune having arrived with the players on the team bus. ""The players are destroyed tonight,"" he lamented. ""It's now up to the president and the owner to decide what to do next."" The latest reverse is even more gut wrenching given that on Saturday Zlatan Ibrahimovic bagged a sumptuous hat-trick as PSG warmed up for their Champions League clash with Manchester City by beating Nice 4-1 at the Parc des Princes. That puts them on 80 points while Marseille have 39, with both having played 32 games. Marseille are just six points above the relegation zone. On a balmy afternoon at Bastia, speedy striker Francois Kamano ripped the Marseille defence open with a wide run in the 47th minute and his shot was met by defender Karim Rekik, who turned the ball into his own goal for a deserved opener. Marseille 'keeper Steve Mandanda then fouled Kamano and Gael Danic smashed the ensuing penalty straight down the middle to make it 2-0 after 56 minutes. Michel wasted no time in bringing on Michy Batshuayi and the Belgian striker grabbed a great peg-back goal in the 77th after taking a long ball down with his back to goal, turning three panicked defenders to immediately thump a shot beyond Bastia 'keeper Jean-Luis Leca's grasp. Marseille's Romain Alessandrini was then sent off after a two-footed revenge kick from the ground on Alexander Djiku, who had tripped him and was paid back with painful looking stud marks down his thigh. Former Newcastle midfielder Florian Thauvin reflected on Marseille's mood after this defeat saying: ""I'm sick and tired of everything. I really don't know what to say, I feel tired and beaten."" Later Sunday Lyon dug deep for a come-from-behind 3-1 win at Lorient that lifted them into third with a brace from Alexandre Lacazette either side of a fine strike from Rachid Ghezzal. After Lyon had gone behind to Marjeed Waris' strike, Lacazette took his Ligue 1 tally to 16 as he starts to find some of the form which marked him out last season, with six games to go. Monaco lost 2-1 at home to Bordeaux on Friday but remain second in Ligue 1 on 55 points, while Lyon in the third and final Champions League qualifying spot have 52. On Saturday teenage sensation Ousmane Dembele scored twice as Rennes registered a fourth win in five outings to climb fourth with 51 points while Nice, after their defeat in Paris, have 50. Resurgent Lille won a fourth straight league game earlier on Sunday as their Portuguese centre-forward Eder scored twice and set up a third for Zambian defender Stoppila Sunzu in an impressive 3-0 away win at Nantes. Lille have climbed from 15th to seventh in little over a month with 15 points from the last 18, as motivational manager Frederic Antonetti's techniques close Lille's season on far better form than under Herve Renard, who was fired in November. ""Nantes are a good side but we had them good and proper,"" said Antonetti. ""I think we have a chance of Europe now and our first objective when I came here was survival."""
146,18/03/2016,22:41,Rennes run riot against crisis club Marseille,Rennes moved provisionally into third place in Ligue 1 with a stunning 5-2 win at Marseille on Friday that plunged their hosts into full-blown crisis mode.,"The visitors were 3-0 up inside 14 minutes at the Stade Velodrome thanks to goals from Yoann Gourcuff, Fallou Diagne and Ousmane Dembele. Florian Thauvin and Jorge Rolando scored to bring Marseille back into the match but Gourcuff struck again and Giovanni Sio rounded off a remarkable Rennes victory in a tense atmosphere. The win takes Rennes, who have lost just once in seven matches, into the final Champions League qualifying berth in Ligue 1, a point clear of Nice and two ahead of Lyon before they play later this weekend. Meanwhile, Marseille continue to stagnate in mid-table and a run of seven league games without a win increases the pressure on Spanish coach Michel. Marseille ultras had decided to use the first quarter of an hour of the game to protest against the way the club is being run and their team's miserable record of not having won in 12 home league games since September, the worst such run in their history. However, by the time 15 minutes were up, their team's chances of ending that sequence were dead and buried. Gourcuff opened the scoring when he fired home from a Sio cutback for his first goal since returning for a second spell at Rennes, the club where he began his career -- his last goal for the Brittany side had come exactly a decade ago, on March 18, 2006. Defender Diagne escaped his marker to head home a Kamil Grosicki free-kick before teenage sensation Dembele, one of the hottest properties in European football, saw his shot deflected in to make it 3-0. At that point, tensions were rising in the stands and Marseille's Florian Thauvin was struck by a plastic bottle thrown from the crowd as riot police intervened to keep the calm. The threat of a terrace revolt was eased as Thauvin curled one in to reduce the deficit in the 20th minute, and defender Rolando poked home a second goal for OM early in the second half after Rennes goalkeeper Benoit Costil dropped a corner. Remy Cabella then hit the post from a Javier Manquillo cutback but a rare mistake by Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda -- one of the few impressive performers in Michel's side this season -- allowed Rennes to score again just before the hour mark. Mandanda let a Gourcuff shot slip under his grasp for Rennes' fourth goal and Sio rubbed salt into Marseille's wounds when he converted the visitors' fifth after being superbly set up by Dembele. Lyon are at home to Nantes on Saturday while Nice face struggling Gazelec Ajaccio on Sunday before champions Paris Saint-Germain, who secured the title last weekend, entertain second-placed Monaco at the Parc des Princes."

However, victory at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard potentially came at a cost with midfielder Blaise Matuidi facing a race against time to be fit for Wednesday's trip to Stamford Bridge. The France international was seen clutching his hamstring after he was taken off ""as a precaution"" midway through the second half, with Laurent Blanc admitting he was ""worried"" about Matuidi's fitness. Blanc will have to decide whether or not to rest key players ahead of the Chelsea clash, with Marco Verratti (groin) and Angel Di Maria (thigh) also struggling with injuries. The PSG boss though was pleased with the manner in which the runaway Ligue 1 leaders responded at Saint-Etienne after suffering their first defeat of the season. ""We can't erase (the loss), but we can use it to our advantage. That's what we did (on Wednesday) and I'm very happy about it. It was a good way to respond after the defeat which provoked quite a buzz,"" said Blanc, in quotes published by French daily L'Equipe. ""Montpellier will be a difficult match because we'll be thinking about the game against Chelsea which will be huge,"" said PSG captain Thiago Silva, with 2012 French champions Montpellier arriving in the capital on the back of three straight wins to pull clear of relegation trouble. ""We're ready for Chelsea. I think everyone knows what awaits us over there. I hope (Matuidi) will be able to play because he's an important player for the team,"" the Brazilian added. Defeat at Lyon means Paris can't clinch a fourth straight French title this weekend, but they could do so next week should Monaco slip up at fellow European hopefuls Caen on Friday. Monaco have lost just once in 15 league outings and have an eight-point cushion over Caen, who trail third-place Lyon on goal difference, in the race for the second automatic Champions League qualifying berth. Four wins in five has reignited Lyon's campaign and Bruno Genesio's side will bid to build on recent momentum when Guingamp visit Parc OL in Sunday's late game. A four-match winless run has slowed Nice's European charge, but they will fancy their chances of ending that series at home to bottom side Troyes on Saturday. Rennes and Nantes, unbeaten in the league since November, meet in the Brittany derby with both sides also firmly in the hunt for Europe, while Saint-Etienne travel to slumping Angers. Pascal Dupraz will embark on the daunting task of trying to salvage Toulouse's top-flight status having replaced Dominique Arribage ahead of Sunday's trip to Marseille. Toulouse are 10 points from safety and without a win in eight, but there is hope as Marseille have struggled mightily at the Stade Velodrome with just two wins all season and none in their last 11 home fixtures.

It was only five minutes from time that St Etienne thought they had scored the potentially winning goal that would have sent them above Nice into third place in Ligue 1 -- the final Champions League qualifying spot. Kevin Monnet-Paquet shot home left-footed from Romain Hamouma's pass. The draw barely helps either side as St Etienne could lose fourth spot to Lyon or Rennes later on Sunday while Marseille are 10th and still five points behind Nice in the tight race to qualify for Europe's premier club competition. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain maintained their 24-point lead at the top with a 4-1 victory over lowly Reims as Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a brace. They now need only three more wins and a draw from their final 11 matches to win the Ligue 1 title. Monaco remain second and determined to delay PSG's inevitable crowning as French champions after a 3-1 win over rock-bottom Troyes sent them eight points clear of Nice, who drew 0-0 at Bordeaux on Friday night."

152,08/02/2016,00:10,Di Maria fires unbeaten PSG past Marseille,Paris Saint-Germain defeated bitter rivals Marseille 2-1 on Sunday to extend their record unbeaten run in Ligue 1 to 34 matches as the hosts remained unable to solve their home woes.,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored his league-leading 21st goal of the season to give PSG the lead inside two minutes at the Stade Velodrome, but Remy Cabella hauled Marseille level midway through the first half with a wonderful solo effort. However, Angel Di Maria struck the winning goal on 71 minutes to hand PSG a 15th straight win in all competitions and keep Laurent Blanc's side a huge 24 points clear at the top of the table. ""Marseille gave us a really physical battle which we expected. We showed our solidarity to see out the victory, but we've now got to ready ourselves for the two games before Chelsea (in the Champions League). It's not going to be easy,"" said Blanc. ""The players, like you (journalists), are thinking about the game against Chelsea but...it's not the last game before Chelsea, there's one in three days and another in six."" Marseille have now failed to win any of their last 10 home games in the league, while their streak of 11 games without defeat was also snapped after succumbing to a ninth successive 'Classique' loss. Despite the defeat Michel's side are still just five points off third-place Nice, who they visit next Sunday, in the race for the final Champions League spot. Billed as French football's most explosive fixture, Sunday's encounter on the south coast was no different with five people arrested prior to kick-off following a run-in with police outside the ground. Blanc made six changes to the side that beat Lorient on Wednesday to set a new record for the longest sequence of games without defeat in the French top flight, recalling the likes of Di Maria, Blaise Matuidi and David Luiz. Marseille welcomed back both Michy Batshuayi and Abdelaziz Barrada from suspension, while Lassana Diarra made his return from injury in central midfield. PSG were unbeaten in their last 10 meetings with Marseille, having won the last six in Ligue 1, and the visitors again seized the upper hand before the hosts had time to settle. Maxwell was sent galloping down the left wing after after being released by Matuidi and the Brazilian picked out Ibrahimovic at the back post as the Swede netted for the fifth game running. France midfielder Matuidi again dissected the Marseille defence a few minutes later, although this time Di Maria dragged his shot agonisingly wide of the far post. Barrada should have levelled for the home side when Thiago Motta failed to clear Brice Dja Djedje's cross, but the Morocco midfielder lashed over as the ball dropped invitingly for him. However, the hosts did equalise on 25 minutes as Cabella gathered the ball near the halfway line, skipped past Motta and fired low beyond Kevin Trapp from outside the area, with the German unable to keep it out despite getting a strong hand to the ball. Lucas wasted a prime chance to restore PSG's lead when he scuffed wide after a sublime Di Maria through ball, while Maxwell was forced to clear off the line after Batshuayi hooked a corner goalwards. But PSG continued their dominance of Marseille as Di Maria, set up by Ibrahimovic, swept home his ninth goal of the season 19 minutes from time to keep the capital club's winning run intact. Steven Fletcher came on for his Marseille debut late on, while Georges-Kevin Nkoudou watched a shot flash wide as the hosts hit PSG on the break but ultimately were left still searching for a first home win since September. Earlier, Saint-Etienne registered a thumping 4-1 win at Bordeaux to move level on points with Nice, while Rennes salvaged a point late on in a 1-1 draw at Lille. On Saturday, Monaco strengthened their hold on second place with a 1-0 win over Cote d'Azur rivals Nice, while Lyon continued their mini-revival with a 3-0 victory away to Angers."

PSG -- with 66 points from 24 games -- have an impressive 24-point lead with their fourth consecutive and sixth overall league title beckoning. The Parisians have won their past eight 'Classique' clashes with Marseille, and another would give them a new record of consecutive wins against their rivals. ""To win we have to stick to our philosophy. We can't change it during a Classique,"" said Brazilian defender Maxwell, who has never been on the losing side in 10 previous meetings with Marseille. ""We're in a good place. We have to be confident, and have the same desire we've shown up until now. That makes the difference in these matches."" Marseille, who claimed the last of their ten Ligue 1 titles back in 2010, are eighth in the league -- 32 points behind PSG. A 1-0 victory at Montpellier Tuesday pushed Marseille's unbeaten league run to 11 matches, with their last away loss a 2-1 defeat to PSG at the Parc de Princes on October 4. But that impressive statistic conceals misery at their Velodrome stronghold where they have not won since September 13. Blanc's side will be looking to further flex their muscles with a Champions League last 16 tie against Chelsea on February 16. But counterpart Michel can count on the support of their loyal fans with PSG's supporters banned from travelling to Marseille because of security concerns. Marseille will be without newly-signed winger Florian Thauvin after he received a red card against Montpellier, but Scotland striker Steven Fletcher, also a transfer window signing, should give the southern giants fresh legs. ""It's a match we have to win, for the club, for the fans and above all for us,"" said Marseille midfielder Remy Cabella. ""If we got a result against Paris it would give us a boost."" Striker Georges-Kévin Nkoudou added: ""I know that there is always pressure between Paris and Marseille, but it remains a classic, and it's up to us to rise to the occasion."" Second-placed Monaco, 24 points behind PSG, host Nice, three points behind in third, in a classic Riviera derby on Saturday. The clash is crucial for qualification for elite European football next season, with Monaco's billionaire Russian owner Dmitry Rybolovlev making a rare appearance at training to motivate the troops. ""He said some words to motivate us, to wake us up and to take this match seriously,"" said Morocco midfielder Nabil Dirar. Lyon, back into the top half, above 11th-place Bordeaux on goal difference, are six points adrift of the Champions League spots. Coach Bruno Genesio is hopeful their 3-0 win over Bordeaux will boost his side. ""It's good for morale,"" said Genesio. ""I hope it will be the spark that will open the way to some good results."" Lyon travel to Angers, sitting fourth with 37 points, and looking to get back to winning ways after losing 2-1 at Reims, while Bordeaux host fifth-placed Saint-Etienne. Nantes will be looking to extend their unbeaten streak to 11 matches at Toulouse as Lille host Rennes, Guingamp travel to Corsica side Gazelec Ajaccio and Reims visit Caen. Tailenders Troyes, who sacked coach Claude Robin after a heavy 4-0 defeat at Guingamp left them 15 points from safety, travel to Bastia on Saturday. Fixtures (all 19:00 GMT unless stated)"

""Sunderland AFC have confirmed that striker Steven Fletcher has joined French side Olympique Marseille until the end of the season, when his contract with Sunderland expires,"" Sunderland said on their website. ""The 28-year-old Scotland international could make his debut for Michel's side in Tuesday's Ligue 1 game at Montpellier.""

For Lyon, who exited the League Cup in midweek following a 2-1 defeat at holders Paris Saint-Germain, this latest loss simply yielded another disappointment in a season full of setbacks. Both sides had entered Sunday's clash level on 29 points and looking to keep in touch with the European places, and it was Lyon who largely bossed the first half. On-loan striker Jean-Christophe Bahebeck tried to catch out Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes with an early free-kick, but the visitors were on top after that as Stephane Ruffier twice thwarted Rachid Ghezzal, the second stop a stunning low save just before the break. Ruffier then palmed away a Clement Grenier free-kick after half-time, before the crossbar came to Saint-Etienne's rescue as Ghezzal's cross was diverted towards his own goal by Kevin Theophile-Catherine. But it was the hosts who made the breakthrough on 76 minutes when a stray pass from Corentin Tolisso was pounced upon by Kevin Monnet-Paquet, who slipped in Soderlund for the Norwegian to notch his first goal for his new club. Earlier, Marseille snapped a four-match winless run in the league as they claimed a fifth victory in six away games. Marseille arrived at the Stade Michel d'Ornano unbeaten in seven league matches, although they had drawn their last four outings, and grabbed a 12th-minute lead when goal-line technology was used to determine that Michy Batshuayi's shot had crossed the line after coming back off the post. Batshuayi should have added a second with the goal at his mercy a few minutes later, but the Belgian atoned for that miss by setting up Georges-Kevin Nkoudou to steer in Marseille's second on the hour. Ronny Rodelin pulled one back for the hosts after beating Steve Mandanda to a free-kick, but Bouna Sarr erased any hopes of a comeback as he volleyed home Alaixys Romao's inviting cross on 83 minutes. The victory pushed Marseille up to eighth, five points adrift of third-place Angers, with Caen dropping to seventh. Monaco moved back into second place in the table after winning 2-0 at Lorient to stretch their unbeaten run in the league to eight games. Thomas Lemar gave Monaco a 53rd-minute lead in Brittany before Joao Moutinho curled home an exquisite free-kick to leave Leonardo Jardim's men 21 points behind runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain. PSG recorded their ninth consecutive win in all competitions and extended their club record unbeaten league run to 30 matches dating back to last March as Zlatan Ibrahimovic's 73rd-minute strike was enough for them to see off Toulouse 1-0 on Saturday."

Mandanda's contract expires in June and he had been linked with a move to Aston Villa, who currently sit bottom of the English Premier League. ""I don't know where my future lies,"" added the 30-year-old but his decision to stay put for now comes as a boost to OM a day after Benjamin Mendy and leading scorer Michy Batshuayi signed contract extensions at the Stade Velodrome until 2019 and 2020 respectively."

But Marseille ensured a share of the spoils when Bouna Sarr arrived to convert a Georges-Kevin Nkoudou ball held up from the byline to the left of the box. It looked as if Nkoudou had done well to get to the ball before it crossed the line but replays later confirmed that no goal should have been awarded and a goal-kick given. It was a frustrating result for both sides, with Marseille still stuck in mid-table after seeing their run without a home league win extended to six games. Montpellier at least moved a point clear of the bottom three but were left to wonder what might have been. Ninga impressed with two goals in a 4-2 win at Lyon last week and he put the visitors ahead just after the half-hour mark after being brilliantly set up by Ryad Boudebouz. Cabella, the former Montpellier player now on loan at OM from Newcastle United, levelled early in the second half from close range but Ninga pounced on a Karim Rekik error to restore the away side's advantage before Sarr made it 2-2. Later on Sunday, Bordeaux entertain Guingamp with both teams looking to pull clear of the relegation zone before Saint-Etienne host Rennes knowing a victory could take them up to fourth. Paris Saint-Germain are a huge 15 points clear at the summit and still unbeaten domestically this season after Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice in a 3-0 win at Nice on Friday. Angers are up to second thanks to a 2-0 win against crisis-hit Lyon in the last Ligue 1 match at the Stade de Gerland as Cheikh N'Doye got both goals. Caen are third after losing 2-1 at home to a resurgent Lille, while Monaco leapfrogged Lyon into fourth as Lacina Traore's brace secured a 2-1 victory at third-bottom Bastia."
161,20/11/2015,16:43,Football 'a means of escape' for grieving Diarra,France midfielder Lassana Diarra has told his club coach at Marseille that he has no intention of putting his career on hold despite being hit hard by last week's terror attacks in Paris.,"Diarra was playing for France in last Friday's friendly against Germany when three enormous explosions were heard in the vicinity of the Stade de France. It soon emerged that the blasts, which killed one person as well as three suicide bombers, were part of a night of terror which cost the lives of 130 people altogether. Among the dead was Diarra's cousin Asta Diakite, fatally wounded on a street in the 10th arrondissement of the French capital. Despite that, Diarra travelled with the France squad for Tuesday's friendly with England and appeared from the bench in the 2-0 loss at Wembley. ""We spoke with Lass on Tuesday, when things were calmer, and he said to me he couldn't stop playing football, that it was a means of escape for him,"" said Marseille coach Michel at a press conference on Friday. However, former Arsenal, Chelsea and Real Madrid player Diarra did not train on Friday and it is not yet clear if he will feature for his side in Sunday's Ligue 1 trip to Saint-Etienne. ""He was supposed to train with us this morning (Friday) but he couldn't because of family problems. He will come tomorrow. The person is always more important than the player,"" added Michel. ""When one loses someone dear to them, football, or any other profession, can help you, not to forget, but to move on. ""We must all be there for him, close by, and show him our solidarity,"" added the Spaniard. ""What happens to our players affects us, the joy as well as the sadness. We prefer to share these feelings. ""It is not easy to train in these conditions. It is not about being disgusted or sad, but we wonder what kind of world we are living in."" The attacks were the worst in Europe since the Madrid train bombings of March 2004. Michel, a Madrid native, said ""nothing was the same again"" after the attacks on the Spanish capital. ""In sport there is no colour, religion or race. Often the face of football that is shown is a violent one, but this week at Wembley it was an example of solidarity."""
162,08/11/2015,19:10,Nice bounce back to sink Marseille,Nice returned to winning ways on Sunday as a first-half Valere Germain goal secured a 1-0 victory away to Mediterranean rivals Marseille at the Stade Velodrome in Ligue 1.,"Germain, who was born in Marseille when his father Bruno was playing for OM and supported the club as a boy, got the only goal of the game in the 16th minute, collecting a Wallyson Mallmann pass and drilling in a low shot from range that beat Steve Mandanda and found the bottom-left corner. It was a welcome win for Nice, who were recently inspired to a fine run of form by the brilliance of Hatem Ben Arfa but made the trip along France's south coast after failing to win any of their previous three Ligue 1 outings. Claude Puel's side move provisionally up to sixth in the table, but there was more frustration for Marseille, who have never really got going under Spanish coach Michel. After three straight wins in all competitions, this setback leaves OM in 12th place, only three points above the relegation zone. ""I am more disappointed than worried,"" said Michel, who had to make do without the injured Romain Alessandrini and the suspended Lassana Diarra, Remy Cabella and Nicolas Nkoulou. ""I don't think it was the absences that made the difference today."" The encounter was notable for the return of Ben Arfa to face his former club -- the winger, who was this week recalled to the France squad for upcoming friendlies against Germany and England, played for Marseille between 2008 and 2010 before joining Newcastle United. However, it was on-loan Monaco striker Germain who made the decisive intervention, his fifth goal of the season, and first since late September, proving enough to give Nice the points. Ben Arfa had a shot palmed away by Mandanda after he held off Karim Rekik just after the half-hour mark, and he also had a free-kick turned around the post by Mandanda in the second period. Jean-Michael Seri also threatened from a free-kick for the visitors, while Marseille offered little, coming closest to levelling when Michy Batshuayi muscled his way into the box in the second half before firing over the bar. Later on Sunday, Lyon host bitter rivals Saint-Etienne in what will be the last ever Rhone-Alpes derby at the Stade de Gerland before OL move into a new 59,000-seat stadium early in the New Year ahead of Euro 2016. Mathieu Valbuena was included in the Lyon starting line-up at the end of a week overshadowed by the arrest of his France colleague Karim Benzema. The Real Madrid striker was charged with complicity to blackmail and conspiring to commit a criminal act in an extortion case involving a sex tape featuring Valbuena. Second place is the prize on offer to the winner of that game, while Monaco can climb into the European places if they win at Bordeaux. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain extended their lead at the top of the table to 11 points by thumping hapless Toulouse 5-0 to continue their unbeaten start to the domestic season. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice, and now has nine goals in his last six Ligue 1 appearances, with Angel Di Maria, Lucas Moura and Ezequiel Lavezzi also on target at the Parc des Princes. Caen are second in the table after beating Guingamp 2-1 in Normandy with burly striker Andy Delort scoring what proved to be the winning goal."

Batshuayi is now top of the Ligue 1 scoring charts with eight goals, but Marseille have no senior back-up attacker. ""I've written to Father Christmas to ask for a striker,"" said Michel ahead of Thursday's Europa League game against Sporting Braga. ""But what I really want over the transfer window is for 'Michy' to score lots of goals."" Marseille are currently 12th in Ligue 1 with 15 points from 12 matches."

Leonardo Jardim's team opened the scoring in the 11th minute at the Stade Auguste-Delaune when Nabil Dirar crossed from the right and the diminutive Silva got up to head in his third goal of the season at the back post. They might have added to their lead but unfortunate Argentine striker Guido Carrillo hit both posts before the interval, heading against one upright from a Joao Moutinho corner and then seeing a low deflected shot come back off the other. Monaco were worthy winners, even if substitute Jordan Siebatcheu came close to equalising for Reims in stoppage time with a shot that beat Danijel Subasic in the away goal but rebounded back off the woodwork. The hosts had been reduced to 10 men midway through the second half when Antoine Devaux walked for a second yellow card, as Olivier Guegan's side slumped to a third straight 1-0 defeat. For Monaco, it was a first league win in a month and saw them make it seven matches without defeat in all competitions as they climb to eighth in the table. ""Away from home our team is very compact and very good in the transitions,"" said Jardim. ""We tried to score the second goal, first by playing our game, and then by trying to be more direct. We were unable to put the game to bed, but I think we deserved the victory."" Marseille, meanwhile, ended a run of seven games without a win as Michy Batshuayi and Romain Alessandrini scored to see off Lille in France's far north. Batshuayi opened the scoring late in the first half, converting his eighth goal already this season after Alessandrini's initial attempt had come back off the post. The Belgian then returned the favour in the second half, setting up Alessandrini for a superb curling finish high into the net to double Marseille's lead. Sebastien Corchia pulled a goal back for LOSC but, having scored just five goals in 10 league games before this weekend, finding an equaliser proved to be beyond them. ""I said yesterday that we would need men to win so I am very happy with our performance,"" said Marseille coach Michel. ""We were fantastic tonight and we need to play like this every time."" Elsewhere on Sunday, Bordeaux recorded just their third league win of the campaign, beating winless bottom club Troyes 1-0 thanks to a late strike by 18-year-old substitute Adam Ounas. Leaders and defending champions Paris Saint-Germain can extend their advantage at the top of the table to seven points with a win at home to Saint-Etienne in Sunday's late kick-off at the Parc des Princes. Second-placed Angers were held to a 0-0 draw at home by Guingamp on Saturday, a result that did nevertheless allow them to stretch their unbeaten run to six matches. Caen, in third, lost 2-0 at home to Nantes on Friday, while Lyon beat Toulouse 3-0 with goals by Sergi Darder, Mathieu Valbuena and Maxwell Cornet. Nice's superb run of form was abruptly ended in a 3-1 defeat at previously winless Gazelec Ajaccio, while Montpellier beat Bastia 2-0 and Lorient drew 1-1 with Rennes in a Brittany derby."

Marseille's failure to build on an encouraging performance in losing 2-1 at Paris Saint-Germain in their last outing before the international break leaves them without a win in six matches in all competitions. They continue to languish in 16th place in the table and are six points adrift of Lorient, with the Bretons provisionally up to eighth having lost just one of their last six outings. OM were looking for revenge for a 5-3 defeat at home to Lorient last season and they took the lead in the 22nd minute when Belgian striker Batshuayi converted from the spot after Francois Bellugou had been penalised for handball. However, the away side were back on level terms eight minutes prior to half-time as Nicolas Nkoulou got caught underneath a high ball and his Cameroon colleague Moukandjo took advantage to score. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain warmed up for their Champions League clash with Real Madrid by beating Bastia 2-0 in Corsica thanks to two second-half goals by Zlatan Ibrahimovic. PSG are still unbeaten this season and remain five points clear of surprise nearest challengers Angers and Caen, who both won away from home, 2-1 at Toulouse and 1-0 at Reims respectively. Saint-Etienne are fourth after easing to a 2-0 win at home to bottom side Gazelec Ajaccio with Robert Beric and Kevin Monnet-Paquet both on target, but Rennes can go back above Les Verts on goal difference if they beat Nice on Sunday evening. A late Rafael equaliser earned Lyon a 1-1 draw at Monaco on Friday after the principality club had taken the lead through on-loan Chelsea midfielder Mario Pasalic. Elsewhere this weekend, Nantes beat struggling Troyes 3-0 and Guingamp held Lille 1-1 in Brittany. Sunday's other game sees Bordeaux host Montpellier."
166,02/10/2015,02:20,PSG-OM headline act as Lyon seek Reims remedy,Paris Saint-Germain renew their rivalry with bitter foes Marseille at the Parc des Princes on Sunday as Laurent Blanc's men bid to retain their unbeaten start going into the international break.,"PSG have a four-point lead over nearest rivals Saint-Etienne in Ligue 1 and made it two wins from two Champions League group stage matches with a 3-0 triumph away to Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday. ""Our start to the Champions League is perfect but we're still not qualified for the next round,"" PSG captain Thiago Silva told Canal+ after the match in Lviv. ""Now we have to rest up and starting Thursday we'll prepare ourselves for Sunday. Marseille have plenty of qualities, it's always special to play against them."" Wednesday's performance in Ukraine was arguably PSG's most complete display this term, a worrying sign for a Marseille side languishing down in 15th place, 12 points behind their arch rivals. Despite thumping wins over Troyes and Bastia, OM have lost four of eight league matches so far and new boss Michel is still adapting to the French mentality. ""It appears that in French football players preserve themselves so they don't play too many matches in a row, and they choose their matches within reason. This surprises me but I have to get used to it,"" said Michel, in quotes published by French sports daily L'Equipe. ""They tell me that when there are big games coming up, against PSG for example, that this is normal behaviour. I have to accept it but I have trouble understanding it,"" added the former Real Madrid midfielder, who spoke of certain players asking to sit out Thursday's home Europa League clash against Slovan Liberec, which OM lost 1-0. Recent history is not on the Spaniard's side either as PSG have won the last seven meetings between the two clubs, including a 3-2 victory at the Stade Velodrome in April that effectively signalled the end of Marseille's title challenge. Lyon's woes in front of goal persisted in their midweek 1-0 Champions League defeat at home to Valencia as last season's runners-up continue to struggle to overcome a long-term injury to Nabil Fekir. Hubert Fournier's men enter Saturday's showdown with fourth-placed Reims, unbeaten in their last five, already eight points adrift of PSG. ""Winning against Reims would be a good remedy to (Tuesday's) disappointment,"" Fournier, whose side have won just one of six matches since losing Fekir, told the club's website. ""There are more expectations than last season, perhaps too many right now for several reasons. ""Alexandre (Lacazette) is a case in point. He's struggling, just like the rest of the team, to meet people's expectations,"" Fournier said of the reigning Ligue 1 Player of the Year, who has scored just one goal this term and was left out of Didier Deschamps' latest France squad. ""(But) we're just four points from second place, so it's not an irreversible situation,"" added the OL coach. Second-placed Saint-Etienne, who had their five-match winning run emphatically snapped by Nice last weekend, will aim to get back on track at Caen, while third-placed Rennes, coming off three successive draws, go to mid-table Monaco. Free-scoring Nice have racked up 13 goals over the course of a three-match winning streak and will look to continue their ascent at home to Nantes. Promoted Angers, one of four teams five points off the pace, host Bastia, Lorient face Bordeaux, while goal-shy Lille kick off week nine against fellow strugglers Montpellier on Friday."
167,27/09/2015,19:30,Angers heap more misery on Marseille,Marseille's dismal start to the season continued with a woeful 2-1 defeat at home to Ligue 1 newboys Angers on Sunday.,"Goals from Thomas Mangani, a penalty, and Romain Thomas had Marseille in deep trouble at the Stade Velodrome before Michy Batshuayi reduced the deficit 11 minutes from time, again from the spot. The result left Michel's struggling side down in the bottom half of the table, just four points above the relegation zone. ""We played very badly in the first half, that's not the way to start a match,"" moaned Michel. ""We weren't in the match and were below par for many minutes. We lacked creativity and penetration. ""I can't explain it but we'll have to find a solution."" Angers continued their impressive return to the top flight after an absence of 21 years as they moved into fifth, but level on points with third-placed Rennes. ""Fifteen points after eight matches is crazy,"" said Angers coach Stephane Moulin. ""We managed to play to our strengths, the strengths of our club, our generosity, collective discipline. ""We're not crazy, we know Marseille are better than us, individually and collectively, but in football little teams can make life difficult for the big ones."" It was a dire finish to a peculiar match in which the Velodrome was empty at both ends due to a Ligue 1 punishment related to last weekend's incidents during the 1-1 draw with Lyon, in which several Marseille fans threw missiles at police and onto the pitch. Michel's team failed to muster a single shot on goal in the opening period despite dominating possession. But they were caught out when Remy Cabella gave away a penalty in bringing down Arnold Bouka Moutou and Mangani shot home high down the centre of the goal from 12 yards on 38 minutes. Marseille improved after the break, creating three chances in quick succession but Angers goalkeeper Ludovic Butelle saved the best of those with his feet from Bouna Sarr. Mangani set up the visitors' second 20 minutes from time with a free-kick that Thomas headed home. Nine minutes later the hosts were given a lifeline as Ferebory Dore brought down Lucas Ocampos and Batshuayi despatched the spot-kick. There was still time for Marseille to snatch a point but Paolo De Ceglie, Ocampos, Batshuayi and Cabella all missed good chances. A lucky goal from Nicolas Benezet a minute from time denied Monaco victory as Guingamp snatched a 3-3 draw. Having won 3-2 at Montpellier on Thursday, Monaco looked on course for a second successive away victory but despite taking the lead three times in the match, through Bernardo Silva, Andrea Raggi and Nabil Dirar, the hosts pegged them back each time thanks to Slovan Privat and a Benezet brace. The result left Monaco eighth and Guingamp 13th. Montpellier, the 2012 champions, got their first win of the season in 2-1 victory over mid-table Lorient. Jonas Martin hit the winner in the 57th minute after Lorient's Rafidine Abdullah had cancelled out Ramy Bensebaini's opener, although Montpellier remain in the bottom three. Champions Paris Saint-Germain extended their lead at the top on Saturday with a 4-1 win at Nantes as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani and Angel Di Maria all got on the scoresheet. Caen and Reims drew level with Rennes on 15 points with 2-0 wins over Gazelec Ajaccio and Lille respectively. Saint-Etienne remain second and can cut the gap to PSG to a point if they beat Nice later on Sunday."
168,24/09/2015,23:22,Marseille suffer partial stadium ban after violence,"Marseille were ordered to shut down their hardline, ultra sections at their Stade Velodrome home on Thursday after last weekend's match with Lyon was held up for 20 minutes by crowd violence.","The French Professional League (LFP) told the club to close their north and south enclosures while a full inquiry was launched by the body's disciplinary commission. The sections of the ground will remain closed until October 15, the date when the Marseille board will also meet. ""The seriousness of the facts...and the context of recurrence"" sparked the decision, said disciplinary commission president Sebastien Deneux. Last Sunday's game was halted after an hour and the players instructed to return to the dressing rooms as objects, including bottles and cups, rained down from the stands. The return of Lyon's Mathieu Valbuena to face his former club had already made for a charged atmosphere with the France international, roundly booed throughout, already the target of missiles when taking corners."
169,21/09/2015,03:17,Lyon chief blasts Marseille crowd violence,Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas insisted early Monday that the toxic Ligue 1 clash between his side and Marseille should not have been restarted after a 20-minute stoppage caused by missile-throwing fans.,"With just over an hour gone at Marseille's Stade Velodrome ground, officials instructed both teams to return to the dressing rooms as objects, including bottles and cups, rained down from the stands as Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes was trying to take a goal-kick. The return of Lyon's Mathieu Valbuena to face his former club had already made for a charged atmosphere with the France international, roundly booed throughout, already the target of missiles when taking corners. Lyon were leading 1-0 through a first-half penalty from Alexandre Lacazette when play was interrupted. But on the resumption, Marseille equalised to rescue a point. ""The best decision would have been not to restart the game,"" said Aulas, who believes such a decision would have prompted Marseille to rein in their notoriously unruly hardline fans. ""It was a very disagreeable atmosphere. I have been in football for 28 years but never have I seen the things like tonight. What happened to Valbuena was a vendetta, his physical safety was put in danger."" Marseille president Vincent Labrune tried to play down the trouble. ""The club will take its responsibility for the two or three bottles of beer that were thrown on the pitch. But we all have to be sensible. Me, I will accept my responsibilities as president and I want others to do the same -- from the federation, the referees' body and Lyon,"" he said. Lacazette, scorer of a club-record 27 goals last season on his way to winning Ligue 1's Player of the Year award, converted a contentious first-half penalty to atone for his midweek miss in the Champions League. But Marseille, despite seeing Romain Alessandrini sent off just before half-time, rescued a point after the interruption courtesy of Karim Rekik's first goal in French football. Valbuena was returning to the Stade Velodrome where he starred for Marseille until leaving for Dynamo Moscow last year before signing with Lyon in August. The Lyon playmaker brushed off the jeers and missiles from the crowd as well as a series of heavy challenges and played a key role in the visitors taking a 25th-minute lead. Valbuena threaded a pass through to Lacazette who then went down following minimal contact with Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda before calmly tucking away the resulting spot-kick. Lacazette had seen his late penalty saved in Wednesday's 1-1 draw against nine-man Gent in Belgium but held his nerve on Sunday to end his early-season drought. Lacazette should have added to his tally a few minutes later when he timed a run in behind the Marseille defence to perfection only for his shot to crash back off the upright with Mandanda well beaten. Marseille were reduced to 10 men just before half-time with Alessandrini dismissed for a crude challenge on Valbuena. Earlier, Saint-Etienne recorded a fourth successive league win, 2-0 against Nantes, to move to within a point of leaders Paris Saint-Germain. Les Verts took a first-half lead at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard through a first Ligue 1 goal from teenager Jonathan Bamba. Slovenian international Robert Beric, who arrived from Rapid Vienna last month, then added the second just after half-time to seal victory for Christophe Galtier's side. Monaco's indifferent start to the season continued as the principality side found themselves two goals down to Lorient inside 20 minutes. Didier Ndong hammered a long-range thunderbolt beyond Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic before Benjamin Jeannot added a second for the visitors. Almamy Toure pulled one back for Monaco shortly after and the hosts were back on level terms when Thomas Lemar equalised just after the interval but substitute Benjamin Moukandjo's 59th-minute strike won it for Lorient. On Saturday, Edinson Cavani kept Paris Saint-Germain's unbeaten start to the season intact as he equalised late on at Reims in a 1-1 draw."

But the OL playmaker brushed off the jeers and missiles from the crowd as well as a series of heavy challenges and played a key role in the visitors taking a 25th-minute lead. ""Perhaps we allowed our concentration to lapse in the five minutes after the interruption, but that's not an excuse,"" said Lyon coach Hubert Fournier. ""I don't want comment on the incidents, the officials made their decisions."" In the build-up to Lyon's goal, Valbuena threaded a pass through to Lacazette who then went down following minimal contact with OM goalkeeper Steve Mandanda before calmly tucking away the resulting spot-kick. Lacazette had seen his late penalty saved in Wednesday's 1-1 draw against nine-man Gent in Belgium but held his nerve on Sunday to end his early-season drought.

Play was then interrupted in the second half for roughly 20 minutes as objects rained down from the stands but Marseille equalised within a few minutes of the resumption when former Manchester City defender Rekik headed home from a corner. Christophe Jallet, on target at Gent four days earlier, nearly snatched all three points for Lyon late on but was denied by a fine reflex stop from Mandanda with Valbuena then fizzing a volley just wide.

Moroccan midfielder Adrien Regattin smashed home the opening goal Toulouse in the 23rd minute but a straight red card shown to Oscar Trejo with 13 minutes left hampered the visitors chances of holding on for maximum points. On Saturday, Edinson Cavani kept Paris Saint-Germain's unbeaten start to the season intact as he equalised late on at Reims in a 1-1 draw. Rennes, like Saint-Etienne, are also just one point back after coming from behind to draw 1-1 at home to Lille on Friday evening."

For Marseille, Imbula is the latest key player to quit the Velodrome since the south coast club's fourth-place finish last season.

His arrival has raised expectations for the Tigres, which will play in the semi-finals of South America's prestigious Copa Libertadores against Brazilian giants Internacional over two legs on July 15 and July 22.

Gignac chose Mexico over interest from French club Lyon, Turkish giants Galatasaray and English teams Newcastle United and West Bromwich Albion. Gignac played five years with Ligue 1 giants Marseille, scoring 21 goals in the season that recently ended. Marseille finished fourth, qualifying for the Europa League. While he has made 21 appearances for Euro 2016 hosts France, scoring five goals, he was not called up by coach Didier Deschamps for the team's recent international friendlies.

Reports say he will sign on a free transfer and agree a three-year deal worth around 4.5 million euros ($5.1m) a year with an option for a fourth season. The prolific attacker first made his mark during three seasons at Toulouse between 2007 and 2010, scoring 34 Ligue 1 goals, before moving to the Stade Velodrome where he netted another 59 in 154 Ligue 1 appearances. Several European clubs, including Lyon, Galatasaray, Newcastle United and West Bromich Albion were all in the frame to sign the striker but it now seems Gignac has opted for a move to Mexico.

""Not only football-wise, but I heard about the squad, how the players live together and the team spirit. ""So I thought it was great to come to Swansea because I know how positive it is here."" Ayew, who can also play in midfield, spent eight years at Marseille, scoring 52 goals in 181 games and contributing to French League Cup successes in 2011 and 2012. He has won 62 caps for Ghana and represented his country at the last two World Cups, as well as four editions of the Africa Cup of Nations. Ayew's father, Abedi Pele, was a three-time African Footballer of the Year and he has two brothers, Ibrahim and Jordan, who also play top-level football in Ghana and France respectively.

Worthy but unexpected quarter-finalists in the Champions League this season, third-placed Monaco have 68 points, just two ahead of Marseille and Saint-Etienne on 66, with Marseille also enjoying a comfortable goal difference margin on the other two. Monaco have been outstanding in Ligue 1 since December, losing just twice and conceding a miserly eight goals. Their 40-year-old Portuguese coach Leonardo Jardim has forged a water-tight defence and built an industrious, youthful counter-attacking system where 20-year-old midfielder Bernardo Silva and 19-year-old striker Anthony Martial are showing there is life after Falcao and James Rodriguez. ""We don't need to worry about anyone else, and we won't be listening to the other games"" said Jardim, who agreed a contract extension until 2019 last week. ""We just need to win our match, because Marseille and Saint Etienne are going to win theirs,"" said Jardim, who will be satisfied Lorient secured their top-flight status last week. Croatian 'keeper Danijel Subasic said the mood in the dressing room was relaxed and confident. ""I don't know if the other teams will win, but I hope not. Our game is like a final, it opens the doors to the Champions League,"" said Subasic, who has 19 clean shhets in Ligue 1 this season. Long-time leaders Marseille watched their title aspirations evaporate after Christmas and gradually the team led by intense Argentine coach Marcello Bielsa saw a run of poor luck allow their Champions League ambitions slip from their grasp too. But a 2-1 come-from-behind win over Monaco two weeks ago and a resounding 4-0 win over Lille last time out has given the southern giants one last roll of the dice. They host mid-table Bastia on Saturday with arguably two of their top forwards playing their last game for a club who are trying to get rid of their top paid players. The two concerned are Andre-Pierre Gignac, France's second-top scorer who propelled their early season charge, and Ghana's Andre Ayew who will be out of contract and on their way. ""I was expecting better,"" said the 25-year-old Ghana star Ayew. ""I wanted the team to be more competitive next year so we could challenge for the title."" ""Also the club cannot offer me the same salary that I'm on at the moment,"" added Ayew, son of former Ghana and Marseille legend Abedi Pele. Saint-Etienne have their own internal squabbles to deal with as they go into their match at home against Guingamp. Player-of-the season Max-Alain Gradel said this week the club lacked ambition, sending a shockwave from the top to bottom. ""It's not a lack of ambition that stops us rivalling PSG, just a lack of means,"" replied Christophe Galtier. His club have bought their training ground, rebuilt their stadium, bought back their club shop and opened a club museum over the past four years whilst coming in the top-five each time. Gradel was referring to the sale of Kurt Zouma to Chelsea, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Borussia Dortmund and Blaise Matuidi to PSG over the same period. But others remained focussed on the final game. ""We're not booking holidays yet in case we get the third spot, in which case we'll spend the summer getting ready,"" insisted 'keeper Stephane Ruffier, their joint player of the season."
182,18/05/2015,19:11,Ayew named Ligue 1 African player of the year,Ghana forward Andre Ayew celebrated his final days with Marseille by being named on Monday best African player in France's Ligue 1.,"Ayew, 25, finishes in front of Ivory Coast's Max Gradel (Saint-Etienne)and Tunisia's Aymen Abdennour (Monaco). The winger -- a member of the Ghana side that lost to Ivory Coast 9-8 on penalties in this year's Africa Cup of Nations final -- was picked by a jury of journalists and received the Marc-Vivien Foe Trophy handed out by French radio station RFI and TV channel France 24. ""I am very honoured to have received such a prize,"" said Ayew, whose father Marseille legend Abedi Pele was African footballer of the year three times. ""It's not just anything for an African player in France. France has had a lot of good African players. ""I have often been close to winning it and this year was the good one. It just proves I have to work even harder... Only work pays. ""It's been a good season. Maybe one of my best. I've improved a lot. I am happy but I can do better and work harder to improve even more."" Ayew, who played in both the 2010 and 2014 World Cup finals, said that next Saturday's match which will be his final one for Marseille after over a decade at the club would be very strange. ""Finishing third is important and the result against Bastia is important,"" said Ayew referring to Marseille's bid to take the final Champions League place on offer. ""But this game is not just any game for me. ""I don't know how to approach this. I didn't think this day would come, me leaving the Velodrome after 11 years at Marseille. ""I just want to skip Saturday. But that's life. The day is coming and I don't know what will happen. But I need to focus on this game."" Ayew, whose younger brother Jordan was also at Marseille before leaving for Lorient at the beginning of the season, has attracted interest from several English clubs including relegation-threatened Newcastle, a regular raider of Ligue 1, Tottenham, Arsenal and the club he idolised as a boy - Liverpool. His decision to leave is a mixture of Marseille not being able to meet his wage demands and a wish to seek a new challenge. ""The president (Vincent Labrune) has spoken thus everything has been brought out into the open more or less,"" said Ayew, who scored 10 goals in 27 appearances this season, after Saturday's win over Lille. ""I am going to leave the club and it is a page turned. ""There are lots of things behind the decision. We tried to find a solution which would enable me to stay but for both parties it was complicated, whether it be for sporting or financial reasons. ""I was expecting more, I hoped the club would have a more competitive team for next year that could be title contenders and that's not certain. ""Also the club cannot offer me the same salary that I'm on at the moment,"" added Ayew."
183,17/05/2015,12:11,Premier League on alert as Ayew confirms Marseille exit,Ghana international forward Andre Ayew moved a step closer to a dream move to the English Premier League after announcing he would be ending a 10 year stay at French giants Marseille.,"The 25-year-old winger -- a member of the Ghana side that lost to Ivory Coast 9-8 on penalties in this year's Africa Cup of Nations final -- said despite Marseille still being in contention for a Champions League place next term it wasn't enough for him. Ayew, whose younger brother Jordan was also at Marseille before leaving for Lorient at the beginning of the season, has attracted interest from several English clubs including relegation-threatened Newcastle, a regular raider of Ligue 1 for players, Spurs, Arsenal and the club he idolised as a boy Liverpool. ""The president (Vincent Labrune) has spoken thus everything has been brought out into the open more or less,"" said Ayew, who scored 10 goals in 27 appearances this season as Marseille enjoyed a superb first-half of the campaign and top the table before a series of poor results saw them fall off the pace. ""I am going to leave the club and it is a page turned. ""There are lots of thing behind the decision. We tried to find a solution which would enable me to stay but for both parties it was complicated, whether it be for sporting or financial reasons. ""I was expecting more, I wished that the club would have a more competitive team for next year that could be title contenders and that is not certain. ""Also the club cannot offer me the same salary that I'm on at the moment,"" added Ayew, son of former Ghana and Marseille legend Abedi Pele. Labrune said that the club simply could not offer the wages an English club could to Ayew, who came through the youth system at the club and became a key player for them in the past five years after returning from a loan spell with Arles-Avignon. ""We cannot keep Ayew,"" Labrune had told Wednesday's edition of English daily newspaper 'The Independent'. ""He is a very important player for Marseille but we cannot offer him the sums that the English clubs can. ""Unfortunately, he is going to leave the club and we hope he enjoys the great career he deserves in England or elsewhere."""
184,10/05/2015,23:55,Dramatic Marseille keep Euro hopes alive,Two late goals for Marseille kept their hopes of Champions League football next season alive with a 2-1 comeback win over Monaco in Sunday's late Ligue 1 match.,"It took the Principality side just one minute to take the lead after Joao Moutinho pounced on a defensive mistake. But Marseille hit back with 10 minutes to go as Andre Ayew headed home his ninth goal of the season before Romain Alessandrini secured the three points with just three minutes to play. Since coming back from the international break at the start of April, one-time leaders Marseille's title hopes have evaporated and their Champions League aspirations had nearly followed suit ahead of their first home win since January. The win sends Marseille back into fourth place, just two points behind their opponents of the night. ""As long as the Champions League qualification is still mathematically possible, we'll have faith and hope,"" Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa said. ""Our aim was to win this match but I've seen the table and we're third. Now we just have to take the points required to keep that place,"" Monaco's Leonardo Jardim explained. ""I feel we had a very good first half, we had four good chances to score more than one goal. Had we been more efficient, we'd have scored a second. We could have won that game."" Monaco had opted for a defensive formation with former Chelsea defender Ricardo Carvalho moving up in midfield alongside Geoffrey Kondogbia to replace captain Jeremy Toulalan, who is just back from injury and started on the bench. Bielsa wanted his Marseille side to bombard the visitors early on and gave Romain Alessandrini the nod ahead of struggling Florian Thauvin while defender Rod Fanni was also benched. But Monaco were the ones on the front foot from the off with Portugal midfielder Moutinho scoring after just 50 seconds. This perfect start stunned Marseille as it took them 25 minutes to react through an Alessandrini strike, slightly deflected by Aymen Abdennour, that didn't worry 'keeper Danijel Subasic. Monaco gained confidence and Fabinho tested Steve Mandanda from a distance before Bernardo Silva found the post, following a Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco run inside the box just before half-time. The second half, however, changed everything as Marseille fought back as Dimitri Payet and Thauvin piled on the pressure. But it was Ayew who levelled with a powerful header following a good run by Payet on the left before the French international delivered his 15th assist of the season for Alessandrini. It was Monaco's first league loss since a 1-0 defeat at Guingamp in early February, and they remain third, two points ahead of Marseille and Saint-Etienne. Earlier on Sunday, Saint-Etienne moved closer to Champions League football with a 5-0 drubbing of Nice in Ligue 1. Goals from Loic Perrin, Jeremy Clement, Mevlut Erding, Max-Alain Gradel and Kevin Monnet-Paquet allowed Saint-Etienne to remain joint fourth with Marseille on 63 points but behind on goal difference. Montpellier, the 2012 champions, also kept their Europa League chances alive with a last-gap 1-0 win at Lens. Montpellier remain seventh in the table with two games left but are only three points adrift of Bordeaux in sixth, which will be good enough to qualify for next season's Europa League as long as Paris Saint-Germain beat second-tier Auxerre in the French Cup final later this month. PSG's 6-0 hammering of Guingamp on Friday, coupled with nearest rivals Lyon's 3-0 capitulation at Caen on Saturday, means the capital club are now on the brink of winning a third successive Ligue 1 title. Paris are six points clear of Lyon with two games left so need just a point away to Montpellier next weekend to take the crown."
185,01/05/2015,22:54,Gignac the centurion inspires Marseille,Andre-Pierre Gignac's double fired Marseille to a 2-0 win over relegation-bound Metz on Friday to boost the south coast giants' prospects of competing in next season's Champions League.,"Gignac, out of contract at the end of the season, celebrated his 100th goal in the French top flight as the first half was drawing to a close, and then made inroads into his second century after the break. Marseille had travelled north desperate to put a stop to a four-match losing streak. And this timely change in fortunes moved them provisionally above Saint-Etienne on goal difference into fourth on 60 points, two points shy of Monaco occupying the third and final Champions League spot. Coach Marcelo Bielsa was a relieved man, the Argentine declaring: ""It was really necessary to win here. ""While it's still mathematically possible we'll retain hope of making third place."" Seen as potential champions as recently as Christmas, Marseille's Ligue 1 meltdown has been so dramatic even lowly Metz were fancying their chances in this Friday night showdown. But Gignac, who on a busy night also picked up a yellow card for elbowing Metz defender Jeremy Choplin, put paid to that notion in some style. The in-form international striker had the visitors in control when pouncing on a mistake by Metz keeper Anthony Mfa who dropped the ball he'd caught safely with both hands off a corner after colliding with Metz defender Jose Luis Palomino. A bungled attempt by Metz to avert the resulting danger ended up with Gignac turning deftly to shoot into an open goal with seven minutes of the first half to go. He doubled up after the hour, Dimitri Payet the provider, to give Marseille renewed hope of a top three finish. Bielsa's decision to start the 29-year-old in preference to the young Belgian Michy Batshuayi had paid off handsomely. For Metz this latest loss at their Stade Saint-Symphorien left them second from bottom and almost certain to be relegated to Ligue 2. Paris Saint-Germain, who beat Metz 3-1 on Tuesday to go three points clear at the top, face Nantes on Sunday, with their closest rivals Lyon up against Evian."

187,30/04/2015,11:17,Knives out for free-fall Marseille,"Seen as potential champions as recently as Christmas, Marseille's Ligue 1 meltdown has been so dramatic even second-bottom Metz fancy their chances for their showdown on Friday.","Desperate for a win themselves Metz coach Albert Cartier explained this week why he thought Marseille, on a run of four league defeats, were there for the taking again. ""They're a team who attack and who are in real need of a win, us too, so against Marseille it'll be an open game,"" he explained. Marseille travel north to Metz with just four games left of a season that is turning into a gut-wrenching disappointment for everyone at the club. After their humiliating 5-3 home defeat in a wild match to relegation-threatened Lorient last week Marseille's club president spoke openly of a season gone to terrible waste. ""That looked like collective suicide,"" OM president Vincent Labrune said. ""We need to find some self-respect, some pride, only this way can we win our last four games and avoid this season becoming a dreadful waste,"" he added. In the close season Labrune recruited the Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa, whose peculiar coaching style and tendency to crank up the pressure saw the club top the table going into the winter break, and top it in swashbuckling style spearheaded by striker Andre-Pierre Gignac, who has 18 league goals this season. Fourteen games later however they now trail Monaco in the third Champions League spot by five points, and tellingly are a full 11 behind Lyon, and a massive 14 adrift of leaders Paris Saint Germain. Marseille forward Dimitri Payet strenuously denied that Bielsa had lost the belief of the dressing room. ""I'm not having that. It's thanks to him that we were in a position to win the title in the first place,"" insisted the 28-year-old Bielsa stalwart who has started 31 league games this term. Instead the France international said Champions League football is still an objective. ""We can't wait for this match."" ""We want to show everyone this series of results was a kind of accident,"" he explained. Metz are in a far worse predicament than Marseille with four games left, three at home and one at Monaco, they are eight points behind a safety spot. Leaders Paris Saint-Germain are in action in Sunday's late game where they travel to Nantes in focussed pursuit of a domestic treble."
188,20/04/2015,21:36,French giants end stand-off with Canal Plus,Players and coaches from French champions Paris Saint Germain and bitter rivals Marseille will reply to questions posed by journalists from French television channel Canal Plus after ending a 10-day boycott on Monday.,"PSG, in Barcelona for Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg match in which they trail 3-1, issued a statement saying they were satisfied the French league authorities had moved to restrict Canal Plus in what post-match images they would be able to shoot in the players tunnel. ""The strong position taken by (The French Professional League) president Frederic Thiriez in favouring changes for next season in the filming of players on their way back to the changing rooms constitutes a genuine advance for all professional clubs,"" the statement read. ""In the spirit of conciliation, as the end of the season promises to be highly-charged right up to the climax, we have decided to suspend our decision (to boycott) but we will remain vigilant in protecting our players and the manner in which they are filmed."" Marseille said they had held constructive talks with senior figures from Canal Plus over the past few days and that significant progress had been made. The two clubs had been furious over how two of their stars, Zlatan Ibrahimovic of PSG and Marseille's Dimitri Payet, had been held to account by the league after being caught on camera. Ibrahimovic was suspended for four games after he was filmed delivering an expletive-laden rant against referees and France after his side lost at Bordeaux. Payet was banned for two matches for shouting at the referee's room that Marseille had been ""screwed"" after a goal was disallowed in their 0-0 draw with title rivals Lyon. Both subsequently had their bans reduced by one game."
189,17/04/2015,22:48,Marseille suffer new setback,Marseille's slump continued on Friday as Marcelo Bielsa's side went down to a 1-0 defeat at Nantes that further damaged their hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League.,"Serge Gakpe scored the only goal of the game in the 20th minute at a packed Stade de la Beaujoire following a defensive mix-up as Nantes claimed a win that moves them a step closer to securing top-flight survival. But Marseille, after losing to Paris Saint-Germain and Bordeaux in the last fortnight, racked up a third consecutive defeat, their worst sequence of results in Ligue 1 since October 2013. As a consequence, OM remain in fourth place, a point behind Monaco in the third and final qualifying berth for next season's Champions League. Indeed, they could end the weekend in fifth if Saint-Etienne win at leaders Lyon on Sunday evening. ""Things are going against us but we need to lift our heads now and turn things around,"" defender Nicolas Nkoulou told beIN Sports. ""It is a delicate and difficult time but there are still games to play. We have to look forward now, that's all."" Bielsa claimed this week that his side remained the best team in the country, but from being top of the table at Christmas, Marseille have won just four times in 14 league games in 2015. Against Nantes, they were without suspended playmaker Dimitri Payet so Michy Batshuayi started just behind Andre-Pierre Gignac, who was continuing his search for his 100th Ligue 1 goal. However, Batshuayi missed one great chance in the first half, blazing over after Remy Riou had pushed out a low Brice Dja Djedje cross, while he also had a goal disallowed for offside. By that time Nantes were already in front. A team that had scored just six times in 13 matches in 2015 clearly needed a hand when it came to putting the ball in the net and that is exactly what happened 20 minutes in. There appeared to be little danger when OM goalkeeper Steve Mandanda played a square pass across his box to Rod Fanni. However, Fanni caught his 'keeper out by giving him a first-time pass back. Mandanda slipped and Gakpe was left with an easy finish. Franck Ribery and Samir Nasri played the last time Marseille won in Nantes, in April 2006, and they were unable to find a way back into the game in the second half. There was a late rally, but Andre Ayew was booked for diving in the box as the visitors appealed in vain for a penalty. Then, in the third minute of stoppage time, Fanni thought he had made up for his earlier error when he headed towards goal, but Riou intervened with a superb save, tipping the ball onto the bar. Lyon are two points clear at the top from Paris Saint-Germain, who go to Nice on Saturday licking their wounds after their 3-1 Champions League quarter-final first-leg defeat to Barcelona in midweek. Monaco can strengthen their grip on third by beating Rennes on Saturday before they look to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit when they host Juventus in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final next week."
190,16/04/2015,13:07,Marseille cling to Champions League target,"Having long set the pace in France's Ligue 1, Marseille travel to Nantes on Friday with reduced ambitions of an eventual third place finish to make the Champions League cut.","Defeats to champions Paris Saint-Germain and Bordeaux in their previous two matches have seen them slip seven points adrift of leaders Lyon on 64, while Paris have 62 in second and Monaco are third on 58. ""Coming in the top two is now unlikely,"" said Marseille's left-sided player Romain Alessandrini. ""But with six games to go there are 18 points to play for."" Marseille have been on very poor form indeed since going into the winter break top of the table, and some might suggest they look over their shoulder at Saint-Etienne just a point behind them or Bordeaux, who trail by three. Monaco for example have gained ten points on Marseille since New Year. Nantes for their part need points to avoid getting sucked into a relegation battle, and while their attack is one of the worst in the league they have a solid backline. ""It's the sixth best defence in Ligue 1, they're difficult to knock off their game,"" suggested Marseille boss Marcelo Bielsa, whose stated objective at the start of the season was for Marseille to make the Champions League. ""I would dearly love to finish the season second or third,"" he said in midweek when mulling his future at the club. His opposite number Michel Der Zakarian was worried about his side's finishing: ""We need to be better in the final third,"" he admitted. ""We need to get past players, get good crosses in and get people in the right position to finish."" One man who looks able to finish is breakthrough Belgian striker Michy Batshuayi, who will be in the starting line for Marseille in place of Dimitri Payet, who is suspended for two games for insulting referees."
191,15/04/2015,16:41,Under-pressure Bielsa gets Marseille owner backing,Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa said Wednesday the club's owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus had asked him to continue in his job next season.,"""She told me she wants me to carry on next season. More importantly for me she praised my personal qualities and the way I lead the squad,"" said the Argentine, who can activate a get out clause at the end of his first season with Marseille. The club went into the winter break as Ligue 1 leaders, but after a loss at Bordeaux last weekend dropped to fourth, five points off leaders Paris Saint-Germain, but only one point off Monaco in the third Champions League place. ""We coaches know and understand that when we fail to achieve our objectives there is a price to pay."" Bielsa's publicly stated objective at the start of the season was for Marseille to make the Champions League. ""I shall try and live up to Margarita Louis-Dreyfus's high praise, I would dearly love to finish the season second or third,"" he said. Known as 'el loco' (the Madman) because of his high-tension push-it-to-the-limit methods, Bielsa confirmed that while he had received the owner's backing, he had not been handed a fresh offer. ""Asking me not to leave is not the same as offering me a new contract,"" he pointed out. The manager then praised his team describing them as the team of the season so far. ""I shouldn't say this, but if the championship ended today the best team would be Marseille. We played the best football."" Marseille go to Nantes on Friday with six league games remaining."
192,15/04/2015,02:30,Top French clubs boycott TV over incriminating film,Top French clubs Paris Saint Germain and Marseille are boycotting a leading French broadcaster for showing film of incidents which led to bans for star players Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Dimitri Payet.,"Both were punished for tirades aimed at referees which were shown by Canal Plus. As a reprisal, PSG and Marseille say they will not answer the station's questions after games or at press conferences until the end of the season. Paris coach Laurent Blanc rejected a question from Canal Plus after Saturday's League Cup final win over Bastia. The channel attended Blanc's press conference Tuesday ahead of PSG's Champions League quarter final clash against Barcelona, but it did not try to ask a question. Paris are furious at a four match ban imposed after Canal Plus pictures showed Swedish star Ibrahimovic in an expletive-laden rant against referees and France after his side lost at Bordeaux. French international Payet was banned for two matches for shouting at the referees room that Marseille had been ""screwed"" after a goal was disallowed in their 0-0 draw with title rivals Lyon. Again it was shown by the subscription broadcaster which, with BeIn Sport, has the rights to show French league games. France's two most popular clubs said in a statement they ""do not want to take the risk of being open to new sanctions linked to unfortunate comments provoked by a controversial refereeing decision."" They added that ""the number of Canal Plus group cameras and microphones that surround the teams in all circumstances, and the possibility of a retroactive judgement after the showing of images used as proof by football judges lead us to adopt this very great caution."" Canal Plus deputy director general Maxime Saada told AFP that the channel had become a ""hostage"" between the clubs and league disciplinary judges because of film taken around the Ligue 1 matches. He said this was ""stopping our teams of journalists from carrying out their jobs."" Saada said that Canal Plus was a ""respectful partner"" of French clubs and wants only to show ""the spectacle of Ligue 1 and its 20 clubs in its totality."" The channel currently pays 420 million euros ($448 million) a year to show French matches and from 2016 this will rise to 540 million euros a year. Despite Canal Plus protests, French clubs have been showing increasing mistrust of the channel. According to media reports, the Professional Football League planned to send Canal Plus an official letter warning it to stick to their contract. Under the deal between the broadcaster and the clubs, it promises ""not to promote scenes contrary to the image of football"" and ""to give a positive image of football putting the emphasis on beautiful gestures and the beautiful game."" League officials have indicated that if Canal Plus does not change its ways it could be stopped from filming off the pitch. Some clubs also feel they get a more critical treatment from Canal Plus than from the rival BeIn Sport, representatives told AFP. But Lyon coach Hubert Fournier said television channels should not be ""falsely accused"" for the actions of players. ""From the moment you accept them (TV cameras) in these mixed zones, it is for the actors to be conscious of their comments and actions to avoid this kind of scandal,"" said Fournier. The French government's Secretary of State for Sport Thierry Braillard said he was ""profoundly surprised and disappointed"" at the decision of Paris and Marseille."

In a game dominated by the visitors, Michy Batshuayi had the ball in the back of the Bordeaux net with 15 minutes left but the young Belgium forward's effort was correctly flagged for offside. Marseille have not triumphed at the Stade Chaban-Delmas since 1977 and have picked up just four victories in 51 attempts against Les Girondins in the top flight. With six games to go, the south coast side find themselves five points behind leaders PSG and four adrift of second-placed Lyon, with both teams having a game in hand. ""We're in an uncomfortable situation,"" said Marseille coach Marcelon Bielsa. ""But we retain the strength to change that and we hope that our league table position will be what we deserve. We will fight for every point. ""Obviously we did not expect this slip-up and I don't think we deserve to be out of the top three now."" Bordeaux now sit on sixth and are in contention to qualify for the Europa League with their fourth win in the past five games. Earlier Sunday, there was a hint of nostalgia in Ligue 1 as Saint-Etienne beat Nantes 1-0, the two clubs having won 15 league titles between them in a 20-year stretch up to the early 1980's. On an afternoon of glorious sunshine, thousands of fans went bare-chested in the stands at a packed and boisterous Geoffroy-Guichard stadium, where Franck Tabanou's thunderbolt free kick on 18 minutes was enough to give three precious points to Europe-chasing Saint-Etienne. Between 1964 and 1983, the two clubs won 15 titles between them, nine going to Saint Etienne (Marseille and Monaco got two each and Strasbourg the other), as they dominated the French scene. Saint-Etienne are currently fifth and eyeing Europa League qualification, but to avoid disruptive early qualifying rounds in August they are targeting a fourth-place finish, which they also managed last season. Sunday's win also helped them get over the disappointment of Wednesday's 4-1 defeat to PSG in the French Cup semi-finals. Nantes, for their part, have re-established themselves as a mid-table side after promotion two seasons ago, their last French title coming in 2001. Monaco beat Caen on Friday to climb up to third on 58 points, holding onto the third and final Champions League qualifying spot. French football is on something of a high right now with Paris hosting Barcelona on Wednesday in a glamour Champions League quarter-final first-leg after a 'generational' victory over Chelsea in the last-16. Meanwhile, Monaco are also in the last eight and travel to Italian giants Juventus on Tuesday in confident mood having won their last four away games in Ligue 1 and beating Arsenal in the last round. PSG's defence of their League Cup title on Saturday, which featured doubles from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani, means their League game with Metz, originally scheduled for this weekend, will now be played on April 28th, while Lyon's game with Bastia will be played this Wednesday. Elsewhere on Sunday the 19-year-old rookie striker Said Benrahma's 4th minute strike was enough to give Nice a 1-0 at Reims, while Lille grabbed a 1-0 win at Evian after a generously awarded penalty, converted by Sofiane Boufal. Relegation-threatened Toulouse won 1-0 at home over Montpellier, bottom side Lens slugged out a 0-0 draw with Lorient while in the Brittany derby Rennes beat 10-man Guingamp 1-0."

PSG's defence of their League Cup title on Saturday, which featured doubles from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani, means their League game with Metz, originally scheduled for this weekend, will now be played on April 28th, while Lyon's game with Bastia will be played this Wednesday. Elsewhere on Sunday the 19-year-old rookie striker Said Benrahma's 4th minute strike was enough to give Nice a 1-0 at Reims, while Lille grabbed a 1-0 win at Evian after a generously awarded penalty, converted by Sofiane Boufal. Relegation-threatened Toulouse won 1-0 at home over Montpellier, bottom side Lens slugged out a 0-0 draw with Lorient while in the Brittany derby Rennes beat 10-man Guingamp 1-0."
195,08/04/2015,18:16,Fans to appear in court after Marseille-PSG match trouble,"Four fans arrested after violence during last weekend's Ligue 1 clash between Marseille and Paris Saint-Germain have been ordered to appear in court in the southern city, legal sources said Wednesday.","One supporter is accused of throwing a smoke bomb, while the others face public order offences after fans clashed with riot police outside the Stade Velodrome last Sunday. A date for their court appearance has not yet been set. Officers used tear gas to disperse troublemakers after some supporters tried to block traffic near the stadium, a police spokesman told AFP. A bus carrying PSG players to the Velodrome was struck by objects thrown, including a golf ball which smashed a window. PSG reclaimed top spot in the French Ligue 1 from Lyon after beating third-placed Marseille 3-2. Some 65,000 spectators packed into the Velodrome for the match dubbed 'Le Classique'."
196,06/04/2015,00:02,PSG beat Marseille to reclaim Ligue 1 summit,Paris Saint-Germain must now be considered favourites to win a third consecutive Ligue 1 title after coming from behind to beat fierce enemies Marseille 3-2 in 'Le Classique' at the Stade Velodrome on Sunday.,"Marseille held a 2-1 lead at the interval thanks to Andre-Pierre Gignac's brace either side of a Blaise Matuidi beauty, but two goals in the first six minutes of the second half swung the match decisively in the capital club's favour. Marquinhos equalised and then Jeremy Morel's own goal in the 51st minute allowed PSG to claim a seventh consecutive victory against OM in all competitions as Laurent Blanc's side moved back to the top of the table, a point above Lyon. ""Unfortunately tonight (Sunday), we lost two players which is worrying for the upcoming matches,"" Matuidi told Canal Plus tv in reference to injuries picked up by David Luiz and Thiago Motta. ""Overall, we played a great match but it wasn't easy against a good Marseille team, but I think the best team won. ""It's up to us to fight to the end and we'll do everything to win a maximum of trophies,"" added Matuidi with PSG in the hunt for the league title, Champions League, French Cup and League Cup. PSG coach Laurent Blanc was happy with the win but disappointed with the injuries. ""We'll savour the victory but we paid an expensive price because we lost two players. That is a problem but we are very happy to have won here at Marseille,"" said the former Bordeaux and France coach. ""To have won is a very, very good job done tonight (Sunday). (Blaise) Matuidi was amazing with his physical game and he worked hard this week to try and score a goal because we were winding him up a bit. ""He hasn't had much success in front of goal,"" added the former Marseille defender. Marseille are now five points off top spot in third, which will surely prove fatal to their title chances. Not only that, but Bielsa's team -- who had Andre Ayew red-carded after the final whistle -- are hanging onto the third and final Champions League qualifying berth, with fourth-placed Monaco only three points behind with a game in hand. There was an intimidating environment for Paris, whose team bus was struck by missiles -- including a golf ball that smashed a window -- en route to the ground. It was Marseille who opened the scoring on the half-hour mark, Gignac switching the play to Dimitri Payet on the right and then outmuscling Marquinhos to head home his team-mate's cross at the back post. When Paris lost David Luiz to a hamstring injury, it looked like it would not be their night, but Matuidi silenced the Velodrome in the 35th minute with a magnificent curling strike into the far top corner of the net on his weaker right foot. However, Marseille reclaimed the lead two minutes before the interval. Alaixys Romao hounded Pastore out of possession in midfield and suddenly Gignac found himself through on goal with just Salvatore Sirigu to beat. His finish for his 18th goal of the season was cool, and the home support greeted the half-time whistle as though they had won the game. But PSG drew level on 49 minutes, Marquinhos firing into the roof of the net after a Zlatan Ibrahimovic free-kick struck Rod Fanni inside the box and broke to the Brazilian defender. And two minutes after that they scored again, Morel turning a Pastore ball from the left into his own net under pressure from Ibrahimovic. They are in pole position with seven games of the season remaining, although they saw Thiago Motta limp off injured late on and Lyon remain very much in contention after winning 3-1 at Guingamp on Saturday. Monaco came from behind to draw 1-1 with Saint-Etienne on Friday, and while they have a game in hand to play against Montpellier on Tuesday, their sole focus now is on securing a top-three finish. Elsewhere on Sunday, an injury-time goal by substitute Nicolas Maurice-Belay gave Bordeaux a 2-1 home victory against relegation-threatened Lens. Mariano had given Bordeaux the lead only for Pablo Chavarria to equalise for the visitors, who are bottom. Caen moved six points clear of the relegation zone after coming from behind to win 2-1 at Nantes. Alejandro Bedoya put the Canaries ahead early on but Emiliano Sala levelled with a penalty 10 minutes from time and a Thomas Lemar free-kick evaded everyone to end up in the net in stoppage time as the Normandy side claimed a first win in four."
197,22/03/2015,23:16,Marseille keep tabs on PSG after Lens romp,Marseille thumped Lens 4-0 on Sunday to close the gap on Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain back to just two points.,"Michy Batshuayi came off the bench to break the deadlock before Lens collapsed late on, with the Belgian adding a second -- taking his tally to six goals in his last four games -- while Alaixys Romao and Andre Ayew also netted. Playing at home in the Stade de France national stadium in Paris, relegation candidates Lens had managed to keep Marcelo Bielsa's men at bay for 45 minutes. Such was there stubborn resistence that France international striker Andre-Pierre Gignac was even taken off at half time for in-form Batshuayi. Yet within 37 seconds of coming on, the young Belgian tapped the ball in from two yards out, following a Dimitri Payet cross. In a poor first half, midfielder Payet was a rare spark for Marseille. But it was Batshuayi who stole the limelight with his seventh goal of the season, the third time this season he scored after coming off the bench. The 21-year old could have doubled his tally on 56 minutes but his deft strike was correctly ruled out for offside. In the 67th minute, Togo talisman Romao pounced on a deflected Payet free kick to add a second goal, leaving Lens with an uphill battle to grind out anything from the game. Five minutes later, though, Ghana midfielder Ayew found himself on the end of a Benjamin Mendy cross to seal the three points for OM. In injury time, Batshuayi bagged his second -- notching a third brace in four games -- with a clinical finish after a mazy Ayew run. Marseille moved to within a point of second-placed Lyon and two off PSG, maintain Ligue 1's three-way battle of nerves with just eight games to go. Lens, on the other hand, have their own worries at the other end of the table as they are firmly in the relegation zone, nine points behind 17th-placed Lorient in the last position of safety. Earlier on Sunday, Monaco cruised past strugglers Reims 3-1 to reclaim fourth place in the table. The Principality side leapfrogged Saint-Etienne, who were temporarily lifted to fourth earlier following a 2-0 win over Lille. ""My team forgot about the Champions League very quickly and managed 20 minutes of real quality. We scored twice in those first 20 minutes. Our opponents then responded,"" Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim said. ""We showed we could offer some attacking football. The players play together and that's very important. ""The team is improving: after a rough start of the season, everyone worked hard to get there. The victory is very important for us ahead of the international break."" PSG went top of Ligue 1 for the first time this season after title-rivals Lyon lost 2-1 at home to ten-man Nice on Saturday. The Parisians beat Lorient 3-1 on Friday thanks to a hat-trick from giant Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic."
198,19/03/2015,15:21,Lyon eye Marseille forward Gignac,"Ligue 1 leaders Lyon launched an all-out charm offensive on France and Marseille's Andre-Pierre Gignac Thursday, as both the club's president and coach admitted interest in signing the forward in June.","""I really like Gignac. He is Marseille's best player,"" president Jean-Michel Aulas told 'Le Phoceen', a website that focuses on Marseille news. ""I know his contract ends in June, of course. If we had the top two French goalscorers in the same club, it would be interesting, don't you think?"" he added. ""I don't know if we can sign him but, if we have the chance of playing the Champions League, having Gignac and (Alexandre) Lacazette up front alongside (Nabil) Fekir, I don't think we could do better."" Coach Hubert Fournier also had positive things to say about Gignac. ""His contract situation could be a great opportunity. Especially as, if we qualify for the Champions League, we won't be the richest. He's a possible lead for us, among others,"" Fournier confessed. Gignac, 29, is second in the Ligue 1 scoring charts behind Lacazette but ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, having found the back of the net 16 times for Marseille this season."
199,17/03/2015,13:24,French international adds to referee insult storm,French international Dmitri Payet has been caught on film insulting referees adding to a mounting storm over the treatment of match officials after Zlatan Ibrahimovic's tirade this weekend.,"The Marseille midfielder vented his anger at the referee after his title challenging side were held to a 0-0 draw by leaders Lyon in Sunday's match when Payet's side had a goal disallowed. ""We were screwed, arsehole!"" Payet is heard shouting at the referee's dressing room in a film broadcast by Canal Plus Sport late Monday. The referee and his assistants are seen returning to their room moments later surrounded by Marseille coaching staff protesting that ""the ball was over by a metre."" Marseille thought they had a goal when Lucas Ocampos bundled Payet's 83rd-minute corner towards the line. But referee Benoit Bastien and his assistants ruled that the ball did not cross. After the game, Payet told reporters that Marseille ""lost two points because of a refereeing decision"" and that the team was ""completely disgusted"". ""We did what we had to. We feel we are being punished in the race for the title and we are powerless. You can say all you want, (but) if you say too much you risk the disciplinary commission."" French football is still abuzz with discussion over Paris Saint-Germain star Zlatan Ibrahimovic's outburst Sunday against a referee after his side lost to Bordeaux. He also called the match official an ""arsehole"" and said that France was ""a shit country."" Despite his apologies the Ibrahimovic comments brought widespread protests from the referees' union. Even Prime Minister Manuel Valls said he was ""shocked"". Far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen said Ibrahimovic should leave France. The comments by the 33-year-old Swedish international will be considered by a league disciplinary committee on Thursday."
200,06/03/2015,23:53,Marseille back with a bang in French title race,Marseille's swashbuckling 6-1 away win at Toulouse on Friday put them firmly back in the Ligue 1 title race after coach Marcelo Bielsa rang the changes.,"Lyon top the French league on 54 points but Marseille moved into second, ahead of Paris Saint Germain on goal difference on 53 points. Bielsa noted: ""This isn't a direct message to Lyon or Paris, above all it's important for us. Scoring so many goals gives us confidence."" Paris host lowly Lens on Saturday ahead of their Champions League showdown with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge next Wednesday, while leaders Lyon travel to in-form Montpellier on Sunday. Bielsa had benched his brooding star striker Andre-Pierre Gignac and his young replacement the 21-year-old Belgian Michy Batshuayi scored twice, his second brace in three games. He was the battering ram who led a breathtaking charge that saw OM lead 4-0 at half-time, his brace, a Baptiste Aloe poke and an own goal sank Toulouse before the break. Toulouse's star man Wissam Ben Yedder grabbed a goal with the score at 4-0, while Marseille's relentless Andre Ayew (78) and Gignac (89), on as a substitute, scored fine goals in the second-half. It was a real night to remember for Marseille, who hadn't won away in Ligue 1 since early October. Batshuayi's sumptuous opener came in only the second minute, as he twisted on the edge of the box to beat three defenders and finish with a stunning low drive into the bottom corner. Defender Aloe's poke from around the penalty spot could easily have been ruled off-side due to Andre Ayew. Ghana's Ayew then sent in a cross that Lucas Ocampos claimed as he turned away, but he'd actually pressured defender Francois Moubandje into turning the ball into his own goal to make it 3-0 after only twenty minutes. Batshuayi then tapped home late in the first-half after Dimitri Payet stormed a full fifty yards before a deft pass to Ocampos, who provided the assist, ripped Toulouse's defence wide open. Ocampos was another of Bielsa's changes as the off-form young French hope Florian Thauvin also had started on the bench before coming on for Ayew late on. The defeat left struggling Toulouse third from bottom."
201,27/02/2015,22:54,Marseille in dramatic collapse against in-form Caen,Marseille collapsed dramatically from a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 to Caen at the Stade Velodrome on Friday in a result that kept Marcelo Bielsa's side in third place in Ligue 1.,"Andre Ayew and Andre-Pierre Gignac seemed to have sealed the deal for the south coast giants but Caen proved once again they were not to be understimated. Goals from Nicolas Seube and Emiliano Sala, three minutes apart, and Nicolas Benezet's winner four minutes from time extended the Normandy giantkillers' run to seven. The sensational defeat came at the end of a difficult week for OM with speculation over Bielsa's future at the Velodrome and reports of a clash between the Argentine coach and striker Andre-Pierre Gignac. The France forward was benched but his replacement Michy Batshuayi, who scored a brace as a substitute last weekend in the 2-2 draw with St Etienne, failed to score. The young Belgian even missed a penalty, just two minutes into the game when Remy Vercoutre dived to his right to prevent Batshuayi from opening the scoring. Two minutes into first half stoppage time, Payet inherited a good ball from Benjamin Mendy. Just outside the box, the French international unleashed a powerful strike that Vercoutre could only deflect into Ayew's path. Gignac added a 15th goal to his Ligue 1 tally from close range, just three minutes after coming off the bench on the hour mark. But Caen then pulled one back via Seube in the 67th minute. And they were level three minutes later when Sala won his one-on-one against Mandanda. But the best was yet to come. Under pressure, Caen resorted to counter-attacks, a tactic that proved effective when Benezet beat Brice Dja Djedje to sink a wonderful strike in the top right corner with just four minutes to go. Marseille stay third, two points behind second-placed Paris Saint-Germain and four behind leaders Lyon, who both now have a game in hand. On Saturday, Lyon travel to lacklustre Lille. In a late Sunday game, PSG face a tough challenge as they head to fourth-placed Monaco, fresh from their stunning 3-1 defeat at Arsenal in the Champions League."
202,13/02/2015,22:33,Ngog denies Marseille top spot in France,David Ngog scored an injury-time equaliser to earn Reims a 2-2 draw and deny Marseille top spot in Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Earlier Jordan Ayew had seemed set to begin the healing process from his Africa Cup of Nations heartbreak as his goal gave the hosts a 2-1 lead at the Stade Velodrome. But former Liverpool striker Ngog came off the bench to pounce late on for Reims, who remain in mid-table, and snatch a deserved share of the spoils. Ayew had lashed home 21 minutes from time from less than a yard out after Andre-Pierre Gignac had completely missed an attempt at an acrobatic volley inside the six-yard box, which nonetheless helped to deceive goalkeeper Kossi Agassa. The Ghana forward's goal came just five days after his country's dramatic penalty shoot-out defeat to Ivory Coast at the Cup of Nations final in Equatorial Guinea. Ghana had even led the shoot-out 2-0 at one point before cracking within touching distance of lifting the cup for the first time since 1982. A disjointed Marseille performance at the Stade Velodrome saw them fail to overhaul leaders Lyon, who travel to lowly Lorient on Sunday, and left them a point behind and a point ahead of champions Paris Saint-Germain, who entertain Caen on Saturday. Nicolas de Preville had given Reims a sixth-minute lead on the south coast, but Dimitri Payet's heavily deflected shot restored parity just before the hour mark. Ayew's goal came from a corner that caused panic in the Reims box with Agassa's athletic reaction to Gignac's point-blank attempted volley clearing the path for the Ghanaian to tap into an empty net. Marseille were warned moments later as Reims almost snatched an equaliser. First home goalkeeper Steve Mandanda made a stunning reaction stop from close range to deny Prince Oniangue's diving header before Gaetan Charbonnier crashed the follow up against the bar. Yet Ngog ensured Reims would not be denied."
203,07/02/2015,18:27,Marseille squander chance to go top,Marseille stretched their undefeated run at Rennes to seven games on Saturday but a laboured 1-1 draw meant they squandered the chance to go top in France.,"Marcelo Bielsa's side are one point behind leaders Lyon who tackle champions and third-placed Paris Saint Germain in the weekend's standout fixture on Sunday. In a depressing summary of Marseille's afternoon, they finished the game in Brittany with 10 men after Mario Lemina was red-carded for a foul on Ola Toivonen. Swedish striker Toivonen was a thorn in Marseille's side all afternoon. The 28-year-old gave Rennes the lead after 26 minutes, smartly chesting down a loose ball to score past Steve Mandanda in the visitors' goal. Marseille were saved when Lucas Ocampos, the Argentine signed on loan from Monaco in the last moments of the transfer window, found the net in the 59th minute after coming on as a half-time substitute. The winger was handily placed to score from a corner taken by Dimitri Payet."
204,31/01/2015,18:39,Marseille dig deep to keep pressure on PSG and Lyon,A single point separates the top three teams in Ligue 1 after Marseille climbed back to second with a hard-fought 1-0 home win over plucky Evian on Saturday.,"The victory was secured when Andre-Pierre Gignac converted a 49th minute penalty, for his 14th goal of the season, after referee Frank Schneider awarded Marseille a controversial spot-kick when Dimitri Payet took a slight knock in the box. Lyon are still top on 48 points ahead of their plum clash with resurgent Monaco on Sunday, but Marseille, who lead Paris Saint-Germain on goal difference and who beat Rennes 1-0 on Friday, are breathing down their necks on 47 points. Marseille lost their south coast derby at Nice last weekend and had been tipped to rip Evian to pieces at the Velodrome, and although they were rampant at times, Evian's work-rate stifled them for long periods. Young French hope Florian Thauvin had a Marseille goal disallowed for a harsh off-side decision against his strike partner Gignac while Payet saw his sumptuous long-range shot sail inches over the Evian bar. But the visitors were also denied what appeared to be a certain penalty early in the match. On Friday Ezequiel Lavezzi scored the only goal as champions Paris Saint-Germain edged Rennes 1-0 rounding off a fabulous piece of teamwork from the capital outfit. The goal came on 29 minutes after a neat interchange of passes down the left between Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was involved twice, Adrien Rabiot and Javier Pastore. This maintained their unbeaten Ligue 1 home record and more importantly cut the gap on leaders Lyon to just one point. The win was PSG's sixth consecutive home win in all competitions while stretching their Ligue 1 record at the Parc des Princes to eight wins and three draws. However, Lyon, who face PSG in ten days, can restore their four-point lead with victory at Monaco on Sunday. The match at the Louis II stadium on the Cote d'Azur promises fireworks with Lyon and Monaco, the two in-form teams in the top flight. Lyon are riding a seven-match winning streak while Monaco haven't tasted defeat in seven games with both teams' defences proving especially frugal. Monaco haven't conceded a goal in some 700 minutes while Lyon have yet to leak a goal in 476, a run of over five matches. The top two teams from France automatically qualify for Europe's biggest competition while the third-placed team must negotiate qualifying, a hurdle Lille failed to clear this season."
205,30/01/2015,15:55,"Marseille victim of EUR700,000 Chinese scam","French Ligue 1 giants Marseille were the victims of a EUR700,000 ($793,000) international bank transfer scam to China last year, sources close to the case told AFP on Friday.","A preliminary enquiry has been opened by a court in the southern city of Marseille, with police fraud officers working in conjunction with the Central Office for Fighting Serious Financial Crime (OCRGDF). ""Like hundreds of other French companies, Olympique Marseille were the victims of a scam,"" the club said in a statement, adding they had ""immediately filed a complaint"" and ""taken all the necessary steps"". ""Part of the money has been recovered,"" the statement added. It is estimated that 360 French businesses have been hit by fake transfer orders, representing EUR300 million ($340m), in the past two years. A delegation from the French Justice Ministry visiting Beijing last November estimated that there had been ""an acceleration of such cases in late 2013, early 2014"". ""We're talking about international crooks who under the pretext of an official order, send these transfer requests and cash them in as quickly as possible before the victims realise what's going on. In general the claims are made on Friday afternoon,"" the source told AFP. The police have the difficult task of trying to trace the funds ""once they arrived in China and to identify the receiving bank, but are up against experienced crooks in the murky and sophisticated world of international finance"". Other recent high-profile victims of the scam were French international tyre-maker Michelin, to the tune of EUR1.6m ($1.8m), and global audit firm KPMG, who lost EUR7.6 ($8.6m). The scam is the latest misfortune to hit Marseille who were in the headlines recently as part of a probe into suspect player transfers. Jose Anigo, the club's former sporting director, was released without charge last week after he was among 12 people arrested as part of an enquiry involving players agents as well as suspected crime figures. The suspect transfers being investigated date back to 2010 and include that of French international striker Andre-Pierre Gignac. The club management has since changed. But president Vincent Labrune as well as several former leaders were among people held for questioning in November."
206,22/01/2015,16:09,Marseille coach defends Doria snub,Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa has angrily defended his decision to overlook Brazilian Doria who has not played since signing for the Ligue 1 side last September.,"The 20-year-old captain of Brazil's Olympic football team joined Marseille on a five-year deal worth EUR6 million ($6.9m) in September. Bielsa has opted for a defensive line-up against Nice on Friday that includes Brice Dja Djedje and Baptiste Aloe alongside Jeremy Morel, with Doria once again overlooked. ""Always the comment about Doria ...,"" snapped Bielsa when asked about the Brazilian defender at the team press conference ahead of Friday's game. ""It's clear that you understand nothing of the work I'm doing if you think that players play according to the price that we paid for them,"" said the Argentine coach. ""It's impossible for one (coach) to make choices on those criteria. The only thing which counts when deciding who plays is the coach's criteria and whether he is better or not than the other possibilities."" Bielsa added: ""Morel is the best central left back that I have available to me ... (Nicolas) Nkoulou plays left and right in the same way, as does Aloe. ""Doria is a great player, he's perfectly fit to play, but I chose a different player to play."" Marseille are currently second in Ligue 1 just a point behind leaders Lyon."
207,08/01/2015,02:15,Marseille aim to bounce back from Cup humiliation,Marseille will look to put the disappointment of their shock French Cup exit behind them and extend their lead at the top of the Ligue 1 table when they go to Montpellier on Friday.,"Marcelo Bielsa's side endured a disastrous start to 2015, losing on penalties to fourth-tier Grenoble in the last-64 of the French Cup after throwing away the lead three times. It was bitterly disappointing for Bielsa, who took Athletic Bilbao to the Copa del Rey final in 2012 in his first season in Spain, and the Argentine accepted the blame for the exit. ""I have more responsibility than my players for the defeat,"" he said. ""I was in charge of a team that had all the assets needed to win. There is no explanation for such a defeat."" Nevertheless, their Cup exit and the fact they are not involved in European competition this season mean Marseille can now focus all their attention on their quest to win a first Ligue 1 title since 2010. OM took the symbolic title of autumn champions after ending 2014 two points clear of Lyon and three ahead of reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain. An outstanding run of home form, featuring nine consecutive wins since a 2-0 loss to Montpellier in August, has been behind their rise, while their away form has been rather more patchy. Marseille have now gone six away games without a win in all competitions before facing Montpellier at the Stade de la Mosson, which has not hosted a match since the end of September, when it was put out of action by serious floods. Since then, Montpellier have hosted games at the home of the city's Top 14 rugby club, where they were beaten 3-0 by PSG in the French Cup on Monday. ""We are delighted to not have to play on that pitch anymore although we do thank them for helping us at a difficult time after the floods,"" said Montpellier coach Rolland Courbis, who played for Marseille and later coached his hometown team. With Africa Cup of Nations-bound Andre Ayew and Nicolas Nkoulou both absent, Marseille could be vulnerable, and their challengers will be hoping they slip up ahead of the bulk of the weekend slate. After a turbulent week overshadowed by the late return from Christmas holidays of Edinson Cavani and Ezequiel Lavezzi, PSG got back on track by beating Montpellier in the Cup and now go to Bastia on Saturday. Neither Cavani nor Lavezzi, who missed a training camp in Morocco while in South America, played against Montpellier and both will again be left out against Bastia. However, coach Laurent Blanc will be looking for a repeat of the Cup display, in which the likes of Yohan Cabaye and Clement Chantome came in and impressed. ""Since our training camp in Marrakech I have noticed a new momentum. I was satisfied with the way we played against Montpellier but we will need to repeat that performance against Bastia, where it will be just as difficult to play football,"" said Blanc. Propelled by 17-goal top scorer Alexandre Lacazette, Lyon are targeting a ninth straight home win when they face Toulouse on Sunday, while fourth-placed Saint-Etienne will attempt to extend a 10-game unbeaten run in the league as they face Reims away. Fifth plays sixth at the Stade Louis II on Sunday night when Monaco entertain Bordeaux in a match which will see visiting coach Willy Sagnol return to the ground where he played between 1997 and 2000. Monaco will be looking for revenge for a 4-1 defeat at Bordeaux back in August and, fresh from winning their last seven games, should be an entirely different proposition this time. Meanwhile, a minute's silence will be held at all Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 matches this weekend in honour of the 12 people who died when armed gunmen stormed the Paris offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly on Wednesday.

208,05/01/2015,00:01,Fourth-division Grenoble knock Marseille out of French Cup,Ligue 1 leaders Marseille were sensationally knocked out of the French Cup on Sunday as fourth-tier Grenoble prevailed in a penalty shoot-out after the sides finished 3-3 after extra-time.,"The last-64 tie went to an extra 30 minutes when Grenoble came back twice to level at 2-2 before Ghana's Andre Ayew appeared to score the winner with his strike in the first half of extra-time for Marseille. However a superb header from Grenoble's Selim Bengriba in the dying seconds set up the penalty finale and former Grenoble midfielder Florian Thauvin missed the only kick of the shootout to hand the home side a famous victory. ""We didn't do what we had to do and to lose this match is unacceptable,"" said Ayew. ""We were leading three times but we now have to concentrate on the second half of the league season which is very important. Grenoble showed a lot of desire and determination but we're very disappointed."" Elsewhere, there were few surprises as seven Ligue 1 sides including Monaco, Lyon and Saint-Etienne all marched into the next round. Holders Guingamp began their defence in style as they dispatched lower tier outfit Dinan-Lehon 3-2 while Bordeaux edged Toulouse 2-1 in an all top flight affair in the south. ""For our first match after the break, we can be satisfied with our performance,"" said Bordeaux coach Willy Sagnol. ""We showed something today that was lacking during the last ten days in December and this victory allows us to start the year well and now go to Monaco with some confidence,"" he added looking ahead to their league match next Sunday at the Louis II stadium. French champions Paris Saint-Germain take on Montpellier in the only Monday fixture. Three goals inside the opening 30 minutes was enough for Lyon to hold off Lens 3-2 in Calais while Monaco were too strong for second division Nimes running out 2-0 victors. ""To score three goals away from home in the French Cup is a great performance,"" said Lyon coach Hubert Fournier. ""We had to be conscious of the mental capacities of Lens who never gave up and it is good preparation for when we face them in the league in the coming weeks."" Franck Tabanou starred for Saint-Etienne when his extra-time volley on 97 minutes was the difference in a 1-0 victory over second division Nancy. Last year's finalists Rennes, took their place in the next round with a 2-1 win at Dunkirk. Bastia knocked out Lille on Saturday when Ligue 1 sides Evian, Reims and Nantes all won against sixth division opposition."
209,03/01/2015,02:25,Marseille look to avoid surprises in French Cup,"After a short winter break, Ligue 1 clubs are back in action this weekend in the round of 64 of the French Cup, with Marseille hoping to avoid any surprise against lower-league opponents.","Marcelo Bielsa's side, who topped the Ligue 1 table at the halfway stage of the season to take the symbolic title of Autumn Champions, travel to the freezing Alps for an awkward tie against fourth-tier Grenoble on Sunday. A tie that should be straightforward could be a tricky affair due to the state of the playing surface at the Stade des Alpes, which has been covered to protect it from the bitter cold but will be used for a Top 14 rugby match on Saturday. ""It is a reality that we need to live with. The pitch will suffer but I don't think it is something worth pointing out because it will be the same for the two teams,"" said Bielsa. The Argentine added that he intends to play his strongest possible team as Marseille try to win the Cup for the first time since 1989. ""I am going to try to play my best team, taking into account the future absences of Nicolas Nkoulou and Andre Ayew,"" said Bielsa, who will see the duo depart for the Africa Cup of Nations with Cameroon and Ghana respectively. Winger Florian Thauvin will come up against the club where he started his career, although much has changed at Grenoble in recent times. They spent two seasons in Ligue 1 before being relegated in 2010 and then sliding down the leagues due to financial problems, and are currently enjoying a fine campaign in the fourth tier. Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain go to Montpellier in an all top-flight encounter on Monday. Montpellier beat the capital giants at the Parc des Princes in the round of 32 a year ago and Rolland Courbis's side may fancy their chances of a repeat performance this time, just two weeks after holding PSG in the league. With Montpellier's own Stade de la Mosson still out of action after being seriously damaged during autumn floods, the game will be played at the home of the city's Top 14 rugby club, who play at the Altrad Stadium themselves on Saturday. That could be a levelling factor, but PSG -- whose preparations have been overshadowed by the late return from Christmas holidays of Ezequiel Lavezzi and Edinson Cavani -- need a positive result. ""Paris attract the limelight because, for certain people, they are the best team in France,"" said Montpellier defender Bryan Dabo. ""Matches against Paris are always special. We are not afraid, we are looking forward to it."" Elsewhere, Lyon, who sit second in Ligue 1 ahead of third-placed PSG, travel to Lens on Sunday looking for revenge after losing to the same opponents in last season's competition. Monaco, who finished 2014 with six straight wins, begin the new year with a trip to Ligue 2 strugglers Nimes, whose campaign has been overshadowed by allegations of match-fixing. Lille go to Bastia and Bordeaux face Toulouse in all Ligue 1 ties while Nantes play host to Club Franciscain, a sixth-tier side from the French Caribbean island of Martinique.

212,21/12/2014,16:14,Batshuyai ensures Marseille finish year top of the table,Belgian striker Michy Batshuyai repaid Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa's faith in giving him his first start by scoring the decider in the 2-1 win over Lille on Sunday to guarantee they top the table going into the New Year.,"Marseille, who last won the title in 2010 when coached by Didier Deschamps, lead defending champions Paris Saint Germain -- who drew 0-0 with Montpellier on Saturday -- and five ahead of Lyon, who play Bordeaux later on Sunday. Batshuyai -- who had had to bide his time to get a start since signing from Standard Liege in the close season -- had got the nod when Bielsa according to media reports told regular starter Dimitri Payet he could go on holiday as he would not be playing after failing to impress in training this week. The Belgian Under-21 international did not let the mercurial Argentinian coach down even though it was in front of a record Velodrome attendance of 62,048 spectators. Andre-Pierre Gignac had a superb chance in the 12th minute as a weak defensive header fell to him inside the penalty area but he sent his shot well wide of the post. Batshuyai went close to breaking the deadlock in the 27th minute as he created space for himself and unleashed a fine curling effort that went just wide of the post. The hosts went 1-0 up in the 32nd minute in the most unfortunate circumstances for Lille as Nolan Roux tried to put out a poor corner by Florian Thauvin but it flashed off his boot and beat Enyeama at the near post. Marseille had other chances including one for Andre Ayew, but the Ghanaian star's shot was cleared off the line by Simon Kjaer. Lille were fortunate not be reduced to 10 men 10 minutes into the second-half as Idrissa Gueye flashed out his arm and caught Mario Lemina full in the face but despite a harsh talking to by the referee he didn't receive even a booking. He made the most of his good fortune by levelling in the 61st minute, his shot from the edge of the area taking a deflection before rolling past Steve Mandanda. However, the hosts sent the massed ranks of Marseille fans -- many in Santa Claus hats -- into ecstasy in the 69th minute as Batshuyai turned his marker and let fly with a super right-footed effort that gave Enyeama no chance. Marseille were regiswtering their ninth successive home win."

But for the Parisians, it was another case of failing to live up to the pressure, following defeats to Barcelona in the Champions League and then Guingamp in the league, before an unconvincing 3-1 victory at second-tier AC Ajaccio in the League Cup in midweek. An error-strewn first-half at the Parc des Princes saw the mid-table visitors knock the Parisians out of their normally fluid style and frustrated them throughout the first 45 minutes. Montpellier could even claim the best chance of the first 45 minutes when Morgan Sanson had the the ball in the net with an acrobatic volley from Antony Mounier's cross from the left, but Mounier was harshly ruled offside and the goal did not count. PSG had to wait until five minutes from half-time before carving out a creditable chance of their own but failed to take advantage as Edinson Cavani needed one touch too many on Marco Verratti's through pass and the ball ran away from him, allowing Montpellier 'keeper Jonathan Ligali to smother it at his feet. The home side were looking anything like reigning champions even after upping the tempo at the start of the second half, as Montpellier managed to soak up everything PSG could throw at them. But PSG gave notice that it might not be long before they took the lead as they moved up a gear in the 63rd minute. First Lucas had a penalty appeal waved away after tangling with Abdelhamid El Kaoutari in the area and from the resulting corner, taken by Thiago Motta, Thiago Silva rose unchallenged to head goalwards only for Mounier to scramble it off the line. However, it was not be as the clock ran down with neither side looking likely to break the deadlock. Montpellier had scored seven goals in their previous two matches, but seemed mostly content to play a containing game and manager Rolland Courbis looked the happier at the final whistle as counterpart Laurent Blanc reflected on what might have been. Blanc said: ""I am disappointed with the last two games, against Guingamp and Montpellier, as we should have got more than one point from two matches and that would have meant we had a satisfactory first half of the season. ""Our lack of rhythm since the start of the campaign was evident again tonight."" He added: ""All season, we have been guilty of a lack of fight in midfield. It's true we didn't have many chances, but then nor did they. We are missing that attacking edge."" Ironically, the two sides will meet again in their very next next competitive match, having been drawn together in the French Cup, with the tie to be played in early January. Guingamp, meanwhile, continued their mini-revival with a hard-won point from the 1-1 draw at Toulouse to leapfrog their opponents into 12th place -- but still only three points above the relegation places. Thibault Giresse put Guingamp ahead in the eighth minute before Tongo Hamed Doumbia equalised after 26 minutes and Wissam Ben Yedder missed a 56th minute penalty, allowing the visitors to hold on for a share of the spoils. Nantes came away from the short trip to Lorient with all three points after a 2-1 win, Reims climbed to ninth with a 3-1 win away at Rennes and Monaco won 1-0 away at struggling Metz, while the bottom two, Caen and Bastia, shared the points in a 1-1 draw."

""The team gave a frank response to the critics, and especially to people in France who said at the start of the season that we weren't up to the level needed to qualify,"" said coach Leonardo Jardim, who has also come in for criticism for his side's stuttering domestic form. They will find out their opponents in the first knockout round of the Champions League on Monday, with Juventus, Arsenal and Manchester City all potentially lying in wait. But now Jardim's team can focus on trying to climb the Ligue 1 table and close the seven-point gap currently separating them from the top three. Marseille are a point clear of Paris Saint-Germain at the summit, although they have failed to win any of their last four away games between league and cup. ""It will be difficult against Marseille, but the victory (against Zenit) has given us confidence and I hope we can produce another good performance on Sunday,"" said young forward Anthony Martial. He could feature at the Stade Louis II as Dimitar Berbatov is sidelined after coming off injured against Zenit. Layvin Kurzawa and Geoffrey Kondogbia are also ruled out. Reigning champions PSG go to Guingamp on Sunday with the intention of bouncing back after seeing their record as the last unbeaten team in any of Europe's leading nations this season ended in a 3-1 defeat in Barcelona on Wednesday.

Hubert Fournier's side have lost just one of their last 13 Ligue 1 games after a dreadful start to the campaign, and are seeking an eighth consecutive home win when they meet the men from Normandy. ""We have been extremely focused since the start of September because of what happened in August,"" said Fournier, whose side have been led by 13-goal Alexandre Lacazette, Ligue 1's leading scorer. ""What we mustn't do is think that the hardest part has been done, but I've not seen any signs to suggest that is the mood.""

On Saturday, fifth-placed Bordeaux travel up the west coast to meet Nantes in the Atlantic derby. Nantes may boast home advantage but they have lost momentum after suffering three consecutive defeats, including a 2-1 reverse at PSG last time out. ""This is an important match against a team who are in good form at the moment. They have great attacking potential and score a lot of goals, so if we are to get a result we will need to rediscover our strength at the back,"" said Nantes coach Michel Der Zakarian, although the visitors could be without Cheick Diabate.

The letter read: ""A little friendly advice: as soon as you finish your season in your current club, I advice you to leave France immediatly [sic]. ""In fact, if you're not left France before June 1st, I will come to you specially Marseille smash your head shots baseball bat.""

218,07/12/2014,23:05,Marseille win to reclaim top spot,Marseille reclaimed top spot in Ligue 1 from Paris Saint-Germain with a hard-earned 3-1 victory over Metz at the Stade Velodrome on Sunday evening.,"Andre Ayew, making his first appearance in more than a month after injury, and Dimitri Payet scored to secure the win after Andre-Pierre Gignac's first-half opener had been cancelled out by Florent Malouda. An eighth consecutive home win for Marcelo Bielsa's side means they end the weekend one point clear of defending champions PSG, who beat Nantes 2-1 on Saturday. Marseille have not lost at home to Metz since 2004, when Franck Ribery was in the away side, but they endured an uncomfortable first half, creating little and requiring Steve Mandanda to make two fine saves from Malouda. A Payet shot that flashed over on 34 minutes was the hosts' first chance, and their first attempt on target, two minutes prior to the interval, brought the opening goal. Payet whipped in a cross from the left for the unmarked Gignac to head home his 12th of the season, and 50th Ligue 1 goal for Marseille, from close range. Metz were back level just 18 seconds into the second half as Juan Falcon teed up Malouda, whose shot from the edge of the area beat Mandanda thanks to a deflection off Nicolas Nkoulou. However, Marseille were not to be denied, as Ayew marked his first appearance since picking up an injury on international duty last month by following up to score after Alaixys Romao's shot had hit the post on 59 minutes. Gignac and Ayew both had chances to score again but it was the in-form Payet who wrapped up the points in injury time with a cool finish after being set up by Rod Fanni. Earlier, a stoppage-time penalty from Ligue 1's leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette allowed Lyon to win 3-2 at Evian and move back into third place. Lyon twice trailed in Annecy to goals from the veteran Cedric Barbosa, but Lacazette equalised with nine minutes left before hammering home from the spot four minutes into injury time. A second hard-earned win in the space of 72 hours ensured that Hubert Fournier's side are now back on track after their humbling 3-0 loss at bitter rivals Saint-Etienne last weekend and allowed them to climb back above Les Verts and Bordeaux, who triumphed on Saturday. Evian were dealt a blow before kick-off when talented Danish winger Daniel Wass was forced to withdraw from the side due to illness. Wass had scored stunning free-kicks in each of his side's last two matches, but Barbosa came into the starting XI and produced a memorable dead-ball strike of his own. Now 38, Barbosa gave the hosts the lead just before the half-hour mark with a curling free-kick from 30 yards into the top left-hand corner of the net. And after Yassine Benzia, in his first start in a year, tapped in when Lacazette's free-kick was blocked by goalkeeper Jesper Hansen, Barbosa restored Evian's lead seconds later by finishing at the end of a quick counter-attack. However, France international Lacazette controlled a Nabil Fekir corner at the far post and volleyed in to restore parity, and then slammed home from the spot after a handball by substitute Adrien Thomasson to take his tally for the season to 13. Northern rivals Lens and Lille drew 1-1 at the Stade de France while Guingamp won 3-2 at Reims. On Saturday, PSG temporarily went top and maintained their record as the only unbeaten team left in Europe's leading leagues this season by coming from behind to beat Nantes 2-1 at the Parc des Princes with Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring twice, including the winner from a ferocious free-kick. There were also wins for Nice and Montpellier, while Dimitar Berbatov scored twice as Monaco won 2-0 at Toulouse on Friday."
219,05/12/2014,14:57,Bielsa tight-lipped on Marseille future,Coach Marcelo Bielsa remained tight-lipped when questioned on Friday concerning his future with French Ligue 1 leaders Marseille.,"""There is a saying by (Argentine coach) Jorge Valdano: 'I work as if I'm going to stay for a lifetime knowing that I could leave tomorrow',"" said the former Argentina and Chile coach who took over at Marseille last May. There has been speculation concerning Bielsa's future after Marseille star striker Andre-Pierre Gignac said that ""an important element"" in whether or not he stays with the southern outfit would be whether or not the Argentine coach remained at the helm. ""I thank Gignac because there is praise in his words,"" said Bielsa, who coached Argentina to the 2004 Olympic gold medal and led Athletic Bilbao to the Europa League final in 2012, where they lost 3-0 to Atletico Madrid. ""Coaches have a very relative stability, it is difficult to ensure that the coach can stay very long in one place."" Gignac is the joint top scorer in the French league with 11 goals, a feat which Bielsa puts down to great teamwork. ""Gignac's goals are produced because he belongs to a team which plays in a certain way, which makes it possible for him to score,"" he said. Bielsa's pacesetters cling to their one point lead over Laurent Blanc's unbeaten PSG side after both sides were held to a draw on the road in midweek. Marseille host Metz on Sunday, without winger Romain Alessandrini, who suffered left ankle ligament damage which will keep him out of action until January 2015, although Ghanian international midfielder Andre Ayew has returned to training following a thigh injury. ""The only player not available at the moment is Alessandrini,"" said Bielsa, adding that midfielder Dimitri Payet, is still uncertain with an ankle injury."

The two-time defending champions blew a chance to return to the summit on Wednesday when they were held 1-1 at struggling Lille while Marseille also wasted two points after settling for the same scoreline at Lorient. PSG host Nantes at the Parc des Princes on Saturday with a chance to at least take temporary possession of top spot before Marseille entertain Metz at the Velodrome 24 hours later. PSG then travel to Guingamp before hosting Montpellier in their final match before the break, while Marseille are in Monaco on the penultimate weekend and then finish with a home tie against Lille. Blanc said there were few regrets about the stalemate at Lille during a match in which he gave last season's Ligue 1 top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic the night off. ""I'm satisfied with the draw because I saw phases of play that I haven't seen with PSG for a long time,"" said Blanc. ""In my opinion our play was much more fluid that in previous weeks but of course we're disappointed not to go top. ""I rested Zlatan because of our schedule. You can't just come back from this type of injury after seven weeks out,"" added the former France and Bordeaux coach on the Swede's return from a heel problem. ""November was a tough month and I have to manage the squad. We wanted to rest Ibra (Ibrahimovic) because he just played three matches in a row and in December we have a series of five matches. We decided early on he would not make the trip to Lille."" continued the former centre-half. Marseille, who held a seven point lead over PSG after 10 of 16 matches this season, can look no further than their away form and a drop in goals from top scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac for their stuttering results of late. Gignac continues to lead the scoring charts on 11 alongside Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette, but the French international has only found the target once in his last six matches. ""We've been creating chances and playing well but our problem has not been playing away from home, it has been a lack of efficiency in front of goal,"" explained Bielsa. Elsewhere, Saint-Etienne are six points off top after their first home win in 20 years over arch rivals Lyon last Sunday, and a no-nonsense 2-0 win at 2012 champions Montpellier in midweek. Christophe Galtier's exciting side can keep the pressure on the top three when they host basement dwellers Bastia on Saturday. Brittany club and French Cup finalists Rennes, who host Montpellier the same evening, and Bordeaux, who await Lorient at the Stade Chaban-Delmas, are both in the mix just a point behind Saint-Etienne. Lyon stayed third, a point above Saint-Etienne, after Lacazette's injury-time winner over Reims on Thursday and they travel to Evian on Sunday. Last season's runners-up Monaco open the weekend slate on Friday when they make the short trip to Toulouse, Lens have a chance to escape the relegation zone at home to Lille while Reims entertain Guingamp and Caen meet Nice in Normandy.

In an attempt to end a run of three successive defeats on the road Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa opted for a five-man defence. Up front, Andre-Pierre Gignac had an off night, missing all his chances, including a lob attempt in the 24th minute. In the 71st minute, he struck the ball at a virtually empty Lorient goalmouth, only for his shot to be aimed at Vincent Le Goff - the only defender guarding the goalline. Marseille were struggling to create much real danger, aside from in the 32nd minute when Payet out-foxed Lorient keeper Benjamin Lecomte to put the south coast visitors in the lead. Marseille's lead lasted a matter of minutes, with Lorient levelling via Marseille's former striker Ayew's penalty awarded after keeper Steve Mandanda's late challenge on Benjamin Jeannot. Bielsa's gamble after the hour mark when he introduced Michy Batshuayi for Abdelaziz Barrada failed to pay off. Marseille finished the last 20 minutes the stronger side, sensing Lorient were flagging. Lorient captain Wesley Lautoa made a game-saving goalline tackle to deny Batshuayi with 10 minutes remaining. Marseille, according to Bielsa, deserved to have come away with all three points. ""The difference between the two sides wasn't reflected in the result, so there's a sense of dissatisfaction,"" said the Argentinian. ""We had enough opportunities but lacked efficiency,"" he added. Also on Tuesday, Toulouse saw off hosts Nantes 2-1, while Monaco welcomed Lens in the late game. Paris Saint-Germain can take over at the Ligue 1 summit on Wednesday with success at Lille, although they will have to do so without their absent star striker Zlatan Ibrahimahic."
222,02/12/2014,10:58,Gignac eyes Marseille exit,Marseille's star striker Andre-Pierre Gignac said Tuesday he was considering a move away from the Ligue 1 leaders at the end of the season.,"""I think I'll leave at the end of the season,"" Gignac told the Gazzetta dello Sport. ""I'd like to know if (coach Marcelo) Bielsa will stay. But I'm looking for a high level challenge. I'll examine all proposals carefully."" Gignac, 28, who will be out of contract with Marseille at the end of the season, is currently one of the club's biggest earners with a monthly salary of 300,000 euros ($374,000). He is currently the joint top scorer in Ligue 1 with 11 goals this season, and has earned a recall to the France team with Arsenal's Olivier Giroud just returning from injury."
223,23/11/2014,23:19,Gignac makes right headlines in Marseille win,Andre-Pierre Gignac steered home an 85th minute header to help under-fire Marseille to a 3-1 victory over Bordeaux and keep Marcelo Bielsa's side top of Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"The come-from-behind win lifts Marseille one point ahead of Paris Saint-Germain while Bordeaux remain fourth but now seven points adrift. Gignac's clinical strike was his 11th goal of the season and lifts him joint top of the scoring charts with Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette. Michy Batshuayi wrapped up the scoring in the final minute after Mario Lamina had cancelled out Thomas Toure's opener for Bordeaux. ""It was a tough match right to the end but it's a positive result for us and a great evening,"" said Marseille's French international Dimitri Payet who set up the equaliser. ""I was able to recover and get some rest during the international break which helped me to work on other aspects of my game. I'm just happy my work has paid off."" The game took a turn for the worse for the home side when Marseille defender Benjamin Mendy was left with egg on his face in the 55th minute as his defensive howler led to Bordeaux's goal. The 20-year-old defender tried to dribble his way out of trouble before playing the ball straight to the feet of Bordeaux's Nicolas Maurice-Belay who was in perfect position to attack. The former Monaco winger raced at the outnumbered Marseille defence before laying the ball to the wide open Toure who had the simple task of placing the ball past Steve Mandanda. The lead was short-lived as a fine cross five minutes later from Payet on the right flank was met by Lamina and his firm header left Bordeaux 'keeper Cedric Carrasso rooted to his line. It was the 21-year-old Gabonese-born midfielder's first goal in Ligue 1. Then came Gignac's moment of magic and his first goal in three games to ignite the victory. Earlier this week, Gignac inadvertently found himself at the centre of controversy when it was revealed his transfer from Toulouse to Marseille in 2010 was being investigated as part of a fraud probe. Around 15 club officials, including president Vincent Labrune and two former presidents, were arrested. Sources close to the investigation said gangland figures were suspected of receiving commission from several major transfers, including that of Gignac and Senegalese international Souleymane Diawara. In the weekend curtain raiser on Friday, champions PSG defeated Metz 3-2 as star forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic made his first start in two months and temporarily lifted the champions top of the league for the first time this season. Argentines Javier Pastore and Ezequiel Lavezzi scored either side of a Gaetan Bussman own goal for the visitors, who remain unbeaten this season. A pair of Modibo Maiga penalties had briefly brought Metz level early in the second half after turning around 2-0 down at the break, but they couldn't hold out. In earlier matches on Sunday, fifth-placed Nantes maintained their one point advantage in the standings over Saint-Etienne as the two teams battled to a 0-0 stalemate at La Beaujoire stadium in Brittany. The Canaries had chances to snatch maximum points, notably from set-pieces, but French international 'keeper Stephane Ruffier denied efforts from Olivier Veigneau, Etay Schecter and Georges-Kevin Nkoudo to preserve his clean sheet. Elsewhere, 2012 champions Montpellier eased four points above the relegation zone with a 2-0 victory over Toulouse. Former Lyon and Nice midfielder Anthony Mounier was quickest to pounce on a loose ball in the box after 37 minutes and beat Ali Ahamada in the away goal and put Montpellier 1-0 in front. Senegal striker Souleymane Camara then made sure of the points with three minutes remaining with an angled shot that again Ahamada failed to keep out. On Saturday, Lyon extended their unbeaten Ligue 1 streak to ten matches with a hard-fought 0-0 draw at Bastia while Monaco failed to make up ground on the front-runners when they were held 2-2 at home by Caen."
224,18/11/2014,13:33,Police swoop after Marseille transfer probe,"The president of Marseille football club and two former directors were taken in for questioning Tuesday as part of a probe into transfers including that of top striker Andre-Pierre Gignac, sources close to the investigation said.","Vincent Labrune was taken into custody in Marseille along with director-general of the club Philippe Perez and former president Pape Diouf. Another former president, Jean-Claude Dassier, was being held in Paris. The investigation is looking into ""contentious"" money transfers ""made in recent years"", sources close to the investigation said. A police source spoke of ""fraud linked to several transfers"". The transfer of Gignac from Toulouse in 2010 is part of the probe, which is being overseen by France's organised and financial crime squad. Several current and former officials from Marseille have already been questioned in the affair, and investigators have raided the club's offices and seized documents in recent months. Sources close to the case said there was ""enough material"" to ""scrutinise the past and present management of OM (Olympique Marseille)"" and the allegedly illegal transfers. Those in custody ""will have to explain themselves from top to bottom"", the source added."
225,09/11/2014,23:05,PSG too strong for Marseille as Ligue 1 race tightens,Paris Saint-Germain defeated arch rivals Marseille 2-0 at the Parc des Princes on Sunday as the Ligue 1 title race was thrown wide open.,"The two-time defending champions dominated their visitors from the south in an intense encounter and wrapped up three crucial points thanks to an opportunist strike from Brazilian Lucas Moura and a close-range header from Edinson Cavani. PSG are now just one point behind Marseille as their unbeaten start to the season, in all competitions, continued in the biggest fixture in French football. Lyon, who won their fifth straight match earlier in the day when they downed Guingamp 3-1 at the Stade Gerland, are also breathing down the necks of Marseille and stand two points adrift. The match in the capital struggled to burst into life despite the return of PSG's Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic who came on with 24 minutes left for his first action since September 21. Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa looked on in shock with the match 1-0 as his side's chances of an equaliser took a severe turn for the worse with 12 minutes left when Giannelli Imbula was shown a straight red card for what appeared to be a minor offence. Cavani capped a convincing performance for PSG with a poacher's header from just outside the six-yard box with five minutes remaining that capped a perfect week for the capital club who also booked their place in the Champions League knockout phase. Monaco held on for a 1-1 draw at Saint-Etienne despite finishing the match with ten men in a stormy encounter at the Geoffroy Guichard stadium. Reims extended their unbeaten run to five matches with a 2-0 victory over Lille, who now haven't won in the league in five outings. Alexandre Lacazette went top of the Ligue 1 scoring charts with 11 goals as he opened the scoring for Lyon in the eighth minute with a back post header from Nabil Fekir's cross. Fekir doubled the lead on 20 minutes after converting on the slide a low cross from Christophe Jallet. At that point Lyon seemed in cruise control but they needed Fekir's second goal, three minutes from time, to finally steady their nerves. The Cup holders pulled a goal back on the stroke of halftime as Sylvain Marveaux's free-kick came back off the bar and hit Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes before going in. Under steady rain at Saint-Etienne, Lacina Traore saw his shot deflected past Stephane Ruffier to put Monaco 1-0 in front after just 17 minutes. However Saint-Etienne, were handed the first of two dubious decisions on 58 minutes, when Dutchman Ricky van Wolfswinkel was allowed to run clear despite being blatantly offside and he gratefully tucked away the equaliser. Monaco suffered more bad fortune when they were reduced to ten men with 19 minutes left when Tiemoue Bakayoko was shown a second yellow card for a light brush against a Saint-Etienne player that even had the home players appealing to the referee for leniency. ""We didn't create a lot of chances and we were lucky enough to take the lead but we weren't able to protect the advantage,"" said Monaco playmaker Jeremy Toulalan. ""We've being playing some good matches and we might have lost this one a while ago but it's a good draw and now we just have to push on and hope for better results."""
226,07/11/2014,14:21,Ibrahimovic poised for 'Clasico' return,"Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is poised to make his return in Sunday's top-of-the-table Ligue 1 clash against Marseille after returning to full training on Friday, the capital club confirmed.","The Sweden captain took part in training for the first time since injuring his heel on September 21 and his return is a huge boost for Laurent Blanc's champions, who come into the high-security clash at the Parc des Princes, four points back of their arch rivals. The club published several photos of last season's Ligue 1 top scorer in training with the headline - ""Encouraging signs ahead of the clasico"". Ibrahimovic, who scored 41 goals in all competitions last season, trained with the ball for the first time on Thursday and later spoke on the club's tv channel about his motivation to make his return against Marseille, arguably the biggest fixture in French football. ""This type of match, you have to win. I've played in a lot of derbies in my career, in Holland, Italy, in Spain so I have the experience in these situations,"" continued the former Ajax, Juventus, AC Milan and Barcelona star. His Brazilian teammate Lucas fuelled the rumours about a potential return when he spoke to AFP and revealed the Swede's initial form. ""I saw him yesterday on the training ground and he was running very well. He said he was feeling a bit of pain but he's doing really well and is running normally. I hope he will be ready Sunday because we've missed him and he's a great player,"" said Lucas."
227,01/11/2014,19:17,PSG gear change cranks up pressure on Marseille,Unbeaten Paris Saint Germain drew to within a single point of Ligue 1 leaders Marseille on Saturday with a come-from-behind 2-1 away win over Lorient.,"Lorient stunned the champions with Raphael Guerreiro's tight shot opening the scoring on 42 minutes. But Paris came back early in the second-half with goals from Edinson Cavani and substitute Jean-Christophe Bahebeck. Marseille, who lost at Lyon last weekend, have 25 points ahead of their home game with Lens on Sunday and PSG have 24, as these two giants of French football get ready to go head-to-head in Paris next weekend. Paris also maybe had one eye on their Champions League clash with APOEL of Cyprus in midweek, given the pedestrian nature of a sluggish first-half performance. But they were given a rude awakening just before half-time. Lorient came out of defence to launch a blistering break in their orange strip and yellow boots. Andre Ayew took the ball into the box and fed midfielder Raphael Guerreiro, who stunned PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu with his sudden tight-angled shot to make it 1-0. ""We played badly all over the pitch in the first half. But you saw straight away the difference in the second half, and we got a goal straight away and went in for the win,"" the PSG 'keeper said. And the difference was indeed eye-catching as Paris moved up a gear. A defence splitting pass from Argentine playmaker Javier Pastore set up Cavani's equaliser just after the break, the Uruguayan nimbly hoisting the ball over the onrushing 'keeper before executing his traditional rifle-shot goal celebration. It was his third goal in three starts. Coach Laurent Blanc then made a double substitution bringing on Marco Veratti for the misfiring Yohan Cabaye and Jean-Christophe Bahebeck for a tired looking Ezequiel Lavezzi and it paid immediate dividends. Veratti fed Bahebeck as he ran into space and his shot flew home from a tight angle to send a wave of joy through a relieved Paris side. PSG can now look ahead to next Sunday with confidence. ""We are hoping for a great show next week and a great performance from both teams, we're all looking forward to it,"" said Sirigu. In Friday's game Monaco drew 1-1 at home to Reims. Later Saturday, Lille host St Etienne, Nantes welcome Rennes in the Brittany derby Sunday and Marseille will be keen to reopen a four-point gap on Paris when they host Lens in Sunday's late game."
228,31/10/2014,02:25,PSG bid to crank up pressure on stuttering Marseille,"As their meeting with bitter rivals Marseille approaches, Paris Saint-Germain will look to further increase the pressure on the Ligue 1 leaders with a win at struggling Lorient on Saturday.","PSG are the only side in France's top flight to still boast an unbeaten record after Marseille went down 1-0 at Lyon last weekend, a result that means the two clubs are now separated by just four points at the top of the table. The clubs clash in the French game's biggest grudge match at the Parc des Princes on November 9, and Paris would love to go into 'Le Classique' with a chance of seizing first place from OM. A win at Lorient would leave just one point between the sides and turn up the heat on Marseille, who host Lens at the Stade Velodrome on Sunday night. Laurent Blanc's PSG, who host APOEL of Cyprus in the Champions League next midweek, welcome back Edinson Cavani after suspension for the trip to Brittany while Marquinhos is set to return, but they must do without the banned Gregory Van der Wiel. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is still on the sidelines with a heel problem that refuses to go away, yet the capital side should still have enough firepower to take three points from the artificial pitch at the Stade du Moustoir. ""It is very important for us to win at Lorient to stay alongside Marseille,"" captain Thiago Silva told PSG TV. ""We are playing them in our next game so this is a chance to close the gap. Artificial pitches are very different. The ball goes very fast, so we will need to be fully focused."" Lorient may have won at Evian in the League Cup in midweek but their miserable league form -- six defeats in their last seven outings -- suggests that their chances of causing an upset are slim. ""They are not unbeatable. We will do everything to try and get a result,"" declared their former Marseille striker Jordan Ayew optimistically. Ayew's old side had equalled the club record of eight successive league wins before coming unstuck at Lyon, and Marcelo Bielsa's men were then eliminated from the League cup at Rennes on Wednesday, going down 2-1. ""Losing makes me sad. We are very disappointed to exit the competition so quickly,"" said Bielsa after seeing OM take the lead only to be hauled back on level terms before conceding the winner in the last minute. ""Two defeats in a row obviously forces us to rethink things. Sunday's game is very important and we must immediately start thinking about that."" Against Lens, Bielsa will welcome back a host of players who were rested in the League Cup, including goalkeeper Steve Mandanda and leading scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac, although full-back Brice Dja Djedje is banned after his red card at Rennes. On Friday, Monaco will look to continue their recent good form when they entertain Reims at the Stade Louis II. The principality club won 3-1 away to Bastia last weekend and have lost just once in nine matches in all competitions. ""At the start of the season not everything was bad, just as today not everything is good. There is always room for progress in football,"" said coach Leonardo Jardim. Monaco, who will be without Layvin Kurzawa but welcome back midfield duo Joao Moutinho and Jeremy Toulalan, can leap provisionally into fourth place with a victory. Third-placed Lyon are unbeaten in seven games but travel to Nice on Saturday wary of the south-coast club's Brazilian star Carlos Eduardo, who netted five times in a stunning 7-2 success at Guingamp last weekend. Meanwhile, Lille entertain Saint-Etienne chasing a return to winning ways before travelling to face Everton in the Europa League. Fixtures (all kick-offs 1900 GMT unless stated)"
229,29/10/2014,23:03,Marseille dumped out of League Cup,"French Ligue 1 leaders Marseille were eliminated from the League Cup at the first hurdle on Wednesday, conceding in the last minute to lose 2-1 at Rennes.","OM are four points clear at the top of the league but saw their run of eight consecutive wins ended in a 1-0 reverse at Lyon last weekend and coach Marcelo Bielsa opted to rotate his squad for the trip to Brittany. Bielsa made six changes to his starting line-up, with Michy Batshuayi getting his chance up front as Andre-Pierre Gignac was rested. And the young Belgian striker gave the visitors the lead in the 19th minute at the Stade de la Route de Lorient to put Marseille seemingly on course for a berth in the last 16. However, Anders Konradsen headed in the equaliser from inside the six-yard box on the hour and Austrian forward Philipp Hosiner then diverted the ball into the net in injury time to take Rennes through. That winning goal came after Brice Dja Djedje and Paul-Georges Ntep were sent off following a clash as tempers flared, leaving both teams to end the game with 10 men. Earlier on Wednesday, Metz eliminated Nice on penalties after squandering a 3-0 lead to draw the match on the Cote d'Azur 3-3. Along with the winners of Tuesday's ties, Rennes and Metz progress to the last 16 in December, when France's six European representatives -- including holders Paris Saint-Germain -- will enter the draw."
230,20/10/2014,14:29,Bielsa effect has Marseille flying but can it last?,Marseille's start to the French Ligue 1 season had already exceeded all expectations before history was made in Sunday's 2-0 win against Toulouse at the Stade Velodrome.,"As has been their trademark since Marcelo Bielsa was appointed coach in the summer, OM came flying out of the blocks as first-half goals from Nicolas Nkoulou and Andre-Pierre Gignac secured a club record-equalling eighth consecutive league victory. When, under Bielsa's predecessor Jose Anigo, Marseille beat Ajaccio 3-1 in April, there were vast swathes of empty seats at the Velodrome and those fans who did turn up spent the game berating president Vincent Labrune, Anigo and club owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus. Most fans lost interest last season as the team failed to qualify for Europe for the first time in a decade, but on Sunday, as a sign of how Bielsa has turned things around, the Velodrome -- recently renovated ahead of Euro 2016 -- welcomed a new record attendance of 61,846. Marseille have opened up a seven-point lead over reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain and Bordeaux at the top of Ligue 1 and the question now is whether they can maintain their position. Cameroon centre-back Nkoulou played down their chances after Sunday's win, saying: ""Paris are still Paris. We are the little ones! We are definitely better than last year, but Paris, with their weaponry, remain the favourites."" A trip to PSG on November 9 will give a clearer idea, but in the meantime there can be no doubt that what is currently being served up at the Velodrome is in stark contrast to last season, despite Bielsa keeping faith in the players who underperformed previously. Mathieu Valbuena and defender Lucas Mendes were the only leading players to leave in the summer, but none of the club's four major summer signings have made an impact under Bielsa, who last month slammed Labrune for his recruitment policy in a staggering press conference. ""I think the president made promises to me that he knew he had no intention of keeping,"" said the former Chile and Athletic Bilbao coach at the time. ""None of the players who have joined Marseille did so on my initiative."" Romain Alessandrini, Michy Batshuayi, Abdelaziz Barrada and Doria were brought in, but have started two games between them. Meanwhile, the seven players who have started every game were already on the books last season, including striker Andre-Pierre Gignac, who scored his 10th goal in 10 games this season against Toulouse. Gignac has in the past struggled with weight problems, but this season he has stood out despite the huge physical demands of Bielsa's style of football. ""It is not easy, because we work hard during the week,"" said Nkoulou, whose goal against Toulouse was one of nine OM have scored in the first half-hour of games. ""It is a pleasure when it all comes together. I hope we will recover sufficiently physically in order to finish the season well. So far, so good."" The enigmatic Bielsa, who spends games either pacing relentlessly back and forth in his technical area or perched on a drinks cooler, is not everyone's cup of tea and players who have worked under him in the past have started well before eventually creaking under the physical strain. It therefore remains to be seen how long the Bielsa effect will last, but for now Nkoulou insists the Marseille players are loving it. ""To have a coach like him plays a big part for us. He shows each of us one by one what he wants us to do. We could not dream of anything better,"" he said. Marseille's failure to qualify for Europe is undoubtedly helping their cause, giving the players more time to rest in between games. The meeting with PSG is approaching but before that a trip to Lyon next Sunday will be a huge test too -- the last time OM won eight in a row they lost in Lyon in their next match and this time they will be facing an OL side who are unbeaten in six and impressed in their 5-1 win against Montpellier on Sunday."
231,19/10/2014,17:42,Record-equalling Marseille make it eight in a row,"Marseille earned a club record-equalling eighth consecutive league win on Sunday, beating Toulouse 2-0 at the Stade Velodrome to move seven points clear at the top of Ligue 1.","First-half goals from Nicolas Nkoulou and the in-form Andre-Pierre Gignac proved enough for Marcelo Bielsa's side to take all three points as OM matched their previous record for consecutive league victories set in 1937 and in 1998. OM, who have won every game since starting the campaign with a draw and a defeat, are seven points above reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain, although Bordeaux can cut their lead back to five points by beating Caen later on Sunday. ""I didn't know Marseille had pulled off such a run of results before. It gives me great joy that we have managed it,"" said Bielsa, for whom the only black mark on a fine afternoon came when he sat on his own cup of coffee in the technical area. Marseille were looking to pick up where they left off before the international break and Bielsa's starting line-up was unchanged from that which triumphed 2-1 at Caen a fortnight ago. There was a new record crowd at the recently renovated Stade Velodrome, with the figure of 61,846 beating the previous mark of 59,120 set in the rugby World Cup quarter-final between Australia and England in 2007. The home fans almost saw their side fall behind early on against an in-form Toulouse as Steve Mandanda turned a Martin Braithwaite shot onto the bar. But OM got the breakthrough in the 21st minute, Cameroon defender Nkoulou rising to convert a Dimitri Payet free-kick, the ball appearing to go into the net off his shoulder. Florian Thauvin then shot just wide before the home side doubled their lead nine minutes before the interval as Gignac -- who starred in France's friendly win against Armenia in midweek -- netted his 10th goal in as many league games this season. Toulouse initially lost possession from a throw-in and then failed to clear a cross from the Marseille left, allowing Gignac to sweep the ball into the net against his old club. Zacharie Boucher turned a Payet long-range strike over the bar early in the second half and substitute Abdelaziz Barrada had an effort cleared off the line late on as Marseille failed to add to their lead. ""My team played very well,"" added the always demanding Bielsa. ""Toulouse only had one real opportunity, right at the start of the match. ""Our opponents were unable to run more than us, although there were moments where we were not so good because the way we play is very demanding. ""There were moments when the players struggled to keep up the tempo."" The last time the south-coast club won eight league games in a row was in 1998, when their run was ended in a 2-1 defeat at Lyon, who will be Marseille's opponents next weekend. OL will look to extend their own five-game unbeaten run when they host Montpellier on Sunday evening. On Friday, PSG came from behind to beat Lens 3-1 in a remarkable encounter played at the Stade de France which featured three red cards in the space of six second-half minutes. On Saturday, Monaco warmed up for their Champions League clash with Benfica by beating Evian 2-0 at the Stade Louis II thanks to a Joao Moutinho penalty and a second-half Yannick Ferreira Carrasco strike.

""He's back, he was there last year in September (against Georgia),"" said Deschamps of Gignac who will back-up the usual forward lineup of Karim Benzema, Antoine Griezmann, Mathieu Valbuena, Loic Remy and Remy Cabella.

235,28/09/2014,23:10,Relentless Marseille continue winning streak,"Marseille made it six wins on the bounce on Sunday, beating Saint-Etienne 2-1 at the Stade Velodrome to end the weekend two points clear at the top of Ligue 1.","Marcelo Bielsa's side produced a typically high octane performance in the first half and found themselves two goals ahead inside 28 minutes, Giannelli Imbula and Dimitri Payet both on target. The tempo dropped in the second half and Jonathan Brison got one back for Saint-Etienne, but OM held on to make it three wins in the last eight days and six in a row, their longest winning streak since the start of the 2012-13 campaign. This latest success saw them reclaim first place from Bordeaux, who had beaten Rennes 2-1 earlier on Sunday, while stuttering champions Paris Saint-Germain are five points off the pace in fourth. Bielsa named an unchanged side following last Tuesday's 5-0 victory at Reims while the visitors made several changes, having drawn at home with Bordeaux on Thursday. The hosts looked the fresher of the two teams and got off to the perfect start, Imbula collecting a Brice Dja Djedje pass, controlling and then lashing a shot into the bottom-left corner from just outside the area. Payet, the former Saint-Etienne winger, then came close on two separate occasions before finding the net shortly before the half-hour mark, stroking the ball home from just inside the box after Andre Ayew had stolen possession back from Francois Clerc. Marseille could not maintain the same level of intensity and Brison reduced the arrears on 53 minutes with a sweetly struck half-volley after the home defence had failed to clear their lines. Nevertheless, the hosts held on and Andre-Pierre Gignac, scorer of eight goals already this season, was only denied another by a good Stephane Ruffier save late on. Saint-Etienne, meanwhile, have still not won at the Velodrome since 1979, when Michel Platini and Johnny Rep were in their side. ""We must be honest. The coach has brought so much. He is meticulous -- everyone knows what they need to be doing,"" Marseille goalkeeper and captain Steve Mandanda told Canal Plus. ""But you can see that when we take our foot off the gas a little, like at the start of the second half, there is nothing between us and the other sides. We need to learn from games like this and remain fully concentrated."" Bordeaux were inspired by youngster Thomas Toure as they got the better of Rennes at the Stade Chaban-Delmas. Toure set up Wahbi Khazri to put Les Girondins ahead in the second half and then curled in a magnificent winning goal in the third minute of added time after Habib Habibou had levelled for Rennes in the 80th minute. ""The players never gave up. They were cooked at the end, but they kept looking for the winner into the final minutes,"" said delighted Bordeaux coach Willy Sagnol. ""They can be proud but they also know that there is work to be done in terms of the performance."" Elsewhere, Lyon made it four games unbeaten but threw away the lead in a 1-1 draw away to Nantes at the Stade de la Beaujoire. Burkina Faso defender Bakary Kone headed in Alexandre Lacazette's free-kick to put OL ahead six minutes into the second half, but he then shoved Georges-Kevin Nkoudou to the ground inside the box, allowing Jordan Veretout to level from the penalty spot in the 72nd minute. Sunday's other game saw Lens draw 0-0 with fellow promoted club Caen at their temporary home in Amiens. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain were held to a 1-1 draw at Toulouse, their fourth draw in their last five matches meaning that they will not go into Tuesday's Champions League showdown with Barcelona in the best shape. France's other Champions League group stage representative, Monaco, suffered a fourth loss in just eight league games this season, falling 1-0 at home to Nice in the Cote d'Azur derby, while there were wins for Lille, Metz, Montpellier and Evian."
236,28/09/2014,23:10,Relentless Marseille continue winning streak,"Marseille made it six wins on the bounce on Sunday, beating Saint-Etienne 2-1 at the Stade Velodrome to end the weekend two points clear at the top of Ligue 1.","Marcelo Bielsa's side produced a typically high octane performance in the first half and found themselves two goals ahead inside 28 minutes, Giannelli Imbula and Dimitri Payet both on target. The tempo dropped in the second half and Jonathan Brison got one back for Saint-Etienne, but OM held on to make it three wins in the last eight days and six in a row, their longest winning streak since the start of the 2012-13 campaign. This latest success saw them reclaim first place from Bordeaux, who had beaten Rennes 2-1 earlier on Sunday, while stuttering champions Paris Saint-Germain are five points off the pace in fourth. Bielsa named an unchanged side following last Tuesday's 5-0 victory at Reims while the visitors made several changes, having drawn at home with Bordeaux on Thursday. The hosts looked the fresher of the two teams and got off to the perfect start, Imbula collecting a Brice Dja Djedje pass, controlling and then lashing a shot into the bottom-left corner from just outside the area.

237,23/09/2014,20:57,Marseille thrash Reims to soar clear in Ligue 1,High-flying Marseille picked up their fifth straight victory on Tuesday as Ligue 1 top scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac claimed a brace in a 5-0 thrashing of Reims.,"Gignac could even afford the luxury of a missed eighth-minute penalty, before scoring two first-half goals while Ghana international Andre Ayew also struck twice in a one-sided affair at the Stade Auguste Delaune. The win takes Marcelo Bielsa's in-form side three points clear at the top of the French table ahead of a busy Wednesday slate, before Saint-Etienne host Bordeaux on Thursday with both teams currently tied for second. Gignac, who was left out of Didier Deschamps' World Cup team that reached the quarter-finals in Brazil, gave the national coach food for thought as he took his lead-leading tally to eight goals in seven matches. France are preparing to host Euro 2016 and qualify automatically. French-born Ayew, who helped Ghana finish runners-up to Egypt at the 2010 African Championships, put the result beyond doubt seven minutes after half-time, before an audacious back-heeled goal on the hour mark added further gloss. Marseille, who won the last of their nine French titles in 2010 under Deschamps, put the icing on the cake with 16 minutes remaining when Gianelli Imbula celebrated a rare goal much to the delight of the travelling Velodrome faithful. In the only other match in Ligue 1 action on Tuesday, eighth-placed Brittany side Rennes host lower table Toulouse. Defending champions Paris Saint-Germain are now five points adrift, and will be without injured striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic for their trip to Caen on Wednesday, while fourth-placed Lille travel to the Cote d'Azur and a tie against fourth-from-bottom Nice. Montpellier, the 2012 champions under current Lille head coach Rene Girard, host last season's runners-up Monaco, before Thursday's big clash at the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium between Saint-Etienne and Bordeaux."
238,19/09/2014,02:10,Bielsa having impact as Marseille bid to extend winning run,"Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa may not enjoy an easy relationship with his president, but he has got his team performing on the field as they prepare to host Rennes in Ligue 1 on Saturday.","OM beat bottom club Evian 3-1 away last weekend, their third consecutive victory leaving them just a point behind early leaders Lille. That win eased the tension around the club after Bielsa criticised president Vincent Labrune for failing to sign any of the players he had targeted over the summer and for recruiting Brazilian defender Doria against his wishes. However, Labrune insisted on Monday that the two had held talks and that the incident was now behind them. ""We had a frank, in-depth and respectful discussion,"" he said. ""I understood that Marcelo did not wish to cause controversy. ""The incident is now over. The interest of the club must come first and everyone is working together towards achieving success this season."" Marseille are not distracted by European competition this season, and their prospects of challenging at the top of the Ligue 1 table may be helped as a result. However, Rennes, who won in Marseille last season and are fresh from holding champions Paris Saint-Germain to a 1-1 draw, are unlikely to provide easy opposition. Rennes coach Philippe Montanier will get the chance to renew acquaintances with Bielsa after the two came up against each other when in charge of Basque rivals Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao respectively between 2011 and 2013. ""He is an introverted personality but I will be pleased to see him again,"" said Montanier. ""He did a good job in Bilbao."" Bordeaux, who are also a point behind leaders Lille, play host to Evian on Friday aiming to bounce back from their first defeat of the season at Guingamp last weekend. Les Girondins were the surprise package of the opening weeks of the season but coach Willy Sagnol has tried to play down expectations ahead of the clash with the division's bottom side. ""First place does not reflect the true level of our team,"" said the former Bayern Munich full-back. ""There are better teams than us. We know we can get close to them by working hard and it is easier when we are in the shadows."" None of France's European representatives are in action until Sunday, when champions PSG entertain Lyon at the Parc des Princes. Laurent Blanc's side were held to a 1-1 draw at Ajax in their Champions League opener on Wednesday, a result that left them with only one win from eight away outings since April. ""I don't know why we are struggling to win away from home. I can't explain it. It is not a catastrophe to draw here but we wanted to win,"" said Dutch defender Gregory Van der Wiel after the game in Amsterdam. Paris have drawn all three away games in Ligue 1 so far this season but at home they are a different proposition, as their 5-0 hammering of Saint-Etienne recently suggests. They have lost just two of their last 45 home games in all competitions, and while Lyon are fresh from beating Monaco last weekend, they have been beaten on their last four trips to the capital. Monaco are in the relegation zone as they prepare to entertain Guingamp, but Leonardo Jardim's side boosted morale with a 1-0 victory against Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League on Tuesday. ""The victory against Leverkusen was very important. It will give the players confidence, especially in Ligue 1,"" said Jardim. ""Now I hope we can build on it against Guingamp. Guingamp are a difficult team to break down but we need to win at home."" Leaders Lille are at home to sixth-place Montpellier, while Saint-Etienne go to Lens and former Chelsea star Florent Malouda could make his Metz debut against SC Bastia.

239,02/09/2014,01:13,Out of favour Amalfitano moves to West Ham,French midfielder Morgan Amalfitano signed for English Premier League side West Ham on Monday from Ligue 1 outfit Marseille where he had fallen out of favour with Argentinian coach Marcelo Bielsa.,"The 29-year-old -- capped once by France -- has already experienced Premier league football having gone on loan to West Bromwich Albion last season scoring four goals in 28 appearances. However, while he returned to Marseille in the close season he had a very public falling out with Bielsa -- the fiery Argentine calling a halt to a training session prematurely after Amalfitano turned up having been told to stay away -- and his only hope for playing this season was a move away. ""Olympique Marseille and West Ham have reached an agreement on Monday evening for the transfer of midfielder Morgan Amalfitano,"" Marseille announced on its website without disclosing the length of the contract or the transfer fee. Amalfitano had been at Marseille since joining from Lorient in June 2011, making 87 appearances and scoring seven times. Since Bielsa arrived in the close season several other senior players have been sidelined, among them Rod Fanni, Modou Sougou and Foued Kadir, with the latter two leaving on loan deals to Ligue 1 outfit Evian-Thonon and Spanish second tier side Real Betis respectively."
240,29/08/2014,22:45,Bielsa's Marseille in Mediterranean derby rout,Marseille appear to be finding their stride under new coach Marcelo Bielsa after outclassing Mediterranean rivals Nice 4-0 at the Stade Velodrome in Ligue 1 on Friday evening.,"A brace from Dimitri Payet and further strikes from Florian Thauvin and Abdelaziz Barrada allowed OM to make it two wins on the bounce and saw them move provisionally into third place in the table ahead of the rest of the weekend's games. Bielsa's methods had been called into question after Marseille took just one point from their opening two games of the campaign but they recorded a narrow 1-0 win at Guingamp last weekend and were far too strong for Claude Puel's Nice at the newly refurbished Velodrome. Payet, who Marseille had been keen to get off their wage bill this summer, opened the scoring in the 19th minute, slotting home after Andre Ayew's initial effort had been blocked by former OM defender Souleymane Diawara. Nice won away to their south-coast foes in Ligue 1 and in the French Cup last season, but they never looked like doing so again this time and they conceded again right on half-time, Thauvin being left with an easy finish into an empty net from Ayew's ball across the face of goal. The third goal arrived just three minutes after the restart, with Payet beating 'keeper Mouez Hassen with a diving header from Thauvin's flighted cross, and after substitute Romain Alessandrini had an effort cleared off the line, the hosts completed a convincing win with three minutes left. Hassen saved from Giannelli Imbula, but the rebound fell to Alessandrini, who cut the ball back for Barrada, making his debut after signing from Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates, to tap home. Monaco are at home to Lille on Saturday, while Sunday sees leaders Bordeaux looking to extend their perfect start to the season at home to Bastia before champions Paris Saint-Germain entertain Saint-Etienne in the capital."
241,23/08/2014,22:57,Gignac earns Marseille first win under Bielsa,Andre-Pierre Gignac ended Marseille's wait for a first victory under new coach Marcelo Bielsa as he scored the decisive goal in a 1-0 win at Guingamp in Ligue 1 on Saturday.,"Later, early pacesetters Bordeaux maintained their perfect start to the campaign under new boss Willy Sagnol with a come-from-behind 3-1 win at Nice. That lifted them up to nine points, two clear of Lille, 2-0 winners over Lorient, with Caen, 2-0 winners at Reims, Montpellier, who saw off Metz by the same scoreline, and Saint-Etienne, a point further back. Saint-Etienne, the only other team with maximum points so far, host Rennes on Sunday while last year's runners-up Monaco, rock bottom after two matches this campaign, will go in search of their first points of the season at Nantes. Marseille had made an underwhelming start to the new French campaign, taking a solitary point from their first two matches, but Gignac belatedly ignited OM's season as he struck right after half-time to maintain his fine form. The goal was Gignac's third in as many matches, provisionally putting him alongside Saint-Etienne forward Mevlut Erding atop the scoring chart, and bumped Marseille into the top half of the table with Guingamp dropping one spot to 14th. Despite the victory Bielsa lamented his side's inability to stretch their lead and put the game to bed earlier. ""The team defended well and started attacks well, but we lacked a bit of a cutting edge when we really threatened,"" said Bielsa, who replaced interim boss Jose Anigo in the close season. ""We had chances and the score doesn't reflect (our first-half performance),"" added the Argentine. Dimitri Payet was recalled to Marseille's line-up, in place of Romain Alessandrini, by Bielsa and the winger began brightly as he slipped in Florian Thauvin only for the latter to be repelled by Guingamp goalkeeper Mamadou Samassa. Payet then tried his luck from the edge of the area, bending a curling effort narrowly over the crossbar as Marseille asserted their dominance early on. A venomous long-range strike from Gignac forced Samassa to tip over on 20 minutes with Marseille's sustained pressure leading to the striker heading just wide from a corner shortly after. Guingamp defender Jeremy Sorbon was a relieved man after he diverted a Thauvin shot narrowly wide of the post but the hosts were caught cold within seconds of the restart after half-time. Payet was the architect as he floated a cross towards Gignac waiting at the far post and the striker drove a volley into the ground and across Samassa into the far corner to put Marseille ahead. Reynald Lemaitre came closest to an equaliser for Guingamp 10 minutes from time only for his fizzing half-volley to clip the crossbar while there was concern for Marseille as Gignac hobbled off with an apparent ankle injury just before the end. Sagnol's Bordeaux continued to impress, despite hosts Nice going in front through Alexy Bosetti in the 11th minute. But a Cheick Diabate penalty, and goals from Nicolas Maurice-Belay and Gregory Sertic secured the former champions all three points. Bastia put aside the loss of Brazilian striker Brandao, suspended for headbutting Paris Saint-Germain's Thiago Motta last weekend, to beat Toulouse 1-0, the decisive strike a 24th minute penalty converted by Ryad Boudebouz. On Friday PSG laboured to a 0-0 draw with Evian in Annecy as Laurent Blanc's side finished the match with 10 men following the second-half dismissal of Yohan Cabaye."
242,21/08/2014,14:23,Marseille sign young Brazilian on loan,Brazilian defender Alef signed for French Ligue 1 giants Marseille on loan from Brazil second division outfit Ponte Preta on Thursday.,"The 20-year-old -- who can also be deployed as a defensive midfielder -- will fill the vacuum left by compatriot Lucas Mendes, who signed for Qatari side Al Jaish. While Marseille did not confirm the deal the player took the time to thank his former employers. ""I would like to thank Ponte Preta for the time that I spent with them,"" he said. ""I will always hold this club close to my heart and I have a desire to return there one day."" Marseille, managed by former Argentina and Chile coach Marcelo Bielsa, are in need of a good result this weekend away at Guingamp after failing to win their first two Ligue 1 games of the season, including a 2-0 loss at home to Montpellier last weekend."
243,17/08/2014,19:29,Bielsa's Marseille jeered off in defeat,Marcelo Bielsa's first home game as coach of Marseille ended in a chorus of jeers after a deflating 2-0 defeat to southern rivals Montpellier on Sunday afternoon.,"A goal in each half from Anthony Mounier and Morgan Sanson handed Montpellier the points and left OM still looking for their first competitive win since Argentine Bielsa was appointed in the summer with the brief of reviving their flagging fortunes. However, it was a good afternoon for Saint-Etienne, who came from behind to beat Reims 3-1 at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard and are so far the only side to have won their opening two games of the new Ligue 1 campaign. Marseille's Stade Velodrome was holding its first game since work finished on a new main stand, completing refurbishment work done for Euro 2016, which France will host. A crowd of 53,000, including UEFA president Michel Platini, watched OM looking to claim victory after throwing away a two-goal lead to draw 3-3 in Bastia last weekend, but Montpellier put a spanner in the works when they opened the scoring in the 18th minute, Mounier lobbing into the net with Steve Mandanda off his line. As Marseille pushed forward in search of an equaliser in the second period, Bielsa took off Brice Dja-Djedje and sent on an extra forward in Michy Batshuayi, but they were hit on the break as Mounier's low cross was converted by Morgan Sanson in the 68th minute. A frustrating day for the hosts was summed up soon after when Romain Alessandrini crashed a shot off the post, and although Andre-Pierre Gignac then put the ball in the net, the effort was disallowed for a handball by Alessandrini. After holding champions Paris Saint-Germain last weekend, Reims took the lead in Saint-Etienne just before the half-hour mark when summer signing Benjamin Moukandjo, the Cameroon international, burst into the box and sent in a shot that deflected off Loic Perrin and into the net. They nearly struck again just before the interval, when Stephane Ruffier did well to tip a net-bound Gaetan Charbonnier strike over the bar. However, Reims hadn't won in Saint-Etienne in the top flight since 1959, when Just Fontaine scored a hat-trick in a 5-2 victory, and they will have to wait at least another year after Les Verts fought back in the second half. A brilliant Max Gradel free-kick from 20 yards brought the hosts level in the 61st minute, before summer signing Kevin Monnet-Paquet, formerly of Lorient, headed in a Mevlut Erding cross at the back post. Turkey striker Erding then put the seal on the win eight minutes from time, appearing unmarked to convert a low cross from the right by Romain Hamouma. Later on Sunday, Monaco will be looking for their first points under new coach Leonardo Jardim when they face Bordeaux away. On Saturday, PSG brushed aside SC Bastia 2-0 with Lucas and Edinson Cavani on target, but their win was overshadowed by the early loss of Zlatan Ibrahimovic due to a side strain and an after-match incident in the tunnel which saw Bastia's Brazilian striker Brandao headbutt Thiago Motta, leaving the PSG player with a bloodied nose."
244,13/08/2014,13:24,Marseille complete deal for Moroccan Barrada,French-born Moroccan international midfielder Abdelaziz Barrada on Wednesday finalised his transfer to Ligue 1 club Marseille from Al Jazira in the United Arab Emirates.,"Marseille confirmed that Barrada had turned down a move to Portuguese giants Porto in favour of signing a four-year deal at the Stade Velodrome. ""I see my long-term future at the club. I want to help OM to finish on the podium. That is where this club deserves to be,"" said Barrada, who started out at Paris Saint-Germain before making his name in Spain with Getafe. Barrada, 25, scored 15 goals in 34 appearances for Al Jazira last season. He joins as Brazilian defender Lucas Mendes moves to the Gulf, signing for El Jaish in Qatar. Barrada is Marseille's third signing of the transfer window after the arrival of winger Romain Alessandrini from Rennes and young Belgian striker Michy Batshuayi from Standard Liege."

He would become Marseille's third signing of the transfer window after the arrival of French midfielder Romain Alessandrini and young Belgian striker Michy Batshuayi."
246,09/08/2014,23:12,Makelele's Bastia hold Marseille to draw,Claude Makelele began his coaching career with a thrilling come-from-behind point in Bastia's 3-3 draw with Marseille on Saturday.,"Andre-Pierre Gignac scored twice for the visitors, who led 3-1, but Christopher Maboulou's own brace earnt a point for the Corsican hosts. Maboulou gave Bastia the lead on nine minutes with a spectacular volley but Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda seemed to let the ball go through his hands as he tried to punch it clear. Gignac's near-post header brought Marseille level before a comical own goal from Romaric put the hosts in front before half-time. Gignac extended the lead from the spot on 62 minutes after Sebastien Squillaci was penalised for handball. But just three minutes later, Junior Tallo reduced the deficit with a penalty at the other end after Benjamin Mendy was harshly adjudged to have brought down Maboulou in the area. Maboulou had the last word, though, with a close-range shot from an angle that slipped inside the far post to ruin Marcelo Bielsa's debut on the Marseille bench. Newly-promoted Caen made a bright start to their return to the top flight with a 3-0 win at Evian. The game was all but over by half-time after Ngolo Kante opened the scoring and Mathieu Duhamel added a brace. Nice won a thrilling battle with Toulouse 3-2 at the Allianz Riviera. Argentine forward Dario Cvitanich opened the scoring on 23 minutes but two goals in as many minutes just before the break from Denmark international Martin Braithwaite and Ben Yedder turned the game on its head. Cvitanich equalised just after the hour mark, though, and then Alexy Bosetti's pinpoint header on 68 minutes gave the Cote d'Azur side three points. A Mevlut Erding brace, the first from the spot and the second deep into stoppage time, gave Saint-Etienne a 2-0 victory at Cup winners Guingamp. In other games there were 1-0 wins for Bordeaux at 2012 champions Montpellier and Nantes at home to newly-promoted Lens. Lille and Metz, the Ligue 2 champions, played out a 0-0 draw. Champions Paris Saint-Germain kicked things off with a 2-2 draw at Reims on Friday night. Sweden star Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a brace either side of Reims goals by Prince Oniangue and Antonie Devaux. On Sunday Lyon host Rennes and Lorient travel to Monaco."

""It was a carefully thought-out decision. I liked what they had to say. They have a genuine sporting project,"" said Valbuena, who has signed a three-year deal with Dynamo which will earn him a reported 10 million euros (£7.9m, $13.4m) altogether. ""I am ambitious and I want to help them progress. I did not choose to come here by default,"" added the player who had no offers on the table from any of Europe's leading leagues with the reported exception of Premier League sides Queen's Park Rangers and West Ham United. ""It was a great offer, financially too, but also for the sporting challenge."" ""What makes me most proud is that I succeeded at OM,"" said the little 29-year-old, who joined Marseille in 2006 and helped the south-coast side win the Ligue 1 title in 2010. ""He has carried the team single-handedly in recent years,"" said Marseille president Vincent Labrune, before hailing ""a long spell, one of the longest in the club's history."" Labrune added that Valbuena's number 28 shirt would soon be retired in honour of the achievements of a player who also won the League Cup three times during his spell at the Stade Velodrome. Meanwhile, Valbuena, who has won 38 caps for France, said that helping Les Bleus reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Brazil last month was among ""the best moments of my career"". ""We were like 23 brothers. To be together for 47 days is not easy, especially when you are 23 guys, but there were never any problems, not one angry word. ""I think we have a squad that can go very far. We can do well at Euro 2016,"" which France will host, he added."

""We are all agreed that OM belong at the Velodrome, which is why I am so happy that we have come to an acceptable agreement."" Marseille were so unhappy with the initial cost quoted to continue renting the Velodrome - up to 10 million euros per year - that they had threatened to play their first 'home' game of the new Ligue 1 season, against Montpellier on August 17, at their opponents' Stade de la Mosson. But the striking of a deal means French football's best supported club can continue playing at a stadium they have called home since 1937.
