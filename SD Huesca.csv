0,06/02/2021,19:00,Gutsy Real Madrid come from behind,Real Madrid fought back on Saturday as Raphael Varane scored twice to complete a gutsy 2-1 win against bottom club Huesca and ease the pressure on coach Zinedine Zidane.,"An angry Zidane told reporters on Friday to show more ""respect"" after a poor run of results prompted many to suggest Madrid need wholesale changes this summer. His players responded by digging deep against Huesca, with Varane the unlikely hero, the defender twice finishing in the second half to seal victory after Javier Galan's stunning strike had put Huesca in front. Madrid were without a number of injured players including Eden Hazard, Dani Carvajal, Lucas Vazquez and Sergio Ramos, who the club said on Saturday has undergone surgery on his left knee. The team also had Thibaut Courtois to thank after their goalkeeper made an excellent save with the scores level, before Varane tapped in the winner. ""We are not comfortable, we were OK, but we have to build and go step by step until we're playing well again,"" said Zidane after the game. ""We have to get back to playing with happiness, playing like Real Madrid."" Zidane was back in the dug-out for the first time since testing positive for coronavirus. ""We won the league last year, not 10 years ago,"" Zidane had said on Friday. ""Us, Real Madrid. Show a bit of respect for that."" Yet Madrid have been a pale shadow of the resilient, determined side that stormed to the La Liga title at the end of last season. Their reward for this win is to reduce the gap behind leaders Atletico Madrid to seven points, with Atletico boasting two games in hand. Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman has already said it will be ""very difficult"" for anyone to catch Atletico but Real Madrid are capable of putting together a run that at least puts their rivals under pressure. Real also have a Champions League last-16 tie against Atalanta fast approaching and need momentum. ""When things are difficult, you show character,"" said Varane. ""It's a very important win, we have to change the dynamic. We have to win and improve the confidence. It's been a difficult time but we have to fight to the end."" After some early chances for Huesca, only Karim Benzema went close for Real Madrid in the first half. Huesca came out firing at the start of the second. They twice hit the crossbar as Mikel Rico lobbed Courtois but his effort was just too high and then Rafa Mir volleyed brilliantly at the back post but was also denied by the woodwork. In between, Huesca did take the lead as Shinji Okazaki broke down the right and pulled the ball back for Galan on the edge of the box. With Madrid players back, the chance appeared lost but Galan swerved a sumptuous strike into the corner off the post. Madrid, though, levelled just before the hour when Benzema's free-kick hit the crossbar and popped up, hanging in the air. Varane rose highest in a crowd to nod in. Huesca would have regained the lead had Mir's bullet header not been superbly saved by Courtois and Madrid pushed for a winner, Marcelo and Benzema both going close. With six minutes left, they found it. Toni Kroos' cross reaching Casemiro in the box and he had the composure to head across for Varane, who had an open net."
1,12/01/2021,16:36,"La Liga strugglers Huesca, Alaves sack coaches","La Liga's bottom side Huesca dismissed coach Michel Sanchez on Tuesday after a run of just one win in 18 games, while Alaves sacked Pablo Machin with the club barely above the relegation zone.","Huesca have lost four of their last five matches to fall six points adrift of safety following their promotion to Spain's top division for just the second time. Alaves parted ways with Machin following a poor series of results to leave the club in 16th place and only two points clear of the bottom three. Machin oversaw a 2-1 victory over champions Real Madrid in November, but his team has won just once in seven games since and only four times in the league all season. The former Sevilla and Espanyol boss had been lined up to take over at Qingdao Huanghai in China in July but pulled out for personal reasons, reportedly after one of his relatives contracted Covid-19. Alaves appointed Abelardo Fernandez as Machin's successor, the ex-Spain international returning to the club he coached from 2017 to 2019."
2,31/10/2020,16:17,Hazard stunner gives revived Real Madrid win over Huesca,Eden Hazard scored his first goal for Real Madrid in over a year and his team appear to turn a corner as they beat newly-promoted Huesca 4-1 in La Liga on Saturday.,"Hazard has had a terrible time with injuries since joining Madrid for 100 million euros ($113 million) from Chelsea in 2019 but the Belgian will hope his stunning strike from distance at the Alfredo di Stefano can kick-start his career in Spain. Karim Benzema and Fede Valverde made the win secure before Huesca scored through David Ferreiro, only for Benzema to add his second and Madrid's fourth in injury-time. Zinedine Zidane's side jump above Real Sociedad to the top of the table to cap an encouraging week, which began with a Clasico win over Barcelona at Camp Nou and finishes with them moving nine points clear of the Catalans, who play away at Alaves later on Saturday. In between, Madrid came too close for comfort to another damaging defeat in the Champions League but two late goals salvaged a draw at Borussia Monchengladbach that in the end felt like a win. Huesca, who are yet to win this season, might feel the scoreline was harsh after they squandered early chances. Madrid will hope the dip that put Zidane under pressure earlier this month is over. Zidane will have been particularly delighted with Hazard, whose goal was his first for Madrid since he scored against Granada in October last year, and his second overall in La Liga. Ankle surgery kept Hazard out for the majority of last season and he was not fit for the start of this one, with Madrid only describing his latest setback as a ""muscle injury"". But he made his first appearance off the bench in the Champions League in midweek and against Huesca marked his first start with a brilliant goal in the first half. Until then, Huesca had been the better team but Hazard's strike turned the contest in the 40th minute, when he received the ball on the half-turn and swerved a superb shot into the corner from 30 yards out. Benzema made it two, chesting down Lucas Vazquez's cross at the back post and driving in, before Valverde struck a sweet half-volley into the corner. Ferreiro gave Huesca brief hope with 16 minutes left but Madrid were never overly troubled and Benzema rounded off the win in injury-time, converting a smart header back from Rodrygo."
3,30/10/2020,12:23,Real Madrid aim to put crisis behind them with win over lowly Huesca,"Real Madrid will be hoping to leave their sticky patch behind them when they play Huesca in La Liga on Saturday, with an early six-point lead to preserve over Barcelona.","The resignation of Barca's club president Josep Maria Bartomeu has overshadowed what has been a dramatic week for Madrid, who barely salvaged a 2-2 draw against Borussia Monchengladbach in the Champions League on Tuesday. Trailing 2-0 with three minutes left, Madrid were facing a defeat that would have squandered the momentum gained from last weekend's Clasico win at Camp Nou. A late double from Karim Benzema and Casemiro ensured Zinedine Zidane's side snatched a draw that felt like a win but to consolidate that positivity, they cannot afford another slip this weekend. ""The team is what it has shown, it's about a reaction,"" said Zidane. ""The first half was very good, we played well. The pity is we conceded the first goal, but we continued to think it was possible, even at 2-0. ""That showed the character of the team and I'm very proud of them. We are not happy because we want to win, but we must be happy with the performance."" Madrid play a Huesca side that is yet to win this season, as they followed four consecutive draws with a 4-1 loss away at league leaders Real Sociedad on Sunday. Zidane could also hand Eden Hazard his first start since August, after the Belgian came off the bench in midweek. That was Hazard's first appearance of the season as he tries to overcome his latest injury setback, which the club have only described as a muscle injury. ""It's good. I'm here to play football,"" said Hazard on Wednesday. ""After two or three months off the pitch, I'm so happy. I just want to play football, that's why I'm here."" On the last-gasp draw in Germany, Hazard said: ""We showed great character, to be 2-0 down with five minutes to play, I think we could have scored one more, I could have scored one more, but I missed. It's not three points but it feels like a victory."" Zidane was determined to give Hazard time to recover fully and he believes the club will have to be cautious. ""He's just started playing. It is his first game after a long time away,"" said Zidane. ""The plan was for him to try to play but little by little is what we have to do."" A Madrid victory against Huesca could send them back to the top of the table, above Real Sociedad who are the only team to have retained top spot in consecutive rounds so far this term. Real Sociedad play away at Celta Vigo on Sunday, just before third-placed Granada host Levante and struggling Valencia play at home to Getafe. If Atletico Madrid win their two games in hand they will go top, with Diego Simeone's side away at Osasuna on Saturday. Barcelona, who beat Juventus on Wednesday, also have two games in hand but are seven points off the lead. Their new era without Bartomeu begins in La Liga away at Alaves on Saturday night."
4,13/04/2019,18:34,Much-changed Barcelona held by Huesca,"Barcelona held back for Manchester United by resting every outfield player possible on Saturday, including Lionel Messi, as La Liga's runaway leaders were held to a goalless draw by Huesca.","Goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen was the only one to keep his place at El Alcoraz as coach Ernesto Valverde made clear his focus is on sealing progress to the Champions League semi-finals after the 1-0 first-leg win at Old Trafford in midweek. Messi was left out of the squad completely while the suspended Gerard Pique posted a picture on social media of him watching the game on television, with a bowl of paella on his lap. The draw gives Atletico Madrid the chance to reduce the gap at the top of the table to nine points if they can beat Celta Vigo at home later on Saturday but, with six games left after this weekend, the difference is likely to prove irrelevant. For Huesca, who are bottom of the table in their first-ever season in Spain's top flight, a hard-earned point means they sit five adrift of safety, albeit having played a game more than those immediately above them. Their survival bid remains unlikely but alive. Malcom came closest to a winner, his shot hitting the post, but Huesca were good value for the draw and could even have snatched victory themselves in the second half. Messi left Manchester with a swollen nose and cheek on Wednesday after a clattering challenge from Chris Smalling but there is little concern about the Argentinian being fit for the return game at Camp Nou. Barca's huge advantage at the top of La Liga has afforded them the luxury now of prioritising success in Europe, the only issue perhaps for Valverde the small matter of maintaining momentum. Overall, they were better than Huesca but never really got out of second gear. Like Pique, Luis Suarez was also banned while Ivan Rakitic, Sergio Busquets and Clement Lenglet were among those rested. Ousmane Dembele came in after recovering from a hamstring injury and, after playing 67 minutes, his chance of a start next week would appear enhanced. Dembele came closest to a goal in the first half after a brilliant reverse pass from the talented Riqui Puig, one of a number of youngsters given a chance to impress. Another was Jean-Clair Todibo, who saw a header saved while Kevin-Prince Boateng, also handed a rare outing after his arrival in January, was unable to connect with a low Dembele cross. Huesca had their moments as Enric Gallego burst through but shot wide and then he wanted a penalty after Ter Stegen slid through the back of his legs to claim the ball. Malcom struck the post with a fizzing drive but despite Jordi Alba, Philippe Coutinho and Arthur Melo all coming on in the second half, Barca could not find a way through."
5,31/03/2019,23:00,Benzema saves Real Madrid blushes with late Huesca winner,Karim Benzema stopped Real Madrid's underwhelming La Liga season going from bad to worse on Sunday after firing a last-minute winner to hand the European champions a barely-deserved 3-2 winner over bottom club Huesca.,"Humbled by Ajax in the Champions League and dumped out of the Copa Del Rey by deadly rivals Barca, third-placed Real showed little signs of improvement in Zinedine Zidane's second game in charge but Benzema struck with a fine curling finish the to snatch the three points. Real move to within two points of second-placed Atletico Madrid, who hammered Champions League hopefuls Alaves 4-0 on Saturday in a match that saw Diego Costa score for the first time since November. However Real still lag 12 points behind leaders Barcelona, who are 10 clear of Atletico and heavy favourites to retain their La Liga after Lionel Messi fired them to their sixth league win on the bounce, 2-0 at home to local rivals Espanyol on Saturday, with a brace that took the Argentine to 31 league goals this season. Zidane's son Luca was given his second ever start between the sticks for Real but got off to the worst possible start, picking the ball out of his own net within three minutes after Cucho Hernandez lashed home Ezequiel Avila low cross. Isco levelled the scores in the 25th minute when he tapped home a Brahim Diaz cross after Benzema's low shot was well saved, but it was the away side -- playing their first ever La Liga game at the Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu stadium -- who went closer going into the break ahead. Zidane junior had to be alert to stop Damian Musto from glancing home a header nine minutes before the break, while Avila punched the ground in frustration in first half stoppage time after flashing a power shot over from the edge of the box. Real continued to disappoint in the second half but took the lead just after the hour mark thanks to Dani Ceballos, who bundled home the second after Gareth Bale's beautiful cross was headed back across goal by Benzema. Bale then missed a glorious opportunity to put the game beyond Huesca when he somehow put Alvaro Odriozola's low cross over the bar from just yards out. Huesca pounced on that awful miss to draw level when Xabier Etxeita powered home Moi Gomez's cross from a short corner. However Benzema was on hand to break Huesca hearts with his fine finish, which gives Zidane two wins from his first two matches back in charge. Earlier Valencia maintained their hopes of a place in next season's Champions League after Daniel Parejo's penalty on the stroke of half-time gave them a vital 1-0 victory at Sevilla. Parejo's spot-kick, which came after Ever Banega brought down Jose Gaya, extended Valencia's unbeaten run to nine matches and moves them up to sixth, level on 43 points with Sevilla and just three back from the final Champions League spot. That place is occupied by Getafe, who fell 2-0 at home to mid-table Leganes on Saturday and have to play the league's top three and Sevilla in their final nine games. Despite a slightly simpler league fixture list Marcelino's Valencia however have an all-Spanish Europa League quarter-final tie with Villarreal to contend with, as well as the Copa Del Rey final against Barcelona between now and the end of the season."
6,31/03/2019,20:59,"Zidane's son Luca starts in goal for Real, concedes early goal","Zinedine Zidane's son Luca got off to the worst possible start after starting in goal for Real Madrid against Huesca on Sunday, conceding within three minutes against the rock-bottom side.","Luca Zidane, 20, was helpless as Cucho Hernandez crashed a shock early opener into the top corner at the Santiago Bernabeu. The goal came moments into his second start between the posts for Real, ahead of injured first-choice stopper Thibaut Courtois and Keylor Navas, who has only just returned from international duty with Costa Rica. An Under-20 France international, Luca is the third Zidane to wear the Real Madrid kit, after his father and brother Enzo, who currently plays for Rayo Majadahonda in the Spanish second tier. Zidane also rested Raphael Varane, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos for the match against rock-bottom Huesca, as third-placed Real look to stay on the heels of local rivals Atletico Madrid in second."
7,29/03/2019,02:42,Real Madrid run-in assumes added importance as summer overhaul looms,Real Madrid are out of the Champions League and out of the running in La Liga but they might have more to play for than Barcelona and Atletico Madrid in their final 10 games of the season.,"Atletico's defeat to Athletic Bilbao before the international break means Barca sit 10 points clear in the league, their cushion allowing them almost complete focus on Europe, where they face Manchester United in the quarter-finals next month. Most alive then amongst the table's top three is perhaps the sense of renewal at Real, where Zinedine Zidane's reappointment has been quickly followed by reports of a summer overhaul and 500-million euro spending spree. Zidane has insisted his current squad should not feel on trial in these final two months but the speculation will not have been lost on his players, whose futures look increasingly under scrutiny. Potential targets Eden Hazard, Paul Pogba and Kylian Mbappe were the latest trio on the frontpage of L'Equipe on Thursday but Neymar, Sadio Mane, Christian Eriksen, Harry Kane and Matthijs de Ligt have all been mentioned too. ""We will change things, for sure, for the years to come,"" Zidane said at his unveiling earlier this month. ""We will have time to talk with the president and with the club about what we can do."" Madrid face Huesca on Sunday when Zidane's picks will offer another clue as to his thinking. His opening game against Celta Vigo a fortnight ago became something of a reunion for the old guard as Keylor Navas, Isco and Marcelo were all recalled, and delivered. Even Gareth Bale, whose relationship with Zidane was almost non-existent last season, started, and scored, to suggest his departure may not yet be a foregone conclusion. A strong finish, and pipping Atletico to second place, would preserve the feel-good factor but a surge to make Barcelona nervous seems unlikely. Barca are not only streets ahead on points but performances too, unbeaten in the league since November and with 12 goals in their last four matches, three of them against Sevilla, Real Madrid and Real Betis. Lionel Messi hitting his sparkling best has been key, with his freshness for the Champions League now a priority. ""Having Leo on your team makes you feel like you can face anything,"" said Gerard Pique after the win over Lyon two weeks ago. Messi missed Argentina's win over Morocco on Tuesday with a groin strain but was back in training with Barca on Wednesday while Luis Suarez also played a limited part in the session, having sprained his ankle before the ineternational break. Ernesto Valverde will want to be sure of the pair's fitness before fielding them against Espanyol on Saturday, particularly while Ousmane Dembele has a hamstring problem and Philippe Coutinho continues to disappoint. Atletico still have Barcelona to play at the Camp Nou next month but their focus is less on the chase than the recovery, after consecutive defeats to Juventus in the Champions League and then Bilbao saw their season unravel in in five days. Confirmation that Lucas Hernandez will join Bayern Munich in the summer has only deepened the deflation, with Diego Simeone now tasked with lifting morale and preventing an exodus of other marquee players, including Antoine Griezmann, in the summer. ""We have to keep fighting,"" Simeone said. ""Now is a time to look at ourselves and to improve."" Atletico play away to Alaves on Saturday, who are engaged in what appears to be a four-way fight for La Liga's last Champions Leaue spot. The position is Getafe's to lose but beneath Alaves in fifth, and gathering momentum, are Sevilla and Valencia. They play each other on Sunday."
8,09/12/2018,23:30,Bale snaps drought as Real edge past struggling Huesca,Gareth Bale ended a run of 802 minutes without a goal in La Liga as Real Madrid won 1-0 at bottom side Huesca on Sunday to climb back to within five points of leaders Barcelona.,"The Welshman struck his first goal in the league since the start of September to lift Real to a fourth win in five matches and move the European champions up to fourth place. ""He (Bale) and the rest of the team were all fantastic. He scored a great goal and it was enough to get the win,"" said Real coach Santiago Solari. ""His goal and the general character of the team were crucial in taking all three points."" ""It wasn't a game to remember, but if you want to win La Liga, you have to win these matches,"" the Argentine added. Bale put a halt to his longest spell without scoring in the league since joining Real as he expertly cushioned in a volley from an arcing cross by Alvaro Odriozola on eight minutes. Huesca winger Ezequiel Avila forced a brilliant stop from Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, the Belgium international punching the ball to safety midway through the first half. Bale nearly added to his haul on 25 minutes when his fierce drive from the edge of the area was tipped over by a scrambling Aleksandar Jovanovic. Gonzalo Melero should have levelled for Huesca right after the break only to nod wide of the goal despite having the whole target at which to aim. A swerving David Ferreiro shot drew another smart save from Courtois as Real withstood a spirited fightback from the hosts, but Bale continued to threaten and forced two further saves from Jovanovic. Courtois turned over a late Moi Gomez free-kick and Huesca, who slumped to a 10th defeat in 15 games this season, were denied a point when Dani Carvajal headed off the line from Christian Rivera. Elsewhere, Borja Mayoral salvaged a point for Levante with a stoppage-time equaliser in a thrilling 4-4 draw away to Eibar. Eibar, who beat Madrid 3-0 in their last home game, led 4-2 with 15 minutes to play after a quick-fire brace by Charles added to goals from Sergi Enrich and Gonzalo Escalante. But Levante snatched a draw as Tono halved the deficit before Mayoral struck at the death. Real Betis shot up to seventh with a 2-0 home win over second-bottom Rayo Vallecano following goals by on-loan Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Giovani Lo Celso and Brazilian centre-back Sidnei. Real Valladolid won for the first time in six games as Toni Suarez and Antonito found the net in a 2-1 victory at Real Sociedad."
9,07/12/2018,03:00,Real Madrid face last-place Huesca in battle of large and little,Luka Modric has been voted the best player on the planet and Real Madrid crowned European champions three times in a row but in Huesca on Saturday they will meet a team from the opposite end of the ladder.,"Madrid´s stars gathered in Paris on Monday, dressed in shiny black suits and bow-ties, to watch their midfield magician collect the Ballon d´Or, ahead of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. ""He is at his peak,"" Real coach Santiago Solari said. ""That makes it even more beautiful."" From the Grand Palais on the Champs-Elysees, they head this weekend to northern Spain and Alcoraz, Huesca's recently-expanded stadium with a capacity of just over 7,000, in a town of little more than 52,000 people. There, they face La Liga's bottom club, on seven points from 14 games, but Huesca's ascent began far lower down than that. The majority of their 58-year history has been spent between the third and fourth tiers. They were languishing in Segunda B as recently as 2015. Promoted to the top flight for the first time at the end of last season, Huesca prepared by overhauling their squad, but on a shoe-string budget, with a mix of players from the lower divisions, promising youngsters and old heads from abroad. They changed coach too, twice, after Rubi was poached by Espanyol, who are now seventh. He was replaced by Leo Franco, who only lasted until October. Then in came Francisco, who is yet to see a victory. Some of te promotion team remained, including top scorer Alex Gallar. He joined in 2017 after spells at Cultural Leonesa, Hercules, Cornella and Mallorca's B team, all four sides in the third tier. ""When I came here, it was not the main objective to go up to the top flight but we did it,"" Gallar said. ""It was a very good decision to come here."" One of his three goals this term came against Barcelona at the Camp Nou. Huesca scored twice there, including the opener, but Barca finished with eight. This, though, will be Huesca´s first time hosting either of Spain´s two grandees and a chance for the fans to ponder on how far their team has come. ""We have seen people are behind us despite the results and pushes us to turn it around,"" Francisco said last week. ""Our home has to be a fortress."" In the summer of 2013, Real Madrid bought Gareth Bale for a world record 100 million euros while Huesca signed seven players, all for nothing. Madrid are in good form and Bale, again, has a point to prove. He came off in the second half of last weekend´s win over Valencia, rubbing his thigh, while Santiago Solari said afterwards he was ""exhausted"". It was Bale's tenth La Liga game without scoring, even if that run masks some decent performances under Solari, including two goals and an assist in the Champions League. ""Bale is working well,"" Solari said on Wednesday. ""He's fine."" Real's victory over Valencia, on the back of beating Roma in Italy, means the 3-0 defeat to Eibar following the international break seems more like a blip amid six wins from seven matches. Despite changing coach this season, a scoreless drought that lasted more than eight hours and being thrashed by Barcelona, Madrid are only five point off the top. That they remain just about in touch is down to one of the most error-ridden title races in recent memory. Last weekend, Barca, Sevilla, Atletico Madrid and Alaves could all have finished the round in first but only two of the top six managed to win. Barcelona were one of them. On Saturday, Ernesto Valverde's side visit their Catalan rivals Espanyol. Atletico host Alaves, who have finished every weekend in the top six since round five. Sevilla are away to Valencia, a side that last season finished fourth but now sit 14th. Friday (all times GMT) Leganes v Getafe (2000)"
10,10/10/2018,18:00,Francisco Rodriguez handed mission to save rock-bottom Huesca,Former Almeria coach Francisco Rodriguez was on Wednesday named the new boss of rock-bottom La Liga side Huesca to replace the sacked Leo Franco.,"The 40-year-old's first match in charge will be on October 21 at home to Espanyol now coached by Joan Francesc Ferrer 'Rubi' who left Huesca in June after taking them to promotion. Huesca have just one win, two draws and five defeats from their opening eight games in La Liga."
11,09/10/2018,20:11,Huesca sack coach Franco in season's first Liga dismissal,Bottom-of-the-table Huesca sacked Argentinian coach Leo Franco on Tuesday in what was La Liga's first managerial dismissal of the season.,"Huesca, with just one win and two draws from their opening eight games, took on four-time capped Argentina goalkeeper Franco in June to replace Espanyol-bound Joan Francesc Ferrer 'Rubi'. But the 41-year-old Argentine, who previously played for Huesca, has paid the price for that poor run of results since the club were promoted to the Spanish first division."
12,02/09/2018,21:55,"Magical Messi, Suarez hit doubles in 8-2 rout of Huesca",A magical Lionel Messi and on-form Luis Suarez scored doubles apiece as champions Barcelona thrashed newly-promoted Huesca 8-2 to join Real Madrid at the top of La Liga on Sunday.,"Barcelona's third win of the campaign in as many games saw Ernesto Valverde's men go top thanks to superior goal difference over Real before the break for Nations League matches. Celta Vigo, who stunned Atletico Madrid 2-0 on Saturday, sit in third place at two points adrift with Atletico now five points adrift of the top after a shaky start to the campaign. Huesca travelled to the Camp Nou perhaps more in hope than belief, although it was the latter that dominated the Aragaon-based minnows' thinking in the early stages after Cucho Hernandez headed past Barca goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen to hand them a surprise third-minute lead. But reality soon kicked in, a slick Messi levelling in the 16th minute after leaving right-back Luisinho on the deck on his way to beating Argentine goalkeeper Axel Werner. Eight minutes later VAR was deployed to confirm an own goal from defender Jorge Pulido, who got his foot to Jordi Alba's cutback before it wriggled past Werner and into the net. Alba, recently left out of Spain's squad by former Barcelona coach Luis Enrique, was in the thick of it again on 39 minutes when he set up Suarez to put Barca 3-1 in front by the 39th minute with his maiden goal of the campaign. Although Alex Gallar pulled one back for the visitors three minutes before the interval when he turned in Hernandez's deflected cross to reduce arrears to 3-2, it merely delayed a second-half onslaught. Barca emerged from the dressing room to hit five goals, Ousmane Dembele starting the rout with an angled drive that beat Werner on 48 minutes. Four minutes later Ivan Rakitic's superb half-volley from Messi's delivery had the Camp Nou on its feet. Messi doubled his tally for the night on the hour mark to make it four in three games and completed his night's work by setting up Jordi Alba for a magnificent seventh nine minutes from the final whistle. Barcelona made it eight in the final seconds of the game when Suarez stepped up to beat Werner from the spot. ""It's always important to be top of the league but it's barely started,"" Suarez told beIN Sports. ""The championship is very long and the main thing is to keep on doing as we are."" Messi's haul of four goals means he is level with Real striker Karim Benzema, the Argentine star foregoing the opportunity to take the sole lead of the scoring charts when he allowed Suarez to hit the late penalty. With a question mark still hanging over his international career, Messi is expected to return from the international break rested having decided not to play for Argentina during the international break."
