0,02/02/2021,21:43,Fourth-tier Rot-Weiss Essen shock Leverkusen in German Cup,Fourth-division club Rot-Weiss Essen continued their giant-killing run in the German Cup on Tuesday by defeating last season's runners-up Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 after extra time to reach the quarter-finals.,"Jamaica international Leon Bailey put the Bundesliga team ahead in the 105th minute of the last-16 tie, but Essen levelled soon after with a goal from Oguzhan Kefkir. Unbeaten since February 1 of last year, Simon Engelmann scored the winner for Essen on 117 minutes as the lowest-ranked team left in the competition claimed another scalp following wins over Arminia Bielefeld and second-tier Fortuna Dusseldorf in previous rounds. Essen, who are currently second to Borussia Dortmund's reserves in the Regionalliga West, won the German Cup in 1952-53, the first edition of the tournament after World War II. Dortmund's first team threw away a two-goal lead but overcame second-division Paderborn 3-2 in extra time courtesy of a 95th-minute goal by Erling Braut Haaland. Emre Can and Jadon Sancho struck in the first half as Dortmund appeared to be cruising, but Julian Justvan gave Paderborn hope and Prince Oseu Owusu equalised from the spot deep into stoppage time. The visitors were awarded a penalty following a VAR review, which nullified an effort from Haaland. However, the Norwegian striker grabbed the winner in extra time after another lengthy consultation with VAR. Werder Bremen beat Greuther Fuerth 2-0. Bundesliga 2 side Holstein Kiel, who knocked out holders Bayern Munich in the last round on penalties, outlasted Darmstadt 7-6 in another shootout following a 1-1 draw. RB Leipzig host second-division Bochum on Wednesday, while Stuttgart play Borussia Moenchengladbach and Wolfsburg face Schalke. The draw for the quarter-finals will be conducted on Sunday, with the ties scheduled for March 2 and 3."
1,31/01/2021,18:36,Leverkusen sign winger Gray from Leicester,Bayer Leverkusen made their second signing from the Premier League in the current transfer window when winger Demarai Gray joined the Bundesliga outfit from Leicester City on Sunday.,"Gray, 24, was out of contract at Leicester at the end of the season and has signed for Leverkusen until June 2022 for a reported transfer fee of Â£2 million ($2.7 million). Gray is Leverkusen's third signing this month after defenders Timothy Fosu-Mensah from Manchester City and Jeremie Frimpong from Celtic. He will boost Leverkusen's options on the flanks alongside Jamaica winger Leon Bailey and French flyer Moussa Diaby. ""Demarai Gray is a tricky, very fast and assertive winger who will add extra life to our attacking play,"" said Leverkusen sporting director Simon Rolfes. ""He is able to solve one-on-one situations at high speed and use his teammates well."" Gray, a former England Under-21 international, has only played 18 minutes in the Premier League this season and wants to establish himself at Leverkusen. ""I saw how Leverkusen attack, act aggressively and dictate the game through possession. I'll fit in well there,"" he said. Under head coach Peter Bosz, Leverkusen were top of the Bundesliga in December. However, they have dropped to fourth after Saturday's 1-0 defeat at RB Leipzig, their third loss in four games. Gray was part of Leicester's 2016 Premier League-winning side."
2,29/01/2021,03:03,Hoffenheim plot new Bayern shock on Munich return,"As the architect of Bayern Munich's single defeat in 2020, Hoffenheim coach Sebastian Hoeness hopes to again down the European champions in the Bundesliga on Saturday when he returns to his former club.","Bayern host mid-table Hoffenheim at the Allianz Arena seeking revenge for September's 4-1 league defeat - their only loss of 2020 in any competition. The shock win over the European champions ""will certainly still be in our heads,"" admitted Hoeness, ""but we want to use this game to annoy Bayern again"". Bayern hold a seven-point lead in the table and are near full-strength with only Corentin Tolisso and Tanguy Nianzou sidelined. After poor results around Christmas, Hoffenheim are back up to 11th thanks to back-to-back 3-0 wins against strugglers Hertha Berlin and Cologne. However, the European champions are a huge test for Hoffenheim on Hoeness' return to Munich, where the 38-year-old coached the reserves last season having previously worked with Bayern's junior teams. A key factor Saturday is the form of Hoffenheim striker Andrej Kramaric, who has scored twice in each of his last two games. Leading the pack chasing Bayern, RB Leipzig host Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday night with both clubs eager to bounce back from defeats. After crashing 3-2 at second-from-bottom Mainz, Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann compared Bayern to Germany's high-speed ICE trains and his team to a regional train, struggling to ""catch up"". In order to get back on track, Leipzig must beat third-placed Leverkusen, who trail them by three points. ""The game has no direct influence on the title race - it's all about qualifying for the Champions League,"" Nagelsmann insisted Thursday. Leipzig welcome back Yussuf Poulsen after a groin injury, but playmaker Emil Forsberg is sidelined by a knee knock. Leverkusen, who crashed at home to Wolfsburg last weekend, are missing midfielders Julian Baumgartlinger, who underwent knee surgery on Monday, and Nadiem Amiri, who is quarantined after testing positive for Covid-19. Having slipped out of the European places to seventh, Dortmund host Augsburg on Saturday chasing a first win in four games. ""We have to correct mistakes from set-pieces,"" said caretaker coach Edin Terzic after Dortmund conceded three goals from deadball situations in a 4-2 defeat at Gladbach. Erling Braut Haaland scored twice in the Gladbach defeat, but Dortmund need him and England winger Jadon Sancho to fire their attack. ""When they (Augsburg) make mistakes, we have to be there - ice-cold,"" added Terzic. Eintracht Frankfurt, who are a point above Dortmund in the table and bouyed by a 5-1 thrashing of Bielefeld, are home on Saturday to Hertha Berlin, where Pal Dardai is back in charge. The 44-year-old replaces Bruno Labbadia, who was sacked following their 4-1 thrashing at home by Werder Bremen. Frankfurt striker Luka Jovic has scored three goals in three appearances off the bench since returning on loan from Real Madrid. Dardai predicts it could be ""5-4 or 6-5"" at Frankfurt, who ""score a lot of goals.... we're going there to score one more"". The Croatia striker scored twice in last September's 4-1 win over Bayern and has also netted two goals in Hoffenheim's recent wins against Hertha and Cologne. He is back in form after contracting Covid-19 on international duty last October which sidelined him for seven games. Kramaric will test Bayern's defence and his four goals in two games, ""speak for themselves,"" said Hoffenheim coach Hoeness. 76 - the minutes Luka Jovic has needed for three goals off the bench having been loaned back to Eintracht Frankfurt after failing to settle at Real. 18 - home league games since Bayern last lost at the Allianz Arena when Leverkusen managed a 2-1 win in November 2019. 1 - the single victory Hoffenheim has managed at the Allianz Arena, poaching a 2-1 win in Munich in October 2019.

3,19/01/2021,22:55,Diaby shines to down Dortmund,Moussa Diaby starred with a goal and assist as Bayer Leverkusen went second in the Bundesliga on Tuesday with a 2-1 win over Borussia Dortmund.,"French winger Diaby's early opener was cancelled out by a 67th-minute equaliser from Julian Brandt against his former club. Dortmund were left to regret a host of missed chances when Diaby then set up a superb goal by Leverkusen's 17-year-old midfielder Florian Wirtz for the winner 10 minutes from time. ""The second half was an open exchange of blows but we did well in the end,"" said Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz. The victory was Leverkusen's first in five league games and puts them second on goal difference, level on 32 points with RB Leipzig, who host Union Berlin on Wednesday. Leverkusen are four points behind leaders Bayern Munich, who are away to Augsburg on Wednesday in the Bavarian derby. The away defeat was a fresh blow to Dortmund's title hopes, leaving them seven points adrift of Bayern. ""We are not able to keep up the level needed for 90 minutes,"" complained Brandt. ""A lot can happen in 17 games, but we are far away"" from leaders Bayern in the table. As Dortmund captain Marco Reus put it bluntly, the title race ""did not play a relevant role neither before nor after the game"" for his team. Leverkusen took the lead in the 14th minute when they returned a clearance kick by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki, which was snapped up by Leon Bailey on the halfway line. The Jamaica winger put in a terrific diagonal pass to Diaby who sprinted away from the Dortmund defence and fired past Buerki on 14 minutes. Dortmund equalised midway through the second half when Brandt hit the far bottom corner from 25 yards out. He then squandered another chance moments later. England winger Jadon Sancho also fired wide as both sides had a string of chances. Diaby then did brilliantly to put Wirtz in enough space to steer the winner past Buerki. Wolfsburg are fifth, level with Dortmund on 29 points, after a 2-0 win at Mainz thanks to goals by Polish midfielder Bartosz Bialek and Dutch striker Wout Weghorst. Hertha Berlin have not scored in their last three matches as Hoffenheim earned their first victory in four games this year with a 3-0 win in the capital. Hertha's Polish striker Krzysztof Piatek had his early penalty attempt saved superbly by visiting goalkeeper Oliver Baumann. Sebastian Rudy put Hoffenheim ahead with half an hour played, then Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric added two second-half goals. Earlier, Borussia Moenchengladbach climbed to seventh with a 1-0 home win over Werder Bremen thanks to Nico Elvedi's second-half header. Gladbach dropped Swiss striker Breel Embolo for what head coach Marco Rose described as a ""senseless"" breach of the Bundesliga's hygiene rules. Embolo, 23, was dropped amid allegations he turned up at a private party, reportedly attended by 23 people, on Saturday. The event at a restaurant in Essen was broken up by police with Germany currently in lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. Embolo insists he was instead at a friend's house watching basketball, but his behaviour still violates the league's hygiene rules as players are not allowed to meet people outside their team's bubble during the pandemic. Embolo must now submit two negative tests for Covid-19 before he can train again with the Gladbach squad."
4,15/01/2021,22:46,Union down Leverkusen to climb to fourth,Union Berlin claimed another key Bundesliga scalp at home on Friday as a late goal sealed a 1-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen which put the hosts fourth in the table.,"Having hit the post earlier, Union's replacement forward Cedric Teuchert sprinted onto a pass which split Leverkusen's defence and fired home winning goal two minutes from time. The 24-year-old made amends for squandering a golden chance six minutes after the break when his shot beat Lukas Hradecky, smashed the post and rolled agonisingly along the goalline and away to safety. Having shocked Borussia Dortmund at the Alten Foersterei stadium four weeks ago, Union now sit just a point behind third-placed Leverkusen. The victory could have come at a cost as Teuchert replaced Union's Dutch striker Sheraldo Becker, who was helped off after just 24 minutes with an ankle injury. On Saturday, RB Leipzig can go top of the table if they beat Wolfsburg. A Leipzig win would bridge the two-point gap behind embattled leaders Bayern Munich, who host Freiburg on Sunday. Bayern are under pressure after last weekend's league defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach and the midweek German Cup exit at second division Holstein Kiel."
5,13/01/2021,18:45,Man Utd defender Fosu-Mensah joins Leverkusen,"Manchester United's Dutch defender Timothy Fosu-Mensah has joined Bayer Leverkusen, it was announced Wednesday, after a lack of first-team opportunities at Old Trafford this season.","The 23-year-old centre-back, with just over 100 minutes playing time in three games for United this season, has switched to the Bundesliga and joined Leverkusen on a contract until June 2024. His transfer reportedly cost Leverkusen around 1.7 million euros ($2 million). A product of Ajax's academy, Fosu-Mensah joined United in 2014, making 30 appearances, but has had few chances under Reds' manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer since recovering from tearing knee ligaments which sidelined Fosu-Mensah for most of 2019/20. The Dutch international, who in previous seasons had loan spells at Crystal Palace and Fulham, has not played since appearing in United's 3-2 defeat at RB Leipzig in mid December which saw them knocked out of the Champions League. ""Timothy Fosu-Mensah is a technically skilled, fast and physically strong defender who can be used both as a right-back and in the centre,"" said Leverkusen sports director Simon Rolfes. ""By signing him, we also have another top alternative for (right-backs) Santiago Arias and Mitchell Weiser"" both currently sidelined by long-term injuries. Leverkusen are currently third in the Bundesliga table, four points behind leaders Bayern Munich, ahead of Friday's Bundesliga game at Union Berlin."
6,01/11/2020,18:16,Alario double guides unbeaten Leverkusen past Freiburg,Argentina striker Lucas Alario continued his fine run of form with two crucial first-half goals as Bayer Leverkusen came from behind to beat Freiburg 4-2 in the Bundesliga on Sunday.,"After a disastrous first half hour for Leverkusen, Alario struck twice before the break to turn the game on its head and fire his team back into the top four. The Argentine now has seven goals from eight games in all competitions, and has found the net in each of his last three league appearances. Leverkusen, meanwhile, remain the only Bundesliga team yet to be beaten after the first six games of the season. Freiburg took the lead after just three minutes, Lucas Hoeler latching onto a 50-yard through ball from Lukas Kuebler and flicking the ball past Leverkusen keeper Lukas Hradecky. Jonathan Schmid doubled the lead with a brilliant volley five minutes later but the goal was annulled after Hoeler was ruled offside in the build-up. Leverkusen were bracing themselves for a long afternoon when Sven Bender was shown the red card for a trip on Hoeler in front of goal, but the decision was reversed by VAR. Having ridden their luck in the first half hour, Leverkusen ruthlessly took their chances from then on, with Alario turning the game on its head with two quick goals before half-time. The Argentine pounced on a misplaced pass from Nicolas Hoefler to slot home the equaliser, before turning in a low cross from Lars Bender to put Leverkusen ahead just minutes before the break. Peter Bosz's side looked to be in the clear when Nadiem Amiri smashed in a third on 65 minutes, but a tap-in from substitute Nils Petersen quickly brought Freiburg back into the game. Yet the home side's revival was short-lived, as centre-back Jonathan Tah rose high at a corner to head in Leverkusen's fourth and seal the three points. While Leverkusen return to the top four, Freiburg now sit just three places adrift of the bottom three, having not won since the opening day of the season."
7,03/10/2020,17:58,Haaland nets twice as Dortmund run riot,Erling Braut Haaland again demonstrated his deadly finishing by netting twice on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund climbed to second in the Bundesliga table with a 4-0 demolition of Freiburg.,"Dortmund bounced back from last weekend's shock defeat at Augsburg as Haaland shone to leave him on 21 goals in 23 games for Dortmund since his January transfer as the burly Norwegian claimed clinically-taken goals. Having also scored in Wednesday's German Super Cup 3-2 defeat at Bayern Munich, the 20-year-old Haaland has netted five goals in as many games this season. Dortmund were missing England winger Jadon Sancho and goalkeeper Roman Buerki, both recovering from illness having tested negative for the coronavirus. Club captain Marco Reus made his first start for eight months after a groin injury. US teenager Giovanni Reyna, who assisted all three goals, was outstanding alongside Reus in the attacking midfield role for Dortmund. The 17-year-old played Haaland into space for the burly Norwegian to score both his goals, then delivered a pin-point corner for Emre Can's headed goal. Haaland, 19, once again showed dazzling finishing when he fired home from a right angle on 31 minutes. Can then rose highest from a corner and his bullet header put Dortmund 2-0 up two minutes after the break. Reyna and Haaland combined again when they got in behind the defence as the American delayed his pass which the Norwegian hammered into the net on 66 minutes. Winger Felix Passlack claimed his first Bundesliga goal in added time to complete the rout with Haaland providing the final pass. Defending champions Bayern Munich host Hertha Berlin on Sunday out to bounce back from last weekend's shock defeat at Hoffenheim to end their 23-match winning streak. Eintracht Frankfurt top the league table after their 2-1 win over previous leaders Hoffeheim. Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric netted his eighth goal in four games with a superb strike, curled inside the far corner, to give Hoffenheim the lead on 18 minutes. However, Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada turned the game when he tapped home on 54 minutes, then powered through the defence before Bas Dost stabbed the ball over the line on 19 minutes from time. It could have been 3-1 as Frankfurt had a late goal disallowed. Champions League side Moenchenegladbach romped to a 3-1 win at Cologne as Alassane Plea and Stefan Lainer fired home before Lars Stindl added a penalty on 56 minutes. Cologne scored a consolation goal when Elvis Rexhbecaj beat Gladbach keeper Yann Sommer from 20 metres out. Bremen earned a second win in three games when Leonardo Bittencourt's right-footed shot on 27 minutes sealed their 1-0 win at home to new boys Arminia Bielefeld. The hosts survived a late scare as Bielefeld had a goal disallowed just before the whistle. Leverkusen were held to a 1-1 draw at Stuttgart as Patrik Schick's early goal was cancelled out by an equaliser by the hosts' striker Sasa Kalajdzic. On Friday, Union Berlin enjoyed their first win of the season with a 4-0 thumping of Mainz at home as Germany striker Max Kruse scored his first goal for the hosts."
8,30/05/2020,21:10,Lewandowski hits brace as Bayern Munich go 10 points clear,Bayern Munich opened a 10-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 5-0 drubbing of relegation-threatened Fortuna Dusseldorf behind closed doors with the league's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski scoring twice.,"Duesseldorf defender Mathias Joergensen scored an early own goal before Benjamin Pavard, Lewandowski (2) and Alphonso Davies hit the target. With five games left, Bayern, who have won their last eight league games, are comfortably on course for an eighth straight league title. However, second-placed Borussia Dortmund could trim their lead on Sunday at bottom side Paderborn. Several records fell as Lewandowski now has 43 goals in all competitions, a season's best for the Poland striker with games in hand. Also head coach Hansi Flick claimed his 22nd win in his first 25 games, bettering the start made by Pep Guardiola when he took charge in 2013. ""Statistics and records don't interest me, what's important is to have a successful season,"" said Flick, in his first season since replacing Niko Kovac in November. ""At Bayern Munich, you are expected to win. I am very happy, we were very aggressive and didn't give them any chances."" Lewandowski, who had never previously scored in six games against Duesseldorf, made amends with goals either side of half-time. Fortuna, who were unbeaten in their three games since the league resumed after a two-month coronavirus-enforced hiatus, were humbled at the Allianz Arena where they last poached a 3-3 draw in November 2018. They fell behind on 15 minutes when Joergensen turned the ball into his own net after Pavard mishit his shot. Right-back Pavard then grabbed the second with a powerful header on 29 minutes before Lewandowski made it 3-0 just before the break after being presented with a tap-in by Thomas Mueller. Duesseldorf were floored with two goals in as many minutes as Lewandowski profited again with another poacher's goal after Serge Gnabry's good work. Davies then scored the game's best goal. After some high pressing, the Canadian teen won the ball in the Duesseldorf area, barged past a succession of defenders and fired home to make it 5-0 on 52 minutes. Werder Bremen boosted their survival hopes with a 1-0 win at Schalke, who are winless in 11 games and continue to plummet. Midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt scored a first-half winner. ""This is a very, very important away win,"" said Bremen coach Florian Kohfeldt. ""We have taken seven points from the last three games, but if you look at the table, we are still behind."" Bremen have spent more seasons in the Bundesliga than any other club, but currently sit second from bottom. However, Saturday's victory leaves them just three points from guaranteed safety with six games left. They are two points behind Duesseldorf in 16th, which carries a relegation play-off at the end of the season. Werder could climb out of the relegation places for the first time since December on Wednesday if they beat Eintracht Frankfurt at home. Bittencourt hit a stunning strike from just outside the box which beat Schalke's Bayern-bound goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel on 32 minutes. Schalke succumbed to their fourth straight defeat, piling pressure on head coach David Wagner. In the same game, Schalke's American midfielder Weston McKennie wore a 'Justice for George' armband as part of the growing protests over the death of an unarmed black man during a police arrest in the United States. ""To be able to use my platform to bring attention to a problem that has been going on too long feels good!!!,"" tweeted 21-year-old McKennie. ""We have to stand up for what we believe in and I believe that it is time that we are heard."" George Floyd died in Minneapolis in an arrest by a police officer who pinned him to the ground for several minutes by kneeling on his neck. Hertha remain unbeaten with three wins and a draw since Bruno Labbadia took charge during the lockdown after their 2-0 win at home to Augsburg thanks for goals by Javairo Dilrosun and Krzysztof Piatek. Having routed Leverkusen 4-1 away on Tuesday, Wolfsburg crashed to a 2-1 defeat at home to 10-man Eintracht Frankfurt. Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada scored the winner 10 minutes from time while Frankfurt had replacement midfielder Lucas Torro sent off in the dying stages for a second yellow card. Frankfurt took the lead when striker Andre Silva converted a penalty on 27 minutes, but Wolfsburg equalised when right-back Kevin Mbabu headed home on 58 minutes. Hoffenheim are seventh after their 1-0 win at Mainz thanks to Ihlas Bebou who darted into the area, swept past two defenders, and fired home on 43 minutes. On Friday, Leverkusen went third when Germany midfielder Kai Havertz became the first player in Bundesliga history to score 35 goals before his 21st birthday to seal a 1-0 win at Freiburg."
9,29/05/2020,22:42,Havertz fires Leverkusen third with Freiburg winner,Exciting youngster Kai Havertz broke another Bundesliga record on Friday after scoring the winner in a 1-0 victory at Freiburg which moved Bayer Leverkusen into third place.,"Havertz, 20, became the first player in the history of the league to reach 35 goals before turning 21 years old eight minutes after the break, when he combined with Leon Bailey before squeezing home under intense pressure from Dominique Heintz. The dynamic German was already the youngest player to reach 50 and 100 appearances in the German top flight and became the youngest ever player to score a league goal for Leverkusen in 2017. Havertz's goal was his fifth in his four appearance since the Bundesliga returned from its coronavirus-enforced break and puts Leverkusen a point ahead of fourth-placed RB Leipzig, who travel to Cologne on Monday night. They are also three points ahead of Borussia Moenchengladbach in fifth ahead of their match with Union Berlin on Sunday. Havertz's goal was the first shot on target in a largely drab encounter in which Freiburg could have snatched at least a point. Lucas Hoeler missed a glaring opportunity for the hosts two minutes before the break, pushing wide when sent through one-on-one with Leverkusen stopper Lukas Hradecky. And chasing an equaliser late on, Nils Petersen forced Hradecky to save the three points for Leverkusen with a fine first time strike that the goalkeeper did well to tip away."
10,23/05/2020,18:45,"Not cut out for this! Gladbach crash in front of 13,000 'cardboard fans'","Despite having 13,000 cardboard cut-outs of watching home fans, Borussia Moenchengladbach lost ground in the Bundesliga title race with a 3-1 defeat at home to Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday behind closed doors.","With football fans in Germany locked out in a bid to halt the spread of the coronavirus, Gladbach fans have come up with a novel way of showing their support. Season ticket holders can have their cardboard lookalike allocated to their regular spot at Borussia Park. ""We have 13,000 figures mounted (on card), but we have had around 20,000 orders,"" said Thomas Ludwig, a Gladbach supporter over-seeing the fan project. ""Our volunteers were busy here on Friday."" On the second weekend since the Bundesliga restarted, the figures were spread out around the Gladbach stadium along with banners, some of which were protesting against games behind closed doors. Visitors Leverkusen also got in on the act with a handful of away supporters having paid 19 euros ($20.72) to have their cut-outs appear in the away end. However, the cut-outs couldn't inspire the hosts as rising Germany star Kai Havertz, 20, netted an early goal for Leverkusen and converted a second-half penalty. Gladbach forward Marcus Thuram pulled a goal back for the hosts but defender Sven Bender put the result beyond doubt when a late free-kick struck his shoulder but flew into the net. The result allowed Leverkusen to claim third place while Gladbach dropped to fourth in the table."
11,18/05/2020,22:31,Havertz stars as Leverkusen thump Bremen,Kai Havertz scored twice as Bayer Leverkusen ended the first round of Bundesliga matches in over two months with a 4-1 win at Werder Bremen on Monday which moved them within a point of the top four.,"The visitors went into the game only four points behind fourth-placed RB Leipzig after their fellow Champions League hopefuls' 1-1 draw with Freiburg on Saturday, when the Bundesliga became the first major league to resume during the coronavirus pandemic. Attacking midfielder Havertz, reportedly a transfer target for some of Europe's biggest clubs including Liverpool and Barcelona, was the star of the show at an empty Weserstadion. He has scored 12 goals in all competitions this season, having netted 20 times last term. It was Leverkusen's 10th win in 11 games, but their first since winning 3-1 at Rangers in the Europa League last-16 first leg on March 12. After a slow start to the game in an eery atmosphere similar to the weekend's matches, with all games being played behind closed doors, the encounter burst into life with three goals in five minutes. The 20-year-old Havertz nodded Leverkusen into a 28th-minute lead, before Bremen right-back Theodor Gebre Selassie levelled on the half-hour mark. But Havertz restored Leverkusen's advantage three minutes later with another header, from Kerem Demirbay's free-kick. Peter Bosz's side wrapped up a comfortable victory with second-half goals from Mitchell Weiser and Demirbay. The heavy defeat leaves Bremen stuck in the drop zone, five points adrift off the relegation play-off spot and nine from safety, albeit with a game in hand. Bremen have spent only one season, the 1980-81 campaign, outside the top flight since the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963."

His current deal was due to run out in June. ""We have had many good conversations with Charles in the past few weeks, whose wish to stay was absolutely what we wanted. Charles is a very important player for our team,"" said senior sports director Rudi Voeller.

Like all top European leagues the German top flight is losing income from broadcasting, sponsorships and ticket sales during the COVID-19 pandemic, with matches in Germany suspended until at least April 2. Bayern has a massive wage bill which reached 336 million euros (364 million dollars) last year, almost half of club turnover. Players at Borussia Moenchengladbach were the first in the Bundesliga to propose a pay cut, followed by others at Werder Bremen and Schalke 04. Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen players are in talks over pay cut proposals with management. At Dortmund -- second in the Bundesliga -- coach Lucien Favre has made a personal offer to take a pay cut while players are negotiating a 20 percent salary reduction if the season does not restart or a 10 percent cut if play resumes behind closed doors, when clubs will at least earn income from TV rights."

Saarbruecken goalkeeper Daniel Batz said that his side wanted to ""save Bayern for the final"". Nineteen-time champions Bayern Munich, who have appeared in seven of the last 10 German Cup finals and won five, will face Eintracht at the Allianz Arena. Frankfurt claimed a surprise 3-1 win over Bayern in the final two years ago. The ties will take place on April 21 and 22, while the final will be held at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 23."
17,04/03/2020,23:42,"Leverkusen, Eintracht reach German Cup semi-finals",Bayer Leverkusen came from behind to beat 10-man Union Berlin 3-1 on Wednesday at the BayArena to reach the German Cup semi-finals.,"Peter Bosz's side are looking to win the competition for only the second time in the club's history and join Bayern Munich and Saarbruecken in the last four. Marcus Ingvartsen gave the visitors a 39th-minute lead, arriving at the back post to meet Marius Buelter's cross and power a header into the bottom corner. But Union, who were Cup runners-up to Schalke as a third-tier side in 2001, were dealt a massive blow 19 minutes from time as defender Christopher Lenz was dismissed for a second yellow card. Leverkusen wasted little time in making Lenz pay, as Karim Bellarabi equalised just a minute later, drilling a low effort into the bottom corner after being played in on goal by Kai Havertz. The hosts completed the comeback as Chilean international Charles Aranguiz headed home Kerem Demirbay's 86th-minute corner before Moussa Diaby added gloss to the scoreline in injury time. Later Wednesday, Andre Silva and Daichi Kamada scored as Eintracht Frankfurt made the semi-finals with a 2-0 home win over Werder Bremen. Portuguese striker Silva scored the opener deep into first-half injury time from the penalty spot. Japanese star Kamada tucked away the second goal on the hour when he volleyed home a cross from Filip Kostic. However, Kostic will miss the semi-finals after being red-carded for a crunching foul on Omer Toprak. On Tuesday, holders Bayern Munich continued their bid for a treble of Bundesliga, Cup and Champions League titles by edging past Schalke 1-0, while Saarbruecken stunned top-flight Fortuna Duesseldorf on penalties to become the first fourth-division side to reach the semis."
18,06/11/2019,22:03,Costa's late winner sends Juve to Champions League knockouts,Substitute Douglas Costa's injury-time winner secured Juventus their spot in the Champions League last 16 on Wednesday after a 2-1 victory over Lokomotiv Moscow.,"The Brazilian winger struck a magnificent, last-gasp solo goal for the Italian champions after Aleksei Miranchuk had cancelled out Aaron Ramsey's fourth-minute opener. Juve are three points clear of Atletico Madrid at the top of Group D ahead of the Spanish side's game at Bayer Leverkusen, who will likely battle Lokomotiv for a Europa League place. ""We have achieved the first objective of the season. Lokomotiv were defending low but counter-attacked well in the first half,"" Juve captain Leonardo Bonucci said. ""We created a few chances and finally managed to earn the victory,"" he added. Juve's Maurizio Sarri substituted an angry Cristiano Ronaldo during the final 10 minutes due to knee and thigh problems. ""I replaced him just because I feared he could aggravate his injury,"" Sarri said. Lokomotiv coach Yuri Semin made one change from the weekend's draw at Ufa as on-loan Inter Milan midfielder Joao Mario came in for Murilo Cerqueira. Sarri brought in seven new faces from Saturday's Turin derby victory which included handing Wales midfielder Ramsey his first start for the club in the competition. Ramsey, whose appearances for his new side this season have been restricted by injury, opened the scoring early after Lokomotiv goalkeeper Guilherme fumbled Ronaldo's free-kick. Ronaldo fired his effort from the corner of the box straight at Guilherme who spilled the ball through his legs, allowing Ramsey to poke home from the goal-line on the greasy surface. The Russians equalised eight minutes later after Juve took their foot off the gas. Maciej Rybus whipped a cross towards Miranchuk who tapped in unopposed with Wojciech Szczesny on the floor after his header bounced back off the post. The equaliser seemed to inspire Lokomotiv and they could have taken the lead less than 10 minutes later. Miranchuk wasted a chance to double his tally after glancing his header over the crossbar from a chipped cross by Rifat Zhemaletdinov. Ronaldo troubled Guilherme from a set-piece once again three minutes into the second half, the Brazil-born Russia international nervously parrying away the long-range effort. Guilherme denied Ronaldo again nine minutes later sending the Portugal attacker's powerful shot over the bar with an impressive save. Ronaldo was substituted off for Paulo Dybala on 82 minutes with Sarri keeping an eye on Sunday's Serie A game against AC Milan, despite the former Real Madrid forward's frustration at the decision. Juve dominated the final moments and Costa clinched their sixth straight last 16 appearance with a tidy side-footed finish in injury time for his first Bianconeri goal since January."
19,05/11/2019,16:54,Leverkusen boss Bosz hoping for a Champions League miracle,"Despite three defeats in their first games, Bayer Leverkusen boss Peter Bosz is optimistic they can beat Atletico Madrid on Wednesday to kindle their slim knock-out phase hopes and pull off a Champions League miracle.","Defeats to Lokomotiv Moscow, Juventus and Atletico leave Leverkusen without a point at the bottom of Group D with only three games left. It has been more than 15 years since a team managed to progress in the Champions League despite losing their first three games when Newcastle United managed to finish second in 2002/03 group stages by winning all of their last three games. Nevertheless, Bosz wants a win over Atletico, who beat his side 1-0 in Madrid a fortnight ago and are level on seven points with Juventus at the top of the group, to belatedly kick-start their European campaign. ""The chance is small, but it is still there,"" said Bosz defiantly on Tuesday. ""There are still nine points available in the group. ""I am a fighter and I'll only say it's over when it really is. ""We want to stay in European competition after the winter break, so we need points."" After Atletico, Leverkusen face a tough away match in Moscow against Lokomotiv, then host Cristiano Ronaldo-led Juventus in their final group game. Having only lost to a goal by Alvaro Morata at Madrid in their last game, Leverkusen defender Sven Bender is cautiously hopeful of their chances against Atletico. ""We stayed in the game in Madrid, have what it takes to beat Atletico and we want to give everything to win on Wednesday,"" said the former Germany defender."
20,22/10/2019,21:25,Morata makes his point by scoring winner for Atletico,Alvaro Morata came off the bench and rescued Atletico Madrid when his late header gave Diego Simeone's side a gritty 1-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League on Tuesday.,"Morata, dropped after missing chances in Atletico's draw with Valencia in La Liga on Saturday, played as if he had a point to prove in a match-winning cameo at the Wanda Metropolitano. Victory leaves Atletico with seven points from their opening three games in Group D and on the brink of qualification, with only top spot seemingly to be settled, most likely with Juventus. For Leverkusen, three defeats from three all but ends their hopes of progress and continues a disappointing start to the season that also has them sitting ninth in the Bundesliga. Atletico have been on a poor run themselves, managing only two wins from their last eight games in all competitions and slipping to fifth in the league, behind both Barcelona and Real Madrid. This was hardly a performance to alleviate concerns, particularly about their fluidity in attack, but Morata's goal at least gets them back to winning and ensures their task in the group stage is almost complete. Simeone will have been worried to see his central defender Jose Gimenez forced off injured in the 15th minute. He who would appear unlikely to recover in time for Atletico's game at home to Athletic Bilbao on Saturday. When Mario Hermoso replaced Gimenez, it meant Atletico's defence was made up entirely of summer signings. When these sides last met in the last 16 in 2017, Leverkusen's Kai Havertz was unable to play because of school exams. The promising 20-year-old started up front on Tuesday but was starved of service. A frantic opening 10 minutes set the tone for a first half that was high on intensity but lacking either creativity or clear-cut chances. Costa almost pounced after Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky scooped up Angel Correa's shot but failed to keep hold of the ball. Otherwise, frustration grew. Costa lambasted Koke for a missed pass and Simeone castigated Kieran Trippier for losing possession and ignoring a simple ball inside. After half-time both sides were more ambitious. Costa could have scored, but failed to connect with a free header from Trippier's cross. Costa then felt he should have had a penalty when Sven Bender slipped and the striker stepped on the fallen defender's hand and went down. Referee Artur Dias waved away the appeals. Thomas Lemar and Morata came on for Correa and Koke, who was whistled as he departed, only for a furious Simeone to order the fans to clap, which most of them duly did. Both substitutes were involved in the winner. Lemar drove through midfield and played the ball left to Renan Lodi, who curved a brilliant cross to the near post, where Morata powered in, his header too strong for Hradecky's right hand. Morata celebrated by running to the bench. He was feral in the remaining minutes, rampaging at Leverkusen's back-line, blocking off as many clearances as he could. Kevin Volland had Leverkusen's only sniff of an equaliser but his finish was blocked and Atletico held on."
21,18/10/2019,22:37,Leverkusen blow chance to go top with Frankfurt loss,Goncalo Paciencia scored twice in the first half as Eintracht Frankfurt beat Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 on Friday to deny the visitors the chance to move top of the Bundesliga.,"The Portuguese forward fired Frankfurt ahead inside five minutes as he latched on to a Danny Da Costa pass and held off two defenders to stroke the ball under Lukas Hradecky. Paciencia won a penalty on the quarter-hour when his shot was blocked by the hands of a sliding Aleksandar Dragovic, rolling home the spot-kick to double the lead for the hosts. Eintracht goalkeeper Frederik Ronnow, deputising for the injured Kevin Trapp, kept Leverkusen at bay with a string of stops from Karim Bellarabi, Lucas Alario and Kai Havertz. Leverkusen were awarded a penalty midway through the second half for an apparent handball by Djibril Sow but the decision was correctly overturned following a VAR review. Dutch striker Bas Dost wrapped up the victory for Frankfurt 10 minutes from time as he brushed off Dragovic to net his third league goal of the season. Eintracht moved level with Leverkusen as part of a cluster of six teams on 14 points, two adrift of leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach. Marco Rose's Gladbach go to Borussia Dortmund on Saturday while second-placed Wolfsburg travel to RB Leipzig. Defending champions Bayern Munich will attempt to bounce back from a 2-1 loss at home to Hoffenheim when they visit Bavarian neighbours Augsburg."
22,01/10/2019,23:25,Ronaldo scores as Juventus brush aside Leverkusen,"Cristiano Ronaldo scored his first goal in this season's Champions League, sealing a 3-0 win for Juventus over Bayer Leverkusen in their Group D game in Turin on Tuesday.","Ronaldo blasted in the third goal in the 89th minute to extend his record to 127 strikes in the competition to add to Gonzalo Higuain and Federico Bernardeschi's earlier efforts. Juventus move top of Group D, level on four points with Atletico Madrid, who defeated Lokomotiv Moscow 2-0 in Russia. The Italian champions had been held 2-2 by the Spaniards at the Wanda Metropolitano in their opener. Leverkusen face an uphill battle after their shock 2-1 defeat at home against Lokomotiv Moscow and are rooted to the foot of the table. Juventus next host Lokomotiv and Leverkusen travel to Atletico on October 22. Maurizio Sarri opted for Higuain and Bernardeschi up front alongside five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo. Leverkusen were struggling from the outset after losing captain Lars Bender in the warm-up to a thigh problem, with defender Mitchell Weiser stepping in. The Germans showed little to threaten the hosts, with Lucas Alario shooting over on three minutes with what would be their best chance of the game. The breakthrough came for Juventus when Leverkusen defender Jonathan Tah failed to head clear Juan Cuadrado's long ball for Higuain, with the Argentine pouncing to drill home. The 31-year-old Higuain, back in Turin after loan spells at AC Milan and Chelsea, had a chance for a second on 38 minutes but was denied by Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky. Juventus piled on the pressure after the break as Ronaldo tried unsuccessfully to pull off an overhead kick in the 55th minute. Ronaldo then sent Higuain in behind, but although the Portuguese failed to connect with his teammate's return pass, Bernardeschi was lurking to provide the finishing touch. Juventus almost had a third with Hradecky failing to control the ball and almost turning it into his own net before grappling to save on the line. But the Finnish international did well to deny Ronaldo in front of goal after a Higuain charge down the flank. Welsh international Aaron Ramsey was introduced in place of Bernardeschi with Dybala replacing Higuain for the final ten minutes. And in the dying minutes, substitute Rodrigo Bentancur picked out Dybala who slid the ball through for Ronaldo, allowing the 34-year-old to equal Real Madrid great Raul's record of scoring against 33 different sides in the Champions League."
23,28/09/2019,21:00,Lewandowski hailed for 'extreme goals quota' as Bayern go top,"Record-breaking Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski was hailed for his ""extreme quota of goals"" on Saturday as the defending German champions warmed up for their European duel against Tottenham with a nervy win at strugglers Paderborn which took them to the top of the Bundesliga.","Lewandowski became the first player in Bundesliga history to score 10 goals in the first six games to seala 3-2 victory at bottom club Paderborn. While Bayern squeezed past Paderborn, Leipzig were shocked 3-1 at home to Schalke to surrender top spot. Bayern took full advantage to claim first place before Tuesday's key Champions League clash at Spurs, but not before conceding two second-half goals. Philippe Coutinho, who is rebooting his career on loan in Munich after an unhappy stint at Barcelona, played a key role by setting up Serge Gnabry's opening goal with a sublime first-half pass. Having scored his first Bayern goal the week before in a rout of Cologne, the Brazilian playmaker tapped home Gnabry's neat pass after the break before substitute Kai Proeger pulled a goal back for Paderborn. With time almost up, Lewandowski showed great finishing prowess to put away a Niklas Suele pass and make it 3-1, becoming the first Bayern player to score in each of the first six matches of the season. He is also the first Bundesliga player to reach 10 goals after the first six games. ""It's an extreme quota, which helps when they decide games like that,"" said midfielder Joshua Kimmich of Lewandowski's goal haul. ""To have ten already is something else."" There were, however, nervous looks in Bayern's ranks during the final ten minutes after Paderborn defender Jamilu Collins beat Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer from 30 metres out. ""We didn't finish them off,"" admitted Gnabry. ""In the second half, we had so many goal opportunities to decide the game, but our finishing was missing. ""Tottenham will be a completely different game and, of course, we must improve, but I think we can do well there."" In Leipzig, Morocco international midfielder Amine Harit inspired Schalke to an impressive away win, winning and drilling home a penalty, then setting up a first Bundesliga goal for Welsh teenager Rabbi Matondo. The Royal Blues raced into a 2-0 lead with first-half goals as Senegalese centre-back Salif Sane headed home from a corner on 29 minutes before Harit's penalty. The referee took a long look at the replays after Harit went down after the faintest of contact from Mali defender Amadou Haidara. Schalke, under ex-Huddersfield coach David Wagner, made sure of the three points when Matondo claimed his first Bundesliga goal since joining from Manchester City. Harit again did the damage, punishing a mistake in midfield then putting in a well-timed pass which sent Liverpool-born Matondo away to fire home on 58 minutes. Emil Forsberg's consolation goal came too late for Leipzig. The shock result shook up the table with Bayern now top, Leipzig drop to second and Schalke jumped from fifth to third. Questions about Borussia Dortmund's mentality will again be raised after more defensive lapses in their 2-2 draw at home to Werder Bremen left them seventh. Milot Rashica gave Bremen an early lead at Signal Iduna Park, but Germany pair Mario Goetze and Marco Reus both scored with headers to put Dortmund 2-1 up at half-time. However, Werder claimed a point when Marco Friedl poked the ball home ten minutes into the second half. The disappointing draw comes after Dortmund skipper Reus was left fuming after his side leaked a late own goal in last Sunday's 2-2 at mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt. ""We should have had a third goal and conceding their final goal really hurts. We didn't play well,"" said Reus after the Bremen defeat. Borussia Moenchengladbach went fourth as goals from French strikers Alassane Plea and Marcus Thuram sealed a 2-0 victory at Hoffenheim. Bayer Leverkusen are just behind them in fifth thanks to late goals from forwards Kevin Volland and Kai Havertz that added to a Florian Niederlechner's first half own goal in a 3-0 win at Augsburg."
24,17/03/2019,16:40,"Bremen duo Kruse, Rashica shock buoyant Leverkusen",Werder Bremen forwards Max Kruse and Milot Rashica combined to arrest Bayer Leverkusen's charge up the Bundesliga table by scoring the goals in Sunday's shock 3-1 away victory.,"Between them, Bremen centre-forward Kruse and winger Rashica are on fire with six goals and three assists in the last four league games and the duo did the damage against Leverkusen. Bremen captain Kruse gave his mid-table side the lead on 13 minutes at Leverkusen's BayArena, hitting the bottom corner after good play in the build-up by midfielder Maximilian Eggestein, in the Germany squad for the first time for Wednesday's home friendly against Serbia. Under new coach Peter Bosz, Leverkusen have shot up from mid-table to sixth and the Europa League places by winning six of their last seven league games, but with playmaker Kai Havertz benched for the first half, they struggled. Bremen doubled their lead on 37 minutes when Kruse played Rashica into the box and the 22-year-old winger grabbed his third goal in two games after a brace in last week's 4-2 rout of Schalke. At 2-0 down, Havertz came on for the second half, but despite his linking up with Germany winger Julian Brandt, Bremen's defence held up in open play. Leverkusen's dead ball expert Leon Bailey blasted home a free-kick on 75 minutes, but with the hosts hunting an equaliser, Bremen counter-attacked deep in added time. An adventurous dribble by Bailey broke down on the edge of the Bremen box and the ball was moved quickly upfield as Kruse cut in to drill home their third goal in the 95th minute. The result lifts Bremen to eighth and leaves Leverkusen sixth, just five points from the Champions League places with eight rounds of matches left."
25,04/05/2018,02:10,Hamburg adopt knock-out mentality for survival fight,"Midfielder Lewis Holtby says Hamburg must treat Saturday's match at Eintracht Frankfurt as ""a cup semi-final"" if they want to avoid a historic first relegation from the Bundesliga.","Second-bottom Hamburg are five points from safety with two league games left -- at Eintracht Frankfurt and then at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach -- as they bid to avoid slipping out of the top flight for the first time. But they sit just two points behind Wolfsburg, who occupy 16th place, which provides the solace of a relegation play-off against the team who finish third in the second tier. Holtby says, from a Hamburg perspective, those remaining games against clubs fighting for European places next season are effectively knock-out matches. ""This is our 'semi-final',"" said Holtby, who has scored four goals in Hamburg's last five games to breathe life into their survival hopes. ""We aren't dead yet. I believe 100 percent that we can rescue things."" Hamburg are the only club to have played in every season since the Bundesliga was established in 1963 -- when even mighty Bayern Munich were still a second-division club. A seven-point gap at the start of April has been slashed by wins over fellow strugglers Freiburg, 1-0 at home a fortnight ago, and Wolfsburg, 3-1 away last Saturday. Three wins in their last four games have given belief to Hamburg's players and fans alike, but they need Wolfsburg to drop more points. Moreover, they are facing a Frankfurt side eager to bounce back from a 4-1 mauling at champions Bayern Munich, which followed a 3-0 home defeat by Hertha Berlin. ""We have not achieved anything yet, if we want to get over the line, then we need further victories,"" said Christian Titz, Hamburg's third coach since January. Hamburg have fallen on hard times in recent seasons, needing to win the relegation play-off in both 2013/14 and 2014/15 to stay up. This season has been a disaster. Hamburg were second from bottom with 15 points from 19 games when Markus Gisdol was sacked as head coach in late January. Former player Bernd Hollerbach took over, but was soon dismissed after failing to win any of his seven games, admitting ""we need a miracle"". Titz was promoted from the reserves and the 47-year-old has coaxed three wins from his six games to turn the corner. ""We are playing a totally different style of football, the coach has his own ideas and sticks to them,"" enthused midfielder Aaron Hunt. Hamburg need Wolfsburg to slip up either this Saturday at RB Leipzig, who are winless in their last five games and fighting to keep a Europa League place, or at home to Cologne, who are already relegated. Having already had their relegation confirmed last weekend, bottom side Cologne host champions Bayern Munich, who are licking their wounds after their agonising Champions League exit in midweek. Bayern, who sealed a sixth straight league title last month, hold a massive 24-point lead in the table. Coach Jupp Heynckes is sure to rotate after they drew 2-2 at Real Madrid on Wednesday to lose their Champions League semi-final 4-3 on aggregate. Saturday's fixtures (all 1330 GMT) Borussia Dortmund v Mainz, RB Leipzig v Wolfsburg, Cologne v Bayern Munich, Werder Bremen v Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Moenchengladbach v Freiburg, Eintracht Frankfurt v Hamburg, Augsburg v Schalke, Hanover 96 v Hertha Berlin, Stuttgart v Hoffenheim"
26,24/07/2017,22:46,West Ham snap up Mexico star Hernandez,"West Ham have completed the signing of former Real Madrid and Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez for Â£16 million ($20.8 million, 17.9 million euros), the Premier League club said on Monday.","A deal to bring Mexico's record goalscorer to London Stadium was hammered out several days ago. Hernandez has penned a three-year contract and will fly out to Germany in the coming days to join up with West Ham coach Slaven Bilic and his new team-mates. ""I am very happy to join West Ham United. For me, the Premier League is the best league in the world and when the opportunity came, I was desperate to sign for this club,"" said Hernandez, who will sport the name Chicharito on his jersey. The move follows the arrivals of England goalkeeper Joe Hart and Argentine defender Pablo Zabaleta from Man City, as well as Austrian winger Marko Arnautovic from Stoke in a club-record deal. ""He has a proven goalscoring record in the Premier League, La Liga and the Bundesliga, as well in the UEFA Champions League and at international level with Mexico,"" club joint-chairman David Sullivan said. Hernandez, now 29, spent four seasons with United, where he scored 59 goals in 156 appearances, before going on loan to Real Madrid in the 2014/15 campaign. The two-time Premier League winner left Old Trafford in August 2015 for Germany, where he was even more prolific, netting 39 times in 76 matches for Bayer Leverkusen."
27,20/07/2017,17:35,Hammers agree terms with Leverkusen for Chicharito,West Ham United confirmed on Thursday that they've reached an agreement with Bayer Leverkusen to sign former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez.,"The Premier League side have been chasing the 29-year-old throughout the summer, and they've now agreed a fee of around Â£16 million ($20.8 million, 17.9 million euros) with the Bundesliga club to bring Mexico's record goalscorer to London Stadium. The former Manchester United frontman -- widely known by the nickname Chicharito -- will fly to London in the coming days for a medical and to discuss personal terms ahead of his anticipated return to English football. Hernandez spent four seasons with United, where he scored 59 goals in 156 appearances, before going on loan to Real Madrid in the 2014/15 campaign. The two-time Premier League winner left Old Trafford in August 2015 for Germany, where he's been even more prolific, netting 39 times in 76 matches for Leverkusen. The Hammers look set to make it three major signings in a week after bringing in goalkeeper Joe Hart on loan, while Austria forward Marko Arnautovic is due to complete his move from Stoke City once he passes a medical."
28,03/07/2017,21:31,AC Milan sign Turkey's Calhanoglu,AC Milan's busy recruitment drive saw them add Turkish international playmaker Hakan Calhanoglu to their roster on Monday on a four-year deal from German outfit Bayer Leverkusen.,"Calhanoglu has not played since picking up a six month ban in February over his illicit 2011 move to Leverkusen at the expense of Turkish outfit Trabzonspor, who took the case th FIFA. But the 23-year-old with 26 caps for Turkey passed a medical and signed with Milan on Monday. AC Milan have already signed Argentine defender Mateo Musacchio from Villarreal, Ivory Coast midfielder Franck Kessie, left-sided Swiss defender Ricardo Rodriguez from Wolfsburg, Portuguese centre-forward Andre Silva from Porto and Italian striker Fabio Borini on loan from Sunderland. AC Milan, the seven-time European champions, who were recently sold by long-time owner Silvio Berlusconi to a Chinese consortium, finished sixth in Serie A last season to secure a place in next season's Europa League."
29,23/04/2017,18:04,Freiburg stun Leverkusen in hunt for Euro berth,Unfancied Freiburg continued their dream run to a place in Europe next season with a shock 2-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday in the Bundesliga.,"The result puts Freiburg, last season's second division champions, back up into sixth place, which carries a Europa League berth next season, with four games left. Christian Streich's youthful team claimed another big scalp after recent wins over Cologne, Eintracht Frankfurt and Wolfsburg. Ex-Bayern Munich striker Nils Petersen gave hosts Freiburg the lead at their Schwarzwald Stadion before Germany forward Kevin Volland converted a second-penalty for Leverkusen. But the hosts picked up the three points when winger Pascal Stenzel, on loan from Borussia Dortmund, came off the bench to finish a counter-attack. The 21-year-old hit the winner when he drilled the ball past Leverkusen's Germany goalkeeper Bernd Leno two minutes from time after a brilliant run down the left wing. It was another disappointing result for Leverkusen, who reached the Champions League last 16 this season, but have won just one of their last ten games and are 12th -- only four points from the bottom three. On Saturday, Thiago Alcantara's second-half equaliser rescued Bayern Munich in their 2-2 draw at home to Mainz as the runaway leaders twice came from behind. Having bowed out of the Champions League quarter-finals at Real Madrid in midweek, the draw caps a week to forget for Bayern, who are winless in their last four games. Mainz twice took the lead in Munich as ex-Barcelona midfielder Bojan Krkic netted an early goal and Daniel Brosinski's converted a second-half penalty, but strikes by Arjen Robben and Thiago gave Bayern a point. Second-placed RB Leipzig can cut Bayern's lead to six points by winning at Schalke on Sunday evening. It was a poor performance from double-chasing Bayern ahead of Wednesday's German Cup semi-final at home to Borussia Dortmund. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the league's top-scorer, hit his 27th league goal this season as Raphael Guerreiro headed the winner in Borussia Dortmund's 3-2 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach to climb to third. Gabon hot-shot Aubameyang crept one goal ahead of Bayern's Robert Lewandowski in the race to be the league's top-scorer this season."
30,02/04/2017,20:17,Gomez hits rapid treble in six-goal thriller,Mario Gomez netted a hat-trick inside seven minutes as Wolfsburg fought back from two goals down to take the lead before Bayer Leverkusen salvaged a point in Sunday's 3-3 draw.,"Germany striker Gomez has now scored six goals in his last four games in the Bundesliga. The 31-year-old struck his first goal at the BayArena on 80 minutes to spark Wolfsburg's dramatic fightback, with his team trailing after Karim Bellarabi and Kevin Volland had scored for Leverkusen. Gomez headed in his second from a corner three minutes later and then drilled home an 87th-minute penalty to put Wolfsburg 3-2 up and leave the hosts stunned. But 17-year-old Leverkusen starlet Kai Havertz, who is currently taking his pre-university exams, smashed home a dramatic equaliser with a minute to play. ""We can't be happy with the point, I thought we deserved the win, especially after the way we played in the last 20 minutes,"" fumed Gomez. ""But the three goals we conceded were down to three individual mistakes."" The result leaves Wolfsburg, the 2009 German league champions, just a point above the relegation places with Leverkusen only two points better off. Earlier, 17th-placed Ingolstadt breathed life into their survival fight as goals by defenders Roman Bregerie and Florent Hadergjonaj sealed a crucial 2-1 home win against Mainz. It was Ingolstadt's first victory since mid-February to end a five-match winless streak and comes before next week's crucial matches against their relegation rivals. Ingolstadt are second from bottom in Germany's top flight, seven points adrift of Augsburg in 16th place -- which leads to a two-legged play-off to stay up. The timing of Ingolstadt's victory is perfect ahead of Wednesday's crunch match at Augsburg and Saturday's home tie against bottom side Darmstadt. French centre-back Bregerie gave Ingolstadt an early lead with a header after 10 minutes from a corner. Mainz equalised when midfielder Levin Oztunali drilled home a long-range free-kick on 70 minutes, but the scores were level for just three minutes. Swiss winger Hadergjonaj delivered a swift response for Ingolstadt when his intended cross flew over Mainz goalkeeper Jonas Loessl and into the net. ""I am an honest bloke and I just wanted to put in a good cross as I saw one of our players in the middle,"" Hadergjonaj told Sky, after netting his first Bundesliga goal. ""The ball just kept on flying and the fact it was the winning goal just makes it even better. ""We haven't had much luck in the last few weeks, so it was nice that it was on our side for a change."" The defeat dragged Mainz into the relegation battle, leaving them 14th and only clear of the bottom three on goal difference having lost eight out of their last nine away games. At the other end of the table, runaway leaders Bayern Munich remained 13 points clear after their 6-0 thrashing of Augsburg as striker Robert Lewandowski hit his third Bundesliga hat-trick this season. Lewandowski, last season's Bundesliga top scorer, has 24 league goals this campaign, just like Aubameyang, who scored for Borussia Dortmund in their 1-1 draw at Schalke in the Ruhr Valley derby. The Poland international has now scored 36 goals in all competitions for Bayern this season. Lewandowski also proved he can provide goals by setting up Thomas Mueller for Bayern's second, his backheel then let Thiago Alcantara stab home their fourth. Second-placed RB Leipzig bounced back from back-to-back defeats with a 4-0 romp against lowly Darmstadt, who had midfielder Sandro Sirigu sent off. Guinea midfielder Naby Keita, who collapsed after last month's shock 1-0 defeat to Wolfsburg, marked his return with two goals while playmaker Emil Forsberg and captain Willi Orban also scored."
31,16/03/2017,00:34,Joyful Simeone hails Atletico's latest European march,Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone lauded his side's determination to keep making their mark on the Champions League after they reached the quarter-finals for a fourth consecutive season.,"Simeone's men have lost out in the final to cross city rivals Real Madrid in two of the past three seasons. However, they have another chance at Champions League glory as a 0-0 draw with Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday sealed their place in Friday's draw 4-2 on aggregate. ""Firstly there is joy,"" said Simeone. ""It shows the great effort the club and, above all, the players have made in the way they have competed and given their heart and soul in the past four years. ""Everyone has done their bit to be amongst the top eight teams in Europe."" Atletico were far from their best at the Vicente Calderon as they relied on a stunning triple save from goalkeeper Jan Oblak to prevent just a second Champions League defeat in the past four seasons. However, the Spanish side got the job done in Germany three weeks ago thanks to goals from Saul Niguez, Antoine Griezmann, Kevin Gameiro and Fernando Torres. ""We didn't need to attack like crazy,"" said Atletico's top scorer Griezmann. ""We tried to see the game out at the back and that is what we did. We are in the quarter-finals and we are all happy."" Another European reunion with Real is one of seven possible opponents for Atletico in the last eight along with Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Monaco, Leicester City and Juventus. ""Now hopefully we can get a good draw and through to the semis,"" added Griezmann. ""We have to show every year we are among the best teams in Europe and every year we achieve it."" New Leverkusen boss Tayfun Korkut was taking charge of his first Champions League game and summoned a much-improved performance as they forced Atletico onto the back foot for long spells. However, Korkut hailed Atletico's desire to defend as Oblak's miraculous triple save to deny firstly Julian Brandt and then two follow-up efforts from Kevin Volland midway through the second-half secured Los Rojiblancos' 17th clean sheet in their last 20 home Champions League games. ""I haven't seen anything like it,"" said Korkut. ""I've watched it again and it isn't just him. There were many defenders throwing themselves to block the shot. ""You see how this team defends their goal. They are all there to put their foot or any part of their body on the line."" Korkut was hired after a 6-2 thrashing at Dortmund following their first leg defeat saw Roger Schmidt sacked. And with Leverkusen languishing in 10th in the Bundesliga, Korkut is hoping to gain momentum from their impressive showing to make a late run to qualify for Europe next season. ""We saw that we have the quality to cause them problems. Atletico suffered and we had a lot of chances,"" he added. ""For me the important thing is that the team has taken the first steps forward comparing with where we have come from in the Bundesliga."""
32,15/03/2017,22:47,Oblak stars in stalemate as Atletico progress,Atletico Madrid booked their place in the Champions League quarter-finals for a fourth consecutive season but had goalkeeper Jan Oblak to thank for avoiding defeat in a 0-0 draw with Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday.,"Oblak produced a remarkable triple save midway through the second half as Atletico held on to their 4-2 first-leg advantage to take their place in Friday's draw for the last eight. ""It is not easy to be in the quarter-finals four years in a row,"" Oblak told BeIN Sports Spain. ""I hope Atletico will continue like this, keep growing like in the last few years and I am sure we can achieve great things."" On a night of few Atletico chances, the home fans didn't even get to cheer the return of hero Fernando Torres. Two weeks on from being knocked unconscious in a sickening head clash Atletico boss Diego Simeone left Torres on the bench for the full 90 minutes. ""There is always a feeling of enthusiasm, passion, the Champions League is always special,"" said Simeone, who has led Atletico to the final in two of the past three seasons. ""Evidently, this is a very important step for the club."" New Leverkusen boss Tayfun Korkut was taking charge of his first Champions League game after Roger Schmidt was sacked when Leverkusen's first-leg defeat was followed by a 6-2 thrashing at Borussia Dortmund. Korkut summoned a much-improved performance from the Germans as they forced Atletico onto the back foot for long spells. However, the damage had already been done as the hosts registered their 17th clean sheet in their last 21 Champions League home games. ""I congratulate Atletico Madrid and especially their 'keeper Oblak for a wonderful performance,"" said Korkut. ""I haven't seen anything like (the triple save). I've watched it again and it isn't just him. There were many defenders throwing themselves to block the shot. ""You see how this team defends their goal."" Leverkusen had the chance to bring the tie back to life after just four minutes but Kevin Volland pulled his shot across Oblak and beyond the far post. Atletico took until seven minutes before the break to threaten but then forced Bernd Leno into two fine saves in 60 seconds. Firstly, Angel Correa was denied before Koke's low driven shot was turned behind by the German international. Only a poor cross from Volland denied Javier Hernandez what should have been a tap-in at the start of the second half after great work from Julian Brandt. At the other end, Atletico went close twice in quick succession once more as Correa danced inside two Leverkusen challenges before stabbing just wide. Antoine Griezmann was then inches away from his 22nd goal of the season with a measured chip over Leno that floated just wide. The highlight of the match came 21 minutes from time when Oblak pulled off an incredible triple save to end Leverkusen's hopes of a comeback. Brandt pounced on a slack pass from Jose Maria Gimenez and after he was denied one-on-one with Oblak, the Slovenian twice pulled himself off the ground to save Volland's follow-up efforts. Oblak's work for the night wasn't done as he still had to make saves from long-range efforts by Leon Bailey, Wendell and Kevin Kampl to prevent Atletico slumping to just a second Champions League home defeat under Simeone. But the hosts held on to extend Spanish clubs' winning run over German sides in European competition to 11 ties."
33,10/03/2017,16:54,Torres set for Leverkusen return - Simeone,Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone believes Fernando Torres will be free to return from a sickening head clash in time for next week's Champions League meeting with Bayer Leverkusen.,"Torres lost consciousness in a challenge with Deportivo la Coruna's Alex Bergantinos eight days ago, but thankfully he was released from hospital a day later with no serious injuries. ""He is in the recovery process and we imagine that for Wednesday he will be available,"" said Simeone. Atletico welcome Leverkusen to the Vicente Calderon boasting a 4-2 first-leg lead after Torres scored his side's fourth in Germany two weeks ago. Torres is not in the Atletico squad for Saturday's La Liga trip to Granada. French international Kevin Gameiro also misses out due to a minor abdominal strain."
34,05/03/2017,15:26,Leverkusen sack head coach Schmidt,"Bayer Leverkusen ""regretfully"" sacked coach Roger Schmidt -- despite still being in the Champions League -- following their humiliating 6-2 Bundesliga thrashing at Borussia Dortmund.","The 49-year-old is the ninth coach to be fired by a Bundesliga club this season. Schmidt, who took charge in July 2014, was dismissed after three straight defeats in all competitions and with Leverkusen mired in mid-table. ""In view of the current sporting development, we have come to the conclusion that a separation is painful, but unavoidable, for the further development of Bayer 04,"" managing director Michael Schade said in a statement on Sunday. ""I personally very much regret this because we have a great deal to thank Roger Schmidt for. ""During his term we have qualified for the group stages of the Champions League three times and he has also implemented our philosophy of developing young players into internationals and thus creating lasting values."" Leverkusen's wretched recent run started with a 4-2 first-leg defeat at home to Atletico Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League on February 21. Heavy defeat at Dortmund on Saturday left Leverkusen ninth in the table, 11 points from a Champions League place for next season. The ""Werkself"" qualified for Europe's top competition in all three seasons under Schmidt, but have lost 11 of their 23 league games this season. Leverkusen will have a new coach for the return leg against Atletico in Madrid on March 15 and a caretaker coach has not yet been named."
35,21/02/2017,22:56,Griezmann among goals as Atletico gain upper hand,Antoine Griezmann was among the scorers for Atletico Madrid as they weathered a late storm against Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday to claim a 4-2 victory in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.,"Saul Niguez and Antoine Griezmann scored to put the Spanish side two goals up at the interval, but Leverkusen pulled one back through Karim Bellarabi at the start of the second half. A Kevin Gameiro penalty then restored Atletico's two-goal advantage just before the hour mark, and while a Stefan Savic own goal gave Leverkusen hope again, Fernando Torres came off the bench to make it 4-2 late on. The home side put in a brave performance and came close to equalising in the last 10 minutes, but Torres' late goal sealed a deserved victory for the visitors ahead of the return in Spain next month. Leverkusen started brightly, while Atletico looked to hit them on the break, and in the opening 10 minutes both had chances. But in the 17th minute, the away side pounced. Cutting in from the right, Saul Niguez curled a fine shot into the far corner from the edge of the penalty area. Atletico then grasped the game by the scruff of the neck and in the 25th minute a mistake by Aleksandar Dragovic allowed Gameiro to run at goal. He then squared the ball to Griezmann, who rifled a shot past Bernd Leno. To their credit, Leverkusen rallied and Kevin Kampl forced an excellent save from Miguel Angel Moya from long range. Only a fine stop by Leno at the other end prevented Griezmann from scoring again but Leverkusen quickly pulled a goal back at the start of the second half. Benjamin Henrichs found space on the right and delivered a low cross which Karim Bellarabi turned into the far corner. It was no less than the Leverkusen forwards deserved, but their defence continued to struggle. Gameiro first hit the bar before extending Atletico's lead from the penalty spot just before the hour mark. Dragovic was at fault again as he wrestled Gameiro to the ground in the penalty area and the Frenchman calmly struck the ball down the middle to make it 3-1. Leverkusen refused to give up, and an own goal gifted them another route back into the game on 66 minutes. Fresh off the bench, Joel Pohjanpalo delivered a fine cross which ricocheted off Savic and into the Atletico net. At 3-2, the hosts looked invigorated, and Javier Hernandez nearly equalised with 10 minutes to go, his shot cleared just in front of the line by Filipe Luis. It was substitute Torres who secured the win late on, heading the ball in at the near post to make it 4-2 with just four minutes to play."
36,18/02/2017,15:16,Leverkusen eye Atletico after Bellarabi milestone,"Karim Bellarabi said hitting the German league's 50,000th goal in Bayer Leverkusen's 3-1 win at Augsburg was a confidence booster for Tuesday's Champions League home clash against Atletico Madrid.","The Germany winger wrote himself into Bundesliga history on Friday as his 23rd-minute goal hit the milestone mark when he converted a precise cross from 17-year-old midfielder Kai Havertz. ""I was glad to be involved, it's of course something really special,"" said Bellarabi. Diego Simeone's Atletico are the visitors in the Champions League on Tuesday in the last 16, first-leg, with the return in Madrid on March 15. ""But now we have to look ahead. We want to really put our foot down against Atletico and give it all we have,"" added Bellarabi. His milestone score gave Leverkusen the lead before Javier Hernandez netted twice to leave the ex-Manchester United star with five goals in his last three games. 'Chicharito' is on fire again after an 11-match goal drought in Germany's top flight. Leverkusen have won their last two league games to ease the pressure on coach Roger Schmidt, amidst reports the club contacted namesake and Mainz coach Martin Schmidt as a possible replacement. Leverkusen have not got past the Round of 16 since reaching the 2002 Champions League final and have suffered knock-out stage heartbreak in recent years. They lost to Atletico Madrid on penalties in 2015 in the last 16, after it finished 1-1 on aggregate. In 2014, they were hammered 4-0 at home by Paris St Germain at the same stage, when Zlatan Ibrahimovic netted twice, before a 2-1 loss in France. That followed a 7-1 thrashing in the last 16 in 2012 at the hands of Barcelona, for whom Lionel Messi scored a record five goals, in a 10-2 aggregate loss after a 3-1 defeat at Leverkusen."
37,07/02/2017,17:07,Banned Calhanoglu to waive Leverkusen salary,"Turkey international Hakan Calhanoglu will his forego his Bayer Leverkusen salary while he serves his four-month ban for breach of contract, the Bundesliga club announced on Tuesday.","The 22-year-old, Leverkusen's joint top-scorer with six league goals, is banned until May after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) last Thursday upheld a ruling by world football's governing body FIFA. In January 2016, FIFA found Calhanoglu guilty of breach of contract. In 2011, while still a teenager, the German-born forward signed a preliminary contract with Turkish side Trabzonspor, but then agreed to an extension with his then-club Karlsruher. As well as the suspension Calhanoglu must pay Trabzonspor 100,000 euros ($108,000) in compensation, and he will be hit again in the pocket by a lack of earnings. ""Bayer had nothing to do with the incident at the time, but the club was hit hard by the punishment,"" said Calhanoglu in a statement from his club. ""This is why it is self-evident to me that I will not harm the club any further and will waive my salary for the duration of my suspension."" Leverkusen have said Calhanoglu will still train with the first team during his ban. The club, whom he joined from Hamburg in 2014, say Calhanoglu is also looking into what options he has for a legal appeal."
38,05/02/2017,16:09,Dortmund sign defender Toprak for next season,Borussia Dortmund announced on Sunday that they have signed Turkey international Omer Toprak for next season after activating the defender's release clause at Bundesliga rivals Bayer Leverkusen.,"Toprak will sign a deal until June 2021 and the 27-year-old centre-back, who has made 25 appearances for Turkey, will reportedly cost Dortmund around 12 million euros ($12.9m). He will bring a wealth of Champions League experience to Dortmund, who are third in the Bundesliga after Saturday's 1-0 over second-placed RB Leipzig. ""Toprak is a strong defender with international experience and great leadership qualities,"" Dortmund's sporting director Michael Zorc said. Toprak has made 181 appearances in Germany's top flight, for both Leverkusen and ex-club Freiburg, scoring five goals."
39,04/02/2017,14:49,On-loan 'Papa' boosts Hamburg's survival hopes,"On-loan Kyriakos Papadopoulos can help Hamburg avoid an historic relegation from Germany's top flight, according to coach Markus Gisdol, following the defender's winning goal against his own club Bayer Leverkusen.","Papadopoulos, nicknamed 'Papa' for short, is on loan at Hamburg until June from Leverkusen, where he has a contract until 2020. The centre-back spent the first half of the season on loan at RB Leipzig, where he played just 27 minutes of Bundesliga football, but has played in all of Hamburg's three games so far in 2017 since joining last month. He sank Bayer with a 76th-minute header in Hamburg's 1-0 home win against Leverkusen on Friday. It was their third win in six league games and Hamburg only remain in the bottom three on goal difference. They are the only current club in Germany's top flight to have never been relegated and Gisdol says 'Papa' has the fighting-spirit they need. ""I knew what I was getting with 'Papa'. He has the right mentality and a fighter's heart,"" said Hamburg boss Gisdol. Papadopoulos, 24, was unabashed despite netting against his own club. ""I always give 100 percent, regardless of whom I'm playing against,"" he said. ""My goal wasn't hard to explain,"" he added bluntly. ""We don't have to celebrate now, just keep working and we have only taken one step."" The defeat was bad new for Leverkusen, who host Atletico Madrid in the last 16, first-leg, of the Champions League on February 21. Leverkusen have lost their last two league games after throwing away a two-goal lead against Borussia Moenchengladbach last Sunday. To compound their problems, winger Hakan Calhanoglu started a four-month ban from FIFA on Thursday for breach of contract and star striker Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez missed the Hamburg defeat with a groin injury."
40,03/02/2017,13:39,Calhanoglu blames father for four-month ban,Hakan Calhanoglu says his father will never again be involved in his career as the Turkey international and Bayer Leverkusen star begins his four-month ban for breach of contract.,"The 22-year-old, Leverkusen's joint top-scorer with six league goals, is effectively banned for all bar the last few weeks of the season after Thursday's decision from the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Leverkusen, ninth in Germany's top flight, will be without their goal-scoring winger for the season's key phase -- starting with Friday's German league match at Hamburg. They face Atletico Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League in three weeks time and must finish in the top four to qualify for Europe's top competition. On Thursday, CAS, which is based in Lausanne, upheld a previous ruling by FIFA from January 2016 which found Calhanoglu guilty of breach of contract. In 2011, while still a teenager, the German-born forward signed a preliminary contract with Turkish side Trabzonspor, even though he had just signed an extension deal with Karlsruher. As well as the suspension Calhanoglu was ordered to pay Trabzonspor 100,000 euros ($108,000) in compensation. In its ruling, CAS rejected the player's appeal against both the ban, which was suspended pending the outcome of the appeal, and the fine. In an interview with Cologne newspaper Express, Calhanoglu explained the background. ""In our culture, the father has the say. I was 17 years old and not aware of the scope (of his actions),"" he told the newspaper having stayed at home for the verdict from Switzerland. ""I heard by accident from a friend that my father had met a representative from Trabzonspor at a restaurant in Darmstadt. ""My father came home and said 'Hakan, you must sign the contract'. ""He knows that he made a bad mistake and it makes him sad. ""He is my father and remains my father, but he will never be involved in my career again."" After a two-year spell with Karlsruher, the attacking midfielder moved to topflight Bundesliga side Hamburg for a season before joining Leverkusen in 2014. With Calhanoglu now unavailable, Leverkusen need star striker Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez fit again after suffering a groin injury. New signing Leon Bailey, 19, has yet to make his debut after signing from Belgium's Genk for 12 million euros ($12.8m) on Tuesday."
41,01/02/2017,17:31,Bayer sweat over 'Chicharito' groin injury,"Bayer Leverkusen's star striker Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez is out of Friday's Bundesliga clash at Hamburg with a groin injury, his club confirmed on Wednesday.","""Because of a small tear in the area of his left adductor the Mexican forward misses the away game at Hamburg,"" Leverkusen wrote on their website. His club has not said how long Hernandez will be out, with three games left before Bayer host Atletico Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie on February 21. The 28-year-old ex-Manchester United and Real Madrid forward ended a barren spell in front of goal last Saturday by netting in Leverkusen's 3-2 home defeat against Borussia Moenchengladbach, a result which left them ninth. His 34th-minute header against Gladbach was his first in Germany's top flight since October. Despite a disappointing tally of eight goals this season in all competitions, Hernandez is still Leverkusen's top scorer with six goals in 17 league games this term."
42,31/01/2017,11:42,Jamaican teenager Bailey joins Bayer,Promising Jamaican teenager Leon Bailey signed a five year contract with Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday for a reported 12 million euros ($12.8 million).,"The 19-year-old forward moves to Germany from Belgian side Genk. ""With Leon Bailey we have once again secured a very promising long term prospect,"" club director Michael Schade said. ""This young man was also the target of a number of other European sides and we are thrilled to have beaten off strong opposition for him."" Bailey, who plays on the left wing, joined Genk at the start of the season form Slovakian side Trencin. ""At Bayer I want to go to the next level,"" Bailey said. ""Leverkusen are known as a club where a player can develop. And the type of football they play here is attractive, I like that."" Leverkusen are placed ninth in the Bundesliga, and face Atletico Madrid in the Champions League last 16."
43,06/12/2016,13:13,Leverkusen hunt first win over Monaco in six,Bayer Leverkusen are chasing a first Champions League win over Monaco at the sixth attempt on Wednesday with both sides already through to the knock-out stages.,"Regardless of the result at Leverkusen's BayArena, Monaco are confirmed as Group E winners while Bayer will progress in second at the expense of Tottenham Hotspur. The Germans came within a whisker of a win at Monaco when the sides last met in September, leading 1-0 through Javier Hernandez's strike before Kamil Glik equalised for Monaco in the 94th-minute. Monaco are unbeaten in their five matches against Leverkusen with three wins and two draws and have never lost on their five previous European matches in Germany. They are in fine form with four wins and a draw from their last five games having trounced Bastia 5-0 at home on Saturday in the French league. The match is a dead rubber, but Leverkusen need a win to boost confidence following a run of three league games without a victory. In-form Turkish international Hakan Calhanoglu is expected to partner Javier Hernandez 'Chicharito' in attack in the absence of Kevin Volland, who has a thigh injury. Swiss striker Admir Mehmedi is also out with a groin injury while Kevin Kampl, who scored in their 1-0 win at Spurs, has been ruled out for the next eight weeks with a foot injury. Finland striker Joel Pohjanpalo is pushing for a starting berth after recovering from a broken metatarsal. It will be interesting to see who takes over the penalty duties, should Leverkusen be awarded a spot kick. Javier Hernandez crashed his effort off the goalkeeper's boot in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Freiburg meaning his club have failed with all four penalties awarded to them in the Bundesliga this season. The Mexican also failed with a penalty in their 2-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt in September, while Charles Aranguiz and Calhanoglu have also missed spot kicks against Leipzig and Augsburg respectively. Bayer were also beaten on penalties by third-division club Sportfreunde Lotte in the second round of the DFB Cup. ""Having already missed so many, a lot of players are lacking confidence when it comes to taking penalties, including myself,"" Calhanoglu admitted in magazine Kicker. ""If we get our next penalty on Wednesday, I'd want to grab the ball and stick it in the back of the net."""
44,05/12/2016,16:32,"Kampl misses Monaco, rest of 2016 with foot injury","Bayer Leverkusen will be without Kevin Kampl for Wednesday's Champions League match at home to Monaco, and the rest of 2016, after the Slovenia international suffered a foot injury.","The 26-year-old defensive midfielder has been ever present for Leverkusen this season, missing just one of their 13 league games, but is sidelined for up to eight weeks after damaging a bone in his right foot in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Freiburg. He has aggravated an old injury he picked up having scored Leverkusen's winner in their 1-0 victory at Tottenham Hotspur five weeks ago. Kampl will miss Wednesday's match at the BayArena with both teams in the last 16 of the Champions League and Monaco confirmed as Group E winners as Spurs miss out. ""It's the same place I'd been injured in the match at Tottenham,"" Kampl, who was kicked on the outside of his right foot at Freiburg, told magazine Kicker. ""It happened five minutes before the end and I couldn't tread on it anymore. ""I definitely won't play on it again this year. It's bitter news."" Against Monaco, Leverkusen are also without Swiss striker Admir Mehmedi, who has torn an adductor, and Germany forward Kevin Volland, who has a tendon injury. Kampl now aims to be fit for Leverkusen's first league match of 2017 at home to Hertha Berlin on January 22 when the Bundesliga resumes after the winter break with Bayer currently ninth in Germany's top flight."
45,25/11/2016,01:35,Faltering Bayern host Leverkusen denying 'crisis',Faltering Bayern Munich hope to break their second mini winless streak this season when they host Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday to launch their counter-attack on top spot in Germany.,"For the first time since September 2015, second-placed Bayern do not top the table at the start of a weekend of Bundesliga fixtures. Having won the Bundesliga title in each of the last four seasons, things are currently not going Bayern's way. New leaders RB Leipzig, who are at Freiburg on Friday, are on a record run and yet to taste defeat in their first 11 league games to leave them three points clear of Bayern. Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl acknowledged their 3-2 win at Leverkusen last Friday, to put them top, stirred up a wasps' nest ""so of course there is some buzzing"" in Bayern. Following their home draw with Hoffenheim, narrow defeat at Borussia Dortmund and 3-2 loss at Russia's Rostov in the Champions League on Wednesday, Bayern are wobbling. This is the second time the Bavarian giants have gone three games without a win since Carlo Ancelotti took charge at the start of the season. Poor defending was at the root of their problem in Rostov. The tension around the defending German champions is clear, especially as the Rostov defeat ended their hopes of winning their Champions League group. ""It's useless to make a circus out of things now,"" fumed chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge after the loss in Rostov. ""We have to do things better, especially in Saturday's next game against Bayer Leverkusen."" Captain Philipp Lahm denies Bayern are in crisis, but ""at he moment we are a bit careless and making too many mistakes. ""We don't seem to know that our opponents can also score and will punish our mistakes,"" he added, bemused. Bayern are waiting on the fitness of defender Jerome Boateng. The Germany centre-back suffered a thigh injury in Rostov and was criticised by Rummenigge for a poor display, but the whole Bayern defence is currently shaky. Having served time in jail for tax evasion, Uli Hoeness is set to be re-elected as Bayern president on Friday. The out-spoken Hoeness wants to put Bayern back on the attack and the 64-year-old will have plenty to say if results do not improve. Leverkusen are buoyed from their midweek Champions League draw at CSKA Moscow which means they progress at the expense to the last 16 at the expense of Tottenham Hotspur. The sides drew 0-0 in Leverkusen in February on their previous meeting and it is four years since Bayer last poached a win in Munich. Third-placed Dortmund are at Eintracht Frankfurt having welcomed back Germany winger Marco Reus, who led the scoring in their record 8-4 drubbing of Legia Warsaw on Tuesday. Coach Thomas Tuchel, who made nine changes for the side which beat Bayern, has a few defensive frailties to fix. Antony Modeste, the league's joint top scorer with 12 goals alongside Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, will look to add to his tally for fourth-placed Cologne against. Augsburg. Fifth-placed Hoffenheim, who along with RB Leipzig, are still unbeaten this season, are at Borussia Moenchengladbach, who are 13th. Gladbach held Manchester City to a 1-1 draw on Wednesday which ended their Champions League hopes and booked their passage into the Europa League. The draw took some pressure off coach Andre Schubert, but his side are winless in their last six games. Fixtures (all times 1430 GMT unless stated)"

The 56-year-old admits he would have ""signed with blood"" if he had been offered a deal to qualify after Leverkusen drew their first three European games. With a home game against group-winners Monaco still to come, this is the seventh time Leverkusen have qualified for the last 16. The bonus of an extra six million euros ($6.3m) is also welcome for the club's coffers. Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt gave his players Wednesday off and on Thursday work starts for Saturday's match in Munich. For the first time in 14 months, Bayern are no longer top of the Bundesliga table and lag three points behind new leaders RB Leipzig. After last Saturday's 1-0 defeat at Borussia Dortmund, Bayern will be eager for a win over Leverkusen, but Schmidt also badly needs a good result at the Allianz Arena. His side have won just four of their last 10 games and Volland's goal to take a precious point in Moscow eased some of the pressure on him.

""The last few weeks have not been so easy for me personally, there has been a lot written, and such a goal is good for self-confidence,"" said Schmidt."
48,22/11/2016,21:00,Leverkusen hold on for CSKA draw,Bayer Leverkusen played out a 1-1 draw at CSKA Moscow on Tuesday to put the German club on the verge of qualifying for the Champions League knockout stages.,"Kevin Volland put Leverkusen ahead after 16 minutes before Israeli international Bibras Natcho converted a second-half penalty to snatch a draw for the Russian club. Leverkusen will be assured of qualifying if Monaco beat English club Tottenham in Group E later Tuesday. Bayer manager Roger Schmidt said he was pleased with a point. ""It was a very intense match,"" he told a news conference. ""I'm pleased that I made clear the importance of this match to my men and we looked really well in the first half. We opened the scoring and had chances to increase our lead. ""But in the second half CSKA picked up steam and reversed the situation to pull the scores level. Hopefully, later today we will be able to find out how precious was the point that we've gained here."" The visitors started in a lively fashion and in the eighth minute Hakan Calhanoglu squandered a chance for an opener sending the ball inches wide off the far left post with an angled low shot. CSKA replied with a shot by Alexander Golovin from the edge of the six-yard box, which was confidently denied by Bernd Leno. In the 16th minute Volland made CSKA pay for loss of concentration as he escaped an offside trap to latch on to a razor-sharp pass by Kevin Kampl, who fired the ball home from eight yards out past helpless 'keeper Igor Akinfeev. Alan Dzagoev, who has returned after two months out with injury, missed an opportunity to level just before the half-hour mark as his seven-yard volley flew just over the crossbar. Bayer skipper Omer Toprak also sent the ball into the net in the 39th minute but his goal was rightly ruled out for offside. After the break CSKA, who needed to win to keep alive their hopes for a place in the knockout stages, poured forwards and in the 69th minute Alexander Golovin failed to score from a rebound from just four yards out. But in the 76th minute Natcho pulled level from the spot after Bayer back Benjamin Henrichs fouled Mario Fernandes in the box. Volland could have restored the visitors' lead with 10 minutes to go but his curling close-range effort hit the woodwork and bounced back into play."
49,21/11/2016,02:01,Spotlight on Ronaldo for European homecoming,worldfootball looks ahead to Tuesday's Champions League action as Cristiano Ronaldo goes back to first club Sporting Lisbon and Tottenham Hotspur face a crunch trip to Monaco (kick-offs 1945 GMT unless stated):,"<strong>Group E</strong> At Moscow (1700 GMT) CSKA Moscow (RUS) v Bayer Leverkusen (GER) Morale is on the floor in Moscow with CSKA bottom of Group E before Leverkusen's visit. The defending Russian champions this week saw their midfielder Roman Eremenko hit with a two-year ban for cocaine use after a positive test following the reverse fixture between the teams in September. Eremenko's goal in that match gave CSKA a 2-2 draw after being two goals down. The Muscovites registered their first win in five league games at the weekend and must win this game to keep alive their hopes of reaching the last 16. Leverkusen can progress by avoiding defeat, provided Tottenham Hotspur lose away to Monaco. The Germans are unbeaten in the section, following up three draws by beating Tottenham at Wembley last time out. However, they are struggling in mid-table in the Bundesliga having lost at home to RB Leipzig at the weekend. At Monaco Monaco (FRA) v Tottenham Hotspur (ENG) Tottenham travel to the Mediterranean principality boosted by claiming a first win in eight matches at the weekend, when they beat West Ham United 3-2 after a dramatic late fightback in the Premier League. Mauricio Pochettino's side are in real trouble in the Champions League having lost at home to Monaco and Bayer Leverkusen. They will be eliminated if they fail to win at the Stade Louis II and Leverkusen better their result when they face CSKA Moscow in Russia. Monaco need only draw the game to be sure of a place in the last 16. They will secure first place if they win and Leverkusen drop points. Leonardo Jardim's side are the leading scorers in Europe's big five leagues, averaging three goals a game in Ligue 1, including a 3-0 win at Lorient on Friday. Leading their attack is a revitalised Radamel Falcao, with the Colombian having netted nine times in all competitions this season. The teams drew 1-1 here in the Europa League last season. Toby Alderweireld and Ben Davies are on the sidelines for Spurs and Erik Lamela, who scored at the Stade Louis II last season, is also doubtful. <strong>Group F</strong> At Dortmund, Germany Borussia Dortmund (GER) v Legia Warsaw (POL) Dortmund, the 1997 winners and 2013 runners-up, are already certain to progress to the last 16 having amassed 10 points from their first four matches. Thomas Tuchel's side are now looking to secure top spot and a win at home to already-eliminated Legia will guarantee them first place, as long as Real Madrid drop points at Sporting Lisbon. At the very least, a win will ensure the Bundesliga club go to Madrid next month in a position to clinch the group. Dortmund are fresh from beating Bayern Munich 1-0 in ""Der Klassiker"" at the weekend thanks to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 12th Bundesliga goal of the season. The Gabon star was also on target as Dortmund won 6-0 away to Legia in their group opener in September. Legia, who remain in with a chance of finishing third and going into the Europa League, have improved since a poor start to the campaign. The Poles have won five of their last six games, the exception being a 3-3 draw at home to Real Madrid. At Lisbon Sporting Lisbon (POR) v Real Madrid (ESP) Cristiano Ronaldo takes on his first professional club Sporting as a champion of Europe with Real and Portugal and is widely expected to pick up his fourth Ballon d'Or. He will doubtless receive a hero's welcome on his return to the Estadio Jose Alvalade. Ronaldo's hat-trick this weekend, his 39th for Real, delivered a 3-0 away win at Atletico Madrid despite the visitors missing six key players in captain Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Casemiro, Toni Kroos, Alvaro Morata and Karim Benzema. Champions League holders Real won the reverse fixture 2-1 and are unbeaten in 29 games in all competitions. All Zinedine Zidane's men need here is a point to secure passage to the next round, but with Dortmund top of the group by two points Real will want to hunt them down as a point of pride -- and to earn an easier draw in the next round. Sporting are on an upturn and scoring regularly and are still in with a chance of the Europa League. <strong>Group G</strong> At Leicester, England Leicester City (ENG) v Club Brugge (BEL) English champions Leicester top Group G with 10 points and have yet to concede a goal. Conversely, Brugge are yet to notch up a single point. A draw for the hosts would mean they progress to the next stage with a game to spare. Domestically, the unlikely Premier League champions have struggled to reproduce the form that delivered the title to the King Power Stadium and sit just two points above the relegation zone after a 2-1 weekend defeat to Watford. Claudio Ranieri's men however, including Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, who are on the Ballon d'Or list, are a different proposition in their maiden Champions League campaign. It even looks as if Ranieri is prioritising Europe over the Premier League. At Copenhagen FC Copenhagen (DEN) v Porto (POR) Copenhagen bagged a 1-1 draw away to second-placed Porto in September and are fighting for Champions League survival in this game, in which a win for the Portuguese would see them qualify. But Porto are misfiring with only two wins in their past five outings in all competitions while Stale Solbakken's charges are unbeaten in their five games at home in Europe this season. Porto go into the clash with the depressing effect of having lost a penalty shoot-out to Chaves in the Portuguese Cup at the weekend, while the hosts powered to yet another win in the league. A win for the Danes would see them leap-frog their opponents in the group. Has the makings of a classic. <strong>Group H</strong> At Seville, Spain Sevilla (ESP) v Juventus (ITA) This is arguably the match of the round with Sevilla top on 10 points and visitors Juve second on eight with a tight 0-0 draw in Italy in the reverse fixture. Sevilla are flying high in Spain after they produced a stunning fightback from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at Deportivo la Coruna. Argentine coach Jorge Sampaoli's version of Sevilla is thrilling fans after transforming the Europa League champions into a free-thinking outfit. Italian champions Juventus go into the showdown on the back of a 3-0 Serie A win over Pescara. ""It's an important game for us because we have to win one of our last two games to go through,"" coach Massimiliano Allegri said. Juve may have to do it the hard way with several defenders carrying knocks, but the forward line of Mario Mandzukic and Gonzalo Higuain is a frightening prospect for Sevilla. At Zagreb Dinamo Zagreb (CRO) v Lyon (FRA) Dinamo cannot qualify for the next round after a miserable Champions League campaign that has seen them fail to earn a point or even score a goal in four matches. They still have the consolation of the Europa League just about alive, but must win this game for starters. Lyon, with four points from four games, are only slightly better off and need a victory in Zagreb and for Juventus to fail to win to live another day. Lyon are fourth in Ligue 1 in France and their form has picked up in domestic competition after a slow start. Bafetimbi Gomis -- now at rivals Marseille -- scored four, including an eight-minute hat-trick, when Lyon won 7-1 in Zagreb in the 2011/12 group stage."
50,17/11/2016,02:28,Germany's new-boys Leipzig eye history in Leverkusen,RB Leipzig can claim a milestone in their fledgling history on Friday by taking a point at Bayer Leverkusen to knock Bayern Munich from the top of the Bundesliga table.,"""We definitely want to take something there and remain unbeaten. If there is a point available, then there will also be three,"" said Leipzig's coach Ralph Hasenhuettl ahead of the clash at Leverkusen's BayArena. Second-placed Leipzig, backed by Austrian drinks giants Red Bull, can become the first club to go 11 games unbeaten at the start of their first German league season if they avoid defeat. Ahead of the weekend's matches, both Bayern and Leipzig, who have earned four promotions in seven years, have 24 league points. A draw or win would see Leipzig top the table, at least overnight, ahead of Bayern, who are at Borussia Dortmund on Saturday evening in the battle of Germany's top clubs -- dubbed 'Der Klassiker'. But Hassenhuettl says usurping Bayern -- who Leipzig face in Munich on December 20 in a pre-Christmas showdown -- is not the priority. ""If we take points, the table will look like that,"" said the Austrian. ""But that's not a subject for us, it's neither the team's motivation, nor something we will let put us under pressure. ""We have other things to worry about, namely a tough away match."" Leipzig have question marks over top-scorer Timo Werner (upset stomach), who has five goals in ten league games, and teenage Scotland winger Oliver Burke (virus). ""It will be close for Oliver, Timo will most probably be okay,"" said Hasenhuettl. Following their 1-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur a fortnight ago, Leverkusen are on course for the last 16 in Europe. Bayer, who are eighth in the table, need a win to warm-up for Tuesday's Champions League group stage match at CSKA Moscow, but their coach Roger Schmidt says Leipzig have proved they deserve respect. ""Leipzig, with their financial possibilities and professional structure, are not your average newly-promoted team,"" said Schmidt, whose team won their three games before the international break. ""We want to climb the table, but we have our own goals. ""Before the international break, we made a very good impression, which we want to resume on Friday."" Leverkusen hope to have midfield hard-man Charles Aranguiz, but the Chile international picked up an injury in a World Cup qualifier against Uruguay. Captain Lars Bender, also a candidate for the defensive midfield, has not trained for two weeks with a heel injury. Kevin Kampl (bruised foot), Omer Toprak (thigh), Joel Pohjanpalo (foot fracture) and Vladlen Yurchenko (hairline shin fracture) are all out."
51,01/11/2016,18:07,Kane out of Leverkusen clash but in line for derby return,Harry Kane has been ruled out of Tottenham Hotspur's Champions League tie against Bayer Leverkusen at Wembley on Wednesday but the England striker could return in this weekend's North London derby against Arsenal.,"Damage to ligaments in his right ankle has seen Kane sidelined for just over six weeks but he did take a reduced role in first-team training on Monday and Tuesday. He is due to be involved in full training on Thursday and could now feature in Sunday's derby clash at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. When asked on Tuesday about the 23-year-old Kane's prospects, Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino said: ""Tomorrow (Wednesday), no, not on the bench. ""It's good because you can see him today warming up with the team to be involved in some exercises. But no, for tomorrow he is not ready. ""Sunday? Maybe, maybe."" Spurs defender Toby Alderweireld is still out of action with a leg injury, while Erik Lamela remains doubtful to face Leverkusen because of a hip problem. Should Kane feature in some capacity against Arsenal it would bolster his chances of being called up for England duty later this month. England face old rivals Scotland in a 2018 World Cup qualifier at Wembley on November 11, four days before a home friendly against Spain. While some in the Spurs' hierarchy might prefer it if Kane were spared England appearances so soon after an injury lay-off, Pochettino said he will not stand in his way if he is selected by England interim manager Gareth Southgate. ""If he is available to play Sunday against Arsenal then it will be difficult for us to stop him if the national team call him,"" Pochettino said. ""We are pro-national team always for all the players. If Harry is available we are not stupid to say 'no, Harry is out,' to try to protect him so that after two weeks he can be with us. ""We want the best for the team and for the player. It's true that maybe it makes more sense for the national team to say: 'Okay, stay at home. Stay with Tottenham and train for two weeks. It's important to build Harry's fitness and be better after'. ""But, if they consider that they need Harry to play for the national team and he is available to play against Arsenal then we cannot stop."" Tottenham may be the only unbeaten team left in this season's Premier League but they have not won any of their last five matches in all competitions and have not scored in open play in their last four fixtures. German club Leverkusen are third in Group E, just a point behind Spurs, and Pochettino said: ""It's important to win. Leverkusen is a very good team with very good players. I think it will be tough. ""We need to be more clinical in our offensive situation. We need to be determined and aggressive in the last third,"" the Argentinian added."
52,01/11/2016,12:50,Leverkusen skipper Bender out of Spurs clash,Bayer Leverkusen will be without influential captain Lars Bender for Wednesday's crunch Champions League clash with Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley.,"Right-back Bender, who won a silver medal with Germany at the 2016 Rio Olympics, is out with a bruised heel from Saturday's 2-1 comeback win at Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga. Also out injured is Australian winger Robbie Kruse, although he is out of favour and has not featured in either the Bundesliga or Champions League this season. But Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt has Germany international Jonathan Tah and Turkey's Omer Toprak fit after injuries to strengthen his defence. Leverkusen are third in Group E after drawing their first three games, just one point behind Spurs, with Monaco top. The Germans are relishing facing Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham at Wembley. ""Wembley has legends and the aura, but Tottenham will have to put in a good performance to beat us,"" said Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller. Midfielder Kevin Kampl says Leverkusen took heart from their home draw with Spurs, when they created several clear chances in the second half. ""We have seen that we can stand up to any team, but Wednesday will be our most difficult game in this group,"" said the Slovenia international."
53,18/10/2016,23:00,Kiessling miss gives Spurs a point at Leverkusen,Tottenham Hotspur preserved their unbeaten record away this season with a goalless draw at Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday in the Champions League after Stefan Kiessling's dramatic late miss for the hosts.,"A decade after Leverkusen lost 1-0 at home to Spurs in the old UEFA Cup, Kiessling was the only survivor in either team from the November 2006 fixture. But the 32-year-old ex-Germany striker somehow fired wide seven minutes from time, squandering the chance to secure a crucial win for the hosts while Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was outstanding. Having now drawn their three games in Group E, Leverkusen are third with three points while Spurs, on four points, stay second, a point behind leaders Monaco, who drew 1-1 at bottom side CSKA Moscow. ""We have now played three good matches, but have nothing to show for it,"" said Leverkusen captain Lars Bender. ""I'd rather we'd won and not played well."" Lloris had a busy second half as Leverkusen poured forward in search of the breakthrough. ""We can be pleased with the point,"" said the Frenchman. ""The game turned in the second half, Leverkusen pressed high and we struggled a bit. I think the draw is a good result for us."" Tottenham are yet to lose in any of their six away trips this season in all competitions. Here they dominated the first 45 minutes before Leverkusen gained the upper hand after the restart in a veritable game of two halves. Before kick-off, Leverkusen captain Bender shook off the flu to take his place at right-back. There were three changes from the team which suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at strugglers Werder Bremen on Saturday with Kiessling, right-winger Admir Mehmedi and Bender back in. Son Heung-Min, September's Premier League Player of the Month, started on the left for Tottenham against his former club. ""It was a special night for me, but I'm upset we didn't manage to get the three points,"" admitted Son. Spurs had the ball in the net with 10 minutes gone as Son got free of the Leverkusen defence and slid his pass away from Bayer goalkeeper Bernd Leno to Vincent Janssen, who slotted into the empty net, but the offside flag ruled the goal out. Then Dele Alli headed wide approaching the half-hour mark. Just before the break, Janssen's header smashed off the bar and when the ball bounced back into play, Leno denied Erik Lamela with a reflex save. It had been all Spurs in the first half, but Leverkusen gave Lloris a busy second period. Bayer were literally inches away from the opening goal on 48 minutes. Mehmedi's cross found Javier Hernandez with the goal at his mercy, but the ex-Manchester United ace hit his shot back at Lloris, who scrambled the back off his line. Hernandez lambasted the assistant referee, but goal-line technology showed the ball had not crossed the line. With 67 minutes gone, Leverkusen centre-back Omer Toprak slammed his hand on the turf in frustration after aiming his header straight at Lloris. Then with time running out Kiessling's miss meant Spurs left Germany with a point."
54,17/10/2016,16:42,Leverkusen's Schmidt relishing Spurs clash,Bayer Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt thinks Tuesday's Champions League match against high-flying Tottenham Hotspur could kick-start their group with both teams yet to impress in Europe this season.,"After letting winning positions slip in their previous Group E fixtures, Leverkusen must be wary of Tottenham, the only team still unbeaten in England's top flight this season. Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham are second in the group following their 1-0 win at CSKA Moscow three weeks ago and opening 2-1 defeat at home to table leaders Monaco. ""Not much has happened yet in the group, so you get the feeling that it'll really kick off against Tottenham,"" said Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt. ""You can't ask for a better match."" Leverkusen are waiting on the fitness of captain Lars Bender with the Germany international struggling with the flu, but took part in Monday's final training session. ""We can't say at the moment whether he'll be able to play,"" admitted Schmidt as Bender also sat out Saturday's shock 2-1 league defeat at Werder Bremen. Leverkusen have drawn both of their Champions League games so far. Having raced into a two-goal lead at home to CSKA Moscow, they allowed the Russians to come back to force a 2-2 draw with all four goals scored in the first half. Likewise, Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez gave Leverkusen a second-half lead at Monaco a fortnight ago, only for Kamil Glik to hit a 94th-minute equaliser with the host's first shot of the game in a 1-1 draw. Spurs will be a big test for the Germans. Dele Alli's last-gasp equaliser rescued Tottenham in Saturday's 1-1 draw against West Bromwich Albion, which extended the North London club's unbeaten league run to eight matches. ""We'll be playing in front of a full house against a very good team, who have yet to lose a game in the Premier League,"" said Leverkusen's sports director Rudi Voeller. ""We tend to do well against teams like that, we will put in a good fight and the fans will see a great game, hopefully with a win for us."" Leverkusen's Bundesliga form of late has been erratic. An impressive 2-0 win at home to Borussia Dortmund and victory away to Mainz was sandwiched between defeats to strugglers Werder Bremen and mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt. Pochettino says Spurs should have had more out of their draw with West Brom, which left them third in the Premier League, but says they will be ready for the game in Germany. One of Leverkusen's main tasks will be to contain Spurs' star-studded attack which includes England forward Dele Ali, Argentina's Erik Lamela and Son Heung-Min. The South Korean international scored 29 goals in 87 appearances for Leverkusen between 2013 and 2015 before joining Spurs. He was the Premier League's Player of the Month for September and having played only the last 20 minutes of Spurs' draw, the 24-year-old could be in line for a starting berth against his former club."

Roger Schmidt's Leverkusen face a Spurs side buoyed by Dele Alli's last-gasp equaliser in Saturday's 1-1 draw against West Bromwich Albion, which extended the North London club's unbeaten league run to eight matches. Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham are second in the Champions League group after their 1-0 win at CSKA Moscow three weeks ago, the same night Bayer drew 1-1 at table leaders Monaco. ""I'm really looking forward to it. We'll be playing in front of a full house against a very good team, who have yet to lose a game in the Premier League,"" said Leverkusen's sports director Voeller. ""We tend to do well against teams like that, we will put in a good fight and the fans will see a great game, hopefully with a win for us.""

56,29/09/2016,16:23,Finland's Pohjanpalo out for Leverkusen,"Bayer Leverkusen's Finnish midfielder Joel Pohjanpalo has been ruled out for several weeks with a fractured foot, the Bundesliga club said Thursday.","The 22-year-old is joint third in the list of goal scorers for Leverkusen this season with four goals including a hat-trick against Hamburg on September 10. He picked up the injury in training on Wednesday, the day after the German club's Champions League 1-1 draw at Monaco. Pohjanpalo will have to rest for at least six weeks, and only after that will he begin physiotherapy."
57,26/09/2016,14:34,'Little pea' Chicharito is Bayer's big deal,"His nickname 'Chicharito' means 'little pea', but ex-Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez is proving to be a big deal for Bayer Leverkusen ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match at Monaco.","The 28-year-old netted a hat-trick -- his second in Germany's top flight -- in helping Leverkusen come from 2-1 down to claim a 3-2 win at Mainz on Saturday. ""Thank God, he's in form at just the right time,"" said Leverkusen's coach Roger Schmidt after the Mainz fightback. After five years at Old Trafford, Chicharito quit the Red Devils in August 2015 for Leverkusen's 'Werkself' and has banged in 21 goals in 32 league games in Germany's top flight. Having fractured his arm in an accident at home in August, Hernandez was not fully fit when he played the first 45 minutes of Leverkusen's opening Champions League group match at CSKA Moscow a fortnight ago. He helped his side to a 2-0 half-time lead, only for the Russians to fight back for a 2-2 draw. The Mexico international is key to Leverkusen's chances of getting a first win against Monaco at the fourth attempt. ""We have a small score to settle with Monaco,"" said striker Stefan Kiessling after three defeats and a draw with the club from the tiny principality in recent years. Hernandez's hat-trick at Mainz proves he is back to his best, according to Schmidt. ""He wasn't fully fit, but now he's back on top form. It also helped him that he had a strike partner in the closing stages when Stefan Kiessling came on as that gave him more room to operate,"" said Schmidt. ""He doesn't hesitate when he gets a chance."" He certainly didn't when the chance came along to bag the winner two minutes into injury time. ""I am obviously very happy, but my thanks go to my team-mates, who had a big game,"" said Hernandez. ""We had some luck, but the late goal was a reward for that hard work."" The victory was important after two recent set-backs, for both Leverkusen and Chicharito. He missed a penalty in their 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt ten days ago and then failed to score in last Wednesday's goalless draw with Augsburg. With four league goals this season, he is just one behind Borussia Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski amongst the Bundesliga's top scorers. ""He certainly did not win all his battles, but he won the important ones. That demonstrates his wily ability to know where the ball should go,"" said Leverkusen's director of sport, ex-Germany international Rudi Voeller. Chicharito's stats in Mainz speak volumes: he scored three goals and hit the post with his four attempts. ""I don't know anybody who is as good as he is in front of goal,"" marvelled Leverkusen's Germany forward Kevin Volland. Signing the Mexican international was a big coup for Bayer. Hernandez has already played in a Champions League final, when his Manchester United team lost 3-1 to Barcelona in the 2011 showcase at Wembley. Leverkusen have yet to progress further than the last 16 of the Champions League since losing the 2002 final to Real Madrid. But with the 'little pea' in their ranks, Leverkusen have big ambitions."
58,23/08/2016,15:01,Fractured hand rules Hernandez out of season opener,"A fractured hand, from falling down the stairs at home, means Mexico striker Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez will miss Bayer Leverkusen's opening game of the new season, his club announced Tuesday.","""'Chicharito' suffered a fractured right hand falling down the stairs in his flat last night,"" said Leverkusen in a statement. ""Hernandez was successfully operated on this morning."" Injury means both Hernandez and Leverkusen captain Lars Bender have been ruled out of Saturday's German league match at Borussia Moenchengladbach, the club's first of the season. The pair are expected to be sidelined for the next fortnight. Bender suffered an ankle injury playing for Germany in the men's final of the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games last Saturday, when the Germans lost to Brazil on penalties. His injury was confirmed by an MRI scan by his club in Cologne on Tuesday morning after his return from Brazil. The 28-year-old Hernandez joined Leverkusen from Manchester United in August 2015 and was the club's top-scorer in his first season in Germany with 17 goals in the Bundesliga. Bender has won 19 caps for Germany and has made 174 league appearances for Leverkusen since joining in 2009."
59,08/06/2016,13:54,Kramer leaves Leverkusen for Moenchengladbach,"German international Christoph Kramer has left Bayer Leverkusen to rejoin Borussia Moenchengladbach, the buying club said in a statement released on Wednesday.","The 25-year-old midfielder has signed a five-year contract tying him to Gladbach until June 2021. He previously spent two years at Gladbach from 2013 to 2015, on loan from Leverkusen. ""A year ago we regretfully let Christoph return to Leverkusen and we are even more delighted now that he can come back to Moenchengladbach,"" said sports director Max Eberl. Kramer was part of the Germany squad that won the World Cup in Brazil in 2014 during his previous spell at Moenchengladbach but wasn't picked for Euro 2016. He played 73 times for Borussia during his previously spell while he also went on loan to Bochum in the German second division after originally breaking into the Leverkusen reserve side in 2010. He played 28 times in the league for Leverkusen last season but his position in the side was set to come under threat from Charles Aranguiz and new-signing Julian Baumgartlinger. Leverkusen finished third in the Bundesliga, one place above Gladbach. Kramer will fill the void created at Gladbach by Switzerland international Granit Xhaka's move to Arsenal."
60,20/05/2016,11:44,Germany's Volland signs for Leverkusen,"Hoffenheim's Germany international Kevin Volland has signed a five-year deal with Bayer Leverkusen, the two clubs announced on Friday.","The 23-year-old striker's contract runs until June 30, 2021 and is estimated to be worth 15 million euros ($16.8m). Volland has scored 33 goals and had 38 decisive passes in 132 matches since his arrival in 2012. His contract with Hoffenhim had been due to expire in 2019. With six caps for the German national team since 2014 he was not, however, selected by coach Joachim Loew for his initial 27-man squad for Euro 2016 starting on June 10."

Kiessling has scored 126 league goals in 312 appearances over the last ten years for Bayer. ""Stefan Kiessling is an absolute role model for us and our fans, which is why we have agreed that he will take over a function in the team after his professional career,"" said Bayer's managing director Michael Schade. Kiessling, who last played for Germany in 2010, has only scored four league goals this season, but has played alongside Hernandez when Leverkusen have used a 4-4-2 formation, or come off the bench to replace the Mexican."
62,16/04/2016,17:56,"Leverkusen climb to third, Hernandez limps off","Bayer Leverkusen climbed to third, and are on course for a direct Champions League place next season, after their 3-0 win over Bundesliga strugglers Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday.","Kevin Kampl gave Bayer the lead on 70 minutes, just 43 seconds after coming off the bench for Leverkusen's top scorer, Javier Hernandez, who limped off after pulling up with an injury. The ex-Manchester United and Real Madrid striker has scored 16 goals in 25 league games. Bayer must wait to see if 'Chicharito' will be able to play in their remaining four league games, which include tough matches at Schalke and home to Hertha Berlin. Leverkusen doubled their lead when Julian Brandt converted a superb cross from Germany winger Karim Bellarabi, who had sprinted away from the Frankfurt defence. Bellarabi added a third when he hit the left-hand corner from 20 metres out with 90 minutes played, to leave Frankfurt second from bottom. Leverkusen claim third from Hertha Berlin, who dropped one place after their 2-1 defeat at Hoffenheim. Hertha, who are bidding for a first Champions League place since the 1999/2000 season, are winless in their last three games. Niklas Stark's first-half header was cancelled out by an equaliser from Hoffenheim's Swiss defender Fabian Schaer. Hoffenheim earned the win when Mark Uth headed home at the far post to move his side up to 13th -- three points above the relegation places. Four days after their Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Real Madrid, Wolfsburg lost again when they went down 3-2 at relegation-threatened Werder Bremen. Having lost 3-0 in Madrid, Wolfsburg were well beaten as Claudio Pizarro scored his 102nd goal for Bremen, to become the club's all-time top scorer, by converting a first-half penalty. Wolfsburg's France midfielder Josuha Guilavogui equalised before the break, but Bremen netted goals from Fin Bartels and Mali midfielder Sambou Yatabare. Wolfsburg's director of sport Klaus Allofs was dismissed to the stands early in the second half after arguing with the fourth official. The visitors pulled a late goal back when Dutch striker Bas Dost powered a header home, but Wolfsburg stay eighth. Despite the win, Bremen are in the relegation play-off place, but just three points from 11th place as things remain tight at the bottom. Augsburg stayed just above the relegation places with a 1-0 win at home to VfB Stuttgart as Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason scored their first-half winner with his fifth goal in 10 games. Mid-table Darmstadt enjoyed a 2-0 win over Ingolstadt, while on Friday bottom side Hanover 96 enjoyed a 2-0 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach, but remain 12 points from safety with four games left. On Saturday night, Bayern Munich can extend their seven-point lead when they host Schalke, while on Sunday second-placed Borussia Dortmund are at home to bogey side Hamburg. Dortmund are winless in their last four league games against Hamburg and lost 3-1 away to Bruno Labbadia's team last November."
63,01/04/2016,23:09,Leverkusen convincing winners against Wolfsburg,Mexico star Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez scored his 15th Bundesliga goal of the campaign as Bayer Leverkusen brushed aside Wolfsburg 3-0 on Friday to move into the top four.,"Leverkusen claimed a third straight win, all without conceding a goal, to improve their prospects of Champions League qualification, while the result may have ended Wolfsburg's hopes of a top-four finish. Roger Schmidt's side led at the interval at the BayArena thanks to a fine strike by youngster Julian Brandt, who exchanged passes with Hakan Calhanoglu before slotting low past Diego Benaglio from the edge of the area. Hernandez, just back from international duty across the Atlantic, emerged from the bench in the second half and made it 2-0 with an excellent curling strike in off the far post. And fellow substitute Vladlen Yurchenko also got his name on the scoresheet, his first Bundesliga goal coming before the Chilean midfielder Charles Aranguiz came on to make his debut for Leverkusen. Aranguiz had signed on at the BayArena last summer after helping his country win the Copa America, only to succumb to injury almost immediately. Schalke 04 and Borussia Moenchengladbach will both hope to climb back above Leverkusen later this weekend. Schalke go to Ingolstadt while Gladbach face a tough test at home to Hertha Berlin, who are third, on Sunday. The defeat was hardly ideal preparation for Wolfsburg ahead of their Champions League quarter-final, first leg against Real Madrid next Wednesday. Dieter Hecking's side have gone three Bundesliga games without a win and are eighth in the table."
64,20/03/2016,19:31,Ramos helps seal Dortmund comeback win,Second-placed Borussia Dortmund trimmed Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the Bundesliga to five points on Sunday with a superb 3-1 comeback win at Augsburg.,"Dortmund's Adrian Ramos, in for striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who sat out after the death of his grandfather, played a big part in turning the game Borussia's way in the second-half. Augsburg took an shock lead at their WKK Arena when Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason slotted home Brazilian winger Caiuby's cross on 16 minutes. But Dortmund winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan dragged his side back into the game with an equaliser just before the half-time whistle after superb passing from Marco Reus and Nuri Sahin. Ramos then came into his own, showing great skill in chesting down Mats Hummels' long ball for replacement Gonzalo Castro to fire home on 69 minutes. The Colombia international then netted on 75 minutes to give Dortmund the three points that keep them in touch with Pep Guardiola's Bayern. The defeat leaves Augsburg just above the relegation places on goal difference. Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen rejoined the fight for a Champions League qualifying berth with a 2-0 win at VfB Stuttgart that saw them break back into the top six. Goals by Julian Brandt and Karim Bellarabi handed Leverkusen a win that put them level on points with fifth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach and two points behind Schalke, who sit in the fourth place that offers a spot in next season's Champions League play-offs. Germany Under-21 star Brandt gave the vistors the lead at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena on 11 minutes when he finished off a flowing attack. Bellarabi celebrated his call-up to the Germany squad for the forthcoming internationals against England and Italy by adding Leverkusen's second on 49 minutes. Brandt, 19, could have claimed his second of the game, but his shot hit the post when he got away from the Stuttgart defence with an hour gone. On Saturday, Robert Lewandowski's 25th league goal of the season gave leaders Bayern Munich a 1-0 win at Cologne. Hertha Berlin remain on course to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1999/2000 after a 2-1 victory over Ingolstadt in the capital kept them four points clear of Schalke in third. Wolfsburg, who will face Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals next month, needed a last-minute Andre Schuerrle equaliser to grab a 1-1 draw at home to Darmstadt as they stay eighth. In the battle to avoid relegation, Hoffenheim claimed a precious 3-1 win at Hamburg, while Eintracht Frankfurt beat Hanover 96 1-0 to leave their opponents 10 points adrift at the bottom."

The Japanese says he felt lethargic and should have dropped out of the matchday squad before kick-off to allow his rival Diekmeier, who became a father for the third time last week, to play the full 90 minutes. ""To be honest, I have a really bad conscience about Dennis,"" Sakai told magazine Kicker. ""He was fit and could play, while I had to be replaced because I still felt sluggish. ""It was disrespectful of me and I later apologised to him."" Sakai was not the only Hamburg player guilty of a poor performance in Leverkusen as Sweden midfielder Albin Ekdal's own goal gave the three points to Bayer, who had Croatia defender Tin Jedvaj sent off late in the game for a second yellow card. Having made 25 appearances for Japan, Sakai earned his place in Hamburg's starting line-up with a strong performance in their 2-0 win at home to third-placed Hertha Berlin the weekend before. But the 25-year-old was laid out with flu last Wednesday and Thursday and only confessed to Hamburg coach Bruno Labbadia during the half-time break that he was not fully fit. ""After that he took me off and rightly so,"" added Sakai. Labbadia felt compelled to comment on Sakai's apology. ""Oh, this Japanese politeness - how nice,"" said Hamburg's head coach."

Despite the three points, it was a frustrating afternoon for Roger Schmidt's Leverkusen, who failed to finish a stream of chances and ended with ten men. Their Mexico striker Javier Hernandez failed to add to his 14 league goals this season as 'Chicharito' headed wide of the post with just 45 seconds gone. Leverkusen had Croatia right-back Tin Jedvaj sent off in the dying stages after being shown two yellow cards in quick succession. The first was for time wasting and the second was for mocking referee Christian Dingert. On Saturday, Thomas Mueller and Thiago Alcantara netted twice as leaders Bayern Munich warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League last 16 clash at home to Juventus with a 5-0 win over Werder Bremen. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund playing Mainz on Sunday, Pep Guardiola's team took the chance to reopen an eight-point gap at the top. It took Bayern just nine minutes to take the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena as Thiago scored his first league goal since February 2014. Robert Lewandowski, the league's top scorer with 24 goals, came off the bench to claim Bayern's fourth as Bremen were routed. Wolfsburg suffered a Champions League hangover with a 1-0 defeat at relegation-threatened Hoffenheim. Wolfsburg reached the last eight in Europe for the first time in the club's history as Tuesday's 1-0 win at home to Gent sealed a 4-2 win on aggregate in the last 16. But Dieter Hecking's side were stunned by second-from-bottom Hoffenheim as Andrej Kramaric, on loan from Leicester City, scored after just three minutes. It could have been more as Kevin Volland had a second-half penalty saved. The defeat leaves Wolfsburg four points outside the top six while Hoffenheim remain three points from safety. Hoffenheim's win pushed bottom side Hanover 96 closer to relegation as they suffered a 2-0 defeat at home to Cologne with Leonardo Bittencourt scoring both goals. Eintracht Frankfurt's new coach Niko Kovac suffered a 3-0 defeat on his Bundesliga debut at Borussia Moenchengladbach to stay in the relegation places. Gladbach's Lars Stindl, Raffael and Mahmoud Dahoud scored the goals as Gladbach climbed to fourth. A foul on South Korea midfielder Koo Ja-Cheol in the dying stages of Augsburg's 2-2 draw at Darmstadt led to his side converting a penalty to take a crucial point. Augsburg are deep in the relegation battle as one of three teams on 27 points and just above the relegation places. Australia striker Mathew Leckie scored only his second goal of the season as he headed home from close range in mid-table Ingolstadt's 3-3 draw at home to Stuttgart. On Friday, Hertha Berlin cemented third place in the table with a 2-0 win over nearest rivals Schalke thanks to goals from Niklas Stark and Vedad Ibisevic."

Later on Saturday, second-placed Borussia Dortmund host leaders Bayern Munich in a mouth-watering clash. Draxler, who also netted in Wolfsburg's 4-0 drubbing of bottom side Hanover 96 on Tuesday, opened the scoring at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena. The attacking midfielder claimed his fourth goal in his last four games when he crashed home Andre Schuerrle's final pass with 15 minutes gone. His Germany team-mate Max Kruse added a second just two minutes later as the hosts raced into a 2-0 lead. Gladbach, who dropped to fifth, pulled a goal back when Brazilian striker Raffael claimed his 12th goal of the season on 23 minutes. Bayer Leverkusen came back from 3-0 down to avoid a fourth straight league defeat in their 3-3 draw at Augsburg. Augsburg's South Korea striker Koo Ja-Cheol scored his first hat-trick in Germany's top flight to put the hosts 3-0 up mid-way through the second-half. Koo, playing his sixth season in Germany after spells at Wolfsburg and Mainz, wrapped up his hat-trick inside the hour. Leverkusen fought back with goals by Karim Bellarabi and an own goal from Augsburg's Dutch defender Paul Verhaegh on 80 minutes. In the dying stages, defender Jeffrey Gouweleeuw used his hands to block a shot which saw the referee point straight to the penalty spot. Augsburg were denied a first win over Leverkusen at the tenth attempt when Hakan Calhanoglu converted the 92nd-minute spot kick as Gouweleeuw was sent off. Leverkusen's suspended coach Roger Schmidt was in Spain to watch Villarreal ahead of their Europa League last 16, first leg trip on Thursday. Having shocked Leverkusen 4-1 on Wednesday when Claudio Pizarro scored a hat-trick, Werder Bremen pulled further away from the relegation zone with a 4-1 thrashing at home to bottom side Hanover 96. The 37-year-old Pizarro claimed his fourth goal in two games, and his 11th league goal of the season, when he flicked the ball over his shoulder, beating three defenders, and rifled home on 26 minutes. He then provided an assist as Czech international Gebre Selassie added Bremen's third on 56 minutes. Stuttgart are now up to mid-table after their 5-1 thrashing of second-from-bottom Hoffenheim as defender Georg Niedermeier netted twice. Hoffenheim, under coach Julian Nagelsmann, 28, the youngest coach in Bundesliga history, remain four points from safety with nine games left. Schalke are fourth after their 3-1 win at Cologne thanks to goals from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Max Meyer and Argentina striker Franco di Santo who scored straight after coming off the bench."
70,04/03/2016,02:10,Dortmund out to trim Bayern's lead in showdown,Germany's top two clubs go head to head on Saturday with hosts Borussia Dortmund out to ignite the Bundesliga title race by further trimming the lead of Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich.,"Bayern seemed to be running away with a fourth straight league title, and enjoyed an eight-point lead over second-placed Dortmund, until Mainz slammed on the brakes with a shock 2-1 win at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday. It was only Bayern's second league defeat of the season. Dortmund's 2-0 win at Darmstadt the same night meant Bayern's lead was cut to five points and adds spice to an already mouth-watering clash at Borussia's Signal Iduna Park, but the Bavarians remain favourites. When the sides met last October, Bayern dealt Dortmund a 5-1 thrashing in Munich. Bayern have won four of the last five league meetings including victories in both of their last two visits to Dortmund. Dortmund's single Bundesliga victory over Bayern in the last four years was a 3-0 thumping in Munich in April 2014 when Guardiola's side had already won the league title with a record seven games to spare. But for the first time in his three seasons at Bayern, Guardiola has a league rival breathing down his neck. ""This Borussia Dortmund team is completely different to the last three years,"" said the Spaniard after losing to Mainz. ""We will have to fight until the last game and the last second."" The Dortmund camp has sniffed weakness in their rivals. ""Let's not beat about the bush -- we want to cut the gap to two points,"" said Dortmund captain Mats Hummels. ""Saturday's going to be a brilliant game, we'll be really up for it."" Guardiola has a longer injury list than Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, who is only missing centre-back Sokratis from his first-choice line-up. Injuries to Jerome Boateng, Javi Martinez and Holger Badstuber have forced Guardiola to convert left-back David Alaba into a centre-back alongside Mehdi Benatia. But Guardiola has an embarrassment of riches in midfield with Franck Ribery back from injury and Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze unable to get a game. Whether he plays or not, Goetze, like fellow ex-Borussia star Robert Lewandowski, can expect a another hostile reception from home fans on his return to Dortmund. A sub-plot to the showdown sees the league's top three scorers shooting it out in Dortmund. Bayern's Lewandowski tops the list with 23 goals in his 23 games while Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is just one behind with 22. Munich's Thomas Mueller has also scored a highly respectable 17 league goals. Between them, Mueller and Lewandowski have 40 league goals. They are just 14 short of the league record partnership of 54 set by Wolfsburg pair Edin Dzeko and Grafite in 2009. ""You sometimes get games (like the Mainz defeat), but it will be different in Dortmund,"" promised Lewandowski ominously. There will be a relegation battle royale when Werder Bremen, who stunned Bayer Leverkusen 4-1 on Wednesday thanks to veteran Claudio Pizarro's hat-trick, host bottom side Hanover 96. Bremen remain just one place above the bottom three while Hanover, who have playmaker Hiroshi Kiyotake back from injury, are seven points from safety and desperately need to win. Second-bottom Hoffenheim will be looking to build on their 2-1 win over Augsburg when they travel to Stuttgart, who are winless in their last three games after a surge which carried them up to mid-table.

71,02/03/2016,22:42,Bayern lose perfect home record to give Dortmund hope,"Bayern Munich suffered a shock 2-1 defeat to Mainz on Wednesday, losing their 100 percent home record this season, as their lead in the Bundesliga was trimmed to five points.","The result shakes up the title race ahead of Saturday's crunch clash when Pep Guardiola's Bayern play at second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba came off the bench to seal only Mainz's second victory in Munich with the winner on 86 minutes to finish off a counter-attack. ""We had our chances and then let them counter-attack. We shouldn't have allowed that to happen,"" fumed Bayern's goal-scorer Arjen Robben. Mainz took a shock lead at the Allianz Arena when Spanish winger Jairo fired home in the first-half with the Bayern defence well beaten. Robben pulled a goal back for the Bavarians on 64 minutes. Despite Mainz managing only 22 percent of possession, Cordoba grabbed the late winner and was mobbed by his team-mates. ""We knew how we could win here with a strong defensive display and a good counter-attack,"" said Mainz coach Martin Schmidt, who praised his side's 'outstanding display'. ""It feels really good."" Dortmund's 2-0 win at Darmstadt on Wednesday cut Bayern's lead from eight points to five as another Colombia striker, Adrian Ramos, and defender Erik Durm netted. ""We and Bayern both know that things can now be a bit tight. We want to win the thing,"" said Dortmund's Germany defender Durm. Hertha Berlin cemented third place, but remain 15 points adrift of Dortmund, with a 2-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the capital. Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou and Mitchell Weiser scored to keep Hertha on course for a first return to the Champions League since 2000. At the other end of the table, Werder Bremen climbed out of the relegation places with a shock 4-1 win at Bayer Leverkusen as veteran Claudio Pizarro claimed a hat-trick. The 37-year-old Peru international showed why he is the Bundesliga's top scoring foreigner by needing just under half an hour to wrap up his hat-trick which included a penalty. Having knocked Leverkusen out of the German Cup in the quarter-finals last month, Bremen again humbled Bayer. Roger Schmidt's Leverkusen has now lost four of their last five games in all competitions and drop to seventh in the league. Elsewhere Schalke climbed to sixth with a 3-2 comeback win at home to Hamburg while Borussia Moenchengladbach remain fourth after their 4-0 thrashing at home to Stuttgart. Second-from-bottom Hoffenheim boosted their survival chances with a 2-1 win over Augsburg. On Tuesday, Germany winger Andre Schuerrle claimed the first Bundesliga hat-trick of his career as Wolfsburg routed bottom side Hanover 96 4-0 away. March 1 is a lucky day for Schuerrle who also scored a hat-trick for ex-club Chelsea against Fulham in the Premier League exactly two years ago. His performance will boost his standing at Wolfsburg and in this one game he has scored more goals than in his previous 33 matches for the Champions League side. He needed just 26 minutes to score three goals before Germany team-mate Julian Draxler added Wolfsburg's fourth at Hanover's HDI Arena. The win leaves Wolfsburg eighth while Hanover are bottom, four points from their nearest rival and seven points from safety. The German FA (DFB) is expected to fine both clubs after one of the flares fired from the away fan block hit the Hanover bench before kick-off, but no-one was hurt. Elsewhere, French striker Anthony Modeste rescued a point for Cologne in their 1-1 draw at Ingolstadt after forward Lukas Hinterseer had given the hosts the lead."

Injury and illness mean Wolfsburg have 12 players either ruled out or struggling to be fit to face Pep Guardiola's league leaders at the Volkswagen Arena. Bayern are eight points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund -- and a massive 28 ahead of eighth-placed Wolfsburg. Between them Lewandowski and fellow Bayern forward Thomas Mueller have scored a combined tally of 39 Bundesliga goals -- more than the entire Wolfsburg team. Wolfsburg's ex-Bayern defender Dante says the only way to stop Lewandowski is to cut off his supply. ""If we defend as a team and the ball doesn't come to him, then he can't really do anything,"" said the Brazilian. ""We have to really get things going and be up for the game. ""We have to go into each one-on-one with real passion and every pass must hit the target."" Four days after their 2-2 draw at Juventus in the Champions League, Guardiola is set to rotate his Bayern squad, especially with defenders Holger Badstuber, Jerome Boateng and Javi Martinez all sidelined. Winger Franck Ribery could start his first Bundesliga game for a year, while Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking could be down to his third-choice goalkeeper with Diego Benaglio injured and Koen Casteels recovering from flu. On Sunday evening, Dortmund host rejuvented strugglers Hoffenheim. Thomas Tuchel's side is a force to be reckoned with and are unbeaten this season at their Signal Iduna Park stadium having picked up 28 points from a possible 30 at home. Second-from-bottom Hoffenheim earned fresh hope in the relegation battle when they claimed a 3-2 win over Mainz last weekend under their 28-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann. Dortmund will be without Greek centre-back Sokratis, who is sidelined for three weeks with a groin injury, and Neven Subotic is set to take his place. Hertha Berlin are at Cologne on Friday night hoping to end their run of five league games without a win despite staying third in the table. Hertha coach Pal Dardai will be counting on Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou to add to his tally of eight goals scored away from home, the most on the road for any Bundesliga player. Bayer Leverkusen will not have coach Roger Schmidt on their bench for Sunday's match at Mainz. The 48-year-old is banned for three league games, and was fined 20,000 euros ($22,031), for refusing a referee's order to leave the touchline during last Sunday's 1-0 league defeat at home to Dortmund. Mainz are up to seventh in the table and are unbeaten in their last five home games, while Leverkusen's defeat to Dortmund broke their six-game unbeaten run.

Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller has also been fined 10,000 euros after describing the referee's decision to send Schmidt to the stands as 'completely unnecessary' during a post-match rant. Schmidt became engaged in an angry exchange with referee Felix Zwayer following Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 64th-minute goal at the BayArena last Sunday that gave Borussia Dortmund a 1-0 victory over Leverkusen in Germany's top flight. Schmidt was ordered to the stands, but refused to leave the technical area, demanding an explanation for Zwayer's decision and the referee reacted by stopping play and walking off the pitch with his assistants. The match eventually restarted nine minutes later when Schmidt accepted the referee's decision and the 48-year-old later admitted he was wrong to have lost his temper. The DFB has specified that Schmidt must have no contact with his players, directly or indirectly, from half an hour before each game until 30 minutes after the final whistle. As well as the sidelines, he is banned from the team dressing room, the area around it and the players' tunnel."

Schmidt became engaged in an angry exchange with referee Felix Zwayer following Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 64th-minute goal at the Bayrena that gave Dortmund victory. He was ordered to the stands but refused to leave the technical area, and Zwayer reacted by stopping play and walking off the pitch with his assistants. The match eventually restarted nine minutes later when Schmidt accepted the referee's decision. The 48-year-old was furious that Dortmund were allowed to take a quick free-kick in the build-up to Aubameyang's goal, but he later apologised. ""I made a mistake that hurt my team,"" Schmidt said later, but Leverkusen sporting director Rudi Voeller hit out at the referee. ""To interrupt the match like that and cause such confusion was not necessary,"" the former Germany striker told Sky. ""A referee can be sent to the stands but he needs to be told the reason why, and this was not done."" Herbert Fandel, the DFB's head of referees, insisted that Zwayer made the correct decision and said that ""in no circumstances can a coach ignore that decision."""
75,21/02/2016,17:54,Coach's protest halts play as 'Auba' seals Dortmund win,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored his 21st league goal in Borussia Dortmund's controversial 1-0 win at Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday after the referee made Bundesliga history by briefly stopping play.,"Confusion reigned for around nine second-half minutes at Leverkusen's BayArena when Bayer coach Roger Schmidt refused to be sent to the stands by match official Felix Zwayer amidst tense scenes. The 48-year-old Schmidt was furious that Dortmund were allowed to take a free kick in the build up to Aubameyang's 64th-minute winner and stood his ground. The controversy was triggered when Leverkusen striker Stefan Kiessling pushed over Dortmund's Sven Bender in the Borussia half. Zwayer awarded a free kick, which Matthias Ginter quickly took. The move swept down field and Germany defender Erik Durm's pass pulled the Leverkusen defence to create space for Aubameyang to hit the winner. The Leverkusen team, with Kiessling and Schmidt at the forefront, furiously protested that the game should have been stopped for the free-kick to be taken. When Schmidt refused Zwayer's demand that he went to the stands, the Berlin official marched the teams off until the Bayer coach took a seat in the grandstands. It was the first time in Bundesliga history that a game has been stopped under such circumstances. When play resumed, Leverkusen's star striker Javier Hernandez wasted a golden chance in added time to equalise by firing over the bar with the goal at his mercy. Dortmund's controversial victory leaves them eight ponts behind runaway league leaders Bayern Munich who beat Darmstadt 3-1 at home on Saturday. Thomas Mueller netted twice to dig Bayern out of trouble in their last match before their Champions League clash at Juventus before Robert Lewandowski added their third goal. Against the run of play, Pep Guardiola's Bayern went behind when Darmstadt's Munich-born striker Sandro Wagner headed home midway through the first half. It was only the fifth time this season Bayern had gone behind. But using their 81 percent possession to fire in a total of 36 shots on goal to Darmstadt's six, Guardiola's side roared back to claim their 19th win in 22 league games this season. Bayern were back level four minutes into the second half when Mueller slammed his shot into the right-hand corner. He added a superb second -- his 17th league goal of the season -- by chesting down Arturo Vidal's cross and hitting a bicycle kick into Darmstadt's net on 71 minutes. Lewandowski added the third on 84 minutes when he converted Franck Ribery's low cross after the Frenchman came off the bench for only his third appearance of the season. It was Lewandowski's 22nd goal of the season in 21 league games to leave him as the league's top scorer. Elsewhere, fresh from their 3-2 Champions League win at Gent in midweek, Wolfsburg picked up a point in the capital with a 1-1 draw at Hertha Berlin. Wolves took the lead at the Olympic Stadium when Marcel Schaefer converted Vieirinha's cross on 53 minutes, but Salomon Kalou on the hour mark. Julian Nagelsmann, the Bundesliga's youngest ever coach at 28, steered Hoffenheim to only their third win of the season on just his second match in charge with a 3-2 victory at home to Mainz. Hoffenheim remain 17th, but are now only three points from safety after Werder Bremen, who are 16th, lost 2-0 at Ingolstadt. Cologne fans protested about the price of away tickets at Borussia Moenchengladbach as the hosts sealed a 1-0 win thanks to Mahmoud Dahoud's first-half goal."
76,19/02/2016,02:10,Bayern eye club record at home to Darmstadt,Bayern Munich could make club history on Saturday as a clean sheet against Darmstadt in the Bundesliga would see Pep Guardiola's side go a record six home games without conceding a goal.,"Arsenal were the last club to score against Bayern at Munich's Allianz Arena back in November when Olivier Giroud scored the Gunners' consolation in a 5-1 loss. Since that Champions League group game, Bayern have won all five of their home games in all competitions without conceding a single goal and hold an eight-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Guardiola's team are in no mood to give Darmstadt any hope of a first win in Munich in their final match before their Champions League last 16, first-leg clash at Juventus next Tuesday. Especially as Darmstadt have picked up 17 of their 24 points this season away from home. ""They will play very deep and very compact,"" said Bayern midfielder Xabi Alonso. ""We will have to be patient and it'll be important to get the first goal. ""It's all about Darmstadt for now, we want to keep our eight-point lead. Only afterwards will we think about Juventus."" With 21 goals to his credit, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski has scored almost as many goals as the 22 the entire Darmstadt team has managed. The visitors' cause is not helped by a raft of suspensions. Peter Niemeyer, Jerome Gondorf, Aytac Sulu, Marcel Heller and Konstantin Rausch are all banned after each picked up yellow cards in last Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Bayer Leverkusen. ""We have registered that. However, I believe that no one wants to miss this chance to play in front of an audience of millions,"" said Darmstadt coach Dirk Schuster confidently. Guardiola hopes to have centre-backs Medhi Benatia and Serdar Tasci fit as he was unable to play a single central defender in last weekend's win at Augsburg after Holger Badstuber fractured an ankle. Dortmund will be looking to make it nine games undefeated at Leverkusen on Sunday. Thomas Tuchel's Dortmund are in impressive form as last Saturday's 1-0 win over bottom side Hanover 96 left them 13 points clear of third-placed Bayer. Having sat out the Hanover win, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will be looking to add to his 20 goals in as many league games to rival Lewandowski. The last time Leverkusen beat Dortmund at the BayArena was in May 2007, but Roger Schmidt's men have picked up 14 of a possible 18 points and are undefeated in their last six games. Leverkusen will again be without striker Javier Hernandez after the Mexican tore a buttock muscle in their German Cup defeat to Werder Bremen 10 days ago. Cologne fans plan a protest before kick-off of Saturday's match at Borussia Moenchengladbach over the restricted number of away fans allowed. Gladbach will be without centre-back Martin Stranzl, who tore his right calf in training on Wednesday as they look to bounce back from Sunday's shock defeat to Hamburg. Fresh from their Champions League last 16, first-leg win at Gent, Wolfsburg are at Hertha Berlin on Saturday without defender Sebastian Jung. The right-back tore the cruciate ligament in his left knee in Belgium and is expected to miss the rest of the season after limping out of Wolfsburg's 3-2 victory.

77,13/02/2016,17:48,Mkhitaryan seals Dortmund win to trim Bayern lead,Henrikh Mkhitaryan's superb second-half goal sealed Borussia Dortmund's 1-0 win over Hanover 96 on Saturday to trim Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the Bundesliga to five points.,"Dortmund were without injured star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who missed his first league match of the season having netted 20 goals in as many league games. In his absence, Mkhitaryan showed superb individual skill for the winner at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park. With Marcel Schmelzer screaming up in support on his left, Mkhitaryan cut back inside and curled his right-footed shot around Hanover's Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler on 57 minutes. With Pep Guardiola's Bayern at Augsburg on Sunday, Dortmund remain second while Hanover are rooted to the bottom, seven points from safety. Wolfsburg warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League, last 16, first-leg at Ghent with a 2-0 win at home to Ingolstadt to pick up their first victory since knocking Manchester United out of Europe in December. Dieter Hecking's Wolfsburg won for the first time in six games but stay eighth after first-half goals goals by Germany midfielder Julian Draxler and defender Robin Knoche. Bayer Leverkusen moved up from seventh to third as they bounced back from their shock German Cup exit at the hands of Werder Bremen in mid-week with a 2-1 comeback win at Darmstadt. On a heavy pitch, Sandro Wagner stabbed the ball home to give Darmstadt an early lead, despite Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno catching him around the throat with his forearm. Leverkusen drew level when Darmstadt defender Aytac Sulu headed into his own net on 62 minutes. The visitors then took the lead with a sweeping move which went the length of the pitch. From a Darmstadt corner, junior Julian Brandt started the move he finished by tapping home Kevin Kampl's final pass for the winner on 77 minutes. VfB Stuttgart's impressive form continued as they picked up their fifth-straight league win to go ninth with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin. A long-range strike from Ivory Coast defensive midfielder Serey Die and a second-half goal from left-wing Filip Kostic sealed the hosts' win. Hertha suffered their first defeat in nine games since losing 2-0 at Bayern in November to drop to fourth. The youngest manager in Bundesliga history made his debut when Julian Nagelsmann, 28, was on Hoffenheim's bench for their 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen in the basement battle. Nagelsmann took over after predecessor Huub Stevens resigned on Wednesday due to heart problems. Despite Hoffenheim taking the lead on 10 minutes through Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric, Werder hit back three minutes later as former Chelsea defender Papy Djilobodji scored his first Bremen goal. The result leaves both teams in the relegation places."
78,10/02/2016,15:54,Torn buttock keeps Bayer's Hernandez out,"Bayer Leverkusen will be without Mexican striker Javier Hernandez for this weekend's Bundesliga match at Darmstadt with a torn buttock muscle, his club announced on Wednesday.","'Chicharito' suffered the injury in Leverkusen's 3-1 defeat at home to Werder Bremen in the quarter-finals of the German Cup and clutched his leg when he went off in the 57th minute. The 27-year-old has been in great form with 22 goals in 26 matches in all competitions since joining Leverkusen from Manchester United. Leverkusen are fifth in the league table and it is unclear when they will be able to rely on their Central American forward again, ahead of their Europa League round of 32, first leg match at Sporting Lisbon on Thursday February 18. With 13 goals in his 17 league games, Hernandez is the fourth-highest scorer in the Bundesliga behind Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (20), plus Bayern Munich pair Robert Lewandowski (19) and Thomas Mueller (14)."
79,09/02/2016,22:49,Aubameyang nets 30th goal as Dortmund reach semis,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang claimed his 30th goal of the season on Tuesday to help fire Borussia Dortmund into the German Cup semi-finals with a 3-1 victory at VfB Stuttgart.,"Gabon striker Aubameyang and Germany winger Marco Reus, who have provided 45 of Dortmund's goals in all competitions this season, netted before Henrik Mkhitaryan claimed their late third. Aubameyang has now scored in each of Dortmund's last seven German Cup games, dating back to the start of last season, having also netted in Dortmund's 3-1 Cup final defeat to Wolfsburg last May. ""Auba knows how to take his chances and he works hard on his finishing every day,"" said Reus. ""It's fun to play alongside him."" Dortmund are in the semi-finals for the third season in a row while spirited Stuttgart had their five-match winning streak, dating back to mid-December, ended. Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich will attempt to join Dortmund in the last four when they play VfL Bochum on Wednesday while minnows Heidenheim host Hertha Berlin. Dortmund took the lead at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena when Reus fired home off the crossbar with just five minutes gone. Stuttgart fought back and levelled when Lukas Rupp's shot deflected off Mkhitaryan and into the Dortmund net on 21 minutes to the home fans' delight. The visitors regained the lead when Reus set up Aubameyang for his 30th in all competitions, on 31 minutes as Stuttgart failed to cope with Dortmund's pace. With time running out, Aubameyang broke clear and pulled Stuttgart goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak off his line to allow Mkhitaryan a simple tap-in on 89 minutes. Earlier, veteran Claudio Pizarro helped seal Werder Bremen's 3-1 quarter-final win at ten-man Bayer Leverkusen by playing a key role in their shock victory. There was a strong Latin American flavour at Leverkusen's BayArena as Bremen booked their place in April's semi-finals. Mexico's Javier Hernandez put Leverkusen ahead, then Bremen's Argentinian centre-back Santiago Garcia levelled before Brazilian defender Wendell was sent off for Bayer just before the half-time break. After Wendall's dismissal, Peru's 37-year-old striker Pizarro scored Bremen's second by converting the resulting penalty, then set up their third. ""We did very well defensively and we reacted as a unit after conceding a goal,"" beamed Pizarro. ""Now we get to go further in the Cup."" Leverkusen took the lead when ex-Manchester United forward Hernandez continued his record of scoring in each round of the cup. It was his 22nd goal for Bayer this season in all competitions. After Stefan Kiessling was up-ended by Bremen's Spanish defender Alejandro Galvez in the area, 'Chicharito' rifled home the resulting penalty in the 22nd minute. The lead lasted nine minutes as Bremen's Argentinian centre-back Santiago Garcia put Werder level by hitting the bottom left-hand corner of Leverkusen's net to make it 1-1. Disaster struck for the hosts when Wendell was shown a straight red for hauling down Bartels, who was through on goal, just before the break The 37-year-old Pizarro, who last weekend became the first foreign player to make 400 Bundesliga appearances, hit his eighth goal of the season. Pizarro then played a big part in Bremen's third as his shot was saved by Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno, but Florian Grillitsch tapped home the rebound on 82 minutes."

On Wednesday, second-division Heidenheim host Hertha Berlin from Germany's top tier, while Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich are at second-division VfL Bochum."
81,06/02/2016,20:49,Alonso sees red as Bayern labour in Leverkusen,Xabi Alonso was sent off on Saturday as ten-man Bayern Munich laboured to a goalless draw at Bayer Leverkusen at the end of a turbulent week for the Bundesliga leaders.,"Spain midfielder Alonso saw red after earning two second-half bookings in quick succession at the BayArena. Having brought down junior German international Julian Brandt in the second-half, a tactical foul on Leverkusen's star striker Javi Hernandez saw Alonso sent off. It was the fifth time Alonso, who has played for Liverpool and Real Madrid, has been sent off in his club career and it was his first red in Germany. ""That wasn't a yellow card,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola after seeing a replay of Alonso's bodycheck on Hernandez. ""We struggled in the first half to put three or four passes together. If you can't do that, it's impossible to play,"" added Guardiola. ""I think we did enough in the second half to win it, but it's never easy in Leverkusen."" The 45-year-old is already annoyed with repeated questions following Monday's announcement that he will coach Manchester City next season. ""No more questions on this topic, please,"" he said tersely when asked if he finds it hard to remain focused on Bayern. The result leaves Bayern eight points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund at the end of a week to forget for the Bavarian giants. On Wednesday, Bayern strongly denied allegations midfielder Arturo Vidal was repeatedly drunk at last month's training camp in Doha. Both the club and player say they will sue magazine Sport Bild over the claim. Vidal started against Leverkusen as Guardiola played a back three after injuries left him with only one fit centre-back in Holger Badstuber. Despite having scored 19 goals in as many league games this season, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski failed to convert either of his two shots at goal. Leverkusen restricted the visitors to just nine shots overall to the hosts' six. Earlier, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the Bundesliga's top-scorer, had also failed to score in Dortmund's uninspiring goalless draw at Hertha Berlin with Jose Mourinho watching. Aubameyang, who has netted 20 league goals, had a rare off day in Berlin, managing just 11 touches in his 71 minutes and failed to create a single shot on goal. The Gabon forward -- Africa's player of the year -- was eventually hauled off by Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel and was left scowling on the bench. It was only the sixth time this season 'Auba' has failed to score in one of Dortmund's league games. The game failed to deliver as second-placed Dortmund remained ten points clear of Hertha. Less than a fortnight before their Champions League last 16, first-leg clash at Ghent, Wolfsburg crashed to a 3-0 defeat at Schalke to remain winless in their last five games. Dieter Hecking's Wolves had few answers as Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Johannes Geis and new-signing Alessandro Schoepf netted for Schalke. The result pushed the Royal Blues up to fourth as Wolfsburg drop to eighth. Stuttgart are now up to 11th, five points from the bottom three, with their fourth straight league win in a bad-tempered 4-2 victory at Eintracht Frankfurt as both sides finished with 10 men. Stuttgart raced into a 2-0 lead as Christian Gentner, then Daniel Didavi scored for the visitors before but the latter was shown a red card after picking up a second booking on 67 minutes. Frankfurt captain Alex Meier pulled it back to 2-1 with 40 minutes left before Stuttgart pulled away with goals by defender Georg Niedermeier and Filip Kostic. Eintracht defender Carlos Zambrano also saw red after being sent off 15 minutes from time for his second booking. Frankfurt's Szabolcs Huszti then made it 4-2 by scoring in the 90th minute. Hanover 96 remain rooted to the bottom of the table after their 1-0 defeat at home to Mainz as Spanish midfielder Jairo scored the first-half winner. Ingolstadt won the Bavaria derby with a 2-1 win at home to Augsburg thanks to Moritz Hartmann's winning penalty five minutes from time. On Friday, Borussia Moenchengladbach got back to winning ways with a 5-1 thrashing of strugglers Werder Bremen as teenage Danish defender Andreas Christensen, on loan from Chelsea, netted twice."
82,21/11/2015,17:53,Wolfsburg warm-up for Moscow by hammering Bremen,Germany striker Max Kruse netted twice in Wolfsburg's 6-0 rout of Werder Bremen in the German league on Saturday to warm-up for Wednesday's key Champions League clash in Moscow.,"In Europe, Wolfsburg are third in Group B, but just a point behind leaders Manchester United ahead of their penultimate group game at bottom side CSKA Moscow in the Russian capital on Wednesday. The Germans still have every chance of qualifying for the knock-out stages and consolidated third in the German league table by hammering Bremen. There was a minute's silence at all Bundesliga grounds this weekend -- the players also wore black armbands -- out of respect for the victims of the Paris terror attacks. Stuttgart's 4-0 thumping at home to Augsburg was delayed by 15 minutes due to the tightened security checks at stadiums across the country. There were no such problems at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena as Bremen gifted their hosts the opener when defender Alejandro Galvez slid the ball into his own net on 11 minutes. Kruse put Wolfsburg 2-0 up at the break by heading home a free-kick then Portugal international Vierinha scored from the right wing on 56 minutes. The floodgates opened when French defensive midfielder, on for the injured Brazil star Luiz Gustavo, stabbed home his shot on 67 minutes. Kruse then set up Netherlands striker Bas Dost on 78 minutes before completing the scoring three minutes from time by converting a cross from Germany team-mate Andre Schuerrle to leave him with five league goals for the season. The result leaves Wolfsburg five points behind second-placed Borussia Dortmund who lost 3-1 at Hamburg on Friday night, while leaders Bayern Munich play at Schalke on Saturday evening. Ex-Manchester United star Javier Hernandez now has 12 goals for Bayer Leverkusen in all competitions after scoring twice in their 3-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Christmas came early for 'Chicharito' in Frankfurt when Eintracht centre-back David Abraham allowed a cross to roll between his legs and the grateful Hernandez stabbed home on 11 minutes. The Mexico striker doubled his tally on 39 minutes when a Hakan Calhanoglu pass split the Frankfurt defence. Hernandez did the rest, but it finished 2-1 at the break when Serbian midfielder Slobodan Medojevic slammed in a powerful header on the stroke of half-time. Calhanoglu made sure of the three points by scoring Leverkusen's third on 72 minutes. Augsburg climbed off the bottom of the table with an emphatic 4-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. Woeful defending by the hosts allowed Augsburg to race into an early 2-0 lead with both goals by midfielder Alexander Esswein. Defender Jan-Ingwer Callsen-Bracker grabbed a third before former South Korea captain Koo Ja-Cheol scored Augsburg's fourth when he hit the top right-hand corner from 10 metres out on 54 minutes. The Rhine derby finished goalless as Mainz drew at Cologne as the hosts abandoned plans to play in a special-edition carnival-themed shirt out of respect for those who died in Paris."

The 25-year-old, who has won 10 caps for Germany, suffered the injury in Bayer's 2-1 defeat at home to Cologne on Saturday in the Rhine derby and he will remain in Leverkusen to receive treatment after undergoing an MRI scan on Sunday."
84,04/11/2015,23:02,Pjanic penalty saves Roma in Bayer win,A late penalty from Miralem Pjanic revived Roma's chances of qualifying for the last 16 of the Champions League in a dramatic 3-2 win over Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday.,"With Roma in desperate need of a first win in the group to maintain their last 16 qualification hopes, Mohamed Salah's second-minute strike settled any early nerves at the Stadio Olimpico. The hosts doubled their lead before the half hour when goal-shy Edin Dzeko hit only his second goal for the Giallorossi and his first Champions League goal since November 2013 to give the hosts what looked like a commanding lead. But, two weeks after the sides' dramatic 4-4 draw at the BayArena, Roma were stunned in five second-half minutes when Admir Mehmedi and Javier Hernandez capitalised on spectacular defensive lapses to pull Roger Schmidt's visitors level six minutes after the restart. Roma were shaky for the remainder of the second half but were handed a lifeline when Omer Toprak saw red late on for pushing Salah into the net as the Egyptian was about to pull the trigger at the far post. Russian referee Sergei Karasev pointed to the spot and Miralem Pjanic stepped up to beat Bernd Leno for a 3-2 lead on 81 minutes. Roma now move up to second place in Group E but Garcia will be looking for improvements after a second-half display that was completely at odds with Roma's impressive first half performance. Salah put the hosts ahead after just two minutes after a great one-two with Dzeko, who held the ball up well in the centre circle to set the Egyptian free down the right and bundle the ball past Leno. Astonishingly, Roma's last victory in the competition was their 5-1 win over CSKA Moscow in September 2014 but Garcia's men were quickly in command. Leverkusen were showing little threat and, worse, had their heads elsewhere when Roma doubled their lead before the half hour in textbook fashion. A long Levekusen cross found no takers, and when 'keeper Wojciech Szczesny found Pjanic in space the ball was eventually worked to Nainggolan, whose weighted through ball found Dzeko in space behind the defence. The Bosnian took several strides before firing past Leno and scoring his first Roma goal more than two months after his maiden strike in a 2-1 win over Juventus. Dzeko should have grabbed his second moments later after another great run by Salah, only to first-time the Egyptian's pinpoint delivery over the bar, and twice Salah then failed to find his forward partners despite promising runs that left him in space down the right. If Roma thought they had the match wrapped up, they were soon brought back to earth in a stunning start to the second half. The hosts stingy defence suddenly became charitable and after less than a minute Kevin Kampl cut back for Mehmedi from inside the area to fire past Szczesny into the top of the net. Roma were all at sea and five minutes later paid the cost when Hernandez was played through by Karim Bellarabi to power a shot past Szczesny to hit his fourth goal of this season's competition. Garcia, who saw claims for a penalty waved away despite Dzeko falling under a challenge from Jonathan Tah at a free kick, replaced Gervinho with Juan Iturbe on the hour. But Roma only found salvation on 80 minutes when the referee pointed to the spot after sending off Toprak for his push on Salah."
85,03/11/2015,20:32,Leverkusen will play to beat Roma - Schmidt,Bayer Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt insists the Germans will not be settling for a draw when they meet Roma in a Champions League clash the hosts must win to have any realistic chance of qualifying for the last 16.,"Two weeks after scoring two late goals to earn a 4-4 draw at the BayArena and deprive Roma of their first win in Group E, Leverkusen have Roma's backs to the wall. A Leverkusen win at the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday would force Rudi Garcia's men to win their last two group games, one of which is away to defending champions Barcelona, to have any chance of sneaking into the knockout phase. It would also give Schmidt's men a huge qualifying boost, but even a draw would likely keep their destiny in their own hands, but Schmidt's not interested in that. ""We've lost away to Lazio and Barcelona already this season, and we certainly need to pay more attention, but that doesn't mean we've come to Rome to defend,"" Schmidt said. Ahead of Wednesday's fixture, Roma's steady goals haul -- as well as Edin Dzeko's lean spell -- is under scrutiny. Roma's 1-0 defeat to Inter Milan last weekend was the first time they had failed to score in 25 fixtures in all competitions, but Dzeko has netted only once in 11 outings for the Giallorossi. Leverkusen are still smarting from a 2-1 defeat at Wolfsburg on Saturday when Nicklas Bendtner hit a clearly offside opening goal for the hosts. On the plus side, ex-Manchester United and Real Madrid striker Javier Hernandez has hit great form of late, scoring six goals in his last four games, including a brace in the 4-4 draw a fortnight ago. Schmidt added: ""Javier Hernandez is playing better and better. He has scored a lot of goals lately."" Leverkusen's sporting director Rudi Voller, who scored 45 goals in 142 Serie A appearances for Roma in 1987-1992, said he ""can't wait"" to return to the 'Eternal City'. ""If we don't lose at the Olimpico it will give us a boost in terms of qualifying for the last 16, but it will be a difficult game,"" he said in an interview with www.gazzetta.it. Leverkusen are missing ex-Germany defender Roberto Hilbert (knee injury) and still have doubts over Lars Bender (ankle) while Roma are without Malian midfielder Seydou Keita."
86,20/10/2015,23:06,Leverkusen salvage point in thrilling Roma draw,Bayer Leverkusen snatched a dramatic late point in a 4-4 draw against Roma in a thrilling Champions League group stage encounter on Wednesday.,"Javier Hernandez's brace had put Leverkusen ahead after just 20 minutes, but Roma drew level before half time as Daniele De Rossi struck twice, before the Italians scored twice more through Miralem Pjanic and Iago Falque to seemingly secure victory in the second half. However, two Leverkusen goals in the last 10 minutes from Kevin Kampl and Admir Mehmedi capped off an exhilarating game and secured the Germans a dramatic share of the spoils. The result was another disappointment for Roma. After defeat to BATE Borisov earlier this month, they now sit bottom of Group E. The group remains wide open, however, with just one point separating Leverkusen, Borisov and Roma underneath leaders Barcelona. Leverkusen took the lead from the penalty spot with only four minutes played. A Hakan Calhanoglu cross struck Vassilis Torisidis' trailing hand, and Hernandez converted the resulting penalty. The Mexico international doubled the lead in the 19th minute. Free in the box after a defensive mistake from Lucas Digne, Hernandez's first shot was saved by Wojciech Szczesny, but he coolly slotted home the rebound. But Roma were gifted a goal in the 30th minute. After Bernd Leno failed to properly clear a corner, Daniele De Rossi was left unmarked six yards from goal and the Roma captain toe-poked the ball in to make it 2-1. The goal sparked Roma into life, and they were rewarded for sustained pressure in the 38th minute. De Rossi was left unmarked again at a free kick from Pjanic, and he equalised from close range. With Roma dominating the early stages of the second half, Gervinho broke through the Leverkusen defence in the 53rd minute, only to be denied by a smart save from Leno. The Italians completed the turnaround just one minute later. Pjanic showed his set piece quality once more, placing a free kick into the bottom corner from 20 yards out. Leverkusen struggled to find a route back into the game despite a short resurgence immediately after the goal. With 17 minutes to play, Roma hit on the counter attack, Gervinho linking up with the substitute Falque, who made it 4-2. The game looked over until the 84th minute, when Kampl suddenly curled in a beautiful strike from outside the penalty area. Just two minutes later, the ball passed from Kampl, via Wendell to Mehmedi, who put it in the net from close range. Hernandez could have won the game in stoppage time as Leverkusen struck on the counter attack, but his shot flew inches wide of the post."
87,19/10/2015,02:25,Roma face 'knockout' trip to Leverkusen,Roma stalwart Daniele De Rossi said Tuesday's Champions League group stage trip to Bayer Leverkusen is like a knockout game for the Italians.,"Roma are bottom of Group E with a single point from two matches ahead of the back-to-back clashes with the Germans. ""There's no question, it won't be easy against Leverkusen because we're playing away from home and they are a quality side,"" said De Rossi. ""Qualification for the next round of the Champions League is at stake in this match so it will be a kind of mini knockout game."" Leverkusen were unlucky to lose 2-1 at the Camp Nou last time out, having led defending champions Barcelona at home after hammering BATE Borisov 4-1 at the BayArena in their opening European match. The Germans are just one point behind leaders Barcelona in the table and eager to claim a win over Roma ahead of the return in the eternal city on November 4. But Roger Schmidt's Bayer have struggled of late in the Bundesliga and were held to a goalless draw at home to Hamburg on Saturday, their second straight draw to leave them eighth in the table. ""We created some good opportunities which we didn't use to turn the game in our favour. The result is okay, we have to live with it,"" said head coach Schmidt after the Hamburg draw. Germany defender Roberto Hilbert is definitely out with a knee injury, while midfielders Kevin Kampl (illness) and Lars Bender (ankle) face a race to be fit in time. Leverkusen's home record against Serie A teams is four wins, a draw and three defeats. Roma warmed up for the trip to Germany with a 3-1 defeat of Empoli on Saturday as Italy veteran Daniele de Rossi marked his 500th appearance for the Rome club with his first goal of the season. But they are still seeking a first win after drawing 1-1 at home with Barcelona and losing 3-2 at BATE in Belarus. Coach Rudi Garcia has welcomed Brazilian defender Leandro Castan back for his first home start since May 2014 after a lengthy injury absence. Garcia hinted that Edin Dzeko, Maicon and Germany international Antonio Ruediger could all be ready for Tuesday's game. ""It's great to have a player like him (Maicon) available again,"" said Garcia. ""We'll have Dzeko and Ruediger back with us soon as well. Edin is close to a full recovery and that's a good thing for the team with Tuesday in mind. ""It's our third league win in a row, now we can focus on the Champions League and we're going to Leverkusen looking for a win."" Garcia's men lead the league for goals scored so far (20), but they have also conceded 10 in eight games. Garcia said: ""It's good that we're scoring lots but we always concede at least one. I hope we can change that, starting on Tuesday."" Elsewhere, Azzurri legend Francesco Totti is still out injured and doubtful to even make the squad on Tuesday."
88,29/09/2015,22:47,Suarez inspires Messi-less Barca fightback,Luis Suarez rounded off a stirring fightback by European champions Barcelona as they shrugged off the absence of the injured Lionel Messi to beat Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 on Wednesday.,"Kyriakos Papadopoulos had headed the visitors into a deserved half-time lead as Barca struggled to open up the Germans without Messi's magic touch. However, despite also losing Andres Iniesta to injury, Suarez turned the game around in the final 10 minutes as Sergi Roberto tapped home the rebound after the Uruguayan's initial effort had been saved. And the former Liverpool striker thumped home a stunning effort to hand Barca a hard-fought three points two minutes later. Victory takes Barca top of Group E, a point ahead of Leverkusen and BATE Borisov, who were 3-2 winners over Roma on Wednesday. Leverkusen made the most of Barca's edgy start as former Real Madrid striker Javier Hernandez forced Marc-Andre ter Stegen into a smart save at his near post inside two minutes. Ivan Rakitic had Barca's first effort on target, but the Croatian placed his header too close to Bernd Leno. Sandro Ramirez was the man given the unenviable task of replacing Messi and nearly repaid coach Luis Enrique's faith as he played a lovely one-two with Suarez before Leno pulled off a spectacular save to turn the 20-year-old's effort behind. However, Leverkusen's speed on the break was a constant threat and Kevin Kampl should have done better on two occasions as he curled the ball wide and was then denied by a brave block from Gerard Pique with an even clearer sight of goal. Leverkusen finally took a deserved lead on 22 minutes when Hakan Calhanoglu's brilliant in-swinging corner caught Ter Stegen off guard and Papadopoulos nodded home. The German international made amends moments later as he stood up to prevent Karim Bellarabi from doubling the visitors' lead. Much had been expected of Neymar in Messi's absence, but the Brazilian had been kept very quiet until his deflected effort hit the post six minutes before the break and Sandro's follow-up effort somehow deflected off Papadopoulos and behind for a corner. Hernandez had a golden chance to put the game beyond the hosts at the start of the second-half but blazed over when unmarked just 12 yards out. At the other end, the chances began to arrive for Barca as Sandro again fired wide before Neymar pushed an effort off target. However, the bad news continued for Luis Enrique when Iniesta pulled up with a muscle injury just after the hour mark to add to the Catalans' mounting injury crisis. Yet, Barca reacted like champions to turn the game around as Roberto pounced after Leno had saved Suarez's initial effort to level 10 minutes from time. And moments later substitute Munir El Haddadi squared for Suarez to smash the ball high past the helpless Leno for a memorable winner."
89,27/09/2015,17:49,Darida rescues point for Hertha in Frankfurt,Midfielder Vladimir Darida rescued a point for Hertha Berlin with the late equaliser in their 1-1 Bundesliga draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday.,"Frankfurt captain Alexander Meier, the Bundesliga's top scorer last season, gave the hosts the lead midway through the first half. Hertha should have equalised before the break as striker Vedad Ibisevic headed onto the post, then fired over the bar. But they finally drew level on 82 minutes when substitute Alexander Baumjohann chested the ball through to Darida and the ex-Freiburg attacking midfielder slammed his shot past Frankfurt goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky. The point leaves Hertha sixth and Frankfurt 10th in the table. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund hosting Darmstadt on Sunday evening, defending champions Bayern Munich took the chance to go five points clear on Saturday with a 3-0 win at Mainz as Robert Lewandowski's goal haul continued. The Poland hot-shot took his tally to 101 Bundesliga goals and has now scored 10 goals in just six league games this season. Having sent German league records tumbling last Tuesday with five goals in just nine minutes after coming the bench in the 5-1 rout of Wolfsburg, the 27-year-old claimed two more against Mainz before Bayern host Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League on Tuesday. Lewandowski marked his 100th Bundesliga goal by heading Kingsley Coman's cross inside the far post on 51 minutes and pulled up his shirt to reveal a T-Shirt which stated: ""100"". ""The T-Shirt was my idea, I didn't know if I'd score today, but you always have to think positively, which is why I had it made,"" he told reporters. An Arturo Vidal pass then put Lewandowski in behind the defence to round the goalkeeper for his 101st on 63 minutes. France Under-21 winger Coman grabbed Bayern's third five minutes later with a simple tap in from a Douglas Costa cross. Schalke remain third after Germany Under-21 attacking midfielder Leroy Sane scored for his third game in succession to seal Saturday's 1-0 win at Hamburg with a superb strike on the hour. Bayer Leverkusen, who play European champions Barcelona away on Tuesday, romped to a 3-0 win at Werder Bremen with goals by Swiss forward Admir Mehmedi, winger Kevin Kampl and Germany Under-21 talent Julian Brandt. Wolfsburg, who play Manchester United at Old Trafford on Wednesday in the Champions League, dropped more points in a 1-1 draw at home to bottom side Hanover to stay fourth. Bas Dost's header was cancelled out by Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake's superb volley on 57 minutes to leave Wolves fourth in the table. Borussia Moenchengladbach, who host Manchester City on Wednesday, picked up their second win since Lucien Favre's shock resignation last Sunday with a 3-1 victory at VfB Stuttgart. The goals came from Granit Xhaka, a Christian Gentner own-goal and Raffel's late effort afer Daniel Ginczek slotted a 40th-minute penalty for Stuttgart. Hoffenheim climbed to 15th with a 3-1 win at Augsburg as Germany international Kevin Volland scored twice, including a second-half penalty."
90,26/09/2015,20:49,Barca trip tough for Bayer -- even without Messi,Bayer Leverkusen captain Lars Bender says holders Barcelona still present his side with a huge challenge away in Tuesday's Champions League group match -- even without injured star Lionel Messi.,"The Barcelona playmaker is expected to miss up to eight weeks with a knee injury, but Leverkusen face a daunting task despite beating Werder Bremen 3-0 away on Saturday to climb to fifth in the German league. Messi's injury has little impact to Leverkusen's status as underdogs at the Camp Nou. ""Barcelona have enough top players in the squad and the game remains a huge challenge,"" said Bender. The Germany midfielder says his side must show some courage in Barcelona having been mauled 7-1 on their previous visit in 2012, when Messi bagged five goals. ""We're found our way back on track, but now we have to attempt to be more courageous,"" said Bender, who has shaken off a knee injury. Goals by Swiss forward Admir Mehmedi, winger Kevin Kampl and Germany Under-21 talent Julian Brandt sealed Leverkusen's win in Bremen. ""Every footballer dreams of playing in matches like this, we all know how strong the opponent will be, but we want to bring our own game to their pitch,"" said Kampl, who scored his first league goal since his transfer from Borussia Dortmund."" Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt was delighted with Bender's performance alongside fellow Germany international Christoph Kramer in the defensive midfield. ""I was especially pleased that we gave the opposition hardly any chances and it is important for us that Lars Bender is fit,"" said Schmidt. At least Messi's injury guarantees there will be no repeat of the embarrassing shirt-swapping affair of 2012. When Barcelona beat Leverkusen 3-1 in their last 16, first-leg win three years ago, Bayer defender Michal Kadlec asked Messi for his shirt at half-time, but a row broke out when teammate Manuel Friedrich, who was marking Messi, claimed it for himself in the break. Kadlec, who scored the Germans' only goal, eventually got another shirt off Messi at full time, but Leverkusen sporting director Rudi Voller made the pair auction the shirts for charity after getting wind of what had happened."
91,20/09/2015,19:42,Dortmund regain top spot by beating Leverkusen,Borussia Dortmund regained top spot in the Bundesliga from Bayern Munich with a 3-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen to preserve their 100 percent record after five straight wins.,"Dortmund have now won 11 games in all competitions, but are top only on goal difference from defending champions Bayern Munich, who have also won all five games this season after beating Darmstadt 3-0 away on Saturday. Early form suggests there will be a title-race in Germany this season after Bayern won the Bundesliga for each of the last three years at a canter. Dortmund took the lead when right winger Jonas Hofmann profited from a mistake by Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno to slot into an empty net on 19 minutes. Leverkusen should have been awarded a penalty when Mexico striker Javier Hernandez was pushed in the area by Dortmund left-back Marcel Schmelzer on 53 minutes but referee Deniz Aytekin waved on play. The hosts doubled their lead when left-winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan's pass put Shinji Kagawa in behind the defence to slot past Leno on 58 minutes. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted Dortmund's third and his six of the season to match Bayern's Thomas Mueller's tally as the league's joint top scorer. Augsburg picked up their first win of the season with a 2-0 victory at Hanover 96 thanks to goals by right-winger Alexander Esswein and Dutch defender Paul Verhaegh. Earlier, Schalke's Leroy Sane underlined his status as one of Germany's rising junior stars with his club's second-half winner to seal their 1-0 victory at VfB Stuttgart to leave the Royal Blues fourth. On Saturday, Bayern, who are bidding to become the first team to win the German league four times in succession, went top of the table for 24 hours with a 3-0 win at Darmstadt for their fifth straight league win. Arturo Vidal, Kingsley Coman and Sebastian Rode claimed their first goals of the season with Munich's star forward Robert Lewandowski injured and Thomas Mueller on the bench. Gladbach's disastrous start to the season continued as they lost 1-0 at neighbours Cologne, thanks to Anthony Modeste's second-half winner, in the Rhineland derby to stay bottom of the table with five defeats from five. The victory left Cologne fifth while Gladbach, who lost their opening Champions League group stage match 3-0 at Seville on Tuesday, remain rooted to the foot of the table and Lucien Favre resigned on Sunday night. Wolfsburg, who face Bayern away on Tuesday, celebrated their 70th birthday with a 2-0 home win over Hertha Berlin as Dutch striker Bas Dost netted twice to lift his side up to third. After coming off the bench on 71 minutes, Dost netted the opener five minutes later, then drilled home a penalty on 89 minutes after a foul on Germany international Julian Draxler. But Dost was later slammed by his coach Dieter Hecking for behaving 'like someone had taken his toys away' in training having been subbed off in Wolfsburg's Champions League win at home to CSKA Moscow last Tuesday. Ingolstadt made history as the first Bundesliga team to win all three of their home games in their debut season in Germany's top flight after Moritz Hartmann drilled home a 93rd-minute penalty which put the Bavarians fifth with a 1-0 win at Werder Bremen. Bremen were reduced to ten men five minutes into injury time when midfielder Philipp Bargfrede was sent off for fouling Ingolstsadt's USA international Alfredo Morales. Hamburg were held to a goalless draw at home to Eintracht Frankfurt while Mainz are seventh after Friday's 3-0 win at home to Hoffenheim when midfielder Yunus Malli claimed a hat-trick."
92,18/09/2015,02:30,"True test for Dortmund, Bayern venture to Darmstadt","Borussia Dortmund face the first real test of their mettle as Bundesliga leaders on Sunday when they host Bayer Leverkusen, while Bayern Munich face a tricky tie at Darmstadt.","After the disappointment of last season's seventh-place finish Dortmund are back at the top of the table, ahead of rivals Bayern on goal difference, following four straight wins under new coach Thomas Tuchel. Dortmund left it late to beat FC Krasnodar in their opening game of the Europa League group stage on Thursday and full-back Marcel Schmelzer is eager for their winning run to continue this weekend. ""We have unfinished business, not just against Leverkusen but in general (after last season),"" Schmelzer, whose side were beaten 2-0 at home by Leverkusen last term, told the Bundesliga's official website. ""We're on the right track at the moment, though: we're focussed, working hard and desperately want to succeed. ""We know it's difficult to maintain the high level we're playing at, however, and so we want to make sure we keep a comfortable cushion over our rivals and remain in the Champions League places for as long as possible."" Pep Guardiola's star-studded Bayern squad will receive a warm welcome at Darmstadt's antiquated Merck Stadion on Saturday with the hosts looking for another upset win having stunned Bayer Leverkusen 1-0 last week at the BayArena. Fresh from Wednesday's impressive 3-0 Champions League win at Olympiakos, Bayern turn their attention to beating Darmstadt to claim top spot in the table before Dortmund play 24 hours later. Darmstadt are back in the Bundesliga after a 33-year absence and have never beaten Bayern in four previous meetings, the last of which was back in 1982. Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze is set for another afternoon on Bayern's bench having been left out of the starting line-up in Greece, only to score as a substitute. Bayern have the express intention of becoming the first team to win four-straight Bundesliga titles and despite winning all four games so far, they find themselves trailing Dortmund. ""It's great for the Bundesliga, but it's a bit unsettling to have such an aggressive pursuer. In fact, at the moment we're the ones doing the chasing,"" said Bayern striker Thomas Mueller, the league's top scorer with six goals in four games. Guardiola has got off to the best start in any of his three years in Germany, but knows there is no guarantee of success in what is set to be a particularly competitive season. ""No team has ever won the Bundesliga four times in a row,"" he explained after Bayern's comeback win over Augsburg last Saturday. ""That's because achieving that is really difficult. Bayer Leverkusen lost at home to Darmstadt and VfL Wolfsburg could only get a draw in Ingolstadt."" The Darmstadt fixture sees the start of Bayern's run of five matches in 13 days. The tally includes three key home matches against last season's league runners-up VfL Wolfsburg, a Champions League clash with Dinamo Zagreb, then Dortmund on October 4, which is warming up to be a battle royal. ""I can't imagine it's been much fun for Dortmund to have been behind us in the last three seasons so of course, they're going to want to attack again,"" said Mueller. Bottom side Borussia Moenchengladbach are at Cologne on Saturday looking for their first win of the season after a disastrous four straight league defeats having been beaten 3-0 at Sevilla on Tuesday in their opening Champions League match.

93,16/09/2015,22:58,Hernandez strikes as Leverkusen rout BATE,Javier Hernandez scored on his first start for Bayer Leverkusen in their 4-1 rout of BATE Borisov on Wednesday as the Germans topped Group E ahead of Barcelona.,"Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu netted twice in the rout as Bayer put the Belarus side to the sword in their opening Champions League tie. Swiss striker Admir Mehmedi gave Bayer an early lead, but Serbia midfielder Nemanja Milunovic headed BATE level on 13 minutes. Calhanoglu then put the hosts 2-1 up after the break before Mexico's Hernandez scored Leverkusen's third. Calhanoglu netted a late penalty as the hosts dominated, using their 65 percent possession to fire in 20 shots on goal to BATE's paltry two efforts. Hernandez's goal was no more than the 27-year-old ex-Manchester United and Real Madrid forward deserved as 'Chicharito' justified replacing Stefan Kiessling in Leverkusen's starting line-up with an impressive display. Having made his debut off the bench in Leverkusen's shock 1-0 Bundesliga defeat to Darmstadt last Saturday, Hernandez received a standing ovation from the BayArena crowd when he made way for Germany striker Kiessling on 72 minutes. After Barcelona's 1-1 draw at Roma, Leverkusen's victory is a confidence booster ahead of their clash with the defending champions at the Camp Nou in a fortnight. However, the win came at a cost as Leverkusen captain Lars Bender limped off in clear discomfort on 44 minutes with a knee injury to be replaced by fellow Germany international Christoph Kramer. Leverkusen took an early lead when Switzerland international Mehmedi curled in Hernandez's cross off the outside of his boot with just four minutes gone. BATE drew level when Milunovic headed home off a Leverkusen defender which wrong-footed home goalkeeper Bernd Leno. Calhanoglu restored Leverkusen's lead just after the break when he drove home Karim Bellarabi's cross on 47 minutes before Hernandez scored his first goal in the Bayer shirt when he slotted home Kevin Kampl's final pass on 59 minutes. It turned into a rout on 76 minutes when left-back Filip Mladenovic handled and Calhanoglu hit an unstoppable penalty into the left-hand corner."
94,15/09/2015,16:37,Hernandez poised for CL bow with Bayer,"Javier Hernandez is poised to make his Champions League debut for new side Bayer Leverkusen in Wednesday's clash at home to Belarus' BATE Borisov, according to his coach Roger Schmidt.","The 27-year-old Mexico striker signed a three-year contract when he joined from Manchester United last month and made his Bundesliga debut off the bench in the second-half of Leverkusen's shock defeat to Darmstadt last Saturday. 'Chicharito' has a wealth of experience on the European stage for both United and Real Madrid, for who he scored the winner in last season's Champions League quarter-final against Atletico Madrid while on loan from Old Trafford. He is set to make his European bow for Leverkusen and the Mexican has already impressed his team-mates. ""He's a great bloke, who's very open and speaks better English then most of the squad and has integrated well,"" confirmed Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno. Schmidt is set to include right-back Roberto Hilbert who was doubtful, but has recovered from a knee knock, and a decision will be made after the final training session. Bayer have reached the last 16 stage of the competition for the last two seasons and with holders Barcelona also in Group E, they know that starting with three points at the BayArena is crucial against the pool's minnows. ""We're the favourites on paper, but we won't underestimate Borisov,"" insisted Schmidt. Leverkusen have struggled for form in the Bundesliga with two wins and two defeats to leave them 13th in the table while BATE are top of their domestic league and are eight points clear at the top of the table after 19 matches. BATE have one player well-known outside his homeland in ex-Arsenal and Barcelona forward Alekander Hleb, 34, who is winding down his career back in his native country. His side have reason for confidence as their best moment in Europe came against a German side as they shocked Bayern Munich 3-1 at home back in October 2012, although the Bavarian giants went on to win the Champions League later that season. Amidst the ongoing Europe-wide crisis, Bayer have invited 500 refugees to the Champions League match from Leverkusen, Bonn, Leichlingen and Bergisch-Gladbach."

Bayer have reached the last 16 stage of the competition for the last two seasons and qualified for their third straight campaign by winning a play-off. Despite beating Lazio over two legs to book their group stage place, Leverkusen have struggled for form at in the Bundesliga with two wins and two defeats, including Saturday's shock 1-0 loss at home to newly-promoted Darmstadt. The defeat left them 13th in the table while BATE are top of their domestic league. Finalists in 2002, Bayer's key new arrival is Mexican striker Javier Hernandez, snapped up from Manchester United -- the side they ousted in the 2002 semi-finals -- after the sale of South Korea striker Son Heung-Min to Tottenham Hotspur. The Mexico forward made his debut in the second-half of the Darmstadt defeat, but left the field disgruntled. ""I was delighted to make my debut, but not with the result,"" Hernandez admitted. Leverkusen are set to be without Germany defender Roberto Hilbert after the right-back injured his knee in the Darmstadt defeat. BATE may be European minnows but their form is been strong in 2015, having lost just three times in 33 matches, while goalkeeper Sergei Chernik has kept 14 clean sheets in 18 league appearances. They are eight points clear at the top of the table after 19 matches. BATE came through three qualifying rounds to reach the Champions League group stages, beating Ireland's Dundalk FC, Hungary's Videoton and Serbia's Partizan Belgrade. Aleksandr Yermakovich's side won all three home games in those ties, but are still seeking an away victory. BATE have one player well-known outside his homeland in ex-Arsenal and Barcelona forward Alekander Hleb, 34, who is winding down his career back in his native country. He was taken off during Saturday's 1-1 draw against Shakhtyor Soligorsk to preserve him for Bayer. ""We need to spare him for the important game in Leverkusen,"" explained Yermakovich. BATE may be feeling confident as their best moment in Europe came against a German side as they shocked Bayern Munich 3-1 at home back in October 2012, although the Bavarian giants went on to win the Champions League later that season."

The 27-year-old was on the bench for United's 2-1 defeat at Swansea City on Sunday, but he hadn't started for the Premier League team for more than a year. He returned to United in the close-season after scoring nine goals during his spell with Real, including the winner in their Champions League quarter-final against rivals Atletico Madrid, but manager Louis van Gaal has allowed him to leave permanently this time. ""I know two of the biggest leagues in Europe in the English Premier League and the Primera Division in Spain and now I want to experience the Bundesliga,"" Hernandez told Leverkusen's website. ""I've heard a lot about the fantastic stadia in Germany and about the unique fans they have there. ""The Bundesliga is an extremely attack-minded league and it's particularly enticing for me. ""It's fantastic that I can now play for a club like Leverkusen, who are obviously known to me from the Champions League. ""Bayer Leverkusen is a big opportunity for me and I can and want to achieve a lot here."" Leverkusen were drawn alongside Barcelona, Roma and BATE Borisov in Group E of the Champions League last week and Hernandez is being relied on to help the his new side make an impact in Europe's elite club competition.

Mueller and Dutch winger Arjen Robben both converted second-half penalties for Bayern as fellow Champions League side Leverkusen were well beaten. Defending champions Bayern took the lead when Mueller met Douglas Costa's cross in the middle on 26 minutes, then converted a penalty after Arturo Vidal was pushed in the back by Leverkusen defender Roberto Hilbert on 59 minutes. Robben then claimed his 11th penalty from 12 attempts in his Bundesliga career by drilling home a 71st-minute spot-kick as Hilbert was penalised after a Costa cross hit his armpit. The 30-year-old ex-Germany defender was at fault for all three Bayern goals having also let Costa get away for the cross which led to Mueller's first-half goal. Leverkusen had a goal disallowed when Australia winger Robbie Kruse looked to have scored on 72 minutes, but the referee spotted him bringing the ball down with his upper arm. Earlier, Cologne's impressive start to the season continued when they went third with a 2-1 comeback win at home to Hamburg after gleaning seven points from their opening three games. After ex-Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Lewis Holtby put Hamburg ahead early in the second half, Cologne levelled through Philipp Hosiner on 76 minutes, but the game turned on a dubious red card and penalty. Hamburg's ex-Bosnia captain Emir Spahic was sent off for the slightest of touches on Cologne striker Anthony Modeste on 79 minutes. The Frenchman gratefully drilled home the resulting penalty to the fury of the visitors' bench. Japan striker Yoshinori Muto warmed-up for his country's World Cup qualifier against Cambodia in Saitama on Thursday with his first two Bundesliga goals in Mainz's 3-0 win over Hanover. The 23-year-old opened his account on just his third Bundesliga appearance on 15 minutes, then doubled his tally on 29 minutes when he headed home from a corner. Centre-forward Yunus Malli claimed Mainz's third by finishing off a sweeping counter-attack just after the break as Mainz moved up to fifth. Socceroos forward Mathew Leckie also scored his first goal in Germany's top flight in Ingolstadt's 1-0 win at Bavarian rivals Augsburg. The 24-year-old left winger, who has won 25 caps for Australia, curled a superb shot inside the left-hand post, which gave Augsburg goalkeeper Marwin Hitz no chance on 63 minutes. Ten-man Stuttgart are bottom after a 4-1 defeat at home to Eintracht Frankfurt as Poland goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton was sent off for the hosts. Stuttgart fell behind when Czech defender Adam Hlousek scored an own-goal after 11 minutes before Daniel Didavi levelled with half an hour gone. Dutch striker Luc Castaignos put Frankfurt 2-1 up at the break before Tyton's dismissal for bringing down the former on 67 minutes. Haris Seferovic converted the penalty and Castaignos claimed his second with his team's fourth on 87 minutes. Darmstadt are 11th after their third straight draw following a goalless effort at home to Hoffenheim. Borussia Dortmund can reclaim top spot on goal difference by beating Hertha Berlin at home on Sunday before Werder Bremen host Borussia Moenchengladbach."

Son scored 29 goals in 87 appearances for Leverkusen after joining from domestic rivals Hamburg in 2013 for 10 million euros. Leverkusen have already signed his replacement in Slovenia international Kevin Kampl from Borussia Dortmund. Born in Chuncheon, the capital of Gangwon Province, Son - nicknamed 'Sonny' -- joined Hamburg's youth set-up at the age of 16 and first played for South Korea in 2010. His move will give Tottenham an extra forward option, with rising star Harry Kane yet to score this season. Should Son's transfer be confirmed, it may mean that Spurs' pursuit of Saido Berahino is at an end, with the club having already had two offers for the West Bromwich Albion striker rejected by their Premier League rivals. Son has 11 goals in 44 international appearances and played at the 2014 World Cup. ""I'm looking forward to going there and performing for the Spurs fans as soon as possible,"" Son told Tottenham's Twitter feed. ""The support I get from the fans motivates me more and more. ""I'm a player who really loves football. I learned the game under my father who was a football coach in my school. ""I've trained with both feet so I can use them freely. Bold and daring -- this is how I like to try to play."" Son leaves Leverkusen on the back of a public spat, though, after missing Wednesday's Champions League play-off victory over Lazio in order to complete his Spurs move. Both Bayer Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt and Son's team-mate Haken Calhanoglu had criticised Son for the timing, saying the Korean had been ""ill-advised"". But the striker took exception to Calhanoglu's comments after the Turkish midfielder forced through his transfer from Hamburg to Leverkusen last year. ""People who lives in glasshouses shouldn't go throwing stones,"" Son told German Kicker magazine. ""Everyone should mind his own business and there is certainly enough to take care of."""

Bayer have given their permission for the transfer to go ahead, according to German media reports. Son was left out of Leverkusen's 3-0 win over Lazio on Wednesday in a Champions League play-off, which saw the Germans qualify for the group stages with a 3-1 win on aggregate. And he could be a Spurs player come Saturday evening's kick-off at Bayern's Allianz Arena. Leverkusen, currently third in the table with Munich second, enjoyed a 2-0 win at home over Bayern in May, the last time the two teams met. Bayern's ex-Leverkusen midfielder Arturo Vidal expects no quarter asked, nor given. Vidal made 117 league appearances, scoring 15 goals, for Leverkusen from 2007-11 before joining Juventus, then Bayern in July for 37 million euros. ""I'll always carry Leverkusen in my heart, it's a special game for me and the first time I'll play against a former club,"" he said. ""I am very grateful to Leverkusen, but now I play for Bayern and I want to get everything I can out of this game."" Along with Borussia Dortmund, who host Hertha Berlin on Saturday and top the table on goal difference, Bayern and Leverkusen are the only teams in Germany's top flight with a 100 percent record after two games. ""Leverkusen play very aggressively,"" said Vidal. ""They use their pressing game from the first minute and we'll have to be careful."" Wolfsburg, who host Schalke on Friday, are set to lose Germany's player-of-the-year Kevin de Bruyne with Manchester City reported to be set to offer 74 million euros for the Belgium international. The attacking midfielder, who was voted Germany's player of the season for the 2014/15 campaign, has told Wolfsburg he wants to leave and has been left out of the match squad against Schalke, according to reports. The speculation surrounding both Son and De Bruyne follows the latest trend of talent quitting the Bundesliga for England. Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger swapped the red shirt of Bayern Munich for Manchester United in July. Brazil striker Roberto Firmino has joined Liverpool from Hoffenheim, ex-Mainz striker Shinji Okazaki is now at Leicester and Spanish forward Joselu swapped Hanover 96 for Stoke City. On Sunday, bottom side Borussia Moenchengladbach will be looking to reverse alarming recent results after losing both of their opening games to Dortmund and Mainz. ""We've got a few players who aren't yet 100 percent fit and we're still making too many individual mistakes, which we must correct,"" admitted Gladbach coach Lucien Favre. Cologne are looking to consolidate their opening haul of four points from their first two games when they host Hamburg on Saturday, but will be without Japan forward Yuya Osako, who has a knee injury."
100,27/08/2015,14:49,Son's Spurs switch would be ill-advised - Leverkusen,"With Son Heung-Min in talks to join Tottenham Hotspur, Bayer Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt says the South Korean striker would be wrong to turn his back on Champions League football.","The 23-year-old, under contract with Leverkusen until 2018, is reported to be set to sign a deal worth an estimated 30 million euros ($34 million, (Â£22 million), if he passes the medical, according to German media reports. Son was left out of Leverkusen's 3-0 win over Lazio on Wednesday in a Champions League play-off, which saw the Germans qualify for the group stages with a 3-1 win on aggregate, and Schmidt says the Asian star would be wrong to leave them. ""Son is a great lad and a great player, who isn't really being advised well at the moment,"" Schmidt told German Sky Sports ahead of Leverkusen's league match at Bayern Munich on Saturday. ""He has resolved to do something which isn't so nice for us. ""That wasn't ideal, things could have been done better, but the team has blended it out."" Leverkusen midfielder Haken Calhanoglu echoed Schmidt's sentiments that the timing of Sons' Spurs talks was poor. ""We were then informed what's going on,"" said Calhanoglu. ""It's a bit disappointing. I tried to reach him but I could not get hold of him. ""The whole team is disappointed, but it's not his fault -- he's a good lad. I believe that he's been badly advised."" Son is the latest German league star poised to join the Premier League with Manchester City negotiating with Wolfsburg for Belgium midfielder Kevin de Bruyne. Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller said the latest trend in England is bad for the rest of European football. ""It's unfortunate the way things have gone, but we can not help it,"" said Voeller. ""Wolfsburg have also felt it in the last few weeks. ""The British television market has exploded and there an awful lot of money around. ""They're trying to buy players from across Europe and we're a club who will suffer beneath that, every now and then, so we have to defend ourselves. ""He was there (Son in London), but it's not yet certain."" Son arrived at Leverkusen in the summer of 2013 in a club record 10 million euros move from Bundesliga rivals Hamburg, scoring 21 goals in 62 league matches."
101,26/08/2015,23:09,Impressive Leverkusen waltz into group stages,Bayer Leverkusen are into the Champions League group stages for the fourth time in five years after beating Lazio 3-0 in the second leg of their play-off on Wednesday to go through 3-1 on aggregate.,"Roger Schmidt's men lost 1-0 in Rome against the Italian side in the first leg, but they recovered thanks to a terrific performance at the Bay Arena. After Stefan Kiessling had hit the bar with a header, the hosts levelled the aggregate scores thanks to Hakan Calhanoglu's goal five minutes before half-time and then Admir Mehmedi doubled their advantage immediately after the break. The impressive Karim Bellarabi put the result beyond doubt when he tapped home two minutes from time from Julian Brandt's pass to complete an impressive 3-0 win for the German outfit. As for Lazio, their hopes of reaching the main draw for the first time since the 2007/08 season are dashed with the Italians now entering the Europa League. Leverkusen went into the match having just beaten Hannover 1-0 at the weekend to record back-to-back Bundesliga wins and they started at an electric pace on Wednesday. After Dusan Basta volleyed over for Lazio, Calhanoglu forced a fine save from visiting goalkeeper Etrit Berisha from distance, but the Turkish international got the goal he deserved after 40 minutes. A horrible mix-up in the Lazio defence handed the ball straight to the excellent Kiessling whose attempted pass to Bellarabi was deflected off Stefan Radu into the path of Calhanoglu, and he kept his composure to finish past Albanian 'keeper Berisha and ignite the atmosphere inside the Bay Arena. It was no more than Leverkusen deserved after a high-tempo first-half display and they turned the tie on its head just three minutes after half-time. Bellarabi -- a menace throughout with his pace and trickery -- played an inch-perfect pass to Mehmedi and the Swiss international striker, who signed from Bundesliga rivals Freiburg in the summer, rifled an unstoppable shot past the hapless Berisha. Stefano Pioli's Lazio were looking shellshocked under the incessant wave of Leverkusen attacks and, after Bellarabi shot just wide, the visitors -- winners of both the Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Super Cup in 1999 -- were reduced to ten men on 68 minutes after Mauricio received a second caution following a trip on Kiessling. One Lazio goal would've been enough to send them through on the away goals rule but it was Leverkusen who kept attacking and the 2002 Champions League runners-up killed off the tie with a third after 88 minutes. 19-year-old German prodigy Brandt -- brought on for Mehmedi after 76 minutes -- sprinted clear before unselfishly squaring to Bellarabi who tucked home into an empty net to round off the scoring. Leverkusen have reached the last-16 stage of the competition in three of the past four seasons and, on this evidence, look a good bet to repeat those recent accomplishments."

Contacted by German news agency SID, a subsidiary of AFP, Leverkusen refused to comment on the news which broke hours before their Champions League play-off second leg against Lazio.

104,25/08/2015,15:26,Lazio injuries pile up ahead of Leverkusen,Lazio's bid to join Juventus and Roma in the group stages of the Champions League has been dented by a rash of injuries ahead of their qualifying decider against Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday.,"Lazio, third place finishers in Serie A last season, defeated Leverkusen 1-0 last week at the Stadio Olimpico in the first leg of their qualifying play-off. But injuries have piled up since Lazio's opening league game of the season, with German veteran Miroslav Klose, fellow striker Filip Djordjevic, midfielder Lucas Biglia and goalkeeper Federico Marchetti notably sidelined. Coach Stefano Pioli unveiled his squad list for the decider in Germany and he has only two strikers, youngsters Keita Balde and newly-signed Dutchman Ricardo Kishna, at his disposal. Keita scored the winner last week against Leverkusen while Kishna, 20, scored his maiden goal for Lazio in a 2-1 win over Bologna on Saturday, when Biglia also scored before hobbling off with a calf injury. The winner of the playoff will progress to the group stages of the Champions League, the draw for which will be held on Thursday."
105,25/08/2015,02:15,Man Utd and Lazio aim for Champions League group stage,Manchester United are looking to complete the job over Club Brugge in their Champions League play-off second leg on Wednesday while Italy's Lazio may have slightly more to do to secure a place in the group stages.,"The English Premier League giants have a two-goal lead to take to Belgium after a 3-1 win at Old Trafford last Tuesday, while Lazio have a slender 1-0 advantage for their second leg against Bayer Leverkusen in Germany. A 2-0 win for Brugge at the Jan Breydelstadion would be enough to take them through at United's expense (on the away goals rule), but United -- three-time winners of the Champions League -- are confident after Marouane Fellaini's late third goal in the first leg. ""It (Fellaini's goal) makes a difference because 2-1 is a very difficult result,"" said United boss Louis Van Gaal after the victory last Tuesday. Brugge boss Michel Preud'homme, on the other hand, was less optimistic after conceding the third goal in Manchester. ""This last goal was very bad for the confidence,"" said former Belgian international Preud'homme. ""It's a pity we let this one in,"" added the 56-year-old, who guided Brugge to the Belgian Cup last season. Manchester United -- winners in 1968, 1999 and 2008 -- didn't feature in the competition last season but had previously reached the group stages for 18 years in succession. Brugge, meanwhile, haven't made the group stages since the 2005/06 season when they finished third in Group A behind Juventus and Bayern Munich. Lazio go to Bayer Leverkusen hoping to defend a one-goal advantage and reach the main draw for the first time since the 2007/08 season. Keita Balde Diao's second-half winner at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome was the difference between the two sides last week, but Leverkusen are seasoned campaigners who have made the round of 16 in three of the last four seasons and were only edged out on penalties by 2014 runners-up Atletico Madrid at that stage last campaign. Runners-up in 2002, Leverkusen have won two out of two domestically, while Lazio also got off to a winning start in Serie A on Saturday with a 2-1 home win over Bologna. One player missing for the Bundesliga side is new Chilean signing Charles Aranguiz, who tore his Achilles tendon just one week after joining from Brazilian club Internacional. ""We've all been hit hard by the news and we're all suffering with him,"" said Leverkusen's sporting director Rudi Voeller. ""We will do everything we can so that Charles comes back as quickly as possible from this bad injury."" Elsewhere, Sporting Lisbon take a 2-1 lead to Russia against CSKA Moscow in the hope of securing a place in the main draw for the second successive season. The Portuguese giants struck late on through Islam Slimani at the Jose Alvalade in Lisbon, but will be wary of a CSKA side who have six wins out of six in Russia this season. The 2010 quarter-finalists were knocked out in the group stages last season but will fancy their chances of overturning the narrow deficit at the Arena Khimki. Belarus champions BATE Borisov are favourites to reach the group stages for the fourth time in five years as they take a 1-0 advantage to Serbia for their second leg against Partizan Belgrade, who haven't qualified for the main draw for five years. Astana are 90 minutes from making history as they look to become the first Kazakh team to qualify for the main competition. They take a 1-0 lead to the Cypriot capital Nicosia for their second leg against 2012 quarter-finalists APOEL, who are no strangers to the group stage having qualified again last season."
106,22/08/2015,20:15,Vargas set to be Germany's next Chilean import,Eduardo Vargas is set to become the next Chile star to play in the Bundesliga after Hoffenheim revealed on Saturday they are on the verge of signing the Napoli forward.,"The 25-year-old striker, who spent last season on loan at QPR in the English Premier League, has already completed a medical and is reported to cost six million euros ($6.8 million) having made 48 appearances and scored 22 goals for Chile. ""We assume that the formalities will be completed,"" said Hoffenheim's director of sport Alexander Rosen after his side's 2-1 league defeat at home to Bayern Munich. ""He can play in several positions and we'll have more options."" Vargas will be brought in to replace Brazil striker Roberto Firmino, who joined Liverpool in June. He will become the third member of the Chile side which won last month's Copa America to move to the Bundesliga along with Bayern Munich's Arturo Vidal and Bayer Leverkusen's Charles Aranguiz, who tore his Achilles tendon just a week after signing. Vargas' four goals made him the Copa America's joint top-scorer, alongside Peru's Paolo Guerrero."
107,22/08/2015,19:46,Guardiola hails Bayern's 'crazy' comeback win,Pep Guardiola rates ten-man Bayern Munich's 'crazy' 2-1 comeback win at Hoffenheim on Saturday as one of the best Bundesliga matches in his three seasons in Germany.,"A 90th-minute Robert Lewandowski goal sealed Bayern's unlikely win after the Bavarian giants had conceded the joint fastest goal in Bundesliga history when Hoffenheim's Kevin Volland scored after just nine seconds. Bayern had begun the fight back when a Douglas Costa shot rocketed off the hands of Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann and Thomas Mueller jabbed home the rebound with his knee to equalise on 40 minutes. The defending champions were reduced to ten men when defender Jerome Boateng was sent off for an obvious handball from the free-kick he had just conceded to earn his second booking and a red card on 72 minutes. Hoffenheim then wasted the chance for an historic first win over Bayern when Eugen Polanski blasted his penalty attempt off the post. Munich claimed the dramatic winner when Brazil winger Costa fired in a superb cross, Mario Goetze let the ball roll and Lewandowski drilled home his shot. ""The last ten minutes were somewhat crazy, we saw one of the best Bundesliga matches in the last three years,"" said a relieved Guardiola, who is in the final season of his three-year Bayern contract. ""I'm happy with the win and, above everything, with the performance. ""We knew it would be difficult here as Hoffenheim have always created a few problems for us in the last few years."" Boateng is now suspended for Bayern's key match at home to second-placed Bayer Leverkusen next Saturday. Having spared Bayern's blushes, Lewandowski said they showed their mettle after fighting back to deny Hoffenheim an historic first win over the Bavarian giants. ""As always, that was not an easy game against Hoffenheim,"" said Lewandowski. ""After the penalty and red-card, we knew that we had to keep playing, we created two or three big chances and we were the better team today."" Hoffenheim coach Markus Gisdol could barely mask his bitter disappointment, but was complimentary of Bayern, who are bidding to become the first team to win four-straight Bundesliga titles this season. ""You saw the brutal individual class which Bayern have. There are players, two or three, who play with a tempo you can't really hinder,"" said Gisdol. ""We were in the running for a win at the end and we'd have settled gladly for a draw."" Having equalled Karim Bellarabi's record for the joint fastest goal in Bundesliga history, set at the start of the 2014/15 season, Volland said his early strike was no consolation. ""The disappointment outweighs everything,"" he said. ""We suffered a 2-1 defeat in the 90th minute, despite playing well and having had the chance to finish the job. ""We didn't manage to do it and we were punished. It's a bitter disappointment."""

He will be out for months and is unlikely to play again this year. The Copa America-winner was on the bench for Leverkusen's 2-1 win at home to Hoffenheim last Saturday and had been due for his Bundesliga debut at Hanover on Saturday having only signed for the German side from Brazil's Internacional on August 12. ""We've all been hit hard by the news and we're all suffering with him,"" said Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller. ""We will do everything we can so that Charles comes back as quickly as possible from this bad injury."" Aranguiz, a defensive midfielder, is reported to have cost Leverkusen 12 million euros (US$13.3m) and had been brought in to boost the German club in the middle after the departure of Germany internationals Gonzalo Castro and Stefan Reinartz and also the retirement of Simon Rolfes."
109,15/08/2015,17:39,Bayer warm-up for Lazio by humbling Hoffenheim,Bayer Leverkusen warmed up for their Champions League play-off clash at Lazio with a 2-1 comeback win against Hoffenheim on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga season on Saturday.,"Leverkusen face Lazio away on Tuesday, with the return on August 26, for a place in the Champions League group stage and 19-year-old Julian Brandt came off the bench to score their winner at home to Hoffenheim. Leverkusen fell behind when Swiss midfielder Steven Zuber fired Hoffenheim ahead with just five minutes gone. The hosts drew level when South Korea forward Son Heung-Min took on the defence, Brazil left-back Wendell fired in a shot and striker Stefan Kiessling tapped home the rebound on 45 minutes. Brandt, a Germany Under-20 international, had only been on the pitch for seven minutes when he finished off a counter-attack by hitting the top right-hand corner on 71 minutes with a superb strike. Elsewhere, newly-promoted Ingolstadt celebrated their debut in Germany's top flight with a 1-0 win at Mainz as Austria international Lukas Hinterseer scored their second-half winner. Fellow new boys Darmstadt finished their first game in the Bundesliga for 33 years with a 2-2 draw against Hanover in an action-packed match. Fleet-footed winger Marcel Heller twice gave Darmstadt the lead, only for Dutch forward Charlison Benschop to get the first equaliser for Hanover before an own goal by centre-back Aytac Sulu made it 2-2 midway through the second half. Darmstadt goalkeeper Christian Mathenia saved a Mevlut Erdinc penalty with the score at 2-1 just before Sulu's blunder gave each side a point. Schalke picked up their first win under new coach Andre Breitenreiter with a 3-0 victory at Werder Bremen. The hosts conceded an unlucky first-half own goal when Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie beat Schalke striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar to the ball, but his clearance looped over Werder goalkeeper Felix Wiedwald and into his own net. Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting converted a pass from his international team-mate Joel Matip on 68 minutes before Huntelaar finished off a superb counter-attack on 85 minutes by 19-year-old substitute Leroy Sane, who had just come on. Meanwhile, Paraguay striker Raul Bobadilla penned a contract extension at Augsburg until 2018 only to be sent off just 45 minutes into the new Bundesliga season on Saturday in his team's 1-0 defeat at home to Hertha Berlin. The 28-year-old Bobadilla was shown a second yellow card, and the subsequent red, when he was booked just before the half-time whistle. Ivory Coast forward Salomon Kalou converted a second-half penalty to give Hertha the win, while both sides finished with 10 men as the visitors' Dutch midfielder Roy Beerens was sent off for a second yellow card. Defending champions Bayern Munich began their quest for an historic fourth successive title when they routed Hamburg 5-0 at home on Friday with Thomas Mueller scoring twice and Brazilian winger Douglas Costa netting on his Bundesliga debut. Borussia Dortmund, the last team to win the league before Bayern in 2012, host Moenchengladbach on Saturday evening, while last season's runners-up Wolfsburg are at home to Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday."

The 26-year-old has won 40 caps for Chile and was part of the team which won the Copa America last month by beating Argentina on penalties in the final. The defensive midfielder scored twice in a 5-0 group win against Bolivia before netting in the penalty shootout victory over Argentina and Leverkusen are reported to have spent 12 million euros (US$13.3m) on him. He has signed from Brazilian club Internacional, who reached the semi-finals of South America's Copa Libertadores last season. Aranguiz hopes to play in the European equivalent, the Champions League, if Bayer Leverkusen beat Lazio over two legs in their play-off tie for a place in the group stages. Bayern Munich's ex-Juventus star Vidal spent five years with Bayer from 2007-11 and he convinced Aranguiz to sign for Leverkusen. ""The Bundesliga is one of the best and most attractive leagues in the world and Bayer has been out of the top teams for many years,"" said Aranguiz. ""My national team-mate Arturo Vidal has raved about Bayer 04, so I definitely wanted to go to this club. ""In addition, this is a great opportunity to play Champions League football with Leverkusen. ""They almost always qualified for it in previous years and we want to do that again this time. ""I am looking forward to the big challenge of playing in another country."" Aranguiz will slot into the defensive midfield alongside Germany international Christoph Kramer in a new-look Leverkusen midfield with Gonzalo Castro having joined Borussia Dortmund, Simon Rolfes has retired and Stefan Reinartz has joined Eintracht Frankfurt.

The deal has been possible due to a clause in Castro's contract which ran until June 2016, but allowed him to leave for a fixed sum. The 27-year-old, who won the last of his five caps for Germany in 2007 and joined Bayer in 1999, had been on the wish list of Dortmund's in-coming head coach Thomas Tuchel, who takes over from Jurgen Klopp next season. Castro, who has scored 25 goals in 286 league appearances, can play as a defensive midfielder or in defence. He will replace former captain Sebastian Kehl, who is retiring, and Ilkay Gundogan, who is expected to leave Borussia after turning down a contract extension. Dortmund finished seventh, rounding off their league campaign with a 3-2 win over Werder Bremen on Saturday, which was no mean feat as at one point they were in danger of battling against relegation and have qualified for next season's Europa League. They play Wolfsburg in the German Cup final on Saturday at Berlin's Olympic Stadium in what will be Klopp's swansong after seven hugely successful years in charge of Dortmund."

Meanwhile, Leverkusen, who are set to finish fourth in the Bundesliga which means a play-off to qualify for the Champions League, has extended Schmidt's contract until 2019. Schmidt's deal had been due to expire in June 2016, but he has convinced Bayer's bosses by steering the team to the knock-out phase of the Champions League where they lost to Atletico Madrid on penalties in the last 16. ""We're at the start of a development and have a young team with huge potential and a great team spirit,"" said the 48-year-old Schmidt.

But Bayern soon regretted fielding a weakened side as they prepare for a Champions League semi-final on Wednesday against Barcelona. Leverkusen's Turkish international Hakan Calhanoglu fired a direct free kick from 25 metres through the Bayern wall and past Neuer. In the second half, Karim Bellarabi tore through the Bayern defence in a brilliant length of the field run before passing to Julian Brandt who claimed an easy goal on his 19th birthday. The result was a new disappointment for Bayern after their midweek loss in the German Cup semi-final. But coach Pep Guardiola already has the Bundesliga title wrapped up and wanted to rest key players for the Champions League campaign. Guardiola left top scorer Robert Lewandowski, Thomas Mueller and Jerome Boateng out of the squad and Xabi Alonso and Thiago Alcantara started on the substitutes' bench. Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery are already injured. The 2-0 win took Leverkusen, now unbeaten in 10 league games, into third place one point ahead of Borussia Moenchengladbach and into one of the three automatic qualifying places for next season's Champions League. Moenchengladbach play at Hertha Berlin on Sunday. Second placed Wolfsburg gave up a two goal lead against relegation threatened Hanover 96 to drop points. Wolfsburg's German Cup final opponents Borussia Dortmund also drew 1-1 at Hoffenheim. Dutch international Bas Dost got his 14th league goal of the season to put Wolfsburg ahead at home to Hanover with a volley that hit the face of goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler and nearly knocked him out. Croatian international midfielder Ivan Perisic doubled the lead with a stunning 30 metre left foot shot that gave former Manchester United reserve keeper Zieler no chance. Hanover fought back though. French striker Jimmy Briand scored two minutes into the second half. Perisic hit the crossbar with a shot but within minutes Hanover were level. Japanese international defender Hiroki Sakai sent across a corner that was badly cleared and Salif Sane smashed the ball into the net with a stunning overhead kick. Wolfsburg, who have secured a Champions League place for 2015-16, are 14 points behind Bayern. Dieter Hecking's team could see their lead over Moenchengladbach cut to two points if their rivals win on Sunday. Dortmund had to fight back to scramble a point as they press for a Europa Cup place for next season. Kevin Volland put Hoffenheim ahead against Jurgen Klopp's team. German World Cup winner Mats Hummels scored the equaliser two minutes later in the 35th minute. Fifth place Schalke secured their first win since March, 3-2 against VfB Stuttgart."
116,01/05/2015,02:05,Bayern rest stars ahead of Barcelona date,Bayern Munich are expected to name a weakened line-up for Saturday's clash at Bayer Leverkusen with the newly-crowned Bundesliga champions pre-occupied by Wednesday's Champions League semi-final at Barcelona.,"Pep Guardiola has fresh injury concerns with both his top scorers Robert Lewandowski, who has 23 goals this season, and Arjen Robben, who's scored 19, injured while Leverkusen are unbeaten in their last nine league games. Lewandowski fractured his cheekbone and suffered concussion in Tuesday's German Cup semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund while Robben's season is over after lasting 16 minutes of his comeback before tearing his left calf. Guardiola was already missing winger Franck Ribery and left-back David Alaba and will rest most of his stars ahead of his first return to Barcelona's Camp Nou stadium since winning 14 titles in four years as coach of the Spanish giants. Having started 18-year-old midfielder Gianluca Gaudino in last Saturday's 1-0 home win against Hertha Berlin, and given Germany Under-19 international Sinan Kurt his senior debut off the bench, Guardiola is again poised to give youth a chance. Leverkusen are battling Borussia Moenchengladbach for third place in the Bundesliga, which carries an automatic Champions League place. Having reached the German Cup final in mid-week after losing their last five semi-final appearances, second-placed Wolfsburg host relegation-threatened Hanover 96 whose coach Michael Frontzeck signed a five-match contract to keep them up and is hunting their first win in 14 games. Borussia Dortmund, Wolfsburg's German Cup final opponents in Berlin on May 30, are at Hoffenheim in a key battle for European places with just a point separating the teams. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, who is leaving at the end of the season, has described it as a ""six-point match"" with his team buoyed by Tuesday's cup victory over Bayern on penalties. Klopp says the Hoffenheim match has 'the air of a semi-final'. ""We have had some exceptional moments, but now we're in Hoffenheim mode,"" said Klopp. ""It's a six-point game for us, no ifs or buts,"" added the 47-year-old, who will be without injured Germany midfielder Kevin Grosskreutz for the rest of the season. ""We have to put our all we can into the Hoffenheim match, as if it was our last game, we have play bravely and keep our tactics tight."" Dortmund announced on Thursday that Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan will not be extending his Borussia contract which expires in June 2016. Australia goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak, Dortmund's hero in Munich, could feature again between the posts with Roman Weidenfeller recovering from a pelvis injury. Werder Bremen welcome Eintracht Frankfurt to the Weserstadion also hunting a top six spot. Werder head coach Viktor Skripnik used to play under Frankfurt boss Thomas Schaaf during his time as Bremen head coach. The Eintracht coach is pleased to see his old side climb from bottom of the table in December up to their current ninth place and level on 39 points with Dortmund. ""I'm happy about Werder Bremen's recovery this season, the quality of the team hasn't surprised me at all,"" said Schaaf."
117,12/04/2015,15:35,Leverkusen sack Spahic after steward assault,Bosnia defender Emir Spahic was on Sunday sacked by his Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen with the centre-back currently under investigation by police on suspicion of assaulting a club steward.,"Leverkusen, who are fourth in Germany's top-flight, confirmed they had taken the decision to terminate Spahic's contract, which was due to run until June 2016, by mutual consent. The 34-year-old, who is currently injured, is accused of headbutting a steward during a stadium altercation following Bayer's German Cup quarter-final defeat at home to Bayern Munich last Wednesday after a penalty shoot-out. ""Emir Spahic is an outstanding footballer whose performances have been of great service to Bayer,"" said Leverkusen's CEO Michael Schade. ""However, recent findings after the incident last Wednesday left us with no choice."" A video of the incident clearly shows Spahic head-butting the steward and throwing punches during a fracas in Leverkusen's BayArena. The club are co-operating with local police, who are investigating the footballer on suspicion of aggravated assault. The centre-back has been at Leverkusen for just under two years and has made 49 league appearances, having captained Bosnia and Herzegovina at the 2014 World Cup. ""I regret my behaviour after the cup match last Wednesday against the Bayer Leverkusen stewards,"" said Spahic in a statement. ""I want to apologise to the victims and their families for my behaviour. ""I know that I have caused my club huge problems."" This is not the first time Spahic has been accused of violent behaviour, following an incident involving Leverkusen's press spokesman in 2013. Leverkusen captain Simon Rolfes dedicated Saturday's 3-2 win over Mainz, in which South Korea striker Son Heung-Min scored the opening goal, to the steward and wished him a speedy recovery."
118,11/04/2015,18:15,Spahic's Leverkusen future hangs in balance,Bayer Leverkusen are considering terminating defender Emir Spahic's contract as the Bosnia international is being investigated by police for allegedly assaulting a club steward.,"The 34-year-old, who is currently injured, is accused of headbutting a steward during a stadium altercation following Bayer's German Cup quarter-final defeat at home to Bayern Munich last Wednesday. Spahic, who captained Bosnia and Herzegovina at the 2014 World Cup, is being investigated by state prosecutors on suspicion of aggravated assault. The Bosnia centre-back has a year left on his contract, but his Leverkusen future hangs in the balance. ""I can only repeat, without wishing to anticipate anything, that we will announce a decision very soon: either Sunday or Monday,"" Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller told Sky Sports before Saturday's 3-2 league win over Mainz. ""He still has a contract and there are lawyers dealing with the matter. ""He is very sorry for the incident and we mustn't allow our good recent performances to be ruined. Not by anybody. ""We will support the police and certainly the German Football Association (DFB). ""Nevertheless, he is our player and we have a certain duty of care, which is what we have told him. ""But the fact is clear that we are also thinking about how we can proceed, or not, with him."" This is not the first time Spahic has been accused of violent behaviour, following an incident involving Leverkusen's press spokesman in 2013. Leverkusen captain Simon Rolfes dedicated Saturday's win over Mainz to the injured steward. ""We hope the steward gets well soon. He is also a part of our club. The win is for him,"" said the ex-Germany midfielder."
119,11/04/2015,17:41,Lewandowski double helps Bayern brush off injury woes,Robert Lewandowski scored twice as injury-hit Bayern Munich romped to a 3-0 league win over Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday to warm-up for their Champions League quarter-final at Porto.,"With second-placed Wolfsburg at Hamburg on Saturday night, league leaders Bayern took the chance to go thirteen points clear. Lewandowski, the Bundesliga's top scorer last season, added to his tally to leave him with 16 goals for the season and third in the current rankings. Frankfurt were missing the league's top scorer with Alexander Meier, who has 19 goals in 26 matches, out with a knee injury. Coach Pep Guardiola has described Bayern's injury situation ahead of Wednesday's first-leg at FC Porto as 'very critical' with only 14 players fit to face Frankfurt. ""I've never known anything like it in my career,"" rued the Spaniard before the win. Centre-back Medhi Benatia, who has a groin injury, joined flu-victim Bastian Schweinsteiger, plus wingers Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben and left-back David Alaba as just some of the stars on Bayern's casualty list. Guardiola made Bundesliga history by naming four Spain internationals in his starting line-up in Pepe Reina, Xabi Alonso, Thiago Alcantara and Juan Bernat. Despite their woes, Bayern needed just 15 minutes to take the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena when Lewandowski produced a world-class turn and volley. The Poland star made sure of the three points when he headed home, with suspicion of offside, on 66 minutes. Mueller added the third eight minutes from time when he fired home a seemingly-impossible angle. Third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach picked up their fourth straight league win with an impressive 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund. Tenth-placed Dortmund went behind after just 29 seconds as Patrick Herrmann's shot was blocked by Borussia's Roman Weidenfeller, but Sweden left-back Oscar Wendt slammed home the parry. Brazilian forward Raffel addded their second on 32 minutes after a strong run by Herrmann before Norway's Havard Nordveit fired home when left unmarked at the far post with 67 minutes gone before Ilkay Gundogan pulled a late goal back for Dortmund. Bayer Leverkusen enjoyed a 3-2 win over Mainz as they consider terminating the contract of Bosnia international Emir Spahic, who is being investigated by police for allegedly assaulting a club steward. South Korea striker Son Heung-Min opened the scoring with 15 minutes gone and Stefan Kiessling added a second early in the second-half. Dead-ball specialist Hakan Calhanoglu added their third when he drilled homehis 73rd-minute free-kick, but Mainz pulled a goal back when South Korea international Koo Ja-Cheol converted two late penalties. The win leaves Leverkusen fourth in the battle for one of the Bundesliga's three automatic Champions League places for next season. Fifth-placed Schalke are now 10 points adrift of a Champions League place for next season after their goalless draw with relegation-threatened Freiburg. Augsburg stay sixth in the league despite their shock 2-1 defeat at Paderborn, who picked up their first win since February to climb up to 16th. It left Hamburg second-from-bottom as they bid to avoid a first relegation from Germany's top tier."
120,09/04/2015,00:08,Bayern into cup semis after penalty shoot-out,Holders Bayern Munich reached the German Cup semi-finals after beating Bayer Leverkusen 5-3 in a penalty shoot-out on Wednesday as their last eight clash finished goalless after extra time.,"This is the sixth year in a row that Bayern have reached the semi-finals. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was Bayern's hero at Leverkusen's BayArena after saving Swiss striker Josip Drmic's first spot-kick penalty to give Bayern the advantage. Thomas Mueller, Robert Lewandowski, Xabi Alonso, Mario Goetze and finally Thiago Alcantara, who is just back from a year's absence with injury, all then drilled home their spot kicks to put Munich in the last four. ""No-one deserved to lose a game like that,"" said Neuer. ""You could really see that no-one wanted to make a mistake. ""Of course, it's a bitter result for Leverkusen, they really put a lot into it."" In the semi-finals, Bayern will host Borussia Dortmund with Wolfsburg home to third-division Arminia Bielefeld when the semi-finals are played on April 28 and 29. ""That's ok for us, if you want to win the cup you need to beat the best teams, so it's Dortmund for us,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. Earlier, minnows Bielefeld produced a classic German Cup upset by knocking out Bundesliga high-fliers Borussia Moenchengladbach as their quarter-final was also decided by a penalty shoot-out. Lucien Favre's Gladbach, who are set to play Champions League football next season, become the third Bundesliga side after Werder Bremen and Hertha Berlin to lose to Arminia on their march to the semi-finals. Bielefeld held their nerve to win the penalty shoot-out 5-4 as it finished 1-1 after extra-time. Arminia took the lead at their sold-out Schueco-Arena after midfielder Manuel Junglas fired home with 26 minutes gone. But Gladbach, who are third in the Bundesliga table, drew level six minutes later when striker Max Kruse converted a penalty. Third-division leader Bielefeld will pick up at least two million euros ($2.1m) for reaching the semi-finals. On Tuesday, a thunderbolt of a shot from veteran midfielder Sebastian Kehl sealed Borussia Dortmund's 3-2 extra-time win over Hoffenheim to book their place in the last four. The 35-year-old Kehl's speculative half-volley flew perfectly off his boot and into the Hoffenheim net on 107 minutes to put Dortmund in the semi-finals for the third time in four years. Dortmund had taken an early lead but Neven Subotic's 19th-minute goal was cancelled out by Hoffenheim's Kevin Volland just 102 seconds later. Brazil international Roberto Firmino put Hoffenheim 2-1 up at half-time before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalised midway through the second-half as it stayed 2-2 at the end of normal time. Wolfsburg took a step towards their first silverware since winning the 2009 Bundesliga title when a Ricardo Rodriguez penalty sealed their 1-0 quarter-final win at home to Freiburg."
121,07/04/2015,13:18,Bayern ready for 'ballsy' battle in Leverkusen,Thomas Mueller says holders Bayern Munich must show some 'balls' at Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday when two giants of German football clash for a place in the German Cup's semi-finals.,"With the Munich giants ten points clear in the Bundesliga and fourth-placed Bayer on course for a Champions League place next season, the clash at Leverkusen's BayArena is the stand-out tie of the quarter-finals. ""You need to have some balls for that, it's the cup quarter-finals, there is definitely a bit of spice in this one,"" said Germany forward Mueller in his own unique style. Leverkusen warmed up with a 4-0 rout of Hamburg at home last Saturday while Bayern ground out a 1-0 win at Borussia Dortmund with an untypically defensive display. Bayern have a lengthy injury list with wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, plus left-back David Alaba out of the cup quarter-final with long-term ailments. Defensive midfielder and Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger is also out after limping off against Dortmund with an ankle injury. ""He is definitely not going to play,"" insisted Bayern coach Pep Guardiola on Tuesday. But Bayern remain the team to beat, according to Leverkusen's former striker Stefan Kiessling, as Leverkusen bid to repeat their 2009 last eight win over Bayern when Kiessling scored in a 4-2 home win. Leverkusen went on to lose 1-0 to Werder Bremen in the 2009 final and since then Bayern have won the cup three more times. They are the record holders by winning the cup 17 times since the competition began in 1953. ""Whoever wants to win the German Cup has to beat Bayern as some point,"" said the 31-year-old Kiessling. ""We have them now in the quarter-finals, we had them at home a few years ago at the same stage and we beat them to reach the final. ""We want to win and our goal is to reach the final once more, so that means we'll give it our all."" Leverkusen are certainly in line to beat Bayern as both Borusssia Moenchengladbach and Wolfsburg, two of the sides above them in the Bundesliga table, have sprung shock defeats on Munich this season. The other German Cup quarter-finals are all-Bundesliga affairs as Wolfsburg host Freiburg with Dortmund home to Hoffenheim on Tuesday. Then third-division Arminia Bielefeld, who have already beaten top-tier sides Hertha Berlin and Werder Bremen in previous rounds, bid to pull off another shock at Moenchengladbach in Wednesday's other last eight clash. The draw for the semi-finals on April 28 and 29 will be shown live by German broadcaster ARD at 2300 (2100 GMT) on Wednesday."
122,04/04/2015,17:37,Gladbach and Bayer post big wins in race for third,Borussia Moenchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen both posted big wins on Saturday as the battle for the Bundesliga's third automatic Champions League place intensified.,"With run-away league leaders Bayern Munich at mid-table Borussia Dortmund on Saturday in Germany's 'Der Klassiker' showdown, third-placed Gladbach posted an impressive 4-1 come-back win at Hoffenheim. The Bundesliga's top three qualify automatically for the Champions League and with seven games now left, Gladbach's win keeps them two-points clear of Leverkusen, who posted a 4-0 win over hapless Hamburg. Hosts Hoffenheim took the lead at home to Gladbach when forward Sven Schipplock enjoyed a simple tap-in after a final pass from Brazil striker Roberto Firmino with 17 minutes gone. But Gladbach proved their mettle with three goals in ten first-half minutes. First Germany striker Max Kruse drilled home a penalty, then Patrick Herrmann added a second before Brazilian striker Raffael added their third on 36 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Herrmann claimed his tenth goal of the season when he netted after a quick thrown on from Kruse with 51 minutes gone. ""We wanted the three points and deserved the win over the 90 minutes,"" said Gladbach coach Lucien Favre. ""We scored at just the right time to make it 4-1 and it was a good performance from us."" Fourth-placed Leverkusen also underlined their Champions League pedigree by putting Hamburg to the sword. ""We wanted to send a signal that we will fight for a Champions League place for the last seven games,"" said Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt. With the team third from bottom and on course for a first relegation from Germany's top flight, Hamburg sacked Joe Zinnbauer ten days ago, but his successor Peter Knaebel could only watch as his team was thrashed. Midfielder Gonzalo Castro gave Leverkusen the lead at the BayArena by firing into an empty net after Germany winger Karim Bellarabi had pulled the Hamburg defence apart with only seven minutes gone. A diving header from Leverkusen striker Stefan Kiessling just before half-time gave Roger Schmidt's Bayer a 2-0 half-time lead before Kiessling added their third after a goal-mouth scramble with the Hamburg defence pulled to pieces on 56 minutes. Just seven minutes later, Leverkusen added their fourth when Kiessling's pass found Bellarabi to lay the ball off for Castro, who hit the top corner and claimed his second of the game. Leverkusen host Bayern in the German Cup quarter-final on Wednesday. Second-placed Wolfsburg remain seven points clear of Gladbach with a 3-1 win at home to bottom VfB Stuttgart. Swiss midfielder Ricardo Rodriguez converted a penalty and a free-kick either side of half-time before ex-Chelsea winger Andre Schuerrle came off the bench to add their third. Freiburg find themselves three-points clear of the relegation zone after their 1-0 win at home to Cologne while Hanover dropped to just above the bottom three with a 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt. Hanover's Ivory Coast striker Didier Ya Konan rescued his team with a late equaliser, his first for the north German club since his six month sojourn at Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad Jeddah."

Reports in the UK media claim Arsenal want to sign him at the end of the season, but Voeller insists Leverkusen want to keep their rising star, who scored the winning goal on Saturday to put Leverkusen third in Germany's top flight. ""He has no exit clause in his contract,"" Voeller told German broadcaster Sport1. ""We didn't want to be tempted to sell him and that's why we extended his contract. We also need to achieve our goals."" Bellarabi claimed his 11th league goal of the season after 35 minutes at Schalke on Saturday when he fired home from a tight angle to seal Bayer's 1-0 win. Having set the record for the fastest Bundesliga goal when he scored after nine seconds at Dortmund last August, Bellarabi broke into the Germany squad after their World Cup triumph and has played in all of their last four games."

125,21/03/2015,21:11,Bellarabi fires Leverkusen into top three,Germany winger Karim Bellarabi fired Bayer Leverkusen into the Bundesliga's top three on Saturday with a 1-0 win at Schalke 04.,"Having bowed out of the Champions League on Tuesday suffering the heartbreak of a penalty shoot-out defeat to Atletico Madrid in the last 16, Leverkusen leap-frogged Borussia Moenchengladbach to go third in Germany's top flight. Bayer's Germany winger Bellarabi, who has been linked to Arsenal, grabbed the 35th-minute winner from the tightest of angles with a superb shot across goal. ""Now we are up where we want to still be at the end of the season,"" said Bellarabi who has been named in Germany's squad for Wednesday's friendly with Australia and next Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Georgia. Having won the last 16, first leg clash against Atletico 1-0 in Leverkusen, Bayer lost 1-0 in Madrid before suffering the disappointment of losing 3-2 on spot-kicks after ex-Germany striker Stefan Kiessling blasted over his crucial penalty. ""We played a very good game and deserved the win,"" said Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt after his side beat Schalke. ""The fact that the team was able to play with so much concentration after Tuesday's match is fantastic."" But Schalke coach Roberto di Matteo was bitterly disappointed as his side are now five points from a possible Champions League place in fifth. ""There were too many mistakes in our build up play,"" said ex-Chelsea coach Di Matteo, who took charge in October and whose Royal Blues bowed out of the Champions League in the last 16 despite beating holders Real Madrid away. ""We didn't control the game and didn't create enough chances, too often we didn't make the right decision."" After the international break, Leverkusen play strugglers Hamburg in a fortnight before their crucial German Cup quarter-final at home to holders Bayern Munich on April 4."
126,20/03/2015,02:30,"Bayern to welcome back Robben, Ribery for Gladbach",Bayern Munich hope to welcome back wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery for Sunday's clash at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach as they look to edge closer to the Bundesliga title.,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern start the weekend 11 points clear and could still break last season's record when they claimed the title with seven games to spare. The Allianz Arena clash sees the runaway leaders host third-placed Gladbach, but Lucien Favre's Borussia are already a staggering 20 points adrift of Guardiola's Bavarians. With 17 league goals in 20 games this season, Robben is battling Frankfurt's Alex Meier to become the Bundesliga's top scorer but the flying Dutchman is battling to overcome a trapped nerve that saw him miss last Saturday's 4-0 rout of Werder Bremen. Robben took part in training this week, as did left winger Franck Ribery, who also sat out the Bremen victory with an ankle injury. However, with Poland striker Robert Lewandowski pillaging six goals in his last five league games and on 13 for the season, the champions would still have plenty of firepower without the pair. Bayern will be without suspended centre-back Medhi Benatia, whose yellow card at Bremen was his fifth of the season, carrying with it an automatic suspension. Bayern captain Philipp Lahm is set for another place on the bench having made his return from injury at Bremen. Gladbach face an uphill task to take points off their hosts with Bayern unbeaten at home this season after 11 wins and a draw. Fresh from their midweek Champions League exit, tenth-placed Borussia Dortmund are hunting their first win in four games when they travel to Hanover 96, who are 13th. Germany defender Marcel Schmelzer is an injury doubt having picked up a knock in their 3-0 last 16 defeat to Juventus, which sealed a 5-1 aggregate defeat, but defensive midfielder Nuri Sahin is definitely out with a leg injury. ""Our main priority is the league now, although that doesn't mean that we don't want to progress in the German Cup,"" said Borussia coach Jurgen Klopp. His side have improved in the league since the turn of the year having started February bottom of the table following a dire set of results. Hanover coach Tayfun Korkut is under pressure as his side have won just one of their last 10 games. Fifth-placed Schalke have a chance to improve their Champions League chances for next season when they host fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday night with just three points separating the teams. ""I think you can describe this game as a 'six-pointer',"" said Schalke coach Roberto di Matteo. ""We're playing at home and are confident of getting a good result."" The 44-year-old is set to keep teenage goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther between the posts with first-choice stopper Ralf Faehrmann working his way back from injury after picking up a cruciate knee ligament strain in January. Both teams exited the Champions League at the last 16 stage with Schalke going out 5-4 to Real Madrid on aggregate despite a stunning 4-3 win in Spain just over ten days ago. Bayer are still licking their wounds after bowing out on a penalty shoot-out at Atletico Madrid on Tuesday despite winning the first leg in Leverkusen.

127,17/03/2015,23:52,Atletico into last eight after penalty drama,Atletico Madrid progressed to the Champions League quarter-finals for the second successive season after squeezing past Bayer Leverkusen 3-2 on penalties after the scores were locked at 1-1 on aggregate.,"The Spanish champions won 1-0 on the night thanks to Mario Suarez's deflected first-half strike in 120 minutes short on clear-cut chances. And after a topsy turvy shootout including five missed penalties, Stefan Kiessling blazed Leverkusen's final effort over the bar to hand Atletico a place in the last eight. Atletico boss Diego Simeone sprung a huge surprise prior to kick-off by handing on-loan Villarreal midfielder Cani his full debut at the expense of captain Gabi. Mario Mandzukic was also recalled up front at the expense of Fernando Torres, but it was at the other end where the Croatian proved his worth early on as he cleared a shot from Son Heung-Min off his own line after Atletico struggled to clear a Leverkusen corner. The Korean had an even better chance moments later as the Germans counter-attacked with menace, but a poor touch allowed Miguel Angel Moya to scurry from his goal and collect the loose ball. That was to be Moya's last involvement as he limped off with an injury to be replaced by Jan Oblak. However, fortune favoured the home side 27 minutes in when Suarez's shot from Cani's cushioned header was deflected past the helpless Bernd Leno. Mandzukic then had a huge chance to put last season's beaten finalists ahead in the tie when he latched onto Arda Turan's through ball, but he was caught for pace by Wendell and the Brazilian full-back made a fine last-ditch challenge. The visitors ended the first 45 minutes the better and only a fine interception from Miranda prevented them from having a goal to show for it as he cut out Wendell's dangerous low cross with Leverkusen bodies waiting to add the final touch. Cani's Cameo ended at the break as he was replaced by Raul Garcia, but despite a positive start to the second period from Atletico, chances were had to come by for both sides. Karim Bellarabi tested Oblak from distance with an effort from distance that the Slovenian comfortably held, whilst Arda Turan volleyed over Griezmann's cross at the other end. Turan came close again 10 minutes from time when he was found by another neat pass from Griezmann, but this time his driven effort was beaten away by Leno. Torres was introduced for Mandzukic seven minutes from end of normal time, but it was Garcia who had the best chance to win the game when his fierce strike was turned behind by Leno early in the second period of extra time. However, despite a fine save from Koke in the shootout, Leno couldn't stop Atletico from progressing as Hakan Calhanoglu, Omer Toprak and Kiessling all fluffed their lines from the spot."
128,16/03/2015,19:12,"Atletico still the favourites, says Leverkusen boss","Bayer Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt has insisted that Atletico Madrid remain the favourites in their Champions League last 16 tie, despite the Germans holding a 1-0 lead ahead of the second leg on Tuesday.","Hakan Calhanoglu's spectacular strike handed Schmidt's men a deserved lead against an Atletico side that finished the game with 10 men in a bad tempered affair three weeks ago. However, Schmidt believes Atletico's supreme home form in Europe and greater experience having reached last season's Champions League final means his side remain the underdogs. ""For me the result we got three weeks ago is a positive one, but we haven't done anything yet,"" he said on Monday. ""Atletico continue to be the favourites and we'll have to give it our all tomorrow. We know that Atletico are very strong at home."" The La Liga champions have won 20 and drawn one of their last 22 European games at home, but have come unstuck domestically of late and go into Tuesday's game on the back of a four-game winless streak. A big part of that slump in form has been a lack of discipline with Diego Simeone's men ending three of their last five games with 10 men. Los Rojiblancos will again be without two key players through suspension against Leverkusen as Diego Godin and Tiago miss out, and Schmidt knows his young side will need to keep their head amongst the cauldron-like atmosphere in the Spanish capital. ""We know that Atletico have a very strong mentality and they fight a lot. In such a heated atmosphere we need to keep a cool head. ""I am not worried about the atmosphere, but excited by it. It is part of the big challenge that faces us. ""If we want to go through, we need to make a huge effort and we need to enjoy the pressure of the atmosphere."" Schmidt also confirmed that German international Lars Bender should be fit to start despite missing Friday's 4-0 win over Stuttgart due to an ankle injury."
129,16/03/2015,02:10,Atletico look to home comforts to oust Leverkusen,Atletico Madrid will once again have to rely on their formidable home form as they look to overcome a 1-0 first leg deficit against Bayer Leverkusen to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League on Tuesday.,"Last season's beaten finalists have failed to win a game since falling to Hakan Calhanoglu's stunning strike at the Bay Arena three weeks ago. However, they have won 20 of their last 22 European games at the Vicente Calderon, including wins in all three of their group games earlier this season without conceding a goal. Another clean sheet is likely to be in order if Diego Simeone's men are to progress to the last eight with goals of their own in short supply in recent weeks. Since thrashing Real Madrid 4-0 last month, Los Rojiblancos have found the net just once in their last four games. ""In football there are moments in a season where sometimes you are more deadly in front of goal than others. Sometimes the goal comes easily and other time you have loads of good chances and it doesn't go in,"" said Simeone after Saturday's 0-0 draw away at Espanyol. ""We need to keep going, roll up our sleeves and work hard because that is the only way we know how to improve."" Simeone will also be without two of his most experienced campaigners in Diego Godin and Tiago through suspension. However, top scorer Mario Mandzukic is expected to return to the starting line-up for the first time since defeat in Leverkusen after a spat with Simeone in place of Fernando Torres. In contrast to Atletico's slump in form, Leverkusen come into the game full of confidence having won their last five games without even conceding a goal. The Germans could even have put the tie to bed at home with a series of promising counter-attacks that lacked the final finish. Captain Simon Rolfes, though, is backing his side to get the away goal that would go a long way to sealing their place in the last eight for the first time since the reached the final in 2002. ""We need to tick off the last few games and concentrate on Atletico. If we stand up for each other, then we also have a good chance in Madrid. ""We are always good for a goal away from home, but it's just as important that we don't concede one."" The first meeting between the two was a feisty affair with 10 yellow cards, a red for Tiago and a bust up between the two coaching staffs. And Leverkusen boss Roger Schmidt believes his side will need to keep a cool head in the cauldron like atmosphere in the Spanish capital. ""We need a super game, but we'll head down there with a lot of self confidence for the second-leg,"" he said. ""We're still the underdogs, but we've shown that we have a good chance. ""There will be a lot of emotions in the stadium, so we know we'll have to keep cool heads in order to make the right decisions."""
130,14/03/2015,17:51,Bayern cap perfect week with Bremen bashing,Bayern Munich put the finishing touches on a perfect week's work as they defeated Werder Bremen 4-0 on Saturday to extend their lead at the top of the Bundesliga to 14 points.,"Pep Guardiola's side made it three wins in seven days, scoring 14 goals and conceding just one, as they not only padded their lead in the domestic flight but also qualified for the Champions League quarter-finals. German international striker Thomas Mueller grabbed his fourth goal of the week with a left foot shot past Raphael Wolf to put the champions 1-0 in front on 24 minutes at the Weser-Stadion. Austrian defender David Alaba then scored his second league goal of the season to cushion the advantage. Polish international Robert Lewandowski added the gloss with two late goals to round out the scoring. While Bremen, who came into the weekend five points behind the European places, toiled bravely they were unable to breach the goalline of Pepe Reina, who was standing in for first-choice 'keeper Manuel Neuer. The absence of Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, who picked up knocks during the 7-0 rout of Shakhtar Donetsk in teh Champions League on Wednesday, had little effect as Bayern picked up their 20th victory in 25 league outings against just one defeat. Elsewhere, Eintracht Frankfurt consolidated their place in the upper half of the table with a routine 4-0 win over third-from-bottom Paderborn. Alexander Meier got the home side on track with a goal after 27 minutes before Marc Stendera, Stefan Aigner and Nelson Haedo Valdez also got on the scoresheet in a feisty afternoon encounter that featured eight yellow cards. Mainz picked up a crucial 2-0 victory over Augsburg, thanks to a dinstinctive Asian flavour, as they eased their relegation fears. Shinji Okazaki added to his record as the highest Japanese scorer in Bundesliga history, with the opener on 32 minutes, before former South Korea captain Koo Ja-cheol guaranteed the points in the final minute. Hertha Berlin missed the chance for three valuable points as they were deprived victory in the final minute by a Joel Matip equaliser for Schalke. A see-saw match finished 2-2 in the capital. Eugen Polankski struck either side of half-time for Hoffenheim as they boosted their European ambitions for next season with a 3-0 home win over 10-man Hamburg. Jaroslav Drobny conceded the penalty that led to a straight red card and Polanski's opener before the 28-year-old Polish midfielder helped seal the win with his second eight minutes from time. Sebastian Rudy added a third to the delight of the home fans in the dying minutes. On Friday, Bayer Leverkusen cantered to a 4-0 win over Stuttgart and climbed to third place ahead of idle Borussia Moenchengladbach. In the final match on Saturday, resurgent Borussia Dortmund are at home to Cologne, ahead of their Champions League tie against Juventus on Wednesday, while on Sunday, Europa League hopefuls Wolfsburg await second-from-bottom Freiburg. Finally, Moenchengladbach host Hanover in the ultimate match of the weekend."

Son then extended Bayer's lead with six minutes left, doubling up in the third minute of stoppage time. Bayer's reward was to deprive Schalke of fourth spot -- Roger Schmidt's side are now only two points behind third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach. Bayer found out after their match that they had been drawn against Bayern Munich in the German Cup quarter-finals next month. Sunday's earlier game saw Cologne end a near four-month winless run at home with a 4-2 defeat of Eintracht Frankfurt. Cologne's 600th Bundesliga success moved them up to 28 points, five clear of the relegation zone. A brace from attacking midfielder Alexander Meier for Eintracht left him at the top of the Bundesliga scoring charts with 18 goals. On Saturday, Bayern Munich moved 11 points clear at the top with Thomas Mueller scoring twice in their 3-1 comeback win at Hanover 96 as nearest challengers Wolfsburg lost 1-0 at Augsburg."

Atletico finished with 10 men at Leverkusen's BayArena after midfielder Tiago was sent off for the final quarter of an hour for a second booking. Centre-back Diego Godin is also suspended for the return leg on March 17 after getting a second-half yellow card. But left winger Son says his Leverkusen side will need to play just as well in Madrid to reach the quarter-finals for the first time in 13 years. ""It was a very intensive game and we'll need to play like this again in Madrid to get a chance to go through,"" said Son, who failed to add to his tally of three Champions League goals in seven games. ""We know they are very strong at home, but we want to enjoy the win after a superb performance from the team."" Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt says there is still all to play for in Madrid. ""Nothing has been decided, but I think it was important to have not conceded a goal,"" said Schmidt, who is in his first season in charge.

Simeone also has injury worries having been forced into two changes before the break when both right winger Saul Niguez and right-back Guilherme Siqueira came off injured. ""Leverkusen could have decided the match if they had scored again, so we can live with the situation and we still have a good chance at home,"" said Atletico coach Simeone. ""We have to be positive in the return leg, we had our chances, but it wasn't our night. ""They had us under a lot of pressure and made things hard for us.

Having been humiliated 4-0 at home by Paris Saint Germain last season at the same stage, Leverkusen produced a spirited performance. Their potent pressing game nullified the threat of Atletico striker Mario Mandzukic and attacking midfielder Antoine Griezmann, who have scored 37 goals between them this season, while replacement Fernando Torres faild to make an impact. But Schmidt admits his side still face an up-hill task at Atletico's Vicente Calderon Stadium for the return leg on March 17.

They gave little away, showed a lot of maturity so the deserved winner walked off the pitch."" Leverkusen grabbed the winner when Germany winger Karim Bellarabi's back-heeled pass found Turkey international Calhanoglu, who blasted his shot from a tight angle. ""I think we were clearly the better team and therefore we deserved the win,"" said Calhanoglu. ""I gave it all I had for the goal, but we have to play just as well in the return leg as we did today and then we have a good chance."" Bayer goalkeeper Bernd Leno was the hosts' hero after a superb diving reflex save in the first-half to deny Tiago -- which TV pundit and ex-Germany goalkeeper Oliver Kahn described as ""world-class"".

The hosts controlled the early stages as Mandzukic found himself in the unusual position of clearing a 12th-minute shot off the line from Leverkusen centre-back Emir Spahic. The Bosnia captain then rattled the top-left corner of the goal post with a long-range strike on 26 minutes with Atletico goalkeeper Miguel Angel Moya beaten. Madrid's best chance of the first-half came when Juanfran's shot was blocked and Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno out-jumped the waiting Griezmann to deny the Frenchman an easy header right in front of goal on 39 minutes. Atletico coach Diego Simeone was forced into two changes before the break as both right winger Saul Niguez and right-back Guilherme Siqueira came off injured. Leno kept Atletico out with a superb diving reflex save to deny Tiago just before the half-time whistle.

There were no surprises from Atletico coach Diego Simeone, with the strikeforce of Mario Mandzukic and Antoine Griezmann looking to add to their tally having already claimed 37 goals between them this season. Leverkusen have never won a last 16 tie in the competition's current format and were humiliated by Barcelona, in 2012, and Paris St Germain last season at the same stage of the competition.

Bayer, who reached the 2002 Champions League final where they were beaten by Real Madrid, are struggling for form having leaked a late equaliser at Augsburg on Saturday in a 2-2 draw and are winless in their last three games to leave coach Roger Schmidt under pressure in his first season in charge. To make matters worse, history is against Leverkusen who have lost their last four two-legged ties against Spanish opposition. The Germans were humiliated at the hands of Barcelona in 2012, then Paris St Germain last year at the same stage of the competition and have never won a last 16 tie in the current format. But Argentinian-born Simeone says he wants to see a poised display from his team at Leverkusen's BayArena. ""It's a huge match for us. We want to keep control of the game and also keep possession of the ball,"" said the 44-year-old. ""We have to be careful. If we're in possession, Leverkusen will apply a lot of pressure to get the ball back. ""We're in very good shape and are really enthusiastic. But we have to be very focused - this is always very important for our performance. If we do that, we get a good result."" Typically for a Champions League coach, Simeone ignored Leverkusen's below-par results and insisted his side must respect the home side, that lost a 5-4 thriller to Wolfsburg ten days ago when striker Son Heung-Min scored a second-half hat-trick only to end up on the losing side. ""Leverkusen have a good coach and good players, they're a well-balanced team. It's always important to show respect to your opponents,"" he said. ""I don't know if teams give us more respect now just because we've done well in the past. ""There may be more attractive opponents than us, who you would rather face, but we're here."" Schmidt had earlier insisted Leverkusen are the under-dogs to reach the quarter-finals, but Simeone quickly rebuffed the 'favourites' tag for his team. ""I don't think we're the favourites in this tie. It starts at 0-0 so anything is possible,"" he said."

They face an up-hill challenge to contain Atletico's goal-scoring duo of Mario Mandzukic and Antoine Griezmann, who have 37 goals between them already this season. Defending Spanish league champions Atletico are currently third in La Liga and hammered Real 4-0 in the Madrid derby a fortnight ago. Leverkusen have never won a last-16 tie in the current format. They have been humiliated by Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain at the same stage of the competition in recent years and Schmidt is under pressure to avoid any repeat. ""No one in Spain likes to play against them, even Real Madrid,"" said Leverkusen coach Schmidt in Tuesday's press conference. ""When you play the 2014 finalists, we have to see ourselves as outsiders, but it's two games and it doesn't matter what the statistics say. ""We have to show we are able to give a team like this a few problems and showed in the group stages at home that we can make life difficult for any team. ""Atletico are a tough side, they have had an unbelievable year, but I am optimistic we will have our chances. It will be an intensive game. ""We want to show our fans from the very first minute that we have a chance."" Schmidt admits his side will have their work cut out containing the aerial prowess of ex-Bayern Munich striker Mandzukic, who has netted 20 times this season. ""Mandzukic is good in the air, so we have to defend crosses well, but we have also experienced this in the Bundesliga,"" said Schmidt. ""Atletico are good at winning the second-ball. We've dealt with this before but tomorrow night it will be at a higher level."" But Leverkusen's South Korea striker Son Heung-Min is relishing the chance to show what his side can do against last season's finalists. ""Atletico are a very good side, but we are excited to see what we can achieve in the Champions League,"" said Son, who scored a hat-trick against Wolfsburg ten days ago. ""We're all motivated to win this game. ""We just have to focus on our game and put in our best performance. We're at home, which is an advantage.

Bellarabi entered the Bundesliga record books last August when scoring the fastest ever German league goal after a mere nine seconds.

He has had a stellar season, starting all of Bayer's 21 Bundesliga matches and finding the back of net on nine occasions. ""I've never enjoyed such trust as Roger Schmidt. I will do everything to repay him and Leverkusen,"" he said. He made his full international debut for Germany in October in a 2-0 Euro 2016 qualifying defeat away to Poland.

It was Paderborn's first win since the start of November and saw them climb from 17th before kick-off to 12th. Earlier, Freiburg had briefly escaped the bottom three with a 2-0 win at Hertha Berlin in Sunday's basement battle. The defeat dampened Pal Dardai's debut in charge of Hertha after the Hungarian national team coach took charge when Jos Lukukay was sacked earlier this month.

Their shock 4-1 thrashing at second-placed Wolfsburg last Friday was followed by a 1-1 draw at home to Schalke on Tuesday after playing for 70 minutes with ten men. The usually calm and composed Bayern coach sprinted 45 metres to remonstrate with the assistant referee after a Robert Lewandowski goal was disallowed in the 66th minute against Schalke. ""It was an emotional thing to do. I just spoke to him. It was very, very nice,"" said Guardiola tongue-in-cheek after the heated confrontation. But despite his brush-off remark, Guardiola needs an impressive display from Bayern to sooth any jarred nerves after the Wolfsburg defeat. Having steamrollered their domestic rivals before Christmas, Bayern were rattled in Wolfsburg and allowed Schalke to equalise, albeit with a numerical disadvantage following Jerome Boateng's dismissal. The Germany defender is banned for the next three games and misses the Stuttgart trip, plus home matches against Hamburg and away to Paderborn Stuttgart present the ideal chance to get back on track as Huub Stevens side are third from bottom after winning just one of their nine home games this season. Arjen Robben headed Bayern into the lead at the Allianz Arena before Schalke equalised and the Dutch star says they can ill afford similar performances as they bid for silverware. ""Of course, we played with ten men for most of the match, but when you let them equalise, conceding a goal like that can be deadly in the Champions League,"" said the 31-year-old. Bayern have two league games before they face Shakhtar Donetsk in the Ukrainian city of Lviv in the Champions League last 16, first-leg clash. Second-placed VfL Wolfsburg are set to give Andre Schuerrle his debut at home to Hoffenheim after signing the Germany winger from Chelsea on Monday to end his 19-month sojourn in London. Wolves needed a late Kevin de Bruyne goal to scrape a point in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday after their shock win over Bayern. China's Zhang Xizhe is waiting for his debut. Hertha Berlin are at Mainz 05 on Saturday with the capital city club second from bottom and with former player Pal Dardai and ex-assistant coach Rainer Widmayer now in charge. On Thursday, ex-coach Jos Luhukay became the fifth Bundesliga coach to be sacked this season after Wednesday's 1-0 loss at home to Bayer Leverkusen meant three defeats in three games. The Berlin club are battling to avoid their third relegation since 2010. Mainz will have striker Shinji Okazaki back in the side for the first time since his return from the Asian Cup where Japan reached the quarter-finals. Ahead of their trip to face Freiburg, Borussia Dortmund's coach Jurgen Klopp has insisted he will not resign with his side bottom of the table as they bid to avoid a first relegation since 1976. Dortmund will be without Kevin Grosskreutz at Freiburg and the Germany midfielder misses the next six weeks with a torn thigh muscle. He joins Ilkay Gundogan, Erik Durm and Lukasz Piszczek on Borussia's injury list. Roberto di Matteo's Schalke 04, who are sixth, have the chance to climb further up the table when they host third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach. ""They are a direct competitor for a Champions League place and if we play as well as we did at Bayern, we will make Friday count,"" said Schalke captain Benedikt Hoewedes. Fixtures (all times GMT)"

Augsburg took a deserved lead when veteran Turkish international striker Halil Altintop managed to get his pass away despite the attentions of a posse of Dortmund defenders to leave Bobadilla free to fire home his third goal in as many games on 50 minutes. To add to Borussia's woes, Kevin Grosskreutz joined their lengthy walking wounded list by limping off with a thigh injury. Augsburg were reduced to ten men on 64 minutes when defender Christoph Janker was shown a straight red for hauling down Dortmund's Gabon winger Pierre-Emerick Aubemayang. But Jurgen Klopp's 2013 Champions League finalists failed to make the numerical advantage count to suffer their fourth home defeat of the season. Italy striker Ciro Immobile squandered a golden chance in added time when he headed straight at Augsburg goalkeeper Alexander Manninger. Dortmund are two points adrift of second-from-bottom Stuttgart after they drew 0-0 with Cologne. Bayer Leverkusen moved up to fifth thanks to a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin, Stefan Kiessling scored the only goal of the game just after the half-time break at the Olympic Stadium. Hamburg moved up to 13th in the table with their first win in five matches with an emphatic 3-0 victory at home to Paderborn. Their captain and Dutch midfielder Raphael van der Vaart opened the scoring after just two minutes when he converted a penalty as left winger Marcell Jansen was fouled in the area. Former Germany squad member Jansen then made sure of the three points when he fired home on 72 minutes before attacking midfielder Zoltan Stieber added their third in the 91st minute. Hamburg's north German neighbours Werder Bremen continued their eyecatching climb up the table to 11th with their third straight win as they claimed a 2-1 victory at Hoffenheim. Bremen took an early lead when ex-Chelsea striker Franco di Santo scored his third goal in his two matches since a knee injury after just eight minutes. Hoffenheim drew level through a header by defender Ermin Bicakcic, only for Philipp Bargfrede to make it 2-1 when he fired home Di Santo's final pass on 52 minutes. Bayern Munich stayed eight points clear at the top of the table despite playing for 70 minutes with 10 men in their 1-1 draw at home to Schalke 04 on Tuesday. Arjen Robben headed Bayern into a second-half lead before Royal Blues captain Benedikt Hoewedes equalised from a corner five minutes later. Pep Guardiola's defending champions were reduced to ten men when Jerome Boatenng was shown a straight red with only 17 minutes gone for fouling Sidney Sam in the area. Second-placed VfL Wolfsburg missed the chance to close the gap behind Bayern when they needed a late Kevin de Bruyne goal to rescue a point in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt."

Before kick-off, Freiburg's 4-1 comeback win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt had lifted Christian Streich's side up to 13th had sent Klopp's side bottom for the first time since November. Despite their precarious position, Dortmund are just three points from mid-table ahead of Wednesday's Bundesliga match at Augsburg. ""That was an important point. I am happy, we're within in striking distance,"" said Klopp as Dortmund endure their worst start to a Bundesliga season for 30 years. ""That was a tough game to start the second half of the season and was very intensive football. ""I can't preach that we are in a relegation battle and demand Champagne football."" Borussia failed to break the hosts' defence at Leverkusen's BayArena as Borussia's Italy striker Ciro Immobile squandered several second-half chances. At the other end, Borussia's Germany defender Mats Hummels headed Gonzalo Castro's first-half shot off the line in the hosts' best chance after Castro had earlier shot over the bar. ""We can live with that. This isn't an easy place to come and pick up anything,"" said Dortmund's new signing Kevin Kampl. ""We knew they had an extremely good pressing game, perhaps it wasn't the best football, but the main thing for us is to pick up points -- even if it was just one today."" With just 16 points from 18 games, Klopp has serious problems up front as his attack has netted just 18 goals all season. Klopp's new strikers Immobile and Adrian Ramos have struggled to provide the 22 goals Robert Lewandowski hit in 34 games last season before joining Bayern Munich."
147,31/01/2015,20:32,Dortmund hit rock bottom despite point at Bayer,Borussia Dortmund slipped back to the bottom of the Bundesliga on Saturday despite picking up a point in their goalless draw at fellow Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen.,"Before kick-off, Freiburg's 4-1 comeback win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt had lifted Christian Streich's side up to 13th to send Dortmund bottom for the first time since November. But Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund failed to break the hosts' defence at Leverkusen's BayArena as Borussia's Italy striker Ciro Immobile squandered a string of second-half chances. At the other end, Borussia's Germany defender Mats Hummels headed Gonzalo Castro's first-half shot off the line in the hosts' best chance after Castro had earlier shot over the bar. With ten defeats in 18 games, Klopp's side have the worst record in Germany's top flight as they look to avoid dropping out of the Bundesliga for the first time since 1976, while Bayer are fifth. Schalke 04's star striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar will miss Tuesday's Bundesliga clash at leaders Bayern Munich after being sent off in their 1-0 league win over Hanover 96. 'The Hunter', who has claimed seven league goals this season, was shown a straight red for hacking down Hanover's Manuel Schmiedebach five minutes from time. The Dutch international has netted 66 goals in 117 league games at Schalke, but is now suspended for what already looked a difficult league clash at Bayern's Allianz Arena on Tuesday. ""The red card against Klaas-Jan Huntelaar has hurt us,"" admitted Schalke coach Roberto Di Matteo. ""It was a foul and the referee was in a good position. ""Klaas-Jan was trying to win the ball, but didn't succeed and, of course, it's a pity he will be missing now."" The Royal Blues went ahead at the Veltins Arena when midfielder Marco Hoeger slotted his shot past Hanover's Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler with 32 minutes gone. The win lifted Di Matteo's Schalke, who face holders Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League next month, up to fourth in the table. Pep Guardiola's Bayern had their lead cut to eight points on Friday when they suffered a shock 4-1 hammering at second-placed VfL Wolfsburg as the Bundesliga resumed after the winter break. Borussia Moenchengladbach went third in the league on Saturday after Patrick Herrmann netted their second-half goal in a 1-0 win over VfB Stuttgart, who dropped to second from bottom. Herrmann drilled home Branimir Hrgota's swirling cross 20 minutes from time to move Lucien Favre's side up behind leaders Bayern and VfL Wolfsburg. Freiburg's 4-1 win over Frankfurt featured a second-half hat-trick from ex-Bayern striker Nils Petersen, who came off the bench to grab the points for Freiburg and leave Borussia bottom. It was Freiburg's first win since November and it catapulted them up from last place to 13th in the table. Cologne pulled away from the relegation zone and up to tenth with a 2-0 win at strugglers Hamburg, who drop to 15th and just above the bottom three. Cologne picked up their fifth away win, to match Bayern's tally on the road as midfielder Marcel Risse scored both second-half goals. He fired his first through the legs of Hamburg goalkeeper Jaroslav Drobny before burying a final pass from Nigeria's Anthony Ujah 12 minutes from time. Mid-table Mainz romped to a 5-0 win over Paderborn as midfielder Yunus Malli scored twice and set up their third."

Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has Germany winger Marco Reus and Armenia's Heinrikh Mkhitaryan back from injury, but Poland winger Jakob Blaszczykowski is out with a sore throat and Ilkay Gundogan is questionable with a leg strain. Defensive midfielders Sebastian Kehl and Sven Bender, plus defender Erik Durm are all missing after picking up injuries in Dortmund's friendly matches. But attacking midfielder Kagawa is an option at Leverkusen having impressed in training since returning to Dortmund after Japan were knocked out of the Asian Cup's quarter-finals a week ago. ""He's made a good impression (in training) and he's already had a bit of a break,"" said Klopp. Gabon's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang could also feature having arrived in Dortmund on Wednesday after his side's exit from the Africa Cup of Nations, but Klopp wants to see how the winger trains. Klopp has never lost in Leverkusen on all of his six previous visits, but his side face an uphill task to escape the bottom three. ""My mood is very tense, like it would be just before a very difficult exam, but we are in better shape than we were at the start of the season,"" said Klopp. ""Leverkusen is a very important game, one of 17 very important games for us, but I have been looking forward to this since the final whistle of our last league match at Bremen."""
149,29/01/2015,11:40,Leverkusen out to add to Dortmund's misery,Bayer Leverkusen plan to compound Borussia Dortmund's domestic misery when Germany's Champions League sides square off on Saturday at opposing ends of the Bundesliga spectrum following the winter break.,"Leverkusen face Atletico Madrid while Dortmund take on Juventus in the last-16 of the Champions League next month, but lie in contrasting situations ahead of the match at Leverkusen's BayArena. The hosts are third, a staggering 17 points behind run-away leaders Bayern Munich, while Dortmund are second-from-bottom after a disastrous 10 defeats in their first 17 league matches. Bayer inflicted Dortmund's first defeat back in August with a 2-0 victory at Borussia's Westfalenstadion as Germany winger Karim Bellarabi scored the fastest goal in Bundesliga history by netting after just nine seconds. ""We want to do our thing against Dortmund and pick up the three points,"" insisted Bellarabi. Bayer striker Stefan Kiessling acknowledged that Dortmund's desperate desire for points makes them dangerous. ""A defeat for Dortmund certainly wouldn't be the end of their world, but we know what is at stake for them,"" said the former Germany striker. The BayArena has been a happy hunting ground for Dortmund in recent years and coach Jurgen Klopp is unbeaten there in Borussia's last six visits. ""I don't write anyone off. I can't imagine things will go as badly for Dortmund in the second half of the season as it did in the first,"" said Leverkusen's coach Roger Schmidt. ""There are more pleasant teams than us to face as the league resumes. ""Dortmund have players back from injury, but we are also very well equipped. Our players have also recharged their batteries."" Dortmund have Marco Reus and Henrikh Mkhitaryan back from injury and are set to give a Bundesliga debut to new-signing right winger Kevin Kampl, who Schmidt coached at RB Salzburg from 2012 until 2014, Leverkusen will be without South Korea striker Son Heung-Min and Australia forward Robbie Kruse when their respective teams meet in the Asian Cup final in Sydney (2000 local time) on Saturday."
150,29/01/2015,09:08,Guardiola relishing Wolfsburg showdown,Bayern Munich resume their seemingly relentless march towards a third straight Bundesliga title on Friday with coach Pep Guardiola relishing their clash at second-placed Wolfsburg.,"The Bavarian giants hold an 11-point lead over the Wolves as the Bundesliga resumes after the winter break. Bayern travel north with only captain Philipp Lahm, Javi Martinez and Thiago Alcantara on the long-term casualty list with Germany defender Holger Badstuber set to return from injury. Bayern want to hit the ground running before hosting Schalke 04 next Tuesday and then facing Stuttgart away the following Saturday. ""I think it's good to face the team in second immediately because it forces us to pick up the pace,"" said Guardiola. ""Wolfsburg have played an outstanding season so far so that will be tough. ""Then we have our first home game of the new year against Schalke and that will also be difficult."" ""We know how important the first two or three games will be and if we can win our first couple of games of 2015 then we will realise we can take a big step towards defending our Bundesliga title."" Wolfsburg play their first match since the death of Belgium Under-21 international Junior Malanda earlier this month in a car crash. It remains to be seen whether China midfielder Zhang Xizhe makes his Bundesliga debut for Wolves. Due to their massive lead, Bayern's main rivals have given up hope of catching up with Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking rejecting the media's label for his side of 'Bayern Hunters'. Rudi Voeller, third-placed Bayer Leverkusen's director of sport, has insisted there are ""worlds"" between Bayern and the chasing pack. At the other end of the table, last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund look to climb out of the relegation places. After 10 defeats in 17 games, Dortmund are level with bottom side Freiburg on 15 points and the 2013 Champions League finalists are determined to improve their fortunes at Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday. Dortmund welcome back Germany winger Marco Reus and attacking midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan from injury. But they will be without defensive midfielders Sven Bender and Sebastian Kehl after the pair picked up injuries during the winter break training camp in Spain. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has described going into the winter break in 17th place as feeling ""like going on holiday on a bed of nails"". Dortmund boosted their squad over the winter break by signing Slovenian right winger Kevin Kampl from RB Salzburg. Klopp has said his main focus is keeping Dortmund in the Bundesliga, rather than targeting a Champions League place. ""Obviously, we have been viewed harshly, also by our own fans,"" Klopp admitted. ""We have to win back some credit, but we can't just focus on Leverkusen."" Fifth-placed Schalke 04, who face holders Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, host mid-table Hanover 96, who have re-signed Ivory Coast striker Didier Ya Konan after a six-month sojourn with Saudi Arabian side Al-Ittihad.

151,22/12/2014,13:59,Kramer extends stay at Leverkusen,"German international midfielder Christoph Kramer, currently on loan at Borussia Moenchengladbach, has signed a contract extension tying him to parent club Bayer Leverkusen until 2019, Bayer announced Monday.","The highly-rated Kramer, 23, a member of Germany's victorious World Cup squad, has attracted interest from several big clubs in Europe but has decided to stay with his boyhood club."
152,21/12/2014,02:10,Bayern's domination sparks 'boring Bundesliga' debate,"Bayern Munich will start 2015 with a record 11-point lead in the Bundesliga, sparking debate over how to stop Germany's top flight becoming boring.","Pep Guardiola's Bayern have brushed off their domestic rivals with ease and are poised to become the first team to go through a Bundesliga campaign unbeaten on their way to what would be a third consecutive title. They set more records in Friday's 2-1 comeback win at Mainz having conceded just four goals since August and their points lead at the season's halfway stage is also a league best. They have dropped only six points from a possible 51 so far and post heavy wins in Germany's top tier with monotonous regularity. None of the chasing pack of Wolfsburg, Borussia Moenchengladbach, Bayer Leverkusen or Schalke look realistically capable of closing the gap while last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund are languishing in the relegation places. Ex-Germany coach Berti Vogts sparked debate about how to loosen Bayern's iron grip on the German title by suggesting they should receive less of the league's television revenue. Sky currently pay 628 million euros ($768m) to televise Bundesliga games in Germany and the cash is divided up on a percentage basis with the most going to the league winner. ""We have to get to the point where we subsidise the smaller clubs, by a redistribution of the television money, for example,"" suggested Vogts. But the mere suggestion left ex-Bayern midfielder and Germany international Paul Breitner fuming. ""We (Bayern) can't do anything about the inability of the other clubs. And if we have to bleed now, so the money is redistributed, that's just nonsense!"" he snapped. Bayern are one of the world's richest clubs. They recently paid off the loan on their Allianz Arena stadium decades ahead of schedule and posted a record 528.7 million-euro turnover for the 2013/14 season, with a profit of 16.5 million euros. German teams seem to play Bayern in more hope than expectation of claiming league points. ""Bayern Munich are in a different league, I think we can all agree on that,"" said Augsburg coach Markus Weinzierl after Bayern thrashed his team 4-0 at home. And Hoffenheim coach Markus Gisdol reached the same conclusion before his side were duly dispatched 4-0 in Munich. ""Bayern will lose at home sooner or later, but when you lose four, five or six-nil in Munich, that's normal,"" he mused. Having won the 2011 and 2012 German league titles, then finished runners-up to Bayern in the last two seasons, Dortmund now peer up at Guardiola's Munich from near the foot of the table. Having seen his top players playmaker Mario Goetze and striker Robert Lewandowski join Bayern in the last two seasons, Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp said any German football fan looking for a consistently successful team has only one choice. ""Anyone who just wants to be successful has only one avenue to go down: you have to be a Bayern fan,"" said Klopp, tongue-in-cheek. Klopp predicted the current league situation back in April 2013, two months before Guardiola's arrival. Just before Bayern beat Dortmund 2-1 in the 2013 Champions League final, the German media questioned whether the Bundesliga was following the Spanish league, where two clubs, Real Madrid and Barcelona, traditionally dominate. But Klopp accurately predicted the Bundesliga would mirror Scotland, where Celtic have won the last three league titles after rivals Rangers dropped out of the top flight after the club's liquidation in 2012. ""It's nice that people put us in the same boat as Bayern,"" said Klopp in April 2013, with Dortmund second in the table, but trailing Bayern by 20 points. ""But I think from the start of next season, we'll see that the comparison to Spain doesn't fit, it's more like Scotland."" Even the league's top scorer, Eintracht Frankfurt's Alexander Meier, expects the trophy for the most goals this season to eventually end up in Munich. ""I don't look at the top-scorer table and I honestly think the trophy will go to someone from Bayern,"" he said."
153,10/12/2014,14:00,Rising Germany star raring for Leverkusen return,"World Cup winning midfielder Christoph Kramer is keen to get back to Bayer Leverkusen as soon as his loan to Borussia Moenchengladbach ends this summer, German daily Bild reported Wednesday.","""I'm going back (to Leverkusen) this summer and not because I have to, but because I fully believe in their project,"" said the 23-year-old who was in the starting line-up for the 2014 World Cup final. Kramer is under contract with Leverkusen until 2017 but joined Moenchengladbach for a two-years loan in 2013 after two previous seasons on loan at second tier club Vfl Bochum. Leverkusen sports director Rudi Voller has also confirmed that Kramer would be back with the club for the start of the 2015-2016 campaign. Kramer had a memorable World Cup final as he was called into the starting line up after a last minute injury in the warm up to Sami Khedira. The defensive midfielder was then substituted with suspected concussion after a clash of heads led him to ask the referee if the game he was playing in was the World Cup final. Leverkusen are currently fourth in the German league on 23 points, while Moenchengladbach are sixth, also on 23 points."
154,06/12/2014,21:09,Germany's Rolfes to retire at end of season,Germany midfielder Simon Rolfes announced on Saturday that he plans to retire at the end of the season after a decade and nearly 270 Bundesliga appearances for Bayer Leverkusen.,"Rolfes, who turns 33 in January, won the last of his 26 caps for Germany in a 3-2 friendly win over Brazil in August 2011. He joined Leverkusen from Alemannia Aachen in 2005 but says he will not renew his Leverkusen contract when it expires in June. ""It will then have been 10 years at Leverkusen. I have had a great time, I am still fit and healthy and now is a good time to stop,"" he said after Leverkusen's 1-0 defeat at Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich which left his side fourth in the table. Rolfes said he has plans to go into sport management and wants to help former athletes plan their future careers."
155,26/11/2014,23:52,Monaco win at Bayer to boost last 16 hopes,"Monaco boosted their hopes of finishing as Champions League Group C winners with a 1-0 win at leaders Bayer Leverkusen, who progressed to the last 16 despite Wednesday's defeat.","Roger Schmidt's Leverkusen secured their place in the round of 16 because of Zenit St Petersburg's 1-0 win at home to Benfica earlier. Argentina's Lucas Ocampos slotted home Monaco's winner at Leverkusen's BayArena with their only clear shot of the game to stun the hosts on 72 minutes. ""We were well prepared and we knew their game. We knew they would tire in the second half,"" said Monaco's ex-Leverkusen striker Dimitar Berbatov. ""We seized our only chance and one goal is enough for tonight, everyone is happy."" Having frustrated the Werkself for 70 minutes, Leonardo Jardim's Monaco dealt Leverkusen a heavy blow when midfielder Nabil Dirar supplied a superb cross which Ocampos fired home from close range. ""If you saw the game, you can only be hugely disappointed with the result,"" said Schmidt. ""Monaco believed in the lucky punch and their goal came from what looked like a harmless situation. ""Now we need to get something from the final game at Benfica."" The result means just two points separate the group's top three teams with Leverkusen on nine, Monaco second on eight and Andre Villas-Boas's Zenit third on seven points. It means Monaco can finish as group winners if they beat Zenit at home in a fortnight in a winner-takes-all match when Leverkusen are away to bottom side Benfica. The visitors' defenders Aymen Abdennour and Ricardo Carvalho impressed at the back, but the latter picked up a yellow card which means he is suspended for the crucial Zenit match. The result capped a bad round for Germany's Champions League sides as Bayern Munich lost at Manchester City, Borussia Dortmund were beaten at Arsenal and Schalke were hammered 5-0 at home to Chelsea. Leverkusen failed in their pre-match promise to avenge their 1-0 defeat at Monaco in September's opening round, which had been settled by Portugal's Joao Moutinho. The winning goal on 72 minutes at Leverkusen came after some great work on the right flank from veteran ex-Manchester United forward Berbatov. The 33-year-old dribbled through a posse of Leverkusen defenders and freed Dirar, who motored down the sideline before swinging in a superb cross for Ocampos, the only Monaco forward in support, to bury. It was the visitor's first real chance of the game as Leverkusen were punished for their lack of finishing, having dominated the game for large stretches. Germany international Lars Bender hit the crossbar in the first half as his Leverkusen side dominated with eight shots on goal to Monaco's none. Bayer's replacement Swiss striker Josip Drmic, on after an hour for South Korea's Son Heung-Min, fired wide with the game's best chance on 66 minutes. Drmic went close again late on when he skipped through three tackles but could only poke his shot towards Danijel Subasic in the Monaco goal."
156,25/11/2014,22:02,Hot-shot Son aims to fire Bayer into last 16,South Korea striker Son Heung-Min is hoping to add to his impressive goal tally on Wednesday against Monaco to fire Bayer Leverkusen into the last 16 of the Champions League.,"Son netted both Leverkusen's goals in their 2-1 win at Zenit St Petersburg three weeks ago to put Bayer top of Group C and four-points clear of second-placed Monaco. The 22-year-old has netted three goals in four Champions League games this season having also netted in the 3-1 home win over Benfica to claim 11 goals in all competitions. A point against Monaco at the BayArena will put Leverkusen in the last 16 for the second year running, but their aim is to finish in top spot. Son says they want to have their passage confirmed against Monaco to avenge their 1-0 opening round away defeat before the final group match at Benfica in a fortnight. ""We definitely want to beat Monaco at home and not have to explain why we lost to them twice,"" Son told the BayArena magazine. ""The game will be very intense and we want to fight for 90 minutes. ""We're really motivated and we want to settle a score with Monaco. ""We want to fight for every point to make sure we finish first in the group."" The German side have won all three games since losing at Monaco, defeating Zenit Saint Petersburg both home (2-0) and away (2-1), while bottom side Benfica were also beaten 3-1 at the BayArena. Son is relishing playing under Roger Schmidt this season and is benefiting from the new Leverkusen brand of attacking football, which has seen them go fourth in the Bundesliga. ""We have put in some good performances and have collected a lot of self confidence on the international stage in the process,"" he said. ""We're playing very offensively now and that does you a lot of good as a forward. ""It means we're often playing in front of the opponents' goal, so a lot rests on me."" Having been voted into the Champions League team for two of the four rounds so far, Son said the secret is focussing always on his next performance. ""When I was small, I always looked at stuff like that, but now I know that the goal-scorers are often under the media spotlight,"" he said. ""But the success of those up front always depends on the whole team. ""I just want to do my best for the team, the rest will then take care of itself."" Leverkusen have been humiliated in the last 16 of the Champions League in the recent past after being crushed 4-0 at home by Paris St Germain last season, ultimately losing 6-1 on aggregate. In 2012, they were drubbed 10-2 on aggregate having suffered a club record 7-1 hammering at Barcelona when Lionel Messi scored five goals. Son says it is important for them to finish as group winners to avoid a big name in the last 16. ""Of course, it would help to finish first in the group to make sure we only come across the top teams in Europe a bit further on,"" he said. ""I'd like to see us get a good, but beatable opponent in the last 16, but it doesn't matter who comes, we'd just want to reach the quarter-finals, so I don't have a particular team in my head."""
157,25/11/2014,20:39,Berbatov relishing Leverkusen return,Veteran Monaco striker Dimitar Berbatov hopes to frustrate former club Bayer Leverkusen in their bid to reach the Champions League's knock-out phase in Wednesday's clash.,"With a four-point lead at the top of Group C, Roger Schmidt's Leverkusen are in pole position to reach the last-16. A point for the hosts will put them in the knock-out phase, but ex-Bulgaria international Berbatov hopes second-placed Monaco can make life difficult for the hosts in what he expects will be a tough game. Leverkusen are looking to avenge their 1-0 opening day defeat away at Monaco last September when Portugal's Joao Moutinho netted the winner. The German league side have won all three games since, defeating Zenit Saint Petersburg both home (2-0) and away (2-1), while bottom side Benfica were also beaten 3-1 at the BayArena. Monaco have struggled in their last three games, having been held to goalless draws both at Zenit, then at home to Benfica, before losing 1-0 to the group's bottom side in Portugal. Berbatov, who has recovered from a groin injury, says they must improve. ""Just a goal may be enough to make us happy,"" said the 33-year-old in Tuesday's press conference. ""We won (in September), but it was difficult, they had a lot of chances, but did not finish them while we took our chance. ""Hopefully we won't make the same mistakes we have in the other matches and if we can correct them, I think we can get something here. We still want to qualify."" Having played for Leverkusen from 2001-2006 before playing for Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Fulham in the Premier League, Berbatov said he was pleased to be back at Bayer. ""I came here with Tottenham and now with Monaco,"" said Berbatov. ""For me, it's like coming home, I had a great time here and I'm glad to see the progress they have made. ""I regularly watch their games."""
158,25/11/2014,02:02,Leverkusen out for revenge against Monaco,Group C leaders Bayer Leverkusen need a point against Monaco on Wednesday to take their place in the Champions League's last 16 as they look to avenge their away defeat.,"Portugal's Joao Moutinho scored the winner in the tiny principality when Monaco celebrated their return to Europe after an absence of eight years with a 1-0 victory over Leverkusen in September. The Monaco defeat was the only time Leverkusen have dropped points in the group stages and the hosts are just one point from the knockout phase. ""Against Monaco, we want to make our claim for a place in the knockout round,"" insisted Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno. Bayer have won all three games since losing at Monaco, defeating Zenit Saint Petersburg both home (2-0) and away (2-1), while bottom side Benfica were also beaten 3-1 at the BayArena. Bayer will be looking to pick up where they left off three weeks ago when South Korea striker Son Heung-Min claimed his first Champions League double in their 2-1 win in St Petersburg. With a four-point lead at the top of their group, Roger Schmidt's Leverkusen are in pole position to reach the last-16. Monaco have struggled since their opening day win, having been held to goalless draws at Zenit, then at home to Benfica, before losing 1-0 to the group's bottom side in Portugal. The stats favour a home win, especially as Monaco have failed to score in five of their last six Champions League away games. Leonardo Jardim's Monaco have managed just two wins in their last ten games in all competitions, and six in 18 as a whole this season. Leverkusen, who reached the 2002 Champions League final, where they were beaten by Real Madrid, have won four of their seven games at home to French league sides and have lost just one of their last 12 matches in all competitions. Bayer will not face Dimitar Berbatov, who played for them from 2001 until 2006, scoring 68 goals in 154 Bundesliga matches, as the Bulgarian international has a groin injury. Leverkusen's only casualties are midfielder Stefan Reinartz, who is nursing a fractured cheek, and defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos, who has a shoulder injury. Brazilian left-back Wendell is set to return to the side after serving a one-game suspension having been sent off in the home win over Zenit. Schmidt also welcomes back Simon Rolfes and Gonzalo Castro into the defensive midfield after injury. Germany striker Stefan Kiessling will be looking to get on the scoresheet again having ended a run of 859 minutes without a Bundesliga goal as Leverkusen won 3-1 at Hannover 96 on Saturday. Monaco have been on the rise in recent years since Russian businessmen Dmitry Rybolovlev, one of the top 120 richest people on the planet, acquired a majority stake in the club. He invested 180 million euros of talent into the team after Monaco were promoted back to France's top-flight in 2013 under Italian coach Claudio Ranieri."

The 22-year-old then added his second five minutes later at Zenit's Petrovsky Stadium when he held off the Russian defence after striker Stefan Kiessling had won back possession. The Korean star showed plenty of poise in front of goal before coolly slotting his shot past goalkeeper Yuri Lodygin. Zenit scored a late consolation goal when substitute Jose Rondon netted in the 89th minute after fellow substitute Aleksandr Ryazantsev lofted his pass over the Bayer defence to the feet of the Venezuela striker. ""These three points are very important,"" Son said. ""In the first half we were a little bit hectic, it wasn't our match at all. ""But in the second half we put in a much better performance, you always could see that we wanted to win this match, and we finally did."" The hosts' goal sparked a frantic final five minutes as Zenit threw everything into attack in a bid to salvage a point. It left space at the back and Leverkusen's Australian substitute Robbie Kruse almost scored with his first touch as Bayer held on for the three points. The Russians certainly had the better of the first-half chances, while Leverkusen barely tested the Russians defence in the opening half an hour. Brazil star Hulk hit the post from a curling free-kick after just 13 minutes to cause a few nerves in the visitors' defence. Then veteran striker Aleksandr Kerzhakov was presented with two clear opportunities by Zenit captain Danny inside the opening 30 minutes. Leverkusen's goalkeeper Bernd Leno denied the Russian striker on both occasions. Bayer's third consecutive win, having lost their opening match against Monaco, sees them move on to nine points. The victory in Russia was the perfect response to Saturday's shock 1-0 defeat at Hamburg -- their first loss in nine games -- and leaves them in pole position to qualify as Group C winners. The defeat puts pressure on Andre Vilas-Boas' Russian Premier League leaders who are third in the table five points adrift of Leverkusen with two matches remaining. Second-placed Monaco could open up a four point lead over the Russian side were they to beat Benfica later on Tuesday."
160,03/11/2014,12:48,Leaders Leverkusen out to bounce back at Zenit,Bayer Leverkusen head to Zenit St Petersburg for Tuesday's Champions League clash aiming to consolidate their place as group leaders and brush off their shock defeat to Hamburg.,"Leverkusen top Group C having beaten both Zenit and Benfica at home last month after losing their opening game at Monaco and want another win over Andre Vilas-Boas' Russian Premier League leaders to stay on course for the knock-out round. ""We have earned a decent starting position which we want to strengthen,"" said Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller. ""We can work on that in St Petersburg."" Bayer, sixth in the Bundesliga, suffered a blip on Saturday when they lost for the first time in nine games at Hamburg as Rafael van der Vaart's penalty sealed a 1-0 win in a bad-tempered match which saw nine yellow cards. ""The Champions League is a different competition, so this is a completely different game,"" said Voller. ""St Petersburg play football, which is more than Hamburg did."" Due to the time difference, Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt held his last training session in Leverkusen before flying to Russia. Bayer expect to have Lars Bender fit despite picking up knee and nose injuries in Hamburg. Brazilian defender Wendell is suspended, having been sent off for a second yellow card in the 2-0 win over Zenit a fortnight ago with Croatia teenager Tin Jedvaj expected to take his place at left back. Unlike Leverkusen, St Petersburg warmed-up for Tuesday's match with a 1-0 victory over Champions League side CSKA on Saturday to go seven points clear in the Russian league thanks to Javi GarcÃ­a's winning header. ""That was a fantastic performance by us,"" said Villas-Boas. ""The Champions League is going to be a different competition, but we still have the ability to earn seven points regardless of what happens in the other games."""
161,26/10/2014,13:51,Eye injury rules out Leverkusen's Reinartz,"Bayer Leverkusen will be without Germany international Stefan Reinartz for the next three months after the defensive midfielder fractured his eye socket against Schalke, the club announced Sunday.","The 25-year-old suffered the injury on Saturday night after taking an elbow in the face from Schalke midfielder Marco Hoeger during Leverkusen's 1-0 win at the BayArena, which left the hosts fourth in the league table. Reinartz, who won the last of his three caps for Germany in June 2013, came off after 25 minutes with heavy facial swelling to his right eye socket and was taken to hospital. He is expected to undergo an operation during the week. Leverkusen went top of Group C in the Champions League on Wednesday after a 2-0 win at home to Zenit St Petersburg, ahead of the return leg in Russia in 10 days' time, and they host second-placed Monaco at the end of November."
162,22/10/2014,22:55,Ten-man Bayer see off Zenit to top group,Ten-man Bayer Leverkusen went top of their Champions League group on Wednesday with a 2-0 win over Andre Villas-Boas' Zenit St Petersburg to claim a second-straight victory.,"Monaco's goalless draw at home to Benfica means Leverkusen took over at the top of Group C, despite having lost their opening match at Monaco before beating Benfica at the BayArena. There is all still a lot to play for ahead of the return leg against Zenit in St Petersburg in a fortnight after defenders Giulio Donati and Kyriakos Papadopoulos scored the Germans' goals. Leverkusen were forced to play the final ten minutes a man down after Brazilian left-back Wendell was sent off for a second yellow-card. Bayer endured a frustrating goalless first-half as their attacks were snuffed out by Zenit's defence in a dull opening 45 minutes in Leverkusen. But they finally got the break-through they craved when Italian defender Giulio Donati unleashed a fierce drive from outside the area on 58 minutes. His dipping shot gave Zenit goalkeeper Yuri Lodygin no chance as it flew into the bottom left hand corner. Turkey playmaker Hakan Calhanoglu made a break from the halfway line and found Donati in space for the Italian to break the deadlock. Another goal followed five minutes later as Greece defender Papadopoulos headed home Calhanoglu's free-kick just two minutes after coming off the bench. The 22-year-old outmuscled his marker Nicolas Lombaerts to power his header past Lodygin and kill off any hopes of a fightback from the Russians. The only black mark on Leverkusen's copybook was the second yellow card for a handball and dismissal of Bayer's left-back Wendell. South Korea striker Son Heung-Min dropped back from the left wing to fill the breach in the Leverkusen defence for the final 10 minutes. As Bayern Munich demolished Roma 7-1 in the Italian capital, Schalke beat Sporting Lisbon 4-3 on Tuesday and Borussia Dortmund earned a 4-0 win at Galatasaray, all four German clubs picked up wins on the Champions League's third round of group stage matches."
163,21/10/2014,02:10,Son hoping European spirit returns for Leverkusen in Zenit showdown,Bayer Leverkusen's South Korea striker Son Heung-Min says his team must forget their stumble in Stuttgart when they host Zenit St Petersburg in the Champions League on Wednesday.,"Son scored two goals in the opening nine minutes at Stuttgart on Saturday as his side finished 3-0 up at half-time, only to concede three goals and throw away two valuable league points. There is all to play for against the Russians at the BayArena with just a point separating joint Group C leaders Zenit, who are level with Monaco, and third-placed Leverkusen. Having lost their opening European match 1-0 at Monaco, Leverkusen bounced back with a 3-1 win at home to Benfica on October 1 with Son, Stefan Kiessling and Hakan Calhanoglu getting on the scoresheet. Son says Bayer must concentrate on the positives from their Benfica win and forget the second-half in Stuttgart when they run out against Zenit. ""We need to play with the same confidence we showed against Benfica, take the positives from that and analyse what went wrong against Stuttgart,"" said Son, who was only denied a hat-trick by the crossbar in Stuttgart. Former Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas has said his Zenit St Petersburg side need to be wary of their trip to Leverkusen despite their strong recent record in Germany. Zenit's 2-1 win at Borussia Dortmund in last season's round of 16 was their third victory in their last five visits to Germany, but a 4-2 home defeat against Dortmund in the first-leg meant they exited the competition on aggregate. ""Leverkusen are a very, very good team who will require a lot of us,"" Villa-Boas told SID, an AFP subsidiary, in a conference call. The 37-year-old says his team will need a disciplined performance against Roger Schmidt's side to take anything from Leverkusen as they look to defend their status at the top of the group. ""That's obviously our goal, then we'll be in a really good position after three games,"" said Villas-Boas. In Leverkusen, the Zenit coach will have the services of Belgian international Axel Witsel who played 25 minutes of their Russian Premier League draw with FK Krasnodar after an ankle injury. ""I am fully fit again, said the 25-year-old, who said Zenit need to watch out for Leverkusen's potent strike-force including Son and Germany's Karim Bellarabi. ""If we produce our best performance, we'll be able to hold our own in Leverkusen."""

""If we produce our best performance, we'll be able to hold our own in Leverkusen."" There are certainly weaknesses in Leverkusen's defence to exploit as they threw away a three-goal lead to draw 3-3 at VfB Stuttgart on Saturday which left them sixth in the table after Son scored two goals in the opening ten minutes."

Son added his second in spectacular fashion five minutes later when he collected a poor clearance from Thorsten Kirschbaum and rifled his shot past the stranded Stuttgart goalkeeper. He narrowly missed the chance for a hat-trick inside 11 minutes when his shot clipped the crossbar after he lobbed Kirschbaum. Leverkusen led 3-0 at the break as Germany's Karim Bellarabi made it 3-0 on 41 minutes when he fired home after a final pass from Son.

Ozil will miss the Group D qualifiers in Warsaw and against the Republic of Ireland in Gelsenkirchen next Tuesday. He also misses a qualifier against minnows Gibraltar in Nuremberg on November 14, plus a friendly against European champions Spain on November 18. Ozil is also added to Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's mounting injury list and will miss the rest of the Gunners' Champions League group stage matches, including the key Group D showdown at home to Borussia Dortmund on November 26. Germany coach Joachim Loew is already missing several stars for the trip to Warsaw with captain Bastian Schweinsteiger, Sami Khedira, Benedikt Hoewedes, Marco Reus and Mario Gomez all injured while midfielder Julian Draxler has the flu. Chelsea forward Andre Schuerrle also missed training on Wednesday with a muscular problem, but is expected to be fit. ""Things look good for Andre, he received some treatment on Tuesday, so it's normal that he sat out training the day after,"" said team manager Oliver Bierhoff. Draxler, of Schalke, is expected to join the squad once he recovers from illness. Even without Ozil, Loew has targeted six points from their games against Poland and Ireland to give the Germans control of Group D after they beat Scotland 2-1 in their opening match. Bierhoff said Germany are rebuilding after established stars Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker and Miroslav Klose all retired in the wake of their World Cup triumph in Brazil in July. ""We want to win both games and give ourselves a bit of a cushion in the qualifiers,"" added Bierhoff. ""It's going to be a tough October with two difficult games. ""We have to introduce several new players into the squad because of injuries and a few retirements. ""The team will have a different look to how it was two months ago."" With Schweinsteiger injured, Germany will be captained by goalkeeper Manuel Neuer for the next two games. ""These are key games for us, it is important to keep playing well after the win over Scotland,"" said Neuer, of Bayern Munich. Loew is set to hand a first cap to Bayer Leverkusen attacking midfielder Karim Bellarabi, who has opted to play for Germany over Morocco, where his mother was born, on the back of several impressive displays in the Bundesliga."
168,02/10/2014,16:51,Bellarabi's meteoric rise into Germany squad,Bayer Leverkusen's attacking midfielder Karim Bellarabi capped a meteoric rise on Thursday by being called up by world champions Germany for their Euro 2016 qualifiers against Poland and Ireland.,"The 24-year-old, who scored the fastest goal in Bundesliga history last month, was relegated on loan at Eintracht Braunschweig in May, but has caught the eye of Germany coach Joachim Loew with a string of good displays for Leverkusen. He is the only uncapped player in the 20-man squad for qualifiers against Poland in Warsaw on October 11 and the Republic of Ireland in Gelsenkirchen three days later. Loew has also recalled Borussia Dortmund captain Mats Hummels and Borussia Moenchengladbach striker Max Kruse, but is without injured midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger, Sami Khedira, Marcos Reus and striker Mario Gomez. In August, Bellarabi wrote his name into Bundesliga history by scoring after just nine seconds of Leverkusen's 2-0 league win over Dortmund. ""Karim Bellarabi has earned this chance after some excellent performances for his club,"" said Loew. ""He is unbelievably strong in the one-on-ones and is an excellent alternative in our attack."" Germany won their opening qualifier with a 2-1 victory over Scotland in Dortmund in August and Loew wants to make sure they take six points from the two games. ""We must be aware that European qualification is not automatic, even for the world champions,"" said Loew, with Germany second in Group D on goal difference to Poland after one match. ""I am convinced of the quality of the team and we have the opportunity in these games to set ourselves apart from the competition, so these two matches are very important for us going forward."" For the first time, Loew will have his new assistant Thomas Schneider next to him on the bench with predecessor Hansi Flick having been promoted to the German Football Association's director of sport.

169,01/10/2014,23:03,Son stars as Leverkusen see off Benfica,South Korea's Son Heung-Min scored a goal and set up another to help Bayer Leverkusen kick-start their Champions League campaign in Wednesday's 3-1 win at home to Portugul's Benfica.,"Zenit St Petersburg and Monaco's goalless draw earlier on Wednesday means Leverkusen remain third in the Group C table, a point adrift of both their rivals. Benfica are bottom after a second straight defeat following their 2-0 loss to Zenit in Lisbon. The win over Jorge Jesus' Benfica was the perfect antidote to Bayer's opening 1-0 defeat by French side Monaco a fortnight ago, according to Leverkusen captain Lars Bender. ""We didn't start our campaign well, so this was the right reaction. In a group like ours it's crucial to win our home games,"" said Bender. ""It was a deserved win and was very important for our place in the table."" Leverkusen made a bright start as Germany midfielder Bender hit the post with Benfica's Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar beaten after a superb cross from Son. The Germans grabbed their first goal when Cesar failed to hold on to Son's shot from 20 metres out and striker Stefan Kiessling pounced on the loose ball to put Bayer ahead with 25 minutes gone. The hosts doubled their lead when right winger Karim Bellarabi and Son combined before the South Korean striker curled his shot around Cesar on 34 minutes. It was Son's sixth goal of the season in all competitions. Son could have added his second on the stroke of half-time when he found himself in space down the left flank, but he pushed his shot wide of the far post. The hosts should have made it 3-0 just after the break when Bellarabi beat the defence on the right, lured Cesar out of position and squared for Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu, but the ball sliced off his boot. Benfica's right winger Eduardo Salvio trimmed Leverkusen's lead with an hour gone when the Argentina international curled his shot around the right post and out of reach of goalkeeper Bernd Leno. But then Leverkusen went 3-1 up when English referee Martin Atkinson awarded a penalty after ruling Kiessling had been fouled in the area and Calhanoglu drilled home the spot-kick on 64 minutes. Leverkusen host Zenit in three weeks, the same night Benfica are at Monaco."
170,26/09/2014,09:27,Victory needed by both Schalke and Dortmund in derby,Bayern Munich are right where they want to be atop the Bundesliga after five rounds and ahead of a tough showdown against Cologne this weekend while Schalke and Borussia Dortmund both head into the 145th derby needing a victory.,"Munich head to Cologne on Saturday to face a team which had not conceded a goal in their first four games this season until Hanover scored in the midweek round of games. Bayern are happy about where they are, knowing that the weekend/midweek rhythm is just starting with a match-up against CSKA Moscow coming in the Champions League next week. ""I think we can be satisfied after the first five games. We've picked up 11 out of a possible 15 points, three wins and two draws - that's okay,"" said Munich board chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge after the team's 4-0 victory over the previous surprise leaders SC Paderborn. ""Some people expected a bumpy start after the World Cup. We can be very satisfied with the season to date including the Champions League."" Bayern winger Arjen Robben said the win over Paderborn was important but the Cologne game matched that in their bid to stay atop the Bundesliga. ""It was really important for us to win and lay down a marker. That's what we're aiming for, where we want to be and - much more important - we want to stay there,"" said Robben. The top two challengers at the moment - Bayer Leverkusen and Hanover 96 - both have 10 points and play at teams who have not yet won this season in SC Freiburg and VfB Stuttgart respectively. Stuttgart sit second-to-last with two points after failing to hold a 2-0 lead at Dortmund in a 2-2 draw midweek. Stuttgart's troubles - they had scored just one goal going into the Dortmund match - resulted in the sacking of sporting director Fredi Bobic. ""In the end, we probably have to consider ourselves somewhat fortunate to be taking a point. With this performance, we have certainly taken a step in the right direction,"" said Daniel Didavi, who scored both goals against Dortmund. The Yellow-Blacks actually could have beaten Stuttgart but had a shot blocked at the line in stoppage time. In general, though, Dortmund know they cannot give up two goals every game. ""We need more stability in defence. We have already conceded nine goals in five matches which is not just a poor record, it is a very poor record,"" said captain Mats Hummels, who came on in the second half for his first action this season. ""We need to defend better as a team, and all eleven players have to play their part. If you concede two goals in each game, as has already happened four times this season, it's very hard to win."" And Dortmund need to win, having already dropped four points behind Bayern and three behind Leverkusen and Hanover. Schalke come into the match having finally won their first competitive match of the season - a 3-0 beating of Werder Bremen. The Royal Blues have won just one of the last four derbies at home against Dortmund. Manager Jens Keller knows his team will be well served to put together a string of victories to move back up the table. And Dortmund are a perfect opponent for that. ""We don't need to motivate the players for this match. It's the biggest derby in Germany. We are all excited for the match,"" said Keller, whose team has five points in 13th place.

171,16/09/2014,22:56,Moutinho gives Monaco win on Champions League return,Monaco celebrated their return to the Champions League for the first time in a decade as they edged Bayer Leverkusen 1-0 in a hard-fought Group C encounter at the Stade Louis II on Tuesday.,"It was Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim's first home win since taking over from Claudio Ranieri after a difficult start to the season which has seen them win just once in Ligue 1, form that has left them in the relegation zone. The goal on 61 minutes came against the run of play when a swift Monaco counter-attack produced the opener thanks to a piece of brilliance from former Leverkusen striker Dimitar Berbatov. The Bulgarian, who played with Leverkusen from 2001 to 2006, cleverly nodded the ball into the path of Portuguese midfielder Joao Moutinho, who steered past Bernd Leno to put the the 2004 finalists into the lead. The goal handed last season's French league runners-up all three points while Russian leaders Zenit St Peterburg defeated Benfica 2-0 in Lisbon in the evening's other game in Group C. The teams had only met once before in European competition when a Monaco side, including Fabien Barthez, Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet, took four points off their German rivals during the 1997-98 group phase of the Champions League. Leverkusen, now coached by Roger Schmidt, who took over from former Liverpool defender Sami Hyypia, was pulling his hair out from the touchline as his side missed several first-half chances. Turkish international defender Omer Toprak was the first culprit when he fluffed a straightforward finish from just outside the six-yard box on 17 minutes and it got worse for Leverkusen 11 minutes from half-time with what should have been the opening goal. Karim Bellarabi broke in behind the Monaco back line only to somehow screw his attempted chip wide of Monaco 'keeper Danijel Subasic and almost out for a throw-in. Gonzalo Castro continued the comedy of errors in front of goal for Leverkusen on the stroke of half-time when, from point blank range, he saw his volley deflected over by Layvin Kurzawa. The visitors were then made to pay the price for their lack of a killer touch in front of goal when Moutinho struck for Monaco 16 minutes after the restart, and Leverkusen could not find a way back into the match."
172,13/09/2014,18:17,Ribery scores on return as Bayern go joint top,"Bayern Munich playmaker Franck Ribery scored in his first game this season as the champions moved joint top of the Bundesliga on Saturday, while Shinji Kagawa also enjoyed a goalscoring return as Borussia Dortmund saw off Freiburg.","Mario Goetze put the defending champions ahead in the first half before Ribery came off the bench to seal a routine 2-0 win over VfB Stuttgart at the Allianz Arena. Bayern are now equal on seven points with Bayer Leverkusen who were held 3-3 by Werder Bremen on Friday night and are ahead on goal difference after three games. The Bavarians scored the first goal of the afternoon after 27 minutes when Goetze drove a shot through a crowd of players when a free-kick was only partially cleared. In the second half Ribery, who has been suffering from a recurring knee injury, came on and the French midfielder secured the three points when he slotted under Sven Ullreich with five minutes left. The only down side for Bayern ahead of a Champions League clash with Manchester City in Munich on Wednesday was seeing defender Holger Badstuber hobble off with a thigh injury. Meanwhile, Kagawa made a dream start to his second spell at Borussia Dortmund after getting on the scoresheet in their 3-1 win over Freiburg at Signal Iduna Park. The Japanese midfielder returned to Dortmund from Manchester United last month and his clever pass for Kevin Grosskreutz helped the hosts open the scoring after 34 minutes. Grosskreutz's low cross was swept in by Adrian Ramos for his second goal of the campaign. The same three players were involved when Dortmund stretched their lead four minutes before half-time. This time Ramos found Kagawa, who sidefooted home in what was his 50th Bundesliga game. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a breakaway goal shortly after coming on before Oliver Sorg pulled one back for Freiburg. Dortmund are third on the Bundesliga table a point behind Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern. Elsewhere, Japanese striker Shinji Okazaki scored twice and Sami Allagui also found the net against the team he has just left as Mainz won 3-1 at Hertha Berlin. Okazaki gave the visitors the lead after 36 minutes, finishing on the rebound after home keeper Thomas Kraft twice denied South Korea midfielder Koo Ja-Cheol. Julian Schieber fired a great chance wide for Hertha before Allagui rounded off a lovely team move with twenty minutes left. It was the Tunisian attacker's first game for Mainz since rejoining them on loan from Hertha at the end of August. Ronny's late penalty gave Hertha hope but Okazaki's third league goal of the campaign ensured that Mainz got their first league win of the season. Hoffenheim had to settle for a point after Ivica Olic's deft finish drew visitors Wolfsburg level with a minute remaining. Anthony Modeste scored Hoffenheim's goal in the 1-1 draw, while Wolfsburg's Josuha Guilavogui was sent off late on. Promoted sides Paderborn and Cologne are both still unbeaten after they played out a goalless draw. On Friday, Bayer Leverkusen lost their 100 percent record when they were pegged back in a six-goal thriller against Werder Bremen. Werder's Sebastian Proedl made it 3-3 with only five minutes left as the visitors drew their third game in a row."

""It is very frustrating obviously but I will do everything I can to return as quickly as possible,"" said Rolfes, who has played in all five of Bayer Leverkusen's official matches this season. Rolfes, who has been a pivotal figure as Leverkusen won all three of their Bundesliga games the only side to do so, will not only miss several league matches but also their opening Champions League group game with French Ligue 1 runners-up Monaco on September 16."
174,30/08/2014,18:00,Leverkusen battle back against Hertha,Bayer Leverkusen moved top of the Bundesliga on Saturday after twice coming from behind to beat Hertha Berlin 4-2.,"Following their impressive win at Dortmund last week, Leverkusen managed to make it two wins from two thanks to late goals from Julian Brandt and Karim Bellarabi. Tim Jedvaj turned into his own net as visitors Hertha took the lead midway through the first half but the Croatian defender made amends when he levelled on 50 minutes. Hertha made it 2-1 on the hour when Julian Schieber nodded in his third goal of the campaign but two minutes later Emir Spahic headed home from a free-kick. Brandt then smashed home with 16 minutes left after Karim Bellarabi struck the bar. Bellarabi, who scored the fastest goal in Bundesliga history last week, rounded off the scoring with a beautiful volley into the corner. Paderborn earned their first win in the Bundesliga with an impressive 3-0 win at Hamburg. Elias Kachunga pounced on the rebound for his second goal in as many weeks after 29 minutes and the midfielder had another disallowed for offside before half-time. Hamburg's Pierre-Michel Lasogga went close to an equaliser before Mirko Vrancic gave Paderborn a two-goal cushion with 21 minutes left after intercepting a pass and rounding Hamburg keeper Rene Adler. Moritz Stoppelkampf added a third late on meaning that - including last season's relegation play-offs - Hamburg have now failed to win their last nine league matches. Cologne also got their first win since returning to the top flight by beating Stuttgart 2-0. Japanese forward Yuya Ozako put the away team ahead after 22 minutes when he headed in from close range. Things got worse for Stuttgart on 33 minutes when Antonio Ruediger, who has just been called up to the Germany squad, badly misjudged a long ball. His weak header back into the centre sat up perfectly for Anthony Ujah, who thumped a volley into the net from outside the penalty area. Hoffenheim meanwhile were unable to keep pace with Leverkusen after they were pegged back in a 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen. Brazilian attacker Roberto Firmino put Hoffenheim in front after 19 minutes but Alejandro Galvez equalised for the home team with 30 minutes left. Vfl Wolfsburg are still waiting on their first victory after being held to a 2-2 draw by visitors Eintracht Frankfurt. Club captain Naldo got Wolfsburg on their way in the first half but the visitors drew level when Takashi Inui's free-kick deflected in off former Eintracht full-back Sebastian Jung. Maximilian Arnold's fine strike looked to have secured all three points for Wolfsburg but Czech forward Vaclav Kadlec's struck a minute after coming on as a substitute to preserve Eintracht's unbeaten start to the season. On Friday, Borussia Dortmund held off a late comeback to win 3-2 in Augsburg for their first win of the season."

But at club level, the Bundesliga has been leading the way for some time. It averaged 3.16 goals per game last season, considerably more than any of its major European counterparts, while average gates were over 42,000, making the German top flight the best attended league anywhere. ""In my opinion, the Bundesliga's the most attractive league in the world,"" Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Lucien Favre told bundesliga.com. ""The hype in Germany is amazing, and now they've won the World Cup so it's not going to tail off in a rush."" Nevertheless, the biggest problem facing the Bundesliga, as ever, is how to counter the dominance of Bayern Munich, who have romped to the title and added the German Cup in each of the last two campaigns. They have seen Toni Kroos and Mario Mandzukic depart and lost Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in last week's SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, but the Bavarians remain favourites. And yet the rest can draw some hope from the very fact this is a Bundesliga season immediately following a World Cup, and that has not tended to help Bayern in the recent past. After Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup, Stuttgart went on to win the Bundesliga, while in 2011 Dortmund pipped Bayern to the title. In 2009, after Germany reached the Euro 2008 final, it was Wolfsburg who were champions. Six members of Pep Guardiola's squad played in the World Cup final, including Goetze, while Dante and Arjen Robben were also involved until the latter stages in Brazil. That is why chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wanted the start of the new season delayed in order to give these players longer to prepare, but that request was unsurprisingly turned down by Bayern's rivals. ""We have to face the fact that the first half of the season will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, who at times had only a skeleton squad in pre-season training. ""We are at least one month behind schedule."" Guardiola has added to his squad with compatriots Juan Bernat from Valencia and Pepe Reina, who will provide competition in goal for Manuel Neuer. But the marquee signing was Robert Lewandowski, a prolific goalscorer for Dortmund in the last four years. However, Dortmund have moved to replace the Pole by signing Italy striker Ciro Immobile from Torino and Colombia's Adrian Ramos from Hertha Berlin. Stability is key at the Signal Iduna Park, where coach Jurgen Klopp, who led Dortmund to back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012 and a Champions League final defeat to Bayern in 2013, is entering his seventh season in charge. ""We want to establish ourselves further at the top of the league and qualify directly for the Champions League,"" said sporting director Michael Zorc modestly. However, Guardiola knows where the danger lies, saying: ""We may have won the last two league titles, but they clinched the previous two. Our great challenge is to keep up our level to keep them at distance."" Beneath them, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg will again be hoping to contend for Champions League qualification at least. Schalke have kept Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Julian Draxler, while Sidney Sam has joined from Leverkusen, and few teams can boast a midfield as strong as Wolfsburg, with Kevin de Bruyne, Luiz Gustavo and France's Josuha Guilavogui. Bayer have signed Swiss striker Josip Drmic from Nuremberg and have a new coach in Roger Schmidt, back in his native country after winning the Austrian title with Salzburg. Hamburg will be hoping for a stable campaign after almost being relegated for the first time in their history last season. There are new coaches at Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, who have reappointed Armin Veh, the architect of their 2007 title triumph, while Cologne are back among the elite and Paderborn are in the Bundesliga for the first time."
176,03/07/2014,16:46,Liverpool complete move for midfielder Can,"Liverpool have officially completed the signing of midfielder Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen, the Premier League side confirmed Thursday.","Liverpool had agreed a Â£10million (12.5m euros, $17m) deal for the Germany Under-21 international last month but had to wait until the transfer window opened on July 1 to finalise the move. ""I am proud to be a part of the family and I am looking forward to playing here. I will give it my best,"" Can, 20, told liverpoolfc.com. ""LFC is a great club and the fans are amongst the best in the world. ""I am looking forward to the first game and can't wait to step on the pitch for the first time at Anfield."" Can is the third player to join Liverpool this summer after the arrival of Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana from Southampton. Reds boss Brendan Rodgers, who admitted tracking Can for some time, said his performances in the Bundesliga and Champions League had left him impressed and convinced the club to acquire the midfielder's services. ""Emre is an exciting young talent and I'm delighted he's chosen Liverpool for the next phase of his development and growth as a player,"" Rodgers said. ""He has recognised that we are a club that improves and nurtures exciting, ambitious players and I'm looking forward to seeing him take those next steps forward for us."""
177,05/06/2014,13:12,Football: Liverpool agree Emre Can deal,"Liverpool have agreed a deal in principle to sign Bayer Leverkusen's Germany Under-21 midfielder Emre Can, the Premier League runners-up confirmed on Thursday.","The 20-year-old, who made 39 appearances in all competitions since joining Leverkusen last season, has a Â£10m ($16m) release clause in his contract. In a short statement Liverpool said: ""Liverpool have today agreed a deal in principle with Bayer Leverkusen to sign 20-year-old Emre Can, subject to documentation being completed."" Frankfurt-born Can, who is of Turkish descent and can also play in defence, joined Leverkusen from Bayern Munich last summer, helping them to fourth in the Bundesliga and secure Champions League qualification. Can made seven appearances in Europe's elite competition during 2013-14, and has previously played at the European Under-21 Championship and the Under-17 World Cup. Leverkusen's chief executive Michael Schade, confirming the deal, said the club were powerless to keep the player once his release clause was met. ""Emre Can has developed very quickly at Bayer 04 Leverkusen over the past 12 months,"" he told the club's website. ""We wanted to keep Emre at Leverkusen but the release clause is part of his contract. ""So we wish him all the best and lots of success in his time in the Premier League."" England striker Rickie Lambert was confirmed on Monday as Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers' first signing of the summer transfer window. The club are also reportedly trying to sign Sevilla's 21-year-old left-back Alberto Moreno. Meanwhile, Liverpool have taken another step towards the redevelopment of Anfield by submitting a formal planning application which will be considered by Liverpool City Council later this year."

179,20/05/2014,16:46,Football: Cup final error reopens technology debate,Bundesliga clubs are set to vote again on whether to introduce goal-line technology into German football after Borussia Dortmund were controversially disallowed a goal in last weekend's cup final defeat.,"Bayern Munich claimed the league and cup double at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on Saturday after Arjen Robben and Thomas Mueller scored extra-time goals. But referee Florian Meyer failed to award Dortmund a 65th-minute goal, although replays showed a header by Borussia defender Mats Hummels had crossed the line. Bayern's defender Dante was behind the goal-line when he cleared the ball, but despite furious protests from the Borussia players, the goal was not awarded. Just two months ago, Germany's 36 professional clubs voted by a clear majority against providing goal-line technology for referees with high costs being cited as the main reason. Technology in German football has been a hot topic especially since Bayer Leverkusen's Stefan Kiessling was awarded a goal last October against Hoffenheim, but replays showed the ball entered the goal through a hole in the side netting. With Hummel's non-goal being labelled ""Torklau"" ('goal theft') in the German media, the German Football League (DFL) have said they can put the vote to the clubs again. ""If it is the wish of the clubs, a new vote on the introduction of goal-line technology would not be an issue,"" said Andreas Rettig, the DFL's managing director. ""The DFL is already well prepared in regards to this issue."" Even Bayern, who benefited from Hummel's non-goal in Berlin, is in favour of a fresh vote as both the Bavarian giants and Dortmund voted in favour of introducing goal-line technology earlier this year. ""I was disappointed that the league didn't commit itself to goal-line technology and we let the referees remain in the dark about what was happening on the pitch,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told Bavarian television. ""The Bundesliga must precede and there must be a vote on goal-line technology. ""We're talking, of course, about money, but it would be a sensible investment. ""Then we wouldn't be having discussions like the ones we saw after Berlin."" Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German Football Association (DFB) has said they are in favour of introducing technology, but the clubs would need to vote for it. The boss of Germany's referees, Herbert Fandel, the head of the DFB's referees commission, said his officials would welcome the help. ""It if unfortunate that we have no goal-line technology in our highly-professional football,"" said Fandel. ""Goal-line technology would eliminate such fruitless discussions like we had on Saturday."" Likewise, World Cup referee Felix Brych said German officials would welcome the technology. ""We would all be happy if we could get some help in this area. I can speak for all referees in this regards,"" he said."
180,17/05/2014,03:03,Football: Schweinsteiger injuries worry Germany,Midfield general Bastian Schweinsteiger left Bayern Munich's final Bundesliga match of the season with a knee injury giving Germany fans another scare ahead of the World Cup.,"Germany desperately need Schweinsteiger to be fit for the Brazil campaign, but it has been a season of many absences. And noone is giving a guarantee that he will be fit to start the Brazil campaign. The 29-year-old will celebrate a decade in the Germany team just before their opening Group G game against Portugal on June 16 having won his 101st cap in the 1-0 friendly win over Chile in March. A defensive midfield shoo-in for club and country, Schweinsteiger's appearances for Bayern Munich this season have been restricted by a trio of injuries. Back-to-back ankle surgeries hampered him in pre-season, then in November and December before he suffered an inflamed knee ligament at a training camp in Qatar in January. He returned with a vengeance on his first full appearance over 90 minutes in mid-March when he curled home a free-kick for the winner as Bayer Leverkusen lost 2-1 in Munich. He also scored in the 1-1 draw at home to Arsenal in the last 16 as Bayern reached the Champions League quarter-finals 3-1 on aggregate, then netted in their 2-0 league win at Mainz. Having only played 16 of Bayern's first 27 league matches, Schweinsteiger gained valuable match fitness in 2014. But Bayern's defeat by Real Madrid in the Champions League was a psychological blow and the knock to the knee last weekend did not help. ""With his class and experience, he has a big influence on our game,"" said Germany coach Joachim Loew. ""When he is able to play 90 minutes, with his confidence on the ball and tactical awareness, he is very valuable for us. ""Other players respond when they see Bastian is playing well. ""But you can see that he was injured for a long time."" Schweinsteiger claimed his seventh German league title when Bayern were finally confirmed Bundesliga champions with a record seven games to spare after their 3-1 win at Hertha Berlin. Bayern captain Philipp Lahm switched from right-back to partner him in the defensive midfield partner in Berlin and Loew could repeat the move in Brazil. Loew is low on defensive midfield options to partner Schweinsteiger with Real Madrid's Sami Khedira struggling with a knee injury. Borussia Dortmund's Ilkay Gundogan has not played since August with a back injury and a virus, while Dortmund's Sven Bender is out with a pelvis injury and also faces a race against time to be fit for Brazil. Bayern's Toni Kroos, who has had a stellar season in the attacking midfield role for the European champions, is an option to drop back into the Number Six position or Lahm could be moved across from right-back. Having broken into the first team as a 19-year-old at Euro 2004, when the Germans failed to make it past the first round, Schweinsteiger played a key role as Germany finished third at the 2006 World Cup on home soil. He earned the man-of-the-match award with two long-range strikes in the 3-1 play-off win over Portugal and nearly finished with a hat-trick. When Michael Ballack was injured just before the last World Cup, Schweinsteiger filled his midfield role and when fit, is Loew's first choice in midfield. He will be at the heart of Germany's bid to claim a fourth World Cup title in Brazil, providing he avoids a fourth injury of the season."
181,14/05/2014,02:30,Football: Hamburg face Fuerth with proud record at stake,Hamburg host Greuther Fuerth on Thursday in the first of a two-legged Bundesliga relegation play-off with their proud record of never being relegated from Germany's top flight at stake.,"Hamburg are the last remaining side in Germany's top tier to have never gone down and a clock at their Imtech Arena stadium proudly displays how long they have spent in the Bundesliga. But the 1983 European Cup winners have just 180 minutes to maintain their 50-year stay. Having finished their wretched season 16th in the table, Hamburg will join Nuremberg and Eintracht Braunschweig in the second division if they fail to beat Fuerth. Fuerth are bidding to come straight back up after a season in Germany's second tier, where they finished third in the table, and they host Sunday's return leg. With reported debts of around 100 million euros (US$136.9m), Hamburg's billionaire investor Klaus-Michael Kuehne has had to pledge 10 million euros in order for the club to obtain their licence next season. Relegation would further harm their struggling finances. To compound their problems, Turkey international Hakan Calhanoglu, 20, has been linked to rivals Bayer Leverkusen, who face a play-off for a Champions League place next season. With Leverkusen reported to have offered 12 million euros, both German daily Bild and the Hamburg's Morgenpost newspaper quoted his agent Bektas Demirtas as saying: ""If he should change within Germany, then Leverkusen has the best cards. ""This is a club that plays European who wants him and is willing to pay an appropriate price."" Calhanoglu, whose contract runs till 2018 and has no exit clause in his deal should they go down, scored 11 goals from midfield this season and is a bright prospect in a struggling team. He took to social media network Twitter to say his focus is purely on Fuerth: ""I'll be giving my all for the two most important matches in the club's history."" But Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart criticised the timing of Demirtas' comments. ""If an adviser says something like that two days before such an important game, then he is a bad adviser,"" said the Dutch playmaker. ""Everyone here has to understand that he must save the club."" Such is the interest in these two matches that Sunday's return match in Fuerth will be screened live to a public viewing area in the Hanseatic City with only 2,000 away tickets available for Hamburg fans. As Hamburg's 76-year-old former Germany legend Uwe Seeler summed up: ""It has often hurt to watch from the stands, but I assume that we have the upper hand against Fuerth and will stay up."" The next two games will tell."
182,13/05/2014,15:20,Football: Few surprises in Swiss World Cup squad,"Switzerland manager Ottmar Hitzfeld on Tuesday unveiled his squad for the World Cup finals in Brazil, with his 23-man list tallying with pundits' forecasts.","The German veteran, due to wind up his management career after the tournament, stuck to the strategy of mixing experience and youth that helped put the Swiss among the top seeds for the World Cup. ""Our target is to reach the last 16 so that we're in position to pull off a surprise,"" the former Bayern Munich boss told reporters. Hitzfeld's squad, unbeaten during their World Cup qualifiers, hails mainly from the German, Italian and Swiss top flights. Among his biggest names from the Bundesliga are stalwart goalkeeper Diego Benaglio, of Wolfsburg, and young star marksman Xherdan Shaqiri, of Bayern Munich. From Serie A, meanwhile, Hitzfeld tapped a trio of Napoli midfielders, Valon Behrami, Blerim Dzemaili and Goekhan Inler. There were two notable absences on his list, however. Bayer Leverkusen striker Eren Derdiyok had been widely expected to pay the price for his lack of Bundesliga action. But the failure to call up midfielder Pajtim Kasami, of freshly relegated English club Fulham, was a surprise given his solid performance during the World Cup qualifiers, his Switzerland debut. Both Derdiyok and Kasami fell foul of Hitzfeld's decision to pick two players for each position. They nonetheless remain on his seven-man reserve list ready to jump in if any of the main picks are injured before the June 2 deadline to provide FIFA with the definitive World Cup squad. Hitzfeld's decision to have two options per position reopened the door to the squad for defender Reto Ziegler, of Italian club Sassuolo, set to be the alternative option for Wolfsburg's Ricardo Rodriguez on the left wing. Switzerland are top seeds in Group E, which also includes France, Honduras and Ecuador. They open their World Cup campaign against Ecuador on June 15 in Brasilia's Estadio Nacional, before facing France on June 20 and Honduras on June 25. Before travelling to Brazil, they have inked in two friendlies at home, taking on Jamaica on May 30 and Peru on June 3. Reaching the last 16 would erase Switzerland's bad memories of 2010 in South Africa, under the previous generation of players of whom striker Alex Frei was the talisman. They were the only team to claim the scalp of eventual champions Spain, beating them 1-0 in their opening game, but exited in the group stage after losing 1-0 to Chile and drawing 0-0 with Honduras. ""If I tell you that the team's better than four years ago, everyone's going to expect us to make it to the last 16. I'm an optimistic sort, and I reckon we are better,"" said Hitzfeld. ""We have more creative players, more cohesion, a better team spirit. The team is united on and off the pitch. We have all the pieces needed for success,"" he added. In Germany in 2006 under his predecessor, Swiss icon Koebi Kuhn, Switzerland finished top of their group, ahead of eventual semi-finalists France, plus South Korea and Togo, but were knocked out on penalties by Ukraine in the next round."
183,03/05/2014,19:56,Football: Bayern romp deepens Hamburg relegation fears,Mario Goetze netted twice in Bayern Munich's 4-1 win at Hamburg on Saturday which left the hosts facing a nerve-racking final weekend where they could be relegated for the first time.,"As the only team in Germany's top tier to have never been relegated, Hamburg's 20th defeat of the season left them third from bottom on 27 points. That's one point ahead of Nuremberg and two in front of Eintracht Braunschweig with those two sides occupying the automatic relegation places. The best former European champions Hamburg can now hope for is a two-legged relegation play-off against the third-placed side in the second division to preserve their top-flight status. Bayern bounced back from Tuesday's 4-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final, second-leg to return to winning ways a fortnight before facing Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final on May 17. ""It wasn't easy after the Champions League defeat, but the win was important for us for the cup final in Berlin,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. ""I wish Hamburg the best of luck and hope they reach the play-offs. A club with their history belongs in the Bundesliga."" Bayern needed 32 minutes to take the lead as Goetze squared to Arjen Robben and then tapped home the return pass to put the champions 1-0 up. They doubled their lead when Goetze was left free to fire home Robben's corner on 55 minutes, which went in off colleague Thomas Mueller. Goetze grabbed his second when he slotted home Mueller's pass after Robben's shot was saved by Hamburg keeper Rene Adler. Hamburg pulled a goal back with 20 minutes left through Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu before Claudio Pizarro grabbed Bayern's fourth. Bayern defender Jerome Boateng was sent off just before the final whistle for striking Kerem Demirbay. The defeat means Hamburg cannot now finish outside the bottom three, the same fate befalling Nuremberg after their 2-0 defeat at home to Hanover 96. Bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, who lost 1-0 at home to Augsburg thanks to Raul Bobadilla's 94th-minute goal, were already certain of finishing in the bottom three in their first season back in Germany's top flight. As the bottom three are separated by just two points, all that remains to be decided in next weekend's final round of matches is which two go down and who goes into the play-off. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski enjoyed a 3-2 win against Hoffenheim in his final home match for second-placed Borussia Dortmund before joining Bayern next season. Hoffenheim took the lead after just five minutes when Brazilian forward Roberto Firmino beat both Germany defender Mats Hummels and Marcel Schmelzer to drill home his shot. But Dortmund roared back with three goals in five minutes before the break. Germany winger Kevin Grosskreutz slotted in a 29th minute shot, Henrikh Mkhitaryan headed home two minutes later and then Lukasz Piszczek hit their third after a mix up in the Hoffenheim defence from a free-kick. A bad mistake by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who allowed a long-range shot from Niklas Suele to fly through his legs, made it 3-2 to the hosts with 66 minutes gone. Ten-man Schalke 04 need just one more point to secure a direct Champions League place next season after their 2-0 win at Freiburg kept them three points clear of Bayer Leverkusen in third as Dutchman Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored his 59th league goal for the Royal Blues in his 100th Bundesliga game. Leverkusen kept their grip on fourth, and a Champions League play-off place, with a 2-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. But both Borussia Moenchengladbach and Wolfsburg can still claim the Bundesliga's fourth Champions League place next season. 'Gladbach's 3-1 win at home to Mainz keeps them sixth, three points from fourth, while Wolfsburg's 2-1 win at VfB Stuttgart, thanks to Ivica Olic's late goal, also keeps them in the hunt for a Champions League spot, a point below Leverkusen."

Bayern needed after 32 minutes to take the lead at Hamburg as Goetze squared to Arjen Robben and then tapped home the return pass to put the champions 1-0 up.

186,02/05/2014,02:25,Football: Real rout boosts Hamburg's hopes against Bayern,Rafael van der Vaart says Real Madrid's 4-0 drubbing of Bayern Munich in the Champions League will boost relegation-threatened Hamburg against the Bavarian giants in Saturday's Bundesliga clash.,"Hamburg, the only club in Germany's top flight to have never gone down, sit third from bottom in the table and at risk of an historic relegation. A thousand fans watched the team go through their paces on Thursday and shouts of ""never in the second division!"" echoed around the training ground. Hamburg are five points from safety with two games left and desperately need points against champions Bayern to climb out of the bottom three. If they finish 16th, they will face a last chance play-off against the third-placed side in the second division to try to maintain their Bundesliga place. But Bayern's Champions League exit in Tuesday's 4-0 semi-final, second-leg drubbing at home to Real has given Hamburg hope, says Netherlands star Van der Vaart. ""It's a matter of survival and honour for us. If we give our all, then we also have a chance against Bayern,"" said the 31-year-old, who is hoping to play after recovering from a calf injury. But the Dutch playmaker says Hamburg must be confident against Bayern. ""We need to show some balls, Bayern won't give anything away and it would be really bad for them to lose two games in a row,"" he said. Since being confirmed Bundesliga champions with a record seven games to spare at the end of last month, Bayern have produced some below-par performances which culminated in their drubbing at the hands of Real. ""After the defeat to Real, Bayern are sure to have no great desire to get on the plane to Hamburg. We want to annoy them,"" said director of sport Oliver Kreuzer in a radio interview. The Bavarian giants have wounded pride and will be looking to bounce back at Hamburg ahead of their German Cup final against arch rivals Borussia Dortmund in Berlin on May 17. ""We need to quickly lick our wounds so we put in a better performance in the Cup final against Dortmund,"" insisted chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Hamburg have suffered some heavy losses to Bayern recently, being routed 5-0 at home in February's German Cup quarter-finals and humbled 9-2 in Munich in the league in March 2013. Hamburg, for whom Mirko Slomka is their third coach this season after Thorsten Fink and Bert van Marwijk were both fired, are low on confidence after six defeats in their last ten games. Even Kreuzer has voiced doubts they will survive. ""There are legitimate doubts about a positive outcome. I have been waiting for weeks to see a reaction from the players,"" he fumed after Hamburg's lacklustre 3-1 defeat at home to mid-table Augsburg last Sunday, their third loss in a row. Hamburg have a few personnel worries with Germany pair Heiko Westermann, Marcell Jansen and Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu all struggling with injuries or illness. The top two places in the league are already decided with Bayern champions and Borussia Dortmund uncatchable in second. Schalke 04 are set to finish third, but the fight for fourth, which carries the final Champions League place for next season, rages on between Wolfsburg, who are at strugglers VfB Stuttgart, and Bayer Leverkusen, who are at mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt. At the other end of the table, bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig are at home to Augsburg while Nuremberg, who are 17th, host Hanover 96 with both teams knowing defeat could see them automatically relegated."

""It's a matter of survival and honour for us. If we give our all, then we also have a chance against Bayern,"" said the 31-year-old, who is hoping to play after recovering from a calf injury. But the Dutch playmaker says Hamburg must be confident against Bayern. ""We need to show some balls, Bayern won't give anything away and it would be really bad for them to lose two games in a row,"" he said. Since being confirmed Bundesliga champions with a record seven games to spare at the end of last month, Bayern have produced some below-par performances which culminated in their drubbing at the hands of Real. ""After the defeat to Real, Bayern are sure to have no great desire to get on the plane to Hamburg. We want to annoy them,"" said director of sport Oliver Kreuzer in a radio interview. The Bavarian giants have wounded pride and will be looking to bounce back at Hamburg ahead of their German Cup final against arch rivals Borussia Dortmund in Berlin on May 17. ""We need to quickly lick our wounds so we put in a better performance in the Cup final against Dortmund,"" insisted chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Hamburg have suffered some heavy losses to Bayern recently, being routed 5-0 at home in February's German Cup quarter-finals and humbled 9-2 in Munich in the league in March 2013. Hamburg, for whom Mirko Slomka is their third coach this season after Thorsten Fink and Bert van Marwijk were both fired, are low on confidence after six defeats in their last ten games. Even Kreuzer has voiced doubts they will survive. ""There are legitimate doubts about a positive outcome. I have been waiting for weeks to see a reaction from the players,"" he fumed after Hamburg's lacklustre 3-1 defeat at home to mid-table Augsburg last Sunday, their third loss in a row. Hamburg have a few personnel worries with Germany pair Heiko Westermann, Marcell Jansen and Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu all struggling with injuries or illness. The top two places in the league are already decided with Bayern champions and Borussia Dortmund uncatchable in second. Schalke 04 are set to finish third, but the fight for fourth, which carries the final Champions League place for next season, rages on between Wolfsburg, who are at strugglers VfB Stuttgart, and Bayer Leverkusen, who are at mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt. At the other end of the table, bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig are at home to Augsburg while Nuremberg, who are 17th, host Hanover 96 with both teams knowing defeat could see them automatically relegated."
188,28/04/2014,14:45,Football: Season over for Leverkusen's Kiessling,Bayer Leverkusen must do without injured striker Stefan Kiessling in their bid to qualify for a place in next season's Champions League after the Germany international tore his left hamstring.,"Kiessling will miss Leverkusen's last two league games of the season with the 'Werkself' holding onto fourth in the league, which carries a Champions League play-off berth, by just a point from VfL Wolfsburg. Bayer crashed out of this season's Champions League with a 6-1 aggregate defeat at the hands of Paris St Germain in the last 16 and fired coach Sami Hyypia earlier this month after a run of defeats in a bid to protect their status in next season's competition. The loss of Kiessling is a blow to their hopes under caretaker coach Sascha Lewandowski with a fortnight left in the season. The 30-year-old suffered the injury in Leverkusen's 2-2 draw at home to second-placed Borussia Dortmund on Saturday and a scan confirmed the worst, meaning he will miss his side's final two matches, at home to Eintracht Frankfurt and away to Werder Bremen. Having made his last international appearance at the 2010 World Cup, Kiessling was the Bundesliga's top-scorer last season with 25 goals in 34 league games and has hit the net 19 times for Bayer this season."
189,27/04/2014,19:31,Football: Defeat leaves Hamburg deep in relegation mire,Former European champions Hamburg remain in danger of being relegated from the Bundesliga for the first time in their history after losing 3-1 away to Augsburg on Sunday.,"They were three goals down inside 42 minutes as Turkey striker Halil Altintop scored a brace and Andre Hahn added another goal for the hosts, and Heiko Westermann's reply just before the interval proved to be a mere consolation for HSV. Hamburg won the European Cup in 1983 but have not won any major honours since 1987, and now their status as the only club in Germany's top flight never to have been relegated is under serious threat with only two games of the season remaining. Mirko Slomka's side lie 16th in the table, only a point clear of the automatic relegation places and with a home game against reigning European champions Bayern Munich and a tricky trip to Mainz still to come. Should Hamburg remain third from bottom, they will earn a reprieve in the form of a two-legged play-off against the side which finishes third in the second tier for the right to play top-flight football next season. Borussia Dortmund, who drew 2-2 with Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, will finish the season second to Bayern for the second year running after third-placed Schalke lost 1-0 at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday. A first-half strike from winger Patrick Herrmann gave Gladbach the win in Gelsenkirchen which left Schalke in third and seven points adrift of neighbours Dortmund with two games left. On Saturday, Bayern Munich warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League semi-final second leg at home to Real Madrid with a 5-2 come-from-behind win against Werder Bremen. Three days after their 1-0 first-leg loss in Madrid, Bayern fell behind twice against Bremen at the Allianz Arena before scoring four second-half goals without reply. The flattering scoreline failed to mask Bayern's woeful first-half defending, which must sound the alarm bells for coach Pep Guardiola given the danger of conceding an away goal to Real. Bayern have conceded the first goal in seven of their nine matches since winning the Bundesliga title late last month with a record seven matches to spare. Once again the Munich defence was left wanting in the first 45 minutes before the reigning European champions roared back. Bayern blasted Werder 7-0 in Bremen last December, but Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie fired the visitors into a 1-0 lead after 10 minutes at the Allianz Arena. France winger Franck Ribery equalised before Aaron Hunt capitalised on some poor marking for Bremen's second to make it 2-1 at the break. Bayern equalised again when Thomas Mueller headed on Ribery's corner and Claudio Pizarro was on hand to stab home his shot to make it 2-2 on 54 minutes, then the Peru veteran added his second against his old club four minutes later. Bastian Schweinsteiger then powered home a header on 61 minutes before Arjen Robben hit the top corner of the net to make it 5-2 on 74 minutes, less than 60 seconds after coming off the bench. On Saturday night Dortmund drew 2-2 at fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen with all four goals coming in the first 45 minutes. Goals by Lars Bender and Gonzalo Castro for the hosts were cancelled out by a header from Dortmund's Oliver Kirch and a Marco Reus penalty following a clear handball from Bayer defender Roberto Hilbert. VfL Wolfsburg's own hopes of Champions League qualification were dealt a blow when they were held to a 2-2 draw at home by Freiburg to stay fifth. Eintracht Braunschweig remain rooted to the bottom of the table after their 2-0 defeat at Hertha Berlin with USA international John Anthony Brooks and Tunisia striker Sami Allagui scoring the capital club's second-half goals. Striker Shinji Okazaki became the highest-scoring Japanese player in a single Bundesliga season when he scored his 14th goal to break Shinji Kagawa's previous record in Mainz's 2-0 win at home to Nuremberg. Okazaki headed his side's opening goal to break Shinja Kagawa's previous record, set for Borussia Dortmund in the 2011/12 season before he joined Manchester United."

The victory leaves Bayern on 81 points and 17 points clear of second-placed Dortmund who picked up their fifth straight win. Borussia enjoyed a 4-2 victory at home to ten-man Mainz 05 as coach Jurgen Klopp faced his former side having coached them from 2001-08.

Ten-man VfL Wolfsburg romped to a 3-1 win at Hamburg as goals by Ivan Perisic, Kevin de Bruyne and Ivica Olic gave Wolves a 3-0 lead just after the break before Hamburg's Ivo Ilicevic scored a consolation for the hosts who remain third from bottom. Wolves were reduced to ten men when Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo was sent off for a second yellow card on 90 minutes. Hamburg are facing an historic first relegation from Germany's top flight. Freiburg are virtually assured of their survival as their 4-2 win at home to ten-man Borussia Moenchengladbach left them eight points above the relegation places with three games left.

198,19/04/2014,20:42,Football: Below-par Bayern end league slump as Real loom,"Bayern Munich ended a run of three Bundesliga games without victory in Saturday's unimpressive 2-0 win at bottom club Eintracht Braunschweig, four days before their Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid.","Peru veteran Claudio Pizarro, 35, and Croatian striker Mario Mandzukic were on target with late goals in what was only Bayern's third win in their last seven games in all competitions. Despite enjoying their customary 65 percent possession and fielding a near full-strength team, Bayern needed 76 minutes to breach the Braunschweig defence with the hosts battling to preserve their top-flight status. The breakthrough came when Mario Goezte found Pizarro and he scored Bayern's first goal in their last three league games. With the Braunschweig defence tiring, Mandzukic grabbed their second three minutes from time as Bayern won their first league match since winning the title nearly four weeks ago with a record seven games to spare. But just as they were in recent consecutive defeats to Augsburg and Borussia Dortmund, Bayern looked lethargic, despite coach Pep Guardiola's pre-match wish for a polished performance to take a ""good feeling"" to Madrid. ""It's not easy for us after winning the German title, but we fought despite a difficult situation"" said Guardiola. ""Braunschweig fought with heart and passion, which didn't make life easy for us. ""We had the game under more control after the break and I'm happy with the win. ""But we won't reach the Champions League final unless we put in a commanding performance against Real Madrid."" Bayern were without Manchester United-target Toni Kroos and Rafinha, who were both suspended, while left-back David Alaba was missing with a cold. Germany goalkeeper Manuer Neuer sat out the trip to Braunschweig as he recovers from a calf injury with reserve shot-stopper Lukas Raeder stepping in for the third time. The victory leaves Bayern on 81 points and 17 points clear of second-placed Dortmund who picked up their fifth straight win. Borussia enjoyed a 4-2 victory at home to ten-man Mainz 05 as coach Jurgen Klopp faced his former side having coached them from 2001-08.

Ten-man VfL Wolfsburg took a step towards a Champions League berth with a 3-1 win at relegation-threatened Hamburg to leapfrog Bayer Leverkusen into fourth place. Goals by Ivan Perisic, Kevin de Bruyne and Ivica Olic gave Wolves a 3-0 lead just after the break before Hamburg's Ivo Ilicevic scored a consolation for the hosts who remain third from bottom. Wolves were reduced to ten men when Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo was sent off for a second yellow card on 90 minutes. Hamburg have just three games left to escape the bottom three as they face an historic first relegation from Germany's top flight. Leverkusen can regain fourth place when they visit second-from-bottom Nuremberg on Sunday. At the other end of the table, Freiburg are virtually assured of their survival as their 4-2 win at home to ten-man Borussia Moenchengladbach left them eight points above the relegation places with three games left. Likewise, Werder Bremen are set to stay in the Bundesliga as their 3-1 win at home to Hoffenheim lifted them up to 11th and nine points from danger while mid-table Hertha Berlin and Augsburg shared the points in a goalless draw."
199,18/04/2014,02:20,Football: Bayern eager for Real Madrid confidence boost,Bayern Munich need a convincing win at Bundesliga bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig on Saturday to dismiss talk of a mini-crisis ahead of their Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid.,"With only two wins in their last six games, Bayern have suffered a dip since winning the Bundesliga nearly a month ago with a record seven games to spare. Bayern booked their place in next month's German Cup final with a 5-1 drubbing of second division Kaiserslautern in Wednesday's semi-final in Munich. But Munich's director of sport Matthias Sammer said while the scoreline was impressive, the performance was lacking spark. Bayern have lost back-to-back league matches, an obvious concern ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, first leg at Real Madrid. ""I had the feeling that we're not really running hot at the moment,"" said Sammer, who questioned Bayern's desire to win the Champions League and German Cup finals. ""For the tasks we are facing, that's not enough. We have to ask ourselves if we still want to win these two titles."" On paper, Bayern's trip to Braunschweig looks straightforward, but the hosts have picked up seven points in their last four games to boost their survival bid. Braunschweig are without injured captain and striker Domi Kumbela, a rich source of goals for them in recent weeks, and are just three points from safety. Bayern will be without right-back Rafinha, who is serving a three-match ban after being sent off in last Saturday's 3-0 league defeat at home to Borussia Dortmund. There is also a question mark over Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer who missed the mid-week game with a calf strain. It remains to be seen whether coach Pep Guardiola rests his squad or looks for some continuity by naming a strong team four days before the trip to Real. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund host Mainz looking to pick up their fifth straight win having booked their German Cup final berth against Bayern on May 17. Dortmund enjoyed a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg in Tuesday's semi-final but both goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller (groin) and striker Robert Lewandowski (thigh) are carrying knocks. Lewandowski scored his 100th goal for Dortmund against Wolfsburg, but his final match in the black and yellow jersey will be against future employers Bayern in the cup final. Seventh-placed Mainz 05 now find themselves in a Europa League spot due to both cup finalists Dortmund and Bayern having qualified directly for next season's Champions League. A few shock results can be expected in the last four weeks of the season with sides desperate for points in the lower half of the table set to surprise those higher up. A good example is Saturday evening's tie when relegation-threatened Hamburg host VfL Wolfsburg, who are just a point off a Champions League berth for next season. Hamburg are the only team in Germany's top-flight to have never been relegated and have just four games left to escape the bottom three. Hamburg coach Mirko Slomka is without centre-back Heiko Westermann who has a groin injury. Wolves are without defensive midfielder Junior Malanda who tore knee ligaments in Tuesday's cup defeat at Dortmund. There will be a similar points battle when Nuremberg host Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday with the visitors eager to hold off Wolves and stay fourth. Second-from-bottom Nuremberg are two points from safety, but have lost their last three games. Likewise, Leverkusen have fragile confidence with only two wins in their last 13 matches despite their fourth place and fired coach Sami Hyypia a fortnight ago.

Goals by Bastian Schweinsteiger, Toni Kroos, Thomas Mueller, Mario Mandzukic and Mario Goetze saw Bayern go through to the May 17 final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Bayern, who wrapped up this season's Bundesliga title with a record seven games to spare, will face Dortmund, who shocked Bayern 3-0 in Munich in the league last Saturday, in a repeat of last season's Champions League final. Pep Guardiola's Bayern had few problems against the 'Red Devils' of Kaiserslautern, but director of sport Matthias Sammer was unimpressed with the performance ahead of next Wednesday's Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid. ""I have the feeling that we're not really burning hot at the moment,"" complained Sammer with Bayern making no secret of their desire to win the German Cup and Champions League to repeat last year's feat of winning a treble of titles. ""For the matches we have coming up, that's not enough. ""We have to ask ourselves whether we really want these two titles."" Bayern needed just 24 minutes to take the lead when Germany midfielder Schweinsteiger headed home an Arjen Robben corner having earlier hit the crossbar. Kroos doubled the hosts' lead at the Allianz Arena on 32 minutes to make it 2-0 at the break. Robben won a penalty five minutes into the second half when he was fouled by Kaiserslautern defender Chris Loewe and Mueller fired home the spot-kick. Kaiserslautern striker Simon Zoller headed a consolation goal on the hour mark, with his side surviving on less than 30 percent possession, before Mandzukic netted the hosts' fourth to end any hopes of a fight-back. The Croatia international, who scored a hat-trick in the 5-0 quarter-final drubbing of Hamburg, converted a Goetze cross on 78 minutes. Goetze then tapped home Bayern's fifth just before the final whistle as the attacking midfielder beat Kaiserslautern's off-side trap. On Tuesday, Poland striker Robert Lewandowski hit his 100th goal for Dortmund as they beat VfL Wolfsburg 2-0 in the other semi-final. The 25-year-old has vowed to leave the club having delivered silverware this season and faces his future employers Bayern in the Berlin final. Lewandowski, who will join the Bavarian giants at the end of the season, scored a hat-trick in the 2012 Cup final when Dortmund routed Bayern 5-2. Dortmund took an early lead against the Wolves when midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan cut in from the right and unleashed a superb shot just inside the near post on 12 minutes. With half-time approaching, Belgium Under-21 international Junior Malanda hit the post for Wolfsburg and compatriot Kevin de Bruyne fired the rebound wide for the visitors. It was a costly miss as Dortmund went 2-0 up 72 seconds later when Germany star Marco Reus found Lewandowski unmarked and he slammed his shot into the top left-hand corner to reach his milestone."

Second division Kaiserslautern, who earned an upset quarter-final victory at Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen and beat Hertha Berlin in the second round, have not won in Munich for 17 years. ""Kick it like Dortmund and everything will be OK. If only it was that simple,"" said Kaiserslautern coach Kosta Runjaic when asked if Dortmund's victory in Munich gave cause for hope. ""We have to be realistic. Bayern are the best side in the world, they are powerful and the game is theirs to lose. ""We have only a minimal chance, but we will try to take it."" However, it wasn't all doom and gloom from Runjaic. ""We also represent a big club and we're not just going to Munich to swap shirts,"" he added. ""We won't approach the game with fear, but with fun and determination."" Despite Runjaic's heavy dose of realism, Bayern are vulnerable and winless in their last three league games, including defeats to Dortmund, Bavarian neighbours Augsburg and a 3-3 draw at home to Hoffenheim. Bayern could also be without Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who suffered a calf injury in Saturday's 3-0 defeat at home to Dortmund. ""If the game was yesterday, he couldn't have played. Same today, I hope he can play tomorrow,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola on Tuesday. If Neuer fails to play, the 20-year-old Lukas Raeder will deputise, having conceded a goal just three minutes into his Bundesliga debut against Borussia. The 'Red Devils' of Kaiserslautern were drubbed 4-0 by Bayern in Munich in last season's second round of the cup when the Bavarian giants fielded a weakened side. The semi-final tie also demonstrates the 'haves' and 'have nots' of German football. The four million euros ($5.5 million) Kaiserslautern will earn from the German Football Association (DFB) for making the semi-finals will help reduce the club's financial losses for the season to under a million euros. In contrast, Bayern can expect to make in excess of 50 million euros for reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League, where they will face Real Madrid, the first leg taking place in Spain on April 23.

It was Bayern's heaviest home league defeat since 2008 and the two Bundesliga giants could meet in this year's final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 17 as Pep Guardiola's Munich host second-division Kaiserslautern in Wednesday's other semi-final. ""We're not thinking about that yet, we have to beat Wolfsburg on Tuesday and we have already seen how strong they are,"" said Dortmund's Germany winger Kevin Grosskreutz. Borussia had to come from a goal down to beat Wolves 2-1 in the league at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion ten days ago in the semi-final dress rehearsal. Klopp's side have a quick turn-around before hosting Wolves, who romped to a 4-1 win at home to Nuremberg on Saturday and are just outside the top four in the league. ""But we'll be putting in another passionate performance like we did against Real and Bayern,"" promised Grosskreutz. Meanwhile Bayern boss Guardiola has demanded an immediate reaction in Wednesday's other semi-final with the Bavarian giants reeling from consecutive league defeats. Bayern face Real Madrid in the Champions League's semi-finals later this month and are bidding to repeat last year's treble of European, league and cup titles. But their shock defeat at home to Dortmund, with a full-strength side, did little to boost confidence. The Bavarian giants are winless in their last three league games since wrapping up the Bundesliga title with a record seven games to spare. ""We want to see the real Bayern Munich again. We need much better performances than against Dortmund,"" said director of sport Matthias Sammer. Giant-killers Kaiserslautern knocked Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen out of the cup in the quarter-finals and Bayern need to be on their guard against the 'Red Devils' who are pushing for promotion to Germany's top flight. Bayern's Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer missed the second-half of the Dortmund defeat with a minor calf problem, but expects to play on Wednesday. ""We simply had a bad day at the office, but I'll be fine for Wednesday. It was just a precaution,"" said Neuer. Should Bayern and Dortmund book their Berlin places, the Bavarian giants will be seeking revenge for their 5-2 defeat in the 2012 cup final when Borussia's Robert Lewandowski, who will join Munich at the end of the season, scored a hat-trick."

Hoffenheim's Germany hopeful Kevin Volland was only denied the winning goal on the final whistle when his free-kick was palmed over the bar by Hertha goalkeeper Thomas Kraft. On Saturday, champions Bayern Munich suffered their first league defeat since October 2012 as their record 53-match unbeaten run was ended by a 1-0 defeat at Augsburg. Coach Pep Guardiola paid the price for naming a weakened team for the Bavarian derby with one eye on Wednesday's Champions League return leg at home to Manchester United. The Spaniard made seven changes from the side which drew 1-1 at Manchester United last Tuesday in the quarter-final first leg. Guardiola started with three teenagers in Augsburg, giving Bundesliga debuts to reserve team wing-backs Ylli Sallahi and Mitchell Weiser while Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg was named on the left wing. The gamble backfired when Weiser lost possession to Augsburg's Daniel Baier who fed Sascha Moelders and the  striker blasted his shot past Bayern's goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with 31 minutes gone to claim the winning goal. This was only Bayern's third defeat of the season in all competitions having already been confirmed Bundesliga champions ten days ago with a record seven games to spare.

With one eye on Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Manchester United, Guardiola started with three teenagers, giving Bundesliga debuts to wing-backs Ylli Sallahi and Mitchell Weiser while Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg was named on the left wing. The gamble backfired when Weiser lost possession to Augsburg's Daniel Baier who fed Sascha Moelders and the Augsburg striker blasted his shot past Bayern's goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with 31 minutes gone to claim the winning goal. ""Sooner or later we had to lose, we accept that and we have to prepare as quickly as possible for Manchester United,"" said head coach Guardiola. ""Next Wednesday is a final for us.

Having won the title with a record seven games to spare following their 3-1 win at Hertha Berlin ten days ago, Dante admits the European champions have suffered a slight dip. With the title already confirmed, Bayern were held to a 3-3 league draw at home to Hoffenheim last Saturday, then 1-1 at Old Trafford against Manchester United in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday. ""After winning the title in Berlin, things were a bit complicated, but I get the impression that we're back now and we will be at full throttle again,"" said Dante. The Brazilian was suspended for Old Trafford and is itching for his chance against Augsburg ahead of Wednesday's second leg against David Moyes' United. ""We're already champions, but we definitely won't go to Augsburg and give anything away,"" said Dante. ""It's a derby, we have to win for our fans."" Bayern will be without reserve left-back Diego Contento, who has damaged a ligament in his left ankle, meaning first-choice David Alaba is likely to start at Augsburg. Bayern are aiming to become the first team to go through a Bundesliga season unbeaten and are on a record undefeated league run of 53 German league matches, dating back to October 2012. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund host VfL Wolfsburg needing a confidence-boosting win ahead of Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg clash against Real Madrid having lost 3-0 in Spain in the first-leg. Dortmund will welcome back Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, who was suspended for the first leg in Madrid. ""First, we need to get a positive result against Wolfsburg on Saturday, and then we'll mobilise the troops for the return (against Real Madrid),"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. Wolfsburg have won their last two games and are just a point behind fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen, who are in danger of dropping out of the Champions League places completely for next season. Sami Hyypia's Leverkusen are at relegation-threatened Hamburg on Friday with the hosts second from bottom and with just six games left to avoid an historic first relegation from Germany's top flight.

The 31-year-old attacking midfielder has endured a torrid time having worked under three different coaches this season with Mirko Slomka currently in charge after both ex-Holland manager Bert van Marwijk and Thorsten Fink were dismissed. With seven goals in 23 league matches this season, play-maker Van der Vaart is struggling to help Hamburg with his creative skills largely going to waste as he racks up the mileage on the pitch trying to help his team, according to Cruyff. ""He is a very good footballer, but Hamburg is a problem for him, because he has to run a lot there and that's not his strength,"" the 66-year-old Cryuff told daily newspaper Hamburger Morgenpost with Hamburg second from bottom. ""His strength is playing creative football and it's not good that he plays in such a weak team."" Hamburg host fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen on Friday badly needed points having won just two of their last 15 league games. But Cryuff says Van der Vaart, who had stints at both Real Madrid and Tottenham Hostpur, can be a key figure for the Oranje under coach Louis van Gaal at June's World Cup with Chile, Australia and Spain joining the Netherlands in Group B. ""Holland need Van der Vaart, he has unique skills which we can't do without,"" said Cruyff."

Bosnia midfielder Sejad Salihovic curled in a 44th-minute free-kick to make it 3-2 at the break. Hoffenheim grabbed the crucial equaliser on 75 minutes when Brazilian left-wing Roberto Firmino darted onto a through ball and his shot beat both Bayern centre-back Dante and goalkeeper Tom Starke. Despite the draw, Bayern still remain 22 points clear in the table and extended their record unbeaten Bundesliga run to 53 matches. Germany winger Marco Reus netted a hat-trick as Borussia Dortmund fought back from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at ten-man VfB Stuttgart. Dortmund face Real Madrid away on Wednesday in the Champions League quarter-finals and some woeful defending left them 2-0 down after just 20 minutes. Stuttgart midfielders Christian Gentner and Martin Harnik took advantage with the guests' defence in disarray. Reus pulled one back with a superb finish on 30 minutes, then hit the equaliser when he converted a 68th-minute penalty after Stuttgart Georg Niedermeier was shown a red-card for bringing down Dortmund's Robert Lewandowski in the area. Reus saved his best for last when he completed his hat-trick with a long-range shot which took a deflection off defender Daniel Schwaab on 83 minutes.

Despite Bayern's massive 25-point lead in the table and their Champions League quarter-final trip to Manchester United looming next Tuesday, mid-table Hoffenheim hope to beat the Bavarians at the 11th attempt. ""Playing Bayern is the greatest task in Germany, well probably in Europe, that a team can face at the moment,"" said Hoffenheim's team director Alexander Rosen. ""However, we have decided we want to compete and can only hope Bayern popped too many Champagne bottles."" Hoffenheim captain Andreas Beck knows the challenge his side faces with Bayern on a record run of 19 consecutive league wins and are unbeaten in their last 52 Bundesliga matches dating back to October 2012. ""We're looking forward to the Bayern duel, but we know it will be unbelievably hard,"" said the 27-year-old Beck. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, who has already won three titles after just nine months in charge, has said they are aiming to become the first team to defend the Champions League title. The ambitious Bavarians also want to become the first team to go through a Bundesliga season unbeaten, having dropped just four points in two draws all season. Bayern will be at near full-strength, but Guardiola is expected to use his bench to rest his stars ahead of Tuesday's Old Trafford clash.

Second-from-bottom Stuttgart desperately need the three points to escape the relegation places, but Dortmund need a confidence-boosting win ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final at Real Madrid.

223,25/03/2014,02:15,Football: PSG ready for acid test of European ambitions,"When Qatar Sports Investments bought Paris Saint-Germain in 2011, they gave themselves five years to win the Champions League, but hopes are high in the French capital that they could get there ahead of schedule.","Having matched last season's achievement of reaching the quarter-finals of Europe's leading club competition, PSG are now preparing to face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea in this year's last eight next month. It will be the first true test of Laurent Blanc's side, who have not been suitably challenged domestically and have cruised through to this stage in Europe without having to play any of the continent's biggest names. PSG have lost just one league game since March last year and last Friday's 1-0 victory at Lorient allowed them to make it a club record eight wins on the bounce in all competitions. Under Blanc, they are 10 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 and are almost certain to retain the title won last year under Carlo Ancelotti. They have scored 70 goals in 30 league matches and Zlatan Ibrahimovic alone has 40 in all competitions, breaking the club record for the most goals in one campaign. But they are only doing what their enormous budget means they should be doing. In France, no other club can really compete financially -- not even Monaco -- and that gulf has translated onto the field. Two draws in two games against Monaco and a draw at home to third-placed Lille before Christmas suggest that it has not been a cakewalk, but even Blanc himself says that their domestic league is not enough of a challenge to prepare them for the pressures of Europe. Even there they have not been presented with a true test of their credentials, having cruised through a group containing the modest trio of Olympiakos, Benfica and Anderlecht before brushing aside a struggling Bayer Leverkusen. No wonder sports daily L'Equipe's front page headline asked if PSG were 'Ready For The Big Step Up' prior to the draw being made last Friday, and Chelsea will be just that. Possession is king for PSG, with Thiago Motta, Marco Verratti and Yohan Cabaye all available to Blanc in midfield, but Mourinho's side will be happy for their opponents to have the ball. Chelsea will also ask serious questions of a defence that has looked vulnerable at times in Europe this season - goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu was PSG's best player in the second leg against Leverkusen, and a fractured cheekbone suffered by captain Thiago Silva against Lorient is a cause for alarm. Silva and Ibrahimovic are the biggest influences in this PSG side and, at the age of 32, the latter is personally driven by the desire to win the biggest prize of all in club football having fallen short so many times before. In France, observers are confident of PSG's credentials, with 60 percent of those responding to a L'Equipe poll saying that Blanc's side would beat Chelsea, while Mourinho himself tried to claim at the weekend that PSG against his side. The financial incentive is certainly there for PSG, with the club's mega-rich owners offering a bonus of 1 million euros (Â£833,000, $1.38m) per player if they can win the trophy this year. But that might prove a step too far. After all, this season's quarter-final line-up is the strongest in recent memory, with all eight clubs advancing having won their groups. Six of the eight quarter-finalists have won the European Cup 23 times between them. Atletico Madrid have at least been to the final. ""There are teams who have a legitimacy in the Champions League in terms of experience that we don't have, but I think the consideration that our opponents have for us has increased,"" said Blanc recently, although PSG need only look to Chelsea if they doubt that patience might still be required even when throwing enormous of money chasing the dream. A decade ago, the London club were themselves new to this level and they reached the last eight or further seven times in 12 seasons before finally winning the trophy in 2012."
224,24/03/2014,18:26,Football: German clubs vote against goal-line technology,"Germany's top clubs on Monday announced they have emphatically voted to reject the introduction of goal-line technology, despite some controversial refereeing decisions here.","Only 12 of the 36 clubs in Germany's top two divisions voted in favour of technology, well short of the two thirds needed to bring it into Bundesliga football, with cost being cited as the main reason. ""Since the clubs have waived this resource, until further notice, this topic is finished as far as we're concerned,"" German Football League (DFL) president Reinhard Rauball said in a Frankfurt press conference. Goal-line technology has gained some support here especially after Bayer Leverkusen won 2-1 at Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga last October with a now infamous ""phantom goal"". Leverkusen's Stefan Kiessling winning header went into the goal via a hole in the side netting, but referee Felix Brych allowed it to stand. The English Premier League brought in ""Hawk-Eye"" technology at the start of the season and ""Goal Control"" will be used by FIFA referees at this June's World Cup in Brazil. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, chairman of European champions Bayern Munich, said it was an opportunity missed. ""Democratically, we have to accept it, but we regret the decision at FC Bayern,"" said Rummenigge. ""We will have to live with bad decisions in the future and there'll be no point harping on about it (goal-line technology) when that happens."" Herbert Fandel, chairman of the DFB's referee commission, said Germany's referees had wanted the technology to come in and hopes ""one or two"" clubs will now be less critical of future decisions. Thomas Tuchel, coach of Mainz 05, was bewildered by the decision. ""For me, it is incomprehensible that it's been rejected, I can't understand it,"" said the 40-year-old. And Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp said Germany should have followed England's example. ""If something is introduced, then it should be in all professional leagues,"" he said. ""If it's affordable and helps, then I am all for it."""

Bayern's 2-0 win at Mainz 05 on Saturday kept them a massive 23 points clear in the league and they will finally be uncatchable if they win at Hertha having dominated all season. ""There's obviously a great sense of anticipation,"" said Bayern's Austria left-back David Alaba. ""We know that we haven't achieved anything yet, so we'll be going there in a serious mood. ""We want to win the Bundesliga trophy as quickly as possible."" Bayern face an away leg at Manchester United on April 1 in the Champions League's quarter-finals and are eager to get the Bundesliga title wrapped up as quickly as possible to focus on Europe. Bayern are not expected to have too many problems at Berlin's Olympic Stadium with Hertha having lost their last two games and went down 3-0 at Borussia Moechengldabach on Saturday. There are considerable security concerns for Tuesday's Ruhr derby as second-placed Borussia Dortmund host Schalke 04, who are just a point behind in third. Dortmund are on a final warning from the German Football Association (DFB) and tensions are high with third-placed Schalke a point behind their rivals and violence has marred their recent meetings. Around 3,000 police officers are expected to be on duty on Tuesday in one of the biggest police operations for a German football match. Police say they expect around 500 violent fans from both teams while 90 individuals have already been banned. The DFB will be paying close attention having fined Borussia 60,000 euros (US$82,764) and threatened sanctions on Friday after Dortmund fans were involved in incidents at three separate league matches. Rioting broke out at last October's Ruhr derby in Gelsenkirchen at Schalke's Veltins Arena when a group of Dortmund fans stormed into an area of the ground for home fans. The DFB have told Dortmund they will have to play one league game with their famous South Stand empty if there is any more trouble from their fans in the next seven months. Sami Hyypia's fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen are at Augsburg on Wednesday looking for their first win since the start of February having lost eight of their last nine games.

Hyypia's side have failed to recover since Zlatan Ibrahimovic's Paris St German routed them 4-0 at home in mid-February and are in danger of slipping out of the German league's Champions League places. Mid-table Hoffenheim claimed a historic first win at Leverkusen when striker Anthony Modeste netted the 89th-minute winner. The guests took the lead at Leverkusen's BayArena when Bosnia striker Sejad Salihovic netted an early penalty, then Kevin Volland put them 2-1 up just 87 seconds after Stefan Kiessling had levelled for Bayer. Leverkusen captain Simon Rolfes equalised again for Leverkusen just after the break until Modeste converted a cross just before the final whistle. Earlier Eintracht Frankfurt pulled clear of the relegation battle with a 5-2 romp at ten-man Nuremberg, who remain deep in the Bundesliga's bottom three and had Argentina's Javier Pinola sent off. Frankfurt moved up to 12th and are six points from the bottom three after claiming only their third win in their last ten games. As 17 of the league's 18 teams, this was Nuremberg's fourth straight defeat. On Wednesday they face host fellow relegation-candidates VfB Stuttgart, who are just a point above them. On Saturday, Bayern's 2-0 win at Mainz 05 left them 23-points clear at the top with midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger and Germany team-mate Mario Goetze scoring late goals. European champions Bayern are poised to have their Bundesliga title confirmed on Tuesday with a record seven games left if they win at Hertha Berlin. Bayern fired in 23 shots on goal to Mainz's four as they extended their record unbeaten run to 51 Bundesliga matches to earn their 18th consecutive league win. Second-placed Dortmund, who made the Champions League quarter-finals in midweek despite a last-16 second leg home defeat to Zenit Saint Petersburg, enjoyed a 3-0 win at Hanover 96. Dortmund took control when centre-back Mats Hummels fired home just before the break then Poland striker Robert Lewandowski netted a spectacular second-half goal. There was nothing on when the 26-year-old, who joins Bayern next season, took the ball on the left wing, raced down the flank, cut inside and drilled his shot home despite the attention of five defenders. There was more good news for Klopp late on as Marco Reus celebrated his comeback from injury by scoring their third in added time having come off the bench. Schalke 04 bounced back from Tuesday's Champions League exit at Real Madrid with a 3-1 win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Teenage midfielder Leon Goretzka gave Schalke the lead when he fired home a long-range shot on 17 minutes. Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar claimed his 10th goal of the season when he fired home a direct free-kick 20 minutes from time to claim his sixth goal in his last three league games. Huntelaar's replacement Adam Szalai netted the Royal Blues third just before the final whistle after Benjamin Kessel scored Eintracht's consolation. Augsburg were held to a 1-1 draw at fifth-placed VfL Wolfsburg, who had ex-Chelsea midfielder Kevin de Bruyne sent off for a second yellow card. At the other end of the table, Stuttgart climbed out of the bottom three with a 1-0 win at home to 10-man Hamburg. Hamburg took Stuttgart's place in the bottom three, while new coach Huub Stevens enjoyed his first win in only his second game in charge as Stuttgart picked up their first win in ten games. Hamburg were reduced to ten men when Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu was shown a second yellow card, and the subsequent, red on 53 minutes. Stuttgart scored the winner when Romania midfielder Alexandru Maxim netted just six minutes after Guinea winger Ibrahima Traore put in a superb cross with 69 minutes gone."

Nuremberg midfielder Mike Frantz then turned the ball into his own net six minutes later. Hamburg's Germany goalkeeper Rene Adler pulled off a stunning save to deny Jose Campana's free-kick after Swiss striker Josip Drmic scored the guests' late consolation goal in added time. With Hamburg desperate to avoid their first relegation from Germany's top flight, Mirko Slomka replaced Bert van Marwijk as coach a month ago and saw his side climb to 14th. ""We've overtaken two teams now, which means nothing other than we now have something to defend -- namely, not being in the relegation places,"" said Slomka. Nuremberg drop to 15th while VfB Stuttgart, who drew 1-1 at Werder Bremen on Saturday under new coach Huub Stevens, find themselves second from bottom. Freiburg moved up to 16th, but stay in the relegation places, with a 4-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday as five points now separate the bottom five teams. At the top of the table, leaders Bayern Munich can be crowned champions next Saturday -- with a record eight games to spare -- as their 2-1 win at home to Bayer Leverkusen left them 23 points clear. The European champions will be confirmed as German champions for the 24th time if they win at Mainz next Saturday and rivals Dortmund and Schalke both draw. Goals by Mario Mandzukic and Bastian Schweinsteiger saw Bayern enjoy their 17th straight league win and extend their record unbeaten Bundesliga run to 50 matches. Former Germany striker Stefan Kiessling gave Leverkusen a consolation goal when he headed home just before the final whistle. The victory capped arguably the most turbulent week in Bayern's history after ex-president Uli Hoeness resigned on Friday, 24 hours after being convicted of tax fraud. He was sentenced to three-and-a-half years by Munich's regional court having defrauded the state of 28.5 million euros ($39.5 million) in unpaid taxes. Leverkusen were the last German team to beat Bayern, back in October 2012, but Sami Hyypia's side offered little resistance as they suffered their seventh defeat in eight matches. They had already dropped to fourth after being knocked from third by Schalke's 2-1 win at Augsburg on Friday when Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored both goals. Bayern's relentless march to the title was helped after second-placed Borussia Dortmund suffered a 2-1 defeat at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach earlier on Saturday. Gladbach earned their first win in ten games to dent Dortmund's confidence ahead of Wednesday's Champions League last 16 clash at home to Zenit St Petersburg when they hold a 4-2 lead from the first leg. Dortmund are now just one point clear of third-placed Schalke ahead of the Ruhr Valley derby on March 25. Swiss coach Lucien Favre extended his Gladbach contract last week until 2017 and his side produced a devastating first-half spell with two goals in nine  minutes at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. Brazilian striker Raffael wrong-footed Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller on 31 minutes, then Max Kruse fired home five minutes before the break. Gladbach midfielder Havard Nordtveit was sent off for a second yellow card for the final 20 minutes and new-signing Milos Jojic pulled one back for Dortmund on 77 minutes. Mainz moved up to fifth with a sensational 4-2 victory at Hoffenheim with Japan's Shinji Okazaki netting their last two goals as the guests scored three times in seven stunning second-half minutes to come from 2-0 down. The win keeps Thomas Tuchel's Mainz in the hunt for a European spot next season and are only three points short of a Champions League berth. Wolfsburg drop to sixth after their 1-1 draw at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig as only three points separate the bottom four clubs including Freiburg, Hamburg and Stuttgart. Hertha's European aspirations suffered a setback as they lost 2-0 at home to Hanover 96 to stay ninth and four points off the top six."

232,16/03/2014,02:10,Football: Bayern plan to welcome Hoeness back after jail,"Despite his conviction for tax fraud, Bayern Munich are planning to welcome back ex-president Uli Hoeness after he has served his prison sentence.","The 62-year-old resigned as both Bayern president and chairman of the club's supervisory board on Friday and was a noticeable absentee for Saturday's 2-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen. He stepped down less than 24 hours after being sentenced to three and a half years in jail by Munich regional court having cheated the state out of 28.5 million euros ($39.5 million) in unpaid taxes. He admitted to hiding his wealth in secret Swiss bank accounts while obsessively ""gambling"" on stock and currency markets for years. But while Hoeness waits to start his time behind bars, the Bavarian giants already hope he will be back at the Allianz Arena soon. ""This club is one of the best in the world and that is down to the personality of Uli Hoeness,"" said coach Pep Guardiola. ""He deserves our respect. I hope he can come back in the future and help us."" On Saturday, Bayern named Karl Hopfner as Hoeness' successor as club president. Adidas' CEO Herbert Hainer, the CEO of German sportswear giants Adidas, takes over from Hoeness as chairman of Bayern's advisory board. Both positions must be ratified by a vote on May 2 at the club's general assembly. But Edmund Stoiber, head of Bayern's management board, implied there will be a role for Hoeness with the European champions following his release. ""A door is always open and Uli Hoeness will always be the soul of the club,"" Stoiber told Die Welt. ""Whatever he wants to do, anything is possible."" Hoeness's fall from grace comes with the club he built on the ascendancy and confirmed as the world's best domestic side after winning the Club World Cup last December. There has been zero condemnation from within the tight-knit Bayern camp, even after the guilty verdict. Chants of ""Hoeness - you're the best man!"" could be heard at Munich's Allianz Arena during the win over Leverkusen. Sky television underscored his absence when zooming in on the empty seat next to chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge where Hoeness normally sits and there were a few banners of support from fans. ""His resignation deserves the respect from FC Bayern and from all football fans,"" said Rummenigge. ""I am not a fan of the saying, 'the king is dead, long live the king', more of Franz Beckenbauer's sentiment that 'you never separate from good friends'. ""It's very hard to replace someone like Uli Hoeness at the top of the club."" The club's stance has always been that the tax matters were personal choices made by Hoeness, unconnected to his work as an employee. His conviction tarnishes the image of his beloved Bayern, even if the club's success is directly entwined with Hoeness' drive. All five of Bayern's European titles in 1974, 1975, 1976, 2001 and 2013 came with him involved as either a player, general manager or club president. Before his arrival as an 18-year-old in 1970, they had won just two of their 23 German league titles with a 24th imminent. Bayern became Germany's first side to win the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup under Jupp Heynckes last season, breaking or equalling 25 league records. Hoeness was instrumental in luring Heynckes's successor Guardiola to Munich and Bayern have thrived this season under the Spaniard. Hoeness will not start his sentence for a few weeks while the verdict is finalised with the prosecution able to appeal having wanted a longer sentence. As a first-time offender, Hoeness is most likely to serve his sentence in Landsberg prison, 60 kilometres east of Munich. It is the same jail where Adolf Hitler wrote his novel 'Mein Kampf' in 1924 while serving 264 days detention for his part in the previous year's Munich Beer Hall Putsch. A spokesperson for Munich's regional court has said Hoeness could qualify for day release after just a few weeks of his sentence. In his absence, his successful sausage-making factory will be run by his son Florian. Bayern's 24th German league title could be confirmed next Saturday if they win at Mainz 05 and both rivals Dortmund and Schalke draw, but Hoeness may already be behind bars. ""It's a very tough situation for FC Bayern, for Uli Hoeness and his family,"" said France winger Franck Ribery following the win over Leverkusen. ""We want to keep winning for him. ""It's a difficult situation, but we have to keep going forward. ""He's a big figure and he will always be with us."""

237,15/03/2014,13:20,Football: Hopfner to succeed Hoeness as Bayern president,"Bayern Munich on Saturday named their financial mastermind Karl Hopfner as successor to disgraced president Uli Hoeness, who was convicted this week of tax fraud.","The European champions' board of directors voted unanimously to name Hopfner, the current vice president, to head the Bavarian giants. His appointment will be put to a vote at a meeting of the club's general assembly on May 2. Runaway Bundesliga leaders Bayern start the weekend 20 points clear at the top of the table and host Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday at the Allianz Arena looking to make it a remarkable 50 league games unbeaten. But, behind the scenes, the Bavarians have endured arguably the most turbulent week in the club's history. Hopfner's promotion comes in the wake of his predecessor's fall from grace as Hoeness resigned on Friday having been sentenced to three and a half years in prison for major tax fraud. Munich regional court heard how he cheated the state out of 28.5 million euros ($39.5 million) in what he described as ""the mistake of my life"". Having been convicted on Thursday, Hoeness will start his sentence at Landsberg Prison near Munich, where Adolf Hitler wrote his 1924 novel 'Mein Kampf' after the Munich Beer Hall Putsch. With more than 30 years service to the club, Hopfner takes over as the figurehead having been credited with making Bayern one of Europe's richest teams. Herbert Hainer, the CEO of German sportswear giants Adidas, succeeds Hoeness as chairman of Bayern's advisory board. ""We are convinced that the proposed team can continue the growth of the club,"" said Edmund Stoiber, head of Bayern's management board. Last November, Bayern posted a record turnover of 432.8 million euros for the 2012/13 season when they won the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup titles. In 2011, German football magazine '11 Freunde' dubbed Hoeness, chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Hopfner as the 'Bayern triumvirate'. While Hopfner has rarely enjoyed the media limelight like ex-West Germany internationals Hoeness and Rummenigge, both credit him with turning the club into a financial powerhouse. He joined Bayern in July 1983 as managing director, having seen the job advertised in Munich-based newspaper the Sueddeutsche Zeitung. The 61-year-old eventually oversaw the club's transition to a joint-stock company (AG) in 2001 before taking a seat on the board. Bayern's honorary president Franz Beckenbauer described him as a ""financial genius"" for taking the club out of debt. Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger admitted ""arguing with Hopfner is always a huge struggle"" when it comes to contract negotiations."

But the club is in turmoil after Hoeness resigned as both president and chairman of the advisory board on Friday after being sentenced to three and a half years in jail on Thursday, The 62-year-old, who won the 1974 World Cup with West Germany, cheated the German state out of 28.5 million euros ($39.5 million) of taxes. ""Tax evasion was the mistake of my life,"" Hoeness said in a statement on the Bayern website. ""I want to avert harm to my club. ""Bayern Munich is my life's work and always will be. ""I will stay committed to this great club and its people as long as I live."" Having been the driving force behind the Champions League holders since joining them as an 18-year-old in 1970, Hoeness played a huge part in turning them into a European powerhouse. Bayern have won 21 of their 23 German league titles and all five of their European Cup or Champions League victories with him involved either as a player, club manager or president. Leverkusen have problems of their own and last won on February 7, losing six of their last seven matches. Third-placed Bayer were knocked out of the Champions League's last 16 on Wednesday when they lost 2-1 at Paris Saint-Germain after being drubbed 4-0 at home.

The Germany winger, who is suffering with a leg injury, has been off-form of late and last scored in December's 2-1 defeat to Hertha Berlin. While Dortmund have won their last three games to regain second in the table, Gladbach have slumped to eighth and are winless in their last nine games. Coach Lucien Favre signed a contract extension on Wednesday and the Foals have agreed a transfer with an unnamed club for Germany goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen.

Leverkusen captain Simon Rolfes had a penalty saved before Ezequiel Lavezzi put PSG in front eight minutes into the second period, and the sending-off of Emre Can saw the visitors bow out with 10 men. ""We prepared well for this match but were mediocre at the start,"" bemoaned PSG coach Laurent Blanc. ""But paradoxically the Bayer goal woke us up a bit too. PSG were clearly not brilliant tonight. I expected more, but the essential is there, we are through."" Meanwhile, Leverkusen coach Sami Hyypia had praise for his team despite seeing them lose for the sixth time in their last seven matches. ""I'm feeling a bit sorry for the team that we didn't get anything from the game,"" he said. ""The starting point was difficult after losing 4-0 at home but we can take a lot of confidence for the future."" No team had ever been eliminated from a European knock-out tie after winning 4-0 away in the first leg and Blanc made the most of his side's comfortable cushion by rotating his squad, as Thiago Motta and Alex dropped to the bench. Blaise Matuidi was rested altogether to avoid the risk of incurring a suspension for the next round. It was still a strong PSG line-up, with Edinson Cavani starting for the first time in over a month after injury but, perhaps understandably, there was an air of complacency about the hosts early on, and Leverkusen took full advantage. A low long-range strike by Can that was pushed around the post by Salvatore Sirigu served as a warning to the Ligue 1 leaders, although it was not heeded, and the visitors opened the scoring in the sixth minute. A lovely move started by Rolfes on the left saw Gonzalo Castro spread the play to Giulio Donati on the right flank, and the Italian's cross was headed home by Sam at the back post. If that raised hopes among the boisterous travelling support that their team could pull off the most improbable of comebacks, then those hopes were short-lived, as the equaliser on the night came just seven minutes later. After Bernd Leno saved from Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Yohan Cabaye's resulting corner from the right was met by a thumping Marquinhos header that the German 'keeper could only help on its way into the net. It was the young Brazilian defender's third goal in this season's Champions League and the hosts almost went on to take the lead shortly after but Ibrahimovic clipped his shot against the crossbar after a Cavani pass left him with just the keeper to beat. Leverkusen's recent form had increased the pressure on Hyypia, but they played some nice football in the first period and were handed the opportunity to retake the lead in the 28th minute. When Christophe Jallet pulled back Eren Derdiyok inside the area, Croatian referee Ivan Bebek did not hesitate in pointing to the spot, and yet Rolfes saw his effort from 12 yards kept out as Sirigu made a great save diving low to his left. Leno saved from Cavani at the other end shortly before the interval and PSG then took the lead eight minutes into the second period as Lucas Digne's low ball from the left was fired low into the net by Lavezzi, for whom it was a fifth goal in his last six games. The visitors were reduced to 10 men when Can was shown a second yellow card for diving midway through the second half, but they were spared greater punishment in the closing stages."

245,12/03/2014,00:28,Football: Wenger slams Robben as Arsenal exit Europe,Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger blamed Wojciech Szczesny's first-leg red card for the Gunners' Champions League last 16 exit and slammed Arjen Robben for provoking the red card as the Gunners bowed out at Bayern Munich.,"Holders Bayern Munich booked their place in the Champions League's quarter-finals, despite Arsenal earning a 1-1 draw in Bavaria in Tuesday's last 16, second-leg clash. A second-half Bastian Schweinsteiger goal gave Bayern a brief lead before Arsenal's Lukas Podolski equalised with a thunderbolt of a shot as the tie finished 3-1 on aggregate. Arsenal failed to overturn their 2-0 deficit from the first leg three weeks ago, which still riles Wenger. The Gunners finished with ten men in London after Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli sent off Gunners goalkeeper Szczesny for conceding a spot-kick with a foul on Robben. ""Overall in the two games what made the difference was the decision to send our goalkeeper off,"" said Wenger. ""I felt it was not a red card as simple as that. ""Robben is very good at getting something out of nothing, he's a good diver, but that's part of his game. ""I have to congratulate the (Arsenal) players for their heart and effort. ""We wanted to come out of that tie qualified, but we came up short. ""Good luck to Bayern, but I think they are a bit more vulnerable than last season."" Robben angrily rebuked Wenger's diving claims. ""I expect more of great managers, they don't need to resort to claims like that,"" said the Dutch winger. ""I don't want to have to defend myself against remarks like that."" Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil, who failed to convert a crucial penalty in the first-leg, endured another miserable night in Munich. The Germany attacking midfielder came off at half-time with hamstring trouble and made way for Tomas Rosicky. ""Ozil has a hamstring injury and it looks quite serious,"" revealed Wenger. ""He will miss (Sunday's) Tottenham game for sure, he needs a scan. He's out for at least a few weeks."" Holders Bayern march onto the quarter-finals, but will be without Brazil defender Dante who picked up his third yellow card in Europe and is now suspended for the first leg. Bayern boss Pep Guardiola was pleased that his side restricted Arsenal's scoring chances -- only a Olivier Giroud header and Podolski's thunderbolt truly troubled the hosts defence. But Bayern's honorary president Franz Beckenbauer criticised the holders for a lack of creativity. ""In the end, it'll be like Barca: unwatchable. They will pass the ball back even on the goal-line,"" moaned the former West Germany World Cup winning captain and coach. But Guardiola, whose side are looking to go 50 Bundesliga games unbeaten against Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, had a different take. ""We were able to minimise our errors, we played intelligently and at a very high level, I am very satisfied,"" said the Spaniard. ""Arsenal had a chance in the first half, but we wanted to control the game and we succeeded. ""Apart from the goal, which might have been whistled as a foul, but nothing happened."" Podolski shoved Bayern captain Philipp Lahm off the ball before his second-half equaliser, but the Germany star said his challenge was legitimate. ""The ref didn't blow his whistle, so the matter is closed,"" said Podolski. ""We can discuss these little aspects over and over again, but at the end of the day, we are out. ""It's always difficult coming back from 2-0 down against one of the best teams in the world. ""Their second goal in the first-leg killed us a bit. ""We're out and now we need to focus on the Premier League and Cup."""

Leverkusen face a near-impossible task in the return leg at PSG's Parc des Princes, but Hyypia is determined that his side will play with their heads high. ""We won't just throw away the game, otherwise I would have sent the Under-23 squad,"" insisted the 40-year-old ex-Liverpool defender. ""This is a great opportunity for one or two players to show what they can do."" Bayer face a tough week as they follow their trip to Paris with an away match at runaway Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday, who are on a 49-match unbeaten league run. Hyypia has endured a nightmare month since his side last tasted victory with a 1-0 league win at Borussia Moenchengladbach on February 7. Since then they suffered a shock German Cup defeat at home to second-division Kaiserslautern which triggered a five-match losing streak and included the PSG debacle. Only Saturday's 1-1 draw at Hanover 96 stopped the rot, but they have dropped to third in the Bundelsiga and now trail second-placed Borussia Dortmund by four points. Further defeats could see Leverkusen drop out of the Champions League berths. ""This is a good challenge for us to show we are strong,"" insisted Hyypia, who is in his debut season as a head coach. ""My coaching career is not very long and this is the first time that I'm stuck in such a situation. ""Of course I've asked many people for advice as to what I can do. ""I want to develop myself and without this situation that development would progress slower."" At PSG, Hyypia will be without Germany midfielder Lars Bender, who has a leg injury, but should be back to face Bayern. Midfielder Jens Hegeler suffered a torn ankle ligament at Hanover and will likely miss the rest of the season. Centre-back Emir Spahic is suspended after being sent off in the first leg. Winger Gonzalo Castro is set to fill Bender's defensive midfielder role, while 17-year-old Julian Brandt is set to start at right-back."

Ribery, UEFA's best player in Europe last season, has not played for Bayern in more than a month after an operation on his buttocks, but made an appearance for France on Wednesday. ""I felt good, those few minutes against the Netherlands were good to get some match practice back. I'm ready,"" said Ribery after France enjoyed a 2-0 win over the Dutch. Bayern are looking to extend their record unbeaten league run to 49 matches and to claim their 11th consecutive victory. Fifth-placed Wolfsburg were hammered 6-2 at Hoffenheim last Sunday and Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer expects a backlash at the Volkswagen Arena. ""They suffered a setback in Hoffenheim and they will try and show a reaction, so we must have a few answers to that,"" said Sammer. With a 20-point lead, Bayern could even wrap up the Bundesliga title before the end of the month. Coach Pep Guardiola will want a convincing win before Tuesday's Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Arsenal with the hosts leading 2-0 from the first-leg in London. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund head to Freiburg on Sunday with a shortage of strikers. Poland's Robert Lewandowski sat out Wednesday's international against Scotland with a knee strain and Under-23 striker Marvin Ducksch is out for a fortnight with an ankle injury. It leaves Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp with only reserve striker Julian Schieber fit, but Germany winger Marco Reus could be switched to play up front. Bayer Leverkusen coach Sami Hyypia is enduring the first crisis of his career after five straight defeats as they look for a first victory in seven years at Hanover 96 on Saturday. ""My coaching career has not been very long and this is the first time that I'm in such a situation,"" said the 40-year-old ex-Liverpool defender. ""Of course, I have spoken to many people to ask advice on what I could do. ""I want to develop myself and I wouldn't be learning so fast if we weren't in this situation."" Hyypia is hoping to have defensive midfielder Sven Bender back after a dead leg. Schalke 04 are looking to bounce back from successive horror defeats when they host Hoffenheim. The Royal Blues were drubbed 6-1 by Real Madrid in the Champions League, then crashed 5-1 at Bayern last Sunday in the Bundesliga. ""We have to look forward now and give the right response on the pitch against Hoffenheim,"" said coach Jens Keller. Peru winger Jefferson Farfan is doubtful with an inflamed knee while centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos is definitely out after being sent off in Munich. At the other end of the table, VfB Stuttgart coach Thomas Schneider must avoid a ninth straight defeat when his side host bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Schneider came close to being dismissed after Sunday's 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt and another loss would surely mean the 41-year-old being fired, despite having only taken charge in August. Schneider has the fans' backing as the Mercedes Benz Arena will be sold out for only the second time this season.

With 100 days to go before the World Cup, Loew has voiced concerns with several first-choice players returning from injury and he said his final squad will be based solely on current form. ""On paper, we have a top team, but the reality is a bit different at the moment,"" said Loew, whose side won nine and drew one of their 10 qualifiers.

We have to get everything in line to be successful. ""We have the chance to work on solutions and alternatives to various problems. ""So we have decided to look at a few new faces who have been consistently good for their clubs."" Loew has called up the uncapped quartet of Sampdoria centre-back Shkodran Mustafi, Augsburg midfielder Andre Hahn, Freiburg centre-back Matthias Ginter and Hamburg striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga. Centre-back is the key position where Loew needs depth with first-choice Mats Hummels only just returning from injury and set to partner Bayern's Jerome Boateng. Likewise, midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has only just returned after ankle surgery, then a knee injury. With Real Madrid's Sami Khedira facing a race against time to be fit for the World Cup after a knee injury, Loew will switch captain Philipp Lahm to partner Schweinsteiger in the defensive midfield against Chile. Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Lars Bender has dropped out with a dead leg and Loew hopes veteran striker Miroslav Klose will start. The 35-year-old is set to become Germany's all-time top-scorer having equalled Gerd Mueller's record of 68 goals in the white shirt, but he sat out Lazio's 1-0 Serie A win against Fiorentina on Sunday with a strained abdominal muscle. Chile will certainly have taken heart from Paraguay's 3-3 draw with Germany last August when the south Americans took an early 2-0 lead after hitting the hosts on the counter-attack before the Germans fought back. Jorge Sampaoli's Chile has been drawn in Group B along with Australia, Spain and the Netherlands at the World Cup. Midfielder Arturo Vidal, who used to play in the Bundesliga for Bayer Leverkusen, has said the south Americans are coming to Stuttgart to shock the hosts. Having qualified third in the South American qualifying group behind Argentina and Colombia, Chile demand respect. ""This is our last test match before the World Cup and we are coming to win it,"" the 26-year-old Juventus midfielder told Sport Bild. ""We attack early, we like to play and we run a lot. ""We play a bit like Borussia Dortmund did last season in the Champions League. ""We have a tough group at the World Cup, but we can be a big surprise and we have never had a bigger chance."""
249,02/03/2014,23:02,Football: Cavani scores on return as PSG defeat Marseille,Paris Saint-Germain continued their relentless quest to retain the Ligue 1 crown on Sunday as they overcame bitter rivals Marseille 2-0 at the Parc des Princes to move eight points clear.,"Laurent Blanc's side notched up their 19th win in 27 outings, against just one defeat, as they rode second half goals from Brazilian left-back Maxwell and Uruguayan Edinson Cavani to see off Jose Anigo's side. Ligue 1 top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic released former Inter Milan and Barcelona defender Maxwell on 50 minutes and the Brazilian international calmly placed the ball beyond Steve Mandanda in the visitors' goal. Blanc's men locked up shop following the goal and rarely gave Marseille a clear cut chance as they extended their record to 16 wins and three draws after opening the scoring. Cavani, who came on as a second-half substitute after a month out injured, then sent the Paris faithful into raptures with a powerful headed finish with 11 minutes remaining to put the gloss on a fine evening's work. ""It was very hard to be out injured for a month so I'm very happy tonight,"" Cavani told Canal Plus TV following the match. ""It was a great goal and I just want to thank my teammates and to thank God for allowing me to come back tonight and score,"" he added. Following second-placed Monaco's 2-0 reverse at Saint-Etienne on Saturday, PSG are red hot favourites to retain the title they won last season for the first time since 1994. The capital club also play Lyon in the French League Cup final and stand on the brink of the Champions League quarter-finals after thrashing Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 in the first leg of their last-16 tie in Germany. Earlier on Sunday, Lille's Ivory Coast international Salomon Kalou fired a hat-trick to lift the northern French club past Ajaccio 3-2 in Corsica and back into third spot. The former Chelsea striker cancelled out compatriot Junior Tallo's shock first minute opener to level the match from the penalty spot on 25 minutes before scoring again seven minutes before half-time to put the visitors ahead. Tallo levelled the match for the basement dwellers, who have won just two games all season, just before half-time before Kalou completed his hat-trick, again from the penalty spot, 16 minutes from time to give Rene Girard's side three crucial points. ""It's really a miracle that we won tonight,"" said Girard. ""It was crucial to get third place back. Saint-Etienne have come back strong the last five matches and we have been battling for results for some time. ""The only thing positive from this match is the three points and we're going to have to show a lot more in the coming weeks to keep our position."" Lille now have 49 points, one ahead of Saint-Etienne in the race for third place and the final Champions League spot. Ajaccio remain rooted to the foot of the table 13 points adrift of safety, and looking increasingly doomed to playing second division football next season. Elsewhere, Lyon were held up in their bid to gatecrash the top three with a 0-0 home draw against Montpellier. In a match that lacked inspiration for the neutrals, Remi Garde's men moved into a tie for sixth with Reims but remain seven points back of third-placed Lille. Montpellier, the 2012 champions under Lille coach Girard, continue to ease away from the relegation zone under Rolland Courbis and are now joint 11th with Lorient and 11 points above the drop zone."

251,02/03/2014,19:36,Football: Hoffenheim dent Wolfsburg's top four hopes,VfL Wolfsburg's hopes of breaking into the Bundesliga's top four suffered a setback on Sunday after being drubbed 6-2 at mid-table Hoffenheim.,"Wolfsburg finished the match with 10 men as German international Christian Traesch was sent off. Dieter Hecking's Wolves had hoped for three points in Hoffenheim to take fourth spot from Schalke 04, who were routed at runaway league leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday. Dutch striker Bas Dost had equalised for Wolves with 15 minutes gone after Roberto Firmino's fourth-minute strike gave Hoffenheim the lead, but the hosts responded with three goals. Hoffenheim led 4-1 at the break as defender Niklas Suele netted before French striker Anthony Modeste scored two goals in four minutes. Croatia forward Ivan Perisic pulled a goal back for Wolves with 15 minutes left. But the visitors had right-back Traesch sent off for a foul in the area and Hoffenheim's Sejad Salihovic netted the penalty before Modeste's replacement Sven Schipplock hit their sixth. Wolfsburg's result leaves them fifth. It means all three teams immediately behind leaders Bayern Munich and second-placed Borussia Dortmund, who beat Nuremberg 3-0 on Saturday, suffered defeats over the weekend. VfB Stuttgart are fourth from bottom after losing 2-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt in what was a club record eighth straight defeat and heaped further pressure on coach Thomas Schneider. Stuttgart striker Martin Harnik's first-half goal was cancelled out by Eintracht midfielder Jan Rosenthal ten minutes from time before captain Alexander Meier hit the 89th-minute winner. On Saturday, an Arjen Robben hat-trick saw Bayern open a 20-point lead at the top of the table with a 5-1 win over ten-man Schalke 04. The Royal Blues suffered a second drubbing in four days after losing 6-1 to Real Madrid in Wednesday's Champions League clash. Bayern extended their record unbeaten league run to 48 matches, dating back to October 2012, and earned their 15th straight league victory. Bayern raced into a 4-0 lead inside half-an-hour as left-back David Alaba netted a free-kick, then Robben scored either side of Mario Mandzukic's header. Schalke were gifted a goal when Jefferson Farfan's corner was turned into his own net by Munich right-back Rafinha, in for captain Philipp Lahm, with 25 minutes left. To compound Schalke's misery, Greece centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos was shown a straight red for bringing down Mandzukic in the area. His foul allowed Robben to wrap up his hat-trick with a 77th-minute penalty. Coach Pep Guardiola flippantly told reporters ""don't ask me about the title"" in broken German on Friday, but with 11 league games left, Bayern can wrap up their 24th German league title by the end of March. Dortmund went second after their comfortable win over Nuremberg as Germany defender Mats Hummels netted on his return after four weeks out with a foot injury. Poland star Robert Lewandowski scored his 15th league goal of the season before Henrikh Mkhitaryan netted their third seven minutes from time. Bayer Leverkusen's dreadful form continued with their fourth straight home defeat as they lost 1-0 at home to Mainz, who moved up to sixth with their fifth win in eight games. Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting slammed home the winner past goalkeeper Bernd Leno on 37 minutes as Leverkusen suffered their eighth defeat in ten games to drop to third. Curiously, both goalkeepers scored own goals as Borussia Moenchengladbach, who are winless in their last eight games, were held to a 1-1 draw at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig."

258,28/02/2014,02:15,Football: Schalke head to buoyant Bayern after Real rout,"Fresh from their record European defeat at home to Real Madrid, Schalke 04 face another potential drubbing when they travel to all-conquering Bayern Munich on Saturday.","Schalke were routed 6-1 in Gelsenkirchen on Wednesday as Real's stars ran riot with Karem Benzema, Gareth Bale and Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo each netting two goals. ""We have no choice, but to write off the game,"" said Schalke midfielder Julian Draxler in the wake of the Real debacle. ""We have to get it out of our heads and prepare for Bayern."" Ronaldo finished with ten shots on goal, the same as the entire Schalke team. The Royal Blues now face an equally tough challenge at Bayern, who have won all of their last 14 games and are on a record 47-match unbeaten run. ""They (Bayern) are even better than Real, but we're not just going there to limit the damage,"" said Schalke's director of sport Horst Heldt. Bayern's 4-0 romp at Hanover 96 last Sunday left Pep Guardiola's European champions 19-points clear at the top of the table. If they maintain their lead, their 24th German league title can be confirmed by the end of March at the latest and they have dropped just four points all season. They are on course to become the first Bundesliga side to complete a season unbeaten. In contrast, Schalke's Real debacle was the worst home defeat by a German side in Champions League history and has had a physical effect, as well as battering their confidence. Both centre-back Felipe Santana and central midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng are ruled out with leg injuries. Left-back Sead Kolasinac has a bruised jaw and defensive midfielder Roman Neustaedter has a knee injury. ""It makes no sense to use ailing players, so others will have to get involved,"" said Heldt with a host of changes expected. Bayern are set to welcome back left wing Xherdan Shaqiri while Franck Ribery continues to recover from buttocks surgery. Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger is set to make his second start after back-to-back injuries. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund host Nuremberg on Saturday with concerns at centre-back. Greece defender Sokratis is nursing a foot injury from their 4-2 Champions League last 16, first-leg win at Zenit St Petersburg. Coach Jurgen Klopp is without both his first-choice centre backs. Mats Hummels is on the verge of returning from an ankle knock while Neven Subotic is out for the season with a torn knee ligament. Bayer Leverkusen are second in the table, but low on confidence as they host resurgent Mainz 05 after a horror sequence of seven losses in nine games. Following the shock German Cup defeat at home to second-division Kaiserslautern, Bayer were routed 4-0 at home to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, then crashed 3-1 at Wolfsburg last weekend in the league. ""They have been the worst ten days,"" admitted striker Stefan Kiessling. Leverkusen will be without winger Gonzalo Castro and defender Emir Spahic who are both suspended. Mainz are ninth, but closing in on a top six place after losing just one of their last eight games. There is a relegation battle brewing in the north German derby when strugglers Werder Bremen host Hamburg, who are third from bottom. Hamburg's new coach Mirko Slomka made his debut in last Saturday's shock 3-0 win at home to Borussia Dortmund which broke their run of eight straight defeats. Bremen are winless in their last 11 matches and have just one victory from their last 11 matches. Playing Friday (All times 1430 GMT unless stated) Hertha Berlin v Freiburg (1930)"

Madrid are unbeaten in 26 games in all competitions and moved three points clear at the top of La Liga - the first time they have led the table since May 2012. Schalke are eight matches undefeated themselves, but could only manage a goalless draw at home against Mainz in the Bundesliga on Friday. However, they will draw encouragement from the fact that Madrid have won just once in 25 previous visits to face German opposition and were hammered 4-1 by the Royal Blues' Ruhr rivals Borussia Dortmund last season. Coaches: Schalke - Jens Keller (GER) -- 43 yrs Real Madrid - Carlo Ancelotti (ITA) -- 54 yrs Leading scorers in all competitions: Schalke - Jefferson Farfan (11 goals) Real Madrid - Cristiano Ronaldo (34 goals) Domestic league performance: Schalke - Fourth in the Bundesliga, two points behind Bayer Leverkusen in second but 21 points behind leaders Bayern Munich Real Madrid - Top of La Liga, three points clear of Barcelona and Atletico Madrid Group stage performances: Schalke - Second in Group E behind Chelsea Real Madrid - Winners of Group B ahead of Galatasaray European Cup/Champions League best performances: Schalke - semi-finals 2010/11 Real Madrid - winners 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002 Other honours: Schalke - 7 x German champions (none in Bundesliga era), 5 x German Cup winners, 1 x UEFA Cup winners Real Madrid - 32 x Spanish champions, 18 x Copa del Rey winners, 2 x UEFA Cup winners, 1 x European Super Cup winners, 3 x Intercontinental Cup winners Previous meetings: None"

""We know the Champions League is a big competition with all the best teams in it, so we know it is going to be difficult,"" said the 24-year-old Wales winger. ""I think we are ready, we believe we can win every game so we'll go over there and hopefully come back with the win."" The Spanish league leaders are unbeaten in 26 games in all competitions, dating back to last October, and are clear favourites against the Royal Blues of Gelsenkirchen, who are fourth in the Bundesliga. But Madrid have prevailed just once in 24 previous away matches against German opposition, losing 17 times, including a 4-1 drubbing at Borussia Dortmund in last season's semi-final first leg when Robert Lewandowski hit all four goals. That said, Schalke's form this season has been erratic and they have won only five of their last 11 home encounters against Spanish opponents, suffering four defeats. Madrid will be able to call on the firepower of Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who returns from a three-game ban. The injury doubts are left-backs Marcelo and Fabio Coentrao as neither played in the 3-0 win against Elche on Saturday, so Alvaro Arbeloa could deputise if neither are fit. Luka Modric and Sergio Ramos are also expected to return after being suspended and rested respectively at the weekend. Schalke were denied a fifth straight league win when they were held to a goalless draw at home to Mainz on Friday. There was good news, though, for Schalke as Arsenal-target Julian Draxler came off the bench to make his return after two months out with a foot injury. ""As a young boy you dream about facing teams like Real Madrid so we're all really up for it,"" said the 20-year-old. ""I'm happy to be back out on the pitch, but I think I'm still some way off my best form. ""That was the first lengthy lay-off of my career, so I'm a bit impatient, but I know I need more time."" Teenager Leon Goretzka has said the hosts are looking for an upset at the Veltins Arena. ""We're looking forward to the highlight in the Champions League,"" said the 19-year-old. ""We'll do everything in our power to cause an upset."" Goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann has said Schalke are relishing the role of underdogs. ""Sometimes we find it easier when we don't really have to take the game to our opponents,"" he said. ""We need to stay compact and wait for our chances. ""You always get a chance in a match and when we do we need to take it. ""We aren't favourites, of course, but we hope to take advantage of our underdog role to spring a surprise."" Coach Jens Keller, who hopes to have captain and centre-back Benedikt Hoewedes fit, has said Schalke will not be intimidated by star-studded Real. ""We want to pull off a small miracle. We're not just going out there to swap shirts with Real's stars,"" said Keller defiantly, referring to Bayer Leverkusen's drubbing by Real's Spanish rivals Barcelona at the same stage in the competition two years ago. Leverkusen were beaten 3-1 at home in the last 16, then thrashed 7-1 in Barcelona, but not before Bayer players Michal Kadlec and Manuel Friedrich had argued over who would swap shirts with Barcelona star Lionel Messi."

Jurgen Klopp's side were excellent in winning Group F ahead of Arsenal and yet have not been able to challenge runaway leaders Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga this season. Their inconsistent domestic form was highlighted on    Saturday as they slipped to their first defeat of 2014, 3-0 to a previously totally out of form Hamburg side. Fortunately for them Zenit may be a little rusty having not played a competitive game since the Russian Premier League signed off in December for its winter break.

Their main domestic rivals did little to disprove Guardiola's point as Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke picked up just a point between them over the weekend. ""It took a while for the players to find their rhythm, but we played well after the first goal,"" said Guardiola. ""We had the opportunity to extend our lead and the boys took it."" The Bavarian giants extended their record unbeaten run to 47 Bundesliga matches, dating back to October 2012, to strengthen their iron grip on what will be their 24th German league title, baring a miracle. Having won last season's league title with a record six games to spare, Bayern are on course to break their own best mark. Hanover offered little resistance as Germany winger Thomas Mueller scored twice while attacking midfielder Thiago Alcantara and Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic also netted. There was more good news for both Bayern and Germany as Bastian Schweinsteiger made his first start since November after an ankle, then knee injury, to partner captain Philipp Lahm in the defensive midfield. ""It was good to start and have no problems, I feel good, even in terms of fitness,"" said Schweinsteiger. ""I still need to get into my rhythm and need some more match practice to get top fit. I just hope things stay positive for me."" Brazil's Rafinha, who took over from Lahm at right-back, strengthened his case for a Selecao place at June's World Cup with two crosses which both led to goals. Mueller set Bayern on the way to their 14th consecutive league win when he headed home Rafinha's cross with 25 minutes gone. Thiago then chested down Schweinsteiger's superb pass and fired home to make it 2-0 after 34 minutes. Mueller profited from a Mandzukic pass to get behind the Hanover defence and score his second on 59 minutes, while Mandzukic then headed home Rafinha's cross for Bayern's fourth, seven minutes later. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund suffered a shock 3-0 league defeat at strugglers Hamburg ahead of Tuesday's Champions League last-16 clash at Zenit St Petersburg. Hamburg recorded their first league win since November in Mirko Slomka's first match in charge as his side broke their eight-match losing streak, including a club record seven league matches. The result sees Hamburg remain among the relegation places, but move up to 16th, while Dortmund stay third. There was more bad news for Jurgen Klopp on Sunday as defensive midfielder Sven Bender was ruled out for the next 10 weeks with an inflamed pelvis. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen went down 3-1 at VfL Wolfsburg as Sami Hyypia's side lost for the seventh time in their last nine games. Leverkusen suffered a Champions League hangover, following their 4-0 last-16, first-leg home defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, with another poor display. Braunschweig are now three points adrift at the bottom after their 2-1 defeat at ten-man Nuremberg in a match where three penalties were saved. Borussia Moenchengladbach stay sixth, but are winless in their last seven games after their 2-2 draw at home to Hoffenheim. Augsburg got back to winning ways with a 4-2 victory at Freiburg to bounce back from last weekend's defeat to Nuremberg, their only loss in the last eight games. VfB Stuttgart are just above the bottom three after they suffered their seventh straight defeat at home to Hertha Berlin, who ran out 2-1 winners.

""We're not just going out there to swap shirts with them,"" said Keller defiantly, referring to Bayer Leverkusen's drubbing by Real's Spanish rivals Barcelona at the same stage in the competition two years ago. In February 2012, Leverkusen were beaten 3-1 at home in the last 16, then thrashed 7-1 in Barcelona, but not before Bayer players Michal Kadlec and Manuel Friedrich had argued over who would swap shirts with Barcelona star Lionel Messi. Keller has said there will be no such debate over which Schalke player can claim Ronaldo's famous number seven shirt after the Royal Blues' goalless draw with Mainz 05 on Friday night in the Bundesliga. ""Mainz were strong opposition, so there's nothing wrong with the result,"" said Keller with Schalke fourth in the Bundesliga. ""We now look forward to the Champions League game against Real Madrid."" Schalke have a decent Champions League record in recent years having reached the 2010/11 semi-finals and bowed out at the last 16 stage to Galatasaray last season. ""These are the games you dream of as a small child,"" said Germany midfielder Julian Draxler, who came on for the last 25 minutes against Mainz after missing three months with an ankle injury. Schalke certainly have their work cut out in the next week hosting Carlo Ancelotti's Real on Wednesday in the Champions League, then European champions Bayern Munich away in the Bundesliga next Saturday.

Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund will be using the match to tune up for Tuesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg trip to Russia to face Zenit St Petersburg having hammered Eintracht Frankfurt 4-0 at home last Saturday. ""The challenge of facing Dortmund is a good measuring stick for us,"" said Slomka. ""Everyone knows them and how they play, but we have a home game and, as I already have said and will keep on saying, we must win our home games. ""And I am sure the fans will give their support on Saturday."" Some 800 supporters turned out to watch Slomka's first training session on Monday. The response was a far cry from their last home game when angry fans pelted the team and attacked their cars following the 3-0 defeat to Hertha Berlin two weeks ago. Both sides have injury concerns with Hamburg missing captain Rafael van der Vaart, who suffered an ankle injury in last Saturday's 4-2 loss at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig which led to Van Marwijk's dismissal.

273,18/02/2014,11:50,Football: Bundesliga's marketing lags behind England: CEO,"All four German clubs have reached the Champions League's last 16, but Bundesliga boss Christian Seifert believes the German league is ten years behind England's Premier League in its marketing.","The 2013 Champions League final was an all-German affair last May as Bayern Munich enjoyed a 2-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund at London's Wembley. This season, both Bundesliga sides have joined domestic rivals Schalke and Bayer Leverkusen, who host Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, in the competition's last 16. But Seifert says while the Germans may be enjoying on-field success, their marketing is a decade behind that of their English rivals. In January, Premier League side Arsenal signed a five-year kit deal with Puma worth 30 million pounds (36.6 million euros, US$50m) per season. ""I am convinced that the Bundesliga will benefit from sustained good performances in Europe, in terms of global marketing,"" Seifert, CEO of the German Football League (DFL) told Hamburg daily Handelsblatt. ""But when you read that Puma have just pledged a three-figure deal in terms of millions, then that is food for thought. ""In terms of international marketing, the Bundesliga is ten years behind the Premier League."" Both Bayern and their Bundesliga rivals Hertha Berlin have announced recent bumper sponsorship deals. Munich's coffers will be boosted by an extra 110 million euros from Bavarian-based finance services company Allianz and Hertha have attracted 61.2 million euros from American investment group KKR. Seifert sees both developments as positive for the league. ""In my view, such a financial commitment can be quite meaningful,"" he said. ""After all, the Bundesliga is economically and sportingly one of the strongest professional leagues in the world."" But Seifert warns clubs to be wary of big-money deals from investors who could pull out overnight. ""During that period, an investor would have had some influence on the course of the competition, including de facto relegation and qualifications for international competitions,"" he said. ""We owe it to the clubs, their fans and their business partners to look at these deals very closely."" There are already safeguard measures in Germany, where the ""50+1"" rule means each club has to have a controlling stake to stop commercial investors gaining control. At European champions Bayern Munich, for example, Audi, Adidas and now Allianz each own nine per cent, but the rest is controlled by the members via the club."
274,17/02/2014,02:05,Football: PSG out to brush aside off-form Leverkusen,"Bayer Leverkusen must brush off recent poor form if they are to stop Zlatan Ibrahimovic's Paris Saint-Germain's march to the Champions League quarter-finals in Tuesday's last 16, first-leg clash.","Leverkusen have their work cut out containing maverick Ibrahimovic and overcoming the formidable obstacle of high-scoring PSG if they are to reach the last eight for the first time since 2002. Any side with Ibrahimovic in their ranks is dangerous and the Parisians finished as comfortable winners of Group C, scoring 16 goals in the process. The 32-year-old boasts the superb return of eight goals from five Champions League matches this term, leaving him second only to Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo, who has nine. The Sweden star already has three more than in his previous best seasons in the competition with Inter Milan in 2007/08 and AC Milan in 2011/12. Sami Hyypia-coached Leverkusen have had far from an ideal preparation, crashing to their second straight home defeat, their fifth loss in seven games, when they went down 2-1 to Schalke 04 in Saturday's Bundesliga match. The defeat followed second-division Kaiserslautern's shock 1-0 extra time German Cup win at Leverkusen's BayArena last Wednesday, but Hyypia refuses to panic. ""If we play like we did against Schalke, we will be able to live with Paris,"" said the ex-Liverpool defender. ""Only playing well doesn't bring us points, we have to be more effective and score goals. I hope we manage that against Paris."" Hyypia will be able to call up Germany winger Sidney Sam, who was rested for the Schalke defeat after announcing in January that he will join the Royal Blues at the end of the season. Having reached the quarter-finals for the first time last season, big-spending PSG are gunning to be crowned European champions for the first time. ""I think it would mean a lot,"" said Ibrahimovic, who scored in PSG's 3-0 win at home to Valenciennes on Friday to stay top of the French league. ""If we can get further than the quarter-finals this year, it would be a big step for us. ""This project has been ongoing for two years and I've been here for one-and-a-half - it is developing."" Leverkusen's last foray into the Champions League's knockout rounds came two years ago when they lost 3-1 at home to Barcelona in the last 16's first-leg, only to be humiliated 7-1 in Spain when Lionel Messi hit a record five goals. With the return leg in Paris on March 12, Leverkusen will need to tighten up at the back. The Werkself need to correct their deep-lying defence, which was punished when Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar headed Schalke's late winner. Hyypia will be without Australia winger and knee injury-victim Robbie Kruse, who is out for the season, while ex-Bayern Munich midfielder Emre Can is suspended. Uruguay forward Edinson Cavani is missing for PSG with a hamstring injury, while defenders Zoumana Camara, calf, and Christophe Jallet, back, are rated doubtful. Nevertheless, PSG head to Leverkusen in buoyant mood after Friday's win kept them top of the French league with a five-point lead. ""The primary goal before the Leverkusen match was to take the three points,"" said PSG coach Laurent Blanc. ""The players were thinking about Leverkusen, but they ignored that and got the job done."""
275,16/02/2014,02:30,Football: Bayern relishing Arsenal clash after Freiburg rout,"Manuel Neuer said holders Bayern Munich are relishing facing Arsenal in Wednesday's Champions League last-16, first-leg clash after routing Freiburg to go 16 points clear in the Bundesliga.","Germany goalkeeper Neuer was barely bothered by Freiburg's attack at Munich's Allianz Arena on Saturday as Pep Guardiola's champions extended their record unbeaten Bundesliga run to 46 matches with a 4-0 victory. Guardiola rested several stars ahead of the trip to the Gunners' Emirates Stadium, but still started with 10 internationals. ""We wanted to put in a good performance before the Arsenal game -- now we're looking forward to the Champions League,"" said Neuer. Brazil centre-back Dante opened the scoring when he headed home on 19 minutes, and Swiss Xherdan Shaqiri added the second on 34 minutes after a superb reverse pass from Claudio Pizarro fell into his path and he fired home. The stocky Swiss then added his second just before the break, and veteran striker Pizarro added a fourth two minutes from time. The game ended on a sour note for Shaqiri, though, as he went off with a torn hamstring and will miss the Arsenal match. Guardiola praised his side for a ninth straight victory in all competitions dating back to December's 3-2 defeat at home to Manchester City in the Champions League group stage. ""It is always difficult when the whole world says we have to win,"" said the Spaniard. ""I am very happy, it is unbelievable how the players are always fully concentrated, regardless of what happens. ""We didn't play particularly well this time, but we were serious. ""We only played well in the first 15, 20 minutes, but that's three more points and one game less."" Having won last season's league title with a record six games to spare, Bayern are on course to have the German league title again confirmed early. In contrast, second-placed Bayer Leverkusen, who host Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday, crashed to another home defeat when they lost 2-1 to Schalke 04. Having suffered a shock 1-0 extra-time defeat at home to second-division Kaiserslautern on Wednesday in the German Cup quarter-finals, Leverkusen stumbled to their fifth defeat in their last seven games. ""I am very pleased with the way the team played today,"" said Leverkusen boss Sami Hyypia, the ex-Liverpool centre-back. ""There was a huge difference with the way we played on Wednesday. ""I'd also be pleased if we played like that on Tuesday. ""The team has shown character, that was bad luck today and I feel for the team."" With Sweden star Zlatan Ibrahimovic leading PSG's attack, Laurent Blanc's side are closing in on back-to-back French league titles and Leverkusen defender Philipp Wollscheid summed up the downbeat mood. ""We just have to keep going. It's a shitty feeling to lose, but we did ok,"" said the 24-year-old Germany central defender. ""We have to get the game out of our legs and heads to focus on PSG."""

Schweinsteiger is set to feature at Munich's Allianz Arena as the European champions prepare to face the Gunners away in Wednesday's last 16, first leg, of the Champions League. Coach Pep Guardiola welcomed back his midfield general: ""It's super, super, super news, he has huge experience, but he still needs time."" Such is Bayern's strength in depth that they have continued to pick up wins even without the likes of Schweinsteiger and injured France winger Franck Ribery, who is out until March after an operation on his buttocks. Bayern have won all of their last nine matches, are unbeaten in a record 45 league matches and are 13 points clear in the table. Freiburg coach Christian Streich has suggested some unusual tactics against the league leaders -- to make sure Bayern enjoy themselves. ""Bayern should have fun and they only have that when they play against a good opponent,"" said the eccentric Streich, with his side 15th in the league, just above the relegation places. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund are chasing a second win this week over Eintracht Frankfurt at home. Gabon international winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang headed home Dortmund's second-half winner at Frankfurt in Tuesday's 1-0 cup quarter-final victory. Frankfurt climbed up to 12th in the table with a 3-0 win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig last Saturday as they bounced back from their 5-0 drubbing at Bayern the week before. Dortmund are hoping to have Germany midfielders Marco Reus and Sven Bender back after the pair both suffered thigh injuries in last Saturday's 5-1 win over Werder Bremen. ""We'll have to see, we don't want to take a risk with either of them,"" said coach Jurgen Klopp with both expected to train on Friday. There is still no news on when Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan will return to training after suffering from a virus. Bert van Marwijk is in a precarious position as he takes 17th-placed Hamburg to bottom side Eintracht Frankfurt with huge doubts over his future after a club record of six league defeats. Ex-Bayern, Schalke and Wolfsburg coach Felix Magath has already been widely tipped to replace former Holland coach Van Marwijk, who only took charge in September. Director of sport Oliver Kreuzer said he only has a job guarantee until Saturday, but another defeat could well be the Dutchman's last. Saturday's top clash sees second-side Bayer Leverkusen, who suffered a shock 1-0 cup defeat at home to second-division Kaiserslautern on Wednesday, host fourth-placed Schalke. Schalke were buoyed on Thursday when captain and centre-back Benedikt Hoewedes made a surprise return to training sooner than expected after recovering from a leg injury. ""The healing process has gone very, very well, but he still has a few problems and is still questionable,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. Keller said right back Atsuto Uchida has flown back to Japan and could face an operation for a leg injury, while midfielders Julian Draxler and Roman Neustaedter are both in the squad for Leverkusen.

Munich will host second-division Kaiserslautern and Dortmund at home to VfL Wolfsburg with the final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 17. Bayern's Croatia international striker Mario Mandzukic scored a hat-trick at Hamburg as the hosts' defence capitulated in what could be coach Bert van Marwijk's last game in charge. After setting an unwanted club record by losing all of their last six league matches, Hamburg were again trounced at their Imtech Arena with Mandzukic, Dante and Arjen Robben scoring Bayern's first three goals. Croatia's Mandzukic then added two more in as many second-half minutes as Bayern finished with a flurry. Having also lost 3-0 at home to Hertha Berlin on Saturday, Hamburg have leaked eight goals without reply in their last two games and are second from bottom in the league. Ex-Holland coach Van Marwijk's position grows every more precarious. ""They overpowered us and were outstanding,"" admitted Hamburg's director of sport Oliver Kreuzer, whose side faces bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig in the league on Saturday. ""I hope we will see a reaction from our team. ""Braunschweig aren't Bayern Munich, but with regard to everything else, I have no idea (what will happen)."" With an internal battle raging behind the scenes between Hamburg's Supervisory and Executive boards, Van Marwijk could well have had his last game in charge having only taken charge in September. Ex-Bayern, Schalke and Wolfsburg coach Felix Magath is widely tipped as the favourite to take over. Bayern were rarely troubled and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer needed 15 minutes to get his first touch of the ball and the opening goal came just six minute later. Germany midfielder Mario Goetze found some space and dribbled to the goal-line, held off his marker and squared for Mandzukic to tap home. Brazil centre-back Dante followed that up with a header four minutes later from a Toni Kroos' corner to give the visitors a 2-0 lead at the break. Holland winger Arjen Robben then chested down a beautiful long ball from Kroos and fired past Hamburg goalkeeper Rene Adler on 54 minutes. Mandzukic made it 4-0 when he profited again from another superb piece of skill from Goetze on 74 minutes, then fired home his third with 76 minutes gone. There was more good news for Bayern as Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger came on for the last 25 minutes after three months out with an ankle injury. ""Now come the games which will be decided by small things. We have to get through them,"" said Schweinsteiger, with Bayern already looking ahead to Wednesday's Champions League last 16 clash at Arsenal. Bayern will be joined in the draw for April's semi-finals by Borussia Dortmund, VfL Wolfsburg and second-division Kaiserlautern, who inflicted a shock 1-0 defeat on Bayer Leverkusen. A 114th-minute goal from Norway midfielder Ruben Jenssen was enough to see Kaiserlautern into the last four as the soul non-Bundesliga representative.

Holland winger Arjen Robben then chested down a beautiful long ball from Kroos and fired past Hamburg goalkeeper Rene Adler on 54 minutes. Mandzukic made it 4-0 when he profited again from another superb piece of skill from Goetze on 74 minutes, then fired home his third with 76 minutes gone.

""Now come the games which will be decided by small things. We have to get through them,"" said Schweinsteiger, with Bayern already looking ahead to Wednesday's Champions League last 16 clash at Arsenal. Bayern will be joined in the draw for April's semi-finals by Borussia Dortmund, VfL Wolfsburg and second-division Kaiserlautern, who inflicted a shock 1-0 defeat on Bayer Leverkusen.

Bremen midfielder Levent Aycicek scored a late consolation on his Bundesliga debut, but there was precious little else for Werder fans to enjoy. This was the 12th time this season Bremen have conceded three or more goals and coach Robin Dutt is under increasing pressure with his side 13th and just three points from the relegation places. In the basement battle, Eintracht Frankfurt moved up to 12th with a 3-0 win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Freiburg were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Hoffenheim while sixth-placed VfL Wolfsburg enjoyed a 3-0 win at home to Mainz 05. On Friday, second-placed Bayer Leverkusen enjoyed a 1-0 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach with South Korea's Son Heung-Min scoring the second-half winner."
290,08/02/2014,17:40,Football: Dominant Bayern extend record runs at Nuremberg,European champions Bayern Munich extended both their unbeaten league records with a 2-0 win at Nuremberg on Saturday as the Bavarian giants remained 13 points clear in the Bundesliga.,"The 39-point gulf between the two teams in the league table was clear as run-away leaders Bayern have now collected 56 of a possible 60 points this season. This was Bayern's 45th unbeaten Bundesliga match, dating back to October 2012, and their 29th unbeaten away game to add to their league records. Nuremberg came into the game in resurgent mood with two previous wins, but the defeat dropped them back into the bottom three. Bayern needed just 17 minutes to take the lead at Nuremberg's Grundig Stadium when Germany star Mario Goetze put David Alaba in space down the flank and the Austria left-back flicked in a cross for Mario Mandzukic to volley home. The Croatia striker then turned provider when he put captain Philipp Lahm in space to fire home on 49 minutes as Bayern counter-attacked. It should have been more when Arjen Robben hit the post ten minutes later, but Bayern were in complete control. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund enjoyed a 5-1 win at Werder Bremen with Poland striker Robert Lewandowski and attacking midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan both scoring twice. Dortmund made their pressing game count when defender Marcel Schmelzer pounced on a mistake on the left and slid his pass in for Lewandowski to hit the top right-hand corner with 26 minutes gone. Dortmund doubled the lead at Bremen's Weser Stadion when Arminia's Mkhitaryan scored his first league goal since September when he held off a challenge from Holland's Eljero Elia and blasted his shot into the left-hand corner four minutes from the break. Veteran centre-back Manuel Friedrich then volleyed home just after the break to claim his first Bundesliga goal for two years since he was at Bayer Leverkusen, but signed by Dortmund last November to ease their injury crisis. Lukasz Piszczek's shot clipped the cross bar on 56 minutes, but Dortmund were not to be denied a fourth when Mkhitaryan curled in his second after Marco Reus's superb back-heel pass on 62 minutes before Lewandowski added a late fifth. Bremen midfielder Levent Aycicek scored a late consolation on his Bundesliga debut, but there was precious little else for Werder fans to enjoy. This was the 12th time this season Bremen have conceded three or more goals and coach Robin Dutt is under increasing pressure with his side 13th and just three points from the relegation places. In the basement battle, Eintracht Frankfurt moved up to 12th with a 3-0 win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Frankfurt took an early lead through midfielder Johannes Flum, but then killed off the game with two goals in as many minutes from attacking midfielder Alexander Maier and striker Stefan Aigner. Freiburg were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Hoffenheim while sixth-placed VfL Wolfsburg enjoyed a 3-0 win at home to Mainz 05. On Friday, second-placed Bayer Leverkusen enjoyed a 1-0 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach with South Korea's Son Heung-Min scoring the second-half winner."
291,07/02/2014,23:02,Football: Son's strike adds to Gladbach's misery,South Korean striker Son Heung-Min hit his eighth Bundesliga goal of the season on Friday to seal Bayer Leverkusen's 1-0 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach as the hosts' slump continued.,"Sami Hyypia-coached Leverkusen tightened their grip on second place in the table to go seven points clear of Borussia Dortmund, who are at Werder Bremen on Sunday. Leverkusen are still 10 points behind leaders Bayern Munich, who are at Nuremberg on Saturday, while Gladbach are now winless in their last five games. Korea's Son hit the winner on 62 minutes with a bullet of a shot off his right foot. A pass from Germany winger Sidney Sam found Son on the edge of the area to hit the top left-hand corner, giving Borussia goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen no chance. ""It was a very important game for us as we came in with only a four-point lead, so we're very happy,"" said Son. ""It was a good pass and I got the ball in a good position, so it gave me space to shoot. ""It's something I often practice in training and I'm delighted it came off. ""We put the work in today and we deserved the three points."" Lucien Favre's Gladbach started 2014 third in the league, but they suffered their three consecutive defeat on Friday which leaves them down in fifth. Their nightmare run at home to Leverkusen, who they have not beaten in Monechengladbach for 25 years, continued. The last time they beat Bayer at home was their 2-0 win on February 22 1989, less then eight months before the Berlin Wall fell. The hosts had their chances with 14 shots on goal, compared to Bayer's 12, and both Germany striker Max Kruse and winger Patrick Herrmann went close. There was an unusual yellow card handed out by referee Florian Meyer when substitute Philipp Wollscheid was booked while on the bench after only nine minutes. The replacement defender threw a spare ball into play and was swiftly shown a yellow card. Leverkusen have a busy programme as they host Schalke 04 next Saturday before Paris Saint Germain visit them in the Champions League's last 16, first round tie on February 18."

293,07/02/2014,02:15,Football: Resurgent Nuremberg out to topple giants Bayern,"Strugglers Nuremberg have hauled themselves out of the Bundesliga's relegation places, but their new-found form faces the acid test on Saturday against runaway league leaders Bayern Munich.","The Franconians became the last team in a major European league to pick up their first win of the season only a fortnight ago with a 4-0 win at home to Hoffenheim. Dutch coach Gertjan Verbeek then steered Nuremberg to a convincing 3-1 win at Hertha Berlin last Sunday and 15th in the table, but halting record-breaking Bayern's 44-match unbeaten league run is an altogether different proposition. ""We're at home, we have a run and we need the points. We'll give it all we have,"" said Nuremberg midfielder Mike Frantz. Swiss striker Josip Drmic has scored four goals in the last two matches and said while Bayern have swept aside all comers, ""we believe we can beat them"". A quick glance at the league table shows Bayern and Nuremberg are poles apart. As league leaders, Bayern are 31 points ahead of Nuremberg and while the Franconians have won just two of their 19 games so far, Pep Guardiola's Bayern have won all bar two of theirs, dropping just four points. ""We have reason to be happy,"" said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm. ""When you have a 13-point lead in the table, like we have, then we're the only ones who can trip ourselves up."" Bayern have an away quarter-final at Hamburg in the German Cup next Wednesday, then host Freiburg in the league before their Champions League last 16, first-leg away match at Arsenal on February 19. Having hammered Eintracht Frankfurt 5-0 at home last Saturday, Bayern will travel to Franconia in no mood to give away points, and anything less than a Munich win would be a shock result. ""The important big games are still to come,"" said winger Arjen Robben. ""We need to stay really relaxed and keep working."" In the pack chasing Bayern, Sami Hyypia's second-placed Bayer Leverkusen are at fifth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday, with the hosts looking for their first home win over the Werkself in 25 years. Successive defeats have seen Gladbach drop from third to fifth, but Leverkusen have also struggled with last Saturday's 2-1 win over Stuttgart breaking a three-match losing streak against opponents in the bottom-half of the table. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund travel to Werder Bremen looking to close the four-point gap behind Leverkusen. Dortmund were dealt some bad news on Wednesday when Germany defender Mats Hummels was ruled out for two weeks with strained ankle ligaments, having only just returned from a two-month break after injuring his heel on the same foot. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp expects to have Greek defender Sokratis available after his wife gave birth to their baby daughter on Wednesday. Klopp said new signing Milos Jojic is set to make his debut soon after the attacking midfielder has impressed in training. Struggling Bremen are 12th and looking for just their sixth league win of the season and their third at home. ""The fans in the stadium should see that we have given our all until the final whistle,"" said Austria midfielder Zlatko Junuzovic. ""We need to run until we puke."" At the other end of the table, there is an important basement battle as bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig are at 14th-placed Eintracht Frankfurt, who are just a point above the relegation play-off spot.

But defeats to league leaders Bayern Munich and a shock 3-1 loss at Hanover 96 last Saturday have seen Favre's side drop to fifth as they prepare to host Sami Hyypia's second-placed Leverkusen on Friday. History is against Gladbach. They last beat Leverkusen at home 25 years ago when stars Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Patrick Herrmann were not even born. ""It's time to win against Leverkusen,"" said Favre with only 60 kilometres separating the two teams. Favre is looking for improvement after poor performances in Hanover from Gladbach's stars left-wing Juan Arango, left-back Oscar Wendt and Germany striker Max Kruse, while sports director Max Eberl says the effort was lacking. ""The Bundesliga means 100 percent effort every weekend,"" said Eberl, with Gladbach 20 points behind leaders Bayern, but only three short of a top-three place which carries Champions League qualification. ""I don't believe everyone put in 100 percent in Hanover and you were left with the feeling that not everyone went to his limit, which was the case in the first half of the season."" Favre said Gladbach will need to contain Germany winger Sidney Sam who returned from injury in last Saturday's 2-1 win at home to Stuttgart with Hyypia's side renown for attacking down the flanks. ""We haven't had as many chances in our last two games as we had in the first half of the season,"" said Favre. ""Our opponents have had time to analyse how we play, but now we need to find solutions."" Gladbach will be without suspended wing-back Julian Korb, while both centre-backs Martin Stranzl and Rouel Brouwers are struggling with injuries. Leverkusen have held second place in the league despite a worrying run of three defeats -- all against side in the lower half of the league -- and got back to winning ways last weekend.

Spain's Thiago Alcantara set a new Bundesliga record with 185 ball contacts as Bayern's midfield dominated. ""They showed from the start who was the boss,"" enthused ex-Bayern president Franz Beckenbauer. ""At the break they could have been three of four-nil ahead."" Germany star Goetze put the hosts ahead when he chested down Mario Mandzukic's cross and slammed his shot inside the far post with only 12 minutes gone. France star Ribery then proved he has recovered from a leg injury when he added Bayern's second just before the break. Likewise, Robben came off the bench and fired home Goetze's final pass to put his leg injury behind him on 67 minutes before Dante headed Bayern's fourth two minutes later. Fittingly, Mandzukic, who was dropped ten days ago for poor training performances, netted their fifth on 89 minutes and was mobbed by his team-mates. ""He has reacted really well and today was a super performance,"" enthused Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer. This was Bayern's 17th win in 19 games and they have conceded just nine league goals. The European champions now face Freiburg, Hamburg and Nuremberg, who are all in the bottom four, before their Champions League last 16, first-leg match at Arsenal on February 19. Earlier, ten-man Nuremberg climbed out of the bottom three for the first time since October with only their second win of the season after Sunday's 3-1 victory at Hertha Berlin to climb to 15th. Nuremberg's Swiss striker Josip Drmic scored twice, including a penalty deep in added time to claim his second brace in as many weeks. There was drama on the stroke of 90 minutes when Nuremberg midfielder Ondrej Petrak was sent off for saving a shot with his hand. Despite furious protests from Hertha, referee Michael Weiner did not award the home team a penalty as Berlin's Ramos had fired from an offside position. On Saturday, second-placed Bayer Leverkusen broke their three-match losing streak with a 2-1 win at home to VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga. Swiss striker Eren Derdiyok headed home Leverkusen's winner six minutes from time. Stuttgart's Moritz Leitner had given the visitors an early lead before Bayer striker Stefan Kiessling equalised in the first half. Schalke 04 moved up to fourth with a 2-1 victory at home to ten-man VfL Wolfsburg with Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng firing home the winner nine minutes from time. The Royal Blues, who have lost just once in nine games, had taken an early lead after a scrappy goal was credited to Brazilian centre-back Felipe Santana as both he and Boateng lunged for the ball. Wolfsburg drew level despite being down to 10 men, after Daniel Caligiuri was sent off for insulting the referee five minutes into the second-half, when teenager Maximilian Arnold fired home on 65 minutes. But Boateng then fired home the winner for his sixth goal of the season to give Schalke their second straight win. Hanover 96's revival under new coach Tayfun Korkut continued as they earned a 3-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach with Senegal's Mame Diouf scoring twice.

But despite their status as overwhelming favourites to retain the title this season, Guardiola says they cannot afford to take their eye off the ball, particularly following Wednesday's last-minute 2-1 victory at VfB Stuttgart. ""If a team doesn't lose 43 times and everyone says that the Bundesliga (title-race) is over, with the championship is secured, it's not easy for the player's to stay focused,"" said Guardiola. ""To always win, win, win -- I know how difficult that is."" The victory gave Bayern yet another league record as they went 28 away matches unbeaten, breaking Hamburg's previous mark of 27 set in 1983. Last season they broke or equalled 25 Bundesliga records, winning the title with a record six games to spare, as they finished up with a 25-point margin. Stuttgart came the closest of any team to beating Bayern in the league this season until Thiago Alcantara's last-minute bicycle kick broke their resistence. That was enough to see the rest of the league as good as throw in the towel as far as the Bundesliga is concerned. Guardiola has not even had his entire squad available so far this season with Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger the main star currently sidelined with a knee injury. And Bayern's main rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen both admit that they are fighting for second place at best. ""Bayern aren't from this world at the moment,"" said Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller, whose team are second despite three successive defeats. ""The danger is very real that it will be boring at the top."" Leverkusen host Stuttgart, who have also lost their last three, on Saturday hoping to have Germany winger Sidney Sam back from injury, while they have signed experienced Mexico left winger Andres Guardado from Valencia on loan until the end of the season. Third-placed Dortmund are also looking to end a run of poor performances, which saw them pick up just five points in their last seven games, when they travel to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig on Friday. ""Earning second-place would be like winning the championship now,"" Dortmund midfielder Jonas Hofmann said. Dortmund have been blighted with injuries of late. Poland winger Jakub Blaszczykowski became their second player ruled out for the season with a knee injury after defender Neven Subotic. Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan is laid low with a virus, having only just recovered from a back problem. ""He has a viral infection, everyone knows how long it takes to get over something like that,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, who labelled his side 'hunters' in the quest for second place behind Bayern. ""He is nearly ready to come back, but it will take time."" Fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach, who are level on points with Dortmund, are at Hanover 96 on Saturday. Gladbach lost third spot as a consequence of their 2-0 defeat to Bayern last Friday and coach Lucien Favre has said they must learn from their mistakes.

But despite their status as overwhelming favourites to retain the title this season, Guardiola says they cannot afford to take their eye off the ball, particularly following Wednesday's last-minute 2-1 victory at VfB Stuttgart. ""If a team doesn't lose 43 times and everyone says that the Bundesliga (title-race) is over, with the championship is secured, it's not easy for the player's to stay focused,"" said Guardiola. ""To always win, win, win -- I know how difficult that is."" The victory gave Bayern yet another league record as they went 28 away matches unbeaten, breaking Hamburg's previous mark of 27 set in 1983. Last season they broke or equalled 25 Bundesliga records, winning the title with a record six games to spare, as they finished up with a 25-point margin. Stuttgart came the closest of any team to beating Bayern in the league this season until Thiago Alcantara's last-minute bicycle kick broke their resistence. That was enough to see the rest of the league as good as throw in the towel as far as the Bundesliga is concerned. Guardiola has not even had his entire squad available so far this season with Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger the main star currently sidelined with a knee injury. And Bayern's main rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen both admit that they are fighting for second place at best. ""Bayern aren't from this world at the moment,"" said Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller, whose team are second despite three successive defeats. ""The danger is very real that it will be boring at the top."" Leverkusen host Stuttgart, who have also lost their last three, on Saturday hoping to have Germany winger Sidney Sam back from injury, while they have signed experienced Mexico left winger Andres Guardado from Valencia on loan until the end of the season. Third-placed Dortmund are also looking to end a run of poor performances, which saw them pick up just five points in their last seven games, when they travel to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig on Friday. ""Earning second-place would be like winning the championship now,"" Dortmund midfielder Jonas Hofmann said. Dortmund have been blighted with injuries of late. Poland winger Jakub Blaszczykowski became their second player ruled out for the season with a knee injury after defender Neven Subotic. Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan is laid low with a virus, having only just recovered from a back problem. ""He has a viral infection, everyone knows how long it takes to get over something like that,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, who labelled his side 'hunters' in the quest for second place behind Bayern. ""He is nearly ready to come back, but it will take time."" Fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach, who are level on points with Dortmund, are at Hanover 96 on Saturday. Gladbach lost third spot as a consequence of their 2-0 defeat to Bayern last Friday and coach Lucien Favre has said they must learn from their mistakes.

But Sami Hyypia-coached Leverkusen were stunned at Freiburg as the hosts twice came from behind before midfielder Felix Klaus hit the dramatic 90th-minute winner. ""We were okay in the first-half, then we gave away too much ball and Freiburg counter-attacked us,"" admitted Hyypia. ""They were dangerous, we tried to win the game, but then came the final counter attack."" The result saw Freiburg climb out of the bottom three up to 15th as the hosts cancelled out goals by Bayer midfielders Lars Bender and Simon Rolfes. Leverkusen have lost their last three games after finishing 2013 with league defeats to strugglers Frankfurt and Bremen. Bayern can extend their lead even further with a trip to VfB Stuttgart on Wednesday in a re-arranged fixture. Borussia Dortmund clawed their way up to third place on goal difference over Moenchengladbach with a 2-2 draw at home to Augsburg with Lars's twin brother Germany midfielder Sven Bender netting for both sides. The Dortmund midfielder gave the hosts the lead at Westfalenstadion after just six minutes, then turned the ball into his own net on 56 minutes for Augsburg's equaliser. Turkey midfielder Nuri Sahin looked to have spared Bender and Borussia's blushes with a brilliant free-kick to make it 2-1 with 20 minutes left. But Augsburg drew level when South Korea's Ji Dong-Won -- who will play for Dortmund next season -- headed home just two minutes after coming on to leave his side ninth in the table.

Hanover took the lead through striker Artjoms Rudnevs, which was cancelled out by Croatia striker Ivica Olic's first half tap-in. A pair of second-half goals by ex-Dortmund midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt sealed the welcome win for Hanover. Nuremberg also celebrated a milestone as they became the last team in a major European league to pick up their first win of the season with a 4-0 victory over Hoffenheim. Likewise, Eintracht Frankfurt picked up their first home win of the season with a shock 1-0 win to move up to 14th against sixth-placed Hertha Berlin.

Dortmund took the lead through Nuri Sahin's curled free-kick before South Korea's Ji Dong-Won, on loan from Sunderland, slipped his marker, Bender, to head home the equaliser. There was also little for Bender's twin, Lars, to cheer about, even after scoring the first goal in Bayer Leverkusen's shock 3-2 defeat at strugglers Freiburg. Bayer were floored by a 90th minute-winner from Freiburg's Felix Klaus. The result means Bayer stay 10 points adrift of league leaders Bayern Munich. Between them, the Bender twins have made 18 appearances for Germany with Lars scoring the winner in the 2-1 group stage victory over Denmark at Euro 2012."

A superb strike from Bayern forward Mario Goetze after just seven minutes gave the defending champions the lead before Thomas Mueller converted a second-half penalty. With their main rivals playing Saturday, Bayern took the chance to extend their lead and can pull further ahead in Stuttgart on Wednesday in a re-arranged fixture. Having suffered a shock 3-0 friendly defeat at Austrian league leaders Red Bull Salzburg last Saturday, Guardiola was delighted to return to winning ways at Borussia Park. ""We took our lessons from the defeat in Salzburg and we played well against an unbelievably good opponent,"" said the 43-year-old. ""It's not easy to win here and we controlled the game. ""I was pleased with our performance and we have a big chance to extend our lead with three more points at Stuttgart on Wednesday."" It was Guardiola who learnt the biggest lesson from the Salzburg defeat as he abandoned an experimental three-man defence, reverting to his prefered 4-1-4-1 formation. Striker Mario Mandzukic was left out of the match day squad completely - ""Mario hasn't been training as we know he can,"" explained director of sport Matthias Sammer, preferring Germany star Goetze up front. This was a typical Bayern performance under Guardiola: around 65 percent possession, 24 shots on goal compared to Gladbach's 10, with twice as many passes made and completed as their opponents. ""We worked really, really well and put in a good performance, we deserved the win,"" said Goetze. ""We are a super team and under the coach's guidance, every player is improving and feels good here. ""We're looking forward to the next game."" It seems folly to talk of the Bundesliga title being already decided in January, but Bayern show no signs of dropping points. They have already also won at fourth-placed Borussia Dortmund and drawn at second-placed Bayer Leverkusen. ""Bayern were clearly superior to us over the 90 minutes,"" admitted Germany striker Max Kruse as Gladbach suffered their first home defeat of the season to abruptly end  their eight-match unbeaten run. ""You could see from the start that they wanted to pick up where they left off last year."" The hosts squandered three clear chances to score. Kruse hit the post, Juan Arango forcing Bayern's Manuel Neuer into a good save before the break, then Patrick Herrmann fired wide late on with the goal at his mercy. ""In some situations, perhaps we missed a bit of luck,"" admitted Borussia goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who has been linked to a move to Barcelona. ""(Bayern goalkeeper) Manuel Neuer was strong in the decisive situations for them. ""It's very different playing against Bayern Munich, they were simply better than we were."" While captain Philipp Lahm was again switched from right-back to defensive midfielder, Bayern ruled in the middle. Thiago Alcantara and Toni Kroos were outstanding alongside Lahm, but Bayern have yet to welcome back a host of midfield stars. Wingers Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben were both kept back, while Javi Martinez and Bastian Schweinsteiger are also still to feature."

The Bavarian giants face three league games in ten days as they tackle VfB Stuttgart on Wednesday in a postponed fixture, then host Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday February 2. The aim for the Bavarians now is to produce another eye-catching performance to dispirit the chasing pack. ""We must show the competition that there is nothing to pick up in terms of points,"" said Germany forward Thomas Mueller. ""We mustn't show any weak points and give rise to any hope. ""We can't go half-hearted into these games, the supposedly mighty FC Bayern won't be given any favours."" Bayern's thirst for titles is unsatiable at present having added the Club World Cup in December to August's UEFA Super Cup title after last season's treble of European, league and domestic cup titles. But Pep Guardiola's team were given a wake-up call in a friendly last Saturday when hosts Red Bull Salzburg inflicted a 3-0 defeat on Bayern, which set off a few ""alarm bells"", according to Mueller. ""We need to get out of holiday mode,"" said the 24-year-old as the Bundesliga returns after a four-week break. ""Gladbach will want to take something out of this. ""If an opponent is aggressive and doesn't crap their pants, then we can also have a few problems to deal with."" Gladbach usurped Borussia Dortmund from third place in the league with a strong finish to 2013. Borussia Park has uncomfortable memories for Bayern who lost 3-1 there in January 2012, having also gone to Gladbach as league leaders, and they had to fight back from 3-1 down in May before sealing a 4-3 win. ""It will be a hotly-contested game, if we aren't focused, there will be a result like there was in Salzburg,"" said Bayern's ex-Gladbach defender Dante. Dortmund, who are down to fourth place, need to break a three-match losing streak in the league at home when they host Augsburg on Saturday. Bayern, Leverkusen and Hertha Berlin all enjoyed wins at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion towards the end of the year and coach Jurgen Klopp's side enjoyed a 6-1 friendly drubbing of minnows Duisburg on Tuesday. Klopp will still be without the injured trio of midfielder Ilkay Gundogan (back), plus defenders Mats Hummels (ankle) and Neven Subotic (knee). Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen will also want to bounce back from their 1-0 defeat at Werder Bremen in December when they travel to face third-from-bottom Freiburg on Saturday."
311,22/12/2013,18:38,Football: Hard times for Klopp as Dortmund slump again,Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has admitted last season's Champions League's finalists have fallen on hard times after slumping to their third consecutive home defeat in the Bundesliga.,"Hertha Berlin's 2-1 win at Dortmund on Saturday was the third straight home league defeat Borussia have suffered at the Westfalentstadion -- the first time that has happened in 13 years. Dortmund dropped to fourth -- outside the automatic Champions League places -- as Borussia Moenchengladbach drew 2-2 at home to VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday to go eight games unbeaten. ""One must always be grateful and humble in life, these great lads have already written some great stories this year -- today it was different,"" admitted Klopp as the Bundesliga breaks for winter. ""This is a shitty end to 2013."" With the Bundesliga now on a winter break, Dortmund finish the year 12 points behind league leaders Bayern Munich, who have a game in hand. Borussia's current form is a far cry from last season's eye-catching football which carried them through to May's Champions League final where they lost 2-1 to Bayern. Dortmund have suffered five defeats in the first half of the season -- the most in the same period since Klopp took charge five years ago. Having lost at home to Bayern, Bayer Leverkusen and Hertha, Dortmund are already effectively out of the title race. A catalogue of injuries has blighted Klopp of late, especially to his first-choice centre-back pairing of Mats Hummels and Neven Subotic, who is out until May with a torn knee ligament. It has meant 18-year-old Marian Sarr, who made his Dortmund debut in the 2-1 Champions League win at Marseille, has broken into the first team, but it was his mistake which led to Berlin's second goal. After Germany winger Marco Reus gave Dortmund the lead, Colombia striker Adrian Ramos pulled one back, after a mistake from Dortmund left-back Erik Durm, before Hertha took the lead with 45 minutes gone. When Sarr slipped in possession, Tunisia striker Sami Allagui pounced on the error and sprinted around Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller to roll the ball into an empty net to Sarr's dismay. Klopp admitted he was looking forward to the winter break, which should see the return of Hummels and midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, as Borussia prepare for their training camp which starts January 5. ""Then we can start from scratch,"" said Klopp, whose side had 18 shots on goal to Berlin's six. ""We had our chances, we just didn't recognise them or use them. ""Today was only our smallest problem, the whole year has been very intense for us, particularly the last third.

314,22/12/2013,02:10,Football: Hard times for Klopp as Dortmund slump again,Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has admitted last season's Champions League's finalists have fallen on hard times after slumping to their third consecutive home defeat in the Bundesliga.,"Hertha Berlin's 2-1 win in Dortmund on Saturday was the third straight home league defeat Borussia have suffered at the Westfalentstadion -- the first time that has happened in 13 years. Dortmund will drop to fourth -- outside the automatic Champions League places -- if Borussia Moenchengladbach pick up just a point at home to VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday to go eight games unbeaten. ""One must always be grateful and humble in life, these greats lads have already written some great stories this year -- today it was different,"" admitted Klopp as the Bundesliga breaks for winter. ""This is a shitty end to 2013."" Borussia's current form is a far cry from last season's eye-catching football which carried them through to May's Champions League final where they lost 2-1 to Bayern Munich. Dortmund have suffered five defeats in the first half of the season -- the most in the same period since Klopp took charge five years ago. Having lost at home to Bayern, Bayer Leverkusen and Hertha, Dortmund finish 2013 effectively out of the title race as they find themselves 12 points behind Munich, who have a game in hand. A catalogue of injuries has blighted Klopp of late, especially to his first-choice centre-back pairing of Mats Hummels and Neven Subotic, who is out until May with a torn knee ligament. It has meant 18-year-old Marian Sarr, who made his Dortmund debut in the 2-1 Champions League win at Marseille, has broken into the first team, but it was his mistake which led to Berlin's second goal. After Germany winger Marco Reus gave Dortmund the lead, Colombia striker Adrian Ramos pulled one back, after a mistake from Dortmund left-back Erik Durm, before Hertha took the lead with 45 minutes gone. When Sarr slipped in possession, Tunisia striker Sami Allagui pounced on the error and sprinted around Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller to roll the ball into an empty net to Sarr's dismay. Klopp admitted he was looking forward to the winter break, which should see the return of Hummels and midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, as Borussia prepare for their training camp which starts January 5. ""Then we can start from scratch,"" said Klopp, whose side had 18 shots on goal to Berlin's six. ""We had our chances, we just didn't recognise them or use them. ""Today was only our smallest problem, the whole year has been very intense for us, particularly the last third. ""We have set high standards and all the matches we lost this season we didn't need to lose."" The focus now for Klopp is on facing Zenit St Petersburg in the last 16 of the Champions League and the quarter-final of the German Cup -- as well as recapturing last season's form."

Tunisia forward Allagui then gave Hertha the lead by pouncing on a mistake by Dortmund's teenaged centre-back Marian Sarr, rounding Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller and firing into an empty net on the stroke of half-time. Klopp substituted the clearly distressed Sarr for the start of the second-half, moving left-back Kevin Grosskreutz into centre-back, but his side failed to grab a precious equaliser despite seven minutes of added time.

The Royal Blues were without coach Jens Keller, who has been told a decision on his future will be made over the winter break, as the 43-year-old was suffering with flu. The point was enough to see Nuremberg stay 17th, leaving Eintracht Braunschweig bottom on goal difference despite their 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Freiburg extended Hanover 96's appalling away record to eight consecutive defeats with a 2-1 win to help the hosts in their bid to escape the bottom three.

318,20/12/2013,02:30,Football: Rivals out to attack absent Bayern's lead,"With runaway leaders Bayern Munich involved in Saturday's Club World Cup final, their Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen will be aiming to trim the Bavarians' lead.","Munich hold a seven-point lead at the top of the table and are threatening to again run off with the title, unless their rivals can steal a march with Bayern in Morocco. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen face Werder Bremen away on Saturday with the hosts winless in their last five games. ""It won't be easy for us but we want to make a good impression in our last match before the winter break and take all three points,"" said Bayer coach Sami Hyypia. Leverkusen can set a new club record of 40 points for the first half of the season with a win at Bremen on what will be the final Bundesliga weekend of 2013. But Bayer slumped to a shock defeat at the hands of strugglers Eintracht Frankfurt last weekend and Bremen plan to follow suit. ""Bayer 04 have been in the leading pack for years but we've got a chance in front of our own fans,"" said Bremen midfielder Clemens Fritz. ""Frankfurt showed the way. Football is always capable of springing a surprise."" Werder coach Robin Dutt was so furious after his side's 3-2 defeat at Hertha Berlin last weekend that he sent the squad for a 4am gym session on their return to Bremen. Dutt is waiting on the fitness of captain Aaron Hunt as the veteran midfielder struggles with a calf injury. ""There is a big question mark against him, he would be a big loss,"" said Dutt. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund, who are 12 points behind Bayern and five adrift of Leverkusen, host Hertha Berlin looking for only their second league win in five games. Four points from those five matches has been a poor return and coach Jurgen Klopp is hoping to get some of his stars off the injured list to try to turn things around. Germany left-back Marcel Schmelzer could feature after a calf tear but it is still too early for defensive midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, who has at least trained with the squad this week. The 23-year-old has not played since injuring his back in Germany's friendly draw against Paraguay in August. And Klopp is also without both centre-backs Neven Subotic and Mats Hummels. Yet rather than looking forward to seeing the back of 2013, he remains eager to get their title challenge back on track. ""I'm not ready yet for Christmas,"" he said. ""We have had a great week of training and we could get down to some good work. The team are up for it."" Nuremberg host Schalke 04 on Saturday evening still looking for their first win of the season -- the only team in Europe's major leagues without a victory so far. Should Dortmund falter against Berlin, fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach can usurp them from third when they host VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday. Gladbach are unbeaten in their last seven games and enjoyed a six-match winning streak before being held to a goalless draw at Mainz last Saturday."
319,16/12/2013,10:54,Football: Record-breaking Bayern dominate in 2013,European champions Bayern Munich begin the quest for their first Club World Cup title on Tuesday having dominated German football in 2013 and finished the year unbeaten in the Bundesliga.,"The Bavarian giants' 3-1 win at home to Hamburg on Saturday means they finish with a new record 93 Bundesliga points for a calendar year and were unbeaten in the German league in 2013. The victory also extended the Champions League winners' unbeaten record in the Bundesliga to 41 games, dating back to October 2012. They launch their Club World Cup campaign in Morocco against China's Asian champions Guangzhou Evergrande FC in Tuesday's semi-finals for a place in Saturday's final. ""2013 has been an unbelievable year for FC Bayern, now we fly to Morocco and try to win our next title,"" said coach Pep Guardiola. Despite losing 3-2 at home to Manchester City last Tuesday, Bayern still finished top of their group to progress to the last 16 of the Champions League as they look to defend the title they won at Wembley in May. The Bavarians run to the 2013 final included a 7-0 drubbing of Barcelona on aggregate in the semi-finals as Bayern became the first German side to win the treble of European, league and cup titles under Jupp Heynckes. Under Heynckes, Bayern set 25 Bundesliga records including the most points (91) and fewest goals conceded (18 over the 34 matches) and show no sign on faltering under new boss Guardiola. Having returned from his year-long sabbatical in New York after winning 14 titles in four years at Barcelona, Guardiola took charge of Bayern in June. Midfielders Thiago Alcantara and Mario Goetze were added to their star-studded squad for this season as Guardiola has brought his own version of Barcelona's tiki-taka football to Bavaria. Bayern now enjoy around 75 percent possession in most league games and humbled Werder Bremen 7-0 in north Germany ten days ago. Guardiola picked up his first title with Bayern in August's UEFA Super Cup when Chelsea were beaten in Prague as the Spaniard enjoyed his eighth win in 16 matches against his rival Jose Mourinho, the former Real Madrid manager. The Bavarians extracted penalty shoot-out revenge after Chelsea had beaten them on spot-kicks to lift the 2012 Champions League title at Munich's Allianz Arena. With the holders through to the German Cup quarter-finals and having reached the Champions League's knock-out stage, Bayern are on course to defend all three titles they won last season. Guardiola has yet to have his full squad available with the likes of stars Javi Martinez, Thiago, Goetze, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben having all spent time on the sidelines recovering from injuries. Having beaten Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund 2-1 at Wembley in May's first all-German Champions League final, the Germans are again flying the flag in Europe with another first. After Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke joined Munich in qualifying for the knock-out phase, Germany will have four teams in the Champions League's knock-out stages for the first time in 2014. At international level, Germany have drawn Portugal, Ghana and the United States Group G at Brazil 2014 with the Germans amongst the favourites to claim their fourth World Cup title having finished third in at South Africa 2010. The Germans' attacking prowess is undeniable with the likes of Goezte alongside Arsenal's Mesut Ozil, Bayern's Thomas Mueller and Dortmund's Marco Reus. But their defence, traditionally Germany's strength, has repeatedly come under fire in 2013. A weakened Germany crashed to a 4-3 defeat to the USA, coached by ex-Germany boss Jurgen Klinsmann, in Washington in June, then fought back from 2-0 down for a 3-3 draw at home to lowly Paraguay in August. The Germans rounded up their Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign with a 5-3 win over Sweden in Stockholm to finish with nine wins from ten games, the 4-4 draw with Sweden in Berlin in October 2012 being the only blot."

""All four German clubs in the last 16, that has never happened before. Our league can celebrate a historic triumph!"" wrote German daily Bild. On three occasions three German teams, Dortmund, Schalke and Bayern, have reached the last 16 in 1997-98, 2004-05 and 2012-13, but this is the first time since the Champions League started in 1992 that four German teams have reached the knock-out phase. The Germans have the joint biggest contingent in the knock-out stages alongside English quartet Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, while three Spanish teams, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid are also through. On Wednesday, Dortmund needed a dramatic late goal from Kevin Grosskreutz to seal a 2-1 win at Marseille to finish as winners of Group F and had been just three minutes from going out of the competition after Napoli's 2-0 win at home to Arsenal. Pep Guardiola's Bayern also went through as group winners, despite losing 3-2 at home to Manchester City on Tuesday, winning five of their six matches. Schalke finished second in Group E after a 2-0 win at home to Swiss champions FC Basel, while Bayer Leverkusen were second in Group A behind Manchester United. ""It is very positive, especially in the way the sides went through,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""It shows the quality that Germany can offer."" The draw for the last 16 of the Champions League will be held at 1100 (GMT) in Nyon, Switzerland, on Monday. In total, the German quartet have picked up 93.55 million euros (US$129m) in prize money. Defending champions Bayern lead the way with 28.76 million euros for appearance and prize money followed by Dortmund with 24.85m, Leverkusen on 21.43m and Schalke 18.51m. For winning last season's Champions League title, Bayern picked up 55.05m euros."
321,12/12/2013,13:12,Football: Schwarzer delighted with Champions Leaue debut,Chelsea goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer said he had fulfilled a lifetime's ambition by finally making his Champions League debut aged 41.,"Schwarzer, standing in for the rested Petr Cech, got his first taste of Europe's elite club competition in Chelsea's final Group E fixture against Steaua Bucharest on Wednesday. The Australian kept a clean-sheet as Chelsea cruised to a 1-0 win over the Romanians which ensured they finished top of the group. It was an important result for Chelsea, but the significance of a chilly evening at Stamford Bridge was even greater for Schwarzer, who became the oldest Champions League debutant at 41 years and 66 days, and also the second oldest player ever to appear in the Champions League. After spending much of his career with Middlesbrough and Fulham, Schwarzer joined Chelsea on a free transfer in pre-season as back-up to Cech. This was just his third appearance for Jose Mourinho's team and he admitted it was one of the most memorable of his illustrious career. ""That was huge,"" Schwarzer told the Daily Mail. ""My wife always says I'm unemotional. I'm very German, she says, in that respect but I was elated, after the game especially. ""The manager had faith in me and trusted me and gave me this opportunity to fulfil a lifetime's ambition to play at the highest level, in the Champions League. ""I realised a couple of years ago that you can never say never and that you can keep hoping and that things will maybe swing your way. You've just got to keep doing the right things and working hard towards it."" As group winners, Chelsea will be seeded for the draw on Monday and will face one of AC Milan, Galatasaray, Olympiakos, Bayer Leverkusen or Zenit St Petersburg in the last 16. And after watching the Champions League on television for so many years, Schwarzer is just thrilled to be part of a club capable of advancing deep into the competition. ""It's exciting,"" said Schwarzer. ""I've always been sat watching these draws from afar so I feel very privileged to be in this position. ""I want to make the most of it. I'm loving the journey thus far and I want to continue on the journey. ""Demand is huge at this club to be successful and I want to enjoy that aspect of it. ""I'm enjoying the expectation of winning every single game which is as footballers what you want to do. ""I want to win trophies. That's why I've come to Chelsea, the same as every other player here and every supporter of this club."" Despite keeping a clean-sheet against Steaua, Schwarzer, who recently retired from international football, expects to be back on the bench when Crystal Palace visit the Bridge in the Premier League this weekend. ""Petr will definitely play at the weekend, for sure,"" Schwarzer added. ""As far as I'm concerned he's No.1, he's a world-class goalkeeper and he will go on to bigger and better things. I work with him every day and he's a top guy."""
322,12/12/2013,01:44,Football: German game reaps reward of revamp - DFB coach,"European football giants Germany have not won an international trophy since Euro 1996, but a carefully crafted strategy to develop young stars is paying dividends says respected coach Frank Wormuth.","The German game is enjoying a purple patch at club level with the re-emergence of a strong Bayern Munich, who defeated compatriots Borussia Dortmund to win the Champions League last May. With the 2014 World Cup looming, Wormuth says Germany is preparing to reap a rich harvest after a decade of planning involving the bottom-up revamping of the national game. Wormuth suggested that some of Germany's rivals -- he named England as a prime example -- are by contrast losing ground. ""We have been patient, whereas in England the league do not like to be told what to do by the federation. They are not on the same wavelength,"" Wormuth told AFP. ""Maybe we are missing a little Brazilian pizzazz -- but we Germans are very structured. We looked at our recent record and said, 'this can't go on.'"" After three World Cup titles -- the last in 1990 -- and three European championships ""we were having no more success. We lacked a pool of young emerging talents, new coaches. ""So we changed things around -- we have been working from the grassroots up to the top,"" Wormuth said Wednesday at a meeting of the Footecon football trade fair in Rio. Wormuth, under-20 coach with the German Football Federation (DFB), says former Germany coach Jurgen Klinsmann made a conscious decision ahead of the 2006 World Cup to overhaul old methods which had grown stale, building on early work instigated from 1999 by then-Bayer Leverkusen general manager Rainer Calmund and DFB Director of Youth Development Dietrich Weise. That involved the creation of a huge network nationwide of talent centres with DFB-salaried coaches hunting down raw talent at youth level and nurturing the players as they moved up the age scale to the brink of the professional game. ""We can thank Klinsmann as he sowed some of the seeds that are now blossoming,"" said Wormuth, whose brief playing career at the second division level included a spell playing alongside current Germany coach Joachim Loew at Freiburg. Wormuth proudly pointed to the emergence of several current stars from a system which now runs the rule over as many as 600,000 youngsters each year. Bayern and Germany star Thomas Muller is one, another is Chelsea newcomer Andre Schurrle, whom the Londoners signed from Bayer Leverkusen earlier this year. Wormuth said that after Euro 1996, as old stars passed their sell-by dates, many figures in the game did not want to accept the need for wholesale overhaul, but ""after the results started to appear they began to accept it"" and young coaches such as Dortmund's Jurgen Klopp began making a name for themselves. ""Our goal in Germany is straightforward -- talent must not be allowed to fall through the net. It must be nurtured,"" Wormuth said. Although German football has invested around 100 million euros in the system, he says the net cost should be much lower. ""You send a scout (to a youth game) and when the talent emerges the clubs ultimately can make money on their investment. (German) stadiums are full, so money is coming in."" A further positive by-product is that the proportion of young homegrown talents in the Bundesliga far exceeds that of the foreigner-dominated English Premier League. At the last World Cup in South Africa, 19 of Germany's 23-man squad had come through club youth academies. They finished third, beating Uruguay in the third-place playoff after falling to eventual champions Spain in the semi-finals. ""Now to our next goal,"" Wormuth said. ""We want that fourth (World Cup) star on our shirts!"""
323,11/12/2013,23:39,Football: Schalke down 10-man Basel to reach last 16,Schalke confirmed their place in the Champions League knockout phase with a 2-0 home win against 10-man FC Basel on Wednesday to finish second behind Chelsea in Group E.,"Goals after the break by Germany's Julian Draxler and a strange second from Cameroon midfielder Joel Matip put Schalke in the last 16 to ease the pressure on under-fire coach Jens Keller. The 43-year-old has been told a decision on his future will be made over the winter break in the wake of the Royal Blues' erratic form this season. Having been knocked out of the German Cup last week and trailing leaders Bayern Munich by 17 points in the Bundesliga, Keller would have been set for dismissal after a year in charge had Schalke failed to go through. Schalke's successful qualification will see them earn 4.5 million euros (US$6.2m). ""No one can understand the pressure the team and I were under,"" said Keller. ""The joy in winning a game like that is huge. ""No one had given us any credit. ""The fact we have reached the knock-out phase is hugely important for the club, especially financially."" The win comes at a cost for Schalke as both Draxler and captain Benedikt Hoewedes face spells on the sidelines having suffered torn leg ligaments. The Royal Blues had to win to go through and faced 10 men for an hour as FC Basel had centre-back Ivan Ivanov, who cleared an early shot off the line, sent off for holding back Schalke's Adam Szalai on 31 minutes. Hoewedes was lucky not to be shown a red card, instead of the yellow he received, on 29 minutes, as he injured himself with a rugby-style tackle on Basel captain Marco Streller, who would have been clear on goal. The breakthrough Schalke desperately needed came on 50 minutes when Farfan swung in a cross and found Draxler unmarked at the far post to slam home his shot and give the Royal Blues the lead. Schalke secured their passage to the knockout phase seven minutes later when their second goal arrived in bizarre fashion.

""I had my eyes on the linesman, who didn't react. I was suprised by that,"" admitted Matip. Basel coach Murat Yakin was left protesting incredulously on the sidelines, but the defeat means the Swiss champions finish third in the group and drop into the Europa League. ""We started the game well, our passing was good, we kept calm and had a lot of possession,"" said Yakin after the final whistle. ""Unfortunately, we then had a player sent off, which unbalanced the team.""

The 43-year-old has been told a decison on his future will be made over the winter break in the wake of the Royal Blues' erratic form this season. Having been knocked out of the German Cup last week and trailing leaders Bayern Munich by 17 points in the Bundesliga, Keller would have been set for dismissal after a year in charge had Schalke failed to go through. ""We knew what was at stake,"" said Matip. ""This victory was also for our coach, it's a difficult time for him right now. ""We want to continue working hard and try to be more consistent with our performances."" The Royal Blues had to win to go through, and they faced 10 men for just under an hour as FC Basel had centre-back Ivan Ivanov, who cleared an early shot off the line, sent off for holding back Schalke's Adam Szalai on 31 minutes. The Hungarian striker had only just replaced captain Benedikt Hoewedes, who went off with a hamstring injury just approaching the half-hour mark. Hoewedes was lucky not to be shown a red card, instead of the yellow he received, on 29 minutes, as he injured himself with a rugby-style tackle on Basel captain Marco Streller, who would have been clear on goal. Schalke had the best chance of the first half though, as Jefferson Farfan's cross was cleared onto the crossbar by Basel defender Taulant Xhaka on 12 minutes. The ball fell to Draxler, who squared it to 18-year-old Max Meyer, but his shot was cleared off the line by Ivanov. The breakthrough Schalke desperately needed came on 50 minutes when Farfan swung in a cross and found Draxler unmarked at the far post to slam home his shot and give the Royal Blues the lead. Schalke secured their passage to the knockout phase seven minutes later when their second goal arrived in bizarre fashion.

As well as eliminating Shakhtar, the result gave United three home victories in the group phase for the first time since they last won the competition in 2007-08. Manager David Moyes can now look forward to a favourable tie in the last 16 when the draw is made next Monday, while Shakhtar slip into the Europa League due to Bayer Leverkusen's 1-0 win over Real Sociedad in the other group game. ""We wanted to top the group and we have,"" said Moyes. ""I was tough with them at half-time, but we needed to be -- we need to win games. A club like Manchester United has to be trying to win the trophy; that's their job. ""You have to get better as the tournament goes on. It's a tough competition, a hard one, but we will take it one game at a time."" Shakhtar coach Mircea Lucescu said: ""The first half and the second half were like two different games. ""In the first half we could easily have gone 2-0 up, but the second half was totally different. The players became tired physically and mentally, although they created a lot of chances."" Having already seen their team beaten twice in the space of a week, there was an understandable nervousness about the Old Trafford crowd that Shakhtar seemed eager to exploit. Alex Teixeira could have put the visitors ahead in the 12th minute after running onto a pass from fellow Brazilian Taison, but he sent the ball inches wide of United goalkeeper David de Gea's left-hand post. Andriy Pyatov had already saved from Jones by that stage and the Shakhtar goalkeeper also had to box away a half-volley from tournament debutant Adnan Januzaj, but United continued to look vulnerable. One-time United target Douglas Costa slashed a shot wide after Alexander Buttner committed himself too early, while Alex Teixeira could only fire straight at De Gea after ghosting past Ryan Giggs, Rio Ferdinand and Jonny Evans. Giggs and Ferdinand looked particularly ponderous, both conceding possession in dangerous positions, but gradually United roused themselves. Wayne Rooney, back in the team after a domestic suspension, brushed the side-netting with a free-kick, while Ashley Young spurned two excellent opportunities prior to half-time. The first saw him collect a lofted pass from Giggs before lobbing narrowly wide with only Pyatov to beat and he then sliced badly off-target with his left foot after being teed up by Rooney. The visitors threatened again early in the second period, Yaroslav Rakitskiy seeing a shot deflected wide by Jones after a corner ran right across the United box, and news that Leverkusen had taken the lead in Spain did not aid the hosts' cause. They improved, however, with Pyatov palming away an in-swinging Young free-kick and repelling a volley from Shinji Kagawa before Rooney feathered a chip onto the roof of the net. Moyes's decision to introduce Robin van Persie and Tom Cleverley energised the crowd further and in the 67th minute, United scored. Van Persie's right-wing corner took a glancing blow off a defender at the near post and sat up invitingly for Jones, who smartly readjusted his body position and lashed home a low volley. Cleverley volleyed over as United looked to extend their lead and Van Persie dinked a shot wide in stoppage time, but Jones's strike proved enough to settle the game and begin the process of repairing Old Trafford's once formidable reputation."

328,10/12/2013,02:25,Football: Destiny in Dortmund's hands for Marseille decider,Borussia Dortmund can keep alive their bid to return to the Champions League final for the second straight season with victory over Marseille at the Velodrome on Wednesday.,"The Bundesliga side will reach the knockout stages next February by taking maximum points regardless of what happens in the second Group H fixture between Napoli and Arsenal in Italy. Napoli, who are on nine points with Dortmund and three behind Arsenal, must beat the Premier League pacesetters by three clear goals, should Dortmund also win in France. However it will be the German club who go through with Rafa Benitez's team due to their superior head-to-head record against both clubs. Arsenal will go through with a draw or a defeat by two goals or less. Marseille meanwhile are in turmoil, and fired coach Elie Baup following their 1-0 home defeat against Nantes on Friday, replacing him with Jose Anigo. They cannot even dream of the consolation of Europa League football in the New Year as they are pointless following five straight defeats. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp looked on as his side suffered their fourth league defeat of the season on Saturday when they slumped 1-0 at home to second-placed Bayer Leverkusen but the price was heavier than just three points. Germany midfielder Sven Bender is ruled out after limping off with an ankle injury while Turkey international Nuri Sahin is doubtful after slightly tearing an ankle ligament. ""We lost 1-0, but that's actually the least of our problems,"" Klopp said following the match. Dortmund are already withouth midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, defender Mats Hummels, Neven Subotic and Marcel Schmelzer as Klopp's injury worries show no sign of easing. He is also down to his fourth choice at centre-back, having played Bender out of position in the 3-1 win over Napoli on matchday five, as Manuel Friedrich is cup-tied and Hummels injured. ""We now find ourselves in the situation where we are constantly having to react,"" said Klopp. ""But necessity is the mother of invention, so we'll see what happens. ""We have certainly had easier moments, but we have to fight on."" Caretaker manager Anigo takes charge of his first match back at the helm of Marseille after a four year spell between 2001 and 2005, preceded before then as sporting director. The club, who are fifth in Ligue 1 and 13 points back of Paris Saint-Germain, parted ways with Baup following their sixth league defeat of the season on Friday."
329,10/12/2013,02:05,Football: Former winners Milan and Dortmund look to reach Last 16,Former champions AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund go into their final group matches needing a result in their respective games to ensure they continue their campaign for the trophy in the New Year.,"Group E Schalke 04 (GER) v FC Basel (SUI) Schalke and Basel really have everything to play for in a decisive outing for the German and Swiss sides. Basel are currently on eight points, one behind already-qualified Chelsea and one ahead of Schalke, meaning they could still finish atop the group should they win and Chelsea be held to a draw or lose. Schalke have to go for the victory to ensure they edge the Swiss out of the second qualifying spot in the group. One bad omen for Basel is that the last time they travelled to face German opposition, they suffered a 7-0 hammering at the hands of Bayern Munich in the 2012 round of 16 second leg. Chelsea (ENG) v Steaua Bucharest (ROM) Chelsea have already qualified for the knock-out stages, but still need to beat the Romanians to guarantee pole position in Group E. Beaten 3-2 by Stoke in English Premier League action on the weekend, the west London side have now conceded six goals in their last two games. Coach Jose Mourinho reacted by giving his players a rare day off after the Stoke defeat, saying it would be ""good for their heads"". Steaua are yet to register a victory in Group E, having notched up three draws and two defeats in their five games. In fact the Romanians last won in Champions League action way back in September 2006, against Dynamo Kiev, a 22-game winless streak equalling that of Spartak Moscow (December 2000-November 2006). Group F Napoli (ITA) v Arsenal (ENG) Arsene Wenger's Arsenal will clinch qualification, and top spot, with a draw or a victory in Naples. The Premier League table-toppers will also go through with a defeat by two goals or less. Wenger's side enjoy a good record in Italy and with 12 points, are three ahead of Borussia Dortmund and Rafa Benitez's Napoli. The Italian side must beat Arsenal by three clear goals, should Dortmund also win their match against Marseille - who are yet to pick up a point from five losses in five matches. Marseille (FRA) v Borussia Dortmund (GER) Victory for Jurgen Klopp's Borussia Dortmund over Marseille will keep their hopes alive of a return to the Champions League final for the second straight season. The Bundesliga side will reach the knockout stages by taking maximum points regardless of what happens between Napoli and Arsenal in Italy. Should Dortmund draw, they will progress if Napoli do not win. Dortmund suffered their fourth league defeat of the season on the weekend, a 1-0 loss at home to second-placed Bayer Leverkusen, with Germany midfielder Sven Bender now ruled out of the Marseille game and Turkey international Nuri Sahin a doubt. The winless French club go into the match in disarray, coach Elie Baup replaced last week by long-time Marseille employee Jose Anigo. Group G Austria Vienna (AUT) v Zenit St Petersburg (RUS) The Austrian outfit will be bidding to bow out of the group stage with a face saving first win. However, the Russian side are sure to go for the victory that would ensure they progress even if Porto beat group winners Atletico Madrid in Spain. The hosts, though, are far from sure performers at home losing three European matches in a row already an unwanted team record. Zenit -- who despite being down to 10 men drew 0-0 in the home clash with Austria Vienna -- are effective away from home and have won three of their four away games in this season's competition. Zenit's Belgian centreback Nicolas Lombaerts told uefa.com that he believes the Russians are yet to show their best form. ""We are motivated because we did not manage to qualify last season. I think we gave it away, we gave away points,"" he said. ""It is in our own hands now. It would be a shame if we give it away again. We have to give 100% for one more game and then we should be able to achieve it."" Atletico Madrid (ESP) v Porto (POR) The Spanish side have sailed serenely through qualifying and are guaranteed top spot even before hosting former champions Porto. In a delightful twist of fate Atletico can consign Porto to the Europa League just as the Portuguese side did to them in the 2008/09 campaign and the 2009/10 season to boot. Atletico beat Porto 2-1 in Portugal in their first meeting this season and are likely to repeat the dose again and confirm their status as a danger to the more established sides for the trophy this term. Group H AC Milan (ITA) v Ajax (NED) Milan have had a pretty underwhelming season thusfar and failure to get the draw they need at home to Ajax and secure their place in the Last 16 would all but certainly signal the exit of coach Massimiliano Allegri. For the second consecutive season Milan's run-in to Christmas is anything but festive: they currently sit ninth in Serie A, 22 points behind leaders Juventus and 14 adrift of the first Champions League qualifying spot. They will be looking to Mario Balotelli to be on form both physically and mentally against an Ajax side that despite their deserved 2-1 win at home to Barcelona in the previous round of matches has a woeful away record in the competition having not won on their last six trips abroad. Barcelona (ESP) v Celtic (SCO) The Catalan giants require a point against the Scottish champions to ensure they finish top of the group. Barca will again be without the injured Lionel Messi, Victor Valdes and Dani Alves, but Jordi Alba -- who scored an injury time minute winner when the two sides met at the Camp Nou last season -- returned in the Cup win last Friday against Cartagena after three months out and is expected to start. Celtic have nothing but pride to play for as not even a win would get them Europa League football in the New Year."
330,09/12/2013,02:11,Football: City face uphill task to end Bayern's record run,Coach Manuel Pellegrini admits Manchester City face an uphill task to break Bayern Munich's record winning streak in the Champions League in Tuesday's battle for top spot in Group D.,"Bayern are on record runs in both the Bundesliga and Champions League and their 3-1 win at CSKA Moscow a fortnight ago was their tenth straight victory in Europe, breaking Barcelona's previous record. Bayern have turned the Allianz Arena into something of a fortress of late, winning all 18 home matches in all competitions since their last defeat in Munich last March at the hands of Arsenal. Both City and Bayern sides are through to the knock-out stages and all that remains to be settled is who will finish top of the group. The defending champions have won all of their five group games so far, including a dominant 3-1 win last October at City, who are three points behind the German side. Pellegrini's side would need to better that result at the Allianz Arena to knock Pep Guardiola's Munich from top spot. City have already pulled off a landmark achievement by reaching the Champions League's knock-out stages, at the third attempt, with a 4-2 home win over Czech outfit Viktoria Pilsen at home a fortnight ago. ""We have qualified for the next round and this is very good,"" said Pellegrini. ""It would be better to be first in the group, but we have already played against a very strong Bayern Munich team. ""They played better than us (in Manchester) and it will be very difficult to beat them 3-0 at their ground. ""But we will try to do a very good match and we will try to win."" Despite beating CSKA Moscow and Pilsen on the road in Europe this season, City's away record in the Premier League is poor with only two wins in eight away games, including Saturday's 1-1 draw at Southampton. Pellegrini is hoping to have Spanish playmaker David Silva back from injury. The Spanish attacking midfielder has missed City's last five matches due to a calf injury. Germany captain Philipp Lahm could return for Bayern having missed the last few weeks with a hamstring injury, but Bayern are definitely without winger Arjen Robben. The Dutchman is recovering from a deep thigh cut, but the European champions showed no signs of missing Robben, who had scored in each of his four matches before injury struck, when they romped to a 7-0 win at Werder Bremen on Saturday. It was the Bavarian giants' 40th unbeaten Bundesliga match since losing to Bayer Leverkusen in October 2012 and Guardiola said he was 'honoured' by his team's performance. France's Franck Ribery showed he is back at his best after a rib injury with two goals and two assists in an outstanding display. Despite becoming the first German team to win the treble of European, league and cup titles under Jupp Heynckes last season, his successor Guardiola is ensuring Bayern maintain their high standards. ""The coach never lets up,"" said centre-back Jerome Boateng. ""We were focused from the start (in Bremen) and we never let up, results like that happen when you play at such a frenzy."" Bayern face more international competition after the City game as they travel to Morocco to play in the Club World Cup and will want to finish their Champions League group campaign on a high. ""The team is happy, we have a great mentality, but we have to keep playing at that level,"" said Ribery with an eye on the City clash."
331,09/12/2013,02:05,Football: Now-or-never for Champions League last-16 hopefuls,"Holders Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Barcelona are already through to the Champions League round of 16.","Eight other places are up for grabs when the groups end on Tuesday and Wednesday. AFP Sports looks at what's at stake on Tuesday: Group A Manchester United (ENG) v Shakhtar Donetsk (UKR) Smarting from their fifth Premier League defeat of the season, already qualified Manchester United host Shakhtar seeking some much needed European solace. United's second successive home defeat, a 1-0 reverse to Newcastle on Saturday, has taken much of the gloss off their superb 5-0 rout of Borussia Dortmund a fortnight ago, a demolition which sealed their passage to the knockout stages. David Moyes will want a quick and sharp response from his team which he said had lacked sparkle against Newcastle, a loss which left the Premier League titleholders 13 points off leaders Arsenal. A draw is essential to take Group A honours and give United a much needed boost ahead of the crammed Christmas domestic programme. Shakhtar, in buoyant form at home -- they lead their league by five points -- must match Bayer Leverkusen's result to qualify. Victory for the Ukrainians would deprive Moyes' men of top spot. United are boosted by the return of Wayne Rooney, suspended for Saturday's game. Real Sociedad (ESP) v Bayer Leverkusen (GER) Leverkusen will qualify for the last 16 at the expense of Shakhtar as long as they see off winless Real and the Ukrainians lose at Old Trafford. A draw will be enough for Leverkusen if Shakhtar lose thanks to their superior head-to-head. Leverkusen have painful memories of their last trip to Spain, a 7-1 drubbing at Barcelona in the 2011/2012 round of 16 -- their heaviest ever European defeat. Bayer go into the tie on the back of a hard fought 1-0 win over Borussia Dortmund to leave them four points shy of Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich. Group B Galatasaray (TUR) v Juventus (ITA) A draw would be enough to see Juventus through to the knock-out stages, given their better head-to-head record against Copenhagen than Galatasaray's, but even a draw is a tall order in the Istanbul cauldron the Turks call home. It is made even more so by the fact that the Turin club were dealt a severe blow with the news that influential playmaker Andrea Pirlo will miss what is their most important test of the season so far with knee ligament damage, which is expected to sideline him until the New Year -- by which time Juve's Champions League campaign could be a fading memory. FC Copenhagen (DEN)v Real Madrid (ESP) Copenhagen have only pride left to play for as even an unlikely victory over Real would leave them in third place in the group and out of the competition. Real, on the other hand, have cruised through their campaign so far, scoring at will, most recently with the 4-1 drubbing of Galatasaray which, ironically, rekindled rivals Juventus' hopes of progressing. Despite being already qualified, coach Carlo Ancelotti is expected to line out with stars Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo. Group C Benfica (POR) v Paris Saint Germain (FRA) The hosts have more to play for than the visitors, who are already assured of being group winners. Benfica, though, must better the result of Greek side Olympiakos if they are to reach the last-16. Benfica do have a bit of a hold over the French visitors in that they have beaten them in Lisbon on the last two occasions they have played there. Much could depend on what sort of side PSG coach Laurent Blanc selects, whether he opts to rest several first team regulars or throws them all in as they seek to better their overall points haul of 15 -- they presently have 13 -- from last year's group stage. Lisbon is hosting the Champions League final but it is unlikely that Benfica will emulate Bayern Munich in appearing in a final on home turf given their qualification is out of their hands. Olympiakos (GRE) v Anderlecht (BEL) The Greek side should logically seal their place in the knockout stages at home to a Belgian outfit which has garnered just one point from their five games -- albeit a draw with PSG -- and whom the hosts trounced 3-0 in Belgium with Kostas Mitroglou scoring a hat-trick. Coached by former Spanish great Michel, who was part of the Real Madrid team that overturned a 3-0 deficit in a UEFA Cup second round clash in the 1984/85 campaign to win 6-1 in the return leg, Olympiakos are bidding to reach the Last 16 for the first time since 2009/10. Anderlecht will finish bottom of their group for the seventh successive season they have competed in the competition. Group D Bayern Munich (GER) v Manchester City (ENG) Defending champions Bayern, buoyed by a 7-0 demolition of Werder Bremen on Saturday which extended their unbeaten Bundesliga run to 40 matches, are already through to the last-16. They will win the group with a draw or with a defeat that is no bigger than their 3-1 away victory in Manchester in the teams' first game. Bayern have won 14 of their last 16 home Champions League fixtures, most recently a 5-0 success against Victoria Pilsen on matchday three while their 3-1 win at CSKA Moscow a fortnight ago broke Barcelona's record for consecutive wins with their tenth straight victory. City coach Manuel Pellegrini is hoping to have Spanish playmaker David Silva back from injury. The Spanish attacking midfielder has missed City's last five matches due to a calf injury. Germany captain Philipp Lahm could return for Bayern having missed the last few weeks with a hamstring injury, but Bayern are definitely without winger Arjen Robben who has a thigh problem. Viktoria Pilsen (CZE) v CSKA Moscow (RUS) Neither side can make the last-16, leaving a battle to finish third and claim a spot in the Europa League knockout rounds. The Russians will come third with a draw or with a defeat that is not greater than their 3-2 home success against Viktoria. Pilsen have lost both home games so far in Group D without scoring a goal but had won ten of their preceding 11 home fixtures in UEFA competition, including three in a row in this season's qualifying rounds. Before losing at Bayern (3-0) and City (5-2), CSKA were on a run of just two losses in 11 away outings in UEFA competition."
332,08/12/2013,19:27,Football: Wolves floor Freiburg to extend unbeaten run,VfL Wolfsburg extended their unbeaten run to eight matches with a 3-0 win at strugglers Freiburg on Sunday to climb up to fifth in the Bundesliga table.,"Wolves raced into a 2-0 lead after only 11 minutes as Germany Under-21 forward Maximilian Arnold netted with a deft touch before ex-Bayern Munich star Luiz Gustavo laid the ball off for Croatia's Ivica Olic to blast home. Freiburg squandered a couple of clear chances before Wolfsburg's Germany defender Marcel Schafer came off the bench for Olic to score their third in added time. Freiburg remain third from bottom with a third straight defeat and to make matters worse they had French midfielder Francis Coquelin, on loan from Arsenal, carried off with a suspected broken ankle just after the break. Hertha Berlin stayed seventh and kept hosts Eintracht Braunschweig rooted to the bottom of the table with a 2-0 away win. Colombia striker Adrian Ramos headed Berlin into a first-half lead before 20-year-old midfielder Tolga Cigerci added a late second with his first for the club. On Saturday, France star Franck Ribery produced a commanding display as Bayern Munich extended their record unbeaten Bundesliga run to 40 matches with a 7-0 away romp at Werder Bremen. Ribery boosted his claim for the 2013 world footballer of the year award, which will be announced on January 13, by creating two goals and scoring twice in the rout. Bayern, who last lost in the German league in October 2012, produced their biggest win so far under Pep Guardiola, cutting Bremen's defence to tatters. The victory was short of the Bundesliga's 57-year-old record of 9-0 for an away win and was Werder's heaviest home league defeat. Bremen coach Robin Dutt kept the team on the pitch for a stern lecture as they dropped to 14th after just two wins in their last 10 games. Belgium's Daniel van Buyten, Croatia's Mario Mandzukic plus Germany's Thomas Mueller and Mario Goetze also joined Ribery on the scoresheet after Bremen scored an own goal. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen stayed four points behind Bayern with a hard-fought 1-0 win at third-placed Borussia Dortmund, who now find themselves six points behind Leverusen and ten points behind Munich. South Korea striker Son Heung-Min hit the 18th-minute winner after Leverkusen's attack pounced on a mistake by Dortmund defender Manuel Friedrich for Son to score his fifth goal in his last three games against Borussia.

""There are three league games left this year, we have nothing more to give away and we all want to win,"" said Klopp. ""We have 31 points, which isn't bad, nevertheless we have lost points along the way and that has hurt us."" Should Dortmund win and Bayern win or draw at Werder Bremen, to extend their unbeaten Bundesliga run to a record 40 matches, the Bavarians would open a seven-point gap at the top. Leverkusen, coached by ex-Liverpool defender Sami Hyypia, were thrashed 5-0 at home by Manchester United in the Champions League ten days ago and are eager to restore battered confidence against Borussia Dortmund. ""They have the chance to make amends against us, but we are at home and we have ambitions of reaching a high position in the table,"" said Klopp. ""A win against Leverkusen is always something special."" Hyypia was guarded about his side's chances at Westfalenstadion. ""It is always hard to take something from Dortmund,"" said the ex-Finland star.

Bayern already have injury concerns with captain Philipp Lahm and star midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger both out, but France winger Franck Ribery should be back in Bremen after a rib injury. Robben was left with a cut to the bone on his right knee having been stretchered off after scoring in Wednesday's 2-0 German Cup win at Augsburg which put Bayern in the quarter-finals.

The European champions last lost in the Bundesliga in October 2012 and are already in the last 16 of the Champions League, have booked their quarter-final berth in the German Cup on Wednesday and are four points clear in the league.

""There is this stupid debate about how dominant we are, which is superficial and implies we should win games like this, just by turning up."" But Bayern are certainly able to see off most of their Bundesliga rivals without too much effort, as they proved in last Saturday's 2-0 lacklustre win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Bayern are used to around 75 percent possession in league games and Werder coach Robin Dutt said there is no secret to beating the Bavarians. ""The first trick is to run, the second is to run some more and the third is to keep running,"" he quipped. Having dropped to third after losing back-to-back league matches, Dortmund can regain second place by beating Bayer Leverkusen at home in Saturday's key game. The hosts are waiting on the fitness of midfielders Sven Bender, who broke his nose against Napoli, and Nuri Sahin, who has a leg injury. Germany winger Marco Reus, who has a bruised calf, is improving, with a decision to be made after the final training session. ""There will be no excuses on Saturday,"" said Klopp, whose side will also need to win at Marseille on Wednesday to reach the last 16 of the Champions League.

On Saturday, Bayern Munich extended their unbeaten Bundesliga record to 39 games with a workmanlike 2-0 home win over bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig with Arjen Robben scoring both goals. Having set a new Champions League record of ten consecutive victories with their 3-1 win at CSKA Moscow on Wednesday, Bayern again cruised to victory in Munich. Even with hamstring-victim Philipp Lahm, plus France's Franck Ribery and Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger on the walking wounded list, Bayern had too much fire-power for Braunschweig. Borussia Dortmund picked up their first win in three league games with a hard-fought 3-1 success at ten-man Mainz 05 to stay third and seven points behind Bayern. Dortmund took the lead on 70 minutes when Gabon's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang fired home a superb free-kick, but the lead lasted just four minutes before Cameroon's Eric Choupo-Moting slotted home a penalty. Mainz were reduced to 10 men when Colombia's Elkin Soto was sent off for stopping the ball going into the net with his hand and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski fired home the 79th-minute penalty.

Mid-table Werder Bremen warmed up for next Saturday's visit of Bayern with a point at Hoffenheim in an eight-goal thriller as sub Philipp Bargfrede -- with the Bremen squad number 44 -- equalised in the 91st-minute to make it 4-4. Augsburg -- who face holders Bayern on Wednesday in the third round of the German Cup -- played out a goalless draw in the capital against Hertha Berlin.

Hungary midfielder Szabolcs Huszti then swung in a superb free-kick on 68 minutes for his sixth goal of the season as Hanover picked up their first win since September to go ninth. Frankfurt were reduced to ten men for the final half hour when midfielder Martin Lanig was sent off for a harsh second yellow card after a tackle on Poland's Artur Sobiech following a previous booking. The defeat leaves Frankfurt 15th and just above the relegation places having also posted their last Bundesliga win in September. On Sunday evening, fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach host third-from-bottom Freiburg looking for their fifth-straight win. On Saturday, Bayern Munich extended their unbeaten Bundesliga record to 39 games with a workmanlike 2-0 home win over bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig with Arjen Robben scoring both goals. Having set a new Champions League record of ten consecutive victories with their 3-1 win at CSKA Moscow on Wednesday, Bayern again cruised to victory in Munich. Even with hamstring-victim Philipp Lahm, plus France's Franck Ribery and Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger on the walking wounded list, Bayern had too much fire-power for Braunschweig. Borussia Dortmund picked up their first win in three league games with a hard-fought 3-1 success at ten-man Mainz 05 to stay third and seven points behind Bayern. Dortmund took the lead on 70 minutes when Gabon's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang fired home a superb free-kick, but the lead lasted just four minutes before Cameroon's Eric Choupo-Moting slotted home a penalty. Mainz were reduced to 10 men when Colombia's Elkin Soto was sent off for stopping the ball going into the net with his hand and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski fired home the 79th-minute penalty. Lewandowski then made sure of the points with his second penalty when he converted the 94th-minute spot kick after left-back Erik Durm was up-ended. Bayer Leverkusen bounced back from their 5-0 drubbing at home to Manchester United in the Champions League on Wednesday -- their worst home result in Europe -- with a 3-0 win at home to Nuremberg to stay second.

Son, 21, who hit his first Bundesliga hat-trick against Hamburg three weeks ago, struck as he twice blasted home crosses from team-mate Gonzalo Castro on 36 and 76 minutes. The South Korean star now has six goals in 11 league games in his first season at Bayer. Former Germany striker Stefan Kiessling hit Leverkusen's second after a superb back-heel from midfielder Jens Hegeler. Hyypia's Leverkusen, who are four-points behind leaders Bayern Munich, face a key Bundesliga battle on Saturday when they travel to third-placed Borussia Dortmund. ""We took some time to get into the game and get our confidence back,"" said the ex-Liverpool defender. ""It was important to win. Preparing for the game wasn't so easy after the Man Utd game. ""We showed character after such a disappointment."" The win brought some cheer to Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller, the ex-Germany star, who is in hospital being treated for kidney stones."

""The best days are still to come and there will be even better days,"" said United manager Moyes on Wednesday in Leverkusen. ""The main thing is that we have qualified and stayed top of the group, it's great to score five goals away from home, but I want it to be something we do regularly, not just every now and then. ""To come to Germany and win 5-0 is superb, Leverkusen have a good home record which puts it in perspective."" A volley from right-back Antonio Valencia and an own goal from Leverkusen centre-back Emir Spahic gave United a commanding early lead before defender Jonny Evans added a third with an hour gone. England defender Chris Smalling added their fourth on 77 minutes after he met Wayne Rooney's chip at the back post. Nani then latched on to Giggs's superb long ball for a fine solo goal for the fifth on 88 minutes with the Leverkusen defence in tatters. Leverkusen deservedly suffered their first home defeat in 14 games since losing 2-1 to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga back in March. Bayer need to win at Real Sociedad in a fortnight and hope United beat Shakhtar Donestk at Old Trafford to reach the knock-out phase. England striker Rooney, who played a hand in the first four goals, and ever-green Welshman Ryan Giggs, who turns 40 on Friday, were singled out for praise by Moyes after outstanding displays. Moyes said on the eve of his fifth decade, Giggs shows no sign of slowing down. ""People have mentioned his age, but you can't question his footballing ability. He's an unbelievable player,"" said Moyes. ""He's getting better, just his vision alone for the final goal for Nani. ""You couldn't say he needed to come off and I am lucky to work with him. He just keeps getting better. ""You just keep playing him and Ryan will tell us when he's had enough. ""He works really hard in training and produces these great performances."" With Dutch striker Robin van Persie to return from a groin injury, Moyes said he is eager to keep Rooney fresh. ""Wayne doesn't need a rest, he's in form and fit, but I'll be watching for if he does. If the opportunity comes I will make sure I keep him as fresh as I can,"" said Moyes. ""He's one of those players better off playing regularly, but I don't want to find him having to sit out for five or six games in the middle of the season."" Having succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson as United manager at the start of the season, Moyes basked in the glory of his best night in office. ""The goals will take the headlines, but I thought we defended well tonight, it's not just about the goals for me, but the team performance,"" said the Scotsman, whose side host Shakhtar Donestk in a fortnight. ""The next part is to win the group in the next game, but we want to do well in all competitions. ""Sunday (the 2-2 Premier League draw at Cardiff City) was a slip up, but the biggest thing for me is that we are improving and progressing."" Bayer Leverkusen boss Sami Hyypia admitted his side had been out-classed and showed United too much respect. ""It's not very pleasant to sit here after a game like that.

356,26/11/2013,20:18,Football: Moyes happy to see United's Rooney fired up,Manchester United manager David Moyes has said he wants England striker Wayne Rooney at his battling best and fired up for Wednesday's key Champions League clash at Bayer Leverkusen.,"United top Group A with eight points, just one ahead of hosts Leverkusen, and need to beat Sami Hyypia-coached Bayer to confirm their place in the knock-out stages. Rooney drew criticism in Sunday's disappointing 2-2 Premier League draw at Cardiff City when he kicked Jordon Mutch early on. Referee Neil Swarbrick showed Rooney a yellow card, but the 28-year-old went on to score United's opening goal, then set up their second for Patrice Evra. Rooney fired back via Twitter after Sky Sports commentator Martin Tyler and pundit Graeme Souness both said he was lucky to avoid a red card, but Moyes said he prefers to see Rooney fired up. ""His form, attitude and temperament have been first class this season, I can't fault it,"" said Moyes, with Rooney having scored eight goals so far this season in Europe and the Premier League. ""Players sometimes have their moments when they flare up, but I want Wayne to have a fire in his belly, I want him to be tough and aggressive. ""I don't want him kicking anyone, but we are seeing a Wayne Rooney who is in top form and scoring goals. ""It's a big part of his game, he's an aggressive player and he plays with his heart, as well as the skills he has in abundance. ""It's how he played as a boy under me at Everton and it's what a lot of people said might have been missing from his game last season. ""It's certainly not missing now, he's committed for everything and I'd rather have a Wayne Rooney that way than any other way. ""Everyone is recognising the form he is in, he scored a goal and created another one against Cardiff, maybe other things attracted attention rather than his goal. ""That's what happens with Wayne, he gets a lot of attention, but most of it has been on his good form this season."" United defender Chris Smalling said Rooney's battling spirit rubs off in the dressing room. ""It's in the way he plays, you can see the hunger and passion, he's a born-winner, he breathes that through the whole squad,"" said the 24-year-old England defender. Moyes said United are eager to win their last away group game to wrap up their place in the knock-out phase before their final group match at home to Shakhtar Donetsk in a fortnight. Bayer are unbeaten at home since losing 2-1 at home to European champions Bayern Munich in March and Moyes is wary of Hyypia's side, who are second only to Bayern in the Bundesliga. ""The group is very open and we have a big job to do here in Germany tomorrow,"" said the Scotsman. ""We want to try and get the job done, we know we have a hard game against Leverkusen, we want to avoid things being decided by that last game."" Centre-back Nemanja Vidic is ruled out with concussion, while striker Robin van Persie is recovering from a groin injury. The United contingent had an unusual landing into Germany when their first attempt at Cologne/Bonn airport had to be aborted at 400 metres above the runway due to another in-coming plane. ""Landed in Germany....just....I've only just recovered after that choppy landing!"", United defender Rio Ferdinand wrote on his Twitter account."

Should Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk lose at home to Real Sociedad in the section's other game, United and Leverkusen can both progress with a draw. Having beaten Chelsea 2-1 at Leverkusen's BayArena with a 91st-minute header from ex-Germany defender Manuel Friedrich in 2011, Hyypia's side want to topple another Premier League giant. Striker Stefan Kiessling has admitted Leverkusen, who are second only to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga, showed United too much respect in their first encounter two months ago. ""That time, we had too much respect for them and had a bit of fear,"" said the 29-year-old. ""Since then we have put in several good performances. We're confident. ""We're a force at home, but we have to beat these big teams -- including Manchester United."" But Hyypia admits his side will have to produce a big performance to beat United, similar to their 4-0 win over Shakhtar Donetsk in October. ""We'll have to function well as a team, both offensively and defensively,"" said the 40-year-old. Leverkusen will be without Germany winger Sidney Sam, who tore a thigh muscle after only four minutes of their 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin on Saturday. Manchester United will be without defensive midfielder Michael Carrick, while Belgium's Marouane Fellaini is suspended after being sent off in the goalless draw with Real Sociedad at the start of November. ""Their team is strong enough to compensate for those losses,"" said Hyypia."
358,26/11/2013,02:02,Football: United target Bayer win to help focus on league,Rio Ferdinand wants Manchester United to book their place in the Champions League's knock-out stages by beating Bayer Leverkusen away on Wednesday so they can focus on the Premier League.,"United slipped to a disappointing 2-2 draw at Premier League new-boys Cardiff City on Sunday which left them sixth in the table and seven points adrift of leaders Arsenal. David Moyes's side are unbeaten in their last ten matches but the Cardiff draw cost them a top four place in the Premier League. Now Ferdinand wants United to win at Leverkusen's BayArena to confirm their progression in Europe, so they can return their focus on the Premier League until next year's knock-out stages. ""We want to finish the job, get it done early so we can get back to the Premier League and have nothing else distracting us,"" said Ferdinand. ""They're a well-equipped team and it's not going to be easy but we're more than capable."" Moyes's United top Group A with eight points, just one ahead of hosts Leverkusen, and both sides would guarantee their place in the knock-out stages with a win. Should Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk lose at home to Real Sociedad in the section's other game, United and Leverkusen would progress with a draw. ""We've got a really important game coming up on Wednesday and we know we need to get our heads up and make sure that we qualify,"" said United midfielder Tom Cleverley. ""It's good we've got that game because you want to try and get a rhythm going and bounce back from a disappointing result. ""Wednesday can't come quick enough for us."" Dutch striker Robin van Persie (groin) and Nemanja Vidic (concussion) are both hoping to feature in Leverkusen after missing the Cardiff match. Rafael da Silva (ankle), Shinji Kagawa (bruised foot) and Phil Jones (abductor) are all rated doubtful, while Michael Carrick is definitely out with an Achilles tendon injury. Since losing 4-2 at Old Trafford in September in their opening match, Leverkusen have picked up seven points from their three games with home victories over Real Sociedad and Shakhtar Donetsk. Bayer's director of sport Rudi Voeller has described United's visit as ""the game of games"" for Leverkusen, who are second in the Bundesliga and the hosts are itching to claim a famous scalp. They will be without Germany winger Sidney Sam, who tore his thigh after just four minutes of Sami Hyypia-coached Bayer's 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin in the Bundesliga on Saturday. ""This is one home game we definitely want to win,"" said striker Stefan Kiessling. ""The stadium will be sold out and games like these are fun. ""With the fans support, we'll be looking to win the game, so we are in charge of our own qualification. ""We showed them a bit too much respect in the away game, maybe we were a bit scared too, but that won't be the case this time around. ""We showed in our last home game what we can do (a 4-0 win over Donetsk in October) and we want a similar performance."""
359,26/11/2013,02:00,Football: Real and United home in on last 16,Former winners Real Madrid and Manchester United are amongst the teams that could wrap up qualification to the Champions League knock-out stages on Wednesday.,"Big-spending French champions Paris Saint-Germain, Olympiakos and Bayer Leverkusen can also qualify. GROUP A Bayer Leverkusen (GER) Manchester United (ENG) Both sides at the BayArena would secure qualification to the knock-out stages with a victory. Manchester United know that a win will almost be enough to secure top spot, unless they lose at home to Shakhtar Donetsk in their final group game. A draw would suffice for both teams as long as Shakhtar lose at home to Real Sociedad in the group's other match. Leverkusen have been hit by the loss of Germany midfielder Sidney Sam while United also have several players on the treatment table, notably Michael Carrick. The Germans, though, have been in good form in the league and are up to second behind Bayern Munich following their 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin while United were stunned by an injury-time equaliser at Cardiff on Sunday. The pressure is on Leverkusen, though, as their final match is away to Sociedad while United know they still have a home game at Old Trafford to come if they fail to secure qualification in Germany. Shakhtar Dontesk (UKR) v Real Sociedad (ESP) This is a must-win game for Sociedad if they harbour any hopes of prolonging their involvement in European football this season. While continuing their adventure in the Champions League will depend on them winning and Manchester United beating Leverkusen, and then Real beating the Germans in their final game with Shakhtar not stunning United at Old Trafford, a consolation spot in the Europa League is not so far-fetched. That, however, would still depend on beating the Ukrainians as anything else would see them finishing bottom of the group. Shakhtar's final match being away to group favourites United, they too will be feeling a win is necessary to keep their progression hopes alive, which could make for an open and entertaining match in Donetsk. Group B Juventus (ITA) v FC Copenhagen (DEN) Antonio Conte's Serie A team come into this match under pressure for their Champions League future. Bottom of the group and the only team yet to win a match, they must win this fixture to keep their destiny in their own hands. But even so, with a clash away to Galatasaray in their final group game, they know they cannot afford to lose either of their last two fixtures or face certain elimination. Only two wins will guarantee them a last 16 spot, although with both their opponents also having to play Real Madrid, Juve will feel quietly confident that a win and a draw will likely prove sufficient. Real Madrid (ESP) Galatasaray (TUR) A point would be enough to send Real into the knock-out stages and would also tie up top spot, barring an unlikely five-goal defeat at FC Copenhagen on the final matchday and assuming the Danes also win away to Juventus on Wednesday. Madrid will probably be without star forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who picked up a hamstring problem in the 5-0 win at Almeria on Saturday. The loss of a player who has scored 14 goals in his last seven matches for club and cuntry would seem a blow but such has been Real's domination of the group so far, and given they crushed Galatasaray 5-0 in Istanbul earlier in the campaign, they will be confident of doing enough to secure their passage through. Group C Paris Saint-Germain (FRA) v Olympiakos (GRE) Paris Saint-Germain will qualify for the last-16 knockout phase with a draw at home to the Greek champions at the Parc des Princes, while Olympiakos will also go through with a point should Anderlecht defeat Benfica in Brussels. Laurent Blanc has guided his Ligue 1 leaders on an unbeaten run in all competitions since taking over from current Real Madrid handler Carlo Ancelotti while the capital outfit have not lost in the league since last March when they went down 1-0 at Reims. Captain Zlatan Ibrahimovic has scored 17 goals in his last 11 matches for club and country, including the third in the 3-0 win over Reims on Saturday which kept the team four points clear at the top in France. Olympiakos coach Miguel Torres has also built an impressive unbeaten league run of 29 matches without loss since taking over in February as they lead the Greek league and have not lost a domestic match away from home in 28 fixtures, one short of their own national record. Anderlecht (BEL) v Benfica (POR) The Belgian leaders are much in need of their first victory of the group stage and will take heart from their gutsy 1-1 draw at PSG on matchday four. They lost 2-0 in Lisbon, the first time the teams met, but with the Portuguese picking up just one point from two fixtures against Olympiakos, Benfica will be looking for maximum points to stay in touch with the top two spots and also solidify their chances of guaranteeing at least third and a spot in the next round of the Europa League. The teams met in the 1983 UEFA Cup final which was won by the Brussels' club, an occasion that saw current Benfica assistant coach Minervino Pietra turn out for the Lisbon side. Anderlecht are trying to reach the second round for the first time since 2000-01 while Benfica finished third in their pool last season before going on to reach the Europa League final where they were beaten 2-1 by Chelsea in Amsterdam. Group D CSKA Moscow (RUS) v Bayern Munich (GER) The defending champions are Europe's in-form side and chasing what would be a record tenth consecutive Champions League victory when they visit a CSKA Moscow outfit who can only finish third at best. The Bundesliga front-runners are coming off a 3-0 thrashing off Borussia Dortmund at the weekend, the team they defeated in last year's final. That win on the road extended their German league record to 38 matches unbeaten, although they will be wary of dropping points and potentially top spot in the group to Manchester City. Bayern have won three of their eight trips to Russian clubs in European action but have only lost once back in 2008 when they were sent packing at the semi-final stage of the UEFA Cup, well beaten on the night 4-0 by Zenit Saint-Petersburg. The German club have been rocked by a suspected mole at the Allianz Arena who has been revealing tactics ahead of matches to the German press much to the fury of coach Pep Guardiola. Manchester City (ENG) v Viktoria Plzen (CZE) The 2012 English champions have qualified for the knockout phase for the first time following back-to-back wins over CSKA but need to keep the pressure on Bayern at the top who are three points clear heading into the penultimate matches. Manuel Pellegrini looked on as his side humiliated Tottenham 6-0 in Premier League action on Sunday and maximum points at home will set up a last day finale in Munich. The Czech Republic side make their first trip to England, but looking for their first points and a bid to keep alive their Europa League prospects flickering, looks a daunting challenge on paper at a City team who have lost just once at home in their last 22 European ties. Coming into this season's group stage, Plzen were riding a seven match unbeaten run on their travels but are now trying to break a four match European losing streak, their worst in club history."

But Bert van Marwijk's Hamburg brushed off the loss of their skipper to claim their first home win in six attempts. ""It was a hard-fought victory for us with both teams under pressure. Hanover are going through a difficult time while we needed to finally win at home,"" said Van Marwijk. ""We haven't improved much, but we are better organised and we gave fewer balls away."" Hanover's Hungary midfielder Szabolcs Huszti put his side ahead when he hit the top left corner from 16 metres with 28 minutes gone. But the hosts responded with Croatia's Milan Badelj equalising three minutes later before right-wing Maximilian Beister slipped his marker just a minute into the second-half to head home. Beister then turned provider as he found 19-year-old Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu in space and the attacking midfielder fired home for the third six minutes from time. Hanover's Senegal defender Salif Sane was sent off in the dying stages for a second yellow card to compound the guests' misery. It was Hanover's eighth match without a win, their sixth straight away defeat, and saw Mirko Slomka's side drop to 13th in the league. Werder Bremen slumped to 12th and their third defeat in four games, as they went down 3-2, despite a late fight back, at home to seventh-placed Mainz 05, for whom Japan's Shinji Okazaki scored twice. On Saturday, Bayern Munich's Germany star Mario Goetze came off the bench to score the opening goal in the European champions' comprehensive 3-0 win at his ex-club Borussia Dortmund. Goetze, who joined Bayern for 37 million euros (US$50m) in July after 12 years at Dortmund, gave the perfect reply to the chorus of boos he received on his return to Borussia's Westfalenstadion. The 21-year-old smashed home a Thomas Mueller pass on 66 minutes, before the floodgates opened and Arjen Robben and Mueller added late goals in the final five minutes. Bayern capped a commanding performance by beating Dortmund for the first time in seven Bundesliga attempts, dating back to February 2010. It was Munich's first win in Dortmund since September 2009. ""We're happy, we won against the best counter-attacking team in the world,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. Again, Munich ran out winners in a replay of May's Champions League final as Dortmund had been forced to patch together their entire back four after a spate of injuries. But there can be no excuses as Bayern extended their record unbeaten run in the Bundesliga to 38 matches and opened a seven-point lead over Dortmund, who drop to third. Bayer Leverkusen warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Manchester United by going second with a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin. The win came at a cost as Germany winger Sidney Sam was ruled out of the United clash after tearing a thigh muscle four minutes into the game. Sixth-placed Schalke, who are away to Steaua Bucharest in the Champions League on Tuesday and are second in Group E behind Chelsea, drew 3-3 at Eintracht Frankfurt. They raced into a 2-0 lead after only 18 minutes but leaked three goals in 12 disastrous second-half minutes. Germany defender Benedikt Hoewedes saved Schalke's blushes when he hit the top-right hand corner to equalise with just four minutes left. Wolfsburg's four-match winning streak, which has seen them climb to fifth in the league, was ended when they were held to a 1-1 draw at second-from-bottom Nuremberg. Freiburg stay in the relegation places despite their 1-0 win at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, while Augsburg are up to tenth after their 2-0 win at Hoffenheim. On Friday, Borussia Moenchengladbach stayed fourth with a 2-0 win at VfB Stuttgart, their fourth straight win, with goals by Brazil's Raffael and Sweden's Oscar Wendt."

""This is the game of games for us in the Champions League, we have to put all our power and effort into it, just without Sidney."" Leverkusen have not said how long Sam is expected to be out for, but with less than a month left before the winter break, the Germany winger faces a race against time to be fit again in 2013.

363,24/11/2013,00:20,Football: Bayern on top in Germany after Dortmund rout,European champions Bayern Munich took a significant step towards retaining the Bundesliga title with their first win at rivals Borussia Dortmund in four years.,"Former Dortmund hero Mario Goetze came off the bench and produced a super shot to give Bayern the lead on 66 minutes before Arjen Robben and Thomas Mueller added to the 3-0 rout in the final five minutes of Saturday's German Clasico. It was Bayern's first Bundesliga win over Dortmund in seven attempts and extended Munich's record unbeaten run in the German league to 38 matches in a repeat of May's Champions League final. The result at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion left Bayern four points clear of Bayer Leverkusen, who replaced Dortmund in second place, while Pep Guardiola's Munich are an ominous seven points ahead of Borussia. ""We are very happy because we won against the best counter-attacking team in the world,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. ""In the first 15 minutes we played very well, but didn't do so well at the end of the first-half. ""We were clearly better in the second half, especially with Thiago, Mario Goetze, Toni Kroos and Philipp Lahm."" Dortmund came into the game having suffered a double injury blow after both Germany defenders Mats Hummels and Marcel Schmelzer were ruled out with injury on Wednesday. Bayern, in contrast were missing only France winger Franck Ribery from their first-choice line-up and Guardiola could bring Goetze and Spain star Thiago Alcantara off the bench. Defending champions Bayern are at CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday, but have already booked their place in the knock-out stages. Dortmund had their chances, with seven shots on goal compared to Bayern's 10, but Marco Reus and Henrikh Mkhitaryan wasted clear chances while Bayern made theirs count. ""We cannot overstate the win,"" beamed goal-scorer Robben. ""It was still 1-0 up until the 85th minute, it looks like a decisive win, but Dortmund had their chances. ""We put the space we had to good effect and perhaps deserved to win. ""As a young boy, you dream of playing in stadiums like this."" Dortmund have no time to lick their wounds with Napoli next up on Tuesday in a game they must win to keep alive their dreams of reaching the Champions League's knock-out stages and are third in their group behind leaders Arsenal and Napoli. ""Bayern changed their game in the second half and hit a few long balls, they were patient,"" said Dortmund coach Juergen Klopp. ""I believe that up until the 1-0, we had big chances, you have to put those away if you want to get back into a game like this."" Dortmund have had a few tough weeks, losing to Arsenal at home in the Champions League and this was their third straight defeat after also losing at Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga. ""Games are decided by goals - and at the moment we're not scoring the crucial ones,"" said Dortmund captain Roman Weidenfeller. ""The amount we lost by is ultimately irrelevant. ""It's a bitter defeat, as we played a good game over nearly 80 minutes and have nothing to show for it."""

368,22/11/2013,02:20,Football: Injuries take toll on hosts for Germany's 'Clasico',Second-placed Borussia Dortmund host leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday in a Bundesliga top-of-the-table showdown with injuries having decimated the hosts' defence.,"The rematch of last season's Champions League final between the Bundesliga's top sides - billed as Germany's Clasico or Der Klassiker - comes with Pep Guardiola's Bayern four points clear and Dortmund's defence in disarray. Centre-back Mats Hummels and left-back Marcel Schmelzer have been ruled out after returning from international duty with injuries. With centre-back Neven Subotic out for six months with torn ligaments and right-back Lukasz Piszczek only just back in training after surgery, Dortmund will face the European champions without their entire first-choice back four. ""It is a disaster,"" admitted Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. ""The worst thing that can happen to you in football is to have to replace the entire back four. ""A defender, a midfielder or a striker can be replaced by every team, but a whole back four?"" Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp summed up the situation when he said that ""80 percent of my grey hairs were earned this week"", but he has reacted by signing ex-Germany defender Manuel Friedrich, who had been released by Bayer Leverkusen, until the end of the campaign. The 34-year-old is likely to partner Greece international Sokratis Papastathopoulos at centre-back, while youngster Erik Durm is expected to play at left-back with Kevin Grosskreutz on the right. ""We have had to put together a defence which has not yet played 20 games together, but we still have a lot of quality in the squad,"" said Klopp, while sporting director Michael Zorc has defiantly said Dortmund ""won't raise the white flag to anyone"". Even with Bayern's France winger Franck Ribery ruled out with a fractured rib, the pressure is firmly on Dortmund. Their defeat away to Wolfsburg a fortnight ago left them four points adrift, and if they are serious about bringing the Bundesliga trophy back to the Ruhr Valley, this is a match they must win. The difference between the two squads is strength in depth with Guardiola able to call on Germany's Mario Goetze or Swiss star Xherdan Shaqiri to fill in for Ribery. ""It's just like it so often is with us: we have a good enough squad and will certainly have a decent team on the pitch, whose goal will be to win there,"" said Bayern's Germany star Thomas Mueller. Goetze, who is returning to Dortmund having left to join Bayern in the summer, will be making his first appearance at the Westfalenstadion in the red shirt. The 21-year-old has said he has ""no fear"" and understands the passionate home supporters would rather see him playing for Borussia, but ex-Dortmund and Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann has advised him ""not to take throw-ins or corners"" to stay away from the fans. February 2010 was the last time Bayern beat Dortmund in the Bundesliga, but the Bavarians were victorious when it mattered most, beating the black and yellows in May's Champions League final. Much has been made of Bayern's failure to beat Borussia in their previous six Bundesliga showdowns, but having gone 37 league matches and more than a year without defeat, Munich will be confident of extending their unbeaten Bundesliga run. Certainly, Bayern want to again exert their authority over their rivals, who won back-to-back league titles in 2010/11 and 2011/12 before Bayern swept the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup last season. Among the weekend's other matches, struggling Hamburg host mid-table Hanover without captain Rafael van der Vaart, who tore ankle ligaments while on duty with the Netherlands and is expected to be ruled out for the next four weeks. Fixtures (kick-offs 1430 GMT unless stated) Friday (1930 GMT) VfB Stuttgart v Borussia Moenchengladbach"
369,21/11/2013,10:44,Football: Dortmund sign Friedrich to ease injury list,Borussia Dortmund have reacted to their long list of injuries ahead of Saturday's Bundesliga showdown with Bayern Munich by signing ex-Germany defender Manuel Friedrich until the end of the season.,"Second-placed Dortmund host Bundesliga leaders Bayern with Pep Guardiola's European champions four-points clear at the top. Borussia were dealt a double injury blow on Wednesday when scans revealed both centre-back Mats Hummels and left-back Marcel Schmelzer returned with injuries from international duty with Germany. Torn ankle ligaments will keep Hummels out until mid January, while a torn calf muscle means a three-week lay-off for Schmelzer. With centre-back Neven Subotic out for six months with torn ligaments and right-back Lukasz Piszczek only just back in training from surgery, Dortmund will face the league leaders without their entire first-choice back four. Having been released by Bayer Leverkusen at the end of last season, centre-back Friedrich, 34, was previously without a club and made the last of his nine appearances for Germany in February 2008. ""We have reacted to the injuries in our defence. Manuel Friedrich has extensive experience and has made a good impression in training,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc with Friedrich having signed a contract until June 2014. Friedrich is set to partner Greece international Sokratis Papastathopoulos at centre-back against Bayern and has also played for Werder Bremen and Mainz in his Bundesliga career, making 247 league appearances and scoring 15 goals. ""I am thrilled to be allowed to run out in the Borussia Dortmund jersey,"" said Friedrich, who had been training with third division Rot-Weiss Oberhausen to stay fit. ""Until now, I had only done that as a guest in Dortmund and when the famous ""Yellow Wall"" (of Borussia fans) was against, not supporting you. ""I'm looking forward to a cool time in the black and yellow jersey."""
370,20/11/2013,17:13,Football: Dortmund dealt double blow for Bayern clash,Borussia Dortmund were dealt a double injury blow for Saturday's key Bundesliga showdown against Bayern Munich with both defenders Mats Hummels and Marcel Schmelzer ruled out with injury.,"The pair limped out of Germany's 1-0 friendly win over England on Tuesday. Scans on Wednesday revealed centre-back Hummels is out until 2014 with a torn ligament in his right ankle, while left-back Schmelzer is sidelined for three weeks with a torn left calf. ""Bad news for me today. I won't be able to play any more this year so all I can do is support the guys in the next weeks,"" Hummels wrote on his Facebook page. ""It will be very difficult, but I am optimistic we can make it through these games."" The timing is bad for Dortmund, who must beat Napoli at home in the Champions League next Tuesday, then Marseille away on December 11, to keep alive their dreams of reaching the knock-out stages. With Hummels' centre-back partner Neven Subotic out for six months with torn knee ligaments and right-back Lukasz Piszczek only just back from surgery, it means Dortmund face the European champions without their entire first-choice back four. Subotic's possible replacement, ex-Germany defender Manuel Friedrich, 34, who was released by Bayer Leverkusen at the end of last season, picked up an injury in a practice match on trial with Dortmund on Tuesday, according to German daily Bild. Having come on as a second-half replacement at Wembley, Hummels lasted just 20 minutes on Tuesday while Schmelzer played the first-half against England and was taken off at half-time. Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc has complained about the scheduling of the game against Bayern. ""As far as I am concerned, this is unfortunate scheduling,"" said Zorc. ""To play this match just before another round of Champions League games and after a long international break, is not optimal, in terms of preparation, for the anticipation, for all of it, for all parties involved."" With European champions Bayern four points clear in the league and already in the knock-out phase of the Champions League, Munich coach Pep Guardiola has no such injury concerns. Dutch wing Arjen Robben has recovered from a small knock while on international duty, while centre-back Jerome Boateng is fit to play despite being taken off after half-time at Wembley with a minor heel injury. Having rested both Bayern stars Philipp Lahm and Manuel Neuer for the England match, Germany coach Joachim Loew said he regretted the injuries to Dortmund's Schmelzer and Hummels. Real Madrid also lost Germany star Sami Khedira, in last Friday's 1-1 draw with Italy, for the next six months with a knee injury. ""When players are injured during international matches, it is always regrettable for the player, the club and the national team,"" said Loew. ""Marcel and Mats were in good shape and the fact this has happened is, of course, unhappy news for Dortmund. ""If you also include the bad injury to Sami Khedira, I can't remember the last time we have had so many injuries in such a short period. ""Just like with Sami, I wish Mats and Marcel a speedy recovery and hope to see them on the field again soon."""

The result leaves Frankfurt 15th in the league, just above the relegation places after their fourth straight defeat. Later VfB Stuttgart moved up to eighth after picking up their first win in five games with a 3-1 win at Freiburg, who stay in the bottom three. Stuttgart raced into a 2-0 lead with striker Vedad Ibisevic firing home after nine minutes before 17-year-old forward Timo Werner added a second a minute later. Germany striker Mike Hanke pulled a goal back for Freiburg 12 minutes from time before Werner, a Germany Under-19 international, added his second with a superb finish following a strong run. On Saturday, European champions Bayern Munich set a new record for the longest unbeaten run in Bundesliga history with a 3-0 victory at home to Augsburg. Bayern have now gone 37 league matches since their last defeat, at Bayer Leverkusen in October 2012, breaking Hamburg's previous record of 36 from January, 1983.

The Champions League holders opened the scoring at Munich's Allianz Arena when Germany centre-back Jerome Boateng headed home from a corner after just five minutes. France winger Franck Ribery then smashed home a direct free-kick on 42 minutes before Germany's Thomas Mueller netted a penalty in the fifth minute of injury time. Bayern, who now have 31 wins in their last 37 Bundesliga matches, were without Germany's Bastian Schweinsteiger, who will miss the forthcoming internationals against Italy and England with an ankle injury. It was Bayern's second milestone of the week after they equalled Barcelona's record from the 2002/03 season of nine consecutive Champions League wins with a 1-0 at Viktoria Pilsen. Breaking records is nothing remarkable for Bayern these days having set or equalled 25 league records under Pep Guardiola's predecessor Jupp Heynckes last season.

""I was really impressed with the massive vote of confidence back then and I'm incredibly grateful to the club for that,"" said Leno, who kept a clean sheet in his side's goalless draw away to Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League in midweek. The 21-year-old Leno's existing deal was due to run out in 2017, and Leverkusen sporting director Rudi Voeller was pleased to see the highly-rated 'keeper commit himself to the cause for an extra season. ""The lad is one of the best keepers in Germany as he proves week after week. For a goalkeeper of his age, he has an incredibly cool head and he doesn't allow anybody or anything put him off his game. When you remember he still has great potential due to his age then this deal is brilliant for us,"" Voeller said. Leno was third-choice 'keeper at Stuttgart when Leverkusen recruited him in 2011. In extending his contract, he follows in the footsteps of Germany midfielder Lars Bender, who recently signed a deal keeping him at the BayArena until 2019. Leverkusen currently sit third in the Bundesliga, four points behind leaders Bayern Munich, before facing Hamburg at home this weekend."

He now has a chance to become Germany's leading goalscorer of all time, currently sharing the benchmark of 68 goals with Gerd Mueller. Bayern Munich midfielder Schweinsteiger is out of contention as he requires further surgery on his problem right ankle. Loew's squad features a first call-up for Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller. The 33-year-old has pressed home his claim for inclusion thanks to some fine performances for Dortmund in both the Bundesliga and in Europe, where he helped his side make it to the Champions League final last season. ""We've followed with interest his constant results with Dortmund in the Bundesliga and Champions League,"" explained Loew, who emphasised that Bayern's Manuel Neuer remained his number one 'keeper. Despite Schweinsteiger's absence, Bayern have six of their players on the list including captain Philipp Lahm. Arsenal are doubly represented through Mesut Ozil and Per Mertesacker, while there is one other player from the Premier League in Andre Schuerrle. The Chelsea winger produced a second-half hat-trick in Germany's 5-2 comeback win against Sweden in their final qualifier last month. Germany, who went through qualifying unbeaten to secure their berth in Brazil, face Italy in Milan on November 15 followed by England at Wembley four days later.

385,06/11/2013,00:11,Football: Rooney challenges Arsenal to keep up title form,Manchester United forward Wayne Rooney has said Arsenal still have to prove they have the consistency to fight for the Premier League title this season.,"The two sides meet this Sunday with the North Londoners eight points clear of United at the top of the table after a blistering start to the campaign. United's form is also on the up, though, as a 0-0 draw with Real Sociedad on Tuesday night extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to eight games. And Rooney believes Arsenal -- who haven't won a trophy for over eight years -- still have to show they can last the distance of the 38-game season. ""We've beaten Arsenal many times in the past. They are in good form at the minute, they're top of the league, so we know it is going to be a difficult game. ""But we have to go into the game confident that this is the game that will bring us back into the mix. ""We'll have to wait and see where they are in March. We've seen before that they've been in the top two until February, March time and then dropped off so it's down to them to try and stay there. ""They are doing brilliantly and are in a great position so it is down to us to match them. ""We know we are playing better and are stating to do well. There are only 10 games gone so there is no big worry at the minute."" Rooney started the 0-0 stalemate in San Sebastian, but was replaced by Robin Van Persie with half an hour remaining to keep him fresh for Sunday's clash at Old Trafford. Van Persie went onto miss a penalty and saw another effort strike the post as United failed to secure the win that would have all but sealed their place in the last 16. The English champions still lead Group A by a point from Bayer Leverkusen with two games remaining. However, Rooney was frustrated not to have taken all three points having had by far the better of the chances in a cagey encounter. ""We're disappointed not to get the three points. I thought we were the better team, but overall it is another clean sheet and decent result. ""I think coming away from home in the Champions League, they are always difficult games. We had good chances so we feel we should have won the game, but a draw away from home is ok."" And Rooney is sure that Van Persie's spot-kick failure won't affect his confidence ahead of the meeting with his old side at the weekend. ""Most forwards in the world miss penalties, it is one of those things. That won't affect him I'm sure."""
386,05/11/2013,22:57,Football: Shakhtar draw edges Bayer closer to qualifying,Shakhtar Donetsk and Bayer Leverkusen shared the points in a scrappy Champions League goalless draw in Ukraine on Tuesday to edge the Germans towards a place in the knockout stages.,"Germany Under-21 goalkeeper Bernd Leno played a major role in Bayer leaving Donetsk with a point after pulling off a string of impressive saves to frustrate the hosts. The draw leaves Leverkusen second in Group A behind Manchester United, with Shakhtar third, but the game had stalemate written all over it from the start with chances few and far between. Play often got bogged down in the middle of the park and Bayer's fancy footwork failed to find a way through the rugged Shakhtar defence. Bayer, who had rested a string of first-team regulars for the weekend defeat to Bundesliga bottom club Eintracht Brunswick, pushed for an away win, but were a long way from repeating their remarkable 4-0 win in Germany in the previous fixture. For Shakhtar it continued a dismal run against German opposition, as they have not beaten a Bundesliga side on home soil for 32 years when Eintracht Frankfurt were the victims in a UEFA Cup tie. But at least they did what coach Mircea Lucescu demanded, and ""put things right"" after their unfortunate drubbing in Germany. Shakhtar had the lion's share of possession and forced six first-half corners to Bayer's none, but it was the Germans who carved out the half's best chance after 24 minutes. Burly Shakhtar defender Viacheslav Shavchuk upended Son Heung-Min outside the area and from the resultant free kick, Gonzalo Castro brought an acrobatic save from the Ukrainian 'keeper Andriy Piatov, diving smartly to his right to hold the ball cleanly. Shortly afterwards, Bayer's Germany midfielder Sidney Sam broke through the Shakhtar defence but put his shot from the edge of the area tamely wide. In reply, Shakhtar's Croatian captain Darijo Srna rattled the woodwork on the half hour, his mighty shot from far out on the right striking the far post and rebounding back into play. Leverkusen came out of the blocks fighting at the start of the second half but for all their pressure, they failed to break the resolve of Piatov, who was equal to everything the Germans bombarded him with. But in the end it was a satisfactory result for Bayer, whose coach Sami Hyypia had predicted the game would leave them ""very close to qualifying for the knockout stages"". After the game, he beamed: ""You play to win, but tonight a point is OK. ""Bernd played well, all in all, we fought well and had a few good opportunities to score. The second half was much better for us than the first."""

The Hanseatic outfit went down fighting in losing 2-0 at home to fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday to leave them 14th in the league. But sports director Oliver Kreuzer is backing his team to win their next three home league games against Hanover 96, Mainz and Augsburg -- who are all in the bottom half of the table. ""We won't lose another home game until the winter break,"" the 47-year-old told the Hamburg media. ""We should manage that, especially if we continue as we did against 'Gladbach."" Hamburg's Germany goalkeeper Rene Adler said it was not an unreasonable aim for the rest of 2013. ""I would sign up for that immediately, but you don't always get what you want in football,"" he said. ""All we can do is promise to do everything we can to make that happen."" Hamburg's only win at home so far this season was a 4-0 romp against promoted Eintracht Braunschweig and they face Champions League Bayer Leverkusen, who are third in the league, away on Saturday. ""The Gladbach game won't throw us off course,"" said Adler, after Leverkusen suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at home to Eintracht Braunschweig last weekend. ""We will do everything we can to make sure Bayer lose twice in a row, they don't like that in Leverkusen."" Hamburg are waiting on the fitness of their Dutch captain Rafael van der Vaart who missed training on Tuesday with a stomach infection."
389,04/11/2013,02:25,"Football: Real Madrid, Bayern, United edge close to last 16",Defending champions Bayern Munich as well as former winners Real Madrid and Manchester United are on the verge of making the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday.,"AFP Sports previews Tuesday's eight games on matchday four: Group A Shakhtar Donetsk (UKR) v Bayer Leverkusen (GER) Both these sides suffered league defeats at the weekend -- Shakhtar going down 2-0 at Volyn Lutsk, which was the third defeat on the road for Mircea Lucescu's men, while Leverkusen were embarrassed 1-0 by rock-bottom Eintracht Braunschweig to fall four points behind Bayern Munich. Leverkusen's fit-again Lars Bender, who signed a contract extension in midweek, received a late red card for his second bookable offence while Stefan Kiessling, Sidney Sam and Heung-Min Son were all on the bench at the start. The Germans won the first tie between the two sides last month, a comprehensive 4-0 home win which put them on six points, one behind Manchester United. Shakhtar, who were quarter-finalists in 2011, have not beaten a German side at home in Europe since seeing off Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1980/81 UEFA Cup. Real Sociedad (ESP) v Man Utd (ENG) United can virtually ensure their last 16 place with victory in Spain after a 1-0 home win over Sociedad, playing in the tournament for the first time in 10 years, in Manchester moved them onto seven points from three games. But David Moyes's side have doubts over the fitness of Jonny Evans, Rafael da Silva and Tom Cleverley, who were all replaced at half-time in Saturday's 3-1 win at Fulham. ""It will be a difficult test against (Real) Sociedad,"" said Moyes. ""To go and play against any side in Spain who have qualified will be a hard test, but we will go over there and try and get a good result that will continue our good form in the group."" Sociedad have scored just once in three Champions League games so far and are without a point but warnmed up for Tuesday with a confidence-boosting 5-0 home win over Osasuna. Jagoba Arrasate's side are looking to avoid setting a club-record sequence of four straight defeats in Europe. Group B Juventus (ITA) v Real Madrid (ESP) Real Madrid have nine points from three games after a Cristiano Ronaldo double ensured a 2-1 win over Juventus last time out and they need just a point in Turin to make sure of a last-16 place. Nine-time winners Madrid have scored in all their last 19 Champions League away fixtures, losing only four but Juventus have won the last five meetings between the sides in Turin. Juventus are in third place and with that position in mind coach Antonio Conte rested Andrea Pirlo in Saturday's 1-0 win at Parma before the veteran midfielder replaced Claudio Marchisio. Ronaldo has scored seven times for Real Madrid in the Champions League this season just one off the record held jointly by Ruud van Nistelrooy, Filippo Inzaghi and Hernan Crespo. On Saturday, Real beat Rayo Vallecano 3-2 with a Ronaldo double and a Karim Benzema header as Gareth Bale laid on two goals for the second consecutive game. Real will be without left-back Fabio Coentrao after he limped off with an ankle injury. Xabi Alonso is also a doubt but Raphael Varane will return at the heart of the defence after being rested against Rayo. Copenhagen (DEN) v Galatasaray (TUR) Galatasaray won the first match 3-1 in Istanbul to put themselves in second spot in the table, five points behind Real but two ahead of Juve and three up on Copenhagen. The Danes drew 1-1 with Juve and lost 4-0 at Real Madrid while Galatasaray recovered from their opening 6-1 drubbing to the Spaniards to draw 2-2 with Juventus in Roberto Mancini's first game as coach. Copenhagen's home record in the tournament gives some cause for optimism -- in eight matches, they have lost only to Chelsea and have beaten Manchester United and drawn with Barcelona in previous years. For Galatasaray, Copenhagen holds special memories -- in 2000, a Fatih Terim-led team overcame Arsenal on penalties in the UEFA Cup final. Group C Paris Saint Germain (FRA) v Anderlecht (BEL) The French side can qualify for the knockout stages for the second successive year with victory over an Anderlecht team they walloped 5-0 in their previous encounter a fortnight ago to make it three impressive wins from three games in an admittedly easy group. The only good news for Anderlecht is that there are doubts over whether Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who scored four in the first match, will be fit as he was rested for the 4-0 Ligue 1 win over Lorient last Friday -- extending PSG's unbeaten Ligue 1 run to 23 -- with an inflamed knee. Anderlecht are searching for their first point and first goal of the campaign while their last away win in the Champions League came in the 2005/06 season at Real Betis. Olympiakos (GRE) v Benfica (POR) A lot at stake in this match as with both on four points, and Anderlecht on zero, they are battling for the runners up spot and a place in the last 16 or the third-place finish that guarantees a spot in the Europa League knockout stage, a competition in which the Portuguese outfit reached the final last season only to lose to Chelsea. The sides drew 1-1 in Lisbon, and Olympiakos will be looking to repeat their 5-1 win the last time they hosted Benfica in the Champions League in the 2008/09 campaign. Three Benfica players remain from that thumping including striker Oscar Cardozo, who was only on the bench that night but will be hoping to lead the line on Tuesday. Similarly Kostas Mitroglou should be up front for the hosts and eager to add to his tally of goals, having earlier this term become the first Greek player to score a hat-trick in the Champions League, admittedly against the porous Anderlecht defence. Group D Manchester City (ENG) v CSKA Moscow (RUS) City made heavy weather of beating the Russian outfit a fortnight ago in a match overshadowed by a racism controversy but look in sharper form after a 7-0 demolition of Norwich on Saturday, their biggest win in the top flight since 1968. Victory over the Russians would all but assure them of reaching the knockout stages for the first time after two flops under Roberto Mancini. The Italian's successor, Chilean Manuel Pellegrini showed his ruthless side when he dropped Joe Hart from the Norwich game and Romanian Costel Pantilimon may well keep his place for the CSKA game. City's talismanic central defender and captain Vincent Kompany is still struggling with a thigh injury and missed the Norwich game. CSKA come into the game on the back of a come from behind 2-1 win over Volga with impressive Ivorian striker Seydou Dumbia on the scoresheet. Viktoria Pilsen (CZE) v Bayern Munich (GER) The Germans are proving as unbeatable as PSG are, their 2-1 win over Hoffenheim on Saturday equalling the Bundesliga record for the longest unbeaten run, levelling the 36 matches unbeaten Hamburg achieved between January 1982 and January 1983. Victory on Tuesday, and CSKA failing to win at City, will see the holders qualify for the last 16. However, not all is rosy in the Munich camp as they are still struggling to impose themselves early in their matches. ""Obviously it's not such a wonderful situation,"" said Mario Goetze, who caused Pilsen all sorts of problems once he came on in the second-half of their match a fortnight ago, which ended in an easy 5-0 win for the German side. Pilsen have an impressive home record in the competition winning 10 out of 11 before City beat them this season. Bayern, though, are closing in on their record of successive away wins in the competition, six on their way to winning the 1996 title, as victory on Tuesday would be their fifth in a row."

But Guardiola has picked up where Heynckes left off and has already equalled Bayern's longest ever unbeaten start to a Bundesliga season, set in 1968/69. As a result, the reigning champions are now undefeated in their domestic league in 35 games in over a year and a draw or a win at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim on Saturday will see them match the previous best mark set by Hamburg between January 1982 and January 1983. ""Our target and ambition is to take all three points in Hoffenheim,"" left-back David Alaba said this week. ""But obviously, we know Hoffenheim will make it as hard as they can for us in front of their home crowd. Hoffenheim are much stronger compared to last season and they're playing well as a team."" Games involving Hoffenheim have tended to be entertaining affairs this season, with Markus Gisdol's side the joint-top scorers in the division alongside Borussia Dortmund. And their last home game was the now infamous 2-1 defeat to Bayer Leverkusen a fortnight ago in which Stefan Kiessling's 'phantom goal' ultimately proved to be the decisive counter. Hoffenheim have since learned that the result of that match will stand, but their confidence was lifted by a 4-1 win at Hannover last week and Gisdol is looking forward to welcoming the champions. ""It's a special game for us -- for Bayern not so much,"" said Gisdol this week, perhaps forgetting the record that is in sight for the visitors in Sinsheim. Bayern have won eight and drawn two of their opening 10 games to sit a point clear of Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen at the top of the standings, and that trio have already opened up a gap on the pack below that looks unlikely to be closed again. It has been an excellent last week for Dortmund, who followed up wins at Arsenal in the Champions League and at Schalke in the Ruhr derby with the announcement that sought-after coach Jurgen Klopp had extended his contract until the summer of 2018. ""We're all so pleased that we can help this team, which is still a long way from reaching its peak, to develop. We want to shape the future of this wonderful club together,"" Klopp told the Bundesliga's official website. On Friday, Dortmund entertain Stuttgart looking to beat the Swabians at home for the first time since September 2008. Klopp -- who was born in Stuttgart -- knows to expect another tough test against a side who are unbeaten in seven league games since Thomas Schneider replaced Bruno Labbadia in the dugout. ""I assume it will be a closely fought game, but I also believe that we will win,"" said Klopp, who could have Sebastian Kehl back after injury. Like Bayern, Leverkusen have records in sight this weekend, as a win at struggling Eintracht Braunschweig will make this their best ever start to a season in 34 years in the Bundesliga. Sami Hyypia's side, who saw Germany midfielder Lars Bender sign a contract extension this week tying him to the club until 2019, should prove too strong for Braunschweig, who have won just once so far in what is their first top-flight campaign in more than quarter of a century. In other games, Schalke warm up for their Champions League trip to face Chelsea by taking on fifth-place Hertha Berlin in the capital, and struggling duo Nuremberg and Freiburg are both still looking for their first win of the season as they meet in Franconia.

On Monday the DFB decided against ordering a replay of the match originally held on October 18, choosing instead to let the result stand. ""After a period of intense reflection, we've finally decided not to appeal to the High Court,"" said Hoffenheim's chairman Peter Rettig, according to German agency SID, an AFP subsidiary. ""This decision doesn't change the fact we consider the tribunal's decision constitutes a bad signal for the whole of football. ""Nevertheless, we accept this sentence because we don't want to launch into a hopeless process."" The DFB's decision has come in for severe criticism in Germany. ""I believe the whole of German football is annoyed and should be annoyed,"" Bayern Munich chief Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told another German agency, DPA. The victory has helped Leverkusen remain on league leaders' Bayern's coat-tails, just a point behind the reigning champions. Local press called the decision a ""joke""."

395,25/10/2013,02:22,Football: Dortmund look for revenge in Ruhr derby,"Fresh from beating Arsenal away in the Champions League in midweek, Borussia Dortmund will be looking for a measure of revenge when they make the shorter trip to face Schalke in the Ruhr derby on Saturday.","Dortmund earned widespread praise last season as they made it to the Champions League final, but their fans will not forget the fact that they lost both meetings with their neighbours from 30 kilometres along the road. A victory at the Veltins Arena would therefore allow Jurgen Klopp's side to get one over on the Royal Blues as well as keep the pressure on Bayern Munich, the leaders who come into the weekend a point clear of Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen. While Dortmund were beating Arsenal 2-1 in London, Schalke were also in Champions League action on Tuesday, although they were outclassed 3-0 at home by Chelsea. Jens Keller's men have only lost once in their last six Bundesliga outings, with that a 4-0 home hammering by Bayern, but they have beaten Leverkusen at home this season and will be determined to repeat their 2-1 derby triumph of March, when Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 victory. ""That was the shadow that lay over last season for us and we need to make amends,"" said Klopp. For Schalke, Huntelaar is missing but Kevin-Prince Boateng will be available to face the side with whom he had a spell in the 2008-09 season. Upon signing for the Gelsenkirchen club, he was forced to retract earlier comments about Dortmund being his ""favourite team"". The rivalry between the clubs is fierce, and the nature of it has not been lost on Schalke's Japanese full-back Atsuto Uchida. ""When I came to Germany I was told straightaway that I wasn't allowed to wear anything yellow, and even to steer clear of black boots. That is how intense it is,"" he said. ""You never want to lose against Dortmund -- and we beat them twice last season. They're a fine team, but we'll be going out looking for another win this time as well."" After tasting victory in his first derby in charge, Keller is hoping for more of the same this weekend. ""You can feel the derby fever everywhere. Everyone knows how special this game is,"" said the man who was under severe pressure at the start of the campaign after Schalke took just one point from their first three games. Elsewhere on Saturday, Bayern put their 34-match unbeaten run in the Bundesliga on the line when they entertain Hertha Berlin, the capital club who sit fourth. A win will keep Pep Guardiola's reigning champions top and will see them go a whole year undefeated since a 2-1 loss to Leverkusen on October 28 2012. Bayern, who are closing in on Hamburg's 30-year-old record 36-match unbeaten streak, have lost veteran Peruvian striker Claudio Pizarro for up to six weeks with a thigh muscle tear suffered in training. That leaves Mario Mandzukic as their only fit centre-forward, although Guardiola should have no qualms about playing Thomas Mueller or Mario Goetze as a false nine. After the controversy of Stefan Kiessling's 'phantom' goal that helped Leverkusen to a 2-1 win at Hoffenheim, Sami Hyypia's side crushed Shakhtar Donetsk 4-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday and now host Augsburg on Saturday. Further down the table, 16th-placed Nuremberg are still without a win as they prepare to face Stuttgart away on Friday in what will be Dutchman Gertjan Verbeek's first game in charge since he was appointed as the successor to the sacked Michael Wiesinger.

PSG recorded their biggest European away win as they took Anderlecht apart in Brussels, Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring four times and Edinson Cavani once in a 5-0 victory. Ibrahimovic's evening featured a hat-trick in the space of 19 first-half minutes, with his third goal a ferocious volley from 30 yards that brought many of the home supporters to their feet.

399,22/10/2013,02:05,"Football: United, Juventus, out for European boost",Both Manchester United and Juventus will be looking to get some succour from Europe after disappointing results in their domestic leagues at the weekend while Welsh star Gareth Bale could make only his second start of the season for Real Madrid after a succession of niggling injuries:,"Group A Bayer Leverkusen (GER) v Shakhtar Donetsk (UKR) Leverkusen limbered up for this match in controversial fashion, beating Hoffenheim 2-1 courtesy of a 'phantom' goal - Stefan Kiessling heading the winner via a hole in the side netting. While the Bundesliga powers that be mull over what to do about the result Leverkusen are lying third, one point behind Bayern Munich, their best ever domestic start. Rolled over by Manchester United in their Group A opener the Germans got their European bid up and running at the second attempt, against Real Sociedad. Shakhtar, second only on goal difference to United, will be keen to dispel memories of last season's trip to Germany when the wheels came off their campaign with a 3-0 last 16 loss at Borussia Dortmund. The Ukrainian champions, appearing at the group stage for the fourth successive season, have begun brightly with a win over Real Sociedad and a draw against United. Manchester United (ENG) v Real Sociedad (ESP) United may be enduring a torrid start to the  Premier League, the weekend draw with Southampton leaving the titleholders in unusual territory - eighth place and their worst start in 24 years. Europe has proved more forgiving, with David Moyes' side topping Group A on goal difference after the Leverkusen win and Shakhtar stalemate. Pointless Real need to leave Old Trafford with something if they are to inject some life into their first CL campaign in a decade. Whatever happens the outcome is unlikely to be as harsh as their only previous visit to England, when they crashed 6-0 at Liverpool in the 1975/76 UEFA Cup. They received a welcome boost for this first ever meeting between the two teams with a 2-1 win over Valencia in La Liga at the weekend. Group B Real Madrid (ESP) v Juventus (ITA) Real Madrid are sailing regally to the knockout stages, the Spaniards' topping Group B after crushing defeats of FC Copenhagen and Galatasaray. Real could field Gareth Bale, who returned to action after minor injuries as a late substitute in Saturday's 2-0 win over Malaga which left Carlo Ancelotti's men in third. Juve's visit precedes the first 'el clasico' of the season with a trip to Barcelona looming at the weekend. Xabi Alonso, sidelined since fracturing a foot in August, is full recovered but unlikely to be thrust straight back into the fray. With two draws Juve are waiting for their first win, and hardly had the best preparations for the trip to the Bernabeu a 4-2 loss, their first of the season, to Fiorentina. Coach Antonio Conte spoke about ""a massive test', adding: ""Madrid are arguably one of the most ambitious teams. We're facing a club that really want this title, because of their history and their hunt for a tenth European Cup."" Galatasaray (TUR) FC Copenhagen (DEN) Both teams, with one point apiece, are out to bag their first wins in Istanbul. Galatasaray picked themselves up from an opening drubbing by Real to share the spoils with Juventus. Having made it into the knockout stages last season they need to get moving if they are to have any hope of repeating that feat this time against Danish champions Copenhagen. Group C Anderlecht (BEL) v Paris Saint Germain (FRA) Paris Saint Germain should be anticipating a third successive win in three Champions League games as they face an Anderlecht side devoid of confidence and pointless. Ligue 1 leaders after trouncing Bastia at the weekend PSG will be without defender Christophe Jallet, Javier Pastore and Thiago Silva, all injured but such are the riches at coach Laurent Blanc's disposal that their absences shouldn't matter. Anderlecht coach John van den Brom sent out the youngest team in the club's history for the 2-0 league win over Mons last Friday and could well do the same on Wednesday where out of form skipper Guillaume Gillet is likely to start on the bench. Benfica (POR) v Olympiakos (GRE) Both these sides will see the outcome of their two matches as pivotal as to who finishes second and a place in the knockout phase. Both have one win to their credit in the opening two games, over hapless Anderlecht. Benfica will fancy their chances for this game as they have won their last seven European home matches while Olympiakos have yet to beat Portuguese opposition away and have not managed a goal in five trips to Portugal. Olympiakos have been in imperious form in their own league, winning seven and drawing one of the matches, the latest a 4-1 away win against Platanias on Saturday. Group D CSKA Moscow (RUS) v Manchester City (ENG) Both will fancy their chances of taking the runners up spot with Pilsen pretty much out of the running and while City have a woeful away record losing five of their six Champions League away games in the past two campaigns they have a chance of recording their second successive away win this season as CSKA have a poor home record, taking just three points from a possible nine in their last appearance in the CL in 2011/12. City warmed up with a psychological boosting first away win in the Premier League on Saturday, 3-1 at West Ham with Sergio Aguero key to the victory. City manager Manuel Pellegrini believes he now has the squad strength to make an impact both domestically and on the continent. CSKA by contrast are now winless and goalless in their last five domestic matches and without playmaker Alan Dzagoev, who is injured. Bayern Munich (GER) v Viktoria Pilsen (CZE) Holders Bayern should have little trouble in making it nine points from three games against pointless Pilsen although coach Pep Guardiola wants to see a marked improvement in their first-half displays which have been generally lethargic all season. The hosts, though, will be missing Swiss midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri and Brazilian defender Dante, who are both injured, while Guardiola will hope that resting French star Franck Ribery at the weekend has allowed him to recover fully from a sore ankle. Pilsen may be struggling to make an impression on the Champions League but they said on Monday they had won an important battle to retain the services of their coach Pavel Vrba, who has guided them to two titles since arriving in 2008. However, they are presently trailing leaders Sparta Prague by six points and have just one win from their last four games."

Having last lost in the German league back in October 2012, Bayern are now just two matches short of equalling Hamburg's 30-year-old, 36-match streak. Bayern were punished for a poor first-half in Munich when Mainz striker Shawn Parker fired home after capitalising on a mistake by centre-back Jerome Boateng. But Bayern roared back when Germany midfielder Mario Goetze came off the bench for the second-half and played a key part in the hosts' first three second-half goals. His dream pass through to Arjen Robben allowed the winger to equalise on 50 minutes and two minutes later, Goetze combined with the Dutchman for Germany's Thomas Mueller to fire home to make it 2-1. With Bayern finally making their 80 percent possession pay off, Goetze fired in a cross for Mario Mandzukic to score their third on 69 minutes. And when Bayern vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was fouled in the area, Mueller stepped up to drill home the penalty for his second of the game eight minutes from time. Bayer Leverkusen had briefly gone top on Friday thanks to a controversial 'phantom' goal in their 2-1 win at Hoffenheim. The German Football Federation (DFB) will investigate on Monday while Hoffenheim have called for a replay after Stefan Kiessling's 70th-minute winner came in bizarre circumstances. Replays showed his header only ended in the back of the net after flying through a hole in the side netting. Schalke 04, who host Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday, needed a 91st-minute winner from Roman Neustaedter to seal a 3-2 win at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Dortmund, who are at Arsenal on Tuesday in the Champions League, stayed second with a hard-fought 1-0 win at home to Hanover 96. Germany winger Marco Reus hit the winning penalty after just four minutes when Hanover's Japan defender Hiroki Sakai fouled left-back Erik Durm in the area.

Bayern were punished for a poor first-half in Munich when Mainz striker Shawn Parker fired home after capitalising on a mistake by centre-back Jerome Boateng. But Bayern roared back when Germany midfielder Mario Goetze came off the bench for the second-half and played a key part in the hosts' first three second-half goals. ""We really, really struggled in the first half and we tended to lack concentration,"" admitted Bayern captain Philipp Lahm. ""It happens frequently after international breaks, and we need to get a grip on it as soon as we can. ""We switched things around a little after that and it paid off, but credit to Mainz, they made life very difficult for us."" Goetze made the difference and his dream pass through to Arjen Robben allowed the winger to equalise on 50 minutes and two minutes later, Goetze combined with the Dutchman for Germany's Thomas Mueller to fire home to make it 2-0. With Bayern finally making their 80 percent possession pay off, Goetze fired in a cross for Mario Mandzukic to score their third on 69 minutes. And when Bayern vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was fouled in the area, Mueller stepped up to drill home the penalty for his second of the game eight minutes from time to make it 4-1. ""We were like a 1970s VW Beetle and you can't dream of winning a race against a Formula One car,"" admitted Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel.

Traditionally a strong mid-table side, Mainz have had an erratic start to the season, winning their first three league games then losing their next four before drawing with Hoffenheim a fortnight ago. Bayern midfielder Mario Goetze scored for Germany in Tuesday's 5-3 win over Stockholm and is back in contention for selection after an ankle injury. Goetze is hoping for an appearance against Mainz after a long lay-off having damaged his ankle after returning from April's hamstring injury at the start of the season. ""(The Sweden game) was important for me after so long out,"" said Goetze."" ""How long I will play for against Mainz is down to the coach. ""I'm just looking forwards and am excited about the future -- hopefully without injury."" Bayern, who host Czech side Viktoria Pilsen on Wednesday and are top of their Champions League group, are without Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri until December after he returned from international duty with a torn hamstring. Mainz are waiting on the fitness of striker Nicolai Mueller, who has six goals this season, after the 26-year-old twisted an ankle in training on Wednesday. Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel described the training ground accident as ""one of those awful moments"" and the guests need their top scorer at Munich's Allianz Arena.

Senegal striker Mame Diouf returned to full Hanover training on Tuesday, having torn a thigh muscle in September, and could feature at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. Hanover's Ivory Coast winger Didier Ya Konan is definitely out for the rest of the year after surgery on an ankle injury.

""It's great to get the hat-trick, but it's more important that things went so well for the team,"" said Lasogga, who claimed the fastest away hat-trick in Bundesliga history. This was only the second game for Van Marwijk, 61, who coached Holland to the 2010 World Cup final. He replaced Thorsten Fink last month after a disastrous start left Hamburg in the relegation places. The Dutchman has promised to tighten Hamburg's defence, but it was their attack which ran riot at Nuremberg. ""I like attacking football, although tactical discipline belongs to that and we still lose the ball too often, but it's getting better,"" said Van Marwijk, whose reign opened with a draw at Frankfurt last week. ""A 5-0 win doesn't happen every week, but it's important to help the self-confidence come back."" Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart opened the scoring with a superb scissor-kick volley on 17 minutes. The Hamburg captain then provided the final passes for Lasogga to fire home his first two goals while the ex-Hertha Berlin forward completed the hat-trick when he pounced on a loose ball and smashed his shot inside the inside post. Midfielder Tolgay Arslan bagged the fifth 16 minutes from time to leave Nuremberg reeling. The rout lifts Hamburg up to 14th, while Nuremberg slip into the bottom three. On Saturday, European champions Bayern Munich went top for the first time under Pep Guardiola after a 1-1 draw at Bayer Leverkusen. Bayern extended their unbeaten run to 33 Bundesliga games and are closing in on Hamburg's record of 36, set in January 1983, as the Bavarians returned to the site of their last league defeat in October 2012.

In a high-tempo clash at Leverkusen's BayArena, Germany midfielder Sidney Sam's 31st-minute equaliser for the hosts cancelled out Toni Kroos' opening goal for Bayern. Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno guaranteed a point for his side by denying Franck Ribery twice in as many second-half minutes, then Mario Goetze, while Thomas Mueller had a penalty appeal turned down. But Guardiola was a picture of frustration, brooding on the Bayern bench and drumming his fingers as Bayern enjoyed 27 shots on goal and 78 percent possession, but managed just a single goal. The point was enough to send Bayern top, with Leverkusen third, behind Borussia Dortmund. Fresh from their impressive 3-0 Champions League win over Marseille, Dortmund were set to claim an away point until a disastrous final 10-minute spell, triggered by Mats Hummels' red card. The Germany defender was sent off on 81 minutes after a reckless challenge on 'Gladbach's Norway midfielder Havard Nordtveit in the area. Germany striker Max Kruse netted the resulting penalty, then Brazilian forward Raffael hit their second four minutes from time to see 'Gladbach move up to fourth. Schalke 04 came from behind to claim a 4-1 win over 10-man Augsburg in Gelsenkirchen to move up to eighth. VfB Stuttgart dropped to seventh after their 1-1 draw at home to Werder Bremen while Hoffenheim stayed 10th with a 2-2 draw at Mainz. Eintracht Braunschweig, who have been bottom of the table since last season's promotion, picked up their first win of the season with a shock 2-0 victory at VfL Wolfsburg -- their first Bundesliga victory since 1985. Despite the win, Braunschweig stay bottom of the table on goal difference but level on points with 17th-placed Freiburg who drew 1-1 at home to ten-man Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday."

Stefan has said he would,"" Voeller revealed to German daily Die Welt. Loew has selected Borussia Moenchengladbach striker Max Kruse as his only forward for Friday's World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in Cologne and against Sweden in Stockholm four days later. With 25 goals in 34 Bundesliga games last season, and five in seven league matches this term, Kiessling's goal-scoring ability in without question. But having consistently been ignored by Loew, the relationship is strained and the issue should have been addressed much earlier, according to Voeller. ""The conversation was constructive and should have taken place somewhat earlier. It would have saved a lot of stress,"" added Voeller. ""He (Kiessling) does not want to be a stand-in, but when he is needed, then he will be there. ""If he plays as well as he did last season, then it's going to be very difficult for the national team coach not to take him to the World Cup anyway, regardless of Gomez and Klose."""

Leverkusen lost 4-2 to Manchester United at Old Trafford in their opening Group A match a fortnight ago, while Real lost their opener 2-0 at home against Shakhtar Donetsk. Bayer warmed up for Wednesday's clash at Leverkusen's BayArena with a 2-0 win at home to Hanover 96 on Saturday to stay third in the Bundesliga and Hyypia has said his team can do better against Jagoba Arrasate's Real Sociedad side. ""Defensively we played well for almost the whole 90 minutes, but going forward we can play much better and that's something we have to look at,"" said Hyypia. According to British media reports, Arsenal are keen to sign Bayer midfielder Lars Bender for 24 million euros (Â£20m), but Leverkusen have said the Germany star is not for sale. Bender is under contract until June 2017 and has no get-out clause. While Leverkusen have no significant injury concerns, Real are without captain and playmaker Xabi Prieto, who picked up a hamstring injury in the 4-1 defeat at Barcelona last week. Attacking midfielder Esteban Granero is another significant absentee, while French winger Antoine Griezmann faces a race to be fit on time. Mid-table in La Liga, Real have not won since beating Lyon 2-0 away in the Champions League play-offs in August and badly need a win after three defeats and three draws. Defender Carlos Martinez says that the side who finished fourth in the Spanish league last season to qualify for the Champions League must rediscover their scoring touch soon. ""Last year we started badly too and then look what happened. Then we were scoring with half a chance and right now we need four or five to score, but this will change,"" said Martinez, who played in the 1-1 draw at home to Sevilla on Saturday. ""We know that we have a great team. ""The opponents are coming to close down our game, not let us play and try to catch us on the counter-attack, but at the end we were on the verge of winning (against Sevilla). ""Now we need to go to Leverkusen and get something from the game because the group stages are very short and we lost in the first game. ""We will give it our all."""
426,01/10/2013,02:30,"Football: Pellegrini, Guardiola meet again, United face tough test","Manchester City's home clash with Pep Guardiola's reigning European champions Bayern Munich will capture the imagination of most on Wednesday evening, while the pressure is on David Moyes as Manchester United face Shakhtar Donetsk.","AFP Sport looks ahead to all eight of Wednesday's fixtures on matchday two: Group A Bayer Leverkusen (GER) v Real Sociedad (ESP) Both Leverkusen and Real Sociedad are looking to get their campaigns up and running after suffering defeats on matchday one. Leverkusen went down 4-2 to Manchester United at Old Trafford in their opening game, while the Basque side lost 2-0 at home against Shakhtar Donetsk. Sami Hyypia's team will fancy their chances of registering all three points at the BayArena, however, fresh as they are from a third straight Bundesliga win on Saturday against Hannover. While they are enjoying their best start to a league season, Real, in contrast, have gone six games without a win, their worst sequence of results in two years, and coach Jagoba Arrasate is without Esteban Granero and the influential Xabi Prieto for the trip to Germany. Shakhtar Donetsk (UKR) v Manchester United (ENG) A trip to deepest Ukraine is surely the last thing that David Moyes wanted as the pressure builds on the Scotsman following Manchester United's worst start to a domestic campaign in 24 years. United's 2-1 home loss to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday was their third defeat already in just six Premier League games, but at least Moyes oversaw a 4-2 win against Bayer Leverkusen in his opening Champions League group game in charge a fortnight ago. Wayne Rooney scored twice in that game and Moyes - who has admitted his side lack sufficient world-class talent to win the Champions League - will need the England star at his best in the Donbass Arena. Shakhtar needed a late comeback to draw 2-2 away to unheralded local rivals Metalurg at the weekend but their European opener was an impressive 2-0 win at Real Sociedad and they have previous against English opposition, beating Chelsea at home last season. Group B Real Madrid (ESP) v FC Copenhagen (DEN) After the humiliation of losing the Madrid derby at the weekend, Real coach Carlo Ancelotti knows the importance of getting back to winning ways in Europe. The visit of a Copenhagen side who sit second from bottom of the Danish league and lost 3-2 to Brondby at the weekend should provide the perfect opportunity for the Spanish giants, although Stale Solbakken's men did hold Juventus in their opening Group B game. Iker Casillas will make his first appearance at the Santiago Bernabeu in almost nine months as Ancelotti again gives the nod to the Spain captain ahead of Diego Lopez in goal in Europe. Gareth Bale could also make his first start at home for his new club, who thumped Galatasaray 6-1 away last time out. Juventus (ITA) v Galatasaray (TUR) After being held by Copenhagen two weeks ago, Italian champions Juventus chase a first win in Group B as they play host to Galatasaray, who are seeking an improvement on their 6-1 thumping at the hands of Real Madrid. Antonio Conte's Juve, who won the last of their two European Cups in 1996, beat city rivals Torino 1-0 at the weekend thanks to a Paul Pogba strike and remain unbeaten in all competitions this season, even if they trail Roma by two points at the top of Serie A. The Turks come into the game with a new coach who is familiar with taking on Juve. Former Lazio, Inter Milan and Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini was on Monday appointed as the replacement for the sacked Fatih Terim. His remit is to revive a side who sit in mid-table in their domestic league with just one win from five games. Group C Anderlecht (BEL) v Olympiakos (GRE) Belgian champions Anderlecht and Greek title-holders Olympiakos are, on paper, the outsiders to qualify from Group C and both were beaten on matchday one. Anderlecht went down 2-0 away to Benfica while Olympiakos were outclassed in a 4-1 home loss to Paris Saint-Germain. The Belgians have a proud history and beat AEK Athens home and away when they last faced Greek opponents in the Europa League two years ago, but John Van den Brom's men are fourth in their domestic Pro League, nine points behind leaders Standard, and appear ill-equipped to make an impact in this competition. Olympiakos, who have lost 99 times in Europe, are top of the Greek Super League without defeat and may fancy their chances of recording an away win here. Paris Saint-Germain (FRA) v Benfica (POR) Paris Saint-Germain underlined their status as Group C favourites by thumping Olympiakos in Greece two weeks ago, and can take a big step towards qualifying for the last 16 by beating Benfica at the Parc des Princes. Laurent Blanc's side have struggled to convince so far this season, but remain unbeaten in all competitions while Benfica - who beat Anderlecht 2-0 in their opening game - are only fifth in the Portuguese top flight, five points behind leaders Porto. However, the Lisbon club can expect a warm backing in the French capital, which is home to a large Portuguese population. PSG will be without captain Thiago Silva due to injury as they chase revenge for a defeat to the same team in the Europa League last 16 in 2011. Group D CSKA Moscow (RUS) v Viktoria Pilsen (CZE) The poor state of the Arena Khimki pitch in Moscow led to this match being moved 700 kilometres to St Petersburg. CSKA and the Czech champions both lost their opening games and are expected to fight it out for third place in Group D behind Bayern Munich and Manchester City. CSKA's preparations for this encounter have not been the best - they lost 2-0 at Terek Grozny at the weekend and have failed to win, or even score, in their last three domestic matches. In contrast, Pavel Vrba's Pilsen are still unbeaten in the Czech league and have won five and lost two of their last seven European away games. Manchester City (ENG) v Bayern Munich (GER) This encounter at the Etihad Stadium promises to be fascinating, with City manager Manuel Pellegrini coming up against Bayern's Pep Guardiola again. The pair are familiar with one another from their time in Spain, in particular when they occupied the dugouts at Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively in 2009-10. The two Group D favourites meet on the back of wins in their opening matches, with City triumphing away to Viktoria Pilsen while Bayern beat CSKA Moscow at home. Goals from David Silva and Yaya Toure gave City a 2-0 win when they played host to Bayern in this competition two years ago, but the English side have failed to progress beyond the group stage in either of the last two years while Bayern are the reigning European champions."

The 25-year-old Traore then scored his first league goal of the season when he latched onto Christian Gentner's pass behind the defence to slot home on 76 minutes. Traore then found acres of space on the left wing and his cross was converted by Austria's Martin Harnik four minutes from time to inflict a sixth defeat from seven games on Braunschweig. Earlier, Werder Bremen and Nuremberg fought out a six-goal thriller with Dutch winger Eljero Elia scoring twice for the hosts for a 3-3 draw. Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake played a key role in sparking Nuremberg's fight back from 2-0 down with a first-half goal before his superb pass saw Czech midfielder Adam Hlousek hit the equaliser. Bremen raced into a 2-0 lead after Nuremberg defender Berkay Dabanli turned the ball into his own net before Elia bagged his first with a superb shot on 34 minutes. Nuremberg fought back after Kiyotake produced a goal from nothing just before the break, then Josip Drmic made it 2-2 early in the second half. Former Juventus star Elia restored Bremen's lead with a thunderbolt shot from outside the area with 66 minutes gone before Kiyotake's through ball saw Hlousek hit the equaliser to share the points.

Guardiola took off Arjen Robben, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mario Mandzukic in the second-half with one eye on the trip to England, but Bayern were far from impressive.

Pep Guardiola's side go into the weekend's matches in second place in the table, trailing leaders Borussia Dortmund on goals scored before facing the Wolves at the Allianz Arena. Having blitzed Schalke 4-0 in Gelsenkirchen last Saturday in the league and routed Hanover 96 4-1 in the German Cup on Wednesday, Bayern are showing signs of further progress under Guardiola since he succeeded Jupp Heynckes as head coach in June. Bayern saw off Hanover with a side featuring the likes of Diego Contento, Xherdan Shaqiri, Daniel van Buyten and Claudio Pizarro as Guardiola rotated his squad before Saturday's visit of the Wolves and next Wednesday's Champions League clash away to Manchester City. However, the reigning European champions want more silverware and are endlessly looking for ways to improve, so there was a little frustration with the nature of Wednesday's performance. ""We shifted down a gear after going 2-0 up and Hanover were immediately right back in the game, we can't let that happen again,"" said Thomas Mueller, who scored twice in the German Cup second-round win. In contrast, Wolfsburg team manager Mike Schuessler admitted he ""didn't find many weaknesses"" after watching Guardiola's Bayern, while director of sport Klaus Allofs said: ""We'll need a good performance to get a result there."" Ex-Bayern midfielder Luiz Gustavo will be back in the Wolfsburg side after serving a one-match ban while another former Munich star, Ivica Olic, should be able to play despite carrying an ankle injury and Brazilian midfielder Diego should be fit too. Bayern have no new injury concerns with Spain midfielders Javi Martinez and Thiago Alcantara working their way back to fitness after minor operations. Elsewhere, league leaders Dortmund host Freiburg on Saturday with a question mark over left-back Marcel Schmelzer after the Germany defender aggravated a thigh injury in the 2-0 German Cup win over second-division 1860 Munich. Schmelzer is back in training, ""but whether that is enough for Saturday, we'll have to see,"" said coach Jurgen Klopp, whose team face Marseille in the Champions League next Tuesday. Dortmund are definitely without right-back Lukasz Piszczek, who is recovering from hip and groin surgery, midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, who has a back injury, and captain Sebastian Kehl, who has torn ankle ligaments. Dortmund dropped their first points of the season in last Saturday's 1-1 draw at Nuremberg, while Freiburg have yet to win a match this season after three draws and three defeats. Bayer Leverkusen boss Sami Hyypia has said there will be changes to his team on Saturday at fourth-place Hanover 96 ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Spain's Real Sociedad. However, Australia's Robbie Kruse is looking to make his second start for the club after netting twice in last Saturday's 4-1 rout of Mainz. Ex-Holland coach Bert van Marwijk has taken charge at struggling Hamburg, and the Hanseatic club are looking for only their second win of the season as they go to Eintracht Frankfurt. HSV are already in the relegation zone after a disastrous start to the season and the 61-year-old van Marwijk was named as Thorsten Fink's successor on Monday after signing a two-year deal worth 1.4 million euros ($1.9 million) a year. ""My mission is to look at the structures in place and clarify the style of play,"" said Van Marwijk, who inherits a side who have been routed 5-1 and 6-2 by Hoffenheim and Dortmund respectively this season. ""We have to leave the bottom of the table as quickly as possible."" Fixtures (kick-offs 1330 GMT unless stated)"

Guardiola's Bayern are second, but level on both points and goal difference with league leaders Dortmund, who host second-from-bottom Freiburg on Saturday, and the Bavarians are eager to finish the weekend on top. Bayern face Manchester City on Wednesday in their second Champions League match and want to make sure of another three points against sixth-placed Wolfsburg. ""Only a win will count for us against Wolfsburg,"" insisted captain Philipp Lahm after Munich's 4-1 win over Hanover 96 on Wednesday sent them into the third round of the German Cup. ""We can be very happy with our recent performances, we are definitely on the right path."" Germany star Thomas Mueller scored twice against Hanover while veteran striker Claudio Pizarro, who netted a first-half goal, said Bayern are hitting form under Guardiola but must keep improving with City looming. ""When we use our chances, we are difficult to stop, but after going 2-0 up against Hanover, we stopped doing that,"" said the 34-year-old. ""It was okay to do that against Hanover but against a bigger team it can be deadly and we mustn't allow that to happen."" Having been 2-1 up at halftime, Bayern pulled away in the second half with a second goal from Mueller before France winger Franck Ribery hit their fourth. Guardiola, who succeeded Jupp Heynckes as Bayern coach in June after the team won the treble of European, league and cup titles last season, said he was pleased to see Munich's fighting spirit come out. ""We played well, although in the last ten to 15 minutes of the first-half we lost our shape,"" said Guardiola. ""But I was surprised how we played in the second half. With our mentality, we started playing forwards again."" With five goals after the first two rounds of the German Cup, Bayern's Mueller again showed lethal finishing against Hanover. ""He is always dangerous, whether he scores with the head, chest or shoulder,"" said Lahm, after Mueller's first goal flew in off his chest."

445,17/09/2013,02:06,Football: Resurgent Schalke out to see off Steaua,Rejuvenated Schalke 04 will be hoping to continue their winning form since Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng's arrival as they tackle Steaua Bucharest in the Champions League on Wednesday.,"Having only signed from AC Milan in August, the former Portsmouth and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder helped break Schalke's worrying early season slump when he made his debut in the 2-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen. The 26-year-old then scored his first goal for the club in Saturday's 1-0 victory over Mainz to leave Schalke unbeaten in their last three games, starting with their dramatic 3-2 win at Greece's PAOK in the Champions League play-off. UEFA rules stipulate Boateng is cleared to play for Schalke in the Champions League even though he scored twice for AC Milan in their play-off win over PSV Eindhoven. The uncompromising Ghana international has added some backbone to Schalke's midfield alongside talented teenager Julian Draxler and insists spirits are high in the Royal Blues camp. ""We're up for it, that's clear,"" said Berlin-born Boateng, whose half-brother Jerome plays for European champions Bayern Munich and Germany. ""We were defensively very strong in Mainz, you have to pay the boys in defence a compliment. ""We have to do that again against Steaua and if that works, I think we'll be able to get a positive result."" With Schalke currently mid table in the Bundesliga, victory over Steaua in Group E would relieve the pressure on coach Jens Keller. Schalke will feel they have a good chance of progressing in a group in which Jose Mourinho's Chelsea are the favourites and will see the Germans travel to Swiss champions FC Basel in a fortnight. The Royal Blues' main injury worry is Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who has been out for the last five games with a knee injury. After finishing fourth in the Bundesliga last season, Schalke needed a gutsy away win in Greece to come through the play-offs and reach the Champions League group stages in a competition in which they reached the semi-finals in 2011. After a 1-1 home draw with PAOK in the play-offs, Jens Keller's side faced an uphill task in the return in Greece when striker Adam Szalai's opening goal was cancelled out and midfielder Jermaine Jones was sent off. But Draxler and Szalai struck second-half goals to steer Schalke through 4-3 on aggregate. Romanian champions Steaua, the 1986 European Cup winners, came through three qualifying rounds to return to the group stage for the first time since 2008-09. Currently fourth in the Romanian league, Steaua made three signings on transfer deadline day, including experienced Greek international forward Pantelis Kapetanos, back after more than two years at CFR Cluj. The 30-year-old scored 27 league goals in his first spell at the club, between July 2008 and January 2011. Cape Verde Islands international centre-back Fernando Varela was also brought in to replace Vlad Chiriches, who was sold to Tottenham Hotspur. While Schalke reached the last 16 last season before losing to Galatasaray, the stats are against Steaua, who have won just four of their 36 matches in their seven Champions League campaigns so far. Their last victory came at Dynamo Kiev more than seven yers ago and since then they have recorded two draws and six defeats."
446,16/09/2013,12:46,Football: Leverkusen's Castro out of United clash,Bayer Leverkusen's defensive midfielder Gonzalo Castro is out of Tuesday's Champions League clash against Manchester United at Old Trafford after tearing his hamstring.,"The 26-year-old, who made the last of his five Germany appearances in 2007, sustained the injury in the closing stages of Saturday's 3-1 Bundesliga win over VfL Wolfsburg, which kept them third, before Monday's diagnosis. Midfielder Lars Bender, who sat out the Wolfsburg match, is set to deputise, providing he has fully recovered from the hip injury which kept him out of Germany's World Cup qualifiers earlier this month. ""I feel fit again. There is nothing standing in the way of me playing,"" Bender told SID, an AFP subsidiary. Leverkusen, back in the Champions League after a year's absence, are up against a United side who enjoyed their first win at home under David Moyes on Saturday after both Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney scored in the 2-0 win over Crystal Palace. Sami Hyypia-coached Leverkusen have won four of their five Bundesliga matches so far this season and are third behind leaders Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in the German league."
447,16/09/2013,02:33,"Football: Pressure off Bayer in Manchester, says Son",South Korea's Son Heung-Min has said the pressure will be off Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday at Manchester United with coach David Moyes under the spotlight in his first Champions League match.,"Son says Leverkusen have little to lose with the focus on Moyes at Old Trafford as he begins the next chapter in United's proud European history having succeeded the legendary Alex Ferguson. ""The mood is good in the Bayer squad and we don't have much to lose in England,"" the 21-year-old striker told AFP. ""Manchester United are the clear favourites. ""That's not the worst position to go into a game and it's obviously a great start for us. ""Old Trafford is one of the most famous stadiums in the world and Manchester United are one of the world's biggest clubs. ""United haven't had perhaps the best start to the season, but there is no need to discuss the quality of the trainer and the team. ""David Moyes coached Everton for years, he has plenty of Premier League experience and he has got a world-class team. ""It is going to be special to play there, for sure."" While there will be lots of interest in Bayer, Son says there is no pressure to emulate their Bundesliga rivals Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, who contested May's Champions League final at Wembley. ""No one would expect that from us and we'd be well advised not to build castles in the sky and just take it one step at a time,"" he said. ""We want to play at the top of the Bundesliga, the way Bayer did last season, and in the Champions League, we want to get through the group phase. ""That will be hard enough with Manchester United, Shakhtar Donetsk and Real Sociedad in our group. ""But we're highly motivated and not an easy opponent for the others either."" Son's hunger for Champions League football took him from Hamburg, whom he joined as a raw 16-year-old in 2008, to Leverkusen in July to work under Sami Hyypia, the ex-Liverpool captain. A host of Premier League clubs -- including Manchester United -- were reported to have courted the talented striker, but his desire for regular football saw him opt for Leverkusen. Son has started on the left wing in all five of Leverkusen's five Bundesliga matches this season, scoring in the opening 3-1 win against Freiburg. Having spent five years here, Son speaks excellent German, but admits it was a culture shock to switch his home town of Chuncheon for Hanseatic Hamburg. ""I was 16 when I first came to Germany. At first I shared a small flat with two other South Korean boys and my parents later followed me to Hamburg,"" he said. ""In the beginning, I couldn't make myself understood, neither in English nor German, so obviously I was helped by a translator. ""But I learnt the language fast at school and now I don't have any problems. ""It was a big step for a 16-year-old, especially as I entered a completely different culture. You can't compare the two countries. ""I feel good in Germany. South Korea will always be my home and I enjoy the time I spend there for internationals or holidays. ""You can't fly there for a weekend and there aren't many chances to go home. ""Germany and South Korea are vastly different but I like that, I value the different mentalities in both countries."""
448,16/09/2013,02:10,Football: Leverkusen baptism for newcomer Moyes,David Moyes will sample the Champions League group phase for the first time on Tuesday when his Manchester United side host Bayer Leverkusen in their opening Group A fixture.,"Moyes was selected to succeed Alex Ferguson as United manager at the end of last season despite having only overseen two matches in the competition during his 11-year tenure at Everton. Those games, in 2005, saw the Merseyside club beaten 4-2 by Villarreal over two legs in the third qualifying round, but Moyes is relishing the prospect of a second bite at the apple. ""I am really excited to be involved in it,"" he told United's in-house television station, MUTV. ""I have been in the Champions League before but I have not made the group stage. I had quite a few episodes in the Europa League, which were good, but nothing at the level of the Champions League. ""We will do our homework to make sure we are as prepared as we can be."" United are the only genuine European heavyweights in the group, but with Shakhtar Donetsk and Real Sociedad making up the pool, there is not a weak team in Group A either. Moyes says that although things could have been better, they could also have been a lot worse. ""It was the first time I have been involved in a draw at that level,"" said the Scot. ""When the names came out, there were some that I didn't want and others I would have been happy with. Relatively, I am quite pleased. ""To draw Real Sociedad out of the last pot was a tough one. They have done well in Spain this year and had a great result against Lyon to get into the group stage. ""That put a little bit of a downer on it. In addition, Leverkusen are doing well in Germany and we also have the long trip to Donetsk."" Leverkusen finished third in the Bundesliga last season and have won four of their first five games this term, with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich the only sides above them in the table. Their last Champions League experience ended in humiliation, however, with a 10-2 aggregate defeat by Barcelona in the last 16 in February 2012. Manuel Friedrich and Michal Kadlec were subsequently chastised by director of sport Rudi Voller over their eagerness to swap shirts with Lionel Messi, and manager Sami Hyypia has warned his players not to be dazzled by the limelight at Old Trafford. ""I hope my players want to play football in Manchester and not just get autographs from (Wayne) Rooney,"" said the former Liverpool defender, who is also a group-stage novice as a coach. Leverkusen's defenders can expect to see plenty of Rooney on Tuesday, the England striker having returned from a head injury to score a late free-kick in Saturday's 2-0 home win over Crystal Palace. Moyes will be without Nani, however, as the Portuguese winger is suspended due to the controversial red card he was shown when United were eliminated by Real Madrid last season. United also have defenders Rafael da Silva and Phil Jones unavailable due to injury, whereas Hyypia reported no new injury problems after his side's 3-1 defeat of Wolfsburg at the weekend. It is 11 years since Leverkusen stunned United in the Champions League semi-finals, before losing to Real Madrid in the final, and striker Stefan Kiessling knows a sizeable effort will be required to pull off a similar result. ""This is a huge event for us, but we have to give it our all for 90 minutes,"" said the Germany striker, who scored twice against Wolfsburg. Tuesday's game will mark United's first European fixture without Ferguson in the dug-out since a quarter-final defeat by Hungarians FC Videoton in the UEFA Cup in March 1985. Their home form in Ferguson's later years left a lot to be desired, however, and Moyes will hope to improve a record of only three wins in nine European fixtures."

Striker Anthony Modeste gave Hoffenheim the lead just before the break, then provided a superb through ball for Volland to pounce on, turn the defence and hit the bottom right-hand corner. ""It was a great pass from Anthony, things are going well for me, I worked hard in pre-season which gave me confidence,"" said the Germany Under-21 skipper. ""I just want to have a good season with Hoffenheim and anything else would just be a bonus,"" he added when asked about a possible call up to Joachim Loew's senior Germany side. Gladbach pulled a goal back when Swedish striker Branimir Hrgota powered through the Hoffenheim defence fifteen minutes from time, but the defeat left Lucien Favre's side in mid-table. Later, bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig picked up their first point of the season after four defeats with a 1-1 draw at Nuremberg, with the hosts also in the bottom three. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund picked up their fifth win to maintain their 100 percent record with a 6-2 romp at home to Hamburg to stay top of the league. After Pep Guardiola's Bayern had briefly claimed top spot with a 2-0 win over Hanover 96, Dortmund replied by routing Torsten Fink's Hamburg in emphatic style. New signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice, as did Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, as Champions League runners-up Dortmund pulled away after Hamburg had levelled at 2-2. New signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Germany winger Marco Reus also scored as Dortmund took control after Hamburg's defenders Zhi-Gin Lam and Heiko Westermann had put their side level. All four Bundesliga teams -- Dortmund, Bayern, Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke -- warmed-up for their first Champions League matches in mid-week with comfortable wins over the weekend. Bayer Leverkusen prepared for their Old Trafford trip to face Manchester United on Tuesday with a convincing 3-1 win over 10-man VfL Wolfsburg to stay third. Germany winger Sidney Sam put the hosts ahead before Wolfsburg's Croatia striker Ivica Olic levelled just before the break. Stefan Kiessling netted twice to give Leverkusen their fourth win from their opening five games, heading home on 65 minutes before slamming in his second in added time. Wolfsburg were reduced to 10 men when ex-Bayern Munich midfielder Luiz Gustavo was sent off in the final 10 minutes, for the second time this season. The Brazilian had only just returned from suspension after being dismissed in the 2-0 defeat at Mainz at the end of August. Schalke 04, who host Steaua Bucharest on Wednesday, continued their revival by picking up their second victory with a 1-0 win over Mainz. New signing Kevin-Prince Boateng hit the first-half winner in only his second league match since arriving from AC Milan. The victory lifts the Royal Blues up to ninth, while Mainz remain fifth. Werder Bremen crashed to their third straight defeat when they went down 3-0 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt after new signing Franco di Santo was sent off for kicking an opponent in the face. Czech Republic striker Vaclav Kadlec scored two first-half goals before Austria defender Sebastian Proedl added a late own-goal to complete Bremen's misery. Augsburg needed a 90th-minute winner from midfielder Tobias Werner to seal a 2-1 win at home to Freiburg.

451,15/09/2013,11:10,Football: Bayer's Kruse targets strong start at United,Australia's Robbie Kruse has said Bayer Leverkusen need to hit the ground running at Manchester United's Old Trafford on Tuesday to build some Champions League momentum.,"The 24-year-old joined Sami Hyypia's Leverkusen in July from Fortuna Duesseldorf and admits it would be a dream come true to make his Champions League debut against David Moyes' United. ""We are in a difficult group, it's important to start well and this is a tough test, everyone knows how strong Manchester United are, but we have the talent,"" Kruse told AFP. ""If we stick to the game plan, hopefully we can get a good result."" Having come off the bench in Leverkusen's last two Bundesliga matches, Kruse is eager to play on Old Trafford's hallowed turf and make his Champions League debut at the ""Theatre of Dreams"". ""It'll be wonderful just to be in the stadium and to be on the bench and it'll be excellent if I get the chance to come on,"" he said. United's star strikers Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney both netted in Saturday's 2-0 league win over Crystal Palace as Moyes earned his first home win since succeeding Alex Ferguson. But Kruse said the Leverkusen squad are relishing the challenge. ""The boys are up for it. We have a great opportunity to show how good Bayer Leverkusen are and hopefully I can be a part of that,"" he said. ""United are an excellent side on paper, it may be a time of adjustment for them with a new manager, but they still have world-class players with plenty of strength up front."" Bayer face Spain's Real Sociedad, then Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk in consecutive home fixtures next month in Group A and a good result in Manchester would provide momentum. Leverkusen warmed-up for their trip to Manchester with a 3-1 win over 10-man VfL Wolfsburg on Saturday with Germany striker Stefan Kiessling scoring twice as Kruse came off the bench late on. Having been a regular at Duesseldorf last season, Kruse is now battling Germany's Sidney Sam for Leverkusen's right wing berth. With two appearances in Leverkusen's opening five games, Kruse has been described by Hyypia as ""a victim of competition"" in the Bayer squad, but the Socceroos star is biding his time. ""It's been a massive step up, I have gone from knowing I would play every week at Fortuna Duesseldorf to being part of a big squad at Leverkusen,"" said Kruse. ""It's hard to get in and once you're there, you have to play well to keep your place and I have to bide my time. ""It's about being patient and being ready when the chances come."" Kruse describes Bayer boss Hyypia, the ex-Liverpool defender, as a ""wonderful coach"" and is targeting a first-team place to help secure his place with the Australia squad at the Brazil World Cup. Having scored and set up two goals in the 4-0 World Cup qualifier win over Jordan in June, Kruse was in the Australia team humbled 6-0 by hosts Brazil in a friendly earlier this month. The World Cup hosts ran riot in Brasilia on Brazil's independence day, but Kruse said Holger Osieck's Australia team can only learn from the result ahead of next month's friendly with France in Paris. ""Brazil were simply much better than us across the field,"" admitted Kruse. ""It was an embarrassing defeat, but there is no point dwelling on it, we have some games coming up and we still have the World Cup next year. ""They were just better footballers than us and are one of the strongest teams in the world at the moment. ""They picked probably their strongest team, which was playing on their national independence day, we just weren't up to scratch."""

Hamburg responded as defender Zhi-Gin Lam scored his first goal with a thunderbolt from outside the area on 26 minutes, before centre-back Heiko Westermann headed the second on 49 minutes. But Dortmund then hit top gear as Aubameyang grabbed his second by burying Mkhitaryan's pass before the Gabon winger set up Lewandowski for Dortmund's fourth. With Hamburg's defence in disarray, Germany winger Marco Reus slotted past goalkeeper Rene Adler, then Lewandowski compounded the guests' misery when he headed the sixth just shy of the final whistle. Borussia remain the only Bundesliga side with a 100 percent record after five games ahead of Wednesday's trip to Napoli in their Champions League opener. Earlier, second-half goals by Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic and France winger Franck Ribery gave Bayern the three points at Munich's Allianz Arena in their win over Hanover 96. It was the ideal preparation for Pep Guardiola's team who begin their Champions League campaign at home to CSKA Moscow on Tuesday, but director of sport Matthias Sammer was far from happy.

458,13/09/2013,02:20,Football: Bayern bosses turn up heat on Guardiola,Bayern Munich's bosses have put pressure on coach Pep Guardiola ahead of Saturday's Bundesliga home match with Hanover 96 as the European champions enter a tough few weeks.,"Bayern are second in the Bundesliga behind rivals Borussia Dortmund and launch the defence of their Champions League title against CSKA Moscow next Tuesday. Then follows an away trip to Schalke 04, home matches against Hanover, again, in the cup, Wolfsburg in the league, then a Champions League away trip to Manchester City before facing Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga -- all in the next three weeks. Despite their punishing schedule, Bayern's top brass expect their side to prove they are just as strong under Guardiola as they were under his predecessor Jupp Heynckes. ""We have to immediately go full throttle and tackle our work with hunger, as we did so phenomenally last season,"" president Uli Hoeness told German daily Bild. Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge also said there can be no more excuses. ""We're at the stage where you can't allow for any more weaknesses"", he said, refering to Bayern's 1-1 draw at Freiburg a fortnight ago. Stern-faced director of sport Matthias Sammer also described the result as ""reckless and annoying"" after Guardiola fielded a weakened side. Dutch winger Arjen Robben beleives Bayern must quickly turn their attantions back to the league, having had a host of players on recent international duty. ""We have to hit the ground running and switch back to Bundesliga mode, Hanover won't give us time to settle,"" said Robben. ""We must be careful they don't hit us on the counter-attack, they'll be strong."" Bayern have a few injury problems with central midfielders Mario Goetze, Thiago Alcantara, plus defensive midfielders Javi Martinez and Jan Kirchoff on the sidelines. But they expect to have Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger back as their vice-captain trained on Thursday after spraining his ankle at Freiburg. With four games played, Bayern are two points behind leaders Borussia, something which does not bother Robben. ""Dortmund is not the most important thing for us, we have to deal with ourselves,"" said the Dutch winger. ""Of course, we want to be at the top of the league, but you can only do that if you win."" Dortmund, the only team with a 100 percent record, host Hamburg on Saturday with concerns over Poland midfielder Jakub Blaszczykowski, who injured knee ligaments on international duty. ""It has got better, but it's still not good, it'll be close,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. Striker Robert Lewandowski is expected to be fit after suffering a knee strain while midfielder Marco Reus has trained since Wednesday after missing Germany's World Cup qualifier against Faroe Islands on Tuesday with an upset stomach. Schalke 04 warm-up for Wednesday's opening Champions League visit by Steaua Bucharest with a trip to mid-table Mainz and are hoping Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar will soon be back after a knee injury. ""He's still not an option for the weekend, but for the game against Bucharest, we'll have to wait and see,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. Schalke are out to prove their victory over Bayer Leverkusen a fortnight ago was no fluke, with their Hungary striker Adam Szalai facing his former club. But new signing Kevin-Prince Boateng is an injury concern, having pulled out of Ghana's international last week with a knee injury."

""We need to talk about things in the next few days and weeks,"" Hopp has told magazine Sport Bild, but Wiese has said he has no interest in dissolving his Hoffenheim contract. Since being fined by the club in February for an incident at a party to celebrate carnival, Wiese has been exiled from the first team and trains with a separate group. His former club Bremen have said they have no interest in re-signing Wiese, who was part of the Germany squad which finished third at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. ""A discussion about goalkeepers is not up for debate,"" said Bremen's director of sport Thomas Eichin. Having signed for Hoffenheim in May 2012 after nearly 200 Bundesliga appearances for Werder, Wiese has said there is no end in sight to his first-team exile. ""I have no interest in dissolving my contract,"" the 31-year-old said over the weekend. ""I didn't sign a four-year deal to dissolve it after just one. ""No one has spoken to me about it and I haven't had contact with the coach or manager for two months."" Wiese made a rare appearance on Saturday when he played in a benefit match for Bremen's ex-Germany midfielder Torsten Frings. Belgian goalkeeper Koen Casteels has played all four of Hoffenheim's German league games so far this season and Wiese has said he does not want to leave. ""I'm fit and ready to play,"" said the goalkeeper, who has ruled out taking legal action, like his former Hoffenheim team-mate Eren Derdiyok, who took his case to an industrial tribunal before joining Bayer Leverkusen last month."

It means Dortmund go into the international break for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers two points clear of European champions Bayern. Mkhitaryan started off by finishing a defence-splitting pass from Poland winger Jakub Blaszczykowski after ten minutes. Frankfurt equalised when Stefan Aigner's bullet-header slammed off the post and Czech striker Vaclav Kadlec rifled home the rebound on 36 minutes for his first Bundesliga goal, having joined from Sparta Prague last month. But Mkhitaryan restored Dortmund's lead with the winner when he dribbled along the edge of the area and unleashed a fearsome shot past Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp. However, the Armenian said Dortmund must improve to keep Bayern in second. ""I feel good in Dortmund and I'm happy with the goals, but I think we need to be much better,"" insisted Mkhitaryan, while Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp described the midfielder as ""a weapon in front of goal with an awesome shooting technique"". The result means Dortmund finish the weekend as the league's only team with a 100 percent record as Bayern, who drew 1-1 with Freiburg on Tuesday, Mainz and Bayer Leverkusen all dropped points. Earlier, VfB Stuttgart romped to a 6-2 Bundesliga win over Hoffenheim with striker Vedad Ibisevic netting a hat-trick after coach Bruno Labbadia was sacked last Monday. Stuttgart picked up their first points of the season after three straight defeats led to Labbadia's dismissal. Caretaker coach Thomas Schneider got off to an emphatic start as Stuttgart's Romanian striker Alexandru Maxim did the damage by scoring two goals and setting up two more, while Bosnia striker Ibisevic claimed a hat-trick. The result lifts Stuttgart out of the bottom three and into 14th and leaves Hoffenheim 11th after their first defeat of the season. On Saturday, Leverkusen blew the chance to go top with a 2-0 defeat at resurgent Schalke 04. Both Germany left-back Dennis Aogo, who has joined Schalke on loan from Hamburg, and Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, who signed a four-year deal after arriving from AC Milan on Friday, started as the Royal Blues picked up their first league win of the season. Schalke went ahead with half an hour gone when a free-kick went in off midfielder Marco Hoeger's right shoulder before Peru forward Jefferson Farfan made sure of the win when he drilled home an 83rd-minute penalty after being hauled down in the area. Mainz 05 also wasted their opportunity to go top as they crashed to a 4-1 defeat at Hanover 96. Mainz took a 12th-minute lead through striker Nicolai Mueller, but Senegal striker Mame Diouf and Poland forward Artur Sobiech put the hosts 2-1 up at the break before Ivory Coast forward Didier Ya Konan and midfielder Edgar Prib increased the lead. Elsewhere, struggling Hamburg picked up their first win of the season after two consecutive defeats with a 4-0 thumping of promoted Eintracht Braunschweig. Dutch international Rafael van der Vaart put Hamburg ahead in the seventh minute on their first attack before Cameroon striker Jacques Zoua doubled the lead on 17 minutes as the hosts counter-attacked at pace. Hamburg made sure of the three points -- and Braunschweig's fourth straight defeat to leave Eintracht bottom of the table -- when 19-year-old Turkish midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu came on for Van der Vaart on 79 minutes to claim a brace, including a stunning free-kick. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach moved up to seventh as they romped to a 4-1 home win over Werder Bremen. Wolfsburg enjoyed a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin with Ivica Olic and Diego on target, while Augsburg picked up their second straight win with a 1-0 success at Nuremberg thanks to a late goal from substitute Kevin Vogt."

Schalke will discover their Champions League opponents on Thursday when the group stage draw is made in Monaco (1745 local time) with defending champions Bayern Munich and fellow Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen also in the draw."
468,27/08/2013,22:03,Football: Bayern drop first points of season,European champions Bayern Munich dropped their first points of the Bundesliga season in a 1-1 draw at Freiburg on Tuesday ahead of their  Super Cup clash against Chelsea.,"Bayern were on course to maintain their perfect start to the season after three league wins until they leaked a late equaliser and also suffered an injury blow when midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger came off with an ankle problem. He is an injury concern for Friday's Super Cup clash against Europa League winners Chelsea in Prague as well as Germany's upcoming World Cup qualifying double-header against Austria and Faroe Islands. ""He will be examined in Munich, we hope that he will be able to play against Chelsea,"" said Bayern's media director Markus Hoerwick. Bayern still moved a point clear at the top of the table, although Mainz, Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen can all leapfrog them should they win their game in hand this weekend. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola - who has introduced a new 4-1-4-1 system since coming in to replace Jupp Heynckes - made several changes to his line-up from the one that beat Nuremberg 2-0 on Saturday. He rested six of his first-choice side, leaving out wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, who both netted at the weekend. ""If you only lead 1-0, then you are always vulnerable to concede an equaliser,"" said Guardiola. ""I don't think I risked too much with that line-up. ""I don't know if we missed one or two players, I took the decision and those on the pitch played well."" Bayern dominated the game but, not for the first time, failed to convert a string of chances despite enjoying 75 percent possession after setting a new Bundesliga record of 81 in Saturday's win over Nuremberg. ""We only have ourselves to blame,"" said captain Philipp Lahm, who was one of those rested, but came on for the second-half. ""We had enough chances to make it 2-0, but we were punished."" Bayern had got off to a promising start and showed their class when German international Thomas Mueller beat three defenders on the right and crossed to the far post where Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri drilled the ball home on 23 minutes. Freiburg started to exert some second-half pressure, however, and were rewarded with the equaliser four minutes from time. Substitute Mike Hanke switched play from the left to the right wing, where Sebastian Freis swung in a cross which midfielder Nicolas Hoefler fired past goalkeeper Manuel Neuer from close range to delight the home fans. Freiburg coach Christian Streich was delighted with his side's determination to hold the defending champions. ""When you play against Bayern Munich, you need above all an extremely high tolerance to frustration,"" he said. ""It's absolutely fantastic how we dealt with losing possession and worked hard to get it back."""

On Thursday, Loew will name his squad for the World Cup qualifiers at home against Austria and away to Faroe Islands on September 6 and 10 respectively, but is set to name Fiorentina's Mario Gomez and Lazio's Miroslav Klose as his strikers. Having clearly stated last season that he does not expect a Germany recall under Loew, Kiessling was irritated by further questions on the subject. ""At the moment, I've as much interest in the World Cup as damp cheese,"" said Kiessling, the Bundesliga's top scorer last season. ""I gave a clear statement last season and it's not my job to comment on the issue every time it comes up."" After scoring 25 goals in 34 games last season, Kiessling has already hit two in the three league games so far and netted his 100th Bundesliga goal on Saturday when he converted a 23rd-minute penalty. After his side joined Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Mainz as the four teams with a 100 percent records after three Bundesliga matches, Leverkusen coach Sami Hyypia, the ex-Liverpool and Finland defender, said he just wants to see Kiessling play well for his club. ""Mr Loew makes his decisions and it would be unfair of me to criticise a colleague,"" said the 39-year-old. ""It's just important for me that Stefan plays well and scores for us."""

Lewandowski celebrated his 101st Bundesliga appearance when he converted Marco Reus's cross from the right in the 55th minute to claim the three points. ""I had a lot of chances and we're happy that we won, but we have to improve our game, 1-0 at home is not enough,"" admitted Lewandowski, who turned 25 on Wednesday.

""In a way it was good that we didn't score earlier, because it would have taken some of the fire out of the players,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""This way, they had their feet on the gas for the whole 90 minutes.

Defending champions Bayern Munich, Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen, who host Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday, and Mainz 05, who are home to VfL Wolfsburg the same day, are the other three Bundesliga times with 100 percent records. Bremen have won both their matches under new coach Robin Dutt by with 1-0 victories away against promoted Eintracht Braunschweig and home to Augbsurg respectively having flirted with relegation last season. Bremen last lifted some silverware when they won the German Cup in 2009, but Klopp said their is too much talent in the Bremen team to take them lightly at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. ""There is a lot of attacking potential slumbering in this Bremen squad, so we have to be very careful,"" said Klopp with Bremen expected to give Argentinian striker Franco di Santo his debut after signing from Wigan Athletic a week ago. Champions League finalists Dortmund have had just four days to prepare for Bremen's visit since their 2-1 home win over promoted Braunschweig last Sunday. Borussia needed 75 minutes before rising star Jonas Hofmann broke the deadlock with a super strike before Germany's Marco Reus netted a penalty to claim the three points. Klopp expects Bremen to have a similar game plan to Braunchweig to defend hard and hit Dortmund on the break whenever possible. ""Bremen have showed they are very patient, it might be that Bremen will have similar match plan as Braunschweig,"" said the 46-year-old. Dortmund's Australian reserve goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak could be set to play with Roman Weidenfeller suffering from gastroenteritis, while Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan sits out again with a back injury he aggravated on international duty last week. Defending champions Bayern host Nuremberg on Saturday with Germany midfield star Mario Goetze set to make his league debut since joining from Borussia Dortmund for 37 million euros (US$49.5m). ""Obviously it's going to take a little longer before I recover my rhythm and really get back to 100 percent,"" said the 21-year-old Goetze who has not played since tearing his hamstring in April's Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid for Dortmund. France winger Franck Ribery is out with an ankle injury he suffered in last Saturday's 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Javi Martinez, who has yet to lose a league game for Bayern, is in contention for selection again having been left out of the match day squad at Frankfurt after a long flight back from Ecuador after playing for Spain. Hamburg travel to Hertha Berlin on Saturday looking for an improved performance after they were hammered 5-1 at home to Hoffenheim last Saturday. Coach Thorsten Fink was so furious with his team that he gave them two days off, but both midfielder Tomas Rincon and defender Dennis Aogo have been thrown out of the squad for using the time to fly to Mallorca. ""The two days off had been meant to think about what they could do better in future, not to go partying. They couldn't have made a worse decision,"" said Hamburg CEO Carl Jarchow, with the north German team having leaked eight goals in just two games.

Hofmann replaced Dortmund's other key signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, then took a crisp return pass from defender Mats Hummels to drill his shot in off the far post on 75 minutes. Hofmann was then fouled in the area five minutes from time allowing Reus to drill home the penalty for Dortmund's second before Braunschweig pulled one back when Kevin Kratz's 89th-minute corner deflected in off Borussia's Poland striker Robert Lewandowski. It was not the way Lewandowski, Dortmund's top-scorer last season with 24 goals in 31 league games, would have wanted to celebrate his 100th top-flight match, while coach Jurgen Klopp enjoyed his 100th German league win with Borussia. ""Braunschweig stuck to their defensive plan, but in the second-half we had lots of chances,"" said Klopp, as Dortmund enjoyed 66 percent possession and 17 shots on goal compared to Eintracht's four. ""Jonas Hofmann turned the game for us in the right direction, so all-in-all, I'm pleased."" After Aubameyang hit a hat-trick on his German league debut in last weekend's 4-0 rout of Augsburg, the three points leave Dortmund top of the table on goal difference with European champions Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen in joint second. Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake crashed in an 89th-minute free-kick to rescue a point in Nuremberg's 2-2 draw with Hertha Berlin. Nuremberg had taken a 40th-minute lead when striker Daniel Ginczek held off two defenders to set up Swiss striker Josip Drmic to blast his shot home. Berlin drew level when Tunisia striker Sami Allagui's shot bounced in off the chest of Nuremberg centre-back Berkay Dabanli on 61 minutes. Brazilian midfielder Ronny then netted a 79th-minute penalty for Hertha before Kiyotake's late leveller shared the points. On Saturday, defending champions Bayern laboured to a 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt while both Hamburg and Schalke 04 suffered heavy defeats which left Leverkusen in second after their 1-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic gave Bayern the three points at Frankfurt when he volleyed home a cross from Germany's Thomas Mueller on 13 minutes. It was a rare highlight in a below-par performance as Bayern failed to dominate, despite enjoying 70 percent possession, while Frankfurt captain Alex Meier had a goal ruled offside and a penalty appeal turned down in the dying stages. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, taking charge of only his second Bundesliga match, started with Dutch winger Arjen Robben, Germany star Mario Goetze and new-signing Thiago Alcantara all on the bench. Spain's Javi Martinez was left out of the squad after playing the full 90 minutes of Spain's 2-0 friendly win in Ecuador on Wednesday. Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo, who signed for Wolfsburg last week from Bayern after rejecting offers from Arsenal and Barcelona, made his debut in their 4-0 rout at home over Schalke 04. There was more bad news for Schalke on Sunday as Holland striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar was ruled out for the next four weeks after tearing medial ligaments in his right knee. Schalke will be without Huntelaar for their Champions League play-off, first-leg, at home to Greece's PAOK on Wednesday. Hamburg were humiliated 5-1 at home by Hoffenheim as Brazilian striker Roberto Firmino ran riot, scoring twice and setting up the other three.

Hofmann replaced Dortmund's other key signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang then took a crisp return pass from defender Mats Hummels to drill his shot in off the far post on 75 minutes. Hofmann was then fouled in the area five minutes from time allowing Reus to drill home the penalty for Dortmund's second before Braunschweig pulled one back when Kevin Kratz's 89th-minute corner deflected in off Borussia's Poland striker Robert Lewandowski. It was not the way Lewandowski, Dortmund's top-scorer last season with 24 goals in 31 league games, would have wanted to celebrate his 100th top flight match, while coach Jurgen Klopp enjoyed his 100th German league win with Borussia. After Aubameyang hit a hat-trick on his German league debut in last weekend's 4-0 rout of Augsburg, the three points leave Dortmund top of the table on goal difference with European champions Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen in joint second. Earlier, Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake crashed in an 89th-minute free-kick to rescue a point in Nuremberg's 2-2 draw with Hertha Berlin.

Brazilian midfielder Ronny then netted a 79th-minute penalty for Hertha before Kiyotake's late leveller shared the points. On Saturday, defending champions Bayern laboured to a 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt while both Hamburg and Schalke 04 suffered heavy defeats which left Leverkusen in second after their 1-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic gave Bayern the three points at Frankfurt when he volleyed home a cross from Germany's Thomas Mueller on 13 minutes. It was a rare highlight in a below-par performance as Bayern failed to dominate, despite enjoying 70 percent possession, while Frankfurt captain Alex Meier had a goal ruled offside and a penalty appeal turned down in the dying stages. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, taking charge of only his second Bundesliga match, started with Dutch winger Arjen Robben, Germany star Mario Goetze and new-signing Thiago Alcantara all on the bench.

Schalke will be without Huntelaar for their Champions League play-off, first-leg, at home to Greece's PAOK on Wednesday.

Guardiola pointed to the fact that he had 15 of his 26-man squad away on international duty last Wednesday with their respective nations, allowing him only limited time to prepare for the trip to Eintracht. The ex-Barcelona boss also said he was pleased to see the defending champions control the game better than they had done in their 3-1 home win over Borussia Moenchengladbach on the opening weekend of the season. ""We had much more control over the game compared to last week,"" said Guardiola, with his side level at the top of the table with Bayer Leverkusen after the first two matches. ""We allowed Gladbach far too many chances on the break, but it was much better today. ""It's never easy after an international break, because we only had three days together. ""We still created plenty of chances, so I'm happy and 100 percent satisfied."" Guardiola made just one change to the team which beat Gladbach with Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri in for Arjen Robben, while new-signing Mario Goetze was included in the match day squad for the first time, but spent the game on the bench. The result means Bayern have the maximum return of six points from their opening matches as they equalled the club record of 27 Bundesliga matches without defeat. But Eintracht captain Alexander Meier had a penalty appeal turned down in the 90th minute and Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer admitted the Bavarians rode their luck. Maier had also had a goal ruled offside early in the second half, which left Neuer admitting he had been ""hoping"" to hear the whistle at Frankfurt's 51,500 capacity crowd at the Commerzbank Arena. ""It was tight at the end, but we have only ourselves to blame,"" said the Germany goalkeeper. ""That second goal was missing from our game."""

Having cost Bayern 37 million euros (US$49.2m), Goetze is another top name coach Pep Guardiola needs to accomodate in his star-studded midfield. Goetze is an option alongside Spain Under-21 captain Thiago Alcantara in an attacking midfield role, flanked by France winger Franck Ribery and Germany's Thomas Mueller, leaving Dutchman Robben on the bench. The 29-year-old, who scored Bayern's winning goal in May's Champions League final against Dortmund, only returned to the starting line-up last season after injury to Toni Kroos, but the he said competition for places is a healthy thing in the Bayern ranks.

While Bayern kicked off the season with a 3-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach last Friday, Eintracht were hammered 6-1 at promoted Hertha Berlin. And they could be forgiven for feeling a sense of trepidation ahead of this weekend's game, given that Bayern have not lost in any of their last 19 away matches in the Bundesliga. Bayern's Spain star Javi Martinez will also be looking to maintain his remarkable Bundesliga record of having yet to lose a German league match after 25 wins and three draws. Champions League finalists Dortmund host promoted Eintracht Braunschweig on Sunday with Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan out for two weeks with a back injury he aggravated playing for his country in Wednesday's 3-3 draw with Paraguay. Dortmund got off to a flying start last weekend when Gabon forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick on his Bundesliga debut in the 4-0 win at Augsburg. And Poland striker Robert Lewandowski is set to make his 100th league appearance having scored 55 goals in Germany's top flight. Having won promotion, Braunschweig went down to a late goal at Werder Bremen last weekend. Their coach Torsten Lieberknecht and Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp were teammates at Mainz between 1995 and 2001, while Lieberknecht's last five games for Mainz came with Klopp as coach.

Mainz's Shinji Okazaki of Japan and Leverkusen's South Korea star Son Heung-Min both also scored on their respective debuts. But there was bad news for Germany coach Joachim Loew as Schalke's teenage midfielder Julian Draxler withdrew from Wednesday's international friendly against Paraguay. The 19-year-old attacking midfielder limped off after only 23 minutes against Hamburg having damaged his left Achilles tendon. ""The injury could quickly get inflamed and turn into a long drawn-out affair, so it makes no sense (for him to play on Wednesday),"" said Schalke team manager Horst Heldt. Schalke took the lead at home to Hamburg when Holland striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar struck after just 84 seconds before compatriot Rafael van der Vaart netted a 12th-minute penalty to level. Striker Maximilian Beister produced a bullet header on 24 minutes to put Hamburg in front before Huntelaar levelled right at the end of the first half. Ex-Dortmund defender Lasse Sobiech then headed the hosts ahead just after half-time before Hungary's Szalai, who joined Schalke from Mainz in the summer, pounced on a mistake by Hamburg goalkeeper Rene Adler on 72 minutes for a share of the points. Okazaki netted in Mainz 05's 3-2 home win over his ex-club VfB Stuttgart -- who he left last month. Mainz picked up three points when Germany midfielder Nicolai Mueller netted goals either side of Okazaki's 65th-minute strike. Mueller scored his first after just 14 minutes, but Bosnia striker Vedad Ibisevic levelled just two minutes later. Okazaki, who joined Mainz on July 1 in a three-year deal after two years at Stuttgart, slotted home his team's second when he converted a cross from Czech Republic defender Zdenek Pospech before Meuller made it 3-1, 12 minutes from time. Stuttgart's Martin Harnik gave his side hope with eight minutes left to make it 3-2, but Mainz hung on. Aubameyang, 24, showed why Dortmund paid French League Cup winners St Etienne 13 million euros (US$17.3m) for him as he became the sixth player in Bundesliga history to hit three goals on his debut. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski converted a penalty in the dying stages to complete Augsburg's misery. South Korea's Son also netted on his first competitive appearance for Champions League hopefuls Bayer Leverkusen in their 3-1 win at home to Freiburg. Hertha Berlin marked their return to the top-flight after a year's absence with a stunning 6-1 rout of Eintracht Frankfurt. Colombia striker Adrian Ramos and Tunisia forward Sami Allagui each scored twice in the hammering at Berlin's Olympic Stadium while a first-half penalty from Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder Alex Meier was all the guests could muster. Hanover 96 enjoyed a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg, who finished with nine men after both midfielder Maximilian Arnold and Swiss defender Timm Klose were sent off.
