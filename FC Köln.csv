0,03/02/2021,23:49,Cologne dumped out of German Cup by second-tier Jahn,"Cologne were knocked out of the German Cup by second-division side Jahn Regensburg on Wednesday after throwing away an early two-goal lead to be eliminated at the last 16 stage, 4-3 on penalties.","Bundesliga side Cologne looked to be cruising into the last eight with 21 minutes gone in the Bavarian town of Regensburg thanks to goals from Ismail Jakobs and Emmanuel Dennis. However Canadian Scott Kennedy and Jann George replied to make sure Jahn were level before the break, and there then followed another 75 minutes of attritional football before the two teams went to spot-kicks to decide the match. Again Cologne looked to have the advantage when Andreas Albers missed the home side's third penalty after five successful attempts in the shootout. However the top-flight outfit missed both their subsequent kicks, allowing Albion Vrenezi and Max Besuschkow to net theirs and snatch the tie for Jahn. In the evening's other late match Borussia Moenchengladbach came back from going behind to Silas Wamangituka's second-minute opener to win at Stuttgart 2-1 through goals from Marcus Thuram and Alassane Plea. Earlier Leipzig beat Bochum 4-0 thanks to Amadou Haidara's 10th-minute header, a penalty slammed home in first-half stoppage time by Marcel Sabitzer, who had laid on the opener with a pinpoint cross, and Yussuf Poulsen's second-half brace. Wout Weghort's 40th-minute strike, which came from the rebound of the Netherlands attacker's own missed penalty, was enough for Wolfsburg to squeeze past fellow Bundesliga outfit Schalke. Christian Gross' Schalke must now turn their attentions to what looks to be a doomed fight against relegation as they sit rock-bottom in the German top flight with just one league win all season. Wednesday's matches completed the line-up for Sunday's draw for the quarter-finals, which will be played on March 2 and 3. The four sides join Rot-Weiss Essen after the fourth-division club continued their giant-killing run on Tuesday. Essen defeated last season's runners-up Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 after extra time to reach the last eight following wins over Arminia Bielefeld and Fortuna Dusseldorf in previous rounds. Borussia Dortmund, Werder Bremen and second-tier Holstein Kiel, who stunned Bayern Munich in the previous round and squeezed past Darmstadt on penalties, also made it through on Tuesday."
1,31/01/2021,17:55,Cologne beat fellow Bundesliga strugglers Bielefeld,Cologne earned their first home league win for 11 months to climb out of the Bundesliga's relegation play-off spot on Sunday with a 3-1 win over fellow strugglers Arminia Bielefeld.,"Cologne are up to 14th after ending their miserable home run, while Bielefeld drop to 16th. On-loan Borussia Dortmund winger Marius Wolf gave Cologne an early lead with a simple tap-in, then smashed a volley just inside the post before half-time. Midfielder Elvis Rexhbecaj added a third when he was left unmarked as Bielefeld struggled to reorganise after a double substitution. Venezuela forward Sergio Cordova came off the bench to claim a consolation goal for Bielefeld with an easy finish after a mix-up in the home defence. Max Meyer, who captained Germany to the silver medal at the 2016 Olympics, came on for his Cologne debut just before the final whistle, having signed in midweek after his Crystal Palace contract was cancelled. At the other end of the table, leaders Bayern Munich maintained their seven-point lead on Saturday with a 4-1 home win against Hoffenheim. Second-placed RB Leipzig edged to a 1-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen."
2,27/01/2021,18:13,Meyer joins Cologne on free transfer,Bundesliga strugglers Cologne on Wednesday signed Max Meyer on a free transfer after the Germany midfielder fell out of favour at Crystal Palace.,"""The transfer was only possible because Max was extremely accommodating to us financially,"" said Cologne director Horst Heldt. ""He can play in several midfield positions, is very confident on the ball and likes to finish chances himself."" Meyer, 25, joined Crystal Palace from Schalke in 2018, but left the Premier League club 10 days ago by mutual consent after struggling to hold down a first team spot. He is Cologne's second signing in the current transfer window with Nigerian striker Emmanuel Dennis, 23, also joining on loan from Brugge. With half of the season gone, Cologne are in the relegation places and Meyer could play in Sunday's league game against Arminia Bielefeld, who are one place and two points above them in the table. Meyer was still a teenager in 2014 when he made the first of his four Germany appearances. After missing out on a place in the Germany squad which won the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Meyer captained the German team to the silver medal at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Meyer says he returned to Germany to help Cologne battle relegation. ""For me, the chance of playing regular football was decisive,"" said Meyer. ""I want to use the opportunity at FC (Cologne) to present myself at the top level and help the club stay in the league."""
3,20/01/2021,21:07,Schalke lose to Cologne,"Schalke remained rooted to the foot of the Bundesliga table after slipping to a 2-1 home loss to fellow strugglers Cologne on Wednesday, despite a fifth goal in three games for American teenager Matthew Hoppe.","Cologne defender Rafael Czichos gave the visitors a first-half lead, but Hoppe equalised before the hour mark. Cologne snatched a late win when Jan Thielmann fired past Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann in injury time. The win lifted Cologne out of the relegation play-off place to 15th, while Schalke remain behind second-bottom Mainz on goal difference. Hoppe became the first American to score a Bundesliga hat-trick in the 4-0 thrashing of Hoffenheim 10 days ago which ended Schalke's 30-match winless run in the league, before also netting in Sunday's 3-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt. Schalke next host league leaders Bayern Munich on Sunday having been thrashed 8-0 by the European champions at the Allianz Arena on the opening day of the season. The Royal Blues' new signing Klaas-Jan Huntelaar missed Wednesday's game with a calf strain after rejoining on Tuesday following two years with Ajax. Cologne ended a miserable five-match goalless run in the league when Czichos headed home a deflected cross with half an hour played. Cologne nearly went 2-0 up just after the break when Schalke midfielder Benjamin Stambouli clipped his own post with an attempted clearance. The hosts drew level when Hoppe pounced on a loose ball in the area, before Thielmann's late winner."
4,02/01/2021,23:20,Olmo fires RB Leipzig top of Bundesliga ahead of Bayern Munich,RB Leipzig dislodged Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table Saturday as Dani Olmo's second-half goal was enough to seal a 1-0 win at Stuttgart.,"""It was really good for me and the team to start the year with a win,"" Olmo told DAZN. With European champions Bayern at home to strugglers Mainz on Sunday, Leipzig took the chance to go a point ahead as Olmo fired through the legs of Stuttgart goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Stuttgart's Swiss shot-stopper had earlier pulled off some heroics by using his foot to save a Emil Forsberg first-half penalty attempt. Leipzig also wasted a golden chance when Amadou Haidara fired wide just after the break. With 23 minutes left, Spain midfielder Olmo finally got the breakthrough, finishing a move he started after Leipzig had moved the ball across the Stuttgart penalty area. ""It feels good to be top,"" admitted Leipzig defender Willi Orban. ""The first half was good, the second was better - we were clearly the dominant team."" Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen blew the chance to take first place after stumbling to a 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt which saw them drop to third as the league resumed after a two-week break. ""I have made my feelings clear in the dressing room,"" Leverkusen head coach Peter Bosz told Sky. ""We deserved to lose. Frankfurt had a better claim to the victory."" Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri scored with a deft back-heel flick to give the visitors the lead after only 10 minutes in Frankfurt. However, Amin Younes equalised to make it 1-1 at half-time before Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada put in a cross which Leverkusen defender Edmond Tapsoba turned into his own net. Before kickoff, Frankfurt director Fredi Bobic confirmed reports his club are interested in Bayern's teenage striker Joshua Zirkzee, 19, after selling Dutch forward Bas Dost to Brugge. Zirkzee could back up Frankfurt's top scorer Andre Silva, who has notched nine league goals this season. Union Berlin rose to fourth - into the Champions League places for the first time in the club's history - after their 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi, who has scored in his last three league games, capped another impressive display with a goal and assist. After Bremen lost the ball in their own half, the 23-year-old Nigeria international took advantage of a two-on-two situation by drawing the defence and passing to Sheraldo Becker, who fired home on 12 minutes. Awoniyi doubled Union's lead on 28 minutes by tapping the ball over the line, just out of the reach of Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka. Bremen had a penalty appeal turned down when a shot by Japan midfielder Yuya Osako clipped the hand of a Union defender, then Romano Schmid had a goal ruled offside. Hoffenheim lost both defender Kevin Akpoguma and Germany midfielder Sebastian Rudy with early leg injuries as they crashed to a 3-1 home defeat to Freiburg. With the hosts struggling to reshuffle, Freiburg were 3-0 up at half-time thanks to a Baptiste Santamaria goal, a Vincenzo Grifo penalty and an own goal by Senegal defender Kasim Adams. Hoffenheim scored a second-half consolation goal through Togo winger Ihlas Bebou. Borussia Moenchengeladbach, who host Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 next month, earned their first win in five league games with a 1-0 victory at Arminia Bielefeld. Swiss striker Breel Embolo netted the winning goal just after half-time when he held off a defender and fired home. Mid-table Augsburg rebounded after back-to-back defeats with a 1-0 win at Cologne with Brazilian winger Iago netting the late winner. Bottom side Schalke are now 30 games without a win -- one short of the Bundesliga record -- after a 3-0 defeat away to Hertha Berlin. Former Tottenham manager Christian Gross, installed as Schalke's fourth head coach this season, got off to a losing start as Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi, Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba and his replacement, Poland forward Krzysztof Piatek, scored for Hertha. Having netted two minutes after coming off the bench, Piatek had a second late goal ruled offside."
5,28/11/2020,17:41,Lewandowski hits 15th goal of season as Bayern Munich stay top,Robert Lewandowski claimed his 15th goal this season in all competitions as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich came from behind to claim a 3-1 win at Stuttgart on Saturday.,"After 19-year-old striker Tanguy Coulibaly gave Stuttgart a shock early lead, Kingsley Coman equalised before Lewandowski drilled home from 20 metres to put Bayern 2-1 up at the break. Brazil winger Douglas Costa, a second-half replacement for Coman, grabbed Bayern's third goal late on to seal the win which leaves the holders two points clear of RB Leipzig. Dortmund are third, four points behind Bayern, after crashing to a shock 2-1 defeat at home to Cologne, as Leipzig climbed above them thanks to a 2-1 home win over Arminia Bielefeld. Cologne avoided a club record 19th match without a win with their first victory in Dortmund since 1991."
6,31/10/2020,17:38,Bayern Munich sweep past Cologne to go top without Lewandowski,European champions Bayern Munich went top of the Bundesliga on Saturday as Thomas Mueller and Serge Gnabry provided the goals with Robert Lewandowski rested for their 2-1 win at Cologne.,"Bayern coach Hansi Flick opted to leave out Lewandowski, who scored a record 10 goals in the opening five league games, ahead of their midweek Champions League match at Salzburg and a Bundesliga showdown at Dortmund next Saturday. However, RB Leipzig, who are now two points behind in third, can go back to the top of the table if they beat Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday evening. Mueller netted an early penalty and Gnabry finished a counter-attack on the stroke of half-time to leave Bayern 2-0 up at the break. Cologne improved in the second-half and replacement midfielder Dominick Drexler pulled back a late goal. Borussia Dortmund climbed to second in the table without star striker Erling Braut Haaland as defender Mats Hummels scored both goals in a 2-0 win at Arminia Bielefeld."
7,03/10/2020,17:58,Haaland nets twice as Dortmund run riot,Erling Braut Haaland again demonstrated his deadly finishing by netting twice on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund climbed to second in the Bundesliga table with a 4-0 demolition of Freiburg.,"Dortmund bounced back from last weekend's shock defeat at Augsburg as Haaland shone to leave him on 21 goals in 23 games for Dortmund since his January transfer as the burly Norwegian claimed clinically-taken goals. Having also scored in Wednesday's German Super Cup 3-2 defeat at Bayern Munich, the 20-year-old Haaland has netted five goals in as many games this season. Dortmund were missing England winger Jadon Sancho and goalkeeper Roman Buerki, both recovering from illness having tested negative for the coronavirus. Club captain Marco Reus made his first start for eight months after a groin injury. US teenager Giovanni Reyna, who assisted all three goals, was outstanding alongside Reus in the attacking midfield role for Dortmund. The 17-year-old played Haaland into space for the burly Norwegian to score both his goals, then delivered a pin-point corner for Emre Can's headed goal. Haaland, 19, once again showed dazzling finishing when he fired home from a right angle on 31 minutes. Can then rose highest from a corner and his bullet header put Dortmund 2-0 up two minutes after the break. Reyna and Haaland combined again when they got in behind the defence as the American delayed his pass which the Norwegian hammered into the net on 66 minutes. Winger Felix Passlack claimed his first Bundesliga goal in added time to complete the rout with Haaland providing the final pass. Defending champions Bayern Munich host Hertha Berlin on Sunday out to bounce back from last weekend's shock defeat at Hoffenheim to end their 23-match winning streak. Eintracht Frankfurt top the league table after their 2-1 win over previous leaders Hoffeheim. Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric netted his eighth goal in four games with a superb strike, curled inside the far corner, to give Hoffenheim the lead on 18 minutes. However, Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada turned the game when he tapped home on 54 minutes, then powered through the defence before Bas Dost stabbed the ball over the line on 19 minutes from time. It could have been 3-1 as Frankfurt had a late goal disallowed. Champions League side Moenchenegladbach romped to a 3-1 win at Cologne as Alassane Plea and Stefan Lainer fired home before Lars Stindl added a penalty on 56 minutes. Cologne scored a consolation goal when Elvis Rexhbecaj beat Gladbach keeper Yann Sommer from 20 metres out. Bremen earned a second win in three games when Leonardo Bittencourt's right-footed shot on 27 minutes sealed their 1-0 win at home to new boys Arminia Bielefeld. The hosts survived a late scare as Bielefeld had a goal disallowed just before the whistle. Leverkusen were held to a 1-1 draw at Stuttgart as Patrik Schick's early goal was cancelled out by an equaliser by the hosts' striker Sasa Kalajdzic. On Friday, Union Berlin enjoyed their first win of the season with a 4-0 thumping of Mainz at home as Germany striker Max Kruse scored his first goal for the hosts."
8,19/09/2020,21:15,Haaland and Reyna shine as Dortmund youngsters down Gladbach,Erling Braut Haaland scored twice and 17-year-old Giovanni Reyna shone as youthful Borussia Dortmund swept aside fellow Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-0 on Saturday on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga season.,"After holders Bayern Munich had kicked off the 2020/21 campaign on Friday with a record 8-0 thrashing of Schalke, Dortmund's youngsters also dazzled at home to Gladbach. ""It was a really good start to the season. We have a lot of young guys, it's fun to play with guys near my age,"" said USA Under-17 international Reyna. ""This is an exciting group and we have to keep working."" Haaland converted a second-half penalty, then again showcased his clinical eye for goal by finishing a superb counter as Dortmund attacked from their own goal. Coach Lucien Favre banked on youth by starting two 17-year-olds in Reyna and England Under-21 midfielder Jude Bellingham, who made his league debut, with Sancho and Haaland, both 20, leading Dortmund's attack. Reyna, making just his third league start, paid back the faith by scoring the opening goal and winning the penalty Haaland converted. Reyna drilled home Bellingham's superb pass from a tight ankle on 34 minutes, then had his ankle clipped after a darting run into the area to win the penalty for Haaland. Sancho tried to convince Haaland to let him take the spot-kick, but ""I was confident whoever took it, would score, which is the most important thing"" said Reyna. Haaland then stole the show with a stunning end-to-end sprint to support Sancho's break before crashing home Dortmund's third goal on 78 minutes. The towering Norwegian, the first player in Bundesliga history to score a hat-trick from the bench, now has 18 goals in 20 games for Dortmund since his arrival in January. For the first time since March, some German league clubs were able to welcome back limited numbers of fans, depending on permission from local health authorities. The biggest crowd of the day was in Dortmund, as 9,300 cheered the impressive home win. ""It's amazing to have fans back, they support us so much,"" added Reyna. Having finished runners-up to Bayern for the last two seasons, Dortmund are on a collision course with the European champions who they meet in the German Super Cup showdown on September 30 in Munich. Earlier, Hertha Berlin's new-signing Jhon Cordoba scored on his debut in a 4-1 away romp at Werder Bremen as the ambitious capital city club also threw down an early marker. In front of 8,500 in Bremen, Hertha defender Peter Pekarik and Belgian-born winger Dodi Lukebakio scored quick-fire goals at the end of the first half to leave Werder 2-0 down at the break and the hosts were whistled off the pitch by their own fans. Colombia striker Cordoba, signed from Cologne in mid-week, came on to start the move which Brazil Under-23 forward Matheus Cunha finished as Hertha went 3-0 up with an hour gone. Davie Selke scored Bremen's second-half consolation goal before Cordoba capped his debut by tucking home Hertha's fourth goal on 90 minutes. Just like Bayern, Cologne also had to play behind closed doors due to a rising rate of infection for their 3-2 home defeat to Hoffenheim, for whom Andrej Kramaric scored a hat-trick. The Croatia striker put the visitors ahead after three minutes following a mix up in defence, netted a penalty and smashed home the winning goal in added time after Cologne had launched a late fight back. In the capital, playmaker Michael Gregoritsch and winger Andre Hahn scored late goals as Augsburg beat hosts Union Berlin 3-1 in front of 4,600 fans. Newly-promoted Arminia Bielefeld earned a point with a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on their return to the top flight in front of 6,500. Stuttgart, who also came up, gave Freiburg a scare with late goals by Sasa Kalajdzic and Silas Wamangituka as they fought back in a 3-2 defeat in front of 8,000."
9,27/06/2020,18:01,"Bremen snatch play-off survival chance, champions Bayern rout Wolfsburg","Werder Bremen gave themselves hope of avoiding relegation from the German Bundesliga by thrashing Cologne 6-1 to grab a play-off place on the last day of the season, while champions Bayern Munich routed Wolfsburg before lifting the trophy on Saturday.","Japan striker Yuya Osako scored twice as Bremen stole the lifeline of the relegation/promotion play-off place from Fortuna Duesseldorf, who lost 3-0 at Union Berlin and were relegated with Paderborn, finishing one point behind Bremen. Florian Kohfeldt's Werder will face second-tier opponents in either Heidenheim or possibly neighbours, rivals and fellow fallen giants Hamburg in the play-off first leg on Thursday. Bremen have spent more seasons than any other team in the Bundesliga, having only spent one term in the second tier, in 1980-81. A burst of goals from Osako, Milot Rashica and Niclas Fuellkrug -- all in the space of eight minutes -- had Werder 3-0 up at the break against Cologne at the Weserstadion. Former Everton midfielder Davy Klaassen then fired home a rebound just after the break before Osako, facing his old side, added his second and USA international Josh Sargent completed the rout. Dominick Drexler pulled a goal back for Cologne. Werder, the four-time Bundesliga champions, also needed a favour from Berlin and got one as Union beat Fortuna 3-0 with goals from Nigerian duo Anthony Ujah and Suleiman Abdullahi either side of veteran midfielder Christian Gentner's effort. Bremen will find out their play-off opponents on Sunday, with Heidenheim currently in the play-off place ahead of the final round of matches in the second division. At Wolfsburg, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski scored a penalty for his 34th league goal of the season, finishing as the top scorer for the fifth time. Kingsley Coman, Michael Cuisance and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet as Bayern, champions for the eighth straight season, finished 13 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Mueller set up Coman for Bayern's opening goal to finish the campaign with a league record 21 assists, and his goal that rounded out the win was also Bayern's 100th league goal this season -- one short of the Bundesliga record. Wolfsburg captain Josuha Guilavogui was sent off for a second yellow card after fouling Cuisance, leading to Lewandowski's penalty. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach and RB Leipzig secured qualification for next season's Champions League after 2-1 wins over Hertha Berlin and Augsburg respectively, as fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen missed out by two points despite beating Mainz 1-0. Dortmund, who had already wrapped up second place, crashed to a 4-0 home defeat by Hoffenheim, for whom Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric scored all four goals, including one penalty. That result allowed Hoffenheim to leapfrog Wolfsburg and take sixth place, although both sides will go into the Europa League next season along with Leverkusen. Before kick-off in Dortmund, Mario Goetze, whose winning goal sealed Germany's victory in the 2014 World Cup final, was given a send-off by the club. He will leave this summer with his contract having expired, but the 28-year-old attacking midfielder has not announced his future club. Elsewhere, Timo Werner signed off with a brace in RB Leipzig's 2-1 win at Augsburg in what was his final appearance for the club before moving to Chelsea. Schalke's disastrous second half of the season was completed with a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Freiburg as they finished the season 12th, having been third in December. Eintracht Frankfurt beat bottom side Paderborn 3-2 in Saturday's other game."
10,01/06/2020,22:46,Werner strikes as potent Leipzig win in Cologne to return to third,RB Leipzig returned to third place in the Bundesliga with an entertaining 4-2 victory at Cologne on Monday.,"Jhon Cordoba claimed the early advantage for the home side but Leipzig scored four in 37 minutes, including Timo Werner's 31st in all competitions, to climb back above Borussia Moenchendgladbach and Bayer Leverkusen in the hunt for a Champions League place. The hosts' boss Markus Gisdol made four changes from Wednesday's loss at Hoffenheim, starting Rafael Czichos in place of suspended Sebastian Bournaauw, red carded in the defeat. Leipzig's Julian Nagelsmann switched both his wing-backs from Wednesday's draw to Hertha Berlin as Angelino, on loan from Manchester City, and French youth international Nordi Mukiele started. The home side took an early lead as Cordoba poached for his 10th home goal of the campaign. Midfielder Elvis Rexhbecaj's effort deflected onto the far post and the Colombian finished from the rebound after seven minutes. The sides were level 13 minutes later as Schick headed home Angelino's cross. Things went from bad to worse for Gisdol's men four minutes later as Cordoba was forced off with an injury and replaced by Anthony Modeste. Leipzig's took the lead eight minutes from the break as Christopher Nkunku claimed his first goal since January. Austria midfielder Konrad Laimer played a clever ball into the box and former Paris Saint-Germain attacker Nkunku dinked his finish over the onrushing Timo Horn. Leipzig went further ahead three minutes into the second-half as Werner, who has been linked with a move to Premier League leaders Liverpool, raced clear in a rapid counter-attack and beat Horn with a side-footed finish. Cologne hit back four minutes later as Leipzig failed to clear outside their area and Modeste curled home a shot. Leipzig's two-goal lead was re-established less than two minutes later as Spain midfielder Dani Olmo scored his first goal since joining Leipzig in January with a curling shot of hos own from the edge of the box. Substitute Modeste seemed to have won the chance to reduce the advantage with 18 minutes left but was denied a penalty by VAR after Lucas Klostermann's tackle. Two minutes Modeste then wasted a one-on-one with Peter Gulasci and Nagelsmann's Leipzig held on for three points."
11,17/05/2020,17:57,Mainz fight back for point at Cologne on Bundesliga return,"Cologne surrendered a two-goal lead Sunday, with players' calls echoing around the stadium, as strugglers Mainz fought back to earn a 2-2 draw in the Bundesliga.","On Saturday, the Bundesliga became the first top European league to return amid the coronavirus pandemic with second-placed Borussia Dortmund hammering Schalke 4-0 in the Ruhr derby. Later Sunday, reigning champions Bayern Munich, who hold a one-point lead in their bid to win an eighth straight league title, are at mid-table Union Berlin. In Cologne, the hosts took an early lead when Mark Uth, on loan from Schalke, converted a penalty with just six minutes gone after the striker was brought down in the area. With hugs and handshakes banned, the players celebrated with elbow bumps instead. Cologne added a second goal when Florian Kainz headed home a cross with just over half an hour left. However, Mainz came roaring back with an hour played when replacement striker Taiwo Awoniyi, who had only been on for five minutes, tapped home from close range for his first Bundesliga goal. Cameroon midfielder Pierre Kunde then earned a point for Mainz when he beat two defenders and poked the ball past Cologne goalkeeper Timo Horn to equalise on 72 minutes. The result leaves Mainz on the verge of the relegation places but four points above the bottom three while Cologne are tenth."
12,07/05/2020,14:22,Bundesliga moves restart from May 15 to following day,"The German league announced Thursday it has pushed back the planned restart of the Bundesliga from Friday, May 15, until the following day.","German Chancellor Angela Merkel has granted permission for the Bundesliga to resume behind closed doors with strict hygiene measures, plus regular testing of players and backroom staff. Christian Seifert, CEO of the German Football League (DFL), confirmed on Thursday that matches will resume on Saturday, May 16. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund host arch rivals Schalke in the Ruhr derby in the pick of the matches on the first day back. Defending champions Bayern Munich, who sit four points clear of Dortmund, will travel to face Union Berlin on the Sunday.

13,04/05/2020,13:19,Cologne squad tests negative for coronavirus after three positive cases,The Bundesliga's hopes of a restart were lifted on Monday when tests on the Cologne squad revealed no further cases of coronavirus.,"The German league's plans to restart this month hit a road bump on Friday when it emerged that three people at Cologne -- midfielder Niklas Hauptmann and defender Ismail Jakobs, and a club physio -- had tested positive. The trio remain in quarantine and a second round of tests on Sunday on the other squad members and staff were all negative, the club said Monday. The German Football League (DFL) plans to resume from May 16 behind closed doors, providing it gets permission from Angela Merkel's government. A decision is expected on Wednesday. On Sunday, Horst Seehofer, Germany's minister for sport and the interior, said he supported a resumption of the Bundesliga, despite the positive tests in Cologne. Part of the restart plan is that players are tested every few days and are only be allowed to play after returning two negatives. The 18 clubs in Germany's top flight started testing their players and staff last week. On Monday, defending champions Bayern Munich, who were four points clear when the Bundesliga was halted on March 13, announced that all those tested had negative results. Since early April, Germany's top clubs have been training mainly in small groups in anticipation of the league resuming. Germany had reported 163,175 cases of COVID-19 as of Monday, but its death toll of 6,692 remains much lower than in Spain, France, the UK and Italy, home to Europe's other top football leagues. A return in May would make the Bundesliga the first top league in Europe to resume as Germany cautiously eases lockdown measures. Germany's top clubs are desperate for the season to be completed by June 30 in order to claim an instalment of television money worth 300 million euros ($325 million)."
14,01/05/2020,22:02,Bundesliga restart blow as three test positive for coronavirus at Cologne,"Three people have tested positive for coronavirus at Cologne and will be placed into a 14-day quarantine, the Bundesliga club said Friday in a potential blow to hopes of restarting the German football season this month.","""Cologne had the entire team and coaching staff, along with the backroom staff, tested on Thursday for COVID-19. Three people tested positive, all are symptom free,"" the club said in a statement on its website. ""After an assessment of the cases by the responsible health authorities, the three people who tested positive will go into a 14-day quarantine at home. ""Cologne will not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of those affected."" The club said it would continue to train in preparation for the campaign to resume, with further tests to be carried out as part of the league's health and safety protocol. ""We now see in everyday life that our concept recognises and reduces risks at an early stage,"" said Tim Meyer, head of the German league's medical task force. ""We are convinced that with our concept, we can enable players to practice their profession with the best possible protection against infection."" The Bundesliga had set a target return date of May 9 but still needs permission from the German government. A delay on the decision this week meant a resumption would not be possible before May 16. A final decision is expected next Wednesday. The German league confirmed Thursday that clubs had started testing players for the virus as part of plans to get the season up and running again. It has been suspended since March 13. Clubs returned to training at the start of April while adhering to social distancing guidelines and games would be played behind closed doors, with large-scale public events banned in Germany until August 31. Borussia Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke warned last weekend that ""the entire Bundesliga will go down"" unless the league restarts. Germany's top clubs are desperate for the season to be completed by June 30 in order to claim an instalment of television money worth 300 million euros ($325 million). A return in May would make the Bundesliga the first top league in Europe to resume as Germany cautiously eases lockdown measures. Nevertheless, there is heated debate about whether the Bundesliga should resume amid the pandemic which has so far claimed the lives of more than 6,000 people in Germany. Paris Saint-Germain were declared Ligue 1 champions on Thursday after French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced sport could not resume in France before September."
15,11/03/2020,20:39,Gladbach beat Cologne behind closed doors,"Borussia Moenchengladbach beat Cologne 2-1 on Wednesday to move back into the Bundesliga top four in the first game in German top-flight history to be played behind closed doors, due to the coronavirus pandemic.","Marco Rose's Gladbach sit six points behind leaders Bayern Munich and two points clear of fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen in the race for Champions League qualification. Last weekend, German health minister Jens Spahn requested that all events in the country with more than 1,000 people be cancelled ""until further notice"". The home side, who led the table earlier in the season, took a 32nd-minute lead through Breel Embolo in the near-empty Borussia Park. An own goal from visiting defender Jorge Mere doubled the advantage 20 minutes from time, and despite a late strike from Cologne forward Mark Uth, Gladbach held on to bounce back from last Friday's 2-1 loss to second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Their win was greeted by fireworks set off by around 500 fans gathered outside the stadium. ""It (the support) gives us goosebumps. We know why we play football,"" Gladbach midfielder Christoph Kramer, a 2014 World Cup winner, told Sky. ""I think it's great that so many people are gathering in the rain behind the grandstand. We're happy to have such fans."" Even referee Deniz Aytekin admitted it was a strange situation. ""Something was missing,"" he said. ""It (the virus) is scary. It has nothing to do with football. It was difficult to concentrate."" Gladbach, who still hold an outside chance of winning a first league title since 1977, last played in the Champions League in 2016, exiting at the group stage. The Rhine derby against Cologne was originally postponed last month due to Storm Ciara. Moenchengladbach's home ground is in North Rhine-Westphalia state, where 484 of Germany's 1,296 registered coronavirus infections have been reported. All Bundesliga games this weekend will also be played behind closed doors. Professional games in Germany had previously been played without spectators for disciplinary reasons, but only in the lower divisions."
16,14/02/2020,18:03,"Coman, Hernandez could start for Bayern with Chelsea looming",Bayern Munich stars Kingsley Coman and Lucas Hernandez could start at Cologne on Sunday in the Bundesliga as they work their way back to full fitness in preparation for the Champions League clash with Chelsea.,"Coman and Hernandez came off the bench in the second half of last Sunday's goalless draw at home to Leipzig for their first appearances after long-term injuries. Head coach Hansi Flick says the pair could start for the German league leaders at strugglers Cologne, who are six points above the relegation places. Flick is eager to build up the French pair's fitness before facing Chelsea in the Champions League last 16, first leg at Stamford Bridge on February 25, with the return in Munich on March 18. ""We're glad that it was (relatively) quick for both of them,"" Flick said Friday, with winger Coman back after twisting his knee in the Champions League win over Tottenham last December. Centre-back Hernandez, the most expensive player in Bayern's history after costing 80 million euros ($87 million) from Atletico Madrid last year, was out for four months with an ankle injury. ""Both are doing well in training, but we don't yet know whether they will last 90 minutes. ""What's clear is that they need more practice. Whether they come on or play from the beginning is open."" Flick said he hopes that by the time Bayern first face Chelsea, both ""should be at 100 percent"". Bayern start the weekend a point clear of nearest rivals Leipzig, who host relegation-threatened Werder Bremen on Saturday. Flick says Bayern captain Manuel Neuer, who missed training in midweek with a stomach virus, will face Cologne. Winger Alphonso Davies and midfielder Joshua Kimmich also took part in training after carrying knocks."
17,26/01/2019,11:54,FIFA rules Modeste had no right to quit Tianjin for Cologne,FIFA has thrown Anthony Modeste's transfer to Cologne in doubt by declaring his decision to walk out on Chinese side Tianjin Quanjian was not justified by unpaid salary.,"The 30-year-old French striker walked out on the Chinese club last year, citing a lack of pay, and signed a new contract until 2023 with ex-club Cologne, for whom he scored 25 goals in 34 league games in 2016/17. Tianjin Quanjian, or Tianjin Tianhai as they has since been renamed, face an uncertain future and reportedly need to sell players to survive due to excessive spending. After two seasons in China, Modeste quit the Chinese Super League in mid-2018 and, after training with Cologne in the winter break, was due to make his first appearance in the second Bundesliga on Thursday at Union Berlin. However, FIFA has ruled Modeste's switch is invalid after the matter was brought before their Dispute Resolution Chamber. The chamber ""rules that Tianjin Quanjian FC is required to pay the outstanding compensation to the player, but it has been determined that they (Modeste) terminated their employment with Tianjin Quanjian FC without good reason,"" said FIFA in a statement. Cologne currently sit second in the second Bundesliga and are chasing promotion back to the top flight. On Friday, Cologne announced FIFA had suspended their registration for Modeste."
18,04/05/2018,02:10,Hamburg adopt knock-out mentality for survival fight,"Midfielder Lewis Holtby says Hamburg must treat Saturday's match at Eintracht Frankfurt as ""a cup semi-final"" if they want to avoid a historic first relegation from the Bundesliga.","Second-bottom Hamburg are five points from safety with two league games left -- at Eintracht Frankfurt and then at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach -- as they bid to avoid slipping out of the top flight for the first time. But they sit just two points behind Wolfsburg, who occupy 16th place, which provides the solace of a relegation play-off against the team who finish third in the second tier. Holtby says, from a Hamburg perspective, those remaining games against clubs fighting for European places next season are effectively knock-out matches. ""This is our 'semi-final',"" said Holtby, who has scored four goals in Hamburg's last five games to breathe life into their survival hopes. ""We aren't dead yet. I believe 100 percent that we can rescue things."" Hamburg are the only club to have played in every season since the Bundesliga was established in 1963 -- when even mighty Bayern Munich were still a second-division club. A seven-point gap at the start of April has been slashed by wins over fellow strugglers Freiburg, 1-0 at home a fortnight ago, and Wolfsburg, 3-1 away last Saturday. Three wins in their last four games have given belief to Hamburg's players and fans alike, but they need Wolfsburg to drop more points. Moreover, they are facing a Frankfurt side eager to bounce back from a 4-1 mauling at champions Bayern Munich, which followed a 3-0 home defeat by Hertha Berlin. ""We have not achieved anything yet, if we want to get over the line, then we need further victories,"" said Christian Titz, Hamburg's third coach since January. Hamburg have fallen on hard times in recent seasons, needing to win the relegation play-off in both 2013/14 and 2014/15 to stay up. This season has been a disaster. Hamburg were second from bottom with 15 points from 19 games when Markus Gisdol was sacked as head coach in late January. Former player Bernd Hollerbach took over, but was soon dismissed after failing to win any of his seven games, admitting ""we need a miracle"". Titz was promoted from the reserves and the 47-year-old has coaxed three wins from his six games to turn the corner. ""We are playing a totally different style of football, the coach has his own ideas and sticks to them,"" enthused midfielder Aaron Hunt. Hamburg need Wolfsburg to slip up either this Saturday at RB Leipzig, who are winless in their last five games and fighting to keep a Europa League place, or at home to Cologne, who are already relegated. Having already had their relegation confirmed last weekend, bottom side Cologne host champions Bayern Munich, who are licking their wounds after their agonising Champions League exit in midweek. Bayern, who sealed a sixth straight league title last month, hold a massive 24-point lead in the table. Coach Jupp Heynckes is sure to rotate after they drew 2-2 at Real Madrid on Wednesday to lose their Champions League semi-final 4-3 on aggregate. Saturday's fixtures (all 1330 GMT) Borussia Dortmund v Mainz, RB Leipzig v Wolfsburg, Cologne v Bayern Munich, Werder Bremen v Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Moenchengladbach v Freiburg, Eintracht Frankfurt v Hamburg, Augsburg v Schalke, Hanover 96 v Hertha Berlin, Stuttgart v Hoffenheim"

""It would have been easy to move to another club after this season, but that did not feel right to me,"" said the 27-year-old. ""FC Cologne allowed me to go from the regional leagues to the national team."" With three games left, Cologne are eight points from safety and have only a mathematical chance of staying up. Anything other than a win at Freiburg on Saturday will send them down after three years back in the Bundesliga. Nevertheless, Hector has committed his future and signed a two-year extension to stay at Cologne until 2023. Having joined in 2010 and played in 187 games for the club, Hector is staying loyal. He has made 36 international appearances, scoring three goals, having broken into the Germany team after the 2014 World Cup. He had widely been expected to leave Cologne once their relegation is confirmed due a release clause in his contract. ""Jonas is an extraordinary player and an extraordinary person, the like of which is rare in football today,"" said Cologne's director of football Armin Veh. ""His commitment to Cologne is a great signal for the team, the club and our fans."" Hector would not be setting a precedent if he plays for Cologne in the second division. Lukas Podolski was also a Germany international while at Cologne when they were relegated in 2004/05."
20,22/04/2018,20:51,Risse scores 'saddest' goal as Cologne face drop,"Marcel Risse gave bottom-side Cologne faint hope of avoiding relegation from the Bundesliga with the ""saddest"" equaliser of his career in Sunday's 2-2 draw at home to Schalke.","The dead-ball expert punched the air after his speculative free-kick beat Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann on 84 minutes. Risse's equaliser cancelled out Schalke's early goals by Yevhen Konoplyanka and Breel Embolo before Leon Bittencourt pulled one back. ""That's one of the saddest goals I have scored in my career,"" Risse, 28, said. ""It's a very emotional mood, because week after week, it's becoming clearer that relegation is approaching."" With just three games left, and Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich still to come, Cologne remain eight points from safety with only a mathematical chance of surviving after three seasons back in Germany's top flight. Several Cologne players shed tears after the final whistle. The point rewarded the hosts for coming back from 2-0 down against second-placed Schalke, whose coach Domenico Tedesco slammed their performance. ""Our style was good in the first half, but you cannot play more arrogantly or handle the chances we had with more negligence,"" he fumed after Schalke wasted several opportunities. In pouring rain, Schalke raced into a 2-0 lead in the opening 24 minutes with Konoplyanka causing havoc. The Ukrainian cut inside from the left wing and squared for Embolo to fire into an empty net on four minutes. Cologne battled away, but Schalke scored again. Konoplyanka again cut in from the left, beat a defender and curled his shot past Cologne's goalkeeper Timo Horn for a stunning goal. Cologne pulled one back two minutes later. Germany defender Jonas Hector played midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt into the Schalke box to smash his shot home. With time running out, Risse's free-kick beat Faehrmann from 30 metres for the equaliser. Earlier, Iceland international Alfred Finnbogason set up one goal and scored another as Augsburg ran out 2-0 winners over beat relegation-threatened Mainz. Michael Gregoritsch got the opener before Finnbogason sealed the win that ended any doubt Augsburg would remain in the top flight for next season. They are in the security of mid-table, while Mainz remain level on points with Freiburg, who occupy the relegation play-off berth with three games remaining. Hamburg and Cologne sit in the bottom two and look set to drop down automatically into the second tier. Finnbogason was part of the Iceland side that reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2016 and is set to be part of his country's squad at the World Cup in Russia. He produced a superb piece of skill to set up the first-half opener for the unmarked Gregoritsch to tap-in. Just before the final whistle, the burly Icelandic striker fired home his 12th Bundesliga goal of the season. He then earned himself a yellow card as he ripped off his shirt in celebration."
21,17/04/2018,16:48,Rock-bottom Cologne seek fresh start with Anfang,Rock-bottom Bundesliga side Cologne named Markus Anfang as head coach on Tuesday as they prepare for life in Germany's second division.,"Cologne, nine points from safety with four games left, signed the 43-year-old Anfang on a three-year deal as he continues his fight to steer second division side Holstein Kiel into the top flight. ""Markus Anfang is a coach who can make his mark on a team, as he has already proven at Kiel,"" said Cologne CEO Armin Veh. The appointment comes a week after Cologne coach Stefan Ruthenbeck, 45, was told his contract, which expires in June, will not be renewed. German football magazine Kicker claim Cologne paid Kiel less than a million euros to sign their coach. Anfang meanwhile is unfazed by the prospect of leaving a team on the verge of promotion for one almost sure to go down. Third-placed Kiel are just four points behind leaders Fortuna Duesseldorf in the second division. ""I'm from Cologne,"" said Anfang, a former Schalke midfielder. ""Nobody has to tell me what it means to work with this exceptional club and these fans. ""Which league it is does not matter. ""I am thankful to Holstein Kiel for a wonderful time and for allowing me this chance."""
22,31/03/2018,21:18,Bayern crush Dortmund but title party put on hold,"Hat-trick hero Robert Lewandowski put former club Borussia Dortmund to the sword as Bayern Munich rampaged to a 6-0 win on Saturday, but the Bavarians have to wait at least another week to celebrate a sixth successive Bundesliga title.","Lewandowski was lucky not to be ruled offside when he gave Bayern the lead after just five minutes. Franck Ribery was less fortunate a few minutes later, as his goal was correctly ruled out by VAR. Luck had little to do with it, however, as Bayern completely outclassed Dortmund in the first half, strikes from James Rodriguez and Thomas Muller giving them a 3-0 lead before the half-hour mark. In the dying minutes of the half, Ribery twinkle-toed his way through the defence to set up Lewandowski's second, before getting on the scoresheet himself with Bayern's fifth, lofting the ball elegantly over goalkeeper Roman Burki. ""We were totally absent today,"" said Dortmund defender Marcel Schmelzer. ""Bayern just played cat and mouse with us. It was a disgrace, and it can't go on like this."" After a quiet second half, Lewandowski completed his hat-trick three minutes from time, turning in Joshua Kimmich's cross from close range. ""I've been on the end of a 5-1 defeat here before, so I know how much it hurts,"" said Bayern and former Dortmund defender Mats Hummels. Bayern's title celebrations remain on hold after Schalke eased to a 2-0 victory over Freiburg earlier in the day. Daniel Caligiuri put Schalke ahead from the penalty spot on 63 minutes, before Freiburg striker Nils Petersen saw a second yellow card for dissent. With both their striker and their coach Christian Streich sent off, Freiburg capitulated, and Guido Burgstaller secured victory 17 minutes from time. RB Leipzig survived a late scare in Hanover, battling to a 3-2 victory to break back into the top four. Leipzig drew first blood on 16 minutes, as Timo Werner broke down the right flank to provide Emil Forsberg with the easiest of tap-ins. Willi Orban doubled the lead early in the second half, sending a powerful header past Philipp Tschauner. Salif Sane quickly pulled one back for Hanover, before Yussuf Poulsen appeared to secure victory for Leipzig in the 76th minute. Niclas Fuellkrug fired Hanover back into the game with a flying header, and appeared to complete a dramatic comeback when he found the net again minutes later, only to see his equaliser disallowed for offside through VAR. ""The three points are hugely important for us and we are happy that we got the reward for our hard work,"" said Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""But we need to regain stability at the back."" Leipzig leapfrog Bayer Leverkusen into fourth, as the latter were held to a turgid 0-0 draw by Augsburg. At the other end of the table, Hamburg dropped more points as they drew 1-1 in Stuttgart. Lewis Holtby scored his first league goal since August to fire Hamburg into the lead on 18 minutes, but Daniel Ginczek equalised against the run of play for Stuttgart just before half-time. Hamburg remain bottom, a point behind fellow strugglers Cologne, who were subjected to a 6-0 thrashing at Hoffenheim. Serge Gnabry scored two brilliant goals to kick-start the rout. Having danced around several defenders to fire in a net-busting opener in the first half, Gnabry grabbed a second just after half-time, picking out the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Cologne-born forward Mark Uth grabbed a brace, as he and Lukas Rupp scored three goals in the space of 10 minutes. Uth then set up Steven Zuber to prod home Hoffenheim's sixth."

""We are still down there in the relegation fight,"" Bremen's Florian Kainz told Eurosport. ""We can't let up at this point. Today was a step in the right direction, but nothing more."" As in previous weeks, supporters protested the introduction of Monday night games, with fan groups on both sides taking part in a stadium boycott. Bremen looked the more threatening side in the first half, as Rashica in particular caused trouble for Cologne. When he forced a corner just after the half-hour mark, Bremen struck. Zlatko Junuzovic's looping ball found Milos Veljkovic at the far post, and the defender side-footed in the opener. Cologne came out fighting after the interval, and grabbed a deserved equaliser through Yuya Osako in the 53rd minute. Former Bremen star Claudio Pizarro set up the Japanese, who fired the ball into the top corner. Rashica restored Bremen's lead just five minutes later, though, latching onto a fine through ball from Kainz and prodding the ball past goalkeeper Timo Horn. The 39-year-old Pizarro missed a golden opportunity to equalise 15 minutes from time, heading the ball inches wide. Still a fan favourite in Bremen, the home fans sang the Peruvian's name in the dying minutes of the game. ""It is always special for me to play here,"" Pizarro told Eurosport. ""I love the Bremen fans and they love me."" In the 90th minute, Maximilian Eggestein broke away on the left to fire in Bremen's third and secure victory. Defeat moves Cologne another step closer to relegation, as they remain eight points adrift of safety."
24,09/03/2018,01:50,Bayern prepare for life after Heynckes,"Bayern Munich look to continue their dominance of the Bundesliga with victory over Hamburg this weekend, as they begin to prepare for life after Jupp Heynckes.","The veteran coach, who has led to Bayern to what will almost certainly be a sixth consecutive league title this season, appeared to confirm this week that he will not sign a new deal in the summer. Bayern are 20 points clear at the top of the table and will hope to extend that lead with an eighth consecutive victory over crisis-stricken Hamburg. Among the chasing pack are Borussia Dortmund, who face surprise packages Eintracht Frankfurt in a key clash in the race for Europe. Elsewhere, Leon Bailey is expected to return to action for Bayer Leverkusen, while Schalke sporting director faces an emotional homecoming when his side travel to former club Mainz. Bayern Munich's clash with Hamburg on Saturday looks set to be overshadowed by talk of who will succeed Jupp Heynckes. In an interview with SportBild magazine this week, Heynckes appeared to confirm that he will not stay on as Bayern head coach beyond this summer. ""I will be 73 in the summer, and you never know how much more time you have,"" said Heynckes. While Bayern could have the Bundesliga title wrapped up in a matter of weeks, Hamburg are staring down the barrel of a first relegation in their history. With the club seven points adrift of safety, sporting director Jens Todt and chairman Heribert Bruchhagen were fired this week. Eintracht Frankfurt are looking to muscle in on the Bundesliga's elite as they prepare to face top six rivals Borussia Dortmund. Frankfurt were relegation candidates when coach Niko Kovac took over two years ago, but are now firmly in the race for Champions League qualification ahead of this weekend's clash with Dortmund. ""We have the potential to be a really big club,"" said Frankfurt midfielder Makoto Hasebe this week. Leon Bailey is expected to return to action for Bayer Leverkusen when they host Borussia Monchengladbach. The Jamaican starlet was left on the bench during Leverkusen's win over Wolfsburg last weekend, after struggling with a thigh strain earlier that week. He is set to return to the starting line-up on Saturday, however, as fifth-placed Leverkusen look to break back into the Champions League spots. It will be a painful homecoming for sporting director Christian Heidel when Schalke travel to Mainz. Heidel spent 24 years as Mainz's director of sport before moving to Schalke in 2016. He now returns to face a Mainz side who are struggling to move off the relegation play-off place. ""This will be my most difficult homecoming,"" Heidel told Bild. ""I know what victory for us might mean for Mainz. There will be two hearts beating in my chest on Friday."" Coach Stefan Ruthenbeck has warned his players not to throw in the towel as Cologne move ever closer to relegation. Bottom of the table Cologne travel to Werder Bremen on Monday, as they look to narrow the eight-point gap between themselves and the relegation play-off place. ""Our chances of staying up are obviously getting smaller,"" admitted Ruthenbeck. ""But we still have a chance. Giving up is forbidden."""

Second-place Borussia Dortmund host Augsburg on Monday, with fans from both sides set to boycott the game. Elsewhere, Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time against Mainz on Friday, while RB Leipzig look set to host Cologne without star midfielder Naby Keita. Here are five things to look out for in this weekend's Bundesliga action: Jupp Heynckes has worked wonders since returning to Bayern Munich, and on Saturday he looks set to break an incredible club record. Heynckes, who has led Bayern to 23 victories in 24 games since October, could now become the first Bayern coach ever to win 15 games in a row. The 72-year-old watched his side romp to victory over Besiktas in midweek to pick up a 14th consecutive win, equalling a club record set under Pal Csernai back in 1980. Bayern are expected to be without James Rodriguez, who was forced to leave the pitch after 44 minutes against Besiktas with a calf problem. A diagnosis on Wednesday confirmed that the Colombian will be out of action for no more than a few days. More fan protests are expected this Monday when Borussia Dortmund take on Augsburg in the Bundesliga's second Monday night fixture. Last week's inaugural Monday game saw fierce protests from Eintracht Frankfurt fans, who blew whistles and held up banners in protest at the new scheduling. This Monday, both Dortmund and Augsburg fan groups are expected to continue protests. Around 300 Dortmund fan clubs have reportedly signed up to a boycott led by the influential fan group ""Suedtribuene Dortmund"". ""We accept every opinion and every protest, as long as it is carried out peacefully,"" said Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. RB Leipzig will be without star midfielder Naby Keita when they host Cologne on Sunday evening. The Guinean midfielder left the field after just an hour in Leipzig's defeat to Frankfurt on Monday, having pulled his hamstring. Captain Willi Orban is also a doubt after suffering a cut to his knee in a collision with Frankfurt's Sebastien Haller on Monday. Coach Ralph Hasenhuettl, though, claimed that the injuries were not a disaster for his team, as Leipzig look to muscle their way back into the top four this weekend. ""We have enough quality to replace both of them,"" insisted Hasenhuettl. Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time on Friday evening, as the Wolves travel to Mainz for a crucial bottom of the table clash. Labbadia took charge of the struggling Wolves after Martin Schmidt's sudden resignation earlier this week, and is now tasked with leading the club back to safety. ""We have to use every hour available to us,"" said Labbadia. ""I will demand of my players that they invest everything into this fight."" Relegation threatened Hamburg find themselves in last chance saloon ahead of Saturday's visit to arch rivals Werder Bremen.

26,18/02/2018,20:50,Five things we learned from the Bundesliga,"Arjen Robben missed his first penalty in six years, but that didn't stop Bayern Munich from snatching victory against Wolfsburg and taking their lead to 19 points. Borussia Dortmund moved up to second after Marco Reus fired them to victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach, but RB Leipzig could yet overtake them with a win against Eintracht Frankfurt on Monday. Elsewhere, Mario Gomez lifted Stuttgart away from the relegation zone with a winner against Augsburg.","Here are five talking points from this weekend's Bundesliga action. Arjen Robben stirred unhappy memories in Bayern Munich's 2-1 win against Wolfsburg, missing a penalty for the first time since the 2012 Champions League Final. Robben's penalty misery six years ago marked a low point in his career, as opponents Chelsea went on to win the title. The Dutchman had not missed a spot-kick since for Bayern until he failed to beat Koen Casteels from 12 yards on Saturday. He would quickly make amends, however, providing the assist for Bayern's equaliser and winning the penalty for Robert Lewandowski's injury-time winner. ""If you pick up an assist and win a penalty after having missed one earlier in the game, I think you can be happy,"" said Robben. Marco Reus marked his return to fitness with a fine goal on Sunday, but it was the playing surface which made the headlines as Borussia Dortmund beat Borussia Moenchengladbach. Ravaged by both cold and wet weather in recent weeks, the pitch at the Borussia Park was in a dreadful condition, and became steadily worse as the game progressed. Referee Bastian Dankert chose to let the game go ahead, however, and bobbling balls and a slippy surface were not enough to stop Reus from lashing in a brilliant first-half winner for Dortmund. Breel Embolo netted what would be the decisive goal in Schalke's 2-1 victory over Hoffenheim on Saturday, and immediately dedicated his winner to the team's video analyst. The Swiss international took advantage of a mistake by Hoffenheim's Kevin Vogt, intercepting a pass across the defensive line and sliding the ball effortlessly past goalkeeper Oliver Baumann. ""At least 80 per cent of the goal belongs to our video analyst,"" admitted Embolo. ""We knew in advance that Vogt has a tendency to play brave passes, and that sometimes he is too brave."" Mario Gomez will be hoping that his winner for Stuttgart on Sunday will have caught the eye of Germany coach Joachim Loew. The 32-year-old has his sights set on a return to the national team set-up for this summer's World Cup in Russia. ""Joachim Loew knows that he can rely on me,"" he told Welt. ""The important thing is that he sees I am fit, that I have energy and self-confidence. At the moment, I have all those things, 100 per cent."" Gomez certainly showed that on Sunday, as his first-half strike inspired Stuttgart to a first away win of the season. The video assistant referee was once again the subject of controversy. Cologne were left furious when Claudio Pizarro's late winner against Hanover was ruled out with the help of VAR, and there was confusion in Augsburg after Michael Gregoritsch's equaliser was disallowed after a full two minutes of discussion. ""It's not about whether the decision is right or not, it's that it seems arbitrary when the referee chooses to use VAR,"" said Cologne goalkeeper Timo Horn. ""Anyone who loves football has lost something this season."""
27,17/02/2018,20:44,Last-gasp Lewandowski penalty rescues Bayern at Wolfsburg,Robert Lewandowski converted a 91st-minute penalty to rescue Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich with a 2-1 win at Wolfsburg on Saturday which took their winning streak to 13 and extended their advantage at the top of the table to 21 points.,"With Bayern hosting Besiktas in the last 16, first leg of the Champions League on Tuesday, they rested several stars and were almost made to pay. Wolfsburg striker Daniel Didavi gave the hosts an early lead while Bayern winger Arjen Robben had a second-half penalty saved. However, Sandro Wagner headed Bayern level in the 64th minute before substitute Lewandowski hit the winning penalty in injury time. The win stretched Bayern's runaway lead to 21 points as they steam towards a sixth straight title. ""This will to win games, even though it does not seem to be exciting at the top (of the table), makes it fun. This team is just awesome,"" said Bayern captain Thomas Mueller. Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes named a weakened team with David Alaba, Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Joshua Kimmich, Mueller and Lewandowski starting on the bench. Wolfsburg profited from Bayern's slow start after only eight minutes when Yunus Malli's cross was headed home by Didavi. Bayern winger Franck Ribery was then booked when the video referee spotted he had swatted Renato Steffen in the face in a challenge for the ball. It was 1-0 at the break, but Bayern were awarded a penalty when Steffen barged over Corentin Tolisso in the area on 53 minutes. Steffen was booked for his furious protest, but Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels palmed Robben's spot-kick onto the post. Bayern drew level when Robben's cross was met in the middle by Wagner -- Lewandowski's back-up -- to head home on 64 minutes. Heynckes responded by bringing on Mueller, Alaba and Lewandowski in the final half an hour. When Germany Under-19 international Gian-Luca Itter pulled Robben back in the area, the referee pointed to the spot. Casteels got a glove to the ball, but Lewandowski claimed his 20th league goal this season with the last-gasp penalty. RB Leipzig are at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga's first Monday night kick-off, which allowed Bayer Leverkusen to climb to second with a 2-1 win at Hamburg. Leon Bailey continued his stellar season by rounding Hamburg's goalkeeper Christian Mathenia on 40 minutes. It was the 20-year-old Jamaican's ninth league goal this season. Leverkusen's 18-year-old striker Kai Havertz doubled their lead after the break, finishing a move Bailey started. Hamburg forward Andre Hahn came off the bench to claim a consolation goal. Schalke climbed to fifth with a 2-1 win at home to Hoffenheim, whose captain Kevin Vogt gave away the winning goal with a howler of an error. With Schalke 1-0 up in Gelsenkirchen, Vogt's lazy pass across his goal was intercepted by Breel Embolo. With Hoffenheim's goalkeeper out of position the Swiss striker tapped into an empty net on 28 minutes, before Andrej Kramaric headed a consolation goal for the visitors. The result leaves just a point separating second-placed Leverkusen from Schalke in fifth. Freiburg captain Nils Petersen converted a first-half penalty in their 1-0 win at home to Werder Bremen in persistent falling snow. The win ended Freiburg's three-match run without a victory while Bremen stay just above the relegation places. Bottom side Cologne remain nine points from safety as they drew 1-1 at home to Hanover. Japan striker Yuya Osako gave Cologne an early lead before Hanover forward Niclas Fuellkrug equalised with his 10th league goal of the season. In the dying stages, 39-year-old Claudio Pizarro came off the Cologne bench and had the ball in the net, but his header was ruled offside. On Sunday, Borussia Dortmund can go second with a win at Borussia Moenchengladbach as Michy Batshuayi looks to add to his five goals in three games."
28,05/02/2018,12:11,Five things we learned from the Bundesliga weekend,"Michy Batshuayi made a blistering start to life at Borussia Dortmund on Friday, firing the team back into the top four with two goals on his debut.","The Belgian wasn't the only debutant to make an impact, as 20-year-old English forward Ademola Lookman grabbed a late winner in his first game for RB Leipzig. The goal saw Leipzig move up to third in the Bundesliga, drawing level on points with second-place Bayer Leverkusen. Both Leverkusen and Leipzig are now 18 points behind leaders Bayern Munich, whose victory over Mainz on Saturday was overshadowed by speculation over coach Jupp Heynckes' future. Here are five things we learned from this weekend's Bundesliga action. Who needs Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang when you have Michy Batshuayi? Just three days after joining Dortmund on a six-month loan deal, Batshuayi enjoyed an explosive debut, grabbing two goals and an assist to inspire his new team to a 3-2 victory in Cologne. ""The way the game went for him today was like a dream,"" said coach Peter Stoeger of his new striker. Batshuayi, meanwhile, is already dreaming of big goals for his six-month sojourn in Westphalia. ""I want to get into the Champions League with Dortmund,"" he said. ""I want to win every single game."" Bayern Munich's dominance of the Bundesliga continued at the weekend, but there was more attention paid to Jupp Heynckes' future. The 72-year-old's contract runs until June, and he has repeatedly refused to talk about extending it. ""I can imagine that readers, viewers and listeners are bored of this topic,"" he said on Friday. Since coming out of retirement to take over at Bayern in the autumn, Heynckes has led the team to 14 victories in 15 Bundesliga games, so it is little wonder that the club would like him to stay beyond the end of the season. ""If I stood naked in front of him, I might have a small chance of persuading him to stay,"" joked club president Uli Hoeness earlier in the week. Everton loanee Ademola Lookman grabbed the headlines on Saturday, scoring 12 minutes into his RB Leipzig debut to secure a late victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach. The 20-year-old Englishman might, however, want to invest in a pair of new boots. ""He was lucky that I didn't take him off again straight away,"" admitted Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""He was just sliding around in the boots he was wearing. They were the only pair he had brought with him from England, and he didn't want to take them off."" Both goalkeepers were left blushing in Gelsenkirchen as Werder Bremen snatched a late 2-1 win over Schalke. Bremen 'keeper Jiri Pavlenka allowed Yevhen Konoplyanka's shot to slip through his fingers in the first half. His error was overshadowed by the woes of opposite number Ralf Faehrmann, however -- he first fumbled a free-kick to gift Bremen an equaliser, before being nutmegged by Zlatko Junuzovic's late winner. ""Ralf said sorry in the dressing room, and I told him he had nothing to apologise for,"" said Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco. Michael Gregoritsch will have enjoyed watching the Super Bowl on Sunday, having secured three points for Augsburg just hours earlier. The Austrian scored Augsburg's second in a 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt, and celebrated by miming a quarterback's throw. ""I will definitely be watching the Super Bowl later,"" admitted Gregoritsch after the game. ""My four best friends are coming over; I never sleep after a game anyway."""
29,02/02/2018,22:43,Batshuayi nets twice on Dortmund debut,Michy Batshuayi scored twice on his Borussia Dortmund debut in Friday's 3-2 Bundesliga win at bottom side Cologne -- just two days after signing on loan from Chelsea.,"Head coach Peter Stoeger, who was sacked by Cologne in December, threw the Belgian striker in at the deep end to replace Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Dortmund sold their top-scorer to Arsenal for £56 million ($79 million, 63 million euros), then signed Batshuayi hours later as cover until May. ""I am very happy, but the most important thing was the win,"" Batshuayi told Eurosport. ""It's my first match, it was always going to be difficult, so I am really happy we got the three points."" Having already scored 12 goals for Chelsea this season, Batshuayi scored 35 minutes into his Bundesliga debut when he fired home a cross. Cologne equalised with an hour gone, but the 24-year-old Batshuayi showed ice-cool finishing to restore the lead less than two minutes later. He could have finished with a hat-trick having put the ball in the net just before the break, but the video assistant referee (VAR) spotted he was offside. Cologne levelled for the second time when Jorge Mere headed home, but Batshuayi provided the final pass for Andre Schuerrle to hit the winner. The win broke Dortmund's run of three draws. It lifts them to second in the table, level on 34 points with Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke who play Saturday, behind leaders Bayern Munich. The defeat ends Cologne's four-match unbeaten run which yielded 10 points to boost survival hopes. Batshuayi grabbed his first goal when Dortmund left-back Jeremy Toljan fired a cross into the box for the Belgian striker to fire home. The pair combined again just before the break when Batshuayi again tapped home, but the goal was ruled offside by the VAR. It was 1-0 at the break, but Cologne drew level on 60 minutes when second-half replacement midfielder Simon Zoller finished off a counter-attack. However, Dortmund replied almost immediately. Christian Pulisic headed down a long ball and Batshuayi robbed Cologne defender Dominique Heintz before firing home from a tight angle. Cologne equalised again on 69 minutes when Mere headed home from a corner. Shuerrle claimed his first league goal for 11 months when Batshuayi spotted the Germany winger free on the right and he smashed home the winner. Swiss centre-back Manuel Akanji, who cost 21.5 million euros ($26.4 million) from Basel last month, made his Dortmund debut in the dying stages off the bench."
30,10/12/2017,17:43,Freiburg win basement battle in seven-goal thriller,Freiburg came from three goals down to win Sunday's thrilling Bundesliga basement battle 4-3 at Cologne as visiting striker Nils Petersen wrapped up his hat-trick with a 95th-minute penalty.,"A heavy overnight snowfall created testing conditions at bottom side Cologne, but the hosts charged into a 3-0 lead with just half an hour gone. Lukas Kluenter hit the bottom right-hand corner after eight minutes then French striker Sehrou Guirassy converted a 16th-minute penalty only after the referee struggled to find the spot under the snow. Freiburg's USA midfielder Caleb Stanko turned the ball into his own net to make it 3-0 with 29 minutes gone and Cologne were on course for their first win this season. However, ex-Bayern striker Petersen offered Freiburg faint hope by pulling a goal with a superb volley direct from a cross just before half-time. Then with an hour gone, midfielder Janik Haberer put Freiburg back in the game with a bullet header from a corner. Petersen equalised in the 90th minute by converting his first penalty and grabbed an unlikely win for Freiburg by drilling home a second spot-kick just before the final whistle after a handball from Guirassy. ""I thought I had wandered into the wrong film, the way we conceded goals at the start,"" said Freiburg's eccentic coach Christian Streich. ""Then we changed ends and got our chances. ""The team showed enormous will and a tolerance to frustration at the end."" Freiburg are now 16th in the table, still in the relegation places. ""That's very bitter, we started really well and did a lot of things right,"" said Cologne's caretaker coach Stefan Ruthenbeck. ""There are no excuses, the team gave their all, but we lost because we couldn't maintain the intensity and that's a fact."" The defeat broke Cologne hearts, leaving them winless after their first 15 matches and 12 points from safety in their first league games since cult coach Peter Stoeger was sacked last weekend. Stoeger was named new coach of Borussia Dortmund on Sunday, a day after they crashed 2-1 at home to Werder Bremen, their eighth league game without a win, which cost Stoeger's predecessor Peter Bosz his job. Later mid-table Hanover 96 enjoyed a 2-0 win in heavy falling snow at home to Hoffenheim as Niclas Fuellkrug and Martin Harnik scored their goals. Under Julian Nagelsmann, Germany's coach of the year in 2016, Hoffenheim have now dropped eight points in their last four games to fall to sixth. On Saturday, Bayern Munich opened an eight-point lead at the top of the table with a 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt after second-placed RB Leipzig conceded a late equaliser in their 2-2 draw with Mainz."
31,06/12/2017,16:37,Bottom club Cologne turn to 'expert' Veh,Bottom side Cologne on Wednesday appointed former Bundesliga-winning coach Armin Veh as managing director in their battle to stay in Germany's top flight.,"The 56-year-old Veh who led VfB Stuttgart to the German league title in 2007 signed a deal until June 2020. He has his work cut out to keep Cologne up as they currently sit 11 points from safety and sacked coach Peter Stoeger on Monday. ""I am looking forward to the opportunity of tackling a sustainable project with Cologne,"" said Veh, who last coached at Eintracht Frankfurt in 2015-16. ""I see this as a major challenge and opportunity to make something happen at this fascinating traditional soccer club."" Veh knows his way around the Bundesliga after stints at Wolfsburg, Hamburg and Frankfurt, but his only real success came a decade ago at Stuttgart. Former Germany captain Lothar Matthaeus welcomed the appointment. ""That was the right choice - Cologne have picked up an absolute expert,"" Matthaeus, a TV pundit, told Sky News. Cologne are winless after 14 Bundesliga games and have put Under-19 coach Stefan Ruthenbeck in a caretaker role for the next three weeks. Veh replaces Joerg Schmadtke, who left in October having joined in 2013 alongside Stoeger, and the duo took the club up from the second division. Cologne finished fifth last season to qualify for the Europa League, but injuries, plus loaning striker Anthony Modeste to China, took a toll. Ruthenbeck has only 11 fit out-field players for his debut as coach on Thursday in their final Europa League group game at Red Star Belgrade. Cologne are second, thanks to their shock 1-0 win at home to Arsenal a fortnight ago, and victory in Belgrade will put them in the knock-out stages."
32,23/11/2017,21:29,"Arsenal lose at Cologne, Balotelli propels Nice",Arsene Wenger's Arsenal secured top spot in Europa League Group H on Thursday despite slumping to a 1-0 defeat at struggling German side Cologne.,"The Frenchman made 11 changes to the team that beat Tottenham Hotspur in last weekend's north London derby, with starts handed to Olivier Giroud, Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck. But the Gunners succumbed to a 62nd-minute penalty from Sehrou Guirassy after the French striker tumbled to ground inside the area under a challenge from Mathieu Debuchy. Cologne, winless through 12 Bundesliga matches this season, climbed to second with one match to play, as a 0-0 draw between BATE Borisov and Red Star Belgrade in Belarus confirmed Arsenal's status as group winners. Mario Balotelli scored twice as Nice moved into the last 32 following a 3-1 victory over Zulte Waregem of Belgium, with Lazio dropping their first points in Group K after a 1-1 draw at home to Vitesse Arnhem. Villarreal progressed to the knockout stages as Democratic Republic of Congo striker Cedric Bakambu netted a brace to seal a 3-2 victory over Astana in Kazakhstan. Surprise Swedish side Ostersund -- coached by Englishman Graham Potter -- extended their run in Europe into the New Year with a 2-0 home win over Ukrainians Zorya Luhansk. Veteran Spain striker Aritz Aduriz scored two penalties in Athletic Bilbao's 3-2 win over Hertha Berlin to leave the Basque club with their fate in their own hands. Seven-time European champions AC Milan will wrap up their spot in the knockout phase with victory over Austria Vienna at the San Siro later on Thursday."
33,05/11/2017,18:00,Wagner stakes Germany claim to face England,Sandro Wagner made a case to face England in Germany's forthcoming friendly international by netting twice in Hoffenheim's 3-0 win at the Bundesliga's bottom side Cologne on Sunday.,"The Germans face Gareth Southgate's England at Wembley on Friday before hosting France four days later in Cologne in friendlies designed to test the defending champions before next year's World Cup in Russia. The burly Wagner, who has five caps and five international goals to his name, drilled home a penalty on 56 minutes, then netted a header from a cross by ex-Leicester City player Andrej Kramaric on 80 minutes. Hoffenheim had taken the lead after just nine minutes when midfielder Dennis Geiger stabbed the ball home at the second attempt. The result lifts Hoffenheim to fifth, seven points behind leaders Bayern Munich who are now four-points clear at the top after Saturday's 3-1 win at Borussia Dortmund, who drop to third. Cologne remain rooted to the bottom, eight points from safety after 11 games with pressure growing on Austrian coach Peter Stoeger. Wagner's double in Cologne is well timed after Germany's first-choice striker Timo Werner underlined his form after a neck injury with a goal and assist in RB Leipzig's 2-1 comeback win at home to Hanover 96. The 21-year-old Werner, who has featured eight times for Germany and scored six goals, played his first 90 minutes since September and set up Yussuf Poulsen's equaliser, then netted an 85th-minute winner after the Brazilian Jonathas gave Hanover the lead at Leipzig's Red Bull Arena. The result left Leipzig second in the table, four points behind Bayern."
34,30/10/2017,15:55,Cologne fined over disturbances at Arsenal,"Cologne have been ordered to pay Arsenal 60,000 euros ($69,675, £53,000) by UEFA in compensation to help repair damage caused by their supporters during last month's Europa League tie at the Emirates Stadium.","As well as the fine, European football's governing body has also imposed a one-match travel ban on Cologne fans, which is suspended for two years in the event of further disturbances. The sanctions announced Monday come after crowd trouble overshadowed Arsenal's 3-1 victory in London on September 14. More than 20,000 German fans flooded into England's capital as the Bundesliga side made their first appearance in European competition for 25 years. Cologne were given 3,000 tickets to distribute to away fans, but the Group H tie was delayed by an hour as German fans without tickets tried to get into the stadium. It is estimated 15,000 Cologne fans found their way into the Arsenal stadium and police arrested five fans on the day of the game. Although Cologne apologised to Arsenal, UEFA has charged the German club over crowd disturbances, setting off fireworks, throwing objects and acts of damage by the visiting fans."
35,24/10/2017,13:34,Sporting director Schmadtke leaves struggling Cologne,Sporting director Joerg Schmadtke has taken responsibility for Cologne's disastrous start to the season by parting company with the Bundesliga's bottom side.,"Despite having been voted 'manager of the year' by German football magazine 11Freunde only in July, after Cologne finished fifth last season, Schmadtke has left the club by mutual consent. ""With this step, I want to make the way clear for some new impulse,"" said Schmadtke in a statement. As Schmadtke departs, coach Peter Stoeger remains in his position despite Cologne having taken just two points from their first nine league games. The two-time Bundesliga champions are already six points from outright safety after a 0-0 draw with Werder Bremen at the weekend. They play Hertha Berlin away in the German Cup on Wednesday. Schmadtke, 53, spent four years with Cologne. He had a contract until 2023. Many fans blame the team's dreadful start to the season on Schmadtke's decision to send last season's 25-goal top scorer Anthony Modeste on loan to China. Modeste joined Tianjin Quanjian in July in a deal that could be worth 35 million euros ($41.1m) if he makes his two-year loan move permanent. Under Schmadtke and Stoeger, Cologne were promoted back to Germany's top flight in 2014 and last season qualified for Europe for the first time in 25 years. However, they are bottom of their Europa League group with three defeats from three games against Arsenal, Red Star Belgrade and BATE Borisov."
36,29/09/2017,15:56,Pizarro joins ailing Cologne,Bundesliga basement side Cologne on Friday signed Peruvian striker Claudio Pizarro until the end of the season.,"Pizarro, who turns 39 next week, joins Cologne after leaving rival German side Werder Bremen at the end of last term. He joins a team that has garnered just one point and scored one goal in their opening six games to leave them propping up the table. Pizarro is the top overseas striker of all time in the Bundesliga with 191 goals from 430 matches with Bayern Munich and Bremen. Cologne are sorely missing their French forward Anthony Modeste, who was sent off on loan to Chinese side Tianjin Quanjian in a transfer which could earn Cologne up to 35 million euros ($41.1m)."
37,24/09/2017,18:24,Struggling Cologne secure first point of season,Hanover 96 were held to a goalless draw at home by Bundesliga bottom side Cologne on Sunday to leave defending champions Bayern Munich third after their shock draw with Wolfsburg.,"Cologne picked up their first point in six games by containing hosts Hanover, who dominated possession but could not break the deadlock. Japan forward Yuya Osako and defender Lukas Kluenter had chances for Cologne while Niklas Fuellkrug missed a good opportunity at the other end for Hanover. The result means Hanover stay fourth in the table, missing the chance to climb above Bayern, who threw away a two-goal lead in Friday's 2-2 draw in Munich against Wolfsburg. Borussia Dortmund are two points clear at the top after their 6-1 trouncing of Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick. The pressure is growing on Cologne coach Peter Stoeger, who steered them to promotion from the second division in 2013-14 to finish fifth last season. His team has now scored just one goal and taken one point in their first six league games. ""We got a point and we're happy with that,"" said Cologne defender Frederik Sorensen. ""We need to start scoring goals, though -- we can't survive without them. ""But we're fighting every game, and we'll see how far we get."""

39,19/09/2017,14:05,Cologne change mind over Dortmund protest,"Cologne have made a U-turn on plans to lodge an official protest to the German Football Association (DFB) about a controversial goal in their 5-0 drubbing at Borussia Dortmund, the club said on Tuesday.","The Bundesliga strugglers said they will not contest the final result of the game and will now simply ask the DFB's refereeing department for clarification of the rules. ""FC Cologne is of the opinion there is a need for legal clarity at the controversial points"", said a statement. After Sunday's defeat, Cologne coach Peter Stoeger and general manager Joerg Schmadtke were livid with referee Patrick Ittrich for allowing a controversial Dortmund goal just before half-time that made it 2-0 at the break. In the build-up, Dortmund defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos pushed Cologne defender Dominique Heintz, who knocked into goalkeeper Timo Horn, which caused him to fumble the ball from which Sokratis scored. Ittrich allowed the goal to stand after consulting with the video assistant referee (VAR), but replays showed the goal was scored after he had blown his whistle for the foul, which is against the rules. While Cologne fumed at the decision to allow the goal to stand, Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke accused the visitors of being bad losers given the margin of the scoreline. On Tuesday, Stoeger welcomed the softened stance. ""I think this is the right way to go,"" said the Austrian, whose side are bottom of the Bundesliga table after four straight defeats. ""It was right to communicate a sharp complaint, but as a supporter of the video assistant referee, I have to say that if one wants to take it further, we have to point at problem areas. ""It's conducive to it's development."""
40,18/09/2017,14:26,Dortmund crush Cologne amidst controversy,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice in a minute as Borussia Dortmund went back atop of the Bundesliga on Sunday after a 5-0 hammering of Cologne, who fumed over a controversial goal.","After losing at Tottenham Hotspur in midweek in the Champions League, Dortmund needed just 111 seconds to take the lead at home. Winger Andrey Yarmolenko fired in a cross which was headed home by fellow new-signing Maximilian Philipp. On the stroke of half-time, Cologne goalkeeper Timo Horn fumbled a cross and defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos tapped home the loose ball to make it 2-0 at the break. There were furious protests from Cologne, as replays showed the whistle went before the goal was scored, but it stood even after the video assistant referee (VAR) checked. ""We will not sign off on the match log and will protest immediately,"" said Cologne's manager Joerg Schmadtke. ""That was clearly a wrong decision which decided the game."" Aubameyang slotted home a penalty after the VAR spotted a hand-ball on 59 minutes and just 58 seconds later the Gabon striker bagged his second from a Lukasz Piszczek's pass. Aubameyang, last season's top scorer in the Bundesliga, now has four goals in as many league games, one behind Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski. Philipp then grabbed his second of the game with a deft chip to cap three Dortmund goals in 10 minutes. In the dying stages, Dortmund coach Peter Bosz gave a Bundesliga debut to Swedish wunderkind Alexander Isak, who turns 18 on Thursday. Cologne's strong protests over the second goal went down badly in the Dortmund camp. ""The only thing which is clear is that Cologne can't take losing,"" said Borussia's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. ""And if you can't take losing, then you turn to bad methods. ""If you do so after losing 5-0, then hats off,"" he added sarcastically. The win leaves Borussia top on goal difference from second-placed Hanover 96 with defending champions Bayern Munich third and just a point behind after Saturday's 4-0 win at home to Mainz when Lewandowski scored twice. Cologne are bottom with four straight defeats while Dortmund have yet to concede a league goal. Hanover were top of the table for 48 hours -- their first time in first place since 1969 -- after Friday's 2-0 win at Hamburg thanks to goals by Martin Harnik and Togo winger Ihlas Bebou. Earlier on Sunday, Hoffenheim missed the chance to go top when they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Hertha Berlin as Sandro Wagner's early goal was cancelled out by Alexander Esswein's second-half equaliser. The result leaves Hoffenheim fourth in the table with Hertha down to 11th and keeps Hanover, who won promotion back to the Bundesliga last season, as unlikely league leaders. Also on Sunday, Germany striker Kevin Volland netted twice as Bayer Leverkusen left the relegation places to go 12th with a 4-0 rout of Freiburg. After taking just a point from their first three league games, Leverkusen flew out of the traps at the BayArena as Volland netted either side of a stunning strike from Chile midfielder Charles Aranguiz. Volland opened the scoring with a superb strike from outside the area, but not to be outdone, Aranguiz showed superb technique by volleying home, then Volland tapped home Lars Bender's cross to make it 3-0 at the break. Freiburg coach Christian Streich reacted for the second-half by bringing on England Under-20 winger Ryan Kent, who went close with a late shot, but the result left the club in the bottom three. The 25-year-old Volland looked to have wrapped up his hat-trick on 70 minutes, but the video assistant referee disallowed the goal due to a foul in the build-up before Julian Brandt scored Leverkusen's fourth from a quickly taken free-kick."
41,18/09/2017,12:53,Cologne set to protest over controversial goal,Cologne say they plan to protest to the German Football Association (DFB) on Monday over a controversial goal which has raised debate over the video assistant referee (VAR) in Germany's top flight.,"Cologne were crushed 5-0 at Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund on Sunday which left them bottom of the German league after four straight defeats. But Cologne's bench were furious after Dortmund defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos scored just before the half-time break in controversial fashion to make it 2-0. In the build-up to the goal, Sokratis pushed Cologne defender Dominique Heintz, who knocked into goalkeeper Timo Horn, which caused him to fumble the ball from which Sokratis scored. The referee Patrick Ittrich allowed the goal to stand after consulting with the VAR. However, replays show the goal was scored after the ref had blown his whistle for the foul, which is against the rules. ""We want a clarification of the legal situation,"" said Cologne's director Joerg Schmadtke after an internal meeting on Monday. ""You can assume that we are protesting, because the rules were broken. ""We can not just pretend that nothing happened."" Despite the heavy scoreline, Cologne say the controversial goal was a key factor in their defeat, but Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke accused them of being 'bad losers'. ""If they want to protest, they should, but that is grotesque, almost ridiculous,"" added Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc."
42,15/09/2017,13:00,"UEFA charges Arsenal, Cologne after fan chaos","European football chiefs charged Arsenal and Cologne on Friday after vast numbers of away fans gained access to the home sections of Emirates Stadium, sparking chaotic scenes that marred the Europa League clash.","Visiting fans were issued with 3,000 tickets but around 20,000 fans of the German club are believed to have made the journey to the British capital. The start of the match was delayed by an hour as ticketless Cologne fans tried to gain entry to the ground in north London and there were clearly thousands of away supporters sitting among Arsenal fans, causing a security risk. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said he had been preparing for a postponement, describing the decision to play Thursday's Group H tie as a ""gamble"". Both clubs now face disciplinary proceedings from governing body UEFA. Cologne fans are accused of crowd disturbances, setting off fireworks, throwing objects and causing acts of damage, while Arsenal face a probe for ""stairways blocked in away supporters sector"". UEFA said it would deal with the cases on September 21. Five arrests were made during the evening. Arsenal issued a statement insisting the safety of supporters was the main concern at the time as the club launched a ""full review"" of the events. Earlier, YouTube footage showed thousands of Cologne fans surging through the streets of London, chanting in unison and setting off flares. ""Following last night's UEFA Europa League match with Cologne, we would like to stress that fan safety was always our paramount concern and informed all decisions made,"" Arsenal's statement said. ""We have launched a full review into the circumstances surrounding the game and will ensure any lessons that can be learned are used in the future."" Arsenal said they were investigating how away fans gained access after pictures emerged of a minority of Cologne supporters causing problems for stewards inside the stadium. ""They (Cologne fans) were very clever,"" said Wenger. ""I don't know how they managed to infiltrate our fans and get everywhere but they did that very well. I don't know if they went through Arsenal membership, on the internet... they did very well. ""I thought they would not play the game, because I can't see the police taking any risk. ""We live in a society of 100 percent security and I thought they would never take a gamble to play this game when I saw the images around the stadium. But I must say our supporters as well dealt well with the situation and there was no aggravation."" Cologne goalkeeper Timo Horn said fans who misbehaved had ""brought shame on the club"" and club legend Bodo Illgner, a World Cup-winning goalkeeper with Germany in 1990, also criticised the small minority of fans who misbehaved. Arsenal's statement also said it was ""very disappointing"" that so many home tickets appeared to have been purchased by Cologne supporters via ticket touts after the club worked closely with police, who deployed extra numbers once the trouble began, and UEFA. ""The 3,000 tickets issued to Cologne fans was in line with competition rules but it is clear many more visiting fans arrived, causing significant congestion and disturbance outside the stadium before kick-off,"" it said. ""Many tickets were sold through touts and this is very disappointing and something we continue to work hard to address."" Arsenal won the match 3-1 after falling behind to a long-range strike from Jhon Cordoba before bouncing back in the second half. Substitute Sead Kolasinac equalised before goals from Alexis Sanchez and Hector Bellerin gave the Londoners the win. Cologne coach Peter Stoeger refused to be questioned on the actions of the club's supporters, saying: ""I have no comment about the fans."" ""I'm the coach, my job is the team, my job is football not the fans,"" the Austrian added."

Thousands of ticketless supporters of German club Cologne arrived at the Emirates, with kick-off delayed by an hour in the interests of ""crowd safety"". Police, forced into deploying extra officers, made five arrests after dealing with ""disorder"" at the Emirates as Cologne fans occupied home sections of the ground, with an estimated 20,000 supporters having travelled from Germany despite there only being 3,000 away tickets. Arsenal fell behind early on to a brilliant long-range strike from Jhon Cordoba before bouncing back in the second half, substitute Sead Kolasinac equalising before goals from Alexis Sanchez and Hector Bellerin saw the Gunners to victory. Afterwards Wenger said he was getting ready for the game to be postponed but was uncertain if the delayed kick-off was to blame for the Gunners' poor start. ""It's difficult to say,"" he said. ""It was similar for Cologne but we had some problems to get off, to start, yes. I don't know, was it mental? ""We waited patiently in our dressing room but what was difficult for me was I had all kind of plans to think about at some stage."" Wenger added: ""I had to think if we play tomorrow at what time do we want to play, do we play next week but they had the Bundesliga again midweek and we had a League Cup game midweek as well. ""But in the end at some stage I thought they would not play the game, because I can't see the police taking any risk,"" he explained. ""We live in a society of 100 percent security and I thought they would never take a gamble to play this game when I saw the images around the stadium. ""But I must say our supporters dealt well with the situation as well and there was no aggravation."" Wenger said Cologne fans had been ""very clever"" to get into areas reserved for home supporters. ""I don't know how they managed to infiltrate our fans and get everywhere but they did that very well. I don't know if they went through Arsenal membership, on the internet... they did very well."" One social media post appeared to indicate scuffles inside the ground, with Richard Conway, a BBC sports news correspondent, tweeting: ""Koln (Cologne) fans fighting with stewards inside Emirates stadium. Group arrived in home end and fought their way into away section."" Cologne coach Peter Stoeger refused to be questioned on the actions of the club's supporters: ""I have no comment about the fans,"" he said. ""I'm the coach, my job is the team, my job is football not the fans,"" the Austrian added. Asked on the eve of the match if he had a message for the thousands of travelling Cologne fans, Stoeger replied: ""Enjoy the pubs!"" Cologne are currently bottom of the Bundesliga table, having lost all three of their opening games in this season's German top flight. But they qualified for the Europa League after finishing fifth last term."

Police confirmed four arrests were made before kick-off while there were reports of scuffles inside the stadium. However, when the match did get under way, those travelling fans who got in were treated to a stunning 40-yard strike by Jhon Cordoba that put Cologne ahead with Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina caught out of his area. Arsenal improved in the second half and substitute Sead Kolasinac volleyed them level before a brilliant goal by Sanchez gave them a 67th-minute lead. The Chilean cut in from the left flank before curling a sublime effort into the far top corner, and the three points were secure when Hector Bellerin made it 3-1 late on after Theo Walcott's effort had been saved by Timo Horn. ""The win, and coming back from losing, obviously gives you a boost. Now we'll train hard in the coming days to be ready for the weekend,"" Bellerin, whose side go to Chelsea on Sunday, told BT Sport. Arsene Wenger's side are next in European action in a fortnight in Belarus against BATE Borisov, who drew 1-1 at Red Star Belgrade. Earlier, Everton's group-stage campaign got off to a disastrous start as Ronald Koeman's side were taken apart in Italy, losing 3-0 to Atalanta. The Serie A club -- back in Europe after a 26-year absence -- were forced to entertain their English visitors in Reggio Emilia, a two-hour drive south of their base in Bergamo, because their own stadium does not have a licence for European games. But that did not prove a hindrance to Gian Piero Gasperini's side, who completely overran Everton, scoring all their goals in the first half courtesy of Andrea Masiello, Alejandro Gomez and Bryan Cristante. Gomez's goal, a stunning curling strike from outside the area, was the pick of the bunch for Atalanta, who also saw Remo Freuler strike the bar early in the second period. ""A lot went wrong. In the first half they showed more aggression, more passion, and that's really painful because in my opinion it starts with that and then you need quality with the ball,"" Koeman told BT Sport. ""The commitment and passion they showed in the first half was much stronger than us."" Everton's next match in Group E will be at home to Apollon Limassol, the Cypriot side who snatched a 1-1 draw with Lyon on Thursday. Meanwhile, AC Milan underlined their status as one of the teams to beat in the competition by romping to a 5-1 victory at Austria Vienna in Group D with Andre Silva scoring a hat-trick. Milan were three goals up inside 20 minutes in the Austrian capital with Hakan Calhanolgu getting the opener and Portugal striker Silva netting twice. Silva went on to complete his hat-trick after the break before Suso's long-range effort completed the rout. Hoffenheim, who lost to Liverpool in the Champions League play-offs but beat Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga last weekend, suffered a 2-1 defeat at home to Portuguese side Braga in Group C despite Sandro Wagner giving them the lead. Other winners on Thursday included Villarreal, who beat Astana 3-1 in Spain in Group A, and Real Sociedad, who crushed Rosenborg 4-0 in Group L. Mario Balotelli scored as Nice won 5-1 at Zulte-Waregem of Belgium in Group K, in which Lazio also won, 3-2 at Vitesse Arnhem. Marseille beat Konyaspor 1-0 in Group I while Athletic Bilbao drew 0-0 at Hertha Berlin in Group J."

The match did begin at its rescheduled time of 9:05pm local time (2005 GMT), having been pushed back an hour from its original 8:05pm (1905 GMT) start. Some Arsenal fans called for the Cologne supporters to be moved to designated away areas but stewards decided to leave them where they were, with a club spokesman telling Britain's Press Association: ""The players were relaxed and preparing for the game despite the delay... The decision to go ahead was the best option and the safest option."" Cologne fans, who had been singing before kick-off, had even more reason to celebrate when Jhon (attn eds: correct) Cordoba's 40-yard strike gave the visitors a ninth-minute lead. ""Officers are dealing with disorder at the Emirates Stadium where fans have gathered for the Arsenal vs FC Koln match,"" said a pre-match statement issued by London's Metropolitan Police. ""A policing plan is in place for the game. Additional officers have been deployed."" A subsequent statement confirmed arrests had taken place. ""Arrests at 2141hrs (2041 GMT) = four people have been arrested on suspicion of public order offences,"" Scotland Yard said.

Meanwhile Arsenal issued a statement on their website warning travelling fans they risked being kicked out of the ground if they bought tickets in the sections of the Emirates reserved for home supporters. ""Please note visiting supporters that purchase a ticket in the home end for this fixture are likely to be ejected from the stadium,"" the statement said.

48,13/09/2017,02:05,Arsenal set for drop into Europe's second tier,"Premier League giants Arsenal make their Europa League bow this week, slipping into the continent's second-string competition after nearly two decades in the Champions League, with AC Milan also injecting star quality.","Arsene Wenger's men, fifth in the Premier League last season -- their first finish outside the top four since 1995-96 -- take on German side Cologne on Thursday at the Emirates Stadium in London. The Arsenal boss said his team would take the competition seriously despite the disappointment of missing out on the Champions League after 19 consecutive seasons in Europe's premier competition. ""We will take it seriously but the priority is to focus on the Premier League and combining the two,"" he said in comments reported by Britain's Daily Telegraph. ""Then, in December, we will see, but at least we want to qualify for the next round. Thursday to Sunday morning is short so I have to think about that. But we have to win at home and you know how it is when you don't win at home."" Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech, who won the 2012/13 Europa League with Chelsea, said the competition was a worthwhile target. ""We decided that it was the first time and hopefully the last time we played the Europa League and we wanted to win it,"" he said. Arsenal's domestic rivals Manchester United won the trophy last year, giving them a route into this year's Champions League. Wenger, whose Arsenal side lost the club's previous match in the competition to Galatasary in the 2000 final, when it was branded the UEFA Cup, is likely to rotate his squad, giving some of his fringe players game time as he negotiates a tricky Group H that also includes Red Star Belgrade and Belarusian outfit BATE Borisov. Seven-time European champions AC Milan have an easier task, with ties against Austria Vienna, AEK Athens and Rijeka of Croatia in Group D as they continue their return to European competition for the first time since 2013-14. The Italians, looking to win the only major European trophy that has so far eluded them, appear to be on the road to recovery under Chinese ownership after a number of lean years. Smarting after a 4-1 Serie A defeat at Lazio at the weekend, they open their group-stage campaign at Austria Vienna after coming through two qualifying rounds. ""We are a new squad. It's my responsibility and the one of the boss and the management to lead this group to success,"" said captain Leonardo Bonucci, who joined the club from Juventus in the close season. ""We must stick together also when playing in Europa League,"" he told Milan TV. ""It's a competition that many in the team have never played in before."" Wayne Rooney's Everton will have a stern test in Group E, which also includes French club Lyon, whose Groupama Stadium will host the final on May 16. Other notable names in this year's group stage are Spanish sides Villarreal and Real Sociedad as well as Italy's Lazio."
49,26/08/2017,14:45,Cologne struggle for goals after Modeste exit,Anthony Modeste's transfer to China has left his ex-Bundesliga club Cologne struggling for goals after suffering back-to-back defeats in Germany's top tier -- a fortnight before facing Arsenal in Europe.,"Cologne have lost both their opening Bundesliga 2017/18 matches, going down 3-1 at home to Hamburg on Friday having lost 1-0 at Borussia Moenchengladbach last weekend. Germany winger Andre Hahn and US international striker Bobby Wood hit first-half goals for Hamburg before defender Frederik Sorensen scored for Cologne deep into added time as Lewis Holtby netted the visitors' third goal just before the final whistle. Last season, Cologne finished fifth in the Bundesliga to reach the Europa League and face Arsenal away in their first group stage game on September 14. It means Cologne will be back in European competition for the first time in 25 years. ""This is a new situation for us,"" admitted Cologne's Austrian coach Peter Stoeger, who took over in 2013, after back-to-back defeats. ""Something like this hasn't happened before and we have to tackle these tasks, which will be exciting,"" he added with one eye on Europe. Cologne are misfiring up front with their new striker Jhon Cordoba, 24, managing only three shots on goal against Hamburg. The Colombian is struggling to fill the boots of the burly Modeste, who scored 25 goals in 34 games last season to fire Cologne up the table before joining Chinese side Tianjin Quanjian on a two-year loan deal. ""Two games, two defeats, of course that is pretty rubbish,"" said Cologne's director Jorg Schmadtke. Cordoba cost a club record 17 million euros ($20.2m) from Mainz in June and his new team-mates have defended his below-par start. ""We're not coming together yet as a unit and Jhon is working very hard for the team,"" insisted defender Dominique Heintz with just over a fortnight before facing Arsenal away."

""All relevant parties have reached an agreement. 1. FC Köln would like to thank Tony for his performances in the FC jersey whilst wishing him all the best for the future."" German daily Bild reported that Modeste had moved to the Chinese side on a two-year loan deal for six million euros ($6.8 million) and that Tianjin Quanjian have an option to buy the Frenchman outright for 29 million euros. Previous reports had said Modeste was the subject of a 35 million-euro bid, but Cologne had insisted last month that the player would be staying in Germany. The 29-year-old scored 25 league goals last season, finishing behind only Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski (30 goals) and Borussia Dortmund forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (31 goals) in the Bundesliga scoring charts. Modeste's goals helped Cologne finish fifth in the German top flight and qualify for the group stage of the Europa League."
51,04/03/2017,19:04,Bayern go seven points clear in Germany,Bayern Munich went seven points clear at the top of the Bundesliga with a 3-0 win at Cologne on Saturday in a perfect warm-up for their midweek Champions League trip to Arsenal.,"Spain internationals Javi Martinez and Juan Bernat gave Bayern a comfortable two-goal lead before substitute Franck Ribery netted a third on 90 minutes. The result allowed Bayern to extend their lead over second-placed RB Leipzig, who drew 2-2 at Augsburg on Friday. Bayern now head for Arsenal on Tuesday for their Champions League last 16 second leg tie, holding a 5-1 first-leg lead. ""We're happy, because that was an important result for us,"" said Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti. ""We had problems at the start, because they were well organised, but we made more room after going 1-0 up and put in a good second-half performance."" Cologne earned a 1-1 draw in Munich last October, but there was no denying Bayern this time. Martinez headed home Arturo Vidal's cross after Bayern worked a short-corner routine on 25 minutes. Bayern doubled their lead when Thomas Mueller spotted Bernat unmarked to shoot home with the help of a deflection on 48 minutes. Bernat then turned provider just before the final whistle when his cross was driven home by Ribery. Borussia Dortmund will be without Germany winger Marco Reus for Wednesday's Champions League last 16 return leg at home to Benfica after he limped out of Saturday's 6-2 thrashing of Bayer Leverkusen. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice to leave him with 21 league goals in as many games, two ahead of Bayern's Robert Lewandowski, but the win was dampened by a suspected tear to Reus' left hamstring. ""It's sad news, he (Reus) has been playing very consistently for weeks and at a high level,"" said Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel. ""It's an enormous loss which tarnishes the win,"" he added with Dortmund looking to overturn a 1-0 defeat from the first leg at Benfica. Dortmund wasted no time as Ousmane Dembele gave them a sixth minute lead before Aubameyang was left unmarked to head home on 26 minutes. Leverkusen pulled a goal back when Kevin Volland held off Dortmund defender Soktratis Papastathopoulos and drilled his shot inside the near post just after the break. Dembele's cross was headed home by Aubameyang, again at the far post, to put Dortmund 3-1 up on 69 minutes. Brazilian defender Wendell curled a free-kick home to make it 3-2 on 74 minutes before Borussia's US international teenager Christian Pulisic, on for Reus, made it 4-2 on 77 minutes. It turned into a rout when Andre Schuerrle, who replaced Aubameyang, netted a penalty on 85 minutes before Portugal's Raphael Guerreiro smashed home a late sixth as Dortmund consolidated third spot. Fourth-placed Hoffenheim enjoyed a 5-2 thrashing of second-from-bottom Ingolstadt as Hungary striker Adam Szalai netted twice. Bottom side Darmstadt lost 2-0 at Werder Bremen with Germany striker Max Kruse scoring twice in the second-half. Darmstadt coach Torsten Frings had a miserable return to Bremen, who sacked him as assistant trainer in September. Wolfsburg's new head coach Andries Jonker, with Arsenal legend Freddie Ljungberg as his assistant, picked up a point on debut with a 1-1 draw at Mainz. Mario Gomez's goal for Wolfsburg was cancelled out by a first-half equaliser from Mainz's Colombia international Jhon Cordoba."
52,26/01/2017,15:02,Dortmund's Subotic joins Cologne on loan,"Neven Subotic confirmed Thursday he has joined Cologne on loan from Bundesliga rivals Dortmund until the end of the season, as he looks to regain form after injury.","The 28-year-old has been with Dortmund since 2008 and was a key part of the side which won the 2011 and 2012 German league titles. He which lifted the 2012 German Cup after Dortmund's 5-2 win over Bayern Munich in the final, but then lost the 2013 Champions League final against the Bavarians. But Subotic has fallen out of favour with Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, who took over for 2015/16, and having been blighted by injury, his loan deal lasts until June. ""I have a smile on my face and I am really looking forward to the new challenge at a new club,"" said the Serbia international before training with Cologne. ""I am very grateful for the fantastic years at Borussia Dortmund. ""As an ambitious professional, my focus from today on is 100 percent on FC Cologne. ""I want to play in the Bundesliga again and that's what drives me on."" A rib injury, which needed an operation, scuppered Subotic's plans to join Middlesborough before the start of the season at the last minute. He then suffered a knee injury, which restricted him to just two reserve team games for Dortmund this season. Dortmund are currently fourth in the Bundesliga table, Cologne are seventh, and the clubs will meet in Dortmund in June in the league. Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc says Subotic has only been sent on loan ""to get a high level of match practice"" while Borussia's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke says they will welcome him back. ""Neven's degree of identification with Borussia Dortmund is really exceptional in professional football today,"" said Watzke. ""He is a friend for all time, Dortmund remains his home and he will always be welcome back here."""

""(Cologne) is a big club in Germany that is also followed in Japan with great interest. My family is also enjoying life here so I am happy to know that we are staying."" After a bright start to the season Cologne are placed second, two points behind Bayern Munich. Since arriving Osako has scored six goals in 60 matches, two of them this campaign with three assists. Cologne coach Peter Stoeger described Osako as ""an excellent player with a multifaceted skillset"". He highlighted the forward's ""technique, dynamism, and speed""."
54,25/09/2016,19:50,Record-signing Burke nets for unbeaten Leipzig,Scottish teenager Oliver Burke scored his first Bundesliga goal on Sunday as new-boys RB Leipzig drew 1-1 at Cologne to remain unbeaten in Germany's top flight.,"Leipzig are backed by Austrian energy drinks giants Red Bull and are unpopular with fans of Germany's traditional clubs due to the commercialism they represent. For example, the match kicked off 15 minutes late after Cologne fans blocked the Leipzig team bus en route to the stadium. Banners around the Cologne stadium typically read ""Money kills"" and ""Piss Off, RB"". But Leipzig, who won four promotions in seven seasons since being founded in 2009, earned the away draw to stop host Cologne going second. Burke, 19, netted on his first start for Leipzig when the winger drilled home Marcel Sabitzer's pass with five minutes gone. Japan striker Yuya Osako levelled on 25 minutes while Cologne's French striker Anthony Modeste had a second-half goal ruled out for offside. The result leaves Cologne third and Leipzig seventh. Both sides are unbeaten in their first five games. Burke, who has been compared to Wales' star Gareth Bale, cost Leipzig 15 million euros ($16.8m) from Nottingham Forest, to become the most expensive Scottish transfer of all time. He says he does not understand the resentment from German fans towards his new club since arriving in Leipzig in August. ""I read on the internet that the club polarises in Germany,"" he told Germany daily Bild, in an interview before kick-off, having made his debut in RB's shock 1-0 win over Borussia Dortmund. ""Personally, I do not understand it. ""In England, it's quite normal that money is invested in football in order to create something new. ""Our fans and the atmosphere at the home games are fantastic, that's the end what counts. This is simply an outstanding club."" Earlier, Schalke 04's worst start to a Bundesliga season in the club's history was confirmed with a 2-1 loss at Hoffenheim. It was their fifth straight league defeat and piles the pressure on new coach Markus Weinzierl. They are the only club to still have no points in Germany's top flight. Having been recruited from Augsburg while sports director Christian Heidel was poached from Mainz, Weinzierl has endured a disastrous start. ""It's not down to him and I very much hope that all the people involved here support him"", said Schalke's captain, Germany defender Benedikt Hoewedes. ""We need to stand together, as men, and improve."" Werder Bremen's dramatic 2-1 win over Wolfsburg on Saturday had seen Schalke take Bremen's place at the bottom of the table. With Germany coach Joachim Loew watching, Schalke were on course for their first league points of the season after taking a fourth minute lead at Hoffenheim's Rhein Neckar Arena. Swiss striker Breel Embolo -- who cost Schalke 22 million euros ($24.5m) from Basel -- fired in a cross which Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting headed home. But Hoffenheim drew level when Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric, signed from Leicester City, headed them level on 17 minutes. And midfielder Lukas Rupp slotted home what proved to be the winning goal when his shot beat Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehermann on 41 minutes. Hamburg sacked coach Bruno Labbadia on Sunday after their 1-0 defeat to leaders Bayern Munich, their fourth-straight loss which left them 16th. Weinzierl is now the next boss sweating about his future with Schalke two places below in rock bottom. They play their next Europa League group stage match at home to RB Salzburg on Thursday, then face Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach next Sunday at home in the Bundesliga."
55,17/04/2016,17:48,"Dortmund break HSV bogey, Cologne mount comeback",US teenager Christian Pulisic scored his first Bundesliga goal on Sunday as Borussia Dortmund kept some pressure on leaders Bayern Munich with a 3-0 win over 10-man Hamburg.,"Dortmund bounced back from the heart-break of their last-gasp 4-3 defeat at Liverpool on Thursday, which ended their Europa League campaign at the quarter-final stage, with a first win over Hamburg in five league games having last beaten Bruno Labbadia's side back in September 2013. Pulisic only turns 18 in September, but having played his first German league game in January, the left winger made his senior international debut for the USA in March. He has now scored his first Bundesliga goal on only his third start after being promoted from the Under-17 side by head coach Thomas Tuchel in the winter break. Dortmund look to have uncovered another star just as they seem set to lose one. Reports on Sunday in both the German and UK media suggest defensive midfielder Ilkay Gundogan is set to join Manchester City for the start of next season. But Dortmund stayed in the hunt for the German league title as Colombia striker Adrian Ramos scored twice at Signal Iduna Park. Hamburg were reduced to ten men early in the second half when goalkeeper Rene Adler was shown a straight red after bringing down Shinji Kagawa. After a great pass from Dortmund captain Mats Hummels, Pulisic gave Dortmund the lead with a strike which beat Adler at the near post on 38 minutes. ""It's an amazing feeling to get my first goal. Mats put in a great pass to set me up,"" said Pulisic. ""It's hard to put into words what it felt like to score."" Ramos then made it 2-0 when he also put in a superb strike across the face of the Hamburg goal on 44 minutes. Hamburg had Adler sent off on 52 minutes and Ramos added his second on 86 minutes when Japan's Kagawa put in the final pass. Dortmund now have the chance to book their place in the German Cup final when they play Hertha Berlin away in the semi-final on Wednesday. ""We were all very sad (after the Liverpool defeat), but the coach told us we have to go on and now we'll have to wait and see what happens in Berlin,"" added Pulisic. Dortmund's win trims Bayern's lead to seven points with only four games left after Pep Guardiola's side beat Schalke 3-0 at home on Saturday. Poland hot-shot Robert Lewandowski netted twice in Munich to leave him as the league's top scorer with 27 Bundesliga goals this season. Later on Sunday, Cologne came from 2-0 down to pull off a stunning 3-2 win at Mainz. The hosts would have climbed to fifth and closing on a Europa League place for next season after goals by striker Jhon Cordoba and defender Leon Balogun. But Cologne roared back at Mainz's Coface Arena with goals from Marcel Risse and Milos Jojic before French striker Anthony Modeste netted the dramatic winner in the dying stages. The win moves Cologne up to 10th while Mainz remain sixth."
56,19/03/2016,17:53,Lewandowski strikes as Bayern edge out Cologne,Robert Lewandowski's 25th goal of the season gave Bayern Munich a 1-0 win at Cologne on Saturday as the Bundesliga leaders moved eight points clear of Borussia Dortmund once again at the top of the table.,"The Poland star, the Bundesliga's leading scorer, fired home in the 10th minute after Dominique Heintz blocked a Thiago Alcantara pass and the ball fell into his path. That was enough for a Bayern side showing numerous changes from their dramatic midweek Champions League victory over Juventus, with coach Pep Guardiola leaving the likes of Thomas Mueller, Franck Ribery and Philipp Lahm on the bench. While it was not a vintage display by the Bavarian giants, they were rarely troubled by mid-table Cologne, although Anthony Modeste came close to equalising for the hosts a quarter of an hour from the end. Manuel Neuer came out to deny the French forward but could not hold the ball and Modeste got a second bite, only for David Alaba to make a crucial block. Neuer also intervened to deny Leonardo Bittencourt with the last kick of the game at the RheinEnergieStadion. ""It was hard to play two and a half days after a game against Juventus that was mentally draining,"" said Guardiola. ""On the whole we controlled the game well, but we saw once again how difficult it is to defend in the Bundesliga this year."" Second-placed Dortmund will get the chance to reduce the gap back to five points when they go to Augsburg on Sunday, but coach Thomas Tuchel is waiting to see whether Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will be available for the game. Aubameyang, who has scored 35 goals this season including 22 in the Bundesliga, is a doubt following the death of his grandfather. Meanwhile, Hertha Berlin remain on course to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1999/2000 after a 2-1 victory over Ingolstadt in the capital. All the goals came in the second half at the Olympiastadion, with Japanese international winger Genki Haraguchi scoring one goal and making another for Pal Dardai's side. Haraguchi arrived at the near post to turn in a left-wing cross by Marvin Plattenhardt and give Hertha the lead in the 54th minute. He then turned provider on 69 minutes, crossing from the right for Salomon Kalou to net his 13th Bundesliga goal of the campaign at the back post. Substitute Lukas Hinterseer pulled one back for Ingolstadt, but Hertha held on and are once again four points clear of Schalke 04 in third, the final automatic qualifying berth for next season's Champions League. Schalke beat Borussia Moenchengladbach 2-1 on Friday thanks to a late Leon Goretzka winner, while Mainz lost ground after drawing 1-1 at Werder Bremen on Saturday. Julian Baumgartlinger gave Mainz the lead at the Weserstadion but then conceded a penalty in first-half stoppage time when he brought down Zlatko Junuzovic. Veteran Peruvian striker Claudio Pizarro stepped up to score his 12th league goal of the campaign from the spot and ensure a share of the spoils. Wolfsburg, who will face Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals next month, continue to struggle for consistency and needed a last-minute Andre Schuerrle equaliser to grab a 1-1 draw at home to Darmstadt. Looking for a first win in seven games, Darmstadt went ahead through Sandro Wagner's 11th of the season seven minutes from time but Schuerrle denied the visitors as Wolfsburg remain eighth. In the battle to avoid relegation, Hoffenheim claimed a precious 3-1 win at Hamburg to make it four victories from just seven games under 28-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann. Andrej Kramaric, on loan from Leicester City, put Hoffenheim ahead from the penalty spot and Kevin Volland doubled their lead midway through the first half. Aaron Hunt pulled one back for Hamburg with a penalty but Eduardo Vargas came off the bench to make sure of the win for the visitors in the second half.

60,25/02/2016,15:18,High-flying Hertha out to end winless streak,"They might be third in the Bundesliga table, but Hertha Berlin will take a five-match winless streak in Germany's top flight to mid-table Cologne on Friday.","Only Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund are above Pal Dardai's Hertha, but the capital city club has drawn four and lost one of their last five. There is already a 15-point gulf between them and second-placed Dortmund, but although Hertha are on course for direct qualification to the Champions League, both Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Moenchengladbach are just a point behind. Hertha have already collected more points this season (36), than the 35 they achieved in the whole of their previous campaign and have won five of their last six visits to Cologne, who are ninth. ""From the way they have developed, they are almost unrecognisable from the end of last season,"" said Cologne's coach Peter Stoeger -- Hertha finished 15th last season, just a point from relegation. A first appearance in the Champions League since 2000 is on the cards. Part of Hertha's success is down to the partnership forged by Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou and Vedad Ibisevic, who have bagged 17 league goals between them. In contrast, Cologne are relying solely on the 10-goal tally of the aptly-named French striker Anthony Modeste. ""They have two boys up front in Kalou and Ibisevic, who can practically guarantee goals,"" added Stoeger. ""Hertha have managed to put together a good run of results this season, which we haven't managed to do. ""We must not give them space, because they can recognise situations very quickly and exploit them."" Last September, Ibisevic scored twice in Hertha's 2-0 win over Cologne in Berlin. One of the factors behind Hertha's league success, and run to their first German Cup semi-final in 35 years, has been the silky crossing of right-back Mitchell Weiser. The 21-year-old has been a first-team regular since his transfer from Bayern Munich at the end of last season and has pitched in with five assists in the league. Having come up through Cologne's academy, Weiser is looking forward to his return to the Rhein Energie Stadion. He still holds the record -- 17 years, ten months and three days set in 2012 -- for the youngest player to represent Cologne in the Bundesliga. ""I'm really looking forward to playing there again. I played my first Bundesliga match there and it is a special place for me,"" said Weiser. Having failed to hold down a regular spot under Pep Guardiola at Bayern, Weiser has thrived at Hertha. When a fight with midfielder Anis Ben-Hatira on Hertha's team bus coming back from a game left Weiser with a black eye last month, it was Ben-Hatira who was transferred to Eintracht Frankfurt."

Since that Champions League group game, Bayern have won all five of their home games in all competitions without conceding a single goal and hold an eight-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Guardiola's team are in no mood to give Darmstadt any hope of a first win in Munich in their final match before their Champions League last 16, first-leg clash at Juventus next Tuesday. Especially as Darmstadt have picked up 17 of their 24 points this season away from home. ""They will play very deep and very compact,"" said Bayern midfielder Xabi Alonso. ""We will have to be patient and it'll be important to get the first goal. ""It's all about Darmstadt for now, we want to keep our eight-point lead. Only afterwards will we think about Juventus."" With 21 goals to his credit, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski has scored almost as many goals as the 22 the entire Darmstadt team has managed. The visitors' cause is not helped by a raft of suspensions. Peter Niemeyer, Jerome Gondorf, Aytac Sulu, Marcel Heller and Konstantin Rausch are all banned after each picked up yellow cards in last Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Bayer Leverkusen. ""We have registered that. However, I believe that no one wants to miss this chance to play in front of an audience of millions,"" said Darmstadt coach Dirk Schuster confidently. Guardiola hopes to have centre-backs Medhi Benatia and Serdar Tasci fit as he was unable to play a single central defender in last weekend's win at Augsburg after Holger Badstuber fractured an ankle. Dortmund will be looking to make it nine games undefeated at Leverkusen on Sunday. Thomas Tuchel's Dortmund are in impressive form as last Saturday's 1-0 win over bottom side Hanover 96 left them 13 points clear of third-placed Bayer. Having sat out the Hanover win, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will be looking to add to his 20 goals in as many league games to rival Lewandowski. The last time Leverkusen beat Dortmund at the BayArena was in May 2007, but Roger Schmidt's men have picked up 14 of a possible 18 points and are undefeated in their last six games. Leverkusen will again be without striker Javier Hernandez after the Mexican tore a buttock muscle in their German Cup defeat to Werder Bremen 10 days ago. Cologne fans plan a protest before kick-off of Saturday's match at Borussia Moenchengladbach over the restricted number of away fans allowed. Gladbach will be without centre-back Martin Stranzl, who tore his right calf in training on Wednesday as they look to bounce back from Sunday's shock defeat to Hamburg. Fresh from their Champions League last 16, first-leg win at Gent, Wolfsburg are at Hertha Berlin on Saturday without defender Sebastian Jung. The right-back tore the cruciate ligament in his left knee in Belgium and is expected to miss the rest of the season after limping out of Wolfsburg's 3-2 victory.

On Wednesday, Bayern denied allegations midfielder Arturo Vidal was repeatedly drunk at last month's training camp in Doha. Both the club and player say they will sue magazine Sport Bild over the claim. Vidal started against Leverkusen with Germany forward Thomas Mueller left on the bench as Guardiola played a back three after injuries left him with only one fit centre-back in Holger Badstuber.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the Bundesliga's top-scorer, also failed to score in Borussia Dortmund's uninspiring goalless draw at Hertha Berlin, with Jose Mourinho watching. Aubameyang, who has netted 20 league goals, had a rare off day in Berlin, managing just 11 touches in his 71 minutes and failed to produce a single shot on goal. The Gabon forward -- Africa's player of the year -- was eventually hauled off by Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel and left to scowl on the bench. It was only the sixth time this season 'Auba' has failed to score in one of Dortmund's league games.

But Dieter Hecking's side have now lost two and drawn two in their last four games since knocking United out of the Champions League with a 3-2 win last December. Wolfsburg's luck deserted them again at their Volkswagen Arena as they threw away a second-half lead. The hosts went ahead when right-winger Vieirinha fired in a cross, which found Julian Draxler unmarked for the Germany international to fire home on 67 minutes. But Cologne equalised eight minutes later when Leonardo Bittencourt's pass put Anthony Modeste into space. The Frenchman then unleashed a superb curling shot which beat Wolves 'keeper Diego Benaglio. The result leaves Wolfsburg seventh -- outside the European places for next season -- and Cologne ninth. Bayern Munich host Hoffenheim later on Sunday, without Javi Martinez who is their latest star to pick up an injury. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund moved within five points of the Bavarians with a 2-0 win over Ingolstadt as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice to leave him with 20 league goals in 19 games. Dortmund could consider themselves fortunate though as captain Mats Hummels escaped a red card for a foul in the area, then scored a second-half own-goal, which the referee refused to award to Ingolstadt after a foul in the build-up. The result stretched Dortmund's lead over third-placed Hertha Berlin to 10 points. Hertha threw away a 2-0 lead as hosts Werder Bremen roared back with three goals in ten second-half minutes to claim a point in a 3-3 draw. Ivory Coast veteran Salomon Kalou struck Berlin's third goal to leave Hertha 3-1 up in Bremen with 20 minutes left. Then Bremen veteran Claudio Pizarro netted a penalty before defender Santiago Garcia fired in a shot which was later credited to Pizarro, who nudged the ball over the line to level the scores. Bayer Leverkusen climbed to fourth with a 3-0 win at Hanover 96, who dropped to the bottom, with Javier Hernandez scoring twice in the romp. 'Chicharito' converted a penalty, then drilled home his 13th league goal in 16 matches. He has now scored 21 times in all competitions this season since joining from Manchester United. Schalke have youth to thank for their 2-0 win at Darmstadt as dynamic midfielders Max Meyer and Leroy Sane, who are both 20, scored either side of half-time. The win left the Royal Blues fifth in the table and relieves some of the pressure on coach Andre Breitenreiter after last Sunday's shock home defeat against Bremen. Schalke and Leverkusen's wins meant Borussia Moenchengladbach slid from fourth to sixth after Friday's 1-0 defeat to mid-table Mainz. Mid-table sides Augsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt fought out a goalless draw in Bavaria.

The Germans still have every chance of qualifying for the knock-out stages and consolidated third in the German league table by hammering Bremen. There was a minute's silence at all Bundesliga grounds this weekend -- the players also wore black armbands -- out of respect for the victims of the Paris terror attacks. Stuttgart's 4-0 thumping at home to Augsburg was delayed by 15 minutes due to the tightened security checks at stadiums across the country. There were no such problems at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena as Bremen gifted their hosts the opener when defender Alejandro Galvez slid the ball into his own net on 11 minutes. Kruse put Wolfsburg 2-0 up at the break by heading home a free-kick then Portugal international Vierinha scored from the right wing on 56 minutes. The floodgates opened when French defensive midfielder, on for the injured Brazil star Luiz Gustavo, stabbed home his shot on 67 minutes. Kruse then set up Netherlands striker Bas Dost on 78 minutes before completing the scoring three minutes from time by converting a cross from Germany team-mate Andre Schuerrle to leave him with five league goals for the season. The result leaves Wolfsburg five points behind second-placed Borussia Dortmund who lost 3-1 at Hamburg on Friday night, while leaders Bayern Munich play at Schalke on Saturday evening. Ex-Manchester United star Javier Hernandez now has 12 goals for Bayer Leverkusen in all competitions after scoring twice in their 3-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Christmas came early for 'Chicharito' in Frankfurt when Eintracht centre-back David Abraham allowed a cross to roll between his legs and the grateful Hernandez stabbed home on 11 minutes. The Mexico striker doubled his tally on 39 minutes when a Hakan Calhanoglu pass split the Frankfurt defence. Hernandez did the rest, but it finished 2-1 at the break when Serbian midfielder Slobodan Medojevic slammed in a powerful header on the stroke of half-time. Calhanoglu made sure of the three points by scoring Leverkusen's third on 72 minutes. Augsburg climbed off the bottom of the table with an emphatic 4-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. Woeful defending by the hosts allowed Augsburg to race into an early 2-0 lead with both goals by midfielder Alexander Esswein. Defender Jan-Ingwer Callsen-Bracker grabbed a third before former South Korea captain Koo Ja-Cheol scored Augsburg's fourth when he hit the top right-hand corner from 10 metres out on 54 minutes.

""Right now, in these difficult times, we are unbroken in following our destiny and with each new game we will bring thousands of people together, so they can share their enthusiasm, joy and passion for football. ""This is our contribution to a peaceful world."" The emotive words show how badly the Bundesliga has been shaken by recent events after Tuesday's international was called off just two hours before kick-off and the stadium was evacuated. It came less just four days after the German team spent Friday night in the Stade de France stadium as their international friendly took place during a night of terror attacks across Paris which claimed the lives of at least 129 people. In a statement, Hamburg said they are ""shocked and saddened because of the barbaric attacks in Paris. ""Innocent people have know untold suffering in recent days. ""Our deepest sympathy goes to the families of the victims."" On Wednesday morning, Hanover 96 called off a training session in preparation for Saturday's match at Borussia Moenchengladbach, due to the previous night's bomb scare, ""for logistical reasons"", but an afternoon session was expected to take place. Cologne have also announced they will be stepping up security for Saturday's game against Mainz. ""The visible presence of law enforcement officers will increase,"" said the club in a statement, without going into detail. But the Cologne coach insists it's business as usual. ""We're planning the week as normal,"" said Cologne's Peter Stoeger. ""When I stand on the training ground, I just do my job as if we were playing football, we are 100 precent athletes. ""If you read the news and have a quiet moment, you think a little about what is going on."" The bomb scare in Hanover meant a German international was called off for only the third time after fear of rioting in Berlin in 1994 saw a Germany-England match cancelled. A match game against Chile was also cancelled in November 2009 following the suicide of Germany goalkeeper Robert Enke."

Pep Guardiola's side became the first team to record 1000 Bundesliga victories as Netherlands captain Robben scored in his first match since August while Arturo Vidal, Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet. The Bavarian giants bounced back from the disappointment of Tuesday's 2-0 defeat at Arsenal in the Champions League -- their first loss of the season -- in emphatic style. ""This is for all the coaches, fans, players and employees who made this victory possible,"" said Guardiola, whose side fired in 26 shots to Cologne's four. ""1000 victories is outstanding."" Having been named in the starting line-up after a groin injury, Robben netted after 35 minutes before Vidal doubled their lead five minutes later when he converted Kingsley Coman's superb pass from the flank. ""I'm pleased for him,"" said Guardiola. ""We have missed his quality. Arjen has a professionalism, a charisma and a mentality, especially in the one-on-ones. ""He still needs more time, but no one has his nose for goal."" Poland striker Lewandowski cemented his place as the league's top scorer when he headed home on 62 minutes for his 13th goal in nine league games this season. Mueller made it 4-0 on 77 minutes when he converted a penalty after Lewandowski was fouled in the area. Wolfsburg stayed fourth with a 1-0 win at Darmstadt as Daniel Caligiuri hit their 78th minute winner.

After Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake fired in a cross, Andreasen steered the ball home at the far post on 38 minutes with the help of his upper arm, despite furious protests from the Cologne defence. ""I offered to lend my glasses to the linesman, but he didn't see it either,"" fumed Cologne coach Peter Stoeger after referee Bastian Dankert missed the handball. Hanover goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler pulled off a great save to deny Cologne's French striker Anthony Modeste in the dying stages to rescue the win which left his team 14th in the table. Hanover are now unbeaten in their last three games, which followed five straight defeats, while Cologne drop to sixth in the table. Stuttgart shot up from 18th to 15th thanks to Daniel Didavi's second-half winner which sealed their 1-0 victory at home to Ingolstadt, but replays showed he was in an offside position. Stuttgart were without Serey Die for the last ten minutes after the Ivory Coast defensive midfielder was shown a second yellow card. Ingolstadt's Australia striker Mathew Leckie had his early penalty attempt saved by the feet of Stuttgart goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton. On Saturday, Bayern Munich became the first team to win their opening nine Bundesliga games as Thomas Mueller's first-half strike gave Pep Guardiola's side a 1-0 win at Werder Bremen. Mueller stole in front of Alejandro Galvez to control a Thiago Alcantara cross at the near post for his ninth of the season at the Weserstadion as Bayern made more Bundesliga history. Mueller's solitary strike condemned Bremen to a club record-equalling fifth consecutive league defeat. Bayern's 999th Bundesliga win sets them up for their trip to face Arsenal in the Champions League on Tuesday. It left the Bavarians seven points clear at the top of the table from nearest challengers Borussia Dortmund, who won 2-0 at Mainz on Friday. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel returned to face his former club in Mainz and saw Marco Reus put the visitors in front in the first half before Henrikh Mkhitaryan added a second. Germany striker Max Kruse scored his first career hat-trick as Wolfsburg climbed up to fourth with a dramatic 4-2 win at home to Hoffenheim at the Volkswagen Arena. Wolfsburg opened the scoring after just 41 seconds when Julian Draxler squared for Kruse to score his first goal since signing from Borussia Moenchengladbach in the summer. Schalke 04 are third, just a point behind their Ruhr rivals Dortmund, after Max Meyer struck a stoppage-time winner to see off Hertha Berlin 2-1. Benedikt Hoewedes had earlier headed the Royal Blues in front but Salomon Kalou's 73rd-minute header looked set to earn Hertha a share of the spoils. Gladbach continued their revival since Andre Schubert replaced Lucien Favre in the dugout as they romped to a 5-1 win away to Eintracht Frankfurt. Bayer Leverkusen were held to a 0-0 draw at Hamburg and promoted Darmstadt's good start to life in the top flight continued with a 2-0 victory at Augsburg. Sandro Wagner and Peter Niemeyer both netted in the first half as Darmstadt climbed into the top half of the table and left Augsburg, who are in this season's Europa League, bottom of the table."
69,04/10/2015,17:48,Cologne stun hapless Schalke,Third-placed Schalke crashed to their first defeat in seven games on Sunday as they were stunned 3-0 at home to Cologne.,"With leaders Bayern Munich hosting second-placed Borussia Dortmund later, Schalke missed their chance to climb one place in the table as they were soundly beaten by Cologne, a surprise package this season, who are now fifth. Schalke had been flying high after four Bundesliga wins and two Europa League victories before Sunday's kick-off. Cologne's French striker Anthony Modeste claimed his sixth goal in eight games when he netted a Leonardo Bittencourt pass on the stroke of half-time at Schalke before the guests ran riot in the final ten minutes. Cologne doubled their lead at Gelsenkirchen's Veltins Arena when defensive midfielder Yannick Gerhardt slotted home after beating three defenders to make a mockery of the home back four, on 79 minutes. To compound Schalke's misery, substitute Simon Voller drilled his shot into the bottom right-hand corner, just a minute after coming on, to wrap up the three points on 84 minutes. On Saturday, Borussia Moenchengladbach continued their rise up the table as they bounced back from their midweek Champions League defeat against Manchester City with a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg. Norway midfielder Haavard Nordtvelt and French-born Guinean winger Ibrahima Traore did the damage to leave Gladbach now 13th and four points above the relegation places, having been bottom a fortnight ago, while Wolfsburg dropped to ninth. It was their third straight league match under caretaker coach Andre Schubert after Lucien Favre's sudden resignation. Hertha Berlin's impressive season continued as they climbed to fourth with a 3-0 win over Hamburg in the capital as Salomon Kalou gave the hosts a first-half lead, then Vedad Ibisevic netted twice in as many minutes. Hoffenheim and VfB Stuttgart remain in the bottom four after their 2-2 draw. Germany international winger Kevin Volland scored both goals for hosts Hoffenheim while bottom side Stuttgart rescued a point as Pirmin Schwegler scored a 90th-minute equaliser. Hanover won their first match of the season as they defeated Werder Bremen 1-0 thanks to the only goal on 56 minutes through French-born Senegalese international Salif Sane. Bavaria's Ingolstadt, who are in their debut Bundesliga season, defeated Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0 with late goals from Pascal Gross and Stefan Lex to take sixth spot. On Friday, Mainz evened their record at four wins and four defeats in a thrilling 3-2 victory at promoted Darmstadt. Mainz are in touch of the top six while Darmstadt suffered only their second defeat of the eight-game season and lie 10th."
70,16/09/2015,14:44,Hot-shot Modeste hoping for France call-up,Cologne striker Anthony Modeste is hoping his purple patch leads to a call up to wear the blue jersey of France after scoring six goals in five matches this season.,"The 27-year-old has had a great start to the German league season since switching from Hoffenheim and is hoping his form will attract the attention of France coach Didier Deschamps. ""I want to take my chance in Cologne to show everyone what I'm capable of,"" Modeste told German magazine Sport Bild after winning 14 caps for France Under-21, but is waiting for his senior debut. ""If you're successful and your club is doing well, you attract attention and in Cologne the media presence is greater than at Hoffenheim."" After scoring 23 goals in two seasons at Hoffenheim, the former Bordeaux forward has hit the ground running this season with France to host Euro 2016 next June. Modeste has scored three goals, plus two assists, in four domestic matches and bagged himself a hat-trick in Cologne's 4-0 win over minnows Meppen in the German Cup first round. He even managed to get on the scoresheet in Cologne's 6-2 drubbing at the hands of Eintracht Frankfurt last weekend which left them eighth in the league table. Modeste has a good chance to add to his tally when Cologne host bottom side Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday with Lucien Favre's side having suffered four straight league defeats."
71,24/05/2015,16:06,Cologne's Ujah apolgises for Bremen blunder,Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah has apologised to Cologne fans on his tearful farewell having previously been photographed with his future club Werder Bremen.,"The 24-year-old Super Eagles forward was booed and whistled by home fans after being substituted in the second-half of Cologne's 2-2 draw with Wolfsburg on Saturday in his final appearance for the Rhineland club before joining Bremen next season. But the Nigeria international fell offside with Cologne's bosses and fans alike after being photographed with his future club three weeks ago under the caption: ""100 percent Werder"". It did not go down well with Cologne, particularly as their survival in Germany's top flight was not confirmed at the time. ""The fact my own fans whistled and booed me really got to me,"" admitted a tearful Ujah, who has scored 10 goals for Cologne this season. ""I apologise for how things turned out, that wasn't good,"" he added referring to the Bremen picture. Cologne's vice-president Toni Schumacher, sporting director Joerg Schmadtke and coach Peter Stoeger had all criticised Ujah publically, but the loud whistles when he was substituted after 48 minutes against Wolves clearly had an affect. ""He had tears in his eyes, and they weren't put on,"" said Cologne defender Dominic Maroh. ""He knows himself that his farewell could have gone better, but we will miss him."""
72,10/05/2015,19:37,Wolfsburg win seals Champions League berth,Dutch striker Bas Dost scored twice as VfL Wolfsburg secured a Champions League berth following a six-year absence with a 3-1 win over relegation-threatened Paderborn on Sunday.,"Dost's double leaves him with 19 goals in all competitions as Wolfsburg went back up to second with just two games left. Wolves picked up their first win in four league games when Swiss defender Timm Klose headed home on 16 minutes before Dost netted nine minutes later by meeting Ivan Perisic's cross at the near post. The 25-year-old showed his predatory skills by pouncing on a parried save eight minutes from time to slot home his second. Paderborn pulled a goal back when midfielder Lukas Rupp hit the top right-hand corner with a speculative shot on the edge of the area just before the whistle. The defeat keeps Paderborn 17th, but with all still to play for as just two points separate the bottom five teams of Hamburg, Freiburg, Hanover 96, Paderborn and bottom side VfB Stuttgart with two games left. Schalke dropped to sixth after their 2-0 defeat at Cologne means Robert di Matteo's side has won just one of their last eight league games and in danger of dropping out of the European places for next season. Schalke are just two points ahead of neighbours Dortmund, who are making a late bid for a Europa League spot after starting February last in the table. Goals by midfielders Marcel Risse and Yannick Gerdhardt confirmed Cologne's survival in the top flight. On Saturday, ten-man Bayern Munich suffered a morale-sapping fourth straight defeat by losing 1-0 to Augsburg ahead of Tuesday's Champions League semi-final, return leg against Barcelona. Augsburg's Paraguay striker Raul Bobadilla followed on from Barcelona's Lionel Messi by inflicting more misery on the Bundesliga champions. Bayern host Barca facing an uphill task having been routed 3-0 in Spain, when Messi scored twice, which followed defeats to Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup semi-final and a league defeat at Bayer Leverkusen. Bayern played nearly 80 minutes with ten men after reserve goalkeeper Pepe Reina was shown a straight red card with just 13 minutes gone. Dutch defender Paul Verhaegh hit the post with the resulting spot-kick. But Augsburg grabbed the winner when Danish midfielder Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg, on loan from Bayern, put in a cross which Bobadilla deftly back-heeled on 71 minutes. Borussia Moenchengladbach are virtually sure of joining Wolfsburg and Bayern directly in the Champions League next season after their 3-0 win over fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen. Germany striker Max Kruse, who will play for Wolfsburg next season, Patrick Herrmann and Guinea forward Ibrahima Traore scored Gladbach's goals. Borussia Dortmund enjoyed a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin as goals by defenders Neven Subotic and Erik Durm lifted Dortmund to seventh. Hanover remain third from bottom after their 1-1 draw at home to Werder Bremen while Stuttgart stayed at the foot of the table despite their 2-0 win over Mainz. Mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt enjoyed a 3-1 win over Hoffenheim while Hamburg stayed above the relegation places with a 1-1 draw at home to Freiburg on Friday thanks to Gojko Kacar's 90th-minute equaliser."
73,05/05/2015,14:10,Nigeria's Ujah joins Bremen from Cologne,"Werder Bremen have signed Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah from Cologne for next season, both clubs confirmed on Tuesday.","The 24-year-old Ujah has been given a four-year contract for an undisclosed transfer fee having actioned a release clause in his current contract after he passed a medical check in the last few days. Having scored 10 goals for Cologne this season, Ujah will replace Bremen's Under-20 striker Davie Selke, who has signed for second-division RB Leipzig for next season. ""We have been watching him very intensely for a very long time and have built up a full picture of him,"" said Werder's director of sport Thomas Eichin. ""He is a fast and prolific striker who can continue to develop with us."" The Nigeria international joined Cologne from Mainz on loan in 2012 and the move was made permanent for the 2013/14 season as he became a fans' favourite and has so far made 62 Bundesliga appearances for the Rhineland club, scoring 24 goals."
74,12/04/2015,17:47,"Ujah, Hector seals Cologne's win over Hoffenheim",Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah netted his tenth goal of the season and Germany's Jonas Hector produced some individual brilliance on Sunday to seal 10-men Cologne's 3-2 win over Hoffenheim.,"Mid-table Cologne are now six points away from the relegation places after Ujah calmy converted Japan international Yuya Osako's defence-splitting pass on 54 minutes after Matthias Lehmann had converted Cologne's first-half penalty. Cologne were reduced to ten men when Pawel Olkowski was shown a straight red for hauling down Hoffenheim striker Anthony Modeste, who was through on goal, and Eugen Polanski drilled home Hoffenheim's resulting penalty on 70 minutes. Hector settled the tie with a superb individual goal after dribbling around four defenders on 78 minutes before Modeste scored Hoffenheim's second with a late header. On Saturday, Robert Lewandowski scored twice as injury-hit Bayern Munich romped to a 3-0 league win over Eintracht Frankfurt ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final at Porto. Despite having only four fit players on the bench, Bayern dominated at Munich's Allianz Arena and are three wins from claiming a third straight German league title. Lewandowski, the Bundesliga's top-scorer last season, now has 16 goals for the season and is third in the current rankings. Frankfurt were missing the league's top scorer with Alexander Meier, who has 19 goals in 26 matches, suffering from a knee injury. Centre-back Medhi Benatia, who has a groin injury, joined flu-victim Bastian Schweinsteiger, plus Jerome Boateng, wingers Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben and left-back David Alaba on Bayern's casualty list. Despite their woes, Bayern needed 15 minutes to take the lead when Lewandowski produced a superb turn and volley, then headed home, with suspicion of offside, on 66 minutes. Thomas Mueller added the third eight minutes from time when he fired home from a seemingly-impossible angle. Second-placed Wolfsburg remain ten points behind Bayern and on course for the Champions League next season after their 2-0 win at 10-men Hamburg. Goals either side of half-time by defensive midfielder Josuha Guilavogui and right winger Daniel Caligiuri sealed Wolves' win. Hamburg had Swiss defender Johan Djourou, who brawled with team-mate Valon Behrami in the dressing room at half-time, sent off for a second yellow card in the dying stages. Borussia Moenchengladbach picked up their fourth straight league win with an impressive 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund to stay third in the table. Tenth-placed Dortmund went behind after just 29 seconds as Patrick Herrmann's shot was blocked by Borussia's Roman Weidenfeller, but Sweden left-back Oscar Wendt slammed home the parry. Brazilian forward Raffael addded their second on 32 minutes before Norway's Havard Nordveit fired home when left unmarked at the far post with 67 minutes gone before Ilkay Gundogan pulled a late goal back for Dortmund. Bayer Leverkusen enjoyed a 3-2 win over Mainz, 24 hours before sacking Bosnia international Emir Spahic, who is being investigated by police for allegedly assaulting a club steward. South Korea striker Son Heung-Min opened the scoring with 15 minutes gone and Stefan Kiessling added a second early in the second-half. Dead-ball specialist Hakan Calhanoglu added their third when he drilled home a 73rd-minute free-kick, but Mainz pulled a goal back when South Korea international Koo Ja-Cheol converted two late penalties. The win leaves Leverkusen fourth in the battle for one of the Bundesliga's three automatic Champions League places for next season. Fifth-placed Schalke are now 10 points adrift of a Champions League place for next season after their goalless draw with relegation-threatened Freiburg. Augsburg stay sixth despite their shock 2-1 defeat at Paderborn, who remain in the relegation places."
75,22/03/2015,16:32,Cologne defender to join Spurs: reports,"Cologne defender Kevin Wimmers is set to join Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur in a transfer worth six million euros (US$6.5m), according to reports in the German media on Sunday.","The 22-year-old centre-back is set to sign a four-year contract to join the the North London club at the end of the season, according to German daily Bild and magazine Kicker. The Austrian international, who has made one appearance for his country, has a contract until June 2019, but Kicker has reported he will leave Cologne at the end of the season and he visited London at the end of January to secure the transfer, according to Kicker. ""He will play for us until the summer and then we'll see what happens after that,"" said Cologne's director of sport Joerg Schmadtke with his side 12th in the German league table."
76,28/02/2015,16:15,Ujah 'cherishes' scoring against Bayern's Neuer,"Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah says he will cherish scoring past Bayern Munich's Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer ""for the rest of his life"".","Ujah out-jumped the Bayern defence to head past Neuer on the stroke of half-time to put Cologne back in the game at 2-1 down before ultimately losing 4-1 to the Bundesliga leaders on Friday. It was his eighth Bundesliga goal this season and his 32nd in the Cologne shirt since joining from Mainz in 2012. But scoring past Neuer, the world goalkeeper of 2014, was a moment the Nigeria international will never forget. ""It's a great feeling. Scoring against Manuel Neuer is something any striker would be proud of at the moment,"" said the 24-year-old Ujah. ""It was a really, really, really proud moment that I will cherish for the rest of my life."" Only a stunning save from Neuer denied Ujah a second goal in the second-half which underlined the Germany star's status as the world's best. ""It just shows why he is the number one and why he is at the level he is right now,"" said Ujah with Cologne winless in their last five games. ""I thought it was almost in, but he showed why he's the best. ""I should be proud of being there at the right moment because that's one of the things I'm trying to work on improving. ""I know it didn't go in, but it's something I can build on and I hope will give me confidence to continue helping my team to stay in the league."" The defeat leaves Cologne 13th in the Bundesliga just a few points from the bottom three, but Ujah says he is ready for the relegation battle. ""We still have some big teams to play against like Schalke and Wolfsburg,"" he said. ""We know how tight it is, but the mood isn't too low after losing to Bayern, so we have to keep our heads up and continue fighting."""
77,27/02/2015,23:06,Robben adds to tally in Bayern's birthday win,Bayern Munich celebrated their 115th birthday Friday with a 4-1 win over Cologne to go 11 points clear in the Bundesliga as top-scorer Arjen Robben added to his tally.,"The fleet-footed Dutchman netted his 17th goal in 19 league matches this season with a crisp header with 20 minutes left to remain the league's top scorer. Captain Bastian Schweinsteiger gave hosts Bayern an early lead at Munich's Allianz Arena before Franck Ribery added a second inside 10 minutes. Cologne fought back when Nigeria international Anthony Ujah scored right on the stroke of half-time but Bayern roared back as Robben, then Poland striker Robert Lewandowski extended the hosts' lead. But Robben was unimpressed with Bayern's performance having briefly given Cologne hope. ""It was a strange game,"" said the Dutchman. ""We went 2-0 up, were aggressive and played well, but we slowed down at the end of the first-half and conceded the goal at the worst possible time."" Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge insists Bayern are in their most stable era in their rich history and Pep Guardiola's side are running away with a third straight league title having now opened an 11-point lead. In just their last four league games, Bayern have now scored 20 goals with Ujah's header the only blot on their copybook. Cologne coach Peter Stoeger had said his side needed ""a miracle"" in Munich and Bayern wasted no time in taking the lead. They forced four corners in the opening 142 seconds, the last of which Schweinsteiger headed home after just three minutes. In a perfect bit of symmetry, the goal came after two minutes, 22 seconds into Bayern's 333rd Bundesliga match. Ribery added a second with ten minutes gone when he dribbled through a weak Cologne defence and slotted his shot past goalkeeper Timo Horn. A brief glimpse of the miracle Stoeger craved arrived just before the half-time break. Ujah rose highest from a corner to out-jump Philipp Lahm and with David Alaba out of position the Nigeria striker headed home right on the whistle. It was the first Bundesliga goal Bayern had conceded since drawing 1-1 with Schalke at the start of the month and it gave Cologne confidence. Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was forced to prove why he was voted the world's best goalkeeper in 2014 with super saves to deny Ujah and Cologne midfielder Marcel Risse. ""Manuel saved us a few times,"" admitted Robben. ""Some of the saves he pulled off were simply superb."" Bayern snuffed out any hope of a Cologne fightback when Ribery whipped in a cross for Robben to head home on 67 minutes. Robben proved he can set up goals just as well as score them when he produced a superb pass for Lewandowski to chest over the line with 15 minutes left. Bayern are in action again on Wednesday when they host second division Eintracht Braunschweig in the last 16 of the German Cup. They host Shakhtar Donetsk on March 11 in the Champions League's last 16, second-leg after a goalless draw in Ukraine."
78,26/02/2015,02:18,Cologne look for a miracle at Bayern,Cologne's Peter Stoeger admits they may need a miracle at Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich on Friday with the Bavarian giants scoring 16 goals without reply in recent league games.,"Bayern have not conceded a goal in any of their last three league matches, their 8-0 hammering of Hamburg and last Saturday's 6-0 pounding of Paderborn leaving Pep Guardiola's side eight points clear. With second-placed Wolfsburg at resurgent Werder Bremen on Sunday, with both sides unbeaten in their first five games of 2015, Bayern could well extend their lead unless mid-table Cologne pull off a shock. That will involve Stoeger's side stopping Bayern's star-studded attack, including fleet-footed Dutch winger Arjen Robben who is the Bundesliga's top scorer with 16 goals in 18 matches. ""But every couple of years there is a miracle,"" Stoeger told Cologne-based newspaper Express. ""We've already see a few different attempts (to beat Bayern) which didn't work. ""They take every chance they get and if that works too against us, it's hard to survive. ""Our task is to make sure the game is no fun for them. ""It'll take a lot of effort and (Cologne goalkeeper Timo) Horn will need to be in the top form of the last few weeks."" The stats are actually in Cologne's favour. They are the second best away team in the league behind Bayern with five wins from 11 games on the road and of their last six games in Munich, they have lost only the last when they were beaten 3-0 at the Allianz Arena in December 2011. The big match on Saturday is the Ruhr Valley derby with resurgent Borussia Dortmund hosting fellow Champions League side Schalke 04 at the Westfalenstadion. Dortmund's Gabon winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang says winning Germany's top derby is similar to an orgasm. ""I love games like this. Derby wins - even if it sounds strange - are almost like an orgasm. In all honesty, it is a similar feeling,"" the speedy winger told magazine Sport Bild. Schalke are set to welcome back Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar from suspension while Dortmund are chasing revenge for their 2-1 defeat in Gelsenkirchen last September. Dortmund are set to be without left-back Lukasz Piszczek and centre-back Papastathopoulos Sokratis after the pair picked up injuries in Tuesday's 2-1 defeat at Juventus in the Champions League last 16, first-leg clash. There is a fascinating game on Sunday as Bremen host Wolfsburg with Dutch striker Bas Dost having scored nine goals in his last three games in all competitions after netting four times alone in the 5-4 league win over Bayer Leverkusen. Bremen followed up five straight wins with a 1-1 draw at Schalke last weekend which has taken them from the bottom of the relegation battle to the verge of a European place. Wolves have won their last four games with Belgium winger Kevin de Bruyne forging a fruitful partnership with Dost, which has already produced 19 goals. Fixtures (All times 1430 GMT unless stated)"

81,19/08/2014,02:05,Germany riding crest of wave as Bundesliga begins,The new Bundesliga season gets underway this weekend with German football riding the crest of a wave following the national team's triumph at the World Cup in Brazil last month.,"That thoroughly deserved victory, given to Joachim Loew's side by Mario Goetze's extra-time strike in the final against Argentina, saw a unified Germany crowned as world champions for the first time. But at club level, the Bundesliga has been leading the way for some time. It averaged 3.16 goals per game last season, considerably more than any of its major European counterparts, while average gates were over 42,000, making the German top flight the best attended league anywhere. ""In my opinion, the Bundesliga's the most attractive league in the world,"" Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Lucien Favre told bundesliga.com. ""The hype in Germany is amazing, and now they've won the World Cup so it's not going to tail off in a rush."" Nevertheless, the biggest problem facing the Bundesliga, as ever, is how to counter the dominance of Bayern Munich, who have romped to the title and added the German Cup in each of the last two campaigns. They have seen Toni Kroos and Mario Mandzukic depart and lost Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in last week's SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, but the Bavarians remain favourites. And yet the rest can draw some hope from the very fact this is a Bundesliga season immediately following a World Cup, and that has not tended to help Bayern in the recent past. After Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup, Stuttgart went on to win the Bundesliga, while in 2011 Dortmund pipped Bayern to the title. In 2009, after Germany reached the Euro 2008 final, it was Wolfsburg who were champions. Six members of Pep Guardiola's squad played in the World Cup final, including Goetze, while Dante and Arjen Robben were also involved until the latter stages in Brazil. That is why chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wanted the start of the new season delayed in order to give these players longer to prepare, but that request was unsurprisingly turned down by Bayern's rivals. ""We have to face the fact that the first half of the season will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, who at times had only a skeleton squad in pre-season training. ""We are at least one month behind schedule."" Guardiola has added to his squad with compatriots Juan Bernat from Valencia and Pepe Reina, who will provide competition in goal for Manuel Neuer. But the marquee signing was Robert Lewandowski, a prolific goalscorer for Dortmund in the last four years. However, Dortmund have moved to replace the Pole by signing Italy striker Ciro Immobile from Torino and Colombia's Adrian Ramos from Hertha Berlin. Stability is key at the Signal Iduna Park, where coach Jurgen Klopp, who led Dortmund to back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012 and a Champions League final defeat to Bayern in 2013, is entering his seventh season in charge. ""We want to establish ourselves further at the top of the league and qualify directly for the Champions League,"" said sporting director Michael Zorc modestly. However, Guardiola knows where the danger lies, saying: ""We may have won the last two league titles, but they clinched the previous two. Our great challenge is to keep up our level to keep them at distance."" Beneath them, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg will again be hoping to contend for Champions League qualification at least. Schalke have kept Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Julian Draxler, while Sidney Sam has joined from Leverkusen, and few teams can boast a midfield as strong as Wolfsburg, with Kevin de Bruyne, Luiz Gustavo and France's Josuha Guilavogui. Bayer have signed Swiss striker Josip Drmic from Nuremberg and have a new coach in Roger Schmidt, back in his native country after winning the Austrian title with Salzburg. Hamburg will be hoping for a stable campaign after almost being relegated for the first time in their history last season. There are new coaches at Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, who have reappointed Armin Veh, the architect of their 2007 title triumph, while Cologne are back among the elite and Paderborn are in the Bundesliga for the first time."
