0,21/01/2021,00:14,Villas-Boas under pressure after latest Marseille defeat,"Andre Villas-Boas said on Wednesday he would leave his role as Marseille coach if asked to by club bosses, after seeing his side lose 1-0 at home to Lens in Ligue 1.","The hosts, who followed a goalless draw with Dijon by losing to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions Trophy and then to Nimes, came unstuck again as Simon Banza netted a second-half winner for the visitors at the Stade Velodrome. OM remain sixth in the Ligue 1 table, albeit with a game in hand, 10 points behind leaders PSG and second-placed Lille. They have only won one of their last eight matches in all competitions. ""My place is at the disposal of the management,"" said former Chelsea and Tottenham manager Villas-Boas. ""I am not here to be an obstacle."" A drab match saw few chances, with the majority of the best opportunities falling to seventh-placed Lens, who moved within a point of their beaten opponents. Banza met Massadio Haidara's cross to score his third league goal of the season from close range in the 59th minute. The closest Marseille came was a late free-kick from Dimitri Payet which flew narrowly over the crossbar. ""We have to do better, find a way not to concede from a cross,"" added Villas-Boas, whose side visit Monaco on Saturday. ""I have to believe in myself and in my players to change this run of form. Monaco is coming up, I am focused on that, to find the team, the solutions."" The game against Lens was one of two that Marseille had in hand over their rivals. They remain eight points behind Lyon, who occupy the third and final Champions League spot."
1,17/01/2021,23:44,Metz end Lyon's run as PSG take Ligue 1 lead,Lyon slumped to a shock 1-0 home defeat to Metz on Sunday that ended a long unbeaten run and allowed Paris Saint-Germain to stay top of Ligue 1.,"Rudi Garcia's side had come into Sunday's late match on the back of 16 league games without defeat, knowing that a win would have put them back in the lead of France's top flight. However Aaron Leya Iseka struck in the final minute to snatch the points for resilient Metz, who had to withstand a second-half onslaught before finally prevailing and moving ninth. ""We pushed, they pushed, and we were rewarded for our efforts. We knew that we would have little of the ball and that we would have to counter well, and that's what we did,"" said Belgian Leya Iseka. The loss leaves Lyon third, two points behind PSG and Lille, whose own late goal from Jonathan David secured a 2-1 win over Reims. Lyon should have taken the lead six minutes before the break when Karl Toko Ekambi was fed by Tintotenda Kadewere on a breakaway attack. Cameroonian Ekambi, who had forced a good save from Alexandre Oukidja three minutes earlier, successfully cut inside to fashion himself a shooting opportunity but could only blast over. Three minutes later Metz twice came close to taking a shock lead, first hitting the post following a Farid Boulaya cross before Marcelo charged back to block Lamine Gueye's shot on the line. With 16 minutes remaining Ekambi slammed home what he thought was the opener when the ball fell to him after fine play between Memphis Depay and Thiago Mendes. However after a long VAR review the goal was ruled out for Houssem Aouar straying offside when Mendes shot and then pressuring Metz defender Fabien Centonze, who had nodded the ball out to Ekambi. Islam Slimani had the perfect chance to win the match with seven minutes left of his Lyon debut but he shanked his shot, and Oukidja then did brilliant to keep out Aouar's close range effort after fine work from Memphis Depay. That allowed Leya Iseka to claim a shock win for Metz. Earlier David pounced in the first minute of stoppage for Lille to tap home after Xeka's powerful low drive was spilled by Reims goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic to put Lille on 42 points, equal with champions PSG. Jonathan Bamba's long-range leveller two minutes after the break gave Lille a chance to snatch the win after Arber Zeneli had given Reims a 35th-minute lead with a cross that bamboozled home stopper Mike Maignan. Monaco are six points off the lead in fourth after Wissam Ben Yedder's brace gave them a 3-2 win over Montpellier on Friday. The Principality club are level on 36 points with fifth-placed Rennes, who earlier on Sunday fought back from going a goal down after just three minutes at Brest to win 2-1. Saint-Etienne are just four points above the relegation zone after a 1-0 defeat at Strasbourg. The 10-time French champions are 16th and winless in five league matches thanks in part to a missed 10th-minute penalty from Ryad Boudebouz. Ludovic Ajorque scored the winner for the team from Alsace just before the half-hour mark. Nantes are hovering above the drop zone after drawing 1-1 at home with Lens, with Gael Kakuta's 81st-minute leveller for the away side denying Raymond Domenech a first win in charge of the hosts. The former France coach has guided Nantes to three straight draws since his much-derided appointment last month, with his team battling a run of games without a win that stretches back to early November. Bordeaux strolled to a thumping 3-0 win at Nice, who are also without a win in five."
2,24/10/2020,19:37,French Ligue 1 game called off as Lens report 11 coronavirus cases,"The French Ligue 1 game between Lens and Nantes due to be played on Sunday has been postponed after 11 members of the home squad tested positive for coronavirus, officials have confirmed.","In a statement, the league (LFP) said that ""noting the certain absence of 11 Lens players from a list of 30 because of positive RT-PCR tests...it has decided to postpone the game between Lens and Nantes scheduled for Sunday to a later date"". It is not the first time this season a Ligue 1 game has been postponed due to Covid-19. Marseille's meeting with Bordeaux on the opening night of the campaign in August was rescheduled for the same reason. After that, and fearing an avalanche of postponements, the LFP relaxed its health protocol to ensure games could go ahead as long as at least 20 players from a list of 30 on each team tested negative. The Ligue 2 game between Grenoble and Nancy scheduled for Saturday was also postponed after 13 Grenoble players tested positive along with five staff members. Lens and its surrounding region, in far northern France, are currently under a nighttime curfew along with much of the country as part of efforts to reduce the spread of the virus. France has recorded more than one million cases and close to 35,000 deaths from Covid-19. Elsewhere, Marseille bounced back from their 1-0 midweek loss away to Olympiakos in the Champions League with a victory by the same margin at Lorient on Saturday. Argentine defender Leonardo Balerdi headed in from a tight angle for the only goal in the second half after home goalkeeper Paul Nardi was caught underneath a hanging Florian Thauvin free-kick. Reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain host Dijon later at the Parc des Princes in a game that will be played behind closed doors. On Friday, Rennes lost 2-1 at home to Angers as their unbeaten start to the season came to an end."
3,19/10/2020,00:01,Lille thrash nine-man Lens to go top of Ligue 1,Lille grabbed top spot in Ligue 1 on Sunday by thrashing newly-promoted Lens 4-0 in France's northern derby as the ill-disciplined visitors had two players sent off.,"Lens had a chance to go top in France for the first time in 16 years but their defensive frailties were ruthlessly exposed by Lille who move two points ahead of defending champions Paris Saint-Germain. Burak Yilmaz's low shot put the home side ahead in the echoing, empty Stade Metropole after 11 minutes. Lens hung on till the second half when Jonathan Bamba scored Lille's second before first Jonathan Gradit and then substitute Clement Michelin were shown red cards as Lens fell apart. Jonathan Ikone and Yusuf Yazici completed the job for Lille. ""Tonight was a perfect match,"" said Lille striker Luiz Araujo. ""This start to the season is the result of the hard work we do every day. We are very serious and ready to do a great job but we haven't won anything yet. ""We have to keep our feet on the ground and stay focused on the next game."" PSG had also won 4-0 on Friday with Kylian Mbappe scoring twice at Nimes. Lyon coach Rudi Garcia said his team had ""turned the page"" after captain Memphis Depay set up three goals in Sunday's 3-2 win at Strasbourg to claim their first victory since August. The Dutch attacker, who was linked with a move to Barcelona during the transfer window, was the provider for Zimbabwe international forward Tino Kadewere and repeated the feat twice for Karl Toko Ekambi in the first half. Habib Diallo and Jean-Eudes Aholou scored for the hosts but Lyon hung on and move up to ninth with their first three points since August. ""The win was more than deserved. This team had the capacity to admit they had to turn the page,"" Garcia said. ""The answer was on the pitch, three Depay assists and three goals in open play."" Kadewere opened the scoring after 15 minutes, firing home first time from Depay's long ball. Depay then combined twice with Toko Ekambi before the 42-minute mark to make it 3-0. The hosts fought back as Senegal's Diallo cut the deficit just over a minute later. Ivory Coast midfielder Aholou, on loan from Monaco, scored with a left-footed volley 10 minutes into the second half. Patrick Vieira's Nice side eased to a 3-1 win at Saint-Etienne to move up to fourth, joining Lens on 13 points. Pierre Lees-Malou opened the scoring for Nice before 20-year-old Amine Gouiri added a second before half-time. Adil Aouchiche pulled a goal back for Saint-Etienne on 57 minutes but Myziane Maolida sealed the points for the southerners. On Saturday, Marseille warmed up for their return to the Champions League next week with a 3-1 victory over Bordeaux."
4,11/09/2020,00:08,Virus-depleted PSG flop at new boys Lens on Ligue 1 opener,Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their season in the worst possible fashion on Thursday as their coronavirus-depleted team fell to a 1-0 defeat at newly-promoted Lens.,"PSG came into their first match of the new domestic season with seven of their star players missing after testing positive for coronavirus, including Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. They started the match with their third-choice goalkeeper Marcin Bulka and it was the 20-year-old who handed Lens the win with an awful blunder 11 minutes after the break. Under no pressure and trying to play out from the back, Bulka slid a weak pass towards Marci Verratti that was snapped up by Ignatius Ganago, who slammed home what turned out to be the winner from close range. The strike was the Cameroon international's first goal for his new club after signing from Nice in July and sent the rowdy 3,800 fans at Stade Bollaert-Delelis wild with joy. ""I'm very happy. It feels good to open my account and I hope to score many more,"" said the 21-year-old Ganago. ""Even without Neymar or Mbappe Paris have a very good team. We were solid, we were compact, we all worked together and it paid off in the end."" Covid-19 has ripped the heart out of coach Thomas Tuchel's side, with Angel Di Maria and Leandro Paredes also testing positive. PSG confirmed three more cases with L'Equipe identifying them as Argentine striker Mauro Icardi, Brazilian defender Marquinhos and goalkeeper Keylor Navas. Apart from Mbappe all of them contracted the virus after holidaying in Ibiza after losing the Champions League final to Bayern Munich in Lisbon last month. Mbappe tested positive on France duty at the start of the week, forcing the world's second most expensive player to sit out Tuesday's World Cup final rematch with Croatia. Tuchel's thin squad now face a rush of fixtures as they try to catch up with a league awaiting its third round of matches at the weekend. PSG take on arch-rivals Marseille at the Parc des Princes on Sunday night before another home match with Metz -- which was their original opening fixture -- on Wednesday and a trip to Nice the following Sunday."

The former Manchester City player joined Udinese in 2016 after loan spells at Fulham and Bastia. ""I had other offers but I asked myself the right questions,"" said Fofana, adding he was ""impatient"" to discover his new team where he joins former Bastia teammates Jean-Louis Leca and Yannick Cahuzac. Fofana played 119 games for Udinese, scoring 13 goals, with the club finishing 13th in the Italian top flight last season."
