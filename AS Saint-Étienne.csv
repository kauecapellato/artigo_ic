0,24/01/2021,23:58,Lyon crush Saint-Etienne to stay in touch at the top,Marcelo and Tino Kadewere kept Lyon in touch with Ligue 1's pace-setters on Sunday after they scored twice in a 5-0 derby thumping of a Saint-Etienne side missing a host of players to the coronavirus.,"Rudi Garcia's team stay two points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain and Lille, who earlier won 1-0 at Rennes, after a comfortable victory at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard thanks to two carbon copy headers from Brazilian Marcelo, another brace from Kadewere and a Denis Bouanga own goal. The win put Lyon back on track after falling at home to Metz last weekend but came against a Saint-Etienne team missing seven players following a Covid-19 outbreak at the club which also led to president Roland Romeyer testing positive. Ten-time French champions Saint-Etienne sit 16th after the defeat, only four points above the relegation zone after their miserable run of form was extended to just one win in their last 18 matches. ""This might have been our most complete performance. We could have scored more but winning a derby 5-0 is not something that comes every day,"" said Garcia. Kadewere put the away side in the lead in the 16th minute when a Memphis Depay corner fell to the Zimbabwean, who only had to tap home to open the scoring. Mattia De Sciglio almost doubled Lyon's lead when he smacked a long-range shot against the bar seven minutes later, but it didn't take too for the deserved second goal to arrive. Leo Dubois whipped in a superb free-kick into the Saint-Etienne area in the 36th minute which allowed Marcelo to attack the ball aggressively and head in his first goal of the season. Marcelo repeated the trick just before the hour mark when he met another perfect Dubois cross to crash in the third, before Kadewere claimed his ninth of the campaign in the 68th minute after collecting a pass from Memphis Depay. Bouanga completed the home side's misery by nodding Depay's free-kick into his own net with eight minutes remaining. ""It is difficult to accept, we're angry with ourselves for making it so easy for them,"" said Saint-Etienne coach Claude Puel. ""Even with the situation we were in we believed but we were very quickly disillusioned because we were so sloppy both defensively and going forward."" Earlier, Jonathan David made sure that Lille stayed level on 45 points with PSG by scoring the only goal in their 1-0 win at Rennes. David pounced in the 16th minute when Yusuf Yazici's corner was palmed out to him by Rennes goalkeeper Romain Salin, the Canada forward lashing home. The 21-year-old's fourth league goal of the season was his second winner in as many weeks after striking in injury time against Reims last time out. His strike gave Christophe Galtier's Lille their third win in a row and handed Rennes, who are fifth on 36 points, their first defeat in eight matches. ""It was a very important win,"" said Galtier. ""I don't think we are really rivals to PSG, given the quality of their squad... but we're going to fight."" Bordeaux sit in seventh on 32 points after an early brace from South Korea striker Hwang Ui-Jo powered them to a 2-1 home win over Angers. Raymond Domenech is still waiting for his first win as Nantes coach after falling to his first defeat with his new club, 2-0 at Metz. Nantes sit a point behind Saint-Etienne in 17th after a 12th successive match without a win, a defeat which came after former France coach Domenech had led them to three straight draws. ""You can't play with your hands in your pockets,"" said the 69-year-old. ""We are in a tough situation now, and the players need to know that."""
1,17/01/2021,23:44,Metz end Lyon's run as PSG take Ligue 1 lead,Lyon slumped to a shock 1-0 home defeat to Metz on Sunday that ended a long unbeaten run and allowed Paris Saint-Germain to stay top of Ligue 1.,"Rudi Garcia's side had come into Sunday's late match on the back of 16 league games without defeat, knowing that a win would have put them back in the lead of France's top flight. However Aaron Leya Iseka struck in the final minute to snatch the points for resilient Metz, who had to withstand a second-half onslaught before finally prevailing and moving ninth. ""We pushed, they pushed, and we were rewarded for our efforts. We knew that we would have little of the ball and that we would have to counter well, and that's what we did,"" said Belgian Leya Iseka. The loss leaves Lyon third, two points behind PSG and Lille, whose own late goal from Jonathan David secured a 2-1 win over Reims. Lyon should have taken the lead six minutes before the break when Karl Toko Ekambi was fed by Tintotenda Kadewere on a breakaway attack. Cameroonian Ekambi, who had forced a good save from Alexandre Oukidja three minutes earlier, successfully cut inside to fashion himself a shooting opportunity but could only blast over. Three minutes later Metz twice came close to taking a shock lead, first hitting the post following a Farid Boulaya cross before Marcelo charged back to block Lamine Gueye's shot on the line. With 16 minutes remaining Ekambi slammed home what he thought was the opener when the ball fell to him after fine play between Memphis Depay and Thiago Mendes. However after a long VAR review the goal was ruled out for Houssem Aouar straying offside when Mendes shot and then pressuring Metz defender Fabien Centonze, who had nodded the ball out to Ekambi. Islam Slimani had the perfect chance to win the match with seven minutes left of his Lyon debut but he shanked his shot, and Oukidja then did brilliant to keep out Aouar's close range effort after fine work from Memphis Depay. That allowed Leya Iseka to claim a shock win for Metz. Earlier David pounced in the first minute of stoppage for Lille to tap home after Xeka's powerful low drive was spilled by Reims goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic to put Lille on 42 points, equal with champions PSG. Jonathan Bamba's long-range leveller two minutes after the break gave Lille a chance to snatch the win after Arber Zeneli had given Reims a 35th-minute lead with a cross that bamboozled home stopper Mike Maignan. Monaco are six points off the lead in fourth after Wissam Ben Yedder's brace gave them a 3-2 win over Montpellier on Friday. The Principality club are level on 36 points with fifth-placed Rennes, who earlier on Sunday fought back from going a goal down after just three minutes at Brest to win 2-1. Saint-Etienne are just four points above the relegation zone after a 1-0 defeat at Strasbourg. The 10-time French champions are 16th and winless in five league matches thanks in part to a missed 10th-minute penalty from Ryad Boudebouz. Ludovic Ajorque scored the winner for the team from Alsace just before the half-hour mark. Nantes are hovering above the drop zone after drawing 1-1 at home with Lens, with Gael Kakuta's 81st-minute leveller for the away side denying Raymond Domenech a first win in charge of the hosts. The former France coach has guided Nantes to three straight draws since his much-derided appointment last month, with his team battling a run of games without a win that stretches back to early November. Bordeaux strolled to a thumping 3-0 win at Nice, who are also without a win in five."
2,06/01/2021,22:58,PSG held by Saint-Etienne,Mauricio Pochettino's first match as Paris Saint-Germain coach ended in a 1-1 draw at Saint-Etienne on Wednesday as his new team slipped three points behind Ligue 1 leaders Lyon.,"The defending league champions fell behind early on to Romain Hamouma's strike before Moise Kean levelled soon after, but laboured in the second half and failed to find a winner. ""Of course I'm disappointed because we're PSG, we want to win,"" Pochettino told Telefoot. ""I'm happy with the effort made by the players, by their attitude."" The former Tottenham boss was only confirmed as Thomas Tuchel's successor on Saturday, four days after the German's sacking was officially announced. But the scale of the task facing the former PSG defender was laid out in front of him at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard as the capital-city giants' title defence suffered another blow. ""This is just the beginning,"" added the 48-year-old Pochettino. ""We have to get to know each other. It was difficult because the preparation was too short. ""It's positive but there are things to improve."" Lyon survived a late Lens comeback to extend their lead with a 3-2 win, with Memphis Depay's double proving crucial. PSG did move into second, above Lille on goal difference, after Christophe Galtier's team slipped to a surprise 2-1 home loss to Angers. Pochettino made just two changes to the final starting XI selected by Tuchel for the 4-0 win over Strasbourg before the winter break, with Moise Kean and Idrissa Gueye returning in place of Rafinha and Timothee Pembele. PSG started well going forwards but looked vulnerable at the back and were made to pay in the 19th minute as Gueye carelessly lost possession on the edge of his own area. Denis Bouanga had plenty of time to pick out Romain Hamouma, who tapped into the net. But the visitors wasted little time in equalising as Kean repaid Pochettino's faith to score the first goal of the Argentinian's era, spinning and firing home after Marco Verratti's pass. The Italian striker has now scored 10 goals for PSG since joining on loan from Everton in the close season. But Les Verts, bidding to extend their unbeaten run to seven matches, continued to find gaping holes in the away defence and Keylor Navas had to make a smart, diving save to keep out Mathieu Debuchy's volley. Paris dominated possession early in the second period, but Saint-Etienne had the better chances, with Bouanga denied by Navas and Hamouma having a penalty appeal turned down. PSG started to pile on the pressure in the final 15 minutes, with Angel Di Maria forcing home goalkeeper Jessy Moulin into a smart low stop after Kylian Mbappe's clever dummy. Substitute Pablo Sarabia wasted a golden late chance in injury time, blazing over with just Moulin to beat. At Groupama Stadium, Lyon raced into a three-goal lead over Lens through Depay's brace and a Steven Fortes own goal. Rudi Garcia's OL, who led the top flight at Christmas for the first time since 2008, held on for a vital three points despite Florian Sotoca and Cheick Oumar Doucoure hitting back for Lens. Lille, who were level on points with Lyon heading into the day, dropped to third as Romain Thomas scored twice in the first 10 minutes for Angers at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. Burak Yilmaz pulled one back before the interval but the away side held on. Marseille boosted their title hopes, though, as Dimitri Payet's 80th-minute strike helped secure a 3-1 home success against Montpellier. Andre-Villas Boas' men are fifth, but only eight points behind Lyon with two games in hand. Earlier on Wednesday, former France coach Raymond Domenech's reign at 17th-placed Nantes started with a drab goalless draw against fourth-placed Rennes. ""We have laid the first stone,"" said Domenech, who led France to the 2006 World Cup final. ""Now we must continue to improve."" Monaco moved into fifth with a 5-2 victory at 10-man Lorient, with Aleksandr Golovin and Kevin Volland among the scorers."
3,04/01/2021,12:14,Saint-Etienne end ex-skipper Ruffier's contract five months early,"French goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier's contract has been terminated by Saint-Etienne four months after he was suspended for insubordination, the Ligue 1 club announced on Monday.","Les Verts' former captain Ruffier, 34, last featured for the side in February and was banned for six days in July for turning up late to training. In November he was permanently suspended for leaving an individual training session early, with his deal set to finish next June. ""Saint-Etienne regret having come to this decision, which was made inevitable by the attitude of the player which jeopardised the institution,"" the club said. Ruffier, who made the last of his three international appearances in 2010, is now a free agent after making 383 appearances for Saint-Etienne."
4,29/11/2020,23:54,Lille held as Ligue 1 top five separated by two points,"Lille stuttered to a 1-1 draw at struggling Saint-Etienne on Sunday to miss the chance to draw level on points with Paris Saint-Germain at the top of Ligue 1, but the rest of the chasers took advantage of the defending champions' latest slip-up.","Lille sit second in the table, two points behind PSG -- who drew 2-2 with Bordeaux on Saturday -- and above Lyon, Monaco and Montpellier on goal difference. Lyon continued their fine form with a 3-0 win over Reims, while Monaco beat Nimes by the same scoreline to also move within two points of PSG, while Montpellier edged out Lorient. Lille would have hoped to take all three points from a Saint-Etienne side on a seven-match losing streak in the league before kick-off. But Christophe Galtier's team fell behind to a controversial first-half penalty from Tunisian Wahbi Khazri and needed a second-half strike from Jonathan Ikone to rescue a draw. Galtier was left frustrated by the decision to award Khazri the spot-kick, after the former Sunderland winger appeared to fall over Domagoj Bradaric in a vain attempt to reach the ball before Lille goalkeeper Mike Maignan. ""The penalty was a clear refereeing error,"" he said. ""Wahbi Khazri comes with a lot of experience onto my player Domagoj Bradaric. ""With video and professional referees this shouldn't happen. It doesn't take away from our bad first half, but it was an important moment of the game."" Karl Toko Ekambi, Bruno Guimaraes and Moussa Dembele scored for Lyon as they made it 16 points from their last six matches. ""We must continue in this vein and look upwards. We must put a run of victories together,"" said Lyon coach Rudi Garcia. ""This is the first time that we have won three times in a row. As in Angers (last week), we had an opportunity to (move up the) table. We seized it."" PSG gave the chasing pack a chance to cut the gap with a 2-2 home draw against Bordeaux on Saturday, having blown a two-goal lead to lose to Monaco last week. Reims, who had Moreto Cassama sent off on 33 minutes, remain fourth from bottom and look destined for a relegation dog-fight. Monaco eased to victory over Nimes to notch their fourth straight league win. Young midfielder Sofiane Diop gave the hosts an early lead at the Stade Louis II, before Gelson Martins and Kevin Volland struck in the second half to see off Nimes, who had Lucas Deaux dismissed in the 69th minute. Germany striker Volland has scored five Ligue 1 goals for Monaco since his close-season move from Bayer Leverkusen. The principality outfit have finished ninth and 17th in the last two seasons and coach Niko Kovac was eager to play down any thoughts of a repeat of their shock 2017 title triumph. ""The title? Not after 12 games, we're not there, no,"" said the Croatian. ""It's a good period for us, we have to keep working, we are a young team. We will also lose matches."" Fifth-placed Montpellier also extended their winning streak to four matches as Petar Skuletic scored late on to grab a 1-0 win at Lorient, despite midfielder Teji Savanier's missed penalty in the first half. Marseille, who have also won four league matches on the spin, are only four points behind PSG in sixth, with two games in hand."
5,25/09/2020,14:05,Chase for Saint-Etienne's Fofana confirms Premier League's love for French talent,Premier League clubs have long looked to France for young talent and the Saint-Etienne defender Wesley Fofana is just the latest unpolished diamond who could be set to head to England in a big-money move.,"Centre-back Fofana is only 19 and has not even been capped by France at Under-21 level, and yet there is a growing queue of clubs eager to sign him before the transfer window closes in Europe on October 5. Leicester City have so far offered as much as 32 million euros ($37.3m) for Fofana, while West Ham United have reportedly come in with their own bid worth up to 36 million euros, eyebrow-raising offers even if the footballing economy were not dealing with a major downturn due to the coronavirus pandemic. So far Saint-Etienne manager Claude Puel has rejected all bids for a player he wants to have a key role in his young team this season at France's historically most successful club, despite the money on offer being hard to turn down in the current market. A year ago Saint-Etienne were compelled to sell another exciting young central defender to England, with William Saliba, who is just 19, joining Arsenal for a fee that could rise to 30 million euros. He was allowed to stay in Saint-Etienne last season on loan. ""If we have to sell our young players at the end of every season it is impossible for us to progress and move on to the next level,"" former Leicester boss Puel said of the Saliba sale, agreed before he was appointed. Fofana has had his head turned by the interest from England and told sports daily L'Equipe earlier this month that he was desperate to take the offer of a five-year deal on the table at Leicester. It would see him earn a huge increase on his current wage, believed to be around $20,000 a week. ""I would be crazy to say no to Leicester. This contract can change my life,"" Fofana said. But Puel, whose team have enjoyed a fine start to the new French season and top the Ligue 1 table coming into the weekend, is adamant. ""I don't want to do anything special for one player,"" he insisted. ""We could have expected this given the way we have started the season. That gets people excited and exposes us with the transfer window not closing until October 5."" In any case, it is the lot for clubs in France these days -- apart from Paris Saint-Germain -- who find it harder and harder to keep hold of their best young players in the face of interest from richer leagues abroad. Indeed, as many as 40 of the players who featured in the Premier League last weekend -- across 16 of the 20 clubs -- either initially broke through in the French game or were most recently playing there before joining their current clubs. Ligue 1 may lag behind its elite European neighbours in many respects but it remains the continent's most fertile breeding ground for young talent. For Fofana, if he does not get the move he craves in this transfer window, it will surely only be a matter of time."
6,18/08/2020,17:43,Ligue 1 season start reshuffled after Marseille virus cases,The French football league (LFP) on Tuesday reshuffled the opening weekend of Ligue 1 after the game scheduled to kick off the season was postponed following three more positive coronavirus tests at Marseille.,"Marseille were due to play Saint-Etienne on Friday evening in the first game shown by the league's new broadcast partner Mediapro on its specially created pay channel, Telefoot. The LFP filled the Friday evening slot by bringing forward the game between Bordeaux and Nantes, initially scheduled for Saturday. It will be the first league match in France since March 8. The LFP said the postponed Marseille match was to be played on either September 16 or 17 ""subject to changes in sanitary conditions within the Olympique de Marseille club"". The three fresh coronavirus cases took the total at Marseille to four, and the club said on Tuesday that all details had been relayed to the LFP. The LFP guidelines say that four cases mean the virus is ""widespread"" at a club. Regional daily La Provence reported that the three positive tests announced on Tuesday were from goalkeeper Steve Mandanda and midfielders Maxime Lopez and Valentin Rongier, names that the club would neither confirm nor deny to AFP, citing medical confidentiality. The earlier positive reportedly came from defender Jordan Amavi, who also hinted that was the case on social media. Andre Villas-Boas' side cancelled a friendly on August 14 against Stuttgart of Germany as a precaution. Fellow Ligue 1 side Nimes announced two new suspected cases in its squad and all employees have been put in isolation pending test results. Nimes had hosted Marseille on August 9 in a friendly. They are due to host Brest on Sunday in the first round of Ligue 1 matches. Some 40 players from 11 clubs have tested positive for COVID-19 in recent weeks. The vast majority contracted the virus after resuming training in June, leading to quarantine and a flurry of cancelled pre-season matches. Two matches slated for this weekend -- Paris Saint-Germain against Metz and Montpellier against Lyon -- had already been postponed because PSG and Lyon are playing Champions League semi-finals in Portugal. Because of the health crisis, stadium capacity has been capped at 5,000 though fan groups at several clubs said the rules mean they will not go to matches. Similarly, the collective of PSG ultras, the club's main fan group, said on social media that they will not hold an event on Tuesday evening, when their club plays Leipzig in the semi-final of the Champions League behind closed doors in Lisbon. ""We have not found any place that can accommodate our fervour while respecting the sanitary conditions,"" they posted."
7,17/08/2020,00:08,"New suspected coronavirus cases at Marseille, five days from new season","Three new cases of suspected coronavirus were revealed by French football giants Marseille on Sunday, just five days before they are due to kick-off the new Ligue 1 season.","The cases are amongst the ""workforce"", a statement said, and if confirmed would take the number at the club to four in the last four days. Andre Villas-Boas' side already cancelled a friendly on Friday against Stuttgart of Germany as a precaution. Under health protocols adopted in recent weeks which are awaiting final approval, the four cases could mean Marseille's scheduled opener against St Etienne on Friday may be called off. At least 37 Ligue 1 players from 11 clubs have tested positive for COVID-19 in recent weeks. The vast majority of them contracted the virus after resuming training in June, leading to quarantine and a flurry of cancelled pre-season matches. With only one positive case announced, fellow top-flight sides Bordeaux, Dijon, Lens, Monaco and Nimes have not seen their preparations too disrupted. On the other hand, Lille (with four cases), Saint-Etienne (five), Montpellier (six), Nantes (seven) and Strasbourg (nine) have all seen their pre-season affected. Montpellier, Nantes and Strasbourg have had to cancel several friendlies. ""When the players become negative again, we will be able to use them. But in what state, I do not know,"" said Strasbourg coach Thierry Laurey. Two matches will not take place this weekend - between Paris Saint-Germain and Metz and the game featuring Montpellier against Lyon. That is due to the Champions League semi-final commitments of PSG and Lyon in Portugal. ""Clubs have great fears over the resumption of the championship,"" said one unnamed Ligue 1 president. ""We are afraid of being in the situation where for three months we had the car in the garage without being able to take it out, and when we finally can get back on the road there is a risk of it breaking down."" Nice, meanwhile, have already decided to play their first match behind closed doors next Sunday against Lens. If Marseille do welcome Saint-Etienne on Friday, it will be at a relatively quiet Velodrome where only 5,000 fans will be allowed. Marseille's request for an exemption to allow 20,000 people inside the ground was rejected by local government."
8,25/07/2020,01:12,'Everyone is worried': Mbappe on crutches as Champions League looms,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel said ""everyone is worried"" after Kylian Mbappe hobbled off in the first half of Friday's French Cup final with an ankle injury after a dreadful tackle by Saint-Etienne captain Loic Perrin.","Mbappe received lengthy treatment but was eventually substituted after his right ankle was caught by a clumsy Perrin challenge that resulted in a red card for the centre-back in likely his final game for Saint-Etienne. ""Everyone is worried. Everyone who saw the foul is worried. Of course I'm worried,"" said Tuchel after his team's 1-0 win. ""We have to be patient because we don't have any news. I think he will undergo tests tonight."" A tearful Mbappe was replaced by Pablo Sarabia but the greater concern for PSG will be the severity of his injury ahead of next month's Champions League quarter-final against Atalanta in Lisbon. He reemerged from the Stade de France tunnel later in the second half on crutches. ""It's the third game against Saint-Etienne and it's a third red card, each time in the first 30 minutes,"" added Tuchel. ""It's not all good news for us."" PSG face Lyon in the French League Cup final next Friday before resuming their European campaign in a unique straight knockout tournament at the Estadio da Luz on August 12. ""I hope Kylian is going to recover as quickly as possible because he's a vital player for us,"" said PSG captain Thiago Silva. Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini said he was ""sorry"" to hear of Mbappe's injury and hoped it was ""nothing serious"" ahead of next month's European clash. Saint-Etienne boss Claude Puel admitted the forward was simply too quick for the 34-year-old Perrin. ""I hope it's a minor injury for Kylian. The intention was to play the ball but it's true that he was too fast,"" said Puel."
9,24/07/2020,23:32,Neymar wins French Cup final for PSG but Mbappe suffers ankle injury,"Neymar scored the winning goal as Paris Saint-Germain defeated 10-man Saint-Etienne 1-0 in the French Cup final on Friday, the first competitive fixture in the country since March 11 following the coronavirus pandemic.","However, coach Thomas Tuchel faces an anxious wait over the fitness of Kylian Mbappe ahead of next month's Champions League quarter-final after the France star limped off during the first half with an ankle injury. The World Cup winner was later seen in the tunnel on crutches. PSG secured the first of a potential three trophies this summer, added a record-extending 13th French Cup to their list of honours with the League Cup final against Lyon to come next Friday before the resumption of their European campaign in Portugal. The final at the Stade de France was the first official match in one of Europe's top football nations to allow fans to attend since March, albeit in severely restricted numbers with just 2,805 spectators -- including President Emmanuel Macron -- inside the 80,000-seater venue. A minute's applause was held ahead of kick-off for the victims of COVID-19, which has claimed the lives of over 30,000 people in France, and in support of frontline workers. PSG had racked up 20 goals without reply in three friendlies building up to the final, but Yvann Macon's crunching tackle on Neymar in the first minute suggested no such goodwill would be afforded by Saint-Etienne in their first French Cup final appearance since 1982. The challenge set the tone for a fractious opening period and Denis Bouanga was inches from firing Saint-Etienne ahead when his strike rebounded back off Keylor Navas's left-hand post. Unfazed by that scare, PSG led on 14 minutes as Mbappe burst into the area after an exchange with Angel Di Maria and Neymar crashed home the rebound via the underside of the crossbar after a fine save from Jessy Moulin. Bouanga twice forced Navas to turn away while Moulin produced a sensational one-handed stop to tip over from Di Maria, earning plaudits from the Argentine himself. Saint-Etienne's hopes of fighting back were deeply hampered midway through the first half though when captain Loic Perrin, on likely his final appearance for the club, was sent off for a dreadful challenge on Mbappe. The World Cup winner required lengthy treatment but was forced off after his right ankle was trapped between the legs of Perrin, whose yellow card was upgraded to red following a VAR review. Emotions boiled over with five players booked in the aftermath following an ugly melee, but the greater concern for PSG will be the severity of Mbappe's injury. The France star reemerged from the tunnel on crutches in the second half, with less than three weeks before PSG's Champions League tie against Atalanta on August 12. Moulin kept Saint-Etienne in with a remote shot of ending their 43-year wait for a seventh French Cup title, repelling Mauro Icardi and Di Maria before spreading himself superbly to deny Pablo Sarabia. The goalkeeper even raced forward for a late corner but PSG held firm to atone for last year's defeat in the final by Rennes on penalties, clinching the trophy for the fifth time in the past six seasons."
10,23/07/2020,19:17,PSG embark on trophy blitz as French football resumes,"Four months after French football ground to a standstill as the coronavirus pandemic worsened, Paris Saint-Germain head into Friday's national cup final against Saint-Etienne looking to land the first of a potential three titles in a five-match burst.","Declared Ligue 1 champions for the seventh time in eight years after the season was ended prematurely, PSG return to competitive action 135 days later with the French Cup, French League Cup and Champions League in their sights. Unlike their last fixture on March 11, a 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund behind closed doors that sealed a place in the Champions League quarter-finals, a limited number of fans will be allowed to attend the French Cup final. The fixture at the Stade de France marks the return of French football, lagging well behind the rest of Europe's top leagues which eventually restarted despite the health crisis. PSG have shown little rustiness in dispatching a trio of friendly opponents -- Le Havre, Waasland-Beveren and Scottish champions Celtic -- with 20 goals scored and none conceded. For Saint-Etienne, the COVID-19 interruption allowed them to turn the page on a dismal league campaign in which they finished 17th -- a far cry from their fourth-placed effort in 2018-19. ""The goal was to avoid injuries and come into the final with fresh legs and clear minds. We're ready to play,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""It's a very important match after a long break. No team has ever done that. We want to win."" PSG captain Thiago Silva hopes to sign off on an eight-year spell at the club with a raft of trophies, having signed a short-term extension through August. ""The truth is I didn't want to leave but the decision has been taken and I respect it,"" said Silva, who has helped PSG to four of their record 12 French Cup triumphs. ""It's a different time to any other, it's historic and strange,"" he added. ""To stop for four months like that, it's not easy to then get back to the highest level."" Friday's showdown is a repeat of the 1982 final, won by PSG on penalties following a 2-2 draw in which Michel Platini scored twice for Saint-Etienne. It was PSG's first major title and also the last time Saint-Etienne reached the final. ""We're not favourites. Our goal is to enjoy ourselves, play our trump card and be in the match. I hope we let loose, we have nothing to lose,"" said Saint-Etienne boss Claude Puel. French President Emmanuel Macron will be in attendance as is tradition, but fewer than 5,000 spectators will be permitted at the 80,000-seater venue as part of stringent health regulations. Saint-Etienne supporters have said they will boycott the match after receiving an allocation of just 900 tickets. However, the occasion will provide Tuchel the chance to atone for last year's final defeat by Rennes in a penalty shootout, as PSG failed to win at least one of the two domestic cups for the first time since 2013. PSG return to the Stade de France on July 31 to face Lyon in the French League Cup final. They will then head to Lisbon to play Atalanta on August 12 in the quarter-finals of a Champions League 'Final Eight'. The tournament will be played in a straight knockout format due to the difficulties caused by the coronavirus, with PSG dreaming of a remarkable quadruple to celebrate the club's 50-year anniversary."
11,25/11/2019,00:04,Marseille retake second place in Ligue 1 with Toulouse win,Marseille reclaimed second spot in Ligue 1 when they won 2-0 at 10-man Toulouse who cracked in the final 15 minutes.,"Earlier on Sunday, Bordeaux edged in-form Monaco 2-1 at home to briefly climb into third and Saint-Etienne drew 0-0 at home against Montpellier. In Toulouse, the home team were reduced to 10 men when right back Steven Moreira drove his studs into Bouna Sarr's knee and received a red card after a video review. Marseille dominated a scruffy match but struggled to break down Toulouse. The home team defended in depth and even had a chance to take the lead in the 70th minute but goalkeeper Steve Mandanda saved Ibrahim Sangare's header with his foot. Marseille responded with a decisive moment of inspiration in the 76th minute. Dimitri Payet drew defenders then threaded a clever reverse pass to the darting Dario Benedetto who danced past Baptiste Reynet and coolly slid the ball into the goal. Three minutes later, Toulouse presented Marseille with a second. Left-back Issiaga Sylla drove a clearance into Valere Germain. The ball bounced to Nemanja Radonjic, who advanced into the penalty area and curled a shot into the net. ""We played a good game and the victory is deserved,"" said Marseille coach Andre Villas-Boas. Toulouse ""closed up the game after the red card,"" said Villas-Boas. ""Don't forget Mandanda's decisive save before we opened the scoring. We knew that the first goal would be very important. ""We keep our second place and we have to keep going like this."" Marseille climbed to 25 points from 14 matches, eight behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain but one ahead of Angers. Bordeaux and Saint-Etienne are fourth and fifth on 22. Toulouse remain second from bottom. Depleted Bordeaux, already deprived of defenders Mexer and Vukasin Jovanovic who were both suspended, midfielder Youssef Ait Bennasser, who could not play because he is on-loan from Monaco, lost centre-back Laurent Koscielny to injury on Sunday morning and winger Jimmy Briand during the warm-up. Monaco, who had climbed away from the relegation zone with three victories in their previous four league games, took the lead against Bordeaux with a goal by Islam Slimani on 15 minutes. After that, even though the hosts' fans fell silent in the first half as part of a protest against their owners, the visitors failed to exploit the makeshift home defence. Instead, Brazilian Pablo levelled with a powerful header from a corner after 29 minutes. In the 67th minute, Slimani handled while standing in the wall at a free kick, conceding a penalty and incurring his second yellow card. Nicolas de Preville converted the spot-kick to give Bordeaux victory. ""There were a lot of players from the starting XI who were not here,"" Bordeaux midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni said. ""This shows the strength of character of our team. Some of them didn't have much playing time this season. They stood up."" Later on Sunday, Saint-Etienne drew 0-0 at home against Montpellier as the sides managed just two shots on target."
12,07/10/2019,00:16,Late goal earns Saint-Etienne derby win over Lyon on Puel debut,Robert Beric scored a last-minute winner as Saint-Etienne defeated bitter rivals Lyon 1-0 on Sunday and new coach Claude Puel made a triumphant start in his first match in charge.,"Former Leicester City and Southampton boss Puel replaced Ghislain Printant on Friday after signing a three-year deal with the club that entered the derby clash bottom of Ligue 1. ""To produce such a display against Lyon is great, especially in such a short amount of time,"" said Puel, who also spent three years at Lyon from 2008-2011. ""This victory shows the players the sacrifice and desire they need to put into a match. I'm building something here and this fine start must be backed up."" Lyon began the weekend in trouble of their own, languishing a disappointing 11th after a domestic six-match winless run but buoyed by a Champions League victory at RB Leipzig. Anthony Lopes tipped a Riyad Boudebouz effort onto the post in a cagey first half at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, and the Lyon goalkeeper made another top reflex save to deny Denis Bouanga on the hour. Moussa Dembele came off the bench for Lyon and forced Jessy Moulin to palm away his header on 85 minutes, with Houssem Aouar then trickling an effort wide after sneaking in behind the hosts' defence. Beric won it at the death though as he rose superbly to head a Boudebouz cross beyond the reach of Lopes to send Saint-Etienne up to 13th and two points above Lyon. ""I'm very worried by our results,"" said Lyon coach Sylvinho. ""We're losing all our matches in the same way. It's not up to me to say if I'm the man for the situation. ""I feel the same as I did after (the 2-2 draws with) Amiens and Brest,"" he added. ""We've conceded again at the end of the match. It's even more frustrating in a derby."" In-form Victor Osimhen's seventh league goal of the season wasn't enough for Lille as they missed the chance to go third after drawing 2-2 with Nimes. Nigeria international Osimhen, 20, who also scored in Lille's 2-1 Champions League defeat to Chelsea midweek, struck the hosts' leveller with 11 minutes remaining after a Renaud Ripart penalty at the end of the first half and Kevin Denkey's neat 70th-minute finish had cancelled out Loic Remy's 13th-minute opener. A win for Lille would have moved them above surprise package Angers following their 4-0 hammering at the hands of league leaders Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday. Instead Christophe Galtier's side stay in fifth on 15 points from nine matches, but they could have easily lost against a spirited Nimes side that belied their pre-match league position of 17th. The lively Romain Philippoteaux, who won the spot-kick that Ripart calmly slotted home, came close to scoring a wonderful individual strike when his finish clipped the outside of the post following an exciting dribble. Reims moved into sixth, a point behind Lille after Boulaye Dia's strike three minutes after half-time consigned former high-fliers Rennes to the latest defeat in a miserable run of form. Level with PSG at the top of the league at the end of August, Julien Stephan's Rennes haven't won in the eight games in any competition since and have plummeted down to 10th. Reims meanwhile consolidated a fine start to the season that sees them with the league's best defensive record alongside PSG, with just four goals conceded in nine games."
13,04/10/2019,17:03,Puel appointed boss of struggling Saint-Etienne,"Former Southampton and Leicester Claude Puel has been appointed Saint-Etienne boss after Ghislain Printant was suspended as coach, the French outfit announced on Friday.","Puel, 58, who has signed a contract until 2022, returns to Ligue 1 with Saint-Etienne sitting 19th having won twice in eight matches. He will take the helm before Sunday's derby against fierce rivals Lyon, one of his former sides during a long career in France. The Frenchman led Premier League side Southampton to a League Cup final and a record eight-placed finish in 2017 before being sacked that June. He took over at Leicester City in October 2017 but lost his job at the Foxes in February after less than two seasons in charge. Saint-Etienne have lost four times so far this season, a series which includes a heavy 4-1 defeat to surprise package Angers a fortnight ago. They are without a win in the Europa League with a defeat to Gent and a draw at home to Wolfsburg."
14,22/02/2017,21:51,European finish the focus now for St Etienne's Galtier,No sooner had Saint Etienne crashed out of the Europa League to Manchester United on Wednesday than coach Christophe Galtier was plotting their return next season.,"With the European dream over after Henrikh Mkhitaryan's goal gave United a 1-0 win on the night and 4-0 aggregate success in the last 32 clash, Galtier wants his team to now focus on holding onto fifth place in Ligue 1. With Monaco, champions Paris Saint-Germain and Nice well ahead of the rest in the race for the three Champions League qualification berths, St Etienne face a battle with Lyon, Marseille and Bordeaux for two Europa League places. ""Once they scored a goal we knew it would be mission impossible and they managed to do it quite quickly,"" said Galtier of Wednesday's match. ""Now the Europa League is finished -- we expected that given the draw. ""I want to pay tribute to our group, they played 12 matches in Europe and lost two -- both to Manchester. ""We've progressed since last year. It was a great performance but it's finished. ""If we want to relive extraordinary evenings like tonight, with a full stadium and great atmosphere, we must finish in the top five. ""Our objective must be European qualification. From Sunday against Caen, we have to find the energy, find the determination to maintain the place we currently have because in 12 matches a lot can happen. ""My work will be to ensure our season doesn't end tonight."" The fourth place finishers in Ligue 1 and winners of the French Cup and League Cup qualify for the Europa League. But with Monaco and PSG contesting the League Cup final, and both likely to earn Champions League spots, fifth place would be enough to qualify for Europe. St Etienne currently occupy that position, four points behind Lyon but ahead of Marseille and Bordeaux only on goal difference."
15,22/02/2017,20:04,Mkhitaryan secures United progress despite injury,Henrikh Mkhitaryan scored but was then forced off with a hamstring injury as Manchester United cruised into the Europa League last 16 with a 1-0 win at St Etienne on Wednesday.,"That completed a 4-0 aggregate victory in the last 32 tie, although United finished the match with 10 men after Eric Bailly was dismissed for two yellow cards in quick succession. Manager Jose Mourinho will face an anxious wait ahead of Sunday's English League Cup final against Southampton at Wembley to see if his Armenian playmaker is fit. Mkhitaryan has been involved in five goals -- scoring three and creating two -- in his last six games and would have been a likely starter at Wembley. Despite leading 3-0 from the first leg at Old Trafford last week, Mourinho showed how highly he values success in this competition -- which offers a route into next season's Champions League to the winners -- by picking a strong starting line-up. Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba were restored to the starting line-up after making a decisive contribution off the bench against Blackburn in the FA Cup on Sunday -- the Frenchman teeing up the Swede to score the winning goal. There was none of the early match defensive jitters from United, and centre-back Bailly in particular, that had brought a rebuke from Mourinho following the first leg in which he accused his players of not having been focussed enough. And it took just 16 minutes for United to extinguish any fanciful hopes the hosts might have harboured of mounting a memorable comeback -- when the opening goal came, it was almost too easy. Juan Mata used Daley Blind as a decoy to make space for himself down the left and his pinpoint cross was met by Mkhitaryan, dissecting the home centre-halves, to flick past the helpless Stephane Ruffier in the home goal. By then the visitors had already established control of the ball in midfield and looked comfortable spraying it around patiently. Mourinho was forced into an early change as Mkhitaryan seemed to tweak his hamstring and was replaced by Marcus Rashford on 25 minutes. United looked by far the more dangerous of the two sides but St Etienne did sound a warning from a set-piece seven minutes from the break as Jordan Veretout picked out Loic Perrin, only for the captain to head straight at Sergio Romero, celebrating his 30th birthday. It was, at least, the Ligue 1 side's first effort on target over the two legs. Roared on by a passionate home crowd at the Stade Geoffroy Guichard, St Etienne played with energy at the start of the second half but it was United who should have doubled their lead as Marouane Fellaini fired into the side-netting when well placed. Things got interesting just after the hour mark as Bailly was sent-off for picking up two bookings in three minutes -- the second when he clearly won the ball in a challenge with Romain Hamouma -- much to Mourinho's obvious annoyance. Mourinho had to quickly rejig, with centre-back Marcus Rojo replacing Mata and United shutting up shop. St Etienne were reduced to Florentin Pogba, Paul's brother, trying his luck with a volley from 30 yards that sailed wide, summing up their impotency in front of goal over the two legs. Rashford's pace was causing St Etienne problems and he clipped a ball over the top from Blind across the face of goal. Tougher nights in Europe than this await United, but at least it gave them a chance to quickly turn their attention to Southampton."
16,21/02/2017,16:40,Saint-Etienne need dash of 'madness' against United,Saint-Etienne believe they are capable of reversing a Europa League first leg deficit against Zlatan Ibrahimovic's Manchester United if they can add a dash of 'madness' to their game.,"At 3-0 down from the Old Trafford first leg all scored by nemesis Ibrahimovic, few are betting on a French revival in Wednesday's last 32 second leg at the club's Geoffroy-Guichard stadium. But club President Bernard Caïazzo told AFP in an exclusive interview that a win was possible ""if we can inject a bit of madness"" into the match. ""The result from the first leg was very heavy because we did not put away our chances and there was some odd refereeing going on, a bit like if Zlatan Ibrahimovic himself was the referee,"" he said. ""But this time, unlike in the first leg where the players were a bit tense and made finishing errors, we have nothing to lose."" ""Football can offer incredible surprises,"" he said. ""Putting a bit of madness into our game means nothing is impossible."" He said the team needs to rediscover the spirit of the 1974 European Cup, predecessor of the Champions League, when the side went 4-1 down to Hadjuk Split in the away leg and beat them 5-1 after extra time on home turf. Saint-Etienne went on to reach the semi-finals where they were beaten by eventual champions Bayern Munich. Saint-Etienne striker Romain Hamouma said the side had to avoid an obsession with Ibrahimovic, the former Paris Saint-Germain star who has now scored 17 goals all told against Saint-Etienne. ""His record against us is exceptional,"" he said ""He is a great player but we cannot let ourselves become obsessed by one player alone."" Saint-Etienne are still upset over the penalty awarded to Ibrahimovic in the closing minutes of the Manchester leg after he slumped to his knees in the box following a challenge from behind, allowing him to score his first hat-trick for United. ""As soon as the 'great' one falls, the referee feels he has to whistle,"" added Hamouma. He said that Saint-Etienne had found weaknesses in Manchester United but were not able to exploit them because of poor finishing. ""This time we have to make no mistake, and that will be the key."" Coach Christophe Galtier said that if his players kept their cool the chances would come their way."
17,17/02/2017,15:57,St Etienne charged over Old Trafford flares,European football's governing body UEFA said on Friday it has opened disciplinary proceedings against St Etienne over crowd unrest in their Europa League clash at Manchester United.,"The French Ligue 1 club's fans are accused of setting off fireworks, throwing objects and improper conduct during the last 32 first leg encounter at Old Trafford on Thursday. UEFA's control, ethics and disciplinary board will hear the case on March 23, a statement said. Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a hat-trick as United ran out 3-0 winners, taking his tally for the season to 23 goals. The second leg in St Etienne will be on Wednesday."
18,15/02/2017,12:31,"The Pogbas, brothers turned sibling rivals",A family football story born on the pitches of Paris's eastern suburbs arrives at Old Trafford on Thursday as brothers Paul and Florentin Pogba face off in the Europa League.,"""The day has come,"" says elder brother Florentin, a defender with Saint-Etienne. ""We're going to face each other on the pitch, rather than on our neighbourhood mini-pitch."" The two Pogbas' lives have veered in different directions since their childhood scraps on a synthetic pitch in Roissy-en-Brie, 24 kilometres (15 miles) from the centre of the French capital. Paul, 23 and capped 44 times by France, is the world's most expensive footballer following his return to Manchester United from Juventus for a fee of £89.3 million ($111 million, 105.2 million euros). Florentin, 26, opted to represent Guinea at international level and has an estimated transfer value of three million euros according to the respected Transfermarkt website. United are the richest club in the world. Saint-Etienne are not even the richest club in the Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region, where Lyon are the local powerhouse. ""Even if United are a great club, anything is possible in football,"" Florentin told the UEFA website this week. ""The fact they're better than us on paper doesn't matter."" Florentin has become accustomed to watching his little brother win from afar and the chances are he will have an opportunity to do so up close in Thursday's last 32 first leg. Saint-Etienne may be fifth in Ligue 1 and United sixth in the Premier League, but Jose Mourinho's star-studded team have gone 16 league games without defeat. It will be up to Florentin and his team-mates to try to prevent United settling into a rhythm that is often set by Paul's driving runs and passes to Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Florentin has not been a regular starter this season, but in recent weeks Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier has found a place for him at left-back. With Paul playing in central midfield, their paths may not cross too often, but with both players comfortably over six feet tall (183 centimetres), any clashes could be seismic. ""If he arrives at full pelt and I have to tackle him, I will,"" Florentin told French television show Telefoot. ""I'm not going to knock him out -- he's my brother -- but if I have to commit a foul, I'll do it."" For Pogba Jnr., the game represents another opportunity to prove himself as a big-game player. A guaranteed starter, he has played a leading role in United's current resurgence, but remains without a league goal or assist in 2017. ""In terms of being the world's most expensive player, I think he has put that to one side because it's more an issue for the media,"" says Florentin, whose twin brother, Mathias, plays for Sparta Rotterdam. ""He's just playing his football, even though everything he does gets three or four times more attention, good or bad. He can handle all of that because of the mental strength he has had since his youth. ""He is quite irritable though. He doesn't like to lose. His head starts buzzing when he loses. I learnt to lose and I would say that you're not losing, but learning. But for him, when he loses, he goes mad."" United's other France international, Anthony Martial, knows defeat will be hard to take for whichever brother ends up on the losing side. ""They are well known for being big jokers and mickey-takers, but once they are on the field, it will be like two warriors who are going all-out to win the game,"" Martial told the United website. ""If one beats the other, he'll immediately start giving out loads of stick so they'll be desperate to do all they can to win!"" Florentin adds: ""My parents will have mixed feelings because whatever happens there will be one winner and one loser. However, there are two winners because this game will be an unforgettable occasion."""
19,13/02/2017,17:54,Martial relishing renewed Saint-Etienne rivalry,Anthony Martial has more reason than most of his Manchester United team-mates for wanting to score against French club Saint-Etienne in Thursday's Europa League tie at Old Trafford.,"Martial, 21, made his way in football as a youth player with Lyon, arch domestic rivals of Saint-Etienne. The France winger never played in the senior derby fixture but would love to be on target against Saint-Etienne on Thursday, even though a goal would cost United 10 million euros ($10.6 million) given a clause in their deal with Monaco, the club from which they signed Martial. ""There was a huge rivalry while I was still at Lyon,"" Martial told United's website. ""It was always a highly charged atmosphere and they were usually massive games, the kind all players love to play in. ""So there will be that added competitive edge whenever I play against them. ""We know it will be a difficult match but if we play with all our quality, I think we can do good things. ""Of course, it would be great if I could score against them again, but I hope we can win the game because that's the most important thing, then it would be a bonus if I managed to grab a goal."" Thursday's match is set to see United's Paul Pogba up against elder brother Florentin, who plays in defence for Saint-Etienne. ""They are well known for being big jokers and mickey-takers but, once they are on the field, it will be like two warriors who are going all out to win the game,"" Martial said. ""If one beats the other, he'll immediately start giving out loads of stick so they'll be desperate to do all they can to win!"""

""I want two draws between my children, I don't want anyone to lose, even if I know that unfortunately one will be eliminated,"" said Yeo Moriba, who plans to attend both legs of February's knockout tie. Jose Mourinho's United will be heavy favourites to advance but Moriba added her sons ""are very happy to cross paths on the pitch"". Paul Pogba, 23, became the world's most expensive player when he rejoined United from Juventus for a record 89 million pounds (105 million euros, $116 million) in August. Elder brother Florentin is three years older and represents Guinea, the country of his birth, along with twin brother and Sparta Rotterdam forward Mathias at international level."

""That's a nice thing,"" said Mourinho at a press conference on Monday. ""Paul was already laughing about it and for sure his brother is also laughing. ""It has happened a few times in the history football and it's a nice thing."" The teams met in the now defunct Cup Winners' Cup first round in 1977, with United winning 3-1 on aggregate. On that occasion, United were forced to host the second leg in the southern English city of Plymouth, 450 kilometres away, following crowd trouble in the first leg in France. Mourinho's men finished second in Group A behind Fenerbahce of Turkey while Saint-Etienne topped Group C. After also having to go to Ukraine to face Zorya Luhansk in the group stage, United's Portuguese manager is pleased that there will be no long away trip this time. ""The good thing is the travel distance. We were very unlucky in the group phase, we had to go very far, it was very difficult to go to Turkey, Ukraine,"" he said. ""Now we go to France because the flight is easy and it's not an easy period, there are lots of games, so that is good."" Saint-Etienne, 10-time French champions and European Cup runners-up in 1976, are currently eighth in Ligue 1. ""Saint-Etienne is an historic old club with lots of tradition. People of my generation will never forget that (Michel) Platini team and it will be difficult because every team now is a good team in the competition. ""For sure, Manchester United is one of the big names in the competition but we have two months without the Europa League, two months to forget it, then we will see."" The other Premier League representative, Tottenham Hotspur, will face Gent of Belgium after being eliminated from the Champions League at the group stage. Villarreal of Spain will face Italian giants Roma in one of the standout ties, while Bundesliga club Borussia Moenchengladbach were drawn against Fiorentina of Italy. The first legs will be played on Thursday, February 16, with the return matches a week later."

The incident came after a 1-0 defeat at Azerbaijan in early October. According to the Norwegian FA, Selnaes told a FIFA disciplinary committee: ""After the game I walked off the pitch and into the tunnel, where the linesmen were standing. ""As I passed him on my way to the changing room, I said to him, 'You referees whistled on everything, you are so fucking bad.' ""That was all."" Selnaes subsequently apologised but said he was disappointed by the punishment, which he described as ""unreasonable,"" according to a Norwegian statement. The Norwegian Federation has asked FIFA for clarifications before deciding whether to appeal. Norway are fourth in Group C, behind leaders Germany, Azerbaijan and Northern Ireland and with their 2018 hopes in the balance."
23,29/04/2016,02:20,Quartet scrapping for Champions League berths in France,"While Paris Saint-Germain have long since had the Ligue 1 title wrapped up, the battle for Champions League qualification beneath them is only intensifying in the final weeks of the French season.","Just two points separate Lyon in second from Saint-Etienne in fifth with three matches remaining, including a crucial set of fixtures this Saturday. Lyon sit second ahead of Monaco on goal difference, with Nice and Saint-Etienne both two points back. Only second carries with it automatic qualification for next season's Champions League group stage, with the team in third facing entry in the third qualifying round in late July. Monaco are desperate to avoid that fate after losing to Valencia in the Champions League play-offs at the start of this season, but their form has dipped rather alarmingly of late. Leonardo Jardim's side have won only two of their last eight matches, allowing Lyon to catch them up thanks to six wins and two draws over the same period. The two teams meet each other in a huge game on the penultimate weekend of the season, but first Monaco entertain Guingamp at the Stade Louis II on Saturday just before Lyon entertain relegation-threatened Gazelec Ajaccio. ""It is a decisive match, a bit like a semi-final. There will be something to play for at Lyon only if we win against Guingamp,"" said Monaco coach Jardim, whose side drew 1-1 at Rennes last weekend. ""The fact OL are favourites now changes nothing. There are four of us fighting for second place and all the teams will give everything to get it. ""The draw against Rennes doesn't change much. We are still obliged to win our next three matches. If we do that we will finish second."" Lyon, whose leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette has this week been linked with a move to Barcelona, will look to defend their unbeaten record at their new Parc OL when they host Gazelec. ""It is a very important match and we are really concentrated on it. We are not thinking about the match against Monaco,"" said midfielder Corentin Tolisso. ""Everything depends on a victory on Saturday. We need to be in front of them before playing Monaco."" With Hatem Ben Arfa in the form of his life, Nice have lost just once -- to PSG -- in their last seven games and go to Nantes looking to keep alive their hopes of a first podium finish since 1976. Ben Arfa, who has scored 17 Ligue 1 goals this season, has been nominated for the player of the year award in France along with PSG duo Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Angel Di Maria and Marseille midfielder Lassana Diarra. Nice need points before hosting Saint-Etienne next weekend, before which Les Verts entertain Toulouse on Saturday. Christophe Galtier's side are bidding to secure a fourth consecutive top-five finish and are on a run of five successive wins, all without conceding a goal. PSG's win against Lille last weekend ensured fifth place would bring with it a Europa League berth, while sixth will also offer European qualification if PSG beat Marseille in the French Cup final next month. Lille, who visit Lorient on Saturday, are currently sixth, one point ahead of Rennes, who go to Paris on Friday. Champions PSG can equal their own record for the most points in a Ligue 1 season with a win against Rennes after a week in which several stars used their days off to take a mini break in Las Vegas. ""My players do what they want. They had three days off, I gave them to them, and I think that's a good thing,"" coach Laurent Blanc said in response to media criticism after Ibrahimovic and Javier Pastore were among those who visited Vegas."
24,22/04/2016,02:35,Race for Europe enters home straight in France,The battle for European places in France's Ligue 1 is set to come down to the wire with just four matches of the season remaining and several teams still in the running.,"Monaco reclaimed second place from Lyon last weekend after a 2-1 win over Marseille, while Bruno Genesio's men slipped to third after being held 1-1 by fellow Champions League hopefuls Nice. Four straight wins have fired Saint-Etienne back into contention along with Lille, who were at one stage in a relegation scrap before reeling off six victories in succession. Rennes' charge has been slowed by back-to-back defeats but the Bretons still harbour realistic hopes of qualifying for the Europa League, although their challenge could peter out should they lose to Monaco on Sunday. ""There's a scent of Europe. I'm sure that everything is still possible. We're a bit behind our direct rivals (...) but a victory against Monaco would put us back in the mix,"" said Rennes goalkeeper Benoit Costil. Monaco, meanwhile, still must go to Lyon on the penultimate weekend of the season which could determine the destination of France's second automatic Champions League qualifying spot behind runaway title-winners Paris Saint-Germain. Last weekend's draw at Parc OL, in which Lyon played for over an hour with 10 men, snapped a five-game winning run at home for OL, who will aim to respond on Saturday at relegation-threatened Toulouse. The visitors will be without the suspended Maxwel Cornet, while time is running out for Toulouse with three points separating them from safety despite a mini-revival under Pascal Dupraz. Nice coach Claude Puel felt it was a case of two points lost at Lyon and said beating struggling Reims on Friday was imperative if they are to remain on course for Europe's premier club competition. ""The peak of our season is on Friday. If we're not good against Reims, it's not even worth talking about the other matches, whether it's those of our opponents or our own,"" said Puel, whose side also face fifth-place Saint-Etienne in week 37. Saint-Etienne, who are level on points with Nice, have based their recent success on an impenetrable defence and host Lorient on Sunday, while Lille won't face Angers until next Wednesday with Frederic Antonetti's side taking on PSG in the League Cup final at the Stade de France this weekend. Crisis-hit Marseille enjoyed a rare highlight in a disastrous season as they set up a showdown with bitter rivals PSG in next month's French Cup final following Wednesday's 1-0 victory at second-tier Sochaux. However, they remain just six points clear of the bottom three and will hope interim coach Franck Passi, who has stepped in after the dismissal of Michel, can finally bring about an end to their 14-game winless run at the Stade Velodrome against Nantes. Gazelec Ajaccio host Bastia in a Corsican derby given added importance in light of the top-flight newcomers' battle to avoid an immediate return to Ligue 2. Gazelec have won just once since the turn of the year and find themselves trailing 17th-place Reims by two points, with games against Lyon and PSG still to come. Fixtures (kick-off times GMT)"
25,04/03/2016,02:20,PSG focus on Chelsea ahead of Montpellier visit,Paris Saint-Germain head into Saturday's clash at home to a resurgent Montpellier with most eyes firmly fixated on next week's return leg at Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League.,"PSG rebounded from losing their 46-game unbeaten domestic run at Lyon last weekend by remaining on course to defend their French Cup crown after beating Saint-Etienne 3-1 in midweek. However, victory at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard potentially came at a cost with midfielder Blaise Matuidi facing a race against time to be fit for Wednesday's trip to Stamford Bridge. The France international was seen clutching his hamstring after he was taken off ""as a precaution"" midway through the second half, with Laurent Blanc admitting he was ""worried"" about Matuidi's fitness. Blanc will have to decide whether or not to rest key players ahead of the Chelsea clash, with Marco Verratti (groin) and Angel Di Maria (thigh) also struggling with injuries. The PSG boss though was pleased with the manner in which the runaway Ligue 1 leaders responded at Saint-Etienne after suffering their first defeat of the season. ""We can't erase (the loss), but we can use it to our advantage. That's what we did (on Wednesday) and I'm very happy about it. It was a good way to respond after the defeat which provoked quite a buzz,"" said Blanc, in quotes published by French daily L'Equipe. ""Montpellier will be a difficult match because we'll be thinking about the game against Chelsea which will be huge,"" said PSG captain Thiago Silva, with 2012 French champions Montpellier arriving in the capital on the back of three straight wins to pull clear of relegation trouble. ""We're ready for Chelsea. I think everyone knows what awaits us over there. I hope (Matuidi) will be able to play because he's an important player for the team,"" the Brazilian added. Defeat at Lyon means Paris can't clinch a fourth straight French title this weekend, but they could do so next week should Monaco slip up at fellow European hopefuls Caen on Friday. Monaco have lost just once in 15 league outings and have an eight-point cushion over Caen, who trail third-place Lyon on goal difference, in the race for the second automatic Champions League qualifying berth. Four wins in five has reignited Lyon's campaign and Bruno Genesio's side will bid to build on recent momentum when Guingamp visit Parc OL in Sunday's late game. A four-match winless run has slowed Nice's European charge, but they will fancy their chances of ending that series at home to bottom side Troyes on Saturday. Rennes and Nantes, unbeaten in the league since November, meet in the Brittany derby with both sides also firmly in the hunt for Europe, while Saint-Etienne travel to slumping Angers. Pascal Dupraz will embark on the daunting task of trying to salvage Toulouse's top-flight status having replaced Dominique Arribage ahead of Sunday's trip to Marseille. Toulouse are 10 points from safety and without a win in eight, but there is hope as Marseille have struggled mightily at the Stade Velodrome with just two wins all season and none in their last 11 home fixtures.

26,02/03/2016,23:33,Ibrahimovic drives PSG into French Cup semis,Zlatan Ibrahimovic pulled the strings as Paris Saint Germain cruised into the French Cup semi-finals on Wednesday with a 3-1 away win at Saint Etienne.,"The result saw PSG bounce back from their first domestic defeat in a year, a 2-1 league loss at Lyon at the weekend, with goals from Edinson Cavani, Marquinhos and late substitute Lucas. Ahead of their crucial Champions League return match at Chelsea next week however key midfielder Blaise Matuidi limped off with a thigh injury in the second half. Paris coach Laurent Blanc had told his players their weekend performance was not good enough and had demanded application, which he seemed happy with afterwards. ""It's difficult to win here. But really it's rare you see a team win so easily at Saint Etienne,"" he told French television. ""PSG warranted their win. It's an experienced side, and even if they went missing at Lyon they showed up and did a job tonight."" Ibrahimovic carved open the home defence for the opener on 12 minutes with a perfectly weighted pass which his Uruguayan strike partner Cavani ran onto and smacked home with great relish. The giant Swede was at the heart of the second goal on 35 minutes too when Marquinhos tapped in at the far post after a fine team move, as a vicious cross from Ibrahimovic was flicked on toward the back post by Cavani. A spirited Saint Etienne, pumped up by 36,000 boisterous fans, hit back when a Valentin Eyserric penalty reduced the arrears to 2-1 just before the break. PSG were easing out the game when late substitute Lucas dribbled past several defenders and fired home the clincher two minutes into added time. Defending champions PSG have won the Coupe de France on nine occasions, second only to arch-rivals and ten-time winner Marseille, who play fifth tier Granville on Thursday. In an all top-flight quarter final earlier Wednesday, Lorient, on the back of two league wins, cruised past Gazalec Ajaccio 3-0. After first half goals from Romain Philippoteaux and Maxime Barthelme, Pape Paye finished the job with a late strike. The shock of the evening came when second division Sochaux made the semi-finals when they put an end to top flight Nantes' 16-game unbeaten run. Nantes had been leading for most of the game before Moussa Sow got an equaliser in the 87th minute to send the game into extra-time. Substitute Sekou Cissé made it 2-1 against the run of play before Sow sealed the win for the former Peugeot factory side and despite a late consolation from the Brazilian Adryan Socahux are into the final four.

27,21/02/2016,16:44,Batshuayi strikes late to save Marseille's blushes,Michy Batshuayi scored five minutes into injury time to rescue a point for Marseille in a 1-1 draw at home to Saint-Etienne on Sunday.,"The Belgian forward had come off the bench 15 minutes from the end and headed home a Romain Alessandrini free-kick with virtually the last touch of the ball. It was only five minutes from time that St Etienne thought they had scored the potentially winning goal that would have sent them above Nice into third place in Ligue 1 -- the final Champions League qualifying spot. Kevin Monnet-Paquet shot home left-footed from Romain Hamouma's pass. The draw barely helps either side as St Etienne could lose fourth spot to Lyon or Rennes later on Sunday while Marseille are 10th and still five points behind Nice in the tight race to qualify for Europe's premier club competition. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain maintained their 24-point lead at the top with a 4-1 victory over lowly Reims as Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a brace. They now need only three more wins and a draw from their final 11 matches to win the Ligue 1 title. Monaco remain second and determined to delay PSG's inevitable crowning as French champions after a 3-1 win over rock-bottom Troyes sent them eight points clear of Nice, who drew 0-0 at Bordeaux on Friday night."
28,19/02/2016,02:20,Reims out to inflict European hangover on PSG,"Unbeaten runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain return to Ligue 1 duty against struggling Reims on Saturday, four days after earning a narrow first-leg advantage over Chelsea in the Champions League last 16.","Edinson Cavani made an immediate impact as a substitute on Tuesday by netting a 78th-minute winner at the Parc des Princes after John Obi Mikel had cancelled out Zlatan Ibrahimovic's deflected free-kick to hand Laurent Blanc's side a 2-1 edge. The Uruguayan has started just twice in the league in 2016 after losing his place as a regular starter, but Cavani could well return to the line-up with Blanc preparing to rotate his side this weekend. Reims are one of the few teams to frustrate PSG this season, with the capital club needing another late goal from Cavani to rescue a point in a 1-1 draw back in September. ""Even if it's PSG, a big European team, we're not going there as victims. We always want to show what we're capable of doing against the big teams,"" said Reims defender Abdelhamid El Kaoutari. ""I think (the outcome) will depend on what Paris have to offer. If it's the PSG from Tuesday (against Chelsea), there are few teams who can stand up to them,"" added Reims coach Olivier Guegan, whose side enter the weekend two points above the drop zone. Paris on the other hand are unbeaten in 35 league games and cruising towards a fourth straight French title, with a mammoth 24-point gap separating themselves and nearest challengers Monaco, who are at home to bottom side Troyes this weekend. Lyon were in crisis mode less than a month ago, but three convincing wins in a row have propelled Bruno Genesio's side right back into contention for a top-three finish. OL travel to Lille on Sunday with the visitors trailing third-place Nice and bitter rivals Saint-Etienne by just a point in the race for France's final Champions League berth. ""It's the start of a run we have to continue with a couple of difficult matches coming up. We have to keep on working with the same spirit,"" said Genesio in the wake of last weekend's 4-1 demolition of Caen. Lyon will be without influential midfielder Corentin Tolisso for several weeks after he hurt his hamstring in training, but there was a welcome sight as Nabil Fekir, out since September with a knee injury, stepped up his road to recovery in midweek. Saint-Etienne secured a 3-2 victory at home to Basel in the last 32 of the Europa League on Thursday having thrown away a two-goal lead, with Christophe Galtier's men facing a quick turnaround as they head to Marseille this weekend. Early-season surprise packages Angers and Caen will bid to turn around their fading fortunes at home to Montpellier and Rennes respectively, with both sides losers of their last three matches. Toulouse, currently eight points from safety, can ill-afford another defeat as they risk being cut further adrift when they take on 18th-placed Gazelec Ajaccio. Meanwhile, Bastia's match at home to in-form Nantes, planned for Saturday, has been postponed following violent clashes between fans and police in Corsica.

29,14/02/2016,19:53,Love delivers as Monaco snatch Valentine's Day point,"Brazilian striker Vagner Love chose Valentine's Day to deliver his first goal in France's Ligue 1 on Sunday, earning Monaco a crucial point in a 1-1 draw at Saint-Etienne.","The result leaves Monaco on 46 points in second place in Ligue 1, which is an automatic Champions League qualifying berth, six points clear of Saint-Etienne in third. Lyon, Nice and Nantes are all a further point back and Nice can move back into third with a win at home to Marseille later on Sunday. Saint-Etienne had needed extra-time to beat struggling Troyes and make the French Cup quarter-finals in midweek, but were in buoyant mood after winning their last two league games. Christophe Galtier's men are strong at home and Monaco 'keeper Danijel Subasic made several key saves as the principality side weathered first-half pressure. But the Croatian shot-stopper was wrong-footed as Senegalese defender Moustapha Sall produced a towering header to open the scoring on 57 minutes. Thomas Lemar, Love and Helder Costa all missed glaring chances as Monaco threw caution to the wind looking for an equaliser. But the dogged visitors eventually earned a point on 84 minutes when the 31-year-old Love, who joined from Corinthians in the January transfer window, stabbed home in a chaotic goalmouth scramble. The Valentine's Day goal from Love left Saint-Etienne coach Galtier feeling bittersweet. ""We didn't take our chances when we were on top -- we lost two points due to a weak 10 minutes. It's a shame for the players and the fans, but it's exciting what with the Cup and a late run up the league,"" he said. Earlier on Sunday Lyon recorded their third successive big win, thumping Caen 4-1 to further boost their hopes of snatching Champions League qualification from a frustrating season. Samuel Umtiti, Alexandre Lacazette, Maxwell Cornet and Corentin Tolisso all scored for OL with Andy Delort replying for Caen as Lyon bounced back from their 3-0 defeat at Paris Saint-Germain in the French Cup during the week. Bruno Genesio's side had won 3-0 against both Bordeaux and Angers in their previous two league outings and along with Saint-Etienne will hope to give Monaco a run for second spot. On Saturday, runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain extended their record-breaking unbeaten league run to 35 matches but they had to settle for a point in a 0-0 draw at home to Lille in their final outing before facing Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday. PSG coach Laurent Blanc rested the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Thiago Silva, Thiago Motta and Maxwell, while Edinson Cavani missed their best chance, somehow blasting off target with the goal gaping after Lille 'keeper Vincent Enyeama dropped a cross. The capital club are an enormous 24 points clear of Monaco in second. Among Saturday's other games, Nantes beat Lorient 2-1 to make it 15 games unbeaten between league and cup. The Canaries are right in contention for European qualification."
30,03/02/2016,21:14,Lacazette fires Lyon past Bordeaux,Alexandre Lacazette struck twice as Lyon secured a welcome 3-0 win over Bordeaux in Ligue 1 on Wednesday for just their second victory in 11 matches.,"Lacazette struck four minutes prior to half-time at Parc OL before quick-fire goals from Lacazette and Aldo Kalulu late on ensured Bruno Genesio's side put an end to Bordeaux's seven-game unbeaten run. France international Mathieu Debuchy made his Bordeaux debut following his loan move from Arsenal, while Uruguayan striker Diego Rolan was twice denied by fine saves from Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. Lyon climbed back into the top half of the table, above 10th-place Bordeaux on goal difference, and are six points adrift of the Champions League spots. Nice leapfrogged Angers into third as Hatem Ben Arfa grabbed his 11th goal of the campaign in a 1-0 win over Toulouse, while 10-man Angers were beaten 2-1 at Reims. Nantes extended their unbeaten streak to 10 matches following a 3-1 victory over Gazelec Ajaccio, Guingamp condemned lowly Troyes to a 4-0 defeat and Lille earned a 1-0 win over Caen. Runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain can break Nantes' 20-year-old record unbeaten run in Ligue 1 later when they host Lorient. Laurent Blanc's side stretched their streak without a loss to 32 matches with Sunday's 2-0 victory at Saint-Etienne and can claim the top-flight record outright if they avoid defeat at the Parc des Princes. On Tuesday, Monaco tightened their grip on second place with a 2-0 win at home to Bastia, while 10-man Marseille claimed a 1-0 victory at Montpellier to push their unbeaten run in the league to 11 matches."
31,02/02/2016,16:03,Gourcuff still not fit to return for Rennes,Injury-plagued former France midfielder Yoann Gourcuff will not return for Rennes' clash with Saint Etienne on Thursday.,"The 29-year-old has only seen 15 minutes of action since joining Rennes from Lyon at the end of last season. Manager Rolland Courbis does not want to risk bringing the former AC Milan and Bordeaux man back too early. ""It's a logical decision to make. Everything is going well, but there was still some doubt (about his fitness) just 24 hours ago,"" Courbis said. ""It would be asking too much to bring him back straight after a 4-0 defeat (at Bordeaux)."" When Gourcuff, who started his career at Rennes, returned to Roazhon Park last year he was struggling with a thigh injury, and he finally made his debut as a substitute against Lorient last month. But he suffered an ankle injury, his 15th injury in just over three years, in an accidental collision with a team-mate in that match and is yet to feature again since. That was to be the only time he played under Philippe Montanier, the coach who signed him, as former Montpellier boss Courbis has now taken over the reins. ""If you listened to him, it was seem obvious that he would play the next day"", Courbis added. ""His enthusiasm is intact and his desire to play is huge. But it will take more than a week or a few days. ""When Yoann returns, likely against Lille or even later against Angers, it will be in a key position and not just as a substitute for the last quarter of an hour, as would be the case for a young debutant."" Rennes currently sit sixth in the Ligue 1 table, just three points off the third and final Champions League spot. Despite Gourcuff's latest setback Courbis is nearing a full-strength squad after the returns to fitness of Mexer and Paul-Georges N'Tep."
32,01/02/2016,11:32,PSG set to break record unbeaten run,Paris Saint Germain take on Lorient at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday needing only to avoid defeat to break Nantes' 20-year-old record unbeaten run in Ligue 1.,"The runaway league leaders saw off a stubborn Saint Etienne 2-0 on Sunday to notch a 13th consecutive win and extend their streak without a loss to 32 matches. They have totally dominated French football in the last few years, but this season they have found a higher level as their rivals have fallen away. Laurent Blanc's men are now a staggering 24 points clear of second-placed Monaco after the principality outfit were well-beaten at surprise package Angers. Lorient should not pose much of a threat to PSG's record bid, although manager Blanc may choose to ring the changes after a run of five games in a fortnight. The luxury of the depth of the Frenchman's squad is far greater than any other manager in the division can enjoy, but Blanc said after Sunday's match that he does mention records to his expensively-assembled group of players. ""There's been a great deal of talk about the record and it helped me motivate the players, even if they don't really need that,"" Blanc said. ""I ask a lot from the players, I demand it. And what I take away tonight as much as the record is the way this team never gives up."" PSG were pushed hard for long periods by a feisty Les Verts before closing out victory with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's sixth league brace this term. The defending champions will be without the injured defending trio of Thiago Silva, David Luiz and Gregory van der Wiel for the visit of Lorient, but it is hard to see Sylvain Ripoll's men throwing much caution to the wind in the capital. Monaco currently occupy second place in the table despite having a nine-match unbeaten run ended by a comprehensive loss at third-placed Angers on Saturday. Leonardo Jardim's side will be expecting to finish in the top three and qualify for a third successive Champions League campaign. They kick off the midweek programme on Tuesday evening when they host Bastia, who gave their new manager Francois Ciccolini the perfect start with victory over Lyon at the weekend. While PSG have been constructing win after win, both Lyon and Marseille have been struggling. Lyon, who were runners-up last season have now won just one of their last 10 Ligue 1 matches and new head coach Bruno Genesio will be looking for just his second win in charge when they host in-form Bordeaux on Wednesday. Marseille, meanwhile, have not won at the Velodrome in the league since September 13 against Bastia and their Spanish manager Michel is still struggling to turn the tide of negativity on the south coast. His most recent move was to bring much-maligned winger Florian Thauvin back to the club on loan from Newcastle United, and the 23-year-old could be in the lineup for the game against lowly Montpellier.

And with a yawning 21 point lead it is surely only a matter of when not if they secure a fourth consecutive league title and sixth overall. Blanc cut a contented figure after Wednesday's game, declaring: ""I'm especially happy, because no matter who plays, the team is winning. I congratulate my players."" And it appears that those players are happy in Paris with two players previously expected to leave at the end of this season, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Motta, both now looking to stay. ""I'd like to end my career in Paris,"" Motta told AFP this week, while Ibrahimovic has just accepted a telling and sizeable pay rise. As Chelsea's Champions League visit on February 16 looms the only blemish was the sight of Brazilian defender David Luiz hobbling off in stoppage time with an injured knee. PSG must travel to the Stade Geoffrey-Guichard without their fans who have been banned from attending the game after ""serious incidents between the team's respective fans in recent years"". Saint Etienne, blown away by PSG 4-1 at the Parc des Princes in October, squandered a chance to climb into the top four when they gave up a last minute goal at Reims in last Sunday's 1-1 draw. PSG's League Cup final opponents Lille routed Bordeaux 5-1 in their semi-final and will be out to continue that form at Marseille on Friday. Marseille are six points shy of the top three, with new coach Michel telling AFP: ""A podium finish is our dream, not our objective. ""If last year's side couldn't do it how can people demand of us to do it with fewer players and a smaller budget?"" Second-placed Monaco are at Angers who are dusting themselves off after last weekend's 5-1 drubbing by the runaway league leaders. Monaco's Portuguese trio Bernardo Silva, Fabio Coentrao and Helder Costa were all on target in the Principality side's 4-0 defeat of Toulouse to strengthen their hold on second place. Bastia host former multiple champions Lyon with a change of personnel in the dug out. The Corsican outfit, hovering three points above the relegation zone, sacked manager Ghislain Printant on Thursday, with assistant Francois Ciccolini stepping in as caretaker coach.

For Lyon, who exited the League Cup in midweek following a 2-1 defeat at holders Paris Saint-Germain, this latest loss simply yielded another disappointment in a season full of setbacks. ""We had a 10-second lapse of concentration for which we paid dearly,"" rued Lyon coach Bruno Genesio. ""We conceded a goal from out of nothing. It's really disappointing. ""We were up against a goalkeeper who made saves at key moments. I think we also lacked aggression in front of goal, we could've come back at the end if we'd been a bit more adventurous."" Both sides had entered Sunday's clash level on 29 points and looking to keep in touch with the European places, and it was Lyon who largely bossed the first half. On-loan striker Jean-Christophe Bahebeck tried to catch out Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes with an early free-kick, but the visitors were on top after that as Stephane Ruffier twice thwarted Rachid Ghezzal, the second stop a stunning low save just before the break. Ruffier then palmed away a Clement Grenier free-kick after half-time, before the crossbar came to Saint-Etienne's rescue as Ghezzal's cross was diverted towards his own goal by Kevin Theophile-Catherine. But it was the hosts who made the breakthrough on 76 minutes when a stray pass from Corentin Tolisso was pounced upon by Kevin Monnet-Paquet, who slipped in Soderlund for the Norwegian to notch his first goal for his new club. Earlier, Marseille snapped a four-match winless run in the league as they claimed a fifth victory in six away games. Marseille arrived at the Stade Michel d'Ornano unbeaten in seven league matches, although they had drawn their last four outings, and grabbed a 12th-minute lead when goal-line technology was used to determine that Michy Batshuayi's shot had crossed the line after coming back off the post. Batshuayi should have added a second with the goal at his mercy a few minutes later, but the Belgian atoned for that miss by setting up Georges-Kevin Nkoudou to steer in Marseille's second on the hour. Ronny Rodelin pulled one back for the hosts after beating Steve Mandanda to a free-kick, but Bouna Sarr erased any hopes of a comeback as he volleyed home Alaixys Romao's inviting cross on 83 minutes. The victory pushed Marseille up to eighth, five points adrift of third-place Angers, with Caen dropping to seventh. Monaco moved back into second place in the table after winning 2-0 at Lorient to stretch their unbeaten run in the league to eight games. Thomas Lemar gave Monaco a 53rd-minute lead in Brittany before Joao Moutinho curled home an exquisite free-kick to leave Leonardo Jardim's men 21 points behind runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain. PSG recorded their ninth consecutive win in all competitions and extended their club record unbeaten league run to 30 matches dating back to last March as Zlatan Ibrahimovic's 73rd-minute strike was enough for them to see off Toulouse 1-0 on Saturday."

That result allowed Lyon to climb back into the top six, and they make the short trip to the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard above Les Verts on goal difference, with just four points separating them from Monaco in the third and final Champions League qualifying berth. Lyon lost in midweek, going down 2-1 away to Paris Saint-Germain in the League Cup quarter-finals, but Genesio was happy with the display from a much-changed side. ""I always said that I had confidence in my team,"" he insisted. ""We need to be lucid about what we are capable of doing, but we need to be capable of repeating that performance."" Lyon's best performance this season came when they trounced Saint-Etienne 3-0 at home in November with Alexandre Lacazette scoring a hat-trick. Christophe Galtier's side have finished in the top five in each of the last three campaigns but their prospects of doing so again this year have been undermined by nine defeats already this season, including a 2-1 loss at Nantes last weekend. ""This league is dangerous and there might be a lot of surprises. I hope we will quickly get to 42 points and finish the season well,"" said Galtier in the wake of the Nantes setback as he admitted the first aim had to be guaranteeing survival in a tight division. Galtier has moved to strengthen his squad this month with the arrival of Norway striker Alexander Soderlund from Rosenborg being followed by that this week of Moroccan-born winger Oussama Tannane from Dutch side Heracles. Tannane serves a suspension this weekend and skipper Loic Perrin is still injured for the home side, while Lyon captain Maxime Gonalons is out but Mathieu Valbuena could return. Runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain are a huge 20 points clear of second-placed Angers before going to Toulouse on Saturday. It will be the first of three meetings between the clubs in 11 days as they will clash at the Parc des Princes in the French Cup next Tuesday and then again in the League Cup semi-finals at the end of the month. Laurent Blanc's side have not lost any of their last 36 domestic outings, a run stretching back 10 months. Toulouse, meanwhile, are in the relegation zone but they have lost just one of their last nine games. ""To play three matches against PSG is nice. We need to be prepared.

PSG won 3-0 at fourth-placed Caen on Saturday to set a new record of 51 points at the halfway stage of the season after an unbeaten first 19 matches during the current campaign. PSG also set a club-record 28-match unbeaten league run after expensive stars Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Angel di Maria both hit the target in Caen. Monaco are second after a 0-0 draw at winless and rock bottom Troyes on Saturday took them a point clear of Angers. St Etienne, who have struggled for form this season, moved up to sixth, just three points behind Monaco in the congested race for the European places. ""I'm not looking at the top of the table because we're also rather too close for comfort to the relegation zone,"" Saints coach Christophe Galtier admitted after the game. ""Today's win was a key result, we really needed those three points,"" he added. Hubert Fournier may have overseen his last game at Lyon, who were last year's surprise package but who have flopped this season as they prepare to move into their new stadium in the new year sitting in mid-table and having been knocked out of all European competition. The coach and his club President Jean Michel Aulas were stone faced after watching Lyon lose 2-1 at tiny Gazelec Ajaccio, where Mohamed Larbi scored twice before Clement Grenier pulled a goal back late on. Later on Sunday, 2009 champions Bordeaux host the team that succeeded them a year later, Marseille, in an era before Qatari money helped PSG sweep all before them."
42,19/12/2015,20:06,Ibrahimovic wondergoal as PSG break points record,Paris Saint-Germain go into the winter break with a Ligue 1 record points haul of 51 after a 3-0 away win at Caen lit up by a thrilling Zlatan Ibrahimovic strike on Saturday.,"Already 1-0 up from an early Angel di Maria goal Ibrahimovic produced a stunning 25-yard snap-shot which flew into the top corner of the Caen goal on 36 minutes. As the stadium rose to acclaim the giant Swede for the simple power and precision of his split-second effort, even the beaten 'keeper was left smiling. The win lifted PSG to a massive 20 points clear of Angers, in action on Sunday at Saint-Etienne. It also extends the star-studded Qatar-backed club's unbeaten record in the league to 28 games since March. ""This calendar year, 2015, has been a really, really good year for PSG,"" said coach Laurent Blanc. ""But halfway through the season, records don't mean much to me,"" he warned. Summer-signing Di Maria rounded off the scoring with his sixth Ligue 1 goal since joining from Manchester United, making it 3-0 as he rounded off a slick team effort on 50 minutes. ""I was happy with the way many of the players, whose minds were on the long trips most of them were about to make. But you saw how they played, right from the off,"" said Blanc. Caen 'keeper Remy Vercoutre deserves a special mention himself after saving four stinging shots in a bewildering first-half goalmouth scramble, two of them spectacular stops with the feet from Lucas Moura and Ibrahimovic. Not to be outdone PSG's German 'keeper Kevin Trapp then saved an 84th minute penalty from Caen's Andy Delort as the champions shone in every area against a side who went into the game in fourth place. Third-place Monaco end a turbulent 2015 at Troyes later Saturday, with the bottom club still looking for a first win of the season. Among the other fixtures is a Brittany derby between Guingamp, who are in the relegation zone, and a Rennes side with just one win in their last 13 league games. Marseille will look to end a difficult year on a high note when they visit Bordeaux on Sunday night in the last match before France takes a two-week winter break over the festive period. On Friday teenager Olivier Boscagli sent Nice into the French winter break on a winning note as he struck the only goal in a 1-0 victory at home to Montpellier."
43,13/12/2015,17:30,Narrow win lifts Monaco up to second,Monaco moved provisionally into second place in Ligue 1 with a 1-0 win over Saint-Etienne on Sunday thanks to a second-half Fabinho penalty.,"The Brazilian international netted from the spot eight minutes from time to settle a dour game in the principality club's favour and lift them into second ahead of Sunday's other games. Monaco were eager to bounce back from a 4-1 hiding away to Tottenham Hotspur on Thursday that saw them eliminated from the Europa League. Leonardo Jardim's men are now unbeaten in five Ligue 1 games and move above Caen and Angers, although the latter can reclaim second when they host Bordeaux later. Monaco are also 14 points behind runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain, who defend their unbeaten domestic record this season when they host Lyon on Sunday evening. Jardim made a notable change in goal, leaving out Croatian international Danijel Subasic and handing a debut to France under-21 prospect Paul Nardi, but the latter hardly had a save to make at the Stade Louis II. Helder Costa struck the bar for the hosts in the first half before Saint-Etienne felt they should have had a penalty when Ricardo Carvalho grappled with Loic Perrin in the box. The visitors then had full-back Kevin Malcuit sent off for a second yellow card in the second half and Pierre-Yves Polomat was penalised for a handball in the box with time running out. Fabinho made no mistake from 12 yards to condemn Saint-Etienne to an eighth league defeat already this season. Sunday's other game sees Marseille host Gazelec Ajaccio looking for a win that could lift them into the top six."
44,08/11/2015,23:38,Lacazette leads Lyon to derby victory,Alexandre Lacazette returned to form in style with a hat-trick as Lyon beat bitter rivals Saint-Etienne 3-0 in the last derby meeting of the teams at the Stade de Gerland on Sunday.,"Last season's Ligue 1 player of the year Lacazette opened the scoring in the first half and added two more after the break on his 150th top-flight appearance as Lyon, who will move to a new 59,000-seat stadium early in 2016, claimed the bragging rights in the Rhone-Alpes rivalry. The victory, Lyon's third in a row in Ligue 1, allows Hubert Fournier's side to go clear in second place, although they remain 10 points adrift of unbeaten league leaders Paris Saint-Germain and also lost captain Maxime Gonalons and centre-back Samuel Umtiti to injury. Saint-Etienne, meanwhile, are fifth, behind Angers on goal difference, after a disappointing display. Lyon, who are staring at an early exit from the Champions League following a 2-0 home loss to Zenit St Petersburg in midweek, were unlucky not to get the breakthrough late in the first half when Stephane Ruffier made a double save to deny Jordan Ferri and Mathieu Valbuena. Valbuena was included in the Lyon line-up at the end of a week overshadowed by the arrest of his France colleague Karim Benzema, who was charged with complicity to blackmail and conspiring to commit a criminal act in an extortion case involving a sex tape featuring the little playmaker. He put in a lively performance but Lacazette stole the show, opening the scoring four minutes before the break when he spun away from Loic Perrin and then lifted the ball over Ruffier. Lacazette collected a Valbuena pass and worked his way into a shooting position before stabbing wide early in the second half, but he did find the net again in the 59th minute. Ruffier saved from a Rafael piledriver but Lacazette followed in to convert the rebound, and he completed his hat-trick in stoppage time when he latched on to Ferri's pass before rounding Ruffier to slot home. Scorer of a club record 27 league goals last season, he now has six goals in all competitions in this campaign and his performance was a timely reminder to France coach Didier Deschamps, who left him out of the latest national squad. ""I felt that Alexandre Lacazette was coming good in the last few days. And a hat-trick in a derby -- that does not happen all the time,"" said Fournier who was also happy to have selected Valbuena. ""Despite what has happened to him, he is happiest on the football pitch. He had already been punished enough by not being selected for the national team."" Meanwhile, Bordeaux came from behind to beat Monaco 3-1, inflicting a first defeat in 10 games on the principality side. Portuguese forward Helder Costa put the visitors ahead at the Matmut Atlantique, but Nicolas Maurice-Belay, Cedric Yambere and former Monaco midfielder Jaroslav Plasil all netted for Bordeaux. Monaco are ninth, while Bordeaux move up to 11th, above Marseille, who were beaten 1-0 at home by Mediterranean rivals Nice earlier on Sunday. Valere Germain, who was born in Marseille when his father Bruno was playing for OM and supported the club as a boy, got the only goal of the game in the 16th minute, collecting a Wallyson Mallmann pass and drilling in a low shot from range that beat Steve Mandanda and found the bottom-left corner. It was a welcome win for Nice, who were recently inspired to a fine run of form by the brilliance of Hatem Ben Arfa but made the trip along France's south coast after failing to win any of their previous three Ligue 1 outings. Claude Puel's side move up to sixth, but there was more frustration for Marseille, who have never really got going under Spanish coach Michel. After three straight wins in all competitions, this setback leaves OM in 13th place, only three points above the relegation zone. ""I am more disappointed than worried,"" said Michel, who had to make do without the injured Romain Alessandrini and the suspended Lassana Diarra, Remy Cabella and Nicolas Nkoulou. ""I don't think it was the absences that made the difference today."" PSG continued their unbeaten start to the season by thumping hapless Toulouse 5-0 on Saturday at the Parc des Princes. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice, and now has nine goals in his last six Ligue 1 appearances."

Lyon face a home tie against second-division Tours, Marseille travel to Ligue 2 outfit Bourg-en-Bresse, while three-time champions Bordeaux host Monaco. The matches will be played on December 15-16."
46,29/10/2015,02:15,Rennes betting on upset against dominant PSG,"Unbeaten Paris Saint-Germain will go 10 points clear at the top of Ligue 1, at least for 24 hours, with a win against Rennes in Brittany on Friday.","The capital club's imperial domestic form in recent times has raised the question of whether anyone can beat them in Ligue 1 this season ahead of a match brought forward to help Paris prepare for their trip to Real Madrid in the Champions League next week. Laurent Blanc's side were streets ahead of Saint-Etienne -- seen as contenders for a top-three finish -- in a 4-1 stroll at the Parc des Princes last Sunday. They are currently seven points clear of second-placed Angers and have gone 22 matches without losing in all competitions since being beaten by Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals last April. In Ligue 1, their unbeaten run covers 20 games going back to March, and few give Rennes, or anyone, a chance of ending that record right now. ""Against PSG, I get the impression that players from other teams go onto the pitch with a feeling of resignation,"" former Lyon, Paris and France goalkeeper Gregory Coupet told leading sports daily L'Equipe this week. ""For example, on Sunday for PSG v Saint-Etienne, we try to talk it up as a big match, but well...you could see that they were just trying to avoid getting hammered. ""It feels like when clubs face PSG they go into the game knowing already they won't get one point never mind three."" Rennes have gone six games without a league win, although a strong line-up secured a 1-0 victory at Bastia in the League Cup on Tuesday. ""They are superior to us in every area,"" said Rennes coach Philippe Montanier, although he remains hopeful of causing an upset. ""In one match everything is possible. If someone wants to become rich they should put a euro on us."" Javier Pastore, who missed the win over Saint-Etienne with conjunctivitis, could start for the visitors at Roazhon Park if Blanc decides to rest one of Angel Di Maria, Edinson Cavani or Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Swede, who continues to be linked with a move to MLS when his contract expires at the end of the season, has scored seven goals in his last five league games. David Luiz, who has had a knee injury, might not feature while goalkeeper Benoit Costil could return for Rennes after being injured on international duty for France last month. Angers are in action on Sunday away to Monaco, who are unbeaten in seven games and beginning to look like the side that finished third last season. Caen, currently in third, visit struggling Bastia on Saturday, while Lyon are away at winless bottom side Troyes as they seek a confidence-boosting win ahead of a crucial Champions League clash against Zenit St Petersburg. Saint-Etienne are at home to Reims as they look to bounce back from a punishing trip to Paris, and Marseille travel to Nantes on Sunday evening. Before that, Nice will seek to get back on track after a shock loss to struggling Gazelec Ajaccio when they face Lille on the Cote d'Azur. Claude Puel's side had scored 17 goals in recording four straight wins prior to that, inspired by the superb form of Hatem Ben Arfa, who is now being linked with a France recall. ""I am not going to question Hatem's quality and his talent,"" France coach Didier Deschamps told Eurosport as he refused to rule out naming the mercurial playmaker for next month's friendly matches against Germany and England. ""Why not? I will think about it based on what he has done with Nice,"" added Deschamps of Ben Arfa, who has had a chequered career but has scored seven Ligue 1 goals this season.

47,26/10/2015,00:01,PSG go seven points clear with Saint-Etienne win,Zlatan Ibrahimovic was among the scorers as Paris Saint-Germain opened up a seven-point gap over their nearest rivals at the top of Ligue 1 with a 4-1 victory over Saint-Etienne on Sunday.,"Layvin Kurzawa and Edinson Cavani netted before Ibrahimovic, PSG's all-time leading scorer, got his seventh goal in his last four matches against Saint-Etienne to put the game beyond the visitors at the Parc des Princes. Marco Verratti put through his own net to give Les Verts, who are fifth, a consolation but Lucas headed in the hosts' fourth to secure a comfortable PSG win that underlined the yawning gap between them and the rest of French football. Laurent Blanc's side have still not lost a game this season in any competition and are now undefeated in 20 Ligue 1 matches since March. That form has allowed them to move seven points clear of Angers, the newly-promoted surprise package who drew 0-0 at home to Guingamp on Saturday. Blanc made three changes to the team that drew with Real Madrid in the Champions League during the week and it was one of those players brought into the side, Kurzawa, who opened the scoring midway through the first half. The former Monaco left-back fired in a low shot from the left side of the penalty area that Saint-Etienne 'keeper Stephane Ruffier got a touch to but could not keep out. Ruffier did make a tremendous save to deny Cavani before the break but he could not prevent the Uruguayan from converting an Ibrahimovic assist three minutes after the interval for his seventh league goal of the season. Cavani returned the favour when he set up the Swedish striker to grab his seventh of the campaign midway through the second period, before a Marquinhos clearance ricocheted off Verratti and in for an own goal at the other end. However, a Lucas back-post header crossed the line despite Ruffier's attempts to keep it out as the capital club put the seal on their victory. ""To have 29 points after 11 matches is a very good thing, because some of our direct rivals have been dropping points,"" said Blanc. ""We need to try to improve our game in the league and play with greater determination so we don't get taken by surprise when it comes to the Champions League."" Earlier, Monaco closed in on the European places with a 1-0 win at Reims as Bernardo Silva got the only goal of the game against their 10-man hosts. Leonardo Jardim's team opened the scoring in the 11th minute at the Stade Auguste-Delaune when Nabil Dirar crossed from the right and the diminutive Silva got up to head in his third goal of the season at the back post. They might have added to their lead but Argentine striker Guido Carrillo hit both posts before the interval, while Jordan Siebatcheu hit the upright for Reims in stoppage time. The hosts had been reduced to 10 men midway through the second half when Antoine Devaux walked for a second yellow card, as Monaco claimed a first league win in a month to climb to eighth. ""Away from home our team is very compact and very good in the transitions,"" said Jardim. ""We tried to score the second goal, first by playing our game, and then by trying to be more direct. We were unable to put the game to bed, but I think we deserved the victory."" Marseille, meanwhile, ended a run of seven games without a win as Michy Batshuayi and Romain Alessandrini scored in a 2-1 success at Lille. Batshuayi opened the scoring late in the first half, converting his eighth goal already this season after Alessandrini's initial attempt had come back off the post. The Belgian then returned the favour in the second half, setting up Alessandrini for a superb curling finish high into the net to double Marseille's lead before Sebastien Corchia pulled a goal back for LOSC. Elsewhere on Sunday, Bordeaux recorded just their third league win of the campaign, beating winless bottom club Troyes 1-0 thanks to a late strike by 18-year-old substitute Adam Ounas."
48,04/10/2015,19:28,"Monaco held by Rennes, Caen beat Saint-Etienne","Monaco's stuttering early-season form continued as they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Rennes in Ligue 1 on Sunday, while Caen rose to third after beating Saint-Etienne.","Rennes, whose terrific start has somewhat subsided after a fourth draw in a row, took a first-half lead at the Stade Louis II through Abdoulaye Doucoure. But Monaco fought back after the break with Brazilian Wallace scoring his first goal in the French top flight to salvage a point for Leonardo Jardim's men, who also had Danijel Subasic to thank for a second-half penalty save. The principality side have now won just three of nine matches to start the campaign and sit tenth in the table, seven points behind Paris Saint-Germain ahead of their clash with bitter rivals Marseille later. Rennes broke the deadlock four minutes before the break when Monaco were caught short at the back as Doucoure slipped in between Andrea Raggi and Thomas Lemar to head past Subasic. Monaco responded six minutes into the second half as Nabil Dirar flicked on a Lemar corner with Wallace applying the finishing touch. Rennes should have regained the lead on 64 minutes after Fabinho brought down Cheikh M'Bengue in the area but Pedro Henrique saw his spot-kick kept out by Subasic. Rennes also suffered the loss of winger Paul-Georges Ntep, who was stretchered off with a hamstring injury midway through the second half - probably ruling him out of international duty with France next week. Elsewhere, Caen registered a fourth win in five as Andy Delort's 62nd-minute goal was enough to give them all three points against Saint-Etienne as Les Verts slumped to a second successive defeat, having entered the weekend in second. The result left Patrice Garande's men level with promoted Angers, just two points behind three-time reigning champions PSG. Lorient rallied from a goal down to beat Bordeaux 3-2 with Benjamin Moukandjo, Majeed Waris and Zargo Toure all on target for the hosts after Diego Rolan had given Willy Sagnol's men a first-half lead. Both teams finished with 10 men as Lorient's Lamine Gassama and Bordeaux's Andre Biyogo Poko were dismissed near the end before Adam Ounas pulled one back for the visitors."
49,27/09/2015,23:22,Brilliant Ben Arfa inspires Nice victory,"Hatem Ben Arfa produced two moments of magic as nine-man Nice romped to a 4-1 victory away at Saint-Etienne on Sunday, preventing their opponents from closing the gap on Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain.","Vincent Koziello had given Nice an early lead at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, but Loic Perrin soon equalised for Saint-Etienne, converting the rebound after a Fabien Lemoine shot crashed back off the bar. That was when Ben Arfa intervened, volleying past Stephane Ruffier and into the far corner of the net to put the visitors back in front in the 39th minute. Even better was to come a minute prior to the interval as Ben Arfa, who started out at Saint-Etienne's bitter rivals Lyon, dribbled into the box past several challenges and dispatched a low shot across Ruffier. The goals were confirmation that France international Ben Arfa is flourishing again in his homeland after a disappointing spell in England with Newcastle United and then Hull City followed by six months out of the game earlier this year. ""Sometimes, Hatem can be very good but he never lets it go to his head,"" said Nice coach Claude Puel. ""He stays focussed just like his teammates. We all know his quality and that he can settle situations at any time. Tonight was easily his best game for us."" Jean-Michael Seri put Nice further ahead following a counter-attack led by Valere Germain, before Nampalys Mendy and Maxime Le Marchand were both sent off in the final half-hour. The latter walked after conceding a penalty that was missed by Jean-Christophe Bahebeck as Nice claimed a third win in just over a week following a 3-1 victory at Bastia and a 6-1 thumping of Bordeaux. Nice are up to seventh while Saint-Etienne remain second, four points behind leaders and defending champions Paris Saint-Germain, who won 4-1 at Nantes on Saturday. Elsewhere on Sunday, Marseille's poor start to the season continued with a 2-1 defeat at home to promoted Angers. Goals from Thomas Mangani, a penalty, and Romain Thomas had Marseille in deep trouble at the Stade Velodrome before Michy Batshuayi reduced the deficit 11 minutes from time, again from the spot. The result left Michel's struggling side down in the bottom half of the table, just four points above the relegation zone. ""We played very badly in the first half, that's not the way to start a match,"" moaned Michel. ""We weren't in the match and were below par for many minutes. We lacked creativity and penetration. I can't explain it but we'll have to find a solution."" Angers continued their impressive return to the top flight after an absence of 21 years as they moved into fifth, level on points with third-placed Rennes. ""Fifteen points after eight matches is crazy,"" said Angers coach Stephane Moulin. ""We're not crazy, we know Marseille are better than us, individually and collectively, but in football little teams can make life difficult for the big ones."" It was a disastrous outcome for Marseille to a peculiar match in which the Velodrome was empty at both ends due to a punishment related to last weekend's incidents during the 1-1 draw with Lyon, in which several Marseille fans threw missiles at police and onto the pitch. Later on, a lucky goal from Nicolas Benezet a minute from time denied Monaco victory as Guingamp snatched a 3-3 draw in Brittany. Having won 3-2 at Montpellier on Thursday, Monaco looked on course for a second successive away victory but despite taking the lead three times in the match, through Bernardo Silva, Andrea Raggi and Nabil Dirar, the hosts pegged them back each time thanks to Sloan Privat and a Benezet brace, the last of which appeared to be a cross that sliced into the net at the near post. Montpellier, the 2012 champions, got their first win of the season in a 2-1 victory over mid-table Lorient. Jonas Martin hit the winner in the 57th minute after Lorient's Raffidine Abdullah -- who was later sent off -- had cancelled out Ramy Bensebaini's opener, although Montpellier remain in the bottom three."
50,20/09/2015,19:13,"Saint-Etienne extend winning run, Monaco beaten","Saint-Etienne moved to within a point of French league leaders Paris Saint-Germain after recording a fourth successive win by beating Nantes 2-0, while Monaco slid to another home defeat, losing 3-2 to Lorient.","Saint-Etienne returned to domestic action just three days after a 2-2 draw at home to Rosenborg in the Europa League and took a first-half lead at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard through a first Ligue 1 goal from teenager Jonathan Bamba. Slovenian international Robert Beric, who arrived from Rapid Vienna last month, added a second for Les Verts just after half-time to seal victory for Christophe Galtier's side. Monaco's indifferent start to the season continued as the principality side found themselves two goals down to Lorient inside 20 minutes. Didier Ndong hammered a long-range thunderbolt beyond Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic before Benjamin Jeannot added a second for the visitors. Almamy Toure pulled one back for Monaco shortly after and the hosts were back on level terms when Thomas Lemar equalised just after the interval but substitute Benjamin Moukandjo's 59th-minute strike won it for Lorient. Later, Lyon travel to Marseille with Mathieu Valbuena set to return to the Stade Velodrome for the first time since leaving OM last summer. Earlier, Enzo Crivelli scored a minute from time to salvage a 1-1 draw for Bordeaux against ten-man Toulouse. Willy Sagnol's men, who drew against Liverpool 1-1 in the Europa League on Thursday, were heading towards defeat before 20-year-old substitute striker Crivelli bundled the ball home with his chest as time was running out. Moroccan midfielder Adrien Regattin smashed home the opening goal for the visitors in the 23rd minute but the straight red card shown to Oscar Trejo with 13 minutes left hampered their chances of holding on for maximum points. On Saturday, Edinson Cavani kept Paris Saint-Germain's unbeaten start to the season intact as he equalised late on at Reims in a 1-1 draw. Saint-Etienne and Brittany side Rennes are their closest challengers and one point back after coming from behind to draw 1-1 at home to Lille on Friday evening."

""After suffering breathing problems during the match betweeen Saint-Etienne and Bastia, Jean-Christophe Bahebeck was hospitalised for further tests,"" the club said in a statement after the match. ""It was a drop in blood pressure, not a heart-attack,"" Caiazzo told AFP. The match was played in searing heat in mid-afternoon with temperatures reaching 35 degrees Celsius on one of the hottest days of the year in France. ""I don't have all the information. We will put confidence in our medical staff and of course show the player the utmost care,"" added Caiazzo. Bahebeck is on loan at the club after joining from champions Paris Saint-Germain in the off-season."

Bastia had pulled level four minutes before the break through Gael Danic but slip to sixth in the table after their first defeat in four outings. Defending champions Paris Saint-Germain can break a three-way tie at the top of the table, alongside Reims and Rennes, if they can pick up at least a point at Monaco in the weekend's final match. Also on tap Sunday is a battle between former French champions Bordeaux and Nantes. On Saturday, Lyon returned to winning ways as they rode a Nabil Fekir hat-trick to a 4-0 thrashing away to Caen while Rennes claimed their place in the top three with a 3-1 home victory over Toulouse. Reims are the surprise table-toppers on goal difference following a 4-1 dismantling of suffering Brittany side Lorient and Lille won for the first time under new coach Herve Renard when they edged Ajaccio 1-0. On Friday, Marseille came back to earth with a thud following their 6-0 thrashing of Troyes last week which was new coach Michel's first match in charge, but it all went wrong at Guingamp where they slumped to a 2-0 reverse."
53,15/08/2015,19:05,Bordeaux strike late to deny Saint-Etienne,A stoppage-time free-kick by stand-in captain Henri Saivet gave Bordeaux a 1-1 draw with Saint-Etienne at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in the early Ligue 1 game on Saturday.,"Beaten 2-1 at Toulouse in their opening league match last weekend, Saint-Etienne looked set for all three points when Fabien Lemoine set up Romain Hamouma for a low finish across stand-in Bordeaux goalkeeper Jerome Prior and in on 58 minutes. However, they had taken the lead in Toulouse before conceding twice from direct free-kicks and it was a dead ball that did for Les Verts again this time. The match was in stoppage time when the visitors won a free-kick in a central position 20 yards out, and the wall opened up to let Senegal international Saivet's low shot through to ensure a share of the points. Later on Saturday, last season's runners-up Lyon go to Guingamp with Mathieu Valbuena set to make his debut after the France international playmaker signed from Dynamo Moscow in midweek. The pick of the other matches sees promoted Angers, top of the table after the opening weekend, entertain derby rivals Nantes. On Sunday, Marseille go to Reims in their first game since the shock resignation of coach Marcelo Bielsa, while champions Paris Saint-Germain are at home to newly-promoted Corsican minnows Gazelec Ajaccio. On Friday, Monaco warmed up for their Champions League play-off first leg against Valencia by drawing 0-0 at home to Lille."
54,09/08/2015,19:24,"Saint-Etienne, Bordeaux lose as Bielsa fallout continues",Bordeaux and Saint-Etienne both suffered Ligue 1 opening day defeats on Sunday as French football was still suffering the shockwaves of Marcelo Bielsa's resignation as Marseille coach.,"At the Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux, Willy Sagnol's men were 10 minutes from victory before Nicolas De Preville cancelled out Wahbi Khazri's 41st minute opener and Theoson Jordan Siebatcheu grabbed a dramatic 88th minute winner for Reims. At Toulouse, Loic Perrin gave Saint-Etienne a 17th minute lead before the home side turned matters around. Martin Braithwaite levelled the match 10 minutes after Perrin's opener before star striker Wissam Ben Yedder put away the winner, eight minutes into the second half. Toulouse finished the match with 10 men when Aleksandar Pesic was shown a straight red card with four minutes left. Meanwhile, Bielsa's shock exit at Marseille after Saturday's opening 1-0 defeat at home to Caen sparked a bitter war of words between the Argentine and his former employers. Former European champions Marseille accused the Argentine of trying to hold them hostage over his new contract. A strongly-worded club statement claimed: ""Marseille possess a sufficiently rich history to refuse to surrender to the rule of one man"". The French giants insisted they wouldn't be ""held prisoner by a man who places his personal interests high above those of the club"". The attack on the man known as 'El Loco' (the mad man) came less than 24 hours after he had delivered what captain Steve Mandanda described as his ""hammer blow"". Bielsa blamed last minute changes to his contract for the decision which left Marseille president Vincent Labrune dumbfounded. ""I am, like all the supporters, dazed by Marcelo Bielsa's shock decision,"" Labrune declared in a statement. ""However, we take note of this decision which places the club in a difficult place having started the new season with a home defeat."" He confirmed that one of Bielsa's assistants, Franck Passi, would step up as caretaker coach pending a permanent replacement. The club and owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus assured fans they would ""take all necessary measures in the coming days to enable Marseille to enjoy a season to the height of its expectations"". Bielsa, who had been in charge since May 2014, wrote in his resignation letter: ""I am sad and frustrated. ""I cannot accept the situation of instability at the club. ""We had reached an agreement on a contract extension for 2016-2017, which was missing just a signature."" Bielsa said he had met Wednesday with the club's chief executive Philippe Perez and Igor Levin, Louis-Dreyfus's lawyer. ""They wanted to change the contract,"" he complained. ""I took this final decision as working together requires a minimum of trust, which we do not have."" Bielsa, who guided Chile to the last 16 at the 2010 World Cup, was at pains to point out his abrupt exit had nothing to do with money, revealing he had turned down a new deal multiplying his salary threefold. And he said he'd been patient with the club, despite uncertainty in the way they had conducted themselves in the close-season transfer market. Champions Paris Saint-Germain opened the Ligue 1 season on Friday with a hard fought 1-0 win at Lille."

The former Leeds United player later confirmed that he wanted to leave for pastures new, but Galtier said that the little 27-year-old is expected back for pre-season training on July 13. ""Since I have been at the club, we have never prevented a player from leaving and going where he wants provided the conditions are right, both for the player and the club,"" Galtier said. ""It will be the same for Max-Alain Gradel. We are not going to give away our leading scorer if he can't find a club capable of putting on the table an offer that matches our valuation. ""If that is not the case, our leading scorer will stay at the club and I will be very happy."" Saint-Etienne have already lost Franck Tabanou since the transfer window opened, with the left-sided player joining Swansea City for around 4.9 million euros (£3.5m, $5.6m). However they have signed the midfielder Vincent Pajot from Rennes and are on the brink of bringing in Benoit Assou-Ekotto, the Cameroon international latterly in England with Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers."

The versatile former France Under-21 international can operate at left-back or as a left winger. Tabanou, who joined Saint-Etienne in 2013 from Toulouse, described his move to Swansea as the ""perfect match"" after also attracting interesting from Russian and Turkish clubs. ""Swansea is a very good Premier League club and I believe it's the right move forward for me at this stage of my career,"" Tabanou told the club's official website. ""I was aware of Swansea's interest in me for a while, but unfortunately it didn't happen back in January.

Worthy but unexpected quarter-finalists in the Champions League this season, third-placed Monaco have 68 points, just two ahead of Marseille and Saint-Etienne on 66, with Marseille also enjoying a comfortable goal difference margin on the other two. Monaco have been outstanding in Ligue 1 since December, losing just twice and conceding a miserly eight goals. Their 40-year-old Portuguese coach Leonardo Jardim has forged a water-tight defence and built an industrious, youthful counter-attacking system where 20-year-old midfielder Bernardo Silva and 19-year-old striker Anthony Martial are showing there is life after Falcao and James Rodriguez. ""We don't need to worry about anyone else, and we won't be listening to the other games"" said Jardim, who agreed a contract extension until 2019 last week. ""We just need to win our match, because Marseille and Saint Etienne are going to win theirs,"" said Jardim, who will be satisfied Lorient secured their top-flight status last week. Croatian 'keeper Danijel Subasic said the mood in the dressing room was relaxed and confident. ""I don't know if the other teams will win, but I hope not. Our game is like a final, it opens the doors to the Champions League,"" said Subasic, who has 19 clean shhets in Ligue 1 this season. Long-time leaders Marseille watched their title aspirations evaporate after Christmas and gradually the team led by intense Argentine coach Marcello Bielsa saw a run of poor luck allow their Champions League ambitions slip from their grasp too. But a 2-1 come-from-behind win over Monaco two weeks ago and a resounding 4-0 win over Lille last time out has given the southern giants one last roll of the dice. They host mid-table Bastia on Saturday with arguably two of their top forwards playing their last game for a club who are trying to get rid of their top paid players. The two concerned are Andre-Pierre Gignac, France's second-top scorer who propelled their early season charge, and Ghana's Andre Ayew who will be out of contract and on their way. ""I was expecting better,"" said the 25-year-old Ghana star Ayew. ""I wanted the team to be more competitive next year so we could challenge for the title."" ""Also the club cannot offer me the same salary that I'm on at the moment,"" added Ayew, son of former Ghana and Marseille legend Abedi Pele. Saint-Etienne have their own internal squabbles to deal with as they go into their match at home against Guingamp. Player-of-the season Max-Alain Gradel said this week the club lacked ambition, sending a shockwave from the top to bottom. ""It's not a lack of ambition that stops us rivalling PSG, just a lack of means,"" replied Christophe Galtier. His club have bought their training ground, rebuilt their stadium, bought back their club shop and opened a club museum over the past four years whilst coming in the top-five each time. Gradel was referring to the sale of Kurt Zouma to Chelsea, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Borussia Dortmund and Blaise Matuidi to PSG over the same period. But others remained focussed on the final game. ""We're not booking holidays yet in case we get the third spot, in which case we'll spend the summer getting ready,"" insisted 'keeper Stephane Ruffier, their joint player of the season."
61,17/04/2015,02:25,"Wounded Paris resume title chase, Lyon face derby rivals",Paris Saint-Germain will have little time to lick their wounds following their Champions League loss to Barcelona as they turn their focus back to the Ligue 1 title race for Saturday's trip to Nice.,"PSG are staring at a third successive exit from the Champions League at the quarter-final stage after losing 3-1 at home to Barcelona in the first leg at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday. The second leg at the Camp Nou awaits next Tuesday, but Laurent Blanc's side can ill afford a slip-up when they face Nice, 650 kilometres along the Mediterranean coast, at the Allianz Riviera on Saturday afternoon. Blanc acknowledged the game is one his side ""absolutely have to win"" as they lie a point behind leaders Lyon, albeit with a game in hand. Already banned against Barcelona in midweek, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti will be suspended again, while captain Thiago Silva came off with a thigh injury in the first half on Wednesday and Blanc may not be willing to risk David Luiz after he had to play 70 minutes of the Champions League game after being rushed back from a hamstring problem. Having already beaten Lyon, Monaco and Marseille this season, mid-table Nice may therefore fancy their chances as they look to pull further clear of the relegation zone. However, when asked if he thought this was a good time to face PSG, Nice coach Claude Puel replied: ""I don't think so. I would have preferred to play PSG after a good result. For them, for French football and for us. ""They didn't play as well as they would have wanted against the Catalans and they will be eager to put in a better showing against us."" Lyon reclaimed top spot on Wednesday when they beat Bastia 2-0 thanks to late goals by Mohamed Yattara and Alexandre Lacazette, the latter getting his 25th in the league this season. Hubert Fournier's side have won their last two outings to boost their title chances but now they play host to Saint-Etienne in the most passionate derby in French football at the Stade de Gerland on Sunday evening. Lyon may have home advantage but Les Verts come into the Rhone derby in great shape, a run of seven games unbeaten in the league leaving them fifth in the table, two points shy of the podium. In addition, having struggled so badly in the derby for the last two decades, Christophe Galtier's team won 3-0 at home to Lyon in November and have lost on just one of their last six visits to their rivals. ""It is a chance for us to make the supporters and the city proud. It would be great if we could repeat our performance of last season but Lyon will want revenge,"" said Saint-Etienne midfielder Jeremy Clement, who started his career with Lyon. Monaco currently occupy the third and last qualifying berth for next season's Champions League as they prepare to welcome Rennes to the Stade Louis II on Saturday. ""For me it is the key game that we have to win if we are to finish on the podium. It is the most important match in Ligue 1 this year,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. His team are unbeaten in eight league games but this match falls between the two legs of their Champions League quarter-final tie against Juventus and captain Jeremy Toulalan could again miss out with a hamstring problem. A point behind Monaco in fourth, Marseille are at Nantes on Friday, while Bordeaux in sixth go to in-form Lille on Sunday. At the foot, the bottom two Metz and Lens meet in what is almost certainly the last chance for either to avoid the drop. Fixtures (kick-offs 1800 GMT unless stated)"
62,12/04/2015,19:10,Blast from the past as Saint Etienne beat Nantes,"There was a hint of nostalgia in Ligue 1 on Sunday as Saint-Etienne beat Nantes 1-0, the two clubs having won 15 league titles between them in a 20-year stretch up to the early 1980's.","On an afternoon of glorious sunshine, thousands of fans went bare-chested in the stands at a packed and boisterous Geoffroy-Guichard stadium, where Franck Tabanou's thunderbolt free kick on 18 minutes was enough to give three precious points to Europe-chasing Saint-Etienne. Between 1964 and 1983, the two clubs won 15 titles between them, nine going to Saint Etienne (Marseille and Monaco got two each and Strasbourg the other), as they dominated the French scene. Saint-Etienne are currently fifth and eyeing Europa League qualification, but to avoid disruptive early qualifying rounds in August they are targeting a fourth-place finish, which they also managed last season. Sunday's win also helped them get over the disappointment of Wednesday's 4-1 defeat to PSG in the French Cup semi-finals. Nantes, for their part, have re-established themselves as a mid-table side after promotion two seasons ago, their last French title coming in 2001. Paris Saint-Germain lead Ligue 1 on 62 points, ahead of Lyon on 61, but neither side plays this weekend because of Saturday's League Cup final, where PSG beat Bastia 4-0. Monaco beat Caen on Friday to climb up to third on 58 points, while Marseille are fourth on 57 ahead of their late game on Sunday at in-form Bordeaux, where they can climb back into the third and final Champions League qualifying spot. French football is on something of a high right now with Paris hosting Barcelona on Wednesday in a glamour Champions League quarter-final first-leg after a 'generational' victory over Chelsea in the last-16. Meanwhile, Monaco are also in the last eight and travel to Italian giants Juventus on Tuesday in confident mood having won their last four away games in Ligue 1 and beating Arsenal in the last round. PSG's defence of their League Cup title on Saturday, which featured doubles from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani, means their League game with Metz, originally scheduled for this weekend, will now be played on April 28th, while Lyon's game with Bastia will be played this Wednesday. Elsewhere on Sunday the 19-year-old rookie striker Said Benrahma's 4th minute strike was enough to give Nice a 1-0 at Reims, while Lille grabbed a 1-0 win at Evian after a generously awarded penalty, converted by Sofiane Boufal. Relegation-threatened Toulouse won 1-0 at home over Montpellier, bottom side Lens slugged out a 0-0 draw with Lorient while in the Brittany derby Rennes beat 10-man Guingamp 1-0."
63,09/04/2015,00:17,Zlatan hat-trick fires PSG into French Cup final,A Zlatan Ibrahimovic hat-trick fired Paris Saint-Germain to a 4-1 French Cup semi-final victory over Saint-Etienne at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday as their epic quest for a four-trophy sweep continued apace.,"Ibrahimovic's opener from the penalty spot on the 21st minute was his 100th goal for the club, he then rounded the 'keeper on 81 for the second, and completed his hat-trick with a fine run and shot in injury-time. But an injury-depleted Paris had to fight for long periods of this gutsy Cup tie as Saint-Etienne drew level with a Romain Hamouma header, going in 1-1 at half-time before an Ezequiel Lavezzi header put PSG back ahead on 60. Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier praised Swede Ibrahimovic as ""the greatest foreigner to have played in France"" as he lamented his side's inability to match PSG's pounding artillery. PSG have scored 11 times against Saint-Etienne in four matches this season of which eight have come off Ibrahimovic's boot. ""There's nothing to say, at this level they are unbeatable, in any case for us,"" said Galtier. ""They had the perfect match, in intensity, technical plan, determination. It's never good to take on this type of team so near the final. ""I'm disappointed for my players that they weren't able to go all the way in this adventure. But that's all, there was too big a difference. ""They are a war machine. They were superior on all levels."" PSG now face second division Auxerre, who beat holders Guingamp 1-0 on Tuesday, in the Cup final at the Stade de France on May 30. Paris also take on Bastia in the League Cup final at the same venue on Saturday, face Barcelona in Paris in the Champions League quarter-finals first-leg next Wednesday and they lead Ligue 1 by a single point from Lyon. No French club has ever clinched the domestic treble. ""As long as we're in the running on four fronts, we're thinking about this quadruple, but nothing is won yet,"" said PSG coach Laurent Blanc. ""They aren't machines. You get used to the players scoring two or three goals per match. They also have the right to be a little tired. Zlatan was tired against Marseille (last weekend). ""They are an exceptional group of players and Zlatan is one of them. I'm proud to coach these boys. I've a fantastic group, with an enormous capacity to work."" With defender David Luiz, midfielder Thiago Motta, and forwards Edinson Cavani and Lucas all ruled out through injury, coach Laurent Blanc also rested Blaise Matuidi with a packed calendar of matches coming PSG's way. The giant Swede converted his spot-kick with aplomb after Lavezzi had been tugged from behind and the referee awarded a generous penalty. But Saint-Etienne stormed back at the Parisians and were level four minutes later when Hamouma's glancing header from a free-kick curled beyond 'keeper Nicolas Douchez at the near post. Mevlut Erding should then have given the visitors the lead after 32 minutes, but he hesitated when through on Douchez, who deflected his tardy shot to safety. Lavezzi then ran onto a sumptuous cross from Pastore just after the hour and rose alone on the edge of the six-yard box, his looping header leaving Stephane Ruffier rooted to the spot as the ball crept just inside his far post. Ibrahimovic then calmed home nerves running onto a through ball to round the 'keeper and slot home into an empty net to send the stadium wild. His third goal was equally extravagant as his trademark dribble found him a glimmer of space to shoot home his 102nd goal for the club. Ibrahimovic becomes PSG's second top all-time scorer, seven shy of Pauleta's 109 goals. Saint-Etienne 'keeper Stephane Ruffier kept his side in contention early in the first half as Paris came out all guns blazing, saving twice from Lavezzi and stopping a fierce Javier Pastore shot as a series of goal efforts zipped wide. On Tuesday second division Auxerre turned back the clock on past glories as they beat holders Guingamp 1-0. Relegated in 2012, Auxerre won a league and cup double under legendary coach Guy Roux in 1996 while also lifting the Cup in 1994, 2003 and 2005."
64,03/04/2015,23:21,Monaco and St. Etienne lose ground after stalemate,Monaco came back to earn a 1-1 draw at home to Saint-Etienne on Friday as both teams lost ground on the leading trio at the top of Ligue 1.,"Two-time defending champions Paris Saint-Germain continue to lead Lyon by a point, and Sunday's opponents Marseille by two, while Monaco climb within five of the capital club in fourth, having played the same number of matches. Saint-Etienne remain solid in fifth and six points off the pace having played a game more. ""We have some regrets, yes. I think we had the best chances, the best situations, even before scoring,"" said Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier. Mevlut Erding put the visitors in front 28 minutes from time with a glorious glancing header that stunned the home crowd following a cross from Franck Tabanou. Turkish international and former Paris Saint-Germain striker Erding, 28, met the ball perfectly as he ran into the box and sent his header past the stranded Danijel Subasic and into the Monaco goal. However the lead was short-lived as Leonardo Jardim's men were back on level terms six minutes later when Anthony Martial clipped the ball home when picked out inside the area. The two best defences in the top flight then locked up shop as neither team were able to find a late winner. ""I'm disappointed because our aim is always to win,"" said Jardim. ""But we were up against good opponents who knew how to get in behind us. That created difficulties for us."" PSG can strike a major blow in the title race by continuing their impressive recent record against Marseille when the bitter rivals meet at the Stade Velodrome on Sunday. Laurent Blanc's side, who are still in the running for four trophies, have spent most of the season playing catch-up at the top but finally reached the summit after beating Lorient 3-1 in their last outing a fortnight ago. Blanc's side have dominated the fixture known as 'Le Classique' in recent years, with their 2-0 win at the Parc des Princes in November their sixth in a row against OM. With their main rivals facing each other, Lyon will hope to take advantage when they go to Guingamp on Saturday. Elsewhere, Bordeaux, in sixth, host Lens on Sunday, while bottom side Metz entertain fellow strugglers Toulouse and Lorient host Brittany rivals Rennes on Saturday."
65,14/03/2015,20:29,Saint-Etienne keep up European bid with win at Metz,Saint-Etienne kept up their bid for European football next season and added to relegation fears for Metz with a 3-2 victory in Ligue 1 on Saturday.,"Leaders Lyon are not in action until Sunday, when they travel to third-placed Marseille who are four points off the pace, while Paris Saint-Germain, one point behind Lyon, travel to seventh-placed Bordeaux. It will be the first game for Laurent Blanc's defending champions, who are in the hunt for four trophies since their heroic Champions League victory over Chelsea on Wednesday. PSG are already in the League Cup final against Bastia, play Saint-Etienne in the French Cup semi-finals as well as being in the hunt for a third straight Ligue 1 title and being in the Champions League quarter-final draw next Friday. Saint-Etienne move back within a point of fourth-placed Monaco, who crushed Bastia 3-0 on Friday, thanks to goals from Ivory Coast striker Max-Alain Gradel, Mevlut Erding and Yohan Mollo. Visiting coach Christophe Galtier said he was pleased with the win but disappointed that his side conceded twice. ""We scored three goals, and they were good goals, well constructed and well developed but we didn't control the match because we conceded twice,"" said the Saint-Etienne coach. ""We are conceding too many goals, but the most important thing is that our strikers are scoring and that gives them confidence. ""We should have wrapped up the match before but fortunately we scored the third goal,"" added Galtier. The defeat leaves Metz nine points from safety and in danger of returning to Ligue 2 with just nine matches to save their top flight status. In other matches Saturday, several teams involved in relegation battles took centre stage. At Lens, the 1998 French champions gave themselves a glimmer of hope of staying in Ligue 1 with a vital 1-0 home win over Toulouse. The Northern club remain seven points from safety but a well taken goal from Pablo Chavarria with 13 minutes left at least gave them reason for hope. Brittany club Lorient also picked up three crucial points to move five points above Toulouse and the final relegation spot with a 2-1 win over Caen. Evian find themselves sucked towards the bottom three after they lost 2-1 at Nantes, meaning they remain three points above Toulouse. Finally, Montpellier climbed back into European contention with a 3-1 home win over Reims and are now sixth ahead of Bordeaux, only on goal difference, while the Girondins can retake their advantage with at least a point at home to PSG in the weekend's penultimate match on Sunday."
66,08/03/2015,19:11,Late goals lift Saint-Etienne,"Saint-Etienne brought their seven-game winless streak to an end with a 2-0 victory over strugglers Lorient on Sunday and leapfrogged Bordeaux into fifth place in Ligue 1, closing in on the European places.","Yohan Mollo came off the bench to break the deadlock with just 15 minutes to go before Max-Alain Gradel made sure of all three points in injury time. Saint-Etienne, who needed penalties to beat third-tier Boulogne in the French Cup quarter-finals on Tuesday, found Benjamin Lecomte in defiant mood in the Lorient goal. ""It's an important win for us. We needed it after last week's draw at Toulouse and the French Cup win,"" said Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier. ""We have had quite a few injuries lately and lost a few players so there have been some changes in the team. ""But this has given us the chance to look at some of the younger players. And the substitutes have played their part, too."" Mollo, who had only been on the field a matter of minutes, took his chance from just outside the box. His powerful shot, deflected by Mehdi Mostefa, beat the hapless Lecomte with a quarter of an hour left. Africa Cup of Nations winner Gradel then grabbed his third goal in as many league games to seal the match by tapping in a clever Romain Hamouma cross in injury time. Lorient, who had been reduced to 10 men when Didier Ndong was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 67th minute, are now just two points above the relegation zone. Meanwhile, Guingamp slumped to a third straight league defeat, going down 1-0 at home to Lille with Nolan Roux scoring the only goal of the game. The result takes Lille up to eighth but leaves Guingamp, who won through to the semi-finals of the French Cup in midweek, in the bottom half. Later on Sunday, Lyon, who have managed a mere six points from their last five league outings, travel to Montpellier needing a win to overtake Paris Saint-Germain and go back to the top. On Saturday, PSG provisionally moved into first place with a routine 4-1 home win against struggling Lens. Fourth-placed Monaco also won, 3-1 away at Evian, to move back to within six points of Marseille, who are third, with a game in hand."
67,18/01/2015,16:13,Cavani marks return from wilderness with goal,Edinson Cavani redeemed himself after being dropped for three matches by scoring in Paris Saint Germain's hard fought 4-2 Ligue 1 victory over Evian on Sunday.,"The 27-year-old Uruguayan star -- who along with Ezequiel Lavezzi had been suspended after they returned late from Christmas holidays -- notched his eighth goal of the campaign as PSG moved above St Etienne into third, four points adrift of leaders Lyon, who beat Lens 2-0 on Saturday. St Etienne, though, can go back ahead of them should they beat Rennes later on Sunday while second-placed Marseille -- who are ahead of PSG on goal difference -- host Guingamp. However, PSG's overall performance against a team in the relegation zone will still have caused coach Laurent Blanc some concern. The hosts went behind in the 14th minute as Zlatan Ibrahimovic's careless header dropped to an Evian player who fed Cedric Barbosa. Barbosa eluded Thiago Motta's tackle and fired in a shot which Salvatore Sirigu went the right way for but he failed to keep the ball out. Boos rang out round the ground and the fans nerves weren't eased as Evian goalkeeper Benjamin Leroy produced some remarkable saves to keep them in front. One from Ibrahimovic was especially noteworthy, although another at point blank range from David Luiz was even better and earned the goalkeeper a congratulatory hug from the Brazilian defender. However, it was Luiz who finally broke his resistance getting on the end of a corner to level the match and setting off on one of his trademark celebratory runs along the touchline that had former France president Nicolas Sarkozy grinning alongside PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi. Their grins were even wider as shortly before half-time Italian midfielder Marco Verratti prodded home for his first league goal for the club. The hosts were unable to put the game to bed during the second-half and it was Evian who equalised as Gregory van der Wiel's poor decision not to leave the ball, from a harmless freekick, and instead head it back to Sirigu proved disastrous. Sirigu was unable to gather the ball properly after saving it with one hand and the ball trickled over the line. Back came the boos and the time came for Blanc to send on Cavani -- whether it was his physical presence that prompted it or not PSG almost immediately restored their one goal advantage through Javier Pastore. Pastore played the ball to Ibrahimovic, who found Lucas out on the right and the Brazilian's low cross was superbly tucked away by the Argentinian striker. The match was finally safe when Cavani -- who had started the move -- pounced to tap in Ibrahimovic's pass and put himself not only level with the Swede as the club's joint top scorer with eight league goals but also back in the good books of both fans and coach."
68,30/11/2014,22:53,Saint Etienne end Lyon hoodoo,"Saint Etienne beat Lyon 3-0 in France on Sunday, their first home win over their local rivals in twenty years, after Ligue 1's top two Marseille and Paris Saint Germain also won this weekend.","Moustapha Sall and Ricky Van Wolfswinkel had given Saint Etienne a 2-0 lead by half-time and Renaud Cohade finished the job in the 69th minute. The result sent a wave of joy round the stadium as it ended a run dating back to April 1994 and a series of seven home defeats by their bitter local rivals. Playing with a five-man defence the home side were rarely troubled by Lyon's 4-4-2 but breathed huge sighs of relief when Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette missed a sitter at 1-0 before also sending a penalty wide in the 79th minute. Marseille remain top on 34 points after their 2-0 home win over Nantes on Friday while the champions Paris Saint Germain are second on 33 after their 1-0 win over Nice on Saturday. Lyon had gone 10 games unbeaten since the beginning of September to climb to third in the table, where they still remain on 27 points ahead of Bordeaux in fourth on goal difference. Bordeaux remained in the hunt for a Champions League place after a 1-0 win over Lille, thanks to a goal by giant Mali striker Cheick Diabate. Meanwhile, Lille, the 2011 champions, remain 14th and just two points above the relegation zone. It was a welcome return to form for Bordeaux, who lost last week at Marseille to drop three points off the Champions League places. But in maintaining one of only two unbeaten home records in Ligue 1 -- the other belonging to PSG -- Willy Sagnol's side kept in the European hunt. Lille's lethargy could only partly be explained by a draining trip to Krasnodar, in the heart of Russia, for a Europa League match on Thursday, but tired legs could not be blamed entirely for such an insipid display and lack of fight. Bordeaux could have gone in front as early as the third minute but Thomas Toure's shot came back off the post and Diego Rolan was flagged offside as he knocked in the rebound. Lille, who have not won for two months, largely contained Bordeaux's four-pronged attack in the first 45 minutes and even rattled their hosts five minutes from the break when Cedric Carrasso had to make a one-handed save to deny Roux. Toure hit the post again on 50 minutes direct from a corner that caused confusion in the visiting defence. But they finally broke the deadlock just after the hour mark as 6ft 4in (1.94m) Diabate converted a cross from Nicolas Maurice-Belay to score his sixth goal of the season. PSG are the only unbeaten side but still trail Marseille despite Saturday's ninth consecutive win in all competitions. Sweden striker Ibrahimovic stroked home the spot-kick just past the hour mark after Nice defenders Jordan Amavi and Romain Genevois had cleaned out Lucas in the box. Florian Thauvin scored one goal and set up the second at the Stade Velodrome on Friday evening. Thauvin deftly converted a Dimitri Payet cross and then saw his free-kick headed home by Rod Fanni as Marseille claimed a seventh successive home victory, their best run at the Velodrome since their 2009-10 title-winning campaign."
69,24/10/2014,02:15,Marseille chase new record as PSG tackle Bordeaux,Ligue 1 leaders Marseille chase a club record ninth consecutive victory on Sunday when they travel to Lyon while defending champions Paris Saint-Germain are in action at home to Bordeaux 24 hours earlier.,"Marcelo Bielsa's new look Marseille side have been the talk of French football after a blistering start to their campaign and the question is now whether they can protect a seven point advantage and go all the way to a tenth league title. PSG are their closest rivals and remain the only unbeaten side in the division but six draws in ten matches has seen them lose ground on Bielsa's men, who are shaping up as serious title contenders. OM striker Andre-Pierre Gignac has been the star man with ten goals in as many matches, including one in their most recent 2-0 victory over Toulouse at the Velodrome, a streak that also earned the 28-year-old a recall to the France team. Few would have bet against Laurent Blanc's two-time defending champions going on to win a third crown but Marseille appear to be the real deal after Argentine Bielsa came in at the beginning of the season and revamped their style of play. The capital club know that if the gap is not reduced this weekend, the importance on the clash between the two sides at the Parc des Princes on November 9 will take on increased significance. They will also be without key striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic who is still struggling with a heel injury. Marseille have won eight matches in a row on two occasions, back in 1937 and 1998, but it was Lyon who snapped their streak last time out. And the fourth-placed hosts at the Stade Gerland are themselves unbeaten in six and coming off a 5-1 thrashing of Montpellier last Sunday. Third-placed Bordeaux come into their clash level on points with PSG but low on confidence after a 1-1 home draw against lowly Caen last Sunday. ""We know how good Paris are and we know their players,"" said Bordeaux coach Willy Sagnol, who is in his first season in charge of a top flight club. ""The advantage about going to Paris is that we have nothing to lose and everything to win. I want the players to take risks to go for victory in Paris because we don't have a team to defend,"" added the former international full-back. ""We'll be looking to get a result with open play and grab some goals but we've got to raise our level and it's going to be a packed stadium. We are playing a team with an international stature but I prefer to concede five goals by at least trying to take the game to them."" concluded Sagnol. Should Marseille triumph in Lyon and set a new record for victories, they would be two short of Bordeaux's single-season record of 11 achieved on the way to the 2009 Ligue 1 crown, under Blanc, while the Girodins also have the overall record for wins at 14, chalked up between March and August 2009. In other matches, fifth-placed Saint-Etienne return from Europa League duty at Inter Milan and host Metz on Sunday while a busy Saturday slate features Bastia at home to Monaco, Lorient at Caen, Reims take on Montpellier in the Champagne region and sixth-placed Nantes are on the road at Evian. Sunday's early match takes place at Rennes when Lille are in Brittany while Nice travel to Guingamp. The weekend programme begins Friday with Toulouse hosting rock-bottom Lens.

70,18/10/2014,22:12,Monaco and St. Etienne climb in Ligue 1,"Monaco continued their mini-revival, and set down a marker for their midweek Champions League home tie against Benfica with a 2-0 victory over Evian in Ligue 1 action on Saturday.","Under-pressure Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim looked on as last season's runners-up picked up a fourth win in ten matches to move within three points of the top three. Marseille will carry a four point lead over Paris Saint-Germain into their home tie against Toulouse on Sunday after Laurent Blanc's defending champions saw off nine-man Lens 3-1 on Friday. Saint-Etienne now trail third placed Bordeaux only on goal difference after they edged Lorient 1-0 in the afternoon fixture. Portutuese international midfielder Joao Moutinho slotted home for Monaco from the penalty spot in just the second minute as the 2013 French Cup finalists fell behind early on. Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco then tapped home from close range after Evian's Danish goalkeeper Jesper Hansen inexplicably allowed Ricardo Carvalho's innocent lob to bounce over his head. Elsewhere, ten-man Guingamp ended their four game losing streak with a desperate 2-1 victory at Lille. Goals either side of half-time from Claudio Beauvue and Ronnie Schwartz gave the Brittany side only their third win of the season and lifted them off the bottom of the table. Lille pulled a goal back with 12 minutes left when Riu Mavuba scrambled the ball home after a mixup in the Guingamp penalty area but it wasn't enough, despite defender Benjamin Brou Angoua seeing red for the away side with four minutes remaining. Nantes took the lead at home to struggling Reims when Johan Audel hit the back of the net after just 13 minutes but a superb curling free-kick from Diego levelled the match at 1-1, 13 minutes into the second half. The point kept Nantes in sole possession of fifth place. ""It's a shame we gave up the equaliser from a set-piece but we were suffering tonight (Saturday),"" said Nantes coach Michel Der Zakarian. ""We gave up more opportunites to the opposition in this match than we have in all our other matches combined. Physically we suffered and technically they were better than us especially in the way they used the ball. On the whole, we did very well to get a draw."" he added. On the Cote d'Azur, Claude Makelele, the former assistant coach to Blanc at PSG, saw his Bastia side take the lead six minutes after half-time at Nice when Floyd Ayite found the target. Despite a furious fightback from mid-table Nice, the Corsicans held on for only their second win of the season and some welcome relief for former Real Madrid and Chelsea midfielder Makelele. The match was marred by a mini pitch invasion from disgruntled Nice fans at full-time, although the situation was swiftly brought under control. Meanwhile, Metz and Rennes battled to a 0-0 draw in the northeast of France. In the afternoon match, Saint-Etienne got back to winning ways after two defeats and two draws in their last four outings, with a late winning goal at Lorient. Midfielder Fabien Lemoine was the hero for Christophe Galtier's side as he popped up in the 87th minute to fire home after the visitors had dominated possession for the majority of the 90 minutes. The victory takes the 'Green Devils' up to joint third in the table as they try to get their quest back on track for a first French title since 1981. For Lorient, it was their sixth defeat in ten matches and keeps them camped just above the bottom three. Sunday's action sees leaders Marseille attempt to extend their advantage at the top when they host midtable Toulouse in the early match while Bordeaux await relegation threatened Caen and Montpellier travel to Lyon in the final match of the weekend."
71,28/09/2014,23:10,Relentless Marseille continue winning streak,"Marseille made it six wins on the bounce on Sunday, beating Saint-Etienne 2-1 at the Stade Velodrome to end the weekend two points clear at the top of Ligue 1.","Marcelo Bielsa's side produced a typically high octane performance in the first half and found themselves two goals ahead inside 28 minutes, Giannelli Imbula and Dimitri Payet both on target. The tempo dropped in the second half and Jonathan Brison got one back for Saint-Etienne, but OM held on to make it three wins in the last eight days and six in a row, their longest winning streak since the start of the 2012-13 campaign. This latest success saw them reclaim first place from Bordeaux, who had beaten Rennes 2-1 earlier on Sunday, while stuttering champions Paris Saint-Germain are five points off the pace in fourth. Bielsa named an unchanged side following last Tuesday's 5-0 victory at Reims while the visitors made several changes, having drawn at home with Bordeaux on Thursday. The hosts looked the fresher of the two teams and got off to the perfect start, Imbula collecting a Brice Dja Djedje pass, controlling and then lashing a shot into the bottom-left corner from just outside the area. Payet, the former Saint-Etienne winger, then came close on two separate occasions before finding the net shortly before the half-hour mark, stroking the ball home from just inside the box after Andre Ayew had stolen possession back from Francois Clerc. Marseille could not maintain the same level of intensity and Brison reduced the arrears on 53 minutes with a sweetly struck half-volley after the home defence had failed to clear their lines. Nevertheless, the hosts held on and Andre-Pierre Gignac, scorer of eight goals already this season, was only denied another by a good Stephane Ruffier save late on. Saint-Etienne, meanwhile, have still not won at the Velodrome since 1979, when Michel Platini and Johnny Rep were in their side. ""We must be honest. The coach has brought so much. He is meticulous -- everyone knows what they need to be doing,"" Marseille goalkeeper and captain Steve Mandanda told Canal Plus. ""But you can see that when we take our foot off the gas a little, like at the start of the second half, there is nothing between us and the other sides. We need to learn from games like this and remain fully concentrated."" Bordeaux were inspired by youngster Thomas Toure as they got the better of Rennes at the Stade Chaban-Delmas. Toure set up Wahbi Khazri to put Les Girondins ahead in the second half and then curled in a magnificent winning goal in the third minute of added time after Habib Habibou had levelled for Rennes in the 80th minute. ""The players never gave up. They were cooked at the end, but they kept looking for the winner into the final minutes,"" said delighted Bordeaux coach Willy Sagnol. ""They can be proud but they also know that there is work to be done in terms of the performance."" Elsewhere, Lyon made it four games unbeaten but threw away the lead in a 1-1 draw away to Nantes at the Stade de la Beaujoire. Burkina Faso defender Bakary Kone headed in Alexandre Lacazette's free-kick to put OL ahead six minutes into the second half, but he then shoved Georges-Kevin Nkoudou to the ground inside the box, allowing Jordan Veretout to level from the penalty spot in the 72nd minute. Sunday's other game saw Lens draw 0-0 with fellow promoted club Caen at their temporary home in Amiens. On Saturday, Paris Saint-Germain were held to a 1-1 draw at Toulouse, their fourth draw in their last five matches meaning that they will not go into Tuesday's Champions League showdown with Barcelona in the best shape. France's other Champions League group stage representative, Monaco, suffered a fourth loss in just eight league games this season, falling 1-0 at home to Nice in the Cote d'Azur derby, while there were wins for Lille, Metz, Montpellier and Evian."
72,26/09/2014,09:29,PSG seeking boost in Toulouse before Barcelona clash,What a difference a win makes. Paris Saint Germain's 2-0 win away at Caen in midweek not only broke a sequence of three draws but lifted them to second in the table and temporarily silenced the critics.,"With a tantalising Champions League tie against Barcelona coming up at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday, the French champions are on their travels again on Saturday, at Toulouse. And victory could put them level on points with early season leaders Marseille, although that could all change on Sunday when the leaders are in action at home to high-flying Saint Etienne. Earlier in the week, PSG coach Laurent Blanc admitted his side had been having ""a bit of a hard time"", but victory at Caen steadied the nerves and provided a morale-boost ahead of the visit of Barcelona. Toulouse currently occupy 10th place, right in the middle of the table after a 3-0 win over Rennes in midweek, but can always be expected to put up a fight against the league's big boys. As coach Alain Casanova said on Thursday: ""We know only too well that they're a lot better than we are, but over 90 minutes we're capable of getting a result. ""A football match is never a foregone conclusion, we have to draw on all out talents, it's as simple as that."" PSG will again be without talisman striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, which gives Casanova further reason for optimism. ""Ibrahimovic is the best player in this league, in fact, he's one of the four best players in the world, along with (Cristiano) Ronaldo, (Lionel) Messi and Neymar, and on top of that he has a nasty habit of scoring against us (five goals in three matches), so it's better we haven't got to face him,"" Casanova grinned. However, Paris' strength in depth showed as the Brazilian midfield pair of Lucas and Marquinhos scored the goals which saw off Caen, even if Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani was largely shackled by the home defence. The win, their first since early August and first away from home this season, put PSG three points behind leaders and bitter rivals Marseille in the Ligue 1 table. For their part, Toulouse will rely on the goalscoring prowess of in-form striker Wissam Ben Yedder, leading scorer for the past two seasons, who became the club's 10th most prolific striker of all-time with his 35th goal for the club in last week's 3-3 draw with Caen. PSG are still unbeaten this season, but they drew with Ajax in Amsterdam in thir first Champions League group game. That places added importance on the meeting with Barcelona - but first they have to negotiate the trip to Toulouse. ""Our level of play isn't of the same brilliance as last year, but we are getting closer to it, little by little,"" said PSG coach Laurent Blanc. ""Physically we are not at the top, but we dug in a little more in the second half than in the first. We still made chances."" Sunday sees a top-of-the-table clash as third-placed Saint Etienne travel to Marseille."
73,26/09/2014,09:10,Van Wolfswinkel ends goal drought as Saint Etienne held,Ricky van Wolfswinkel ended his year-long goal drought but Saint Etienne were held 1-1 at home by Bordeaux on Thursday.,"The 25-year-old Dutch striker, an expensive flop at Norwich in the English Premier League last season, struck in the 31st minute, volleying home Franck Tabanou's cross from the left. In only his second start in France since his loan move, van Wolfswinkel equalled his tally from 27 games for Norwich following his club record 10 million euro move from Sporting Lisbon. His only strike there came on the opening day of the season, in August last year, against Everton, but his failure to weigh in with goals proved a significant factor in the East Anglian club's relegation. However, against the run of play, Bordeaux were back on terms eight minutes later when Tiago Ilori headed home from close range after a scrambled move which saw Nicolas Pallois make a mess of a half-volley before Ilori came to the rescue. The home side's appeals for offside were waved away as they had two defenders on the line as Ilori got to the ball. The result was enough for both sides to narrow the gap on early leaders Marseille to two points ahead of the weekend's fixtures, when Bordeaux entertain Rennes and Saint Etienne travel to Marseille in a top-of-the-table clash."
74,24/09/2014,15:46,Perrin stays faithful to Saint-Etienne,"Saint-Etienne captain Loic Perrin has signed a two-year contract extension, tying him to his hometown team until 2018, the Ligue 1 club announced on Wednesday.","The 29-year-old central defender, who is currently recovering from a thigh injury, joined Les Verts at the age of 13 and signed his first professional contract in 2001. Perrin captained Saint-Etienne to a 1-0 victory over Rennes in the Coupe de la Ligue in 2013 as the club ended a trophy drought of more than three decades. He was named in the Ligue 1 team of the season for 2013-14 by his fellow professionals and was included on France coach Didier Deschamps' stand-by list for the World Cup. The deal for Perrin, which will see him take on a role on the staff when his playing career ends, follows the announcement earlier this week that France international goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier had extended his contract until 2018. Saint-Etienne are three points behind Ligue 1 leaders Marseille before hosting Bordeaux on Thursday night."
75,01/09/2014,00:10,PSG crush St Etienne as leaders Bordeaux draw,Champions Paris Saint-Germain thumped Saint-Etienne 5-0 as Bordeaux saw their 100 percent record at the start of the Ligue 1 season ended on Sunday with a 1-1 draw against Bastia.,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic, making his injury return, scored a hat-trick and strike partner Edinson Cavani also netted as the big-spending Parisians ran riot in the capital to move up to second. ""It's normal when you add a very good player that you play better,"" said PSG coach Laurent Blanc. ""We are therefore better with him, his presence is important."" But they were given a huge helping hand by Saint-Etienne goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier who failed to control a back pass on 24 minutes, turning the ball into his own net as he tried to the steer it on to his right foot but instead pushed it over the line. Ibrahimovic, making his return from injury, notched his first four minutes before the break with a firm header from Maxwell's left-wing cross. He doubled his tally as he ran on to a wayward back pass on 62 minutes before rounding Ruffier and slotting into the empty net. A minute later Cavani lashed in an unstoppable drive from distance that left Ruffier rooted to his line. Ibrahimovic completed his hat-trick on 72 minutes after beating a static offside trap and slotting the ball past Ruffier at his near post. St Etienne coach Christophe Galthier paid tribute to the Sweden star. ""Our opponents were superior in every department, showed great determination and had their leader back,"" he said. ""I had said I'd like to see Ibra but but I didn't want to see him score."" Earlier, Bordeaux, trailing 1-0 to a first-half strike from Ivorian forward Junior Tallo, were let off the hook when Floyd Ayite's net-bound strike with quarter of an hour remaining was deflected onto the bar by the hand of home defender Nicolas Pallois. No penalty was given and instead Bordeaux drew level in the 79th minute thanks to Diego Rolan's third goal of the season. The result left Bordeaux two points clear of PSG and Lille. ""From the bench, everything happens so fast that you can't see,"" said Sagnol of the penalty incident. ""But it would be a shame to reduce the match to just that."" Bastia, who were wearing white Bordeaux training tops after bringing the wrong kit to the Stade Chaban-Delmas, opened the scoring on 18 minutes when Tallo fired home from eight yards after Ayite's miscued header fell into his path. Bastia coach Claude Makelele could only look on as Mariano's ball into the box was chested down and then fired home on the turn by Uruguayan forward Rolan. ""As I said to the referee, these things happen so fast,"" said Makelele of the penalty controversy. ""He made a mistake and has admitted it. I'm satisfied with that."" Meanwhile, Lyon's poor start to the season continued as they threw away a lead to lose 2-1 at promoted Metz. France striker Alexandre Lacazette tapped in to give Lyon the lead midway through the second half at the Stade Saint-Symphorien, only for Yeni Ngbakoto to equalise with a penalty in the 82nd minute after Jordan Ferri was adjudged to have fouled Bouna Sarr. Metz then clinched their first win since returning to Ligue 1 with three minutes remaining when Venezuelan striker Juan Falcon swooped to head home from Kevin Lejeune's cross. The late turnaround sealed a dreadful week for Lyon, who were knocked out of the Europa League play-offs by Romanian side Astra Giurgiu in midweek and have now lost three Ligue 1 games on the bounce. On Saturday, Monaco came from behind to draw 1-1 with Lille as Dimitar Berbatov cancelled out Nolan Roux's opener, but the Principality club's day was overshadowed by the late withdrawal from their squad of Radamel Falcao amid mounting speculation that the Colombian is on his way out of the club. There were also wins for Rennes, Lorient, Nantes, Toulouse and Lens to go along with a 4-0 victory for Marseille on Friday against south coast rivals Nice."

Nasri, who was also left out of Raymond Domenech's squad for the 2010 World Cup, last played for France in the 2-0 defeat to Ukraine in the first leg of last November's World Cup qualifying play-off.

The 35-year-old arrived in the Parisian club in 2007 from Saint-Etienne. ""I want to continue this beautiful story and finish my career in this magical club,"" Camara said on his Twitter account. PSG prsident Nasser Al-Khelaifi praised the player, who is a friend of Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, as a ""great professionnel and a very important person in the locker room"". Despite being relegated to the bench for most of the season, Camara, who is the oldest player at the club, nevertheless played 11 matches this season. He previously played for English side Leeds, Empoli in Italy, and French clubs Marseille and Lens, and along the way picked up one cap for France in 2001."
85,10/05/2014,23:49,Football: PSG crush Lille to break Ligue 1 points record,Champions Paris Saint Germain achieved a new Ligue 1 points record on Saturday with a 3-1 win over 10-man Lille to ensure the race for Europe in France goes down to the wire.,"Laurent Blanc's side now have 86 points to overtake Lyon's all-time record of 84 in 2006, in a tie which was overshadowed by PSG's France midfielder Yohan Cabaye suffering a right ankle injury. European places will now be allocated on the final day of the season next Saturday with Champions League and Europa League berths still up for grabs. PSG's goals came through Brazilians Marquinhos (41) and Lucas (66) and Blaise Mathuidi (83) with the titleholders bidding to close out their season on a further high at home against Montpellier next weekend. Cabaye picked up the injury late in the first half after a tackle for which Lille's France international midfielder Marvin Martin was given his marching orders. The 28-year-old was stretchered off and taken to hospital immediately for a scan, which Blanc later said had not revealed anything serious. ""The ankle is very swollen, but obviously it was more fear than harm,"" said Blanc. ""I didn't see it but yes I was scared. Obviously he must have been thinking of the World Cup."" Minutes later, Brazilian defender Marquinhos broke the deadlock with a header, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, playing for the first time in a month, missing a chance to give the visitors a two-goal advantage just before the break. Lucas got the second after 65 minutes as he picked up a cross from Argentine teammate Javier Pastore, with the Brazilian also setting up the third as Matuidi gave the Lille defence the slip behind Ibrahimovic. Midfielder Jonathan Delaplace got one back for the hosts in extra time, but it was too little too late as third-placed Lille are just two points ahead of Saint Etienne, 3-1 winners at Nantes, thanks to a Mevlut Erding double. Lyon were the big losers of the weekend as they could miss out on an 18th straight Champions League spot after losing 1-0 at home to Lorient. Lyon were reduced to ten men after just 14 minutes when Mouhamadou Dabo was red-carded, with Cheick Doukoure giving the Brittany side the only goal after 53 minutes. Lyon are fifth, just one point ahead of Marseille who shared the spoils 1-1 at Bordeaux, and could grab the final Europa League berth. Nothing is decided yet at the bottom of the table, either, although French Cup winners Guingamp secured their top flight place next season with a 2-0 win at home against Toulouse. The final Ligue 1 ticket will be decided in a winner-takes-all tie between Sochaux and Evian on Saturday after both won their ties. Sochaux won 2-1 at Rennes and Evian beat Nice 2-0."
86,09/05/2014,02:25,Football: Lille look to clinch Champions League place,Lille will hope to extend Paris Saint-Germain's recent run of poor form and beat the newly-crowned champions to clinch a potentially lucrative prize of their own this weekend.,"The northern side have been in the top three in Ligue 1 since the start of October but need a win at home to the capital club to make sure of a podium finish and seal qualification for next season's Champions League. The gap down to Saint-Etienne in fourth is five points, but a Lille slip-up coupled with a win for Les Verts away to Nantes will take the battle for France's last Champions League spot down to the final round of games. Nevertheless, while PSG have reigned supreme over French football this season, they have gone off the boil since being knocked out of the Champions League by Chelsea last month and have taken just four points from their last four games. On Wednesday, they were confirmed as champions just before going down to a 2-1 defeat at home to Rennes, while Lille are France's form team at the moment, on a run of 13 games without defeat. ""I don't know what frame of mind PSG will be in on Saturday,"" admitted Lille coach Rene Girard. ""Will Laurent Blanc rotate his squad? Is it a good or a bad thing that they have already won the title? Maybe some players will already be thinking about the World Cup. ""But they remain a squad full of great players, so we must just worry about ourselves and take the points we need to be sure of taking third place."" PSG coach Blanc, who on Thursday extended his contract by an extra year through to 2016, has refused to criticise his team for their poor performances in recent weeks but has urged them to go on and set a new record for the most points in a Ligue 1 season. With two games to go, Paris are only one point away from equalling Lyon's all-time record tally of 84, set in 2006, and Blanc said: ""I think this team deserves to be in the record books, but to do that we will need to get points against Lille and Montpellier."" Saint-Etienne are guaranteed Europa League football next season but two wins from their last two games would see them snatch a Champions League place if Lille took no more than one point themselves. However, Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier is more interested in making sure that his side finish above great rivals Lyon, something Les Verts have not achieved since 1993. ""Lille haven't collapsed so far and I don't see why it would happen now,"" said Galtier ahead of the visit to mid-table Nantes. ""I only want us to focus on ourselves. Our main objective is to secure fourth place."" Marseille could still pip Lyon to the final Europa League berth after winning last weekend's meeting of the clubs to move to within two points of Remi Garde's side. Lyon are at home to Lorient on Saturday while Marseille go to Bordeaux in what will be Jose Anigo's penultimate game as interim coach before Marcelo Bielsa takes over at the Stade Velodrome in the summer. At the bottom, the battle to avoid joining Valenciennes and Ajaccio in being relegated to the second tier is intensifying, with Sochaux a point adrift of safety but in fine form. Herve Renard's side are unbeaten in their last six matches and travel to Rennes, who are now safe after surprisingly beating PSG in midweek. Evian, in 17th, are at home to Nice before travelling to Sochaux on the final day of the season, while French Cup winners Guingamp, two points above the drop zone, entertain Toulouse knowing a victory will confirm their safety."
87,03/05/2014,23:22,Football: Guingamp win French Cup to delight tractor fans,Guingamp lifted the French Cup for the second time on Saturday when they beat French football's great under-achievers Rennes 2-0 in an all-Brittany final at the Stade de France.,"Nicknamed 'The Farmers', Guingamp dominated from the outset to the delight of their fans, hundreds of whom had travelled the 480km to Paris in a convoy of tractors. ""We had the perfect match,"" said Guingamp coach Jocelyn Gourvennec, whose side also qualified for the Europa League as a result. ""To win a second (Cup) in five years isn't easy,"" added the former Rennes playmaker whose side also won in 2009 against the same opponents. ""We controlled very well and were very disciplined."" Jonathan Martins Pereira got the opener after 37 minutes when he latched onto a Christophe Mandanne header to catapult into the net. And Mali international striker Mustapha Yatabare claimed the second just after the break when he slipped through the Rennes defence to shock goalkeeper Benoit Costil with a close range header for his eighth goal in the competition. Costil held firm however after 53 minutes with a nice save which deprived Yatabare of a second goal of the night. It was the third victory this season for Guingamp over their fellow Bretons whom they beat twice in the league, and another woeful end for Rennes who also lost the 2009 French Cup final against the same side, who were then in the second tier. Rennes were also beaten by Saint-Etienne in last season's League Cup final, leaving them still without a major title since beating Lyon to lift the Cup back in 1971. It is a dire record for Rennes which hails from the capital of Brittany with a population of 207,000 and owned by billionaire Francois Pinault. Guingamp -- the club where Didier Drogba shot to prominence -- have a population of little more than 7,000. It was their third Cup final after losing the 1997 title match to Nice. Gourvennec, who achieved as a coach what he failed to win during his playing career, is now turning his focus to the fight against relegation. Both Guingamp and Rennes remain in danger of the drop to Ligue 2 with just three games left in the league campaign. ""Ligue 1 is very difficult. You have to put it on the line every day. It's difficult for a promoted team,"" he said."
88,25/04/2014,02:29,Football: PSG on brink of second straight Ligue 1 crown,Paris Saint-Germain can wrap up their second straight Ligue 1 title this weekend as relegation-threated Sochaux provide what could be their final obstacle on Sunday.,"A 10-point lead, following a sparkling domestic campaign which has seen Laurent Blanc's side suffer just two defeats, means the title is theirs with a lunch-time win away to Sochaux or 24 hours earlier if Monaco lose at relegated Ajaccio. Herve Renard, the flamboyant Sochaux coach who memorably led Zambia to their first African championship in 2012, has worked miracles to lift his men within three points of safety after taking over in mid-season. The Frenchman would ideally hope PSG arrive at the Stade Auguste Bonal with the title wrapped up and in relaxed mood to face his players, who he told recently to ""never give up"" in their remarkable bid to avoid the drop. While PSG's season was severely damaged by their Champions League quarter-final exit against Chelsea, a 2-1 victory in the League Cup final last weekend over Lyon and a laboured 1-0 midweek win over Evian has helped lift the gloom of another failed European campaign. Blanc was hardly satisfied by the form of his players on Wednesday and is just eager to tie up the title race before deciding on his own future for next season. ""It wasn't our best match of course but we got the job done,"" said Blanc, following Blaise Matuidi's late winner against Evian. ""We have to improve (against Sochaux) or we'll have the same problems and it's up to the players and staff to think about this. ""Nothing is ever accomplished in football if you don't put in the necessary ingredients,"" continued the former Bordeaux and France coach. ""I have told the players that the title isn't won yet and we're still missing that final little effort but nothing is ever easy. While few, if any, believe PSG can self-destruct from their position of power, a celebration has already been planned for the final day of the season on May 18 when Montpellier come to the capital's cauldron. After the ugly scenes of violence and hooliganism that marred their trophy celebration last year, it has already decided there will be no party in the streets of Paris this time around. Elsewhere, Lille have a stranglehold on third spot and carry a seven point advantage to Bordeaux, while their closest pursuers Saint-Etienne cling to a Europa League spot by just two points over bitter rivals Lyon. Saint-Etienne are on the road at Evian on Saturday while Lyon, who were held 0-0 by Toulouse in midweek, host Bastia at their Stade Gerland 24 hours later. French Cup finalists Guingamp have been sucked into a relegation dogfight and host an equally desperate Valenciennes outfit in a massive match to keep surging Sochaux at bay. The Brittany club are just two points above Renard's side while Valenciennes are a further four adrift. Nantes host Marseille in the only match on Friday while Lorient make the short trip to Rennes, Montpellier host Toulouse and Reims head south to Nice in the other Saturday fixtures.

89,23/04/2014,21:24,Football: Late Matuidi goal gives laboured PSG victory,Blaise Matuidi struck in the 89th minute to give Paris Saint-Germain a 1-0 win against struggling Evian at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday and take the capital club to the brink of the title.,"It looked like PSG would have to settle for a point against their 10-man opponents until Lucas played in fellow substitute Matuidi and the France midfielder slotted the ball through the legs of goalkeeper Jesper Hansen at the near post. The result leaves the reigning champions 10 points clear of nearest challengers Monaco with only four games remaining and means they can clinch a second consecutive title with a win away to Sochaux on Sunday, or 24 hours earlier if Monaco lose at relegated Ajaccio. However, the nature of the performance left coach Laurent Blanc far from satisfied at full time. ""The first half was very bad. We appeared to be lacking in motivation and were very slow moving the ball,"" said Blanc. ""There wasn't enough movement and Evian could even have been in front. We had a word with the players at half-time and the second period was better. ""Of course it wasn't our best performance but we did the job in the end."" Fresh from winning the League Cup by beating Lyon 2-1 in the final last Saturday, Blanc's side were looking for revenge on Evian, who beat them 2-0 in the reverse fixture back in December. Evian are still scrapping to avoid relegation but they have performed well against the leading lights in Ligue 1 this season, taking four points out of a possible six against Monaco and also holding Lille. They were unlucky not to take an early lead as well, Danish international Daniel Wass hitting the crossbar from a long-range free-kick in the fifth minute. Wass then forced home goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu into a good save from a header shortly after, as a PSG team still missing injured top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic and showing seven changes from that which beat Lyon struggled to find their rhythm. When they did, Hansen raced off his line to deny Ezequiel Lavezzi and young midfielder Adrien Rabiot fired over as the first half ended goalless. The early kick-off meant the Parc des Princes stands did not really fill up until the second half, but most of the drama was saved for after the restart. Lavezzi was unable to convert a Rabiot cutback from inside the six-yard box before Evian were reduced to 10 men with an hour played when former Marseille defender Kassim Abdallah picked up a second yellow card for a foul on Lucas Digne. Visiting coach Pascal Dupraz shook his head on the touchline, mindful of the onslaught that was to come, but Hansen saved from Lavezzi and Matuidi somehow missed the target after the Evian defence made a hash of dealing with a low ball across goal by the Argentine forward. It looked as if Evian would hold on until, with just a minute remaining, Matuidi struck his fourth goal of the season much to the relief of the home fans. Meanwhile, Lyon had to settle for a 0-0 draw away to Toulouse, a result which leaves Remi Garde's side in fifth spot, two points behind rivals Saint-Etienne and three clear of Marseille in sixth. OL must finish in the top five to qualify for next season's Europa League."

91,18/04/2014,02:25,Football: Pressure on PSG ahead of Lyon final date,"If they had their way, France's leading clubs would have done away with the League Cup a long time ago, but Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon both need the boost of winning Saturday's final.","The sides meet at the Stade de France in the final of the country's secondary knockout competition just six days after Lyon beat the capital club 1-0 at the Stade de Gerland in Ligue 1. Under normal circumstances, PSG would be the heavy favourites, but a difficult last 10 days have considerably increased the pressure on Laurent Blanc's side. Following the agony of their Champions League elimination at the quarter-final stage on away goals to Chelsea, Paris saw their run of eight consecutive league wins ended in Lyon, a result that means they will have to wait until next Wednesday's meeting with Evian at the earliest before retaining the title. But if another Ligue 1 crown is inevitable, Blanc knows his team must win the oft-derided League Cup -- a trophy the club have won three times before -- if they are to improve on their record last season under Carlo Ancelotti. ""The last week has been difficult. That's the way it is. We have to move on,"" says midfielder Yohan Cabaye. ""We have the chance to play for a title. It's a different competition and there is no doubt that the players are ready and determined."" Failure could have serious consequences for the coach himself, who has said he will not give a definitive answer to the offer of a contract extension until after the final. The former France coach has another year remaining but the recent run of back-to-back defeats, something the club had not experienced since 2011, has led to speculation that he could be sacked and forced president Nasser Al-Khelaifi to give him the dreaded vote of confidence this week. ""He is our coach today and I insist that I want him to stay. I was very clear about that before the second leg of the Champions League tie against Chelsea and my opinion did not change after that match,"" Al-Khelaifi told daily Le Parisien. ""Laurent Blanc has my unconditional support and nothing that happens on the field can change that."" Despite beating PSG last Sunday, Lyon are currently in fifth place in Ligue 1 and are at risk of finishing beneath their bitter rivals Saint-Etienne as well as missing out on Champions League qualification once again. Knocked out of the Europa League by Juventus last week, this could still go down as a successful season for OL if they can secure the League Cup, a trophy they have only won once before. Remi Garde, who oversaw Lyon's French Cup triumph two years ago when they also lost the League Cup final to Marseille, is confident despite a raft of absences for what will be his team's 56th match of a long season. ""The spirit of the team is great at the moment. It was important for us to win ahead of the final,"" he said in reference to last week's win against the same opponents, which was secured by a goal from young midfielder Jordan Ferri. He is suspended this weekend, while Gueida Fofana, Yoann Gourcuff and Clement Grenier are injured, leaving Lyon particularly light on options in midfield. However, it is the absence of another player that could have the most profound impact on the showpiece, as Lyon bid to repeat their victory against PSG in the final of the French Cup in 2008, when a Sidney Govou goal in extra time secured them a 1-0 win and a league and cup double. PSG are still without 40-goal top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is in Sweden recovering from the thigh injury suffered against Chelsea. There has been a noticeable drop in form from PSG in the games they have played without Ibrahimovic since he arrived in France at the start of last season. They have lost five of the 16 matches he has missed in that time. This season they have lost five games -- four of them without Ibrahimovic in the line-up."

Rennes -- who are in a lowly 14th position in Ligue 1 -- came from a goal down early on to lead 3-1 but a penalty a minute from time by Mohammed Yattara, who had also scored their opener, made it a nervous last few minutes for the Brittany-region hosts. However, they safely negotiated the dying stages to deprive Angers of what would have been their second ever appearance in the final, the first occasion being in 1957 when they were beaten 6-3 by Toulouse. Angers -- who are in the mix for promotion to Ligue 1 -- got off to a fantastic start as Yattara put them ahead in the third minute. However, the hosts levelled on the quarter hour mark as Swedish international midfielder Ola Toivonen netted with his seventh goal since he arrived from PSV Eindhoven for 2.5million euros in the January transfer window. Two further goals from Polish midfielder Kamil Grosicki and Cameroon veteran Jean II Makoun put Rennes firmly in control and apart from Yattara's late penalty they were rarely troubled by Angers down the stretch. Rennes -- coached by Philippe Montanier who has found life difficult in his first season since joining from Spanish side Real Sociedad where he had been named La Liga coach of the year -- will play the winners of the second semi-final between Ligue 1 title contenders Monaco and struggling Guingamp. ""It is good to be in the final but the championship is our main preoccupation,"" said 49-year-old Montanier. ""If we can quickly assure ourselves of staying up and win the French Cup that will be a good result for a transitional season."""

94,11/04/2014,02:25,Football: PSG hope to seal title after European disaster,"While the thumping hangover following Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League exit in midweek still lingers, the capital club might be able to sooth the pain by securing the Ligue 1 title on Sunday.","Laurent Blanc's expensively-assembled squad were within minutes of the semi-final spot they so badly craved at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge before a late Demba Ba strike took the Londoners through on away goals and plunged PSG into depression. They must now turn their attentions to putting the finishing touches on an almost perfect domestic campaign, and they stand on the brink of a fourth French title as they travel to Lyon on Sunday night. Nearest challengers Monaco sit 13 points adrift in second place with six games to go, and if they lose away to Rennes on Saturday, the path will be clear for PSG to win a second straight championship by beating Lyon at the Stade de Gerland, the same venue where they wrapped up the title last year. The match against Remi Garde's fifth-placed Lyon side will also serve as a rehearsal for the League Cup final between the two teams at the Stade de France on Saturday, April 19. Blanc's reported contract extension past 2015 appeared a formality before the derailment in London but with the club's Qatari owners craving Champions League success, reports this week suggest that he could yet be axed. The coach and his squad have been hit badly by the end of their European adventure and training was cancelled the day after the match as the club got to grips with their defeat. Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani was targeted as one of the players to underperform on the biggest stage and much has been said of their lack of experience needed to win Europe's biggest competition. ""Difficult to accept a result like that,"" Cavani tweeted after the match. ""We now have to concentrate on our other objectives."" They will be facing a Lyon side who were also eliminated from Europe this week, losing 2-1 away to Juventus in the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final tie to bow out 3-1 on aggregate. Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri will be keen to maintain their six-point lead over third-placed Lille while Saint-Etienne in fourth must win at Reims to keep their slim hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League alive. Les Verts faltered badly last week when they were held to a 1-1 home draw by Nice and a five-point deficit to Lille needs to be reduced quickly if they hope to return to the European Cup for the first time since 1981. Lille entertain relegation-threatened Valenciennes in a local derby in Saturday's early match. Meanwhile, Marseille make the short trip to Montpellier on Friday and coach Jose Anigo admitted this week he may have made a mistake in taking the job back in December after coming in for a torrent of abuse last weekend during the 3-1 home win against Ajaccio. Anigo, who will return to his primary role of sporting director in the summer, has endured a difficult time since the murder of his son Adrien back in September. ""There has been a form of disrespect and forgetfulness from the fans, so yes you can ask the question,"" he replied when asked whether he regretted taking the job when Elie Baup was sacked. ""Did I make the right decision to offer my services to the club because I got nothing in return and I didn't make more money? ""I possibly got it wrong but I am curious to see how it's going to finish for me."" Elsewhere, Ajaccio will be relegated on Saturday if they lose at home to Bordeaux.

95,04/04/2014,02:26,Football: PSG look for Cavani to step forward in Ibra absence,Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain will hope that record signing Edinson Cavani can fill the void left by the absence of injured top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic as they prepare to host Reims on Saturday.,"The meeting with the club from the Champagne country comes in between the two legs of the Champions League quarter-final against Chelsea, with Laurent Blanc's side leading 3-1 ahead of Tuesday's return at Stamford Bridge. And given that the capital club sit 13 points clear of nearest challengers Monaco at the top of the table with just seven games left, Blanc is bound to give a rest to some of his key players with Chelsea in mind. One man who will definitely miss the game is Ibrahimovic, who is set for a spell on the sidelines after coming off in the second half against Chelsea with an injury to the back of his right thigh. ""I just hope he comes back quickly because we will need him,"" admitted Blanc of the Swede, who has scored a club record 40 goals in all competitions so far this season. However, one man who stands to benefit from Ibrahimovic's misfortune is Cavani, the Uruguayan who cost 64 million euros (£52.9m, $87.7m) from Napoli last summer. Cavani has scored 21 goals altogether in his debut season in France, but he has only three in an injury-hit 2014 and earlier this week he admitted his displeasure at having to play on the wing in a 4-3-3 formation. ""For a striker who is used to finishing chances, having to fulfil other tasks is not easy,"" he told sports daily L'Equipe, before adding: ""There are things that I need to talk about with the club, things that need to be done differently."" Paris are on a club record-breaking run of 10 consecutive wins in all competitions and have not lost at home in the league since November 2012, so it would be a huge shock if they failed to record a positive result this weekend. Opponents Reims have twice reached the European Cup final themselves, including in the first ever final in 1956, when they were beaten 4-3 by Real Madrid at the Parc des Princes. These days their aims are rather more modest, but they are enjoying an excellent season under coach Hubert Fournier and come into the weekend just a point behind Marseille in sixth. ""It will be difficult, we can't hide that. But we are going to the Parc to get a result,"" insisted Reims' Cape Verde winger Odair Fortes. Elsewhere, second-placed Monaco will look to bounce back from a shock defeat at Evian last weekend when they host Nantes on Sunday, with the principality club's coach Claudio Ranieri sweating on the fitness of Layvin Kurzawa, Joao Moutinho and James Rodriguez. Lille are just six points behind Monaco in third but they face a tricky test at Toulouse, whose five-game unbeaten run means that a top-five finish, and possible European qualification, is not out of the question. ""Europe is not a taboo word for us and it's great that the players are talking about it,"" said Toulouse coach Alain Casanova last week. ""But talking about it and actually going out and doing it are two different things."" The south-western side are poor at home, though, having won just one of their last eight games in front of their own fans. Fresh from winning last week's Rhone derby at Lyon, Saint-Etienne in fourth continue their push for a podium finish and a Champions League berth when they host Nice, while Lyon go to struggling Valenciennes in between the two legs of their Europa League quarter-final against Juventus. Meanwhile, Lorient entertain Evian amid ongoing uncertainty about the future of their long-serving coach Christian Gourcuff, who has been linked with a move to take over the Algerian national team."
96,02/04/2014,02:30,Football: Juve taking nothing for granted in Europa League,Juventus are theoretically only four matches away from a Europa League final date in their own Turin stadium.,"But the runaway Italian league leaders are unlikely to go into Thursday's quarter-final first leg away against French club Lyon taking anything for granted. That is especially the case after they suffered only their second league defeat in 31 matches at the hands of Napoli at the weekend. So Juve will be keen to make sure that 2-0 reverse does not signal the start of a slump. Coach Antonio Conte sounded a warning after the visit to Napoli when he said: ""There are tired legs in my squad, that's inevitable when you've been playing every three days and are unable to rotate due to injuries."" Having struggled to see off Italian rivals Fiorentina in the previous round, with the indefatigable Andrea Pirlo scoring the only goal in the second leg for a 2-1 aggregate victory, Juve will nonetheless start as favourites to book their berth in the last four. ""It's a difficult draw against Lyon, even if many people are already talking about Juventus in the final,"" said Pavel Nedved, the former Czech playmaker who is now on Juve's board. ""We need to take it very seriously. No rival should be underestimated. We really are not thinking about playing in the final at home. We must focus on the quarter-finals."" Lyon, one of three sides in the quarter-finals yet to win a major UEFA club trophy along with AZ Alkmaar of the Netherlands and Swiss club Basel, have never faced Juventus, their neighbours from across the Alps, before. They go into the game on the back of a defeat, a 2-1 reverse at home to local rivals Saint-Etienne that effectively ended their chances of a top-three finish in Ligue 1 that brings with it qualification for next season's Champions League. They are also struggling with injuries just now, with fragile playmaker Yoann Gourcuff hurting an ankle at the weekend and fellow creative lynchpin Clement Grenier one of a host of others in the treatment room. Swiss champions Basel will have to play their first-leg clash against 2004 UEFA Cup winners Valencia behind closed doors after being punished for the violent behaviour of their fans. UEFA also fined FC Basel 107,000 euros ($147,500) after objects, including cigarette lighters, were thrown on to the pitch in their last-16 clash against Salzburg, with the referee halting the game for 10 minutes. AZ take on Benfica, last season's beaten finalists who saw off Tottenham Hotspur in the last round. The last Spanish representatives, Sevilla, travel to face 2011 winners Porto, who ended Napoli's interest in the competition with a 3-2 win on aggregate in the last round. The return legs are scheduled for a week on Thursday, April 10.

But in the weekend's final match, Gradel scored with 16 minutes left to keep Saint-Etienne three points behind Lille, and the final Champions League berth, with seven matches left. In a tense Rhone derby at Lyon, Turkish international Mevlut Erding scrambled home a right wing cross in the 28th minute to put Saint-Etienne in front. However Lyon responded 11 minutes later when Bafetimbi Gomis laid on a pinpoint cross from the wing which Alexandre Lacazette skillfully volleyed home to level the match at 1-1. It was the 22-year-old Frenchman's 14th goal of the season, drawing him level with Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani as the second top scorer in Ligue 1 behind PSG's Swedish talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic who rests on 25. It was then down to Ivory Coast striker Gradel to steal the headlines, as the former Leicester City, Bournemouth and Leeds United player, plucked the winner with a quarter hour to play. Earlier at Lille, the match appeared to be heading for a goalless draw before Kalou popped up inside the six yard box to knee the ball home following a corner from the right that led to a scramble. ""We came out of that one very, very well,"" said a delighted Girard. ""We're still in third so where is the problem? I think that many teams in France would like to be in third place even if we've struggled of late and have been missing efficiency,"" he added. ""We've got some complicated matches coming up so we'll just have to see. I was sorry to see some of the players whistled (by Lille fans) but we're not going to place too much importance on that. It was the public, it was not supporters."" continued Girard. In the only other match on Sunday, Rennes made it back-to-back league wins with a confident 3-0 home success against Bastia that moved them eight points clear of the drop zone. It was the first time this season that the Brittany outfit had picked up three straight victories following their French Cup quarter-final success over Lille on Thursday. They will now play second division Angers for a place in the Stade de France final against either Monaco or Guingamp. ""It's been a beautiful week, with three wins in three matches without conceding a goal,"" said Rennes coach Philippe Montanier. ""It boosts morale after the many difficult weeks. ""It's a week which has put us on the right track. We took another step towards staying in the top flight, and the perspective of a French Cup semi-final has spiced up our season."" The Corsican outfit remain in 10th position. Monaco suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat away to Evian on Saturday to leave PSG well on track for a second straight French title. Laurent Blanc's PSG side warmed up for their Champions League showdown against Chelsea on Wednesday with a 1-0 win over Nice on Friday.

Toulouse missed the opportunity to leapfrog Marseille into the top six as they were held to a 2-2 draw by Ajaccio in Corsica. The visitors had fallen two goals behind as Ricardo Faty and Gadji Tallo netted for Ajaccio, but Issiaga Sylla pulled one back before Clement Chantome, the on-loan PSG midfielder, equalised. But Toulouse missed a great chance to win the game when Jonathan Zebina saw a stoppage-time penalty saved by Guillermo Ochoa in the home goal.

100,20/03/2014,02:30,Football: Ibra 'just doing his job' as PSG go to troubled Lorient,Zlatan Ibrahimovic has tried to play down his role in turning Paris Saint-Germain into a leading European force as the Ligue 1 leaders prepare to go to Lorient on Friday evening.,"The Swede has been idolised by the PSG fans ever since he scored a brace to help the capital club come from two goals down to draw 2-2 at home to Lorient on his debut on the opening day of last season. Last weekend he got two more goals in the 2-0 home win against Saint-Etienne that kept the reigning champions eight points clear of Monaco at the top of the table. As a result, he moved on to 40 goals in all competitions this season, breaking Carlos Bianchi's previous club record of 39 in a single campaign, set back in 1978, but Ibrahimovic did not appear overly impressed. ""The important thing was to win. My goalscoring records are just a bonus,"" said the former AC Milan striker, who has 25 goals in Ligue 1 alone this season. ""We're having a fantastic season and that's why we have such a big lead atop the table. It's not because we're just too strong for the league or because Ligue 1 is too easy. It's because we train very hard."" Laurent Blanc's side are also eagerly waiting to discover who they will face in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, with the draw to be made on Friday. Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Chelsea are among the possible opponents for PSG in the last eight, but none of them will relish coming up against the French champions. Domestically, their dominance is such that they have lost just one of their last 40 Ligue 1 games, so a trip to Lorient's Stade du Moustoir will hold no fears, even if they must adapt to its artificial surface. Lorient have been one of France's most stable clubs in recent years. However, uncertainty over the future of long-serving coach Christian Gourcuff appears to have had an impact on performances, and the mid-table Bretons have won just one of their last eight matches. Gourcuff has spent quarter of a century in charge of Lorient in three separate spells, the most recent an unbroken stint since 2003. In that time he has helped turn a tiny provincial outfit into an established top-division club who are currently enjoying their eighth consecutive season in Ligue 1. But Gourcuff's contract is due to expire in the summer and he has not accepted the offer of a two-year extension, with his relationship with the club's hierarchy having deteriorated in recent times. ""There is no mutual confidence and we have very different feelings on a number of issues,"" said Gourcuff, who has seen many of his best players sold on in recent years and was especially unhappy at losing midfielder Mario Lemina to Marseille on the last day of the summer transfer window. Gourcuff, whose son Yoann plays for Lyon, says he ""still wants to work as a coach"" and admits it would be ""heartbreaking"" to leave Lorient, but his departure from the club now appears inevitable. At least 12-goal leading scorer Vincent Aboubakar should be able to return for the hosts after missing last week's 2-0 loss to Sochaux due to a knee problem. Yohan Cabaye is a doubt for PSG with the back problem he picked up last weekend, so Marco Verratti should return in midfield. Gregory Van der Wiel, the Dutch international right-back, is still struggling with a knee problem. Monaco host third-placed Lille on Sunday looking to increase the gap between the teams, which currently sits at nine points, while Saint-Etienne host Sochaux, Lyon go to Guingamp and struggling duo Marseille and Rennes meet in the pick of the other matches this weekend.

""I'm disappointed,"" said Girard. ""We were very average. We were beaten in the one on ones, we lacked rhythm, it was a non-match."" Later Saturday Sochaux beat Lortient 2-0 in a result that confirmed their recent good form which has seen them harvest 10 points from their last five games. It left them five points above the relegation zone.

Antoine Devaux gave the hosts the lead midway through the second period when he headed home a cross from full-back Franck Signorino.

""It's no doubt the lack of clinical finishing that cost us victory,"" said Marseille coach Jose Anigo. On Sunday, PSG, having sealed their place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League in midweek, will hope to get the better of bogey team Saint-Etienne. Blanc's side are unbeaten in 12 league games and come into the weekend eight points clear of nearest challengers Monaco at the top of the table. Les Verts, European Cup runners-up in 1976, have a good recent record against PSG, although they did squander a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in October and lost in extra time in Paris in the League Cup in December."

Blanc's side are unbeaten in 12 league games and come into the weekend eight points clear of nearest challengers Monaco at the top of the table. Les Verts, European Cup runners-up in 1976, have a good recent record against PSG, although they did squander a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in October and lost in extra time in Paris in the League Cup in December."
103,07/03/2014,15:09,Football: Runaway PSG looking to avoid complacency,"Fresh from beating their biggest rivals last weekend, Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain are determined to avoid complacency when they travel to face Bastia on Saturday.","Laurent Blanc's league leaders eased to a 2-0 victory against Marseille in the Classique at the Parc des Princes in their last outing to move onto 64 points -- a record tally at this stage of the season -- and open up a gap of eight points to nearest rivals Monaco. Apparently too strong for their domestic opponents, the club from the capital could be forgiven for focusing all of their attention on the Champions League, in which they defend a 4-0 lead against Bayer Leverkusen going into the second leg of their last-16 tie next Wednesday. Nevertheless, coming into the trip to Corsica to face a Bastia side who are ninth in the table but have won just one of their last five Ligue 1 outings, Blanc has refused to admit that a second consecutive title is secure. ""It's not up to me to confirm or deny that. I think it's better to be in our situation than that of our pursuers,"" said the 48-year-old. ""There are still a lot of points to be taken. We have a good number of points, but we need more. It's not over. ""Some people will say that if there is too big a gap we will start to lose focus. There is no easy solution. But we have managed to distance ourselves from our rivals and we are not going to complain."" Blanc, who was sweating on the safe return of many of his players from international duty this week, will be without Edinson Cavani for the game. The striker, who returned from more than a month on the sidelines with a thigh injury to score against Marseille, was allowed to go back to his native Uruguay for personal reasons this week. ""Cavani will not play. He will undoubtedly only get back (to France) on Saturday,"" admitted Blanc. ""Of course we'd like him to be there but it's not the case."" Second-placed Monaco entertain relegation-threatened Sochaux as they bid to get back to winning ways following their 2-0 loss at Saint-Etienne last time out. Claudio Ranieri's side are now hoping to secure the automatic Champions League qualification that comes with finishing runners-up as soon as possible, but they can ill afford to underestimate Sochaux, who have won three and drawn two of their last six matches to keep alive their chances of an unlikely great escape from the drop. ""Some people think it will be easy against Sochaux, I think the opposite. I have the feeling that this team is going to stay up,"" said Ranieri, before adding that captain Eric Abidal will miss the game at the Stade Louis II having briefly been admitted to hospital at the start of the week after taking the wrong flu medication. ""Eric Abidal is not quite ready for Saturday. It's the same for Aymen Abdennour, (but) Dimitar Berbatov has improved physically and he will be able to start."" Lille, in third, face a stiff test at home to Montpellier, who have not lost in nine Ligue 1 games, while Saint-Etienne, who are a point off the Champions League places, travel to Lorient later on Sunday. Lyon go to Bordeaux on Sunday night, but Marseille were not happy about having to play host to south-coast rivals Nice on Friday. The game is taking place just 48 hours after a clutch of OM players were in action for their countries in Wednesday's card of international friendlies. Marseille are seeking revenge for a 5-4 defeat to Nice in the French Cup in January, but they will also have to do without top scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac due to suspension.

104,28/02/2014,02:24,Football: PSG ready for test from resurgent Marseille,Paris Saint-Germain host Marseille in France's fiercest rivalry on Sunday night with the capital club hoping to have Edinson Cavani back to help them see off their resurgent opponents.,"Laurent Blanc's PSG side have had a superb last 10 days, crushing Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 in the Champions League and then beating Toulouse 4-2 away last Sunday to maintain their five-point lead over Monaco at the top of the Ligue 1 table. Since then they have been boosted by the news that France midfielder Blaise Matuidi has finally put pen to paper on a new contract tying him to the Parc des Princes until 2018. Now there is real hope that Uruguay striker Cavani will be able to make his comeback after four weeks on the sidelines with a thigh injury. ""The objective is to have him at our disposal against Marseille,"" revealed Blanc. ""We will have to see how the injury evolves, but when I see him in training I think he is close to being ready. In any case, we are not going to take any risks, but things are on the right track."" Bitter rivals Marseille come into the 'Classique' boosted by their recent improved form under interim coach Jose Anigo, which has reignited their hopes of finishing in the top three and qualifying for next season's Champions League. Inspired by Andre-Pierre Gignac, who has scored 12 times in 13 games, OM have won three and drawn two of their last five league matches. That run of results has allowed them to close to within three points of Lille, who remain on the podium despite a poor start to 2014. Now, though, Marseille must try to end a sequence of four successive defeats in all competitions against their old foes. ""It is a really exciting match, but to get a result against Paris would be a massive achievement for us,"" said midfielder Alaixys Romao. ""If we raise our game than why can't we win? We have improved over the last few weeks and are defending better. ""It will be difficult but over one game who knows. Paris don't intimidate me. They play good football so you just hope to show that you can compete at their level."" Meanwhile, second-placed Monaco continue their chase of the leaders with a tough trip to Saint-Etienne, who are fourth. Monaco are unbeaten in 2014 and their Colombian playmaker James Rodriguez says the race is still alive, especially if PSG slip up against Marseille. ""Personally I want to win the title but we know that Paris are very strong,"" said the 22-year-old. ""To get in front of them, we have to show more intensity in our game and win every match because the margin of error is very small. We all know anything can happen in the championship, and Marseille can win at Paris for example."" Elsewhere, Lyon have dragged themselves back into the race for European places but they face a tough test on Sunday at home against Montpellier, who are unbeaten in eight Ligue 1 matches under the leadership of Rolland Courbis. Remi Garde's team are five points behind Lille, who travel to bottom side Ajaccio. While the Corsicans have been cut adrift, Herve Renard's Sochaux have caught a glimmer of light in the their bid to stave off relegation as they sit five points from safety ahead of a home clash with Bordeaux. Third-from-bottom Valenciennes are two points from safety and travel to Reims, while the pick of the other games is a Brittany derby between Rennes and Guingamp.

The Italian then saw his side triumph 1-0 after extra-time away to Cote d'Azur rivals Nice in the French Cup last 16 on Wednesday as recent signing Dimitar Berbatov got his first goal for the club. That success was achieved despite Ranieri making sweeping changes to his line-up, but now the likes of Eric Abidal, Joao Moutinho and James Rodriguez are set to return to the side. ""I rotated the squad a lot at Nice because Monaco have to play three big games this week,"" said Ranieri, before lauding the contribution of his Bulgarian recruit, who appeared as a second-half substitute. ""Berbatov got the goal. I asked him to play in between the lines and he did that well."" Bastia, meanwhile, have had a great week. After failed to register an away win all season, they ran out 3-1 victors at Toulouse in a rearranged game on Tuesday that was notable for Djibril Cisse's first goal since returning to French football last month. ""Djibril put in a courageous performance. It was important for him to score,"" admitted Bastia coach Frederic Hantz, who is hoping the 32-year-old former Marseille striker can score enough goals to stake a late claim for a place in France's World Cup squad. ""We need to be careful with him and not go too quickly, so that he is in top form by March, April, May. If we do that we can help him achieve his (World Cup) objective."" Bastia then claimed another away win on Wednesday when the French League (LFP) confirmed that their 2-0 opening-day defeat at Nantes had been overturned because Les Canaris fielded an ineligible player. Hantz's side therefore now have European qualification in their sights, and they will be hopeful of claiming another positive result at Furiani, where only Lyon have taken three points this season. They are without goalkeeper Mickael Landreau due to a calf injury though, and Monaco are defending an unbeaten record in 2014. Nevertheless, they have managed just two wins in their last six league games and could find themselves eight points off top spot come kick-off. Before facing Bayer Leverkusen in Germany in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie next Tuesday, PSG entertain struggling Valenciennes at the Parc des Princes on Friday. The capital club, who are still without the injured Edinson Cavani, have not been at their best since hammering Nantes 5-0 last month and could do with a boost in a game that may see January signing Yohan Cabaye make his first start for the club. Third-placed Lille travel to face Evian on Sunday before fourth and fifth face off at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard as Saint-Etienne meet Marseille. Les Verts have lost just once in eight league games and have won their last five home matches, all without conceding a goal. Marseille, meanwhile, are enduring a season of ups and downs but head to Le Chaudron having taken seven points from a possible nine. ""We are on a good run at home and we are fourth in the table. That gives us reason to be ambitious,"" midfielder Benjamin Corgnet told Saint-Etienne's website. Lyon have also revived their hopes of European qualification via the league in recent weeks, and Remi Garde's side will expect to register three points when they host bottom side Ajaccio.

106,13/02/2014,23:32,Football: Lyon stunned in French Cup,"Lyon's hopes of a domestic Cup double were ended on Thursday as Remi Garde's side were eliminated from the French Cup at the last 16 stage, losing 2-1 after extra-time to second-tier Lens.","OL took the lead at the Stade de Gerland when Jimmy Briand headed home with just nine minutes played, and it looked like that goal would be enough to take them through to a quarter-final tie away to Monaco next month. However, Lens were handed a lifeline when Mehdi Zeffane brought down Adamo Coulibaly inside the penalty area a minute into injury time, and Pierrick Valdivia - who started his career with Lyon - converted from the spot. Lens, who were French champions in 1998 but are currently battling to win promotion back to Ligue 1 after a three-year absence, went on to win the tie in extra-time. The decisive moment arrived in the 94th minute when young defender Jean-Philippe Gbamin took advantage of hesitant goalkeeping by Remy Vercoutre to head home a corner. While Lens can look forward to a trip to the principality next, Lyon's hopes of silverware now appear to rest with the League Cup, in which they will meet Paris Saint-Germain in the final in April. Only four Ligue 1 sides made it through to the quarter-finals, with Monaco advancing thanks to a 1-0 extra-time win at Cote d'Azur rivals Nice on Wednesday, in which Dimitar Berbatov scored the winner, his first goal since arriving from Fulham last month. Rennes will meet Lille in the only last-eight tie between two top-flight sides, while 2009 winners Guingamp will go to Cannes. Fourth-tier amateurs Cannes, the club where Zinedine Zidane started his career, knocked out Saint-Etienne on penalties in the last 64 and followed that up by beating Montpellier 1-0 after extra-time on Tuesday. Montpellier had beaten PSG in the previous round but came up short on a poor pitch on the south coast, although they were also left to rue a missed penalty by Mbaye Niang in extra-time. The other quarter-final tie will see Angers, of Ligue 2, travel to Moulins, an amateur club from central France."

Monaco salvaged a point after PSG's captain Silva stretched and inadvertently turned a Fabinho cross into his goal in the 74th minute. The result was probably a fair reflection of the match, but PSG will be the most disappointed as they had held the lead since the eighth minute through a headed goal by Javier Pastore. ""It was a good game with lots of chances,"" reflected Monaco manager Claudio Ranieri. ""I hope PSG will win the Champions League for French football, and leave a few points for Monaco...."" Lurking at the back post, Pastore, who was drafted into the PSG side as replacement for injured striker Edinson Cavani, was able to score from close range after a corner had been flicked-on from defender Alex. Monaco's response to going behind was immediate and they should have been level just six minutes later, but Emmanuel Riviere squandered a great chance pushing a rebound from Sirigu wide with the goal at his mercy. But it was not all one-way traffic. PSG should have doubled their lead when Ibrahimovic, of all people, squandered a fine opportunity from just five yards out after good play on the left flank between Pastore and Maxwell. The second-half was a more scrappy affair with PSG largely in control. PSG came closest to scoring when Ibrahimovic fired in a fierce free-kick from the edge of the area which Monaco's Croatian keeper Danijel Subasic did well to turn wide in the 55th minute. Both sides had a chance to secure victory in the final minutes. First Fabinho was denied in the 89th minute from giving Monaco - who brought on former Fulham striker Dimitar Berbatov for his debut in the 64th minute - victory after his thunderous shot was well-saved by PSG's Sirigu. Then just moments later, Monaco's Subasic pulled off a similar save to deny Ligue 1's top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Meanwhile, the chasing pack behind the top two teams mostly had a good weekend. Lille, Marseille, Lyon and Reims all won with St Etienne the only side in the top seven not to get three points following a disappointing 0-0 at mid-table Toulouse."

Berbatov arrived on loan from Premier League strugglers Fulham, with the Bulgarian saying a recommendation from ex-teammate, and former Monaco defender, Patrice Evra convinced him to swap England for the Cote d'Azur. Looking ahead to his first match in Monaco colours, Berbatov said: ""It's the best possible way (to start).

We have been following him for a long time and so we are very satisfied to have reached a deal with Toulouse to bring him to Monaco,"" vice-president Vadim Vasilyev told the club's website. That deal was passed just before the January transfer window slammed shut and came after the announcement that former Bayer Leverkusen, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United striker Berbatov had joined until the end of the season from Fulham to cover for the injured Falcao. Falcao suffered a serious knee injury playing in a French Cup tie last month and is set to miss the rest of the season as well as the World Cup in Brazil. After making major waves in the transfer market last summer, Monaco were one of the busiest French clubs again in the January window, although in general Ligue 1 is spared from the chaotic scenes that come on the final day of the window in England. Monaco had earlier signed Nigerian left-back Elderson Echiejile from Braga in Portugal and giant Ivorian striker Lacina Traore from Anzhi Makhachkala, although the latter was then loaned out to Everton. Paris Saint-Germain settled for just the one January signing in France midfielder Yohan Cabaye, who joined from Newcastle United for a fee of up to 23 million euros (£19m, $31.4m) including bonuses on Wednesday. Cabaye made his PSG debut from the bench in Friday's 2-0 Ligue 1 win against Bordeaux and almost marked the occasion with a goal, hitting the post from a late header. The most notable moves elsewhere in France on deadline day came at Saint-Etienne, where Algeria left-back Faouzi Ghoulam was sold to Napoli for a reported six million euros ($8.1m) and was replaced with Benoit Tremoulinas, capped by France but who had been with Dynamo Kiev.

Cabaye, who made his name with Lille and played under PSG coach Laurent Blanc in the French national side, faces fierce competition for places in the Paris line-up, with Blaise Matuidi, Marco Verratti and Thiago Motta considered the first-choice trio in a 4-3-3 system. However, there could be an early opportunity for Cabaye to impress against Les Girondins with young Italian playmaker Verratti suspended and Adrien Rabiot, another option for Blanc, struggling with a knee problem. ""I am in a hurry to make my debut and represent ny new club. I feel fit and I hope to be in the squad and to participate,"" Cabaye said at his unveiling at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday evening. Cabaye also admitted that he had heard of the supposed scepticism about his signing from star players Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva, but there can be little doubt that PSG's rivals would love to be able to call on a player of his quality. The reigning champions sit three points clear at the top of the table and have a trip to second-placed Monaco to come next weekend. It is therefore crucial for them to get back to winning ways against Bordeaux after a 2-1 home defeat to Montpellier in the French Cup and a 1-1 draw at Guingamp in their last two outings. Blanc still has concerns surrounding the fitness of Ezequiel Lavezzi and captain Silva, while Bordeaux strike duo Cheick Diabate and Guillaume Hoarau are struggling for fitness just now, as is playmaker Ludovic Obraniak. Francis Gillot's side have already lost three times to PSG this season, but they did beat Saint-Etienne 2-0 last weekend and a surprise victory here could see them go fourth. ""There is no magic formula,"" said ex-PSG striker Hoarau when asked what was needed to beat the league leaders. ""You need a little bit of everything. We can't afford to let them play their game. People say they are not at their best just now - I'm not sure we can use that term but we need to hope that they perhaps don't play at 100 percent."" Monaco may be without the injured Radamel Falcao for the rest of the season but they didn't miss the Colombian in last weekend's 2-0 win against Marseille and will hope to make it eight victories in 10 league games when they visit Lorient on Saturday. Lorient themselves have lost just once in 10 in the league, though, and are usually a tough proposition on their artificial pitch in Brittany. Third-placed Lille go to Nice on Sunday looking to halt a sequence of four league games without a win in a match that could see talented right-back Sebastien Corchia make his debut following his move from Sochaux. ""I had other opportunities but I preferred to come to Lille because the coach (Rene Girard) phoned me personally. They are an ambitious club who will help me progress,"" said Corchia, who has in the past been linked with Bayern Munich and Juventus. Another club who have been busy in the January transfer window are Rennes, who could have new recruits Paul-Georges Ntep, Ola Toivonen and Kamil Grosicki in their side when they entertain Lyon on Sunday. Lyon, inspired by former Rennes playmaker Yoann Gourcuff, are aiming to extend a run of 12 matches without defeat in Brittany. Fourth-placed Saint-Etienne entertain Valenciennes on Saturday while Marseille, in fifth, are at home to Toulouse on Sunday. Fixtures (kick-offs 1900 GMT unless stated)"
115,26/01/2014,16:55,Football: In-form Lyon win again,Lyon continued their superb recent form with a 3-0 win over struggling Evian on Sunday to close in on the European places in Ligue 1.,"Bafetimbi Gomis turned and fired in his eighth league goal of the campaign to put Remi Garde's side ahead on 19 minutes at the Stade de Gerland, before Evian had Ghanaian defender Jonathan Mensah sent off six minutes prior to the interval. OL found time to double their lead before the break as Alexandre Lacazette chipped over Bertrand Laquait and into the net. And Lacazette secured victory inside the final quarter of an hour as he finished after being set up by substitute Jimmy Briand at the end of a breakaway, taking his tally for the season to 12 goals in the process. Remi Garde's side have started 2014 with six successive wins in all competitions and are now unbeaten in 12 games since a 4-0 defeat away to Paris Saint-Germain at the beginning of December. That remains their only defeat in their last 18 outings and Sunday's victory saw them move provisionally up to fifth place in the table, three points adrift of Saint-Etienne before Les Verts face Bordeaux later on Sunday. Also on Sunday, Monaco begin life without injured top scorer Radamel Falcao when they play host to Marseille at the Stade Louis II. Claudio Ranieri's side can move to within three points of Ligue 1 leaders PSG, who needed a late Alex equaliser to earn a 1-1 draw away to Guingamp on Saturday."
116,25/01/2014,20:07,Football: PSG settle for draw at modest Guingamp,Paris Saint-Germain came within three minutes of suffering a shock defeat on Saturday before an Alex equaliser earned them a 1-1 draw away to Guingamp in Ligue 1.,"The Brazilian's 87th-minute header cancelled out Mustapha Yatabare's effort at the other end with six minutes remaining of a hard-fought encounter played in wet and windy conditions in Brittany. The draw is enough for the defending champions to extend their lead at the top of the table to six points, although second-placed Monaco can trim the gap back to three with a win against Marseille on Sunday. PSG had endured a mixed week, thumping Nantes 5-0 to underline their superiority over the rest of Ligue 1 before being surprisingly eliminated from the French Cup by Montpellier. At the Stade du Roudourou, coach Laurent Blanc was without injured captain Thiago Silva, so Marquinhos lined up in the heart of the defence, while there was a first start in Ligue 1 since the beginning of December for Javier Pastore. And against opponents who had not won in six league games and had scored just three times since the start of November, PSG for once struggled to stamp their authority on proceedings. Zlatan Ibrahimovic had a shot from 40 yards turned around the post by Guy Roland Ndy Assembe with the visitors' best chance of the first half, but that came just two minutes before the interval. Guingamp were a greater threat at the other end, with the 21-year-old Rachid Alioui taking advantage of a rare start to volley just wide early on and then send in a long-range free-kick that moved in the air and was turned desperately onto the crossbar by PSG 'keeper Salvatore Sirigu. Edinson Cavani had an effort correctly ruled out for offside at the start of the second half, and the game looked set to peter out to a goalless draw on a difficult pitch. However, the home side had other ideas and took the lead in the 84th minute when striker Yatabare stole a yard on Marquinhos to head in from a right-wing corner. It was the Malian striker's sixth league goal of the campaign, and his first since early October, and it sparked wild scenes of celebration among the packed crowd inside a stadium which boasts a capacity greater than that of the small town of Guingamp itself. However, the giants from the capital were rescued soon after when Brazilian centre-back Alex got to a corner before Ndy Assembe to head home and restore parity. ""It is always difficult to win games. We came here to win even if we had a lot of respect for Guingamp,"" said Blanc. ""It is disappointing but I am still satisfied that we never gave up and came back to get a deserved point. ""We were not as good today. Why? I don't want to hide behind it but the state of the pitch was deplorable. It is the case for both sides but it handicaps the team that plays the most football. ""We knew it would be difficult and we have to get on with it. It maybe won't be the last time either, but we were not exactly helped."" Monaco will now look to close the gap without the services of top scorer Radamel Falcao, who underwent knee surgery on Saturday after suffering a serious injury in a French Cup win at Chasselay in midweek. Third-placed Lille could only manage a 1-1 draw at home to Rennes on Friday despite Salomon Kalou giving them the lead, and they have now gone four games without a win. Saint-Etienne can move to within a point of the podium with a win at Bordeaux on Sunday, while in-form Lyon are also in action on Sunday against Evian. Elsewhere on Saturday, the meeting between Toulouse and Bastia was called off because of the wet weather in south-western France."
117,24/01/2014,02:30,"Football: PSG, Monaco turn focus back to Ligue 1","Following a week of contrasting disappointment for Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain and second-placed Monaco, domestic action provides a welcome distraction as they resume their battle for the 2014 French title.","Laurent Blanc suffered his third defeat in eleven matches at the helm of PSG as they were shocked at home in the French Cup by a Montpellier side languishing fifth from bottom in Ligue 1. While their hopes of winning an unprecedented haul of four trophies went up in smoke, Blanc remained philosophical heading into Saturday's trip to Guingamp. ""It was a typical Cup match and sadly it was us that went out which is disappointing,"" said the former France and Bordeaux coach. ""If we can take something positive out of it, it's the fact that we have one competition less to worry about and our calendar will be less packed. ""Certain players needed game time and it showed (against Montpellier), but the Cup serves for that purpose too,"" he added. Monaco come into their Sunday evening tie at home to Marseille five points behind the capital club, but despite qualifying for the last 16 of the French Cup on Wednesday, they were counting the cost of a potentially season-ending knee ligament injury to star striker Radamel Falcao. The Colombian was stretched off just before half-time of the 3-0 win over fifth division Chasselay leaving his Italian coach Claudio Ranieri blaming the officials. ""If Falcao has something serious, it is the referee's fault,"" said Ranieri. Teammate Jeremy Toulalan also expressed his concern about the man who has found the back of the net nine times in league action this season. ""It doesn't look very, very good,"" expressed the playmaker as Falcao's World Cup hopes looked slim. Lyon are now the only French club maintaining a bid for four trophies after they sailed through their French Cup tie at amateur side Yzeure. Yoann Gourcuff's spectacular return to form has been the foundation for Remi Garde's men and they are also into the knockout phase of the Europa League as well as the League Cup semi-finals. While their chances of overhauling PSG remain far-fetched as they face a 19-point deficit, a win at home to Evian on Saturday could bring them within six points of the final Champions League spot. Third-placed Lille have staggered in recent weeks and hold just a three-point advantage on Saint-Etienne as they host Rennes in the weekend curtain raiser on Friday. Saint-Etienne meanwhile will look to compound Bordeaux's dismal exit in the French Cup after the holders were sensationally dumped out of the competition by amateur club L'Ile-Rousse in Corsica. The weekend's key relegation ties feature last-placed Ajaccio at home to Herve Renard's second-from-bottom Sochaux while Valenciennes are four points from safety as they host mid-table Lorient. Toulouse await Bastia, Nice are on the road at Montpellier and Nantes entertain Reims at La Beaujoire stadium. Fixtures (all kick-offs 1900 GMT unless noted):"

120,18/12/2013,23:45,Football: Cavani double eliminates holders St Etienne,A double by Paris Saint Germain's Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani eliminated French League Cup holders St Etienne 2-1 from this season's competition after extra-time of their Last 16 clash on Wednesday.,"Cavani -- who has scored 18 times in 23 games for PSG since he joined from Napoli in the close season -- had given the hosts the lead in the first-half only for former PSG striker Turkish international Mevlut Erding to level in the second period to force extra-time. However, Cavani grabbed the winner two minutes from the end of extra-time, though, he looked to be in an offside position when he knocked home Jeremy Menez's low cross. It was revenge for PSG as they had been knocked out by St Etienne on penalties in the competition last season. PSG's bitter historical rivals Marseille also progressed by the same scoreline against Toulouse which resulted in their interim coach Jose Anigo announcing he would still be in the role after the winter break as he celebrated his first win in charge. Former Toulouse star Andre-Pierre Gignac grabbed Marseille's winner from the penalty spot in a competition that Anigo -- who stepped in after Elie Baup was sacked earlier this month -- said is low on his list of targets compared to the French Cup despite Marseille having almost made it their own in recent years having won it in 2010, 2011 and 2012. ""I am very happy with this result,"" said Anigo. ""But I know that first thing in the morning it will be time to sit down and assess how we approach this weekend's game with Bordeaux which will not be an easy one as they are the side playing with the most confidence at the moment."" Earlier seven-time French champions Lyon reached the quarter-finals with a 3-2 win over fellow Ligue 1 side Reims. Lyon, who have won the League Cup just once in 2001, twice took a two goal lead only to see Reims come back to trail by just a goal. Goals by France international forward Bafetimbi Gomis and Alexandre Lacazette -- both scorers in Sunday's 2-2 draw with Marseille -- seemingly put Lyon in a comfortable position at 2-0 up by the hour mark. Gomis nodded home at the far post from Lacazette's cross in the 58th minute while the latter extended their lead on the hour with a super right-foooted shot after excellent lead-up work by playmaker Yoann Gourcuff. Gourcuff, whose inconsistency has attracted criticism, restored their two goal advantage -- after Prince O'Niangue had made it 2-1 -- eight minutes from time with a cracking shot from long range having already gone close only to see his shot come back off the post. However, Lyon's habit of letting slip leads throughout the season -- they led Marseille 2-0 last Sunday before being held to a draw -- looked as if it was going to happen again as Reims scored four minutes from the end of normal time through Floyd Ayite's penalty."

122,18/12/2013,11:47,Football: Monaco emerge as only threat to dominant PSG,"Paris Saint-Germain began what they hope will be an era of dominance in French football in 2013, a year that was also marked by the return of Monaco as a force and the national team's dramatic qualification for the World Cup.","Nineteen years after they were last crowned champions, PSG won their third title and their first trophy since the Qatari takeover at the Parc des Princes in 2011 under Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti. The capital club's strength compared to the rest of the country was frightening, epitomised by player of the year Zlatan Ibrahimovic. His goals helped the side reach the Champions League quarter-finals, where they bowed out on away goals to Barcelona, and his impact was such that the verb 'to zlatan' became commonly used slang in French. Glamour was added during the second half of last season by David Beckham's cameo at the Parc des Princes, the veteran Englishman finishing his glittering career with a Ligue 1 winner's medal. In a touch of class, Beckham promised to donate his salary to a local children's hospital, but PSG's success came at a big cost to owners Qatar Sports Investments, who spent huge sums building a formidable squad. As sports daily L'Equipe said: ""Never has a French league title come at such a price for the owner of a club"". And turmoil soon followed. Ancelotti left for Real Madrid, while sporting director Leonardo departed too after being banned from all official functions for 14 months for shoving a referee. Ancelotti was replaced by former France coach Laurent Blanc, who was considered to be little more than a stop-gap when appointed but who has succeeded in further improving the team. Few would bet against them winning a second successive title and making another big impression in the Champions League in the New Year. The year saw other grand old names enjoy success, with Bordeaux winning the French Cup and Saint-Etienne ending a 32-year trophy drought when they lifted the League Cup. But Monaco now appear to be the only realistic threat to PSG's dominance. Promoted back to Ligue 1 after a two-year absence, their billionaire Russian owner Dmitry Rybolovlev splashed the cash, including an outlay of 60 million euros ($82.4m) on Radamel Falcao from Atletico Madrid. That deal was briefly a French league record until PSG hit back with the 64 million-euro recruitment of Edinson Cavani from Napoli, and a two-way fight for supremacy was underway amid concerns that Ligue 1 was about to become as lopsided a contest as the Barcelona and Real Madrid-dominated Spanish league. Monaco's rivals have set about challenging their right to benefit from the favourable tax laws in the principality, that particular imbalance having been made all the more acute by the French government's introduction of a 75 percent tax rate on earnings over a million euros which almost led to a strike by angry clubs. But, as that row drags on, the French have good reason to be proud of their national team again. Didier Deschamps's side toiled for much of 2013, but their remarkable recovery from a 2-0 first-leg defeat to Ukraine in their World Cup qualifying play-off in November raised spirits. Les Bleus won the second leg 3-0 at the Stade de France to book their ticket to the 2014 finals. Now there is hope that a team featuring Ballon d'Or candidate Franck Ribery can make an impression in Brazil as they build towards Euro 2016, which France will host. By then, some of the exciting young stars who helped France win this year's under-20 World Cup in Turkey, including Paul Pogba, Lucas Digne and Florian Thauvin, should be key players in the full national team. No wonder French Football Federation president Noel Le Graet felt compelled to describe the end of 2013 as ""a new beginning"" for the sport in the country."
123,05/12/2013,12:11,Football: PSG cling to top spot as rivals close in,"Following Paris Saint-Germain's shock defeat in midweek at Evian and a milestone week for Ligue 1 goalkeepers, the race in France is wide open with three games remaining until the winter break.","PSG coach Laurent Blanc suffered his first defeat in charge since replacing current Real Madrid handler Carlo Ancelotti, and it was the capital club's first defeat in 36 matches, one short of the team record. The unexpected setback has allowed Lille to close within one point and Monaco two, after both clubs picked up wins over Marseille and Nice respectively, heading into the weekend's action. It was also a notable week for veteran goalkeepers Mickael Landreau of Bastia and Lille's Vincent Enyeama. Landreau, who began his incredible career between the sticks for Nantes in 1996 at just 17, set a new mark for top flight appearances in midweek when he raised the bar to 603, one better than former Monaco custodian Jean-Luc Ettori who set the previous record between 1975 and 1992. Nigeria's African champion Enyeama was also very much the talk of the league when he extended his number of minutes without conceding a goal to 1035 with a match-winning performance against Marseille. He is now within 141 minutes of the Ligue 1 all-time record of 1176 minutes unbeaten, held by Gaetan Huard and set in 1993. ""In the dressing room, it was incredible, everyone congratulated me,"" confessed Enyeama following the 1-0 win and passing the mythical 1000 minute mark. ""Above all, I am just very proud to be here and be a part of this team,"" he added. Landreau equalled Lettori's mark last Sunday with a clean sheet during Bastia's 2-0 win over Evian before breaking the record against Corsican neighbours Ajaccio in a 1-1 draw on Wednesday. Ettori, 58, was diplomatic after losing his long standing record. ""It is not just an anecdote and created a buzz,"" he said in reference to his mark. ""Six hundred and three matches is not insignificant, it's huge in fact and I'm happy for Mickael,"" said Ettori. ""I played 750 matches for the same club (all competitions) and that is a record that is going to last, in fact I think it will never be broken,"" he added. At PSG, Blanc's men have a chance to bounce back with what appears to be a home banker against rock bottom Sochaux on Saturday while Monaco host equally struggling Ajaccio and Lille travel to in-form Bordeaux. Nantes have positioned themselves just one point behind fourth placed Marseille and the two teams meet in a Friday clash at the Velodrome, with Elie Baup's position as OM coach potentially on the line. League Cup holders Saint-Etienne, were beaten by Rennes in midweek, and await the buoyant Evian side after their best win of the season over PSG. Lorient and Rennes meet in Brittany, Reims and Nice will do battle in the Champagne-region and Valenciennes are at home to Guingamp on Saturday. Struggling 2012 champions Montpellier will have a caretaker coach for the trip to Toulouse in the remaining match after coach Jean Fernandez resigned on Thursday.

And their overall run without losing in all competitions ends at 36 matches, also one short of the club record. However, that sequence does not include a defeat to Evian on penalties in the quarter-finals of the French Cup last season, and now the club from the shadow of the Alps can claim to be PSG's bogey side. ""This win is marvellous for all our fans, the whole region. I have to congratulate my players,"" said Evian coach Pascal Dupraz, who nevertheless admitted his frustration that his side were unable to produce such performances on a regular basis. Blanc did not dwell long on the run coming to an end. ""We had our chances in the first-half and we can have regrets about the loss because we should have opened the scoring and that could have meant a different result,"" he said. Blanc's side are now just a single point clear of Lille at the top of the table, with the northern side having beaten Marseille 1-0 on Tuesday, with Nolan Roux scoring a stoppage-time winner as Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama kept his 11th consecutive clean sheet.

But Landreau, formerly of Nantes, PSG and Lille, was unable to help Bastia beat their island rivals as the game ended in a 1-1 draw, a late Eduardo strike for Ajaccio cancelling out Florian Raspentino's early opener. ""It is fabulous to experience this and to be able to share it,"" said Landreau after the match. ""The game was played behind closed doors, but I prepare for every match in the same manner.

However, Montpellier's plight is not as serious as that of Sochaux, who remain rooted to the bottom seven points from safety after losing 2-0 at home to Reims. Leaders Paris Saint-Germain travelled to Evian in Wednesday's late kick-off looking to equal the club record for the longest unbeaten run in the top flight of 27 games, set two decades ago. PSG's last defeat of any sort came against Evian in Annecy in April, when they lost on penalties in the quarter-finals of the French Cup. Not including that, however, PSG are 36 games unbeaten in all competitions, one short of the overall club record. Their nearest challengers Lille beat Marseille 1-0 on Tuesday, with Nolan Roux scoring a stoppage-time winner as Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama kept his 11th consecutive clean sheet. Meanwhile, Monaco strengthened their grip on a top-three place thanks to their 3-0 victory away to Nice in a Cote d'Azur derby, achieved without Radamel Falcao, as the Colombian missed a second successive game due to injury. James Rodriguez, Emmanuel Riviere and Lucas Ocampos got the goals for Claudio Ranieri's men, as Nice fell to a sixth straight defeat. The midweek round of games concludes on Thursday when mid-table duo Lyon and Toulouse meet at the Stade de Gerland."
127,24/11/2013,23:14,"Football: Lille, Monaco keep pace with leaders PSG","Lille and Monaco kept pace with leaders Paris Saint-Germain, both winning 1-0 in Sunday's Ligue 1 action in France.","Pape N'Diaye Souare scored six minutes from time to keep Lille second in the table four points behind PSG with a win over 10-man Toulouse. Champions PSG had won 3-0 at Reims on Saturday. In Sunday's late kick-off, substitute Mounir Obbadi's 70-minute strike kept Claudio Ranieri's Monaco in the chase as they came away with all three points from fellow newly-promoted side Nantes. Monaco's first win in four games puts them third in the table five points off the pace. Rene Girard's Lille extended their run to nine games without conceding a goal as Nigerian international goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama has kept his slate clean for 855 minutes of action. ""I don't know if we're going to be able to compete with PSG. For the moment Paris are four points ahead, you can't say that they've pulled ahead,"" said Girard. It was a largely unconvincing display from the northerners who struggled to create anything despite playing the final 34 minutes with a numerical advantage following Oscar Trejo's red card. ""The sending off totally changed the direction of the match,"" complained Toulouse coach Alain Casanova. ""When I see my player with three stitches it makes me think there surely must have been a foul beforehand. ""He was given his marching orders and I regret it because we were really causing them problems on the technical front. We found ourselves with ten with half an hour to go and they didn't have many chances."" Enyeama was required to save his side on three occasions from Ben Yedder, Issiaga Sylla and Adrien Regattin. But Souare found space at the back post from Florent Balmont's cross from the right to head home and snatch the three points. The Nigerian international goalkeeper admitted his side had luck on their side. ""I made great saves, are you sure?!"" he said. ""We were lucky because they had a player sent off while they had been playing very well up until that."" Meanwhile, Saint-Etienne got back to winning ways at Nice despite the absence of their fans. Around 250 visiting fans were evacuated from Nice's Allianz Riviera stadium after coming under fire from sections of the home support, who tore up seats and threw them at their rival supporters. The visitors however let their football do the talking with Mevlüt Erding scoring his first goal for Saint-Etienne after 23 minutes, lifting his side to sixth. It was a fourth straight defeat for Nice, who were hit by a string of injuries, with an error from third goalkeeper Luca Veronese, 22, accounting for the goal. On Saturday, PSG kept their unbeaten start to the season intact with a dominant 3-0 win at Reims. Lucas Moura and Jeremy Menez shared goals either side of half-time and Zlatan Ibrahimovic added a late insurance marker as Laurent Blanc's men rumbled to their 10th victory in 14 outings. Lyon were held 1-1 at home by relegation threatened Valenciennes, while Lorient picked up a rare away win by thrashing French Cup finalists Evian 4-0. The three other Saturday matches between Montpellier and Guingamp, Rennes at home to Bordeaux and Sochaux entertaining Bastia all finished 1-1. On Friday, Marseille moved up to fourth spot with their second straight win at Ajaccio, a 3-1 triumph in Corsica."

The performance was a perfect riposte to Blanc's eve-of-match warning about the danger of complacency seeping into his swashbuckling team and their laboured 2-2 draw with Saint Etienne last time out. The former France boss needn't have worried as this Friday night run out against struggling Lorient left PSG only six games shy of the club record of 37 games without losing. ""This is a very good result. The satisfaction is at all levels, individually and collectively,"" said Blanc. ""We scored goals, created lots of chances and kept the ball despite the difficult weather conditions. ""Our philosophy for the game is the same whatever team we put out. There are players who have little playing time but they always demonstrate their qualities."" Blanc retained his preferred 4-3-3 system with Cavani filling in the role of Swedish star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, missing with an injured knee. PSG raced into a three minute lead when Brazil midfielder Lucas, unattended by the far post, volleyed the ball past Lorient keeper Fabien Audard in a move begun by Lucas Digne. Menez doubled their advantage five minutes before the interval, outfoxing Baptiste Reynet, who had come on to replace the injured Audard between the Lorient posts. The Ligue 1 champions were running riot in the rain and Cavani's header made it three after stoic work by Lucas to tighten their grip on the game before they headed off to the dressing rooms. Lorient never looked capable of fighting their way back and the final word fittingly went to PSG when Cavani fired in a rebound after a late corner taken by Menez to cap a good night's work in the French capital. That was the Uruguayan's ninth of the season and he now heads the Ligue 1 scoring charts. While Lorient were left hovering just three points above the relegation zone for PSG this win will act as an ideal springboard to next week's Champions League date with Anderlecht. Monaco, who had sat second on goal difference before Friday's action in the French capital, can reduce the gap when they face third-placed Lille on Sunday."

130,27/10/2013,23:36,"Football: PSG stay unbeaten, top after controversial draw",Paris Saint-Germain were 60 seconds from their first defeat of the season on Sunday before a desperate equaliser from Blaise Matuidi salvaged a 2-2 draw at Saint-Etienne and kept them top of Ligue 1.,"In a match full of drama and controversy, Saint-Etienne threw away a 2-0 second half lead albeit hindered by a red card which allowed Laurent Blanc's men back in the match. The point allowed PSG to cling to top spot as they lead Monaco on goal difference after Claudio Ranieri's side defeated Lyon 2-1 earlier in the day. ""It was a difficult evening for Paris and an intense match but I enjoyed myself regardless,"" said Blanc. ""PSG have to understand that we are going to come up against very good, organised teams and we were in a great stadium tonight. ""We gave them two goals which were terrible defensive mistakes and we were punished. ""I thought we were average and Saint-Etienne fully deserved at least a point."" added the former France and Bordeaux handler. Midfielder Benjamin Corgnet opened the scoring after just 18 minutes when he took advantage of a missed clearance from Brazilian centre-back Marquinhos to crash the ball past a static Salvatore Sirigu in the PSG goal. The visitors failed to convert their possession dominance as they chased an equaliser and fell further behind in comical circumstances six minutes after the break. Sirigu came out of his goal to collect a cross but tangled with his own defender Alex which allowed Romain Hamouma to clip the ball into an empty goal. It was the first time since last March that PSG had conceded two goals in a league match -- ironically against the same opposition. But the turning point occurred on 59 minutes when Fabien Lemoine tangled with Ezequiel Lavezzi who elbowed him in the face leaving him covered in blood. Referee Ruddy Buquet saw the incident differently and sent off the furious Frenchman who may have been dismissed for dissent in the heat of the moment. The red card swung the momentum in favour of Blanc's men and when Edinson Cavani stabbed the ball home from close range after a good pass from Brazilian defender Maxwell, the comeback was half completed. However stubborn defending from Saint-Etienne and some rousing support almost inspired Christophe Galtier's League Cup holders to victory. But with seconds remaining a looping ball into the penalty area from Matuidi eluded Saint-Etienne 'keeper Stephane Ruffier and bounced into the net. Earlier at the Louis II stadium, Ligue 1's top scorer Radamel Falcao found the target for the first time in four matches as he helped Monaco defeat Lyon 2-1. The former Atletico Madrid striker chipped Lyon 'keeper Anthony Lopes in the 36th minute following Mounir Obbadi's 28th minute opener as Claudio Ranieri's men extended their unbeaten run to seven wins and four draws in 11 outings. French striker Bafetimbi Gomis gave the visitors hope with 28 minutes left when he powered home a close-range header but it wasn't enough as Lyon suffered their fifth defeat. ""It was important for Falcao to score and when he scores Monaco usually win and we have to win all our matches if we want to stay at the top,"" explained Monaco's Portuguese defender Ricardo Carvalho. Lille slip to third, two points back behind PSG and Monaco following their disciplined 1-0 win at Nantes on Friday. Earlier on Sunday, Bordeaux rode two late goals from Mali international Cheikh Diabate and Polish winger Ludovic Obraniak to defeat Montpellier 2-0 in a battle of former champions at the Chaban Delmas stadium."
131,27/10/2013,19:14,Football: Falcao swoops again as Monaco back top of Ligue 1,Ligue 1's top scorer Rademel Falcao found the target for the first time in four matches on Sunday as he helped Monaco move one point clear of Paris Saint-Germain with a 2-1 win over Lyon.,"Paris Saint-Germain are the only other unbeaten side in France and could reclaim the top spot later on Sunday when they travel to a Saint-Etienne outfit, they failed to beat last season. Colombian hitman Falcao took his season's tally to eight goals in 11 matches and surprisingly came in for criticism in recent weeks after a brief drought of three fixtures without scoring. The former Atletico Madrid striker chipped Lyon 'keeper Anthony Lopes in the 36th minute following Mounir Obbadi's 28th minute opener as Claudio Ranieri's men extended their unbeaten run to seven wins and four draws in 11 outings. French striker Bafetimbi Gomis gave the visitors hope with 28 minutes left when he powered home a close-range header but it wasn't enough as Lyon suffered their fifth defeat. Lyon are in domestic free-fall as the seven-time champions endure one of the worst starts to their season in over a decade and have just three wins all season under embattled coach Remi Garde. ""We had a pretty easy first half but made life difficult for ourselves by conceding a goal,"" explained Monaco's Portuguese defender Ricardo Carvalho. ""It was important for Falcao to score and when he scores Monaco usually win and we have to win all our matches if we want to stay at the top,"" he added. Lille slip to third, one point behind PSG and two behind Monaco following their disciplined 1-0 win at Nantes on Friday. Earlier on Sunday, Bordeaux rode two late goals from Mali international Cheikh Diabate and Polish winger Ludovic Obraniak to defeat Montpellier in a battle of former champions at the Chaban Delmas stadium. The victory for the 'Girodins' eases them away from the relegation zone and up to 13th while Montpellier's dismal start to the season continues as they slip to three places above the relegation zone."
132,24/10/2013,13:30,Football: Ibra extending PSG's horizons to new frontiers,Zlatan Ibrahimovic remains the talk of Ligue 1 as the Sweden captain continues to carry leaders Paris Saint-Germain to heights they have rarely tasted before.,"The Swedish star's stunning Champions League quadruple was the cornerstone of PSG's 5-0 thrashing of Anderlecht on Wednesday. The 32-year-old has now scored 10 goals in his last five matches as Laurent Blanc's side continue their near perfect start to the season. Applauded off the pitch by the Brussels' faithful in a rare tribute to an away player, his form has hit new levels of greatness as the capital club stand on the brink of the European knockout phase, and have a two point lead to protect heading into Sunday's away fixture at Saint-Etienne. It was the club's record away victory in Champions League action and their 12 goals in three matches is the second highest tally in competition history behind Arsenal's 14 in 2010-11. ""He is in excellent form and scoring lots of goals,"" understated Blanc. ""But what I really appreciate is he is more and more involved in the play and he is very difficult to mark. ""I had the chance to play with some great players and he is a great player. He is like a locomotive for the others and pulls everyone to greater heights."" continued the former France and Bordeaux handler. Monaco are the only other unbeaten side in the league and could only look on with envy as PSG stole the midweek headlines while coach Claudio Ranieri must rally the troops for Sunday's home match against Lyon after being held 2-2 by lowly Sochaux in their last outing. Questions have cropped up over Monaco's title credentials despite six wins in ten matches and after throwing away a two goal lead at Herve Renard's revamped Sochaux side, the match against struggling Lyon takes on added importance. Rejuvenated Nantes are enjoying a new lease of life as the eight-time champions have a chance to move level with Monaco in what is a tasty appetiser on Friday, at home to third-placed Lille. Last season's runners-up Marseille have seen their season nosedive after losing 1-0 at Nice last week and crashing to a third straight Champions League defeat against Napoli on Tuesday. Elie Baup's side have fallen seven points off the pace and have already suffered three domestic defeats but a home match against lower table Reims on Saturday, may be the remedy to get back to winning ways. Bordeaux who won the 2008 title under Blanc have also seen their fortunes turn sour and they come into their home match against Montpellier sixth from bottom and only four points above the relegation zone. Renard has already enhanced his reputation after inspiring Sochaux's comeback last week and the 45-year-old, who memorably led Zambia to their first African championship in 2012, will relish the trip to a Lorient side just one point above them, near the foot of the table. Elsewhere, Toulouse host Rennes, Guingamp await Ajaccio, Nice visit Bastia and Valenciennes are at home to Evian on the Saturday evening slate. Fixtures (all times 1800 GMT unless stated) Friday: Nantes v Lille (1830) Saturday: Marseille v Reims (1500), Lorient v Sochaux, Toulouse v Rennes, Guingamp v Ajaccio, Bastia v Nice, Valenciennes v Evian Sunday: Bordeaux v Montpellier (1200), Monaco v Lyon (1500), Saint-Etienne v Paris Saint-Germain (1900)"
133,04/10/2013,02:35,Football: Old rivals Marseille out to end PSG run,"Monaco may have emerged as Paris Saint-Germain's main rivals in the Ligue 1 title race this season, but the biggest game for the reigning champions is still against their bitter old foes Marseille.","The clubs meet at the Stade Velodrome on Sunday night in the fixture that the French have come to call the 'Classique'. The mega-rich title-holders from the capital will be guaranteed their usual warm welcome in the Mediterranean port city, home to arguably the most passionate fans anywhere in France. As it stands PSG trail Ligue 1 leaders Monaco on goal difference while Marseille are a point further back in third. There is plenty of incentive, then, for Elie Baup's side to continue their impressive record at home to PSG down the years. OM have lost just one of their last nine home meetings with the club from the capital, with that 4-2 reverse coming in October 2008. However, Marseille's recent record has been rather patchy, with just two wins from seven games since the beginning of last month, and they come into the clash off the back of a chastening 3-0 defeat away to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday. ""We know the importance of the game,"" said Baup. ""We need to put the Champions League to one side and start focusing on our domestic league once again. ""We have been on a good run, like Paris, so I don't think the defeat (in Dortmund) will leave any traces."" PSG are unbeaten in 11 matches in all competitions this season and have not lost in 19 games in Ligue 1 since a 1-0 loss at Reims on March 2. It is their longest unbeaten sequence since a record 27-game stretch during their title-winning 1993-94 campaign and their display in beating Benfica 3-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday would have made for ominous viewing for anyone with Marseille connections. ""We are eager for the Marseille game to come around but we need some time to savour this win first,"" said PSG coach, former OM defender, Blanc after the performance against Benfica. ""Marseille will be the last game of a long series (of seven games in 23 days) and we play football to be involved in matches like this,"" added PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu. One man who will not play in the game is captain Thiago Silva, who is still sidelined with a thigh injury, while Marseille are hoping striker Andre-Pierre Gignac -- scorer of a brace in a 2-2 draw between the clubs at the Velodrome last season -- can return after a toe problem. Meanwhile, Monaco, who have already taken four points from trips to Marseille and Paris this season, will be hoping to extend their unbeaten start when they entertain Saint-Etienne in the principality on Saturday afternoon. ""Saint-Etienne are a direct rival for us. I think they will be competing at the top of the table right to the end of the season,"" said Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri, who has doubts over left-back Layvin Kurzawa and former Saint-Etienne striker Emmanuel Riviere and will be without Jeremy Toulalan for the game. That could open the door to a starting berth for Colombian winger James Rodriguez, who has struggled to make an impact since his 45 million-euro ($61m) summer move from Porto. ""For James Rodriguez, it is a problem of mentality,"" explained Ranieri. ""He thinks like a forward but must also defend."" The three sides tipped to fight it out at the top of the table before the season began have already opened up a gap on the rest, but Lille have lost just once in six games to climb up to fourth before hosting Fabrizio Ravanelli's Ajaccio. Lyon have won just one of their last six games before travelling to Montpellier, who are traditionally strong at home, on Sunday. Fixtures (kick-offs 1800 GMT unless stated)"
134,29/09/2013,23:17,Football: Monaco go top despite being held at Reims,Monaco moved back to the summit of Ligue 1 on Sunday despite being held to a 1-1 at Reims as the momentum swung again at the top in France.,"After Antoine Devaux had given the Champagne-region outfit a shock fourth-minute lead with a close range header, Portuguese international Joao Moutinho opened his season's scoring account with a brilliant free-kick that flew inside the near post nine minutes later. Up until Sunday, Colombian Radamel Falcao and Frenchman Emmanuelle Riviere had scored all of Monaco's goals in the league. Reims almost snatched a shock winner in the 86th minute but Togo international Floyd Ayite was denied by Monaco's Croatian 'keeper Danijel Subasic despite being clear on goal. In a feisty finale, Reims had Atlia Turan sent off for a second bookable offence with two minutes left, but Monaco were unable to capitalise. Claudio Ranieri's men however, have seen their two-point cushion at the top slashed to goal difference over Paris Saint-Germain who defeated Toulouse 2-0 on Saturday, as both clubs ended the weekend's action with identical records of five victories and three draws. ""We gave up a stupid goal early in the match and it's the second time we've started badly,"" explained Monaco captain Eric Abidal. ""It was important to be collective and efficient and we didn't do that. Reims played well and tryed to catch us on the counter but we just weren't clinical in front of goal. ""Even when they were down to ten men, they still created chances."" Marseille are in third on 17 points with Lille and Nice in fourth and fifth respectively, just ahead of Nantes and Saint-Etienne. Promoted Nantes continued their fine start to the campaign earlier on Sunday with a display reminiscent of the style that made them eight-time champions as they defeated Rennes 3-1. The afternoon kick-off at Rennes's Stade de la Route de l'Orient produced a feisty derby that was eventually taken over by the 'Canaries' thanks to strikes from Filip Djordjevic, Serge Gakpe and an injury time clincher from Lucas Deaux. ""We had a very good first half and produced good play and created good chances,"" said their 50-year-old Armenian-Franco coach Michel Der Zakarian. ""We should have been 3-0 up at half-time because we should have had a clear penalty and after we had a black spell at the start of the second half."" His slick passing formation outwitted their hosts in midfield and which led to Djordjevic's headed opener after just 17 minutes. In front of a crowd of some 25,000, Rennes, who suffered only their second league defeat, pushed forward in search of an equaliser only to slip further behind with a brilliant Nantes second on the stroke of half-time. Togo international Gakpe, cut into the box before turning two defenders inside out and then hooking a low shot around Rennes 'keeper Benoit Costil and into the far corner. Nelson Oliveira then broke through for Rennes on 55 minutes after the ball pin-balled into his path and he made no mistake with his one-on-one duel against Nantes number one Remy Riou to pull it back to 2-1. Der Zakarian's men then had to endure a nerve shredding finale before Lucas Deaux finished off a counter-attack deep into injury time to make the scoreline 3-1. Fabrizio Ravanelli's Ajaccio side followed their first win of the season against Lyon in midweek with a hard earned 1-1 draw at home to 2012 champions Montpellier. The Corsican side went behind when Ajaccio-born midfielder Remy Cabella converted a ninth minute penalty before grabbing a share of the points with Ronald Zubar's header 10 minutes before the break."
135,27/09/2013,02:25,Football: Trio continue tussle for top spot in France,Defending champions Paris Saint-Germain and fellow title hopefuls Marseille will continue to jostle for Ligue 1 supremacy with early-season pace-setters Monaco this weekend.,"Claudio Ranieri's principality side retained their two-point lead at the top with a 3-0 win at home to Bastia in midweek, as PSG and Marseille kept pace with respective victories over Valenciennes and Saint-Etienne. Radamel Falcao scored twice at the Stade Louis II on Wednesday to take his season's tally to a league-best seven goals, as Monaco extended their best start to a Ligue 1 campaign. ""As a striker of course I'm always happy when I score and that was again the case in the victory against Bastia,"" said Falcao. ""For us it was important to win, thanks to the victory, we stay top,"" added the Colombian. Ranieri, though, said it was premature to cast Monaco, who only returned to the top flight this season after a two-year absence, as genuine title challengers despite their strong start. ""I think it's too early to say we've sent out a signal (to the other teams) but we continue to reaffirm our good start to the season. ""With the results we play with confidence and calmness,"" said Ranieri, who dismissed the significance of being first in the table so early in the campaign. ""The standings? The important thing is the way in which the team moves forward,"" explained the Italian. On Sunday Monaco travel to mid-table Reims who have lost just once in seven outings and conceded only one goal since mid-August. Second-placed PSG, who are in the middle of a run of five fixtures in 15 days, return to the capital on Saturday to host Toulouse. Alain Casanova's men were languishing in the bottom three a fortnight ago but back-to-back victories have catapulted Toulouse up to 11th. Meanwhile, PSG put the disappointment of Sunday's 1-1 draw with Monaco behind them as Edinson Cavani struck the decisive goal in a 1-0 win away to Valenciennes. ""We got the main thing, the three points, because there was a lot of fatigue (on Wednesday). We had a difficult match but it won't be the first, nor the last this season,"" said PSG midfielder Blaise Matuidi. ""We had to recover the two points dropped at home to Monaco, and we did that. Now we have to continue our march forward,"" added the France international. The fixture marks a return to the Parc des Princes for Clement Chantome, who left Paris in the summer to join Toulouse on loan. Despite strong ties to PSG, who are unbeaten so far this term and have not lost any of their last 18 Ligue 1 games, a confident Chantome insisted Toulouse were capable of causing a surprise this weekend. ""We should go there to play the game. PSG are a beatable team when they doubt (themselves),"" said Chantome. Marseille, who are a point behind PSG in third, visit Lorient in Saturday's early game seeking to build on Tuesday's 2-1 win over Saint-Etienne. Joint-leading scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac could return for Marseille after the burly forward was back in training on Thursday following a toe problem, while Jeremie Aliadiere may be welcomed back into the Lorient line-up after a six-week injury lay-off. Elsewhere, Lyon will seek to bounce back from a defeat to lowly Ajaccio when they host Lille, while Saint-Etienne are at home to Bastia and Rennes entertain Nantes in a local derby. Valenciennes go to Sochaux, who are without a coach following the resignation of Eric Hely, in a bottom of the table clash. Fixtures (kick-off 1800GMT unless stated)"
136,24/09/2013,23:14,Football: Marseille get back to winning ways,Marseille put their recent patchy form behind them to beat Saint-Etienne 2-1 at the Stade Velodrome in Ligue 1 on Tuesday evening.,"After a fine start to the season, OM had gone four matches without a win in all competitions before hosting Les Verts. However, Saint-Etienne had not won in Marseille since August 1979, when Michel Platini was among the scorers, and their miserable record in the fixture was extended as they failed to fully recover from the concession of two first-half goals. Elie Baup's side came flying out of the blocks and opened the scoring in the 22nd minute when Benjamin Mendy connected first-time with a Mathieu Valbuena cross from the right, his shot bouncing over the stranded Stephane Ruffier and into the net. The young full-back's first Ligue 1 goal was followed by a first top-flight goal for midfielder Giannelli Imbula four minutes later. Imbula slotted low past Ruffier from a Rod Fanni cross at the end of a fine Marseille move, to leave Saint-Etienne facing a second straight defeat already. The visitors were handed a lifeline just after the half-hour mark when Alaixys Romao was harshly adjudged to have handled a Yohan Mollo cross right on the edge of the area and Faouzi Ghoulam stepped up to slot the penalty past Steve Mandanda in goal. However, they could not find an equaliser, and might have lost by more goals, with Ruffier notably saving twice from Valbuena before the interval. ""After they came back to 2-1 we found things a bit more complicated,"" admitted Baup, speaking to Canal Plus television after the game. ""But we have played well since the start of season, even in losing to Monaco and Arsenal, and we were rewarded tonight."" The win takes Marseille above Saint-Etienne and provisionally into second place in the table, behind leaders Monaco on goal difference before the unbeaten principality club play host to Bastia on Wednesday. Earlier on Tuesday, Lille followed up their weekend 2-0 win at Sochaux with a convincing 3-0 home victory against Evian. Salomon Kalou's neat back-flick turned a Florent Balmont shot into the net to give Lille an early lead in France's far north, and the unfortunate Jesper Hansen then scored an own-goal 32 minutes in. The Danish goalkeeper, who was making his Ligue 1 debut, did well to tip a Nolan Roux header onto the bar, but the ball then richocheted off him and into the net to make it 2-0. Ronny Rodelin then took advantage of poor defending to seal the victory in the second half. Among the other games on Wednesday, defending champions Paris Saint-Germain, who trail the leaders by two points, go to struggling Valenciennes without captain Thiago Silva, who faces six weeks out with a thigh injury."
137,23/09/2013,17:37,Football: Leaders Monaco out to extend stay at top,Ligue 1 pace-setters Monaco will aim to build on Sunday's battling 1-1 draw at defending champions Paris Saint-Germain when they host Bastia on Wednesday.,"Monaco were second best at the Parc des Princes but came away with a point in the first meeting between France's two biggest spenders, to open up a two-point lead at the top of the table. Claudio Ranieri's side welcome 10th-place Bastia to the Stade Louis II as part of a full programme of midweek fixtures in France, leaving Monaco just three days to recover from Sunday's trip to the capital. ""It's a very good point to pick up. It was a difficult match against an excellent Paris team,"" said Monaco midfielder Mounir Obbadi of the draw in the capital. ""Now, we have to recover very quickly because we play again (on Wednesday) against Bastia, another very difficult match,"" added the Moroccan. Monaco are one of the league's two remaining unbeaten sides, along with PSG, and 60-million-euro ($81 million) striker Radamel Falcao has adapted well to life in Ligue 1, having netted five goals in six matches, including the equaliser on Sunday. ""Both teams tried to win and had their chances. In the end it was a draw. The most important thing for us is that the result keeps us top of the standings,"" said Falcao. ""We're making strides as a team. Personally, I'm especially happy to have scored because we stay first,"" added the Colombian. PSG, who climbed a spot to second after surpassing Saint-Etienne on goal difference, travel to lowly Valenciennes, who have lost five in a row following their lone victory on the opening weekend of the season. France midfielder Blaise Matuidi praised Monaco's display on Sunday but conceded the Parisians felt they should have won and vowed that PSG would bounce back at the Stade du Hainaut. ""Monaco showed they have a good team, even if I thought we were better than them (on Sunday). We'll hope to return to winning ways with a victory at Valenciennes on Wednesday,"" said Matuidi. Despite netting a fifth-minute opener, Zlatan Ibrahimovic endured a difficult evening against Monaco, spurning several chances to add to his haul, and echoed Matuidi's sense of regret. ""We're disappointed because we should have won the match. We played at home and we had a lot of chances. We scored but made an error for their equaliser and we paid for it,"" said the Swede, whose goal was just his second of the campaign. ""This season there's more pressure on us. We're the champions and everyone wants to beat us."" Ibrahimovic's partnership with club record signing Edinson Cavani again failed to sparkle, but the former stressed the need for patience. ""My understanding with Cavani? It's coming, it's coming,"" said Ibrahimovic. PSG will be without captain Thiago Silva, who could be out for several weeks, after the Brazilian defender sustained a thigh injury at the weekend. Third-place Saint-Etienne travel to Marseille on Tuesday knowing that a victory at the Velodrome would send Christophe Galtier's side top, for 24 hours at least. However, Marseille, who are a point behind Tuesday's opponents, could also move to the summit should they win by a three-goal margin. The hosts will be without forward Andre-Pierre Gignac, though, who was ruled out for seven to 10 days with a toe problem. Elsewhere, Nice, fresh off a 4-0 thumping of Valenciennes in the opening game at their new Allianz Riviera stadium, travel to Nantes, while Lyon are away to winless Ajaccio. Evian go to Lille on Tuesday and Montpellier entertain Rennes on Thursday. Fixtures (kick-off 1700GMT unless stated)"

The draw kept Monaco in first place on 14 points, two ahead of PSG, who moved into second, ahead of Saint-Etienne on goal difference. ""It was a good match. Paris played well but so did we,"" said Monaco boss Claudio Ranieri. ""We tried to win right up until the end and I'm very satisfied. I have no regrets. ""I know that Paris have a lot of quality and more experience than our players, so I'm happy,"" the Italian continued. PSG coach Laurent Blanc made one change to the side that beat Olympiakos 4-1 midweek in the Champions League with Argentine winger Ezequiel Lavezzi replacing Lucas Moura on the left side of an attacking trio. Ranieri, meanwhile, kept faith with the team that beat Lorient 1-0 last weekend as Mounir Obbadi continued alongside Geoffrey Kondogbia in central midfield with Jeremy Toulalan still out injured. Ibrahimovic had endured a slow start to the season with just one goal prior to Sunday, but last year's leading scorer made an immediate impact at the Parc des Princes as he gave PSG a fifth-minute lead. Thiago Silva's raking downfield ball picked out the run of left-back Maxwell who crossed for Ibrahimovic to volley past Danijel Subasic from close range. The hosts were dealt a blow on the quarter-hour, though, as Silva limped off with a hamstring injury to be replaced by Zoumana Camara. Falcao then hauled Monaco level on 20 minutes as he threw himself at Joao Moutinho's teasing cross into the box, the Colombian bravely putting his body on the line to head beyond Salvatore Sirigu. Monaco's Yannick Ferreira Carrasco fired just over on the volley shortly after, while Edinson Cavani dragged a shot wide of the far post after clever interplay between himself and Ibrahimovic. The Swede then wasted a glorious chance to add to his tally and restore PSG's advantage as he headed over after being left completely unmarked as Lavezzi swung in a dangerous free-kick. And Ibrahimovic was again guilty of botching another opening just moments later. Played through by Marco Verratti, the striker elected to cut back onto his right foot and, rather than shooting, over hit a chip towards the far post as he tried to pick out an advancing Lavezzi. There was further frustration for Ibrahimovic after the interval as he flicked a low cross from Lavezzi the wrong side of the post. Ferreira Carrasco volleyed wide when well placed, while substitute James Rodriguez and Layvin Kurzawa took turns to test Sirigu from distance but the contest began to peter out as the second half wore on. However, Cavani twice very nearly snatched all three points for PSG in stoppage time. The Uruguayan was firstly denied by a fantastic sliding intervention from Andrea Raggi after he chested down Blaise Matuidi's lofted pass and shot on the turn before he sent a header narrowly wide of the near post as Monaco withstood a late threat. ""We played a very good match, unfortunately we weren't able to get that decisive goal,"" said PSG midfielder Blaise Matuidi. ""We put them in difficulty, we had the chances but we failed to take them. We can be happy with the performance we produced, (it was) one of the best of the season."" Earlier, Lyon halted a run of six matches without a victory as they beat promoted Nantes 3-1.

Marseille were struggling following a 2-1 reverse against Arsenal in their Champions League group opener in midweek as Elie Baup's men ran into a frustrating Corsican side who stifled their attack. ""We played 48 hours after an intense match against Arsenal which sapped us of a lot of energy,"" explained Baup. ""We had a lot of possession in the second half and it's a pity we couldn't convert that into a goal. ""We need to remain solid and congratulate the squad after four away matches in six games. Even when we were in trouble, we showed strong mental strength,"" he added. OM 'keeper Steve Mandanda was called into action during a frantic first-half that saw him halt Sebastien Squillaci as well as diverting shots from Tunisian Wahbi Khazri and Romanian striker Claudiu Keseru. ""These kind of matches, when we had three good chances, and if you put one of them away is the key to victory,"" said Bastia coach Frederic Hantz. ""We're happy with the point. At the end of the match, when you look at Marseille who were coming off a series of important matches, it didn't surprise me that they took control. ""There is a certain amount of satisfaction to hold one of the best teams in France and we feel like we're advancing which is positive,"" he added. ""We're a bit disappointed not to win especially after our first half but we're happy with our progress and to hold a big team in the championship."" During the second half, Marseille took control but failed to convert their chances, notably from French international winger Mathieu Valbuena and Florian Thauvin which could have made the difference.

Bastia retain their place in the upper half of Ligue 1 on eight points, five behind Claudio Ranieri's Cote d'Azur outfit.

And Les Verts, out of the Europa League,  began promisingly, with Romain Hamouma capitalising on a mistake from Toulouse goalkeeper Ali Ahamada to put the visitors into an 18th minute lead. This was the 26-year-old's third goal of the season. The home side drew back level after the hour when Danish striker Martin Braithwaite, a close season recruit, slid home a close range effort. Guinean defender Issiaga Sylla completed the comeback with quarter of an hour remaining, to give Toulouse a much-needed lift and leave Saint-Etienne treading water in second, on 12 points, sandwiched between billionaire duo Monaco and third-placed PSG. Toulouse's reward was to move up four places to 15th. Sunday's headline encounter at Parc des Princes, the first clash of the season between two of Europe's newest financial heavyweights, is set to indicate who has the early edge in France. Both teams are off to unbeaten starts although Monaco come into the match one point clear of Saint-Etienne while PSG are two points back but starting to change gears after an eye-catching 4-1 win over Olympiakos in midweek gave their Champions League quest a dream start.

It was enough to move Saint-Etienne a point above Paris Saint-Germain at the top of Ligue 1 following the champions' 2-0 win at Bordeaux on Friday. Big-spending Monaco could go back to the summit if they win at home to Lorient on Sunday. New Turkish attacking signing Mevlut Erding, formerly of PSG, may have drawn a blank but his supporting act stepped up to the mark in fine style. Corgnet slotted into an empty net on 17 minutes after home goalkeeper Nicolas Penneteau had denied Hamouma. The latter then doubled the advantage on 47 minutes, beating Penneteau with a fine strike from 20 yards. Corgnet wrapped up the victory with a shot through Penneteau's legs from Hamouma's cross six minutes later. Valenciennes' sole response came from a generously-awarded penalty when the referee gave handball against Bayal Sall. Midfielder Corgnet said it was his positioning further forward, behind the front man, that had made the difference. ""That's two matches now that I've played in the hole (behind the striker), my favourite role,"" he said. ""We've been playing better these last two matches and it's a pleasure to be a part of this team."" Earlier, former European champions Marseille had needed a late goal from Brazilian defender Lucas Mendes to snatch a point against the team that began the day bottom of the league. Victory would have taken the team from Provence back to the top of the table, a position they had lost when going down 2-1 at home to Monaco before the international break. ""We had some good periods, especially in the first half, some real quality moves, well co-ordinated, but we didn't turn them into goals,"" said Marseille coach Elie Baup. Marseille created, and squandered, several opportunities, including a shocking miss by Dimitri Payet, who failed to find the net while goalkeeper Ali Ahamada lay helpless on the ground. Ahamada then made an important save to deny France winger Mathieu Valbuena before Toulouse took a shock lead as Wissam Ben Yedder slotted home a pass from Dane, Martin Braithwaite. It would have been enough to secure a first win of the season but Mendes headed home a Valbuena free-kick three minutes from time to earn a point. Even so, Baup's team will need to up their game considerably if they are to gain anything at home to Arsenal in the Champions League in midweek. ""we will have to go looking to make things happen with mental strength, we will have to work hard because our team depends on a lot of collectivity,"" said Baup. On Friday, France midfielder Blaise Matuidi put PSG ahead from a precise Zlatan Ibrahimovic pass before Brazilian winger Lucas Moura sealed the victory for Laurent Blanc's team in the second half. It was a dominant performance from the champions against woeful opponents as PSG demonstrated they are starting to find their feet under Carlo Ancelotti's replacement. Sochaux dropped to the bottom of the table following a 1-0 defeat at Nantes, who moved up to sixth.

PSG are yet to lose this season, but draws in their opening two Ligue 1 games were followed by not entirely convincing wins against promoted duo Nantes and Guingamp just before the international break. However, they have already had the measure of Bordeaux, beating the French Cup holders 2-1 in the Champions Trophy at the beginning of last month. It will be a special occasion for Blanc, whose three years in charge at the Stade Chaban-Delmas were highly successful, with Bordeaux winning the title, the League Cup and the Champions Trophy in 2009 before reaching the last eight of the Champions League a year later. Now in the away dugout, he must improve PSG's rather poor record in the Gironde, where they have won just seven times in 39 previous visits. ""Bordeaux is a city I really like. The people there are quite reserved, like me. I like that mentality,"" said Blanc. ""I had three great years there and only have happy memories. It is a pleasure to go back."" On Friday, Blanc will again be without Jeremy Menez, who is suffering from kidney stones, and must decide whether his returning international stars, such as Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimovic, France's Blaise Matuidi, Brazil's Thiago Silva and Uruguay's Edinson Cavani, are in condition to play. Another of his internationals, Argentina's Ezequiel Lavezzi, has not been named in the squad. ""With this run of seven matches in 23 days, we are obliged to rotate the squad,"" Blanc admitted. ""That is why we have the squad we do. We need to look at the physical condition of all those who have been on international duty, because some had still not come back by Thursday afternoon. Cavani will only return on Friday."" France's other representatives in the Champions League group stage are Marseille, who travel to bottom club Toulouse on Saturday. Before hosting Arsenal in Europe next Wednesday, OM will be looking to get back to winning ways domestically after a 2-1 home loss to Monaco in their last outing. Since that game, coach Elie Baup has seen France under-20 World Cup-winning duo Florian Thauvin and Mario Lemina arrive from Lille and Lorient respectively, and Baup has confirmed that Thauvin will feature with Andre Ayew suspended.

148,12/09/2013,02:25,"Football: Blanc, PSG renew acquaintances with Bordeaux",Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc returns to his old stomping ground of Bordeaux on Friday as the reigning Ligue 1 title holders look for a pre-Champions League boost.,"The French capital club travel to Greece to face Olympiacos in Europe next Tuesday, but the clash with Bordeaux is the first of a hectic run of seven games in 23 days which will also see them face Monaco, Benfica and Marseille. PSG are yet to lose this season, but draws in their opening two Ligue 1 games were followed by not entirely convincing wins against promoted duo Nantes and Guingamp just before the international break. However, they have already had the measure of Bordeaux, beating the French Cup holders 2-1 in the Champions Trophy at the beginning of last month. ""Bordeaux are one of these teams who are capable of defending well and punishing you on the break,"" PSG's Christophe Jallet said this week. ""We saw that in the Champions Trophy before we turned the game around late on. We know what to expect and what we need to do better against them this time around."" It will be a special occasion for Blanc, whose three years in charge at the Stade Chaban-Delmas were highly successful, with Bordeaux winning the title, the League Cup and the Champions Trophy in 2009 before reaching the last eight of the Champions League a year later. Now in the away dugout, he must improve PSG's rather poor record in the Gironde, where they have won just seven times in 39 previous visits. On Friday, Blanc will again be without Jeremy Menez, who is suffering from kidney stones, and must decide whether his returning international stars, such as Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimovic, France's Blaise Matuidi, Brazil's Thiago Silva and Uruguay's Edinson Cavani, are in condition to play. ""Zlatan came back very, very tired after playing in Kazakhstan on an artificial surface,"" PSG assistant coach Jean-Louis Gasset said in a radio interview, indicating that Ibrahimovic may not feature this weekend. France's other representatives in the Champions League group stage are Marseille, who travel to bottom club Toulouse on Saturday. Before hosting Arsenal in Europe next Wednesday, OM will be looking to get back to winning ways domestically after a 2-1 home loss to Monaco in their last outing. Since that game, coach Elie Baup has seen France under-20 World Cup-winning duo Florian Thauvin and Mario Lemina arrive from Lille and Lorient respectively, and it is possible that they could make their debuts for the club. The early pacesetters are Claudio Ranieri's Monaco, who have no European commitments to worry about and who entertain Lorient at the Stade Louis II on Sunday before travelling to face PSG. The principality club should be able to call on Radamel Falcao, who suffered an ankle injury in the win at Marseille but played in Colombia's 2-0 defeat in Uruguay in World Cup qualifying in midweek, while France midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia could make his debut after his recent arrival from Sevilla.

149,05/09/2013,02:15,Football: France continue search for goals in Georgia,Shot-shy France need to find a cure to their goalscoring ills when they face Georgia in a tricky World Cup qualifying fixture in Tbilisi on Friday evening.,"Didier Deschamps's side come into this month's qualifying double-header in Georgia and Belarus in second place in Group I, a point behind leaders Spain and four points clear of Finland in third. Finishing above the reigning European and world champions may be beyond Les Bleus, but they should still be strong enough to claim second place and a spot in November's two-legged play-offs. Nevertheless, to win in Georgia -- where Spain toiled to a 1-0 win earlier in the campaign -- and go on to reach next year's finals in Brazil, France must sort out their problems in front of goal. Following last month's 0-0 friendly draw in Belgium, France have now gone six hours without scoring since their 3-1 win against the Georgians at the Stade de France in March. It is largely because of their struggles in front of goal that Deschamps's side have lost four of their six matches in 2013 and the focal point of criticism amongst fans and the media has been Karim Benzema. The Real Madrid striker is supposed to be the national team's star man, and yet he has not scored in 19 and a quarter hours on the field at international level since bagging a brace in a friendly against Estonia ahead of Euro 2012. ""Karim keeps being mentioned because of his lack of goals for us. I hope he puts an end to that as soon as possible,"" bemoaned Deschamps before the squad departed on Wednesday for Tbilisi, where the game will be played at 2215 local time (1815 GMT) to fit in with peak television viewing times in France. Benzema has no shortage of support from his colleagues, with Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny saying: ""His qualities can't have disappeared overnight. He just needs that trigger to regain his confidence. The team is right behind him."" But while France boast the 2012-13 European player of the season in their ranks in Franck Ribery, as well as Marseille's Mathieu Valbuena, who excelled in the home win against Georgia, Deschamps must decide who to play in front of his chief creators. He has options beyond simply sticking with Benzema at the head of a 4-2-3-1, with one being to pair the 25-year-old with Arsenal's Olivier Giroud, scorer of the winning goal in last weekend's north London derby against Tottenham Hotspur. Another option is for Deschamps to hand a start to Andre-Pierre Gignac, the burly Marseille striker who was handed his first call-up since the 2010 World Cup after scoring three goals in the first three games of the Ligue 1 season. ""The coach must make choices. We are lucky to have quality strikers and that should give us strength rather than be a problem,"" insisted Arsenal full-back Bacary Sagna. ""Giroud is as much at ease at his club as he is with France. But we point the finger at Karim because he is a centre-forward and that is unfair. The rest of us players need to give him more support."" Elsewhere, with Tottenham's Etienne Capoue and Lyon's Clement Grenier having pulled out due to injury, it seems likely that Josuha Guilavogui and Geoffrey Kondogbia will play together in central midfield. Kondogbia won his first cap against Belgium last month before joining Monaco from Sevilla for 20 million euros ($26.8 million), while Guilavogui last weekend left Saint-Etienne for Atletico Madrid. Temuri Ketsbaia's Georgia side have collected just four points from five games and have scored just three goals in that run."
150,04/09/2013,19:08,Football: Lyon outcast Gomis comes in from cold,France striker Bafetimbi Gomis on Wednesday returned to training with the Lyon first team after a summer-long dispute with the Ligue 1 club.,"Gomis had been training alone since the start of pre-season as Lyon sought to move on a player who will be out of contract next June unless he agreed to sign a contract extension, which he has so far refused to do. The former Saint-Etienne forward, who earns in the region of 3.5 million euros ($4.6m) per year, saw a proposed move to Newcastle United fall through and refused to be forced out. Following the closure of the summer transfer window, he has now been reintegrated into Remi Garde's squad along with Jimmy Briand, who is also out of contract next June and had also been frozen out. ""It is in the interest of the institution, our employer, to reintegrate them. This marks the end of what has been a difficult transfer window,"" said Garde. The Lyon coach will now be hoping that the duo can help a young squad which has lost its last four games, including both legs of their Champions League play-off against Real Sociedad. ""We saw that the team could get by without them but struggled sometimes. The door is open to everyone once they are in the squad,"" he added."
151,01/09/2013,23:28,Football: Monaco go top in France after Velodrome victory,Newly promoted Monaco went top of Ligue 1 after coming from behind to defeat Marseille 2-1 in a thrilling encounter at the Velodrome on Sunday.,"The home side took the lead on the stroke of half-time when a Mathieu Valbuena corner from the left was headed home by Brazilian defender Lucas Mendes for his first goal in the French top flight on 43 minutes. However the lead was short lived as Monaco took advantage of some sloppy Marseille defending to equalise through Colombian record signing Radamel Falcao who crashed the ball home three minutes inside the second half for his third goal of the season. Frenchman Emmanuel Riviere then stole the headlines with 11 minutes left as he latched onto a sweet through ball from Portuguese midfielder Joao Moutinho before slotting the ball past former French number one Steeve Mandanda. It was Riviere's league leading fifth goal of the season. ""I finished off the work,"" said Riviere. ""My speed is my greatest quality and Im at 100% this season. ""It is my confidence which explains my success and the work I've put in. ""What is missing is finishing but my ambition is to target the France national team,"" he added. On a sour note for the 2004 Champions League finalists, Falcao came off with just over 15 minutes left with a right ankle problem although details of the injury remain uncertain. Monaco take their early season tally to 10 points from four matches while Saint-Etienne go joint second on nine with Marseille after defeating Bordeaux 2-1 earlier in the day and defending champions Paris Saint-Germain are on eight. Saint-Etienne bounced back from their midweek Europa League disappointment to beat Bordeaux 2-1 at home while Montpellier came back twice to force a 2-2 draw against fellow southerners Nice. At the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium where Saint-Etienne crashed out in the play-off round on Thursday, losing to Danish side Esbjerg 5-3 on aggregate, Sunday was another matter as goals from Romain Hamouma and captain Loic Perrin ensured there was no European hangover for Christophe Galtier's side. Meanwhile Nice played their last home match at the Stade du Ray before moving into a new venue but despite leading 1-0 and 2-1, Claude Puel's men were pegged back by the 2012 champions in an entertaining 2-2 draw. Galtier's side made it three wins from four as their midweek European disaster was put to one side and put them right in the thick of the title race on nine points. ""I expected a reaction after our Europa League elimination and the best response was the one we produced on the pitch even if there were times we suffered from fatigue and people playing out of position,"" said Galtier afterwards. ""It's a good win as we were coming off a big disappointment,"" he added. Josuha Guilavogui was held out of the hosts' squad with the France midfielder on the verge of a move to Atletico Madrid, but despite his absence Saint-Etienne went in front on eight minutes. Banel Nicolita was afforded too much time on the right and his teasing cross was volleyed expertly past Bordeaux goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso by Hamouma. The home side came close to a second just before half-time as Fabien Lemoine rattled the post, and Perrin went onto double their advantage five minutes after the break as he nodded in Benjamin Corgnet's free-kick. Ludovic Obraniak ensured the hosts were made to face a nervy finish as he cut the deficit with a thunderous strike in the 90th minute, but Saint-Etienne held on to record a third win in four outings and climb up to second."

154,25/08/2013,23:34,Football: Lavezzi grabs winner as PSG edge past Nantes,"Paris Saint-Germain recorded their first win of the French Ligue 1 season on Sunday, beating promoted Nantes 2-1 at the Stade de la Beaujoire.","When Edinson Cavani gave PSG a 24th-minute lead, it looked set to be a long night for their hosts, but they held on and equalised eight minutes into the second half when a Jordan Veretout free-kick was turned into his own net by Alex at the back post. However, Ezequiel Lavezzi got what proved to be the winner in the 74th minute, firing home the loose ball after a Lucas effort had been blocked on the line by Gabriel Cichero. With his choice of a 4-4-2 formation coming in for some criticism after the defending champions were held by Montpellier and then Ajaccio in their opening two games, PSG coach Laurent Blanc opted for a three-man attack here, with Lavezzi brought back in alongside Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. ""We could go back to the 4-4-2 but also (try out) other systems. We need to find a system which gives us balance,"" said Blanc. ""We have an attacking potential that many other clubs envy but we mustn't forget that to win a match we have to defend well."" Even against a five-man Nantes defence, PSG threatened to run riot in the early stages, with home goalkeeper Remy Riou racing off his line to deny Ibrahimovic before Cavani's first-time half-volley flashed just wide midway through the first half. Shortly after, Ibrahimovic and Cavani combined for the opening goal, with the latter racing on to the Swede's pass before firing low past Riou. Yet the visitors could not build on that and only a fine Salvatore Sirigu save prevented Cichero from equalising for Nantes from an overhead kick just before the break. The hosts did draw level soon after the restart when the unfortunate Alex, under pressure from Papy Djilobodji, saw a Jordan Veretout free-kick rebound off him and into the net at the back post. Sirigu then had to save well to keep out a net-bound Alejandro Bedoya header, but PSG silenced the 37,000 crowd when Lavezzi scored what proved to be the winner. Earlier on an attritional weekend in France's top flight, Nice were held to a goalless draw by Ajaccio in Corsica, while Saint-Etienne dropped their first points of the league campaign, going down 1-0 away to a young Lille side. Salomon Kalou scored the only goal from the penalty spot to deny Les Verts the chance to move level at the top of the table with leaders Marseille. ""Saint-Etienne are a team who often pose us problems,"" acknowledged Kalou, mindful that it was they who pipped Lille to a European place at the end of last season, having also knocked them out of both domestic cup competitions. Marseille end the weekend two points clear of Monaco at the summit after maintaining their perfect start to the season with a hard-fought 1-0 win at Valenciennes, Andre-Pierre Gignac netting a late winner. Monaco drew 0-0 at home to Toulouse on Friday in a game played behind closed doors at the Stade Louis II as a punishment for crowd trouble at the end of last season. Claudio Ranieri's side now travel to face Marseille in a top-of-the-table clash at the Stade Velodrome next Sunday. In contrast to Marseille, Lyon's perfect start to the campaign was ended in a 1-0 home defeat to Reims, as Odair Fortes's deflected effort gave the visitors the points after Clement Grenier had missed a penalty for the hosts in a second half delayed for 35 minutes because of torrential rain at the Stade de Gerland. That result came four days after Lyon's chances of making the Champions League group stage were severely compromised by a 2-0 home defeat to Real Sociedad in the first leg of their play-off."

Gignac turned in the loose ball with just five minutes remaining after Valenciennes goalkeeper Nicolas Penneteau had failed to hold Andre Ayew's header on Saturday afternoon.

After losing 2-0 at home to Real Sociedad in the first leg of their Champions League play-off on Tuesday to severely compromise their chances of qualifying for the group stage, OL failed to reproduce the form that had seen them win their first two Ligue 1 games of the season in style.

When play finally recommenced, Yoann Gourcuff almost got the breakthrough from a fiercely struck free-kick and then Alexandre Lacazette hit the bar from close range. The hosts were then awarded a penalty when substitute Jordan Ferri was bundled over in the box, but Clement Grenier contrived to blast the award over the bar. Reims then twisted the knife by snatching all three points when Odair Fortes' cross from the left deflected off Milan Bisevac and looped into the net. ""It is very tough to come away with nothing.

158,22/08/2013,16:58,Football: Monaco out to pile pressure on PSG,High flying Monaco have already lived up to their pre-season credentials as title challengers and Claudio Ranieri's side could be three points clear by Friday night if they defeat Toulouse at their Louis II stadium.,"The match however will be played behind closed doors as Monaco have been slapped with a one-match supporters ban following over zealous celebrations at the end of last season when they won promotion back into the top flight. On the pitch, sixty-million euro signing Radamel Falcao is off to an impressive start with two goals in two games since his move from Atletico Madrid. The Colombian celebrated the birth of his new daughter on the eve of his strike against Montpellier last Sunday which helped spark a 4-1 rout of the 2012 champions. Toulouse could only manage a 1-1 draw against French Cup winners Bordeaux for their only positive result in two openings and face an in-form Monaco side eager to build on their perfect start and keep the pressure on the chasing pack. Ranieri welcomes back Portuguese striker Joao Moutinho to his squad following injury but Frenchman Emmanuel Riviere is set to keep his place after scoring a league leading four goals in two matches. ""When a player is going well like that, you have to keep going with him,"" explained the 61-year-old Italian. Paris Saint-Germain have been the early disappointment in Ligue 1 and are still looking for their first win of the season since former France coach Laurent Blanc took over from Real Madrid-bound Carlo Ancelotti. It took a late equaliser from former Napoli striker Edinson Cavani to salvage a 1-1 home draw against Ajaccio who earned their first points of the season since Italian icon Fabrizio Ravanelli took over at the Corsican club. They travel to promoted Nantes in the final match of the weekend on Sunday desperate for a return on their massive investment which led them to their first French title last season since 1994 and a narrow defeat in the Champions League quarter-finals against Barcelona. The 'Canaries' are expected to employ a defensive formation that worked so well for Ravanelli's men at the Parc des Princes. ""We could be spending the match defending in the final 20 metres,"" warned Nantes coach Michel Der Zakarian. Marseille and Saint-Etienne are also sitting pretty on six points from two matches as they get set for away matches at Valenciennes and Lille on Saturday and Sunday respectively. Seven-time French champions Lyon lead Monaco by the paltry advantage of having scored one more goal but their season hit an oil slick in midweek as they were completely outclassed by Spanish side Real Sociedad 2-0 in the first leg of their Champions League qualifying tie at the Stade Gerland. Elimination next week in Spain would be nothing less than a disaster for a club set to lose in excess of 20 million euros and mean they miss the group stages of Europe's finest competition for the first time since the 1999-2000 season. Elsewhere, Bordeaux who won their last league title in 2008 under Blanc go in search of a first victory at home to a Bastia team hot on the heels of their maiden victory last weekend when 19-year-old Mauritanian striker Adama Ba scored on his debut just five minutes after coming on as a second half substitute.

159,22/08/2013,14:16,Football: Monaco out to pile pressure on PSG,High flying Monaco have already lived up to their pre-season credentials as title challengers and Claudio Ranieri's side could be three points clear by Friday night if they defeat Toulouse at their Louis II stadium.,"Sixty-million euro signing Radamel Falcao is off to an impressive start with two goals in two games since his move from Atletico Madrid. The Colombian celebrated the birth of his new daughter on the eve of his strike against Montpellier last Sunday which helped spark a 4-1 rout of the 2012 champions. Toulouse could only manage a 1-1 draw against French Cup winners Bordeaux for their only positive result in two openings and face an in-form Monaco side eager to build on their perfect start and keep the pressure on the chasing pack. Ranieri welcomes back Portuguese striker Joao Moutinho to his squad following injury but Frenchman Emmanuel Riviere is set to keep his place after scoring a league leading four goals in two matches. ""When a player is going well like that, you have to keep going with him,"" explained the 61-year-old Italian. Paris Saint-Germain have been the early disappointment in Ligue 1 and are still looking for their first win of the season since former France coach Laurent Blanc took over from Real Madrid-bound Carlo Ancelotti. It took a late equaliser from former Napoli striker Edinson Cavani to salvage a 1-1 home draw against Ajaccio who earned their first points of the season since Italian icon Fabrizio Ravanelli took over at the Corsican club. They travel to promoted Nantes in the final match of the weekend on Sunday desperate for a return on their massive investment which led them to their first French title last season since 1994 and a narrow defeat in the Champions League quarter-finals against Barcelona. The 'Canaries' are expected to employ a defensive formation that worked so well for Ravanelli's men at the Parc des Princes. ""We could be spending the match defending in the final 20 metres,"" warned Nantes coach Michel Der Zakarian. Marseille and Saint-Etienne are also sitting pretty on six points from two matches as they get set for away matches at Valenciennes and Lille on Saturday and Sunday respectively. Seven-time French champions Lyon lead Monaco by the paltry advantage of having scored one more goal but their season hit an oil slick in midweek as they were completely outclassed by Spanish side Real Sociedad 2-0 in the first leg of their Champions League qualifying tie at the Stade Gerland.

160,17/08/2013,22:15,Football: Marseille and Saint Etienne join Lyon at summit,Marseille and Saint-Etienne joined Lyon at the top of Ligue 1 with respective victories over Evian and Guingamp in France on Saturday.,"Lyon, who defeated Sochaux 3-1 on Friday, lead on goal difference with the trio of teams locked on maximum points after two outings. At the Velodrome, French international Andre-Pierre Gignac inspired Marseille to a 2-0 defeat of Evian with a brilliant opener on 16 minutes before the home side then made the points safe with 23 minutes left when Dimitri Payet pounced on a rebound for his third goal of the young season. ""The numbers speak for themselves,"" said delighted Marseille coach Elie Baup. ""We've got six points, scored five and conceded one so we've got our season off to a very good start."" Saint-Etienne, who picked up their first silverware last season since winning the league in 1981 title when they won the League Cup, continued where they left off with a deserved 1-0 win over promoted yet pointless Guingamp. The only goal of the match was a flowing move on 52 minutes that was superbly finished off by Fabian Lemoine after a one-two on the edge of the box. Bordeaux gave themselves a hard nights' work when defender Marc Planus was shown a straight red card after just 28 minutes for a shocking tackle on Israeli international Eden Ben Basat but managed to escape with a 1-1 draw at Toulouse. The visitors, who last won the title under current PSG coach Laurent Blanc in 2009, took the lead just before half-time when Malian international Cheick Diabate broke the offside trap and beat Toulouse keeper Ali Ahamada with a close range finish. The lead lasted just two minutes however as Toulouse equalised through Ben Basat who shook off an earlier disallowed goal and blasted home a loose ball after a mixup in the Bordeaux defence. Europa League hopefuls Nice bounced back from their 4-0 thrashing at Lyon last weekend with a 2-1 win over Rennes as they got off to a bright start with a 20th minute opener from Argentine Dario Cvitanic against Rennes. Rennes got the perfect tonic before half-time when Nelson Oliveira scored in the dying seconds of the opening 45 minutes before a defensive howler put Nice back in front. An unforgivable mistake from Nigerian Ejike Uzoenyi - who was last man back - handed the ball on a plate to Jeremy Pied who calmly slotted in past astonished Rennes 'keeper Benoit Costil for three priceless points. Bastia were also the benificiaries of poor defending as they notched up their first points of the season with a 2-0 win over Valenciennes thanks to a Gianni Bruno tap-in with 14 minutes left before a powerful header from Adama Ba three minutes later carried the Corsicans home.

162,16/08/2013,02:25,Football: Blanc hoping for Cavani impact as PSG make home bow,"Paris Saint-Germain play their first home game since Laurent Blanc replaced Carlo Ancelotti as coach of the Ligue 1 champions when they entertain Ajaccio at the Parc des Princes on Sunday evening, with memories of last season's struggles against the Corsicans still fresh.","The capital club were held to goalless draws in both meetings with Ajaccio in 2012-13, but those results did not prevent them from comfortably winning the Ligue 1 crown in May. Former France coach Blanc has been at the helm for six weeks now, and oversaw the Champions Trophy win against Bordeaux in his first competitive game at the helm before a 1-1 draw in Montpellier in last weekend's league opener. In both games, PSG have had to come from behind, with Brazilian full-back Maxwell earning them a draw at the Stade de la Mosson after they had trailed at the interval against opponents who pressed and harried tirelessly. With Corsican sides renowned for their aggression, and Ajaccio coach Fabrizio Ravanelli determined to make his team difficult to beat, PSG could face a frustrating evening on Sunday. However, Blanc will hope that 64 million-euro (US$85.4m, £54.6m) record signing Edinson Cavani can have an impact on his home debut after almost scoring as a substitute in Montpellier. ""Certainly,"" Blanc said when asked if the Uruguayan former Napoli striker, who started pre-season training late, will feature against Ajaccio. ""But the question is will he start. That is a decision we will take. He is a little bit behind with his preparation and has had some fitness problems."" Ajaccio lost 1-0 to Saint-Etienne last weekend, but Ravanelli will relish the occasion in the capital having already experienced the heat of the Parc des Princes during his days as a Marseille player. In November 1997, the Italian striker played a central part in a controversial victory at the ground for PSG's bitter rivals, diving to win a penalty that was converted by...Laurent Blanc. ""It is a great thing to return to Paris, especially as a coach. It is a real pleasure,"" said Ravanelli. ""We know we will be playing against an extraordinary team with extraordinary means. But even if we lose we will come out with our heads held high, because we know we can enjoy a good season."" Earlier on Sunday, Monaco, tipped as PSG's most likely title challengers, will look to build on their opening-day win at Bordeaux when they welcome Montpellier to the Stade Louis II. Claudio Ranieri's side. a mixture of expensive summer acquisitions and exciting young talent, won 2-0 in Bordeaux, with Radamel Falcao netting a debut goal after his 60 million-euro move from Atletico Madrid. And in midweek they won an appeal against a three-point deduction handed down as a punishment for a trouble at the end of a game last season, so confidence will be high at the principality club. Confidence is also high in Marseille after OM cruised to an opening-day win in Guingamp. They play host to Evian on Saturday, although recent signing Saber Khalifa is unlikely to make his debut against his former club in that encounter as he builds up his fitness. After thumping Nice 4-0 last weekend, Lyon travel to Sochaux on Friday, the match being brought forward to help Remi Garde's side prepare for next midweek's Champions League play-off, first leg against Real Sociedad. ""Sochaux are a team that like to play football and don't worry about their opponents. That's the club's culture,"" said Garde. ""We are expecting a tough game. We need to confirm our good form and try and cause them as many problems as possible."" In the pick of the other matches, Nice face Rennes at the Stade du Ray, although that match will be played behind closed doors as a punishment for fan misbehaviour last season.

163,09/08/2013,23:14,Football: PSG held on opening day in France,"Paris Saint Germain dropped points on the opening day of the French league season, held 1-1 Friday at Montpellier as they began their defence of the title.","PSG have moved swiftly on since landing their first league crown in 19 years in May, with Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti leaving for Real Madrid and loan star David Beckham retiring. But awash with cash from their Qatari owners the capital club, touting a budget of 400 million euros, are hot favourites to repeat their success, even if newly-promoted fellow moneybags outfit Monaco will look to push them hard. Falcao, a 60-million-euro acquisition from Atletico Madrid, is the big draw for the Monegasques, bankrolled by Russian billionaire owner Dimitri Rybolovlev. But the principality club must begin the season with a two-point deduction after a series of incidents at the end of a game last season. Montpellier represented a tough opening day test for the Parisians given the southerners' status as 2012 champions though they saw the architect of that win, Rene Girard, switch to Lille in the summer, with Jean Fernandez arriving to replace him. PSG, now under the stewardship of former France and Bordeaux coach Laurent Blanc, elected to start with a strike tandem of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ezequiel Lavezzi, leaving 64 million-euro new boy Edinson Cavani on the bench to begin with at the Stade de la Mosson. ""We expected a better result,"" admitted Blanc. ""But we created too little for my taste and made too many mistakes which allowed Montpellier to score."" Fernandez believed the game could have been wrapped up in the first 45 minutes. ""We could have won the game in the first half. If we had been a little more clear-headed, we could have created more chances. But then we suffered in the second half,"" he said. But after an early Lavezzi header flashed off target it was the hosts who scored the opening goal of the new season, a rasping drive from Remy Cabella after just ten minutes. Cabella robbed Ibrahimovic and then found Emanuel Herrera, who fired in an effort which was blocked only for Cabella to drive in at the second attempt. Though enjoying the lion's share of the possession PSG were forced to grind through the gears as they strove to respond and Ibrahimovic sent in a fizzing effort which Geoffrey Jourdren in the home goal tipped away. A goal to the good at the break, Montpellier could have doubled their lead on 50 minutes but Herrera fired over from the edge of the area. And PSG finally managed to get back on terms on the hour mark through Brazilian Maxwell. Javier Pastore fired over a cross form the left which Ibrahimovic just reached at the far post, nodding on for former Barcelona defender Maxwell to net from close range. Montpellier had a nervous final 18 minutes after their Moroccan defender Abdelhamid El Kaoutari was red carded for a foul on Pastore. Monaco open their campaign Saturday at Bordeaux, whom PSG's Blanc led to the title in 2009, while other weekend action sees Lyon host Nice and Lille welcome Lorient. Sunday sees Ajaccio take on former giants Saint Etienne with the former now being coached by former Italy striker Fabrizio Ravanelli.
