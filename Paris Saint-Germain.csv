0,13/02/2021,19:19,PSG warm up for Barcelona,Moise Kean struck the winning goal as a Paris Saint-Germain side missing the injured Neymar survived a scare to beat Nice 2-1 on Saturday and boost their Ligue 1 title hopes three days before facing Barcelona in the Champions League.,"Kean struck in the 76th minute for his 10th Ligue 1 goal since joining PSG on loan from Everton, handing Mauricio Pochettino's side the points after Julian Draxler's opener had been cancelled out by Rony Lopes at a freezing Parc des Princes. The result allowed the reigning champions to go provisionally top of the table on goal difference from Lille, who play Brest at home on Sunday. Lyon are two points back in third but can climb to the summit with a win at home to Montpellier later on Saturday. ""Today in the circumstances I think we need to be happy. We are in the position we need to be in,"" Pochettino told Canal Plus. ""I think we controlled the game and deserved the victory. We didn't play great but I think it was a very professional performance."" PSG are expected to be without Neymar for at least the next three weeks after the world's most expensive player came off with a groin injury in a midweek French Cup win at second-tier Caen, a huge blow ahead of the Champions League last 16, first leg in Barcelona on Tuesday. Angel di Maria will also be out for that game, and the Argentine watched the visit of Nice from the stands next to Marco Verratti, another key player on the injury list just now. PSG were knocked out of the Champions League in the last 16 in each of Neymar's first two seasons with the club, defeats against Real Madrid and Manchester United both coming after the Brazilian suffered an untimely injury. After reaching the final last season, the fear now is that another injury to their talisman could prove fatal to their hopes against Barcelona. ""We are missing some important players but we have a squad in whom we can trust,"" insisted Pochettino. ""It is always better when you have everyone available but of course we are going to try to win the game and there can be no excuses."" Pochettino handed starts to Kean and Mauro Icardi alongside Kylian Mbappe in attack against Nice, as PSG sported a pink and violet-coloured fourth kit with player names on the back in Mandarin to mark the Lunar New Year. The new look inspired the home side to go in front midway through the first half thanks to Draxler, who followed up to score after Icardi had turned Thilo Kehrer's cross onto the post, the German scoring on his first league start since October. However, a Nice side who have struggled badly for form this season drew level five minutes into the second half when Marquinhos attempted a pass out from the back but only succeeded in finding Lopes, who picked up the ball on the edge of the box and fired high into the net. Keylor Navas then turned Amine Gouiri's shot onto the bar with PSG on the ropes, but Pochettino's side grabbed the winner with just under quarter of an hour left. Mbappe's cross from the left to the back post was returned into the six-yard area by Icardi, and Kean headed in."
1,11/02/2021,18:01,UEFA to investigate referee racism allegations during PSG-Basaksehir match,UEFA announced on Thursday it is opening an investigation against match officials after alleged racism during December's Champions League encounter between Paris Saint-Germain and Istanbul Basaksehir.,"The meeting was stopped, and then finished a day later, after a touchline argument erupted over accusations the Romanian fourth official, Sebastian Coltescu, had described Basaksehir's Cameroonian assistant coach Pierre Webo as ""black"", or ""negru"" in Romanian. Coltescu and the other Romanian officials were replaced for the restart by a new refereeing team headed by the Netherlands' Danny Makkelie. The game took place 24 hours later with players taking a knee and wearing anti-racism T-shirts before PSG won 5-1. ""Following an investigation conducted by a UEFA Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector regarding the events that led to the 2020/21 UEFA Champions League match between Paris Saint-Germain and Istanbul Basaksehir FK on 8 December 2020 being abandoned, proceedings have been opened against Mr. Sebastian Constantin Coltescu and Mr. Octavian Sovre for a potential violation of Article 11 of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations,"" the European governing body said. ""Further information about this case will be made available once the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body has taken a decision in due course,"" it added. After the fixture UEFA promised a ""thorough investigation"" into the incident. The Turkish club's president Goksel Gumusdag called for Coltescu to be handed a life ban for the remarks."
2,11/02/2021,16:34,Injured Neymar out of PSG's Champions League clash with Barcelona: club,"Neymar will miss Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League last 16, first leg match against his former club Barcelona due to a groin injury, the French club said Thursday.","The Brazilian forward suffered the injury in PSG's 1-0 win against Caen in the French Cup on Wednesday, ruling him out of the game in Spain on February 16."
3,10/02/2021,23:47,Neymar walks off during PSG Cup win after being fouled,Neymar walked off the pitch without waiting to be substituted after being on the receiving end of a series of fouls during Paris Saint-Germain's 1-0 French Cup win at second-tier Caen on Wednesday.,"The Brazil attacker, captaining PSG with Marquinhos and Presnel Kimpembe absent, was fouled twice in the space of three minutes. He was visibly upset after the second foul, by Steeve Yago, exchanging words with the Caen player. As the game resumed, Neymar continued to complain before walking down the tunnel to the dressing room in the 57th minute. The world's most expensive player was replaced three minutes later by Kylian Mbappe. Neymar, although appearing to be moving quite comfortable, was grimacing while holding his thigh. Nevertheless, PSG will be worried, with their Champions League last-16 first leg against Barcelona at the Camp Nou on Tuesday. But coach Mauricio Pochettino defended his decision to name a strong starting XI which included Neymar despite the forward only featuring as a substitute against Marseille on Sunday due to a stomach problem. ""Every game is important. I believe that PSG must win every game,"" said the Argentinian, who took over from the sacked Thomas Tuchel last month. ""If we had lost, you would have criticised me for not having given importance to the French Cup. We make the decisions, we analyse, we try to find the best team."" The holders did enough to win despite finishing the game without their stand-in skipper, as Moise Kean's 49th-minute goal, assisted by Neymar, proved to be the winner. PSG were never in serious trouble as they moved into the last 32. Earlier on Wednesday, crisis-hit Marseille eased to a ""welcome"" first victory since suspending coach Andre Villas-Boas by beating second-tier Auxerre 2-0. Argentina striker Dario Benedetto, with his just his fifth goal in 29 games this season, and Ahmadou Dieng found the net for Marseille. ""Qualification is welcome in the period that we are going through, we are in a tough place,"" said stand-in coach Nasser Larguet. ""There was not a great quality of play, but on the other hand, there was great team spirit, lots of energy, we saw the boys put in maximum effort. ""And then the satisfaction of seeing Dario Benedetto score his goal, it had been a while. The players remained united until the end."" Marseille had blown a two-goal lead to draw with Lens and lost 2-0 to arch-rivals Paris Saint-Germain since Villas-Boas was suspended following comments made after a defeat by Monaco. The principality side also booked their spot in the last 32, as Stevan Jovetic scored in a 1-0 win at Grenoble. Ligue 1 leaders Lille reached the next round as 19-year-old Guinean midfielder Aguibou Camara's early goal secured a 1-0 victory over Dijon. Lille, who have not even reached the Cup semi-finals since winning the double in 2010-11, sit two points clear of Lyon at the summit of the top-flight table. News of the sacking of Nantes coach Raymond Domenech emerged during the Canaries' 4-2 loss to Lens, with the former France boss missing the game after a positive Covid-19 test."
4,09/02/2021,15:40,PSG lose Di Maria for Barca Champions League tie,"Argentinian forward Angel Di Maria will miss the first leg of Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League last 16 match at Barcelona, coach Mauricio Pochettino said on Tuesday.","Di Maria suffered a thigh injury during the 2-0 Ligue 1 win against Marseille on Sunday and ""he will not be at the Camp Nou"" for the game on February 16, Pochettino said. ""Angel is an important player for us but we have a big squad with players who can win matches for us,"" the coach added. Di Maria, the 32-year-old former Manchester United winger, has been ever-present in the PSG lineup since Pochettino joined the club in December, lining up alongside Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Mauro Icardi in a high-powered attack. Despite the bad news about Di Maria, last year's Champions League finalists hope to be able to select first-choice goalkeeper Keylor Navas, who is expected to return from a groin injury to resume training later this week."
5,08/02/2021,14:20,"Bayern fume, Mbappe flies, Zlatan's milestone: European talking points","Bayern Munich's preparation for the Club World Cup was disrupted despite victory, Kylian Mbappe rediscovered his supersonic speed and Lionel Messi starred from the bench, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic notched his 500th club goal at the weekend.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Bayern Munich's weekend started well, Kingsley Coman's deflected strike securing a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin on Friday as they maintained a seven-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga from RB Leipzig. They then boarded a plane for Qatar in preparation for a night flight to the Club World Cup, but the necessary de-icing of the aircraft meant they were refused permission for take-off due to a ban on flights between midnight and 7:00 am. That meant a departure seven hours later than planned, ruining plans to train on Saturday and hampering preparations for Monday's semi-final against Al Ahly. ""Those in charge (at the airport) don't have an inkling of what they've done to our team,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. ""Of course it was not optimal,"" said Joshua Kimmich. ""Nonetheless I think that we will be able to win the match."" It was what made Kylian Mbappe so breathtaking when he first broke through but it was something that had not been seen so often this season. On Sunday the France star produced a stunning sprint to finish off a counter-attack and score Paris Saint-Germain's opener in a 2-0 win at Marseille. Mbappe's run was clocked at an incredible 36 kilometres per hour, but he managed to slow down enough to control Angel di Maria's pass and score his 16th Ligue 1 goal this season, as PSG stayed third, three points behind leaders Lille. ""The feeling is coming back because I am playing every game now,"" said Mbappe, who was often on the bench in Thomas Tuchel's final matches in charge but has hardly missed a minute under new coach Mauricio Pochettino. ""I am finishing games stronger. I am not so burnt out. It can only be a good thing."" PSG's Champions League last 16, first leg in Barcelona is just eight days away. The last time Lionel Messi came off the bench in La Liga, he was introduced at half-time and scored twice in a 5-2 win over Betis. On Sunday he again came on as a substitute against Betis, this time in the 57th minute. Moments later he scored Barcelona's equaliser, and he then played a key part in their second before fellow substitute Francisco Trincao's late strike secured a 3-2 win. Messi was rested at the start along with Frenkie de Jong and Pedri, with coach Ronald Koeman appearing to prioritise Wednesday's Copa del Rey semi-final, first leg at Sevilla, and with the PSG Champions League tie approaching too. Barca, like Real Madrid, are seven points behind La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid, who have two games in hand and play on Monday against Celta Vigo. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's brace was key in setting AC Milan on the way to a 4-0 win over Crotone that kept them two points clear of Inter atop Serie A, but it also saw the former Sweden striker reach a remarkable milestone. The goals were his 500th and 501st at club level since starting out with Malmo in 1999. Now 39, he is in his second spell with Milan and his hoping to win a second Scudetto with the Rossoneri, after starring in their 2011 title triumph. Ibrahimovic scored 14 goals that season and already has 14 this season, in just 11 appearances. Mesut Ozil made his second substitute appearance in five days for new club Fenerbahce but could not help turn Istanbul's Intercontinental derby, as Galatasaray headed back to the European side of the Bosphorus with a 1-0 win. Ozil had helped set up a goal in Fenerbahce's 2-1 win at Hatayspor last Wednesday. Against Galatasaray, the ex-Arsenal man came on for the last 27 minutes with Fenerbahce already trailing. It is shaping up to be quite a title run-in in Turkey, with Galatasaray, Besiktas and Fenerbahce all level on 48 points at the top."
6,07/02/2021,23:52,"Mbappe sparks PSG win over Marseille, but Lille top in France","Kylian Mbappe set Paris Saint-Germain on the way to a 2-0 win over troubled Marseille on Sunday, keeping the reigning champions within three points of Ligue 1 leaders Lille who earlier recorded their sixth consecutive victory.","Mbappe burst through at incredible pace to give PSG the lead on the counter-attack in the ninth minute at the Velodrome, with Mauro Icardi adding a second for Mauricio Pochettino's side. The victory was achieved despite Neymar -- who celebrated his 29th birthday on Friday -- only appearing as a substitute having missed training with a stomach bug. PSG stay third, a point behind Lyon and three adrift of Lille, who won 2-0 at Nantes. Marseille finished with 10 men after Dimitri Payet's late sending-off, and are down in ninth having won just once in 11 games. The Parisians go to Barcelona in the Champions League on February 16 but Mbappe insisted their thoughts remained on domestic matters as they first play in the French Cup in midweek and then host Nice next weekend. ""In previous years we might have been able to concentrate more on the Champions League but this year we really need to stay focused on the league because we are trailing,"" the World Cup winner told broadcaster Canal Plus. ""But maybe that's not a bad thing because we are forced to play with intensity in every game and that can mean that you're not taken by surprise when it comes to the Champions League."" 'Le Classique' is the biggest fixture in French football, and the build-up to the 100th meeting of Marseille and PSG had been dominated by recent events in the Mediterranean city. Marseille's game last weekend against Rennes was postponed after several hundred supporters attacked the club's training ground, and three days later coach Andre Villas-Boas was suspended by the club after declaring at a press conference he wanted to resign. Nasser Larguet, the head of Marseille's youth academy, took charge for Wednesday's draw at Lens and was again on the bench against PSG. The last league meeting of the teams in September was won 1-0 by Marseille, but was marred by five late red cards, including for Neymar. The Brazilian later accused Marseille defender Alvaro Gonzalez of racism, although no action was taken due to a lack of evidence. Ligue 1 top scorer Mbappe sprinted onto Angel di Maria's pass to control and fire past Steve Mandanda for the opener, his 16th of the season. Canal Plus clocked Mbappe's stunning sprint at 36 kilometres per hour. Di Maria then hobbled off injured, before Icardi made it 2-0 midway through the first half. Icardi got in front of Alvaro to meet Alessandro Florenzi's cross, the ball coming off the back of his neck and looping into the net. Icardi was replaced by Neymar midway through the second half, with the Brazilian immediately becoming involved in a flashpoint with Alvaro. The Spaniard was lucky only to concede a corner rather than a penalty as he tried to stop the world's most expensive player, but Alvaro did jar his knee in the process and came off soon after. The home side then had Payet dismissed for a high boot on Marco Verratti. Canada's Jonathan David continued his recent scoring streak with a brace as Lille saw off Nantes to reclaim top spot from Lyon, who beat Strasbourg 3-0 on Saturday. David has five goals in as many games after pouncing on a defensive mix-up to put Lille in front early on and then scoring a fantastic second seven minutes from time following a one-two with Renato Sanches. ""We are on a magnificent run but nobody is pulling away because everyone is winning,"" said Lille coach Christophe Galtier. Struggling Nantes have gone 15 matches without a win, including seven games under Raymond Domenech, the former France coach who was appointed in December. Earlier Aleksandr Golovin scored a hat-trick on his first start since August after injury as fourth-placed Monaco defeated bottom club Nimes 4-3 to extend their winning run to seven matches. Golovin also set up Kevin Volland for Monaco's fourth."
7,06/02/2021,16:32,PSG's Pochettino 'hopeful' over stomach-bug victim Neymar for Marseille,Paris Saint-Germain coach Mauricio Pochettino said on Saturday he is optimistic Neymar will feature in the weekend's trip to arch-rivals Marseille despite the Brazil attacker suffering from a stomach bug,"PSG head to the Velodrome on Sunday for the 100th meeting between the outfits and three points off leaders Lille, who travel to Nantes earlier on. ""Neymar's suffering from gastroenteritis, like a lot of people can suffer from. We will assess his state tomorrow, and we hope he will recover enough to be in the squad,"" Pochettino told a press conference. While the world's most expensive player could still make it PSG will definitely be missing goalkeeper Keylor Navas who has an adductor issue and Thimothee Pembele who has contracted Covid-19. Italy midfielder Marco Verratti has recovered from the virus but Spain playmaker Ander Herrera remains sidelined for the tie against a side in turmoil. Marseille are without a win in a month, supporters invaded the training complex and coach Andre Villas-Boas resigned in midweek."

""Neymar JR is unable to train this morning due to gastroenteritis, he will be evaluated in the coming hours,"" the Ligue 1 champions said in a statement. PSG are also without goalkeeper Keylor Navas who has an adductor issue while Thimothee Pembele has contracted Covid-19. Italy midfielder Marco Verratti has recovered from the virus but Spain playmaker Ander Herrera remains sidelined for the tie against a side in turmoil. Marseille are without a win in a month, supporters invaded the training complex and coach Andre Villas-Boas resigned in midweek."
9,02/02/2021,13:39,Supporters groups dismiss 'dangerous' European Super League plan,"Plans to create a breakaway European Super League for an elite group of the continent's wealthiest clubs have been dismissed as ""unpopular, illegitimate, and dangerous"" by a collective of supporters groups.","""It would destroy the European model of sport, which is based on commonly accepted principles such as sporting merit, promotion and relegation, qualification to European competitions via domestic success, and financial solidarity,"" said a statement released on the initiative of Football Supporters Europe (FSE) and signed by more than 100 groups of supporters of club sides and national teams. ""It would also undermine the economic foundations of European football, concentrating even more wealth and power in the hands of a dozen or so elite clubs,"" the statement added. Among the signatories were Liverpool's Spirit of Shankly Supporters' Union as well as groups from Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid. Documents containing details of the Super League, first reported last month by British newspaper The Times, proposed a 20-club tournament with 15 permanent members, including the English Premier League's 'Big Six', three each from Spain and Italy, two from Germany and one from France. Five other clubs would qualify annually, the report said, but founding members would receive up to 350 million euros ($425m) each just to join the competition. At the same time discussions are still ongoing about the future format of the UEFA Champions League, currently the world's most lucrative and prestigious club competition which is due for reform of some kind from 2024 onwards. ""We recognise that the game is in desperate need of broad reform. ""But proposals to this end must seek to revive the competitive balance in European competitions, protect domestic leagues, promote the interests of fans, and encourage fairer revenue distribution,"" the statement added. ""A European Super League would achieve none of these objectives -- quite the opposite."" Javier Tebas, the president of Spain's La Liga, is one of the leading voices against the project, which he insisted is ""not going to happen"" in an interview with AFP at the weekend. ""The whole system will be against it and it won't just sit on its hands. It's going to fight,"" said Tebas, who also accused FIFA chief Gianni Infantino of supporting the plan, which he says has been driven by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, as well as the American owners of Liverpool, Manchester United and AC Milan."
10,01/02/2021,14:47,"Messi fuels Barcelona revival, Marseille violence, Poch beaten: Talking points from around Europe","Lionel Messi kept up his improved form in La Liga as Barcelona won again amid more controversy about the Catalans' finances, while there was drama on and off the field in France and the Milan clubs continue to fight it out at the top of Serie A.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Barcelona have said they will take legal action against Spanish newspaper El Mundo after it published details at the weekend of Lionel Messi's current contract, which it says is worth up to 555 million euros ($674 million) over four years. El Mundo called it the ""colossal contract that ruins Barcelona"", just as the Catalans are wrestling with a dire financial situation, worsened by the pandemic, and with Messi's future currently up in the air. Yet the Argentine underlined his value to Barca by scoring a superb free-kick in their 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao. Barca are unbeaten in 10 n La Liga, winning eight, with Messi scoring eight times in that run. However, both Barcelona and Real Madrid are 10 points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, who beat Cadiz 4-2 and still boast a game in hand. Marseille's weekend game against Rennes in Ligue 1 was postponed after angry supporters attacked the club's training ground, while the players were there, in what was called ""a frenzy of unjustifiable violence"". Local police said 25 arrests were made and seven officers were injured after several hundred Ultras stormed La Commanderie in a protest against the club leadership and the team's poor recent run of results. Marseille's owner, the American tycoon Frank McCourt, called the protestors ""thugs"" and likened the incidents to last month's storming of the US Congress. The growing crisis comes with the former Champions League winners having slumped to ninth in Ligue 1 and after coach Andre Villas-Boas indicated he will leave at the end of the season. On the pitch in France, the title race is hotting up after reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain suffered their first defeat under new coach Mauricio Pochettino, conceding at the death to lose 3-2 at struggling Lorient despite Neymar scoring two penalties. It was a fifth defeat in Ligue 1 this season for PSG, who are third, three points behind leaders Lille. Lille beat Dijon 1-0, while Lyon are two points off top spot in second after scoring late to beat Bordeaux 2-1. It could even become a four-way fight. Monaco are six points off the lead after winning their last five games. Bayern Munich maintained their seven-point lead at the top of the German Bundesliga by beating Hoffenheim 4-1 as Robert Lewandowski scored his 24th goal of the league campaign. After a mini slump, the Bavarians have now four on the bounce and remain well clear of nearest rivals RB Leipzig. The result against Hoffenheim also allowed Hansi Flick's side to exact perfect revenge for their 4-1 defeat away to the same opponents in September, in what was their only loss in 46 matches in all competitions across a remarkable 2020. The only cloud on Bayern's weekend came as midfielder Corentin Tolisso was dropped and fined for getting a tattoo, therefore falling foul of Covid-19 quarantine regulations. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's spat with Romelu Lukaku dominated the headlines last midweek as Inter beat AC Milan in their Coppa Italia derby. On Saturday Ibrahimovic missed a penalty for the fourth time this season but Ante Rebic followed up to score and Franck Kessie later netted another spot-kick as Milan won 2-1 at Bologna. That result kept the Rossoneri two points clear of Inter at the top of Serie A, as Antonio Conte's side beat Benevento 4-0 with Lukaku scoring a brace at San Siro. The Belgian is on 14 league goals for the season and Inter remain best-placed to overhaul Milan, even if Roma, Juventus, Lazio and Napoli all also won at the weekend."
11,31/01/2021,20:21,Neymar says he wants to stay at PSG,Neymar said on Sunday that he hopes to stay at Paris Saint-Germain beyond this season and wants Kylian Mbappe to also commit his future to the French champions.,"Brazilian star Neymar is in discussions with PSG over a possible new contract, as his current deal is set to end in June 2022. ""I am very happy at the moment, things have changed a lot,"" the 28-year-old told French television channel TF1. ""I can't really say why. I feel good, I have adapted, I'm calmer. I'm very happy here. I want to stay at PSG."" Neymar, who PSG made the world's most expensive player with a 222-million-euro ($269 million) transfer from Barcelona in 2017, scored twice in Sunday's surprise 3-2 loss at Lorient, the club's first defeat under new coach Mauricio Pochettino. He wants Mbappe -- who has been repeatedly linked with a possible move to Real Madrid and said he wanted time to ""think"" earlier this month -- to sign a new deal. ""I hope Kylian will want to stay too,"" Neymar added. ""Of course, that's the wish of all the supporters. ""We want Paris to remain a great team and I want to keep doing what I've always done -- playing football and being happy, they're the most important things."" Mbappe has scored 16 goals in all competitions this season for PSG, with Neymar netting 13 times despite having a long spell out of the team with injury. ""We have a relationship like brothers,"" Neymar said of the 22-year-old Mbappe. ""I'm the older one. We like to play together a lot. I love to bring the best out of him. ""He's a golden boy, I call him 'Golden Boy' because he really is golden. He has a huge heart, even off the pitch he is incredible."" Sunday's defeat saw PSG slip to the unusually low position of third in Ligue 1, three points behind leaders Lille."
12,31/01/2021,17:10,PSG suffer first defeat under Pochettino,Paris Saint-Germain suffered their first defeat under Mauricio Pochettino as lowly Lorient fought back to claim a dramatic 3-2 victory on Sunday and prevent the defending champions from retaking top spot in Ligue 1.,"Neymar scored two penalties but the visitors collapsed late on at the Stade du Moustoir, as Nigerian Terem Moffi netted an injury-time winner. The loss saw PSG stay one point behind league leaders Lyon, although third-placed Lille could go two points clear when they host Dijon later on Sunday. ""We have to keep the positive aspects and move forward,"" said former Tottenham manager Pochettino. ""Accidents happen in football. We have to keep working. It makes us realise that it can happen if we don't play at 100 percent."" It was the first defeat in six games as PSG coach for Pochettino since he took over from the sacked Thomas Tuchel. The win takes struggling Lorient into the relegation play-off spot. ""(Moffi's goal) was magical. Against PSG, it's even crazier,"" said Lorient's Laurent Abergel, who scored the opening goal. ""For a Marseille fan like me, the first dream is perhaps to play for OM and the second to beat PSG."" Lorient started brightly and had the first real shot in anger in the 30th minute, as Adrian Grbic's long-range strike had to be pushed away by PSG goalkeeper Sergio Rico. The hosts did take the lead six minutes later, though, as PSG failed several times to clear and Abergel picked out the top corner with the outside of his left boot. Neymar levelled on the stroke of half-time from the penalty spot with his fifth league goal of the season. PSG improved after the break and took the lead in the 57th minute as Houboulang Mendes, who also conceded the first penalty, brought down Mauro Icardi and Neymar again made no mistake. It was the first time since Zlatan Ibrahimovic in 2015 that a PSG player had netted two spot-kicks in a Ligue 1 match. The visitors pressed for a third, but Lorient goalkeeper Matthieu Dreyer made an excellent stop to keep out an Icardi header. That proved to be crucial, as the stubborn home side equalised in the 80th minute. Substitute Yoane Wissa scored an excellent individual goal, his sixth of his first full campaign as a top-flight player. PSG went in search of a winner, but the closest they came saw full-back Layvin Kurzawa's drive fly narrowly wide. They over-committed in the second minute of added time, leaving no defenders within 60 yards of their own goal as Moffi was sent racing clean through. The 21-year-old, on as a sub, slotted the ball into the bottom corner to spark wild celebrations for the home team."
13,25/01/2021,14:00,"Atletico, Bayern surge clear but game on in France: European talking points","It was a very good weekend for Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich as they extended their leads at the top in Spain and Germany respectively, but it remains tight at the top in France and Italy while Portugal's sleeping giants claimed silverware.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Atletico Madrid are towering over their rivals atop La Liga after beating Valencia 3-1 on Sunday, inspired by goals from Joao Felix and Luis Suarez. Diego Simeone's side had to come from behind to get the points, three days after Suarez's late penalty secured a 2-1 win at Eibar. Real Madrid won 4-1 at Alaves and Barcelona were 2-0 winners at Elche but this is Atletico's title to lose now, even if the season is barely at its midway point. They are seven points clear of Real in second, and 10 above Barcelona in third, with a game in hand on each. ""The best way to live in this moment is to take it one game at a time,"" said Simeone, repeating the mantra that worked wonders in Atletico's last title-winning campaign in 2013/14. The Bundesliga is arguably the most exciting league in Europe just now and yet any hopes of a lasting title race are fading after Bayern Munich went seven points clear, making the most of slip-ups by their challengers. Hansi Flick's side have bounced back from a recent blip and their 4-0 crushing of bottom team Schalke was their third win in eight days. It came after second-placed RB Leipzig lost 3-2 at struggling Mainz, leaving them with just one win in four. Meanwhile third-placed Bayer Leverkusen, superb in beating Borussia Dortmund in midweek, lost at home to Wolfsburg. Dortmund have slipped to seventh after losing 4-2 at Borussia Moenchengladbach, a result which underlined why they are apparently so keen to make Gladbach's Marco Rose the long-term replacement to the sacked Lucien Favre. AC Milan's resurgence has been remarkable and they are top at the halfway point in Serie A, meaning they earn the symbolic crown of winter champions. However, they slumped to a 3-0 home loss against Atalanta at San Siro, a second defeat in four following a run of 27 league games unbeaten. That suggests they may struggle to hold onto top spot in the run-in, and they only remain two points clear after Inter were held 0-0 at Udinese. ""Being winter champions means nothing to me,"" said Milan star Zlatan Ibrahimovic. ""Now the difficult phase begins."" While reigning champions Juventus beat Bologna, maybe irrepressible Atalanta are the ones to really look out for. The Bergamo side are, like Juve, seven points off the lead, but they are 10 games unbeaten, a run which has seen them score 26 goals while beating Milan and Roma, and drawing in Turin. Paris Saint-Germain are finding their form under new coach Mauricio Pochettino if Friday's 4-0 thumping of 10-man Montpellier was anything to go by. With Kylian Mbappe scoring twice and Neymar on target on his 100th appearance, they showed they will take some stopping. However, the good news is there is a proper title race in France, with Lille grinding out a superb 1-0 win at Rennes thanks to Canada striker Jonathan David and Lyon winning a one-sided derby 5-0 against a Saint-Etienne team decimated by a coronavirus outbreak. PSG and Lille are level on points, with Lyon two points behind in third. And perhaps even Monaco could get involved yet. They beat Marseille 3-1 and are six points off top spot in fourth, having scored 14 goals in winning their last four games. Sporting Lisbon claimed silverware by beating Braga 1-0 in the Portuguese League Cup final thanks to a goal from young Spanish defender Pedro Porro, who is on loan from Manchester City. It is the third time Sporting have won the trophy in four seasons but this time they will hope it is simply a precursor to the big one: not since 2002 have they won the league but this season, with talented young coach Ruben Amorim, they are unbeaten after 14 games and are four points ahead of Benfica and Porto."
14,23/01/2021,00:14,Neymar on target on 100th PSG appearance,Neymar made his 100th appearance for Paris Saint-Germain on Friday and marked the occasion with a goal in a 4-0 rout of 10-man Montpellier that took Mauricio Pochettino's side clear at the top of Ligue 1.,"Kylian Mbappe scored twice and Mauro Icardi was also on target with PSG leading 1-0 before netting three times in the space of four minutes around the hour mark. The game, played behind closed doors at the Parc des Princes, was conditioned by the early sending-off of Montpellier goalkeeper Jonas Omlin for a foul on Mbappe, as PSG made the most of their extra man. It was their fourth straight win since drawing at Saint-Etienne in Pochettino's first match in charge after the Argentine was appointed as coach on January 2. The former Tottenham Hotspur boss was back on the Paris bench having spent a week self-isolating following a positive Covid-19 test that forced him to miss his new team's 1-0 win at Angers last weekend. ""I feel good. I am happy to be back,"" he said. PSG are now three points clear of second-placed Lille, who go to in-form Rennes on Sunday. Lyon in third are five points behind the leaders before visiting derby rivals Saint-Etienne, who will be without seven players because of a coronavirus outbreak. The capital club's rivals may have their work cut out trying to overtake the reigning champions on this evidence, with the attacking quartet of Neymar, Mbappe, Icardi and Angel Di Maria running riot. Neymar's goal took his tally to 81 in 100 appearances for PSG since his world-record 222 million-euro ($264m) move from Barcelona in August 2017. His time in Paris has been marred by injuries at important moments but there can be no disputing his impressive record in front of goal as he prepares to face his old club in the last 16 of the Champions League next month. Mbappe was more prominent in this game, however, as he scored his first goals of the Pochettino era. Pochettino said: ""I was already happy with Mbappe's performances before tonight. I am pleased that he scored because scoring goals is crucial for a striker's confidence. But we knew it was only a matter of time."" The France World Cup-winning star was scythed down just outside the box by Omlin in the 16th minute, with the Swiss goalkeeper initially shown a yellow card before the punishment was upgraded to red following a VAR review. PSG made the extra man count as Di Maria played in Mbappe to open the scoring with a dinked finish over substitute goalkeeper Dimitry Bertaud in the 34th minute. Pochettino lost goalkeeper Keylor Navas to injury at half-time, while captain Marquinhos was also forced off early in the second half. The coach later said he thought it was ""nothing serious"" for either player. Mbappe cut the ball back for Neymar to make it 2-0 on the hour mark, before Icardi tucked in his third goal in four games. It was 4-0 in the 63rd minute when Icardi set up Ligue 1's leading scorer Mbappe to finish for his second of the night and 14th of the season. Layvin Kurzawa almost provided the cherry on top of the cake soon after, but his stunning overhead kick was tipped onto the crossbar by Bertaud."
15,23/01/2021,00:04,Mbappe admits mind not made up on PSG future,"Kylian Mbappe says he is still ""thinking about"" whether to agree to a new contract at Paris Saint-Germain, with the France superstar's existing deal set to expire at the end of next season.","""We are in discussions with the club to try to find a suitable project. I said I was thinking about it because I think that...if I sign it would have to be a long-term commitment to Paris Saint-Germain,"" Mbappe told TV channel Telefoot after Friday's 4-0 win over Montpellier in Ligue 1. ""I am very happy here. I have always been very happy. The supporters and the club have always helped me and for that alone I will always be grateful. ""But I want to think about what I want to do in the coming years, where I want to be. That's what I am reflecting on."" Mbappe, who turned 22 in December, joined PSG from Monaco in a blockbuster 180 million-euro ($219m) transfer in 2017. He chose to join his hometown team rather than Real Madrid but the Spanish giants have continued to court him ever since. Last month PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi said he was ""very confident"" Mbappe and Neymar -- who is also out of contract in 2022 -- would sign new terms. ""I will need to make a decision soon but I am thinking about it,"" Mbappe added after scoring twice in the win over Montpellier. ""If I had the answer today I would say so. This is not about buying time. For example, I don't want to sign a contract and then leave a year later. If I sign it would be to stay here."""
16,20/01/2021,14:21,PSG's Pochettino guarded over Messi move,Paris Saint-Germain coach Mauricio Pochettino played his cards close to his chest when tackled on Spanish radio over a potential move for Lionel Messi.,"Pochettino's fellow Argentine is out of contract with Barcelona at the end of the season, prompting speculation of being reunited with former Barca teammate Neymar at PSG. ""Everyone dreams of having the best players with him,"" Pochettino told Cadena Ser late on Tuesday. ""I have huge respect for the players I have in my team but I must also have respect for players in other teams,"" the former Tottenham boss, who replaced Thomas Tuchel at the Parc des Princes at the start of this month, added. Despite playing coy Pochettino highlighted the ""very strong"" bonds that existed between the two of them, ""like love for Newell Old Boys"", one of the clubs in Rosario in their homeland. ""Both of us have come from there, I think it's something that strongly unites us, this passion for the red and black (Newell's club colours)."" Pochettino's comments followed those of PSG sporting director Leonardo, who told France Football that ""the top players like Messi will always be on PSG's radar. ""But obviously now is not the time to talk nor to dream about that. ""Yet we are at the top table of those who are following the case closely."" Pochettino played down reports in Spain linking France World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe with a move to Real Madrid. ""I've no doubt about the fact that Kylian loves being in Paris,"" he said."
17,18/01/2021,13:46,"Messi sees red, 'fearful' Juventus, PSG back top: Talking points from around Europe","Frustration got the better of Lionel Messi as he saw red in the Spanish Super Cup final, while Inter dealt a major blow to Juventus's Serie A title hopes but Paris Saint-Germain are back on top in France.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Lionel Messi was sent off for the first time in 753 appearances for Barcelona at the end of his side's 3-2 extra-time defeat by Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Super Cup final in Seville, after lashing out at Asier Villalibre in a moment that seemed to encapsulate his recent frustration with his boyhood club. Messi had twice been shown a red card playing for Argentina, including at the 2019 Copa America, but never in more than 16 years with Barcelona, before Sunday. His dismissal came right at the end of extra time, after Athletic had scored a late equaliser to force the additional 30 minutes and then a stunning Inaki Williams strike gave the Basques a 3-2 win and their second Super Cup in six years. Barcelona had hoped to win their first trophy under Ronald Koeman and Messi had been in good form, with four goals in his club's previous two league games. ""Do I excuse him? I'd need to see it again,"" said Koeman of the incident. Andrea Pirlo's hopes of leading Juventus to a 10th straight Serie A title in his first season as a coach took a major knock as the reigning champions lost 2-0 away to Inter, one of the clubs he represented as a player. Arturo Vidal -- a former teammate of Pirlo's at Juve -- and Nicolo Barella scored the goals as Inter, coached by ex-Juventus boss Antonio Conte, moved level on points with leaders AC Milan, who have a game in hand to play on Monday. Juve, who had been on their best run of the season with three straight league wins, are now seven points off top spot. ""We couldn't have put in a worse performance than this,"" said Pirlo, who said his side were ""fearful"" and too defensive. They now play Napoli in the delayed Italian Super Cup on Wednesday. Paris Saint-Germain were without their new coach Mauricio Pochettino for their game at Angers after the Argentine tested positive for Covid-19. But, three days after winning his first trophy in management in the Champions Trophy against Marseille, he watched from afar as PSG ground out a 1-0 win that took them back to the top of Ligue 1. Layvin Kurzawa's goal made the difference, before former leaders Lyon saw their 16-game unbeaten run ended in dramatic fashion in a 1-0 home defeat against Metz. They were denied a late opener by a marginal offside call, and conceded in the 90th minute to Aaron Leya Iseka. Lyon are now third, two points off PSG who lead from Lille on goal difference. Lille beat Reims 2-1 with a last-minute Jonathan David winner. Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick was facing up to his first mini-crisis in charge as his side lost 3-2 at Borussia Moenchengladbach last weekend and then went out of the German Cup on penalties to second-tier Holstein Kiel. However they got back on track as Thomas Mueller's strike secured a 2-1 win over Freiburg on Sunday to move Bayern four points clear at the top of the Bundesliga from RB Leipzig, who drew 2-2 at Wolfsburg. With Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund slipping up as well, it seems doubtful that any of their rivals have the consistency needed to stop Bayern winning a ninth straight title, although there is still a long way to go. Benfica and Porto are Portugal's two most successful clubs and between them have won each of the last 18 league titles. On Friday they played out a 1-1 draw at the Estadio do Dragao, with Moussa Marega cancelling out Alex Grimaldo's opener before the Iranian Mehdi Taremi was sent off for Porto. It was a result that left the two teams level on 32 points from 14 games, and perhaps the big winners were Sporting. Looking for their first title since 2002, they stay four points clear and unbeaten, although they were held 1-1 at home by mid-table Rio Ave. Sporting are due to face Benfica later this month."
18,16/01/2021,23:19,PSG beat Angers to go top of Ligue 1 without Pochettino,A rare Layvin Kurzawa goal was enough for Paris Saint-Germain to beat Angers 1-0 on Saturday and go top of Ligue 1 despite coach Mauricio Pochettino testing positive for Covid-19 before the game.,"Kurzawa scored with 20 minutes left at the Stade Raymond Kopa to send PSG provisionally two points clear of Lyon, who will have the chance to reclaim first place when they host Metz on Sunday. Assistants Jesus Perez and Miguel D'Agostino took charge of the PSG side with Pochettino having to self-isolate after the announcement on Friday that he had contracted the virus. The Argentine's positive test followed those of three Paris players -- Brazilian Rafinha, Germany's Thilo Kehrer and French Under-21 international Colin Dagba -- in the last week. However, Neymar made his return to the starting line-up in Angers for the first time since suffering an ankle injury in a defeat to Lyon a month ago. With Kylian Mbappe and Angel di Maria also starting behind Moise Kean in attack, it was a strong Parisian line-up but they appeared to play within themselves against an Angers side who sit seventh. The home team even almost went ahead early in the second half when a Lois Diony diving header from close range was well saved by Keylor Navas. Stephane Bahoken also saw an attempt deflected over before PSG broke through in the 70th minute. Alessandro Florenzi's cross from the right was inadvertently helped on by Angers defender Romain Thomas for Kurzawa, arriving from left-back, to score his first goal in almost a year with a first-time cushioned volley at the back post. It was a third win in four games for PSG since former Tottenham Hotspur coach Pochettino was appointed two weeks ago. He won his maiden trophy in midweek when the reigning Ligue 1 champions beat Marseille 2-1 to claim the Champions Trophy, the French equivalent of a Super Cup. Before Lyon play on Sunday night, third-placed Lille can also go level on points again with PSG if they beat Reims. Meaanwhile Marseille's hopes of staying in the title race were dealt another blow earlier on Saturday as Florian Thauvin missed a penalty in a shock 2-1 home defeat by struggling Nimes. France World Cup winner Thauvin sent a woeful spot-kick wide in the first half and Swedish winger Niclas Eliasson then converted twice from close range after the break to give the away side an unassailable lead behind closed doors at the Velodrome. Argentine forward Dario Benedetto pulled one back late on for Andre Villas-Boas's side but this result left them with just one win in six Ligue 1 games. Marseille are sixth in the league, now 10 points behind leaders PSG, albeit still with two games in hand. ""We risk losing touch with the teams at the top, who are more consistent than us,"" said Villas-Boas. ""We were very bad and we paid an expensive price for it. We can't go from playing well against Paris to a miserable match like today."" Nimes move off the foot of the table after their first win in nine, but they remain in the bottom three. The two sides below them, Lorient and Dijon, had their clash set for Sunday postponed after a Covid-19 outbreak at the Brittany club."

""My thoughts are with (former coach) Thomas Tuchel and his staff, who allowed us to play this match,"" Pochettino said, with a nod to the man who guided PSG to a clean sweep of domestic honours in France last season but was sacked in late December. ""It is difficult to describe with words, especially as this is a club that helped me become a better person and better player."" PSG have claimed back-to-back wins under the Argentine after drawing at Saint-Etienne in his first game at the helm. The return of Neymar as a substitute after a month out was significant, as the world's most expensive player came off the bench to score a crucial late penalty against Marseille. ""We want to put our ideas in place and we are progressing in every area,"" said Pochettino, who has done away with Tuchel's tinkering with a three-man central defence and notably moved Marco Verratti into a more advanced role behind the striker. They are minor changes and it remains to be seen how PSG shape up by the time their Champions League last 16, first leg against Barcelona comes around in mid-February. In the meantime Neymar could now start on Saturday in Angers as PSG look to pile the pressure on Lyon, who are a point better off than both the capital side and Lille in third. With Lyon not playing Metz until Sunday, a win for Paris will take them back to top of the table, at least for one night. Icardi had played five minutes in three months before coming off the bench to score for PSG as they beat Brest 3-0 last weekend. That earned him a start in midweek against Marseille, when he scored the opener, crashed a shot off the bar and then won the decisive late penalty converted by Neymar. The Argentine looked overweight and sluggish for much of 2020 and spent most of the first half of this season injured, or sidelined after a positive coronavirus test. Now he has a new look off the pitch, sporting a beret everywhere he goes, and on the field he suddenly looks sharp again and ready to fight with Moise Kean for a place up front. 16 - Leaders Lyon are unbeaten in 16 Ligue 1 games, their best run since 2005 and the longest current run of any team in Europe's so-called ""Big Five"" leagues. 300 - PSG captain Marquinhos made his 300th appearance for the club in Wednesday's win over Marseille. The Brazilian defender was signed from Roma as a 19-year-old in 2013. 50 - Eighteen-year-old France international midfield prodigy Eduardo Camavinga's next game will be his 50th in France's top flight."

22,13/01/2021,23:08,Returning Neymar helps PSG to Champions Trophy triumph over Marseille,Neymar scored on his return to action for Paris Saint-Germain as they beat arch rivals Marseille 2-1 to win this season's Champions Trophy.,"The Brazilian rolled home an 85th minute penalty to put PSG two goals ahead following Mauro Icardi's first-half opener to give new coach Mauricio Pochettino the first trophy of his reign in the French capital, and managerial career. The Champions Trophy is the French equivalent of a Super Cup, usually contested at the start of the season by the league champions and French Cup winners. With PSG winning both last season, Marseille had been selected as their opponents as the Ligue 1 runners-up. This season's edition was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Hopes were high for a feisty tussle in Lens after Marseille's league win at PSG in September ended with five red cards and Neymar accusing Marseille centre back Alvaro Gonzalez of racism in the aftermath. However it was a largely tame encounter in northern France, with the most noteworthy incident being substitute Neymar's goalscoring return after a month away. The 28-year-old hadn't featured for the French champions since being stretchered off with an ankle injury during a 1-0 defeat to current league leaders Lyon on December 13. Icardi thought he had given PSG the lead with a 22nd minute tap-in, only to have the goal ruled out for offside after Kylian Mbappe strayed past Marseille's back line to collect Leandro Paredes' defence-splitting pass. Seven minutes later it was Mbappe's turn to have a goal chalked off when he started his run too early to connect with a long pass from his captain Marquinhos. Icardi finally put dominant PSG ahead six minutes before the break with a goal typical of his poacher's style, first meeting Angel Di Maria's raking long ball with a close-range header that Steven Mandanda pushed onto the post. The Argentine was quickest to follow up as the ball dribbled back out from the goal, and he tapped in his second goal is as many games since returning from injury. He almost doubled his side's lead in first half stoppage time when he hit a left-footed strike back off the crossbar. Neymar returned to action in the 65th minute and was immediately targeted by Gonzalez, the Argentine fouling the superstar attacker several times in what looked like a continuation of the pair's spat. However it was Neymar who had the last laugh when he stepped up to score the decisive second goal for PSG from the penalty spot after Icardi was brought down by Marseille's substitute keeper Yohann Pele. Dimitri Payet pulled one back for Marseille with a minute remaining but it was too little too late for Andre Villas-Boas' side."
23,12/01/2021,17:54,Neymar set to return for PSG in 'special game' for Pochettino,Neymar is in line to return for Paris Saint-Germain after four weeks on the sidelines in Wednesday's Champions Trophy game against bitter rivals Marseille.,"""Neymar is available and will be in the squad. We will decide tomorrow (Wednesday) if he plays or starts on the bench,"" PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino said at a virtual press conference ahead of the game. The world's most expensive player has not played since being stretchered off with an ankle injury at the end of PSG's Ligue 1 defeat to Lyon on December 13, missing his side's last five matches as a result. Neymar was one of three PSG players sent off in an ugly ending to PSG's most recent meeting with Marseille, who finished with nine men. The Brazilian later accused Marseille defender Alvaro Gonzalez of racism, although in the end no action was taken due to a lack of evidence. Wednesday's game is just PSG's third since former Tottenham Hotspur coach Pochettino was appointed as the successor to the sacked Thomas Tuchel, and offers the chance for him to win his first piece of silverware with the Qatar-owned club. The Champions Trophy is the French equivalent of a Super Cup, usually contested at the start of the season by the league champions and French Cup winners. With PSG winning both last season, Marseille have been selected as their opponents as the Ligue 1 runners-up. Played overseas in the last 10 years, including most recently in China, this season's edition was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic and is taking place in less exotic conditions behind closed doors in Lens in northern France. Nevertheless Pochettino, who played for PSG, called it a ""special match, but winning the game almost matters more than winning a trophy at the end of it"". His first game at the helm ended in a 1-1 draw with Saint-Etienne last week, before he oversaw a first win as PSG beat Brest 3-0 on Saturday to leave them a point behind Ligue 1 leaders Lyon at the campaign's halfway stage. While Neymar returns, young full-back Colin Dagba on Tuesday became the latest Paris player to test positive for Covid-19 and has joined team-mates Rafinha and Thilo Kehrer in having to isolate. Marseille, coached by Andre Villas-Boas, beat PSG 1-0 in that last, fiery meeting in the league in September, their first win over their greatest rivals in nine years. ""Andre and I both coached Tottenham. I have great affection for him and we get on well with each other,"" Pochettino said of his opposite number."
24,11/01/2021,21:18,Villas-Boas wants Marseille to settle PSG account in Trophy match,"Marseille coach Andre Villas-Boas said on Monday that despite the controversy surrounding the first meeting with Paris Saint-Germain this season, his team would approach the Champions Trophy between the clubs with ""aggression"" and ""intensity"".","He also said there was no pressure on his team because PSG's wealth had made French football ""the most unbalanced in the world."" But, he said, the financial pressures of the coronavirus pandemic could offer ""an opportunity to change the face of football"" Marseille's 1-0 victory over PSG in Ligue 1 in September was marred by five red cards, Angel Di Maria spitting at Marseille centre back Alvaro and Neymar accusing the same opponent of racism. The Champions Trophy usually pits the Ligue 1 champions against the French cup winners, but since PSG finished top of the league when the season was halted and won the cup, they face the league runners up Marseille in Lens on Wednesday. The Marseille coach said the encounters between the clubs, dubbed ""Clasicos"" in France, were ""always hot"". ""Fans demand we play these matches with aggression and authority. The match at the Parc des Princes was out of control at the end, but that was more because of provocation from the other side than from us"", he told a press conference. ""So we will go with humility, but also aggression and intensity."" Marseille have not won a trophy since 2012 but Villas-Boas said that was to do with Qatari financial backing for their rival. ""OM have won no titles since PSG changed the face of French football. It's not OM's fault, it's the reality of the most unbalanced championship in the world,"" he said. ""The norm is that PSG win all the national competitions. So we don't have this pressure to win."" ""When an opportunity comes up, you have to do the best you can."" A meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday between club presidents and the French players union, on wage cuts in the face of Covid-19. Villas-Boas said football had a chance to adjust its priorities. ""Clubs have lost their heads, all we've done is bullshit with transfers at 300 million euros. It could be good that the pandemic is pushing everyone to question themselves and that everyone calms down,"" he said. ""There are debts everywhere, losses of 300, 400, 500 million. Even at Real (Madrid) and Barca. We have to stop."" ""Of course, it's going to affect the employees of the game, that is to say us. But maybe it's a good opportunity to change the face of football."""
25,11/01/2021,18:14,Neymar returns to PSG training ahead of Champions Trophy,"Neymar has returned to training with Paris Saint-Germain, the French champions announced on Monday, two days before they take on Marseille in the Champions Trophy.","Brazilian Neymar, 28, was stretchered off the field with an ankle injury following a heavy challenge from Thiago Mendes in PSG's home Ligue 1 defeat to Lyon last month. Defender Presnel Kimpembe, who suffered a thigh injury in the goalless draw at Lille a week later, was pictured returning to training for the capital city club on Monday. However the pair are still doubts for the Champions Trophy match against Marseille, who finished second to PSG in Ligue 1 last season, in Lens on Wednesday. New coach Mauricio Pochettino said after Saturday's 3-0 win over mid-table outfit Brest that he did not know whether he would be able pick Neymar midweek. They could return to action in Saturday's league clash at Angers, with PSG one point behind current Ligue 1 leaders Lyon."
26,11/01/2021,12:35,"Messi on form, a new American star and Bayern beaten: Talking points from around Europe","Lionel Messi is bang in form in the new year, Schalke avoided matching the Bundesliga record for the most consecutive games without a win and there was a very rare defeat for Bayern Munich.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Lionel Messi looks like a man on a mission at the start of 2021 and what could be his final six months as a Barcelona player. On Saturday he scored twice -- including direct from a free-kick, one of his late-career specialities -- in a 4-0 win at Granada. That followed a masterful double and two shots off the post in a 3-2 midweek victory at Athletic Bilbao. Before that he provided the assist for Frenkie de Jong's winner at Huesca, and Barcelona have won three out of three since the turn of the year, while Messi is now La Liga's top scorer. Maybe it's not too late for Ronald Koeman's side to challenge for the title: they are third, four points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, albeit having played three games more. Matthew Hoppe is the latest young American to break through in the Bundesliga and he is already a hero for Schalke supporters. The California-born 19-year-old, who made his debut in November, had never scored a senior goal before netting a hat-trick -- the first ever for an American in the Bundesliga -- in the 4-0 defeat of Hoffenheim that rescued the Royal Blues from equalling an unwanted record. Their first win since January 17 last year, after 30 games without, prevented them from matching Tasmania Berlin's infamous German top-flight record of 31 games without a victory set in 1965/66. Hoppe has given hope to a whole club, and suddenly Schalke have new cause for optimism as they bid to beat the drop. They are off the bottom, above Mainz, but they remain in the relegation zone. Bayern Munich had begun to look a little less irresistible on a run of eight straight Bundesliga matches in which they had conceded the opening goal. But they had won five and drawn three of those matches. Then on Friday they were 2-0 up away to Borussia Moenchengladbach only to lose 3-2, just their second Bundesliga defeat since losing at the same ground in December 2019. It is a result that keeps the Bundesliga title race very much alive, although Hansi Flick's team have a winnable run of matches upcoming and they remain top, two points clear of RB Leipzig, who lost 3-1 at home to Borussia Dortmund, for whom Erling Braut Haaland scored twice. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen are four points off the top after drawing 1-1 with Werder Bremen. Three days after a 3-1 home loss to reigning champions Juventus which ended a 27-game unbeaten run in Serie A stretching back to June, AC Milan bounced back to beat Torino 2-0 at San Siro. With second-placed city rivals Inter drawing at Roma, Milan are now three points clear at the top of the table, and remain seven ahead of Juventus, who are fourth but do have a game in hand. Added good news for Milan came with the return of veteran top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic as a late substitute for his first appearance since November 22 after injury. The Swede came on for Rafael Leao, who had earlier scored his third goal in five games. Can Zlatan now fire the Rossoneri to their first Scudetto since 2011? Mauricio Pochettino got his first victory as coach of Paris Saint-Germain, a 3-0 defeat of Brest, but it is Lyon who lead halfway through the Ligue 1 season. They claimed the symbolic title of autumn champions after coming back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at Rennes on Saturday with Memphis Depay scoring one fine goal before setting up Jason Denayer's equaliser. Rudi Garcia's team are unbeaten in 16 games although both PSG and Lille are just a point behind, and there is a very long way to go. Ensuring Depay stays to see out the remainder of his contract rather than leaving this month will be crucial."
27,09/01/2021,23:11,Pochettino gets first win with PSG but Lyon stay top of Ligue 1,"Mauricio Pochettino celebrated his first victory as Paris Saint-Germain coach on his home debut on Saturday as Moise Kean set the reigning champions on their way to a 3-0 win over Brest, but Lyon remain top of Ligue 1 after drawing at Rennes.","Substitutes Mauro Icardi and Pablo Sarabia added late goals for PSG who would have gone top on goal difference had Lyon not recovered from 2-0 down to earn a point in Rennes and extend their unbeaten run to 16 games. PSG are second at the season's halfway stage, a point behind the leaders and ahead on goal difference of third-placed Lille, who triumphed 1-0 at Nimes. With Neymar still missing, it was not a vintage performance from PSG on a freezing Parisian night in an empty stadium -- supporters are still barred from games in France with a nighttime curfew in place nationwide as part of the fight against coronavirus. That meant it was never going to be the return to the Parc des Princes that Pochettino -- who was a popular player for PSG two decades ago -- would have liked. Nevertheless the Argentine will be relieved to have his first win in charge after his first game ended in a 1-1 draw at Saint-Etienne in midweek. He could now get his first piece of silverware when PSG play Marseille on Wednesday in the Champions Trophy, the French equivalent of a Super Cup that in normal times is the curtain-raiser to the season. It remains to be seen if Neymar, after four weeks on the sidelines, will be fit for that game, while defender Thilo Kehrer will be sidelined after news of his positive coronavirus test fell shortly before kick-off against Brest. Pochettino again started playmaker Marco Verratti in an advanced role behind central striker Kean, with the latter opening the scoring in the 16th minute. Captain Marquinhos headed Angel di Maria's corner against the post and Kean was on hand to nod in the rebound from barely a metre out. It was his 11th goal, and his ninth in Ligue 1, since signing on loan from Everton in October. Brest, who sit in mid-table and are one of the best sides to watch in France, could have scored before that but Keylor Navas clawed away Romain Faivre's early effort for the visitors. It was only in the final 10 minutes that PSG ran away with the game, as Kylian Mbappe set up Icardi -- on in place of Kean -- to get the second before Sarabia fired in to make it 3-0. Lyon's long unbeaten streak looked set to end as they found themselves two goals down in Rennes, with Clement Grenier and Benjamin Bourigeaud scoring for the home side. However, Memphis Depay pulled one back with his 11th goal of the season on 79 minutes and Jason Denayer equalised shortly after. Lille bounced back from a shock midweek home defeat by Angers to win at Nimes thanks to a first-half goal by veteran Turkish striker Burak Yilmaz. The draw for Rennes, and a goalless draw for Marseille at Dijon, allowed Monaco to move up to fourth spot as they beat Angers 3-0 with German international Kevin Volland grabbing his ninth Ligue 1 goal in between efforts from Guillermo Maripan and Stevan Jovetic. There were also wins for Bordeaux, Reims and Strasbourg."
28,08/01/2021,17:39,Neymar will miss Pochettino's home PSG bow,"Neymar will again be missing when Paris Saint Germain face Brest in Ligue 1, manager Mauricio Pochettino said on Friday.","Absent since being stretchered off in the defeat against Lyon in December, Neymar has not fully recovered from his ankle injury. ""He will be evaluated today, and we will work out a strategy from there,"" said Pochettino, who took over on January 2 and has yet to put out a team including the club's biggest star. Saturday's game will be Pochettino's first at home since taking charge. ""We will have a better idea if he can resume with the group, we are waiting for the results."" Neymar's absence casts doubt on whether he can play in the French Champions Trophy against bitter rivals Marseille on Wednesday. Saturday's games take Ligue 1 to the halfway point. Paris can still take the honorary title of 'autumn champions', if they beat Brest and Lyon lose at Rennes."
29,08/01/2021,03:00,Pochettino looking for lift-off with PSG,"Mauricio Pochettino described getting the job as Paris Saint-Germain coach as a gift from Father Christmas, but his first game in charge, with Neymar absent, indicated that not everything will be straightforward for the Argentine.","Pochettino's first home game as coach comes on Saturday when PSG take on Brest following their 1-1 draw with Saint-Etienne in midweek, a result which left the reigning champions three points behind leaders Lyon at the top of Ligue 1. Absent since being stretchered off in the defeat against Lyon in December, Neymar could return this weekend, although PSG have other injury problems to contend with and currently look some way short of being genuine contenders to win the Champions League. As well as the world's most expensive player, PSG were without the likes of Presnel Kimpembe, Juan Bernat, Alessandro Florenzi, Leandro Paredes, Danilo Pereira and Mauro Icardi in midweek. By the time PSG play Barcelona in the Champions League last 16, first leg on February 16, Pochettino will hope to have the majority of his other crocked players available again, and he will hope to have stamped his mark on his new side. ""A point is not enough, but in the circumstances we have to settle for it,"" said the former Tottenham Hotspur coach at the end of his first game after more than a year out of football. ""There are a lot of aspects we need to work on if we want to achieve great things in Paris. ""I am not worried. We don't have much time, but there is lots of quality in the team."" During his time out of the game, Pochettino had been linked in the English media with a possible move to one of the Premier League's giants were a job to become available, such as at Manchester United. But his past as a player at PSG, coupled with a reputation that has remained sky-high during his time out of the limelight, made it no great surprise to see him end up at the Parc des Princes. ""I am happy after 14 months without anything,"" he said after making his return to a dugout, albeit in these stark times of football without fans due to the coronavirus pandemic. ""It is also a bizarre feeling without supporters. It was strange. I had never experienced that before. There is much less warmth."" There is still a chance that Depay will leave Lyon before the January transfer window closes. A move to Barcelona fell through in October and he is out of contract at the end of the season, but Lyon fans will be hoping he stays until then to continue leading their title bid. With the captain's armband on, the Dutchman scored twice in Wednesday's 3-2 win over Lens which left OL three points clear of PSG at the top of the table. He has scored 10 times this season, and afterwards he said: ""Let's just make the most of my presence here, maybe until the end of the season. We have a great team. That's all I have to say."" Lyon go to fourth-placed Rennes on Saturday. 15 - League leaders Lyon are unbeaten in 15 matches and have won 10 of their last 12. 10 - Mauricio Pochettino is the 10th man to coach PSG having previously played for the club. The last was Antoine Kombouare, who was also the first of the Qatar era but was sacked in December 2011, within six months of the takeover. 10 - The number of seconds required by Monaco's Aleksandr Golovin to score against Lorient on Wednesday having come off the bench for his first appearance since August after injury.

30,07/01/2021,19:13,PSG to begin defence of French Cup against second-tier opponents,"Paris Saint-Germain will begin their French Cup defence with an away tie against either Guingamp or Caen, both Ligue 2 sides, after the draw for the last 64 of the delayed tournament was made on Thursday.","The match will be played in the week beginning February 8, one week before Mauricio Pochettino's side are due to face Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. Current Ligue 1 leaders Lyon will be at home to a second-division club too, facing either Chateauroux or Ajaccio. PSG beat Saint-Etienne in last season's final, which was eventually played in July, three months behind schedule due to the coronavirus pandemic that led to the league season being ended prematurely. The last-64 stage usually takes place in early January but has been postponed because all amateur football has been put on hold due to the pandemic. The format has also been modified to allow amateur sides the chance to play each other once restrictions are lifted.

31,06/01/2021,22:58,PSG held by Saint-Etienne,Mauricio Pochettino's first match as Paris Saint-Germain coach ended in a 1-1 draw at Saint-Etienne on Wednesday as his new team slipped three points behind Ligue 1 leaders Lyon.,"The defending league champions fell behind early on to Romain Hamouma's strike before Moise Kean levelled soon after, but laboured in the second half and failed to find a winner. ""Of course I'm disappointed because we're PSG, we want to win,"" Pochettino told Telefoot. ""I'm happy with the effort made by the players, by their attitude."" The former Tottenham boss was only confirmed as Thomas Tuchel's successor on Saturday, four days after the German's sacking was officially announced. But the scale of the task facing the former PSG defender was laid out in front of him at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard as the capital-city giants' title defence suffered another blow. ""This is just the beginning,"" added the 48-year-old Pochettino. ""We have to get to know each other. It was difficult because the preparation was too short. ""It's positive but there are things to improve."" Lyon survived a late Lens comeback to extend their lead with a 3-2 win, with Memphis Depay's double proving crucial. PSG did move into second, above Lille on goal difference, after Christophe Galtier's team slipped to a surprise 2-1 home loss to Angers. Pochettino made just two changes to the final starting XI selected by Tuchel for the 4-0 win over Strasbourg before the winter break, with Moise Kean and Idrissa Gueye returning in place of Rafinha and Timothee Pembele. PSG started well going forwards but looked vulnerable at the back and were made to pay in the 19th minute as Gueye carelessly lost possession on the edge of his own area. Denis Bouanga had plenty of time to pick out Romain Hamouma, who tapped into the net. But the visitors wasted little time in equalising as Kean repaid Pochettino's faith to score the first goal of the Argentinian's era, spinning and firing home after Marco Verratti's pass. The Italian striker has now scored 10 goals for PSG since joining on loan from Everton in the close season. But Les Verts, bidding to extend their unbeaten run to seven matches, continued to find gaping holes in the away defence and Keylor Navas had to make a smart, diving save to keep out Mathieu Debuchy's volley. Paris dominated possession early in the second period, but Saint-Etienne had the better chances, with Bouanga denied by Navas and Hamouma having a penalty appeal turned down. PSG started to pile on the pressure in the final 15 minutes, with Angel Di Maria forcing home goalkeeper Jessy Moulin into a smart low stop after Kylian Mbappe's clever dummy. Substitute Pablo Sarabia wasted a golden late chance in injury time, blazing over with just Moulin to beat. At Groupama Stadium, Lyon raced into a three-goal lead over Lens through Depay's brace and a Steven Fortes own goal. Rudi Garcia's OL, who led the top flight at Christmas for the first time since 2008, held on for a vital three points despite Florian Sotoca and Cheick Oumar Doucoure hitting back for Lens. Lille, who were level on points with Lyon heading into the day, dropped to third as Romain Thomas scored twice in the first 10 minutes for Angers at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. Burak Yilmaz pulled one back before the interval but the away side held on. Marseille boosted their title hopes, though, as Dimitri Payet's 80th-minute strike helped secure a 3-1 home success against Montpellier. Andre-Villas Boas' men are fifth, but only eight points behind Lyon with two games in hand. Earlier on Wednesday, former France coach Raymond Domenech's reign at 17th-placed Nantes started with a drab goalless draw against fourth-placed Rennes. ""We have laid the first stone,"" said Domenech, who led France to the 2006 World Cup final. ""Now we must continue to improve."" Monaco moved into fifth with a 5-2 victory at 10-man Lorient, with Aleksandr Golovin and Kevin Volland among the scorers."
32,05/01/2021,18:19,Pochettino starts at PSG with no time to waste,Mauricio Pochettino got on well with Diego Maradona and Ronaldinho during his playing days and his relationship with another global footballing superstar in Neymar will be key to his chances of success at Paris Saint-Germain.,"The Argentine this week begins his reign as coach of PSG, where his brief is to get the best out of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe and go one step further than his predecessor Thomas Tuchel. Sacked with six months left on his contract, Tuchel is unlikely to be missed by supporters of the Parisian club despite leading them to the Champions League final for the first time in their history. The German won the Ligue 1 title in each of his two full campaigns in charge and a domestic quadruple last season to go with the historic European run. Pochettino, in contrast, has never won a trophy as a coach but his credentials are clear. The 48-year-old is fondly remembered by fans of Tottenham Hotspur, who he steered to four straight top-four finishes in the Premier League and to the Champions League final in 2019. Now, refreshed after a year out of the game, he has resurfaced at a club where he was a popular player. Pochettino, who briefly played alongside Maradona at Newell's Old Boys and shared a room with the Argentine legend on away trips, was a central defensive stalwart at the Parc des Princes between 2001 and 2003. He helped them finish fourth in Ligue 1 in his first season, and captained them to a French Cup final in 2003, which they lost to Auxerre. That team, with an attack led by Ronaldinho -- ""a great teammate"" as Pochettino recalled in 2019 -- underachieved and the new coach knows what is expected now. ""This club has always held a special place in my heart,"" said Pochettino following his appointment on a contract until the end of next season, with the option of a further year. He spoke of the team's ""fantastic potential"" and he has no time to waste as he seeks to maximise that. His reputation depends on it. After all the impressive work at Espanyol, Southampton and Spurs, now is the time for Pochettino to add silverware to his CV in Paris, where domestic success is taken for granted and progress in Europe matters most. In the last eight years, Qatar-owned PSG have won seven Ligue 1 titles and five French Cups. They also won the now defunct League Cup six times. Yet Tuchel left the team third in Ligue 1, a point behind Lyon and Lille. The last time PSG changed coach mid-season, in 2011/12, Carlo Ancelotti came in and failed to win the title. Pochettino, who arrives with his faithful assistant Miguel D'Agostino and a backroom team also including his son, Sebastiano, needs to hit the ground running. Appointed on Saturday, his first game in charge is at Saint-Etienne on Wednesday and his first chance to win silverware comes next midweek, when PSG play Marseille in the Champions Trophy, the match which usually starts the French season. ""It is going to be a difficult start for him. Let's not judge him right away or expect to see 'his' team already,"" Luis Fernandez, who coached the Argentine when he played for PSG, told AFP. Pochettino will need to put his stamp on PSG in time for their Champions League last-16 tie against Barcelona, the first leg of which is in February. Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen, who played under Pochettino at Spurs, have already been linked with January moves to Paris, but Neymar and Mbappe will be central for Pochettino. Monday's edition of sports daily L'Equipe carried a photo of Pochettino laughing with Mbappe, his shoulder around the France star. Fernandez has no doubts about the new coach. ""The players are going to like him. He has that human side, the approach that will allow the players to express themselves,"" he told France Football. ""When you have a coach like Mauricio, you want to fight for him, do things for him."""
33,03/01/2021,14:41,Tuchel's former PSG assistant says sacking 'a shock',"Thomas Tuchel's abrupt sacking by French champions Paris Saint-Germain came as a ""shock"" despite signs it was inevitable, according to the German manager's former Hungarian assistant Zsolt Low.","""Let's be honest, this situation was not sustainable in the long run,"" Low said in an interview Saturday with the Hungarian newspaper Nemzeti Sport. At the helm since July 2018 Tuchel's involvement was abruptly ended by the Qatari-backed club on December 24, reportedly for comments viewed as critical of its Qatari owners. Former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, 48, who played for PSG from 2001 to 2003, was officially named as new coach by the French giants Saturday. ""Looking back now, it was better to say goodbye when we did, more or less at the top, with by far mostly nice memories under our belts, these two and a half years have been beautiful,"" said Low. ""We were surprised because on December 23, after the 4-0 win over Strasbourg, Leonardo (PSG's sporting director) called us in to say he did not need Thomas in the future,"" said Low. ""Even though there were signs it was coming, Leonardo's announcement still was kind of a shock for us,"" he said. ""After having struggled with considerable difficulties in 2020,...we found the decision somewhat incomprehensible,"" he added. The 47-year-old Tuchel oversaw the club's first ever Champions League final appearance in August, which they lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich, and he left Parc de Princes with the team boasting the likes of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe into the knock-out stages this season. ""Considering that we were hampered by countless injuries throughout the season, and also had to deal with the coronavirus, it was a great professional achievement to close the year this way,"" said Low. ""The truth is that we over-performed,"" he said, citing PSG's smooth Champions League progression, and current league position just a point behind leaders Lyon. But relations between the German and Leonardo had soured in recent months, with ""different principles of governance"" driving a wedge between the pair according to the Hungarian. Everyone ""could hear that there had been tension,... they had different ideas in many areas, and those differences in view only grew over time,"" said Low. ""In other words, the announcement was not completely a bolt from the blue,"" he said. Despite appearing to be adept at man-managing PSG's squad of superstar players Tuchel also reportedly upset the Qatari-backed club after complaining about an apparent lack of recognition at leading PSG to the Champions League final. Pochettino was due to meet up with his new platers on Sunday."
34,20/12/2020,23:18,Lille reclaim top spot with PSG stalemate,Lille moved back top of Ligue 1 on Sunday after holding Paris Saint-Germain to an uninspiring goalless draw which failed to live up to its pre-match billing.,"Lille take first place in the French top flight from Lyon on goal difference after a match which saw just a handful of shots on target and very little in the way of incident. PSG are a point back in third after failing to create anything from their territorial dominance, shorn of attacking inspiration without Neymar and Mauro Icardi, among others, while Kylian Mbappe started on the bench as he reportedly struggles with a thigh knock. Marseille meanwhile are five points behind the leaders after their 1-1 draw with Reims on Saturday, although Andre Villas-Boas' side do have two games in hand on their title rivals. PSG were the stronger side in a dismal first half which didn't see a shot on target until Moise Kean's weak flicked header was easy collected by Mike Maignan in the 42nd minute. Lille, who on Friday were sold to Callisto, a subsidiary of the Merlyn Partners investment fund, struggled to get a foothold in the biggest match of their league campaign so far. PSG's dominance continued in the second period but they were lacking their usual creative spark, and the highlight of the latter stages was Presnel Kimpembe's superb tackle on Burak Yilmaz with Lille charging towards goal on the break. Kimpembe appeared to injure a hamstring as he charged across to make the goal-saving tackle with 12 minutes remaining, and limped off soon afterwards. Mbappe had been brought on a minute before Kimpembe's challenge but did very little in the time afforded him, and the curtain was soon brought down on a forgettable encounter between two tired-looking teams. Germany striker Kevin Volland scored his sixth Ligue 1 goal as Monaco battled to a 1-0 win at bottom club Dijon to snap a three-match losing streak. Their win moved the seventh-placed principality club within seven points of Lille and Lyon. Former Bayer Leverkusen forward Volland slotted in the only goal on 15 minutes, with both sides seeing later efforts ruled out by VAR. ""After four straight wins and then three defeats on the bounce, the most important thing was to win,"" said coach Niko Kovac. ""It was not the best Monaco but we showed lots of character and that's the best way to move forward."" Rennes are two points ahead of Monaco in fifth after strolling to a 3-0 win at Lorient, who sit second-from-bottom after their 11th defeat of the season. Damien Da Silva opened the scoring with a deflected close-range effort midway through the first half, and Benjamin Bourigeaud doubled the away side's lead with a fine first-time strike with 20 minutes remaining. Martin Terrier completed the scoring six minutes later when he cut in from the left before curling home past Paul Nardi. Rennes are level with Marseille on 28 points, five behind Lille. One point ahead of Lorient in 18th place are Nimes, who came away from Saint-Etienne with a 2-2 draw. Elsewhere, Montpellier missed the chance to move into fourth as they were held to a 2-2 draw at Brest."
35,18/12/2020,03:25,PSG wait on Neymar return ahead of Lille showdown,"Paris Saint-Germain are hoping to have Neymar back in time for their top-of-the-table clash at Lille on Sunday, as the Brazil superstar looks to have recovered quicker than expected from what looked like a bad ankle injury.","Coach Thomas Tuchel said ""for Neymar we will do everything"" after Wednesday's 2-0 win over struggling Lorient, which put the champions second and keeps them just a point behind Ligue 1 leaders Lille. Neymar had already revealed the injury, which came after a rough Thiago Mendes tackle during last weekend's 1-0 home loss to Lyon, was not as bad as initially thought. However such a speedy return still seemed unlikely until Tuchel revealed he could yet feature at the Stade Pierre Mauroy. ""I can't say 'No, he's not playing against Lille'. It is possible. We can try, we will try everything,"" Tuchel said. His return would be a huge boost to PSG's morale after a strife-ridden opening few months of the season which has led to speculation over Tuchel's future. A win on Sunday would put the capital city side back on top of the pile after they moved above Lyon in the midweek round of fixtures, with a five-match winning-streak for Rudi Garcia's side coming to an end with a dramatic 2-2 draw with Brest. PSG's other major title rivals Marseille host Reims on Saturday as they lurk five points back but with a game in hand. Fourth-placed Marseille go into the weekend having lost ground in the title race following a 2-1 defeat at Rennes, who have won two on the bounce after a miserable run in which they lost seven of their previous eight in all competitions. There appears to be some tension in the Marseille camp after coach Andre Villas-Boas launched an attack on a journalist at French newspaper La Provence. According to witnesses the Portuguese boss targeted the reporter with threats of ""I'll get you"" and criticised their work during the post-match press conference. The row, apparently over an article which slammed Villas-Boas' career record in the Champions League following their dismal effort in this year's competition, then carried on outside Rennes' Roazhon Park as the reporter and coach faced each other down. Lille, meanwhile, seem confident they can maintain their slight hold on the summit and make this a true title race in a league now used to PSG dominance. The northern outfit seem to be unworried by a potential change in ownership, with president Gerard Lopez saying he would ""completely withdraw"" from the club if a bid from a Luxembourg investment fund is accepted. ""Both teams are tired, Paris might have more quality but in one game everything is there to play for,"" said coach Christophe Galtier. Turkey's Yazici continued his impressive recent form on Wednesday when he scored the opening goal in Lille's 2-0 win at Dijon. The 23-year-old showed the composure that has seen him score five times in just three Ligue 1 starts, and six in as many Europa League appearances, when he slotted home Zeki Celik's cutback in the 19th minute. Yazici signed for Lille in the summer of 2019 but this has become the attacker's breakout season, his two hat-tricks at Sparta Prague and AC Milan helping his side reach the Europa League last 32, where they will face four-time European champions Ajax. 5 - goals that Yusuf Yazici has scored this Ligue 1 season 12 - the number of games Lyon have played since last losing 4 - PSG have already lost to Lens, Marseille, Monaco and Lyon so far this season"
36,14/12/2020,16:25,Neymar says ankle injury 'could have been worse',Brazilian star Neymar gave fans a reassuring message on Monday after undergoing tests on the ankle he injured in Paris Saint-Germain's 1-0 Ligue 1 defeat to Lyon at the weekend.,"Neymar left the field on a stretcher in apparent agony on Sunday but on Instagram he said: ""It could have been worse."" PSG had earlier said ""the clinical opinion following a left ankle sprain sustained last night, is reassuring."" ""These tears, it's the pain, the fear, the worry, the surgeries, the crutches and other bad memories,"" Neymar wrote on his Instagram story alongside a picture of him in tears clutching his ankle. It was a reference to previous injuries he has suffered -- notably twice breaking his foot -- since joining the French champions in 2017. ""It could have been worse, but once again, God saved me from something serious,"" added Neymar. ""I'm going to recover and return as soon as possible."" The announcement is positive news for PSG after a bad night on Sunday in which they lost top spot in Ligue 1 to Lille following a 1-0 home defeat to Lyon, who also leapfrogged the capital club into second place. Lyon's Brazilian midfielder Thiago Mendes, who was sent off for the foul that resulted in Neymar's injury, apologized on Instagram. ""Mistakes happen. But I'm here to sincerely apologize to Neymar. Like all Brazil's footballing public, I admire his football and I hope it's nothing serious."" Qatar-backed PSG will feel confident Neymar will be back in time for their Champions League last 16 clash in February against troubled Barcelona. It will be another chance for the French side to avenge their soul-destroying 'Remontada' defeat to Barca in 2017. Having beaten the Catalans 4-0 in the French capital, PSG crashed to a 6-1 defeat at the Camp Nou orchestrated by Neymar, who joined PSG in a 222-million-euro ($269 million) world record move weeks later. On Sunday night, Neymar's father hit out at the treatment he claims the 28-year-old is subjected to by opponents, calling for more yellow cards. PSG have been ravaged by a series of injuries, suspensions and coronavirus cases this season, which has left coach Thomas Tuchel's position in the balance. Despite heavy investment since Qatar Sports Investments bought the club in 2011, PSG are yet to claim Europe's biggest prize despite dominating in Ligue 1 with the likes of Neymar and France star Kylian Mbappe. They reached the final last season but were beaten 1-0 by Bayern Munich thanks to a goal from PSG's own youth product Kingsley Coman."
37,14/12/2020,00:24,Lyon defeat PSG as Neymar stretchered off with ankle injury,Paris Saint-Germain surrendered top spot in Ligue 1 after losing 1-0 at home to Lyon on Sunday but potentially suffered a more devastating blow as an anguished Neymar was stretchered off with an ankle injury.,"Tino Kadewere's first-half goal secured Lyon a seventh win in eight matches as they moved level with Lille, who took over first place earlier in the day following a 2-1 home victory over Bordeaux. PSG dropped to third after losing for the fourth time in 14 games this season, but the far greater concern will be the health of Neymar after his ankle appeared to twist awkwardly under a challenge from Thiago Mendes in stoppage time. The Lyon midfielder was sent off for the tackle following a VAR review while a distraught Neymar, in considerable pain, was taken off on a stretcher having immediately signalled for medical assistance. ""He's with the physio and the doctors and we have to wait for the tests tomorrow (Monday),"" PSG coach Thomas Tuchel told French broadcaster Telefoot. Lyon's first win away to PSG since October 2007, the last season they won the Ligue 1 crown, provided fresh hope of a genuine title race this term with the top five teams separated by just three points. ""We defended well, we destroyed their strength, and then played well enough in attack to score at least once,"" said Lyon coach Rudi Garcia. PSG trail the leading duo by a point with Marseille, who have two games in hand on their rivals, another point back in fourth alongside Montpellier. ""Losing top spot doesn't worry me. But we didn't have the right approach and I have a problem with that,"" said Tuchel. ""We were never mentally ready to play this match. We were shot mentally. We never found our rhythm either. We didn't play with enough concentration or discipline. ""It was a big step backwards after the last match. I'm surprised. I was expecting a very high level."" With Kylian Mbappe rested from the start, Moise Kean partnered Neymar in attack following the Brazilian's hat-trick in the midweek 5-1 Champions League win against Istanbul Basaksehir -- a game that was completed 24 hours later than planned after an unprecedented anti-racism protest. However it was Lyon, without any European commitments this season, who took the lead on 35 minutes after a loose pass under pressure from PSG captain Presnel Kimpembe. Karl Toko Ekambi collected the ball in the PSG half and immediately picked out Kadewere who steadied himself before sliding low beyond Keylor Navas for the Zimbabwe international's fifth goal of the campaign. Alessandro Florenzi drew a sharp save from Anthony Lopes before half-time while a thumping effort from Lucas Paqueta called Navas into action midway through the second half, just after the introduction of Mbappe. After Navas kept out an attempt from Lyon substitute Bruno Guimaraes, Mbappe had a late chance to rescue a point for PSG but shot wide from the edge of the area in time added on before Neymar's unwelcome injury. Portugal defender Jose Fonte, who turns 37 later this month, scored the winner for Lille with a bullet header just before half-time against Bordeaux. Jonathan Bamba's exquisite curling strike gave Lille the lead on 16 minutes at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy before Toma Basic levelled from a Hatem Ben Arfa corner. Lille travel to bottom side Dijon in midweek before the visit of defending champions PSG next Sunday in what could be a defining week for a club chasing a first league title since 2011. ""I don't think we can fight with Paris for the title. We need to fight to pick up points and stay at the top,"" said Lille coach Christophe Galtier, keen to temper expectations."
38,11/12/2020,03:10,'Settled' Neymar leads the way in big week for PSG,"Neymar played a leading part in the unprecedented anti-racism protest which saw Paris Saint-Germain and Istanbul Basaksehir players leave the field in their Champions League match this week, and the Brazilian has also been living up to his status as the world's most expensive player in recent weeks.","The former Barcelona superstar's hat-trick in PSG's 5-1 win over the Turks when the game restarted a day later included two goals that were simply out of this world. Neymar had previously scored the winner against RB Leipzig and a brace in the 3-1 victory at Manchester United and his goals allowed the French champions to finish top of an awkward Champions League group. He explained the decision to walk off in protest at the alleged use of a racist term by one of the Romanian match officials was something that ""needed to be done to see if the world can change a little"". The images of him kneeling, with a clenched fist raised, in support of the Black Lives Matter movement were powerful. PSG supporters would also have been encouraged to hear the 28-year-old stress he is happy in Paris, a week after creating headlines by admitting he wanted to be on the same team as Lionel Messi next season. ""I am very happy here in Paris, at the club, with my teammates, so the idea of leaving is not going through my head, but people need things to talk about,"" he told broadcaster RMC Sport. ""I am really happy and settled so let's see what happens in the future."" Like Kylian Mbappe -- who recently scored his 100th PSG goal -- Neymar's contract runs until 2022 but PSG are hopeful the duo will sign new terms. ""We have started talking. It is all confidential but we are confident, both of them want to stay,"" said PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi. Mbappe and Neymar, who has scored or set up 65 goals in 65 Champions League matches, will lead PSG into a top-of-the-table Ligue 1 clash at home to in-form Lyon on Sunday. The defending champions are top but the five teams below them are all within five points, with Lyon two points behind the leaders. Forget Neymar and Mbappe, Di Maria was PSG's best player in the last, curtailed French season. In fact he has probably been their standout performer since the two most expensive signings in history arrived in August 2017. However, the Argentine has lost his place in recent weeks. His only start in PSG's last four games came when PSG fielded a second-string XI at Montpellier. In the win at Manchester United not only did he not come on, he was at one stage stripped for action only to be sent back to his seat. Out of contract at the end of this season -- a situation that has put the 32-year-old's future in the spotlight -- Di Maria will hope for a recall against Lyon. 5 - Marseille have won their last five Ligue 1 games. Four points behind leaders PSG, they are on course to top the table if they win their two games in hand, but they face a tough test against Monaco on Saturday. 13 - After finishing 13th last season, Nantes this week parted company with coach Christian Gourcuff with the Canaries taking just 13 points from their first 13 games in this campaign. The eight-time French champions became the fourth club to change coach this season. One of the others, bottom side Dijon, are their opponents this weekend. 10 - Lyon are unbeaten in 10 games as they search for a first win at the Parc des Princes since 2007."
39,09/12/2020,23:21,Neymar defends walkout in racism row as PSG and Basaksehir complete suspended match,"Paris Saint-Germain and Istanbul Basaksehir played their Champions League match to a conclusion on Wednesday, 24 hours after it had been suspended, with Neymar scoring a hat-trick before saying both teams had felt compelled to make a stand against racism in what was an unprecedented protest over an alleged comment by an official.","PSG won the game 5-1 after it restarted where it had stopped the previous day, in the 14th minute, following a touchline argument over accusations the Romanian fourth official, Sebastian Coltescu, had described Basaksehir's Cameroonian assistant coach Pierre Webo as ""black"", or ""negru"" in Romanian. ""Sometimes in extreme circumstances these things need to be done to see if the world can change a little,"" said Neymar, who together with other players and the new team of officials gathered around the centre circle and took a knee before the restart on Wednesday in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Players also sported t-shirts with the slogan ""No To Racism"" while warming up at the Parc des Princes, where large banners in the empty stands carried the same message. ""What happened was unacceptable. In the times we live in we cannot accept differences being made like that about colour or race,"" Neymar told French broadcaster RMC Sport. ""It has no place in football, or in life, or in any sport, so our attitude was perfect."" Coltescu and the other Romanian match officials were replaced for the restart by a new refereeing team headed by the Netherlands' Danny Makkelie. Basaksehir had already been eliminated from the Champions League even before this game but they left their mark on the competition with their response to the treatment of Webo, who was sent off as he reacted furiously to the alleged comment. That red card was suspended by UEFA pending a probe, with European football's governing body promising a ""thorough investigation"". ""The fourth official used an unacceptable word to Pierre Achille Webo. The referee should have dealt with the situation properly but didn't. We had to show that we were with Webo,"" said Basaksehir coach Okan Buruk. The Turkish champions had refused to restart the game on Tuesday as long as fourth official Coltescu was still involved. ""Webo was upset. We all gave him our support, but it's someone else who should feel bad and that is the person who used the words. He is the guilty one. ""We have to show that we can all live together. Humanity is the most important thing."" Basaksehir are understood to have close ties to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and he led the political reaction to the incidents, tweeting that he ""strongly condemns the racist remarks"". Television microphones in the empty stadium -- matches are taking place without spectators because of Covid-19 restrictions -- picked up a furious Webo repeatedly asking why a racist term had been used to describe him. In the exchange in question between the all-Romanian officiating team, Coltescu said: ""The black one over there. This is not possible. Go and identify him. That guy, the black one."" Basaksehir's Senegalese forward Demba Ba could be heard remonstrating with the official in English, saying: ""When you mention a white guy, you never say 'this white guy', you just say 'this guy', so why when you mention a black guy do you say 'this black guy?'"" The incident drew reaction from around the world, with Rio Ferdinand, the former Manchester United and England defender and now a TV pundit, saying on BT Sport in the UK: ""I think we are at a disturbing tipping point. Not a week goes by without an incident involving race. ""The players walking off is a step in the right direction, but it can't just be left to them."" Ferdinand's brother Anton was involved in a high-profile incident in 2012 when Chelsea player John Terry was accused of racially abusing him during a match in England. Many athletes have taken a strong stand against racism since Black Lives Matter protests flared around the world over the death of George Floyd during his arrest in Minneapolis in May. Already qualified for the last 16 thanks to Manchester United's defeat to RB Leipzig on Tuesday, PSG still needed to win the restarted game to secure top spot in their group and cruised to victory. As well as Neymar's stunning hat-trick, the world's most expensive player won a penalty which Kylian Mbappe converted. Mbappe scored another goal, PSG's fifth, after Mehmet Topal pulled one back for Basaksehir. av-gkg-gj-as/mw <org>MANCHESTER UNITED</org> <org></org>"

In the times we live in we cannot accept differences being made like that about colour or race,"" Neymar told French broadcaster RMC Sport after scoring a hat-trick when the game was restarted on Wednesday, with PSG winning 5-1. ""It has no place in football, or in life, or in any sport, so our attitude was perfect."" The match in Paris was halted in the 14th minute on Tuesday as a row erupted amid accusations the Romanian fourth official had used a racist term to describe Basaksehir's Cameroonian assistant coach, Pierre Webo. With Basaksehir refusing to come back out unless the official was removed, the game was played to a finish 24 hours later with a new refereeing team. Meanwhile, European football's governing body UEFA has opened an investigation into the unprecedented incidents. ""Sometimes in extreme circumstances these things need to be done to see if the world can change a little,"" said Neymar, who together with other players took a knee before the restart on Wednesday in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. PSG had already qualified for the last 16 before the restart, but they needed to beat Basaksehir to finish top of their group and Kylian Mbappe scored their other two goals in a one-sided game. Neymar added: ""Yesterday I wasn't very happy because we had prepared ourselves for the game, and so to go back home, then get the body warmed up again for the next day, is very hard, but we all accepted it. We all decided to do it together."" Meanwhile, Basaksehir coach Okan Buruk accused the Romanian referee, Ovidiu Hategan, of failing to properly manage the situation after the alleged comments made by the fourth official, Sebastian Coltescu. ""The fourth official used an unacceptable word to Pierre Achille Webo. The referee should have dealt with the situation properly but didn't. We had to show that we were with Webo,"" Buruk said. ""The players decided to stop. Some of them didn't want to come back out. We are a team and we had to stick together."" He added: ""UEFA did the right thing by making it possible to play the next day. ""Webo was upset. We all gave him our support, but it's someone else who should feel bad and that is the person who used the words. He is the guilty one. ""We have to show that we can all live together. Humanity is the most important thing."" The incident drew a reaction from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is understood to have close links to the Turkish champions. However, Buruk played down suggestions that the row could spill over into a diplomatic issue. ""There are no problems between Turkey and Romania. It is the fault of one person, not an entire country,"" he said."

The group game in Paris, which was goalless at the time, was suspended and will resume where it left off, in the 14th minute, on Wednesday, with a different set of match officials. Many athletes have taken a strong stand against racism since Black Lives Matter protests flared around the world over the death of George Floyd during his arrest in Minneapolis in May. PSG striker Kylian Mbappe tweeted, ""Say no to racism"", while team-mate Neymar posted, ""Black Lives Matter"". Both players were prominent in the heated discussions on the touchline. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is understood to be close to Basaksehir's owners, tweeted that he ""strongly condemn(s) the racist remarks"", while Romanian-born French sports minister Roxanna Maracineanu praised the players' ""historic decision"". Basaksehir midfielder Giuliano told Brazilian media: ""(The comment) was very clear, many people heard, including our coach. It was disgraceful. ""As a team and a group, we decided to protest because that is unacceptable. Racism has to end."" The row blew up after Webo was shown a red card. Television microphones in the empty Parc des Princes stadium then picked up a furious Webo repeatedly asking why a racist term had been used to describe him. In the exchange in question between the all-Romanian officiating team, Coltescu said: ""The black one over there. This is not possible. Go and identify him. That guy, the black one.""

UEFA promised a ""thorough investigation"" into the incident and confirmed the match would restart at 1755 GMT on Wednesday. European football's governing body said it had ""decided on an exceptional basis to have the remaining minutes of the match played (Wednesday) with a new team of match officials"". UEFA's regulations for the Champions League stipulate that, normally, any team refusing to play must forfeit the game and also faces a fine of 250,000 euros ($303,000). Danny Makkelie of the Netherlands was named as the referee for the remainder of the game, with the other officials from the Netherlands and Poland. They replace Romanian referee Ovidiu Hategan, his two assistants and Coltescu. The president of the Turkish champions said his side refused to restart the game as long as the fourth official was still involved. ""The fourth official used the word 'negro' in front of everybody. If the fourth official is removed from the pitch, then we will restart,"" Goksel Gumusdag told Turkish television channel TRT Spor. Basaksehir responded to the incidents by tweeting ""NO TO RACISM #Respect"", along with a photo of UEFA's anti-racism logo. The message was retweeted by PSG, who later tweeted their support on their English-language feed. ""All forms of racism go against the values held by Paris Saint-Germain, the club's Chairman, staff and players,"" the French champions said. Despite the interruption of the match, played behind closed doors because of the coronavirus pandemic, PSG qualified for the last 16 from Group H after RB Leipzig beat Manchester United 3-2 in Germany.

English forward Stephy Mavididi levelled before half-time at the Stade de la Mosson, the ball just crossing the line despite the best efforts of Dagba and Keylor Navas. Moise Kean restored the advantage for PSG on 77 minutes after Rafinha triggered a quick counter, hitting a magnificent solo goal for his fifth in seventh league games. The Italy international was then replaced by Mbappe, who wrapped up the victory in stoppage time as he brought up his century of goals in his 137th game for PSG, tapping in a Layvin Kurzawa cross. ""I've been wanting to score for a few matches, it's a bit of a release,"" Mbappe told Canal Plus. ""When I signed here I wouldn't even had thought of scoring three goals,"" he beamed. ""(A hundred) was part of a distant goal."" Mbappe is joint-fourth on the list of PSG's all-time top scorers, level with Dominique Rocheteau and trailing Pauleta (109), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (156) and Edinson Cavani (200). ""I'm feeling better and better, stringing matches together is going to allow me to get fully fit,"" he said. ""When I came here, I said that I wanted to get a lot better and you don't do that in a year. ""It's been three and a half years, I've experienced a lot of things here. I've had some less good moments, but the club has always supported me."" Defending champions PSG pulled four points clear of Marseille at the top as they avoided going three league games without victory for the first time since April 2019. Montpellier, without top scorer Andy Delort after he tested positive for coronavirus for the second time in three months, saw their hopes of dislodging the leaders dashed as their four-match winning run came to an end. Earlier, Rennes crashed to a sixth defeat in seven matches as they lost 2-0 at home to Lens, three days being dumped out of Europe. Teenage striker Arnaud Kalimuendo, on loan from PSG, hit the opener on 27 minutes and Ignatius Ganago sealed the victory late in the second half."

""We have to respect Messi and Barcelona. Messi is a Barcelona player. When someone talks abut our player, we're unhappy, so we don't talk about other clubs' players,"" he told Canal+. ""It's not the time to talk about that, to talk about the transfer window, we're thinking about our season, our goals, staying focused. ""We have the squad to do that, a competitive team even if we rotate players,"" he added. On Friday, Barca coach Ronald Koeman criticised interim club president Carles Tusquets who said earlier in the week they should have sold the record six-time Ballon d'Or winner during the summer. The 33-year-old made an attempt to leave the Camp Nou before backing down in September, although he is free to leave next year. Additionally, Brazilian Leonardo said talks are ongoing with France World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe about a new deal, with his contract up in June 2022. ""It's moving along well. We've taken steps forward compared to 10 or 15 years ago, we'll keep on going,"" he said."

With Messi having spent the last close season trying to engineer a move away from Barcelona, who are suffering badly from the economic impact of the coronavirus, Neymar perhaps feels a reunion in Paris is more likely than his return to the Camp Nou. Meanwhile PSG are pondering how to deal with Neymar's contract, and that of Kylian Mbappe, which both expire in 2022. The Qatar-owned club are also feeling the effects of the pandemic, which has slashed ticket revenue in particular, with games in France being played behind closed doors. Qualifying for the Champions League last 16 would provide a financial boost. Thomas Tuchel's team only require a draw at home to Istanbul Basaksehir next week to seal their progress. ""I didn't come to Paris to play in the Europa League,"" Neymar told Brazil's Esporte Interativo. However, Tuchel warned: ""We have almost qualified, which means we have not qualified yet. That is the reality. Being almost pregnant does not mean you are pregnant."" Last season's Champions League runners-up are a work in progress and they have allowed the chasing domestic pack to catch up. A loss at Monaco and a draw with Bordeaux in their last two matches have left PSG just two points clear of Lille, Lyon, Monaco and Montpellier in Ligue 1. PSG go to Montpellier this weekend knowing a defeat would knock them off top spot. Montpellier, though, are without their top scorer Andy Delort after he tested positive for coronavirus for the second time in three months. The ambitious Cote d'Azur club reacted to suffering their fifth straight defeat against Bayer Leverkusen in the Europa League on Thursday by sacking coach Patrick Vieira. The France 1998 World Cup-winning midfielder took the club to seventh and then fifth in the last two seasons but had been under pressure with Nice in the bottom half of Ligue 1, despite being expected to progress this season following considerable investment from the club's British owners Ineos. Appointed in 2018, Vieira had been hampered in recent weeks by the loss of veteran captain Dante to a serious injury. He has been replaced by his assistant, Adrian Ursea. The 53-year-old Romanian, who has spent much of his playing and coaching career in Switzerland, had been an assistant to previous Nice coach Lucien Favre and returned last year to work under Vieira. Ursea's first game in charge will be away at struggling Reims on Sunday. 4 - The number of points separating the top six in Ligue 1. Marseille, in sixth, are four points behind leaders PSG but have two games in hand on the teams above them. 3 - If PSG fail to win at Montpellier they will have gone three Ligue 1 games without winning for the first time since April 2019. 9 - Lyon have injected life into their season on a run of nine games without defeat, leaving them just two points off top spot."
46,01/12/2020,03:10,More than just prestige on the line for PSG,"Paris Saint-Germain will be playing for their Champions League lives against Manchester United on Wednesday, with last season's runners-up knowing the costs of group-stage elimination could be enormous on and off the field.","Anything less than victory at Old Trafford and the French champions could see their destiny slip out of their hands going into the last game in Group H. Neymar's penalty gave the Qatar-owned club victory over RB Leipzig last week, but Thomas Tuchel's team performed poorly and the coach's agitation when searching questions are put to him by the press suggest all is not well in Paris. PSG are top of Ligue 1, although their lead has been trimmed back in recent weeks following more disappointing displays. ""There is no way we can play like that in Manchester, like we did in the second half,"" Tuchel warned after Saturday's 2-2 draw with Bordeaux. There will be potentially major consequences if they fail to qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League, something they have managed in each of the last eight seasons since becoming regulars in the competition again after the Qatari takeover. Tuchel is out of contract after this season and sporting director Leonardo is not believed to be a huge fan of the German, even if he recently dismissed reports he was looking for a replacement. ""Honestly the club has never thought about another coach to replace Tuchel. Now is the time to concentrate on our objectives and to stick together,"" Leonardo said in a question and answer session with supporters. Despite that, it is hard to imagine Tuchel surviving in the event of a European disaster, as being dumped out at the first hurdle would be a huge blow to PSG's prestige. Over the last decade it has become almost impossible for such ignominy to befall one of Europe's super clubs, a category into which PSG now fit as the fifth-richest in the world according to Deloitte's Football Money League. Barcelona have made it out of their group in every season since returning to the competition in 2004, while Real Madrid have got out of their group in every year since 1997. Bayern Munich have done so in every year since 2008. Manchester City have already secured an eighth consecutive appearance in the last 16, Juventus a seventh. After revelling in the team's run to the final in Lisbon, PSG's Qatari owners would not take kindly to such a sporting slap in the face. Financially, the repercussions could be serious. PSG are looking at ways of extending the contracts of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, whose existing deals expire in 2022, but how can they in their current financial predicament? Documents released in 2018 by Football Leaks showed Neymar's after-tax salary to be 30 million euros ($35.8m) a year while Mbappe's salary was due to rise to 11 million euros this year. If PSG are prepared to offer whatever it takes to keep them, will they be able to invest in the other areas of the team that need upgrading? They have been hamstrung by the coronavirus crisis, suffering huge losses from the decision to cut short the last French season. RMC Sport recently reported that PSG were preparing for a loss of some 200 million euros this season, chiefly from lost gate receipts due to the pandemic. A group-stage exit from the Champions League would only make things worse. Just reaching the last 16 was worth 9.5 million euros last season, while reaching and winning the final was worth another 41.5 million euros, enough to cover the wages of Neymar and Mbappe for a year. UEFA is set to reduce prize money over the next few years because of the impact of the health crisis, but PSG can ill afford to miss out on these sums. The stakes in Manchester will be high."
47,27/11/2020,03:05,Tension gets to Tuchel at crunch point in season for PSG,"Paris Saint-Germain are in their usual position on top of Ligue 1 but, with their Champions League hopes still in the balance, their coach Thomas Tuchel has been letting the tension get to him.","The German appeared particularly agitated as he spoke after PSG's 1-0 win over RB Leipzig on Tuesday, a crucial victory in the context of their European campaign but one that came in another unconvincing performance from last season's Champions League runners-up. ""You always ask me the same thing. If you have the balls to do that, why don't you go into the dressing room and say it to the players,"" an angry Tuchel said in response to one question about the quality of PSG's display against the Germans. ""I am tired of always having to answer to these expectations."" Tuchel's exasperation is partly understandable, given PSG still have qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League in their hands and are two points clear at the top of Ligue 1 despite being plagued by injuries, suspensions and coronavirus infections this season. The run to last season's Champions League final also makes him a difficult man to sack, but he is out of contract after this campaign and any chance of him signing a new deal appears slim. It needed a soft penalty converted by Neymar, and poor finishing from their opponents, for PSG to beat Leipzig, but they face Manchester United at Old Trafford next Wednesday and a defeat there could still leave them staring at a group-stage exit from the Champions League for the first time since the Qatari takeover of 2011. Given the nature of their performances recently, it is not easy to imagine them winning that game, and their domestic displays could even offer a glimmer of hope to the teams below them. The reigning champions lost 3-2 at Monaco last weekend and they are two points above second-placed Lille before hosting mid-table Bordeaux on Saturday. Marco Verratti could get a run-out for Paris after injury with a view to the Italian featuring at Old Trafford, but the likes of Juan Bernat, Idrissa Gana Gueye and Julian Draxler are all still injured. The story goes that as a kid Dia was on his way to a trial at Saint-Etienne when his father's car broke down, while Lyon rejected him for being too small. He seemed to have given up on a football career as he worked as an electrician, while a trial in Wales did not work out. But Dia signed his first professional deal with Reims in 2018 and, having recently turned 24, he has developed into one of the stars of the Ligue 1 season so far. Dia, who was born in France but recently made his international debut for Senegal, has eight goals in nine league games for Reims. All of his goals have come away from home, and on Sunday he goes back to Lyon as a player now very much in the spotlight. 3 - PSG have suffered three defeats in their first 11 Ligue 1 games this season, their most at this stage of a season since the Qatari takeover of 2011 that transformed the club. 50 - Neymar's next Ligue 1 goal will be his 50th. He has so far scored 49 times in 57 Ligue 1 games for PSG. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is currently the quickest PSG player to get to 50, having done so in 59 matches. 13 - Marseille this week set a new record for the most consecutive defeats in the Champions League. Their 2-0 home loss to Porto made it 13 losses in a row stretching over three campaigns."
48,24/11/2020,23:30,Neymar keeps PSG on course in Champions League with Leipzig win,A nervy Paris Saint-Germain were outplayed for long spells but held on after an early Neymar penalty to beat RB Leipzig 1-0 on Tuesday and revive their Champions League campaign.,"Last season's runners-up had lost two of their opening three matches in Group H and would have been staring at an early exit from the competition had they lost again to the Germans behind closed doors at the Parc des Princes. Yet Neymar's 11th-minute spot-kick proved enough for a PSG side struggling with injuries and suspensions, as Leipzig failed to convert any of the chances that came their way. ""We are a team who, in the difficult moments, manage to stick together and do a good job. Once again we proved that,"" captain Marquinhos told RMC Sport. Both PSG and Leipzig are now level on six points with two games still to come, with Manchester United three points clear at the top of the section after easing to a 4-1 victory over Istanbul Basaksehir. Crucially, PSG have the head-to-head advantage over Leipzig, thanks to an away goal, if the two teams end level on points. They lost 2-1 when the teams met in Germany three weeks ago. Thomas Tuchel's team go to Old Trafford next and the feeling is that the French champions could still just as easily advance to the last 16 in first place as they could fail to qualify at all. They brushed Leipzig aside in the semi-finals of last season's competition in Lisbon in August but collapsed worryingly in their last meeting with Julian Nagelsmann's team after taking an early lead. Here they again went in front and then succeeded in seeing the game out despite struggling desperately to maintain possession and stop the waves of Leipzig attacks. ""There are lots of things that happen that people maybe don't know about,"" insisted Marquinhos, with PSG having struggled with injuries, suspensions and coronavirus infections all season. Here they were without as many as six first-team regulars. ""I don't think we had the means to put in an exceptional performance, but the most important thing was the victory."" The decisive spot-kick was awarded when Marcel Sabitzer was rather harshly adjudged to have fouled Angel di Maria. Neymar stepped up to roll the ball home from 12 yards for his first Champions League goal of the season on what was his first start in almost a month after injury. Alongside him, Kylian Mbappe saw his European goal drought go on -- Ligue 1's leading scorer has still not scored a Champions League goal in 2020 in eight appearances. Nevertheless, PSG did not need their French World Cup-winning superstar to be at his best as Leipzig -- who have not managed to replace Timo Werner since the Germany striker left for Chelsea -- were unable to turn their dominance of possession into goals. Dayot Upamecano saw his header tipped over by Keylor Navas and Emil Forsberg turned a Dani Olmo cross over the top in the first half. The pressure continued at the start of the second half, but Forsberg and Sabitzer notably missed the target and the chances dried up after the home side reverted to a three-man central defence in the closing stages."
49,23/11/2020,16:22,Injury-hit PSG look for Mbappe to get back among goals in Champions League,Paris Saint-Germain continue to be plagued by injuries but coach Thomas Tuchel is optimistic the fit-again Kylian Mbappe can make the difference in Tuesday's vital Champions League encounter with RB Leipzig.,"PSG host the German club at the Parc des Princes having lost two of their opening three matches in Group H. Beaten 2-1 in Leipzig three weeks ago, another defeat here could push last season's Champions League runners-up to the brink of elimination in the group stage for the first time since the Qatari takeover of the club in 2011. Mbappe missed the defeat in Germany because of a hamstring injury, but returns here looking to end a run of seven Champions League games without a goal in 2020. Neymar is also expected to start after the world's most expensive player made his return from several weeks on the sidelines as a substitute in Friday's 3-2 defeat by Monaco in Ligue 1. ""If 'Ney' and Kylian don't score then it has a big impact on us. They are decisive boys and I hope he (Mbappe) will be able to score tomorrow,"" said Tuchel when asked about the form of the France striker in Europe. Mbappe is fresh from scoring twice in the 3-2 defeat in Monaco, making him the leading scorer in Ligue 1 with nine goals from just seven appearances and taking him to 99 goals in total for PSG since signing for the club in August 2017. ""We need goals and we need him to put in a big performance, and I get the feeling he is ready. He played for France and then he scored against Monaco, so now is the time for him and 'Ney' to be decisive again,"" added Tuchel. Injuries and suspensions have hampered the French champions ever since the season started and will do so again at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday. Mauro Icardi, Julian Draxler, Idrissa Gana Gueye and Thilo Kehrer are all on the sidelines along with Spanish left-back Juan Bernat, who is recovering from a knee operation and last week told AFP he hoped to be back by ""February, or mid-March"". Midfield duo Marco Verratti and Ander Herrera were on Monday rated as doubtful by PSG. Centre-back Presnel Kimpembe is suspended after being sent off in Leipzig last time out."
50,23/11/2020,14:57,"Phenomenal Haaland, trouble for Barcelona and PSG: European football talking points","Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain look vulnerable after weekend defeats, while Erling Braut Haaland laid down another marker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic keeps on scoring too, and Norwegian club Bodo/Glimt have a record which will take some beating.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: If Barcelona thought keeping Lionel Messi against his will would suffice to make them contenders in La Liga this season, it is not working. The Argentine was a peripheral figure as Ronald Koeman's team produced a mediocre performance and lost 1-0 to Atletico Madrid on Saturday, a result which left them 12th in La Liga, nine points behind Diego Simeone's team in second. They are 12 points behind leaders Real Sociedad, albeit with two games in hand. The Basque club are flying, having equalled a club record of six straight league wins, while Barcelona have won just once, and lost three times, in the same period. Atletico are possibly now the title favourites, unbeaten in 24 league games, and it all points to the Catalans facing a fight just to finish in the top four. All the more so as the injuries are piling up: Against Atletico they saw Gerard Pique go off with a serious knee injury and lost Sergi Roberto to a thigh tear. Both are expected to be out for two months. Erling Braut Haaland keeps on breaking records. On Saturday the Norwegian sensation, aged 20 years and four months, scored four times in the second half in Borussia Dortmund's 5-2 win at Hertha Berlin, becoming the youngest player to net four in one Bundesliga game. Named last week as the winner of the Golden Boy for Europe's best young player, as awarded by Italian sports daily Tuttosport, he has 10 Bundesliga goals for the season and 15 in all competitions. Not to mention six for his country. Haaland's figures have been mindblowing since he burst onto the scene last season with Salzburg, and he has now scored a total of 23 goals in 22 Bundesliga matches following his move to Dortmund in January. That beats the tally of Hamburg legend Uwe Seeler, who scored 20 in his first 22 outings of the first Bundesliga season in 1963/64. Kylian Mbappe, that other young striking phenomenon, has now scored 99 goals for Paris Saint-Germain since signing from Monaco in a 180 million-euro deal ($215m) deal in August 2017. On Friday he grabbed a first-half brace to put PSG 2-0 up away against his old side, but the champions imploded in the second half and ended up losing 3-2, with a late Cesc Fabregas penalty deciding the game. After eight consecutive Ligue 1 wins, PSG's momentum has been stalled and they are now just two points clear of Lille at the top. And their defensive weaknesses may come back to haunt them in a crucial Champions League clash with RB Leipzig this midweek. Presnel Kimpembe is suspended for that match, and Abdou Diallo is in the firing line after his error gifted Monaco the crucial penalty. The jury remains out on last season's Champions League finalists. Will Haaland and Mbappe still be banging in the goals as they approach 40? Zlatan Ibrahimovic is, and AC Milan are on top of Serie A. On Sunday the Swede scored twice before limping off with a thigh strain as the Rossoneri won 3-1 at Napoli to stay two points ahead of Sassuolo at the top, and remain unbeaten. Ibrahimovic is the top scorer in Italy with 10 goals, despite turning 39 last month. Milan coach Stefano Pioli must hope the veteran forward is not missing for too long. The early indications are he will be out for at least 10 days. Milan's other goal-scorer in Naples was Jens Petter Hauge, the winger signed from Bodo/Glimt at the start of the season. Hauge's old club have coped fine since his departure and on Sunday became Norwegian champions for the first time. From the small town of Bodo, just north of the Arctic Circle and a 16-hour drive from Oslo, Bodo/Glimt are the northernmost top-flight champions ever according to sports data experts Gracenote who say they have stolen that particular prize from KA Akureyri, former Icelandic title winners. Bodo/Glimt have won the league with five games to spare and will enter next season's Champions League. bur-as/td <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org>"
51,21/11/2020,00:05,Monaco come back to stun PSG after Mbappe double,Cesc Fabregas scored a late winner from the penalty spot as Monaco came from two goals down to stun reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain 3-2 in Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Kylian Mbappe had netted a first-half brace, including a penalty, against his former side, taking him to 99 goals for PSG and leaving his current team seemingly on course for a ninth consecutive league win. But German international Kevin Volland struck twice for Monaco after the break and Fabregas converted from 12 yards in the 84th minute after Abdou Diallo had been sent off for conceding the all-important penalty. PSG remain clear at the top of Ligue 1, but this result is a major setback for Thomas Tuchel's team before a crucial Champions League tie against RB Leipzig next week. ""I am more surprised than I am angry,"" said Tuchel, who was also disappointed to see further first-half goals for Mbappe and Moise Kean disallowed. ""I saw two totally different halves. First of all we completely controlled the game...and then the second half was completely different. I can only say it is our responsibility."" Niko Kovac's Monaco climb up to second in the table, four points behind PSG, but Lille can reclaim second spot and move to within two points of the leaders if they beat Lorient on Sunday. ""If you come back from two down to win 3-2 it is for sure something special, but I don't want to glorify it too much,"" said ex-Bayern Munich coach Kovac. ""We cannot stop and say everything is done. It was a big victory but nothing more."" PSG have been severely handicapped by injuries and suspensions this season, and Neymar was only deemed fit enough for a place on the bench at kick-off at the Stade Louis II after missing Brazil's World Cup qualifiers over the last week due to fitness problems. Mbappe was back in the starting line-up, however, after missing his club's last two outings prior to the international break with a hamstring injury. Facing his former club, with whom he won the Ligue 1 title in 2017, Mbappe burst through to put Paris in front in the 25th minute after being released by Angel Di Maria. He then found the net again in the 37th minute, converting a penalty awarded for a foul on Rafinha by Youssouf Fofana. His ninth goal of the season leaves him just one away from a century of goals in a PSG shirt since his arrival from Monaco at the start of 2017/18 in a 180 million-euro ($213m) deal. He even had another goal disallowed just before half-time. Without their French international striker Wissam Ben Yedder after he tested positive for coronavirus, it was a long way back for Monaco but they reduced the deficit seven minutes after half-time when Gelson Martins set up Volland to score from close in. Volland then equalised with a tap-in after Fabregas, on as a substitute, had beaten goalkeeper Keylor Navas to a cross. Worse was to come for the visitors, as Diallo -- another former Monaco player -- clumsily conceded a penalty and was shown a red card after the referee opted to review the images. Fabregas made no mistake from the spot, as PSG lost a Ligue 1 game after leading by two goals for just the second time since the Qatari takeover of the club in 2011. Earlier Rennes warmed up for their Champions League rematch with Chelsea in the worst possible fashion, going down to a 1-0 home defeat at the hands of Bordeaux. Hatem Ben Arfa scored the only goal of the game against his old club, as Rennes slip to fifth before entertaining Chelsea in a game they realistically need to win to keep any hopes of reaching the Champions League last 16 alive."
52,20/11/2020,11:29,Neymar back for PSG ahead of Champions League resumption,"Neymar is set to return from injury for Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1 on Friday with a view to facing RB Leipzig in a crucial Champions League match next week, the club said.","The Brazilian, who has been sidelined since injuring a thigh muscle against Turkish club Basaksehir in the Champions League on October 28, came through a training session with the PSG squad without any problems on Thursday. Coach Thomas Tuchel said on Thursday that Neymar could play ""a few minutes"" against Monaco. The injury ruled him out of Brazil's World Cup qualifiers during the international break. PSG, last season's beaten finalists, need to beat Leipzig at home on Tuesday to remain in contention to qualify for the knockout stage. Kylian Mbappe is also back in the PSG squad for the visit to the principality despite being troubled by injuries since the start to the season. Italian pair Marco Verratti and Mauro Icardi are still not ready to return from injury but PSG coach Thomas Tuchel said he was hopeful they would be available for selection against Leipzig. Reigning champions PSG are top of Ligue 1 despite losing two games during a rocky start to the campaign."
53,20/11/2020,03:10,"Huge tests for Real, Barca, a milestone for Flick - what to watch in Europe this weekend","Real Madrid and Barcelona's stuttering starts to the season could continue, while AC Milan's unbeaten record in Serie A is in danger and Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick is aiming to continue his astonishing record.","AFP Sport previews the standout football action on the continent this weekend: Monaco v Paris Saint-Germain, Friday 2000 GMT PSG are five points clear at the top of Ligue 1 and chasing a ninth straight win when they face Monaco, the only other club to have won the title in the past eight seasons. Paris have won 4-1 and 4-0 on their last two visits to the principality but they might find things harder this time, not least because coach Thomas Tuchel is without a host of injured players, while Neymar is a doubt. The game has a German accent to it, with Monaco looking to return to the upper echelons of the French game under new Croatian coach Niko Kovac, who was born and raised in Germany. Ex-Borussia Dortmund boss Tuchel has been full of praise ahead of the game for Kovac, who he came up against when the latter was at Eintracht Frankfurt. Kovac is looking to relaunch his career after being sacked by Bayern Munich. Bayern Munich v Werder Bremen, Saturday 1430 GMT Kovac was replaced in the dugout in Bavaria by Hansi Flick, who went on to win the Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup treble last season and has added the UEFA and German Super Cups this season. On Saturday Flick takes charge of Bayern for the 50th time when they host Werder Bremen. Flick's record is astonishing. He has overseen 45 wins, one draw and just three defeats, with Bayern averaging 3.3 goals a game in the Bundesliga. Bayern sealed the title with a 1-0 win in Bremen in June. Werder only just stayed up last season and lost 6-1 on their last trip to Munich. A similar outcome is quite possible this time. Villarreal v Real Madrid, Saturday 1515 GMT Zinedine Zidane's Real have had two weeks to stew on a 4-1 hammering at Valencia and could find the going tough again this weekend when they make another trip to Spain's east coast to play Villarreal. Unai Emery's side are undefeated in six La Liga games and are second in the table, two points behind leaders Real Sociedad and two above Real, who have a game in hand. While Madrid are without talisman Sergio Ramos after he suffered a hamstring injury playing for Spain, Villarreal have two of Spain's most in-form strikers in Paco Alcacer and Gerard Moreno. The latter has four league goals this season and scored a late equaliser for Spain against Switzerland in the Nations League last weekend, while Alcacer has nine in total. They could make life very difficult for the champions. Atletico Madrid v Barcelona, Saturday 2000 GMT Barcelona claimed a first win in five La Liga games last time out when they thumped Real Betis 5-2, but they are currently eighth in the table, nine points behind Real Sociedad with two matches in hand. On Saturday they visit Atletico, who are six points above Ronald Koeman's side and on a club-record unbeaten run of 23 league matches. Luis Suarez's absence against his former side after a positive coronavirus test is a great shame, as will be the lack of fans, but this match still pits Lionel Messi against Joao Felix, and there is the return of Antoine Griezmann to face his old team. Napoli v AC Milan, Sunday 1945 GMT Milan's revival is real, as they spent the international break on top of Serie A, unbeaten and two points ahead of Sassuolo in second. A huge test awaits, however, as they go to Napoli, who are three points off the lead in third. Napoli have lost their last two home games but look like contenders for a top-four finish this season and the prospect of coach Gennaro Gattuso getting one over the club he served with such distinction as a player is a fascinating one."

The tax office in Spain calculates Neymar benefitted from ""unfair enrichment"", the report added. A Barcelona source confirmed to AFP the club will now seek to reclaim the amount they are owed.

A Spanish court ruled in favour of the club in June and told Neymar to pay 6.79 million euros to Barcelona. Despite their legal disputes, Barca have made several attempts to re-sign Neymar.

56,10/11/2020,13:25,"Neymar, Mbappe PSG contract talks 'have started' - Leonardo",Paris Saint-Germain sporting director Leonardo said on Tuesday contract negotiations with Neymar and Kylian Mbappe are underway.,"The deals of the attacking pair, who cost the French champions 402 million euros ($474 million) in two separate transfers, are up in 2022. Leonardo alo said talks with Angel Di Maria and Juan Bernat are also ongoing. ""All the extensions we're considering, we've started to talk about. I think they'll escalate over the coming weeks,"" the former Brazil midfielder told the club's video channel. He said his relationship with coach Thomas Tuchel has improved since they made their differing opinions about the summer transfer market public during media interviews. The Champions League runners-up have lost two of their opening three group stage matches this term, but Leonardo denied PSG had looked at replacing the German. ""That sort of thing happens, we spoke, the situation is now clear for everyone,"" he said. ""The truth and the facts are that internally we've never thought about changing Tuchel. We've never called anyone,"" he added."
57,08/11/2020,13:41,Di Maria brace in Rennes stroll keeps depleted PSG top,Angel Di Maria scored twice as Paris Saint-Germain made short work of Rennes despite a raft of absences in a 3-0 win on Saturday that enables the champions to hold onto their lead at the top of Ligue 1.,"Di Maria struck in each half, with Moise Kean scoring the other, to move PSG up to 24 points, five ahead of second-placed Lille who take on Brest in Sunday's early fixture. Rennes stay third on 18 points -- but can be overtaken by Nice should they beat Monaco on Sunday -- while Montpellier are a further point back in sixth after their 2-0 win at Bordeaux. PSG's win was their eighth in a row in the French top flight and came as under-fire coach Thomas Tuchel battles with an injury crisis that has left him without the likes of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Marco Verratti. Marquinhos was moved back into the defence following injury to centre-back Presnel Kimpembe, while Pablo Sarabia failed to overcome a muscle strain. However new arrival Kean put the hosts ahead after 10 minutes with his third Ligue 1 goal of the season when he collected Di Maria's pass and lashed a low shot past Alfred Gomis. Di Maria then added the second 10 minutes later when fellow Argentine Leandro Paredes picked him out with a fine through ball and he dinked his finish over Gomis. PSG suffered what looked to be more injury strife when Thilo Kehrer left the field 10 minutes before the end of the first half, before Kean then began limping on the hour mark before being substituted shortly afterwards. The result was never really in doubt however, and Di Maria made absolutely sure of the points in the 73rd minute when his low drive squirmed past the unfortunate Gomis. A thumping win over Rennes is unlikely to improve Tuchel's precarious position at PSG though as last season's Champions League finalists struggle in this year's edition. The 47-year-old German, whose contract is up at the end of this season, is in a sticky position after PSG lost 2-1 at RB Leipzig on Wednesday to leave them with two defeats out of three in the competition's group stage. It has become an open secret that Tuchel does not get on with Leonardo, PSG's powerful sporting director, who did not hire the German and wants to bring in his own man."
58,06/11/2020,17:31,Kimpembe and Navas join growing PSG injury list,"Goalkeeper Keylor Navas and centre-back Presnel Kimpembe joined Paris Saint-Germain's lengthening injury list on Friday, adding to the absences of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Marco Verratti.","Head coach Thomas Tuchel revealed on Friday that Navas and Kimpembe will miss Saturday's match against third-placed Rennes at the Parc de Princes. Navas has struggled with ongoing ""muscle problems"" as the result of the busy fixture calendar and Kimpembe suffered a foot injury, Tuchel said. Kimpembe was named in Didier Deschamps' France squad for the upcoming international fixtures and the 25-year-old is due to join up with the national squad on Monday. Elsewhere for PSG, Pablo Sarabia's fitness is touch-and-go as the winger battles a muscle strain. The Spaniard has picked up two goals and four assists in his last four league games for the side. Leandro Paredes, who was an unused sub for Wednesday's Champions League 2-1 defeat to RB Leipzig, is available for selection after two weeks out."
59,06/11/2020,02:30,Will Tuchel's time soon be up at PSG?,Thomas Tuchel left Borussia Dortmund on bad terms in 2017 and there is a growing feeling that his relationship with Paris Saint-Germain could be heading for a messy divorce too.,"The 47-year-old German, whose contract is up at the end of this season, is in a sticky position after PSG lost 2-1 at RB Leipzig on Wednesday to leave them with two defeats out of three in the Champions League group stage. They had not lost more than one group game in any of the eight previous seasons in the Champions League, a run that started soon after the takeover of the club by Qatar Sports Investments and the transformation that came with it. And while Tuchel has led PSG back to the top of Ligue 1 with seven straight wins since they began the campaign with back-to-back defeats, it is in Europe where he is primarily judged. Even before the Leipzig game, he raised eyebrows by suggesting in an interview with Sky Germany that he was unlikely to sign a new contract. ""When a coach goes into the final year of his contract and no discussions have taken place after what we have achieved, we can be open to all possibilities,"" Tuchel said. ""But one must not dream either. We will see."" He refused to expand on those comments after the Leipzig loss, but it has become an open secret that Tuchel does not see eye to eye with Leonardo, PSG's powerful sporting director. Tuchel was not appointed by Leonardo and there is a sense the Brazilian wants to bring in his own man, despite the current coach having taken Paris to their first ever Champions League final last season on the back of a clean sweep of domestic trophies. ""For a while I had this naive idea that after winning four titles...and getting to the Champions League final, that the coach would not be in the firing line for a while,"" added Tuchel, who can be a prickly character. And so, less than three months on from that final against Bayern Munich in Lisbon, Tuchel could even become the first PSG coach to leave mid-season since Antoine Kombouare was replaced by Carlo Ancelotti in December 2011. This after he was sacked by Dortmund in 2017 having fallen out with the club's CEO, Hans-Joachim Watzke, despite winning the German Cup only a few days earlier. For now a win at home to third-place Rennes on Saturday would take some of the focus off the coach and move PSG six points clear of their opponents. Neymar and Kylian Mbappe are on the sidelines, though, along with a host of other key players. Ben Yedder's tally of six Ligue 1 goals has been bettered only by Mbappe (7) so far. That is after he finished level with Mbappe on 18 goals at the top of the scorers chart in the last, curtailed campaign. The 30-year-old has just been called up to the latest France squad for matches this month and is set to add to his 10 caps. Before that the ex-Sevilla player will be the main threat for Monaco in the Cote d'Azur derby against Nice, who are without defensive talisman Dante after he suffered a serious knee injury. 4 - The number of points, out of a possible 27, collected by France's three representatives -- PSG, Marseille and Rennes -- halfway through this season's Champions League group stage. The sole win so far came for PSG against Istanbul Basaksehir. 3 - PSG have lost just six home league games in the last eight years, but three of those defeats have come against Rennes. 56 - Neymar has featured in exactly half of the 112 Ligue 1 games PSG have played since signing the Brazilian in 2017. He is again sidelined this weekend."

""It's definitely not the worst time to face them, but we also have several injured players."" Mbappe was been ruled out of the Group H clash with a hamstring injury, while PSG were already missing Brazil forward Neymar, who has a thigh strain, and Mauro Icardi. The match in Germany is a rematch of last season's Champions League semi-final when PSG won 3-0 in Lisbon with Neymar and Mbappe in their ranks. Leipzig, who sit third in the group, are eager to bounce back from their 5-0 hammering at Manchester United last week. PSG are second in the section but level on three points with the Bundesliga club. ""With these two players (Neymar and Mbappe), PSG would be a bit stronger, but we also are missing players,"" said Nagelsmann, who must do without midfielders Lukas Klostermann and Konrad Laimer due to knee injuries. ""After the defeat in Manchester, fatigue was noticeable - it's hard to come home without a point, but that's part of the job. ""Defeats are hard to digest, we like to win, but we'll probably come out of them stronger if we learn the right lessons and learn them quickly."""
61,03/11/2020,10:47,Blow for PSG as injured Mbappe to miss Leipzig clash,Paris Saint-Germain announced on Tuesday that Kylian Mbappe has suffered a hamstring injury and will miss their Champions League game at RB Leipzig.,"The French World Cup -winning forward's last-minute defection is a significant blow for PSG with Neymar and Mauro Icardi already ruled out of Wednesday's game in Germany. Thomas Tuchel's side take on Leipzig playing catch-up in Group H after losing to Manchester United in their opening game. Mbappe scored a penalty in the league win over Nantes on Saturday before being withdrawn and heading straight down the tunnel clutching his right hamstring. At the time Tuchel was unconcerned about the 21-year-old's fitness for the Leipzig game. ""It is just fatigue. It's not an injury,"" the PSG manager said after the 3-0 win. But medical tests have subsequently confirmed that the player is suffering ""a right hamstring muscle problem"", PSG said. Wednesday's game is a rematch of August's Champions League semi-final in Lisbon which PSG won 3-0 before losing to Bayern Munich in the final."
62,31/10/2020,23:22,Mbappe on target as PSG win without injured Neymar,"Kylian Mbappe scored from the penalty spot as Paris Saint-Germain eased to their seventh straight Ligue 1 win on Saturday, beating Nantes 3-0 away to move provisionally three points clear at the top of the table.","All the goals came in the second half at the Stade de la Beaujoire, with Ander Herrera opening the scoring two minutes after the restart and Mbappe converting a 65th-minute spot-kick before Pablo Sarabia secured the points late on. PSG have now taken maximum points since starting the season with back-to-back defeats and the reigning champions are three clear of Lille and Rennes at the summit. Lille, who are unbeaten, can rejoin the club from the capital at the top if they win at home to Lyon on Sunday. Rennes beat Brest 2-1 earlier on Saturday. Paris coach Thomas Tuchel made six changes to his line-up following the 2-0 midweek win at Istanbul Basaksehir in the Champions League, with Neymar one of those missing after suffering an adductor injury that is expected to keep him out until the upcoming international break. However Nantes, whose game at Lens last weekend was called off following a coronavirus outbreak in their opponents' squad, were missing an entire back four here, including three to Covid-19. Sarabia hit the post early on for the visitors in this game, which was played behind closed doors after France returned to a full national lockdown in an attempt to stem a surge in coronavirus cases. Nigerian winger Moses Simon then missed an open goal for Nantes, somehow failing to turn in a Randal Kolo Muani assist. Kolo Muani then curled a shot agonisingly wide after a Herrera slip had let Nantes in, and PSG lost Moise Kean -- scorer of four goals in the previous two games -- to injury at the break. Nevertheless the league leaders got the breakthrough at the start of the second half when Mbappe picked out the former Manchester United midfielder Herrera to fire home. Mbappe, who moved from the left wing to a more central role in the second half, then benefited from a very soft penalty award when he went down under pressure from Jean-Charles Castelletto. The World Cup winner stroked home the penalty for his seventh league goal of the season, all of which have come in the last six matches. He was then withdrawn and headed straight down the tunnel clutching his right hamstring, giving Tuchel potentially another injury headache ahead of Wednesday's key Champions League clash with RB Leipzig in Germany. Just before he went off, Nantes won a penalty of their own when Colin Dagba fouled Marcus Coco in the box, but Abdoul Kader Bamba's effort from 12 yards was saved by Keylor Navas. PSG have conceded just one goal in their seven-game winning run, while Sarabia chipped in after pouncing on Imran Louza's back-pass to make it 23 goals scored in that time. Earlier Rennes got back on track by coming from behind to beat Brest 2-1 as they prepare to go to Chelsea in the Champions League in midweek. Defensive duo Damien Da Silva and Nayef Aguerd got the goals for Rennes after Franck Honorat had given the visitors the lead at Roazhon Park in a Brittany derby. A third-place finish in the last, curtailed French season allowed Rennes to qualify for the Champions League for the first time, but they have taken just one point from their first two group games, a 1-1 draw at home to Russians Krasnodar being followed by a 1-0 loss away to Sevilla in midweek. They face Chelsea in London on Wednesday, a game which will be missed by teenage French international midfielder Eduardo Camavinga, who is injured and also played no part against Brest."
63,29/10/2020,21:46,Thigh injury could sideline Neymar until international break,"Neymar will miss three Paris Saint-Germain matches after injuring a thigh muscle against Basaksehir in the Champions League, a French radio network reported on its website on Thursday.","Neymar came off after 25 minutes in Istanbul on Wednesday. PSG went on to win 2-0. ""The Brazilian, who had tried to play on before asking to be substituted, underwent an MRI scan that revealed a tear to the adductor,"" the RMC Sport website said. PSG's next three games are a Ligue 1 match in Nantes on Saturday, followed by home games against RB Leipzig in the Champions League on Wednesday and Rennes in Ligue 1 on November 7. That game is followed by an international break when Brazil are due to face Venezuela and Uruguay in World Cup qualifying. ""No indication has yet been given of his participation in the Brazilian national team's gathering,"" RMC Sport said. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel was already dealing with a full infirmary, with Marco Verratti, Mauro Icardi, Leandro Paredes, Julian Draxler and Juan Bernat all hurt. After missing the start of the season due to Covid-19 and then two more games following his red card against Marseille, Neymar has scored twice and had four assists this season."
64,28/10/2020,22:26,PSG win in Turkey with Kean brace as Neymar goes off injured,Moise Kean's second-half double gave Paris Saint-Germain a 2-0 win away to Istanbul Basaksehir in Turkey on Wednesday as the French side got their Champions League campaign up and running but lost Neymar to injury.,"The world's most expensive player limped out of the action before the half-hour mark and went straight down the tunnel to join an already lengthy queue to the PSG treatment room. He was replaced by Pablo Sarabia, but without the Brazilian the visitors ground out the victory after the break in a game that mercifully passed without incident despite the backdrop of ongoing diplomatic tensions between Turkey and France. ""It's his adductor muscle, but I hope it's not a real injury. He didn't feel good or free and that is why he came off,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel of Neymar. Nevertheless, the result allows PSG, last season's beaten finalists, to get off the mark in Group H, a week after they started with a 2-1 home defeat at the hands of Manchester United. ""We have lots of injuries, and maybe now is the time for us to fight, to try to win matches that might not be the greatest matches in the history of PSG,"" added Tuchel. ""Maybe we can do better, but it's difficult at the moment."" Kean, who is on loan from Everton, had already opened his PSG account with a brace against Dijon in Ligue 1 last weekend and the Italian forward put Tuchel's team in front in the 64th minute behind closed doors at the Fatih Terim Stadium. Kylian Mbappe played the role of provider with a corner from the left that was headed home from six yards by the unmarked Kean. Beaten 2-0 away by RB Leipzig on their Champions League debut after winning a first Turkish title last season, Basaksehir had come close to taking the lead in the first half. Their skipper, the Bosnian international Edin Visca, twice narrowly missed the target from range, while PSG goalkeeper Keylor Navas made a key save to deny Deniz Turuc shortly after Kean's opener. The French giants had also seen Sarabia shoot over to squander a glorious chance at the start of the second half, but Kean's opener calmed any nerves and he made it 2-0 with 11 minutes remaining. This time a miscontrol by Mbappe fell kindly to Kean, who controlled and turned before firing past Mert Gunok to make sure of the points."
65,27/10/2020,03:11,'FC Erdogan' -- Turkish title-winners aiming to unsettle Champions League elite,Newcomers Istanbul Basaksehir face a tough baptism in the Champions League after shaking up the Turkish football hierarchy and earning a reputation as the plaything of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.,"Basaksehir earned their place in Europe's elite club competition by pipping Turkey's traditional giants to win the title for the first time. They could scarcely have asked for a harder draw as a reward. They host Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday after losing 2-0 to RB Leipzig last week. After that they play Manchester United home and away. A win against PSG, last season's runners-up, would be symbolic beyond the pitch at a time when Ankara and Paris are locked in a diplomatic stand-off over Islam and freedom of speech. Basaksehir's title triumph was coming after they finished second in 2017 and 2019. Yet their rise has been remarkable. The achievement stands out given the traditional dominance of Turkey's Super Lig by Istanbul's big three of Fenerbahce, Galatasaray and Besiktas. Between them, that trio had won all bar one of the previous 35 titles, with the exception being Bursaspor in 2010. For their detractors, Basaksehir owe their success to the support of the government and the financial clout of companies close to the ruling Islamist-rooted AKP party of President Erdogan. The close relationship between the club and the Turkish leader is such that rival supporters have labelled Basaksehir ""FC Erdogan"". Created in the 1990s by the municipality of Istanbul, the club was sold in 2014 to a consortium of businessmen reputedly close to Erdogan. The club's main backer is Medipol, a group of private hospitals run by Turkey's health minister. The club is based in the district of Basaksehir in the European part of Istanbul, far from the heart of the sprawling city. The modern high-rise suburb is seen by Erdogan as a showcase for the conservative ""new Turkey"" that he has promoted. Following the 2014 takeover a 17,000-capacity stadium was built, named after the legendary former player and manager Fatih Terim, who ironically manages Galatasaray. Erdogan blessed the club's new look when in July 2014 he donned Basaksehir colours to play in a charity game at the new stadium and scored an improbable three goals in 15 minutes. In a country where football, business and political power are intricately linked, the creation of the modern Basaksehir, a year after the widespread ""Gezi Park"" anti-government protests in which ""ultra"" supporters of different Istanbul clubs played a key role, had clear political undertones. ""During the Gezi Park protests, they (the government) could see the political power of the supporters. Basaksehir is a project aimed at creating a club under their control,"" said one Besiktas ultra who wished to remain anonymous for fear of losing his job in the civil service. But beyond their links to power, Basaksehir owe their success to a strict economic model which is in stark contrast to the country's traditional giants whose elected presidents are compelled to spend, sometimes recklessly, to satisfy demanding supporters. ""The major Istanbul clubs are in financial ruin after being run into the ground by presidents and boards who come, leave and rarely put anything back into the club,"" says Emre Sarigul, co-founder of the website Turkish Football. ""The old system is broken. Basaksehir are run in what can be described as a more modern, corporate-minded, accountable system and it is no surprise they are doing so well. ""They are perhaps the only professionally-run club in the top tier with a long-term strategy."" Huseyin Avcilar, who co-runs the supporters group Basaksehir 1453, says their success can also be put down to ""a tailor-made transfer policy"". While Fenerbahce, Galatasaray and Besiktas have splashed the cash to sign foreign stars who are past their peak, Basaksehir's squad is a mix of local talent, like Irfan Can Kahveci, and unearthed treasures like the Bosnian Edin Visca. There are some foreign veterans, though, with the Brazilian ex-Manchester United full-back Rafael recently arriving from Lyon to join Demba Ba and Nacer Chadli. Yet it would be a stretch to call Basaksehir the fourth giant of Istanbul. Before coronavirus restrictions, their stadium was rarely more than a quarter-full. After winning the league in July, the team paraded through Basaksehir, but the streets were deserted. ""It will take a huge effort for Basaksehir to build a football culture and become accepted as a genuine rival to the big three,"" says Sarigul. ""It would take at least a generation to build up any sort of support."""
66,24/10/2020,23:49,"Kean, Mbappe send PSG top after Lens game called off due to Covid outbreak","Moise Kean and Kylian Mbappe both scored twice as Paris Saint-Germain beat Dijon 4-0 on Saturday to go top of Ligue 1, while the match between Lens and Nantes was postponed after 11 members of the home squad tested positive for coronavirus.","Kean started at the Parc des Princes and scored a first-half brace, his first goals since moving to PSG on loan from Everton. Mbappe then replaced the Italy international in the latter stages and added a late double of his own as Thomas Tuchel's team -- for whom Neymar was outstanding -- bounced back from their midweek Champions League loss to Manchester United and made it six consecutive Ligue 1 victories. The result allowed PSG to go top of the table, a point clear of Lille, although the northerners can reclaim first place by beating Nice on Sunday. ""The most important thing was to get back to winning ways at home,"" captain Marquinhos told Canal+. ""We know this season is not going to be easy. We are going to have lots of matches, we rotated the team here but we were still competitive on the field."" The reigning champions were missing nine players due to injury or suspension, including Angel di Maria and Marco Verratti, while Mbappe was rested at kick-off ahead of a trip to Turkey to play Istanbul Basaksehir on Wednesday. In a game played behind closed doors in the French capital because of the health crisis, Kean came in and converted a Mitchel Bakker cross to open the scoring in the third minute. Neymar then headed against the post before setting up Kean's second goal midway through the first half. Released on the counter-attack by Julian Draxler, Neymar ran half the length of the field with the ball before leaving Kean with an easy finish. PSG lost Draxler to injury in the second half before Mbappe replaced Kean and ran onto a Neymar pass to make it 3-0 eight minutes from time. In the 88th minute Neymar produced a lovely pass to pick out Pablo Sarabia, who teed up Mbappe to seal the win. Marseille won 1-0 at Lorient earlier with a second-half goal from Argentine defender Leonardo Balerdi moving them up to fourth just behind Rennes, who lost 2-1 to Angers on Friday. Andre Villas-Boas's side host Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday. Lens' home clash with Nantes scheduled for Sunday was called off after they lost the equivalent of a whole team to positive coronavirus tests. In a statement, the French league (LFP) said that ""noting the certain absence of 11 Lens players from a list of 30 because of positive RT-PCR tests...it has decided to postpone the game between Lens and Nantes scheduled for Sunday to a later date"". Lens did not confirm the identity of the players concerned, but local newspaper La Voix du Nord reported that two staff members, including coach Franck Haise, were also positive. ""The health situation takes priority but this changes a lot of things for the league itself,"" said the Nantes coach, Christian Gourcuff, whose squad had already travelled to Lens. ""I think that what we have experienced is going to happen again."" It is not the first time this season a Ligue 1 game has been postponed due to Covid-19. Marseille's meeting with Bordeaux on the opening night of the campaign in August was rescheduled for the same reason. After that, and fearing an avalanche of postponements, the LFP relaxed its health protocol to ensure games could go ahead as long as at least 20 players from a list of 30 on each team tested negative. The Ligue 2 game between Grenoble and Nancy scheduled for Saturday was also postponed after 13 Grenoble players tested positive along with five staff members. Lens and its surrounding region, in far northern France, are currently under a nighttime curfew along with much of the country as part of efforts to reduce the spread of the virus. France has recorded more than one million cases and close to 35,000 deaths from Covid-19."
67,24/10/2020,13:34,Another PSG player tests positive for coronavirus,An unnamed Paris Saint-Germain player has tested positive for Covid-19 and will miss the club's Ligue 1 match against Dijon on Saturday.,"PSG were badly hit by the virus at the start of the current season, when Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, Angel Di Maria and Leandro Paredes all had to self-isolate after a holiday to Ibiza following the team's Champions League final loss to Bayern Munich. The player would also likely miss Wednesday's Champions League game at Istanbul Basaksehir. Thomas Tuchel's men lost their opening group match at home to Manchester United earlier this week."
68,23/10/2020,03:50,French clubs seek solace amid poor Champions League form and Mediapro dispute,"Just two months after Paris Saint-Germain's run to the final of the Champions League in Lisbon, and Lyon's appearance in the semi-finals, a miserable midweek for Ligue 1 clubs in Europe's elite competition offered no relief at a time when French football is in crisis off the field.","PSG lost 2-1 at home to Manchester United after Marcus Rashford popped up with a late winner for the visitors, and Marseille conceded even later to lose 1-0 at Olympiakos. It was left to Rennes to salvage some pride, but a 1-1 draw with Russian novices Krasnodar still leaves them up against it. On the pitch, Ligue 1 remains the poor relation among Europe's ""Big Five"" leagues, and the outlook is not being helped by the economic crisis and a worrying dispute with the game's chief domestic TV rights holder. Chinese-owned Spanish firm Mediapro did not meet a scheduled 172 million-euro ($203m) payment due this month and is now trying to renegotiate the record deal it agreed for four seasons starting this year, citing the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Mediapro won the rights after agreeing to pay over 800 million euros per season, out of a total deal worth a record 1.15 billion euros annually. Clubs now face an uncertain future, just as they are being starved of gate revenue due to restrictions on gatherings as a result of the pandemic. The French league (LFP) has taken out a loan of 112 million euros to tide over clubs in the short term, but it is unclear what happens next with Mediapro CEO Jaume Roures saying the company intends to honour the full term of their deal while also indicating the next scheduled payment may not be forthcoming either. ""If there were no TV rights it would be catastrophic for everyone,"" admitted Montpellier president Laurent Nicollin. Meanwhile, interested observers elsewhere believe French clubs will have no choice but to renegotiate the deal. ""There was no pandemic when Mediapro offered the money they did. Nobody knew there was going to be a pandemic and that all the bars would close, that the season would start later than planned,"" LaLiga president Javier Tebas told AFP. ""The conditions were no longer the same so this is all normal. We have also negotiated with many operators."" The France superstar endured a difficult night in PSG's loss to Manchester United and has now gone six games without scoring in the Champions League. It is a worrying run for a player who had previously been so prolific both with his current club and Monaco, and it is notable that Rashford has now scored as many Champions League goals in Paris since the start of 2018/19 as Mbappe. Perhaps he was tired after starting twice and playing another 45 minutes as a substitute for France during the recent international break, and it will be interesting to see if PSG coach Thomas Tuchel starts him on Saturday against Dijon or gives him a rest ahead of the Champions League trip to Istanbul Basaksehir. 1 - France's three representatives collected a solitary point between them in the Champions League in midweek. 24 - PSG have scored 24 goals without reply in their six previous home meetings with Dijon in league and cup. They notably won 8-0 in January 2018. 6 - Lille went top of Ligue 1 last weekend for the first time in six years. They have their best record seven games into a season since 1952."
69,21/10/2020,11:52,Rashford and Solskjaer give Man Utd lift-off and leave PSG out of sorts,"Manchester United were in disarray just a couple of weeks ago, but it was Paris Saint-Germain who were a mess as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side won 2-1 in their Champions League clash in the French capital on Tuesday night.","Solskjaer owed his permanent appointment as United boss to Marcus Rashford's injury-time penalty which gave them a stunning victory over PSG in the last 16 in March 2019. On Tuesday, the same player scored another late goal to give the Norwegian another boost. Barely two weeks after a miserable 6-1 home drubbing by Tottenham Hotspur which matched their worst Premier League defeat, things are looking up for the Old Trafford outfit. They got back on track in a 4-1 victory at Newcastle United last weekend before travelling to France and giving their Champions League campaign the best possible start. Solskjaer was without skipper Harry Maguire at the Parc des Princes. He once again left Paul Pogba on the bench, just as he had against the Magpies. Instead, Solskjaer's back three featured 22-year-old Axel Tuanzebe,starting for the first time in 10 months. There was also a debut at left wing-back for new signing Alex Telles. The United midfield and attack were full of outstanding displays, from Scott McTominay and Fred protecting the defence to Rashford and Anthony Martial up front. Stand-in captain Bruno Fernandes held his nerve to score a retaken penalty after missing the initial effort, having also failed from the spot at Newcastle. ""They really focused on the job, took on board what we wanted and I think we deserved to win,"" Solskjaer said of his side. After a poor start in the Premier League, United have reason to be optimistic heading into a daunting run of fixtures. They host Chelsea and Arsenal in their next two league outings, either side of a visit by RB Leipzig to Old Trafford in the Champions League. Trips to Istanbul Basaksehir and high-flying Everton await in early November, but Solskjaer's team have something to build on. ""The concentration and intensity we showed today, we have to take forward in the next games in the Premier League,"" Rashford told BT Sport. United also have players to come back, and new faces to integrate, including Edinson Cavani, who missed Tuesday's meeting with his former side. The Uruguayan striker was not the only star of PSG's recent past absent, as last season's runners-up looked a pale imitation of their old selves. ""Unrecognisable"" was the headline on the front of sports daily L'Equipe as PSG struggled, just two months on from their narrow defeat by Bayern Munich in the final. Cavani has gone and so has captain Thiago Silva, while Marquinhos and Marco Verratti were missed on Tuesday too. Without those cornerstones of the PSG side over much of the last decade, and without fans at an empty Parc des Princes, Thomas Tuchel's team got what they deserved. They were not helped by disappointing displays from Neymar and Kylian Mbappe -- the Brazilian was booked for dissent while Mbappe has now scored as many Champions League goals in Paris since the start of 2018/19 as Rashford. ""We were not ourselves. But now is not the time to be angry or lose our heads,"" said Tuchel. ""It was a very difficult start."" The coach recently complained that PSG would have no chance of winning the Champions League without strengthening. Danilo Pereira, Moise Kean and Rafinha were subsequently signed before the transfer deadline, but only Danilo started against United and the Portuguese international was left for dead by Rashford at the winning goal. Ominously, no team has gone on to win the Champions League after losing their opening match."

""We have a bit of bad luck with players,"" said Tuchel at a press conference Thursday. ""Mauro Icardi was injured Wednesday last week, an internal ligament of the knee. It is not too serious but he has not done any training and he will be missing against Nimes and of course against Manchester (United)."" Questions remain over several others in the PSG ranks who have been touched by the coronavirus. Former Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera tested positive and is in solitary confinement while new signing Danilo Pereira is a ""contact case"", having been in the Portuguese squad alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, who has tested positive, and will miss the match against Nimes."
71,14/10/2020,22:02,PSG-Man United Champions League clash to go ahead behind closed doors as curfew imposed in Paris,"Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League opener against Manchester United next Tuesday will go ahead, but without spectators, despite the French government introducing a nighttime curfew in the capital, the country's sports ministry told AFP.","""Exemptions will be possible, with or without spectators depending on the time,"" the ministry said on Wednesday when asked about sporting events going ahead after President Emmanuel Macron earlier announced the curfew. Residents in Paris and its surrounding Ile-de-France region, along with eight other French cities, will not be allowed to be outdoors between 9:00 pm (1900 GMT) and 6:00 am (0400 GMT) from Saturday, for a duration of at least four weeks, except for essential reasons. The measures were announced in response to Covid-19 infection rates reaching record levels. The curfew will therefore not stop the Champions League game at the Parc des Princes from going ahead, but will ensure that it does so behind closed doors. Recent sporting events in and around Paris have seen crowds of up to 1,000 permitted to attend."
72,08/10/2020,19:59,Brazil to give Neymar time to recover for Bolivia clash,Brazil said on Thursday they will give star forward Neymar as much time as possible to recover from a back injury so he can face Bolivia in a World Cup qualifier.,"The Copa America champions start their bid to qualify for Qatar 2022 on Friday in Sao Paulo but could be without the Paris Saint-Germain striker. ""It's a health problem that's not entirely resolved,"" said coach Tite. The 28-year-old's back injury flared up before training on Wednesday. ""He's a little bit better today than yesterday,"" said team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar. ""We'll see tomorrow how he responds."" Should Neymar be forced to miss the match, Tite said he would be replaced by Flamengo's attacking midfielder Everton Ribeiro. Neymar's injury travails kept him out of most of Brazil's matches last year. He played in only four out of 16 games and was injured in two of those -- against Qatar in June and Nigeria in October. The injury against Qatar forced him to miss the Copa America that Brazil won on home soil. Tite said Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro would captain the side with Aston Villa's Douglas Luiz lining up alongside him in midfield."

Pereira made 202 appearances for Porto, scoring 19 goals and winning the Portuguese league twice (2018 and 2020), the Portuguese Supercup (2018) and the League Cup (2020). ""It's a new challenge for me, and to be part of Paris Saint-Germain fits my ambitions,"" Pereira said. ""Joining one of the biggest clubs in Europe and in the world is a huge moment in my career, and I hope to be able to bring a lot to Paris and its supporters."""
74,03/10/2020,12:36,Leonardo hits back at Tuchel and says PSG have a 'huge team',"Paris Saint-Germain had no difficulties seeing off Angers in the opening game of the Ligue 1 weekend, but remarks by sporting director Leonardo after the 6-1 victory exposed smouldering problems within the club.","After the game on Friday night, in which Neymar, who scored twice, and Kylian Mbappe, who struck once, showed that the club's stars can deliver, Leonardo spoke to journalists at the Parc des Princes and responded sharply to coach Thomas Tuchel's criticism the day before of the club's transfer activity. Leonardo said that neither he nor the club ""appreciated"" Tuchel's assertion that the PSG squad had been weakened since they reached the Champions League final in August. ""If someone is not happy, if he decides to stay, he must respect either the sports policy or the internal rules,"" Leonardo said. ""You have to understand the moment we are all living through, these are very serious situations. Not understanding this situation, we didn't like it. Now we're going to address it internally."" Tuchel complained on Thursday that the club had not done enough ahead of what promises to be an unusually demanding and compressed season. Leonardo responded that the problems created by the coronavirus extended beyond the playing field. ""Everybody has lost millions, it's weird to talk about it. Nobody is buying , except in England, which is a world apart"", said Leonardo adding that the health crisis had cost PSG almost 100 million euros. It was the first time that Leonardo has publicly criticised the coach, who he inherited when he took over in July 2019. PSG won every domestic trophy available in France last season before losing narrowly to Bayern Munich in August's Champions League final in Lisbon. However, since the end of last season their captain Thiago Silva, all-time top scorer Edinson Cavani, right-back Thomas Meunier, striker Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and defensive starlet Tanguy Kouassi have left. Apart from making Mauro Icardi's loan move from Inter Milan into a permanent transfer, the only new arrivals are right-back Alessandro Florenzi, on loan from Roma, and third-choice goalkeeper Alexandre Letellier. Tuchel said he wanted new signings. ""If we stay like this we can't speak about having the same objectives,"" the German said. ""Perhaps we can do it but we can't ask for the same things from such a reduced squad when we will have to fight with teams like Manchester City, Liverpool and Atletico Madrid, who have all been very strong in the transfer market. ""In a season like this, with players who will be playing a lot for their national teams, with the coronavirus, without a pre-season, with a schedule like we have, I am worried that we will pay the price in October, November, December and January."" Leonardo said that Tuchel had to be prepared to work with the talent he had. ""I also didn't like him saying that this team is weak. We're talking about a huge team,"" the Brazilian said. ""It's not a question of the transfer window, but of form. To stay at this club, you have to be happy, with the desire to suffer for the club, the spirit of sacrifice, even if you're going through a tough moment. If you can sign players, fine. If not, we'll keep going. That's the spirit we're looking for."" ""We'll try to be creative. I don't know how it's going to end. A lot of things can happen, like nothing. We are living in such a difficult time. This is not the time to buy."" The disagreement promises three tense days before the transfer window closes on Monday evening."
75,02/10/2020,23:30,Neymar bags brace as PSG hit six,Neymar scored twice for Paris Saint-Germain in a crushing 6-1 win over Angers on Friday as the French champions continue to build up momentum following a poor start to the Ligue 1 season.,"Alessandro Florenzi, Julian Draxler, Idrissa Gana Gueye and Kylian Mbappe were also on target at the Parc des Princes for PSG, who claimed their fourth consecutive victory after starting the campaign with two straight defeats. Thomas Tuchel's side move up to second in the early table, a point behind leaders Rennes who play Reims on Sunday. There were only 1,000 spectators allowed into the Parc des Princes as authorities clamp down on gatherings amid a new rise in coronavirus cases in the French capital, but the few who were there saw Florenzi open the scoring with a lovely goal in the seventh minute. The Italian right-back, who remains PSG's only new face for this season so far after joining on loan from Roma, controlled the ball in the box before netting with a delightful volley into the far corner. Mbappe then cut the ball back for Neymar to score in off the underside of the bar as PSG doubled their lead before half-time. Neymar was starting after avoiding punishment following allegations of racist and homophobic abuse in an ill-tempered defeat by Marseille last month. The French league's disciplinary committee ruled on Wednesday that it did not have sufficient proof to take action against the Brazilian or Marseille defender Alvaro Gonzalez, who Neymar had accused of calling him a ""monkey"". The world's most expensive player scored his second and PSG's third goal on the night just after half-time, finishing first-time as the ball broke to him in the box. The goals were his first two of the new season after a start to the campaign disrupted by a positive Covid-19 test and suspension. Ismael Traore soon pulled one back for Angers with a back-post header, but Mitchel Bakker crossed for Draxler to make it 4-1 and Gueye added another with a deflected strike. Mbappe completed the scoring by converting from a Pablo Sarabia assist six minutes from the end, and PSG look to have definitively put their defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League final in August behind them. Coach Tuchel will now hope to see more new faces arrive before Monday's transfer deadline, with a busy schedule lying in store once the Champions League group stage begins later in October. Paris will start their continental campaign at home to Manchester United on October 20."

Between them they have won 11 of the last 12 Ballons d'Or. The two heavyweights were drawn in Group G along with Dynamo Kiev of Ukraine and Ferencvaros, the Hungarian club returning to the group stage for the first time in quarter of a century. ""The match against Barcelona will be a great challenge and it will be fascinating because it confronts those who, in my opinion, are still the two best players in the world,"" said Juventus vice president Pavel Nedved. Meanwhile, beaten 2020 finalists Paris Saint-Germain will have a chance for revenge against Manchester United, who ousted the French club in the last 16 two seasons ago. PSG will also come up against RB Leipzig in Group H. The sides met in last season's semi-finals in Lisbon in August, with Paris winning 3-0 before losing to Bayern Munich in their first ever final appearance. Completing the group is Istanbul Basaksehir, who are appearing in the tournament proper for the first time. English Premier League champions Liverpool, who won the Champions League in 2019, will face Ajax as well as Atalanta and Midtjylland of Denmark in Group D. Holders Bayern will take on Atletico Madrid and will also have a short trip across the border to Austria to take on Salzburg in Group A. Lokomotiv Moscow are other team in the section. ""The pressure is on you straight away in the Champions League when you are the holders,"" pointed out Bayern's Thomas Mueller. Manchester City will face Porto, Marseille and Olympiakos in Group C as they continue their hunt for a first European Cup. Other notable match-ups will see 13-time European champions Real Madrid meet Inter Milan in Group B and Chelsea come up against debutants Rennes as well as Europa League winners Sevilla in Group E. Chelsea signed goalkeeper Edouard Mendy from Rennes last week. The group stage starts on October 20, and all six rounds of games will be crammed into eight weeks in a schedule that is even more packed than usual because of the coronavirus pandemic. UEFA will release the fixture schedule on Friday, when the draw for the Europa League also takes place. This season's final is scheduled to be staged on May 29 in Istanbul, which was initially the host for last season's final before UEFA was forced into a change of plans because of the health crisis. UEFA has said that teams playing in the Champions League and Europa League will be able to open stadiums to up to 30 percent capacity, subject to the approval of local authorities. Away fans will not be allowed ""until further notice"", but the announcement that limited crowds can return will be welcomed after last season's Champions League and Europa League were both completed behind closed doors."

PSG won every domestic trophy available in France last season before going on to reach the Champions League final for the first time, losing narrowly to Bayern Munich in Lisbon in August.

Apart from making Mauro Icardi's loan move from Inter Milan into a permanent transfer, the only new arrival is right-back Alessandro Florenzi, recruited on loan from Roma. Tuchel said: ""If we stay like this we can't speak about having the same objectives.

""In a season like this, with players who will be playing a lot for their national teams, with the coronavirus, without a pre-season, with a schedule like we have, I am worried that we will pay the price in October, November, December and January,"" added the German. PSG lost their first two games of the new Ligue 1 campaign. However they have since won three in a row and will be fancied to extend that run at home to Angers, even if Angel Di Maria begins a four-match ban and left-back Juan Bernat is a long-term absentee with a knee injury. Neymar is available after escaping punishment following allegations of racist and homophobic abuse in an ill-tempered defeat by Marseille last month. The French league's disciplinary committee ruled on Wednesday that it did not have sufficient proof to take action against the Brazilian or Marseille defender Alvaro Gonzalez, who Neymar had accused of calling him a ""monkey"". Friday's game, which will be played before a maximum of 1,000 spectators due to tightened coronavirus restrictions in Paris, is PSG's last before the international break. However, their schedule is set to get very busy from the middle of this month, with the Champions League group stage starting on October 20. Brazil midfielder Paqueta, 23, this week joined Lyon from AC Milan on a five-year deal for a fee of 20 million euros ($23.4m). Paqueta, capped 11 times by Brazil, joined Milan from Flamengo in January last year but failed to properly settle at San Siro. Amid ongoing speculation that Houssem Aouar and Memphis Depay will leave Lyon before Monday's transfer deadline, Paqueta could make his Ligue 1 debut when his new team host bitter rivals Marseille on Sunday. 3 - PSG have lost just three times at home in 73 Ligue 1 games over the last five seasons. 13 - Rennes top the table with 13 points ahead of the weekend. It is their best ever start to a top-flight season. 100 - Lyon and Marseille meet for the 100th time in France's top flight. The game has become one of the great rivalries in Ligue 1 in recent years."

Neymar was sent off for slapping Gonzalez on the back of the head and was given a two-match ban for the incident. Last week, PSG's Angel Di Maria received a four-match ban for spitting during the fixture."

The Spanish press reported last year that Spanish tax authorities were pursuing Neymar for fiscal fraud dating back to his time at Barcelona, but it is the first time that the information has been officially confirmed. The Spanish tax office, contacted by AFP, did not say whether Neymar's presence on the list was linked to his 2013 transfer to Barcelona from Brazilian club Santos. But it said that to appear on the list of the highest debtors the individuals had to fulfil several criteria, including missing the final deadline to pay the debt."
80,25/09/2020,02:30,Neymar back but problems persist for PSG,"It has been a troubled start to the season for Paris Saint-Germain, overshadowed by a raft of coronavirus cases, suspensions and injuries, but the French champions can welcome back Neymar from a ban for this weekend's Ligue 1 game at Reims.","The world's most expensive player was handed a two-match suspension after his involvement in an unseemly brawl at the end of PSG's 1-0 home defeat by Marseille recently. Without him, his teammates bounced back from losing their opening two games of the season and recorded successive victories against Metz (1-0) and Nice (3-0). ""We are suffering a lot and we are really tired,"" said coach Thomas Tuchel after that latter outing, and Neymar's return can only improve their prospects of keeping that winning run going when they visit a Reims side who are winless in Ligue 1 and were in Hungary on Europa League duty on Thursday. Yet while PSG have now recovered the raft of players -- including Neymar and Kylian Mbappe -- who tested positive for Covid-19 following a holiday after their run to the Champions League final, the problems are not going away for Tuchel. Neymar faces further disciplinary action having been accused by Marseille of racially abusing their Japanese defender Hiroki Sakai in that same recent encounter. The French league will investigate those claims, and claims Neymar used a homophobic slur against Marseille's Alvaro Gonzalez, who the Brazilian says directed a racial slur at him. A decision in that case is expected next week. In the meantime, PSG learned on Wednesday that Angel Di Maria must serve a four-match ban for spitting at Gonzalez. The Argentine can feature this weekend but will not then be able to play another Ligue 1 game until early November, by which time PSG's Champions League campaign will be well underway. While Paris have been linked with a move for Chelsea midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko, Tuchel has lost left-back Juan Bernat to a serious knee injury and concerns remain about the form of Mauro Icardi. The Argentine striker did enough on loan last season from Inter Milan for PSG to sign him permanently for an initial reported fee of 50 million euros. However, he played no part in the Champions League semi-final win over RB Leipzig or the final against Bayern Munich, missed PSG's first two league games this season due to a positive Covid-19 test, and has failed to find the net in the two outings since his return. At least Mbappe looked lively last weekend against Nice, winning and converting a penalty before making another goal for Di Maria. It has been a slow start to life in France for David, who was one of the biggest signings made by a Ligue 1 club in the summer as Lille paid a reported 27 million euros ($31.4m) to recruit the 20-year-old Canada striker from Belgian side Gent. Brought in to replace Victor Osimhen, who was sold to Napoli, David has big boots to fill. Like Osimhen before him, David was prolific in Belgium but has struggled in his first four games in Ligue 1. Can he get his first goal this weekend? 26 - PSG have used 26 different players in four league games this season. 4 - The number of matches PSG's Angel Di Maria will miss -- after this weekend -- due to suspension. 21.5 - The average age of early league leaders' Saint-Etienne's starting line-up last weekend, with veteran coach Claude Puel having rejuvenated his squad. It is further evidence of Ligue 1's ability to keep producing young talent."
81,23/09/2020,22:19,PSG's Di Maria gets four-match spitting ban,Paris Saint-Germain winger Angel Di Maria received a four-match ban on Wednesday for spitting during this month's fiery Marseille game which saw five players red-carded and claims by Neymar of racial abuse.,"Di Maria's suspension meted out by Ligue 1's disciplinary commission was for spitting at Marseille defender Alvaro Gonzalez. It takes effect from September 29, meaning he can play against Reims on Sunday, returning the weekend of November 8. Neymar's accusation that Gonzalez racially abused him will be investigated on September 30, the commission announced. Neymar was sent off for slapping Gonzalez on the back of the head, accusing the Spaniard of calling him a ""monkey"". Gonzalez denies the charge. The world's most expensive player was served with a two-match ban last week for that incident in the September 13 fixture at the Parc des Princes. Also last week PSG defender Layvin Kurzawa incurred a six-match ban for kicking out at Marseille left-back Jordan Amavi, who was hit with a suspension of three games after he too was dismissed. And Leandro Paredes was banned for two games after he was sent off for a clash with fellow Argentine Dario Benedetto, who was also red-carded and suspended. Marseille won the game 1-0. The French league's disicplinary commission is also investigating accusations that Neymar made racist remarks towards Marseille's Japanese right-back Hiroki Sakai and made a homophobic slur against Gonzalez. Any player found guilty of racist or discriminatory abuse risks a ban of up to 10 matches."
82,21/09/2020,15:09,"Pirlo's debut, Mbappe's return and the Bayern juggernaut: European football talking points",Football across Europe is well and truly up and running again after the Italian Serie A and German Bundesliga seasons kicked off over the weekend. AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from the action across the continent:,"European champions Bayern Munich returned to action 26 days after their Champions League triumph in Lisbon and began their Bundesliga campaign in style with an ominous 8-0 destruction of Schalke at an empty Allianz Arena. Serge Gnabry scored a hat-trick for Hansi Flick's team as they claimed a record victory for the opening weekend of a German top-flight season and suggested it is going to take something extraordinary to stop them winning a ninth consecutive Bundesliga title. Having won a treble last season, Bayern picked up where they left off and have now recorded a remarkable 22 straight victories. ""We're still hungry,"" insisted Leroy Sane, who was making his debut after arriving from Manchester City. While Thiago Alcantara has left for Liverpool, Sane's arrival adds extra quality in the final third and it will be a big ask for anyone to keep up with the pace set by Bayern. However, Borussia Dortmund impressed in their 3-0 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach and RB Leipzig were also victorious in their opening game. And Bayern's win does come with a caveat: a dreadful Schalke side were merely picking up where they left off at the end of last season in failing to win any of their last 16 Bundesliga outings. All eyes were on Andrea Pirlo as the rookie coach took charge of Juventus for the first time in their Serie A season opener against Sampdoria in Turin. Juventus began their bid for a 10th straight Scudetto by beating Claudio Ranieri's side 3-0 and a new face delivered the first goal of the new era, with 20-year-old Swedish winger Dejan Kulusevski's classy finish putting them ahead before Leonardo Bonucci and Cristiano Ronaldo also netted. ""It will take time. We lack players but we're trying to do the best with what we have,"" said Pirlo, who has not had long to settle in after replacing Maurizio Sarri in August. Another new face in the Juventus team on Sunday was Weston McKennie, the USA midfielder signed on loan from Schalke. Paris Saint-Germain have had a slow start to the new French season, their hangover after losing the Champions League final worsened by a raft of coronavirus cases and then a series of suspensions following an ugly brawl at the end of last week's home defeat by Marseille. But after losing their first two games of their Ligue 1 title defence, PSG edged a 1-0 win over Metz before looking more like themselves against Nice on Sunday in a 3-0 victory. It was no coincidence that the game marked the return of Kylian Mbappe after a spell on the sidelines following a positive coronavirus test. The World Cup winner won and then scored the penalty which gave PSG the lead, and made the second goal for Angel Di Maria just before half-time in PSG's 500th game since being taken over by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011. ""What he did was impressive,"" said Paris coach Thomas Tuchel. ""He does extraordinary things."" Spanish champions Real Madrid began their La Liga title defence -- and the post-Gareth Bale era -- with a flat 0-0 draw away to Real Sociedad and the headlines on Monday morning summed it up: ""Without punch"", said sports daily Marca, while As called it a ""debut without gunpowder"". With Norwegian starlet Martin Odegaard starting against the side for whom he impressed on loan last season, but with Casemiro on the bench and Eden Hazard absent altogether, Zinedine Zidane's men could not find a way through and there are legitimate questions about where this Real side really stands without any major new investment forthcoming. ""We defended well and were a little bit lacking up front, but we will work on that. We need to be calm,"" said Zidane."

Angel di Maria added a second just before half-time and Marquinhos headed the third after 66 minutes. Mbappe thought he had scored a fourth late on but it was ruled out for offside. He was replaced by Pablo Sarabia shortly after. ""I'm impressed by his performance after only one training session with the team,"" said coach Thomas Tuchel. ""He always shows that he can do extraordinary things and that he knows how to make a difference. It helps us a lot."" It was a second successive Ligue 1 win for PSG who began the season still smarting from defeat in the Champions League final. They lost their opening two games and the second ended in a mass brawl against Marseille which led to the suspension of Brazilian forward Neymar. With Marco Verratti also back, PSG rarely looked troubled in the sunshine of the Mediterranean. When 19-year-old Khephren Thuram-Ulien clipped Mbappe's ankle as the striker surged into the box, the France forward picked himself up to blast the ball high into the net. Four minutes later, Nice almost levelled when PSG keeper Keylor Navas had to get down sharply to his left to beat away a shot from Rony Lopes. Mbappe was back in the thick of it as the game entered stoppage time at the end of the first half. Losing two defenders, Mbappe fired in a sharp shot which Nice keeper Walter Benitez did well to parry but only as far as the feet of Di Maria, who tapped in for 2-0. PSG continued to control the game after the break and were rewarded with a third when Marquinhos got in front of the defence to head home. Saint-Etienne just about held onto top spot in the table despite throwing away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Nantes and end their perfect start to the new season. Claude Puel's side are level on 10 points with next weekend's opponents Rennes after goals from Moses Simon in the 71st minute and Renaud Emond five minutes from time cancelled out Adil Aouchiche and Yvann Macon's strikes for the away side. Later, Valere Germain salvaged a late point Marseille in a 1-1 draw with Lille thanks to his 85th-minute equaliser. Luiz Araujo had claimed a 47th-minute lead for the visitors at Stade Velodrome."

""Tests this morning (Thursday) confirmed an isolated rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the left knee,"" PSG said in a statement. The 27-year-old's departure from the field left PSG, who had used all their substitutes and had defender Abdou Diallo sent off earlier in the match, with nine men. Bernat is now facing months out injured leaving coach Thomas Tuchel with another selection issue in what has been a turbulent start to the season. Rookie Dutchman Mitchel Bakker, 20, is his only professional replacement at left-back for PSG's clash at Nice on Sunday following Layvin Kurzawa's six-match suspension for his part in a brawl with Marseille players. Tuchel is without Neymar after he was handed a two-game ban for slapping Alvaro Gonzalez, accused by the Brazilian superstar of racist abuse, during Marseille's 1-0 win at the Parc des Princes at the weekend. The German will also have to do without Leandro Paredes, who was sent off for a clash with fellow Argentine Dario Benedetto in that defeat, and Diallo. However Tuchel said he hopes to be able to ""count on"" Kylian Mbappe, who was placed in quarantine after testing positive for coronavirus, in southern France."

""I'm very proud, it's incredible, honestly. I still have to think about it because I still can't believe it,"" PSG coach Thomas Tuchel said after the game. PSG, who started the game seriously depleted, were reduced to 10 men after 65 minutes when central defender Abdou Diallou collected a second yellow card and his club's fourth of the season. In the dying seconds, defender Juan Bernat, a 63rd minute replacement, limped off with a knee injury, leaving PSG, who had used all their replacements with nine men. ""All the fans can be proud, we still deserved to win, at 9 against 11,"" said Tuchel. While the game was in progress, the French league announced bans of two games for Neymar and Leandro Paredes and six games for Layvin Kurzawa after their red cards during a home loss to Marseille on Sunday that ended in a brawl. Another star attacker, Kylian Mbappe, remains in coronavirus quarantine while Thilo Kehrer and Marco Verratti are injured. But striker Mauro Icardi, centreback Marquinhos and goalie Keylor Navas returned after spells in quarantine. ""We made a lot of effort, we had a lot of changes, we used a lot of players who have not trained for a while...with players who haven't played for a long time,"" said Tuchel. ""But the effort is still there."" PSG had opened the season with two defeats for the first time since 1984/85, losing by one goal to Lens and then Marseille. They again dominated possession on Wednesday but lacked a cutting edge until Draxler pounced in the dying seconds and saved them from starting a season goalless in three goalless for the first time in their 50-year history. ""At 11 we missed all our chances, in the second half we were tired, it wasn't easy to create chances, at 10 we still had two great chances, we still miss, we don't score,"" said Tuchel. ""This team has shown once again that they have an extraordinary spirit."" Metz coach Vincent Hogon blamed his team. ""We ruined everything.

""Fourteen yellow cards and five reds means the match was out of control,"" said Leonardo. ""Not to criticise the referee but perhaps it's not the time to officiate a 'clasico'."" Tuchel tried to downplay the defeat. ""I'm not angry. I think you have to separate the performance and the result. We played a great match, I'm happy with the quality, mentality and the effort,"" he said. ""I told the players if we continue to play like that we'll win every match.

Marseille find themselves with an early six-point advantage as they attempt to close the gap on PSG, French champions seven of the past eight years. After fielding a depleted line-up at Lens on Thursday, Tuchel was able to recall Neymar and Angel Di Maria for a match played in front of around 4,000 supporters in Paris. However, Kylian Mbappe remained absent after testing positive for the coronavirus on France duty at the start of the week with Mauro Icardi and Marquinhos also still missing. Marseille 'keeper Steve Mandanda produced a magnificent reflex to keep out an effort from Marco Verratti just a minute in as tempers bubbled over frequently in the capital. Thauvin, who shone in Marseille's opening 3-2 win at Brest before the international break, made the breakthrough when he turned in a Dimitri Payet free-kick from point-blank range. Di Maria found the net for PSG just past the hour but had strayed behind the last defender, and Marseille's celebrations were cut short in similar fashion moments later when a Benedetto goal was ruled offside. PSG's last goal came in the 3-0 win over RB Leipzig in the Champions League semi-final on August 18, and Neymar poked wide from a Pablo Sarabia cross before the contest deteriorated at the finish. ""It's a bit disappointing we ended like that,"" said Thauvin. ""We didn't want to get into that sort of game."""

Neither Puma nor Neymar's communications team immediately responded to requests for comment. Speculation has been flying that the 28-year-old striker would sign with Puma since his endorsement deal ended with Nike, the company that had sponsored him since he was a 13-year-old prodigy. Neymar had appeared to drop hints that a deal was close, said Esporte Interativo. He recently followed Puma, PumaFootball and eight other accounts associated with the brand on Instagram, and posted a picture of himself Thursday with what appeared to be a statue of a puma in the background. Neymar's last deal with Nike was reportedly an 11-year contract worth a total $105 million. Forbes magazine, which ranks him the world's seventh highest-paid celebrity, estimates his earnings for this year at $95.5 million, including endorsement deals. PSG paid a record 222 million euros for his transfer from Barcelona. With his skinny good looks, tattoos, ever-changing hairstyles and huge following on social media, Neymar is one of the biggest names in sports and beyond -- though his brand has been tarnished at times. On the pitch, critics accuse him of diving in matches. Off the pitch, he has faced accusations of tax fraud and a 2019 rape allegation. Brazilian police later dismissed the latter case, citing a lack of evidence."
96,11/09/2020,13:52,"For weakened PSG, Marseille present a dangerous early test",Suddenly Paris Saint-Germain's home debut at Parc des Princes on Sunday to face old enemy Marseille is looking as likely to turn into a car crash as a triumphal parade.,"Less than three weeks after playing their first Champions League final, Paris Saint-Germain returned to Ligue 1 with a thud on Thursday as a team severely depleted by coronavirus lost at promoted Lens. Both games ended in 1-0 defeats, but that is where the similarities end. PSG went toe-to-toe with Bayern in Lisbon. In Lens, the French champions enjoyed almost three quarters of possession but managed only one shot on target while the home team threatened on almost every attack. PSG only fielded four of the same starters in the two games. Against Lens, coach Thomas Tuchel gave league debuts to 18-year-olds Arnaud Kalimuendo and Kays Ruiz. ""We were playing together for the first time. It takes time, otherwise football would be simple and easy,"" said Italian international midfielder Marco Verratti. Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, Mauro Icardi and Angel di Maria, who between them scored two thirds of PSG's league goals last season, were all absent after testing positive for Covid-19. So was key central defender Marquinhos. Tuchel complained that the absence of the attacking ""Fantastic Four"" meant Ruiz and veteran Ander Herrera had to play attacking roles that do not suit them. ""It was necessary for them to create things and that's not their strength,"" Tuchel said. He could not say ""exactly"" whether any of the absent stars will be able to play on Sunday but added that they have been missing training. ""If they're there, OK, but they'll be in a physical condition where I can't expect them to be decisive. ""I'm not worried, but realistic,"" Tuchel said. ""If we have to play with the same team against Marseille, we'll do it."" The only expected change is number two goalkeeper Sergio Rico, in place of 20-year-old Pole Marcin Bulka, who presented Lens with their goal on Thursday by attempting to pass to Verratti. Verratti, returning from a calf injury that forced him to watch most of the Champions League final rounds from the bench, played the whole match against Lens. ""Normally, the maximum for him should have been to play 60 or 70 minutes,"" Tuchel said. ""We took a risk"". The French league season kicked off on August 21, two days before the Champions League final. Even though it has made a slow start with PSG and European semi-finalists Lyon absent, games postponed because of the coronavirus and an international break, PSG are already six points behind leaders Nice after Patrick Vieira's side won their first two games. PSG finished 12 points ahead of Marseille with a game in hand when last season was brought to an early halt by the pandemic and have won the league three straight years. PSG face a frenzied scheduled, hosting Metz next Wednesday before travelling to pacesetters Nice the following Sunday. Other than turning Icardi's loan into a permanent move and signing Rico, normally free-spending PSG have been quiet this summer, though Tuchel said he hoped veteran full-back Alessandro Florenzi would arrive from Roma over the weekend. av-ah/fbr/ole/pb/gj <org>SOCIETE D'EDITION DE CANAL +</org>"

They started the match with their third-choice goalkeeper Marcin Bulka and it was the 20-year-old who handed Lens the win with an awful blunder 11 minutes after the break. Under no pressure and trying to play out from the back, Bulka slid a weak pass towards Marci Verratti that was snapped up by Ignatius Ganago, who slammed home what turned out to be the winner from close range. The strike was the Cameroon international's first goal for his new club after signing from Nice in July and sent the rowdy 3,800 fans at Stade Bollaert-Delelis wild with joy. ""I'm very happy. It feels good to open my account and I hope to score many more,"" said the 21-year-old Ganago. ""Even without Neymar or Mbappe Paris have a very good team. We were solid, we were compact, we all worked together and it paid off in the end."" Covid-19 has ripped the heart out of coach Thomas Tuchel's side, with Angel Di Maria and Leandro Paredes also testing positive. PSG confirmed three more cases with L'Equipe identifying them as Argentine striker Mauro Icardi, Brazilian defender Marquinhos and goalkeeper Keylor Navas. Apart from Mbappe all of them contracted the virus after holidaying in Ibiza after losing the Champions League final to Bayern Munich in Lisbon last month. Mbappe tested positive on France duty at the start of the week, forcing the world's second most expensive player to sit out Tuesday's World Cup final rematch with Croatia. Tuchel's thin squad now face a rush of fixtures as they try to catch up with a league awaiting its third round of matches at the weekend.

Just to complicate matters further, striker Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting is out of contract, although the domestic press raise the possibility he might sign an extension. Tuchel's plight was laid bare when at training on Monday he only had 11 players at his disposal, with others away on international duty. PSG's scheduled first game against Metz was pushed back due to their Champions League commitments. They then requested and were granted a further delay to the start of their title defence to allow them to get over their European hangover. Tuchel will be grateful some of his absent men will be returning from playing for their countries this week, as PSG face a hectic return to domestic duties. After Lens they host arch rivals Marseille at the Parc des Princes on Sunday, a clash most of the quarantined players are also expected to miss according to both sporting director Leonardo and Tuchel. ""After the holidays, after this quarantine phase without training, I'm under the impression this match on Sunday comes too soon. But we're going to wait a bit,"" Tuchel said Wednesday. ""Tomorrow (Thursday) we're in Lens, I think some players will be able to do a little individual session, and after perhaps two players will be able to return to training Friday while perhaps two will come back Saturday,"" he added. If given the virus all-clear they should be back in time for Metz at home on September 16 and Nice four days later. This all leaves Tuchel with a selection headache for the trip to northern France, switching midfielders Julian Draxler or Pablo Sarabia up into attack and relying on PSG's pool of youngsters. And in goal, with Navas out and Sergio Rico unavailable as he signed his contract after the original August 29 date for the fixture, Tuchel will have to call on 20-year-old Marcin Bulka who has played just one first-team game for the club. Captaining Tuchel's mix and match team is likely to be Presnel Kimpembe following the departure of Thiago Silva to Chelsea.

""All of the players and coaching staff will continue to undergo tests in the coming days."" When contacted by AFP, the club declined to confirm the identity of the players in question. But the source replied ""yes"" when asked if Neymar was one of those to test positive, along with teammates Angel Di Maria and Leandro Paredes, as had earlier been reported by French sports daily L'Equipe. The cases would appear to be linked to a holiday trip to the Spanish Mediterranean island of Ibiza that several PSG players took following the Champions League final defeat by Bayern Munich. The news is a setback to the French champions' preparations for the scheduled start of their Ligue 1 campaign next week, with a game away at Lens set for September 10 but possibly now at risk of being postponed. PSG had already said on Monday that two unnamed players had reported back with coronavirus symptoms following a holiday. L'Equipe reported the players in question at the time were Argentinian duo Di Maria and Paredes. Those two, and Neymar, were among several players who travelled to Ibiza following the Champions League final, mixing with friends and family after spending the previous weeks isolated in a secure sanitary 'bubble' with teammates in Portugal. That was after the controversial decision was taken to postpone the game at newly-promoted Lens, initially scheduled for last Saturday, in order to give the PSG squad a break following their Champions League 'Final Eight' exertions. PSG, France's richest club, have played five competitive games in the last six months. Mauro Icardi, Ander Herrera, Keylor Navas and Marquinhos were also in Ibiza, and the latter's wife revealed on Instagram that the Brazilian defender had been placed in isolation while awaiting the results of his own test for Covid-19, After playing Lens on September 10, PSG are then due to entertain bitter rivals Marseille three days later. In the meantime, various members of coach Thomas Tuchel's squad are set to play for their countries in the UEFA Nations League, with Kylian Mbappe and Presnel Kimpembe in France's squad for a game against Croatia just 48 hours before their club's scheduled return to action. But their South American stars including Neymar are not involved in international action. Strict French league rules stipulate that collective team training sessions must be cancelled if a club has at least four positive tests over an eight-day period, with match postponements possible. The cases raise questions about why the French league decided to postpone PSG's match in Lens, only for so many of their players to travel abroad on holiday during a pandemic. The last French season was ended early, with 10 rounds of matches left unplayed, because of the health crisis, and the start of the new French season has already been impacted. In recent weeks, several Ligue 1 clubs have reported positive tests, including Strasbourg, Lyon, Marseille, Rennes, Nantes and Montpellier. Marseille's game against Saint-Etienne on August 21, which was set to be the season opener, was postponed."

Media reports said the 28-year-old Paris Saint-Germain and Brazil talisman was in talks with Nike's German rival Puma. ""We generally do not comment on rumors,"" a spokesman for Puma in Germany responded. Brazilian news site UOL said Neymar and Nike had failed to reach a deal on how much money he would be paid for renewing his contract. It said negotiations between the company and the footballer's agents had run into trouble months ago. Neymar's communications team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo said Neymar's last deal with Nike was an 11-year contract that was set to expire in 2022, worth a total $105 million. Neymar, who is fresh off the heartbreak of narrowly losing the Champions League final to Bayern Munich, holds the record for the most expensive football transfer in history. PSG paid 222 million euros to bring him from Barcelona in 2017. Forbes magazine, which ranks him the world's seventh highest-paid celebrity, estimates his earnings for this year at $95.5 million, including endorsement deals. Neymar signed his first deal with Nike as a youth standout at Brazilian side Santos, which sold him to Barcelona in 2013. With his skinny good looks, tattoos, ever-changing hairstyles and huge following on social media, the player soon exploded onto the international scene, dazzling the football world with the skills he honed playing five-a-side ""futsal"" on the mean streets of suburban Sao Paulo. But his brand, already blemished by tax fraud allegations over his murky transfer to Barca, was badly dented last year when a Brazilian woman accused him of raping her. Nike expressed its ""deep concern"" at the time, but stood by the player after police closed the case, citing a lack of evidence. Neymar will still wear Nike apparel on the pitch: the company sponsors both PSG and the Brazilian national team. The company sponsors many of the most iconic names in sports, including Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Cristiano Ronaldo, Serena Williams, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy."

The French champions were left to pay the price for failing to convert the opportunities that came their way -- Neymar was notably denied by a fine Manuel Neuer save early on, but Kylian Mbappe really should have done better than shoot straight at the goalkeeper just before half-time. The two most expensive players in football history were signed, ultimately, to win this game. It was not their night, and Neymar was in tears at the end. ""Inconsolable"" was the headline on the front page of sports daily L'Equipe on Monday, underneath a photo of the Brazilian crying. But PSG have muscled their way into the very elite of European clubs in the years since Qatar Sports Investments took over in the French capital in 2011 and they will be hopeful of getting to another Champions League final while Neymar and Mbappe are still there. ""Nobody thought we would make it to the final. We were very close to winning it, but that's football,"" said PSG's Qatari president, Nasser al-Khelaifi. ""We are going to work hard to win the Champions League next season because that is our objective and now we believe in it more than before."" On Sunday they became the seventh consecutive side to lose when appearing in the Champions Leaague final for the first time. At least next time, if there is one, they will not be novices. Coach Thomas Tuchel, who put the defeat down to ""bad luck"", has been widely praised for getting a team dominated by a couple of superstars to all pull together in the same direction. ""The players are right behind the coach. I have heard things about how he supposedly can't handle the dressing room and the star players but the truth is that he is overseeing the best season in the history of the club,"" said Mbappe of Tuchel ahead of the final. PSG showed fantastic spirit to come from a goal down and beat Atalanta in the quarter-finals and then outclassed RB Leipzig in the semi-finals. They had overturned a first-leg deficit to oust Borussia Dortmund in the last 16, just before the coronavirus shutdown, while in France they won every trophy going last season. Their improved European performances represent enormous progress after often humiliating defeats in previous campaigns. Yet while there are positives, questions remain and Tuchel has much work to do, and little time to reflect on what might have been -- PSG play their first game of the new Ligue 1 season, away in Lens, on Saturday. The Champions League group stage begins again in October and between now and then Paris may need to get busy in the transfer market. Edinson Cavani, right-back Thomas Meunier and young defensive prospect Tanguy Nianzou Kouassi all left the club under freedom of contract before the 'Final Eight'. The latter has joined Bayern, becoming the latest in a long line of exciting youngsters to walk away from PSG. They can only hope he does not come back to haunt them in the way Coman -- another Paris-born ex-PSG starlet -- did in Lisbon. Skipper Thiago Silva is now out of contract too. Meanwhile Mauro Icardi, whose loan move from Inter Milan was made permanent in May for a reported fee of 55 million euros, played no part at all in the final, raising further questions. ""I think we have created a special atmosphere in the squad over the last two years,"" Tuchel insisted. ""We have lost lots of key players, big characters, so now we must create a strong new team which is capable of doing this again. That will be the challenge for us."""

But it was a bizarre spectacle with the 65,000-seat stadium empty, supporters having been barred from attending the biggest match in club football. The coronavirus pandemic killed the Champions League as we know it, at least temporarily, and UEFA was forced to come up with a new 'Final Eight' format in order to make sure its flagship competition was completed. UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin told AFP in an interview in Lisbon that the format was likely to be a one-off, and some will be tempted to say that this Champions League should always have an asterisk next to it. But, against first-time finalists PSG, Bayern were worthy winners of their sixth European Cup, their third in the Champions League era. They won all their 11 Champions League matches this season, an unprecedented feat. They scored 43 goals in that time on a run that included a 7-2 win at Tottenham Hotspur and the stunning 8-2 demolition of Barcelona in the quarter-finals in Lisbon. They just had the better of the final, even if they were fortunate at times up against the French side's formidable attack of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Angel Di Maria. In Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, David Alaba and Thomas Mueller, Bayern's line-up featured four survivors from their last final victory, against Borussia Dortmund in 2013. But this was also about the new faces, such as 19-year-old left-back Alphonso Davies, the Canadian international. ""Moments like these you dream of as a kid,"" he told DAZN. ""I honestly can't believe it, winning the Champions League is the top level."" Flick deserves great credit. A year ago Bayern were dumped out by Liverpool, the eventual winners, in the last 16, and under Niko Kovac looked a long way off being contenders to win the trophy again. But Flick replaced Kovac in November, initially as caretaker, and has gone on to win a treble. ""It's such a huge joy, it feels like we have come a long way since November,"" said Mueller, a player reborn under Flick. ""I don't know how it looked from outside, but it felt like we deserved it in the way we played."" As for changing coach mid-season, it is a formula that has worked for clubs at this level in the recent past. Flick is the third coach in the last decade to win the Champions League having being appointed during a campaign, after Roberto di Matteo with Chelsea in 2011/12 and Zinedine Zidane with Real Madrid in 2015/16. Zidane went on to win the next two as well. It remains to be seen how Bayern will fare next season, which is just around the corner, with the Bundesliga starting on September 18 and the Champions League group stage in October. They will be a formidable force again, but so will their rivals, including PSG, who need not be too downbeat in defeat. ""Over the last few weeks we have shown everything you need to win every title going,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""We lost 1-0 in the final against one of the strongest sides in Europe. We must maintain the same quality to carry on this road."" The format of one-off matches in the quarter-finals and semi-finals maybe helped PSG more than anybody else, given their struggles in knockout ties in recent years. But, as long as the health crisis does not worsen again, the Champions League will return to normal in the new campaign, and that includes seeing at least some fans return to stadiums. Istanbul is in line to host the 2021 final, having had this season's showpiece taken away, and hopefully the winning team will be able to celebrate with their supporters. As Flick said: ""It's a pity that the fans couldn't be here with us today. Perhaps they can be back again in the future. A game like this without supporters is not the football that we know."""
114,24/08/2020,01:39,"Tale of two cities: 'Sensational' for Bayern fans, sadness and tear gas in Paris",Fans celebrated Bayern Munich's Champions League final win in a socially-distanced open-air cinema in the Bavarian city on Sunday.,"Almost 700km away in Paris, health protocols went out of the window as 5,000 fans gathered at the Parc des Princes to see their team lose the final in Lisbon 1-0. In Munich, a large police presence was deployed to enforce, as much as possible, the restrictions linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, with fines for offenders during the match. Screenings of the game in fan zones were prohibited. So many fans fell back on the cafes of the city centre or at an open-air cinema near the former Olympic stadium in Munich, where Bayern played for several decades, before taking up residence at the Allianz Arena. This site can normally accommodate up to 2,000 spectators for screenings. Due to the coronavirus, however, there were only around 500 watching the game on Sunday. 'Champions! Champions!"" chanted fans after the club's sixth triumph in Europe's biggest tournament. On the final whistle, the main Leopoldstrasse avenue was filled with cars in the colours of the city club, while supporters waved Bayern flags. ""Really great for the city of Munich, it's sensational,"" said Tobias Rau, 27. ""It's a performance that we have the right to celebrate despite the coronavirus and the fact that we have to respect the rules,"" he added. ""It's more than deserved, it was really tight, but the Bayern players have really had an incredible season,"" said Lukas, 31. At the Parc des Princes, supporters lit flares and belted out their favourite chants. Unlike Munich, social distancing inside and outside the ground was forgotten as fans who hoped to celebrate their team's first ever Champions League triumph were left without a party to go to. ""We are disappointed but we weren't dreadful,"" PSG fan Anne Vaneson told AFP. ""In the first half, we were on a level playing field but we paid for a dip in performance in the first 20 minutes of the second half."" Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said that she hoped for ""mature celebrations"" should PSG triumph over Bayern, after supporters clashed with police following their 3-0 win over RB Leipzig in the semi-finals. However there were scuffles between fans and police outside the ground throughout the game, with youngsters armed with fireworks targeted with tear gas by police. Dustbins and in one case a vehicle were set on fire by youths angered by their team's defeat, while police vans were pelted with bottles. Police said that they had to clear away 100 people who had gathered at the Porte de Saint-Cloud area of the French capital near the Parc des Princes."
115,24/08/2020,01:01,Kimmich hails Bayern's treble-winning 'Band of Brothers',"Joshua Kimmich hailed the ""Band of Brothers"" spirit in the treble-winning Bayern Munich team and the impact of head coach Hansi Flick after their 1-0 win over Paris Saint Germain in Sunday's Champions League final.","A second-half header by Bayern's former PSG product Kingsley Coman in the Lisbon final was enough to crown the Bavarian giants as European champions for the sixth time. This is only the second time Bayern has won the treble of Bundesliga, German Cup and now Champions League titles after first achieving the feat in 2013. ""This is the biggest day in my career,"" said right-back Kimmich, who celebrated on the Lisbon pitch with Serge Gnabry, a fellow product of Stuttgart's academy. ""It's impossible to describe what it feels like to stand on the pitch with such a team. ""It's like playing with brothers, it doesn't get better than that. ""Even if you make a mistake, someone else makes up for it."" Bayern have become the first team to win all ten games in a single Champions League season, heavily disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, by scoring an incredible 43 goals in the process. Kimmich put their success down to head coach Flick who took charge in November, after predecessor Niko Kovac was sacked, and has forged an ""unbeatable"" spirit. ""Hansi Flick showed a lot of trust in us from the beginning,"" said Kimmich. ""We already had a bit of a feeling of being unbeatable. ""We deserved to win this competition."""
116,23/08/2020,23:20,Flick's 10-month path from interim Bayern coach to Champions League triumph,"Hansi Flick wrote himself into Bayern Munich folklore on Sunday, completing a 10-month odyssey from interim boss to Champions League and treble-winning head coach in his first season.","Flick's team defeated Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 in the final having already secured the Bundesliga and German Cup. For Bayern it was their sixth triumph in Europe's premier tournament. Yet he was only initially appointed caretaker coach when Niko Kovac was sacked last November following a humbling 5-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt. It was the 55-year-old Flick's first job as a Bundesliga head coach. ""We can all be happy that we chose Hansi Flick and put our trust in him,"" said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. ""He's returned that trust a hundredfold."" Bayern have won 33 of their 36 games under Flick, earning him a contract until June 2023, and arrived in Sunday's final on a 20-match winning streak. ""His development has been incredible,"" ex-Germany defender Per Mertesacker, head of Arsenal's academy, told daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. During his 10 months in charge, Flick has put into practice what he learnt in eight years as assistant coach to Germany boss Joachim Loew until 2014. ""Hansi is growing into this 'Jogi' (Loew) role right now,"" added Mertesacker. At Bayern, Flick has stepped out of Loew's shadow, stamping his mark with ""more focus on training and match preparation, making difficult decisions,"" Mertesacker added. Thomas Muller, who has seen nine coaches in 12 years with Bayern, is equally impressed. ""Our game hasn't been so well organised since Pep Guardiola (coached Bayern from 2013-16),"" said Mueller. ""Hansi Flick has always been a great guy, very clear in what he tells us. ""But I didn't expect him to have the complete package to become Bayern's coach."" Mueller, often benched under Kovac, rewarded Flick's faith with a record 21 assists in the 2019/20 Bundesliga after returning to the starting side. Flick has managed the delicate feat of keeping Bayern's stars happy without relying on too much rotation. ""He was able to solve our problems as soon as he arrived,"" said midfielder Corentin Tolisso. ""He's a good coach who talks a lot with his players and gives them a lot of confidence."" German magazine Kicker hailed Flick's impact after winning his first four games as Bayern scored 16 goals without reply. ""In a short space of time, he has given Bayern back its identity,"" enthused Kicker. ""Bayern are once again dominating: the ball is flowing, they've regained control, the movements between the lines are right. The game is more structured."" Bayern reached Sunday's final by scoring 42 goals in 10 straight wins. The pinnacle was their jaw-dropping 8-2 thrashing of Lionel Messi's Barcelona in the quarter-finals. After injuries forced the former Bayern and Cologne midfielder to retire at 28, Flick had spells coaching lower-league clubs. ""He's a big part of this win, along with the whole coaching staff, it's been a real team effort,"" said Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer after Sunday's win. His break was landing the plum job as Loew's assistant to the Germany team after the 2006 World Cup. After helping mastermind Germany's 2014 World Cup triumph, Flick then became sports director of the German FA until 2017. He joined Bayern as Kovac's assistant in July 2019 and the rest is history. ""Hansi has a clear idea of what he wants to convey to his players,"" said Loew when Flick was appointed Bayern coach. ""I knew he would have a good start, but I believe Bayern will also give him confidence."" Loew's words proved prophetic as Flick cut a calm figure before the semi-final win over Lyon. ""I'm relaxed because I know this team is very focused and has big goals,"" he said. Victory on Sunday saw Flick graduate in 10 months from interim coach to landing the treble for only the second time in Bayern's proud history after Jupp Heynckes achieved the feat in 2013."
117,23/08/2020,23:08,Bayern win Champions League,"Bayern Munich won the European Cup for the sixth time on Sunday as Kingsley Coman's goal gave them a 1-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain in an engrossing Champions League final in Lisbon, completing a fantastic season for the German giants and leaving their opponents still searching for the trophy they covet more than anything.","It was often a cagey final, with a bit of needle between the teams, but chances too, especially before Coman appeared at the back post to head in Joshua Kimmich's inviting 59th-minute cross and wrap up a treble for a team who had already won the Bundesliga and German Cup. Hansi Flick's team will feel they deserved their victory, yet PSG will regret not taking any of the chances that were offered up to them on a surreal occasion at an empty Estadio da Luz. Kylian Mbappe in particular should have done better than shoot straight at Manuel Neuer right on the stroke of half-time. The France World Cup-winning forward had spoken of his determination to go down in his country's history by helping PSG become just the second French winners of European football's greatest prize. But they will have to wait for the chance to match Marseille, who won the inaugural Champions League in 1993. PSG's Qatari owners spent a combined 402 million euros ($474m) on Neymar and Mbappe in 2017 to win this competition, not just reach the final. However, in the end it was one who got away from Paris who denied them. The 24-year-old Coman was born in Paris and started his career at PSG, only to leave in 2014 for Juventus, sensing he wouldn't get the regular football he desired if he stayed put. He had been on the bench in the semi-final against Lyon but was promoted to the starting line-up for the final, replacing Ivan Perisic on the left wing. Now he may not be welcome back in his home city again. But at Bayern he will always be remembered as the man who won them this trophy in 2020, in the club's 11th final and seven years after they were last European champions. Flick's team have ended this season with 21 straight victories and unbeaten in 30 matches. They deserved to be crowned in a full stadium. However, only a few hundred lucky invitees were inside the cavernous home of Benfica to see the denouement of the 'Final Eight', at the end of a competition so long delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. The strangest of finals pitted together two clubs who have taken very different routes to becoming part of Europe's elite, with Bayern's status as Germany's most successful and powerful side long established and PSG having left the rest of the French game behind following the Qatari takeover of 2011. But if this was a mismatch in terms of history, on and off the pitch right now they are almost perfectly balanced. That translated into the kind of proper match-up on the field that neither side often experiences these days. Bayern came desperately close to opening the scoring midway through the first half when Lewandowski -- looking for his 56th goal of the season -- took down an Alphonso Davies cross, turned and struck a shot against the post. The Pole also came close with a header that was saved by Keylor Navas, PSG's goalkeeper who won the Champions League three times with Real Madrid and who was returning after injury ruled him out of the semi-final against RB Leipzig. But Bayern take risks by playing with such a high line, and PSG should have punished them in the first half. Neymar was denied by an excellent Neuer save after being set up by Mbappe, while Mbappe himself contrived to fire straight at the goalkeeper after David Alaba gited him the ball in the Bayern box. Alaba had earlier seen his central defensive colleague, Jerome Boateng, limp out seemingly with a recurrence of the hamstring problem that forced him off against Lyon. Niklas Suele replaced him and helped contain the Paris attack as Bayern held onto their lead. Bayern had broken the deadlock just before the hour mark in a move that began with a sprayed Thiago Alcantara pass forward, and ended with Coman arriving to head in Kimmich's perfect delivery. Neymar ended the game with a yellow card for chopping down Lewandowski, and a runners-up medal, while Bayern celebrated."
118,23/08/2020,16:12,Formidable Bayern stand in way of PSG,"The Paris Saint-Germain of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe go after a first-ever Champions League crown in a final behind closed doors in Lisbon on Sunday, but standing in their way are a fearsome Bayern Munich led by the prolific Robert Lewandowski.","It is a mouthwatering showdown between two of Europe's super clubs, with PSG eager to cap their rise in the last decade under Qatari ownership and Bayern hoping to lift the trophy for the sixth time. Such an occasion deserves to be played in front of a full stadium, but the cavernous, 65,000-seat Estadio da Luz will remain empty. No fans are allowed in, as has been the case throughout this unprecedented 'Final Eight' tournament in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. ""It will be odd to play behind closed doors. We would have liked to have our supporters there but I know they are supporting us where they are. But this is still the Champions League,"" said Mbappe on Saturday. ""You still feel all the tension. Everyone wants to win it, especially with this unusual format. Everyone will remember this for a long time because of the tragic events surrounding it."" While the atmosphere in the ground will be surreal, the match promises to be fascinating, pitting together two teams whose domestic dominance is almost total and who were both comfortable winners in the semi-finals. PSG beat RB Leipzig 3-0 to become the first French representative in the final since Monaco in 2004 and can now become just the second French winner ever, after Marseille in 1993. ""At the gates of paradise"" roared a headline in France's leading sports daily, L'Equipe, on Sunday. ""This is exactly why I came here. I always said that I wanted to go down in my country's history. (This) is another chance to do that,"" said Mbappe. If PSG represent, in the eyes of many, the nouveau riche, Bayern are one of the continent's traditional giants. This is their 11th final. The last of their five victories came in 2013. Four starters from that victory over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley -- goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, David Alaba and Thomas Mueller -- could play here. Boateng is expected to start after a hamstring injury. The game comes exactly 50 years after PSG's first official match. When, in 1974, Bayern won their first European Cup, PSG were just winning promotion to France's top flight. Leaving aside their storied past, Bayern appear the most formidable team in Europe just now. Their 3-0 semi-final win over Lyon was their 20th consecutive victory. They are unbeaten in 29 matches since December last year under coach Hansi Flick. They have already pocketed a German league and cup double, with the Bundesliga title their eighth in a row. They have won all 10 Champions League matches this season, scoring 42 goals, including a 7-2 win at Tottenham Hotspur and the 8-2 quarter-final demolition of Barcelona. Lewandowski has 55 goals this season. But he is more than ably supported. Bayern take the risk of playing with a high defensive line. Yet it remains to be seen if they can afford to do that against PSG's attack of Neymar, Mbappe and Angel Di Maria. ""We've always played with a high line and ultimately we've got results doing that so we won't change too much,"" Flick insisted. ""Bayern's faith in their own strengths is unwavering,"" said Munich-based daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Sunday. The French champions have themselves lost once since November 1, last year, and they overturned that 2-1 reverse in Dortmund in the last 16 by winning the return leg. ""It is a small advantage for Bayern that they are used as a club to playing these games. I accept that, but it is not a decisive advantage,"" said their German coach Thomas Tuchel. He was optimistic playmaker Marco Verratti would start after a calf problem. Goalkeeper Keylor Navas is tipped to return after a hamstring injury. To the winners, along with the glory, will go huge sums in prize money. At the start of the season UEFA set out a prize pot which ensured up to 80 million euros ($94m) would be destined for the winners. To that sum can be added close to the same again from television and as a result of the clubs' respective UEFA ranking."
119,22/08/2020,21:32,Mbappe eager to 'go down in history',Kylian Mbappe is determined to make footballing history for France by leading Paris Saint-Germain to victory over Bayern Munich in Sunday's Champions League final in Lisbon.,"""This is exactly why I came here. I always said that I wanted to go down in my country's history. Tomorrow is another chance to do that,"" Mbappe said on the eve of the game which is PSG's first ever Champions League final appearance. Mbappe, now 21, emerged as a global superstar by helping France win the World Cup in Russia in 2018, becoming the youngest player since a teenage Pele to score in the final of that competition. He had signed for PSG a year earlier from Monaco in a transfer that cost a reported 180 million euros ($212m), the second biggest fee in history after the 222 million euros paid by Paris to sign Neymar from Barcelona just a few weeks previously. ""When I arrived in 2017, we had had several disappointments but now we are in the final and that shows that we didn't give up, I didn't give up, and it would be a fantastic reward to win with a French club,"" added Mbappe. ""That was my mission when I signed here. To win tomorrow (Sunday) would be incredible, it would be a great achievement."" PSG are the first French representatives to reach the Champions League final since 2004, when Monaco were beaten 3-0 by Porto. Only once before has a French team won Europe's elite club competition, when Marseille defeated AC Milan in the inaugural final of the modern Champions League, back in 1993 For PSG, it is also an opportunity to confirm their status as one of Europe's biggest names after being transformed in the last nine years since being taken over by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011. They have won seven of the last eight French titles, only missing out in that time in 2017 to Mbappe's Monaco. Thomas Tuchel's team have won every trophy this season in France. ""Are PSG a big club in Europe? I think tomorrow is a good opportunity for us to enter into that circle by winning the Champions League,"" Mbappe said. ""But we will leave other people to do the talking. We know our qualities and how important this club is in the eyes of the world, how much it has grown. ""We are focused on tomorrow, but if we win then we can debate that afterwards."" Mbappe also said he was feeling ""better every day"" having shaken off an ankle injury to start in PSG's 3-0 win over RB Leipzig in the semi-final last Tuesday."
120,22/08/2020,20:36,PSG hoping academies will challenge appeal of rivals,The young players of PSG's academy in Doha performed a range of drills under the watchful eyes of their mostly French coaches as the fierce Gulf sun set on the horizon.,"Their side's Champions League triumph against Leipzig, taking them through to Sunday's final against Bayern Munich in Lisbon, was on the lips of several students. ""My expectation is PSG are going to win 3-1, hat-trick from Neymar,"" said Yassine el-Samman, 11. ""But Bayern are a fantastic team."" Samman, like others at the under-12s training session, said his family were newcomers to the dominant French side. ""I was watching a match with my dad once. He told me there was this club he didn't know about called PSG. And I saw them play really well, so we decided to watch more of them."" The academy opened to fanfare in January 2019 at an event attended by PSG superstar Neymar and first team coach Thomas Tuchel. Open to boys and girls aged between five and 16, it operates across four sites, charging 2,000 riyals ($550, 465 euros) per month. PSG's network of more than 70 similar academies worldwide is a key part of its ambitious, Qatari-funded project to expand its appeal globally and secure a place in the top echelon of world football. ""It's important to promote our brand, but not only that. It's about values too,"" said academy technical director Cyril Klosek. ""PSG is already one of the best brands in the sports industry, we develop branding, merchandising and these academies."" Twenty-two youngsters in immaculate dark-blue PSG jerseys performed a range of dribbles and passes, sporting Qatari shirt sponsor Ooredoo telecom, rather than the principal branding of French hotelier Accor. While the hardcore of PSG's support in the country were gathered at the training ground, the club is working to appeal to football fans in Qatar more widely. ""Most of the (students) knew PSG, but maybe less than English Premier League clubs or Spanish clubs. But we talk a lot about the club's history,"" said Klosek. PSG's academy network is the cornerstone of the club's global ambitions as well as complementing Qatar's aim of becoming a footballing powerhouse by the time of the World Cup in 2022 which it will host. The Doha outpost, which trains 1,000 youngsters, a third of whom are Qatari, gives the people of the super-wealthy Gulf emirate the opportunity to share in Qatar's flagship sporting investment. Several PSG stars have visited in past years for winter training camps -- and fan selfies. The academy also supports Qatar's strategy to cultivate home-grown talent ahead of 2022 with one player from the PSG academy sent to Paris for trials. Despite owning the club through Qatar Sports Investments, PSG's following in Qatar pales in comparison to the popularity of English Premier League heavyweights like Manchester United and Chelsea. ""PSG was keen to set up training camps in Qatar, which contributed to strengthening their popularity in Doha,"" Qatar-based sports journalist Hossam Nabawy told AFP. ""Certainly winning the Champions League would contribute greatly to increasing Paris' popularity in most parts of the world, not just Doha."" But it is Liverpool that enjoys the perhaps the most spirited support in Qatar where its Egyptian talisman Mo Salah is revered by the 300,000-strong contingent of his expat countrymen. Qatar's total population is just 2.75 million. During the Club World Cup in Doha in December 2019, thousands of local Liverpool supporters joined forces with travelling fans to watch their victorious campaign. Qatar Reds have almost twice as many followers on Facebook as the PSG Fans Club Qatar, and the largely expat membership would gather to watch Liverpool fixtures before coronavirus. But Qataris themselves have warmed to PSG since their country acquired it in 2011, experts say. ""Qataris have become inclined to support the team after its acquisition by Qatar and the presidency of Nasser al-Khelaifi who (helped) the team reach the Champions League final for the first time,"" said commentator Mahmoud Nsiri. Away from PSG's academy and branded stores in a prominent mall and at the airport, there is little in Doha to suggest PSG has displaced the likes of Liverpool. But it is clear that many among PSG's new generation of supporters have been lured by the club's string of bank-busting signings, a direct result of Qatar's largesse. When asked why he supported PSG, one young supporter shopping in the club store ahead of Sunday's final said simply: ""Neymar""."
121,22/08/2020,19:22,Flick trusts Bayern's high line defence to subdue Neymar and Mbappe,Bayern Munich head coach Hansi Flick says he trusts their high line defence and will resist making changes in order to contain fleet-footed Paris Saint Germain forwards Neymar and Kylian Mbappe in Sunday's Champions League final.,"""In our games over the last 10 months we've always tried to impose our style on the opposition,"" Flick said Saturday with treble-chasing Bayern on a 20-match winning run. ""We've always played with a high line and ultimately we've got results doing that so we won't change too much. ""We don't want to give too much space to the opposition. ""What's important is we can press the opposition when we are in possession and make sure we cover the ground,"" he added, should PSG's forwards breach his defence. Bayern have powered into the Lisbon final by scoring 42 goals in 10 European matches. However, they nearly came unstuck early in Wednesday's semi-final against Lyon as the French side found plenty of space to attack behind Bayern's back four. Joshua Kimmich is tipped to switch from midfield to right-back, potentially tasked with keeping Neymar and Mbappe away from Bayern's goal. ""We don't know the starting eleven, but I think I'm going to play right-back,"" said Kimmich, who played in central midfield in the 3-0 win against Lyon. ""It might be Neymar and Mbappe on the right - they are very good going forward, but I don't think we are going to sit too deep."" Jerome Boateng, one of four survivors from the Bayern team which won the 2013 Champions League final, strained a hamstring against Lyon. ""I hope Jerome will be fit. After training we will debate how to go forward,"" said Flick. He hinted at changes to his starting line-up after substitutes Philippe Coutinho and Kingsley Coman impressed against Lyon. ""When they came off the bench, Kingsley and Philippe showed they can strengthen the side,"" said Flick. ""It's our third game in quick succession so we need to look at the players' fitness levels."" Having won the Bundesliga and lifted the German Cup, Bayern are chasing the treble in Flick's first season. Bayern shook up European football with a stunning 8-2 demolition of Spanish giants Barcelona in the quarter-finals and are in confident mood for Sunday's final. ""If we are able to produce our best performance, if we are all at 100 per cent, we will be able to win,"" added Flick."
122,22/08/2020,17:00,Bayern reject Bernat poised to haunt old side with PSG,"Bayern Munich were happy to see the back of Juan Bernat after he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in 2018, but the left-back has become a key player for the French giants and could haunt his ex-club in Sunday's Champions League final.","Bernat, a reliable presence at left-back, scored PSG's final goal in Tuesday's 3-0 semi-final win against RB Leipzig. The 27-year-old says he has ""fond memories"" of his four years in Munich, where he won four straight Bundesliga titles before being sold to the Parisians in August 2018. However, a few months after he had left Bernat's name suddenly came up in an explosive Bayern press conference in October 2018. When asked about left-back cover at the time, then president Uli Hoeness lambasted the Spaniard's performance in a Champions League quarter-final at Sevilla, six months previously. ""When we played in Seville, he alone was responsible for the fact that we almost dropped out,"" ranted Hoeness. ""That was the day we decided to sell him. He played like crap and almost cost us the Champions League season."" The focus of Hoeness's wrath was a Bernat mistake which allowed the Spaniards to take the lead in Bayern's 2-1 away win, eventually bowing out to Real Madrid in the semi-finals. Hoeness has since apologised with Bernat now a mainstay in Thomas Tuchel's side. ""I wouldn't use one or two words again - I was very sorry to have insulted Juan Bernat and the way he played,"" Hoeness said shortly after his outburst. To his credit, Bernat took Hoeness' rant in his stride and was ""surprised"" by the retrospective criticism. ""I was taught as a child to be grateful and I will always be grateful to Bayern for the four years I spent there."" Bernat has since won two Ligue 1 titles at the Parc des Princes. He scored key goals against Liverpool, Napoli and Manchester United in their 2018/19 Champions League campaign when they bowed out in the last 16. Having reportedly cost PSG 15 million euros ($17.7 million), he is a bargain in a squad of superstars. The nimble defender has started nine of 10 matches in Europe this season and is ""a very important player"" for Tuchel, who has praised Bernat's ""great attitude"".

123,22/08/2020,15:41,PSG and Bayern prepare for battle,"The Paris Saint-Germain of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe are one game away from winning a first UEFA Champions League that would cap their rise to the status of one of the world's most powerful clubs, but a fearsome Bayern Munich led by the prolific Robert Lewandowski stand in their way in Sunday's final.","It is a mouthwatering showdown between two of the European continent's super-clubs, two teams not used to losing, but one which will be played out behind closed doors inside the cavernous Estadio da Luz in Lisbon. In the year of the coronavirus pandemic, this Champions League will perhaps always carry an asterisk next to it, after the delay of five months in getting the round of 16 completed and the introduction of a 'Final Eight' tournament in Portugal's capital, with one-off ties in the quarter-finals and semi-finals and no supporters allowed in. Almost all the sense of occasion is lost from the relatively calm streets of Lisbon in the build-up, and the atmosphere at kick-off in Benfica's 65,000-seat ground will be at best surreal, at worst sad. None of that takes away from the significance of the occasion for two clubs who seek validation from the Champions League and the prestige surrounding it. Nine years after the Qatari takeover which transformed them, PSG have finally made it this far. They can become just the second French representative to win club football's biggest prize, 27 years after Marseille won the inaugural edition of the modern Champions League. It is a battle between the nouveau riche and one of the great names of the European football aristocracy -- Bayern are appearing in their 11th final. The Germans have won the trophy five times, most recently in 2013. Four starters from that 2-1 final win over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley -- goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, David Alaba and Thomas Mueller -- are in line to start here. When, in 1974, Bayern won the first of three successive European Cups, a young PSG outfit were only just winning promotion to France's top flight. A year later, captain Franz Beckenbauer lifted the trophy at PSG's Parc des Princes after Bayern beat Leeds United in the final. Twelve months after that, they defeated Saint-Etienne, the great French side of the era, to win it again. Leaving aside their storied past, Bayern are the most formidable team in Europe just now. Their 3-0 semi-final win over Lyon was their 20th consecutive victory. They are unbeaten in 29 matches since December last year under their unassuming coach Hansi Flick. They have already pocketed a German league and cup double, with the Bundesliga title their eighth in a row. They have won all 10 matches in the Champions League this season. They have scored 42 goals in those matches, including a 7-2 win away to Tottenham Hotspur and the 8-2 quarter-final demolition of Barcelona. Lewandowski has 55 goals this season. But he is more than ably supported. ""The difference to 2013 is that we have top players across the board. Back then, we won with fewer players,"" says Neuer. Bayern take the risk of playing with a dangerously high defensive line. Yet it remains to be seen if they can afford to take that risk against PSG's thrilling attack of Neymar, Mbappe and Angel Di Maria. PSG, under German coach Thomas Tuchel, utterly dominate in France and finally seem to have found a winning formula in Europe, gaining admiration from Beckenbauer himself. ""They're one heck of a team,"" he told Bayern's website. PSG were too strong for RB Leipzig in the semi-finals, winning 3-0. They have lost once since November 1, last year, and they overturned that 2-1 reverse in Dortmund in the last 16 by winning the return leg. Neymar finally seems happy. Mbappe is still feeling the after-effects of an ankle injury but remains capable of deciding the final. It remains to be seen, though, if goalkeeper Keylor Navas or midfield maestro Marco Verratti will be fit to start. ""I have been here for eight years, and it was hard before now, as it always is in the Champions League,"" said Verratti this week. ""This year we have had a fantastic run so far. Now we have 90 minutes left, and they will be the most important of our playing careers in the history of the club."""
124,22/08/2020,03:30,"PSG, a club transformed, allow Qatar to bask in limelight of Champions League final","If Paris Saint-Germain beat Bayern Munich in Sunday's Champions League final in Lisbon, the pictures will probably be of Neymar's tears of joy or wild scenes of celebration in the French capital, but basking in the glory of it all will be the Emir of Qatar.","The club's first appearance in the final of Europe's elite club competition comes in the month it celebrates its 50th birthday, yet the starting point for all this was June 30, 2011. That was when Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) bought PSG, with its president Nasser al-Khelaifi promising to make the club ""a great team and a strong brand on the international scene"". There is no doubt QSI has achieved that, even if Qatar's detractors question the motivations of the tiny, gas-rich nation protruding from the Arabian desert. PSG recently won their seventh French title in eight seasons and their fourth domestic treble in six years. Now, after half a dozen seasons of underwhelming performances on the continental stage, they are through to the biggest and most prestigious club game of all. ""Since we arrived here, the Champions League has been our dream, and we are close to fulfilling our dream now,"" Khelaifi said after the team beat RB Leipzig in the semi-final. PSG were big before QSI -- under the ownership of French pay TV giant Canal Plus in the 1990s, with stars like George Weah, they won the league in 1994 and reached the Champions League semi-finals a year later. They lifted their only European trophy to date, the Cup Winners' Cup, in 1996. But by 2011 this was a club in dire straits. They had just finished fourth in Ligue 1 but a year earlier came 13th. Crowds at the Parc des Princes were down with the club having stopped selling tickets to members of two rival supporters' groups because of hooliganism problems. Under Khelaifi, a revered figure in Qatar, PSG are effectively a different club. It took them just two years to shoot up to fifth place in Deloitte's Football Money League. Their revenue in 2012/13 was just under 400 million euros ($471m), having quadrupled in the short time under QSI. Only Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern and Manchester United sat before them. That season PSG returned to the Champions League after eight years away and won their first Ligue 1 title of the Qatar era. They made the marquee signing of David Beckham. Huge commercial deals were signed with the Qatar Tourism Authority and Qatari mobile provider Ooredoo. Deloitte's most recent figures put them fifth again with revenue of 635.9 million euros. PSG committed the two biggest transfer fees in history, signing Neymar from Barcelona for 222 million euros and Kylian Mbappe from Monaco for 180 million euros, in 2017. The club has spent, in total, an estimated 1.3 billion euros on transfer fees alone in these nine years. In footballing terms, it has all been about delivering on-field success. But QSI's aims, and the motivations behind Qatar's involvement, go far deeper. QSI's own rudimentary website talks of a vision ""to be internationally recognised as the leading sport, leisure and entertainment investment company in Qatar and abroad."" Choosing PSG, based in one of Europe's biggest and most glamorous cities, was a way for Qatar to grow its brand following its successful bid for the 2022 World Cup. ""It is all about branding, about attaching yourself to important and prestigious tournaments on the one hand, and glamorous and successful clubs on the other,"" Nicholas McGeehan, director of Fair Square Projects, who is an investigator and leading advocate on the rights of migrant workers in the Gulf, told AFP. The World Cup and Qatar's ownership of PSG have brought into the spotlight the country's treatment of migrant workers, but reputational benefits appear to outweigh the costs. ""Ultimately this is about politics, power and influence, not football,"" points out McGeehan. On the street in Doha, there is still more focus on the English Premier League than on PSG, although interest is growing. The PSG store in Doha's Villaggio mall was this week emblazoned with a poster proclaiming ""WE ARE PARIS -- LISBOA 2020"" covering half the shopfront. ""If they win, they will definitely make two victory tours, one in Paris and one here,"" said shop manager Abdul, decked out in the latest PSG strip. It is not just Paris -- Qatar Airways has a sleeve sponsorship deal with Bayern and took to Twitter labelling the final as the #Qlassico. For McGeehan, PSG's success will reflect positively on Qatar and Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, especially in the context of the Gulf crisis which has seen Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other neighbouring states cut diplomatic, economic and travel ties with Doha. ""In terms of the prestige of the Emir, it is of enormous political benefit to him. His political capital will be soaring amongst the Qataris,"" he said. ""Their brand is being splashed across the biggest football match that happens every year in Europe. They are going to have the biggest football match in the world in a couple of years. It could not be working out better for them on that score."""
125,21/08/2020,03:01,Neymar ready to deliver for PSG on biggest stage,"Paris Saint-Germain's fortunes in the Champions League in recent years have been inextricably linked to those of Neymar, even before they bought the Brazilian for a world record fee, and if he maintains his recent form in Sunday's final it may make the difference against formidable Bayern Munich.","At 28, Neymar is desperate to get his hands on another Champions League winner's medal, five years after he won the competition with Barcelona. If he can play the starring role in a PSG victory -- while Cristiano Ronaldo's Juventus were absent altogether from the 'Final Eight' and Lionel Messi and Barcelona went home in disarray -- he will perhaps be accepted as the best player in the world, even with no Ballon d'Or in this pandemic year. It would be good timing for Netflix too, with the streaming service currently working on a documentary series about his season in Paris according to reports in Brazil. And for PSG and their Qatari owners, it would validate their decision to pay 222 million euros ($264 million) to take him from Barcelona three years ago, after his first two seasons in the French capital were overshadowed by injury and constant reports that he was unsettled. When Paris signed him in August 2017, they were still reeling in the wake of their spectacular Champions League exit against Barcelona a few months earlier. After a stunning 4-0 win in the first leg of that last-16 tie, PSG collapsed in the return at the Camp Nou. Barcelona scored three times after the 88th minute, with Neymar hitting two of them, as Barcelona won 6-1. PSG went out, humiliated. It was not the first time PSG had been stung by Neymar -- when the sides met in the quarter-finals in 2015, he scored the first goal as Barca won 3-1 in France and then scored both in a 2-0 second-leg win. But Neymar's first two years at the Parc des Princes were one long melodrama. A brilliant player who was happy at Barcelona but had been eager to step out of Messi's shadow, he never appeared at ease in his new surroundings. By the summer of 2019 it was no secret he wanted to leave. The move had been a mistake, but then it became clear the transfer back to Barcelona would not happen. His first campaign in Paris was ruined by a fractured metatarsal which meant he could not help PSG try to overturn a 3-1 first-leg deficit in their Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid. Fast forward to 2019 and a new foot injury forced him to miss both legs of the last-16 defeat by Manchester United. PSG lost on away goals after conceding a late penalty at home in the second leg. Neymar, watching on, took to Instagram to insult the referee and received a three-match ban. He did not appear again in a Champions League game for PSG until a 2-2 draw against Real last November. By which time he had accepted his situation and knuckled down. Now he is central to everything PSG are doing. He is happy too, especially alongside Kylian Mbappe. ""We are more or less the same age and we have a laugh together off the pitch. We hit it off straight away,"" says Mbappe, who is 21. ""We respect each other, we have a lot of fun. We are also less focused on ourselves now and more worried about the other guys around us, because we understand that we need everyone else to be able to win. We can't do it with just the two of us."" Neymar scored in both legs against Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 and cried afterwards. He was excellent against Atalanta in the quarter-finals and magnificent against RB Leipzig in the semi-finals, even if he did not score in either game. PSG will hope Neymar -- who has scored 70 times altogether in 84 matches for them -- has been saving his next goal for the final. ""I hope that the good lord will help him to score on Sunday and us to win,"" said his compatriot Thiago Silva."
126,20/08/2020,19:40,Italian Orsato to referee Champions League final,"Italian referee Daniele Orsato will take charge of the Champions League final between Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich, UEFA announced Thursday.","Sunday's showpiece at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon will be the first European final for the 44-year-old official, who has been an international referee since 2010. Orsato will be assisted by his compatriots Lorenzo Manganelli et Alessandro Giallatini. Orsato is no stranger to Paris Saint-Germain. Last season, he refereed the French side's 2-0 victory at Manchester United in the round of 16 -- though PSG were ultimately knocked out on the away goals rule. This season, he has officiated in eight Champions League matches, including the last 16 first leg between Real Madrid and Manchester City."
127,20/08/2020,13:47,Matthaeus warns Bayern to defend deeper against fleet-footed PSG,Germany legend Lothar Matthaeus warned Bayern Munich to defend deeper in Sunday's Champions League final against Paris Saint Germain or risk blowing the treble.,"After demolishing Barcelona 8-2 in the quarter-finals, Bayern endured a nervous start to Wednesday's 3-0 semi-final win over Lyon, who wrecked havoc early on by getting in behind the Germans' defence. ""Bayern had a harder time against Lyon than against Barcelona,"" former Bayern midfielder and West Germany captain Lothar Matthaeus said on Wednesday. ""If they play like that on Sunday, they won't win the Champions League or live up to the role as favourites. ""Paris have more quality than Barcelona and Lyon, they also have enough players who can put the ball into the key spaces."" Lyon squandered golden chances when quick passes into space initially forced Bayern onto the back foot. Memphis Depay fired wide and Toko Ekambi hit the post for Lyon in the opening 15 minutes before Serge Gnabry calmed Munich nerves with two first-half goals. A late Robert Lewandowski header sealed the win to extend Bayern's winning streak to 21 matches. Bayern's ability to score is without question after racking up 42 goals in 10 European matches, 15 of which by Lewandowski, the Champions League's top-scorer, while Gnabry is on nine. Yet their defence struggled on occasion, raising concerns what PSG's forwards Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Angel Di Maria could do with space to exploit. ""In attack, they still have their quality, but at the back they need to be more stable,"" said Matthaeus. ""Maybe against Paris they shouldn't defend so high, because Paris will use the speed of Neymar and Mbappe"". Bayern's head coach agreed with Matthaeus. ""We were lucky to hold out in the first phase of the match,"" admitted Hansi Flick, who seemed more relieved than euphoric to reach the final. ""We'll have to see that we organise the defence a little differently. ""Our great strength is pressuring on the opponent and I think that we will succeed against Paris as well."" Centre-back David Alaba saids Bayern's pressing game - forcing opponents into mistakes in their own half - carries a certain risk, but they can adapt against PSG. ""Of course, we play a game which always carries a high risk because we stand so high (up the pitch),"" said the Austria defender. ""You can't defend every ball, we will look at the (Lyon) game and make our analysis."" Specialist German magazine Kicker described Bayern as ""a giant with feet of clay"" on Thursday, pointing to Thiago Alcantara's poor pass that led to Depay's chance and Alphonso Davies' lapse in concentration before Ekambi hit the post. Joshua Kimmich was guilty of poor positioning on occasions, but Benjamin Pavard could replace him at right-back against PSG after recovering from injury. Bayern's back four will be under pressure to cope with the Parisians' pace, especially centre-backs Alaba and Jerome Boateng, who came off against Lyon with a leg knock. Former Bayern and France defender Bixente Lizarazu spelt out how to counter PSG's attack. ""When Mbappe is there, the opposing defence moves back twenty metres. That changes everything,"" said Lizarazu, 50, who won six Bundesliga titles in Munich. ""You have to know how to defend deep and not everyone knows how to do that."""
128,20/08/2020,00:31,"Bayern must tighten defence against PSG in Champions League final, warns Flick",Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick says the treble-chasing Germans need to tighten their defence against Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's Champions League final after some nervous early moments in their 3-0 semi-final win over Lyon.,"Flick's side made a shaky start on Wednesday in Lisbon as Lyon captain Memphis Depay fired wide, then Karl Ekambi hit the post before man-of-the-match Serge Gnabry settled Bayern's nerves with two first-half goals. Robert Lewandowski headed home his 15th Champions League goal of the season two minutes from the final whistle as Bayern claimed a record-equalling 10th straight win in Europe. ""Lyon fought hard and made things hard for us, we know PSG have quick players and we will have to organise our defence differently,"" said Flick, whose side scored 42 goals in 10 Champions League games to reach the final. ""Paris are a great team, they fought their way into the semi-final and then reached the final. ""We know they have quick players, but we know our biggest strength is putting our opponents under pressure."" Having already lifted the Bundesliga shield and German Cup this season, Bayern captain Manuel Neuer is relishing the chance of also lifting the Champions League trophy. Victory over PSG would seal only the second treble in Bayern's history after their 2013 triple success. Neuer expects a busy night against a star-studded PSG attack boasting Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Angel di Maria. ""Paris has an attack with big names. There are always a lot of goals with Bayern and PSG,"" said Germany goalkeeper Neuer. ""Two great teams in this final, it will be a good game for the fans to watch. ""We are very happy to be in the final. He added: ""The difference compared to 2013 team is that the squad is larger. ""We won in 2013 with fewer players, now we have a fantastic group with a good atmosphere in the squad. There are also no killjoys."" For Canadian teenager Alphonso Davies, reaching the Champions League final at the age of 19 is a ""dream come true."" Having already helped inflict misery on his hero Lionel Messi in the 8-2 quarter-final drubbing of Barcelona, Davies is delighted to now face Neymar and PSG. ""It's everything you can ask for,"" said Davies. ""It feels good, everyone's happy and playing well."" Davies says his Bayern team-mates ""have basically won everything, but they're still excited. They're still hungry to win this one."" The teenager expects the goals to fly come Sunday. ""Paris are a good team and it's going to be a good game, there's going to be goals in it,"" he said. ""This is what you dream of as a footballer - playing against the best in Europe. I'm excited."""

""We showed our quality, our hunger, determination. A good mix which showed we deserved the win. ""The team showed once again the hunger two win, to play together, to suffer. They made the most of it."" PSG's easy 3-0 win over RB Leipzig at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon showed all the composure on a big European occasion that they have lacked in recent seasons. Tuchel's outfit have set up a meeting with either on-fire Bayern Munich or fellow French side Lyon in Sunday's final, which could see the Qatari-owned club finally realise their owners' ambitions. ""I felt the pressure before the game, it wasn't easy, I have players who love the pressure of key matches I'm never relaxed,"" said Tuchel. ""We know well that Bayern are the favourites, it will be difficult against Lyon, but we'll see. It's obviously the biggest challenge of my career."""
130,17/08/2020,15:56,'No coincidence': German coaches dominate Champions League semis,Bayern Munich boss Hansi Flick is hoping for a rendezvous with compatriots Julian Nagelsmann or Thomas Tuchel in Sunday's Champions League final as three German coaches contest the last four for the first time.,"Having demolished Barcelona 8-2 in Friday's jaw-dropping quarter-final, Bayern now face French side Lyon on Wednesday for a place in the final. The other berth will be decided when Flick's fellow German coaches Nagelsmann and Tuchel go head-to-head in Tuesday's other semi-final between RB Leipzig and Paris Saint-Germain. ""Of course I am happy for Thomas and Julian"", said Bayern coach Flick. ""We'll try to meet one of them in the final."" Should Bayern and Leipzig both progress, it would set up the first all-German Champions League final since 2013, when the Bavarians beat Dortmund 2-1 at Wembley Stadium. ""This shows that we are training good coaches,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told Sky Sports Italia. ""Two German teams haven't come this far in years."" Coincidentally, Leipzig coach Nagelsmann, PSG boss Tuchel and Flick all turned to coaching after injuries prematurely ended their playing careers. Nagelsmann, 33, who was barely out of his teens when a knee injury ended his playing career in 2008, has steered Leipzig to the Champions League semis for the first time in the club's short history in his debut season in charge. Under 46-year-old Tuchel, PSG are in the last four for the first time since 1995. Flick, who made 100 appearances as a midfielder for Bayern and won the Bundesliga title four times between 1986 and 1990, has excelled in just under 10 months in charge. The 55-year-old has seen Bayern win all six Champions League games since replacing Niko Kovac in late 2019. Under Flick, Bayern have won their last 20 games with Friday's demolition of Barcelona the stand-out result of this season's competition. Flick was also assistant coach when Germany won the 2014 World Cup, which included a jaw-dropping 7-1 win over hosts Brazil in the semi-finals. He is on the verge of winning Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League titles for Bayern in a single season, which would be the first time since Jupp Heynckes' treble feat in 2013. ""I know from personal experience how it feels to reach a semi-final,"" said Flick. ""You are among the best teams in Europe, so you are very happy."" As Jurgen Klopp steered Liverpool to both the 2018 and 2019 Champions League finals, for the third season in a row there will be at least one German coach in Sunday's final. ""We should be happy that a few German coaches are in the top four in Europe. It's a nice thing,"" said Nagelsmann. Three Germans coaches in the last four is tribute to the work done behind the scenes by the Association of German Football Coaches (BDFL), whose demanding courses consistently produce high-quality coaches. ""It's certainly no coincidence,"" BDFL President Lutz Hangartner told AFP subsidiary SID. ""It's rather proof that the training of coaches in Germany is very good."" Nagelsmann, the youngest coach in history to reach a Champions League semi-final, ""enjoyed a good coaching education"" thanks to the German Football Association (DFB). However, he says while a trio of German coaches in the semi-finals is unusual, his countryman have often been in charge at the business end of the Champions League. ""I remember what was written when German football was in the doldrums,"" he said after no Bundesliga club reached the Champions League quarter-finals last season. ""Now everything is good again? ""That's not how it is. You shouldn't live in extremes -- but you can enjoy the moment."""
131,17/08/2020,15:55,"Mbappe ready to start for PSG against Leipzig, says Tuchel","Kylian Mbappe is fit to start for Paris Saint-Germain against RB Leipzig in Tuesday's Champions League semi-final in Lisbon, coach Thomas Tuchel has confirmed.","""He played for 30 minutes against Atalanta and had no reaction. He has had six days since then to work on his fitness, so of course he can start,"" Tuchel told reporters during a virtual press conference on the eve of the game. He added: ""We will decide after training whether he can play 90 minutes."" Mbappe started on the bench in the quarter-final against Atalanta after spending the weeks leading up to that match struggling with an ankle injury. But the France superstar had a major impact as PSG came from behind to win 2-1 at the Estadio da Luz, setting up Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting for the decisive goal in stoppage time. The club from the French capital are now through to their first Champions League semi-final since 1995. ""We are living in the moment. We deserve to be here because we have had an extraordinary season,"" said Tuchel, whose team won a domestic treble in France. ""We are absolutely ready, the hunger is there, but this is not a historic moment, it is a semi-final and we are here to make the most of all the hard work we have put in and to win it."" While Mbappe is in line to start the game, Angel Di Maria can also return after serving a suspension against Atalanta. However, PSG have selection problems elsewhere. Goalkeeper Keylor Navas, previously a Champions League winner with Real Madrid, is out with a thigh injury after coming off hurt late in the quarter-final. Spaniard Sergio Rico is therefore set to replace him. In addition, midfielder Idrissa Gana Gueye is a major doubt, according to the club, because of a muscle injury."
132,17/08/2020,03:15,"Leizpig's Nagelsmann faces Tuchel reunion after besting Mourinho, Simeone","Having already outwitted Jose Mourinho and Diego Simeone in the Champions League, RB Leipzig boss Julian Nagelsmann now faces Paris Saint-Germain and Thomas Tuchel, who helped spark his coaching career 12 years ago, in Tuesday's semi-final.","The 33-year-old Nagelsmann is the youngest coach to reach the last four of the Champions League, underlining his reputation as one of Germany's brightest tacticians in Leipzig's first appearance in the competition's knockout phase. Nagelsmann got the better of Simeone's Atletico Madrid in a 2-1 victory Thursday, claiming another famous scalp following the disposal of Mourinho's Tottenham -- last year's runners-up who were beaten home and away in the last 16. Next up is PSG and fellow German Tuchel, under whom Nagelsmann took his first steps into coaching for Augsburg's reserves in 2008 after a persistent knee injury forced him to retire aged just 20. ""Of course I was his player, but that was many years ago,"" said Nagelsmann, a decent centre-back in his youth. ""I'm more into the day-to-day business now, just like him."" As coach of his ex-club Hoffenheim, Nagelsmann lost twice and drew against Tuchel, then in charge of Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga between 2016 and 2017. ""Matches against him are always interesting, because he has a good idea about football,"" added Nagelsmann. ""I have often played (as a coach) against him (Tuchel) but rarely won. That should change now,"" he added. ""It's clear the quality they (PSG) have - Angel Di Maria will be back and (Kylian) Mbappe will be fit enough to start. ""We will need a top performance to reach the final."" A knee injury cut short his playing career in 2008, ""otherwise I would have needed an artificial knee when I was 40,"" said Nagelsmann. Barely out of his teens, he was offered a scouting role by his Augsburg reserves coach Tuchel. ""It was a pragmatic decision - since Augsburg were still paying me, I spotted opponents for Tuchel,"" Nagelsmann said in a 2015 interview. The pair have ""never been extremely close"", revealed Nagelsmann. ""He wasn't my mentor, even if many refer to him as one. ""Our relationship was too pragmatic for that, but I am grateful for him giving me the idea to become a coach."" Tuchel went onto to work at Mainz and Dortmund, who he steered to the 2017 German Cup title before joining PSG in 2018 and winning back-to-back French league titles. All the while, Nagelsmann gained experience coaching youth teams at Augsburg, 1860 Munich and Hoffenheim before moving to Leipzig in 2019. After coaching their Under-17 team, Nagelsmann rose up the ranks in Hoffenheim. He became the youngest head coach in Bundesliga history in February 2016, aged just 28, when Hoffenheim were second from bottom in the table, but he kept them up to earn the accolade of Germany's coach of the year. Under Nagelsmann, Hoffenheim managed top-four finishes in the following two seasons, earning a debut Champions League campaign in 2018/19 but making a group-stage exit. He turned unfancied Hoffenheim into a side capable of twice beating mighty Bayern Munich, the icing on the cake being a 2-0 away win at the Allianz Arena in 2017. Success with Hoffenheim attracted Red Bull-backed RB Leipzig, who Nagelsmann joined before the start of this season, finishing third in the Bundesliga. Now more than a decade after their time in Augsburg's reserves, Tuchel and Nagelsmann clash for a place in next Sunday's Champions League final. However, the Champions League is ""not about duels against Mourinho, Simeone or now against Tuchel,"" insisted Nagelsmann. ""It's a team sport, and the team (Leipzig) has played outstandingly well."" Nagelsmann believes PSG's quarter-final win over Atalanta lifted ""a heavy burden"" off Tuchel who was under pressure to make the last four. ""I'm happy for him."" However, any cordial exchange with Tuchel before kick-off will merely be a facade, Nagelsmann insists. ""That's what the media would like to see, but that doesn't exist in the real football world."""
133,17/08/2020,03:10,Qatar versus Red Bull -- a Champions League semi-final for the 21st century,Either Paris Saint-Germain or RB Leipzig will reach the Champions League final for the first time this midweek but the prospect of these hugely ambitious clubs clashing in the last four in Lisbon may be a turn-off for many football fans.,"When UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin spoke to AFP last week about the future of elite European football, he observed that the sport had become ""a different thing to what it was 10 years ago, let alone 20 years ago"". Ceferin was speaking specifically about the need to change the Financial Fair Play rules after Manchester City's successful appeal against a two-year Champions League ban. But his point was about much more than that. Ten years ago Inter Milan won the Champions League, beating Bayern Munich in the final. Bayern had defeated Lyon in the last four. Those teams meet again in the semis on Wednesday after Lyon's unexpected success against City, who have not yet made the Champions League final 12 years on from the Abu Dhabi takeover of the club. Also in 2010, PSG won the French Cup but finished 13th in Ligue 1. They were going nowhere fast. Leipzig, meanwhile, had just made their way up to the fourth tier of German football. In 2011, PSG were bought by the state-funded Qatar Sports Investments and have gone on to trample over the competition in France, winning Ligue 1 in seven of the last eight years. They paid the two biggest transfer fees in history to sign Neymar and Kylian Mbappe in 2017 and it is a wonder it has taken them this long to reach a Champions League semi-final again, 25 years after their first and last appearance. ""It is very special. It is the first time we have made it to the semi-finals. It is history for the club,"" said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi after their quarter-final win over Atalanta, a remark that gave the impression it was a different club that lost to AC Milan in the 1995 semis. In most ways it was. PSG are now the fifth richest club in world football, according to Deloitte's Football Money League. Their revenue in 2018/19 was 635.9 million euros ($753 million). Fans of other clubs sometimes laugh about PSG lacking tradition, given they were only founded in 1970. But they are veritable old-timers compared to Leipzig. The German club was only founded in 2009 when energy drinks giant Red Bull bought the licence of fifth-division minnows SSV Markranstadt, creating RasenBallsport Leipzig. 'RasenBallsport' is a fabricated German word, a way of getting around Red Bull's problem that, under German Football League (DFL) rules, a team may not carry a sponsor's name. They also navigated their way around the DFL's so-called '50+1' rule in place to prevent any individual having a controlling stake in a club. Red Bull, founded by Austrian billionaire Dietrich Mateschitz, owns 49 percent, with the remaining 51 percent owned by company employees. Even before they first appeared in the Bundesliga in 2016, Leipzig were hated by supporters of other clubs. Dynamo Dresden fans threw a severed bull's head onto the pitch during a game between the teams. Borussia Dortmund fans have boycotted matches against Leipzig in protest at the club's ownership structure. Unlike PSG, Leipzig's footballing model places the emphasis on signing and developing talented youngsters. Nevertheless, cult German football magazine 11Freunde responded to Leipzig's quarter-final win over Atletico Madrid by saying it would not cover their semi-final. ""RB Leipzig is a pure marketing project. Created solely to strengthen the Red Bull brand,"" it wrote, calling the club ""an imitation"". The Red Bull stable also owns Salzburg, who also appeared in this season's Champions League, New York Red Bulls, and Red Bull Bragantino, who have just reached Brazil's top flight. In Leipzig, RB have at least revived a tradition of footballing success -- Lokomotiv Leipzig, a leading club in the old East Germany, were UEFA Cup semi-finalists in 1974 and Cup Winners' Cup runners-up in 1987. Both PSG and RB Leipzig are now within touching distance of the Champions League final, but neutral support could be thin on the ground."

Spain's Sergio Rico, who has played just nine games this season, is set to start in Lisbon after having replaced three-time Champions League winner Navas against the Italians. Midfielder Idrissa Gueye is a doubt for the club's first top-tier semi-final since 1995 but Marco Veratti, Thiago Silva and Layvin Kurzawa took part in training despite suffering various problems. Ander Herrera, Leandro Paredes and Marquinhos are coach Thomas Tuchel's options to take the Senegal international's place."
135,13/08/2020,03:33,PSG break through Champions League glass ceiling after years of disappointment,"After years of failing to live up to their billing in Europe, Paris Saint-Germain are within 90 minutes of the Champions League final thanks to their dramatic win over Atalanta on Wednesday, and coach Thomas Tuchel now knows ""everything is possible"" for his team.","PSG were on the verge of another disappointing Champions League exit as they trailed Atalanta 1-0 into the 90th minute in Lisbon, where all the latter stages are being played after the long coronavirus shutdown. But Mario Pasalic's 27th-minute strike for the Italians was finally cancelled out by Marquinhos, who scrambled in a last-gasp leveller. Then, three minutes into injury time, Kylian Mbappe set up fellow substitute Eric Choupo-Moting to convert the clinching goal. ""The goals came very late but we deserved the victory. We never stopped believing or attacking,"" said Tuchel, whose team will face Atletico Madrid or RB Leipzig in the semi-final, the club's first since 1995. ""The boys who came off the bench had a big impact. We deserved it, we made our own luck."" The money ploughed into the French champions by their Qatari owners has increased the pressure on PSG to deliver and losing to Atalanta would have invited more criticism of a club whose recent record in such games has been poor. After all, Atalanta's entire wage bill is believed to be equivalent to what PSG pay Neymar per year (about 36 million euros, or $42.5m). Absent from decisive Champions League games in the last two seasons because of injuries, Neymar was excellent here, never giving up. He set up the equaliser and played a part in the winner. ""Going home never crossed my mind,"" said the world's most expensive player. Mbappe was only fit enough to play the final half-hour, after a spell on the sidelines with an ankle injury, but his pace down the left flank had Atalanta on the back foot in the closing stages and he laid on the winner. PSG will be hopeful the France star can start the semi-final next Tuesday, but it is thanks to Choupo-Moting that they are there at all. ""We've already won four titles this season but the most important is this one,"" declared the Cameroon striker. It seems ironic that PSG -- the world's fifth-richest club according to this year's Deloitte Football League -- needed to rely on a free transfer from Stoke City to take them through to the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since the Qatari takeover in 2011. They had gone out in the last 16 the past three years, but Choupo-Moting's goal saw them break through the glass ceiling on the same day PSG marked their 50th anniversary. From Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Ronaldinho, some fabulous players have turned out for the club in their relatively short history, although Choupo-Moting has not made much of a mark in his two seasons in Paris. He had not previously scored in the Champions League and would probably have been best remembered for missing an open goal while standing on the line in a game against Strasbourg. Indeed he would not even have been playing in this match in different circumstances. Choupo-Moting's contract expired in June but he agreed to stay on for two months to play a part in the 'Final Eight' after Edinson Cavani -- PSG's all-time top scorer, who was also out of contract -- walked away. And so the 31-year-old came on for the ineffective Mauro Icardi for the closing stages. He will at best have a bit-part role to play in the semi-final, though. Mbappe could be ready to start then and Angel Di Maria will return from suspension, although Marco Verratti will probably be out again injured. ""There is a big difference between playing with or without Kylian,"" Tuchel said. ""That's clear, and it's the same with Marco and Angel. Now we have six days for Kylian to get back to his best. ""I'm not sure about Marco, but we are in the last four, everything is possible."""

""I must say that there is great regret, we came very close, it was very close. It looked as it we could do it, pull off a great achievement,"" Gasperini said to Sky Sport. ""We can take satisfaction from the experience, our Champions League growth. It looked as if we had done it."" Wednesday's defeat was the cruellest way to end what has nonetheless been another remarkable season for the side from Bergamo, one of the worst-hit cities during the coronavirus pandemic. Traditionally an also-ran, Atalanta finished third in Serie A for the second season in a row and enchanted fans across Europe with flamboyant football that led to them scoring 98 times in the Italian top flight. However once Kylian Mbappe was introduced in the second half PSG began to turn the screw and Atalanta eventually gave way. ""Mbappe's coming into the game, combined with the presence of Neymar, changed things for PSG,"" Gasperini told reporters in the post-match press conference. ""His entry gave an energy to PSG who were losing the match, it was fundamental because of what he brought to the game. ""The equaliser, above all, leaves us with some bitterness. But PSG has a good chance of reaching the final."""
137,12/08/2020,23:41,Neymar insists PSG always knew they could win after Atalanta triumph,Brazilian superstar Neymar insisted that Paris Saint-Germain always believed they could come back from the brink to defeat Atalanta with two goals in the dying moments of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday.,"""I never thought of going home. From start to finish, from the warm-up, we only thought of qualifying for the semi-finals,"" the world's most expensive footballer told RMC Sport. Substitute Eric Choupo-Moting's goal three minutes into added time allowed PSG to beat the Italian outsiders 2-1. Mario Pasalic gave Atalanta a 27th-minute lead but PSG were rescued when Marquinhos came forward to scramble in a last-minute equaliser. Kylian Mbappe set up fellow substitute Choupo-Moting to win the tie right at the end. The French champions will play RB Leipzig or Atletico Madrid next Tuesday for a place in the final. ""Nobody is going to take my mind off that I want to go to the final,"" added 28-year-old Neymar as PSG made the last-four for the first time since 1995. ""We really have a great group, we're a family, we know that with this state of mind it's impossible. to put us out of competition. ""We knew that a ball could arrive, that even after the equaliser we could score a second goal."" Neymar hailed Atalanta, the team which captured the imagination of neutrals, reaching this stage despite their city of Bergamo being one of the worst hit by the coronavirus. ""Atalanta are a great team, they played very well, they are the surprise of the competition. They were very aggressive, we knew they were going to press us,"" said Neymar. ""Now we're going to have to rest, it was a tough game mentally. ""Another very difficult match is coming."""
138,12/08/2020,23:40,Choupo-Moting the hero as PSG stun Atalanta to reach Champions League semis,Paris Saint-Germain snatched a dramatic victory from the jaws of defeat as substitute Eric Choupo-Moting's goal three minutes into added time allowed them to beat Atalanta 2-1 in their Champions League quarter-final in Lisbon on Wednesday.,"Atalanta were on the brink of extending their remarkable run on into the last four after Mario Pasalic gave the Italians a 27th-minute lead in the first game of the 'Final Eight' at an empty Estadio da Luz. But PSG were rescued as Marquinhos came forward to scramble in a last-minute equaliser and they did not even need extra time to complete the turnaround, with Kylian Mbappe setting up fellow substitute Choupo-Moting to win the tie right at the end. ""When I came on I said to myself, 'we can't lose, we can't go home like that'. The rest is history,"" said Choupo-Moting, who signed a two-month contract extension to stay at PSG for the 'Final Eight' after his deal expired in June. The French champions' reward is a place in the semi-finals of Europe's elite club competition for the first time since 1995. They will play RB Leipzig or Atletico Madrid next Tuesday for a place in the final. It is the first time PSG have gone beyond the last eight of the Champions League since the Qatari takeover of the club almost a decade ago and all the huge investment that has followed. ""Going home never crossed my mind,"" said Neymar. ""From beginning to end, right from the warm-up, qualifying for the semi-finals was all we thought about. I want to go to the final and nobody will stop me thinking about that."" The result is heartbreaking for Atalanta, who were hoping to continue their fairytale campaign for at least a few more days and give the people of Bergamo more reason to cheer. The northern Italian city suffered terribly at the height of the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year. Bergamo's death toll from COVID-19 has made it one of the worst-hit regions anywhere during the health crisis. ""We came very close. It looked as it we could do it,"" said Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini. This will still go down as a highly successful season for Gasperini's team, who scored eight goals over two legs to beat Valencia in the last 16 in March. That tie was completed just before football across Europe ground to a halt in the face of the pandemic, but Atalanta have since come back to finish third in Serie A for the second year running, scoring 98 goals in the process. Beating PSG was ultimately a step too far, but that Atalanta came so close is remarkable enough. After all, their annual wage bill is believed to be equivalent to what PSG pay Neymar alone. It was because of the pandemic that UEFA decided to bring the Champions League to Lisbon for a straight knockout tournament from the quarter-finals onwards, with all ties one-off matches behind closed doors. PSG therefore knew they would get no second chance to turn the tie around and coach Thomas Tuchel's gamble on Mbappe's fitness ultimately paid off. Mbappe was left in a race against time to make this match after spraining his ankle in the French Cup final against Saint-Etienne on July 24. He was only deemed fit enough to come on for the final 30 minutes, with PSG already diminished without the injured Marco Verratti and the suspended Angel Di Maria. Neymar was there, but the world's most expensive player failed to take a glorious early chance, shooting wide with only Atalanta goalkeeper Marco Sportiello to beat after bursting through on goal. Instead it was Atalanta who broke through just before the half-hour mark as Pasalic fired home first-time from 15 yards after the ball fell to him in the box. Berat Djimsiti might have made it 2-0 on 58 minutes, but then Mbappe came on and PSG stepped up the pressure. The French side lost goalkeeper Keylor Navas to injury late on and looked to be down and out until Marquinhos bundled in a Neymar assist from close range in the 90th minute, the ball going in off Mattia Caldara's leg. And Choupo-Moting then grabbed the dramatic winner. Neymar supplied Mbappe and his low ball across the face of goal was converted by Choupo-Moting, often derided as not good enough for PSG but this time their hero."

140,12/08/2020,05:00,Champions League 'Final Eight' kicks off as PSG and Atalanta clash in Lisbon,"Four months behind schedule because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Champions League has reached the quarter-final stage with Paris Saint-Germain taking on outsiders Atalanta in Lisbon on Wednesday in the first game of the 'Final Eight'.","A straight knockout final tournament held in one place, akin to a World Cup or European Championship, was the only solution available to UEFA in order to complete its most lucrative club competition, suspended for five months from March until last weekend. Two-legged quarter-finals and semi-finals have been done away with, and all eight teams have come to Lisbon, where they are following strict health guidelines including regular testing. No spectators are allowed inside stadiums. PSG will therefore meet Atalanta at an empty Estadio da Luz on Wednesday at 1900 GMT, with the winners advancing to a semi-final against either Atletico Madrid or RB Leipzig, who play on Thursday. The other quarter-finals are Barcelona against Bayern Munich -- the only clubs still in the competition to have won it before -- and Manchester City against Lyon. The final will be on August 23, and UEFA can only hope there is no widespread outbreak of COVID-19 among any of the teams which could threaten the tournament. European football's governing body has said that as long as a team has 13 healthy players including a goalkeeper, matches must go ahead, otherwise teams risk forfeiting matches. There was a scare at the weekend when it was revealed two Atletico players had tested positive, but their squad has travelled to Portugal and their game is set to go ahead. Before that match, PSG will look to reach the semi-finals for the first time since the Qatari takeover almost a decade ago and they were given a boost on the eve of their match against Atalanta as Kylian Mbappe was declared fit enough to play a part by coach Thomas Tuchel. ""If he trains well on Tuesday evening and nothing extraordinary happens, he will be in the team on Wednesday,"" Tuchel said. Mbappe was left in a race against time to be fit for the start of the 'Final Eight' after suffering a sprained ankle in PSG's French Cup final win over Saint-Etienne on July 24. Opponents Atalanta -- with an annual wage bill for their entire squad believed to be equivalent to Neymar's salary for the year at PSG -- are in the Champions League for the first time. The Italians are fresh from finishing third in Serie A and are spurred on by the terrible suffering of their home city of Bergamo at the peak of the pandemic earlier this year. ""There is extra motivation for us after what has happened. We have to represent our city in the best possible way and give the people something to smile about,"" said the Atalanta coach, Gian Piero Gasperini, on Tuesday. The final of this season's Champions League was initially due to be played in Istanbul in late May before it was postponed and this new format introduced. Usually such an event would see a huge influx of foreign fans but the atmosphere in Lisbon this time is rather different, even if some supporters have travelled and one study has estimated 16,000 will come in total over the next 10 days. ""The atmosphere is bizarre. The city seems empty and the bars close early,"" one Atalanta fan, who plans to watch the match in a bar, told AFP. Restrictions remain in place in and around Lisbon in an attempt to stop a resurgence of the virus. Those include limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people and banning alcohol consumption in public, while shops and cafes must close at 8:00pm, the time matches will kick off."

""There is extra motivation for us after what has happened. We have to represent our city in the best possible way and give the people something to smile about."" Bergamo, near Milan in northern Italy, was one of the worst hit regions in Italy when the coronavirus pandemic was at its peak earlier this year. At one point the army was called in to take away coffins because local morgues could not cope with the number of virus deaths. But on the field Atalanta are enjoying the best spell in their history. This is their first Champions League campaign but they have just finished third for the second year running in Serie A -- scoring 98 goals in the process in their 38 matches -- so will be back at Europe's top table again next season. ""We come into the game in great condition. Our league form has been great and allowed us to finish third again,"" added the 62-year-old. ""We have shown that without being a big club or having massive investment it is possible to do well in the Champions League with passion, good football and desire."" ""These are unlimited resources that are available to everyone."" Atalanta will go into the game at the Estadio da Luz without Josip Ilicic. The Slovenian scored all four goals in the 4-3 win at Valencia in the last 16 second leg that took Atalanta through 8-4 on aggregate but is missing here for personal reasons."
142,11/08/2020,21:37,Mbappe 'will be in team' for PSG against Atalanta,"Kylian Mbappe looks set to feature for Paris Saint-Germain in their Champions League quarter-final against Atalanta in Lisbon on Wednesday having made a good recovery from an ankle injury, his coach Thomas Tuchel said on the eve of the game.","""If he trains well on Tuesday evening and nothing extraordinary happens, he will be in the team on Wednesday,"" Tuchel told reporters. However, Tuchel did then suggest that Mbappe would most likely be used off the bench against the Italians. ""We are really pleased to have the possibility of finishing the match with Kylian on the pitch because that gives Neymar someone who likes playing alongside him,"" he said. Mbappe was left in a race against time to be fit for the start of the 'Final Eight' after suffering a sprained ankle in a crunching tackle early in PSG's French Cup final win over Saint-Etienne on July 24. The World Cup-winning France forward made his return to collective training at the weekend during PSG's training camp in Portugal's Algarve. Whether he starts or not, the announcement comes as a huge boost to the French champions as they aim to reach the semi-finals of Europe's elite club competition for the first time since the Qatari takeover almost a decade ago. Meanwhile, Tuchel refused to rule midfield maestro Marco Verratti out of the rest of the competition, should PSG go all the way. The final in Lisbon is scheduled for August 23 with the semi-final on August 18 if PSG qualify. Verratti is currently out with a calf injury. ""We must wait and be patient with Marco,"" said the German. ""Last week he couldn't run. He has just started again but it is going to be very tight for the semi-finals. But we will try everything like we have done with Kylian."""
143,11/08/2020,04:24,Is this Neymar's time in the Champions League? Injury-hit PSG hope so,"Paris Saint-Germain have once again been hit by a flood of injuries going into a crunch Champions League knockout tie, but this time Neymar is fit and seemingly ready to live up to his status as the world's most expensive player.","PSG face Atalanta in Lisbon on Wednesday in the first quarter-final of the 'Final Eight', after UEFA turned the latter stages of Europe's elite club competition into something akin to a World Cup after the long coronavirus shutdown. There will be no fans in the Estadio da Luz, but the French champions coped just fine behind closed doors when they beat Borussia Dortmund in their last 16, second leg in March. That night Neymar scored the opener in a 2-0 win as they overturned a first-leg deficit. After the game, the Brazilian sat on a step high up in the stands at the Parc des Princes and cried tears of joy. After all, his first two seasons in Paris following his 222 million-euro ($264 million) transfer from Barcelona were marred by injuries at the worst possible moments. First there was the broken metatarsal that saw him miss the last 16, second leg against Real Madrid in 2018 as PSG were knocked out by the reigning champions. And history repeated itself a year later, as another metatarsal injury forced him to miss the defeat against a mediocre Manchester United, when they contrived to throw away a 2-0 first-leg advantage. Since then, the much talked about move back to Barcelona has not happened and does not look likely to happen in the post-pandemic market. Wednesday's game comes a day short of three years after Neymar made his debut for PSG following that stunning, 222 million euros transfer from Spain. Aged 28, Neymar now finally seems settled in Paris and is in fine shape to lead his team against Atalanta as they look to progress to the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since the Qatari takeover in 2011. ""I think I'm having my best time since I came to Paris,"" he said in an interview with the club's website last week. And how PSG -- in the week they celebrate the 50th anniversary of the club's founding -- need him as coach Thomas Tuchel has all sorts of selection concerns elsewhere. His other superstar forward, Kylian Mbappe, is expected to be on the bench at best as he battles to shake off an ankle injury suffered in last month's French Cup final against Saint-Etienne. Angel Di Maria is suspended, while the club's all-time record goal-scorer, Edinson Cavani, left at the end of June when his contract expired. Ironically, he has been tipped to move to Lisbon to sign for Benfica. Perhaps most worryingly of all, midfield maestro Marco Verratti is out with a calf injury and reports claim the Italian would possibly not even be fit for the final should PSG make it. To top it all, Tuchel is on crutches too, the German coach breaking his fifth metatarsal and spraining his left ankle during a workout. But as long as Neymar is fit, PSG will remain hopeful of progressing to a semi-final next week against Atletico Madrid or RB Leipzig. ""We're a very strong team together, we've won four titles already this season, and I'm very happy to be the Paris Saint-Germain manager,"" Tuchel told PSG TV this week. ""It's a gift for me."""

PSG will not have superstar Kylian Mbappe available, but Atalanta look set to be without top scorer Josip Ilicic, who found the net 21 times in all competitions, including five in the Champions League. ""We miss Ilicic very much,"" said coach Gian Piero Gasperini. ""It was his season. Until February, he was the most decisive player in our forward line."" The 32-year-old Slovenian was on form until the coronavirus engulfed Italy and in particular the team's home city Bergamo, where at one point the army was called in to take away coffins because local morgues could not cope with the number of virus deaths. Illcic was overwhelmed by personal and psychological difficulties and has been sidelined for the team's final games of the season. But Atalanta's strength has been the number of players who have contributed to their all-competitions tally of 118 goals. Colombians Duvan Zapata and Luis Muriel have scored 19 each in total, with Mario Pasalic netting 11, mercurial Papu Gomez eight and Ruslan Malinovskyi nine. And the unpredictable nature of the season has given 'La Dea' (The Goddess) reason to dream despite the club having won just one major trophy, the 1963 Italian Cup, in its 112-year history. ""Atalanta belongs to the city and you feel part of this,"" said captain Gomez. ""We know we're a team from a city of about 100,000 people and not the big team of a capital. But we know where we are going and what we want. ""We've learned along the way, from the first match in the Champions League, when we conceded four against Dinamo Zagreb. ""We raised the level and now they're asking us for the Champions League. Achieving this goal is priceless."" Atalanta's transformation into Italian title contenders, with two third-place finishes in as many seasons, has been overseen by the club's billionaire owner Antonio Percassi, who played as a defender for the club. The 67-year-old took over as president in 2010 and working with his two sons he has lifted the club to new heights. ""It was not easy, but the last three years have gone beyond the most optimistic forecasts,"" said Percassi. ""It's our story, that of the entire 'Atalantina' family."" Gasperini's European campaign started disastrously, losing their first three group games and conceding 11 goals, but they bounced back to qualify for the knockout stages. Italy coach Roberto Mancini believes Atalanta have transformed the Italian game. ""They have a modern spirit and principles -- courage to dare, attacking style, search for dominance beyond the result,"" Mancini told Gazzetta Dello Sport. ""The top clubs in Europe all play with this mentality, but things are changing in Italy too, many coaches are more daring today, also thanks to Atalanta. ""They have shown that a certain type of football, as well as being beautiful, reaps results. ""They have everything to play the quarter-final with confidence."" Gasperini meanwhile will hope to follow Hector Cuper's Valencia, who two decades ago were surprise Champions League finalists, in the year of their third place league finish. Valencia lost to Real Madrid, but won La Liga the following season."
145,08/08/2020,10:01,Thiago Silva determined to go out on a high at PSG,Thiago Silva's eight years as a Paris Saint-Germain player are about to come to an end and the Brazilian centre-back has one piece of unfinished business to contend with as the Qatar-owned club head to Lisbon targeting Champions League glory.,"That is something that has so far eluded Silva and PSG, despite all the money Qatar Sports Investments have ploughed in. A humiliating collapse against Manchester United last season meant a third consecutive last-16 exit, but this time they are through to a first quarter-final since 2016 and face Atalanta in Lisbon on Wednesday. ""I have seen everything here. This competition is so important, for the players but also for the club. Winning it was the objective when I came here,"" Silva, whose contract is about to expire, said in an interview with AFP. The game is being played as a one-off tie behind closed doors in the Portuguese capital after UEFA were forced to rethink the tournament format due to the coronavirus pandemic. PSG secured qualification just before football ground to a halt in mid-March, as they overturned a 2-1 first-leg deficit by beating Borussia Dortmund 2-0. That game was played behind closed doors too but the PSG players celebrated their victory with thousands of fans who had gathered, somewhat irresponsibly, outside the ground. However, the outpouring of emotion was understandable after the disappointments of previous years, including the astonishing exit at the hands of Barcelona in 2017 despite winning the first leg 4-0. ""The game there (in Dortmund) was very difficult, we lost and thoughts went back to what happened last year against Manchester United, and our three consecutive eliminations before the quarters,"" Silva said. ""That was difficult to stomach but we knew what we wanted to do, to turn it around and qualify for the fans even though they weren't in the stadium."" Silva joined from AC Milan in 2012. He has been a cornerstone ever since in a side that has completely dominated French football, winning seven of the last eight Ligue 1 titles. Last weekend Silva played as PSG beat Lyon on penalties to win the League Cup and secure a fourth domestic treble in six seasons. But European success has not come so easily. ""It's not easy to stay in Paris for eight years. I am really happy with everything I have done here, how the supporters have come to respect me. It's magnificent,"" he said. ""I hope to end the adventure by winning the Champions League, that's the dream."" Silva has loved life in France so much that he has gone on to take French nationality but he was told in the spring that he had no future at the club beyond this season. The Brazilian international will be 36 next month and Leonardo, the club's sporting director, is looking to rebuild. Edinson Cavani, PSG's all-time record scorer, and Belgian right-back Thomas Meunier were also told they could leave. Both have already departed, with Meunier joining Dortmund. But Silva accepted the offer to extend his contract -- which initially expired in June -- by an extra two months to feature in the Champions League 'Final Eight'. ""I don't know the context for Meunier and Cavani but for me it was important to finish the season here,"" Silva added. ""I also know the players here and this year I feel we have a big opportunity to go all the way. ""The desire and the quality in the squad gives me that feeling. If I start something I want to finish it. I might win or lose but I will give everything to finish it well."" If PSG beat Atalanta they will meet either RB Leipzig or Atletico Madrid in the semi-finals. The final is on August 23. Beyond that, Silva has been linked with a return to Italy -- he spent three years at Milan -- or a move to Everton, coached by Carlo Ancelotti, under whom he played when he arrived in Paris. But you sense that he would still love to stay where he is. ""That depends on the club, it's not down to me,"" he said."
146,01/08/2020,13:28,PSG look forward to Champions League challenge after cup final wins,That match will be played on August 12 as a one-off tie behind closed doors in Lisbon.,"PSG have also had a handful of friendly matches, but Atalanta may be in better shape having resumed their Serie A campaign in June. They only finish the season this weekend. Herrera's team, meanwhile, looked sluggish for much of Friday's final, although the suffocating heat was partly responsible. They missed Kylian Mbappe, who was crocked in the French Cup final a week earlier, suffering an ankle injury that could rule him out against Atalanta. In his absence, Mauro Icardi was poor through the middle of the Paris attack and they only claimed victory thanks to Pablo Sarabia's sudden-death penalty in the shoot-out. ""We are optimistic for Kylian. We saw that he can walk now, he is young and he is a real professional,"" said Herrera. ""He really wants to play (against Atalanta) and is working every day, morning and night. ""Of course his presence is important and we hope he will play."" Mbappe is not the only worry -- defensive duo Marquinhos and Thiago Silva came off with cramp, while full-back Layvin Kurzawa hobbled off in the second half. In any case, PSG claimed their fourth domestic treble in six years, underlining the extent of their domination of French football under Qatari ownership. Lyon used to be top dogs but this defeat saw their silverware drought go on. They have not won a trophy since the French Cup in 2012, a year after the Qataris arrived and changed the footballing landscape in the country. Rudi Garcia's team, who had Brazilian defender Rafael sent off late in extra time, were a disappointing seventh when the league season was curtailed and will miss out on European football next season for the first time in 24 years. Unless, that is, they can go on and win the Champions League in Lisbon on August 23. OL visit Juventus next Friday in their long-delayed last 16 second leg, defending a 1-0 lead from the first leg. ""We will need to do better to score in Turin but this is a good base for us to work on,"" insisted Garcia. ""It is important that we keep our heads up and keep in mind the things we did well in order to go on and qualify for the Champions League quarter-finals."" If they do see off Juventus, they will face Manchester City or Real Madrid in the last eight."

Mbappe was left with a sprained right ankle after a crunching challenge from Saint-Etienne's Loic Perrin and looks certain to miss the game that really counts for the Qatar-owned club, the Champions League quarter-final against Atalanta on August 12. On Thursday, PSG coach Thomas Tuchel admitted it would take ""a miracle"" for the 21-year-old to recover in time for that game in Lisbon. Angel Di Maria has already been ruled out of that match because of suspension, and asked if there was any hope for Mbappe, Tuchel said: ""Yes, always, but it's going to be tight. Every day counts for us to produce a miracle."" PSG were handed a third straight Ligue 1 title by virtue of being top of the table when the season was ended in April with 10 rounds of matches unplayed because of the health crisis. They came out of the long shutdown to win their fifth French Cup in six years by beating Saint-Etienne 1-0 thanks to an early Neymar goal. That game was played in front of just 2,800 spectators inside the 80,000-seat Stade de France due to restrictions on gatherings. Friday's game against Lyon will go ahead in front of a similarly limited number of fans. Postponed in early April, it will be the last ever final of an unloved competition, albeit one which PSG have also dominated, with five successive victories -- and eight overall -- before Strasbourg won it last year. For both teams, it is a last chance to prepare in a competitive environment before resuming their Champions League campaigns. PSG head to Lisbon for the final stages after their win over Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 in March. Meanwhile, Lyon have to go to Italy on August 7 to face Juventus defending a 1-0 lead from the first leg of their last-16 tie played in February. Both clubs fear being at a disadvantage given all their Champions League rivals returned to complete their domestic seasons while France opted not to. Juventus and Atalanta play their final games in Serie A this weekend. However, Tuchel said the final cannot be used to prepare his team to face Atalanta. ""It is not possible to prepare tactically for Atalanta because I don't know any team that plays the way they do,"" said the German. ""The only thing we can prepare is our own mindset."" ""Being without Kylian has a big influence, that's clear. I hope we can find the solution."" The game will be played in searing heat, with temperatures in the French capital forecast to reach 40 degrees Celsius on Friday. Lyon are chasing a first piece of silverware in eight years and have extra motivation to win the trophy. Having failed to qualify for Europe next season via the league, Rudi Garcia's team have to beat PSG to secure a place in the qualifying rounds of the Europa League. If they fall short, they will need to win the Champions League in Lisbon on August 23 to feature in continental competition again next season. ""This is a terrific opportunity to win a trophy,"" said Garcia. ""PSG might be a level above us but we have a top-class team too and one that is also in a position to qualify for the Champions League quarter-finals. There is only positive pressure on us."" as-yk/pb <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org> <org>JUVENTUS FOOTBALL CLUB</org>"
148,27/07/2020,18:11,Mbappe out 'three weeks' and doubtful for Atalanta tie,"Kylian Mbappe will be sidelined for ""around three weeks"" after spraining his ankle in the French Cup final, likely ruling him out of Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League quarter-final against Atalanta on August 12.","The France forward limped off in the first half of Friday's 1-0 win over Saint-Etienne after a dreadful tackle that resulted in a red card for opposing captain Loic Perrin. PSG said Monday medical imaging had confirmed the initial test results of a sprained right ankle, with Mbappe also sustaining ligament damage. The club indicated the expected timeline for his return was ""around three weeks"", meaning he will miss Friday's French League Cup final against Lyon. The diagnosis also leaves Mbappe a huge doubt for PSG's resumption of their Champions League campaign, although the 21-year-old could be fit to return for the semi-finals if Thomas Tuchel's side advance. The latter stages of European club football's flagship competition will be played in a unique straight knockout tournament in Lisbon due to the difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic. PSG against Atalanta will be the first quarter-final of the 'Final Eight' mini tournament at the Estadio da Luz, with the semi-finals programmed for August 18-19 and the final to be held August 23."

""Everyone is worried. Everyone who saw the foul is worried. Of course I'm worried,"" said Tuchel after his team's 1-0 win. ""We have to be patient because we don't have any news. I think he will undergo tests tonight."" A tearful Mbappe was replaced by Pablo Sarabia but the greater concern for PSG will be the severity of his injury ahead of next month's Champions League quarter-final against Atalanta in Lisbon. He reemerged from the Stade de France tunnel later in the second half on crutches. ""It's the third game against Saint-Etienne and it's a third red card, each time in the first 30 minutes,"" added Tuchel. ""It's not all good news for us."" PSG face Lyon in the French League Cup final next Friday before resuming their European campaign in a unique straight knockout tournament at the Estadio da Luz on August 12. ""I hope Kylian is going to recover as quickly as possible because he's a vital player for us,"" said PSG captain Thiago Silva. Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini said he was ""sorry"" to hear of Mbappe's injury and hoped it was ""nothing serious"" ahead of next month's European clash. Saint-Etienne boss Claude Puel admitted the forward was simply too quick for the 34-year-old Perrin. ""I hope it's a minor injury for Kylian. The intention was to play the ball but it's true that he was too fast,"" said Puel."

PSG secured the first of a potential three trophies this summer, added a record-extending 13th French Cup to their list of honours with the League Cup final against Lyon to come next Friday before the resumption of their European campaign in Portugal. The final at the Stade de France was the first official match in one of Europe's top football nations to allow fans to attend since March, albeit in severely restricted numbers with just 2,805 spectators -- including President Emmanuel Macron -- inside the 80,000-seater venue. A minute's applause was held ahead of kick-off for the victims of COVID-19, which has claimed the lives of over 30,000 people in France, and in support of frontline workers. PSG had racked up 20 goals without reply in three friendlies building up to the final, but Yvann Macon's crunching tackle on Neymar in the first minute suggested no such goodwill would be afforded by Saint-Etienne in their first French Cup final appearance since 1982. The challenge set the tone for a fractious opening period and Denis Bouanga was inches from firing Saint-Etienne ahead when his strike rebounded back off Keylor Navas's left-hand post. Unfazed by that scare, PSG led on 14 minutes as Mbappe burst into the area after an exchange with Angel Di Maria and Neymar crashed home the rebound via the underside of the crossbar after a fine save from Jessy Moulin. Bouanga twice forced Navas to turn away while Moulin produced a sensational one-handed stop to tip over from Di Maria, earning plaudits from the Argentine himself. Saint-Etienne's hopes of fighting back were deeply hampered midway through the first half though when captain Loic Perrin, on likely his final appearance for the club, was sent off for a dreadful challenge on Mbappe. The World Cup winner required lengthy treatment but was forced off after his right ankle was trapped between the legs of Perrin, whose yellow card was upgraded to red following a VAR review.

The France star reemerged from the tunnel on crutches in the second half, with less than three weeks before PSG's Champions League tie against Atalanta on August 12. Moulin kept Saint-Etienne in with a remote shot of ending their 43-year wait for a seventh French Cup title, repelling Mauro Icardi and Di Maria before spreading himself superbly to deny Pablo Sarabia.

Unlike their last fixture on March 11, a 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund behind closed doors that sealed a place in the Champions League quarter-finals, a limited number of fans will be allowed to attend the French Cup final. The fixture at the Stade de France marks the return of French football, lagging well behind the rest of Europe's top leagues which eventually restarted despite the health crisis. PSG have shown little rustiness in dispatching a trio of friendly opponents -- Le Havre, Waasland-Beveren and Scottish champions Celtic -- with 20 goals scored and none conceded. For Saint-Etienne, the COVID-19 interruption allowed them to turn the page on a dismal league campaign in which they finished 17th -- a far cry from their fourth-placed effort in 2018-19. ""The goal was to avoid injuries and come into the final with fresh legs and clear minds. We're ready to play,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""It's a very important match after a long break. No team has ever done that. We want to win."" PSG captain Thiago Silva hopes to sign off on an eight-year spell at the club with a raft of trophies, having signed a short-term extension through August. ""The truth is I didn't want to leave but the decision has been taken and I respect it,"" said Silva, who has helped PSG to four of their record 12 French Cup triumphs. ""It's a different time to any other, it's historic and strange,"" he added. ""To stop for four months like that, it's not easy to then get back to the highest level."" Friday's showdown is a repeat of the 1982 final, won by PSG on penalties following a 2-2 draw in which Michel Platini scored twice for Saint-Etienne. It was PSG's first major title and also the last time Saint-Etienne reached the final. ""We're not favourites. Our goal is to enjoy ourselves, play our trump card and be in the match. I hope we let loose, we have nothing to lose,"" said Saint-Etienne boss Claude Puel. French President Emmanuel Macron will be in attendance as is tradition, but fewer than 5,000 spectators will be permitted at the 80,000-seater venue as part of stringent health regulations. Saint-Etienne supporters have said they will boycott the match after receiving an allocation of just 900 tickets. However, the occasion will provide Tuchel the chance to atone for last year's final defeat by Rennes in a penalty shootout, as PSG failed to win at least one of the two domestic cups for the first time since 2013. PSG return to the Stade de France on July 31 to face Lyon in the French League Cup final. They will then head to Lisbon to play Atalanta on August 12 in the quarter-finals of a Champions League 'Final Eight'. The tournament will be played in a straight knockout format due to the difficulties caused by the coronavirus, with PSG dreaming of a remarkable quadruple to celebrate the club's 50-year anniversary."

I'm part of the project for a fourth year,"" Mbappe, 21, told BeIn Sport during half-time of PSG's 4-0 win over Celtic in a friendly played in front of around 5,000 fans at the Parc des Princes. ""The club's 50-year anniversary is an important one in the eyes of the club, the supporters, of everyone, so I will be here whatever happens."" ""I'm going to try and bring back trophies with the team and give the best of myself,"" added Mbappe, who arrived at PSG from Monaco in 2017 in a deal worth 180 million euros ($208 million). Real Madrid have regularly been linked with a move for Mbappe, but club president Florentino Perez said last week the Spanish champions would not make any big signings this summer. ""Kylian has a contract with us, we're not ready to sell him. He is super important, he's a key player, our player. It's a gift to work with him,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""It's super. There's a really nice connection between him and Neymar. It makes it fun for everyone. It's a real strength for PSG. It's great like that."" Mbappe opened the scoring for PSG against the Scottish champions in the first minute after he was played in behind the Celtic defence by Neymar. The Brazil star added a second with a deflected effort on 25 minutes in PSG's final tune-up ahead of the French Cup final against Saint-Etienne on Friday. Ander Herrera made it 3-0 shortly after half-time and Pablo Sarabia grabbed a fourth with a sweetly-struck volley from Marco Verratti's lofted pass. PSG will make their return to competitive action at the Stade de France later this week as they bid for a record-extending 13th French Cup title. Tuchel's side qualified for the quarter-finals of the Champions League on March 11 before French football ground to a halt because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Ligue 1 season was declared over in April with PSG confirmed as champions for the seventh time in eight seasons. They will also face Lyon in the French League Cup final on July 31 before resuming their Champions League campaign in Lisbon, where they take on Atalanta for a spot in the last four."

""His main position is centre-back, but he can play in other positions. ""We are sure he will have a big career and will strengthen our squad."" The France Under-18 international is a product of the PSG academy, which he joined at 14. He made his professional debut this season and had 13 appearances for PSG, including two in the Champions League, when the French league season was halted in early March due to the coronavirus. ""I am very happy to be able to play for such a large and traditional club,"" said Kouassi after signing for Bayern. ""I could hardly wait to sign the contract. ""I really hope that I will do well here and I'll work hard to make that happen."" PSG head coach Thomas Tuchel has said he is ""sad"" to see the homegrown talent leave. Kouassi is the second signing Bayern have made for next season on a free transfer with Schalke goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel to rival club captain Manuel Neuer. According to UK and German media reports, Bayern will soon complete the signing of Leroy Sane from Manchester City with daily Bild reporting the fee will be at least ""50 million euros"" ($56 million)."

Left-back Kurzawa's contract extension comes just a day before it was due to expire, five years after his arrival from Ligue 1 rivals Monaco. Kurzawa, who made 24 appearances in all competitions this season, will be available to play in the French Cup and League Cup finals in July, as well as the 'Final 8' Champions League tournament in Lisbon in August. The 27-year-old has largely been deployed as a back-up to Spanish international left-back Juan Bernat, but received the backing of PSG coach Thomas Tuchel on Friday. ""Layvin has had a very good, reliable season. If we can have him and Juan we will be very strong in that position (left-back),"" Tuchel said. Kurzawa has played 123 times in all competitions for PSG since arriving five years ago, and has made 13 appearances for France, scoring one goal. PSG also announced that long-serving centre-back Thiago Silva, forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and back-up goalkeeper Sergio Rico have extended their deals until the end of the current season. That means the trio will also be able to play in the club's two Cup finals and the latter stages of the Champions League. The Ligue 1 season was ended early due to the coronavirus pandemic, with PSG crowned champions."

Jallet spent five seasons with PSG after joining from Lorient in 2009, helping the club to the league title in 2013 and 2014. He also won the French Cup and League Cup. The right-back then played three seasons with Lyon (2014-2017) before a two-year spell at Nice. He spent this past campaign at Amiens who were relegated after finishing 19th when the season was ended early in April. Jallet earned 16 caps for France and was twice named in the Ligue 1 team of the year."
157,25/06/2020,17:23,Dortmund confirm signing of PSG defender Meunier,Borussia Dortmund on Thursday confirmed the signing of Belgium defender Thomas Meunier on a four-year deal with no transfer fee after his deal with Paris Saint-Germain ran out.,"""Thomas Meunier is a player who has proven his quality at the highest level, including in the Champions League and with the national team over a long period of time,"" said Dortmund's sports director Michael Zorc. ""His experience will do us a lot of good."" The 28-year-old right back will link up with Belgian national team-mates Axel Witsel and Thorgan Hazard under Swiss head coach Lucien Favre. After four years in France, Meunier says he is looking for a new challenge with Dortmund, who have finished runners-up in the Bundesliga for the last two seasons. ""Borussia Dortmund plays exactly the kind of football I want to play: exciting, authentic and natural,"" said Meunier in a statement. ""I'm ambitious and I want to win titles with Dortmund just like I did with Brugge and Paris,"" he added having won three French League titles with PSG and the 2015/16 Belgian league. The transfer means that Meunier will not feature for PSG in the Champions League quarter-finals when the competition resumes this August in Lisbon. He faced Dortmund when PSG lost the first-leg clash 2-1 away in the last 16, but the French club went through after winning the return leg 2-0 in Paris, for which Meunier was suspended. Dortmund are reportedly also on the verge of signing England Under-17 prospect Jude Bellingham from Birmingham City."

Without having had the chance to celebrate, the Parisians return to training on Monday, over three months after their last game, the 2-0 defeat of Borussia Dortmund in their Champions League last 16, second leg. Their players have since spent months confined at home before having some time to take a holiday. PSG's rivals in England, Spain, Germany and Italy are back playing again. In contrast, Neymar returned to France last weekend after three months in Brazil and headed straight to join teammates Marco Verratti, Angel Di Maria, Leandro Paredes and Marquinhos in the glitzy Mediterranean resort of Saint-Tropez. Meanwhile, Kylian Mbappe posted photos of himself on Instagram along the coast in Monaco. They return this week to a club having to deal with the financial consequences of the pandemic and the early end to the season, with the resulting losses of ticketing and broadcast revenue. Within PSG, it is estimated they stand to lose over 200 million euros ($224m), an enormous hit even for a club ranked the fifth-richest in the world in the latest Deloitte Football Money League. That will probably ensure there are no headline-grabbing transfers coming soon, although they recently made Argentine striker Mauro Icardi's loan move from Inter Milan permanent for a reported fee of up to 58 million euros. The financial situation has also helped make up the mind of sporting director Leonardo over the futures of Thiago Silva and Edinson Cavani, two of the biggest figures of the Qatar era whose contracts expire this month and will not be retained. ""Maybe we are making a mistake, I don't know, there is never a perfect moment,"" Leonardo told Le Journal du Dimanche. It is hoped Brazilian defender Silva, the club captain, can be persuaded to stay to feature in the Champions League latter stages, but club record goal-scorer Cavani has reportedly opted to walk away at the end of June. The exodus will not stop there. Right-back Thomas Meunier, reportedly bound for Dortmund, will not stick around. Highly talented 18-year-old defender Tanguy Kouassi is expected to sign for Bayern Munich. However, the prospects of either Mbappe or Neymar leaving appear less than slim, given the financial challenges faced by PSG's European rivals. ""He is the future of PSG. That is what everyone wants. Ideally we would extend his contract,"" Leonardo said of Mbappe. What Mbappe and PSG want now is the Champions League, and after years of underachievement in Europe they are targeting glory when the competition is played out in a ""final eight"" straight knockout format in Lisbon. However, between now and a quarter-final somewhere between August 12 and 15, Thomas Tuchel's team will only have two competitive games, with the French Cup final against Saint-Etienne and League Cup final against Lyon both set to go ahead in late July. ""We have felt good ever since the season began. Unfortunately, we know what happened with the coronavirus and everything had to stop,"" Di Maria told sports daily L'Equipe. ""The other major leagues are restarting. That must not be an excuse but it does make things more difficult for us,"" he added. Like Lyon, PSG are therefore completely out of step with their Champions League rivals, although that could still work to their advantage. For example, Spanish and English clubs will have completed an exhausting dash to get their seasons finished in late July. Perhaps Mbappe, Neymar and their teammates will be fresher than ever and therefore primed to go on and win the final in Lisbon on August 23."

Coman was an unused member of Paris Saint-Germain's squad as a 16-year-old in 2013 and played just once for Juventus three years later. In 2015-2016 he had two domestic top-flight titles after featuring for Juve before joining Bayern during the same campaign. He can claim a third German Cup win in July as Bayern face Bayer Leverkusen in this year's final in Berlin.
161,13/06/2020,20:38,Out of contract pair Thiago Silva and Cavani to leave PSG,Paris Saint-Germain sporting director Leonardo has confirmed that veteran duo Thiago Silva and Edinson Cavani will not stay with the French champions with their contracts due to expire at the end of this month.,"""Yes, we are coming to the end,"" Leonardo said in an interview with newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche. ""It has been a very difficult decision to reach. These are players who have marked the history of the club and you wonder if you should carry on a little longer together or if it's best to avoid staying a year too long. ""We needed to make the right decision, including in economic terms and in terms of the next generation of players coming through."" It was widely reported earlier this week that Brazilian centre-back Silva, the PSG captain who turns 36 later this year, would not be kept on at the Parc des Princes, where he arrived from AC Milan in 2012. Silva's contract is due to expire at the end of this month, as is that of Uruguayan striker Cavani. Now 33, Cavani joined PSG from Napoli for 64 million euros in 2013 and has gone on to become the club's all-time top scorer with 200 goals. However, his place in the side came under threat following the arrival of Mauro Icardi on loan from Inter Milan at the start of the season. Silva and Cavani have played a major role in establishing PSG as the unrivalled force in French football, but their time at the club will also be remembered for disappointing results in Europe. PSG recently made Icardi's move permanent but the financial position of the Qatar-owned club has been seriously weakened by the decision to end the Ligue 1 season early, with 10 rounds of matches unplayed, because of the coronavirus pandemic. PSG were declared champions for the third year running but within the club it is estimated they stand to lose more than 200 million euros ($225 million), increasing the need to trim their enormous wage bill. ""Maybe we are making a mistake, I don't know, there is never a perfect moment,"" added the Brazilian Leonardo, who does nevertheless hope to extend the contracts of both players to allow them to take part in the latter stages of the interrupted Champions League. ""The idea is that they stay with us until the end of August, but how we do that is not clear yet."" Paris are through to the quarter-finals of Europe's elite club competition, which is set to be played to a finish in August. They must also still play the finals this summer of the French Cup, against Saint-Etienne, and the League Cup, against Lyon. Several other PSG players out of contract this summer, including full-backs Thomas Meunier and Layvin Kurzawa, and striker Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, are also set to leave the club."

PSG are looking to reduce their hefty wage bill with the club facing estimated losses of over 200 million euros ($226 million) after the Ligue 1 season was declared over in April due to the coronavirus pandemic. Silva, who joined PSG from AC Milan in 2012, could return to former club Fluminense in his homeland. He was pictured on Sunday holding a Fluminense member's card and team shirt with his name printed on the back. Silva won Ligue 1 seven times with PSG in addition to four French Cups and five French League Cups. PSG reached the quarter-finals of this season's Champions League before the competition was put on hold in March. FIFA has recommended expiring contracts be extended until the end of the current campaign."

It is my wish anyway,"" Noel Le Graet told AFP. ""We are in touch with the government. They might allow us to discuss having a limited number either for the start of next season, or for the Cup matches."" The season in Ligue 1 and the tiers below was ended early in late April at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, which has thus far claimed more than 29,000 lives in France. However, it is still hoped that both domestic Cup finals, postponed in April, can now be staged in August just before the planned start of next season, which has been delayed to the end of that month. Paris Saint-Germain are due to play Saint-Etienne in the French Cup final and Lyon in the League Cup final. Both matches are scheduled for the Stade de France, just outside Paris, which can accommodate 80,000 spectators when full. Meanwhile, Le Graet dismissed suggestions that this season's league competitions could still be restarted, a much-discussed subject in France as neighbouring countries start to resume playing. ""We follow the line of the government. There is no debate possible,"" he said, preferring to look ahead to the 2020-21 season. ""Our players will be better prepared and maybe even in better form than the rest, we'll see. ""In any case I have never questioned the decisions taken by the government. Priority to health rather than money."""
164,29/05/2020,12:27,Judge suspends Neymar's fine payment,"A Brazilian judge has suspended Neymar's payment of a fine of 88 million reais ($16.28 million) to tax authorities for irregularities, notably in connection with his transfer to Barcelona in 2013.","The judge, Decio Gabriel Gimenez, at a court in Sao Paulo, suspended the payment of the fine ""until further notice"", on the grounds that the exact amount due to be paid by Neymar was not clarified. According to Brazilian press reports, the state has already appealed the decision. In September 2015, the Brazilian Treasury froze 188.8 million reais of the player's assets, due to unpaid taxes linked to his image rights from 2011 to 2013. Neymar had left Brazilian side Santos for Barcelona in 2013. The fine was reduced in 2017 after a tax appeals council quashed two of the five convictions. The Paris Saint-Germain star, the world's most expensive footballer, agreed to pay a much smaller fine, before the treasury announced in 2018 that he still owed 88 million reais. Neymar's transfer from Santos to Barca attracted the attention of Spanish authorities, who prosecuted the now-28-year-old and the La Liga giants for ""fraud"" and ""corruption"". Barcelona officially said the transfer cost 57.1 million euros ($63.6 million), with 40 million euros going to Neymar's family and 17.1 million to Santos, but Spanish prosecutors later said it actually cost at least 83.3 million euros."
165,30/04/2020,20:35,PSG awarded Ligue 1 title as French football season declared over,"Paris Saint-Germain were named as Ligue 1 champions on Thursday after France's football league declared the coronavirus-hit season over, leaving some other clubs disappointed and pondering legal action.","PSG led the table by 12 points from Marseille when the season was suspended in mid-March because of the Covid-19 outbreak, which has killed over 24,000 people in France. The announcement by the LFP comes after Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Tuesday that ""professional sports leagues, notably football, cannot restart"" because of the pandemic. ""There is no ambiguity about this declaration. We needed to make a final decision about this season. We acknowledge that the 2019-20 season is over,"" said LFP president Nathalie Boy de la Tour, in a conference call with reporters. France becomes the biggest European league yet to end its season, just as its neighbours in England, Germany, Italy and Spain consider ways of resuming matches. Ruling out any possibility of copying the Netherlands, who voided their season without a champion, relegation or promotion, the LFP arranged a final table on the basis of average points per game. Ten rounds of matches remained when the campaign was halted, although PSG and Strasbourg both had a game in hand. As a result, PSG are champions with an average of 2.52 points per game, with Andre Villas-Boas's Marseille second with an average of 2 points and qualifying for the Champions League. ""We wish to dedicate this title to all health workers and other everyday heroes whose commitment and self-sacrifice throughout these long weeks deserve our admiration,"" said PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi. It is PSG's ninth French title, the seventh in eight seasons for the Qatar-owned club being awarded in unique circumstances and with many of their foreign players -- including Neymar -- having returned to their home countries with France under strict lockdown. ""We understand, respect and support the decisions taken by the French government to stop the season. Health, as the government has always said, must be everyone's priority,"" added Al-Khelaifi, whose club still hope to be able to continue their Champions League campaign having reached the quarter-finals before action stopped. Rennes finish third and also qualify for the Champions League, while fourth-placed Lille will play in the Europa League. Toulouse and Amiens, the bottom two, are condemned to relegation, with Lorient, as champions, and Lens coming up from Ligue 2. The usual promotion and relegation play-offs, meanwhile, have been ditched. However, Toulouse have kept open the possibility that they might now take legal action. The identity of the other European representatives depends on whether the finals of the two domestic cups are ever played. Large gatherings remain banned in France until September. However, if the French government and UEFA accept, both finals could be staged in early August with European places still up for grabs. The LFP then hopes to begin next season by August 23 ""at the latest"". PSG were due to play Lyon in the League Cup final and Saint-Etienne in the French Cup final. If the games are played, Lyon and Saint-Etienne could qualify for the Europa League by winning. Otherwise, Nice and Reims would qualify by virtue of finishing in fifth and sixth in the league. Lyon -- seventh in the table when the season was stopped -- would otherwise miss out on European qualification for the first time in over two decades. Ironically, they were still involved in this season's Champions League when it was suspended, leading Juventus 1-0 after the first leg of their last-16 tie. Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas had previously stated his hope that the season could be played to a conclusion via play-offs in August and his club have now hinted at legal action. In a statement on Thursday, Lyon said they ""reserve the possibility of trying to appeal against this decision and claiming damages and interest"" and adding that ""the losses for the club will come to several million euros"". For all French clubs, the economic consequences of ending the season now could be dire. Resuming matches behind closed doors would have safeguarded TV income, but the loss for clubs in the top two divisions of remaining payments from broadcasters Canal Plus and beIN Sports is believed to be as high as 243 million euros ($266 million), plus 35 million euros for international rights."
166,29/04/2020,02:02,"Swiss set trial date for PSG chief, ex-FIFA no.2","A Swiss court on Tuesday scheduled a September trial date for Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and FIFA's former secretary general Jerome Valcke, in an alleged corruption case.","The case, involving the pair and a third, unnamed man, relates to alleged criminal mismanagement, incitement to criminal mismanagement, falsifying documents and corruption, the Federal Criminal Court said on its website. The court is based in the southeastern Swiss city of Bellinzona. When filing the indictment in February, the office of Switzerland's attorney general (OAG) said the men faced charges linked ""with the award of media rights to various World Cup and FIFA Confederations Cup tournaments."" After the date was set on Tuesday, Al-Khelaifi's lawyers issued a statement insisting the case was ""completely unfounded"", and said the allegation against their client was ""manifestly artificial."" They also indicated that they had requested the recusal of the prosecutors in the case and had filed a criminal complaint related to leaks, ""making it uncertain whether the case will proceed at all."" Al-Khelaifi, who is also the boss of Qatari television channel BeIN Sports, had been suspected of giving inappropriate gifts to Valcke, formerly ex-FIFA boss Sepp Blatter's right-hand man, in order to secure broadcast rights to prestigious events, including the World Cup. But in February, the OAG said it dropped ""a criminal complaint of bribery"" against Al-Khelaifi linked to the award of media rights for World Cup tournaments in 2026 and 2030 and other events, after FIFA withdrew the complaint it was based on, following an ""amicable agreement"" with Al-Khelaifi. Prosecutors however accused him of inciting the non-reporting of a gift. The indictment in February also accused the third man, described as ""a businessman in the sports rights sector"", of bribery over a 1.25-million-euro ($1.35 million) payment to Valcke's company Sportunited LLC. Valcke meanwhile stands accused of exploiting his position at FIFA between 2013 and 2015 to influence the award of media rights for Italy and Greece for various World Cup and other tournaments scheduled between 2018 and 2030 ""in order to favour media partners that he preferred,"" in exchange for the payments from the unnamed businessman, according to that indictment. He has also been charged with falsifying documents, after Sportsunited's balance sheet listed those payments as loans. Switzerland's judiciary last week rejected a request from Al-Khelaifi for three federal prosecutors in the case to be recused, over claims that during a hearing on December 6, 2019, he had not been given enough time to address all of the aspects of the case he deemed were necessary. Valcke, who worked with Blatter from 2003 to 2015, has already been banned from football for 10 years for failing to cooperate with investigators over the resale of World Cup tickets and inflated expenses."
167,09/04/2020,19:53,PSG's Al-Khelaifi in firing line as French clubs battle for TV revenue,Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser al-Khelaifi has been accused of becoming embroiled in a conflict of interest in a dispute over television payments to French football clubs facing a financial crisis in the coronavirus pandemic.,"Al-Khelaifi, 46, is the public face of the Qatari ownership of PSG which has transformed them into one of Europe's most powerful clubs. He is also the head of BeIN Media Group, who as one of the chief broadcasters of France's Ligue 1 have withheld the latest payment due to clubs because of the ongoing suspension of the season. Canal Plus, who pay the most for broadcast rights, have done the same. Despite that, Al-Khelaifi has been mandated by the French league (LFP) along with three other club presidents to lead negotiations with Canal Plus in an attempt to convince them to pay up. The president of the company who have bought the rights to show Ligue 1 games from next season blasted Al-Khelaifi in an interview published on Thursday. ""I don't understand how Nasser can be leading a negotiation when he is an interested party,"" Jaume Roures of the Spanish group Mediapro told sports daily L'Equipe. ""It is incomprehensible. The attitude of Canal Plus and beIN towards the league is also Nasser's attitude. He is not a third party who has come out of nowhere."" BeIN held back paying an instalment of 42 million euros to the LFP for the rights to broadcast games. That was after Canal Plus said they would not pay 110 million euros ($121 million) due this month. The money due from Canal Plus represents 15 percent of the total broadcast money for the season in Ligue 1, and includes 43 million euros due for matches shown before the campaign was suspended on March 13. Mediapro, which is Chinese-owned, bought up the bulk of the domestic rights to Ligue 1 for four years starting next season. The total deal is worth a record 1.15 billion euros a year, with beIN paying a minority of that amount. Viewers wishing to watch beIN Sports will need a Canal Plus subscription. Roures called it a ""strategic alliance"" between the two companies. The crisis is very real for the clubs, who are left wondering what will happen if the season does not resume. Payments from television amounted to 36 percent of total revenue for Ligue 1 teams last season, by far their biggest source of income. However, leading voices at other clubs have dismissed fears of a conflict of interest in the case of Al-Khelaifi. ""Nasser did not put himself forward. We asked him. We need to be clear,"" said Lille president Gerard Lopez. Al-Khelaifi's own club also risk taking by far the biggest hit if no more games are played -- L'Equipe claimed PSG could lose 215 million euros between the loss of projected gate receipts and Champions League revenues. PSG are the fifth richest club in the world going by the latest Deloitte Football Money League with revenue of 635.9 million euros last year, but their annual wage bill is an estimated 337 million euros. ""This is a very important period. The club's future is not at stake, but our room for manoeuvre in the future is,"" said one club source, and they could certainly do with the broadcast money. Meanwhile, Roures insists his company will survive the impact of the current crisis, although it does not even yet have a channel set up to show games. ""I am not saying there is no impact, but we always respect our contracts,"" he told L'Equipe."
168,03/04/2020,20:31,Neymar donates $1M to fight coronavirus,"Neymar has donated $1 million to fight the impact of the new coronavirus in his native Brazil, according to TV network SBT.","The Paris Saint-Germain star, the world's third-highest-paid footballer, donated part of the money to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the rest to a charitable fund launched by his friend Luciano Huck, a Brazilian TV presenter, the report said. The striker's press office declined to comment, saying: ""We never talk about donations or amounts."" Neymar, 28, followed the example of PSG teammate Kylian Mbappe, who last month made what was described as a major donation -- amount undisclosed -- to a French charity helping fight the impact of COVID-19. Huck, who has been touted as a possible candidate in Brazil's 2022 presidential election, launched his fund to help poor Rio de Janeiro neighborhoods particularly vulnerable to coronavirus. The donations come as high-paid footballers face pressure to forego some of their salaries amid the crisis, which has ground the sporting world to a halt and left some clubs struggling to pay their staff. Neymar is riding out the pandemic at his luxury villa in Mangaratiba, a resort town outside Rio. He faced criticism last week after he was photographed relaxing with a group of friends on a beach volleyball court, even as half the world's population -- including most of Brazil -- is in confinement to slow the virus' spread. His press team said he was receiving no visitors and was in quarantine at a ""completely isolated"" residence with people who made the trip from France with him."

""Everyone knows that my main goal is to stay in Paris, but for the time being it's pretty quiet. We'll see between now and the end of the season,"" he told Belgian broadcaster RTBF. The versatile Meunier was quick to play down speculation of a rumoured move to Borussia Dortmund. ""I've seen as many articles linking me with Tottenham or Inter as with Dortmund,"" said Meunier, expressing his bemusement at the interest shown from fans of his potential suitors. ""I don't understand this infatuation."" The French top flight was shut down on March 13 due to the coronavirus pandemic, with PSG 12 points clear of Marseille at the top of the table. Thomas Tuchel's side have qualified for the quarter-finals of the Champions League, which has also been suspended indefinitely, and are through to the finals of both domestic cups."
170,15/03/2020,19:12,PSG put all sporting activity on hold due to coronavirus,"Paris Saint-Germain have suspended all sporting activities until further notice due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Ligue 1 leaders said on Sunday.","The French top-flight has already been put on hold as has the Champions League since last week due to the deadly spread of COVID-19. ""Sporting activities for all our professional clubs will remain provisionally suspended for a period starting tomorrow March 16 until an undetermined date,"" the Ligue 1 champions said. PSG had announced the freezing of all their sporting sections including football and handball until Sunday and will announce a further update on Wednesday. Elsewhere in France, which has recorded more than 4,500 cases and 91 deaths from the illness, fellow Ligue 1 side Nice also stopped their activities and closed their training centre. Earlier on Sunday, Lyon defended president Jean-Michel Aulas after he had suggested wiping out the French season. On Friday, Aulas told newspaper Le Monde: ""The most logical thing would be to say: we'll cancel everything and go back to the situation at the start of the season."""

The LFP said the two league matches scheduled for that weekend, but postponed because of the final, were now back on. PSG will face Metz and Lyon play Nimes behind closed doors on either April 4 or 5. The final was due to be the last of its kind because the organisers have been unable to find a domestic broadcaster willing to pay to show the competition next season.

Mbappe has scored six goals in his past three PSG matches, including a hat-trick in the 5-1 French Cup semi-final win over Lyon last week. ""We're trying to see if he can train a bit tonight (Tuesday). We have to wait and decide tomorrow morning,"" coach Thomas Tuchel told PSG TV. Spanish international Pablo Sarabia is a possible replacement should Mbappe miss the game. PSG lost 2-1 to an Erling Haaland-inspired Dortmund before a crowd of 80,000 in Germany last month, but the return leg will be played at an empty Parc des Princes due to the coronavirus outbreak. ""We're a team that likes to attack, and we're going to attack. We're going to try and score as many goals as possible,"" said Tuchel. ""But if the final score is 1-0 to us, I would be perfectly happy."" PSG's game away to Strasbourg at the weekend was postponed due to the extent of the virus outbreak in the Alsace region of eastern France. ""It was a shame (not to play). It continues to be a bit strange,"" said Tuchel. ""In a match like this one, it's super important (to have fans) to create a special atmosphere, and to put pressure on our opponents. ""With the coronavirus news and Kylian Mbappe, that gives us lots of things to think about,"" he added. ""But it's a football match, we have to adapt. I'm confident in the fact we'll be able to do it."" Tuchel also said a decision on the fitness of captain Thiago Silva would be made on Wednesday. The Brazilian defender hasn't played since injuring his thigh against Bordeaux on February 23. ah-yk-ff/jed/dmc-mw/cw"
175,10/03/2020,03:08,"PSG under pressure against Dortmund to keep Mbappe, Neymar project on track","Nothing ever seems to go to plan in the Champions League for Paris Saint-Germain, whose bid to avoid yet another exit in the first knockout round against Borussia Dortmund will be played out before an empty stadium on Wednesday.","After Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and co. lost 2-1 to an Erling Haaland-inspired Dortmund before a crowd of 80,000 in Germany last month, PSG discovered on Monday the second leg of their last-16 tie must be played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus outbreak. Estimates put the financial hit to Qatar-owned PSG of playing the game without the presence of nearly 50,000 fans at the Parc des Princes in the region of six million euros ($6.9 million), while the president of the club's Ultras fans group has called on supporters to gather outside the stadium instead. However, it is still possible the strange atmosphere will work in the home team's favour, removing some of the immense pressure on them. Agitated supporters are restless at the thought of their team -- despite all the Qatari investment -- going out of the Champions League in the last 16 for the fourth year running. Following the first-leg defeat, one banner targeted captain Thiago Silva and their two superstar forwards, asking: ""Silva, Mbappe, Neymar, afraid of winning? Show some balls."" While PSG's record in France, where they are on course for a seventh Ligue 1 title in eight seasons, is excellent, it is also almost irrelevant. This is a club that begs to be judged on its performance in Europe. They are the fifth-richest club in the world in the most recent Deloitte Football Money League, with 636 million euros in revenue last season, behind only Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Bayern Munich. However, they have fallen at this hurdle in each of the last three seasons, often in farcical fashion. In 2017 there was the capitulation in Barcelona, a 6-1 defeat following a 4-0 first-leg win. They then spent over 400 million euros to make Neymar and Mbappe the two most expensive signings in the world, but the Brazilian missed the second leg of the 2018 defeat by Madrid due to injury and then sat out both legs of an improbable exit to Manchester United last year. In eight years since the Qatari takeover, PSG have beaten just three teams in Champions League knockout ties: Valencia, Bayer Leverkusen and Chelsea (twice). In a recent interview with Canal Plus, sporting director Leonardo tried to take pressure off Thomas Tuchel's team before the Dortmund tie. ""It's not life or death. If we lose we will try again next year,"" he insisted. ""We need to stop all the negativity. We have a fantastic team and fantastic players."" Nevertheless, it is worth pondering how what is essentially a vanity project can continue to be credible if PSG keep on losing the games that really matter. The need to beat Dortmund is therefore critical, even in these mitigating circumstances, and the futures of both Neymar and Mbappe, forever linked to Real Madrid, could depend on it. If they do reach a first quarter-final since 2016, the weight off their shoulders will be huge and might well be replaced by a realisation that winning the trophy for the first time is a real possibility. Coach Tuchel is under contract until 2021 but, just like Unai Emery and Laurent Blanc before him, it is hard to see how he would survive another disappointing European showing. Tuchel is also under pressure after a decision to radically change his team's formation for the first leg backfired badly. He needs a big performance from Neymar, who wanted to leave last summer rather than stick around for a third season in Paris but was poor in Dortmund. Tuchel also needs Mbappe, scorer of 30 goals this season, to deliver on the night. ""He struggled against Dortmund. His reaction since then has been astounding, in every training session. He is decisive and he is in great form,"" Tuchel said recently, and he will hope that form continues at an eerily empty stadium on Wednesday."

Loic Remy put Lille into an early lead against the minnows who had ended Reunion islanders' JS Saint-Pierroise's dreams of becoming the first team from a French overseas territory to reach the last 16. And they continued their adventure by hitting back hard in the second half with a double from Jean-Philippe Krasso. ""We were never in the match,"" complained Lille coach Christophe Galtier. ""You have to congratulate Epinal who deserved this win. We didn't deserve to get a lot out of the way we played."" PSG ensured they did not get spellbound by the magic of the Cup at third division Pau. Neymar stayed in Paris and Kylian Mbappe remained on the bench but the services of the world's two most expensive footballers weren't required as captain Leandro Paredes and Pablo Sarabia scored in either half for a drama-free 2-0 win. ""It wasn't easy, it was our fifth consecutive away game,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""We made a lot of changes but the lads did really well."" PSG, beaten in last season's final, have won the competition a record 12 times, two more than Marseille who also progressed by beating Strasbourg 3-1. A group of around 600 Marseille lawyers dressed in courtroom robes demonstrated against the government's pension reforms, brandishing banners before kick-off and after Bouna Sarr's 32nd minute opener from the stands proclaiming ""Marseille lawyers are going to win"". And Marseille's fans had a nervy wait before the final verdict of the Velodrome drama played out before them was certain. Dimitri Payet's penalty gave the hosts a healthy half-time lead but with Benjamin Corgnet putting Strasbourg back in business on 59 minutes Andre Villas-Boas's side could only breathe easy after Boubacar Kamara's goal deep in injury time. On Tuesday Rennes, who had denied PSG a 13th title, took another step closer to retaining the trophy by edging a nine-goal thriller with top flight Angers 5-4. Saint Etienne beat Monaco and Ligue 1 strugglers Dijon needed a 119th winner against plucky fifth division amateurs Limonest. The last 16 concludes on Thursday with Lyon at Nice."

""It's deeply saddening for the world of sport and for all of us,"" said Neymar to Canal+ after the win, which put PSG 10 points clear at the top of the league. ""Not just for basketball fans, but for everything he did for sport."" He had already put his side ahead with a fine strike in the first half before putting the game out of reach and increasing the gap between them and second-placed Marseille. His 12th league goal of the season tipped the balance in the Parisians' favour after a positive start for the home side, who were unbeaten at home ahead of the match. The Brazilian almost immediately slipped through Mbappe but the onrushing Mike Maignan stopped the France World Cup winner from clinching his 14th top-flight effort of the campaign. Mbappe was stopped again by Maignan when he got his body in the way of a fierce close-range effort, but the away side were given a penalty soon after for a clear Gabriel handball just before the forward's shot. Neymar squeezed his spot-kick just beyond Maignan, who got his hand to the shot but looked on in horror as it made its way in off the post. ""We deserved to win, I think we played well,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""We controlled the match and counter-attacks and this is not easy to do against a good team like Lille."" Lille stay seventh after the defeat, two points away from the European places. Neymar's tribute came on what was already an emotional day in French football, with Nantes and Bordeaux also honouring their former striker Emiliano Sala, a year after his death in a plane crash. The clubs remembered Argentine forward Sala before the Derby de l'Atlantique at the Stade de la Beaujoire. Bordeaux won 1-0 courtesy of a late goal by Jimmy Briand as Nantes played most the second half with 10 men after the dismissal of Andrei Girotto. The 28-year-old Sala was killed last January when the small plane taking him to join Cardiff City after being bought from Nantes for £15 million ($19.5 million) crashed off the Channel island of Guernsey. Nantes wore a special white and pale blue shirt inspired by Argentina while Bordeaux's kit featured an Argentine flag beneath the club crest flanked by the player's initials. Proceeds from the sales of the strips will go to the two Argentine clubs Sala played for in his youth. A portrait of Sala was also displayed in the centre circle during the warm-up and there was a minute's applause ahead of kick-off. Supporters laid flowers outside the ground and broke out into a song commemorating Sala in the ninth minute, representing the shirt number worn by the player which has since been retired by Nantes. Sala left his homeland to join Bordeaux in 2012 and then played for Nantes between 2015 and 2019. Earlier Karl Toko Ekambi scored on his Lyon debut Sunday in a 3-0 victory over bottom club Toulouse. Cameroon striker Toko Ekambi, who joined on loan this week from Villarreal until the end of the season, sealed the win six minutes later as Lyon climbed up to fifth in Ligue 1. Toko Ekambi came on as a first-half substitute after a scary incident involving France Under-21 forward Martin Terrier. Terrier was stretchered off after fainting on the pitch, but Lyon said at half-time the player had regained consciousness."

Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has also admitted an interest in the player. Cavani did not play in Wednesday's 3-0 League Cup semi-final win at Reims because he was, according to Tuchel, ""a little bit injured"". It remains to be seen if he will play any part in this weekend's trip to Lille, as the clock ticks down to the transfer window closing on January 31. With 198 goals since arriving from Napoli in 2013, Cavani long ago overtook old teammate Zlatan Ibrahimovic's mark of 156 to become the club's all-time top scorer. However, his influence has waned this season, first due to injury and then due to the form of summer signing Mauro Icardi. Cavani, who will be 33 next month, has scored only five goals this season in 14 appearances. Two of those were penalties and two more came against sixth-tier opponents in the French Cup. He has started just twice since August, and looks set to fall short of notching a double century of goals in a PSG shirt. ""He is a player who needs time to play and at the moment he only plays four or six minutes per game. PSG are treating him unfairly,"" Cavani's father, Luis, told Spanish television programme El Chiringuito this week. PSG sporting director Leonardo has admitted Cavani wants to leave, but Tuchel has defended his treatment of the player. ""We don't lack respect towards Cavani. He has a problem with his pelvis and so wasn't able to be with us,"" the coach told Canal Plus in midweek. While Cavani's PSG career is coming to an end, that of Tanguy Kouassi is just beginning as his team head to Lille on Sunday sitting eight points clear at the Ligue 1 summit. The 17-year-old Paris-born defender made his debut in December and scored his first goal against Reims. He looks set for a big future, but PSG have yet to secure him to professional terms and he has been linked with a move to RB Leipzig. Leonardo has said the decision is now ""in his hands"", and it as an important issue for the French champions, who have seen a stream of talented academy products leave in recent years, including Adrien Rabiot, Kingsley Coman and current Lyon striker Moussa Dembele. Speaking of exciting youngsters, Rayan Cherki showed how big a talent he is by starring in a French Cup win for Lyon last weekend. The forward, who turned 16 in August, should feature against Toulouse on Sunday, and his arrival on the scene is good news for Lyon, who have lost Memphis Depay to injury for the rest of the season. Despite the emergence of Cherki -- who shares a birthday with Thierry Henry -- Lyon have strengthened in the transfer window, signing Cameroon international forward Karl Toko Ekambi on loan from Villarreal and agreeing a deal with Le Havre for Zimbabwean striker Tino Kadewere. 5 - Lille won 5-1 when they last hosted PSG back in April. That remains PSG's worst league defeat since 2000. 14 - Lille are unbeaten in their last 14 home league games, a run going back to March last year. 9 - Second-placed Marseille are unbeaten in nine Ligue 1 games, winning eight, going into Saturday's meeting with Angers."

The 1-0 defeat by Newcastle on Saturday highlighted a lack of ruthlessness in front of goal with defeat preventing Chelsea from extending their advantage over their rivals for a Champions League place. Fourth-placed Chelsea play Arsenal on Tuesday and are presently five points clear of Manchester United and Wolverhampton Wanderers. Arsenal are 10 points adrift of their London rivals. Cavani is PSG's record goalscorer with 198 but the 116-times capped striker told the board he wanted to leave for Atletico Madrid having fallen behind Mauro Icardi in the pecking order this season. However, Lampard said he would be interested in a striker of the 32-year-old's class when he was told at the eve of match press conference of Cavani's desire to leave PSG. ""He's a great player,"" said Lampard of Cavani. ""I played against him and I always loved his mentality and attitude, and obviously his goal-scoring record speaks for itself. ""I'm not absolutely aware of what the situation is, so we'll see. ""The idea of bringing in experience is something I'm certainly not absolutely looking away from. ""Because sometimes the young players need a little bit of help, and if that's the case then that may help us."" Lampard denied that defeat by Newcastle made it all the more urgent he delve into the transfer market. ""I don't think Newcastle hastens anything, it's just we couldn't do any business in the summer window,"" said Lampard referring to the FIFA transfer ban which has now been lifted but which existed in the close season. ""At this point it's something (lack of accurate finishing) we've seen as a bit of a problem in our home games. ""So we've got to work hard with the group here, and then if we can improve in terms of goal scoring, it's for sure something we have to look at."""

We are studying the situation. It's also true that there has been an approach from Atletico Madrid,"" said Leonardo after PSG had defeated Lorient 1-0 to reach the last 16 of the French Cup. PSG do not want the Uruguayan striker, their record goal scorer, to leave but ""we have to listen to him because we have a lot of respect for the player"", added the Brazilian. Cavani has scored 198 goals in his PSG career but has lost his place as an automatic first-choice following the arrival of Mauro Icardi on loan from Inter Milan. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel refused to comment on the future of the 33-year-old player. ""I have said a lot about this, I am not going to repeat myself always on the same subject,"" said Tuchel. ""If we want to achieve our objectives -- winning as many trophies as possible -- it's best with 'Edi', yes."""

They also registered their 50th goal of the league campaign from 20 matches. Monaco came away from PSG with a point in a thrilling 3-3 draw in the capital last weekend but they posed no similar threat just three days later. Mbappe was on target in the 24th and 90th minutes with Neymar tucking away a penalty in first-half stoppage time. Pablo Sarabia added another in the 73rd minute, just seconds after coming on as a substitute. Ibrahima Bakayoko grabbed a late consolation for Monaco, beating the impressive Kaylor Navas in goal. ""In every area, we were better than Sunday,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""It's a deserved victory, we had lots of possession."" Tuchel fielded his 'Fab Four' attacking stars in Mbappe, Neymar, Mauro Icardi and Angel Di Maria. It was a decision which paid dividends when Di Maria floated over a cross for Mbappe to score the opener. Monaco goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte denied Mbappe on two further occasions in the first half. Neymar made it 2-0 from the penalty spot in injury-time after Kamil Glik had fouled Layvin Kurzawa. Sarabia's goal was set-up by fellow substitute Marco Verratti before Mbappe completed the rout of the club he had joined in 2015. ""With our four attackers, we can carry out our plan,"" added Tuchel. ""For Icardi, it wasn't a negative game. It's a good mix. ""Kylian and Neymar carry the ball a lot, Mauro is used to working with us, for the team, to open spaces. ""He hasn't scored in two matches, but he works. There are no doubts over him. He added: ""The objective was to win the game, take the three points to improve our position. ""We have the best players but I also want to have the best team in each match."" For Monaco coach Robert Moreno, the defeat was a sobering experience coming after Sunday's encouraging draw in the French capital. ""I am very happy and proud of my team,"" said Moreno after his first home game in charge saw Monaco's six-match win streak at Stade Louis II end. ""It's a different result to Sunday but tonight we conceded three goals on the counter-attack and a penalty. ""At 3-1, we took risks but had we scored a second then the mental situation would have changed and the last few minutes would have been interesting."" Rennes are third in the table, five points behind Marseille and 13 off PSG after a 1-0 win over Nimes. Adrien Hunou scored the winner in the 64th minute to ensure a sixth win in the last seven games. Nimes are second bottom, three points behind Amiens who drew 1-1 at home to Reims."

Al-Khelaifi, who is also the boss of Qatari television channel BeIN Sports, is suspected of giving inappropriate gifts to Valcke -- including rent free access to a luxury property -- in order to secure broadcast rights to prestigious events, including the World Cup. Valcke, formerly ex-FIFA boss Sepp Blatter's right hand man, is suspected of awarding those rights in exchange for bribes. A third, unnamed suspect in the case -- described by Swiss prosecutors as ""a businessman in the sports rights sector"" -- is also accused of paying bribes to secure broadcast rights. ""All three suspects complied with the OAG's invitation to appear in person,"" the statement said. It added that it was yet not clear whether formal indictments would be filed against any of the suspects or whether the cases would be abandoned. Al-Khelaifi was separately charged in May by French prosecutors in connection with Doha's candidacy to stage the world athletics championships. French prosecutors are looking specifically at two payments of $3.5 million (3.18 million euros) in 2011 by Oryx Qatar Sports Investment, a company run by Nasser's brother Khalid Al-Khelaifi, to a sports marketing firm run by Papa Massata Diack. Diack's father Lamine Diack was president of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) from 1999 to 2015 and a member of the International Olympic Committee. Valcke, who worked with Blatter from 2003-2015, has been banned from football for 10 years for failing to cooperate with investigators, the resale of World Cup tickets and inflated expenses."

That could be problematic. PSG, who are in the Champions League, are scheduled to play twice a week until the French mid-season break between December 21 and January 11. A spokesman for PSG said the squad, which was already in the south of France, would fly back from Nice at around 16.00 local time. A thousand Parisian supporters had been expected in the Principality and PSG tweeted that it would send them ""an email with the terms of exchange or refund."" Both clubs are scheduled to play on Wednesday, with PSG at home to Nantes and Monaco at Toulouse. On Sunday morning, two French regions, including Alpes-Maritimes which surrounds the principality, were placed on red alert for floods by Meteo France, the French weather service. It said the area faces what it called a ""marked Mediterranean episode"" of intense storms. Rainfall could total as much as 200mm (almost eight inches) over the weekend, Meteo France said. It said that it expected coastal areas to be the most affected, with ""very significant risks of runoff and overflow from coastal rivers."" PSG are five points clear of Marseille with Monaco in 14th, just three points clear of the relegation zone. As for Sunday's lost fixture, the ""Professional Football League Competitions Committee will later set the date of the match"" the league said in a statement. In Alpes-Maritimes and the neighbouring Var region 148 municipalities were declared disaster areas on Saturday after the damage caused by a previous Mediterranean episode last weekend, which resulted in the death of six people in the Var."
185,27/11/2019,00:43,Mbappe stars as PSG snatch dramatic point at Real Madrid,Kylian Mbappe instigated a dramatic Champions League comeback on Tuesday as Paris Saint-Germain scored twice in two minutes to rescue a 2-2 draw against Real Madrid and secure first place in Group A.,"Madrid dominated the majority of a pulsating contest at the Santiago Bernabeu and looked to have sewn up an impressive victory when Karim Benzema scored his second goal in the 79th minute. But PSG pulled off an unlikely turnaround as Mbappe capitalised on a defensive mix-up to pull one back in the 81st minute before Pablo Sarabia, once of Real, drove into the top corner second later. ""Real were better for long periods,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""We were lucky but that's not a crime."" Gareth Bale, who came on as a substitute to a mixed reception from the home fans, almost won it in injury-time when his bending free-kick struck the post. The draw means PSG will go through as group winners while Madrid are guaranteed to finish second after Club Brugge drew 1-1 at Galatasaray in the early kick-off. Madrid's late capitulation tarnished an excellent display that highlighted their transformation since the 3-0 thrashing at the Parc des Princes in September. ""It was a great performance,"" said Zinedine Zidane. ""The players are not happy with the result but you have to be happy with what we have done for 80 minutes. I'd take that performance all day long."" There was also the worrying sight of Eden Hazard hobbling off with what looked like an ankle injury in the second half, with the Clasico against Barcelona only three weeks away. ""It's more than just a knock but I hope the twist is a minor one,"" said Zidane. Neymar was also left on the bench by Tuchel despite recovering from a hamstring injury, only to be brought on at half-time. It was his dummy that led to Sarabia's equaliser. ""I didn't want to risk him,"" said Tuchel. ""I prefered to be sure he could finish the match."" Zidane's press conference on Monday became another ode to Mbappe, who will reportedly be Madrid's number one target next summer. The Frenchman, in his 100th game for PSG, looked like he wanted to put on a show, puffing out his chest after an early foul by Sergio Ramos and squeezing Zidane's hand as he fetched a ball from behind his back. The threat of Mbappe hung over the match but Madrid were much the better side, slicker in their passing, faster with the ball and more aggressive in winning it back. Their opening goal came in the 17th minute and Hazard started it, skipping between Thomas Meunier and Marquinhos before switching to the right. Isco struck Fede Valverde's pull-back against the post before Benzema showed a cool head to find the corner. On the back foot for most of the half, PSG twice went close towards the end of it. Mbappe, slipped through by Angel Di Maria, opted to shoot when he might have squared for Mauro Icardi. Icardi was then brought down in the area after nipping around Thibaut Courtois. Referee Artur Dias pointed to the spot and showed the goalkeeper a red card but a VAR review showed Idrissa Gueye had pushed Marcelo in the build-up. Madrid looked to have put the game to bed when Luka Modric ghosted clear and Marcelo's cross found the deadly Benzema free at the back post. But the celebrations had barely finished when Mbappe pulled one back, a gift as Courtois and Raphael Varane allowed Meunier's cross to slip between them, leaving the 21-year-old with an open goal. It felt like a consolation but PSG had other ideas as a clever dummy from Neymar fooled the entire home defence and the ball cannoned out to Sarabia, who swept it into the top corner. Both teams looked for a winner and PSG went close, Mbappe firing into the side-netting before Bale's bending free-kick hit the post deep into injury-time."
186,26/11/2019,21:13,Real Madrid into Champions League last 16 after Brugge held,Real Madrid qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League before taking to the field on Tuesday after Group A rivals Club Brugge drew 1-1 with Galatasaray in Istanbul.,"The Belgian side needed to win in their early kick-off in Turkey to maintain any chance of qualifying ahead of Madrid, but they were on the back foot after Adem Buyuk gave Galatasaray an early lead. The visitors did equalise in the second minute of added time via a fine individual effort by Krepin Diatta, but the draw still suited the 13-time European champions, with Brugge five points behind them while having just one game left to play. Brugge finished the game with nine men, with Diatta shown a second yellow card after removing his shirt to celebrate the equaliser and Clinton Mata also being cautioned a second time after kicking down a corner flag in wild celebration. Those celebrations were understandable, as the draw ensured that the Belgians stayed ahead of Galatasaray with one game remaining in the battle to finish third in the group and parachute into the knockout phase of the Europa League. Real were hosting Paris Saint-Germain later at 2000 GMT at the Santiago Bernabeu needing to win to maintain a chance of beating the French side to top spot and thereby ensuring, in theory, an easier draw in the last 16. In the other early kick-off on Tuesday, Bayer Leverkusen kept alive their chances of reaching the last 16 thanks to a 2-0 win away to Lokomotiv Moscow in Russia. An unfortunate Rifat Zhemaletdinov own goal in the first half and then a fine Sven Bender volley in the 54th minute gave Leverkusen the victory. The Bundesliga side are now just a point behind Atletico Madrid in Group D, but the Spaniards can seal qualification for the last 16 with a game to spare if they defeat Juventus in Turin later on Tuesday. Juventus have already qualified but a win will allow them to guarantee progress as group winners."

Real have recovered in the Champions League after also being held to a 2-2 home draw by Brugge in their second game, beating Galatasaray home and away including a 6-0 thrashing in Madrid last time out.

""The first meeting with them helped us learn a lot -- it wasn't a good game but we've improved a lot lately,"" said the Belgian. ""It's not revenge, more wanting to get one over on another big team who have aspirations to win the Champions League and we need to show how good we are."" PSG lead Real, who knocked them out of the tournament in the last 16 two years ago, by five points with two matches remaining and can secure top spot in the group by avoiding defeat. ""They have great qualities and a great mentality, it is a big challenge,"" said Paris coach Thomas Tuchel. ""The match will be different from the first leg. The Bernabeu is a very hard venue to play. Madrid are in good form, they score a lot and barely concede. ""But we have a balanced and dangerous team. We are ready for this challenge, I am sure of that. We have to work together and suffer together.""

189,25/11/2019,14:47,"Neymar has 'matured' as a person and player, says Marquinhos","When Paris Saint-Germain travel to Spain on Tuesday to face Real Madrid in the Champions League it will be with a Neymar who has, according to his teammate Marquinhos, grown up.","""Neymar has lived things that have matured him as a person, and as a player,"" the PSG vice-captain told AFP. There is no doubt that there have been plenty of concerns for the French side over their record 222 million euro signing since he joined from Barcelona in 2017. The 27-year-old forward has helped PSG to two titles in a weak Ligue 1 but has failed to inspire them to the heights in the Champions League, the main reason for the Qatari-financed club indulging in such a massive outlay in the first place. He is generally respected by the fans but not loved. Indeed there was some jeering when he was substituted during Friday's win over Lille, his first game in six weeks following a hamstring injury. Part of the antipathy was his exerted and ultimately failed efforts to secure a transfer back to Barcelona during the summer. Marquinhos, however, is in no doubt about the commitment that his fellow Brazilian brings to the Parisian cause. ""Ney has always been thorough,"" says the 25-year-old central defender. ""He is someone who doesn't do things by halves. It shows on the field. When he takes the ball he wants to be decisive. ""Once he's on the pitch, even after all that happened during the transfer window and the other stories, he's back on the pitch to win, to score, to make a difference. ""He's not hiding. He proves that he is totally committed alongside us."" Neymar's return on Friday was his first appearance for PSG since October 5, having suffered a hamstring injury playing for Brazil against Nigeria a week later. It was just the latest spell on the sidelines for the world's most expensive player, who has featured in barely half of PSG's matches since signing from Barcelona in 2017. His decision to fly to Madrid to take in the Davis Cup tennis last week did not go down well with coach Thomas Tuchel but it marks just another blimp in the Brazilian's sojourn in France, unfairly according to Marquinhos. ""There are other things to say as well. He worked well during the week, he did everything right,"" says Marquinhos. ""I think we should put more emphasis on the good things he does rather than the negative things. ""If you put all this in the balance, the positive things that he does (are superior) but there are always some negative points that people want to talk about because it is Ney! And when you speak about Ney, it resonates around the world."" ""As a friend, he always does good things but we don't talk about them."" Tuesday's game against Real Madrid comes with PSG already qualified for the last 16. But playing at the Santiago Bernabeu will serve as an indicator of whether PSG can finally be considered genuine Champions League contenders. It may also offer a clue as to whether Neymar is finally going to live up to the 222 million price tag which has weighed heavily on him in big games over the last two years. ""I hope for that especially,"" says Marquinhos. ""He always wants to perform, to win. He's a real competitor, not just in football. In everything he does, he wants to be the best, that is always in his head. ""If he hasn't been in recent years, he is certainly going to want to show it this season. ""I hope it's going to be a very good season for him and for us."""
190,25/11/2019,02:46,Defiant Bale down but not out at Real Madrid,"When Zinedine Zidane dropped Gareth Bale for a Champions League game against Paris Saint-Germain last year, Bale believed it was the beginning of the end at Real Madrid.","Two seasons on he remains but Madrid face PSG again at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday, with the Welshman's future still in doubt and his standing among the fans perhaps never lower. Madrid's two last 16 legs against PSG in the Champions League in 2018, towards the end of Zidane's first spell as coach and en route to their third consecutive European triumph, marked a turning-point between Bale and his coach. By leaving him out, Zidane's message was clear: he did not trust Bale in the biggest matches. The pair hardly spoke for the rest of the season, even as Bale scored twice as a substitute in the final against Liverpool. Bale was set upon leaving that summer, only for Zidane to go instead, and while Bale stayed, Zidane came back and their relationship has been frosty ever since. But in the last few weeks, as Bale's behaviour has wavered and the criticism increased, Zidane has become his staunchest defender. When Bale returned to London to visit his agent earlier this month, Zidane said he had permission to go. When Bale joined up with Wales despite missing six Real Madrid games through injury, Zidane said it was bad timing. And when Bale celebrated behind a flag that put his club lower down his list of priorities than his country and playing golf, Zidane urged the fans to remember his achievements. ""I have said before, we need our fans with us,"" said Zidane after the game on Saturday. ""There's a lot of noise, too much. He wants to be with us and do well and he's done that. Talk, talk, talk, it's not necessary. He's a big part of the group and we are together."" Zidane's pleas had fallen on deaf ears not long before, when the screeching whistles at the Bernabeu were loud enough to conclude the majority of fans were unimpressed and wanted to make their point. Yet after his introduction in the 67th minute of the 3-1 win over Real Sociedad, Bale played well and the whistles for his every touch gradually grew quieter. By the end, there were some applauding as he almost capped a driving run with a goal. ""He played 30 magnificent minutes,"" said Real Madrid director Emilio Butragueno. ""He is a player that has the ability to help us a lot, he looks for space, has a good shot, can score. He was magnificent and we will need him for the challenges ahead."" Bale's team-mates were supportive too. When Luka Modric added a third goal, following a neat exchange between Bale and Fede Valverde, Casemiro and Valverde sought Bale out to celebrate with him. ""It was a way to show we're all united,"" said Valverde. ""We are going to support him. I went over to hug him because I respect everything he gives me on a day-to-day basis. He is a good person, it is impossible not to love him. ""He is training very well and contributing a lot on the field. The fans will end up appreciating him again. We are all fighting for him."" For Bale, the prospect of a rapprochement with Zidane is unlikely, even if the Frenchman is keen to maintain the peace for the sake of the team, particularly while the transfer window is closed. Clubs are not expected to bid in January and while a departure next summer seems more realistic, Bale has made a habit of unlikely revivals. Just as he delivered in defiance in the Champions League final against Liverpool, it would not be a surprise to see him produce again now, when criticism has been at its most intense. ""These discussions are always very public and everyone has an opinion,"" said Thibaut Courtois, who knows the challenges of winning over the Real Madrid supporters given his own history with Atletico. ""Gareth has to give 100 per cent to the team. He played very well off the bench on Saturday and the third goal was a great move between him and Valverde. Now he has to win round the people."""

Despite not being near their best, Thomas Tuchel's side were too strong for the team who finished runners-up behind them last season. After just 14 games, PSG are 11 points clear of second-placed Marseille, who play on Sunday. Neymar had not played for his club since October 5, having suffered a hamstring injury playing for Brazil against Nigeria a week later. It was just the latest spell on the sidelines for the world's most expensive player, who has featured in barely half of PSG's matches since signing from Barcelona in 2017. His decision to fly to Madrid to take in the Davis Cup tennis this week did not go down well with Tuchel, but the German coach still handed Neymar a start here. On just his sixth appearance of the campaign, Neymar lasted 65 minutes before being replaced by Kylian Mbappe, who had been struggling with illness in recent days. ""I didn't expect too much from him because he has been out for six weeks. He lacked precision and his usual sense of timing but that is how it is,"" said Tuchel of Neymar. The Brazilian only produced brief glimpses of his class and headed straight to the dressing room after being taken off, with some supporters jeering the 27-year-old as he departed. ""It's normal, lots of players do that,"" insisted Tuchel, dismissing any controversy. ""Others go to the bench, but I didn't see it because I was focused on making changes on the field. There is no need to make a big thing about it."" The main reason for Neymar's withdrawal, however, will have been to keep him fresh for next Tuesday's trip to Real Madrid when he will hope to make his first Champions League appearance this season. Lille had beaten PSG 5-1 when the sides last met in April, but they came here on a run of just one win in nine and without an away victory since March. They were without their top scorer, Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen, due to suspension, and coach Christophe Galtier had been left reeling when two of his assistants -- Portuguese duo Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos -- left 48 hours before this game to team up with Jose Mourinho at Tottenham Hotspur. They still almost took a second-minute lead through Xeka, but the midfielder's shot was saved by Keylor Navas. Instead it was PSG who went in front from their first chance, Icardi converting at the far post after Jose Fonte had failed to cut out Idrissa Gueye's low centre. Mike Maignan saved well from Gueye before the home side scored again in the 31st minute through another of their Argentine contingent. Both Di Maria and Icardi had scored in PSG's last game, a 2-1 win at Brest, and both were fresh here having not featured in the Argentina squad for their friendly matches against Brazil and Uruguay. On form they surely deserve to be playing for their country, however. Di Maria controlled Julian Draxler's pass and beat Maignan to make it 2-0. That was the end of the scoring, although Draxler and substitute Edinson Cavani both squandered excellent second-half chances. ""They didn't play for Argentina and that was good for us because it meant we were able to manage their workload and keep them fresh,"" Tuchel said of his two goal-scorers. ""I'm delighted because they got their goals and worked hard for the team."""
192,21/11/2019,16:45,Neymar set for latest comeback,Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel has again been left frustrated by Neymar after the Brazilian took time out from recovering from his latest injury to fly to Madrid for the Davis Cup tennis this week.,"""I am not his Dad, I'm not the police,"" said an exasperated Tuchel on Thursday, a day before PSG host Lille in Ligue 1. That match is set to see the world's most expensive player make his return from a hamstring injury suffered playing for Brazil against Nigeria on October 13. ""I am his coach, and he has been training well. Did I like the fact he went on this flight? No, not at all. But is it worth me going crazy over? No,"" Tuchel added. ""If all goes well, he can play tomorrow, but whether he starts or comes off the bench, that depends."" Neymar has not played for PSG since scoring in a 4-0 win over Angers on October 5. He has four goals in just five appearances in this campaign but will now be hoping to put a run of games together, with Friday's match against last season's Ligue 1 runners-up being followed by a trip to Real Madrid in the Champions League. Having the former Barcelona superstar available again presents a problem for Tuchel -- just how does he keep all his forward players happy? Mauro Icardi and Edinson Cavani are already battling it out for one place at the tip of the attack, but Kylian Mbappe is a doubt for Friday's match. The World Cup winner has been struggling with illness and played no part in France's 2-0 victory in Albania last weekend. ""I don't know if he is capable of playing. He has had a fever,"" said Tuchel, who will also be without midfield duo Ander Herrera and Marco Verratti against Lille. Lille have already been eliminated from this season's Champions League after just four games and have not yet won on their travels in the current campaign. They come to Paris without their top scorer, as Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen is suspended. In addition, coach Christophe Galtier has been left reeling after his assistant coach, Joao Sacramento, and goalkeeping coach Nuno Santos were both allowed to leave on Wednesday to team up with compatriot Jose Mourinho at Tottenham Hotspur. ""I don't blame them for going. I have also been an assistant coach,"" Galtier said. ""They have been contacted, they believe in that project and they want to go. That's how football is today."" The 24-year-old's stock has risen enormously since he left PSG in 2015 in search of first-team football at Lille. Maignan was named the best goalkeeper in Ligue 1 last season and was called up to the France squad for the first time in May. However, the departure of Lille's goalkeeping coach Nuno Santos to Tottenham could have a big impact on Maignan. He admitted in a recent interview with sports daily L'Equipe to having made big strides in 18 months working under Santos. On Friday he could be a very busy man against Neymar and co. 23 - The number of years since Lille won at PSG. Since that 1-0 victory in April 1996, they have lost 12 and drawn eight of 20 visits to Paris. 11 - Memphis Depay is Lyon's top scorer this season with 11 goals. However, he suffered a relapse of a thigh injury on duty with the Netherlands this week and so will again miss out when Lyon host Nice. 8 - The number of points separating second-placed Marseille from leaders PSG. In contrast, Marseille are only six points better off than Amiens in 15th."
193,11/11/2019,00:16,PSG goalkeeper Navas out injured for at least two weeks,"Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Keylor Navas has been ruled out of action for at least two weeks with a thigh injury, the Costa Rican football federation (FEDEFUT) announced on Sunday.","The former Real Madrid number one pulled out of PSG's 2-1 win at Brest on Saturday after injuring himself during the warm-up. The problem will rule him out of Costa Rica's upcoming CONCACAF Nations League games against Curacao and Haiti, on November 15 and 18, and faces a race to be fit in time for PSG's Champions League match at Real Madrid on November 26. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel has an extremely lengthy injury list, with Navas joining Kylian Mbappe, Neymar, Ander Herrera, Thomas Meunier and Thilo Kehrer on the sidelines. Sergio Rico stepped in at Brest to make his Paris debut after joining on loan from Sevilla."
194,09/11/2019,22:10,Icardi strikes again to edge PSG past Brest,Mauro Icardi came off the bench to score a late winner as Paris Saint-Germain extended their Ligue 1 lead to nine points despite another unconvincing performance in a 2-1 victory at Brest on Saturday.,"The reigning French champions, who were beaten by then-bottom club Dijon last week before scraping past Club Brugge in the Champions League, needed Icardi's ninth goal in eight games to secure the three points. ""We can't score four goals each time,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""I'm very happy. It's five wins in six games. I didn't expect us to have our best match, but we had to be calm and fight."" Brest, promoted from the second tier last season, caused PSG problems throughout and had levelled with 18 minutes remaining through Samuel Grandsir. Second-placed Angers missed the chance to cut the gap to seven points as they were held to a goalless draw at Reims. Tuchel saw his long injury list extended before kick-off as goalkeeper Keylor Navas pulled out of the game after suffering a thigh problem in the warm-up. The Costa Rican joined Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, defenders Thomas Meunier and Thilo Kehrer and midfielder Ander Herrera on the sidelines. Edinson Cavani made his first start since August, but struggled in front of goal. ""For Edi (Cavani), it wasn't easy because he's lacking rhythm,"" added Tuchel. ""He has to manage his competition with Icardi. He is full of confidence."" The visitors claimed a 39th-minute lead as Angel Di Maria raced clear before clipping a chipped finish over Brest goalkeeper Gautier Larsonneur to score his eighth goal of the campaign. His effort survived a VAR review for offside to send PSG into the interval ahead. Cavani wasted two clear-cut chances in the space of three minutes just after the hour mark, and Brest made him pay. Substitute Grandsir collected the ball inside the area and fired a low effort through goalkeeper Sergio Rico, making his Parisian debut after signing on-loan from Sevilla. But the Spaniard redeemed himself shortly afterwards, keeping out Haris Belkebla's long-range strike. On-loan Inter Milan striker Icardi had the final say, though, pouncing inside the six-yard box in the 85th minute to scramble the ball over the line after Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's cross was only partially cleared. Later on Saturday, last season's runners-up Lille were held to a 0-0 draw by Metz at the Stade Pierre Mauroy to end a disappointing week on a low note. Lille, who were knocked out of the Champions League by a 4-1 loss at Valencia in midweek, sit third, already 11 points behind PSG. Monaco made it three wins in four league games to move into the top half of the table as Aleksandr Golovin's first-half strike was enough to edge out struggling Dijon 1-0. On Sunday, unpopular Lyon coach Rudi Garcia takes his new side to their rivals and his former club Marseille."
195,09/11/2019,12:49,Klopp rules out move for France superstar Mbappe,"French star Kylian Mbappe is out of Liverpool's price range, the Premier League leaders manager and long-time admirer Jurgen Klopp says.","The 20-year-old Paris Saint Germain striker -- who was instrumental in France's lifting of the 2018 World Cup -- has been linked with Real Madrid. This gathered momentum earlier in the week when Real's coach Zinedine Zidane remarked that Mbappe had always said it was his dream to play for the Spanish side. Klopp, speaking ahead of Sunday's clash with second-placed Manchester City, had been keen to sign Mbappe in 2017 and met with the player and his entourage. However, he opted to join PSG for £158 million ($202 million). PSG are seeking to extend his present contract and if they were reluctantly to allow him to leave are believed to want more than the record fee of £198 million they paid Barcelona for Neymar in 2017. ""Buying this calibre of player is difficult,"" Klopp was cited in Saturday's The Times as saying. ""I don't see any club at the moment who can buy Kylian Mbappé from PSG. ""I don't see any club. That is how it is. And we are involved in these clubs who cannot do it. Easy as that. ""OK, from a sporting point of view, there are not a lot of reasons to not sign him. ""What a player he is. It is about the money of course. No chance. Absolutely, no chance. Sorry for killing that story."" Klopp, whose side have a six point lead over champions City heading into their match at Anfield, said the minimalist level of activity from him in the transfer market in the close season was down to the money being asked for their targets. The Champions League holders signed teenagers Harvey Elliott and Sepp van den Berg whilst bringing in goalkeeper Adrian on a free transfer. ""The players we thought about to make this team better were really expensive and we could not spend the money,"" said the 52-year-old German. ""That is how it is. ""To see a player better than him, or with potential to be better or play exactly the same as him is really difficult. ""That is what it was. That was the situation. ""It was not that we were not ready, but we did not want to make five or six changes. Not at all. ""This team is at a wonderful age, there is still space for improvement, completely fine."" Klopp, though, said it is easier than when he first arrived in 2015 to attract top level players to Liverpool. Last year they secured Brazil goalkeeper Alisson and Dutch centre-back Virgil van Dijk for £65 million and £75 million respectively from AS Roma and Southampton. ""I don't think we have to compare with Man City,"" said Klopp. ""I have no idea which kind of player wants to go to Man City, but good players obviously did it in the last couple of years, there is no doubt about that. ""There are reasons, good reasons why players want to join us, that is clear. ""I don't think we struggle with convincing players."""
196,08/11/2019,02:35,PSG hail Navas as bitter rivals Marseille and Lyon clash,"If Paris Saint-Germain have been held back in recent years by their lack of a truly top-class goalkeeper, Keylor Navas showed just why they were so keen to bring him to the French capital with his midweek performance in the Champions League.","The Costa Rican joined PSG in September from Real Madrid as Alphonse Areola moved in the other direction, and on Wednesday his late penalty save helped secure a 1-0 win over Club Brugge that clinched his side's place in the last 16. The last line of defence for Real as they won three successive Champions Leagues between 2016 and 2018, Navas is yet to concede a goal in Europe since arriving in Paris. Indeed, the 32-year-old has let in only five goals in 12 matches for Thomas Tuchel's side. ""He is an extraordinary goalkeeper. He won three Champions Leagues with Real Madrid in a competition where goalkeeper is such an important position. They can change the outcome of a game,"" remarked midfielder Marco Verratti after Wednesday's game, in which Mauro Icardi scored the winner. ""He will bring so much experience and calmness to the side,"" said sporting director Leonardo. Leading sports daily L'Equipe on Thursday gave over its front page to the goalkeeper with a headline referencing 1982 Jean-Paul Belmondo action comedy The Ace of Aces. And yet less than a week ago it is true that Navas hardly covered himself in glory as PSG suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at Dijon. Then again, neither did any of his teammates, and Europe is where this team will really be judged. A trip to Real Madrid later this month, when Neymar should be fit again, could be revealing. In Ligue 1, PSG have lost three of their opening 12 games and yet they are already seven points clear of Angers at the top. They travel to face Brest on Saturday where Tuchel will again have to decide whether to leave the club's all-time top goal-scorer, Edinson Cavani, on the bench. Icardi has been preferred to the Uruguayan recently and has now scored eight times in the last seven matches. Few tears were shed among Marseille fans when Garcia left his job as coach at the Velodrome at the end of last season. In contrast, there was plenty of unrest in the Lyon support when the 55-year-old was appointed as successor to the sacked Sylvinho last month. Garcia's recent past with Marseille was always going to be difficult to swallow for Lyon fans given the frankly bitter rivalry that has developed between the clubs. On Sunday, Garcia heads back to Marseille with his new team for the 'Olympico' as the sides jostle for position in a packed table behind PSG. Lyon are 10th but sit just four points behind Marseille in fourth and have won their last three games, including a precious 3-1 defeat of Benfica in the Champions League in midweek. Garcia has been dealt a major blow, though, with the news that Memphis Depay -- scorer of 11 goals in 14 games this season -- will miss the match with a hamstring injury. 8 - The number of goals scored by Mauro Icardi in PSG's last seven matches. 5 - Lyon have won their last five Ligue 1 meetings with Marseille and are unbeaten in 10 encounters since a 4-2 defeat in May 2014. 10 - Lille are unbeaten in their last 10 home league games, a record they will hope to extend as they entertain Metz on the rebound from a 4-1 loss at Valencia which eliminated them from the Champions League."
197,06/11/2019,22:56,Icardi strike and Navas penalty save take PSG through in Champions League,Mauro Icardi scored the only goal and Keylor Navas saved a second-half penalty as Paris Saint-Germain edged out Club Brugge 1-0 to secure their place in the knockout phase of the Champions League with two group matches to spare on Wednesday.,"Argentine striker Icardi's close-range finish in the first half at the Parc des Princes was his eighth goal in PSG's last seven matches and it was enough to give the French champions a fourth win in as many outings in Group A. However, their opponents played well enough to take something from the game and would have done so had Navas not stopped Mbaye Diagne's 76th-minute spot-kick. Despite failing to convince here -- two weeks after a 5-0 victory when the sides met in Belgium -- PSG know they will appear in the last 16 for the eighth consecutive season, and a draw in their next game away to Real Madrid will ensure that they progress as winners of Group A. Real are also on the verge of qualifying themselves after a 6-0 hammering of Galatasaray on Wednesday. Club Brugge, meanwhile, are now unlikely to finish higher than third -- which would see them parachute into the Europa League -- as they fell short of replicating their impressive display in drawing 2-2 away to Real earlier in the campaign. Nevertheless, they are supposed to be small fry for the behemoth that PSG have become. On Wednesday, the Qatar-owned outfit announced record turnover for last season of 637.8 million euros ($706m), confirming their status as one of the world's richest clubs. What PSG do in the group stage has never really been the issue, and once again it will only be when the knockout rounds begin in February that their true potential will be measured. The nature of their display here, just five days after a Ligue 1 loss against modest Dijon, does raise questions, yet Thomas Tuchel's side are still yet to concede a goal in this Champions League campaign and again they won here without Neymar. The Brazilian is scheduled to be back from his latest spell on the sidelines in time for the trip to the Santiago Bernabeu on November 26. After scoring a stunning hat-trick as a second-half substitute in Bruges, Kylian Mbappe made his first start in the Champions League this season, while Icardi was again preferred to Edinson Cavani up front. Cavani, PSG's all-time leading goal-scorer, has not started a game since suffering a hip injury in late August. He watched on as Icardi got the opening goal midway through the first half, prodding home from close range after the visitors made a mess of dealing with a seemingly harmless ball into the box by Colin Dagba. Icardi later hobbled off with a knock to be replaced by Cavani in the 72nd minute, with the Uruguayan being given a hero's welcome onto the pitch by the home fans. However, within moments of his introduction the away side won a penalty, Scottish referee Bobby Madden pointing to the spot when substitute Diagne went down under a Thiago Silva challenge. It was a glorious chance for Club to earn a draw that they will feel they deserved, and yet Senegalese striker Diagne's kick was clutched low down by a grateful Navas. Having earlier made two notable saves to deny Emmanuel Bonaventure Dennis, including showing excellent reactions to get down to a deflected effort just after half-time, the Costa Rican was the real hero of the night for the home side."
198,04/11/2019,23:57,Neymar escapes with warning over Cup final fan slap,"Neymar will escape prosecution for an altercation with an opposition supporter after Paris Saint-Germain's surprise defeat in the French Cup final in April, sources told AFP on Monday.","Prosecutors have decided the Brazilian star will receive a written warning and no further action will be taken. A 29-year-old Rennes fan who had been filming Neymar as he climbed the stairs to collect his loser's medal at the Stade de France appeared to cajole the disconsolate player after the French league champions were defeated in a penalty shootout. Neymar stopped, used his hand to lower the phone and then tapped the fan on the chin. ""I shouldn't have done it but sometimes it's hard to remain calm,"" Neymar said on Instagram at the time. A lawyer for the fan who filed a complaint against Neymar for violent behaviour said the warning was unacceptable. ""It's a justification of violence,"" said lawyer Philippe Ohayon. ""If that had been a fan hitting a player he would have been brought to justice and maybe even received a custodial sentence."" Neymar was given a three-match ban for the gesture at the time of the incident."
199,01/11/2019,23:58,'Too passive' PSG stunned by rock-bottom Dijon in Ligue 1,"Paris Saint-Germain suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at the hands of rock-bottom Dijon on Friday with coach Thomas Tuchel accusing his expensively-assembled team of ""being too passive and not playing together"".","It was the third loss of the Ligue 1 season for the French champions who could also see their lead at the top trimmed to just five points by the end of the weekend. Dijon, who started the day at the foot of the table with just nine points, fell behind to Kylian Mbappe's fifth goal in seven games. However, Mounir Chouiar levelled in the sixth minute of stoppage time in the first half before Venezuelan international Jhonder Cadiz hit the winner in the 47th minute. ""We were too passive in the first half, not only in defence but also in attack because we did not play together,"" said Tuchel. ""We lacked precision and rhythm. It was much better in the second half because we had three shots before half-time and 17 after the break. Maybe we didn't deserve to have success or luck with us today."" PSG were without the injured Neymar but looked more than capable of blowing away a Dijon team who had managed to score just six goals in 11 games before Friday's match which was played out in torrential rain. Dijon had previously never defeated PSG in the top flight in 2011, conceding 31 goals in eight meetings. Mbappe gave PSG the lead in the 19th minute after a terrible mix-up in the Dijon defence allowed Angel Di Maria to steal possession and feed Mbappe. The French World Cup winner finished with a delightful chip over Alfred Gomis in the Dijon goal. After the match was held up due to a nasty blow suffered by Fouad Chafik who collided with Gomis, Dijon were on level terms. Didier Ndong crossed from the right with PSG keeper Keylor Navas clearing the ball only as far as Chouiar who hit the target. Two minutes into the second period, Cadiz shrugged off the attentions of Marquinhos and Idrissa Gueye before tucking away a left foot shot between the legs of Navas. ""We hate to lose,"" added Tuchel. ""It could have been possible to win given the number of chances we created. We always say that we are in another league. We must accept defeat and improve but I retain confidence in my players."" The three points lifted Dijon into third from bottom in the Ligue 1 table while PSG will now need to regroup before facing Club Brugge in the Champions League at home on Wednesday."
200,22/10/2019,22:57,Sub Mbappe's hat-trick puts PSG in Champions League last 16 driving-seat,Substitute Kylian Mbappe scored a hat-trick as Paris Saint-Germain moved a step closer to the Champions League last 16 with a 5-0 victory over previously unbeaten Club Brugge on Tuesday.,"The World Cup winner, who has only started four games this season due to thigh and hamstring injuries netted three time in the space of 20 minutes to help PSG go five points clear of Real Madrid, who beat Galatasaray 1-0, in second place in Group A. Maurco Icardi netted the visitors other two goals as fellow Argentinian Angel Di Maria directly set-up three of his side's efforts. For the third time in Europe this season PSG's Thomas Tuchel was unable to start his attacking trio of suspended Neymar and injured Mbappe and Edinson Cavani. Brugge coach Philippe Clement, who has guided the club to the top of the Belgian Pro League, was without captain Ruud Vormer as the Netherlands midfielder serves a suspension for a red card he received in the draw at Real. The visitors claimed an early lead as Di Maria received a long-range ball on the right flank. The Argentina winger curled in an early cross with the outside of his left foot and Icardi beat Simon Mignolet at his near post after seven minutes. Champions League debutant Charles De Ketelaere missed a good chance to equalise after half an hour but the 18-year-old failed to worry Keylor Navas. Icardi had a chance to double the Parisians' advantage six minutes into the second-half but his effort across goal was well-saved my Mignolet. Mbappe entered the fray 60 seconds later and instantly dropped deep hungrily looking for possession. The Ballon d'Or candidate repeated his feats from Friday's Ligue 1 victory over Nice by scoring and claiming an assist within the final half an hour. He claimed his first of proceedings with 28 minutes of the game to go after another Di Maria curling cross. The World Cup winner then set-up Icardi for his fifth in four games less than 60 seconds later. Mbappe's second and third goals of the match both came from lovely Di Maria passes as PSG marked their intentions in the competitions with a clinical performance. The two clubs meet again on November 6 in the French capital with Neymar expected to be sidelined with a hamstring injury picked up on international duty."

""At the start of a run of six very intensive matches, it's always good to start with a win,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""We had a good first half, I was happy. We had chances to control the match but at the start of the second half, we forgot to close it out."" A spectacular triple save by Walter Benitez kept out Presnel Kimpembe and Abdou Diallo in the opening minutes at the Allianz Riviera but PSG soon made the breakthrough. Di Maria raced on to a first-time pass from fellow Argentine Mauro Icardi before calmly guiding beyond Benitez in the Nice goal on 15 minutes. Only Mbappe has been involved in more goals in France this year than Di Maria, who duly doubled his tally six minutes later with a sublime lob from an unfavourable angle. Marquinhos replaced PSG captain Thiago Silva at half-time and headed against the crossbar at a corner, but a mistake from the Brazilian presented Nice a lifeline on 67 minutes. An ill-advised attempt at chesting down a cross allowed Kasper Dolberg to tee up Ignatius Ganago to blast home via the underside of the bar. Any chance Patrick Vieira's side had of salvaging a result effectively evaporated though with the dismissal of Wylan Cyprien and Christophe Herelle in a matter of minutes. Cyprien was shown a second yellow card for dissent with Herelle sent off following a VAR review for a petulant slap on Leandro Paredes. Tuchel threw on Mbappe, restricted to just two substitute appearances since August, for the final eight minutes and PSG made the most of their two-man advantage. Mbappe drove low under Benitez to claim his first goal since August 11 and then laid on an assist for Icardi to tap home in stoppage time. Nantes could trim PSG's lead back to two points on Saturday when they head to bottom side Metz, while Rudi Garcia begins his reign as Lyon manager against lowly Dijon. Garcia, 55, must win over underwhelmed fans and turn around a season that is already threatening to go off the rails after taking charge of Lyon on Monday. He has been tasked with ending a miserable run that has left them languishing in 14th place after nine games, already seven points away from the Champions League places for which they are expected to challenge."
202,16/10/2019,13:59,PSG's Icardi relieved focus back on football after Inter Milan circus,Argentina striker Mauro Icardi said Wednesday he was enjoying the focus being back on football and away from his private life at French club Paris Saint-Germain.,"The former Inter Milan captain arrived in the French capital on loan this season and after recovering from injury has scored two goals in the Champions League and Ligue 1. ""In Italy a vicious circle had been created in certain journalistic circles where we always ended up talking a little too much about anything concerning me,"" Icardi said in an interview with Italian sports daily Gazzetta Dello Sport. ""Here in Paris it's not like this."" Icardi was the joint top-scorer in Serie A in 2017-18 with 29 goals. But last season, he was stripped of the club captaincy amid a long contract dispute and later barred from full training. The 26-year-old's life with his television host wife Wanda Nara, who is also his agent, had also become the focus of many reports. Despite parting on bad terms the forward said he had no hard feelings towards the Italian club he joined in 2013 and scored 120 goals in just over 220 matches. ""I can only wish the best for Inter in every competition,"" said Icardi. ""I'm good now, I'm up and running again even if I have to keep working because I had a complicated summer and I wasn't one hundred percent when I arrived in Paris."" PSG are unbeaten on top of Ligue 1, and are also leading their Champions League group which includes Real Madrid. ""I've always been used to pressure but I think it helps that we've almost always won so far,"" said the former Sampdoria player. ""It's a little different than Inter even though I don't have a real yardstick to compare because I haven't played in other great teams in the past. ""PSG has the right players to do well but the Champions is a trophy coveted by all the great teams."" Icardi said he had settled in to life in France even if he still considered Milan his home. ""I didn't expect so much support from the fans. ""They welcomed me right from my first warm-up at Parc des Princes. I then had the good fortune of playing right away against Real Madrid, before picking up a slight injury. ""(PSG coach Thomas) Tuchel is very friendly with the players. He talks a lot, jokes, tried to put me at ease from day one. ""I think I made a good impression on him. ""Neymar, (Kylian) Mbappé, (Edinson) Cavani, are all strong players. ""It is nice to play with star players who change matches even at the last minute, like Neymar does."" Icardi added that he had a healthy competition with Uruguayan striker Cavani. ""With Edy I have a great relationship. It's not rivalry, just healthy competition,"" said Icardi. ""In this period Edy was injured so I had the chance to play immediately. ""When he comes back, it will be up to the coach to choose the best one to send onto the pitch."""
203,05/10/2019,20:56,Icardi scores first Ligue 1 goal as PSG cruise past Angers,Mauro Icardi scored his first Ligue 1 goal as Paris Saint-Germain moved five points clear at the top of the table with a 4-0 thrashing of high-flying Angers on Saturday.,"The reigning champions had suffered a shock 2-0 loss in their previous home game against Reims, but had no such trouble at the Parc des Princes on this occasion despite their opponents' surprisingly strong start to the season. PSG head into the international break totally in control of the title race, although Nantes, who leapfrogged Angers into second on goal difference, could cut the gap to two points when they host Nice later on Saturday. ""It's a good end to this period for us, and with a clean sheet, that's good,"" said Paris coach Thomas Tuchel, who saw three of his recent signings score as Pablo Sarabia and Idrissa Gueye also found the net. ""With the recruits, we have gained personality and experience. We are more reliable."" Neymar's late strike rounded off a strong individual display as he continued to repair his relationship with the team's fans after failing in his effort to force through a return to Barcelona. ""It (the situation) is better, it's easier,"" said Tuchel of Neymar. ""It's up to him to show that he is decisive, that he gives everything. ""He is suffering and working for us. It's not necessary to talk... He scored another goal today, he did a lot of dribbling, decisive things. ""He is capable of doing more extraordinary things, and it's to him to show them."" Tuchel opted to rest Angel Di Maria, as on-loan Inter Milan striker Icardi was rewarded for his first PSG goal in midweek at Galatasaray with a full Ligue 1 debut. The capital city club remained without the injured Edinson Cavani, while Kylian Mbappe missed out after suffering a setback in his recovery from a thigh problem. But the first opportunity fell to in-form Angers forward Rachid Alioui, although the Algerian dallied on the ball and home goalkeeper Keylor Navas was able to save with his foot. The hosts took the lead in the 13th minute, though, as Ander Herrera played in Sarabia, who cut inside and wrong-footed Ludovic Butelle in the Angers goal to net for the first time since joining PSG from Sevilla in the close-season. The visitors continued to threaten on the counter-attack, with Navas having to beat away Baptiste Santamaria's long-range drive. The game was all but ended as a contest eight minutes before the break, as Neymar and Sarabia combined to give Icardi the simplest of tasks to fire into the roof of the net. Although Spain international Sarabia scuffed a rebound after his initial shot was cleared off the line just before the hour mark, former Everton midfielder Gueye was on hand to tap in his first PSG goal. But there was little respite for Angers, as Neymar launched a one-man mission in his attempt to get on the scoresheet. The Brazilian was twice denied by Butelle in quick succession, before the goalkeeper produced a brilliant save with his legs when the world's most expensive player was clean through on goal. Neymar eventually found a way past Butelle in the final minute, rounding the 'keeper and slotting into an empty net to complete a straightforward outing for PSG with his fourth goal of the campaign."
204,01/10/2019,23:29,Icardi opens PSG account to claim victory at Galatasaray,Mauro Icardi scored his first Paris Saint-Germain goal as the French champions beat Galatasaray 1-0 to move four points clear at the top of their Champions League group on Tuesday.,"The Argentina forward, who joined the Parisians on loan from Inter Milan during the summer, opened his account for the club to maintain their perfect start to their European campaign after downing Real Madrid 3-0 two weeks ago. The Turkish champions sit third in the standings with a single point from the draw at Club Brugge on September 18 and have not registered a win in four games in all competitions. ""We showed a lot of maturity today. Even if it was difficult we stayed calm and kept our confidence,"" PSG midfielder Idrissa Gueye told broadcaster RMC Sport. ""Now everyone knows what we're about, everyone knows how to play against us."" Thomas Tuchel was without Neymar, serving the last match of his European suspension for abusing a referee on social media, and Kylian Mbappe who started on the bench as he continues to recover from a thigh injury as Icardi led the attack in Istanbul. Fatih Terim brought in Ryan Donk and Jean Michael Seri to his side after Saturday's Super Lig draw with Fenerbahce as Algerian international Sofiane Feghouli dropped to the bench. The first sight of goal for either side came as Angel Di Maria tested Galatasaray goalkeeper Fernando Muslera on two minutes. Icardi, returning to PSG's starting line-up after recovering from an injury sustained in the victory over Real, was shown a yellow card in the seventh minute for a foul on captain Muslera. Galatasaray's first chance of proceedings came three minutes later as Seri's shot curled the wrong side of Keylor Navas's left-hand post. Five minutes into the second half, Di Maria, who starred in the victory over Real a fortnight ago, wasted a one-on-one to claim the lead as Muslera saved his weak shot. A matter of seconds later, Icardi opened his PSG account to break the deadlock after some tidy interplay. Marco Verratti found winger Pablo Sarabia inside the box who squared a pass to Icardi at the back post. Icardi was substituted on the hour mark for World Cup-winner Mbappe. Playmaker Feghouli came onto the field a minute later, replacing Younes Belhanda, who played in a face mask due to a jaw problem. Radamel Falcao, who moved from Ligue 1 side Monaco in September, had a chance to equalise for the Turkish side with 20 minutes to go but his right-footed free-kick from 20 metres out skimmed the crossbar. The away team held on to claim victory and move four points clear at the top of the group as Tuchel brought on midfielder Ander Herrera for Di Maria during the final 10 minutes. Next for PSG is a trip to Club Brugge who drew 2-2 at Real Madrid earlier in the day despite leading 2-0 at half-time at the Santiago Bernabeu. Galatasaray host the Spanish giants on October 22."
205,28/09/2019,22:17,"'I'll give my life to PSG,' says Neymar","Brazilian superstar Neymar pledged Saturday to ""give my life to PSG"" after his goal kept the French giants top of Ligue 1 with a 1-0 win at Bordeaux.","Neymar, the world's most expensive footballer, had been strongly linked to a return to Barcelona over a tumultuous summer. However, in an attempt to win over PSG fans, many of whom have become unconvinced by the player's attachment to the French capital, Neymar has looked a rejuvenated figure, scoring for a third time this season. ""I'm very happy to be able to help PSG, it's better with the fans,"" he said. ""It's like with your girlfriend, one moment you're bad, but with hugs and a lot of love, it's better. ""I am here to give my life to PSG. They are my team, my goal is to help my club, to continue to score goals."" On Saturday, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar played together for the first time this season and combined for the only goal in Bordeaux. Mbappe, who had been out injured since August 25, started on the bench but, with PSG struggling for a breakthrough, came on after an hour. The Parisian attack immediately gained a more menacing edge. Both Mbappe, with a shot, and Neymar, with a header, went close before combining to open the scoring for the game's only goal in the 70th minute. Mbappe outpaced the Bordeaux defence on the right. His precise low cross presented Neymar with a tap in at the far post. ""The most important thing is that these goals are decisive, in tight matches, that's why I'm here,"" added Neymar. ""It's obviously a pleasure to link up with Kylian again. He came back with his smile and with his football talent,"" he added. French World Cup winner Mbappe said he was delighted to link-up again with Neymar although he admits their partnership remains a work in progress. ""There are things that have been said, but we have always had a relationship based on honesty and admiration,"" said Mbappe. The last time Mbappe and Neymar had appeared together was in the French Cup final last April, a match which ended in defeat. As Bordeaux pressed, Mbappe and PSG began to carve open the home defence. He burst through on his own, but goalkeeper Benoit Costil anticipated the chip. Then Costil again reacted quickly, diving at Angel Di Maria's feet as the Argentine ran onto Mbappe's angled through ball. PSG, who had suffered a shock 2-0 loss to Reims on Wednesday, survived a late video review for a potential Bordeaux penalty to recapture first place. Angers are second in the table after a 1-1 draw with Amiens. Nantes, also two points off the pace, had briefly moved to the top when they won 1-0 win at Lyon earlier in the day. Lyon had the best of the chances but conceded the only goal in freakish fashion just before the hour. As Samuel Moutoussamy broke into the home area, left-back Fernando Marcal slid in and attempted to poke the ball out for a corner. Instead, it struck his other leg and looped over goalkeeper Anthony Lopes and into the goal. As the home fans whistled their team, the Lyon players appeared increasingly lost, although the brilliance of Nantes goalkeeper Alban Lafont was a major factor in their failure. For Nantes, it was a first win at Lyon since December 1996. Monaco's revival continued when a 4-1 home win over Brest allowed them to move into 12th spot. Monaco have now taken seven points from their last three league games."
206,27/09/2019,02:55,PSG hope for Mbappe boost after shock home loss,"Paris Saint-Germain will look to shake off a rare home league defeat this weekend when they travel to Bordeaux, where Kylian Mbappe could return from a month out with a thigh injury.","Thomas Tuchel's side, depleted by a raft of injuries, slumped to a 2-0 loss against Reims on Wednesday which ended an unbeaten 22-match run at the Parc des Princes. Discounting a handful of defeats after winning the league in previous seasons, it was PSG's first meaningful loss at home since November 2012. ""It was a poor performance. We had a lot of players missing, that's why we made so many changes,"" said Tuchel. ""I have to manage the playing time of the squad. And I think it was possible to play better with the team we had on the pitch."" PSG remain top of Ligue 1 on goal difference, above surprise second-place side Angers, but defender Marquinhos said they must strive to consistently keep the bar high. ""The challenge for this season will be to maintain a high level each match,"" said Marquinhos. ""We must inspire ourselves to rise to this challenge."" Neymar, who produced late match-winning strikes in his first two games this season, cut a peripheral figure midweek with Mbappe, Edinson Cavani and Mauro Icardi all missing. Tuchel spoke of taking a cautious approach with the 20-year-old Mbappe, who has missed the last five matches but is back in training with the squad. Lyon's bright start under first-time manager Sylvinho is a distant memory with the club winless in five matches since beginning the campaign with two resounding wins. The latest setback came at Brest where the hosts twice recovered to earn a 2-2 draw, a result that dropped Lyon into the bottom half of the table. ""We didn't play well. I'm not satisfied, once again we lost the three points in the final minutes,"" said Sylvinho, whose team host fourth-placed Nantes on Saturday. ""We have a lack of confidence and it generates fear. I am a little concerned about the results, but the first step is to restore confidence. To do that, we need to win matches."" Monaco picked up their first victory this term on Tuesday and will host Brest at the weekend, while Marseille -- held to a 0-0 draw at basement side Dijon -- are at home to Rennes on Sunday. While Nicolas Pepe is slowly adjusting to life in the Premier League at Arsenal, Victor Osimhen has made an electric start in Lille colours after arriving from Belgian club Charleroi. The 20-year-old Nigerian was limited to a 45-minute appearance in the third-place play-off match at the Africa Cup of Nations but has scored six times in his first seven Ligue 1 games for Lille. He is the joint top-scorer in the division alongside Moussa Dembele and will attempt to inflict more damage this weekend on Nice, who are reeling from Tuesday's 3-1 loss at struggling Cote d'Azur rivals Monaco. 44 - PSG's midweek loss against Reims marked the first time in 44 matches they had failed to score in Ligue 1. It was the longest such run in the history of the French top flight. 6 - Six of Angers' league-leading 15 goals have been scored by substitutes this season, more than any other club in Europe's top five divisions. 17 - Saint-Etienne goalkeeper Stefan Bajic, at 17 years and nine months, in midweek became the first goalkeeper born this century to play in Ligue 1.

207,26/09/2019,14:07,Brazilian star Neymar faces litigation on all fronts,"Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar, the world's most expensive player, is embroiled in a string of legal woes with cases in Spain, France and Brazil.","A contract extension bonus Barcelona agreed to give Neymar is at the heart of the legal dispute, which was withheld by the Spanish club following his record-breaking 222-million-euro ($244 million) transfer to Paris Saint-Germain in August 2017. The case will be heard by a court in the Barcelona suburbs on Friday morning. The bonus was agreed in the summer of 2016. But when the striker left for PSG barely a year later, Barcelona refused to pay him the outstanding 26 million euros, and demanded he return the sum already received. The Catalan club also lodged a complaint against the player for breach of contract, demanding 8.5 million euros in damages plus interest. The Brazilian responded by filing a suit against his former club to demand the payment of the outstanding bonus. Brazilian model Najila Trindade, 26, filed a criminal complaint against Neymar in June at a police station in Sao Paulo, accusing him of raping her at a Paris hotel on May 15. But Brazilian prosecutors dropped the case in August, citing a lack of evidence. The former Brazil captain has said the encounter was consensual. After PSG's shock defeat by Rennes in the Coupe de France final in April, Neymar was filmed punching a fan in the face after he told the player from the stands: ""Learn how to play football."" The 29-year-old man filed a criminal complaint against Neymar for assault. ""Did I behave badly? Yes. But nobody could remain indifferent,"" the player said afterwards. He was banned for three matches. Brazilian investment group DIS, which owned 40 percent of Neymar's rights when he transferred to Barcelona from Brazil's Santos in 2013, filed a lawsuit for fraud and corruption against Neymar, his father-cum-agent, the two clubs and their current or former executives. Barcelona said they had spent 57.1 million euros on the transfer, with 40 million euros going to Neymar's family and the rest to Santos. But prosecutors suspect the transfer actually cost 83.3 million euros. DIS, which received 6.8 million of the 17.1 million euros paid to Santos, has accused Neymar and Barcelona of hiding the real amount in order to pay them a lower sum. In 2017, a Spanish judge said Neymar should stand trial for alleged corruption and fraud, but the proceedings have been frozen pending a decision on which court should hear the case. Neymar is being investigated by the Brazilian tax authorities who say he did not pay income tax on the sale of image rights while he was at Santos nor on the millions Barcelona paid him before the transfer to ensure he would not sign with another club. In 2017, Neymar agreed to pay a 2.1-million-euro fine to settle the dispute but the following year, the Brazilian authorities said he actually owed 16 million euros in back taxes, a figure his lawyers have challenged."
208,25/09/2019,23:08,Injury-hit PSG slump to shock home defeat by Reims,Paris Saint-Germain fell to a shock 2-0 loss to Reims at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday as headers from Hassane Kamara and Boulaye Dia gave the visitors a famous win.,"The Ligue 1 champions, depleted by a spate of injuries, remain top of the table after seven games, but have already lost twice this season after defeat at Rennes last month. It was PSG's first home loss in the league since a 2-0 reverse at the hands of Rennes in May 2018, ending an unbeaten run of 22 matches at the Parc. PSG only lead second-placed Angers on goal difference, after Rachid Alioui's late double grabbed Stephane Moulin's side a 2-0 win at Toulouse. Neymar, who had scored late winners in each of his previous two Ligue 1 games, started alongside Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Pablo Sarabia up front, with Edinson Cavani, Kylian Mbappe and Mauro Icardi all still injured. But the Brazilian, who failed to force through a return to Barcelona in the close-season, was a peripheral figure and was guilty of gifting Reims possession on numerous occasions. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel was also forced to play a makeshift midfield featuring full-back Juan Bernat, with Marco Verratti suspended. The hosts made a slow start, despite Neymar going close with a free-kick, and fell behind just before the half-hour mark. Reims, who also beat PSG 3-1 on the final day of last season, launched a rare attack and Hassane Kamara rose to powerfully head home Zimbabwean Marshall Munetsi's right-wing cross. PSG's injury woes intensified further shortly before half-time as Choupo-Moting hobbled off to be replaced by Angel Di Maria, who had originally been rested and named as a substitute. Reims came agonisingly close to doubling their advantage in first-half injury-time, as centre-back Yunis Abdelhamid's header bounced narrowly past the post. PSG dominated possession for much of the second half without posing a serious threat, and Reims again came within centimetres of making it two as substitute Remi Oudin's low, left-footed effort struck the base of the post. And Dia entered the fray before planting another fine header past the despairing dive of home goalkeeper Keylor Navas, sealing a richy-deserved victory. Earlier on Wednesday, Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen scored as Lille moved into third with a 2-0 victory over Strasbourg, while Lyon were held by Brest. Last season's runners-up Lille have now won all four of their home league games this term and sit two points adrift of PSG. The 20-year-old Osimhen put Christophe Galtier's Lille into a 43rd-minute lead at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy by lashing home after some slack Strasbourg defending to net his sixth goal in seven games this season. The three points were secured 19 minutes into the second half as Osimhen turned provider for former Chelsea and Marseille forward Loic Remy to slide in his first goal of the campaign. Elsewhere, Lyon saw their winless streak extended to six matches in all competitions with a 2-2 draw at promoted Brest. Moussa Dembele moved joint-top of the Ligue 1 goalscoring charts on six strikes with Osimhen by giving Lyon a 28th-minute advantage, but Yoann Court equalised for Brest less than 60 seconds later. Maxwel Cornet appeared to have eased some of the pressure on Lyon coach Sylvinho by netting in the 69th minute, but Court completed his double to snatch Brest a point with five minutes remaining. ""We didn't play well, I'm not satisfied,"" said former Arsenal and Barcelona left-back Sylvinho. ""Once again we lost the three points in the final minutes. We have a lack of confidence and it generates fear."" Lyon, widely considered PSG's likeliest title challengers ahead of this season, slipped to 11th, already six points off the pace."
209,23/09/2019,00:04,Neymar saves PSG to send French champions three points clear,Neymar scored a fine late winner as Paris Saint-Germain beat Lyon 1-0 on Sunday to move three points clear at the top of the Ligue 1 table.,"The Brazilian finally beat Anthony Lopes, who had pulled off numerous impressive saves, with three minutes of normal time to play at the Groupama Stadium. It was Neymar's second winning goal in as many league games since being reinstated to the team following a protracted transfer saga which saw him attempt to force through a return to Barcelona. ""Neymar can do better,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""It's the second or third game in four months for him. He's not at 100 percent capacity. ""He is not at his limit. He can do better, he will do better. He's going to get to his best level, with matches and decisive goals like that, it's going to help him."" The Parisians sit top on 15 points after Angers and Nice both won over the weekend to temporarily join Tuchel's side at the summit, and followed up their impressive midweek Champions League victory over Real Madrid with the win in constant drizzling rain in Lyon. Sylvinho's Lyon remain in ninth place and are without a win since mid-August. PSG were without the attacking trio of Kylian Mbappe, Edinson Cavani and Mauro Icardi due to injuries, while midfielder Marco Verratti started on the bench. The best of the early chances fell to Neymar on 22 minutes but his effort was superbly saved by Lopes. Neymar was denied again by another tidy Lopes stop four minutes before the break as the Portugal international tipped the Brazil forward's dangerous free-kick over the bar. PSG's domination from the first half carried over into the second 45 minutes. Abdou Diallo had the pick of the chances, using the wet conditions to glance a header from a Neymar corner over the crossbar. The world's most expensive player was targeted by home fans when taking set-pieces from the left-hand side as they threw plastic bottles and rolled-up bin bags at him. With 87 minutes on the clock, substitute Verratti found Neymar in the box who dribbled into space and finally beat Lopes to the keeper's left with a low shot. He celebrated by running towards the same corner of the ground where he had earlier been taunted by the Lyon supporters. Earlier, Angers moved into second place after replacement Casimir Ninga scored an 11-minute hat-trick in a 4-1 thrashing of Saint-Etienne. Ninga, who joined the club from second-tier Caen in August, put Angers into the lead with less than a quarter of an hour remaining before adding two more goals by the 89th minute to clinch their first home win over Saint-Etienne in 43 years. The defeat at Stade Raymond Kopa leaves Les Verts a point above the relegation zone, with Ghislain Printant's outfit having failed to win since the opening day of the season. Stephane Moulin's Angers, who finished 13th in the league last season, have claimed four wins from their opening six fixtures to pull level with Nice in second spot. ""Casimir made a thundering impact. I truly congratulate him because he's worked a lot since arriving at the club,"" Moulin said. ""The second half perfectly resembles what we have been doing since the start of the season. It's a little bit new but it corresponds perfectly to what we're trying to do."""
210,19/09/2019,17:51,Snap judgment: fan who took selfie with Mbappe fined and banned,"A football fan has been fined in France for running onto the field during a Ligue 1 game in Toulouse and taking a selfie with hero, Kylian Mbappe.","The fan seized his photo opportunity in added time at the end of the first half on 31 March with the match still goalless. He has been fined 1,500 euros and banned from football grounds for six months, his lawyer, Mathieu Peter, told AFP in Thursday. The prosecutor in Toulouse had requested a 500 euro fine and a one-year stadium ban. In France, ""entering a sports stadium playground disrupting the conduct of the competition"" carries a maximum punishment of one year in prison and a 15,000 euro fine. Peter said that his client, an ""occasional"" PSG supporter, had told the hearing that he wanted ""a selfie and jersey"" from Mbappe and ran on when he heard a whistle blow which he thought signalled the end of the half. The fan got his photo but did not keep it. After he was grabbed, dragged to the ground and then arrested, the police confiscated his phone. Mbappe scored a 74th minute winner."
211,19/09/2019,13:58,Zidane found wanting as Madrid are ran ragged in Paris,"Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane could only hold his hands up after his side were outclassed by Paris Saint-Germain in their opening Champions League game of the season on Wednesday, going down 3-0 in the French capital.","""They were superior to us in everything,"" Zidane admitted after the match at the Parc des Princes. ""In terms of how they played, in midfield, but above all, and what annoys me the most, in terms of intensity."" Games at this level are often won in the centre of the park and the Madrid trio of Casemiro, Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez could not cope with their opponents, for whom the tireless Idrissa Gueye was outstanding. Zidane had pinpointed the same issue last weekend after his side almost blew a three-goal lead against Levante in La Liga. ""When I looked to the bench there was nothing else,"" he said of his midfield then, but he could and certainly should have seen this coming. While an injury to Luka Modric has exacerbated the problem, Zidane allowed Dani Ceballos and Marcos Llorente to leave in the summer and did not have an alternative to a failed move to sign Paul Pogba. The defeat in Paris may ultimately not prevent Real from reaching the last 16, but their performance contrasted sharply with two seasons ago, when they dumped PSG out en route to winning the trophy for the third year running. Zidane walked away after that success only to be tempted back in March. If it seemed like a huge risk at the time to gamble his legacy, six months on and the France great appears no closer to getting the 13-time European Cup winners back on track. He did not have to deal with such adversity in his glittering first stint in charge. They have won seven and lost five of 16 games since his return. On Wednesday, according to renowned Spanish sports statistician Mister Chip, apart from two disallowed goals, Real failed to muster a shot on target for the first time in a decade, a period spanning 578 competitive games. That was despite the presence of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Eden Hazard up front. The latter made his first start for the club after injury following his 100 million-euro ($110 million) move from Chelsea but received a rating of two out of 10 from French sports daily L'Equipe. ""To not create chances with the players we had on the field, it is a bit of a strange feeling but that is how it is,"" Zidane said. Writing in Spanish sports daily As, Alfredo Relano remarked ""Madrid are not in good shape, others know it and their opponents no longer crouch down before them out of respect for their prestige."" Of course they were not helped by the absences of the injured Marcelo and the suspended Sergio Ramos from their defence on Wednesday. There is still much work for Zidane to do, however, with what is meant to be a new-look Real -- centre-back Eder Militao and left-back Ferland Mendy were the other summer signings to start in Paris. But he needs to find solutions quickly, with Real facing a tough test on Sunday as they travel to face a Sevilla side who are top of La Liga after four games, two points above Zidane's team. Real have lost on their last four visits to the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, and on six of their last seven trips there. Sevilla have another potential weapon given their coach, Julen Lopetegui, will be motivated by the prospect of getting one over on the club who sacked him after just 14 games last season. ""We need to forget this defeat, it is hard but we have another game on Sunday and we need to focus on that,"" Zidane said. It may be stretching it to say his position is under threat at the moment, but another defeat this weekend might change that, and a derby away to Atletico awaits a week later."
212,18/09/2019,23:04,Di Maria stars as PSG tear apart Real Madrid,Angel Di Maria scored twice against his former club as Paris Saint-Germain shrugged off the absences of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe and thrashed Real Madrid 3-0 on Wednesday to get off to the perfect start in their latest bid for Champions League success.,"Di Maria beat Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois at his near post to put PSG ahead in the 14th minute at the Parc des Princes, but it was his second goal just after the half-hour mark that really lit up this encounter. The Argentine, who starred for Real for four years and won the Champions League with them in 2014 before making an ill-fated move to Manchester United, gave Courtois no chance with a shot on his left foot from 20 yards out that arrowed into the corner. Thomas Meunier added the gloss to the score-line at the death but it was Di Maria who had cleared the way for his side, stepping up in the absences of the injured Mbappe and Edinson Cavani as well as the suspended Neymar. After a summer dominated by the saga of whether the world's most expensive player would leave the club, here was a reminder that the French champions have others capable of winning such games. These two clubs are trying to recover some of their lustre after disappointing campaigns in Europe last season, but for PSG this result is a measure of revenge for their defeat at the hands of Real in the last 16 the previous year. They remain unbeaten at home in the Champions League group stage since 2004 and they are already in control of Group A before facing Galatasaray and Club Brugge, who drew 0-0 in Belgium on Wednesday. Real remain far from convincing since Zinedine Zidane's return to the club for a second spell as coach and the 13-time European Cup winners have won only twice in five outings so far this season. There is still much work to be done if they are to go deep in this competition again after being humbled by Ajax in the last 16 last spring. They had a Gareth Bale goal disallowed for handball after a VAR review just after going two behind, while Eden Hazard struggled to make an impact on his first start since his 100 million-euro ($110 million) move from Chelsea. Madrid were also handicapped by the absences of Sergio Ramos, Nacho and Marcelo in defence as well as Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modric from their midfield. Mauro Icardi made his first start for the home side after his arrival on loan from Inter, but his fellow countryman Di Maria stole the show. PSG, confusingly wearing white while the visitors wore dark blue, opened the scoring in the 14th minute when Di Maria latched onto a Juan Bernat cutback from the left byline and fired in, although Courtois should have done better. Hazard shot just wide at the other end moments later and Bale curled a free-kick over the bar from the edge of the area after he had been fouled. Just after that, in the 33rd minute, Di Maria took a touch and smashed a shot into the right corner of the net to make it 2-0. Then came Bale's disallowed goal, and the Welshman came close again in first-half stoppage time, yet the Spanish giants created little in the second half apart from a Karim Benzema goal that was ruled out for offside. Hazard, meanwhile, departed 20 minutes from time having failed to make his mark on the game, and PSG scored again in stoppage time. With the Madrid defence exposed, Meunier exchanged passes with Bernat before finishing to the delight of the home crowd. Both sides should still make it through but for now it is PSG, six months on from their horror show and humiliating exit against Manchester United, who have more reason to be optimistic. Especially with so much attacking firepower still to come back."
213,17/09/2019,12:08,Neymar's PSG Champions League suspension cut,"Neymar's Champions League ban for insulting match officials on social media has been reduced from three games to two following an appeal, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled on Tuesday.","The world's most expensive player following his move from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain for 222 million euros in 2017 will miss the fixtures against Real Madrid on Wednesday and Galatasaray in two weeks' time due to the original ban from UEFA. However, he will now be free to face Belgian side Bruges on October 22. ""The Sole Arbitrator partially upheld the appeal and reduced the suspension imposed by UEFA on Neymar Jr. to two (2) UEFA competition matches for which he would otherwise be eligible,"" CAS said in a statement. The Brazilian criticised the referee and his assistants after PSG's last-16 collapse against Manchester United in March which he watched from the stands due to injury. United were awarded a penalty deep into injury time after a protracted VAR decision, which Marcus Rashford scored to knock the French side out in the last 16 of the Champions League. ""It's a disgrace. They get four guys who don't understand football to watch a slow motion replay in front of the TV,"" Neymar posted on his Instagram account after the 3-1 defeat. Neymar scored an added time winner in his first PSG appearance of the season on Saturday as his overhead kick claimed all three points against Strasbourg. He had not played for his club since May and had been left on the sidelines in their first four league games of the campaign because of the uncertainty surrounding his future after months of reports linking him with a move back to Barcelona or to Real. The Parisians host the Spanish giants without their first-choice attacking trio of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani, the latter pair both suffering from injuries. In their absence coach Thomas Tuchel could turn to summer signing Mauro Icardi or Cameroon forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting to lead the line at the Parc de Princes."
214,17/09/2019,04:12,"With Neymar staying and Icardi in, can PSG finally deliver in Europe?",The visit of Real Madrid to the French capital on Wednesday means a glamour tie for Paris Saint-Germain to begin their Champions League campaign but a meeting with the Spanish side also brings back unhappy memories.,"When the clubs last met in Europe two seasons ago, a PSG side missing an injured Neymar were dumped out in the last 16. That was one of three consecutive exits in the first knockout round for PSG, who have failed to make their mark on the Champions League despite all the money spent by their Qatari owners. So the inevitable question at the start of another continental campaign is can Thomas Tuchel's team this time at least reach a semi-final in Europe's elite club competition? Last season it was Manchester United who embarrassed PSG. Since 2012 the only teams PSG have beaten in a Champions League knockout tie are Valencia, Bayer Leverkusen and Chelsea. For now, PSG will just be eager to make a statement in their opening match. But with Galatasaray and Club Brugge the other teams in Group A, it would be a monumental surprise if PSG failed to progress, even with Neymar suspended for the first three matches. The world's most expensive player has overshadowed everything else at the club in recent months, with the saga of his hoped-for move back to Barcelona and then his return to action at the weekend, featuring a brilliant winner against Strasbourg in response to boos from angry supporters. ""I am very pleased because now it is finished,"" said Tuchel of the transfer saga. Tuchel always wanted Neymar to stay. Saturday's goal -- his 52nd in 59 games for the club -- illustrated why. ""My head is 100 percent focused on PSG. I will give everything, as I have at every club I have played for,"" said Neymar. ""Unfortunately in the last two years I have had serious injuries and I have missed a lot of matches. But when I have played I have performed, and I think my statistics have been among the best of my career."" There is no doubt the presence of Neymar gives PSG a far greater chance of winning the biggest prize in European club football, as long as he stays fit. As well as Neymar's suspension against Real, Kylian Mbappe is still out with a hamstring injury, but the arrival of Mauro Icardi has added another explosive element to their attack. Icardi was prolific for Inter before being stripped of the club captaincy last season amid a contract dispute. He signed on loan just before the transfer deadline. It is elsewhere that Paris really needed to strengthen, though. Tuchel was unable to settle on a first-choice goalkeeper last season between Alphonse Areola and Gianluigi Buffon. Both have since left and Keylor Navas has signed from Real Madrid to take over the gloves. Abdou Diallo has provided an extra option in defence after arriving from Borussia Dortmund. There has been major surgery in the midfield with the signings of Ander Herrera, Idrissa Gueye and Pablo Sarabia. Whether Marco Verratti can blend with the newcomers to form a midfield as fearsome as it was in the days when he was flanked by Blaise Matuidi and the peerless Thiago Motta, remains to be seen. Neymar is still there but, brilliant as he is, PSG know from experience that the Brazilian alone will not win them the Champions League. ""If we succeed in our group with these players, if we create a positive atmosphere in the squad, with all the potential we have, we can maybe do something big when we get to March,"" sporting director Leonardo told RMC Radio. ""Honestly I think we can become a very strong team."""

PSG will also be without Neymar, who scored an added time winner against Strasbourg in his first start of the season on Sunday, as he has to serve a three-match suspension in the Champions League for insulting the referee following his side's elimination by Manchester United last season. PSG have Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and recently arrived Mauro Icardi as options in the centre of attack."
216,13/09/2019,15:22,Neymar could make PSG return Saturday: Tuchel,Neymar could return to action for Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday following four months of absence after the Brazilian was selected in the matchday squad for the Ligue 1 match against Strasbourg.,"PSG coach Thomas Tuchel said on Friday: ""We have 'Ney' in our squad, for sure"", adding ""he needs to make his comeback"". Neymar, the world's most expensive player, has had to come to terms with the prospect of a third season in Ligue 1 after PSG and his former club Barcelona failed to agree terms on a move before the transfer window shut on September 2. The 27-year-old has since been away on international duty for Brazil in two friendly matches in the United States, scoring one goal and making another in a 2-2 draw with Colombia and then coming on as a substitute in a 1-0 loss to Peru. Those were his first appearances this season after he was left out of French champions PSG's opening four league games amid uncertainty over his future. Asked if he feared Neymar would receive a hostile reception from the Parc des Princes crowd after supporters held up a banner reading ""Neymar, get lost"" at a match in August when it appeared he was about to join Barcelona, Tuchel said the fans' reaction was beyond his control. ""I can understand that all the supporters are not happy at the moment. But I can't influence this reaction or control the supporters,"" Tuchel said. ""The only thing that I can control is my team."""

""I would be thrilled if Neymar came back,"" said the Argentine. ""I understand that not everyone agrees. That's normal after everything that happened around Ney, the way in which he left, the way he abandoned us. ""But when you look at the sporting angle, for me Neymar is one of the best players in the world and obviously would improve our chances of getting the results we want."" The summer transfer window saw an on-off soap opera surrounding the 27-year-old's apparent desire to leave PSG, who paid a world record 222 million euros ($264 million at the time) in 2017, with Barcelona and Real Madrid both linked. Ultimately he stayed in the French capital, at least for the time being. ""I am not disappointed,"" said Messi. ""I would have liked it if he had come and been with us but, as I have said, we have an exceptional squad to challenge for every title, even without him."" Messi denied reports he had used his influence to try and force the Barcelona board to push through the deal. ""Here, it is not me that gives the orders,"" he said. ""We never said that he had to be brought in. We didn't make any demands."" ""I don't know if the club (Barcelona) wanted it to happen. What I do know is that Neymar really wanted it. But I understand it is very difficult to negotiate with PSG."" Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu said on Friday Neymar ""did everything"" to force through a return to the Camp Nou in the close season, but his club could ""not meet"" the French champions' demands."
218,10/09/2019,21:53,Neymar rape accuser charged with extortion in Brazil,Police in Sao Paulo said Tuesday they will bring extortion and slander charges against a Brazilian model who accused football star Neymar of rape.,"Najila Trindade filed a rape complaint with Sao Paulo police upon her return from a trip to Paris in May in which she said she was assaulted by Neymar following a pre-arranged meeting. A judge dismissed the case in August, citing insufficient evidence. Instead, Sao Paulo prosecutors said in a statement that investigators had found ""indications of slanderous denunciation and extortion"" in the woman's accusation. A final decision on whether to prosecute Trindade will be left to a judge. Neymar, the world's most expensive footballer, has always protested his innocence, saying their relations were consensual. The case complicated an already tumultuous year for the 27-year-old Brazil star, who has yet to play for his club Paris Saint-Germain this season following injury and reports of an aborted return to previous club Barcelona. On Friday, Neymar played his first game since suffering an ankle injury in June, grabbing a second-half equalizer for Brazil in a 2-2 friendly draw with Colombia."
219,03/09/2019,00:59,Neymar and PSG left to pick up pieces as transfer saga ends,"Neymar's decision to join Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 was motivated by a desire to establish himself as the best player in the world, but a troubled time in the French capital has left the Brazilian at risk of wasting the best years of his career.","The closure of the transfer window has finally brought to an end the lengthy saga surrounding the future of the world's most expensive player, who will stay at PSG having failed to get the move back to Barcelona he craved. His former club could not complete a deal to rescue the 27-year-old from his apparent nightmare in Paris, with Neymar so determined to return that sports daily L'Equipe reported he offered to pay 20 million euros ($22 million) from his own pocket towards the fee. PSG paid 222 million euros ($264 million at the time) for his services, while committing reported wages of 36 million euros a year. Yet he has not done nearly enough at the Parc des Princes in two seasons marred by injuries and interrupted by off-field distractions. In August 2017, the desperation of PSG's Qatari owners to win the Champions League appeared to fit with Neymar's own obsession with emerging from Lionel Messi's shadow and winning the Ballon d'Or. ""I would love for us to meet in two years and see what his value will be compared to today. At least double,"" said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi at the time. However, since moving to the Parc des Princes, Neymar has appeared in barely half of his club's matches. When he has played he has frequently been brilliant, scoring 51 goals in 58 games. He has won back-to-back league titles and one Ligue 1 player of the year award. But the Champions League is what really matters, and when it has really mattered in Europe he has been absent. Foot injuries saw him miss three of the four Champions League knockout matches the club have played since his arrival. Without him, they lost in the last 16 to Real Madrid in 2018 and then to Manchester United this year. After suffering a broken foot for the first time in February 2018, Neymar missed the rest of PSG's season to be ready for the World Cup. Brazil went out in the quarter-finals. In January this year, Neymar fractured the same foot, missing the crunch part of PSG's season during three more months out. He has since missed the Copa America with an ankle injury and was accused of raping a Brazilian woman at a Paris hotel in May -- the case was dismissed in August by a Brazilian judge. Neymar has never learned French and has often appeared too busy with off-field distractions, including throwing lavish birthday parties and making a cameo appearance in his favourite Netflix series. He remains one of the biggest sporting celebrities on the planet, but he must put the last few months behind him quickly and deliver, otherwise there may well be nobody rich enough who is willing to take a chance on buying him next year. PSG supporters have made clear their unhappiness towards Neymar, yet those feelings can still change if he brings success on the pitch. In the boardroom, there is also the realisation of his commercial value -- when Neymar arrived, Al-Khelaifi spoke of ""a project of two brands: we're associating the Neymar brand and the PSG brand."" They have since signed major sponsorship and endorsement deals with the likes of Nike, with Neymar's presence alongside Kylian Mbappe playing a major role. ""PSG are a young club who need a big media profile to help them develop. That is what Neymar has brought, just like Zlatan (Ibrahimovic) or (David) Beckham before him,"" French sports marketing specialist Jerome Neveu told AFP. Ending the Neymar experiment might have allowed PSG to start afresh, although Mbappe and coach Thomas Tuchel had stated their wish that he stays. ""I like Neymar, I want to keep playing with him, with Kylian and with everyone,"" said Tuchel recently. Now all eyes will be on Neymar to see if he can put this episode to bed, although his three-game Champions League suspension means it may be some time yet before he makes any genuine impact."

He has joined PSG on a four year deal and while no fee has been confirmed the Spanish press say it was 15 million euros ($16.5 million). Navas was voted best 'keeper in the Champions League in 2018, when he also won UEFA's goalkeeper of the year award. In their bid for European glory PSG have tried several goalkeepers in recent seasons with German Kevin Trapp and Italians Salvatore Sirigu and Gianluigi Buffon, at 40, all falling short. Navas told the PSG website he was relishing the challenge as gatekeeper for PSG's European quest. ""I come here today with great emotion,"" said the 86 times capped Navas voted second best stopper at the 2014 World Cup behind German Manuel Neuer. ""After my Spanish experience, I arrive in France with big ambitions. Paris Saint-Germain is a prestigious club in Latin America and I'm delighted to join a club with such ambitions,"" he said. The 26-year-old Areola joins Madrid on loan with a purchase option and will likely be backup to Belgian stopper Thibaut Courtois."

However, PSG coach Thomas Tuchel confirmed later at a press conference that the Brazilian would not play against Metz in Ligue 1 on Friday. ""Neymar is not with the squad because it is the same situation as before Toulouse (last week's game). Nothing has changed,"" said Tuchel, who also has Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani out injured just now. Earlier on Thursday, Italian broadcaster Sky Sport claimed PSG had finally agreed to sell Neymar back to Barcelona, two years after signing him for 222 million euros ($264 million at the time). Meanwhile, Catalan radio station RAC1 reported that Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu was in Monaco -- where the Champions League group stage draw was due to take place on Thursday evening -- and would take part in negotiations with PSG. Neymar, scorer of 51 goals in 58 appearances in his two years at PSG, has not featured at all for his current club this season amid the uncertainty surrounding his future."
225,27/08/2019,23:32,Neymar fulfils Netflix 'dream' as Barca say transfer deal 'closer',"Neymar said he had ""realised"" his dream with a cameo appearance in his favourite Netflix show as later Tuesday there was a fresh plot twist in his long-running Paris Saint-Germain transfer drama.","The Brazil forward is anxious for a move back to Spain with both Barcelona and Real Madrid trying to seal a deal before the European transfer window closes next Monday. ""We are continuing negotiations, we are closer to a deal,"" Barca director Javier Bordas told reporters at Barcelona airport after returning from a meeting with PSG in the French capital. But he added: ""As yet there is still no deal."" According to French newspaper Le Parisien, Neymar's former club have upped their offer to 170 million euros, payable in two instalments, with possibly players attached. Barca sold the 27-year-old to PSG in 2017 for a world record 222 million euros. Earlier Neymar tweeted his delight at appearing in the Netflix crime drama La Casa de Papel (Money Heist). He was originally edited out by pending the outcome of his rape case. Once Brazilian police dropped their investigation last month, Netflix re-released the episodes to include the Paris Saint-Germain forward. ""I was able to realize my dream and be part of my favorite series. And now I can share Joao (his character) with you all! Thank you @lacasadepapel!"" he told his Twitter followers. The world's most expensive player has a small role in Season 3 of the crime drama, which follows a gang of robbers and their assault on the Bank Of Spain. ""I don't like football nor partying,"" Neymar's character says. ""At the World Cup, I always pray for our team,"" he adds. Neymar was accused by Najila Trindade, a Brazilian model of rape in a Paris hotel in May.

226,26/08/2019,14:28,PSG lose Mbappe for a month with hamstring injury,"Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappe will be out for four weeks and Edinson Cavani for three weeks after both came off injured in a Ligue 1 match against Toulouse on Sunday, the French champions have confirmed.","French World Cup-winning star Mbappe limped off after hurting his left hamstring during a trademark sprint in PSG's 4-0 win at the Parc des Princes. The injury means he will miss PSG's opening Champions League group game, which is set for September 17 or 18. He is also set to sit out three league matches as well as France's Euro 2020 qualifiers at home to Albania and Andorra early next month. Fellow forward Cavani came off with a hip injury in the same game and PSG confirmed the Uruguayan will be out for three weeks, meaning he could be ready in time for the start of their Champions League campaign. The injuries come as uncertainty continues to surround Neymar. The Brazilian's desired move back to Spain has yet to materialise with just a week remaining before the European transfer window closes. However, even if he stays, the world's most expensive player is suspended for the first three games of this season's Champions League."
227,25/08/2019,23:02,"Cavani, Mbappe injured as PSG's problems pile up despite win",Paris Saint-Germain lost star strikers Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe to injuries on Sunday as the French champions' problems continued to mount despite a 4-0 thrashing of Toulouse.,"Thomas Tuchel's men, who lost at Rennes last time out, have seen the start of their season dominated by the Neymar transfer saga. The Brazilian was once again left out of the matchday squad at the Parc des Princes amid rumours of a move to Real Madrid or return to Barcelona, and Tuchel saw his strikeforce totally dismantled as Cavani and Mbappe both hobbled off -- as did centre-back Abdou Diallo. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting scored a second-half double, but only after coming on as a substitute for the injured Cavani, while Mbappe also departed the scene after appearing to pull up with a hamstring injury following a trademark burst into the box. The capital-city giants sit three points behind early Ligue 1 pace-setters Rennes, who made it three wins from three by beating Strasbourg 2-0. Tuchel responded to last weekend's defeat by making three changes to his starting XI, including dropping captain Thiago Silva to the bench. Mbappe twice came close to settling any early nerves in the first four minutes, but was denied both times by Toulouse goalkeeper Baptiste Reynet. With Neymar looking increasingly likely to be heading to the exit door, PSG's woes deepened when they lost another member of their fabled 'MCN' forward line as Cavani left the pitch in the 14th minute to be replaced by the usually much less potent Choupo-Moting. Silva was introduced before half-time as Diallo, a close-season signing from Borussia Dortmund, also broke down injured. The home side started the second period well, though, and it was Choupo-Moting -- whose stint at PSG has so far been best known for a shocking miss last season against Strasbourg -- who turned past one defender, span around another, and drilled the ball into the bottom corner. Visiting left-back Mathieu Goncalves scored a calamitous 55th-minute own goal by slicing a tame, bouncing ball away from Reynet's gloves and into the roof of the net. A difficult night for PSG got worse when Angel Di Maria, who would be expected to step up in the possible absences of Neymar, Cavani and Mbappe, saw a penalty comfortably saved by Reynet. But former Stoke player Choupo-Moting suggested he may be able to shoulder some of the burden, slotting in his second and PSG's third with 15 minutes remaining before Marquinhos' late header added further gloss to the scoreline. Earlier on Sunday, Rennes backed up their shock win over PSG last weekend with victory at Strasbourg. Julien Stephan's side, who also stunned PSG to win last season's French Cup, saw off 10-man Strasbourg thanks to goals in either half from Clement Grenier and M'Baye Niang to maintain their 100-percent start to the season. Elsewhere, Monaco's miserable form continued as they blew a 2-0 half-time lead to be held to a 2-2 draw by fellow strugglers Nimes in the principality. Close-season signings Islam Slimani and Wissam Ben Yedder put Leonardo Jardim's men, who only narrowly avoided relegation last term, in control at the break. But Brazilian centre-back Jemerson's 55th-minute red card changed the game, before Romain Philippoteaux and 18-year-old Togolese Kevin Denkey struck to grab Nimes a point. The referee threatened to halt the game due to Nimes fans insulting French league chiefs with offensive language. The league has mooted the idea of introducing a list of banned words in stadiums in an attempt to combat homophobia and bad language, but Nimes supporters hit back by telling them to ""go fuck yourselves"". A message over the PA system was read out to fans warning them to stop the chants or the game could be stopped, before the match continued with the Monaco supporters joining in with their Nimes counterparts."

Neymar arrived amid deafening fanfare from Barcelona two years ago as the world's most expensive player in a 222 million euros deal.

Paris paid 222 million euros to sign Neymar from Barcelona two years ago and their sporting director Leonardo is understood to be determined to only sell the forward for a deal considered to be of the same value.

Meanwhile, Barcelona remain hopeful of bringing Neymar back to the Camp Nou, but Catalan daily Sport claims an attempt to sign the player on loan with an obligation to buy for 160 million euros at the end of the season has been firmly rejected in Paris. Sport claims Barcelona feel ""it is very clear that PSG are trying to prevent the Brazilian from returning to the Camp Nou in any scenario"". PSG had previously reportedly turned down an offer from Barcelona of 40 million euros plus Philippe Coutinho and Ivan Rakitic. Coutinho has since joined Bayern on loan.

PSG were without forward Neymar for a third successive game this term with the world's most expensive player continuing to be the subject of interest from Barcelona and Real Madrid. Angolan-born 16-year-old Eduardo Camavinga starred in Rennes midfield, and proved to be key in his team's winning goal, along with experienced playmaker Clement Grenier. Rennes boss Julien Stephan said Camavinga, the first player born since January 2002 to feature in Europe's top five leagues, had continued to improve since making his first team debut in April. ""It's more than six months he's been training with the professionals. He's settled in well with the squad,"" he told broadcaster Canal+. ""We've prepared him with the players, the staff and the whole club so he can evolve in the right conditions. ""He started doing it at the end of last season and he's confirming all the talent we think he has at the start of this season,"" he added. PSG skipper Thiago Silva admitted his side stepped off the gas after their good start through Cavani's effort. ""We started well but we eased off a bit, I don't know why, we lost concentration,"" he told Canal+. ""It wasn't the real PSG. Rennes played well, they were solid defensively, they were more careful than us,"" he added. The Parisians dominated the early proceedings and showed their quality with two good chances within the opening quarter of an hour of play. Firstly Julian Draxler's half-volley skimmed over the bar before Cavani's header hit the post after 14 minutes. Uruguay forward Cavani made up for hitting the woodowrk by scoring 20 minutes later after a defensive howler from Rennes captain Damien da Silva. The centre-back received the ball in his own box but his mis-placed pass to goalkeeper Romain Salin was intercepted by Cavani who tucked it away to make it 1-0. The sides were back level just before the half-time whistle. Right-back Hamari Traore found Niang in the box with a soft cross and the Senegal forward took two light touches, held-off Marquinhos before smoothly curling his effort past Alphonse Areola. The Bretons took the lead than four minutes later of the second-half following a sublime cross from Camavinga. Midfielder Camavinga found a free Del Castillo, starting instead of suspended Flavien Tait, who easily beat Areola with a header. The hosts refused to settle for the one-goal advantage and had a superb chance to make it 3-1 on 62 minutes. Benjamin Bourigeaud played his corner to front post and centre-back Jeremy Gelin's header glanced past Areola but hit the post and dribble out for a goal-kick. Youngster Camavinga could have added a third himself but his half-volley skied over the crossbar. Kylian Mbappe and Cavani had a late chances but they could not save PSG and Thomas Tuchel's blushes, losing to the side who finished in 10th place in the league last season. Earlier on Sunday Saint-Etienne salvaged a late point at home to promoted Brest with new signing Denis Bouanga's 83rd minute effort claiming a 1-1 draw and it finished goalless between Reims and Strasbourg."
232,16/08/2019,05:01,PSG and French football braced for Neymar exit,"The saga of Neymar's seemingly inevitable departure from Paris Saint-Germain is proving a long, drawn out affair bringing the curtain down on what will ultimately feel like a fleeting and failed experiment.","Having arrived in France in 2017 hoping a world-record transfer to PSG would help him emerge from the shadow of Lionel Messi at Barcelona and win the Ballon d'Or, two years on he looks set to leave with his reputation having taken a serious hit. There is no doubting the 27-year-old forward is a brilliant player, and there is every chance he will get the success he craves -- collectively and, chiefly, individually -- by returning to Spain, whether with his old club or Real Madrid. However, there is every reason to believe a Kylian Mbappe-led PSG, and football in France in general, will ultimately be better off without him. The French champions' first Ligue 1 game of the campaign last Sunday, a 3-0 win against Nimes, saw supporters unfurl banners insulting the 222 million-euro ($264 million at the time) man. Neymar himself was not involved in that game, left out amid the uncertainty over his future. He already missed the season-opening Champions Trophy against Rennes in China due to suspension. Since moving to the Parc des Princes, he has played in almost exactly half of his club's matches. When he has been on the field he has frequently been brilliant, scoring 51 goals in 58 games, but when it has really mattered he has been absent.

233,15/08/2019,13:48,PSG and French football braced as Neymar exit,"The saga of Neymar's seemingly inevitable departure from Paris Saint-Germain is proving a long, drawn out affair bringing the curtain down on what will ultimately feel like a fleeting and failed experiment.","Having arrived in France in 2017 hoping a world-record transfer to PSG would help him emerge from the shadow of Lionel Messi at Barcelona and win the Ballon d'Or, two years on he looks set to leave with his reputation having taken a serious hit. There is no doubting the 27-year-old forward is a brilliant player, and there is every chance he will get the success he craves -- collectively and, chiefly, individually -- by returning to Spain, whether with his old club or Real Madrid. However, there is every reason to believe a Kylian Mbappe-led PSG, and football in France in general, will ultimately be better off without him. The French champions' first Ligue 1 game of the campaign last Sunday, a 3-0 win against Nimes, saw supporters unfurl banners insulting the 222 million-euro ($264 million at the time) man. Neymar himself was not involved in that game, left out amid the uncertainty over his future. He already missed the season-opening Champions Trophy against Rennes in China due to suspension. Since moving to the Parc des Princes, he has played in almost exactly half of his club's matches. When he has been on the field he has frequently been brilliant, scoring 51 goals in 58 games, but when it has really mattered he has been absent. Foot injuries saw him miss three of the four Champions League knockout matches the Qatar-owned club have played in since his arrival. Without him, they lost in the last 16 to Real Madrid in 2018 and then to Manchester United this year. ""I like Neymar, I want to keep playing with him, with Kylian and with everyone,"" coach Thomas Tuchel said last weekend. ""But the reality is that we must find solutions without 'Ney'.

Maxwell, who has held the post at PSG since 2017 after five years as a player at the club, has denied the accusations. ""For the good of my children, I will prove my total innocence and show that this is all a lie,"" said Maxwell in a statement in June. According to Le Parisien, the former left-back was no longer able to combine his activities in France with the preparations of his legal defence in Brazil. However, PSG has proposed to the club that he represents them as an ambassador in Brazil. Sports daily L'Equipe reports that Maxwell is due to discuss the future with the club over the coming days."

""The medical staff will evaluate more precisely how long he will be sidelined depending on how the injury heals, currently estimated at 15 to 21 days,"" the club said on their website.

236,11/08/2019,23:42,"PSG start title defence with win, fans vent fury at Neymar",Paris Saint-Germain brushed off the ongoing Neymar transfer saga by kicking off their Ligue 1 title defence with a straightforward 3-0 victory over Nimes on Sunday.,"The 27-year-old Neymar was left out of the squad the day after PSG sporting director Leonardo said talks about a possible sale of the Brazilian were ""more advanced than before"". On Sunday, coach Thomas Tuchel told Canal+ he had ""no news"" on Neymar's future and that he would have to ""find solutions without"" him. Edinson Cavani's controversial VAR penalty in the 24th minute set PSG on their way at the Parc des Princes, after supporters had made their negative feelings towards the absent Neymar clear. A fine second-half display from Kylian Mbappe -- with a goal and an assist for Angel Di Maria -- showed Tuchel the obvious solution to Neymar's impending exit, and gave the capital club a perfect start to their bid for a third straight French title and ninth in total. ""We are not going to lie. We will see what happens with Neymar -- but it's not the same team,"" said Mbappe. PSG sit level with Lyon, who beat Monaco 3-0 on Friday, at the top of the fledgling table, and will be hoping to occupy that position for the rest of the season. Former Barcelona forward Neymar's two years in the French capital since PSG made him the world's most expensive player have been plagued by injuries and controversies. Home fans unfurled a banner before kick-off translating to ""Neymar. Get out"". Other banners slammed his recent comment that his fondest memory in football was inspiring Barcelona's stunning 2017 Champions League comeback against PSG, while one called Neymar ""heartless"". Neymar has been linked with a return to Barca or a move to their arch rivals Real Madrid. Tuchel handed Ligue 1 debuts to centre-back Abdou Diallo, signed from Borussia Dortmund in the close-season, and midfielder Pablo Sarabia, who joined from Sevilla. The champions monopolised the ball from the off, with Mbappe shooting straight at visiting goalkeeper Paul Bernardoni after jinking through the massed Nimes defence. They were awarded a penalty by VAR midway through the first half, as a corner struck Nimes defender Pablo Martinez on the arm after Diallo ducked under the ball while standing right in front of him. Cavani slammed the spot-kick into the net, before Nimes coach Bernard Blaquart was booked for his protestations. A pedestrian affair, with Nimes happy to almost exclusively keep all 11 men behind the ball, had to wait until the 57th minute for a second goal when Mbappe slotted in to open his league account for the campaign. Di Maria came off the bench and drilled into the bottom corner after an excellent pass from Mbappe with 20 minutes remaining, and PSG played out the most comfortable of wins -- finishing with 74 percent of possession as goalkeeper Alphonse Areola did not face a shot on target. Earlier on Sunday, new signing Victor Osimhen marked his Ligue 1 debut with two goals as last year's runners-up Lille kicked off their new campaign with a 2-1 victory over Nantes. Christophe Galtier's hosts, who finished 16 points behind PSG last term, were indebted to Nigerian Osimhen, who scored a fabulous 80th-minute winner at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. ""When I have opportunities, I don't want to miss them,"" said the 20-year-old. ""I'm not yet 100 percent but I'm training hard and I know that with time I'll be in top shape physically."""
237,10/08/2019,14:46,"Neymar out of PSG opener, exit talks 'more advanced than before' - club","Paris Saint-Germain revealed on Saturday that Neymar transfer talks are ""more advanced than before"" after the Brazilian was dropped for the French champions' opening Ligue 1 match.","Sporting director Leonardo confirmed to reporters that the Brazilian was near the exit door but that PSG were ""not yet ready to give their approval (to the transfer)"" ahead of Sunday's match at the Parc des Princes. Real Madrid or a return to Barcelona are the most likely destinations for the world's most expensive footballer, with Spanish media on Friday saying that Zinedine Zidane's side will battle Barca for the 27-year-old's signature. Sports newspaper AS claimed Neymar has been offered to Madrid by PSG, who are open to selling if they can either recoup the 222 million euros ($249 million) they spent on him in 2017 or receive half that amount with players included in the deal. Barcelona-based Mundo Deportivo says that he would prefer a move back to Catalonia to play alongside former teammates Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. Neymar started the new season by angering the Qatari-backed club when he turned up one week late for training. The player's camp maintained he had a prior agreement to stay away but that didn't wash with his employers who threatened to take ""appropriate action"". Off the pitch, Neymar was informed by a Brazilian judge on Friday that the rape case which has been hanging over the footballer for months had been dismissed due to insufficient evidence. Neymar had vehemently denied allegations he raped a Brazilian woman in a Paris hotel in May. The forward, whose time in France has been marked by injuries and controversies, has made a series of remarks that strained his relationship further with the club and sparked outrage on social media. Asked by an online sports channel about his best memory in football, he cited Barcelona's incredible 2017 Champions League victory over PSG when he was part of the team that overturned a 4-0 first-leg deficit by winning 6-1 in the second leg of their last-16 tie."

""The state clubs are a new phenomenon and present a danger that football has not seen before,"" he told the Totally Football Show podcast. ""They are operating entirely outside of the rules and risk inflating markets to disastrous levels through their financial doping."" City are under investigation by UEFA over alleged financial violations and the 57-year-old Spanish league chief called on the European game's governing body to take a stronger lead in controlling the issue. ""The governors of European football need to show a much stronger commitment to healthy domestic football,"" he said. ""This would include stricter financial controls that limit state clubs like Manchester City or PSG from vastly outspending their rivals and it would also include much firmer Financial Fair Play penalties, which have been a very weak deterrent up to this point. ""A state-run club would be totally against our financial rules in Spain. Any investor that wants to come into La Liga has to agree to our financial controls and we would not allow any investor that would create debt or inflate the market. We would not allow it to happen."" Tebas acknowledged Europe's biggest clubs, including Barcelona and Real Madrid from his own league, had always flexed their financial muscles. But he is adamant the threat posed by City and PSG's wealth is potentially more damaging as transfer fees have been inflated by their vast spending. ""Barcelona and Real Madrid have never received state support and have always been run in a financially responsible way,"" he said. ""Big clubs have always existed across Europe and it is true they can create distortion if there are no financial controls in place. ""In the case of Spain, we have spent the past years reducing levels of debt to historic lows and we do not want our biggest clubs to have more money if others do not."""
239,06/08/2019,02:30,Neymar speculation lingers as PSG aim to shatter glass ceiling,Interminable transfer rumours surrounding Neymar continue to swirl unabated as the new Ligue 1 season kicks off this weekend with defending champions Paris Saint-Germain launching their assault for a seventh title in eight attempts.,"Thomas Tuchel's side began their campaign by lifting the Champions Trophy in Shenzhen, China, gaining a modicum of revenge with a 2-1 victory over Rennes, the team that shocked PSG in last season's French Cup final. As Neymar served the last of a three-match ban, incurred after a spat with a fan following April's shootout loss, Kylian Mbappe pleaded with the Brazilian to stay during their trip to the Far East. ""Everyone loves him and I love him so much,"" Mbappe said of Neymar, the world's most expensive player who has been linked with a return to his former club Barcelona. ""I don't want him to leave the team, obviously. I want him to stay. When you think about his situation and then he plays very well and he co-operates with the team you can see what he means to us."" The Brazilian suffered another injury-plagued season, missing PSG's embarrassing Champions League defeat by Manchester United, as well as Brazil's triumphant Copa America campaign. The 27-year-old has also been embroiled in widely publicised rape allegations, vehemently denied, which were eventually dismissed by Brazilian police for lack of evidence. Amid Neymar's tumult Mbappe, who took the 2018 World Cup by storm, tormented Ligue 1 defences to the tune of 33 goals to emerge as the club's true poster boy. Mbappe moved to quell any doubts over his own plans, having caused alarm when he spoke of playing ""elsewhere"" at the French league awards ceremony in May. ""I think it wasn't the right place (to say that),"" the 20-year-old said while in China. ""I'd like to say sorry to the players who were there, because I spoiled the party."" Last season's title race quickly turned into a cakewalk for PSG, but after a domestic treble in 2017/18 under Unai Emery, his successor fell short in both domestic cups. Despite that disappointment the brief for Tuchel a year on remains unchanged with PSG desperately craving success in Europe, after another calamitous exit. ""It hurts a lot, it hurts still that we did not go through,"" midfielder Julian Draxler told AFP, five months on. ""But from the potential in the team, we are ready to go far in the Champions League."" While PSG have crashed out at the last-16 stage in Europe each of the past three years, it is almost unfathomable they could be dethroned in France with last season's chief rivals losing a number of key players. Lille sold leading scorer Nicolas Pepe to Arsenal for a reported £72 million ($87 million), while Lyon head into the new campaign without Nabil Fekir, Tanguy Ndombele and Ferland Mendy. Fekir left his boyhood club for Real Betis, Mendy signed for Real Madid, and Ndombele became Tottenham's record signing in a deal that could rise to 70 million euros. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Lyon have struggled in pre-season under new boss Sylvinho, the former Barcelona and Arsenal full-back. Sporting director and club legend Juninho, who handpicked his compatriot to replace Bruno Genesio, said the start of the campaign would be a ""moment of truth"" after limp displays against Liverpool and Bournemouth. The arrival of Andre Villas-Boas, who was out of football for 18 months, at Marseille makes for an intriguing prosect. The former protege of Jose Mourinho has pledged to do his all to restore the 1993 Champions League winners to the top after they failed to qualify for Europe last season, prompting the dismissal of Rudi Garcia."

The 20-year-old Mbappe, who smashed 33 goals for PSG last season, also doused any lingering concerns over his own plans after he talked about playing ""elsewhere"" at the French league awards ceremony in May. ""I think it wasn't the right place (to say that),"" he told reporters in southern Chinese city. ""I'd like to say sorry to the players who were there, because I spoiled the party."" It has been a troubled few months for Neymar, who earned a three-match ban after an altercation with a fan as Rennes stunned PSG on penalties to win the French Cup in April. Neymar also missed Brazil's triumphant Copa America campaign on home soil after suffering an ankle injury in a warm-up friendly against Qatar. And the 27-year-old has been embroiled in rape allegations, vehemently denied, which were dismissed by Brazilian police on Monday for lack of evidence. ""He is still the same Neymar,"" said Mbappe of his team-mate, who trained with the rest of the squad on Friday. ""We all know he is in very special circumstances. However he is training with us and he is still performing his best which is not unusual and after all he is a very good player."" Mbappe said he hoped to improve on his 33-goal tally next season, adding that Qatar-owned PSG also want to take the elusive next step in the Champions League. ""We're going to try to win the two national trophies, to not leave matches to chance,"" he said. ""After that there's the Champions League, which everyone's looking at... we have to take that step. ""We've found our way blocked the last few years. It's up to us to find a way to go as far as possible."""

Tuchel is under pressure to take PSG deep into the Champions League in the forthcoming season, while successfully defending their Ligue 1 title is almost a formality. Tuchel was not forthcoming on the future of Neymar, saying he had ""no news"", after the Brazilian made it clear that he wants to return to Barcelona. ""For me, he's our player... it (his future) is a question between him and the club,"" was all Tuchel would say. But he was forthright about what he wants from his star-studded squad, which earlier in the day was embellished by the arrival of Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye. With PSG playing Rennes in the domestic Trophee des Champions on Saturday in Shenzhen, Tuchel said: ""We have to be ready, there are still a lot of things to improve. ""It's a question of team effort, the intensity that we are willing to give, the closeness that we play all together against the ball, the sacrifices that we are willing to make. ""If we are willing to make sacrifices, if we are willing to go over all obstacles, then for sure we are ready. ""But if we have big spaces, if we don't all play together, for sure we will not be ready."" Kylian Mbappe was earlier the star of the show once more for PSG, scoring an eye-catching first goal in sweltering Suzhou. Strike partner Edinson Cavani also scored in the first half before substitute Metehan Guclu netted with a clever flick a minute from time. In the absence of Neymar, who is working his way back to full fitness after injury and could feature on Saturday, the French starlet Mbappe was the focus of attention. There was a buzz of anticipation each time the 20-year-old prodigy received the ball. The World Cup winner put Tuchel's side on the way to a comfortable friendly win as he exchanged passes with Juan Bernat before firing beyond Sydney goalkeeper Andrew Redmayne.

245,30/07/2019,02:16,Brazil police end Neymar rape probe over lack of evidence,"Police in Brazil probing rape allegations against football superstar Neymar have closed the case due to a lack of evidence, the Sao Paulo attorney general's office said Monday.","The police decision will be sent to prosecutors on Tuesday, who will have 15 days to evaluate the case, a spokeswoman for the attorney general's office told AFP. A final ruling on the case will be made by a judge. A spokesman for Neymar said he was not able to comment on the police decision. Sao Paulo police are due to hold a news conference on Tuesday. Neymar has vehemently denied allegations he raped a Brazilian woman in a Paris hotel in May. The ugly affair, which has dominated headlines and conversations in the soccer-mad country for weeks, overshadowed Brazil's preparations for the Copa America. Hosts Brazil went on to win South America's showcase tournament earlier this month without their biggest player, who was injured in a warm-up friendly before the opening match. The scandal blew up on June 2 when Neymar published a seven-minute video on Instagram, where he had first been in contact with Najila Trindade, revealing that he had been accused of rape. In an attempt to defend himself against the allegations, Neymar's video was accompanied by WhatsApp messages and images of his encounter with Trindade -- without her consent, possibly breaking Brazilian law. The drama quickly snowballed. Extracts of a televised interview with Trindade, in which she accused Neymar of ""aggression together with rape,"" aired just one hour before he was about to enter the pitch for the pre-Copa game between Brazil and Qatar. Neymar tore his right ankle ligament in the 20th minute, ruling him out of the tournament. In the following weeks, Neymar was questioned by police over the WhatsApp messages. He also appeared before police in Sao Paulo, where Trindade had filed her complaint at the end of May. As the case dragged on, police filed a defamation suit against Trindade -- who was dropped by multiple lawyers -- after she insinuated the force was corrupt. ""The police are bought, aren't they? Or am I crazy?"" she told television channel SBT last month in response to questions over the police investigation of an alleged theft of a tablet device from her home that contained a short video she claims has conclusive evidence she was assaulted. Despite the seriousness of the allegations, polls have shown that most Brazilians believe Neymar is innocent. Controversy has followed the Paris Saint-Germain player, who flew back to France earlier this month. Neymar, who joined PSG in 2017, has made clear he wants to return to Barcelona. He has yet to feature during PSG's pre-season tour in Asia and French media reported he will miss Tuesday's game against Sydney in China."

""I have never heard him say he wanted to leave,"" Verratti told French broadcaster RMC. ""Beyond that I don't know what he has been saying to the club. ""When a player wants to leave, the club should let him leave. Depending on the financial conditions agreed by the club of course. But you can't keep a player who wants to leave,"" the 26-year-old added. The world's most expensive footballer who joined the French champions for 222 million euros ($252 million) is yet to feature during their pre-season tour in Asia and French media reported he will miss Tuesday's game against Sydney in China. He will also sit out the French Champions Trophy against Rennes in Shenzhen next Saturday as he completes a six-match domestic ban for an incident involving a fan the last time the teams met, in the French Cup final. ""Of course I would be disappointed to see him leave, he's a great player,"" Verratti said, who has been ruled out of the fixture against the Australians. ""It's between him and the club,"" the Italy international addded."

PSG play Sydney FC in a friendly on Tuesday in Suzhou, China, but Draxler already has his mind on what promises to be another big season for the club and him personally. Draxler, part of Germany's 2014 World Cup-winning squad, said it was ""a pleasure"" to play with the attacking triumvirate of Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe -- even though it has its challenges. The Brazilian star Neymar, who is in China but will not be involved in the match as he works his way towards full fitness, has made clear that he wants to return to Barcelona. ""All of them are exceptional players, it is hard to find in the world players of this level,"" said Draxler, who arrived in the French capital in January 2017 for a reported 36 million euros from Wolfsburg. ""But of course they have their own minds, their own heads, they live football, they want to score every game, so they have an ego. ""So sometimes it's not easy for the whole team, but if you are lucky enough to play alongside these players, it's just a pleasure every day."" Like Neymar, Draxler -- who has more than 50 caps for Germany -- has been linked with a move away from the perennial French champions, having been in and out of the starting XI. Asked how he would summarise his time in France so far, Draxler blew out his cheeks and paused. ""It's two-and-a-half years now since I arrived and I won a lot of (domestic) titles so I am happy about that,"" he said. ""I became a better player than I was before, so that's positive, but what is negative is what we achieved in the Champions League. ""We did not go far in the Champions League and that was one of the goals when I signed."" Bankrolled by Qatari money and coached by Draxler's fellow German Thomas Tuchel, PSG went out in the last 16 of the Champions League after conceding a late goal home to an injury-hit Manchester United. ""It hurts a lot, it hurts still that we did not go through,"" said Draxler, five months on. ""But from the potential in the team, we are ready to go far in the Champions League."" Draxler was linked over the summer with Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen and Tottenham Hotspur, but he made it clear that he is focused only on showing PSG what he can do. He said that he has ""space to improve -- a lot"". ""I am almost 26 and I think the best years of my career are coming now, I hope so. ""Now I am a good age: I have experience but I am still young,"" he added. ""Hopefully the fans and the club will see the best version of Julian in the next season."""
248,28/07/2019,17:33,Neymar to miss PSG's final Asian matches: reports,"Neymar will not feature in Paris Saint-Germain's last two games of their pre-season tour of Asia, French media reported on Sunday.","PSG play Sydney FC in Suzhou on Tuesday but, sports daily L'Equipe reported, Neymar, who missed Brazil's victorious Copa America campaign with an ankle injury, and defender Presnel Kimpembe will stay behind in Shenzhen to work on their fitness. The world's most expensive player sat out the defeat on penalties to Inter Milan in Macao on Saturday. He will also miss the French Champions Trophy against Rennes in Shenzhen next Saturday as he completes a six-match domestic ban for an incident involving a fan the last time the teams met, in the French Cup final. If Neymar, who has made clear he wants to return to Barcelona, is still at the Parc des Princes he could feature in the club's Ligue 1 opener on August 11 against Nimes."
249,27/07/2019,17:20,Inter edge Neymar-less PSG on penalties,Portuguese midfielder Joao Mario scored the final spot-kick as Inter Milan beat Neymar-less Paris Saint-Germain on penalties in Macau on Saturday.,"With their want-away Brazilian superstar left out of the trip to the former Portuguese colony, PSG were seconds from victory before Samuele Longo's injury-time equaliser made it 1-1. Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic saved from Adil Aouchiche and then Arthur Zagre before Mario stepped up to slot the winner for Inter, who edged the penalties 6-5. The win for Antonio Conte's side comes just days after they lost to Italian rivals Juventus on penalties in a friendly in China. Neymar, linked with a move back to his former club Barcelona, remained in China's Shenzhen, PSG's previous stop on their Asian tour, while his team-mates flew to gambling enclave Macau. During a scrappy game in sweltering Macau, Inter were quicker out of the blocks forcing three fine stops from PSG's Alphonse Areola in the first 10 minutes. New signing Stefano Sensi and Ivan Perisic were instrumental in the early Inter attack, producing quick probing passes and causing problems behind the PSG defence. In Neymar's absence it was French World Cup-winner Kylian Mbappe who drew cheers from the 8,800-strong crowd with his driving runs, although he was often let down by his final touch. Just before halftime Mbappe was brought down by Milan Skriniar and new signing Pablo Sarabia floated a free kick which a climbing Thilo Kehrer glanced into the net. Inter leapt into the attack in the second half, with Perisic jinking his way into the box to force another fine save from Areola, before sending the rebound soaring over the bar. Inter continued to squander chances, and the heat added to their frustration, with Perisic seeing another chance creep over on 78 minutes. But in the last minute of injury time substitute Longo picked up a bobbling pass trickling through the PSG box to drive the ball into the bottom corner, past the otherwise rock-solid Areola, who thumped the ground in frustration. Penalties went to sudden death after PSG's Adil Aouchiche's effort was stopped by Handanovic, but Antonio Candreva's cheeky attempt to chip Areola backfired and glanced off the crossbar. It was up to Handanovic to make another fine stop from Arthur, before Mario calmly buried the crucial kick. ""We can play much better than we played today,"" PSG coach Thomas Tuchel said. ""The conditions were difficult, of course... but we didn't have a good structure, which was disappointing,"" he said, referring to the heat that saw the referee call several mini-breaks so that players could rehydrate. Next week PSG will take on Rennes, and seek payback for their cup final loss last season. For that fixture ""we need to be better organised... and we need to do some target practice,"" Tuchel said. Inter's battling performance was ""an important step in preparing"" for the upcoming Serie A season, said their boss Conte. Asked whether Romelu Lukaku would be leaving Manchester United to come to Milan for the campaign, he responded cryptically. ""He's a great player... but it is very difficult for me to tell you anything."""

""When you are a big player, when you are a star, it's normal every day that clubs want to buy you,"" former France international Djorkaeff, now a PSG club ambassador, told reporters. ""This is normal. This is the life of big star. I don't think it's a problem for him, actually it's good because he's here, this is the most important."" Earlier this month, PSG's new sporting director Leonardo opened the door to Neymar's departure ""if there is an offer that suits everyone"". Neymar joined PSG for a record 222 million euros in 2017 but his chances of returning to Barcelona cannot have been helped by the Catalan club's signing of France forward Antoine Griezmann. It has been a troubled summer for Neymar, who missed Brazil's triumphant Copa America campaign on home soil after suffering an ankle injury in a warm-up friendly against Qatar. In addition, he was questioned by Brazilian police last month over allegations he raped a woman he met through social media in a Paris hotel. He has denied the accusations."

Simons refused a contract worth 200,000 euros ($222,000) a year from Barcelona, a huge amount for a prospect from the club's training centre La Masia, according to Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo. He also walked away from a chance to be quickly integrated into Barcelona's youth team, the newspaper reported. The Dutch starlet, known for his long, curly hair, had earlier announced to his 1.7 million social media followers that he was quitting Barcelona, without saying where he was heading. The young player, whose agent is the influential Mino Raiola -- the agent of players such as Paul Pogba and Matthijs De Ligt among others -- joins a club desperate for European honours after years of heartache. Simons is expected to debut for the French champions in their youth team which plays in Youth Champions, a junior version of the Champions League."

The club threatened to take ""appropriate action"" against the world's most expensive player, who said he had stayed in Brazil to attend a charity five-a-side football tournament run by his foundation. Neymar, who joined PSG in 2017 for 222 million euros ($264 million at the time), rejoined the team a week later on July 15. He also didn't help the strained relationship by controversially saying that his best football memory was beating PSG when he played for Barcelona. Just days before rejoining PSG, he cited as his favourite football memory his role in the 2017 Barcelona team that overturned a 4-0 first-leg deficit by winning 6-1 in the second leg of their last-16 Champions League tie. He also recently posted a 10-second video of himself in a Barcelona shirt and a quote from the Bible: ""No weapon turned against you will prosper."" It has been a troubled summer for Neymar. He missed Brazil's triumphant Copa America campaign on home soil due to an ankle injury and was also questioned by Brazilian police over allegations he raped a woman -- accusations he denies. PSG referenced the ankle injury in its statement naming the squad on Tuesday, saying that ""daily physical work will continue and complete recovery and integration with the group is scheduled for training in China"". It added that x-rays of the fracture showed ""completely normal progress and a very good improvement"". PSG land in Shenzhen, China on Wednesday, and will play friendlies against Inter Milan in Macau on Saturday and Sydney FC in Suzhou on July 30. Their first competitive match of the season will be against Rennes in Shenzhen on August 3 in the Champions Trophy, the traditional curtain-raiser to the French campaign.

""He is a dynamic player who can play in several positions and offers us several possibilities to vary our game."" The 21-year-old attacking midfielder came through the PSG youth system and since making his debut in December 2015 has made 78 appearances scoring 11 times. He appeared in 22 Ligue 1 matches last season, starting 13 times, but did not play in the Champions League. ""I am looking forward to wearing the RB Leipzig jersey. I am convinced that the club's style of play suits me very well,"" said Nkunku. Although skilful and capable of dazzling play, Nkunku has often been erratic and PSG need to balance their books to meet Financial Fair Play regulations.

Al-Khelaifi's lawyers say they wrote to the three publications casting doubt on the authenticity of this letter, and asked to see it to prove the point. According to Mediapart the letter is from Al-Khelaifi to the chief of staff to the emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani asking for two million euros ($224 million) for Pastore's agent.

PSG officially began pre-season training last Monday but Neymar, linked with a move back to Barcelona, was not there, with the player's camp maintaining he had a prior agreement to stay away.

Earlier in the day, Neymar posted a 10-second video of himself in a Barcelona shirt and a quote from the Bible: ""No weapon turned against you will prosper.""

""My son plays for PSG, but he can't simply ignore his past. A past that led to him arriving at the French club,"" Neymar Senior added. It has been a troubled summer for the player, who missed Brazil's triumphant Copa America campaign on home soil after suffering an ankle injury in a warm-up friendly against Qatar in early June. In addition, he was questioned by Brazilian police last month over allegations he raped a woman he met through social media in a Paris hotel. He has denied the accusations. Meanwhile, PSG's new sporting director Leonardo -- a Brazilian like Neymar -- last week opened the door to the player leaving the club ""if there is an offer that suits everyone"". However, the chances of him returning to Barcelona, where he previously starred for four years, cannot have been helped by the completion of Antoine Griezmann's transfer to the Camp Nou from Atletico Madrid. That deal was completed on Friday when the Catalans activated Griezmann's 120 million-euro ($135 million) release clause. While Neymar has just returned to Paris, his teammates are due to play their first pre-season friendly on Tuesday away to German side Dynamo Dresden. Thomas Tuchel's team are also due to play at Nuremberg at the weekend before travelling to Asia to face Inter Milan in Macau on July 27. Their first competitive match of the season will be against Rennes in Shenzhen, China, on August 3 in the Champions Trophy, the traditional curtain-raiser to the French campaign. Assuming he remains a PSG player, Neymar will be suspended for that game as he completes a ban for lashing out at a fan following the club's shock defeat to Rennes in last season's French Cup final. Neymar is also banned for the first three matches of next season's Champions League group stage, a punishment for an angry outburst at match officials following PSG's last-16 loss against Manchester United in March."

An automatic choice for the German club last season with 28 Bundesliga matches and seven Champions League appearances, the France under-21 international would have more trouble establishing himself at PSG if the move goes through.

PSG coach Thomas Tuchel has been looking to strengthen in midfield after the capital club saw the jettisoned Adrien Rabiot join Juventus at the end of his contract.

""We are currently working on the phase of deciding which players we will not be keeping on next season,"" said Cardoner. ""We are recruiting no-one at the moment, especially not this player (Neymar) with whom we have had no contact.""

The 27-year-old spent four years at Camp Nou, winning the Champions League in 2015 and two La Liga titles in a potent attacking trio alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. Any return for Neymar would likely require Barca to raise funds through sales. Antoine Griezmann is expected to join from Atletico Madrid for 120 million euros while Frenkie de Jong has already signed for 75 million euros from Ajax.

""The appeal lodged by PSG is rejected. Consequently, the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body's decision of April 25 is confirmed,"" UEFA said. The world's most expensive footballer was ruled out of the match with an injury. He watched from the stands as United were awarded a penalty deep into injury time after a protracted VAR decision, which Marcus Rashford scored to knock the French side out in the last 16 of the Champions League. The 27-year-old aimed an Intagram rant laced with expletives at the match officials. ""It's a disgrace. They get four guys who don't understand football to watch a slow motion replay in front of the TV,"" wrote Neymar. The striker had been having a poor season by his own exalted standards after being booed and mocked for diving at the World Cup, where Brazil were dumped out in the quarters by Belgium. He failed to make the Top 10 in the Ballon d'Or race and then injured his right metatarsal just 13 months after a previous lengthy layoff. He then lost the Brazil captaincy and is facing accusations that he raped a Brazilian woman in Paris. He vehemently denies the accusations. Neymar then injured his ankle in a friendly match, ruling him out of the Copa America on home soil. Paris Saint-Germain have indicated they would be prepared to offload the brilliant but troublesome winger who cost them a world-transfer 222-million-euro fee two years ago."

On Monday, sports daily L'Equipe reported that PSG ""would not stand in the way of him departing"" and added that Neymar ""also sees his future away from Paris"". Agent Pini Zahavi, involved in the deal that brought the Brazilian to the French capital from Barcelona, is said to be actively trying to do a deal to take the player back to Spain. Neymar's two years at the Parc des Princes have been marred by injury and contoversy and he is currently again sidelined by an ankle problem while also dealing with rape allegations. PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi appeared to target Neymar when he indicated that the club's highly-paid stars would have to shape-up or ship-out in an interview with France Football magazine. ""They are not here to please themselves and if they do not agree, the doors are open. I do not want to have celebrity behaviour anymore,"" he said. Perhaps Al-Khelaifi was also talking about Kylian Mbappe, PSG's other superstar forward who last month dropped a bombshell when he hinted he might be open to a new challenge elsewhere as he picked up the Ligue 1 player of the year award. Real Madrid fans even chanted Mbappe's name at the unveiling of Eden Hazard last week, following the Belgian's 100 million-euro move from Chelsea. But with Real already having splashed around 300 million euros ($336 million) in the market, can they really afford a move for Neymar or Mbappe too? Meanwhile, coach Zinedine Zidane is believed to be most keen on completing a move for his compatriot Pogba. Ideally, United want to keep one of their few world class talents, even if Pogba's performances have often fallen well short of expectations since his then world record £89 million ($112 million) signing three years ago. However, the Red Devils must now decide whether it is worth the risk to keep the Frenchman against his will or cash in to fund a rebuild. United cannot offer Pogba Champions League football next season, and much is likely to depend on what offers come their way. Madrid and Juventus have been linked, but neither are likely to come close to the reported £150 million asking price. Potential suitors may also be warned off by the cost of dealing with Pogba's agent, Mino Raiola. Pogba's statement to reporters of his intention to seek pastures new on a promotional tour in Tokyo on Sunday came just days after Raiola saw a three-month ban from brokering deals lifted by FIFA. Raiola creamed off a reported £41 million from the deal that brought Pogba back to Manchester in 2016. With a season of Europa League football on the horizon and a huge rebuild needed at Old Trafford just to compete with Premier League champions Manchester City and Champions League winners Liverpool, Pogba clearly believes he can do better elsewhere. ""United should not be in a position where any player, let alone an underperforming one, feels that he can call the shots. That, though, is where the past six years appear to have left them,"" wrote The Times. After also being burned in big money deals for Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku, United seem keen to avoid getting in an arms race to replace Pogba should he go, even if the opportunity presents itself in what is expected to be a frantic summer of transfer activity. Antoine Griezmann has announced his intention to leave Atletico Madrid but already seems set for Barcelona. United have also played down interest in bringing Gareth Bale back to the Premier League from Madrid and seem set to be outbid by PSG to land another Raiola client in Ajax captain Matthijs de Ligt. Solskjaer has instead prioritised young and hungry recruits for United, and Welsh winger Daniel James, 21, has already been snapped up from Swansea City. kca-as/cw <org>AFC AJAX</org> <org>JUVENTUS FOOTBALL CLUB</org> <org>MANCHESTER UNITED</org>"

PSG, trying to balance the books to avoid Financial Fair-Play sanctions from UEFA, were paid a reported fee of 15 million euros ($16.82 million) for the French youth international. ""I'm very curious about Germany, the special kind of football there, the great stadiums, and of course it's also great to be playing with Bayer04 in the Champions League,"" said Diaby.

267,13/06/2019,19:18,Brazilian police file defamation complaint against Neymar's rape accuser,"Brazilian police said on Thursday they had filed a defamation suit against the woman who has accused football star Neymar of rape, after she insinuated the force was corrupt.","During an interview with television channel SBT, Najila Trindade said: ""The police are bought, aren't they? Or am I crazy?"" The police filed a complaint, issuing a statement on Thursday defending its ""absolute transparency, neutrality and impartiality"". On Tuesday, Trindade had seen a third lawyer drop her case as Danilo Garcia de Andrade said he was no longer representing her. The lawyer wanted to see the content of a seven-minute video filmed during the model's second meeting with the Paris Saint-Germain star. Trindade maintains the recording -- a few seconds of which have been leaked on social media -- includes conclusive evidence that she was assaulted. The accusation against Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar has grabbed headlines in Brazil, which is currently hosting the Copa America, a tournament the 26-year-old is missing due to an ankle injury. Trindade filed the complaint against Neymar on May 31, saying he assaulted her after inviting her to visit him in Paris."
268,11/06/2019,18:43,Messi is sports world's highest earner: Forbes,"Lionel Messi was the world's highest paid athlete over the past year, Forbes reported on Tuesday in its annual sporting rich list.","Barcelona and Argentina star Messi dethroned retired boxer Floyd Mayweather as the sports world's highest earner, raking in $127 million via salary and endorsement deals. That put Messi ahead of long-time rival Cristiano Ronaldo, the Juventus and Portugal star who was second with earnings of $109 million. Brazil and Paris Saint-Germain striker Neymar completed a sweep of the top three positions by footballers, coming in third with earnings of $105 million. The fourth highest earner on the list was Mexico's middleweight boxing star Saul ""Canelo"" Alvarez with $94 million. Alvarez, who defeated Gennady Golovkin last September to become the unified middleweight champion, inked the richest deal in boxing history last October, signing a five-year 11-fight contract with streaming network DAZN worth $365 million. Evergreen tennis star Roger Federer was fifth on the list with total earnings of $93.4 million. The bulk of Federer's earnings came through lucrative endorsement deals, with the 20-time Grand Slam singles champion pocketing $86 million. Stars from the NFL and NBA rounded out the top 10 on the list, with Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson sixth on $89.5 million, just ahead of Green Bay Packers signal-caller Aaron Rodgers ($89.3 million). Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James was the highest earning NBA player, with $89 million, while Golden State's Stephen Curry was ninth with $79.8 million. Curry's Golden State team-mate Kevin Durant was 10th on the rankings with $65.4 million. Former world number one Tiger Woods was 11th on the list with $69.3 million, which included an estimated $54 million in endorsements.

269,11/06/2019,13:12,Tottenham target Draxler sees future at PSG,Germany midfielder Julian Draxler has played down rumours linking him to Tottenham Hotspur and said he wants to stay at Paris Saint-Germain.,"""I feel very happy here, I am playing for a great coach at a great club,"" Draxler, 25, told Kicker magazine on Tuesday. Draxler, who earned his 50th cap in Germany's 2-0 win over Belarus last Saturday, has been in and out of the PSG first eleven since joining the club in 2017. He has recently been linked with Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen and Tottenham Hotspur, but the midfielder told Kicker that he was keen to extend his contract in Paris, which runs until 2021. ""PSG is a crazy club in a positive way, things can happen from one day to the next, but I don't think anybody is looking to kick me out here,"" he said. ""I will prepare for next season just like the last, and if I am offered a new contract, I will listen."" Asked directly about rumours of a move to Tottenham or Bayern last Saturday, Draxler told Bild newspaper that he had ""no intention"" of leaving PSG. ""I can't say anything about the rumours. I haven't heard anything about it from the club, and I haven't spoken with anyone,"" he said."
270,09/06/2019,01:04,PSG expect Neymar to recover in four weeks,"Neymar is expected to be sidelined for four weeks by the ankle injury that has ruled him out of the Copa America with Brazil, his club Paris Saint-Germain said Saturday.","Two club doctors diagnosed his injury as a ""sprain of the lateral ligament"" in his right ankle, adding he would not require surgery and would instead receive ""conservative treatment"". Neymar was ruled out of the Copa America after hurting himself during the 2-0 win over Qatar in a friendly on Wednesday, capping a nightmare year for the world's most expensive player who faces accusations of rape which he strongly denies. A distraught-looking Neymar covered his face with his hands as he sat on the bench after hobbling from the field in the 20th minute. His place in the Brazil squad will be taken by Chelsea's Willian. The four-week timeline for Neymar's recovery would see him return in time for the start of the new French season, which begins over the weekend of August 10-11."

A distraught-looking Neymar covered his face with his hands as he sat on the bench after hobbling from the field in the 20th minute of Brazil's 2-0 win over Qatar in Brasilia on Wednesday. A large ice pack had been strapped to his lower right leg. ""Neymar Jr. suffered a severe sprain of the outer lateral ligament of his right ankle in Brasilia during a warm-up match for the Copa America,"" PSG said in a statement on Twitter. He will be ""reassessed by the club's medical department within the next 72 hours to define the rehabilitation process and recovery time for the player"". Neymar posted a photo of his swollen ankle on Instagram with a message: ""After the storm comes the calm"". The injury comes just nine days before Brazil's opening Copa America game against Bolivia. It caps a troubled season on and off the field for Neymar, who in the buildup to the match faced accusations that he raped a woman in a Paris hotel in May. Neymar, 27, strongly denies the claims and has published intimate images of his encounter with the woman, Najila Trindade Mendes de Souza, on social media in his defence. Despite the furore he had continued to train with his Brazilian team-mates for the Copa America. Before the injury, Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) president Rogerio Caboclo had insisted Wednesday for the second time this week that Neymar would play in the tournament despite the rape accusations. Caboclo's assurances came after CBF vice president Francisco Noveletto was quoted by Brazilian media as saying he was willing to ""bet"" that Neymar would quit. With Neymar ruled out, the host nation face an uphill battle to win South America's continental championship for the first time since 2007. The injury also leaves a question mark over the future career of a player who cost Qatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain a world record fee of 222 million euros ($248 million) when he moved from Barcelona in 2017. Ankle problems ruled him out of the second half of the just-completed Ligue 1 season in France. When he did finally return to the team, he played as PSG suffered a shock defeat to Rennes in the French Cup final and then lashed out at a supporter in the stands afterwards. In a sign of how significant a figure Neymar remains in Brazilian life, the country's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro offered his public backing for the player ahead of the match and later visited him at the hospital. ""I wish you a good and fast recovery,"" Bolsonaro said on Instagram beneath a photo of him and Neymar. At a news conference Monday, national coach Tite was bombarded with questions about effect of the affair on the squad. Attempting to sidestep the issue, Tite said he would ""not judge"" Neymar, who he said was ""indispensable"" to the team. In the match, two Premier League-based players, Richarlison and Gabriel Jesus, scored Brazil's goals in the first half. On Wednesday, the woman who made the accusations gave an interview on the SBT network saying she had suffered ""aggression together with rape"" at the hands of the player. Najila, who says she works as a model, acknowledged she initially liked Neymar -- full name Neymar da Silva Santos Junior -- and wanted to have sexual relations with him. The player paid for her plane ticket from Brazil and put her up in a Paris hotel. Things changed dramatically at their first encounter, Trindade said. ""He was aggressive, totally different than the boy that I got to know on the messages. ""Since I really wanted to be with him I said, OK, I'm going to try to handle this,"" she said. After some kissing and caressing ""he started to hit me ... then he began to hurt me a lot, and I asked him to stop because it hurt."" According to Najila, Neymar apologized, but then hurt her while they had intercourse. A video circulating on social media showed Trindade hitting Neymar in a hotel room and accusing him of assaulting her the day before. Sponsors are clearly worried. Mastercard has cancelled an advertising campaign starring Neymar that was to be broadcast during the Copa America, Spanish media reported. Nike expressed its ""deep concern"" on Monday. Neymar left Brasilia Thursday morning in his private plane. He flew to Mangaratiba, a coastal city 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian media reported. He has reportedly been summoned to give a statement to police on Friday in Rio for posting his intimate WhatsApp messages with Trindade on social media."
272,05/06/2019,23:24,Buffon looking for 'new challenges' in Italy after PSG exit,"Gianluigi Buffon said Wednesday that he will return to Italy after agreeing to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the month, with the World Cup winner looking for ""new challenges"" in his home country after a year in the French capital.","Ligue 1 champions PSG had announced earlier that both club and player had agreed not to renew the former Italy captain's contract, which expires on June 30, after an underwhelming spell between the PSG sticks. ""Today my adventure outside Italy ends: PSG offered me a contract renewal that I didn't feel it was right to sign given my desire for new experiences and professional challenges,"" the 41-year-old wrote on Instagram. The veteran goalkeeper, who won the World Cup in 2006 and is Italy's most-capped player with 176 appearances, did not say he would retire as a player and did not specify what challenges he was seeking. However late on Wednesday Buffon's agent revealed that he had no intention of retiring and was still figuring out his next move. ""Gigi will not stop playing,"" Silvano Martina told Lazio fan radio station Citta Celeste, adding that Buffon has hometown side Carrarese and Serie A outfits Genoa and Lazio ""close to his heart"". Buffon has for a long time had a friendly relationship with Lazio supporters and has said that he had considered a move to the Rome-based club after he left Juve last year, before eventually choosing PSG. ""My client told me that he wants to take two days out to relax and think about his future with his family,"" Martina said. Buffon joined PSG last summer after ending a trophy-packed 17-year career at Italian giants Juventus and played 25 times in all competitions last season, winning the Ligue 1 title and the curtain raiser Champions Trophy. This season's league title was the 10th of Buffon's career, adding to a bulging trophy cabinet that contains just about every honour in football. However the Champions League has eluded him despite him spending the bulk of his career at Juve, one of Europe's biggest clubs, and it was hoped that he might break his duck with the Qatari-funded Parisians. However despite winning the league at a canter, the past season was a poor one for both Buffon and a team with lofty ambitions on the European stage. They missed out on both domestic cup competitions and most importantly were dumped out of the Champions League by Manchester United in embarrassing style, blowing a 2-0 first-leg lead to go out on away goals following a controversial last-gasp penalty. Buffon made a crucial error that helped United achieve their remarkable comeback, spilling Marcus Rashford's weak shot into the path of Romelu Lukaku to allow the Belgian to score the away side's second and set up a dramatic finish."

274,23/05/2019,12:45,Al-Khelaifi charged in athletics graft probe,"Paris Saint-Germain chief Nasser Al-Khelaifi was on Thursday charged with corruption in connection with the bidding process for this year's world athletics championships in Doha, judicial sources said.","Al-Khelaifi, who is also the boss of Qatari television channel BeIN Sports, has been under investigation since March in a probe of the bidding process for the 2017 and the 2019 world championships. Doha lost out to London to stage the 2017 worlds but beat off opposition to host the 2019 event from Eugene in the United States and Barcelona. Al-Khelaifi was informed by letter of his ""mis en examen"", a French legal term that has no direct equivalent in the American or British legal systems but roughly translates as being charged. The French term does not automatically trigger a trial but means that prosecutors believe there is strong or corroborated evidence of wrongdoing. Al-Khelaifi was unable to attend questioning by investigators scheduled for May 16 as he was in Qatar for the domestic cup final. French prosecutors are looking specifically at two payments of $3.5 million in 2011 by Oryx Qatar Sports Investment, a company run by Nasser's brother Khalid Al-Khelaifi, to a sports marketing firm run by Papa Massata Diack. Diack's father Lamine Diack was president of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) from 1999 to 2015 and a member of the International Olympic Committee. As well as probing the world athletics championships the French investigation is also examining circumstances in which the Olympic Games were awarded to Rio de Janeiro for 2016 and Tokyo for 2020. Prior to the decision to charge him, Al-Khelaifi had been questioned in March as ""person of interest"" in the case revolving around the 2011 payments by Oryx which were made at a time when Doha was seeking to host the 2017 world athletics championship and the 2020 Olympics.] Investigators were seeking to determine whether, in return for the payments, Lamine Diack used his influence to gain votes for Doha among IAAF members and also to obtain a date change for the competitions to avoid the heat of the Qatar summer. The world championships take place at the Khalifa International Stadium between September 27 and October 6. Al-Khelaifi's lawyer Francis Szpiner denied all wrongdoing on the part of his client saying the Oryx payments were fully transparent and the facts of the case ""do not concern him (Al-Khelaifi)."" The head of BeIN Sports ""authorised no payment of any kind in relation to the allegations made,"" he told AFP. ""Nasser Al-Khelaifi was neither a shareholder, nor a director of Oryx en 2011. He did not intervene either directly or indirectly in the candidature of Doha..."" Another BeIN executive, Yousef Al-Obaidly, a PSG board member and close associate of Al-Khelaifi, is also under investigation in France which claims jurisdiction because the IAAF is based in Monaco. Al-Obaidly has also denied all wrongdoing, saying the allegations were ""utterly baseless and unsubstantiated."" Lamine Diack, meanwhile, was charged with corruption in March in relation to the case while an arrest warrant has been issued for his Senegal-based son, also wanted for corruption and money laundering, according to a source close to the probe. French prosecutors this week recommended that Diack and his son stand trial in a separate matter, for allegedly obstructing sanctions against Russia for doping in return for payments when he was IAAF president."
275,20/05/2019,20:02,PSG say Mbappe to stay at club next season,"French champions Paris Saint-Germain on Monday insisted that star striker Kylian Mbappe would stay at the club next season, despite the World Cup-winner hinting that he could leave.","The 20-year-old said on Sunday that he wanted more ""responsibilities, maybe at PSG, maybe elsewhere"" after winning the Ligue 1 player of the season award. But PSG said in a statement on Twitter: ""Strong ties have united PSG and Kylian Mbappe for two years and that story will continue next season. ""It's a highly anticipated moment to also write, together, a big page in the history of our club, in which each major player will have to take his share, all the while working for the squad."" Mbappe's comments on Sunday, with Real Madrid reportedly attempt to lure him to Spain, appeared a calculated move. ""I said what I had to say. When you're on stage you can send messages, I think I got mine across. If I keep talking it would be too much and that's not the message I want to send,"" Mbappe explained. He has been regularly linked with a potential move to Madrid since breaking through with Monaco's 2017 Ligue 1 title-winning team, but instead made the switch to PSG, initially on loan, and then for 180 million euros. But since Zinedine Zidane's return to the Real dugout earlier this year, rumours about Mbappe joining his fellow Frenchman at the Santiago Bernabeu have intensified. French sports daily L'Equipe led with the headline ""trophy for the shock sentence"" following Mbappe's ambiguous remarks, while Spanish media described it as a ""bombshell"" after picking up on the fact it was the first time the striker has hinted he could leave Paris. Under contract with PSG until 2023, Mbappe is said to be in discussions with the club over an extension, but was his message a play to strike an improved deal, which reportedly pays him 20 million euros per season? Former PSG goalkeeper Jerome Alonzo, who played for the club between 2001 and 2008, believes Mbappe is angling for a greater say in the club's planning, after a disappointing season which saw Thomas Tuchel's side again fail in the Champions League. ""I have more of an impression that he's someone important at the club who says, 'Guys, I want to vouch for the project but it needs to move along a little. I want to stay for a long time but give me the means to become European champion. If the project doesn't move beyond that, I'm leaving,'"" Alonzo told AFP. This term, Mbappe has stepped up another gear with Neymar out injured for much of the campaign, but his demand for further authority could place him on a collision course with the Brazilian. ""This request for accountability poses questions because it comes two weeks after the same statements from Neymar. There must not be a spat at PSG between leaders or groups with the Brazilian side of the dressing room and the others,"" warned Alonzo. Mbappe backed up his excellent 2018 World Cup, where he scored four times as France won the trophy, by netting 38 times for PSG this season, although he needs to score five in the last league game of the season against Reims next weekend to snatch the European Golden Shoe from Lionel Messi. ""I tell myself that even if I lose, I lose to Messi, one of the greatest players in history,"" he told AFP. ""To think that maybe I kept up with him until the last game, that's a source of pride too, but it's not over."" Mbappe became only the second teenager in history last year, after Brazil legend Pele, to score in a World Cup final during France's 4-2 triumph over Croatia. His global stardom -- surely eye-catching for the likes of Real -- was shown when he became only the fourth footballer to feature on the cover of Time magazine in October, after Messi, Neymar and Mario Balotelli. An Mbappe exit would be a blow for PSG, although increased transfer funds may not be all bad for the French champions as they look to strengthen their squad ahead of their next bid for a first Champions League title."

Monaco, the 2017 champions, are not mathematically safe but they have a three-point lead over Caen who occupy the relegation play-off spot with a goal difference of seven. Guingamp were already relegated. Dijon joined them in the second division for next season when they lost 4-0 at PSG. French World Cup winner Mbappe, back from a three-match ban for a red card in the French Cup final, scored two of the goals to take his league tally to 32 with one game left. He is the first French player to reach that figure since Herve Revelli scored 31 for Saint-Etienne in the 1966/67 season. Elsewhere, Lille made sure of second place and a spot in the Champions League group stages with a 5-0 rout of Angers. Nicolas Pepe, who will leave the club in the summer, scored twice to take his season tally to 22. Lyon will finish third -- enough for a Champions League preliminary round place -- after a 3-0 win over Nice."
277,16/05/2019,10:46,PSG and United eyeing Lewandowski transfer,"Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski has received offers from both Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United, according to a report in German football magazine Kicker on Thursday.","Kicker reported that Lewandowski, whose current deal at Bayern runs until 2021, was unhappy with the club's plan to extend his contract by a single year, suggesting the player wanted a longer deal. ""At the moment, he has requests from Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain,"" the magazine wrote. The 30-year-old Polish striker has scored 189 goals in 240 games for Bayern since joining in 2014, and has consistently been linked to Europe's biggest clubs. He openly flirted with a move to Real Madrid last summer, before ultimately staying in Munich. In an interview with Kicker in March, Lewandowski said he was open to extending his contract at Bayern. ""We have had early discussions, but it will take some time because at the moment, my focus is on the end of the season,"" he said. ""But yes, I can very much imagine staying longer."""
278,11/05/2019,19:14,Neymar scores on final PSG game before ban,Neymar responded to being handed a three-match ban by scoring as champions Paris Saint-Germain ended their three-game losing streak away from home with a 2-1 Ligue 1 victory at Angers on Saturday.,"Thomas Tuchel's PSG have seen their season fizzle out since a shock Champions League exit at the hands of Manchester United in March, losing the French Cup final and embarking on a run of just one win in seven matches. The return of Neymar from a foot problem has been a plus, with the world's most expensive player finding form ahead of his Copa America campaign with Brazil, which starts next month. The 27-year-old's suspension for lashing out at a fan following PSG's penalty-shootout loss to Rennes in the French Cup final comes into effect on Monday, while he will also miss three Champions League games at the start of next season for criticising the referee after the Man United defeat. But he scored his third goal in four games on his final appearance of the season to give PSG a 20th-minute lead at the Stade Raymond-Kopa, diving to head home Dani Alves' scooped pass. And Neymar turned provider as Angel Di Maria nodded in at the back post just before the hour mark to double the visitors' advantage. But PSG have conceded 18 goals in eight games, failing to keep a clean sheet, after Flavien Tait grabbed a late consolation for midtable Angers, tapping in the rebound after Gianluigi Buffon had saved his penalty. The French giants will now hope to ensure that the underwhelming win does not prove to be Neymar's final match for the club, ahead of the start of the transfer window next month. Later on Saturday, 17th-placed Monaco will look to edge closer to safety as they visit Nimes, before Champions League-chasing Lyon face Marseille on Sunday."
279,04/05/2019,20:25,Cavani fluffs late penalty to compound PSG misery in Nice draw,Paris Saint-Germain's dismal recent run in Ligue 1 continued on Saturday as Edinson Cavani missed a stoppage time penalty for the French champions in a scrappy 1-1 home draw with Nice.,"The Uruguayan shot weakly at Nice goalkeeper Walter Benitez nearly five minutes after Neymar, who scored PSG's leveller from the spot 30 minutes earlier, was judged via VAR to have been brought down by Dante. PSG retained the league title two weeks ago and are 17 points ahead of second-placed Lille but they have now won just one of their last six league games as their season continues to disappoint in the aftermath of their nightmare Champions League defeat to Manchester United in March. They were beaten 3-2 at Montpellier midweek after throwing away a two-goal lead to lose on penalties the French Cup final last weekend, after which star striker Kylian Mbappe was hit with a three-match ban for a rash tackle on Rennes' Damien Da Silva. ""It's a bit of a strange period,"" PSG coach Thomas Tuchel said. ""We won the league very early....we played this game as if it was a friendly. ""We're lacking tension before a match, me included, that's normal. There's nothing to win, no objectives left."" For next season he added: ""It's absolutely vital we find answers next season to improve."" Not even Neymar -- who is awaiting sanctions after hitting a Rennes fan in the aftermath of the cup defeat -- bagging his first league goal since January was enough to rouse the hosts from their slumber. The Brazilian struck from the spot on the hour mark in front of a not-full Parc des Princes to level Ignatius Ganago's stunning volleyed opener just after half-time, but Tuchel's side were lacklustre throughout and couldn't grab the winner. Patrick Vieira's Nice, who are down in seventh and seven points away from the Europa League place, had a much simpler chance to double their lead and pile the pain on PSG 12 minutes later after Ganago's strike, but Alan Saint-Maximin could only watch in horror as his shot from the bar after being served an open goal by the dynamic Youcef Atal. They were duly punished seconds later by Neymar, who coolly strode up to score his spot-kick after Angel Di Maria was hacked down by Patrick Burner. PSG pushed for a winner without creating much, and they were handed a golden opportunity to snatch an undeserved winner when referee Frank Schneider pointed to the spot, booking a distraught Dante in the process. However Cavani, in his first start since February, wasn't up to the task and the hosts had to make do with an underwhelming point."
280,30/04/2019,22:45,Troubled PSG throw away lead again,"Paris Saint-Germain's end-of-season meltdown continued on Tuesday as the Ligue 1 champions twice threw away the lead in a 3-2 defeat at Montpellier, three days after dramatically losing the French Cup final.","Souleymane Camara netted Montpellier's winner five minutes from time after Leandro Paredes was caught in possession on the edge of his own area. Before that, Presnel Kimpembe's own goal had cancelled out an Ambroise Oyongo own goal that had given PSG the lead. Angel Di Maria put the visitors back in front, but Andy Delort made it 2-2 before Camara sealed the points. PSG wrapped up their sixth league title in seven seasons a week ago, but this result means they have won one and lost three of their last five league games. ""We made individual errors, too many of them, and big mistakes,"" lamented coach Thomas Tuchel. ""In these conditions it is difficult to win a match at Montpellier, who are a very strong and aggressive team defensively."" This latest defeat will increase the pressure on Tuchel, whose future has been called into question with his team's domestic slump following their humiliating Champions League exit against Manchester United. PSG threw away a two-goal lead in Saturday's French Cup final before losing on penalties to Rennes. Kylian Mbappe was sent off in that game, while Neymar later apologised after hitting a fan who taunted the Brazilian as he went up to collect his runners-up medal. Neymar started in Montpellier, but Mbappe was absent due to suspension, with several other players also absent. ""The situation is always the same. We only have 15 players because everyone is injured,"" moaned Tuchel. ""This has been the situation since January, February, and it's too long."" When Cameroon defender Oyongo turned in Juan Bernat's low cross early on, it looked like PSG might get back to winning ways. However, Montpellier equalised midway through the first half as Damien Le Tallec's header from a Florent Mollet free-kick was turned into his own net by Kimpembe, who had also scored an own goal in the Cup final. The home side tested Gianluigi Buffon in the PSG goal on several other occasions but it was the visitors who scored again just after the hour mark. A clearance by Montpellier's 41-year-old captain Vitorino Hilton came back off Marquinhos and the ball fell to Di Maria, who cleverly dragged the ball away from the diving Benjamin Lecomte and finished into an empty net. Nevertheless, Montpellier drew level again 10 minutes from the end as Mollet helped on a long throw-out by Lecomte, releasing Delort to run through and beat Buffon. Worse was to come for PSG, though. Buffon rolled the ball out to Paredes on the edge of his own area, but the Argentine dithered and was robbed, allowing substitute Camara to gleefully fire into the net. Despite this victory, Montpellier's chances of qualifying for the Europa League remain slim as they sit five points adrift of fourth-placed Saint-Etienne with four games left."

Numerous cell phones caught the moment that Neymar, the world's most expensive footballer, hit a fan in the face after he had taunted some of the players as they went to receive their medals. The incident came days after Neymar was suspended for three Champions League matches by UEFA for a foul-mouthed tirade at match officials following PSG's shock exit from this season's tournament to Manchester United. Neymar later admitted he had made a mistake hitting the fan, writing on Instagram: ""Did I act badly? Yes. But no one can stay indifferent."" Brazilian sports commentators disagreed. ""As if his endless failures, his lack of education, antipathy and superficiality were not enough, Neymar has now shown himself to be a coward,"" Juca Kfouri wrote in the influential daily Folha of Sao Paulo. ""For all his talent, Neymar will never be equal to Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. If he is happy that way, let him enjoy it."" Another columnist for the same newspaper, Mathias Alencastro, said Neymar had turned into a ""rebellious adolescent."" Neymar ""appears incapable of dealing with criticism, of dealing with frustrations,"" wrote Marcelo Tieppo for the news site Terra. ""It might be comfortable for the Brazilian to continue in this fantasy world, but it would be better if the striker started to live in reality."" The victim of the blow, named only as Edouard, a 28-year-old delivery driver from Nantes, denied he had insulted Neymar. ""I told him that they had been useless,"" Edouard told French sports daily L'Equipe. ""When the players passed, Verratti, Buffon, I mocked them: 'You are worthless. Allez Rennes!'"""

As the players climbed the steps to receive their medals, shaking the hands of those nearby, Neymar, one of the last in line, struck one of the fans in the face. The blow was caught on numerous mobile phones, including that of the victim, Edouard, a 28-year-old delivery driver from Nantes. ""Did I act badly?"" Neymar asked in an Instagram comment. ""Yes. But no one can stay indifferent."" A Brazilian friend of Neymar's, Alex Bernardo, posted on Instagram a transcript of the comments audible on Edouard's video starting with unused reserves goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and defender Layvin Kurzawa. ""Oh, Buffon, dirty Bouffon! Oh, Kurzawa, keep your hand to yourself!"" Then to Marco Verratti: ""Oh, racist!"" and to Neymar: ""Oh, go and learn to play football."" The Brazilian striker reacted by pushing down the phone to hit Edouard in the face. ""Who will defend me from going in defence of my teammates?"" Neymar wrote in a comment on Bernardo's post. PSG quickly responded with a statement that said that a ""friend of a Rennes player had insulted all the players"" to ""create a buzz"" on social media. ""I did not insult him,"" Edouard told French sports daily L'Equipe. ""I told him that they had been useless."" ""When the players passed, Verratti, Buffon, I mocked them: 'You are worthless. Allez Rennes!'"" Edouard said he had contemplated bringing charges against Neymar who left him with ""a cut lip and bloody nose"". The blow continued a bad-tempered end to the evening for PSG. Neymar's strike partner Kylian Mbappe was sent off for a dreadful tackle with two minutes left in extra time. The defeat ended PSG's four-year reign in the French Cup and means that, while they have retained the French league, they have won none of the cups they entered this season, with the most painful their exit at the last 16 stage of the Champions League to Manchester United."
283,28/04/2019,02:43,Mbappe sent off as PSG lose French Cup final to Rennes,"Kylian Mbappe was sent off for a shocking tackle as Paris Saint-Germain were stunned by Rennes in Saturday's French Cup final, losing 6-5 on penalties after a dramatic game finished 2-2 at the end of extra time.","PSG substitute Christopher Nkunku blazed his sudden-death spot-kick over the bar in the shootout, sparking scenes of joy among the Rennes fans at the Stade de France as they won a first trophy in almost half a century. ""It has been talked about enough at the club in the last few weeks for us to realise that we have achieved something historic,"" said Rennes coach Julien Stephan. It was a remarkable comeback from the Brittany side, who had seen Dani Alves and the returning Neymar give Ligue 1 champions PSG a 2-0 lead midway through the first half. Thomas Tuchel's side appeared poised to wrap up a domestic double, but Presnel Kimpembe's own goal gave Rennes hope and Edson Mexer headed them level in the 66th minute to take a gripping final -- attended by President Emmanuel Macron -- to extra time. Penalties were already looming when Mbappe, who endured a frustrating evening, was shown a straight red card in the 118th minute for a dreadful challenge on Damien Da Silva. The France star caught the Rennes defender on the knee with his studs, and can expect a lengthy ban. ""He had a slight muscle injury yesterday, he stopped training early and went to hospital for tests. Maybe that was in his head,"" said Tuchel. ""You got the feeling he was lacking confidence and didn't feel free. The red card at the end, it's not him."" Without him, PSG fell short of securing the double in Tuchel's first season in charge, which will also be remembered for the Qatar-owned club's Champions League exit to Manchester United in the last 16. ""I am sad,"" said Neymar. ""We weren't quite up to it, but there is no point crying about it now. There is nothing we can do."" They had been looking to win the Cup for the fifth year running, but instead it is traditional underachievers Rennes -- owned by luxury goods mogul Francois Pinault, one of France's richest men -- who celebrate a famous victory. It is their first silverware since the 1971 French Cup and also means a return to the Europa League next season. ""We can stop talking about being losers. This title will change the history of the club,"" added Stephan. Few of their fans would have imagined it possible after the way they started, with PSG looking more like their former selves as Neymar made his first start in three months after injury. Rennes had been knocked out of this competition following heavy defeats by PSG in each of the last two seasons, and another hiding looked on the cards as they went 2-0 down. The opener came in the 13th minute when a corner fell to Alves just outside the area and he met the ball with a volley that flew low into the corner. The second goal came midway through the first half, as a stray Hatem Ben Arfa pass was intercepted by Alves before Angel Di Maria sent Neymar through to score with a delightful chip over Tomas Koubek, who had come off his line. It was a 21st goal of the season for the world's most expensive player. Rennes roused themselves to finish the half strongly, however, and Mbaye Niang struck a post before they reduced the arrears five minutes from the interval. Hamari Traore crossed from the right and Kimpembe sliced the ball into his own net. They continued to cause problems to PSG in the second half, and it was no surprise when Rennes equalised as Clement Grenier's corner was headed home by Mexer, the Mozambican defender. Into extra time they went, and Neymar set up Mbappe for a shot against the post, but proof that Rennes had done more than just ruffle PSG's feathers came when France's golden boy was sent off. It was not his or PSG's night, for once."
284,26/04/2019,02:20,Neymar headlines returning cast,Paris Saint-Germain's pursuit of a fifth successive French Cup title will be bolstered by the return of Neymar and Edinson Cavani from long-term injuries for Saturday's showdown with Rennes at the Stade de France.,"Brazil star Neymar made his first appearance since January 23 as a second-half substitute in Sunday's 3-1 win over Monaco as PSG celebrated clinching a sixth Ligue 1 crown in seven years. Cavani also returned to action, coming on for the final 17 minutes, as PSG's famed front three -- which has accounted for 78 goals this season -- were reunited after months apart. Coach Thomas Tuchel admitted he ""worried"" for PSG's prospects after they blew a third chance to wrap up the league at Nantes last week, but the German struck a more positive note after watching his team belatedly seal the title. ""Our objective is clear: to win the double. We have to win on Saturday,"" said Tuchel, who is also set to welcome back Angel Di Maria after six weeks out. ""The French Cup is very important to us, and we hope to clinch it and leave nothing for the others,"" added goalkeeper Alphonse Areola, his thoughts echoed by defender Marquinhos. ""A title is always about honour and pride. We all know what our goal for the season is, and that's to win a maximum number of titles for the club,"" said the Brazilian. Anything less than a domestic double for PSG, attempting to lift the French Cup for a record 13th time, would cast further gloom over the Qatari-backed club after their latest European failure. But Gianluigi Buffon expects Rennes, who enjoyed their best ever run on the continent this year by reaching the Europa League last 16, to present a tricky test. PSG beat Rennes 3-1 at Roazhon Park and won 4-1 at the Parc des Princes, but Rennes will look for the ultimate revenge as they chase a first French Cup in 48 years. ""The fact that it's a one-off match, a final, brings the two sides closer together, the gap isn't as wide as it can be over 38 matches,"" Buffon told PSG TV. ""In the league our chances might have been 80-20, in the final it's more like 60-40 or 65-35, because it's a final where anything can happen."" Rennes won the trophy in 1965 and 1971, but the Brittany club have painful memories of their past two finals -- finishing as runners-up to neighbours Guingamp in both 2009 and 2014. ""We have a bit more experience now than we did during our first games in Europe but it's still a totally different game,"" said Rennes captain Benjamin Andre. ""Lifting the trophy at the Stade de France would be great. We know the expectations at Rennes. We'll obviously give it our all like we do in each match."""

The iconic Paris cathedral was damaged in a spectacular blaze last Monday."
286,22/04/2019,12:43,"Mbappe's title, but PSG need to breathe new life into Qatari project","After being the star of France's 2018 World Cup triumph, Kylian Mbappe has been the standout player for Paris Saint-Germain in a Ligue 1 title-winning campaign that has been slightly marred by the manner in which they limped over the line.","PSG finally wrapped up the title on Sunday after second-placed Lille failed to beat Toulouse, having not won any of their previous three games when the opportunity to confirm a sixth French crown in seven seasons was there. The Qatari-owned club can still make it a domestic double, with the French Cup final to come against Rennes next weekend, yet this will not be remembered as a vintage year. While Neymar once again went missing due to injury at the crucial point, Edinson Cavani has struggled with fitness too, and coach Thomas Tuchel has regularly lashed out at the lack of depth in his squad. The 5-1 capitulation at Lille a week ago was the worst league result for PSG since Qatar Sports Investments bought the club in 2011, and the first time they had let in five in a league game since 2000. A record-breaking 14-match winning run with which they started the season now seems like a long time ago, the latest Champions League failure clouding Tuchel's first campaign in charge. Mbappe, at least, has been a constant, revelling in his status as a World Cup winner and hardly ever being rested. He only turned 20 in December, but has now won three Ligue 1 titles in a row. Mbappe has 36 goals in 40 games this season, with 30 in the league. And, frighteningly, his team-mate Daniel Alves told RMC recently that ""he doesn't realise how good he is, he can go much further"". He is also not used to losing, and may have upset some of his teammates with his assessment of last week's defeat at Lille. ""We played like beginners,"" he said. To be fair, they have usually been exceptional domestically. However, the problem is that as long as they keep failing in the Champions League, domestic success for a club backed by a Gulf state will continue to ring hollow. The title has effectively been in the bag for some time, but their season has been winding down ever since their exit against Manchester United in the last 16. That, combined with being knocked out in the League Cup quarter-finals, means Tuchel in his first season has actually done worse than Unai Emery, his unloved predecessor. However, according to sports daily L'Equipe, Tuchel has agreed to extend his contract to 2021. Thoughts have already turned to the future, with new signings needed at the Parc des Princes. The costly Neymar experiment cannot be said to have succeeded until he stays fit for the games that matter, and there will always be speculation about his future. ""We have a contract, we're not even halfway through that contract,"" Neymar's father pointed out to RMC Sport. Mbappe is the one man they really cannot afford to lose, but is it time for a clear-out elsewhere? Some of the excitement of the early part of the decade has gone, replaced with a staleness. The days of Thiago Silva, Edinson Cavani and Marco Verratti are maybe ending. Youri Djorkaeff, a World Cup winner for France and a PSG star in the 1990s, offers a frank assessment, suggesting real change is needed higher up. ""If you're not great in every compartment, from the bus driver to the girls who clean the shirts, you will go nowhere,"" he told Ligue 1 Podcast, 'Le Beau Jeu'. ""Paris Saint-Germain, after many years without success, have to rebuild everything, restart from scratch, because the foundations are not good. You cannot expect to one day win the Champions League without these foundations."" The Qatar project needs a breath of fresh air, and all eyes will be on president Nasser al-Khelaifi and sporting director Antero Henrique. UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules remain a problem, though, with PSG said to have a hole of around 100 million euros and the need to present a balanced budget by the end of June. The next few months will be interesting."

After PSG took a 2-0 first-half lead with a pair of goals by former Monaco player Kylian Mbappe, Neymar came on for the start of the second half replacing French midfielder Layvin Kurzawa. PSG had started their three previous league games needing a victory to seal their sixth French title in seven years, but had drawn once and lost twice. On Sunday afternoon Lille ended their challenge with a goalless draw at Toulouse. That left them 16 points behind PSG with only five games to play. PSG are hoping Neymar could start the April 27 French Cup final against Rennes. The Parisians have struggled with key injuries in recent weeks. Fellow striker Edinson Cavani is still out, while winger Angel di Maria was only on the PSG bench on Sunday. PSG took the field wearing a shirt with a large image of Notre Dame replacing the usual sponsor's logo. ""Notre-Dame"" replaced the player names on the back of the shirts. The iconic Paris cathedral was damaged in a spectacular blaze last Monday. The club said that they would put a limited edition of the shirts on sale on line during the match for 100 euros each. The club said the money ""will be donated to associations related to firefighters"". The club also posted a ""Hommage to Notre Dame"" video on their web site in which players praised the team-work of the Paris fire brigade and made a gesture that imitates the two famous towers that form part of the cathedral's facade. The club said it was also using Sunday's game to thank the firefighters."
288,21/04/2019,18:28,PSG win sixth French title in seven years,Paris Saint-Germain won the French Ligue 1 title for a sixth time in seven seasons on Sunday after second-placed Lille could only draw 0-0 at Toulouse.,"Qatar-backed PSG are now 16 points ahead of Lille who have five games to play after a season which saw them only lose on three occasions in another dominant league campaign. Christophe Galtier's Lille, three-time French champions themselves, stumbled to a stalemate at lowly Toulouse but had Thiago Mendes' second-half effort chalked off by VAR for handball. ""I have regrets over the ruled out goal because I don't think it was intentional,"" Galtier said. ""PSG deserve the title and it's not a surprise to anyone. The suspense didn't last."" PSG now have eight French championships since their maiden victory in 1986 although they squandered three earlier chances to secure this season's title by failing to beat Strasbourg and being beat by second-placed Lille and Nantes in the space of 10 days. However, in a disappointing European run, Thomas Tuchel's men failed to reach the later stages of the Champions League losing to Manchester United in the last 16. Tuchel, in his first year as boss, has complained about not having enough players as the world's most expensive footballer Neymar, fellow striker Edinson Cavani, winger Angel di Maria and defender Marquinhos have missed large parts of the season through injury. The German has had to call on youngsters Colin Dagba, Moussa Diaby and Christopher Nkunku to fill gaps but World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe has proved his 180 million-euro ($202 million) price tag with 27 goals in 26 league appearances. The Parisians host Monaco, the only other outfit to lift the trophy since 2013, later on Sunday with Neymar set to return from a foot problem which has kept him sidelined since January."

Thomas Tuchel's team could have become champions in record-equalling time had they beaten Strasbourg on April 7, but Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's unbelievable miss from on the goal line cost them in a 2-2 draw. Last weekend they lost 5-1 at second-placed Lille, the first time they had conceded five in a league game since 2000, and on Wednesday, with a seriously weakened side, another chance was passed up in a 3-2 loss at Nantes. Three games, one point and 10 goals conceded. PSG had not suffered back-to-back league defeats since November 2011. Nevertheless, they are still 17 points ahead of Lille, and will be crowned champions before kick-off against Monaco on Sunday should Lille fail to win at Toulouse. Otherwise they will need to beat the 2017 champions to secure the title, just as they did a year ago with a 7-1 win over the same opponents. While Tuchel complains about not having enough players, the good news here is that Angel di Maria and Marquinhos are set to return from injuries, while Juan Bernat and Marco Verratti are available after suspension. Kylian Mbappe will play against his former team after being rested at Nantes, a decision which Tuchel was later forced to defend: ""It is my decision, my management, there is no explanation,"" he said. Meanwhile, sports daily L'Equipe reported on Friday that Edinson Cavani could play some part after spending most of the last two months on the sidelines with a hip injury. In addition, Neymar has stepped up his recovery having been out since late January with a foot injury. The motivation for the Brazilian is a return to the squad for next weekend's French Cup final against Rennes at the Stade de France. Despite all their problems, PSG -- who will wear a special shirt as a tribute to the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris that suffered terrible damage in a fire on Monday -- could therefore secure two trophies in seven days. Monaco, meanwhile, travel to the Parc des Princes still not quite safe from the threat of relegation after a tumultuous campaign, having ended last weekend seven points clear of the bottom three. They took 10 points from the first 12 available after Leonardo Jardim returned to replace the sacked Thierry Henry, but have just one win in six since then. Stevan Jovetic is the only player to score for the principality side in their last three matches, but he suffered ruptured cruciate knee ligaments last weekend and faces a long absence. Cesc Fabregas will also miss this game due to a calf injury. ""Of course there is still danger. If the teams at the bottom put together a run of wins, they could quickly climb the table,"" said Jardim. ""We have picked up more points per game in the second half of the season but we still need to be careful in order to stay up."" Among the weekend's other games in France, Saint-Etienne head to Reims looking to keep the pressure on Lyon in the battle for Champions League qualification."

The loss was PSG's worst domestic defeat since going down 4-0 at Bordeaux in 2009, and the first time they had conceded five goals in the league since another 5-1 defeat at Sedan way back in 2000. However they are still 17 points clear of second-placed Lille and if they win at Nantes on Wednesday they will still win the league with six matches to spare. ""We are going to be champions, but you have to lose in the right way,"" said Kylian Mbappe, who had two goals ruled out for offside. ""We can't lack personality like that, and concede three, four, five goals. Losing happens, but that is not normal."" World Cup winner Mbappe had already had one goal chalked off by the officials when a comical Meunier own goal set Lille on their way after six minutes. But PSG looked set to seal the title when Juan Bernat levelled soon after and Mbappe roofed what looked like his 28th league goal of the season in the 13th minute, only to see that one also rightly disallowed. Silva left the field with a knee injury soon after and after Meunier was pulled off, Bernat was then handed a debatable straight red card in the 36th minute for a tug on Nicolas Pepe despite a VAR check. Attacker Pepe slotted home Lille's second five minutes after the break when he latched onto a superb Jonathan Ikone through ball and after that the floodgates opened. Jonathan Bamba smashed home the third 14 minutes later from another Ikone assist and two fine headers from Gabriel and Jose Fonte in the final 20 minutes completed the rout and put Lille eight points ahead of third-placed Lyon. ""Putting five past PSG doesn't happen to everyone, even if they did only have 10 men, but we played well tonight,"" Pepe told Canal+. ""We've still got six matches left and we need to win at least three or four to be assured of the Champions League next season."" Earlier on Sunday, Saint-Etienne closed in on Champions League football after Mathieu Debuchy scored twice in a 3-0 win over Bordeaux that moves them to within three points of Lyon. Wahbi Khazri opened the scoring from the spot 10 minutes after the break following a VAR check of Sergi Palencia's handball before Debuchy headed home the second from a corner to seal the points 17 minutes before the end. Debuchy then completed the win with a deflected close-range strike in the final minute to put Jean-Louis Gasset's side back ahead of Marseille, who started the day fourth and in the Europa League spot after surviving late VAR penalty drama on Saturday to scrape to a 2-1 win over Nimes. They are two points ahead of Rudi Garcia's side and piling pressure on Lyon, who have lost two on the bounce following Friday's shock 2-1 defeat at Nantes. Lyon go into the final six games in trouble following coach Bruno Genesio's announcement that he would leave the club in the summer after falling out of favour with the fans. Monaco moved to two places and seven points clear of the relegation play-off spot despite only drawing 0-0 with Reims after all four of the teams below them failed to win. Caen lost 1-0 to Angers, Giungamp draw 3-3 at Strasbourg, while Dijon and Amiens drew 0-0 in a match that was interrupted after monkey chants were directed by a home fan towards the away side's captain Prince Gouano."

That left Thomas Tuchel's side knowing that three points at the Parc des Princes would see them retain the title and wrap it up with eight games to spare, matching the speed with which Laurent Blanc's team became champions in 2016. Choupo-Moting gave them an early lead with his third Ligue 1 goal, but later in the first half he somehow succeeded in turning a net-bound Christopher Nkunku shot onto the post while standing on the line. ""I wondered if I was offside and it all happened very fast. I touched the ball, it hit the post and, well, it's a real shame because the ball was going in,"" Choupo-Moting told Canal+.

296,05/04/2019,02:15,Peerless PSG on verge of another French title,Paris Saint-Germain can clinch a sixth Ligue 1 title in seven seasons this weekend and complete the first part of a domestic double after booking their place in the final of the French Cup.,"Thomas Tuchel's team will know ahead of kick-off whether they can round off their title procession with a victory at home to League Cup champions Strasbourg. PSG would claim the championship for the eighth time -- and draw to within two of the record held by Saint-Etienne -- with a win at the Parc des Princes if Lille slip up away to Reims. Yet Tuchel, whose side are on track to shatter their 96-point return from the 2015-16 campaign, denied recent reports he has signed an extension with PSG until 2021. ""I can't confirm, we should wait a bit,"" said the German, who saw his team agonisingly knocked out of the Champions League last 16 by Manchester United last month. Marquinhos became the latest high-profile PSG injury casualty during Wednesday's 3-0 semi-final defeat of Nantes, joining Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Angel Di Maria on the sidelines. ""At Toulouse, we were 14 players, we were missing two on the bench,"" Tuchel bemoaned, having travelled with a reduced 16-man squad for last week's 1-0 win. ""It's not possible to manage the players. Some guys we use too much. It's horrible because we're missing a lot of key players... but the team continues to win every three days. ""It shows our hunger to win, which for me is exceptional,"" he added. After flirting with relegation last season, Lille are looking to cement their Champions League return by holding off Lyon in the fight for second place. Lyon are third, four points back with eight games left, but the focus this week has centred on the future of manager Bruno Genesio, who is out of contract in June. Tuesday's 3-2 loss at home to Rennes in the French Cup prompted club president Jean-Michel Aulas to shelve a two-year extension for Genesio, whose side host bottom side Dijon on Saturday. While Genesio faces a fight to save his job, Aulas ruled out the possibility of Jose Mourinho pitching up in Lyon next season. ""I saw Mourinho in Moscow last summer and we spoke a bit, but not to talk about coming to Lyon, we spoke about recruitment,"" Aulas told French sports daily L'Equipe. ""The special one is not compatible with the club's economy."" Marseille's push for Champions League football appears doomed after they tossed away a two-goal lead in their 2-2 draw against Angers to fall eight points adrift of Lyon. ""The goal was to do better than last season. It would be a failure"" to miss out on the top three, said 19-year-old defender Boubacar Kamara. ""But we have to finish the season well. In terms of points anything can still happen."" Mario Balotelli scored twice against Angers to take his goals tally to seven in nine games for Marseille, but the Italian is a doubt for Friday's trip to Bordeaux due to a muscle strain. Meanwhile, Nice sporting director Gilles Grimandi has insisted Patrick Vieira is going nowhere as the ex-France and Arsenal star approaches the end of his debut season on the Cote d'Azur. Vieira ""will be by our side next season. At Arsenal he was courted by quite a lot of people. As a coach he will be on shortlists and in demand by big clubs,"" said Grimandi, who assumed his new role last month."

""This is a great satisfaction for our collective Red Direct,"" Julien Pontes, of Red Direct, told AFP, praising ""the speed of the reaction of the Paris prosecutor, who decided that the law would apply to Mr. Evra"". Evra used a French homophobic slur while taunting PSG for their shock Champions League defeat by his former club. Evra made the comments in a video posted on social media, saying: ""Paris, you are queers... Here are the real men doing the talking."" The 37-year-old defended himself on social media after the incident, saying that ""he loved everyone"" and was not homophobic. ""The words of Patrice Evra, which contrasted 'queers' with 'real men', show a homophobia commonplace in the world of football,"" Etienne Deshoulieres, a lawyer for the group, said in a statement. ""This is unacceptable from a former France captain. It must be firmly condemned,"" he added. Evra made 81 appearances for his country. edy-arb/nal/cld/pb/jc"
298,01/04/2019,00:00,Unstoppable Mbappe kills off Toulouse resistance,Kylian Mbappe fired Paris Saint-Germain to their eighth straight Ligue 1 win with a stunning goal that earned the champions a 1-0 victory at Toulouse on Sunday and kept them miles clear at the top of the league.,"The 20-year-old World Cup winner crashed home his 27th league goal of the season, his seventh in as many league games, with 16 minutes left as he continues to shine in the absence of the injured duo Neymar and Edinson Cavani. ""We had to wait, be patient and in the end we won with Kylian's speed,"" said PSG skipper Marquinhos. ""It brought a great deal of joy to our fans, I'm sure of that."" PSG now have 80 points, 20 ahead of second placed Lille with a game in hand to boot. Coach Thomas Tuchel said he was delighted that the runaway leaders have not been tempted to take their foot off the gas. ""Many of our players were away in the international break and there was a bit of fatigue in some of them,"" said the German. ""It could have been tempting to relax, especially with the lead we have in the league, but nobody does it and I like that."" Mbappe's goal was the highlight of a dull game which was otherwise lit up by a cheeky PSG fan sneaking onto the pitch to snap a selfie with the striker. The video assistant referee system ruled out Marquinhos' tap-in just before half-time after Mbappe was judged offside, and the runaway league leaders threatened little other than that. However they maintain their huge gap on second-placed Lille, who earlier on Sunday scored three quickfire second-half goals to comeback from 2-0 and snatch a vital win that kept them firm favourites for direct qualification for the Champions League. Nantes had been finding goals hard to come by but went 2-0 up in front of a packed and raucous Stade de la Beaujoire thanks to a penalty from Valentin Eysseric and a near post header from Kalifa Coulibaly that seemed destined to drag them up to mid-table. But three strikes in seven minutes from Rafael Leao, Nicolas Pepe from the spot and Jonathan Bamba's fired Christophe Galtier's gutsy outfit to an impressive turnaround. There was still time for Nantes to be cast a lifeline with a late penalty, but Eysseric however sent his spot-kick flying over the bar. Lille are four ahead of Lyon, who occupy the final Champions League spot but will have to qualify for the group stage via playoff if they finish third, and 12 ahead of Marseille in fourth. Monaco suffered a shock home defeat to Caen, who climbed off the bottom of Ligue 1 thanks to a 1-0 win in which their goalkeeper the Congolese Brice Samba emerged as the star. It was Leonardo Jardim's first defeat since returning to the helm eight games ago when Thierry Henry was fired. ""We're back in a relegation scrap,"" Jardim lamented. ""This is a message to all of us to do better. We are only seven points clear of the drop zone and that's nothing, just three matches."" Patrick Viera meanwhile was a happy man after seeing his Nice said win 1-0 at Dijon, who slipped to bottom with this latest defeat. ""It's great to get an away win, it's been a while. Now we can dream of European qualification,"" said Viera, whose side are seventh, four points away from a spot in the Europa League. A late goal from Martin Terrier saw Lyon win 1-0 at Rennes on Friday while an early brace from Mario Balotelli was cancelled out by two Thomas Mangani penalties on Saturday as Marseille drew 2-2 at home to Angers."

The young man was then wrestled to the floor by security, although Mbappe shook his hand and exchanged a few words with him before he was led away. The incident was one of the few bright spots of a prosaic Ligue 1 game that was locked at 0-0 at half time."

He has some time to make his return. I don't want to tell you a date.""

301,27/03/2019,20:04,PSG outcast Rabiot facing axe,Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Adrien Rabiot met with club officials on Wednesday to hear if his suspension from duty could lead to his sacking by the French champions.,"A decision will be forthcoming in two days' time the club said of the 23-year-old Rabiot, who has been gradually frozen out of PSG since refusing to sign a contract extension. Rabiot was suspended after partying at a Paris nightclub following PSG's Champions League elimination by Manchester United. He was placed on 'mis a pied', a form of suspension in France which often leads to an employee being sacked. PSG sporting director Antero Henrique said the club had been deeply unhappy with the player's attitude. ""I find unacceptable the attitude and lack of professionalism of a player like Adrien Rabiot towards the club, his teammates and the fans,"" Henrique said on RMC Sport, referring to the night out. ""Remember up to June 30, 2019 he is part of our squad."" The 23-year-old French international has not played for PSG since early December since balking at signing a fresh contract with the press saying the player's mother, also his agent, had annoyed the club. He was then forced to train with the reserves but made a legal complaint and won a judgement ordering the club to include him in first-team training. Rabiot, who has made more than 150 top-flight appearances, also rejected a chance to be on standby for France's World Cup-winning squad."

303,23/03/2019,11:25,French judges question PSG president in athletics corruption probe,"The Qatari boss of top French soccer team PSG Nasser Al-Khelaifi has been questioned in France in connection with a corruption probe over the awarding to Doha of the World Athletics championships, a judicial source said Saturday.","The source said Al-Khelaifi was questioned on Wednesday by investigating magistrates who termed him a ""person of interest"" as they examine a case which also looks at the circumstances in which the Olympic Games were awarded to Rio de Janeiro for 2016 and Tokyo for 2020. Al-Khelaifi's lawyer Francis Szpiner did not respond to an AFP request for comment. The magistrates were looking specifically at two payments of $3.5 million in 2011 by Oryx Qatar Sports Investment, a company jointly owned by Al-Khelaifi and his brother Khalid, to a sports marketing firm run by Papa Massata Diack. His father Lamine Diack was formerly president of the IAAF, the world athletics governing body, and a member of the International Olympic Committee. At the time, Qatar was seeking to host the 2017 IAAF world championships and the two payments were made shortly before it voted. The event was awarded to London but, in 2014, Doha was awarded the 2019 IAAF games which start on September 28. These payments were outlined in a memorandum of understanding, in which Oryx undertook to purchase sponsorship and TV rights for $32.6 million, provided Doha obtained the World 2017 championships, according to a source close to the file. Oryx Qatar Sports Investment is distinct from the Qatar sovereign wealth fund, Qatar Sports Investment, which owns PSG. Al-Khelaifi was interrogated by two French judges on Wednesday. The source told AFP that the Qatari businessman denied corruption and said he only learned recently of the two transfers. The judges, who are investigating the sprawling Diack case, placed Al-Khelaifi under the intermediate status of ""assisted witness"", meaning that he is not being examined at this stage but remains a person of interest in the investigation. In Switzerland, Al-Khelaifi, who is also the head of the TV network BeIN sports is in the crosshairs of an investigation into ""private corruption "", concerning the attribution of the broadcasting rights to two football World Cups. Last week, the Court of Arbitration in Sport backed PSG's appeal against the governing body of European football's attempt to reopen an investigation into the club for financial wrongdoing."
304,22/03/2019,17:11,PSG's Neymar charged for rant after Champions League loss,"Neymar was charged by UEFA on Friday for making ""insulting"" comments about the match officials following Paris Saint-Germain's shock Champions League loss to Manchester United.","The Brazil forward missed the 3-1 second-leg defeat in the last 16 earlier this month through injury, but told match officials ""to go fuck yourselves"" on social media after watching on from the sidelines at the Parc des Princes. The 27-year-old was angry with the award of a decisive injury-time penalty which Marcus Rashford scored to send United through. UEFA said he had been charged, with the date of his hearing yet to be confirmed. Neymar could face a ban from the early stages of next season's Champions League. In June, Neymar's teammate Gianluigi Buffon was handed a three-match suspension after a tirade against referee Michael Oliver following his former club Juventus' similarly dramatic quarter-final defeat by Real Madrid last season. ""It's a disgrace. They get four guys who don't understand football to watch a slow motion replay in front of the TV,"" Neymar wrote in Portuguese on Instagram after the game. The Premier League giants were given the spot-kick after Presnel Kimpembe was judged to have handled Diogo Dalot's shot. Neymar was reportedly so enraged by the decision to give the penalty that he had to be restrained by PSG staff to stop him entering their dressing room. PSG made Neymar the world's most expensive player in 2017 by signing him from Barcelona as they stepped up their bid to win a maiden Champions League title, but have now lost in the last 16 in three straight seasons."

Agent Veronique Rabiot, who is also the player's mother, insisted her son had ""done nothing wrong"". ""Adrien is a prisoner, he is even hostage to PSG. Soon it will be dry bread, water and a dungeon,"" she told L'Equipe on Tuesday. Rabiot has been suspended until March 27, after also liking a video on social media of former Man United defender Patrice Evra celebrating PSG's defeat. ""We blame him for going out when we don't want him to play,"" Veronique Rabiot added. ""It's contradictory, it's not possible to lock him up."" Having been frozen out and briefly forced to train with the youth teams, Rabiot has not played for PSG since their final Champions League group-stage match against Red Star Belgrade last December."
306,19/03/2019,17:07,Big win for PSG as UEFA financial probe dropped,Paris Saint-Germain won a major victory Tuesday when the world's top sports court backed the club against European football's governing body UEFA over allegations of financial wrongdoing.,"PSG had appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in October last year after a UEFA panel decided in September to reopen the probe into the club's compliance with Financial Fair Play regulations. UEFA had originally cleared PSG of wrongdoing in June following a probe triggered after PSG splashed out 400 million euros ($454 million) to buy Brazilian superstar Neymar and French phenomenon Kylian Mbappe. ""The appeal filed at the CAS on 3 October 2018 by Paris Saint-Germain against the decision issued on 19 September 2018 by the Adjudicatory Chamber of the UEFA (to reopen the case) is upheld and the challenged decision is set aside,"" CAS said in a statement. It added that the ruling was ""final and binding."" The probe was opened to determine whether PSG respected financial rules imposed by UEFA which broadly limit them to spending no more than they earn. The club said in a statement it ""took note of the favourable decision and intends to go ahead serenely with its development."" PSG argued that the decision to reopen the case violated UEFA's own rules limiting to 10 days the period of review of its original decision to drop the case. UEFA rules ""provided for a 10-day review period during which any review should be instigated and completed and that the challenged decision (to reopen the case) was manifestly late,"" the CAS statement added. UEFA's Financial Control Board ordered the review on June 22 last year and the decision to reopen the case came almost three months later on September 19."
307,17/03/2019,23:10,Di Maria stars as PSG see off rivals Marseille,Angel Di Maria scored twice as Paris Saint-Germain eased to a 3-1 victory over Marseille on Sunday to extend their long unbeaten run against their arch rivals and move 20 points clear at the Ligue 1 summit.,"Kylian Mbappe put PSG in front on the stroke of half-time with his 26th league goal of the season, but Valere Germain equalised in the first minute of the second period. Argentine Di Maria restored the home team's advantage, though, and Marseille 'keeper Steve Mandanda was sent off for a clear handball 30 yards from goal. Di Maria's wonderful free-kick added further gloss to the scoreline, although Mbappe saw a late penalty saved by visiting substitute Yohann Pele. The capital giants are now unbeaten in 19 matches against their rivals, winning 16 meetings and drawing three since losing 3-0 at the Stade Velodrome in November 2011. It was a strong response from Thomas Tuchel's men in their first real test since being dumped out of the Champions League by Manchester United. With the Ligue 1 title effectively secured, the only competition left for PSG to play for this season is the French Cup, in which they face Nantes in the semi-finals next month. Mario Balotelli had the first shot in anger, shrugging off the PSG defence before seeing his long-range drive well held by home goalkeeper Alphonse Areola. There was a scare at the other end for Mandanda, as the French international miscontrolled a simple back-pass only narrowly past his own post. A group of PSG ultras were boycotting the opening stages over the team's shock Champions League defeat. They did not miss much goalmouth action early on, but many rushed to their seats when they thought Di Maria had put the hosts in front, only to see the effort ruled out for offside by VAR. Marseille did well to keep their rivals at arm's length for the opening 45 minutes, although injuries which forced the substitutions of PSG full-backs Thomas Meunier and Dani Alves contributed to the game's scrappy nature. But PSG forged ahead in the second minute of first-half injury time, as they broke at pace from a Marseille corner and Di Maria played in Mbappe to sweep the ball past Mandanda. Rudi Garcia's away side stunned the Parc des Princes just seconds after the restart, though, as Lucas Ocampos raced clear and squared for Germain to slot into the bottom corner. Marseille grew in confidence, but that left space for PSG to exploit, and Di Maria cut inside from the right and curled a fantastic 55th-minute finish past Mandanda to score his fifth goal in six matches. The match was all but ended as a contest just after the hour mark when Mandanda raced from his line and dived to handle yards outside of his area in a moment of madness which left his side a man down. Di Maria ensured PSG did not wait long to take advantage, hammering a swerving strike from the resulting free-kick past Pele, who was brought on for the ineffective Balotelli, and in off the post. Mbappe missed the chance to score a second himself in added time, as his penalty was saved by Pele after the World Cup winner was bundled over by Hiroki Sakai. Earlier on Sunday, Lyon strengthened their grip on a top-three spot with a 3-2 victory over Montpellier. Bruno Genesio's men, who were thrashed 5-1 by Barcelona in the Champions League last 16 in midweek, saw off their fellow European hopefuls with goals from Martin Terrier, Moussa Dembele and Houssem Aouar. Lyon moved six points clear of fourth-placed Marseille in the race for the final Champions League spot."

Despite vast investment from their Qatari owners PSG's loss on away goals to United added to a legacy of choking in the competition, after they went out lamely to Real Madrid last year and collapsed at Barcelona the year before. PSG host their bitter Ligue 1 rivals Marseille on Sunday, the only French club to have won the Champions League (when it was the European Cup), and some fan groups have said they will not cheer their own team. ""If they do that I will be very disappointed,"" said Tuchel. ""I know they are disappointed, but they have no need to keep showing it again and again,"" said the German coach, mainly in reaction to rowdy scenes at a training session last weekend. ""A strike helps nobody,"" he insisted. ""We the team and the staff are the ones left more disappointed than anyone else. ""In a match like this it's crucially important, they can fill us with confidence,"" he said as Marseille come to Paris on a roll of form since Italian striker Mario Balotelli joined in January. ""With him (Balotelli) in the side they will always have a presence in the box and they will be pinging in crosses."" ""They will be targeting our back post and we'll have to be careful,"" he said. League leaders PSG have 74 points and go into the game against fourth placed Marseille, who have 47, with a string of injuries as Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Julian Draxler all sit out perhaps the most prestige match remaining in the French season."

""Remember up to June 30, 2019 he is part of our squad."" Rabiot told Infosport on Thursday that it wasn't him ""who had chosen this situation. It's not a choice that I've made"". He added: ""I'm available, everything's fine, I'm in great shape. If I could play.... but the (club) management have decided otherwise."" Asked by Infosport for his feelings after PSG's latest European failure Rabiot said that it had made him feel ""bad"". ""I'm still a player at the club despite what they can say. I'm still under contract. I'm behind my teammates, of course it was disappointing."" Relations between Rabiot, who has been strongly linked with a move to Barcelona, and PSG have broken down, with the club ordering him to train with the reserves.

311,12/03/2019,21:21,PSG win in first outing since Champions League nightmare,Paris Saint-Germain shook off their Champions League hangover and resumed their canter towards another French title on Tuesday as they cruised to a 4-0 win in Dijon.,"Marquinhos, Kylian Mbappe, Angel Di Maria and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting scored PSG's goals in their first outing since their disastrous exit from the Champions League in the last 16 at the hands of Manchester United last week. The result left Thomas Tuchel's team 17 points clear of Lille in second place, and they still have a game in hand. With a French Cup semi-final to come early next month, a double remains a possibility, but any celebrations here were low key for a club whose priority has long been Europe. The PSG squad had been given three days off in the wake of their 3-1 home reverse against United, which eliminated them from the Champions League on away goals, the third season running in which they have gone out of the competition in the last 16. Their return to training on Sunday had been marked by tensions between players and unhappy supporters hurling abuse, and it remains to be seen what kind of welcome they receive when they play host to Marseille at the Parc des Princes this weekend. In the meantime, a Dijon side battling to avoid relegation were the ideal opponents, with PSG going ahead inside seven minutes when Marquinhos headed home from a Di Maria corner. The PSG line-up featured just four changes from last Wednesday's Champions League game, with Gianluigi Buffon and Thilo Kehrer dropping out along with the banned Dani Alves and injured Julian Draxler. Mbappe got the second goal shortly before half-time, bundling in a Layvin Kurzawa centre from close range for his 25th league goal of the campaign. The World Cup-winning striker later hit the woodwork, but that was after Di Maria had curled in a free-kick five minutes into the second half. Choupo-Moting came off the bench to wrap up the win in stoppage time from a Thomas Meunier cross, as he got his first goal since his debut for the club in September."
312,11/03/2019,15:01,Tuchel committed to future at PSG after Champions League 'accident',Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel says he has no intention of leaving the French club in the wake of their exit from the Champions League at the hands of Manchester United.,"""I have a contract and I want to stay here a long time, grow and have success with the club, that is my goal, that's absolutely clear,"" said the German on Monday when asked how he sees his future. Tuchel was appointed last year on a two-year deal to succeed Unai Emery. He had been widely praised for his work at the Parc des Princes, but another elimination from the Champions League in the first knockout round has raised questions. PSG had been desperate to make progress in Europe after being knocked out of the Champions League last 16 in back-to-back seasons under Emery. They looked on course to reach the quarter-finals after a 2-0 win away to United in the first leg last month, but a 3-1 home loss at the Parc des Princes last week knocked them out on away goals. The nature of their defeat, especially coming two years after their capitulation against Barcelona at the same stage, has seen PSG widely labelled as bottlers, incapable of dealing with the tension on the big stage. However, Tuchel insists that the United game was ""an accident"", with the tie decided by Marcus Rashford's penalty, which was awarded for a handball following a controversial VAR review. ""It is difficult to analyse Wednesday because in my opinion it was an accident,"" said Tuchel. ""Lots of people might say, 'yes, but there have been lots of accidents at the same moment going back several years', but for me and this team it was an accident, there is no explanation, we controlled the game. ""We wanted to show that things are different this season, it was the moment to grow, to leave the doubts behind, but we were not capable of taking that step."" PSG returned to training on Sunday after three days off in the wake of the United game. They were greeted with abuse from supporters who had been invited into the session at the club's stadium. Reports said that attempts by players, including captain Thiago Silva, to calm the 'Ultras' were ignored, with more verbal abuse the response. ""They were hurt, sad, angry. Everyone can understand that but you can't be more sad or hurt than us. It's not possible,"" Tuchel insisted. After not playing at the weekend, PSG return to action on Tuesday in a rearranged league fixture at struggling Dijon. They go into that game without Edinson Cavani, who is not fit, while Julian Draxler is injured, Dani Alves is suspended and January signing Leandro Paredes is not eligible. With PSG 14 points clear of second-placed Lille, and with two games in hand, the Ligue 1 title is surely in the bag, and Tuchel's biggest challenge now will be motivating his players to keep going until the end of the campaign. Tuesday's game is followed by a home fixture against old rivals Marseille on Sunday. ""Lots of guys here want the season to end and to have a holiday but that is not an option. ""It is part of the essence of sport that you have to swallow things that are hard to swallow, and get on with it."""
313,11/03/2019,13:45,Spanish tax authorities investigating Neymar: report,"Spain's tax authorities are investigating the bonus Neymar earned when he extended his contract with Barcelona as well as his world-record transfer to Paris Saint-Germain, daily newspaper El Mundo reported Monday.","The authorities are looking into whether the Brazilian paid tax in Spain related to the two deals, the newspaper said. Contacted by AFP, the tax office refused to comment on the report. Neymar was a tax resident in Spain in 2017, the year he transferred from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain on a five-year deal for a world record 222 million euros ($249 million). The 27-year-old Brazilian international and Barcelona are already battling in court over a bonus the player was paid when in 2016 he signed a new five-year deal with the Catalan giants just nine months before joining PSG. A hearing over that case is scheduled for March 21 at a Barcelona labour court. The tax authorities have asked the labour court for all the information it has regarding this case, El Mundo said. The court declined to comment. After Neymar agreed to move to the French side, Barcelona refused to pay the player 26 million euros which were part of a bonus it promised him when he extended his contract with them. Barcelona are suing Neymar for 8.5 million euros for breach of contract and to demand he return the amount of the bonus money which it did pay him. Neymar, in turn, is suing Barcelona to demand his former club pay his entire renewal bonus. His is just one of several famous footballers who have fallen foul of Spain's tax authorities in recent years. A Spanish court in January handed Portuguese striker Cristiano Ronaldo a suspended two-year prison sentence for committing tax fraud when he was at Real Madrid. The player, who joined Italian side Juventus last year, also agreed to pay 18.8 million euros in fines and back taxes to settle the case, according to judicial sources. Barcelona's Lionel Messi, once Ronaldo's big La Liga rival, paid a two-million-euro fine in 2016 in his own tax wrangle and received a 21-month jail term. The prison sentence was later reduced to a further fine of 252,000 euros, equivalent to 400 euros per day of the original term."

The 500 or so PSG 'Ultras' allowed into the ground on Sunday then screamed ""Bunch of bastards"" and ""Show us your balls"" towards the players on the field, according to videos posted on social media. Captain Thiago Silva and defender Marquinhos attempted to calm the crowd by pleading on the public address system but their pleas were drowned out by further verbal abuse, newspaper Le Parisian reported. The taunting, as well as the noise of firecrackers and smoke bombs, echoed around the stadium and could be heard outside the ground. PSG's game at Nantes this weekend was postponed although they remain well clear of second-placed Lille and all but assured a sixth Ligue 1 title in seven seasons. Earlier in the day PSG's star striker Kylian Mbappe said he was left ""stunned"" by PSG's gut-wrenching midweek exit. Marcus Rashford's 94th-minute penalty gave the Red Devils a 3-1 win to send the English club through on away goals after becoming the first team in the competition's history to overturn a 2-0 home defeat.

We didn't want to ruin it but in the end we did.""

According to the Sky Sports television channel, the 44-year-old United fan was travelling in a taxi with friends to the centre of Paris after the game which the English side won 3-1 when the driver objected to their boisterous celebrations.

""The victim tried to intervene to protect her, but the driver then turned the knife on him, stabbing him in the chest with what's been described as 'a large blade'.""

319,09/03/2019,02:07,Champions League chase leaves Man Utd little time to bask in PSG glory,"After the miracle of Paris, Manchester United have no time for a hangover when they travel to Arsenal on Sunday if their chances of even qualifying for next season's Champions League are not to suffer significant damage.","Should United repeat their 3-1 success at the Emirates in the FA Cup six weeks ago, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will rack up a perfect 10 away wins since taking caretaker charge to make a seemingly irrefutable case to be handed the job on a permanent basis. The highlight was beating free-spending Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 in dramatic circumstances on Wednesday to progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League on away goals and erase the consequences of Solskjaer's only defeat in 17 games in charge. United have made up an 11-point gap to the Premier League top four under the Norwegian, but their Champions League status for next season is still far from assured. The Red Devils lead Arsenal by just a solitary point and a two-point advantage over sixth-placed Chelsea could be wiped out by the Blues' game in hand at home to Brighton. Momentum is on United's side, but they face a far tougher run-in than the Gunners with title chasing Manchester City and Chelsea still to visit Old Trafford. By contrast, the visit of Solskjaer's men is Arsenal's last against top six opposition. ""I don't think it is definitive, but we need to show and push on Sunday to take more possibility to finish in the top four,"" said Arsenal boss Unai Emery. The Spaniard also has reason to be positive. Arsenal have not been beaten at the Emirates in the Premier League since City's visit on the opening day of the season and have won their last eight home league games. ""We played against a big team and at some moments showed we can fight and battle with them, but we lost and that is the reality,"" added Emery on the FA Cup tie between the pair. ""We need fresh players, players with energy, we need quality, we need good combinations, and we need the players who start on the bench after they can help us on the pitch and deliver a big performance as well."" That suggests Emery could make major changes from the side that lost 3-1 to Rennes in the Europa League on Thursday. Alexandre Lacazette looks set to return up front after he was suspended for the trip to France in midweek, meaning Arsenal's top-scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang faces being benched once more. Aubameyang missed a late penalty that would have vrought victory over Tottenham in the north London derby last weekend after coming on as a substitute and Emery has defended his tendency to start just one of his two star strikers. ""They need to accept the decision. I am finding the best decisions for the team,"" said the former PSG coach. ""Sometimes I am not happy with them both when their performances are not good when they're both playing, but I am very consistent in our work to take the best decision and to give them the best performance for us, whether they're playing together or alone."" Solskjaer, by contrast, is positive Romelu Lukaku and Marcus Rashford can strike up a fruitful partnership after both scored in the French capital in midweek. Rashford started Solskjaer's reign as the preferred option up front, but Lukaku has forced his way back into the side, scoring twice in each of his last three matches. ""Of course we played with two up front, with him (Lukaku) and Rashy against PSG,"" said Solskjaer. ""They might form a very nice partnership together, because I wouldn't like to be a defender having them two running at me!"" Solskjaer also has more options on Sunday after 10 first-team players missed Wednesday. Paul Pogba is back from suspension, while Anthony Martial, Nemanja Matic and Ander Herrera could be fit to return from injury."
320,08/03/2019,16:50,"Lyon, Rennes carrying French hopes in Europe after PSG exit","Paris Saint-Germain's repeated Champions League failures may reflect badly on French football, but Lyon and Rennes are still both in contention to qualify for European quarter-finals.","PSG are licking their wounds and reflecting on where they go from here after their humiliating exit at the hands of Manchester United in the last 16, one that has damaged the reputation of Ligue 1 abroad. ""The elimination of Paris is not good for our standing in Europe, nor for our image,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim, who took his team to the Champions League semi-finals in 2017. Jardim expressed hope that Lyon can do better when they face Barcelona away in their last 16, second leg next Wednesday. A 0-0 draw at home in the first leg means Bruno Genesio's side head to the Camp Nou for the return still in with a chance, even if they are by no means the favourites. For one thing, they have World Cup-winning captain Nabil Fekir back available after suspension kept him out of the first leg. In addition, Memphis Depay is back among the goals, scoring in each of the last two games after previously going three and a half months without finding the net. Lyon have already shown in taking four points off Manchester City in the group stage that they can mix it with the best teams on the continent, although Genesio insisted PSG's elimination does not add extra pressure for his side. ""We are competitors and we wanted to qualify regardless of PSG's result, so we will still want to do so. It changes nothing,"" said Genesio on Friday. ""I was very disappointed for their coach, their players and for French football. It just shows that in football everything is possible and you are never safe from anything."" Before going to Barcelona, Lyon face mid-table Strasbourg at the Stade de la Meinau on Saturday looking to stay on track for a top-three finish in Ligue 1. OL are five points behind second-placed Lille and five better off than Marseille in fourth -- only the top two qualify automatically for next season's Champions League. Meanwhile, Rennes can be optimistic about their chances of progressing to the Europa League quarter-finals after beating Arsenal 3-1 on Thursday in their last 16, first leg in Brittany. They head to London for the return next week after coming from behind to beat an Arsenal side who played more than half the game with 10 men, although their coach Julien Stephan sought to take the pressure off his team. ""Despite the victory, for me, Arsenal remain favourites given their past and their experience,"" said Stephan, who was appointed in December. ""The only thing I think is that we will need to score there, at least once, if not twice."" Regardless of what happens in the return, this is already Rennes' best ever European run. To put the result into some context, Arsenal are just one point behind Manchester United in the Premier League, while Rennes are 10th in Ligue 1, 34 points adrift of leaders PSG. Rennes are at home to relegation-threatened Caen on Sunday, but PSG will not play -- their game at Nantes was postponed with authorities concerned about the impact of ongoing ""yellow vest"" protests in France. Thomas Tuchel's team will be back in action next Tuesday away at Dijon. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
321,07/03/2019,11:24,Solskjaer makes Man Utd Champions League comeback kings again,Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's name is inseparable from Manchester United's history of late drama in the Champions League and his latest astonishing feat against Paris Saint-Germain will surely secure him the permanent manager's job at Old Trafford.,"No team in the history of the European Cup had gone through after losing the first leg 2-0 at home. Yet United under Solskjaer are no ordinary team, even when shorn of the talismanic Paul Pogba through suspension and nine other first-team players due to injury. Romelu Lukaku's first-half double laid the foundations for a famous 3-1 win against Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc de Princes on Wednesday as United progressed to the quarter-finals on away goals. But Pogba's absence meant it was left to 21-year-old Marcus Rashford to land the decisive blow from the penalty spot to complete the comeback deep into stoppage time -- 20 years after Solskjaer won the Champions League for United against Bayern Munich in Barcelona. ""There was pressure on the boy but there were no nerves whatsoever. Fearless,"" said Solskjaer of his prodigy. ""With this club, this is what we do. That's just Man United."" In the whirlwind three months since the Norwegian was drafted in after Jose Mourinho's sacking to oversee the Red Devils until the end of the season, it is easy to forget that this is not what Manchester United have done in the six years since Solskjaer's mentor, Alex Ferguson, retired. Inflicting another year of Champions League pain on a star-laden PSG is all the more remarkable as United had won just one knockout game in the competition since 2011. The aggressive, attack-minded, ambitious football that Solskjaer played under Ferguson and has tried to instil in his own side was not on show. Instead, given the circumstances, with so many key players missing, the rookie manager showed an adaptability and tactical acumen that proved he is more than just a cheerleader. ""We had a game plan before the game and every man knew what he was doing,"" said United captain Ashley Young. ""At times we had to give up possession, I think we frustrated them."" United also had fortune on their side. Lukaku pounced on errors by Thilo Kehrer and 41-year-old goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon to twice give his side the lead before half-time and VAR was needed to award the controversial stoppage-time penalty against Presnel Kimpembe for handball. There was, however, a United trait of old as Solskjaer showed his faith in youth. As well as Rashford, another academy graduate, Scott McTominay, 22, starred in midfield, while three teenagers, Diogo Dalot, Tahith Chong and Mason Greenwood, were summoned from the bench in search of the goal to win the tie. It was from Dalot's shot that Kimpembe was adjudged to have handled to give Rashford his moment of glory. ""This was the real Manchester United,"" wrote Henry Winter in The Times. ""Playing with belief, youth, commitment. Playing for one another, playing for the shirt. Making light of absentees, refusing to be overawed by famous opponents. Never, ever giving up. And winning."" Solskjaer's record is now 14 wins from 17 matches in charge with his solitary defeat in the first leg of this tie now long forgotten. Even better could still be to come as United take their place in a wide-open quarter-final draw alongside Tottenham, Porto and Ajax, who ended holders Real Madrid's three-year reign as European champions. ""Of course we fancy ourselves. We can go all the way,"" said a confident Solskjaer, who will have Pogba and Anthony Martial, Jesse Lingard and Nemanja Matic back for the last eight. More importantly, as the visiting fans sang amid wild celebrations at the final whistle ""United are back"" as a contender on the European stage."

Having won 2-0 in the first leg last month, the French side wobbled in the return but were still going through until Slovenian referee Damir Skomina gave a stoppage-time penalty for a Presnel Kimpembe handball in the box, after reviewing the images. A Diogo Dalot shot had struck Kimpembe, and Marcus Rashford duly converted from the spot, as United went through on away goals. ""From my point of view I watched Dalot take the shot. I saw the ball flying straight from his foot and for me it was clear that it was going way over the bar,"" said Tuchel. ""There are many things to discuss before taking the decision and I think it's a 50-50 decision. ""What makes it super hard is that I had the clear feeling that the shot was not on target, and to get rewarded with a penalty, there is no logic."" A Romelu Lukaku brace in the first half had given the visitors hope of an improbable win, but Juan Bernat scored in between to keep PSG on course. Tuchel added: ""You can say that we played on this thin line for 60 minutes knowing that if we don't score, we can blame it."" The German said the manner of the defeat, after they had dominated much of the game, was ""perhaps impossible to analyse"". PSG are the runaway Ligue 1 leaders, but this is the third year running in which they have gone out of the Champions League in the last 16. ""If it were a league game you would wipe your mouth and go on, but today it's horrible and cruel,"" he said. ""It happens once in 100 games. We did not deserve to go out over 180 minutes, but that makes it not easier to deal with."""

Even so, Juan Bernat had netted in between for PSG, and it looked as though the French side would stumble on until the drama at the death. Slovenian referee Damir Skomina awarded a spot-kick after reviewing the images when he had been alerted of a possible handball by PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe in the box. Rashford duly beat Gianluigi Buffon from 12 yards, as United won a European tie after losing the first leg at home for the first time in their history. ""We always believed, that's the thing,"" an elated Solskjaer said. ""The plan was to get the first goal, be in the game with five or 10 minutes to go, and we were."" Their improbable victory -- following Ajax's similarly stunning turnaround against holders Real Madrid 24 hours earlier -- takes them through to the last eight for the first time since 2014. ""Of course we fancy ourselves. We can go all the way, but we just have to wait for the draw and then take the game as it comes,"" said the Norwegian, who has now overseen nine consecutive away wins, a club record. ""We have had loads of injuries and suspensions but that was maybe a good thing today because we had a fresh team, and loads of energy."" While United celebrate, for PSG and their Qatari owners this defeat will feel like groundhog day. For the third year running they fail to make the quarter-finals, after their defeat at the hands of Real Madrid a year ago and their humiliating collapse against Barcelona in 2017. Electric at Old Trafford in the first leg, Kylian Mbappe was poor here and Neymar was again missing, watching from the stands as he recovers from injury. ""If it were a league game you would wipe your mouth and go on, but today it's horrible and cruel,"" said coach Thomas Tuchel. ""It happens once in 100 games. We did not deserve to go out over 180 minutes."" However, the German refused to say the officials had got the late penalty call wrong. ""I think it's a 50-50 decision. What makes it super hard is that I had the clear feeling that the shot was not on target."" United were missing Paul Pogba through suspension and nine more players were sidelined due to fitness problems. Despite that, they achieved one of their greatest European results, up there with their 3-2 win at Juventus in the 1999 semi-finals, which came after they fell two goals behind early on. Solskjaer was on the bench that night, and the Norwegian watched from the sideline here -- curiously with a bib on over his jacket apparently due to a colour clash with PSG's kit -- as his side went in front inside two minutes. A dreadful back-pass attempt by PSG defender Thilo Kehrer fell to Lukaku, who rounded Buffon and scored. The hosts pulled themselves together to equalise in the 12th minute when Mbappe squared for Bernat to turn in his third Champions League goal this season. However, the visitors were gifted another goal half an hour in. Not closed down 25 yards out, Rashford tried a shot that was powerful but straight at Buffon. Yet the veteran Italian spilled the ball, and Lukaku followed in to score his sixth goal in three games. PSG -- so slick in France -- were wobbling again at the business end of the Champions League. Angel Di Maria had a goal ruled out for offside in the 56th minute and Mbappe then managed to fall when clean through late on, with Bernat sending the loose ball against the post. It still looked as though they would hang on, but then VAR intervened, and Rashford sent United into ecstasy."

325,07/03/2019,00:01,Solskjaer hails United's 'fantastic' history makers,Ole Gunner Solskjaer saluted Manchester United's never-say-die star as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals with an historic 3-1 win over Paris Saint Germain on Wednesday.,"United became the first team in European Cup history to recover from losing the first leg of a knockout round tie 2-0 at home. Romelu Lukaku scored twice either side of Juan Bernat's equaliser before Marcus Rashford converted a controversial stoppage time VAR-awarded penalty to send United through on away goals. It was an incredible result given United were without the suspended Paul Pogba as well as nine injured stars including Anthony Martial, Jesse Lingard and Ander Herrera. But United interim manager Solskjaer insisted he never doubted his players could do the unthinkable in the last 16 second leg in Paris. ""The belief in the boys was just what we hoped for. It was fantastic,"" Solskjaer told BT Sport. ""You always know it is possible. With this club this is what we do. It's Man Utd. It's the Champions League. That's what it does."" Faced with a daunting first leg deficit, Solskjaer admitted United desperately needed Lukaku's second minute goal to put the momentum back in their favour. Once United had opened the scoring, Solskjaer felt the French champions were haunted by the ghosts of their previous failures from winning positions in the Champions League, including blowing a 4-0 lead against Barcelona two years ago. ""It was a great start. We started with a plan to get the first goal, but we didn't expect it to come so soon,"" he said. ""We wanted an open game with many goals and that's what happened. ""There is always some mental doubt because they (PSG) have had those experiences. ""Our boys are young and fresh which gave us more energy when we needed that goal."" United had a huge slice of luck for the winner as VAR ruled that PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe, turning his back as he jumped, had handled a Diogo Dalot shot as it struck him on the arm in the penalty area. Kimpembe barely extended his arm at all, but Rashford made the most of the opportunity as he calmly netted from the spot. Solskjaer claimed it was the right decision, although he was nervous when Rashford stepped up to take his first ever penalty for United. ""The referee had a big, big call to make. My staff said the player made himself big, so it's a clear penalty,"" Solskjaer added. ""I was in the Champions League with Molde and we got a penalty in the last minute and my player missed that and we went out. ""I had to try and calm everyone down. Of course there were doubts. But Rashford, he's 21 and the pressure on the boy, there were no nerves whatsoever, fearless."" Solskjaer has had an astonishing impact since arriving from Molde to replace the sacked Jose Mourinho in December. He is yet to lose a domestic match and has won every away game in all competitions. After masterminding one of the great European comebacks it is impossible to think he won't get the job on a permanent basis. When asked about the prospect of taking charge full-time, the Norwegian said: ""Until the summer, let's see what happens."" England striker Rashford insisted he never felt even a second of concern as he endured the long wait to take the penalty while VAR looked at the incident. ""I think it was just about keeping a cool head. That's what you practice for. I wanted to take it,"" he said. ""Those moments are the moments we live for, and we want to come out of them smiling after. ""It's a beautiful thing, to have 10 players injured too, but it's an opportunity and it's what we deserve."""

Even so, Juan Bernat had netted in between for PSG, and it looked as though they would stumble on until the drama at the death.

While they celebrate, for PSG this defeat will feel like groundhog day. For the third year running they fail to make the quarter-finals, after their defeat at the hands of Real Madrid a year ago and their humiliating collapse against Barcelona in 2017. With what came before, this will feel even more painful for them and their Qatari owners. Electric at Old Trafford in the first leg, Kylian Mbappe was poor here and Neymar was again missing, watching from the stands as he recovers from injury. United were missing many more players, with Paul Pogba suspended and nine more sidelined due to fitness problems. Despite that, they pulled off one of their greatest European results, up there with their 3-2 win at Juventus in the 1999 semi-finals, which came after they fell two goals behind early on. Solskjaer was on the bench that night, and the Norwegian watched from the sideline here -- curiously looking like a substitute with a bib on over his jacket apparently due to a colour clash with PSG's kit -- as his side somehow went in front inside two minutes. A dreadful back-pass attempt by PSG defender Thilo Kehrer fell into no-man's land, and Lukaku pounced on the loose ball before rounding Gianluigi Buffon and scoring. Surely PSG were not about to blow it again? They did pull themselves together to equalise in the 12th minute, with Dani Alves releasing Mbappe in the box. As the away defence slept, Mbappe's ball across goal was turned in at the far post by Bernat, the defender scoring his third Champions League goal this season. Now it looked as though their start to the game would prove to be nothing more than a blip. The depleted visitors, with Eric Bailly at right-back and Fred, Scott McTominay and Andreas Pereira all in midfield, were incapable of keeping the ball. However, they were gifted another goal half an hour in. Not closed down 25 yards out, Rashford tried a shot that was powerful but straight at Buffon. Yet the veteran Italian, still hoping to win the Champions League for the first time aged 41, spilled the ball, and Lukaku followed in to score. It was a sixth goal in three games for the Belgian. PSG -- so slick in France -- were wobbling again at the business end of the Champions League. Di Maria had a goal ruled out for offside in the 56th minute and Mbappe then managed to fall when clean through late on, with Bernat sending the loose ball against the post.

327,06/03/2019,04:00,"Down, but not out - depleted Man Utd dream of famous comeback in Paris","A depleted Manchester United are hoping to pull off another remarkable Champions League comeback when they face Paris Saint-Germain in their last 16, second leg on Wednesday after a 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford last month.","Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side will have taken heart from the way Ajax recovered a 2-1 first-leg deficit to beat the holders Real Madrid 4-1 away on Tuesday and advance to the last eight. However, that was just the third time in the Champions League era that a team has gone through in the knockout phase after losing the first leg at home, the second time Ajax have done so. United are three-time European Cup winners, but they have never won any tie in continental competition after losing the first leg at home. And while Real are a shambles just now, PSG appear an ominous prospect, with Kylian Mbappe in rampant form. The English club had also never lost a home European game by more than one goal, although last month's loss to PSG remains their only defeat in 16 matches since Solskjaer replaced the sacked Jose Mourinho. ""It's never mission impossible,"" insisted the Norwegian, who was on the bench for the 1999 semi-final, second leg when United fell 2-0 down away to Juventus but came back to win the game 3-2 and go through. ""Of course it is more difficult, but we have to get the first goal and then anything can happen. ""Football is a technical and tactical game but it is also a mental game -- goals always change games, and if we get the first one, we will be believing even more, and they might start doubting themselves."" Solskjaer has managed to remain optimistic despite being without 10 first-team players due to injury or, in Paul Pogba's case, suspension. Five academy players have helped make up their squad. Despite their strong position, PSG could be forgiven for having doubts given the importance of Champions League progress to them and their failure to get to the quarter-finals since 2016. They fell to Madrid at this hurdle last year, while in 2017 they were humiliated by Barcelona, winning the first leg 4-0 but losing 6-1 in the return, although that was away. ""There are so many examples of teams that can change results like this,"" added Solskjaer, who has overseen eight straight away wins. However, it seems improbable that Thomas Tuchel's side -- themselves fresh from eight straight wins in all competitions -- could be eliminated here, even without Neymar. The world's most expensive player is still recovering from a metatarsal injury and on Monday was pictured at the Rio Sambadrome enjoying carnival celebrations. He is expected in Paris for Wednesday's game, however. ""Everything can happen, it is always possible that a team like Manchester in a last-16 tie can score the first goal and we must be ready for that and ready to show a reaction,"" warned Tuchel, who said his team should forget the first-leg result. ""These guys will be ready for everything. They will believe because it's a strong club with a strong history, with a very strong record under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, so we must prepare for the best Manchester United."" He said he would make a last-minute call on the fitness of striker Edinson Cavani, who has not played since before the first leg. Mbappe -- described as ""lightning"" by Solskjaer -- has been the main man for PSG recently though, scoring six times in four appearances since netting at Old Trafford. As well as the banned Pogba, United are missing Anthony Martial, Phil Jones, Antonio Valencia, Matteo Darmian, Juan Mata, Jesse Lingard, Ander Herrera, Nemanja Matic and Alexis Sanchez. The latter is out for up to six weeks with a knee injury. ""We'll never approach any game as a lost cause,"" Solskjaer insisted. ""I think our pride was hurt last time we played them, so we are going to see players that are going to give their all, and if we get nine or 10 at least playing up to the top standard we have a good chance. We can carry one or two, maybe."""

After a hesitant start to their European campaign, with the team lying third behind Liverpool and Napoli in Group C, PSG won their last two group matches to finish top. ""It's in these moments that we find the soul of a team. That's how we manage to weld a group,"" said Anelka, who had two spells at the Paris club in 1996-97 and 2000-02 either side of stints at Arsenal and Real Madrid. The much-travelled striker hailed the club's ""extraordinary"" staff, with a squad containing Brazilian superstars Dani Alves, Thiago Silva and the currently-injured Neymar, Argentina's Angel di Maria, Uruguay's Edinson Cavani and Mbappe, who was voted Best Young Player at last year's World Cup. Anelka said to him it was ""not a surprise"" that PSG cruised to a 2-0 victory at Manchester United in the last 16 first leg three weeks ago, reserving special praise for the ""precocious"" Mbappe whom he described as ""one of the best strikers in the world"" ahead of Wednesday's second leg in Paris. Anelka, 39, arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday as part of the World Soccer Stars, a programme to develop interest in football in the South Asian country where cricket is king. ""I like travelling, I liked everything I did, I travelled the world -- it's not because I was not stable, it's because after two years I had achieved that I had to accomplish,"" said Anelka, who has changed clubs 12 times and played in seven countries, including China and India. His international career ended when he was sent home from the 2010 World Cup after a bust-up with France coach Raymond Domenech but Anelka said he had ""no regrets."" The forward, who also played for Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City, now advises youth players at the Lille training centre and explained he wanted to bring the knowledge gained over his long career ""to the new generation"". ""There is hardly anyone who can have a better experience than me at home and abroad,"" he said."
329,05/03/2019,12:44,'I don't have an expiry date' - Alves eyes 2022 World Cup,"Injury deprived him of what looked like a last chance at World Cup glory last year, but Dani Alves is now spurred on by the dream of lifting the trophy with Brazil in Qatar in 2022.","""I don't have an expiry date. My body is my answer -- when I see that I can no longer compete, when my head is not in it anymore, it will be the time to stop,"" Alves said in an exclusive interview with AFP. ""What I do know is that I am going to try to get to the World Cup in 2022. My objective is to fight to get there -- I don't hold the key, but I will try."" Alves suffered a serious knee injury playing for Paris Saint-Germain in last season's French Cup final, barely a month before the World Cup in Russia. He had just turned 35 and it would take him six months to return to action. Since then, he has become an integral part of Thomas Tuchel's PSG side and has just been recalled to the Brazil squad. He is also set to feature when the French club face Manchester United in their Champions League last 16 return leg on Wednesday leading 2-0 from the first leg. Last season's French Cup was the 38th trophy won by Alves in a remarkable career that has included being part of three Champions League victories at Barcelona. The World Cup is the one trophy missing from his CV, so it is little wonder he is driven on by the prospect of finally winning it with Brazil, even if he will be 39 by the time the next tournament comes around. ""That is why the challenge sort of gets me going. It's like saying I've met the girl of my dreams. What do I say to her? I am going to try everything. Imagine ending your career as a world champion."" While many players younger than Alves have struggled to recover from serious knee injuries, the Brazilian says he ""never doubted"" he would be back. In his second season at PSG, Alves -- one of the greatest full-backs the game has seen -- has been reinvented by Tuchel as a midfielder. That may partly be down to a lack of alternatives. However, Alves insists it is not about him being unable to get up and down the right flank in the way he used to. The coach, he says, ""uses me for my intelligence in reading games, more than for my physical strengths, because as a midfielder I run more and I put in more effort than as a full-back. ""It is not about anything physical. I can play at full-back, but I can't use my reading of the game as much there. ""In the middle I can correct a wrong movement by a teammate, think more quickly than a teammate, and so he gets more out of me there than at full-back, which at the end of the day is more limited -- you go a little bit that way and you are off the pitch."" Alves first moved to Europe with Sevilla in 2002 -- and while he is a very well paid member of a superstar squad now, he claims sometimes it was ""hard"" in his early days. After 14 years in Spain he spent a season at Juventus before joining PSG in 2017, just before the arrival of his compatriot Neymar. His contract expires at the end of this season, but he and his partner, a model, enjoy life in Paris -- Alves himself is a fashion lover. So could he stay even longer? ""It doesn't depend on me, but if it were down to me then of course,"" he says. ""People are marked down for their age -- once you get past 30, people look at you a bit funny. When you get to 35 the questions are all 'when are you going to stop?' Calm down! I decide when I am going to stop. ""It's the old story, do you want a normal car, or something top of the range? That is how I am -- the older I am, the more expensive I am!"""
330,05/03/2019,02:08,De Gea's career crossroads a danger to Man Utd's revival,Manchester United's solitary defeat 16 games in to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's caretaker reign in charge against Paris Saint-Germain exposed the gulf the English giants still have to bridge to become a European powerhouse once more.,"But that the Red Devils travel to Paris on Wednesday trailing only 2-0 from the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie is thanks to David de Gea. The Spanish number one made two brilliant stops from Kylian Mbappe and Juan Bernat three weeks ago as PSG threatened to run riot to again underline his calibre as one of the best goalkeepers in the competition. With Paul Pogba suspended for the return to his native city, De Gea is the one United player who could walk into a PSG side that has divided goalkeeping duties between 41-year-old Italian legend Gianluigi Buffon and Alphonse Areola this season. Worryingly for United that prospect is all too real with De Gea so far holding out in contract negotiations to prolong his current deal beyond the summer of 2020. According to reports, De Gea is seeking at least parity with Alexis Sanchez as the club's highest earner. The Chilean joined United on a contract worth up to £500,000 ($660,000) a week including bonuses last January, but has not had anywhere near the desired impact, scoring just five goals in 41 appearances. By contrast, De Gea has won United's player of the year for four of the past five seasons and believes his consistency should be rewarded. But for a matter of minutes on the final day of August in 2015, De Gea's career could have been very different. A similar contract standoff between the player and club seemed to pave the way for a move to Real Madrid only for the fax confirming the transfer to miss the deadline. Madrid have since gone onto win the Champions League for the past three seasons with Keylor Navas in goal. The Costa Rican has performed well, but is not seen as being in De Gea's class, as evidenced by the fact Real pounced to sign Thibaut Courtois earlier this season when the Belgian also refused to extend his contract at Chelsea. As Real have reigned in Europe, United have faded. In the four seasons before De Gea signed, Alex Ferguson's side reached three Champions League finals. In the seven seasons since, United have made the quarter-finals just once and look likely to fall short of the last eight once more. Courtois's arrival appears to have closed the door to a move to Madrid. However, PSG and Italian champions Juventus are reportedly interested and could offer De Gea the guarantee of Champions League football -- while United battle just to make the Premier League's top four once more -- as well as a better chance to compete in the latter stages unless big changes are made at Old Trafford. Solskjaer hailed De Gea as ""the best goalkeeper in the world"" this week as he pleaded with him to commit his future to the club. The Norwegian has lifted the mood of players, staff and fans with is affable nature off the field and much improved results on it, making him the front runner for the manager's job on a full-time basis. A huge task remains ahead for whoever is in charge, though, not just to recruit the right players to make United contenders for titles at home and on the continent once more, but to convince one of their few truly world class talents United's new project is worth hanging around for."
331,04/03/2019,20:24,'Put the egos to one side' - Dani Alves and PSG's drive for Champions League glory,"Dani Alves jokes that Paris Saint-Germain are still Champions League ""virgins"", but the presence of players like the decorated Brazilian only helps make them more credible contenders to win the coveted trophy.","In a glittering career, Alves has won the Champions League three times with Barcelona and reached another final with Juventus. He is a veteran now, his 36th birthday falling several weeks before this season's final, and he is conscious of what players like him and goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, now 41, can add to a PSG squad already featuring Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. ""We know how to win and how to lose. What we try to transmit to the others is that either we all go together in the same direction, or we leave the doors open to a defeat,"" Alves tells AFP in an exclusive interview. He is speaking at the club's training ground in the upmarket Paris suburb of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, 48 hours before their last 16, second leg at home to Manchester United. The mood is relaxed, with confidence high in Paris that Thomas Tuchel's side will make good their 2-0 first-leg win last month, achieved without Neymar and Edinson Cavani, the two superstars both out injured. ""This is not a competition that depends only on one player having a spectacular day,"" he insists. ""When you have experienced players, you don't tremble when it comes to playing in a hostile atmosphere, or under pressure."" In his first campaign at PSG last season, they were knocked out at this stage by Real Madrid, the first time Alves had not been involved in the quarter-finals of the Champions League in a decade. It was an enormous disappointment for Paris and their Qatari owners, who had just paid the two biggest transfer fees in history for Neymar and Mbappe. ""I always talk about how we have special players here, like 'Ney', like Kylian, like 'Edi', who at some point can make the difference, and we have to help them,"" Alves says. ""Otherwise it would be like having a big meal without the right side dishes, and it wouldn't have the same flavour."" But what dish would he be? ""I'd be the fish, with the calm head, but at the same time..."" He uses his hands to motion a fish swimming through the water, the gesture suggesting a playful element, a touch of madness mixed with the intelligence. Alves, a brilliant full-back with limitless energy, has recently been reinvented as a midfielder, fully recovered from the knee injury which saw him miss last year's World Cup. He is happy in Paris, and the happiness is infectious. ""I like to get on with everyone. I ask myself how I can get on with this guy, with that guy. Because what happens on the pitch sort of reflects how things are off it,"" he says as he discusses getting along with a squad full of big names. ""We spend more time here than we do with our families, so you need to get on with people, have fun, and that is reflected on the pitch. ""We try to put the egos to one side -- because like it or not people have egos. ""We need to not let that show through, because then you stop thinking about being happy, and life is not about being right, it's about being happy!"" It is certainly easy to see how he might be happier now in Paris under Tuchel, a warmer, more charismatic coach than his predecessor, Unai Emery. PSG don't just want to get past United -- they want to go beyond the last eight, something they have not managed since the Qatari takeover in 2011. ""We are lucky this year to have a management team that is liked, respected by everyone, that there is an incredible atmosphere,"" he says. ""Everything has been put in place to make this a great year for us."""

PSG are favourites to progress to the quarter-finals, but 33-year-old Young has advised them to take nothing for granted after seeing United revive their season since the Norwegian's arrival. ""We know what we're capable of,"" he said. ""People can write us off. People were writing us off at the start of the season and people are writing us off now. It's no different. ""Obviously it's going to be tough. It's not going to be easy. We've got to go over there, win the game and score goals. ""I've got every faith if we defend well and if we create the chances that I know we can do, we can win the game."" Paul Pogba's red card in the first game means he is unavailable for the return while fellow midfielders Nemanja Matic, Ander Herrera, Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard appear on a casualty list that also includes Phil Jones, Matteo Darmian, Antonio Valencia, Anthony Martial and Alexis Sanchez. However, Young is confident the spirit that fuelled Saturday's 3-2 fightback victory over lowly Southampton will serve his team well once again. He said: ""That's the club's way, the United way. Never say die."" The odds are stacked against United but Solskjaer at least has striker Romelu Lukaku back in lethal form in front of goal after he claimed a fine double to help see off the Saints. The Belgium international has scored four times in his past two outings after a nine-game barren run. ""I wouldn't want to play against him,"" said Young. ""He does give us a different presence. ""It's good to see all the strikers in form, the whole team. It's not just 11 men on the pitch, it's a squad game. ""Everyone has got to be ready. Everyone has got to be prepared and ready to play when the manager calls on you. When you've got competition for places, it can only help."""

""In the future, everything is possible,"" he told Brazilian television channel Globo. ""I'm not saying I'm going to Real Madrid, calm down. Everybody knows I have already accomplished my dream which was (playing for) Barcelona. ""Real Madrid is one of the biggest teams in the world, every player perceived to have an interest in the club wants to play for them. Right now I'm very happy in Paris."" Neymar said Barcelona's Lionel Messi had sent him his regards after hearing about the Brazilian's most recent injury. ""At the time I needed support the most, from people and the team, the best in the world came to me to say 'I'm here to help you',"" Neymar said. The 27-year-old said PSG team-mate Kylian Mbappe will be one of the world's greatest ever players despite the pair both eyeing the biggest individual prizes in the sport. ""He's going to become one of the best players in the history of football and I'm trying to help him as best as possible. We have the same friendship as I had with Lionel, even competing for the Ballon d'Or,"" he said. Neymar will miss Wednesday's Champions League last-16 return leg against Manchester United with the metatarsal problem he suffered six weeks ago. He was sidelined for three months of last season with the same issue, returning just in time to play at the World Cup.

""The Champions League has given quite a few of those comebacks, PSG against Barcelona for example. We have to do it away from home, but we have eight straight wins away from home. ""We're confident away from home and if we're in the game with 20 or 30 minutes to go, who knows?"" Solskjaer's mentor Alex Ferguson became renowned for his team's last-minute winners during a golden era that featured the current United interim manager, who scored a stoppage-time winner in the 1999 Champions League final against Bayern Munich. And the Norwegian appeared to have summoned the spirits of the Ferguson era, after United claimed a crucial three points against lowly Southampton. ""It was like the old days,"" beamed Solskjaer, whose side now lead Arsenal by one point in the race for Champions League qualification, with Chelsea four points further back with two games in hand. ""I've been part of that so many times myself. We spoke about it at half-time and said get the ball in the box and play more forward because the Stretford End will suck it in for you. ""I don't want to take anything away from Andreas (Pereira) and Romelu, because they were great finishes, but that spirit is just part of this club's history. We have done it so many times before."" United appeared to be heading towards a disappointing home draw in the closing moments, when substitute Fred exchanged passes with Luke Shaw and found the in-form Lukaku on the edge of the area. The Belgian striker did the rest with a pinpoint 18-yard finish into the bottom corner. Solskjaer could even enjoy the luxury of a missed injury-time penalty when Paul Pogba's effort was well saved by Angus Gunn following Stuart Armstrong's trip on Marcus Rashford. But the finale, which extended Solskjaer's unbeaten run in domestic action with United to 15 games, was much-needed after it appeared his team would drop points in the chase for a top-four finish. In a game of spectacular goals, Saints midfielder James Ward-Prowse struck a superb 25-yard free-kick after 74 minutes to make the score 2-2. Pereira had equalised for United in the 53rd minute as substitute Diogo Dalot combined with Lukaku, forcing the ball through to the young Brazilian who took a touch before curling a magnificent finish into the Southampton goal. After a lacklustre first-half display, United were now in an irrepressible mood and took the lead just six minutes later through Lukaku. Pereira showed his strength to hold off challengers in midfield before slipping through an excellently-timed pass for Lukaku who finished clinically from 15 yards. It was an impressive turnaround from Solskjaer's team, who had been stunned by an incredible 26th-minute goal by Southampton wing-back Yan Valery. But there were question marks over David De Gea as Charlie Austin passed wide to the overlapping 20-year-old and his immaculate 30-yard strike beat the United goalkeeper at his near post. The dramatic conclusion was partly the result of some luck on Solskjaer's part as an injury to the ineffective Alexis Sanchez early in the second half forced him to bring on the far more influential Dalot."

That cancelled out Chadian forward Casimir Ninga's opener for Caen, and Mbappe then grabbed the winner in the 87th minute for his 29th goal in all competitions this season. Of those, 24 have come in the league, including six in the last four games. This was an eighth successive win for PSG in all competitions, and their enormous lead at the top of Ligue 1 is now 20 points before second-placed Lille play Dijon on Sunday. ""The coach said before the game that to prepare for the big matches we need to win the game before it,"" Mbappe told Canal+. ""We had a three-hour bus journey to get here and we didn't do that to come and see the tourist sights -- we wanted the victory, and now we are going to go home and focus on what is a very important match."" Coach Thomas Tuchel rested a host of players who are likely to start against United at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday, when Paris will look to follow through on their 2-0 win in the first leg last month. Gianluigi Buffon, Thiago Silva, Presnel Kimpembe, Juan Bernat, Marco Verratti and Julian Draxler were all either left on the bench or absent altogether. Neymar and Edinson Cavani are still sidelined, although the latter is now close to a comeback after a hip injury. ""The team worked hard for 90 minutes and to score such a late goal tells you something about our mentality,"" Tuchel told Canal+. ""Now we must analyse Manchester United again. They have some players missing and now they are doing things a bit differently so we need to look at what team we will put out."" United's 3-2 win over Southampton on Saturday continued their fine run under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, with the first leg against PSG remaining the Norwegian's only defeat in charge. PSG's humiliating collapse against Barcelona two years ago after they won the first leg 4-0 ensures they are not getting carried away. ""It's not good to play with fear, but it's not good to play with too much confidence either,"" added Tuchel. ""We have guys who played in Barcelona, who have that experience. ""We can't control the result, you never can in football, but we can control our performance."" PSG had hit the woodwork three times in the first half in Caen, through Layvin Kurzawa, Marquinhos and Angel Di Maria. The latter had a goal disallowed for offside too, but Caen also hit the frame of the goal in the first half via Enzo Crivelli's header. The Normandy side looked as if they might get their first league win of 2019 when they went ahead in the 56th minute, Faycal Fajr sending a free-kick through to Ninga, who controlled on his thigh and fired home. However, PSG were level within three minutes when Mbappe scored from the spot after a handball by young defender Younn Zahary. Di Maria then sent a header against the post soon after, but Paris won it with three minutes left, Mbappe scoring from two yards after a Thomas Meunier shot had been blocked. Caen remain in the relegation play-off place and are now five points behind 17th-placed Amiens, who drew 2-2 at Reims. Monaco are another point better off in 16th after coming from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Angers, Radamel Falcao scoring twice."

338,11/02/2019,02:30,Di Maria with point to prove on return to Old Trafford with PSG,"An expensive flop who lasted just a single season at Manchester United, Angel di Maria might be keen to prove a point when he goes back to Old Trafford as a Paris Saint-Germain player on Tuesday.","The Argentine, who turns 31 later this week, has a vital role to play for PSG in their crunch Champions League last 16, first leg against a resurgent United with Neymar and Edinson Cavani out injured. Those absences will place even more of an onus on Di Maria to show why PSG were prepared to make him their superstar signing in the summer of 2015, two years before Neymar and Kylian Mbappe arrived in the French capital. The former Benfica and Real Madrid man cost United a British record transfer fee of just under £60 million (almost 75 million euros at the time) in 2014, but he was an unmitigated failure in England. Di Maria scored only three times in 27 Premier League appearances in 2014/15 for a United side who finished fourth, a long way behind champions Chelsea. His time in England was also marred by an attempted burglary on his family's home outside Manchester that reportedly left his wife and daughter terrified, and keen to get away. His manager that year, Louis van Gaal, had hailed Di Maria as ""world class"" on his arrival, but their relationship quickly turned sour, with the player blaming the Dutchman for playing him out of position. ""I only stayed one year. It wasn't the best period of my career, or they didn't let me have my best time there,"" Di Maria said in a recent interview with radio station France Bleu. ""There were problems with the coach at the time. But thanks to God, I was able to come to PSG and be myself again."" United made a loss when they sold Di Maria for 63 million euros (£44.3 million at the time), but it was very much PSG's gain. Nicknamed 'El Fideo' (The Noodle)in Spain for his slender frame, Di Maria is in his fourth season in Paris and recently extended his contract to 2021. He has scored or created more than 70 goals in Ligue 1 for PSG, although he was signed chiefly to win big Champions League games and has been unable to prevent his side being knocked out in the last 16 in each of the last two seasons. Nevertheless, if Di Maria's days in Paris seemed numbered after Neymar and Mbappe signed in mega-bucks deals at the start of last season, he ended up being one of his team's most consistent performers in the last campaign. Since then, the appointment of Thomas Tuchel has coach has only helped a player who can perform in central midfield as well as on the wing. And if Tuchel's side are to overcome their injury problems and come away from Old Trafford in a strong position before next month's second leg in Paris, they will need Di Maria to show the United fans what they are missing. ""He was one of my favourite players when I used to watch him on television,"" Tuchel said at the start of this season after making it clear that Di Maria was just as important to him as the 'MCN' front three of Mbappe, Neymar and Edinson Cavani. ""He is a gift for me. Everything is very easy with him because he is a top professional. He has extraordinary quality and works so hard for the team."""

French sports daily L'Equipe reported earlier on Sunday that a medical had revealed a torn right-thigh muscle for Cavani, but PSG reported shortly afterwards the problem was the right hip. ""The tests carried out have shown an injury in the right hip. The treatment and the amount of recovery time will depend on how he reacts over the next few days,"" PSG said on their website. L'Equipe suggested Cavani, known as El Matador for his clinical finishing, would also miss the return leg March 6. Earlier Sunday Tuchel described Cavani's situation, stemming from a fiercely converted penalty on Saturday, as bleak. ""There is no good news for Edi this morning,"" he said. ""In my opinion the news is not going to be very good,"" Tuchel said. ""It will be very difficult for him to play,"" he predicted.

The PSG president will represent the ECA on the UEFA Executive Committee along with Italian Agnelli.

""His appointment must be rejected because it violates all the rules of good governance,"" Tebas said in a written statement sent to AFP last week. ""Not only because of the record (of PSG) in terms of Financial Fair Play, but also because (Al-Khelaifi) is president of beIN Sports, one of the main holders of television rights of UEFA,"" added the president of La Liga."

PSG will be without Brazilian forward Neymar for both legs of the last-16 clash against United after the world's most expensive player suffered an injury to his right foot last month. Elsewhere, Jordan Siebatcheu scored twice, including a 91st-minute winner, for Rennes as they came from behind to defeat 10-man Lille, who saw Adama Soumaoro sent off after just 19 minutes.

Ben Arfa joined PSG in 2016, but was sidelined from April 2017 until his contract expired at the end of last season. He played in 23 Ligue 1 matches for PSG, often as a substiute, without scoring a single league goal. French newspaper Journal du Dimanche reported he is claiming he was shut out after the club took exception to the player appealing directly to PSG's owner, the emir of Qatar, over a lack of contact with the club's president Nasser Al-Khelaifi. Ben Arfa, who is currently with Ligue 1 side Rennes, is seeking between seven and eight million euros ($8 million and $9.1 million) in damages for ""discrimination"" he suffered for non-sporting reasons, French radio station RMC Sport reported. The damages correspond to bonuses Ben Arfa says are unpaid. Once one of his country's brightest prospects, Paris-born Ben Arfa joined his home-town side among much fanfare after a standout season at Ligue 1 rivals Nice that helped rebuild a tarnished reputation following a disappointing period with Hull City in England. He began his professional career with Lyon, before spells with Marseille and three and a half seasons with Newcastle. After leaving PSG as a free agent he joined Rennes at the start of the season."
344,04/02/2019,15:05,Herrera wants United to maintain Fulham focus ahead of PSG clash,Ander Herrera has urged Manchester United to maintain their concentration on the task facing them at Fulham this weekend as they head into a month of crunch games.,"Sunday's 1-0 win at Leicester extended caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's unbeaten start to 10 games and saw United move up to fifth place in the Premier League table, just two points adrift of the top four. Next week they face Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League before a fifth-round FA Cup tie against Chelsea on February 18 which is in turn followed by an Old Trafford clash with Premier League leaders Liverpool, United's arch-rivals. But before all those fixtures United have the seemingly more straightforward task of a league match away to second-bottom Fulham on Saturday. United midfielder Herrera, however, said: ""It will be a big mistake if we think further than Fulham, that's a massive game for us because (fourth-placed) Chelsea are playing (Manchester) City. Let's go game by game, because if you lose one game you regret. ""Now for Fulham, then we will think about PSG. The best way to prepare for the PSG game is to try and win away at Fulham and that's the way I think."" Meanwhile the Spain international said talk of United remaining unbeaten under Solskjaer this season was fanciful given the quality of opposition they must face in the remainder of the campaign. ""That is impossible, the Premier League is so tough, City is a fantastic team and they lost away at Newcastle the other day,"" he said. ""In the Premier League it's impossible to go unbeaten from when the manager came in, to have 25 or 30 games unbeaten."" United's form has improved hugely under Solskjaer since he replaced the sacked Jose Mourinho but Herrera was coy when asked if the Norwegian should be appointed on a permanent basis. ""We are very happy with him at the moment but it's not my decision,"" said Herrera. ""I'm not going to do comparisons. I am only going to speak about what is happening now. I'm not comparing. We are very happy with him, everyone feels free. ""We're playing with a lot of freedom, this is one of the things he is talking about every day."""

""I don't know if the defeat was deserved. In the first half it was deserved, but after half-time, we still dominated,"" said PSG forward Kylian Mbappe. The reigning champions remain 10 points clear of second-placed Lille at the top of the table despite the defeat, with two games in hand, while Lyon strengthened their grip on third spot, three points further back. ""We did what we had planned, namely high pressing, quick transitions, and to cause them problems every time we had the ball,"" said Lyon coach Bruno Genesio. ""I don't think they're used to that in Ligue 1."" All eyes will now turn to the Champions League for PSG, with only a French Cup tie at third-tier Villefranche and a home game against Bordeaux to come before the last-16, first-leg clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford on February 12. Man United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his assistant Mike Phelan were both in attendance at the Groupama Stadium on Sunday, just hours after their side's 1-0 Premier League win at Leicester. The pair would have learned plenty from watching Lyon regularly slice through the PSG defence against seemingly little resistance, while Mbappe shouldered the majority of the attacking responsibility in the absence of the injured Neymar. ""I'm not worried about the Champions League,"" insisted Mbappe. ""We must take it match by match and wait for the Champions League."" On paper, this looked the toughest test remaining for PSG in their bid to go through the league season unbeaten, having won on just two of their previous 13 Ligue 1 visits to Lyon, losing seven. But Thomas Tuchel's men almost forged ahead inside the first two minutes, as Kylian Mbappe raced clear only to shoot tamely at Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. The away side did not have to wait long to strike, though, as Houssem Aouar carelessly gifted possession to Julian Draxler, who strode forward and teed up Di Maria to slot in his 10th goal of the season. But Lyon, on a six-match unbeaten run in the league themselves, quickly improved and twice wasted clear-cut chances to level, as PSG 'keeper Alphonse Areola denied Bertrand Traore from point-blank range before Dembele nodded wide. Areola had to be alert again, springing to his right to tip away a vicious long-range drive from Nabil Fekir, before producing a wonderful double stop from Traore and Memphis Depay. However, just seconds after another excellent save to deny Fekir, Areola was totally at fault for Lyon's 33rd-minute equaliser. The 25-year-old misjudged Leo Dubois' cross, allowing Dembele the simplest of tasks to head into the net. PSG almost snatched a half-time lead against the run of play, but Lyon centre-back Jason Denayer made an incredible diving header to keep out Draxler's close-range shot. Lyon, who face Barcelona in the Champions League knockout stage, continued to dominate after the restart, and were awarded a spot-kick when Dembele was brought down by Thiago Silva, with Fekir doing the rest. That provoked PSG into life, and Lopes made two brilliant saves from Mbappe in the space of just 20 seconds. Mbappe was PSG's best hope of salvaging their unbeaten record, but he saw Lopes divert away a low drive, before former Celtic striker Dembele wasted a golden opportunity to wrap up the points as he was again foiled by Areola. But Lyon held on anyhow, ending their opponents' 21-game unbeaten run in the French top flight."
346,02/02/2019,17:48,Buffon would like to stay a second season at PSG,"Goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon said on Saturday that he wants ""to stay another season"" at Paris Saint-Germain.","The 41-year-old, who played 176 times for Italy and won the World Cup in 2006, arrived as a free agent from Juventus last summer on a one-year contract with an option for a second. At PSG, he has split goalkeeping duties with Alphonse Areola, who was part of the France squad that won the World Cup last summer. ""If Alphonse and the club want it, I would stay another season here, but for the moment, it's important to stay focused on the objective, the match in Lyon, then Bordeaux and after that Manchester,"" Buffon said. Runaway Ligue 1 leaders PSG visit third-placed Lyon on Sunday and take on Manchester United in the last 16 of the Champions League on February 12 and March 6. ""As to my contract for the next season, we have plenty of time to think about it,"" said Buffon, at a press conference he gave with Areola on Saturday. Meanwhile, coach Thomas Tuchel said Saturday he was ""not completely satisfied"" with the club's dealings in the January transfer window but that he ""wasn't angry."" Tuchel had asked for two players to increase his defensive options, but the club only landed one. ""Angry, no, no,"" the German said. ""The winter transfer window is so complicated. Who wants to lose a player? ""There are very few possibilities in the winter transfer window. The challenge is putting together a team during the summer."" ""If you need to do a lot of deals in the winter, you will probably be disappointed,"" Tuchel added. At Christmas, he asked for ""a second (Marco) Verratti and a second Marquinhos"" but PSG only bought Argentine midfielder Leandro Paredes for an estimated 47 million euros ($54m) from Zenit Saint Petersburg, while Everton turned down PSG bids for Idrissa Gueye. PSG have lost Neymar with injury until early April and midfielder Adrien Rabiot remains at the club after the transfer window but has expressed his desire to leave. ""If you ask if I'm satisfied with Paredes, I say clearly yes,"" Tuchel said. ""He has the quality and personality to play for PSG,"" he said. ""He has a good vision of the game. He can accelerate play. He can make a lot of passes."" Tuchel denied reports that his relationship with sporting director Antero Henrique had deteriorated. ""Our relationship during the transfer window is always very, very close, I have my opinion, he has his own,"" said the German. ""We have to do the best for the club."""
347,01/02/2019,14:05,Transfer window slim pickings expose tensions at PSG,"Despite being one of the biggest spenders in Europe in the January transfer window, Paris Saint-Germain have lost Neymar to injury at a crucial point in the season and risk being undermined by tensions behind the scenes.","In what was a quiet window on the whole, the capital club spent a reported 47 million euros ($54 million) to sign Argentine international Leandro Paredes from Zenit Saint Petersburg and provide a much-needed extra option in midfield. However, PSG remained light in that area with contract rebel Adrien Rabiot frozen out, and sporting director Antero Henrique spent the final days of the transfer window trying to add another signing. Nevertheless, a move for Everton's Idrissa Gueye failed to materialise after the English club rejected their initial offer, and an approach for Lille's Thiago Mendes did not come to fruition either. Meanwhile, PSG reportedly pulled the plug on a move for Argentine playmaker Luciano Acosta of DC United. The latter would have been another creative option for coach Thomas Tuchel, who will be without Neymar until early April after the world's most expensive player succumbed to a metatarsal injury last week. ""The winter window closed amidst total confusion for Paris Saint-Germain,"" said Le Parisien on Friday. PSG's prospects of beating Manchester United in the Champions League last 16 -- the first leg is set for February 12 -- now appear to hang very much in the balance. Reports in France have highlighted friction between Tuchel and the Portuguese Henrique, and Arsene Wenger is now being touted as a possible successor to the current sporting director. ""It is a position that could really interest him,"" a source close to Wenger told AFP. None of those issues should prevent PSG from retaining the Ligue 1 title, as they come into a weekend that will see them go to Lyon on Sunday with a lead of 13 points over Lille in second, and with two games in hand. PSG have won on just one of their last five visits to Lyon on league duty and this could be the biggest obstacle yet to their unbeaten record in Ligue 1 under Tuchel. Elsewhere, Saint-Etienne in fourth host fifth-placed Strasbourg, who made it through to the League Cup final in midweek by beating Bordeaux in the last four. They will play Guingamp in the final in Lille in March, after the Brittany side beat Monaco on penalties. Despite their defeat, it was an improved performance from the principality side in the first game of Leonardo Jardim's second spell in charge. As well as the change in coach, it was a chaotic January at the Stade Louis II, with eight players arriving in the transfer window and another eight leaving. Two new faces came in on deadline day, as former Marseille winger Georges-Kevin Nkoudou signed on loan from Tottenham Hotspur and French-born Portuguese international midfielder Adrien Silva joined on loan from Leicester City. Youri Tielemans went in the opposite direction on loan having been deemed surplus to requirements by Jardim. Monaco host Toulouse on Saturday still in the relegation zone, and still looking for a first home win this season. ""I don't want to talk about the past. We know what has happened. My objective now is the present. With the squad we have here we are capable of succeeding,"" said Jardim. There is a reduced league card in France this weekend as Nantes play in the French Cup, in a tie that was postponed 10 days ago in the wake of Emiliano Sala's disappearance."
348,30/01/2019,14:12,Neymar to miss Man Utd tie after being ruled out for 10 weeks,Neymar will miss both legs of Paris Saint-Germain's upcoming Champions League last-16 tie against Manchester United after the French club confirmed on Wednesday that the world's most expensive player would be out for 10 weeks with a metatarsal injury.,"However, Neymar will not undergo an operation, with PSG saying the 26-year-old Brazilian had instead agreed on ""a conservative treatment"" that could see him return in time for the Champions League quarter-finals in April should they qualify. ""After detailed analysis by specialists, a consensus was reached of a conservative treatment of Neymar's injury to the fifth right metatarsal,"" the French champions said. ""Informed of this recommendation, Paris Saint-Germain's Brazilian international striker agreed with this protocol. As a result, Neymar is expected to return to the field within 10 weeks."" Neymar suffered the injury in PSG's 2-0 French Cup win against Strasbourg last week, and his coach Thomas Tuchel had already all but ruled the 222-million-euro forward out of the first leg against United at Old Trafford on February 12. The second leg of that tie is scheduled for March 6, and the timeline announced by the club means he could just make it back in time for a quarter-final first leg, due to be played on April 9 and 10. The second legs are set for the following week. ""Paris Saint-Germain sends its strongest support and encouragement to Neymar Jr. to overcome this injury, with the courage and determination that the player has always shown,"" the club added. While Neymar will now sit out a crucial period in PSG's season, there has also been concern in Brazil, which will host the Copa America in June and July. An operation would have put Neymar's participation in that tournament at risk, as well as effectively ending his club season. Brazil coach Tite and national team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar have been in Paris this week to visit Neymar, who suffered a fracture to the same right foot at the end of February last year. He underwent an operation, performed by Lasmar, and returned just in time for the World Cup in Russia last June. Then, the injury ruled him out of the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid, hampering PSG's hopes of overturning a first-leg deficit. They went on to lose that tie 5-2 on aggregate to the eventual winners. But while last year the Brazilian national team's influence proved crucial in persuading Neymar to go under the knife, this time PSG were determined to play the deciding role in the treatment of their record signing. ""The club took control of the matter,"" a source close to PSG told AFP. So how will they get the former Barcelona superstar back to full fitness in two and a half months without an operation? ""A simple consolidation of the affected bone by orthopaedic treatment, which could also be accompanied by the injection of stem cells,"" an expert in sports rehabilitation, who asked not to be named, told AFP. Neymar's new injury is a major boost to United, who are unbeaten since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer replaced the sacked Jose Mourinho in the dugout. It is also a blow to PSG's ambitions of going all the way in Europe after years of disappointment in the Champions League since the Qatari takeover of the club in 2011. Neymar has scored 20 goals this season in 23 appearances, including five in the Champions League group stage. His injury comes just as the Ligue 1 leaders are also sweating on the fitness of key midfielder Marco Verratti, who has an ankle problem. Fellow midfielder Adrien Rabiot has been frozen out over his refusal to sign a new contract, but PSG yesterday completed the signing of Argentine international midfielder Leandro Paredes from Zenit Saint Petersburg. Paredes signed on a four-and-a-half-year deal for a reported fee of 47 million euros ($54 million), and the club are also keen on the Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye."
349,29/01/2019,20:38,PSG outcast Jese loaned to Betis,"Unwanted Spanish forward Jese Rodriguez has joined Real Betis on loan from Paris Saint-Germain for the remainder of the season, the French champions said on Tuesday.","Jese, a former Spain youth international, signed for PSG from Real Madrid in 2016 but struggled to make an impact and was shipped out on loan to Las Palmas and Stoke the past two years. The 25-year-old made his first PSG appearance since December 2016 in last week's French Cup win over Strasbourg after coming on as a substitute for the final seconds."
350,29/01/2019,10:43,PSG sign Argentina midfielder Paredes before Man Utd clash,"Paris Saint-Germain have completed the signing of Argentina midfielder Leandro Paredes on a four-and-a-half-year deal, the French champions announced on Tuesday.","The 25-year-old put pen to paper on a contract until 2023 after completing a medical in Qatar. No transfer fee was disclosed, although press reports have put the fee at 47 million euros ($54m). ""Leandro's arrival will keep the momentum, both on the pitch and among our supporters, ahead of the major events coming up. Exciting times lie ahead,"" PSG's Qatari president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said in a club statement. The Ligue 1 leaders were looking to strengthen in midfield ahead of their Champions League last-16 tie against Manchester United, with Marco Verratti sidelined with an ankle injury and Adrien Rabiot frozen out after refusing to sign a new contract. PSG go to Old Trafford in the first leg of that tie on February 12, and they are currently sweating on the fitness of Neymar, who suffered a metatarsal injury last week. Paredes, who has won nine caps but was not part of Argentina's squad at last year's World Cup, has previously played for Boca Juniors and Roma. He moved to Zenit in 2017."
351,27/01/2019,23:33,'Super difficult' for Neymar to be fit to face Man Utd - PSG coach,Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel has admitted Neymar is unlikely to be fit in time for the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Manchester United next month.,"""It's going to be super difficult"", Tuchel told Canal+ when asked if Neymar would return from a metatarsal injury in time for the game at Old Trafford on February 12. ""It is still too early to talk about a return date because we need to wait and see how 'Ney' reacts to treatment to be more precise,"" he said after PSG beat Rennes 4-1 at the Parc des Princes. Tuchel's admission came after newspaper Le Parisien claimed on Sunday evening that Neymar had suffered ""a hairline fracture of the fifth metatarsal"", exactly where the Brazilian underwent an operation on a fracture in March last year. Neymar missed the last three months of last season as a result, including the second leg of PSG's Champions League last-16 defeat against Real Madrid. He only returned just in time for the World Cup. ""I can't confirm a new diagnosis. I think the club has said everything about this injury for the moment and now we need to wait,"" Tuchel added. PSG have only said that Neymar had suffered ""a painful reactivation of the right fifth metatarsal"" in Wednesday's French Cup win against Strasbourg. Brazil team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar is expected to visit the world's most expensive player on Monday. The second leg of the Manchester United tie is scheduled for March 6."
352,27/01/2019,23:14,PSG cruise to victory as worries grow over Neymar fitness,Edinson Cavani scored twice as Paris Saint-Germain shook off the loss of Neymar to injury with a 4-1 win over Rennes at the Parc des Princes on Sunday that keeps them unbeaten at the top of Ligue 1.,"The Uruguayan's goals took him to 16 for the season in 14 league appearances and bookended the scoring in the French capital, with Angel Di Maria and Kylian Mbappe also on target for PSG. Mbaye Niang had equalised for Rennes in the first half, but Thomas Tuchel's side eventually ran away with the game after the break and are once again a massive 13 points ahead of Lille at the top of the table, with two matches in hand. Despite that, this encounter was played out in a rather flat atmosphere, with one end of the stadium partially closed as a punishment following incidents during a game late last year. Brazil coach Tite and national team coordinator Edu were in attendance at the start of a European tour to check on the form of some of their key players, but it is unclear what they will have taken from this game. Neymar was missing after suffering a metatarsal injury in a French Cup win over Strasbourg in midweek, with some media reports in France now claiming that the world's most expensive player will definitely miss the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Manchester United on February 12. Meanwhile, a lack of alternatives meant Tuchel fielded Marquinhos and Daniel Alves out of position together in midfield. On top of that, skipper Thiago Silva was caught out as Niang flicked Rennes level just before the half-hour, cancelling out Cavani's headed opener from a Di Maria cross. Rennes were arguably the better side in the first half, although Tuchel was raging after Niang escaped with a yellow card for a dangerous challenge on Thilo Kehrer. The referee upheld his decision even after a VAR review. Nevertheless, PSG ran away with the game after the break, going back in front on the hour mark when Silva sent Di Maria through to clip a delightful finish over Tomas Koubek. When Clement Grenier was caught in possession, Julian Draxler released Mbappe to score his 18th league goal of the campaign and make it 3-1. PSG completed the scoring in the 71st minute when Mbappe squared for Cavani to grab his second of the evening, making it 15 goals in three home wins for them in nine days. Earlier, Lyon strengthened their grip on a Champions League position after defender Jason Denayer's headed goal handed them a 1-0 win at Amiens. With their Champions League last-16 first leg against Barcelona looming on the horizon, Lyon remain third in Ligue 1, three points behind second-placed Lille. Lille won 2-1 at Marseille on Friday in a game which was held up for more than half an hour in the second half after a firecracker thrown from the stands exploded next to home player Kevin Strootman. Struggling Monaco slumped to a 2-0 defeat at relegation rivals Dijon on Saturday in their first game since Thierry Henry was sacked as coach. Henry lasted just three months in charge before being replaced by his predecessor Leonardo Jardim, who watched Saturday's game in the stands in Dijon. Monaco remain three points from outright safety."
353,26/01/2019,23:12,Monaco plight persists in wake of Henry exit,"Monaco suffered another damaging defeat as they lost 2-0 at Dijon in Ligue 1 on Saturday, just 24 hours after reappointing former boss Leonardo Jardim to take over from the sacked Thierry Henry.","Former France and Arsenal star Henry was suspended and later axed by Monaco after just two wins in the league since his arrival in October. Jardim, who led Monaco to the French title in 2017, is returning to the club only three months after he was dismissed following a dreadful start to the season. His first game back in charge will be Tuesday's League Cup semi-final against Guingamp, as Henry's former assistant Franck Passi oversaw the trip to fellow strugglers Dijon. The abject nature of this latest defeat further emphasised Monaco's perilous position in the table where they remain second from bottom, a point above last-placed Guingamp. ""We're giving everything but it's not enough,"" said Monaco captain Radamel Falcao. ""Each player has to continue to give more, all of us together. We're all in the same boat. ""We didn't manage to change things with Thierry Henry and now we must carry on with a better spirit and all fight together."" Dijon's Kwon Chang-hoon notched his first league goal since May, having recently returned from an Achilles injury, with a calm finish on 24 minutes after a static Naldo played the South Korean onside. Monaco were reduced to 10 men on the hour when Brazilian Naldo saw red for a clumsy challenge on Julio Tavares, and another defensive lapse allowed Naim Sliti to wrap up what was just Dijon's second league win since August. It was Naldo's second red card in a week after he was also dismissed in the 5-1 loss to Strasbourg last Saturday. ""We had chances just like in the past four of five matches but we always make a mistake that kills us,"" said Passi, who refused to be drawn on his own future. ""We let the other team go ahead and we're chasing after the result and that obviously makes it harder,"" he added. ""These players have the quality. They have what it takes to stay up but they just need for things to click and for it to happen quickly."" Youcef Atal and Allan Saint-Maximin scored for Patrick Vieira's Nice in a 2-0 home win over Nimes, while Kenny Lala fired home a sweet half-volley with practically the final kick to give Strasbourg a 1-0 victory over Bordeaux. Reims climbed into the top half as a 1-0 win at Guingamp stretched their unbeaten run to six matches. On Sunday, leaders Paris Saint-Germain will host Rennes without the injured Neymar. The world's most expensive player limped out of Wednesday's French Cup win over Strasbourg after hurting his foot, an injury similar to the one that ruled him out for more than two months last season. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel has said it is ""still too early"" to assess the seriousness of Neymar's injury, leaving the French giants sweating over his fitness ahead of their Champions League clash with Manchester United next month."
354,25/01/2019,13:10,PSG sweat over Neymar as Henry gets pushed aside by Monaco,Paris Saint-Germain are hoping Neymar's prayers are answered after the runaway Ligue 1 leaders' talisman suffered a fresh metatarsal injury just weeks from their huge Champions clash with Manchester United.,"Neymar invoked divine intervention after being forced to leave the field in tears during their 2-0 French Cup win over Strasbourg in midweek with the same injury that curtailed the Brazilian's campaign last season. ""Your will be done, my God"" he wrote in an Instagram post. Although fans in Paris are concerned about the danger of Neymar missing the two games against a rejuvenated United, his absence should not have much impact on PSG's title defence. Thomas Tuchel's side are 13 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 going into their home meeting with Rennes on Sunday, and with serious domestic opposition lacking, most in the French capital are now looking ahead to Old Trafford on February 12. Tuchel admitted that both the player and PSG's medical staff are ""worried"" about the injury, and bemoaned that ""the referee didn't give anything"" despite what he saw as persistent fouling from Strasbourg. PSG's domestic task has been made easier by the atrocious form of Monaco and Marseille, who this week have made moves to reverse their fortunes in desperate campaigns. Thierry Henry's suspension as Monaco coach on Thursday came ahead of the principality club's huge relegation clash with fellow strugglers Dijon on Saturday evening, and just hours after he told reporters ""my future is not a problem"". Leonardo Jardim -- the man who Henry replaced following an atrocious start to the season -- is favourite to retake his place on the Monaco bench once the former France and Arsenal striker's sacking is made official. Henry was relieved of his coaching duties with Monaco in the bottom two having won just two league matches since his arrival in mid-October. A French Cup humilation at the hands of second-tier Metz in midweek proved to be the final straw, although Monaco could escape from the relegation zone should they beat Dijon, who are two points ahead in 18th. Marseille, meanwhile, are hoping Mario Balotelli can add goals to a spluttering attack as they prepare for the visit of second-placed Lille on Friday. Seventh-placed Marseille's 1-0 victory at Caen last weekend was their first in nearly two months, a period in which they have been knocked out of both domestic cups and the Europa League. The Italy international has joined from Nice but admitted he needs ""to get back into the rhythm of matches and training"" after making just nine league appearances all season, scoring no goals. Meanwhile, ""shocked"" Nantes will not pay they respects to their former striker Emilano Sala before their French Cup fixture at third-tier Entente Sannois Saint-Gratien this weekend. The tie was postponed in midweek following the disappearance of the Argentine in a plane crash in the English Channel. Police on Guernsey called off the search for the 28-year-old, who was travelling to Wales after signing for Premier League club Cardiff City when the plane disappeared from radar near the British island on Monday. However, Sala's family continue to hope he will appear alive. ""We ask you to respect the family who absolutely refuse to talk about mourning and ask us to keep believing,"" Nantes captain Valentin Rongier told the more than 300 fans who came to an open training session on Thursday. ""It is for this reason that we are not going to have a minute's silence or a minute's applause because we still have hope."" Nantes have had their league fixture against Saint-Etienne moved from Saturday to Wednesday."

The severity of the new injury is not yet known, although Neymar was able to walk off the field unsupported. ""Initial tests carried out revealed a painful reactivation of the injury to the fifth metatarsal,"" a club statement said Thursday. ""The treatment will depend on progress over the coming days,"" it said, adding all medical options would be considered. Neymar initially tried to continue playing. But he covered his eyes -- in tears, according to witnesses -- as he was forced off to be replaced by Moussa Diaby just after the hour mark. His early departure was a worrying moment for PSG, with the world's most expensive player having missed the final three months of last season after breaking the same bone. Each season PSG, which dominates France's domestic league, is judged according to its Champions League results. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel after the game said: ""The doctor is worried, 'Ney' is worried, because it is the same foot, the same place."" ""It was a situation where he was fouled three times, one after the other. The referee didn't give anything. He twisted his foot."" The PSG coach was also unhappy with suggestions from the Strasbourg players and coach that Neymar had provoked the injury by winding up his opponents. ""It's Neymar's style, but don't come and complain when you get kicked,"" Strasbourg's Anthony Goncalves told broadcaster Eurosport. ""He is a great player, I respect him. He can enjoy himself but don't come blubbering afterwards."" Edinson Cavani and Angel di Maria got the goals on a bitterly cold night at the Parc des Princes. Tuchel had left out the ill Kylian Mbappe for this game, with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting handed a rare start in place of the superstar France forward. The Cameroon international set up Cavani for the fourth-minute opener, before Di Maria -- who had earlier hit the post -- finished into the roof of the net 10 minutes from time as PSG stay on track to win the French Cup for the fifth season running. Before kick-off, fans applauded and chanted the name of Emiliano Sala, the former Nantes striker who is feared dead after the plane he was travelling in disappeared over the Channel Islands on Monday as he was on his way to join his new club Cardiff City. Nantes' own Cup tie away at third-tier Entente Sannois Saint-Gratien has been postponed until Sunday, with their players still in shock over Sala's disappearance. Elsewhere, Caen ended the run of plucky sixth-tier amateurs Viry-Chatillon in a 6-0 rout, with Yacine Bammou setting the Ligue 1 club on their way. An emotional Bammou raised his hands towards the sky after his early goal, in tribute to Sala, with whom he played at Nantes last season. Caen coach Fabien Mercadal said Bammou had made clear his desire to be involved despite the tragic turn of events. ""We talked about it. What happened is not fair. He was a friend to Yacine, he was deeply affected. The worst thing for him would have been to not play,"" said Mercadal. A group of Caen supporters, for whom Sala spent the second half of the 2014-15 season on loan, also fastened a banner that read ""Emiliano"" to a fence surrounding the pitch. Naim Sliti scored a hat-trick as relegation-threatened Dijon claimed a stunning 6-3 win away at Saint-Etienne for their first victory under new coach Antoine Kombouare, while Rennes overcame fourth-division Saint-Pryve 2-0.

His existing deal expires at the end of the season and Rabiot has been strongly linked with a move to Barcelona, either for free in the summer, or even before the January transfer window closes. The French league (LFP) confirmed on Monday that Rabiot has taken the matter to their legal committee, claiming that PSG's decision to banish him goes against the ""professional footballer's charter"". That charter only allows for players to be ordered to train apart ""on a temporary basis"" and for ""exclusively sporting reasons"". Rabiot is reportedly happy to stay at PSG for the remainder of the campaign before moving to La Liga. His enforced absence comes at a time when PSG are short of options in midfield and have just lost Italian playmaker Marco Verratti to an ankle injury. With the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Manchester United just three weeks away, PSG desperately need to bring in reinforcements before the January window shuts. ""I respect the club's decision and I can understand it,"" said coach Thomas Tuchel when asked about Rabiot's absence last week. ""I need to focus on my team, on who is available."" Hatem Ben Arfa was also frozen out and ordered to train with the PSG reserves last season. He joined Rennes at the start of this campaign."

Weigl, usually a defensive midfielder, slotted into defence at centre-back in Leipzig as cover for the Swiss Manuel Akanji, who is sidelined long-term, and was magnificent as Axel Witsel's first-half strike gave Dortmund the three points. Zorc described Weigl's performance against Leipzig as ""flawless"", even though he was playing out of position, as more than 95 percent of his passes hit their target. US midfielder Christian Pulisic will join Chelsea in July, but Zorc had ruled out the sale of any other Dortmund stars in the current transfer window, which closes in Germany at 1700 GMT on January 31, as ""we don't want to let go of the players we need to achieve our goals"". Reports emerged last week that Weigl has been in contact with PSG's former Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, who gave the 23-year-old his Bundesliga debut in 2015. In December, AS Roma and Arsenal were both also reportedly interested in signing Weigl, who has made five appearances for Germany. Dortmund host second-from-bottom Hanover 96 next Saturday and Zorc says club captain and playmaker Marco Reus is expected to only be out for ""one or perhaps two weeks maximum"" after picking up an injury in training on Friday."
361,19/01/2019,19:05,PSG claim record home win with 9-0 thrashing of Guingamp,Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani both scored hat-tricks as Paris Saint-Germain romped to their biggest-ever home win with a 9-0 Ligue 1 thrashing of Guingamp on Saturday.,"The runaway league leaders gained sweet revenge on bottom club Guingamp, who had ended their bid for a sixth straight League Cup title earlier this month in Paris. It was PSG's largest victory at the Parc des Princes, beating an 8-0 win over Dijon 12 months ago, but fell narrowly short of equalling their biggest win in total -- a 10-0 French Cup thumping of Cote Chaude in 1994. The capital club, who lead second-placed Lille by 13 points with two games in hand, have dropped just four points in their opening 19 matches of the season as they bid for an unbeaten league campaign. Neymar also scored twice as PSG's front three took their combined tally for the season to 58 goals, while Mbappe extended his advantage in the Ligue 1 scoring charts having netted 17 times in only 14 appearances. Coach Thomas Tuchel did see Marco Verratti forced from the field with what he later described as a ""serious injury"", with the Italian now a doubt for PSG's Champions League last-16 tie against Manchester United next month. ""It's possible he'll miss a few weeks,"" said the German. ""Marco's injury changes everything. Playing without Marco is completely different, I think it's serious. It's hard."" PSG wasted little time in forging ahead, with a wonderful 11th-minute goal by Neymar doing the damage. His former Brazil international team-mate Dani Alves picked out the world's most expensive player with a sumptuous pass over the top, and Neymar flicked the ball over Guingamp right-back Jordan Ikoko and slotted in his 19th goal of the season. The home side were utterly dominant in the first half, monopolising possession as Angel Di Maria headed wide and Neymar fired a free-kick well over. But the 26-year-old was involved as PSG all but ended the game as a contest eight minutes before half-time, playing a neat one-two with Mbappe which allowed the World Cup winner to side-foot into the corner of the net. Mbappe added another goal on the stroke of the interval, as Cavani's pass found him in acres of space inside the Guingamp box. The game was even more one-sided after the restart, with Cavani tapping in Juan Bernat's low cross just before the hour mark, before nodding Di Maria's swinging delivery past helpless Guingamp goalkeeper Marc-Aurele Caillard. Guingamp, who remain four points adrift of safety at the foot of the table, were totally unable to deal with the reigning champions, as Mbappe sent Neymar racing clear to slide the ball under Caillard in the 68th minute. Cavani won the three-man race to a hat-trick by miskicking a rebound in off the post, with the goal awarded by VAR, before the Uruguayan's square pass was diverted into an empty net by Mbappe to seal his own treble. There were still 10 minutes remaining as PSG looked to match their record winning margin, and full-back Thomas Meunier got in on the act to make it nine in the 83rd minute. A lack of injury-time was the telling factor in the hosts' failure to reach double figures, as Guingamp desperately clung on to avoid further ignominy. ""We were beaten in all areas of the game,"" bemoaned Guingamp coach Jocelyn Gourvennec. ""We were drowned, we made beginners' mistakes. It was like watching an Under-19s team against a Ligue 1 team."""
362,18/01/2019,10:53,Fabregas braced for home bow as PSG return from the sun,"Cesc Fabregas is set for his home debut as a Monaco player, while Paris Saint-Germain look for revenge against their recent Cup conquerors Guingamp in Ligue 1 on Saturday.","AFP Sport picks out four things to watch in France on a weekend that will be capped by Sunday's derby clash between Saint-Etienne and Lyon. Cesc Fabregas got his first taste of the unusual experience of a matchday in Monaco in midweek, but the Spain star had to watch from the stands as Thierry Henry's side drew 1-1 with Nice, coached by another former Arsenal star in Patrick Vieira. Signed from Chelsea last week, Fabregas impressed on his debut in a 1-1 draw at Marseille, but the 31-year-old was ineligible against Nice, a match that was originally due to be played in December before being postponed. Just hours after admitting to journalists it had been a wrench to leave the Premier League, Fabregas sat next to fellow new signings Naldo, Fode Ballo-Toure and William Vainqueur to watch the Cote d'Azur derby. Now the new signings are available again as Monaco host Strasbourg still searching for a first home win of the season as the relegation-threatened side look to climb the table. ""With the new signings we are going to do some interesting things in the weeks ahead. I am convinced of that,"" said Monaco's French World Cup-winning full-back Djibril Sidibe. PSG have spent the week in Qatar, the land of their owners, a trip set up primarily to keep sponsors happy. Thomas Tuchel's side did squeeze in some warm-weather training, but the capital club were also keen to point out that they became ""the first football club in the world to take part in a traditional camel race"". It remains to be seen whether that will have been the best preparation for a busy spell building up to the trip to Manchester United in the Champions League on February 12. On Saturday, PSG -- still unbeaten in Ligue 1 this season and 13 points clear atop the table -- host bottom-of-the-table Guingamp with revenge on their minds. Guingamp visited the Parc des Princes just last week and won 2-1 in a League Cup quarter-final, inflicting a first domestic Cup defeat on Paris in five years. The derby between Saint-Etienne and Lyon is the most authentic in the French game, and can be one of the most fiery anywhere in Europe. When Lyon won 5-0 in Saint-Etienne last season, a pitch invasion by angry home fans caused a lengthy stoppage before the final five minutes were played out in an almost empty stadium. A repeat of that scoreline seems unlikely this time, but the stakes are high. Les Verts are still unbeaten at home this season and lie third in the table, two points better off than Lyon, who needed a late Nabil Fekir free-kick to draw in Toulouse in midweek. It has turned into a wretched season for Marseille, last year's Europa League runners-up. The southern giants have already been knocked out of both domestic cup competitions and the Europa League, and slumped down into mid-table on a nine-match winless run. The latest setback came in a 2-1 defeat at Saint-Etienne on Wednesday, when Dimitri Payet was left on the bench for the whole 90 minutes. The pressure on coach Rudi Garcia continues to increase ahead of Sunday's game at Caen."
363,14/01/2019,22:45,"At 34, Silva is again dominant in the PSG defence","At 34, veteran centre-back Thiago Silva has re-emerged this season as the pillar of the Paris Saint-Germain defence as the French champions prepare for an assault in Europe.","The PSG captain spoke to AFP in Qatar as his side prepares for a second half of the season in which they will resume their campaign for a long-coveted first Champions League trophy with a last-16 tie against resurgent Manchester United. ""I think I've already enjoyed some good times in my career,"" he said, when asked about his form this season. ""But at this age it is better. You always have quality, and time gives you the experience. When you put the two things together, you go up a level."" Thiago Silva was one of the scapegoats in 2017 when PSG blew a 4-0 first-leg lead in second round against Barcelona, collapsing 6-1 as they conceded three times after the 88th minute. ""I heard a lot of things: 'I'm not a leader, I'm not this or that',"" he said. ""It wounds you, but after that it's also the kind of thing that motivates you the most."" The Brazilian's refound form has come after Thomas Tuchel replaced Unai Emery as coach. ""He's given me the tranquility to play."" ""He tries to solve problems as quickly as possible and he talks to me to discover the best solution,"" he said, adding that Tuchel involves him in decision-making. ""That's something I've never felt before, so I'm giving something extra."" He pointed to a 3-0 victory away to 10-man Amiens in Ligue 1 at the start of December. ""Against Amiens, I played for him,"" he said. ""He suggested that I play just 45 minutes, but at the end of the first half, the score was still 0-0. I could not leave my team in that position just so I could have a rest for upcoming matches. I told him 'I'll play to the end.' When the team needs me, I'm there."" Thiago Silva agreed with suggestions that this might be the strongest PSG team since he arrived in 2012. ""It's not only the players but the way we play,"" he said. ""We're playing more as a team."" Thiago Silva said that Tuchel's direct and open approach to players helped explain the improved productivity of the team in general and Neymar in particular. ""He (Neymar) has understood, as everybody has understood, because these are things that you tell him to his face,"" he said. ""Respect is to say things to your face and the coach does it very well, he is very strong on the technical part but especially on off-field matters, managing those who are not playing. He tries to motivate everyone to be ready. That's the difference."""
364,14/01/2019,17:42,PSG wary of Man Utd's 'energy' ahead of Champions League clash,Paris Saint-Germain stars said Monday the French champions were wary of Manchester United's new-found form as they prepare for their last 16 Champions League clash against the revived Premier League side.,"PSG and United meet first in Manchester on February 12, with the second leg taking place in the French capital on March 6. United beat another Champions League side, Tottenham, at the weekend to record their six successive victory under caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, a run of results that has made PSG sit up and take notice. ""I think after the departure of Jose Mourinho Manchester United has a new energy,"" said striker Edinson Cavani, speaking at French champions' winter training camp in Doha, Qatar. ""They have started to win matches and have more continuity."" He added that three-times winners of the European Cup/Champions League were ""a strong group"". When the draw was made, many made PSG clear favourites to win the tie with an uninspired United well off-the-pace in the Premier League title race. But they are a team transformed since Solskjaer replaced the sacked Jose Mourinho in December, with a revival capped off by this weekend's impressive victory away at Spurs that has them closing in on the European spots after falling way behind. Central to that transformation has been World Cup winner Paul Pogba and his France teammate Kylian Mbappe said United had a ""strong squad"". ""I think Manchester United is always a top side,"" said Mbappe. ""It's not easy to play any team in the Champions League, we are going to do our best."""
365,11/01/2019,12:04,PSG fined by UEFA for crowd trouble,Paris Saint-Germain have escaped with a fine from European football's governing body UEFA following crowd trouble at their Champions League home game against Red Star Belgrade in October.,"The French giants ran the risk of being forced to play their next home European match -- against Manchester United in the Champions League last 16 second leg in March -- behind closed doors. Trouble erupted outside the Parc des Princes after the game, but the only punishment for the crowd disturbances and ""illicit chants"" from their supporters was a fine of 35,000 euros ($40,346). Red Star, who lost the game 6-1, were also fined 25,000 euros for chants from their supporters. Meanwhile, Olympiakos were fined 90,000 euros and handed a suspended one-game stadium ban after their fans set off fireworks and invaded the pitch when the Greek club beat AC Milan 3-1 in the Europa League last month. Milan were fined 5,000 euros, while Ajax were fined 20,000 euros and Bayern Munich 8,000 euros for the throwing of objects and setting off fireworks in their 3-3 Champions League draw in December."
366,10/01/2019,14:32,"No longer invincible, PSG in need of new faces as revived Man Utd loom","Paris Saint-Germain were seen as heavy favourites to beat Manchester United when the sides were drawn together in the last 16 of the Champions League less than a month ago, but fans of the French giants may not be so confident right now.","While United fired Jose Mourinho in the wake of that draw and have since enjoyed a resurgence under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, PSG have stuttered either side of the French winter break. Wednesday's shock 2-1 home defeat against Guingamp in the League Cup quarter-finals does not mean Thomas Tuchel's team are suddenly in crisis, but it has raised certain doubts. Prior to playing Guingamp, who are bottom of Ligue 1, PSG had won an incredible 44 games on the trot in France's two domestic cup competitions stretching back five years. They had won the League Cup five seasons in a row and had not lost a domestic match since Tuchel was appointed in the last close season. However, results have been less impressive in the last two months. They took the lead on Wednesday through Neymar, but Guingamp came back to win with two late penalties -- having earlier missed a spot-kick with the game goalless. ""We played with too much confidence throughout and thought nothing bad could happen,"" said Tuchel. The result is a setback for the German, but nothing more -- PSG won the domestic treble in three of the last four seasons while flattering to deceive in Europe, and Tuchel's main objectives are the league and the Champions League. His side have a month until they face United at Old Trafford in the first leg on February 12. Between now and then, the Qatari-owned club still have at least six games to play, and they appeared a little rusty on Wednesday in part because several key players are only just back from extended winter holidays. ""It was not just a defeat, we have lost an opportunity to win a title,"" said Brazilian defender Marquinhos. ""We will have to sit down and reflect and see what we can do better."" Tuchel, whose team are a mammoth 13 points clear atop Ligue 1, is in no doubt about one thing. The German is convinced the club needs to move into the transfer market this month to strengthen in midfield, where Marco Verratti is currently the only recognisable top-class performer available. With their hands tied due to UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules, PSG did not replace Thiago Motta after his retirement at the end of last season. Tuchel is further hampered by Adrien Rabiot being frozen out by the club over his refusal to sign a new contract. Veteran Lassana Diarra is also likely to leave, and in the meantime defender Marquinhos may continue to be played out of position in the middle of the pitch, as he did successfully in November's 2-1 home win over Liverpool. ""It wasn't necessary to lose this game for us to know that we have needs in the transfer window and a victory would not have changed anything in that regard,"" said Tuchel. On a weekend where some fixtures have been rearranged due to the ongoing ""yellow vest"" protest movement in France, Tuchel's team are at Amiens on Saturday, while the standout Ligue 1 fixture sees crisis-hit Marseille host Monaco. The principality side are fresh from beating Rennes on penalties in the League Cup quarter-finals and coach Thierry Henry is hoping to confirm the signing of Cesc Fabregas in the coming days.

367,09/01/2019,23:39,PSG stunned in League Cup quarters by struggling Guingamp,Paris Saint-Germain saw their 43-match winning run in domestic cup competitions come to an end as Thomas Tuchel's men suffered a shock 2-1 home defeat by Ligue 1 bottom club Guingamp in the French League Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday.,"The visitors were awarded three penalties at the Parc des Princes in a dramatic second half, as PSG failed in their bid for a sixth straight League Cup title. It was only a second defeat in all competitions this season for the capital club, after a 3-2 loss to Liverpool at Anfield in the Champions League last September. Guingamp, who have won just two league games all season, join Monaco, Strasbourg and Bordeaux in the semi-finals. ""We came here to win and we know it's very difficult here,"" said Marcus Thuram, the son of 1998 World Cup winner Lilian Thuram, who scored the winner. ""We know that in the Cup anything can happen... We knew how to hinder PSG."" Neymar broke the deadlock in the 63rd minute after Thuram missed from the spot, but Guingamp rallied, with Thuram's successful injury-time penalty snatching victory with a shootout looming. ""We played with too much confidence, we were not hungry enough to finish the match,"" admitted PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""It's very hard to lose with three penalties. I was angry with the second one, I can see the VAR 100 times, it's not a penalty."" Tuchel named a strong starting XI including Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and Angel Di Maria, but a drab first half in the capital failed to produce a single shot on target from either side. The reigning French champions had extended their cup winning streak at the weekend against fifth-tier Pontivy, but Guingamp were awarded a penalty on the hour mark when Ludovic Blas was tripped by PSG full-back Thomas Meunier. Forward Thuram blazed his effort from 12 yards well over the top of the crossbar, and it appeared as though the opportunity of an upset had passed Guingamp by when Neymar headed home a Meunier cross less than two minutes later. But the away side managed to stay in the game and were handed another penalty nine minutes from time when Marcus Coco was bundled over by Juan Bernat, and Congolese international Yeni Ngbakoto made no mistake after a lengthy VAR delay. With the game set for penalties after 90 minutes, Guingamp landed a decisive blow on the counter-attack, as Thilo Kehrer fouled Thuram, and this time the 21-year-old squeezed the ball under the diving Alphonse Areola in the PSG net. Earlier on Wednesday, Monaco goalkeeper Loic Badiashile scored the winning penalty in a marathon shootout against Rennes. Monaco, runners-up in the past two seasons, salvaged a 1-1 draw after normal time thanks to Rony Lopes' second-half equaliser, before Badiashile's heroics as he also saved three spot-kicks. Thierry Henry's young team are floundering in Ligue 1, sitting second-bottom and five points from safety, but managed to keep their coach's hopes of a first trophy alive at the Stade Louis II. ""That's exactly how we want to play,"" said the former Arsenal and France striker. ""Sometimes we heard the crowd were unhappy, but we got the ball back on the ground and we played. ""Finally we reacted after conceding a goal. Before we didn't know how to do it. This time, we did."" Monaco were the better side for the majority of an uneventful first half, with Moussa Sylla twice going close, but went into the break a goal down after Benjamin Bourigeaud swept Rennes ahead on the half-hour mark after a clever pass from Hatem Ben Arfa. Henry was grateful to have Lopes back in the starting line-up for the first time since September 2 after a thigh injury, and the Portuguese forward tapped in Julien Serrano's low cross to level in the 54th minute. Kamil Glik and new signing Naldo both missed chances to win the tie for Monaco on penalties, but 20-year-old Badiashile slotted home the 22nd spot-kick to send them through after Rennes 'keeper Tomas Koubek had blazed over."

Weah has made eight senior international appearances for the USA, scoring one goal. ""He has a long career ahead of him but he has those natural attributes in terms of his pace and technique. He's hungry too,"" Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers told the club's website. ""He's been in the PSG squad and featured for them in pre-season. With the quality of players they have, it's difficult for him to get in and get any game-time. They wanted him to go out on loan and saw Celtic as a great possibility. ""He has really good qualities technically, and tactically is always improving his game. Physically he's very good, very fast and is a strong player. He'll add competition to the squad."" Rodgers was keen to add more firepower to his squad with Leigh Griffiths sidelined for a prolonged period due to personal problems leaving Odsonne Edouard as the club's only natural senior striker before Weah's arrival. Weah is Celtic's second signing of the January window after also completing a loan deal until the end of the season for West Brom winger Oliver Burke.

Barcelona, who were banned from signing players for a year in 2014 for breaking rules over the international transfer of players aged under 18, have been at pains to point out that they have not signed any deal prior to the transfer window opening on January 1.

FC Barcelona refute the existence of any type of agreement with PSG player Adrien Rabiot."" Rabiot, who has made more than 150 top-flight appearances, has been agitating for a transfer for some time.

""I'm very happy because we can see the progress of the team,"" said Tuchel. ""You can feel the energy, it's a good thing to build on next year."" With Neymar away, Angel Di Maria was in the line-up and came closest to making it 2-0, forcing a fine save from Nantes goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu, who then watched the Argentine hit the crossbar from the rebound. Meanwhile, third-placed Lyon drew 1-1 at fourth-placed Montpellier after opening the scoring thanks to their captain Nabil Fekir before a great header from Ruben Aguilar gave the surprise-package southerners a share of the spoils. Henry's Monaco were dreadful and the former Arsenal striker spat on the ground after Nolan Roux of Guingamp made fools of the Monaco defence to make it 2-0.

""And then Friday night they said it wasn't possible."" The German also sowed further doubt over the future of midfielder Adrien Rabiot, who is out of contract at the end of the season. ""I cannot guarantee that 'Adri' will finish the season with us,"" said Tuchel, adding that the France international ""hasn't said yes to PSG, that's why everything is possible.""

376,12/12/2018,00:48,'Humble' PSG keeping cool heads after making Champions League last 16,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel said his side need to ""stay humble"" after they thumped Red Star Belgrade 4-1 on Tuesday and qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League, finishing ahead of Liverpool and Napoli to top a tight Group C.","First-half goals from Edinson Cavani and Neymar set the French champions on their way, before a bullet header from Marquinhos, Kylian Mbappe's injury-time strike and Liverpool beating Napoli 1-0 ensured first place in the group after Marko Gobeljic pulled one back for the hosts early in the second half. ""We made mistakes, but I really liked the reaction after Belgrade's goal. We controlled the match,"" said Tuchel to RMC Sport after the win. ""We need to stay humble and have a professional attitude. We are improving and we are hard to beat."" PSG finished the group stage on 11 points, two ahead of second-placed Liverpool and Napoli, who were eliminated due to their defeat at Anfield. Topping such a keenly-contested group is a huge boost for PSG, who have dominated French football since being taken over by Qatari investors but flattered to deceive on the continent. Arrival in the knockout stage comes after two straight wins for PSG, with Tuesday's beating of Red Star coming after a crucial 2-1 victory over Liverpool that put qualification in their hands. ""We showed for a second time after the match against Liverpool that we are ready for this kind of match,"" added Tuchel, whose side began the group stage with a 3-2 defeat by the Reds at Anfield and then struggled to contain Napoli in the two draws with the Italian side. However, PSG scored 10 goals in two games against Red Star, who beat Liverpool and drew with Napoli in Belgrade -- dropped points that allowed the Ligue 1 leaders to finish top. ""We are happy, we came for qualification and we showed our intentions (with the win),"" said Mbappe, who also laid on Cavani's opener. Asked about PSG's chances of winning the Champions League, Mbappe added: ""We need to see what we'll have in front of us. The goal is to get to the quarter-finals, but we'll deal with what we are given in the draw."" PSG had Red Star on the back foot from the start, and their blistering attacking trio of Neymar, Mbappe and Cavani did not waste time in putting the away side ahead. Just eight minutes were on the clock when Cavani tapped Mbappe's pass into an open goal, after the French teenage sensation met the excellent Marco Verratti's through ball, brushed Filip Stojkovic aside and slipped a perfect pass for the Uruguayan. Red Star captain Stojkovic had a torrid evening, and Neymar made light work of the 25-year-old on his way to a wonderful solo goal in the 31st minute, dribbling into the box and sitting down the hosts' keeper Milan Borjan before lifting the second into the net. The Ligue 1 leaders should have been out of sight three minutes before the break, but Mbappe wasted an excellent chance to make it three, again bursting through past Stojkovic on the left only to fluff his shot into the side netting. Red Star came out firing in the second half, and could have scored twice before Gobeljic smashed past Gianluigi Buffon in the 56th minute to set the Rajko Mitic stadium ablaze with noise. However Marquinhos snuffed their enthusiasm out when he met Di Maria's beautiful deep free-kick to make sure of the three points with 17 minutes remaining. Mbappe's neat finish as the final seconds ticked away and Liverpool's win were the icing on the cake for PSG. ""We knew it was going to go to the very end ever since the draw,"" said Marquinhos. ""We knew this group was very difficult, so it's great to finish first, it's a good sign for the future."""

In the incident in April 2016, 20 PSG Ultras battled 60 Reims Ultras, exchanging blows and throwing umbrellas, chairs and pool cues. Mabille, who was also fined 800 euros and banned from carrying a weapon and entering the department of Aube for two years, denied the charges, claiming he was shopping at the time of the fight. Thirteen PSG ultras received sentences last month of up to ten months in prison for the same fight. The CUP was set up in early 2016 with the stated objective of advocating the non-violence of PSG supporters in stadiums."

The world's most expensive player came off early in the second half of a 2-2 draw at Bordeaux on December 2 after hurting the same groin he injured playing for Brazil against Cameroon in November. The Brazilian could line up alongside France World Cup winner Kylian Mbappe to form a potent PSG attack. Mbappe praised Neymar's ability in the pre-match press conference. ""It's a massive advantage for us, we'll see on Tuesday all the quality he has,"" he said. ""He'll be there and he'll prove his quality by helping us win."" The Parisians need a victory in Serbia on Tuesday if they are to guarantee a place in the last 16. Red Star are yet to lose and have not conceded a single goal in the group stage of the Champions League at the Rajko Mitic Stadium. Despite an unbeaten start to their Ligue 1 campaign, Tuesday's visitors have drawn two successive games but their fixture against Montpellier scheduled for Saturday was postponed due to policing issues in France. Tuchel highlighted Red Star's impressive form at the ground nicknamed the 'Marakana'. ""It's a big challenge to win here, it's not easy. It's not our job to think about who has done what here, we have the chance on Tuesday to decide how we do,"" he said. ""We will respect the atmosphere, Red Star's quality and we need a big performance,"" the 45-year-old added. Liverpool face Napoli in the other Group C fixture with the Reds needing to clinch all three points at Anfield to have any chance of advancing. The Serbians can qualify for the last 32 of the second-tier Europa League if they overcome PSG and Jurgen Klopp's side lose to the Italians."
380,08/12/2018,14:46,PSG 'vehemently deny' plan to sell Mbappe,French champions Paris Saint-Germain have quashed reports the club could be forced to sell either Kylian Mbappe or Neymar in a bid to circumvent eventual Financial Fair Play (FFP) sanctions.,"Qatar-owned PSG are one of a number of clubs under scrutiny from UEFA's FFP regulations after splashing a combined total of more than 400 million euros in 2017 for Brazil star Neymar and World Cup winner Mbappe. Rival clubs and even the president of Spain's La Liga championship, Javier Tebas, bemoan the lack of sanctions for PSG, who according to recent leaked documents have violated the strict financial regulations put in place by European football's ruling body. UEFA still have their eye on PSG and their finances and daily sports newspaper L'Equipe claimed late on Friday that any future sanctions could see the club sell one of their most coveted stars. But PSG were quick to shoot down the report. ""In an article published on their website on Friday night, L'Equipe dared to say that 'PSG is ready to lose Kylian Mbappe or Neymar Jr to avoid (FFP) sanctions',"" said a statement issued by the club. PSG ""vehemently denies these totally false and ridiculous allegations, which serve only to recreate a climate of tension between the club and this media outlet."" The front page of L'Equipe on Saturday carried pictures of both Mbappe, the 19-year-old who struck in a 4-2 World Cup final win over Croatia last summer, and Brazil star Neymar while page two claimed the club are ""ready to lose a star"". UEFA's FFP rules mean clubs are forbidden from spending more money than they generate. UEFA's auditors opened an investigation into PSG in September 2017 following the purchase of Neymar from Barcelona and Mbappe from Monaco earlier that summer. The case was shelved in June 2018, before being reopened in September 2018. PSG reacted by appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), claiming it has met UEFA's FFP demands. A UEFA spokesman said last month: ""We will have to wait for CAS's decision on PSG's appeal before looking at this issue."""
381,07/12/2018,12:55,PSG to snatch Ajax star De Jong from Man City in record 75m euro deal: report,"Paris Saint-Germain could pip Manchester City to the signing of Ajax and Netherlands midfield star Frenkie de Jong in a record 75 million euro deal, a Dutch newspaper report said Friday.","""It is almost certain that De Jong, 21, will exchange Ajax for Paris Saint-Germain,"" popular tabloid De Telegraaf said. If the deal goes through, it will be ""the most expensive and sensational in the history of the Eredivisie and Ajax in particular,"" the newspaper added. PSG's move to secure the talented midfielder, who made his debut for Ajax two years ago, comes after a lightning intervention from the club's technical directors Maxwell and Antero Henrique. Top PSG officials met De Jong's agent Ali Dursun on Thursday and, later, Ajax management at the Johan Cruijff ArenA, De Telegraaf said. Talks between Ajax and Manchester City are believed to have reached an advanced stage after De Jong spent several hours talking to City manager Pep Guardiola. But the English champions ""wanted to do business at a later stage and PSG was lightning-quick to jump on the opportunity,"" claimed the report. ""The dark blue jersey of France's upcoming champions PSG, not the light blue one of Manchester City, will almost certainly become De Jong's next summer,"" the paper said. Ajax confirmed to the Dutch daily that talks with PSG have been held, although the club added ""there was no definitive agreement... other clubs have also shown interest"". The highest outgoing transfer amount paid so far in the Dutch top flight was last year when Colombian centre-back Davinson Sanchez moved from Ajax to Tottenham Hotspur for 40 million euros (45.5m $US). In 2015 Memphis Depay moved from PSV to Manchester United for 34 million euros (38.6 $US)."
382,06/12/2018,00:25,Cavani rescues PSG in Strasbourg stalemate,Edinson Cavani saved a point for Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday as the Ligue 1 leaders slipped for the second time in a week with a hugely entertaining 1-1 draw at Strasbourg.,"The Uruguayan striker fired home a 71st-minute penalty to maintain PSG's unbeaten record after 16 games despite a disjointed performance without injured star attacker Neymar, equalising Kenny Lala's own spot-kick four minutes before the break for the spirited hosts, who came close to inflicting their opponents first league defeat of the season. ""If you arrive in flip flops against PSG, you go home with a good spanking,"" said Strasbourg coach Thierry Laurey. ""We suffered at times but we managed to minimise their offensive power. They dominated the play but we were never in too much danger."" Thomas Tuchel's side, who also drew at Bordeaux at the weekend and started without Kylian Mbappe and Thiago Silva, remain way ahead of the rest after a night in France full of late goals, incident and VAR. Champions PSG are 14 points ahead of Lille, who moved second on Tuesday after beating Montpellier 1-0 and stayed there thanks to Hatem Ben Arfa and Jordan Siebatcheu leading Rennes to a 2-0 win at Lyon on Wednesday. Bruno Genesio's Lyon are fourth, 15 points behind PSG, while inconsistent Marseille are a further two points back after a 3-2 defeat at Nantes. PSG now don't play until they travel to Serbia for their Champions League clash at Red Star Belgrade, where a win will ensure their progress to the last 16, after Saturday's match with Montpellier was postponed because of security concerns. ""We reacted and showed a lot of quality in the second half. We completely controlled play in the opposing half and had both a lot of possession and dangerous situations,"" said Tuchel. ""We played very well in the second half, showed quality but could not score."" The video assistant referees were involved in a series of key decisions on Wednesday, and it was VAR that helped Strasbourg take the lead over PSG, with referee Antony Gautier awarding Lala's spot kick a full four minutes after Thilo Kehrer handled Lionel Carole's fizzing cross. The half-time deficit led Tuchel to bring Mbappe off the bench, and it was France's World Cup star who won the penalty that Cavani blasted past Matz Sels, Lala hacking the 19-year-old superstar down in the box. PSG looked a different proposition to the sluggish team that slogged through the opening period, and Kehrer thought he had made amends for giving away the opening penalty six minutes after the break, only to see his header saved at point-blank range by Sels. However as the half wore on the away side ran out of ideas and Strasbourg made a push for the win in the final minutes. Substitute Adrien Thomasson forced a superb stop from Alphonse Areola with a minute left, and the 24-year-old thought he had snatched a famous win deep in injury time when he headed home Youssouf Fofana's pinpoint cross. However while the majority of the crowd celebrated wildly, the linesman's flag was rightly raised to rule the unfortunate Thomasson's goal out for offside. Chief among the other crucials decisions helped by VAR on a dramatic night was Loick Landre's 96th-minute winner for Nimes at Caen, which came after Prince Oniangue had levelled at 1-1 in the 90th minute and was eventually given after Landre was found to be onside. VAR also came to Bordeaux's assistance by awarding the penalty slotted home by Francois Kamano as they followed up on drawing with PSG at the weekend with a last gasp 3-2 win over Champions League-chasing Saint-Etienne at the Matmut Atlantique. Pablo bagged the points in the final minute, and Bordeaux's opening goal came at a cost to Neven Subotic, who was stretchered off with blood pouring down his face after being clattered by his own goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier just before Jimmy Briand scuffed in. Dijon sank rock-bottom Guingamp further into the relegation mire thanks to Oussama Haddadi scoring four minutes in time to hand the hosts a 2-1 win."
383,04/12/2018,15:08,Injured Neymar to miss PSG's midweek Strasbourg clash,Paris Saint-Germain will be without the injured Neymar as they look to continue their unbeaten record in Ligue 1 this season on Wednesday's trip to Strasbourg.,"The world's most expensive player came off early in the second half in Sunday's 2-2 draw at Bordeaux after hurting the same groin he injured playing for Brazil against Cameroon last month. Neymar had earlier put PSG in front but the reigning champions ended up seeing their perfect domestic record this season come to an end after 14 straight wins. ""With 'Ney' it is almost the same thing but not too serious,"" coach Thomas Tuchel said at a press conference on Tuesday. ""He can't play against Strasbourg but after that it is the same as after the international break -- he rested against Toulouse but played against Liverpool."" Neymar has scored 15 goals this season and his performance in last week's Champions League win over Liverpool was one of his best since moving to Paris from Barcelona last year. Without him Edinson Cavani will hope to return to the starting line-up after being left on the bench in Bordeaux, as PSG seek revenge for a 2-1 defeat at Strasbourg last season. After Wednesday's match against a Strasbourg side who ended the weekend in eighth place, PSG will have a free weekend before their crucial Champions League trip to Red Star Belgrade. They had been due to host Montpellier on Saturday, but that game has been postponed following a request from Paris police, probably due to concerns about a repeat of last weekend's violence in the French capital amid demonstrations against planned fuel tax increases. PSG need to win in Belgrade to be certain of qualifying for the last 16 of the Champions League for the seventh straight season, but Tuchel said he was unsure if the postponement would help his side. ""Honestly I don't know if it's good or not. I am not thinking too much about it, but for me it is absolutely clear, security has to come first,"" said the German, who will also be without Lassana Diarra in Strasbourg due to a knee problem. ""It is a new situation for us but one that we need to deal with. That is our challenge now, to find a good training plan to get us ready for Belgrade."" PSG's dominance is such that they are already 14 points clear at the top of the table from Montpellier, who host fourth-placed Lille on Tuesday. Third-placed Lyon are at home to Rennes on Wednesday aiming to extend a nine-game unbeaten run in all competitions that included a rousing performance in drawing with Manchester City in the Champions League last midweek. Rennes come into the match in turmoil after suspending coach Sabri Lamouchi on Monday in the wake of a 4-1 home defeat against Strasbourg. The move means the former France midfielder will almost certainly not return, and reserve team coach Julian Stephan will take interim charge. With just one win in nine games since the appointment of Thierry Henry as coach, relegation-threatened Monaco are at Amiens on Tuesday. The principality side are without as many as 14 players due to injuries and suspensions. ""I have never in my career seen half a squad out injured. It is unusual and it complicates things for us,"" said goalkeeper Diego Benaglio. Midweek fixtures (kick-offs 1800GMT unless stated):"
384,04/12/2018,13:59,Paris police force postponement of PSG game,"Paris Saint-Germain's home Ligue 1 game against Montpellier on Saturday has been postponed after a request from police in the French capital, the club said on Tuesday.","The match was due to be played at 4:00 pm (1500 GMT) at the Parc des Princes. No reason was given for the postponement but it is likely to be down to security concerns. Paris has been the scene of protests for three weekends running from ""yellow vest"" demonstrators unhappy at planned fuel tax rises. Demonstrations turned particularly violent last Saturday, with 412 people arrested after the worst clashes in central Paris for decades. However, the French government backed down on Tuesday, with Prime Minister Edouard Philippe saying the planned increases in the price of fuel would be suspended for six months. PSG are 14 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 after seeing their perfect record this season ended in a 2-2 draw at Bordeaux on Sunday. They play Strasbourg away on Wednesday, but the postponement of Saturday's game gives them extra time to prepare for next week's crucial Champions League trip to Red Star Belgrade. ""Honestly I don't know if it's good or not,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel when asked if the postponement would benefit his side. ""For me it is absolutely clear, security has to come first."""
385,02/12/2018,23:52,Neymar injury concern after Bordeaux end PSG's flawless run,Paris Saint-Germain are again sweating on Neymar's fitness on Sunday after the superstar attacker left the field at Bordeaux clutching his groin before Andreas Cornelius' late header ended the French champions perfect start to the Ligue 1 season.,"Brazilian Neymar was substituted 57 minutes into the hugely entertaining 2-2 draw the Matmut Atlantique stadium, in which he had opened the scoring and had looked in great form before having to head to the dressing room with what looks to be an injury to the same adductor muscle that nearly stopped him from scoring the decisive goal in Wednesday's huge 2-1 win over Liverpool. ""I don't know at all (what his injury is). We have to be careful, he said it was not a problem to play tonight but the pitch was hard and I hope he will be in good shape after Strasbourg,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel, referring to his side's must-win final Champions League group game at Red Star Belgrade in nine days' time. The Ligue 1 leaders, who had won all 14 of their league matches going into Sunday's pulsating clash, had to wait until the last minute to see if Neymar and strike partner Kylian Mbappe would be ready for the win over the Reds, who now face an uphill battle for qualification to the Champions League last 16 thanks to Neymar's first-half winner last week. The pair twice put PSG in front on Sunday, but Jimmy Briand and Cornelius ensured that Bordeaux became the first French team to stop the runaway leaders this season. However the result is unlikely to slow down PSG's march to the title, as they still stand 14 points ahead of nearest challengers Montpellier, who took advantage of Lyon drawing 2-2 at Lille to sneak into second with a 2-1 win at Thierry Henry's struggling Monaco on Saturday. PSG's arch rivals Marseille failed to make the most of their fellow Champions League chasers dropping points after a goalless draw at Reims on Sunday. Rudi Garcia's side stay fifth. Meanwhile mid-table Toulouse drew 2-2 with with fellow relegation rivals Dijon and Strasbourg routed Rennes 4-1. Neymar's opener for PSG came after a spell of concerted Bordeaux pressure and at the end of a superb exchange with countryman Dani Alves, who on his first start of the season flashed in a powerful cross that was crashed home first-time by number 10. His 11th league goal of the season took some time to be awarded however, as the VAR dithered over whether Mbappe was offside and interfering with the play as he flashed a leg at Neymar's shot. That goal looked to have broken Bordeaux, and Angel Di Maria, who had fluffed a golden chance laid on for him by Neymar earlier in the half, then struck the post in first-half stoppage time as the home side rocked under pressure. However the hosts fought back again after the break, and they got their first reward when Briand slotted home a fine cross from the lively Yann Karamoah. Neymar was substituted shortly afterwards and Bordeaux smelled blood, but Mbappe turned the match in PSG's favour, latching on to Julian Draxler's through ball before crashing home what looked to be the winner and almost immediately asking to be substituted with an apparent muscle problem. Tuchel didn't remove the 19-year-old however, and he was there to see Cornelius meet Maxime Poundje's cross with such force that PSG keeper Alphonse Areola couldn't stop his header from crossing the line and ending PSG's 100 percent start."
386,29/11/2018,12:40,Neymar steps up as Tuchel gets it right with PSG,"Paris Saint-Germain had been waiting for such a performance from Neymar, and the Brazilian more than delivered in Wednesday's Champions League victory over Liverpool.","The world's most expensive player scored what proved to be the winning goal as PSG beat last season's runners-up 2-1 to step back from the brink of an unthinkable group-stage exit. His 14th goal of the season came at the end of a move he had initiated with his blinding pace. Neymar celebrated by performing a dance by the corner flag with Kylian Mbappe and posing for the cameras. But Neymar's evening was about so much more than that. Shortly after Juan Bernat's opening goal, Neymar rushed across to the touchline in front of the dugout to make a challenge and then waved his arms in a frenzy to whip up the crowd. He spent much of the second half running his socks off to help PSG defend their lead, and he also upset Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp for being supposedly ""clever"" in winning fouls and buying time. ""For us it was all or nothing. We suffered quite a bit but we are relieved that we won, played well and showed the strength of our squad,"" Neymar said. ""We need to celebrate that. After the game we were shouting, jumping around, dancing, so we are happy."" PSG could have been eliminated with a defeat, but are now above Liverpool in Group C and head to Red Star Belgrade in their final game in a fortnight with qualification for the last 16 in their hands. It was a big night personally for Neymar, in PSG's most important Champions League game since the last 16, second leg against Real Madrid last season, which the Brazilian missed due to injury. This was probably the French club's most significant result in the competition since they beat Barcelona 4-0 in the last 16 two seasons ago. Neymar was far from the only man responsible. There were big performances throughout, with Marco Verratti impressive in midfield, even if he was lucky not to be sent off for a dangerous tackle on Joe Gomez in the first half. Thiago Silva towered over everyone in central defence, the 34-year-old Brazilian living up to his nickname of ""The Monster"" by helping shut out Liverpool's front three of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane. Yet it was telling that Silva was so keen to praise his coach at the end of the game, as he described Thomas Tuchel as ""fantastic"". The German has won all 14 games in Ligue 1 this season since being appointed, but he desperately needed a signature European performance. Tuchel made some big decisions, none more so than selecting defender Marquinhos in midfield rather than Adrien Rabiot. Marquinhos was particularly impressive, playing in a holding midfield role without the ball and dropping into a three-man defence in possession. Tuchel therefore won the tactical battle against his compatriot Klopp and crucially seems to have won over his players. ""The attitude was extraordinary. I am very proud that all the supporters in the ground saw the efforts of a team,"" said Tuchel. The question now is whether this result can act as a trigger for PSG to go on to the latter stages of the competition. ""I hope so. It is very important to go through this experience together to create a special atmosphere for the weeks ahead,"" Tuchel added."
387,28/11/2018,00:26,"Liverpool braced for fit Neymar, Mbappe in crunch clash with PSG","Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is relishing trying to stop a fit Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, with Paris Saint-Germain's superstar duo having shaken off injuries in time for Wednesday's potentially decisive Champions League showdown.","The two most expensive players in the world had been fitness worries for the match at the Parc des Princes after hurting themselves on international duty last week. Both watched PSG's weekend win against Toulouse from the stands, but coach Thomas Tuchel declared them fit to face the English side. ""I am actually pleased for them that they are not seriously injured. That could have happened -- we always expected them to play,"" Klopp said at Tuesday's eve-of-game press conference. Neymar set up Mbappe for one of PSG's goals at Anfield in September, but Liverpool won that game 3-2. Klopp's side therefore have the upper hand coming to the French capital, where they must again be prepared to handle a duo with 26 goals between them this season. ""It's much more difficult to prepare for a game when my players don't know the opponents, which happens from time to time,"" Klopp remarked. ""This generation of players have watched probably 500,000 YouTube videos of Mbappe and Neymar and (Edinson) Cavani and all that stuff. They know more about these players in that respect than I do, but they can only shine when they get the ball, so that means we have to defend, close the spaces."" Liverpool and Napoli are level atop a very tight Group C, a point ahead of PSG. That means a win for last season's runners-up coupled with a victory for Napoli against Red Star Belgrade will take those teams through, condemning PSG to a group-stage exit. However, Liverpool's recent away record in Europe is a concern -- they have lost their last four Champions League games away from Anfield -- despite them still being unbeaten in the Premier League this season. ""We brought Belgrade back in the group, and so we go for everything and that is how football should be,"" said Klopp, who said Sadio Mane was fit to play, while Adam Lallana and Dominic Solanke are out. PSG are enjoying a record-breaking season in France, having won all 14 games in Ligue 1, but they have not managed to take that form into Europe. ""You have to think about how to defend, how to play football ourselves. That is the most important thing, and probably the thing Paris are not used to that much in the league because they are so dominant,"" Klopp said. Tuchel followed Klopp as coach at Borussia Dortmund before moving to France. Despite his outstanding start domestically, he knows the importance of progressing in the Champions League for the Qatar-owned club. ""I feel the pressure, of course. I feel that in every special match and this is clearly a special match,"" said Tuchel, tipped to start Brazilian centre-back Marquinhos in midfield. Tuchel also dismisses fears that his team struggle to adapt to the step-up in Europe because Ligue 1 is too easy for them. ""It cannot be a matter that we win too much, that it is too easy for us. That would mean someone else is responsible. It's not like this -- we are responsible. We can't have anyone to blame but us tomorrow,"" he insisted. A premature exit from the competition would raise questions about the whole PSG project at a time when they are under pressure to comply with UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations. But Tuchel wants his players to relax. ""We cannot control the result, nobody can in football, and for that, no matter what the result is, the sun will shine the next day again and we will have to get up out of bed and go to work, whether in a better mood or a not so good mood."""
388,27/11/2018,20:38,PSG lay claim to title of world's 'hottest club',"Paris Saint-Germain may still be playing catch-up with Europe's traditional giants on the field, but they claim to have already become ""the hottest club in the world"".","That is the boast made by Russell Stopford, the 47-year-old Englishman who joined the club last year as their Chief Digital Officer, having previously worked at Manchester City and Barcelona. In an age where clubs seem to be as keen to grow their brand and increase their digital fanbase as they are to win trophies and generate income, there is no doubt that PSG have been transformed this decade under Qatari ownership. PSG have more than 62 million followers across the major social media networks of Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube. That leaves them a long way behind the very biggest names on the continent -- Real Madrid and Barcelona each have well over 100 million fans on Facebook alone. PSG, the reigning French champions, had four consecutive runs to the quarter-finals of the Champions League before losing in the last 16 in each of the last two seasons, to Barcelona and then Real Madrid. However, a defeat against Liverpool on Wednesday could even condemn PSG to a group-stage exit this season, which would be disastrous for a club who spent more than 400 million euros ($451.6m) to sign Brazilian star Neymar and prolific teenage striker Kylian Mbappe last year. Liverpool -- last season's runners-up -- carry an aura having lifted the European Cup five times and been English champions 18 times since being founded in 1892. In contrast, PSG were only founded in 1970. Yet they seem to be adapting better to the demands of the digital age -- Liverpool's social media followers lag behind their opponents at under 55 million. ""Social media is a new phenomenon and the hottest club in the world is Paris Saint-Germain. That's why we are growing so far,"" Stopford told AFP. PSG have Twitter feeds in seven languages, including English, Arabic and Portuguese, but also Indonesian. ""When we create contents in these different languages, it gives the opportunity to connect directly with our fanbase,"" says Stopford. ""It is also bringing the fans closer to the club, so they can feel part of Paris Saint-Germain."" Stopford has a team of 30 people working for him, and the club says it has increased followers in countries like Indonesia and Algeria than in France."

They are fine. They did a full training session today and yesterday. There is no problem, they will start tomorrow,"" Tuchel said at a press conference at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday. ""If they were not fit they could not play but they did not complain at all yesterday and today, and for me right now there is no risk."" The two most expensive players in the world came off injured playing for their countries in international friendly matches last week, with Mbappe hurting a shoulder with France and Neymar a groin with Brazil. Both players have scored 13 goals in all competitions this season, and the injuries caused alarm bells to ring at PSG as they watched Saturday's tight Ligue 1 win against Toulouse from the stands. PSG come into Wednesday's game in third place in Champions League Group C, a point behind both Liverpool and Napoli with two games left. That means a defeat against last season's runners-up, coupled with a win for Napoli at home to Red Star Belgrade, and the French champions would be eliminated already from a competition they are desperate to win. ""It is super important that we do no lose focus and think about what could happen,"" said Tuchel, who has won all 14 Ligue 1 games in charge since being appointed at the Qatar-owned club in the close season. ""We have to play this game relaxed, but at the same time 100 percent focused on what we have to do. ""We cannot control the result, nobody can in football, and for that, no matter what the result is, the sun will shine the next day again and we will have to get up out of bed and go to work, whether in a better mood or a not so good mood. ""It is sport, and we are looking forward to this challenge."""
390,25/11/2018,12:56,Neymar and Mbappe could be fit to face Liverpool,Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel said his two star forwards in Neymar and Kylian Mbappe could be fit to face Liverpool in the Champions League.,"The pair were injured on international duty and missed PSG's 1-0 league victory over Toulouse but Tuchel said Saturday that he is hopeful they can both feature in what could prove to be a must-win tie for the French club against the Reds on Wednesday. ""They're getting better every day, we have time before now and Wednesday. It's good for us. I think they'll be able to play,"" the German told television programme Telefoot on TF1. PSG are on five points four rounds and mid-week wins for Jurgen Klopp's side and second-placed Napoli would knock the French champions out at the group stage for the first since they made their return to Europe's elite competition in 2012."
391,25/11/2018,00:02,Henry gets first Monaco win as PSG tighten grip on Ligue 1,Radamel Falcao secured Thierry Henry his first win as Monaco boss with a free-kick that would have made his manager proud as Paris Saint-Germain warmed up for Liverpool's visit by strengthening their hold on Ligue 1 with a routine win over Toulouse without Neymar and Kylian Mbappe.,"The Colombian striker struck with a dipping set-piece nine minutes after the break, and Henry could be seen smiling on the touchline as his players celebrated Falcao's winner wildly. ""I'm happy for the team, all the fans, we needed that, even if it was not a match for the purists,"" said Monaco coach Henry afterwards. ""Style is important, in general, but... we can think about style later."" Falcao's fifth league goal of the campaign secured Monaco's first win in any competition since the opening day of the league season, a miserable run of form that has left them second-bottom in Ligue 1 despite Saturday's win. The victory came seven games into Henry's reign at Monaco, where a host of injuries has further complicated an already difficult start to his tenure. ""This is only the beginning, there are still a lot of matches and battles to come. I happy for the team, for the hard work they put in that for a while was not rewarded."" Earlier on Saturday Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani saved a disjointed performance from runaway leaders PSG to maintain their 100 percent start to the season ahead of the crunch Champions League clash with Liverpool on Wednesday. Neymar and Mbappe were both injured during friendlies in the international break, and PSG are sweating on their recovery for the huge Group C clash with the Parisians just a point behind the Reds and Napoli and gunning to qualify from the competition's tightest group. Shorn of their two stars, PSG dominated possession but struggled to create chances against 15th-placed Toulouse. However coach Thomas Tuchel said that he was ""optimistic"" that the pair could return for the match at the Parc des Princes. ""I am more optimistic (than on Friday) because both did individual training today,"" said Tuchel after his team's win. ""I hope they will be able to train with the whole team on Monday."" Cavani ensured that their domestic dominance was consolidated when he expertly controlled a ninth-minute knockdown after a period of scrappy play, then spun Toulouse defender Kelvin Amian with a neat flick before firing home the winner. His goal put PSG a full 15 points ahead of second placed Lyon, who prevailed in a tight derby with Saint-Etienne on Friday night thanks to Jason Denayer's second half header. On Sunday Lille can take back second place from Lyon with a win over Nice, while local rivals Montpellier and Marseille continue their battle for the Champions League places. Rudi Garcia's Marseille are sixth but would overtake Saint-Etienne should they beat lowly Amiens, while their fellow southern club Montpellier take on Rennes knowing a win would take them second should Lille stumble at Nice."

And Mbappe has a shoulder contusion after falling heavily in France's 1-0 win over Uruguay at the Stade de France. ""A 48-hour period of treatment will be undertaken to assess their clinical evolution,"" PSG said. It appears likely that both players will miss PSG's Ligue 1 match against Toulouse on Saturday, but their real target will be Wednesday's Champions League match against Liverpool at the Parc des Princes. All four sides could still qualify for the knockout phase from Group C. Liverpool have the same number of points as leaders Napoli while PSG sit third, one point behind Liverpool and one point ahead of Red Star Belgrade. Neymar played down his injury, saying in an Instagram message that ""it was nothing serious"". In Tuesday's match, the Brazilian forward had treatment for an apparent groin problem after just five minutes and collapsed to the turf soon afterwards to boos from the crowd in the central English town of Milton Keynes. Brazil team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar also said on Tuesday the 222-million-euro ($253-million) player did not appear to have a serious problem. ""He felt discomfort,"" Lasmar said. ""He will need a bit more time to evaluate it and take a scan, but in principle it is not a serious injury."" In Paris, Mbappe hurt his right shoulder as he challenged Uruguay goalkeeper Martin Campana for the ball in the World Cup winners' victory. France coach Didier Deschamps said Mbappe, the 19-year-old forward who shot to global prominence at the World Cup, ""had some shoulder pain after his fall"". Neymar's replacement in the Brazilian lineup, Everton's Richarlison, headed in on the stroke of half-time to secure victory for the Selecao. France won thanks to Olivier Giroud's 52nd-minute penalty."

395,14/11/2018,15:02,PSG face fresh Financial Fair Play allegations,UEFA said Wednesday that further examination of French giants Paris Saint-Germain's alleged flaunting of Financial Fair Play rules would have to await a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.,"In the latest revelation from Football Leaks, French sports daily L'Equipe said UEFA was considering ordering PSG to amend its accounts to drastically re-assess the value of its sponsorship contract with the Qatar Tourism Authority (QTA). The Qatari-owned club originally declared the contract to be worth 100 million euros in the financial years of 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. L'Equipe said UEFA's financial oversight body was now insisting that sum be reduced to 58 million euros. The effect of the change would be to plunge the French champions heavily into deficit, meaning they could fall foul of UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. That would leave PSG facing UEFA penalties, including a possible ban from the Champions League and other European competitions. Under FFP rules, clubs cannot spend more than they earn in any given season and deficits must fall within a 30-million-euro limit over three seasons. In September, UEFA announced it was re-opening its investigation into accusations that PSG had broken the FFP rules. PSG, which spent 400 million euros on signing Brazilian star Neymar and French teenager Kylian Mbappe, reacted by lodging an appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. A UEFA spokesman said Wednesday: ""We will have to wait for CAS's decision on PSG's appeal before looking at this issue."" Concerning the allegations in L'Equipe, UEFA said: ""We do not comment on specific cases."" In the wake of the Football Leaks revelations, UEFA warned Monday it might re-open probes into the finances of other clubs, including Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City."

The revelations prompted the French champions to launch an immediate investigation. PSG's general manager Jean-Claude Blanc acknowledged that the practice which is illegal in France did take place but he blamed the scandal on a ""handful of individuals"" acting on their own. Deschamps gave a forthright response when tackled on the affair at a training camp for France's Nations League game against the Netherlands on Friday. ""I'll keep this short, they are simply unacceptable and intolerable actions,"" the France boss said. Mediapart, citing the latest series of Football Leaks documents, said that between 2013 and this year, PSG's scouting department filled in recruitment forms on potential youth signings that included a section on ethnicity.

399,12/11/2018,00:10,Cavani bags hat-trick as perfect PSG leave Henry's Monaco down and out,Thierry Henry's disastrous start as coach of Monaco continued on Sunday as Edinson Cavani's VAR-assisted hat-trick helped Paris Saint-Germain to an easy 4-0 win in the principality that saw them extend their perfect record in Ligue 1 this season.,"Neymar netted a penalty to complete PSG's victory, as they made it 13 wins from 13 league games under Thomas Tuchel, further stretching their start to the season that is a record in France and in Europe's so-called big five leagues. The result for them came after a week marred by revelations from French investigative website Mediapart that youth scouts at PSG had subjected potential signings to racial profiling over several years. But while they go 13 points clear of second-placed Lille at the Ligue 1 summit, the club who have been their main challengers in recent seasons continued their deeply worrying slump, with Henry again left to look on helplessly from the touchline. Champions in 2017, Monaco are in the relegation zone and five points away from outright safety having failed to win in six matches in all competitions since the Arsenal and France great took charge. They have now gone 16 games without a win altogether, with this result following a 4-0 home reverse against Club Brugge which knocked them out of the Champions League. Monaco are on their worst run in France's top flight in 32 years, at a time when Football Leaks claims about their Financial Fair Play breaches and the arrest of their Russian billionaire owner Dmitry Rybolovlev on corruption charges have cast a further shadow over the club. ""We are playing for survival, nothing else,"" said Henry, who has picked up a squad cursed by injuries. Here he was missing a dozen players due either to injury or suspension at kick-off, while both Belgian international Nacer Chadli and his replacement Jordi Mboula had to come off hurt. ""We lost two more players tonight, so it is starting to become a lot,"" he said, adding: ""I am staying positive because even with all that we managed to create chances against PSG."" The average age of his bench here was under 19, while his starting line-up featured a 17-year-old debutant in defence in Benoit Badiashile. It was little wonder that PSG -- themselves showing six changes following their Champions League draw at Napoli -- found the going so easy. They went ahead in the fourth minute when Neymar drove the ball across goal for Cavani to convert. The goal was initially disallowed before being given by the Video Assistant Referee, and the same thing happened in the 11th minute when Cavani turned the ball in again after the flag was wrongly raised for an offside against Moussa Diaby. In contrast to those two goals, a fine Julian Draxler finish in first-half stoppage time was initially given before being disallowed on review. However, Diaby squared for Cavani to complete his hat-trick in the 54th minute, and Neymar then rolled in a penalty after Kylian Mbappe had been fouled by France teammate Djibril Sidibe. ""I am very satisfied with the result, and with the fact we showed the hunger to win a 13th straight game. That is extraordinary,"" said Tuchel. ""Monaco and Henry are in a very difficult situation with lots of players out injured. This wasn't the night for Monaco to challenge us. They can do that if they have all their players back but not today."" Elsewhere on Sunday, Lucas Ocampos and Adil Rami scored as Marseille bounced back from a run of four straight defeats to beat Dijon 2-0 on an emotional afternoon at the Velodrome. A minute's silence was held before kick-off in memory of the eight people killed when two buildings collapsed in the southern French city on Monday. The result lifted Marseille up to sixth, back to within three points of third-placed Montpellier, who beat them 3-0 last weekend. Bordeaux were held to a goalless draw by Caen, while Rennes drew 1-1 with local rivals Nantes."

The odds are massively stacked against his injury-depleted side ending that wait on Sunday. Monaco have lost their last seven meetings with PSG -- including a 7-1 thrashing in the last league clash in April. Meanwhile, PSG are off to a record-setting start with 12 successive wins, the best-ever start to any of Europe's so-called big five leagues -- Spain, England, Italy, Germany and France. ""We need to try and get back on the right track. I hope we'll find the solution to stopping Paris,"" said Henry, albeit admitting ""the worst is possible"". ""We're trying to do everything to regain a sense of calm but if you don't win it's difficult,"" he added. ""We lost another player to injury in (Kamil) Glik. That's not going to help matters as we already had 10 or 11 injured players. I have to be positive, otherwise what can you do?"" Henry received the backing of France boss and former team-mate Didier Deschamps, Monaco's coach when they reached the 2004 Champions League final, who believes the 41-year-old can excel in management. ""He is starting in a tough and difficult situation,"" said Deschamps. ""He's just beginning but he has all the abilities to become a very good coach."" PSG will look to put a turbulent week off the pitch to one side. The club has come under scrutiny following Football Leaks revelations about their breaches of Financial Fair Play regulations, while a probe is underway into claims that young players were subject to racial profiling by talent scouts. Monaco owner Dmitry Rybolovlev also made the headlines on Wednesday after the Russian billionaire was charged with influence peddling and bribery in connection with a fraud case involving a Swiss art dealer. With PSG a staggering 11 points clear already, Montpellier hope to maintain their surprise push as the best of the rest away to Angers on Saturday. ""We've got to maintain the spirit we've shown since the start of the season, but in football everything's fragile and can change quickly. We can't get carried away,"" said coach Michel Der Zakarian. Lille, who are level on points with Montpellier in third, have brought in Nicolas Anelka as an academy coach to train the club's apprentice strikers. ""Nicolas is really enthusiastic. He wants to stay out of the spotlight and bring some of his striking expertise and know-how to our young players,"" said Lille boss Christophe Galtier, whose side host Strasbourg on Friday. Fourth-placed Lyon travel to Guingamp, the only club below Monaco at the foot of the table. Guingamp are set to reappoint Jocelyn Gourvennec, the man who led them to the French Cup title in 2014, on a two-year deal next week after sacking Antoine Kombouare. Marseille face a partial close of their south stand after fans threw missiles and set off flares during their 2-0 defeat to PSG on October 28. They host Dijon on Sunday. The sale of Bordeaux to US investment fund GACP was completed on Tuesday. New owner Joe DaGrosa is planning to invest 80 million euros ($91 million) over the next two seasons and said there is ""no limit"" to their ambitions.

401,08/11/2018,13:18,PSG open probe into claims of racial profiling of young players - source,"Paris Saint-Germain have opened a probe into claims that young players were subject to racial profiling during their recruitment process, a source close to the club said on Thursday.","""We have opened an internal investigation,"" the source told AFP, after the claims made by French investigative website Mediapart, who cited documents from the latest series of Football Leaks allegations. According to Mediapart, between 2013 and the spring of this year, PSG's scouting department filled in evaluation forms on young players that included stating their ethnicity. Their origin was to be described as French, North African, West Indian or African. Such social profiling is illegal in France. The source acknowledged the existence of these forms to AFP. Mediapart, part of the European Investigative Collaborations consortium which has studied the Football Leaks documents, said the forms were used to evaluate potential young signings. The controversy ""blew up internally"" in March 2014, said Mediapart, in relation to the case of a talented 13-year-old player called Yann Gboho, who caught the eye of scouts while he was playing for FC Rouen in the Normandy region of northern France. A PSG scout who evaluated the teenager in November 2013 stated his origin as ""West Indian"". The evaluation form has a box on ethnicity with a drop-down menu offering the four choices of French, North African, West Indian and African, Mediapart said. The investigative website quoted Serge Fournier, the PSG scout who evaluated Gboho, as saying ""instead of French, it should have said white, especially as all the players we recommended were French."" ""PSG didn't want us to recruit players born in Africa, because you are never sure of their date of birth,"" he was quoted as saying. The player in question -- a French youth international who was born in the Ivory Coast -- eventually signed for rival Ligue 1 club Rennes. The matter ""caused a swirl within PSG"", said Mediapart, with Football Leaks citing the minutes from a meeting on March 14, 2014. At the meeting, Marc Westerloppe, in charge of scouting in France outwith the Paris region at the time, is alleged to have spoken of ""a problem with the direction the club is going in. We need more diversity. There are too many West Indians and Africans in Paris."" The alleged comments caused upset, with Mediapart saying Pierre Reynaud -- in charge of youth recruitment in the Paris region -- saying ""it must not be a question of ethnicity but of talent"". Complaints were then made to the HR department at the club, and Mediapart say Westerloppe was summoned to a meeting in June 2014 in which he rejected the accusations against him as ""false, malicious and stupid"". He was not punished by the club, the website says. Westerloppe and Olivier Letang -- then the sporting director at PSG and now the president at Rennes -- responded to Mediapart by saying ""this affair concerns PSG"". PSG charged Malek Boutih -- an anti-racism campaigner and former politician -- with the task of responding to Mediapart's questions about the claims. ""The club confirms that this profiling was put in place, but...they say that things were done in secret"" and that ""management was not aware"". However, Mediapart said that these same forms continued to be ""scrupulously filled in up until the spring of 2018"". The allegations trigger memories of a scandal that erupted earlier this decade, after Mediapart exposed a discussion in 2010 on race quotas in France's age-group teams. According to Mediapart, those at the top of French football believed there were ""too many blacks and too many Arabs and not enough whites"" in the game."
402,08/11/2018,00:38,Five things we learned from the Champions League,"Under-fire Jose Mourinho and Manchester United revelled in an incredible smash and grab victory at Juventus, while Real Madrid continue their revival and Cristiano Ronaldo watches on as his magnificent volley counts for nothing.","AFP Sport looks at five things we learned in the Champions League this week: Under pressure following a series of dismal performances, Manchester United Jose Mourinho pulled off a hugely important 2-1 away victory at Juventus reminiscent of his past as the ""Special One"" that gives United a huge boost ahead of the Manchester derby at the weekend. The Portuguese was in his element winning at the home of his former fierce Serie A rivals, charging onto the pitch to taunt the home fans in Turin by cupping his ear as United players and supporters celebrated a win gained by Mourinho's decisions from the bench. He brought on Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini with 11 minutes left and United deservedly behind to a Cristiano Ronaldo wonder goal, and both were instrumental in the turnaround, Mata whipping home the equaliser and Fellaini flicking on a cross that Leonardo Bonucci eventually nodded into his own net. The 55-year-old could do with some more of that golden touch at the weekend. Having reached two of the last four finals, Juventus looked like genuine challengers for their first Champions League in over two decades when Ronaldo lashed home his 65th-minute volley. Juve looked set to win Group H with two games to spare when Ronaldo rifled in Leonardo Bonucci's magnificent long pass just at it dropped over his shoulder, giving the Serie A leaders a thoroughly deserved lead. However despite their impressive winning record Juventus have shown weakness this season. They almost let United back into it at Old Trafford after switching off and this time they were punished for missing gilt-edge chances by a cynical away side. Juve are still odds on to qualify for the knockout stages but if Massimiliano Allegri is to bring the club their third European Cup he will have to make sure they can keep up their impressive displays for the full 90 minutes. In a full-blown crisis under previous coach Julen Lopetegui, Real Madrid look a new side under caretaker manager Santiago Solari. The European champions' third win in three matches since Solari took charge was a 5-0 hammering of Viktoria Plzen. The Czechs were not the strongest opposition but Wednesday night's display was Madrid at their swaggering best. Real are set to qualify from Group G alongside Roma and a continuing of this form will put the rest of the competition on red alert. After years in the doldrums Italian clubs other than Juventus are starting to make a mark on the competition and going toe-to-toe again with the world's best. Napoli, who have mostly failed to transfer their recent domestic revival to the European stage, were unlucky to not have won at least one of their two clashes with megabucks PSG and on Tuesday gave as good as they got in their 1-1 draw with Thomas Tuchel's side. Inter Milan were dominated by Barcelona and saved from defeat by an inspired performance from goalkeeper Samir Handanovic and a poacher's finish from striker Mauro Icardi, who snatched a late draw that makes Luciano Spalletti's side favourites to qualify ahead of Tottenham Hotspur. Roma meanwhile are keeping pace with Real Madrid in Group G thanks to a hard-fought 2-1 win at CSKA Moscow, Eusebio Di Francesco's side performing better in Europe than in Serie A. Crushing everything that moves in Ligue 1, Paris Saint-Germain can't seem to establish themselves as a European powerhouse. PSG are third in Group C after their battling 1-1 draw with Napoli in the Stadio San Paolo cauldron, and while they are only one point behind leaders Liverpool, Tuchel's side have only managed to beat Red Star Belgrade in four matches. The French champions' Qatari owners have spent huge sums in order to try to barge their way into the European elite, but have so far failed to convince away from the relative safety of Ligue 1."

404,06/11/2018,23:57,Insigne beats Buffon as Napoli hold PSG,Lorenzo Insigne beat former Italy teammate Gianluigi Buffon from the spot to keep Napoli well in the hunt for a place in the last 16 of the Champions League thanks to a 1-1 draw at home to Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday.,"PSG travelled to the Stadio San Paolo looking to go one better after being held to a 2-2 draw in the French capital two weeks ago. But after Juan Bernat capped a dominant first-half performance from PSG to hit the opener on the stroke of half-time, Insigne made no mistake when the hosts were awarded a penalty just after the hour as Jose Callejon was sandwiched in the area. The result sees Napoli go top of Group C, level on points with Liverpool following their shock 2-0 defeat by Red Star Belgrade earlier Tuesday. But in comments to Sky Sport, coach Carlo Ancelotti warned qualification is not secure yet. ""We'll have to battle until the very end, we're holding on tight,"" said Ancelotti. PSG sit third, only one point adrift, leaving Buffon with plenty of belief in their last-16 chances. ""Paris played a great game, it was a solid performance and I'm happy because I think we're on the right road,"" Buffon told RMC Sport. ""Red Star did both us and Napoli a big favour earlier but there's everything to play for in the final matches. ""But I'm confident because we're improving and each draw for us sends an important message."" In what was captain Marek Hamsik's record 512th appearance for Napoli, former teammate Edinson Cavani played only a cameo role after replacing Angel Di Maria for the final quarter-hour. It left Neymar and Kylian Mbappe pulling the strings up front for the visitors, who produced a strong first 45 minutes that had Napoli's demanding fans frustrated throughout. The first real scare for Napoli came on 23 minutes when Mbappe ran on to Neymar's looping cross to fire a left-footed half volley that dipped just over David Ospina's crossbar. After Mertens poked wide of Buffon's upright after a well-worked free-kick, Kalidou Koulibaly rescued the Italians twice in succession with a well-timed tackle on Mbappe and a timely interception to prevent Mbappe reaching Thomas Meunier's pass. At the other end, Callejon set up Insigne for a deft volley which the diminutive Napoli midfielder fired a yard wide of Buffon's upright. But Napoli's fans were in despair moments later courtesy of more Mbappe magic. The World Cup star's pace carried him on to a cross down the left and he bamboozled Raul Albiol before sending a deft cutback into the path of Bernat. The Spaniard took a touch and, as he fell to the turf, swiped with his right foot to stun Ospina. A half-time pep talk by Ancelotti appeared to have had the desired effect when a far more enterprising Napoli emerged after the interval, with the 40-year-old Buffon rolling back the years with some fine saves. The former World Cup winner first stretched to palm Nikola Maksimovic's angled effort to safety before guiding Mertens' lobbed effort over the bar moments later. Napoli should have scored when acrobatic control by Mertens set up Callejon to the right of Buffon's goal, but the Spaniard bundled wide. As PSG panicked at the back, Buffon palmed Callejon's close-range cross into the path of Mertens only for the Belgian to fire over from two yards out. Napoli fans were further frustrated when former Juventus legend Buffon stood his ground to parry Fabian Ruiz's first-timer following Mertens' cross. Buffon was finally beaten, but only from the spot, by Insigne's 62nd-minute penalty. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel introduced Cavani for the final 14 minutes while Mertens, holding an injured arm, was replaced by Adam Ounas. The much-needed boost in attack failed to materialise for PSG, who five minutes from time saw Mbappe somehow sweep his strike from Thilo Kehrer's delivery wide of Ospina's upright when eight yards from goal."
405,02/11/2018,23:47,"Mbappe, Neymar steer PSG to new win record on troubled day",Kylian Mbappe and Neymar scored late goals to give Paris Saint-Germain a 2-1 win over nearest challengers Lille on Friday as the French champions extended to 12 games their perfect start to the season at the end of a troubled day for the club.,"The Qatari-owned club were forced to release a statement shortly before kick-off to deny allegations made by a Football Leaks investigation that they had worked with UEFA to cover up breaches of their Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. However Mbappe restored smiles at the Parc des Princes with a magnificent strike from just outside the box 20 minutes from time, and Neymar gave PSG a two-goal buffer before Nicolas Pepe pulled one back for the away side from the penalty spot. PSG extend their lead at the top of Ligue 1 to 11 points after a 12th straight league win that means they have now beaten Tottenham Hotspur's old record for consecutive wins at the start of a season. Spurs emerged victorious from their opening 11 matches in their double-winning 1960-61 season, a performance that had stood since as a record in Europe's so-called big five leagues -- Spain, England, Italy, Germany and France. The result is a boost for PSG ahead of their crucial Champions League trip to Italy to face Napoli next Tuesday, when a defeat could leave Thomas Tuchel's side on the brink of an early exit. ""We deserved the result and the win record. Ligue 1 is not that easy. It is down to our hard work. We give everything on the field,"" skipper Thiago Silva told Canal Plus. Mbappe was back in the PSG starting line-up after being left on the bench against Marseille last weekend for arriving late for the pre-game team talk, only to come on and score the opener in a 2-0 win. Marco Verratti also started, despite PSG confirming earlier on Friday that the Italian had been caught drink driving overnight Tuesday to Wednesday on the ring road around the French capital. ""He told me before training on Wednesday. It was on Tuesday night, it is not possible to do that two days before a match. It is not good what he did but it is something for the club to sort out,"" Tuchel said, adding that Verratti was ""lucky"" the incident did not happen closer to the game. PSG needed to put the off-field noise behind them but also try to break down a Lille side enjoying their best start to a season in 66 years. Christophe Galtier's side have been excellent in this campaign, but their lively attack did not give Gianluigi Buffon much to worry about on his return to the PSG line-up. With Edinson Cavani not involved as he struggles to shake off a thigh injury, Mbappe and Neymar were the biggest threats to Lille throughout, after arriving at the stadium disguised as characters from the Netflix show Money Heist. Neymar almost scored direct from a corner five minutes before half-time, with Lille goalkeeper Mike Maignan doing well to get his body in the way of the ball and divert it onto the woodwork. Mbappe had a shot deflected just wide as PSG stepped up the pressure after the break, and it was the 19-year-old who broke the deadlock in the 70th minute, beating Maignan after Neymar's pass was kindly deflected into his path by Jose Fonte. That was his 11th goal in eight Ligue 1 games since winning the World Cup with France, and Neymar then got his ninth in the league this season to seal the win. The Brazilian played a one-two with Mbappe before firing home from 18 yards with six minutes left, before Lille reduced the arrears in stoppage time, Pepe converting a penalty awarded for a Thilo Kehrer handball. Montpellier can leapfrog Lille and go second if they beat Marseille on Sunday."
406,02/11/2018,20:04,"UEFA, PSG, Man City targeted in Football Leaks revelations","UEFA helped Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City get around their own Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, according to a Football Leaks investigation published on Friday.","According to the investigation of ""more than 70 million documents"" analysed ""over eight months by 80 journalists"" from members of European Investigative Collaborations (EIC), UEFA ""knowingly helped the clubs to cover up their own irregularities for 'political reasons'"" under the leadership of Michel Platini and Gianni Infantino. Both clubs, owned and bankrolled by wealth from Qatar and Abu Dhabi respectively, have avoided the most severe FFP punishment of being excluded from the UEFA Champions League. Football Leaks claims that between them Qatar and Abu Dhabi have injected some 4.5 billion euros ($5.1 billion) over the last seven years to increase the budgets of the clubs they own. Of that figure, 2.7 billion euros has been invested in City via their Abu-Dhabi owners and from allegedly ""overestimated"" sponsorship deals. Football Leaks also points the finger at PSG's five-year agreement with the Qatar Tourism Authority (QTA), valued at 1.075 billion euros, or 215 million euros a year. That is despite the investigation claiming that ""two independent auditors assigned by UEFA valued the contract at... 123,000 euros per year for one, and 2.8 million euros a year for the other"". UEFA rules say clubs cannot spend more than they earn in any given season and deficits must fall within a 30 million-euro limit over three seasons. Both PSG and City were fined 60 million euros by UEFA in May 2014, but both were told they would get 40 million euros back if they stuck to the terms of their settlement. French investigative website Mediapart claims Infantino -- the current FIFA president who was then UEFA's general secretary -- ""directly negotiated an agreement with Manchester City"", bypassing the Financial Control Panel of European football's governing body. His proposal was for a ""fine of 20 million euros instead of 60."" Reputedly included in copy in emails sent by Infantino to City's chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak was former French president and PSG fan Nicolas Sarkozy, who also reputedly helped City's Abu Dhabi owners in their attempts to get around FFP rules. Sarkozy's press officer responded to Mediapart by saying that ""as a lawyer, Nicolas Sarkozy provided no counsel to the people you mention"". Asked for a reaction by Mediapart, City said ""the attempt to damage the reputation of the club is organised and clear."" Late Friday, FIFA blasted the claims as an attempt to ""undermine the leadership"" of the global body. ""It seems obvious from the 'reporting' carried out in some media outlets that there is only one particular aim -- an attempt to undermine the new leadership of FIFA and, in particular, the President, Gianni Infantino, and the Secretary General, Fatma Samoura."" Infantino added in a statement: ""It is always a challenge to change things, to move forward, and to bring people together in order to do things better. ""And, as we are resolutely implementing the reforms at FIFA, it was always clear to me that I would face strong opposition, especially from those who cannot anymore shamelessly profit from the system they were part of."" PSG said in a statement that they have ""always strictly complied with all applicable laws and regulations and firmly denies the allegations published today by Mediapart"". The club's delegate director general Jean-Claude Blanc later told AFP that ""there was no secret agreement with UEFA, everything was done with the most complete transparency."" PSG have been the subject of another UEFA investigation since they signed Neymar from Barcelona for a world-record 222 million euros ($264 million) in August 2017. In late September UEFA said it had referred the accusations against the Paris club to its financial unit ""for further investigation"". PSG's case, though, is complicated by their sponsorship deals with the Qatar National Bank as well as the QTA. UEFA indicated that the aim of FFP rules was ""to help clubs become viable financially...and to punish them only as a last resort."" Infantino meanwhile defended himself by saying it was possible for the independent body in charge of investigating FFP breaches to be helped by ""the administration of UEFA, which of course includes the secretary general"". Infantino is now at the head of FIFA, and Football Leaks also shone a light on his relationship with a Swiss prosecutor called Rinaldo Arnold. The investigation said ""invitations"" were given to Arnold for World Cup and Champions League matches and a FIFA Congress in 2016, while Infantino was provided with details of ongoing investigations. ""According to FIFA's internal directives and regulations, the President and the Secretary General are entitled to invite a number of guests to FIFA tournaments and events,"" the world football's governing body told AFP. adc-yk-pgr-as/td/dj"

""To achieve certain successes we need a path, a project, a management and a team that have known each other for a long time,"" Buffon said in an interview with Sky Sport Italia. ""PSG have been renewed in recent years and need time."" Buffon said Lionel Messi's Barcelona and Juventus, who bought Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo last summer, were the favourites. ""In the Champions League there are two or three favourites -- Barcelona, because they have the first or occasionally the second (best) player in the world. ""Then there is Juventus, who in recent years have consolidated at these levels and taken the other player who is considered the first and sometimes the second in the world. ""There are outsiders like the (Manchester) City... who have a coach and a team that make them one of the potential winners."" Qatar-owned PSG are third in Group C with four points, behind Liverpool (six) and Napoli (five), and will be battling for a win to salvage their flagging European campaign. ""It will be a delicate match against a very high level opponent,"" he said. ""The arrival of (Carlo) Ancelotti means this team now has a certain awareness that it's not certain they would have had before."" Buffon added it had been tough watching the first three games from the sidelines. ""I watched on TV in the dressing room, not being able to participate makes me suffer."" He said he still did not understand why he had been sent off by English referee Michael Oliver. His suspension followed a post-match rant in which he said the referee had a ""rubbish bin"" where his heart should be. ""I really was in a foul temper and the Gigi from Carrara (his hometown in Tuscany) came out,"" said Buffon, who added he would laugh off the incident if he met Oliver again. ""I would joke, because irony is the best way to break down walls and immediately create empathy."""

""It's an objective that the club discussed with me before I signed the contract,"" he said ahead of Tuesday's Champions League Group C clash in Naples. ""It is in my head. It flows through my veins. I want to win it because that is the job that was presented to me when I came (to PSG)."" PSG's domination of Ligue 1 -- they have won five of the past six championship titles -- allows them to prepare well for their ultimate goal of winning Europe's premier club competition. But the Champions League has produced nothing but heartbreak for PSG and their Qatari owners, who have plunged millions in the club in the hope of creating one of the continent's top sides. PSG's hopes ended at the quarter-finals four years in succession from 2013-2016, and at the last 16 in the past two campaigns. Coach Unai Emery was fired last summer and left for Arsenal after failing to bring the trophy to Paris and new coach Thomas Tuchel has inherited the task of realising the dream. Tuchel has brought the emphasis on teamwork to PSG's training ground, said Cavani. ""He has a wonderful mentality and likes to win with a strong team structure,"" said the 31-year-old, voted PSG player of the year in 2017. ""He wants everyone to play together and that is what is important for me."" Cavani cited Atletico Madrid and Juventus as clubs who play together with the kind of robust, disciplined teamwork that Tuchel is trying to instil into PSG. ""That does not mean that we (PSG) do not work together,"" said Cavani, whose star has declined since fellow strikers Neymar, the world's most expensive player, and teenage sensation Mbappe joined him in attack. But Cavani denied there was friction. ""We are a work in progress,"" he said. ""That does not mean I don't get on with Neymar or Mbappe. I hope that work with the new coach can give the perfect structure to produce a big season -- all together."" After defeat at Liverpool and being held 2-2 by Napoli last time out, a win at the San Paolo stadium will be crucial if PSG are to make it past the group stages. But before facing his former club, Cavani said: ""It will be good match to show that we have moved up to a higher level, and that we are able to deal with this kind of pressure -- because if we lose, that will make it tough for us to get out of the group stage."" Appearing in Monaco to receive the Golden Foot award for oustanding athletic ability and personality, Cavani told AFP he had shrugged off a recent thigh injury and expected to play in PSG's home league match against Lille on Friday. PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon has been confirmed as starting against Lille, who sit eight points behind in second place with Montpellier, who host Marseille in Sunday's late game, three points further behind in third. With a record-equalling 11 opening wins this season, another victory would see PSG overtake Tottenham (1960-61) and become the sole record holders for the most consecutive opening league wins. Lyon occupy the fourth and last qualifying spot for the Champions League but are 13 points adrift of PSG before hosting Bordeaux in Saturday's early game."

The 40-year-old World Cup winner was suspended for PSG's opening three Champions League group games. But he is set to replace Areola in Friday's league fixture with Lille and again in Naples on Tuesday when PSG will be battling for a win to salvage their flagging Champions League campaign. ""He plays a very important role for us because he's a legend,"" Tuchel said. ""He's had a great career and has a lot of experience. He's crucial for us thanks to his approach to the game. ""It's very important that he's here and that he speaks to everyone to share his experience."" PSG have won their opening 11 matches in Ligue 1 and sit top with an eight-point lead on second-placed Lille, whom they host on Friday. But the Parisians realistically need a win in Naples on Tuesday if they are to save a flagging European campaign beset by defeat at Liverpool and a 2-2 draw with Napoli in the French capital."

""I have loved the last three years in Paris where I have everything I need to play my best football"" Di Maria said in a statement. ""Every day I feel honoured and motivated to be a part of such an ambitious project - unique in Europe. Along with my teammates, we have a lot more great things to achieve and we will continue to help PSG grow as a big club internationally,"" he added.

He moved to Manchester United in 2014 and then PSG. He has scored 57 goals and made 58 assists in 150 games for the French club.

411,30/10/2018,22:04,"'If you cheat, you have to be thrown out' - La Liga chief steps up pressure on PSG","The president of Spain's La Liga, Javier Tebas, has stepped up his criticism of Paris Saint-Germain as he pushed UEFA to kick teams out of the Champions League for breaching their Financial Fair Play rules.","UEFA opened an investigation into the Qatari-owned club's spending in September 2017 under pressure from some of Europe's footballing elite after they signed Neymar from Barcelona for a world-record 222 million euros ($264 million). They then completed a deal to sign Kylian Mbappe from Monaco for 180 million euros just a few weeks later, and Tebas has been especially vocal in his criticism of PSG's finances, while also targeting Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City. ""UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules say that when you cheat with your budgets, you have to be thrown out of the competition,"" Tebas said Tuesday during an interview in Paris with several media, including AFP. PSG have never been barred from playing in the Champions League, although in late September UEFA said it had referred the accusations against the French giants to its financial unit ""for further investigation"". UEFA rules mandate that clubs cannot spend more than they earn in any given season and deficits must fall within a 30-million-euro limit over three seasons. PSG's case, though, is complicated by lucrative sponsorship deals with the Qatar National Bank and the Gulf state's tourism authority. Tebas claims his faith in UEFA and FFP is wavering. ""I am sceptical. I have to have confidence just now. When this whole process ends, ask me again,"" said the 56-year-old. Tebas has ignored the pleas of PSG president Nasser Al Khelaifi to stop his public criticism of the French champions and claims he is not simply trying to protect the interests of Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona. Both clubs, along with other traditional European giants, have been threatened by the emergence of PSG and City with their mega-rich Gulf owners. ""I want football to be economically balanced, so that there are no devious methods to becoming big, because this places football's economic structure in danger,"" he said. ""In this case I am defending the interests of professional football in Europe. ""UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules are there to be obeyed. We also denounced Manchester City and we are studying other clubs in Europe, not just PSG. The thing is that PSG have been the most blatant."" He blames the two clubs for the continuing inflation of wages and transfer fees, with PSG's deal for Neymar more than double the world record at the time -- Manchester United bought Paul Pogba from Juventus for 105 million euros a year earlier. ""If players' salaries and transfer fees go up because television rights have gone up, through money that has come into football, that is normal. ""Inflation is bad when the money doesn't come from football, but from gas or oil."" Meanwhile, Tebas says he is prepared to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) if his plans to stage a match in the United States are blocked. ""We will go to the CAS or the competent courts. We think we have the right legally and ethically,"" he said. His response came after FIFA president Gianni Infantino confirmed last week that world football's governing body is opposed to La Liga's plans to take the league game between Barcelona and Girona to Miami on January 26. ""Why can the NBA take official matches out of the USA, and go and play in London, and we cannot? ""We are talking about one match with the strategic motive of trying to grow and improve La Liga's brand."""
412,29/10/2018,15:09,Tuchel shows a different side as dropped Mbappe plays role of super sub,Thomas Tuchel's position of strength in charge of Paris Saint-Germain was reinforced on Sunday after the German's decision to leave Kylian Mbappe on the bench against bitter rivals Marseille paid off.,"The teenage France World Cup star was omitted from PSG's starting line-up for disciplinary reasons but came on as a second-half substitute and within three minutes of his introduction had scored the opening goal. PSG went on to win 2-0 in 'Le Classique' at the Velodrome, with Julian Draxler scoring in stoppage time to secure the points. The result stretched their unbeaten run in French football's biggest fixture to 18 games in all competitions going back seven years. ""It was a surprise for us too but it was a disciplinary issue,"" said Tuchel, who also raised eyebrows by leaving out midfielder Adrien Rabiot. ""We decided before the match in the hotel that they would not start. It was a shame because I don't like to play without Kylian and Adrien, but it was necessary."" Broadcaster Canal Plus said the decision was taken because Mbappe and Rabiot arrived late for the pre-match team talk, and the intimation was that it was not the first time the duo had been guilty. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, the giant Cameroon striker who was a surprise summer signing, was given a first start up front in Mbappe's absence. But he made way for Mbappe in the 62nd minute and the opening goal came just three minutes later. It may have appeared a brave call, especially with the likes of Thiago Silva and Edinson Cavani missing through injury. However, it was a clear sign of the German's authority, a different side of his management, notable at PSG so far for granting extra holidays and showing affection to his players. In contrast, his predecessor Unai Emery struggled to stamp his mark on the dressing room following the arrivals of Neymar and Mbappe at the beginning of last season for the two largest transfer fees in history. ""I don't know if I want to comment,"" said Tuchel when asked about the reasons for dropping one of his biggest stars. ""These are internal matters. It was a very difficult decision to take before a match like this. ""We have reasons but I don't particularly want to explain them. For me, it's fine, it's finished."" He added: ""I hate playing without Kylian and Adrien. We had plans prepared for several days and that we had to change. I don't like that."" While Mbappe spent part of the warm-up before the game listening intently to words of advice from veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, Rabiot did not come out to warm up. It was Draxler who replaced Rabiot, a player who previously refused to accept a berth on France's standby list for the World Cup after being left out of their main squad. While they remain in a delicate position in the Champions League, PSG have won all 11 Ligue 1 games this season under Tuchel, who was appointed in the summer to succeed Emery. French media have been keen to highlight that PSG's record equals the best start to a season in any of Europe's so-called big five leagues, established by the double-winning Tottenham Hotspur team of 1960-61. If they win at home to second-placed Lille on Friday, they will be 11 points clear already at the top of the table. It is little wonder that former Borussia Dortmund boss Tuchel has so much credit in the bank just now, although an early elimination in Europe would raise questions. ""The coach showed that the club is more important than any individuals,"" was how Draxler put it after the game."
413,27/10/2018,11:02,PSG coach Tuchel states need for new faces amid European struggles,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel has admitted that signing a top-class midfielder remains ""a priority"" for the French giants after their weaknesses were exposed in another below-par performance in the Champions League.","PSG snatched a 2-2 draw at home against Napoli in midweek thanks to Angel di Maria's injury-time goal, but before that they were outmuscled in the centre of the pitch. Tuchel's team also disappointed in a 3-2 defeat at Liverpool last month, and their hopes of reaching the knockout rounds are in the balance. Those games have exposed a lack of strength in depth in midfield, with PSG missing out on targets such as Fabinho and Axel Witsel in the recent past -- that duo ended up joining Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund respectively. At times this season, Brazilian defender Marquinhos been used in midfield, where PSG's only specialists are Adrien Rabiot and Marco Verratti. But PSG have been hamstrung by UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations ever since spending more than 400 million euros ($457m) on Neymar and Kylian Mbappe last year. ""Yes it is a priority. It was a priority and it still is because it is dangerous to always use Adri and Marco,"" said Tuchel on Saturday. ""It is too much at this level. We need a third top-level player to be able to play a 4-3-3. ""You can only play what you have. I am still convinced Marquinhos can play a big, big role for us."" Speaking ahead of Sunday's game away to bitter rivals Marseille, Tuchel added: ""We are still building, we are still in progress, still on our way up. I truly believe that, I can see a lot of good things in our game."" In contrast to their difficulties in Europe, PSG are utterly dominant in France. The reigning champions have established a new French record by winning their opening 10 Ligue 1 games this season and are hoping to extend that further when they go to the Velodrome. Marseille come into the game on the back of a 3-1 defeat against Lazio in the Europa League, hardly ideal preparation for the biggest match in French football. ""For me it's not so important what Marseille played so far because tomorrow will be different for them,"" said Tuchel. ""We have a lot of respect for the quality they have. They are used to playing big matches. They have a lot of individual quality and with their supporters in that kind of stadium, anything can happen."" There will be a crowd of over 60,000 at the Velodrome for the fixture, usually dubbed 'Le Clasico' in French in a nod to the Spanish game between Real Madrid and Barcelona, which will also be played on Sunday. ""Games like this are like an overload of emotions. We need to be very calm and focus on our qualities and objectives,"" added Tuchel, who will be without injured captain Thiago Silva. ""We have a long, long series of victories and a big, big chance to make it 11, and to make it 11 in Marseille is one of the biggest challenges you can have in France."""
414,26/10/2018,13:01,"Chastened by Champions League woes, PSG head to old foe Marseille",Paris Saint-Germain's deepening Champions League woes have turned the focus back to the strength of competition -- or lack of it -- in the French top flight as they prepare to face bitter rivals Marseille this weekend.,"On Wednesday, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe were shut out and PSG needed a brilliant injury-time goal from Angel di Maria to salvage a 2-2 draw at home to Napoli. Thomas Tuchel's side now face a real fight just to qualify for the Champions League knockout rounds, having already been beaten at Liverpool. After disappointing last-16 exits against Barcelona and Real Madrid in the last two seasons, Tuchel is tasked with finally making the Qatar-owned club a genuine contender in the Champions League. It is therefore galling for those in charge in the French capital to find themselves at risk of an early exit. ""I knew it was perhaps the most difficult group we have had in my time here,"" said midfielder Marco Verratti after Wednesday's game. ""Now we need to go and get a great result in Naples, and then everything will be decided at home against Liverpool. I still think we can qualify."" Tuchel admitted Paris have to improve, but weaknesses in his team were badly exposed by Napoli. Yet at the same time PSG go to Marseille having won all 10 games in Ligue 1 this season, smashing the previous French record of eight straight victories at the start of a campaign, set by Olympique Lillois in 1936. Another three points on Sunday and PSG will match Tottenham Hotspur's achievement of 11 successive wins at the start of the 1960-61 season, a record in Europe's big five leagues. Tuchel's team are already eight points clear of Lille atop the table, and 11 points above Marseille in fourth. A sixth title in seven seasons seems inevitable even now. That should not be a huge surprise, given that PSG's operating budget -- a reported 500 million euros ($568m) -- is almost double that of France's next richest club, Lyon. When PSG played Lyon earlier this month, they won 5-0, and perhaps the lack of a proper challenger domestically removes some sharpness from their game in Europe. Nobody said that of Monaco when they reached the semi-finals of the Champions League in 2017, of course. Nevertheless, the results of French teams in Europe this season have led to much soul-searching. Europa League finalists last season, Marseille are already staring at an early exit from the competition after losing 3-1 to Lazio on Thursday, not ideal preparation for the meeting with PSG at the Velodrome. Marseille, the only French team to have won the Champions League, despise the club from the capital, and the clash between the country's two biggest sides is a major event in France. However, seven years and 17 games have passed since Marseille last beat PSG. Second-placed Lille host Caen on Saturday, while Thierry Henry makes his home debut as Monaco coach against Dijon. The former Arsenal and France star lost 2-1 at Strasbourg in his first match in charge last weekend. His depleted team then drew 1-1 with Club Brugge in Belgium in the Champions League, and Monaco have now gone 12 games without winning. ""I know every little corner of the stadium and lots of memories will come back,"" said Henry of returning to the Stade Louis II, where he began his playing career. ""I am not looking for excuses but starting with two matches away from home was not the best way to reassure ourselves. ""Monaco are not used to being in this situation. We have several players who played for struggling teams last season and we need their experience."""
415,23/10/2018,19:22,PSG captain Silva to miss Champions League clash with Napoli,Paris Saint-Germain captain Thiago Silva has confirmed that he will miss his team's Champions League home clash with Napoli on Wednesday.,"""Unfortunately I will not be on the field. These are things that happen in our profession. But I have confidence in my team,"" Silva wrote on his Instagram account. The 34-year-old Brazilian centre-back had already missed PSG's 5-0 win over Amiens in Ligue 1 at the weekend with a reported achilles problem. Coach Thomas Tuchel admitted at a press conference earlier that Silva did not train on Tuesday morning and that it would be ""very difficult"" for his captain to feature. Tuchel was nevertheless confident that Italian playmaker Marco Verratti would be able to play in the game after coming off at half-time at the weekend with a slight muscle problem. Napoli sit on top of Champions League Group C with four points after beating Liverpool 1-0 in their last outing. PSG and Liverpool each sit a point behind Carlo Ancelotti's side after two matches. Liverpool host Red Star Belgrade at Anfield on Wednesday."
416,22/10/2018,00:06,Vieira's Nice continue to struggle with Marseille loss,Patrick Vieira's Nice slumped to a fourth defeat in five home league games this season as Morgan Sanson's first-half strike fired Marseille to a 1-0 win in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"It was a laboured performance from Nice, who sit 14th in the table and only two points above the relegation play-off spot, eight points adrift of fourth-placed Marseille. Vieira may need a good run of results if he is to keep his job long enough to take on former Arsenal and France teammate Thierry Henry when his side visit Monaco on December 8. ""Unfortunately, tonight's match reflects our other home games,"" said Vieira. ""(Forwards) Allan (Saint-Maximin), Mario (Balotelli) and Myziane (Maolida) have not been successful. In the last 30 metres there has been a lack of quality, we haven't always made the right choices."" For Marseille, all eyes will now be on next Sunday's clash with arch rivals and runaway league leaders Paris Saint-Germain at the Velodrome. The hosts went into the match having mustered only seven goals in nine league games this season, and Vieira responded by handing Mario Balotelli just his third start of the campaign up front. The first decent chance at the Allianz Riviera fell to the Italy international, but after latching onto a long ball forward from Dante his well-struck volley was kept out by the legs of Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda. A clever dummy from Balotelli created space for Allan Saint-Maximin, but his shot was tame and easily gathered by Mandanda. The away side grabbed the lead in the 42nd minute, though, as full-back Bouna Sarr skipped clear down the right-hand side and crossed for Sanson to smartly turn and fire into the bottom corner. Nice plugged away in search of an equaliser but never looked like having the quality to break through, with centre-back Dante's looping volley onto the roof of the net the best effort Vieira's men could muster. Balotelli, who was strongly linked with Marseille during the close-season before opting to stay at Nice, has failed to score this term after netting 43 goals over the last two campaigns. ""Mario? He was just like the team -- very good in the first half, then he wasn't as good. He still has to work,"" said Vieira. Earlier on Sunday, Montpellier moved into third as goals from Gaetan Laborde and Andy Delort sealed a 2-0 win over Bordeaux, while Saint-Etienne drew 1-1 against Rennes. Henry suffered a miserable return to French football on Saturday as Monaco lost at Strasbourg in his first match as a head coach, while PSG thrashed Amiens to make it 10 successive wins to start the season."

The Ligue 1 leaders have been charged over ""setting off fireworks"" and ""crowd disturbances"", and were also fined 20,000 euros ($22,960) for a delayed kick-off. As PSG had already had one stand closed due to flares being let off during last season's last-16 exit to Real Madrid, they could be handed a heavier penalty if found guilty this time. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel was also given a warning by UEFA over the late kick-off. In addition to the incidents inside the Parc des Princes, clashes erupted between fans and police after the game outside the stadium."

After Pele he became only the second teenager to score in the final as France beat Croatia 4-2 on a heady night in Moscow. ""Kyyyyliaannn! Welcome home"" shouted one fan, to which a visibly moved Mbappe replied: ""I am happier than you (to be here). ""It's a privilege to return here amongst you, in my home, here in Bondy. ""It's the most beautiful present,"" he told the crowd packed in to the very ground of Leo Legrange where he first kicked a ball in anger back in 2004 as a youth player for AS Bondy. Among those on hand to greet the world's second most expensive player of all time was Caroline, 28, who spent the time waiting for his appearance breastfeeding her baby. ""My son is a fan,"" she told AFP. Loufti, 14, said: ""He's an idol, it warms our hearts that he's still thinking about us, it's our dream to end up like him."" Mbappe, who last week made the front cover of Time magazine, talked to kids kitted out in the French colours with the name of their local hero emblazoned on their backs. ""We've just seen him in person, I'm not going to wash my hands for weeks!"" said one star-struck youngster, Fatoumata, aged 10. ""This is the biggest event"" in our town's history, said Bondy mayor Sylvine Thomassin.

Mbappe made headlines in September 2017 when he moved from Ligue 1 side Monaco to Paris Saint-Germain for a staggering 180 million euros ($207 million), a deal that saw the then 18-year-old player handed a reported monthly salary of 1.5m euros ($1.8m). But the 19-year-old's stock skyrocketed during this year's World Cup, where a series of phenomenal displays drew compliments from Brazil legend Pele on his way to helping France end their 20-year wait to win another World Cup trophy. Mbappe became the youngest French goalscorer in World Cup history when he struck in a 1-0 win over Peru in the group stages. The teenager from the gritty Parisian suburb of Bondy then tore apart Argentina, scoring twice and earning a penalty as Les Blues eliminated the highly-fancied South Americans 4-3 in the last 16 knockout round. In doing so, Mbappe became only the second teenager, after Pele in 1958, to score two goals in a World Cup match. When Mbappe scored with a five-yard strike in the final, a 4-2 win over Croatia, he became only the second teenager to do so, after Pele, in 1958. With a total of four goals in the tournament, Mbappe received Fi Fa's award for Best Young Player of the World Cup. Arguably better still were the plaudits from Pele himself, who said: ""If Kylian keeps on equalling my records, I'm going to have to dust off my boots."" Mbappe's teenage days will end when he celebrates his 20th birthday on December 20. He is expected to spearhead France's attack Thursday when France host Iceland in a friendly in Guin gamp."

A Neymar penalty gave PSG a ninth-minute advantage, but Presnel Kimpembe was sent off just after the half-hour mark to give Lyon hope. Bruno Genesio's side threw away their man advantage, though, as Lucas Tousart was dismissed, and after missing a string of chances, the sensational Mbappe capped an virtuoso display by scoring four times in 13 minutes to seal history for PSG. The capital-city giants, bidding for a sixth title in seven seasons, are already eight points clear of second-placed Lille at the top of the table, with Lyon five points further back in sixth. Lyon endured the worst possible start to the match, as star man Nabil Fekir was forced off injured in the seventh minute, and the hosts were awarded a spot-kick just seconds later. Mbappe raced to reach a loose ball, and visiting goalkeeper Anthony Lopes needlessly charged off his line to bring down the teenager. Neymar stepped up and sent Lopes the wrong way with a stuttering run-up to score his 11th goal of the season. Lyon responded well, though, with veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon having to shovel a Memphis Depay free-kick over the bar, before Di Maria was fortunate not to concede a penalty for handball. The reigning champions thought they had got lucky again when Kimpembe was only shown a yellow card for a nasty tackle on Tanguy Ndombele, but with the young midfielder lying stricken on the ground, a video review resulted in the centre-back's punishment being upgraded to red. But Lyon shot themselves in the foot on the stroke of half-time as Tousart tripped Mbappe inside the PSG half and was given a second yellow card. OL should have equalised early in the second period, but Maxwel Cornet contrived to miskick with the goal at his mercy. Cornet, who came on for Fekir, almost scored in bizarre circumstances shortly after, as a Silva clearance ricocheted off his back and bounced back off the base of the post. Mbappe almost put PSG out of sight three times in the space of five minutes -- powering clear after Cornet's unwitting effort and drilling against the far post, seeing Lopes dive at his feet as he ran through one-on-one, and shooting too close to the Lyon 'keeper. But the World Cup-winner's persistence finally paid off in the 61st minute as he latched onto the ball inside the area after Neymar had burst forward, turned his man and smashed the ball in off both posts. Confidence was coursing through PSG, and the floodgates opened as centre-back Marquinhos drove into the box and squared for Mbappe to stab in his eighth goal of the campaign. Neymar soon sent the 19-year-old bearing down on goal yet again, and Mbappe lofted the ball into the net to complete an incredible eight-minute hat-trick. He was not done there, though, as he pounced to slam home his fourth with 16 minutes left after Neymar had seen a low shot blocked. Earlier on Sunday, 10-man Monaco slumped to a fifth defeat in nine Ligue 1 matches as former PSG outcast Hatem Ben Arfa earned Rennes a 2-1 victory with his first league goal since April 2016. Leonardo Jardim's Monaco, runners-up to PSG last season, remain winless since the opening weekend and above the automatic relegation spots only on goal difference. Elsewhere, ex-Japan coach Vahid Halilhodzic saw his Nantes side beaten 3-0 at Bordeaux on his return to French football, while Kostas Mitroglou and Florian Thauvin scored as Marseille climbed to third following a 2-0 victory over Caen."

Messi, who had earlier twice hit the post, then got on the scoresheet in between goals from Harry Kane and Erik Lamela, before the Argentina superstar grabbed his second late on to seal victory. ""After a few bad results it was important to do well today. Our response was very good,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde. Barca head Group B on six points alongside Inter Milan, but Mauricio Pochettino's side face a vital double-header against PSV Eindhoven after failing to collect a point from their opening two matches. The Tottenham boss admitted Spurs had few answers for Messi as his team was left with an uphill struggle to reach the knockout stages. ""He's a fantastic player,"" said Pochettino. ""His average performance is this type of game. He's always above everything."" Inter, the last Italian club to win the Champions League in 2010, again recovered from a goal down to beat PSV 2-1 in the Netherlands. A cracking Pablo Rosario strike put PSV ahead, but Inter levelled through Radja Nainggolan moments after visiting goalkeeper Samir Handanovic somehow escaped a red card for handling outside his area. Mauro Icardi, whose late goal stunned Spurs a fortnight ago, was the hero again for Luciano Spalletti's men as he pounced on hesitant defending to net the winner on the hour. PSG rebounded from their 3-2 defeat by Liverpool with an attacking masterclass against 1991 European Cup winners Red Star at the Parc des Princes. Neymar curled in a sublime free-kick to open the scoring on 20 minutes, quickly doubling his tally before Edinson Cavani, Angel di Maria and Kylian Mbappe also found the target. Former Germany international Marko Marin popped up with a consolation for Red Star, with Neymar completing his hat-trick from another stunning free-kick. ""I really liked the effort made by the whole team, but Neymar was sensational,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""He is one of the best players in Europe and that is very, very important for us."" Carlo Ancelotti's Napoli top Group C on four points after Lorenzo Insigne delivered a 90th-minute winner at home to Liverpool, who are level on three alongside PSG. Dries Mertens hit the bar for Napoli late on, but there was still time for Insigne to nick all three points at the death as he slid to poke in a cross from Jose Callejon. ""Tonight we showed this group won't just be hard for Napoli, but for everyone involved,"" said Ancelotti. ""It means a lot to us to have won against the finalists from last year."" Antoine Griezmann scored two goals to lift Atletico Madrid, last season's Europa League winners, to a 3-1 victory over Club Brugge in Spain. Arnaut Groeneveld cancelled out Griezmann's opener with a thunderous strike from the left wing, but the France international restored Atletico's lead before Koke made the points safe in stoppage time. ""I said it last season and I'll say it again -- Griezmann is the best player in the world,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone. Borussia Dortmund lead Atletico at the top of Group A on goal difference following their 3-0 defeat of a struggling Monaco outfit. Jacob Bruun Larsen broke the deadlock in Germany shortly after his introduction as a half-time substitute, with Paco Alcacer finding the net just minutes after smacking a penalty against the bar. Marco Reus fired in a third from a Bruun Larsen cross, leaving Dortmund and Atletico on six points apiece ahead of their upcoming home-and-away meetings. In Group D, American international midfielder Weston McKennie hit an 88th-minute winner as struggling Schalke edged Lokomotiv Moscow 1-0. Porto are joint-top with Schalke following a 1-0 win over Galatasaray courtesy of Moussa Marega's second-half goal in Portugal."

""World football reaches its peak around February and March, with the biggest matches. ""I'm working, every match, every day, on improving both physically and technically,"" Neymar added. Asked about the foot injury in February which ended his PSG season and compounded his build-up to the World Cup in Russia, Neymar said it had made him ""very sad."" Brazil's elimination from the quarter-finals of the competition was also a source of ""great frustration"". But he added: ""My injury, the World Cup, they are in the past."" Neymar has scored seven league goals already this season, including a brace in the 3-0 win at Nice at the weekend which saw PSG make it a record-equalling eight straight victories at the start of the French campaign. However, they lost 3-2 at Liverpool in their Champions League Group C opener last month, making a win at home to Red Star vital ahead of a double-header against Napoli. Tuchel said Tuesday his positive public statements after the loss at Anfield were not the same as his ""unofficial"" reaction. ""You can well imagine that the official reaction should not be the unofficial reaction,"" he said. ""It was a very tough defeat for us, we did not play to our best. Certain criticism had to be made in the dressing room. ""It was only the first match in the group, so you cannot exaggerate the criticism, we had to keep calm,"" said the German. ""I am very happy with their reaction, we have to continue tomorrow."" After saying that Neymar was not quite at his best, Tuchel added: ""For me, it's normal because he was injured for a long time and it was a very difficult and complicated World Cup for him."" ""He did not have a normal pre-season and everyone is watching him to see if he is in top form or if he makes mistakes, it's difficult for him. ""He's a player who needs to be in a good state of mind, training with a smile. ""Honestly, I am very happy with 'Ney', he will reach top form, 100 percent, and that is very necessary,"" the coach said. ""Now he is very confident, involved in the club and in the project here and we are very satisfied."" Red Star are in the group stage for the first time since 1991-92, the season after they won the European Cup by beating Marseille on penalties in the final. They held Napoli to a 0-0 draw in their group opener but coach Vladan Milojevic is realistic about what lies in store for his side on Wednesday. ""There are no words to describe the team we will be facing,"" he said. ""I am proud to see where my team are, and we deserve it because we are the biggest team in the Balkans."" Police in Paris, meanwhile, are mostly concerned about ensuring there is no trouble. Red Star fans were officially banned from travelling to the French capital following incidents at their game against Salzburg in the play-off round. But there is a large Serbian community in the Paris region and more than 2,000 Red Star fans are expected at the Parc des Princes, mixed in with the home support. ""It would be good for PSG and for us if we could have the passion of our supporters without them creating anything else,"" said Milojevic."
425,29/09/2018,20:25,Perfect PSG brush aside Nice to equal 82-year-old Ligue 1 record,Paris Saint-Germain cruised to a 3-0 victory at Nice on Saturday to equal the record of victories from the start of a French top division season.,"Neymar, who ended the game with a bloodied mouth, scored twice as PSG opened the season with eight straight wins, a feat that had only been achieved once, by Lille in 1936. With 24 points, PSG, chasing a sixth French title in seven seasons, are sure to end the weekend at least eight points clear of their closest challengers. PSG have lost this season, in the Champions League, and with Red Star Belgrade visiting Parc des Princes on Wednesday, coach Thomas Tuchel left Marco Verratti and Edinson Cavani on the bench and also experimented again with a back three. His team still dominated Nice goalkeeper Walter Benitez turned away early efforts from Adrien Rabiot and Kylian Mbappe. Then Angel di Maria hit a post. In the 22nd minute, Christopher Nkunku surged down the right and slid the ball to Mbappe, who completely missed his shot. The ball was retrieved by Moussa Diaby who rolled it to Neymar and the Brazilian curled his shot into the net from 22 metres. PSG wasted several chances before half-time and in the 44th minute Mbappe set up Neymar, who netted from close range only for VAR to show a marginal offside. Nice coach Patrick Vieira threw on Mario Balotelli for the second half, but any hopes of a fightback were quickly punctured. A minute after the restart, Di Maria released Mbappe who raced through the visiting defence and evaded Benitez and one defender. When his shot struck another Nice player, the ball fell to Nkunku who popped it into the goal. Nice finished the game with 10 men. Wylan Cyprien, a first-half substitute, earned a second yellow for whacking Neymar in the face with an elbow while leaping for a header. Cyprien went off, Neymar continued, holding a bandage to his bleeding mouth. In the dying seconds, Mbappe again burst clear and squared the ball to Neymar who tapped in his second."
426,28/09/2018,02:44,"Cavani, Neymar on same wavelength as PSG target eighth straight win","Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel says he has done nothing special to improve the relationship between star forwards Neymar and Edinson Cavani, despite the pair playing a key role in helping the French champions enjoy their best ever start to a season.","Cavani scored twice and won a penalty that was converted by Neymar as PSG came from behind to beat Reims 4-1 on Wednesday, making it seven wins from seven games this season. Neymar's first season in Paris following his world record transfer from Barcelona was brought to a premature end by a foot injury. But before that there were concerns the Brazilian had a frosty relationship with Cavani, with the duo notably bickering over penalty-taking duties. There were no such problems on Wednesday, as the pair led PSG to another victory in the absence of the suspended Kylian Mbappe. ""I haven't done anything special. It is important that they exchange with one another,"" said Tuchel, whose team are already eight points clear at the top of Ligue 1. ""They play in the same team don't they? I haven't done anything. They are grown ups and, above all, they are pros. ""I also get the feeling that along with Kylian Mbappe and Angel (Di Maria) they are a quartet who want to win trophies and improve together."" PSG go to Nice on Saturday looking for an eighth win out of eight in the league -- if they do that they will match the best ever start to a season by any French club, set by Olympique Lillois in 1936. The good news for Tuchel is that Mbappe can return having completed his three-match ban, and the France star will surely feature ahead of next Wednesday's Champions League meeting with Red Star Belgrade. PSG need a positive result in Europe after losing away to Liverpool in their opening group outing, but first they face Patrick Vieira's Nice, who have won three of their last four matches, and can welcome back Mario Balotelli after he missed the midweek victory at Nantes. ""I know what I can get out of Mario at the moment and I am going to use him. He can maybe last an hour, or 80 minutes. The important thing is that he is ready to help the team,"" said Vieira. Lyon, Marseille and Lille are all eight points off top spot, and Lyon entertain a Nantes side whose Portuguese coach Miguel Cardoso is reported to be on the verge of the sack after a poor start to the season. Meanwhile, Marseille go to Lille after beating Strasbourg 3-2 in midweek thanks to Valere Germain's stoppage-time goal. Monaco visit Saint-Etienne on Friday looking for a first win since the opening weekend of the season. Lille must be delighted that the 23-year-old Ivory Coast international forward turned down the chance to move away from the club in the summer transfer window. The financially troubled northern side may have needed the money, but keeping Pepe gives them a much better chance of remaining up towards the top of the table. He was unable to prevent Christophe Galtier's side from losing at Bordeaux in midweek, but he has four goals this season and will be hoping to fire Lille to a fourth win from four home games when they host Marseille."
427,26/09/2018,23:14,Record-setting PSG make it seven wins in seven,Paris Saint-Germain set a new club record on Wednesday when a 4-1 victory over Reims gave them a seventh win from seven games this season and an eight-point lead in Ligue 1.,"With a perfect 21 points, new coach Thomas Tuchel surpassed the previous best start of 19 points by predecessor Unai Emery last season. The champions can now claim another slice of history on Saturday where a victory over Nice will allow PSG to equal Lille's all-time record of eight wins at the start of a season set back in 1936-1937. Missing the injured Lassana Diarra and suspended Kylian Mbappe, PSG surprisingly fell behind to Reims after just two minutes on Wednesday when Xavier Chavalerin stunned the Parc des Princes. But Edinson Cavani levelled after five minutes and then won the 24th-minute penalty which was converted by Neymar. Uruguay striker Cavani hit the third before half-time to take his season's goal tally to five, the same as Neymar. Thomas Meunier tucked away the fourth in the 55th minute after being set up by young striker Moussa Diaby much to the delight of watching US basketball legend Michael Jordan in town for this week's Ryder Cup. Moussa Dembele scored his first two goals for Lyon in two minutes in Dijon to set his team on course for an 3-0 victory that lifted them into second in Ligue 1. The 22-year old striker, who joined from Celtic on August 31, scored the opener after 17 minutes with a first-time chip over the goalkeeper and two minutes later added a second, acrobatically putting home a rebound. Martin Terrier headed a third in the 35th minute. On a night when six early matches produced six red cards, Lyon played the last 34 minutes with 10 men after Lucas Tousart received a second yellow card. Dijon's Enzo Loiodice followed in the final minute. Lyon are on 13 points from seven games, eight behind PSG. Lille, who started the evening in second, lost 1-0 at Bordeaux. Francois Kamano put the home team ahead after just seven minutes. Lille played the last few minutes with 10 men after Adama Soumaoro received a second yellow card. The other two teams who could have climbed to second, Marseille and Montpellier played games that followed similar patterns until the dying seconds. Montpellier fell behind at Caen to a goal by Saif-Eddine Khaoui after 10 minutes. Andy Delort and Damien Le Tallec resplied and put the visitors ahead and, briefly, second in the league. But Yacine Bammou leveled after 64 minutes. Seven minutes from time, Montpellier's Vitorino Hilton was sent off for a wild sliding tackle. Caen created dangerous chances, but Montpellier held on to draw 2-2. In Marseille, Kenny Lala broke away and put Strasboug ahead after 27 minutes. The home team replied twice just before half time. After Florian Thauvin was sent flying in the 41st minute, Dimitri Payet coolly converted the penalty. Then Morgan Sanson curled a shot inside the post to put Marseille ahead on the stroke of half time. After Jordan Amavi received a straight red in the 52nd minute the 10 men of Marseille held out until the 89th minute when Nuno Da Costa leveled for the visitors. Marseille responded with one last attack, and Valerie Germain met a low cross with a ferocious shot to secure a 3-2 win."

Within weeks the club had also agreed a deal to sign teenage striker Kylian Mbappe from Monaco for 180 million euros. In June, UEFA's Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) closed its investigation only to re-open it just a month later. UEFA said on Monday the case had now been referred ""back to the CFCB Investigatory Chamber for further investigation""."
429,24/09/2018,17:23,Mbappe loses appeal against three-match ban,France World Cup star Kylian Mbappe will sit out one further league game for Paris Saint-Germain after losing an appeal against a three-match suspension Monday.,"Mbappe, 19, was handed the sanction for lashing out in retaliation at Teji Savanier during a feisty 4-2 win at Nimes on September 1. Savanier was handed a four-match ban for his role in the incident, a sanction that was also confirmed following appeals by both players, the French Football Federation (FFF) announced. Mbappe, who is being tipped to win the prestigious Ballon d'Or award in December, notably on account of his performances for Les Bleus in Russia last summer, has served two of his three matches so far. He sat out a 4-0 home win over Saint Etienne and again on Sunday as PSG beat Rennes 3-1 away to reinforce their lead at the top of the table. Mbappe will sit out PSG's next league outing, at home to Reims on Wednesday, and will be eligible to return for PSG's trip to Nice on Saturday. He did play and score in PSG's Champions League defeat at Liverpool last Tuesday as the suspension does not cover European games. PSG hold a five-point lead over second-placed Lille after six league games of the season."
430,23/09/2018,17:07,Neymar gets PSG back on track,"From a deeper than usual playmaker role Brazil's Neymar pulled the strings as Paris Saint-Germain came from behind to beat Rennes 3-1 in Ligue 1 on Sunday, helping to dispel midweek memories of a European flop at Liverpool.","Hosts Rennes took a surprise 11th minute lead when PSG midfielder Adrien Rabiot nodded past his own 'keeper, Gianluigi Buffon, from a corner before goals from Angel Di Maria, Thomas Meunier and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting gave them a hard-fought sixth straight Ligue 1 win. Later Sunday Lyon, who stunned Manchester City in the Champions League in midweek, host bitter rivals Marseille. PSG critics have suggested the French giants had overspent on strikers and forgotten about the midfield after a tame 3-2 defeat in the Champions League at Anfield this week. With superstar striker Kylian Mbappe sitting out through suspension, there was room for both Di Maria and German winger Julian Draxler in the starting line up, with Neymar pulled into the No.10 position, where his passes were a sight to behold, behind Edindson Cavani. A young fan ran on to the pitch as Neymar was leaving as a late substitute and the youngster crumpled in tears as his hero hugged him and gave him his shirt in touching scenes that are likely to go viral on social media. After Rabiot's earlier upset Neymar seemed to be at the origin of almost everything the visitors threw at Rennes, including when Cavani hit the post from a sumptuous piece of play. On the stroke of half-time Draxler cut back from the byline and Cavani's dummy set up Di Maria to fire a precise shot into the bottom right-hand corner from a good 25 metres out. Neymar, 26, was then at the root of both Meunier's 61st minute goal and Choupo-Moting's first goal for the Parisians since joining from Stoke. ""We did well to come back into it,"" said PSG handler Thomas Tuchel, who instead of praising Neymar singled out Meunier. ""He was great again, a goal and some great passing, a top performance."" Buffon had his work cut out in the second half as Rennes playmaker Clement Grenier fed the speedy Senegalese strike-pair M'Baye Niang and the 20-year-old Ismaila Sarr. Rennes coach Sabri Lamouchi threw on ex-PSG midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa for one last roll of the dice but PSG went home with all three points and ideas about a new format for coach Tuchel. Pointless Guingamp were left rock bottom of Ligue 1 Sunday when they were beaten 3-1 at home by Bordeaux, who thereby climbed out of the drop zone with just their second win from six outings."
431,20/09/2018,15:52,"Lyon fly flag for France as PSG, Monaco disappoint in Europe","If only one French club was going to emerge victorious in the Champions League this week, probably very few thought that team would be Lyon, for all that they possess in their ranks a World Cup winner in Nabil Fekir.","France's Champions League trio all had extremely difficult assignments, with Lyon recording a stunning 2-1 win on Wednesday away to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. That contrasted with Paris Saint-Germain's 3-2 defeat in Liverpool a day earlier, while Monaco's limits were exposed as they went down 2-1 at home to Atletico Madrid. Lyon's win was their best result in Europe since they reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2010, and came with the pressure growing on coach Bruno Genesio. Their start to the Ligue 1 season has been poor, and they are already eight points behind leaders PSG after five games. But against City, with 10 players aged 24 or under featuring in Genesio's side, Lyon demonstrated what they are capable of. Their goals came from Maxwel Cornet and captain Fekir, who shows no sign of being troubled by the knee issue that saw Liverpool pull out of a move for him in the summer. ""Nabil showed that our captain is back, well and truly back. He was decisive and was also exemplary when we didn't have the ball. I am very proud of my players,"" said Genesio. He has been in charge for two and a half years but is not popular with all supporters -- disgruntled fans have draped the Groupama stadium with banners targeting Genesio, who has also been accosted by fans while walking in the streets of the city. However, he and his team are now galvanised ahead of another huge match, when they host bitter rivals Marseille in the league. ""We need to be able to put together a run of these performances, and we will need a repeat on Sunday against a team who are of Champions League standard,"" Genesio added. Meanwhile, the inquest into PSG's defeat against Liverpool has focused largely on their problems in midfield. The defeat in itself was no disgrace, and the result may not ultimately matter, but the manner of the performance from Thomas Tuchel's side was a cause for concern. After five straight wins in Ligue 1, they were unable to deal with the step up against last season's Champions League finalists. Their star attacking trio of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani did not perform, while they were overrun in midfield. Tuchel has publicly expressed frustration at the club's failure to sign a new holding midfielder after Thiago Motta's retirement. And while Marco Verratti was suspended at Anfield, Brazil defender Marquinhos played the holding role. ""We were maybe a bit too prudent at the end of the game, but there was also quite a lot of tiredness,"" said Thomas Meunier, and his team could have done with a player capable of holding possession. Instead, they struggled to cope with Liverpool's intensity, and they visit Rennes on Sunday stung by a fourth successive defeat in a Champions League game. Rather less was expected of Monaco. Coach Leonardo Jardim insists his side can qualify for the last 16, but they missed absentees like Rony Lopes, Aleksandr Golovin, Pietro Pellegri and Stevan Jovetic in midweek. ""Experience made the difference. I didn't think there was much between the teams,"" said Jardim, who has very few survivors from the team that reached the Champions League semi-finals in 2017. Monaco host Nimes on Friday and are in the bottom six in Ligue 1 having not won since the opening weekend. Fixtures (kick-offs GMT)"
432,18/09/2018,23:10,Super sub Firmino hands Liverpool flying Champions League start over PSG,Roberto Firmino came off the bench to strike deep into stoppage time and hand Liverpool a deserved 3-2 win over Paris Saint-Germain at Anfield on Tuesday.,"Last season's finalists showed the French champions have plenty of work to do if they are to mount a challenge for a first-ever Champions League title as they bounced back from blowing a 2-0 first-half lead. Daniel Sturridge and a James Milner penalty put the hosts in command before Thomas Meunier reduced PSG's arrears. Having kept Kylian Mbappe and the world's most expensive player Neymar quiet for almost the entire match, Liverpool seemed set to pay a heavy price for one slack pass by Mohamed Salah as Mbappe swept home seven minutes from time in front of a stunned Kop. But Firmino, who started on the bench due to an eye injury suffered against Tottenham on Saturday, had the final say as he twisted and turned before firing into the far corner to stretch Liverpool's perfect start to the season to six games. Liverpool's run to the final last season was characterised by fast starts that blew away Spartak Moscow, Manchester City and Roma at Anfield and buoyed by a perfect start to the Premier League season, the hosts put PSG under severe pressure from the off. Alphonse Areola has kept Gianluigi Buffon on the sidelines during the first few weeks of the 40-year-old's PSG career and, with the Italian suspended for his red card in Juventus' controversial exit to Real Madrid in the quarter-finals last season, started again between the sticks. The French international was busy early on as he saved from Virgil van Dijk, Milner and Sadio Mane inside the first 10 minutes. PSG have crumbled on their Champions League travels to Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid in the past two seasons and their ability to challenge for the competition was again questioned as they struggled to contain Liverpool's greater speed and power in midfield. Up front, Firmino's absence opened the door for Sturridge to make his first Champions League start for the club. The Englishman has been dogged by injury and lack of form during Klopp's nearly three years in charge, but took his chance on the big stage by powering home a pinpoint curling cross from Andy Robertson to open the scoring on the half-hour mark. Six minutes later, PSG's deficit was doubled when Juan Bernat tripped Georginio Wijnaldum inside the area and Milner slammed the resulting penalty into the bottom corner. However, the visitors were handed a lifeline through right-back Meunier, rather than one of their famed front three, as the Belgian skilfully readjusted to volley home Robertson's miscued clearance. Klopp was annoyed at his side for having to survive a nervous finale in winning at Tottenham on Saturday after passing up a series of chances to put the game to bed. And it was looked like this time they would pay as Salah had a goal ruled out for a foul by Sturridge before the latter headed a glorious chance into the arms of Areola. Salah has struggled to match his stunning 44-goal form of last season in recent weeks and was substituted by Klopp moments after gifting PSG a route back into the game. His slack pass was intercepted and quickly fed into Neymar, with Van Dijk's tackle on the Brazilian only rebounding into the path of Mbappe to fire home. Liverpool instantly went in search of a winner as Trent Alexander-Arnold's deflected free-kick came back off the woodwork, and finally got their reward when Firmino powered home."
433,17/09/2018,16:59,Neymar smart to protect himself from injury - Klopp,Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp defended Neymar's play-acting at the World Cup and believes it will be impossible to completely snuff out the Brazilian's threat when Paris Saint-Germain visit Anfield in the Champions League on Tuesday.,"Klopp insisted Neymar wasn't fully fit in Russia after breaking a bone in his foot in February that forced him to miss the rest of the club season with the French giants before the World Cup. However, the world's most expensive player earned few plaudits for his performances and became a figure of fun for his constant feigning of injury as Brazil crashed out at the quarter-finals to Belgium. ""When I saw a few games at the World Cup and I know people are talking about that and it looked like he made a bit more of situations. But it's a normal reaction because players are going for him, that's the truth, and he wants to protect himself. I understand that,"" said Klopp on Monday. ""I'm not sure it's possible to avoid his quality 100 percent. He's a fantastic footballer, outstanding."" ""He was not fit at the World Cup and he tried to take the responsibility for his country. Belgium played an outstanding game against Brazil, but if Neymar is fit, Brazil wins it. That's how it is. ""He was injured and so he had to save himself a bit. He's not a person who wants to act because if you are like that you cannot play football. ""He got rested at the weekend so he will be 100 percent fresh, he's not injured any more. We will see the full package Neymar."" Despite splashing over 400 million euros on Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, PSG failed to progress beyond the last 16 in their quest to win a first ever Champions League. But Klopp, who led Liverpool to the final in May, believes marrying a richly talented squad with new coach Thomas Tuchel makes the French giants an even bigger threat to win the competition this season. ""The players they have, the manager they have, they all brought it together to go as far as possible in the Champions League,"" he added. ""He is an outstanding coach. I really thought it was a smart decision of PSG to sign Tuchel,"" said Klopp. ""For this kind of team with unbelievable individual quality, you still need a manager who can teach or educate them in playing together and they brought in one of the best I know. That makes them quite a big challenge for us."" Liverpool have build on the momentum of reaching last season's final and a summer of shrewd investment in the transfer market by winning all five of their opening Premier League games. However, as they prepare to face one of the world's most daunting attacking tridents in Neymar, Mbappe and Edison Cavani, Klopp could be without one of his prolific front three. Roberto Firmino suffered an abrasion after being poked in his left eye by Tottenham's Jan Vertonghen on Saturday and is a doubt to partner Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. ""Would he play today? No chance, but we all hope tomorrow (he'll be ok),"" said Klopp. ""It's a big relief for us. It's painful, nobody needs that, but he will be fine. We only don't know exactly when. Another 30 hours until the game so we will see how it develops."""
434,13/09/2018,19:25,PSG hoping Jordan deal will help meet Financial Fair Play demands,Paris Saint-Germain President Nasser Al-Khelaifi has told AFP he is confident a lucrative new kit deal with Nike's Jordan Brand will help them fall into line with UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules.,"PSG unveiled their new home and away Champions League shirts, which will carry the Jordan Brand ""Jumpman"" logo, at a ceremony in Paris on Thursday after announcing a three-year deal. According to a source, the Qatar-owned club are hoping to bring in some 200 million euros ($233.6 million) in total revenue in a year thanks to sales from the deal with the brand named after NBA icon Michael Jordan. It is a subsidiary of Nike, PSG's kit supplier for over 30 years. ""It is amazing, it will help. That is why I tell everybody, don't worry, because our revenue will increase,"" Al-Khelaifi told AFP. ""We have a lot of things to do of course, but the global brand today of Paris Saint-Germain, with Jordan, can add a lot of revenue, soon and in the season."" Al-Khelaifi claims that PSG are now ""one of the biggest three brands in the world, in football."" However, his club became the subject of an investigation from European football's governing body last year after raising eyebrows when they announced the two most expensive transfer deals in the history of the game, signing Neymar and Kylian Mbappe for a combined total of over 400 million euros. UEFA announced in June that PSG would not be sanctioned, only to reopen the case in July, although they are yet to pronounce a final decision. Financial Fair Play rules were brought in to ensure that clubs competing in European competitions do not spend more than they earn, or post losses of more than 30 million euros over three seasons. After their huge spending spree a year ago, the French champions were more restrained with their business in the transfer window which closed at the end of last month. They signed German defender Thilo Kehrer from Schalke 04 for 37 million euros and Spanish left-back Juan Bernat from Bayern Munich for a reported 15 million euros. Italian goalkeeping great Gianluigi Buffon and Cameroon striker Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting also joined on free transfers. PSG have already fallen foul of FFP, being fined 60 million euros in prize money earned from playing in the Champions League in 2014. Back then UEFA deemed PSG had artificially inflated their income using a sponsorship deal with another Qatari state-owned enterprise, the Qatar Tourism Authority."
435,13/09/2018,17:31,Mbappe starts ban as PSG warm up for trip to Liverpool,Kylian Mbappe takes an enforced rest from the Paris Saint-Germain side this weekend as the French champions warm up for their Champions League trip to Liverpool with a home clash against Saint-Etienne.,"Mbappe begins a three-game ban from domestic action handed down after he was sent off right at the end of PSG's 4-2 win at Nimes a fortnight ago. The 19-year-old France superstar was shown a red card for shoving Nimes player Teji Savanier to the floor in a violent reaction to being fouled. He later said he had no regrets and insisted he would do it again, and the consequences are that he will sit out a trio of Ligue 1 matches for Thomas Tuchel's side. ""It was very harsh. He reacted in a very emotive manner but he didn't hit anyone, he just pushed him. He was frightened because of the violence of the foul,"" Tuchel said of the incident in an interview with SFR Sport this week. The rest might not harm Mbappe, who was at the Parc des Princes on Thursday as the club launched a new European jersey, by Nike's Jordan Brand, in a glitzy ceremony. Mbappe also scored for France in their 2-1 win over the Netherlands last weekend and is certain to start when PSG begin their latest quest for Champions League glory at Anfield next Tuesday. There is huge pressure on Tuchel to take PSG far in Europe after they were eliminated in the last 16 in each of the last two seasons, but they have been drawn in a testing group that also features Carlo Ancelotti's Napoli and Red Star Belgrade. At least Tuchel has got off to a serene start domestically, with PSG having won their first four games of the Ligue 1 season. Saint-Etienne's visit to the Parc des Princes could be the toughest test yet, however, especially as there are also doubts that Neymar can last 90 minutes. The world's most expensive player turned out for Brazil in midweek in a 5-0 friendly win over El Salvador in the United States and scored, as did PSG colleague Marquinhos. That game did not finish until the early hours of Wednesday, French time. ""It's only about what is a risk for tomorrow. It is important that he is on the pitch tomorrow and wins the game for us then,"" Tuchel told media on Thursday. ""And then we see for the next thing, but the big players can play a lot of games, and for that we take the decision very carefully."" The coach added: ""I hope that nobody is thinking about Tuesday, that is very, very important for me."" Friday's game could also see new signing Juan Bernat make his first appearance as a PSG player. The Spanish international was signed from Bayern Munich for 15 million euros ($17.5 million) just before the transfer window closed and is a welcome addition with Layvin Kurzawa out for two months after back surgery. Lyon will also be in England on Champions League duty next week, travelling to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City. That is a daunting prospect for Bruno Genesio's team, who first go to Caen this weekend with Moussa Dembele hoping to make his debut after joining from Celtic. ""He is a real number nine, a penalty-box player, but not only that,"" said Genesio of the France under-21 striker, signed for 22 million euros. France's other Champions League representatives are Monaco, who are at Toulouse on Saturday ahead of another difficult European tie against Atletico Madrid."
436,11/09/2018,17:48,PSG announce deal to launch cryptocurrency,"French footballing giants Paris Saint-Germain are launching their own cryptocurrency after announcing a new partnership with Socios.com, a blockchain company based in Malta.","In a statement announcing the deal on Tuesday, Qatar-owned PSG did not reveal the length of the agreement or how much money they will make from it, although a source told AFP they expected it to be worth ""several million euros"". Socios.com describes itself as a ""tokenized football fan voting platform"", with the title derived from the Spanish name given to members of La Liga giants Barcelona and Real Madrid. The idea is to allow PSG fans to buy tokens which allow them to vote in online club surveys. Socios.com's own website says it gives ""fans access to club branded fan tokens that come with voting rights and access to VIP level club rewards and engagement opportunities"". The team behind it has raised more than $66 million in financing so far. But PSG, who signed Brazilian superstar Neymar for a world record fee of 222 million euros ($264m) last year, also want to ""release rewards, exclusive content and all kinds of experiences"" through the deal, according to the club's head of sponsorship, Marc Armstrong. Socios.com founder Alexandre Dreyfus says his company's idea is to ""reinvent... in more of a 2.0 style"" the concept of the ""socio"", which in Spain means allowing fans to be directly involved in club decision-making by essentially making them shareholders. However, rather than being involved in key strategic decisions, PSG supporters are likely to be paying to have their say in more anecdotal decisions, starting from ""early next season"". These could include issues like selecting the design of the team's jersey. Blockchain, the system that moves chunks of data securely through an online ledger, has been put to growing uses from medical records to banking and most prominently as the tool behind crytocurrency Bitcoin. In PSG's case, there will be a ""limited"" number of club-stamped tokens released thanks to the blockchain. The price of the tokens has yet to be set, ""but their cost will be very low because obviously this is aimed at as many people as possible"", Dreyfus told AFP. However, beyond the monetisation of the sale of the tokens, what is the objective of this venture? ""For us, the interest comes from the level of engagement with fans, in the manner in which we can offer them a better experience,"" Armstrong says. ""Not just those who attend matches but also those in Asia, in the United States, and in all four corners of the planet."" Having already moved into eSports, PSG are hoping this move reinforces their presence in the digital domain, with Armstrong calling it a ""strategic partnership, rather than a deal in which someone pays us just to be associated to a brand""."
437,05/09/2018,21:00,PSG star Mbappe banned for three matches after red card,"French teenage sensation Kylian Mbappe has been suspended for three matches after his red card against Nimes last weekend, the French league announced on Wednesday.","The 19-year-old, who also scored in the 4-2 win, was sent off for pushing over Teji Savanier after the Nimes player hacked him to the ground. The French champions will be without Mbappe for Ligue 1 games against Saint-Etienne on September 14, Rennes on September 23 and Reims three days later. The ban does not affect Mbappe's participation in PSG's mouthwatering Champions League opener against last season's runners-up Liverpool at Anfield on Tuesday, September 18. Savanier, who was also dismissed by referee Jerome Brisard after the incident, has been handed a five-match suspension. Mbappe had already been booked in the first half of the encounter last Saturday for taking the ball away before a Nimes free-kick. It is the second red card of Mbappe's young career after he was sent off in January for a bad foul on Rennes' Ismaila Sarr during a French League Cup semi-final. As he is currently with the France squad preparing for Thursday's UEFA Nations League opener against Germany in Munich, he was not present at Wednesday's disciplinary hearing. Mbappe was named the best young player of the tournament after scoring four goals as France won the World Cup for the second time in July, becoming only the second teenager after Brazilian legend Pele to net in a World Cup final. He has already scored four goals in just three appearances for PSG this season."

Youri Tielemans hit back for Monaco on 48 minutes before World Cup winner Adil Rami, watched by US actress girlfriend Pamela Anderson, failed to clear properly and Falcao gobbled up the loose ball to smash a shot into the roof of the net and put the home side ahead.

The video pans out to a smiling Ben Arfa, who has won five Ligue 1 titles, wearing the Rennes number 18 shirt. ""I'm on top form and I've done all the tests,"" Ben Arfa pointed out on Sunday. ""I'm really happy to be here where there are great ambitions, I feel like it is the right club for me,"" he said.

442,25/08/2018,20:02,'MCN' combine as Tuchel's PSG continue perfect start to season,Kylian Mbappe again made a decisive contribution as Paris Saint-Germain's superstar front three combined for the goals in a 3-1 win over Angers in Ligue 1 on Saturday.,"On his first start since winning the World Cup with France, Mbappe volleyed in PSG's crucial second goal just after the break at the Parc des Princes, and he then set up Neymar for the strike that clinched the points. Before that, Edinson Cavani had marked his first appearance of the season with an early opener, only for Thomas Mangani's penalty to bring Angers back level midway through the first half. This was a third win in as many games for PSG to start their defence of the French title, and seeing all three members of his 'MCN' attack find the net will have greatly pleased new coach Thomas Tuchel. ""It was a deserved victory but again it was difficult,"" said Tuchel. ""We are not fresh at the moment because we have been working so hard at training during the week."" It was the first time in six months that Mbappe, Cavani and Neymar had all played together, with the latter having missed the end of last season due to injury. Tuchel also selected Angel Di Maria in his starting line-up, with that quartet alone costing the capital side over 500 million euros ($581 million) in transfer fees in the last five years. ""For me at the moment it is very important to have 'Ney' on the field with the other three key attacking players in Angel, Kylian and 'Edi',"" said Tuchel. ""I want to find a position for all the players."" The German coach also handed a debut to his compatriot, the young defender Thilo Kehrer, a recent 37 million-euro signing from Schalke 04. To accommodate him as well as so many attacking talents, Tuchel lined his side up in an unusual 3-4-2-1 formation, and the early signs were promising enough. A brilliant Thiago Silva interception on halfway led to Neymar delivering a low cross for Cavani to turn in a 12th-minute opener, and the Uruguayan headed off the post from another Neymar cross soon after. However, Angers got the chance to equalise when Kehrer brought down Flavien Tait in the box, a challenge that led to the defender being booked and the visitors winning a penalty. Mangani slotted the spot-kick past Alphonse Areola, another French World Cup winner returning to the side, in his case at the expense of Gianluigi Buffon. Not happy with his team's display, Tuchel took off Kehrer at the interval, sending on youngster Stanley N'Soki and reverting to a back four. ""He is a very, very humble boy, he committed the foul for the penalty and then the referee said it was dangerous for him because he had committed a few fouls and was on a booking,"" said Tuchel of his decision to replace Kehrer. The alterations paid off as Mbappe restored the lead within six minutes of the restart, meeting Di Maria's cross from the left with a superb volley into the far corner. Mbappe was in the mood to thrill the Parc des Princes crowd, and he set up the third goal on 65 minutes, his cutback being turned in by Neymar for the Brazilian's third of the season, as many as Mbappe. Dijon are the only other team with three wins from three, after their stunning 4-0 success at Nice. Jules Keita scored twice after Nayef Aguerd and Oussama Haddadi had netted for Dijon on a miserable night for Nice, who are yet to win under Patrick Vieira. After perfect starts to the season, newly-promoted duo Nimes and Reims lost respectively at Toulouse (1-0) and Amiens (4-1). Lyon beat Strasbourg 2-0 on Friday with Martin Terrier and Bertrand Traore scoring. Monaco are in action on Sunday at Bordeaux, who are hoping to name Arsenal and France great Thierry Henry as their new coach in the coming days, once Gustavo Poyet's departure is confirmed."
443,24/08/2018,22:58,Fekir returns as Lyon brush aside Strasbourg,Nabil Fekir made his first appearance of the new season as Lyon bounced back from last week's surprise loss to Reims by seeing off Strasbourg 2-0 in Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Bruno Genesio's men eased to their second victory from as many league home matches this term thanks to goals from Martin Terrier and Bertrand Traore, while Fekir, who saw a move to Liverpool fall through in the close season, played the last 11 minutes. The home side took the lead shortly before half-time as full-back Ferland Mendy slipped through an inch-perfect pass for Terrier, who spent last season on loan at Strasbourg, to curl into the bottom corner. Former Chelsea forward Traore wrapped up the win in style with a fantastic individual goal in the 64th minute, latching onto Memphis Depay's ball before dribbling past visiting goalkeeper Matz Sels and a backtracking defender to slot in. Fekir missed the first two games of the season after returning late from the World Cup, where he made six substitute appearances in France's triumphant campaign. Lyon, who finished third last season to qualify for the Champions League group stage, have now won their last eight home Ligue 1 matches. Reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain welcome Angers to the Parc des Princes on Saturday, when new coach Thomas Tuchel could field forwards Edinson Cavani, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe together for the first time."
444,24/08/2018,18:51,PSG to rest Buffon for upcoming games as Areola returns,"Gianluigi Buffon will sit out Paris Saint-Germain's next two games with Alphonse Areola returning in goal for the French champions, coach Thomas Tuchel confirmed on Friday.","Italian great Buffon, 40, has played in PSG's three competitive outings so far this season since his arrival on a free transfer from Juventus, and has conceded only one goal in that time. Areola, meanwhile, returned late from a post-World Cup holiday, having been part of France's squad during their triumphant campaign in Russia. The 25-year-old was PSG's first-choice goalkeeper last season, and will now start against Angers in Ligue 1 on Saturday and next weekend at Nimes. ""Afterwards we will see. I do not like making long-term decisions,"" Tuchel said at a press conference at PSG's training ground. ""It is important that Alphonse plays. He played in May, and now he needs to play to adapt to the team."" Areola did not play at the World Cup, sitting behind skipper Hugo Lloris and Steve Mandanda in the French pecking order. ""Gigi has been exceptional, magnificent in the last three matches. I don't like taking him out of the team, but on the other hand, it is very important at this stage to give Alphonse the chance to play,"" added Tuchel. Central to Tuchel's thinking is that Buffon will not be able to play in PSG's first three Champions League group-stage matches as he serves a three-game ban carried over from last season, when he was still at Juve. With the German Kevin Trapp seemingly not in contention, Areola needs to build up match fitness, especially with an international break following the trip to Nimes on September 1. Marco Verratti and Layvin Kurzawa are still missing for PSG as they face Angers at the Parc des Princes on Saturday afternoon (1500 GMT). However, Edinson Cavani has been hoping to make his first appearance since suffering a calf injury at the World Cup, while Thilo Kehrer could feature for the first time. The young German defender signed on a five-year deal last week from Schalke 04 for a reported fee of 37 million euros ($42.3 million)."
445,18/08/2018,22:14,Mbappe plays starring role on return to PSG side,Kylian Mbappe marked his first appearance for Paris Saint-Germain since winning the World Cup by coming off the bench to score a late brace that gave the French champions a 3-1 victory at Guingamp on Saturday.,"Nolan Roux had given the home side the lead in the Brittany sunshine, and only a combination of Gianluigi Buffon and VAR prevented Thomas Tuchel's side from being further behind at half-time. But Mbappe came on for the second half and Neymar equalised from the penalty spot soon after, before the 19-year-old France starlet added two goals in the closing 10 minutes to secure the points. ""I have very big objectives, so there is no time to loaf around,"" Mbappe told Canal Plus at the end of the game. ""I brought something to the team but the whole side wanted to do better after a timid start to the match."" It is now two wins from two in Ligue 1 this season for PSG under new coach Tuchel, after they swept aside Monaco 4-0 to win the campaign-opening Champions Trophy in China. ""The situation is still difficult for us because the players are not on top form having arrived late after the World Cup,"" said Tuchel, who admitted his team had been fortunate not to be 3-0 down at half-time. The capital side were again without a host of big names, including Edinson Cavani, the Uruguayan still not deemed fit to return after a calf injury suffered at the World Cup. Mbappe started on the bench along with two fellow French World Cup winners, goalkeeper Alphonse Areola and centre-back Presnel Kimpembe. Tuchel again put faith in youth, just as he had done in last week's 3-0 win over Caen. Timothy Weah, the 18-year-old son of the great George Weah, was rewarded for his goal-scoring exploits off the bench in that game with a start here. However, he was hauled off at the interval after a dreadful first-half performance from his side. Buffon kept his team on level terms when he tipped a Roux effort onto the bar early on, but the veteran Italian goalkeeper was beaten 20 minutes in. The goal came when Antoine Bernede's pass put his fellow teenager Colin Dagba in trouble -- the full-back got caught in two minds and Marcus Coco intervened to play in Roux for his first goal for the club. Paris were then grateful to the Video Assistant Referee for confirming on-field official Clement Turpin's decision to disallow a second Guingamp goal in the 25th minute. Coco went round Buffon to set up Nicolas Benezet, but he was adjudged to have fouled Dagba just before heading in. With Mbappe on, it was Neymar who levelled the scores with a 53rd-minute penalty he himself had won. That was the Brazilian's second goal in as many games, but Mbappe's performances at the World Cup hinted that he could steal more of the limelight from the world's most expensive player this season. In his first game since scoring in France's 4-2 final win over Croatia last month, Mbappe put PSG in front with eight minutes left after being set up by Angel Di Maria. And he made sure of the points at the death with a delightful dink over Guingamp's Swedish goalkeeper Karl-Johan Johnsson, with Neymar this time providing the assist. That goal even drew applause from the Guingamp fans, mindful of the youngster's role in France's glorious campaign in Russia. ""It was top to have Kylian and to be able to bring him on,"" added Tuchel. ""It was not a surprise but the situation was completely different after he came on."" Meanwhile, Radamel Falcao had a second-half penalty saved as Monaco were held 0-0 at home by Lille, after Lyon suffered a 1-0 defeat at newly-promoted Reims on Friday."
446,29/07/2018,11:32,Say I'm your No.1: goalkeeper Buffon faces fight at PSG,Italy legend Gianluigi Buffon has a fight on his hands for the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper's shirt as coach Thomas Tuchel revealed he had not yet decided who was his number one.,"Buffon has made his first move abroad at the age of 40 but faces stiff competition at the French club, which shares his ambition of a first Champions League title. Tuchel has an embarrassment of goalkeeping riches including Alphonse Areola, a member of France's World Cup-winning squad, German international Kevin Trapp, Sebastien Cibois and Remy Descamps. ""He's (Buffon) not afraid to fight for his place, Kevin and Alphonse are not afraid to fight for their place,"" Tuchel said in Singapore, ahead of Monday's friendly with Atletico Madrid. ""This is the kind of competition that I would love to have in every other position."" The German added: ""This is a situation we need to handle relaxed but clearly. When everybody is there and everybody has shown up and everybody is healthy at the top level, then it's time to decide."" Buffon has not had the easiest of starts with PSG, shipping four goals in his first two friendly appearances against Bayern Munich and Arsenal. Buffon, who clocked up 656 appearances in 17 years at Juventus, insisted he never expected simply to be handed a starting spot. ""In 24 years of my career, nobody has ever told me that I had the number one shirt by right. It's come through hard training and being selected based on merit,"" he said. ""So I'll continue to do that and also work towards developing the other goalkeepers in the squad."" The 2006 World Cup-winner also denied that the chance of winning an elusive Champions League title was the main motivation behind his move to PSG on a one-year deal. ""This decision was made so I could continue... to play at the top level,"" he said. ""I've always been excited by the thought of a challenge abroad, a challenge as ambitious and important as this one at Paris. ""I think after 40 years in Italy, a change will be good for me from a personal point of view as well as a professional one."""
447,29/07/2018,10:31,Tuchel treads carefully over Neymar play-acting,Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel pledged to keep his conversations with Neymar behind closed doors on Sunday as he weighs up how best to deal with the combustible star.,"Neymar, the world's most expensive player, was widely lampooned for his play-acting at the World Cup, but Tuchel refused to reveal if he would raise it with the Brazilian. ""I'm young -- well, not so young -- but I know when I speak about Neymar there's a lot of potential to every word that I say,"" said the 44-year-old German. ""So the best thing when I speak to him about something that we do this in closed rooms."" Tuchel's arrival at PSG follows reports of discord between Neymar and fellow forwards Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani, as well as ex-coach Unai Emery. Tuchel said he needed a close relationship with Neymar, whose difficult World Cup ended when Brazil were stunned by Belgium in the quarter-finals. ""I'm very sure that I have a connection with him and I'm very sure that I need to have a connection with these kinds of players,"" Tuchel said. ""He's an outstanding player. He knows how to handle big victories, he also knows how to handle defeats, because that's the way sport is. ""It's always a big challenge to bounce back and I will help him with that. (But) what I talk about with him, when I talk with him, it's a secret that I keep."""
448,29/07/2018,08:18,"Meet Tim Weah, the president's son with big football boots to fill","It isn't easy when your father is footballing royalty -- and the president of Liberia to boot. But for 18-year-old Tim Weah, son of the legendary player-turned-politician George, having a famous name on his shirt isn't proving a hindrance.","Weah wasn't even born during his father's playing career, which included the 1995 Ballon d'Or and one of the greatest goals in history, for AC Milan -- which he now watches on YouTube. He admits his father is on a ""pedestal"", but he hasn't let the pressure affect a burgeoning career for Paris Saint-Germain and the United States, co-host of the World Cup in 2026, when he will be 26. After standing out at junior level, American-born Weah netted his first senior international goal in May, and got off the mark for PSG -- where his father starred in the 1990s -- this month against Bayern Munich. ""When I'm out there, it's just me and the ball and my teammates and that's all I really care about,"" he said, after catching the eye in Saturday's 5-1 pre-season defeat to Arsenal in Singapore. ""The name on my back, I don't really see it, it's the fans that are seeing it. So no pressure, I just try to play my game."" Early indications are good for the centre-forward, who is strong and skillful, fast, astute, and has an eye for goal -- and his father's knack for the spectacular. While he hasn't dribbled from his own penalty box to score, as his father famously did against Verona in 1996, Weah did hit a screamer during his hat-trick against Paraguay at last year's Under-17 World Cup, a goal he accurately describes as a ""complete banger"". On Saturday, Weah twice came close to scoring for a youthful PSG side, and earned the penalty that brought their only goal when he drew a foul from Sead Kolasinac. But he says he is happy to bide his time and wait for opportunities at star-studded PSG, where he can learn from the fearsome strike force of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani. ""With this type of player, I just learn maturity, just be comfortable on the ball and be yourself out there, because no one can take that from you,"" Weah said. ""I watch these players all the time. At the World Cup I was watching them and I took some stuff from their games as far as being confident, being skillful (is concerned)."" Beyond his own development, there is another goal in sight for Weah, a proud American who wants to use the skills he learns in Paris to bring his country success. ""Being from America, I play with a lot of heart, that's one thing that we Americans have and that's what I try to do and give out there on the pitch every day,"" he said. As his career surges, Weah said he is getting ""great advice"" from both his father and his mother. But he stresses that any achievements on the pitch are all his own. ""I still watch his videos, I try to take something from it but the game that you guys see out there is all me,"" he said. ""That's all the stuff that I've worked on over the years. I'm almost there but I've got to keep pushing, I've got to keep working hard and we'll see where this season takes me."""
449,28/07/2018,15:50,Race-row Ozil fires Arsenal to big win over PSG,Mesut Ozil fired Arsenal to a 5-1 friendly win over Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday as he cast aside a turbulent week after quitting Germany's national team claiming racism.,"Ozil put Arsenal ahead in the 13th minute before Alexandre Lacazette's quickfire double and late strikes from Rob Holding and Eddie Nketiah against a youthful PSG side. The International Champions Cup win in Singapore was also a boost for Arsenal's new manager Unai Emery against his former club, now under Germany's Thomas Tuchel. Ozil, named as captain after his torrid week, was quickly into his stride with midfield partner Henrikh Mkhitaryan against a PSG line-up shorn of its World Cup stars. He opened the scoring with a tap-in at the far post after Mkhitaryan released Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in space and the Gabonese forward passed back across the face. Ozil's exquisite flick during a length-of-the pitch move nearly produced Arsenal's second but Gianluigi Buffon saved well from Nigeria's Alex Iwobi. The Italian great also denied Aubameyang and Mkhitaryan, while at the other end teenager Timothy Weah twice went close and Christopher Nkunku curled one over. After the break, an Nkunku free kick drew a flying save from Arsenal substitute Emiliano Martinez, before Weah went down for a 59th-minute penalty which Nkunku converted with aplomb. But Lacazette hit back with two goals in four minutes -- first a sumptuous, near-post heel-flick which sailed past the nonplussed Buffon, and then a close-range header. Substitute defender Holding added the fourth with a towering header on 87 minutes, before Nketiah swept home Arsenal's fifth with the last kick of the game. Ozil, who is of Turkish heritage, sent shockwaves through Germany this week when he quit the national team complaining of ""racism and disrespect"" from football authorities."

Ex-coach Unai Emery reportedly tangled with Neymar, while French World Cup-winner Kylian Mbappe is also rumoured to have a fractious relationship with the Brazilian star. But Tuchel insisted: ""In my experience the biggest players are the easiest characters because they want to compete and they want to win."" ""Of course we have very big personalities but I'm not worried about this,"" he added at the International Champions Cup in Singapore, where PSG play Emery's Arsenal on Saturday. ""In the end I strictly believe that all of these guys were somewhere, sometime, some five, six-year-old guy with the ball under his arm, going round playing on the beach, around the houses, on the streets. ""We want to find this and bring this out so that they enjoy it. And also enjoy the hard work, and that they are aware of the signs that they give to everybody outside and inside the club."" Neymar is yet to return to PSG after the World Cup, where Brazil were stunned by Belgium in the quarter-finals. The forward was also lampooned for his extravagant play-acting, which sparked the viral #NeymarChallenge on social media. ""Everybody in the club wants to help them to feel very well very soon so they can approach their next goals and not worry too long about what happened at the World Cup,"" Tuchel said, when asked about Brazil's defeat. ""He's (Neymar) a big player, he knows how to handle victories, he knows how to handle losses... he's a champion and we will help him to bounce back."""

Krychowiak spent the past season on loan at West Brom in the Premier League and started 20 times as the club was relegated from the top flight. He is the fifth player to leave Paris this summer after the departures of Javier Pastore (Roma), Odsonne Edouard (Celtic), Yuri Berchiche (Athletic Bilbao) and Jonathan Ikone (Lille).

Bayern dominated the second half and struck three times in 18 minutes. Spaniard Javier Martinez opened the scoring past Gianluigi Buffon, the Italian veteran who joined PSG this summer.

Neymar, who became the world's most expensive footballer last year after moving to PSG from Barcelona in a record 222 million euro ($264 million) deal, has repeatedly been linked to a move to Real Madrid. The European champions have issued a series of statements in recent weeks denying they have an interest in signing the 26-year-old striker. Speculation of a Neymar move to the Bernabeu has intensified in the wake of Cristiano Ronaldo's shock move to Juventus, a development that has left a vacancy at Madrid for an elite, superstar player. ""In the face of the constant reports linking PSG's Neymar Jr. to our club, Real Madrid C. F. wish to clarify that the club has no intention of making any offer for the player,"" a Real Madrid statement said last week. ""The two clubs enjoy an excellent relationship and, as such, if Real Madrid were at any stage to consider securing the services of a PSG player, they would approach the club in the first instance."" Although Neymar insisted Thursday he was staying in Paris, reports persisted that a move could be on the cards. British media reports said Thursday PSG were open to the possibility of selling Neymar. Madrid president Florentino Perez meanwhile said the club was determined to reinforce its squad following Ronaldo's departure. ""Real has a great squad that is going to be reinforced with magnificent players,"" Perez said earlier this week. ""We are aware of the level of demand of the team each season. We are Real Madrid and we always want more. We must reinforce the present and at the same time strengthen the future.""

""I was always first choice at Parma, Juve and the national side, but nobody ever told me I'd be an automatic first choice"" at PSG, he explained. ""I have always been a player who has earned his starting place on the field,"" added Buffon, who will seek to dislodge Alphonse Areola, who pushed German Kevin Trapp down to number two last season. ""Of course I am 40 years old but I am in excellent physical form. I know that when there is a need to have major goals (at a club) then you need all hands on deck. ""We shall all get game time during the season and I shall do all I can to put the others in the best possible conditions. I want to show I am a great keeper and I am sure I shall do that,"" Buffon concluded as he looks to stake a claim at the French champions, who have five keepers on their books."

Pastore's move back to Italy comes with Paris Saint-Germain under pressure from UEFA to balance their books after signing Neymar and Kylian Mbappe in blockbuster deals last season, sparking an audit of their financial affairs. The UEFA Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) in May cleared PSG's 'break-even requirement' for 2015, 2016 and 2017, but warned them they were under scrutiny.

UEFA opened an investigation into PSG's compliance with FFP rules at the start of this season, just weeks after they completed deals to sign Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. Neymar arrived for a world-record fee of 222 million euros ($264 million) from Barcelona, while the club also signed Mbappe on loan from Monaco but with an agreement to sign the teen sensation in a 180 million-euro deal at the end of this campaign. British newspaper the Financial Times in April claimed PSG had ""overstated"" sponsorship contracts to the tune of 200 million euros.

And the 26-year-old superstar, currently in Brazil training with the national team prior to the World Cup, has done little to quash the rumours. Although linked with a move to European champions Real Madrid, Neymar told ESPN Brasil he wanted to experience working alongside Guardiola having missed the opportunity when he arrived at previous club Barcelona a year after the Spanish coach's departure. ""I've always wanted to work with Guardiola. He's different. I arrived (in Barcelona) a year after he left,"" said Neymar, who was interviewed for the programme by fellow compatriot and ex-Fenerbahce midfielder Alex. ""I really want to work with him."" Guardiola quit Barcelona in 2012 after steering the club to 14 trophies in four seasons. Neymar arrived a year later and went on to spend four seasons at the Camp Nou, before completing his record-setting move to the French capital. Although PSG secured a French domestic treble of league, Cup and League Cup last season, Neymar missed the latter third due to injury. Having suffered a foot injury in February, Neymar underwent surgery in Brazil. However rumours suggest he is keen to leave Paris, with a preference to return to Barcelona's arch rivals Real Madrid."
462,22/05/2018,00:23,Buffon to make a decision on PSG within week,Juventus legend Gianluigi Buffon said Monday that he will make a decision this week on whether he will be joining Paris Saint-Germain.,"Buffon, 40, played his final game for the Italian giants in a 2-1 win over Verona on Saturday, capping a 17-year career in Turin that harvested seven consecutive Serie A titles. ""PSG? I need a week to be calm and analyse everything. These aren't simple choices. At 40, you can't make decisions in the heat of the moment,"" Buffon told Sky Sports Italia after playing in former Italy team-mate Andrea Pirlo's testimonial at the San Siro on Monday. ""Do I speak French? No,"" he added. Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi earlier in the day poured cold water on suggestions Buffon could step in to replace the French club's number one goalkeeper, Alphonse Areola. Al-Khelaifi told L'Equipe sports daily: ""He (Buffon) is a fantastic goalkeeper, he's very charismatic and is a true gentleman. I'm sure all the clubs want him."""
463,21/05/2018,22:18,Emery set to succeed Wenger as Arsenal boss - reports,"Former Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery looks set to become Arsene Wenger's successor after 22 years as Arsenal manager, the BBC reported on Monday.","Emery, 46, won Ligue 1 and four domestic cups in two seasons in the French capital before departing earlier this month. However, the Spaniard paid for his failure to get PSG beyond the last 16 of the Champions League in his two seasons at the Parc des Princes. ""Emery emerged as the unanimous choice following a recruitment process in which all candidates were spoken to,"" said the BBC. PSG had previously reached four consecutive Champions League quarter-finals following the Qatari takeover of the club in 2011, but Emery oversaw a humiliating defeat to Barcelona in the last 16 a year ago, losing 6-1 at the Camp Nou after a 4-0 win in the first leg. The club then committed to spending 400 million euros ($483 million) on Neymar and Kylian Mbappe alone -- the two most expensive transfer deals in history -- last year, but Paris were eliminated in the last 16 again this year, going out to Real Madrid. ""We lost against Real but they are showing that they are maybe still the strongest team in Europe,"" said Emery when announcing his departure. Emery previously enjoyed great success on the European stage at Sevilla, where he won three Europa League titles in three full seasons at the Sanchez Pizjuan. Arsenal have been looking for a new boss for the first time in over two decades since Wenger announced last month he was stepping down at the end of the season. A sixth-placed finish in the Premier League, the Frenchman's worst-ever return, means the Gunners have failed to qualify for the Champions League for a second straight season. Former Arsenal midfielder Mikel Arteta, who has formed part of Pep Guardiola's coaching staff at Premier League champions Manchester City for the past two seasons, appeared to be the front runner in the past week. Arteta, who played 150 games for Arsenal between 2011 and 2016, even had Wenger's blessing. ""He was a leader, has good passion for the game, knows the club and knows what is important at the club,"" Wenger told BeIn Sports. However, Arteta's lack of previous managerial experience appears to have seen him lose out to his compatriot. Emery's own playing career was a modest one, largely in Spain's lower divisions after failing to make the grade at Real Sociedad. However, he established a reputation as a bright young coach at Lorca and Almeria before being handed his first big job at Valencia in 2008. Despite severe financial problems as players like David Villa, David Silva and Juan Mata were sold, Emery led Valencia to third place behind Barcelona and Real Madrid for three consecutive seasons. A short, ill-fated spell at Spartak Moscow followed before he returned to his homeland at Sevilla in 2013."
464,21/05/2018,00:17,Relaxed Tuchel embraces PSG challenge,"Paris Saint-Germain did not waste time turning the page on Unai Emery's time in charge, and the arrival of the fresh-faced Thomas Tuchel marks the start of a new era.","Less than 24 hours after Emery bowed out as the Ligue 1 champions played out a soporific goalless draw in Caen without a host of their biggest names, Tuchel appeared at the Parc des Princes for the first time. The German looked confident and relaxed as he was unveiled to the French media and then photographed on the pitch on a perfect Parisian spring evening. After a year out following his departure from Borussia Dortmund, where he won the 2017 German Cup, the 44-year-old was linked to the Premier League. But he was clearly seduced by the French capital. ""This is Paris, it's magnificent, the city of love, the city of light. It is a romantic city and a city for adventure,"" he said. ""I would love our supporters to fall in love with the team and that the brightest players play here."" Tuchel spoke mainly in excellent English, but he showed a willingness to speak in French and a grasp of the language that his predecessor never reached in his two years in charge. Emery won seven out of eight domestic trophies in his time at the helm, but his credit expired with Champions League exits against Barcelona and Real Madrid in the last 16. Tuchel's own experience of the highest level is limited, meaning many were surprised by his appointment. And he was not in the mood for making promises. ""It's too early to talk about it,"" said the German, who will not officially start work until pre-season training begins in early July. ""Of course we have the most exciting players, we are one of the biggest clubs in one of the most exciting cities, and this attracts the best players. ""But to be in the end where everybody wants to be, it's not about talking before the first training session has happened or the first game is played. ""I want to have an atmosphere where a Cup game is on the same level as a Champions League game. ""You cannot predict the results, so it makes no sense to talk too early, but if you ask me in spring I will tell you very clearly if we are ready or not."" Tuchel has admitted his admiration for Pep Guardiola, although he insisted he would impose his own style in Paris. He will wait anxiously in the hope that UEFA do not complicate his task by imposing sanctions for potential breaches of their Financial Fair Play rules. And he will hope that rumours over Neymar's possible departure after just one injury-hit season prove to be nothing more than that. In any case, Tuchel is in no doubt his limited track record will not prevent him from settling into a dressing room of stars, from the world's most expensive player to Kylian Mbappe, Thiago Silva and Marco Verratti. ""I am not afraid at all of stars because in my experience they are the hardest workers and know exactly what it takes to be successful. ""I am very happy to have the opportunity now to win titles with this kind of team."" At home, PSG's main rivals next season will be the same. Lyon and Monaco are boosted enormously by qualifying directly for the Champions League group stage, while Marseille will hope to be stronger again after falling just short, coming fourth in the league and losing the Europa League final. It remains to be seen how quickly Tuchel settles, but his side will be clear favourites to dominate in France again next season. He will not be as relaxed as this, though, if he oversees another poor showing in Europe."
465,20/05/2018,21:35,New PSG coach Tuchel relishes working with 'artist' Neymar,"New Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel insisted that Neymar is ""an artist"" and admitted that the world's most expensive player will need ""special treatment"" as he looked forward to starting his new role.","Tuchel was unveiled to the media at the Parc des Princes on Sunday evening, after his appointment on a two-year deal was confirmed last week. He will officially begin his new job in time for the start of pre-season training in July as he replaces Unai Emery, but the German has already met with Neymar. ""I met him last Sunday and it was a very good meeting. He's an artist, an exceptional player, one of the best in the world,"" said Tuchel, who was previously in charge at Borussia Dortmund but left a year ago and had been a free agent since. ""Artists are special players, they need special treatment, it's common sense."" Neymar joined PSG last August from Barcelona for a world-record fee of 222 million euros ($264 million). He won the French player of the year prize despite a foot injury meaning he has not featured for his club since the end of February. There has been constant speculation that the 26-year-old's stay in Paris could be a short one, with Real Madrid linked to a move for the Brazilian star. But PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has vehemently denied any suggestion that Neymar will depart after just one year in Ligue 1. Tuchel added: ""I met a very friendly, very open guy for the first time. We started talking about soccer and I saw a smile on his face and that is what I want to see. ""If we find a way to build a structure around him, so he can show all his talent on the pitch, I think we have a key player to win our games."" Tuchel spoke largely in impeccable English, although he did make an attempt to speak French, a language in which his predecessor Emery regularly struggled to get his message across. The new coach was reluctant to answer a question about Gianluigi Buffon, amid speculation that the veteran Italian goalkeeper could be Paris-bound after finishing his distinguished career with Juventus on Saturday. ""First of all we have to say I cannot imagine a Juventus without Buffon, but it is happening,"" said Tuchel. He is set to inherit his fellow German Kevin Trapp as well as Alphonse Areola, who indicated in an interview with Le Parisien this weekend that he could seek to leave the club if his position as first-choice 'keeper were jeopardised. ""I don't know him personally but we will see what happens,"" added Tuchel of Buffon. ""Right now we have two goalkeepers and we have to be patient, but first of all I personally have to adapt to there being no Buffon in the Italian team or in goal for Juventus."" Tuchel also insisted that he would settle for working with the squad currently in place, with PSG fresh from winning a domestic treble. ""If the transfer window closes now I am a happy person. I see the team has a lot of talent. ""I have no demands. First of all I trust the players and the people who built this team."" The threat of sanctions for potential breaches of UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules means PSG's room for manoeuvre in the transfer market could be limited, even if Al-Khelaifi told Sunday's edition of L'Equipe that any punishment would be ""surprising, abnormal and scandalous""."

Areola underlined his feelings about the situation when he told Le Parisien newspaper Saturday he wanted to ""remain number one"" at PSG and would leave the club if that were not to be the case next season. ""Because if I'm not the number one anymore, it would mean the season I've just finished has all counted for nothing,"" said the 25-year-old Areola, whose own deal ends in June 2019. PSG, who regained the French league title this month, will be taken over by coach Thomas Tuchel next season. He succeeds Spaniard Unai Emery."

""If I don't remain the first choice that would mean the season I've just had will be for nothing,"" added the 25-year-old who is part of France's squad for the World Cup. ""What happens next in my PSG career will be sorted out after the World Cup."" After splitting time with Kevin Trapp last season, Areola played every minute of PSG's Champions League campaign this term while keeping 16 clean sheets in 33 Ligue 1 appearances. ""For the moment, I haven't been in touch with management,"" Areola said. ""I don't know what they want to do. One thing is certain: if they give me the chance to stay at PSG, I will accept it without hesitation."" ""Now, if they don't let me have the same amount of playing time, things will certainly be different."" Reports in both France and Italy this week have suggested Buffon, 40, could move to PSG this summer after he announced he will leave Juventus at the end of the season."
469,14/05/2018,18:36,PSG confirm Thomas Tuchel as new coach,"Thomas Tuchel has been appointed as the new coach of Paris Saint-Germain on a two-year deal, the French champions confirmed on Monday.","The 44-year-old German has agreed to succeed Unai Emery, who will leave the Qatar-owned side after the final game of the French season this weekend. ""It is with much joy, pride and ambition that I am joining this big club,"" said Tuchel in a statement released by PSG. ""I can't wait to start working with all these great players who are all amongst the best in the world. ""Paris Saint-Germain has enormous potential and it is by far the most exciting proposition in football."" According to French sports daily L'Equipe, Tuchel was recommended directly to Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani by the Qatari consul in Germany. At one point linked to Arsenal before Arsene Wenger announced he would be leaving the Premier League club, Tuchel will begin his new role in early July with the start of pre-season training. It was an open secret that Tuchel had been lined up as the next coach of the ambitious club from the French capital. They had been on the look-out for a replacement for Emery since being beaten 5-2 on aggregate by Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League in March. That disappointment in Europe, following a humiliating loss against Barcelona at the same stage a year ago, meant there was no chance of Emery's two-year contract being renewed at the end of this campaign. Emery has nevertheless just overseen a clean sweep of the domestic honours in France this season, after winning the French Cup, League Cup and season-opening Champions Trophy in his first campaign. Tuchel was a free agent after leaving Borussia Dortmund a year ago, despite leading the team to victory in last season's German Cup. ""Thomas is one of the best and most competitive European coaches to have emerged over the last few seasons,"" declared PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi. ""He abides by very strong principles of playing spectacular and clinical football that has always been the foundation of German football, especially on the international scene. ""His competitive spirit, his preference for attacking football and his strong character are in line with what we have always wanted for Paris Saint-Germain."" Tuchel becomes the fifth different man to coach PSG since Qatar Sports Investments bought the club in 2011, following Antoine Kombouare, Carlo Ancelotti, Laurent Blanc and Emery. He will be tasked with ensuring that they continue to dominate at home while finally making a major impression in the Champions League, having failed to go beyond the quarter-finals in the Qatar era. Tuchel will also have to find a way of keeping Neymar happy, providing the world's most expensive player remains in France for a second season. However, Tuchel -- a modest player whose career was cut short by a knee injury -- is not yet proven as a coach at the highest level. He did an admirable job in charge of Mainz, before succeeding Jurgen Klopp at Dortmund in 2015. His first season saw Dortmund finish runners-up to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga and the German Cup, while losing to Klopp's Liverpool in the Europa League quarter-finals. Last season, Tuchel's side slipped to third in the Bundesliga and lost to Monaco in the Champions League quarter-finals, but they did beat Eintracht Frankfurt in the Cup final. A falling-out with the Dortmund hierarchy cost him as job, and he had been out of work since then. PSG wrapped up this season's Ligue 1 title with five games to spare. Emery, who on Sunday was named as France's coach of the year, will lead the side for the last time against Caen this weekend."
470,13/05/2018,23:33,"Neymar wins French player of the year prize, rejects transfer talk","Neymar was named as France's player of the year at an awards ceremony in Paris on Sunday, and later brushed away questions over his future.","The Paris Saint-Germain superstar took the prize despite missing the last three months of the season due to injury. The world's most expensive player scored 19 goals in just 20 league games for PSG before suffering a foot injury in February that required surgery in his native Brazil. He has not played since, and only returned to France from his homeland at the start of this month, fuelling speculation that he could seek to leave the club after just one season. ""I am very touched and very happy with our season. It is an honour. Without my teammates, I would never have received this award,"" said the 26-year-old, who collected the prize from his illustrious compatriot Ronaldo. Neymar, who joined in PSG's Ligue 1 title celebrations on Saturday night, refused to discuss his future after collecting his award. ""We talk about these things every time the transfer window comes around. I don't want to talk about anything at the moment,"" he said. ""Everyone knows why I came here, what my objectives are. Right now, my objective is the World Cup, not talking about transfers. ""I spend my whole life, every transfer window, talking about it. It's a bit annoying."" Neymar beat two of his PSG teammates to the prize, voted for by his fellow players -- Edinson Cavani, Ligue 1's leading scorer this season with 28 goals, and Kylian Mbappe were also nominees, along with Marseille winger Florian Thauvin. Neymar was signed from Barcelona for a world-record 222 million euros ($264 million) last August, and helped PSG on their way to a clean sweep of the domestic trophies. However, his injury appeared to cost Unai Emery's team dear in their Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid -- he was unable to play in the second leg, and PSG lost 5-2 on aggregate. He is hoping to be back to full fitness in time to lead Brazil at the World Cup in Russia, which starts in a month's time. Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi insisted on Saturday that there was no chance Neymar would be leaving. ""I am 2000 percent sure he will stay,"" Al-Khelaifi said, rejecting talk of a transfer to Real Madrid. ""The Spanish media have been talking since October. I don't respond to rumours, I don't have the time. But I am sure he will be a Paris Saint-Germain player."" PSG's dominance of the French game this season was reflected in the awards. Mbappe was named young player of the year, beating off competition from the Lyon duo of Houssem Aouar and Tanguy Ndombele, and Bordeaux's Brazilian winger Malcom. ""I have had a good season. I have changed universe. I had to adapt right away because at clubs like PSG you don't get given the time,"" said the 19-year-old Mbappe, who joined PSG from Monaco on a loan deal last August. That move is set to become permanent this summer for a fee of up to 180 million euros. Mbappe, who has scored 13 league goals, won the same award last year when he helped Monaco to the title, and so follows Eden Hazard in claiming the young player gong two seasons running. Now with Chelsea, Hazard won it in 2009 and 2010 when with Lille. Emery, who will leave PSG at the end of the season, won the coach of the year award."
471,11/05/2018,21:06,Neymar could return to training next week,Neymar's doctor Rodrigo Lasmar said on Friday that the injured Brazilian star could return to training as early as next week if he responds well to scheduled tests on Saturday.,"The 26-year-old has been out of action since breaking a bone in his right foot on February 25 and had surgery the following month, leaving Brazil fans sweating on their key player's fitness ahead of the World Cup which starts on June 14. ""The idea is that he can return to working on the field from next week provided that he responds favourably to tomorrow's test,"" Lasmar told some media, including AFP, in Paris. ""He's recovered well and his physical state has evolved as we expected it to from the beginning."" The Brazilian team doctor, in France for Neymar's tests, also ended up diagnosing the knee injury of PSG and Brazil right-back Dani Alves which ruled the 35-year-old out of the World Cup. French champions PSG host Rennes on Saturday, before their final game of the season against Caen on May 19. Neymar is not expected to play for his club again this term, although he will be at the Parc des Princes this weekend as PSG lift the Ligue 1 trophy. Brazil kick off their bid for a record-extending sixth World Cup on June 17 against Switzerland, with Tite's men also pitted against Costa Rica and Serbia in Group E."
472,09/05/2018,00:22,Minnows Les Herbiers run PSG close in French Cup final,Tiny Les Herbiers fell short of claiming one of the biggest upsets in football history but gave the mighty Paris Saint-Germain a game before losing 2-0 in Tuesday's French Cup final.,"Giovani Lo Celso scored PSG's opener in the first half at the Stade de France, breaking the resistance of Les Herbiers after they had been saved three times by the woodwork early on. PSG were then denied a second by a controversial call from the Video Assistant Referee, and they needed an Edinson Cavani penalty in the 74th minute to secure victory. It was a brave Les Herbiers performance, although it was never in any real doubt that PSG would win the trophy for the fourth year running and complete a clean sweep of France's domestic honours. Their season will still arguably be best remembered for their Champions League exit to Real Madrid in the last 16, and for the never-ending soap opera that is Neymar. The world's most expensive player was in attendance at the final, watching on as he continues his recovery from foot surgery two months ago. He later joined in the post-match celebrations. ""I am happy with our season,"" coach Unai Emery, who is out of contract and will not stay on for a third campaign, told Eurosport. ""We can also talk about the little negative things like the Champions League, but this year the team has played well, always trying to score goals."" This was perhaps the greatest mismatch in any Cup final in modern times, with the Qatar-owned PSG -- their revenue last year around 500 million euros ($596m) -- coming up against a side from the lower reaches of France's third division. Les Herbiers brought in the region of 15,000 fans -- around the same as the population of the small town in western France -- to enjoy themselves on a national holiday, and were greeted by scorching temperatures in Paris. They were not let down by their team, and Les Herbiers captain Sebastien Flochon was invited to join PSG skipper Thiago Silva in lifting the trophy at the end. ""I am very proud of my team. We hung on in there and avoided a hammering, and we might even have scored a goal at the end,"" Les Herbiers coach Stephane Masala told France 2. ""Paris are so strong, so fast, and they make all the right decisions. ""We wanted to stay in the game for as long as possible. It was a great final and we are proud that it was a good match."" Many PSG supporters spent their energy prior to kick-off whistling French President Emmanuel Macron -- a supporter of their sworn enemies Marseille -- as he greeted the teams on the pitch. Even without Neymar, their starting line-up still cost close to 400 million euros. In contrast, Les Herbiers are a club with a budget of two million euros and who could yet be relegated to the fourth division. Paris recently beat Monaco 7-1, so there were fears that Les Herbiers could find themselves on the end of a record scoreline. They kept the score down, although PSG hit the woodwork three times in the opening 20 minutes, twice from Lo Celso and once from Kylian Mbappe. Lo Celso then got the breakthrough in the 26th minute with a fine left-foot strike from 25 yards, and Les Herbiers were lucky not to go further behind five minutes into the second half. Mbappe followed in to score after Diaranke Fofana had deflected the ball onto his own bar, and wheeled away in celebration. However, the goal was eventually ruled out following intervention from the VAR, with Marquinhos penalised for a handball when in fact he might have been fouled in the area. The second goal eventually arrived in the 74th minute, Cavani dispatching a penalty for his 40th of the season after he had been brought down by goalkeeper Matthieu Pichot. PSG took the trophy, but Les Herbiers took the plaudits, celebrating their remarkable achievement in reaching the final with their fans at the end."
473,07/05/2018,16:12,Les Herbiers star set for Mbappe reunion in PSG Cup final,"When little Les Herbiers come up against Kylian Mbappe and co. in Tuesday's French Cup final clash with the mighty Paris Saint-Germain, they could be forgiven for freezing on the big stage.","Rarely has a showpiece game appeared such a mismatch as this, which will pit the third-division minnows against one of the most expensively-assembled sides in the history of the game. With Neymar still not fit, Mbappe will be the costliest player on show, with PSG committing 180 million euros ($215m) to sign the teenage sensation from Monaco. But not all of the unheralded Les Herbiers players will be star-struck, least of all little Rodrigue Bongongui. For the 25-year-old is looking forward to a reunion with Mbappe, who is almost six years his junior. The two crossed paths briefly at AS Bondy, a club from the Paris suburbs, only a short distance from the Stade de France where they will run out in front of as many as 80,000 fans on Tuesday evening. After Les Herbiers and PSG won through to the final last month, Bondy posted a picture on Instagram showing a smiling Mbappe, still an infant and wearing a red jacket, joining in a photo of Bongongui's team. ""I remember it. We were preparing for a home game with AS Bondy, the club where I grew up,"" Bongongui told AFP of the photo that was taken 15 years ago. ""Before each match we would often watch the young ones play. At that time I think he was with the 'poussins' (the youngest age group). ""That day, one of my best friends, who is closer to him, told him to get in the photo with us because he was just part of the family."" Fate has now brought them back together, albeit in different colours. After all, the two players are not in the same class, with Mbappe, despite his still tender years, already regarded as one of the finest forwards on the planet. ""We knew he was a future star and he has shown it. It makes us proud but it is not a surprise,"" said Bongongui. Mbappe is still a teenager but he has already won two French Ligue 1 titles, with Monaco last year and now PSG. He has starred in the latter stages of the Champions League and will go to the World Cup with France. ""He was highly coveted from a very young age. His parents deserve to be congratulated for all they have done to help him make the right choices,"" added Bongongui. ""Because there are plenty of players who are seen as future talents, but who never make it."" The considerable age gap means that the two players were never really close to one another. ""We haven't spoken since. I have followed him sometimes on Instagram, and his achievements at Monaco. ""I have followed it all from a distance, but in any case I knew he would become the great player he is now."" Bongongui's own career path has been modest, even if he joined Sedan a short while after the famous photo and went on to become a professional. He has played in the second division, most recently in the capital with Paris FC, but joined Les Herbiers in the third division last year. Their season has been split between trying to avoid relegation to the amateur fourth tier and going on a remarkable Cup run. And now Bongongui can look forward to seeing Mbappe again. ""In general we see him on TV, so now we can't wait to see what it will be like coming up against him in real life. ""We will see if he remembers me, because he was little, but of course I would like to exchange a few words with him, and maybe swap shirts as well."""

One photo showed him walking barefoot in a sand-covered area used by players returning from injury. Neymar flew back into France on Friday to rejoin the club after an operation on a broken foot bone in March. He has made clear that his main target is to be fit to play for Brazil in the World Cup in Russia, which kicks off in 40 days. The chances of Neymar adding to his 30 appearances this season for PSG, who paid 222 million euros ($263 million) for him last summer, seem slim. Neymar is expected to watch from the stands at the Stade de France on Tuesday when PSG take on third-division Les Herbiers in the French Cup final. He should then take part in the league title celebration next Saturday when PSG entertain Rennes at the Parc des Princes. After that, PSG have just one match, away to Caen on May 19. Brazil team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar, who operated on Neymar, told Folha, a Sao Paulo newspaper, that the goal is to have the player ""100 percent fit for the start of training camp"" in Brazil on May 21. Meanwhile, rumours over Neymar's future continue to swirl in Spain with sports daily Marca saying on Sunday that the striker wants ""to play with CR7"", that is Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid."

Senegal striker Konate levelled with a terrific low finish into the corner just two minutes after half-time. Christopher Nkunku fired Unai Emery's team back ahead on 64 minutes with a curling effort from the edge of the area, only to see Konate grab an equaliser on 80 minutes with his 12th goal this term. Amiens, promoted to the top flight for the first time last year, will return for a second season in Ligue 1 after the result left them 10 points clear of the relegation places with three matches to play. Nimes clinched their promotion from Ligue 2 with a 4-0 victory over Gazelec Ajaccio as they wrapped up second place in the division behind Reims. Nimes last played in the top tier of French football in the 1992/93 season."

""The date was scheduled to allow Marco Verratti to begin the 2018-2019 season in the best conditions."" The 25-year-old Verratti missed all of PSG's matches in April because of the injury. Italy's absence from the June 14-July 15 World Cup meant he could undergo the operation towards the end of the French league season. With PSG already crowned champions, the Italian will notably miss the French Cup final against third division Les Herbiers on Tuesday."
477,27/04/2018,13:45,PSG coach Emery says will leave at the end of the season,Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery said Friday he will leave the French club at the end of the campaign after Champions League failures in both his seasons in charge.,"Emery's two-year contract ends in June and he had been expected to leave anyway. He said he met with PSG's Qatari president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and sporting director Antero Henrique and ""we decided that we would not continue to work together"". ""I've told the players,"" Emery said at a press conference on Friday ahead of the league match against Guingamp on Sunday. The German Thomas Tuchel, without a club since his tumultuous departure from Borussia Dortmund in May 2017, is seen as the hot favourite to succeed Emery by French media. ""His immense passion for football and his commitment to the job have allowed the club to continue to anchor itself among the elite of French and international football,"" said Al-Khelaifi in a club statement. ""I congratulate Unai for his commitment to our project and I wish him, on behalf of the club, full success in the challenges that await him."" Spaniard Emery arrived having achieved continental success, winning the Europa League three years running with Sevilla. But his track record in the Champions League at Sevilla, as well as with Valencia and Spartak Moscow before that, had left much to be desired and Emery's time in France will forever be associated with failure in that competition. PSG had previously reached four consecutive quarter-finals following the Qatari takeover of the club in 2012, but Emery oversaw a humiliating defeat to Barcelona in the last 16 a year ago, losing 6-1 at the Camp Nou after a 4-0 win in the first leg. The club then committed to spending 400 million euros ($483 million) on Neymar and Kylian Mbappe alone -- the two most expensive transfer deals in history -- last year, but Paris were eliminated in the last 16 again this year, going out to Real Madrid. Those defeats suggested that, far from closing the gap to Europe's elite, PSG were going backwards. Under Emery, PSG lost their French title to Monaco before regaining it this season. The club won the French League Cup both seasons. They took the French Cup in 2017 and are back in the final this year where they face third-division Les Herbiers on May 8. ""To achieve its number one objective, which is the Champions League, the club first of all needs to be strong in France,"" said Emery, 46. ""This year we have won the club's seventh league title and we are only missing one to become the most successful club in France. ""I am sure that in the coming years, by continuing to win everything in France, the club will do it."" Asked if he had any regrets from his two years at the Parc des Princes, Emery added: ""I am very happy to have had the chance to work here. It is a great experience as a coach. ""This has been a good season but we still have the French Cup to left to win. ""We lost against Real but they are showing that they are maybe still the strongest team in Europe."" Emery's future is uncertain, although he has been linked with a return to Real Sociedad, the club from his native Basque Country whom he played for at the start of his career. ""I'm going to see what's best for my future,"" Emery said. ""I'm very focused for Sunday (and Guingamp) and the final of the French Cup. After that I'll see."" With four games of the Ligue 1 season remaining, PSG can still become the first team ever to get to 100 points in France's top flight."
478,22/04/2018,23:13,Lo Celso hits late winner for champions PSG,Giovani Lo Celso's late goal gave champions Paris Saint-Germain a hard-earned 1-0 win at Bordeaux in Ligue 1 on Sunday as they stayed on course to finish their season with a clutch of records.,"Argentine playmaker Lo Celso scored twice in last week's 7-1 demolition of Monaco that secured a fifth title in six seasons for PSG, and he smashed in the only goal of the game in Bordeaux with 14 minutes remaining. A corner came off Edinson Cavani and fell to Lo Celso, who drove a low, left-footed strike into the net from 20 yards to sink the home side. With Neymar still nowhere near a return from a foot operation, Paris also needed goalkeeper Alphonse Areola to be in inspired form at times to stave off Gustavo Poyet's Bordeaux, for whom the defeat all but ends their chances of qualifying for the Europa League. With 90 points, PSG are on course to break their own Ligue 1 points record of 96 set two years ago under Laurent Blanc, and they could yet become the first team to reach 100 points in the French top flight. They could also still beat RC Paris' record of 118 goals in a single season dating back to 1960, although they have 104 to their name and just four matches remaining. Elsewhere on Sunday, Robert Beric scored a second-half brace as Saint-Etienne came from behind to beat Troyes 2-1, continuing their remarkable revival since the turn of the year. Adama Niane had given relegation-threatened Troyes the lead early on at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, but Beric headed in the home side's equaliser in the 69th minute. The Slovenian striker, who had been introduced as a half-time substitute, then turned in a low centre by Romain Hamouma six minutes later to make it 2-1. That was his seventh league goal since being recalled from a loan spell at Anderlecht in January, and the win allowed Les Verts to extend their remarkable unbeaten run to 12 games. The turnaround at the 10-time former champions coincided with the appointment of veteran Jean-Louis Gasset as head coach. He has taken a team who were 16th in the table less than three months ago, up to sixth, just a point off a Europa League berth with four matches remaining. Nice are fifth after beating Montpellier 1-0."
479,22/04/2018,19:13,Former Brazil great Rivaldo advises Neymar to quit PSG,"Injured Brazil and Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar should leave France and resume his career in Spain if he wants to become the world's top player, former Brazil great Rivaldo said Sunday.","Rivaldo, who starred in the 1998 and 2002 World Cups, told GloboEsporte.com and Esporte Espetacular that while a return to Barcelona might be too complicated, Neymar should consider rivals Real Madrid. ""He could be the best in the world, but I think that if he stays at PSG he won't be,"" Rivaldo said, pointing out that a French club hasn't featured in a Champions League final since Monaco lost to Porto in 2004. ""He needs to leave PSG. The football he needs to become best in the world has to be in Spain,"" Rivaldo said. ""Barcelona, in his situation, is difficult. I think that judging by what I hear, by the information I get from people, that he has the chance to play at Real Madrid."" Neymar has had an up-and-down experience at PSG, since he was signed from Barcelona for a record 222 million euros ($264 million) last year, making him the world's most expensive player. He's currently recuperating in Brazil from surgery for a broken bone in his foot and is expected back in Paris in mid-May at the latest, a month before the World Cup starts. Spanish media have suggested he is eying a move to Real Madrid. However, according to the French League, there is no release clause in his contract with PSG."
480,22/04/2018,15:55,Neymar expected back in Paris in mid-May at latest,"Brazilian superstar Neymar is expected back in Paris a month before the World Cup begins in Russia, French media reported on Sunday.","Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar has been recovering in his homeland since undergoing surgery on a broken bone in his foot on March 3. He had been injured playing for PSG in a league match against Marseille on February 25, just before a crucial Champions League last 16 second-leg clash with Real Madrid. French newspaper L'Equipe said he will return to Paris in ""mid-May at the latest"" to take part in PSG's end of season celebrations. RMC radio, though, said he would be back in ""early May"" to complete his rehabilitation in Paris alongside his two physiotherapists. His injury sparked a club-versus-country tug-of-war as PSG wanted to try to get Neymar fit in time to play against Real while Brazil were eager to wrap him in cotton wool to ensure he is firing on all cylinders at the World Cup, starting on June 14. Brazil won that battle as Neymar went under the knife as PSG were sent crashing out of Europe. PSG's last match is on May 19 against Caen, after which they will celebrate their success in regaining the Ligue 1 title, winning the League Cup and perhaps also the French Cup -- they play third-tier Les Herbiers in the final on May 8. Earlier this week, Neymar said he was due to undergo tests on May 17 to determine whether he is fit to start playing again. It means he is almost certain to play no further part in PSG's season but that would leave him a month to regain match sharpness ahead of the World Cup, something he said on Tuesday he was confident of doing. ""I will arrive better than I was before,"" he said at a publicity even in Sao Paulo."
481,20/04/2018,18:56,No release clause in Neymar's PSG contract - French league,"There can be no release clause in Neymar's Paris Saint-Germain contract, the French league (LFP) insisted on Friday, in response to an earlier report in Spanish daily El Pais.","The article in El Pais claimed that a release clause -- worth no less than 300 million euros ($368 million) but whose exact value depended on certain results -- could be activated from September 1 if the Brazilian star wanted to leave PSG. Neymar moved to Paris last August from Barcelona when the French club activated his release clause at the Camp Nou by paying 222 million euros ($264 million), making him the world's most expensive player. But while such release clauses are commonplace in Spanish football, the French LFP's rules forbid their existence. ""Club directors cannot draw up contracts with a 'release clause', providing for a contractual relationship to be broken by one party or another in exchange for compensation, a 'termination clause' or a clause allowing for unilateral termination with a French or foreign player, either for the club or the player,"" according to the rule in question. A spokesperson for the LFP told AFP: ""There is therefore no such clause in the player's contract ratified by the legal commission of the LFP."" Rumours that Neymar could leave PSG in the next transfer window continue to abound while the player himself remains in Brazil, where he has been since undergoing surgery on a fractured foot at the start of last month. Spanish media have linked him with a move to Real Madrid. Spanish sports daily Marca have claimed that Neymar could leave PSG in the close season of 2019 for 222 million euros, the same fee for which he arrived from Barcelona."
482,20/04/2018,18:07,PSG plead Financial Fair Play case to UEFA,"Paris Saint-Germain officials were at UEFA's headquarters in Nyon on Friday to plead their case in a Financial Fair Play (FFP) investigation, following reports that the French club risked sanctions.","PSG's general manager Jean-Claude Blanc was one of those seen arriving at around 2:15pm (1215 GMT) and leaving almost three hours later. They did not stop to speak to gathered media. A UEFA spokesperson said a decision was expected ""at the start of June"". UEFA opened an investigation into the newly-crowed French champions' compliance with FFP rules at the start of this season, just weeks after they completed deals to sign Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. Neymar arrived for a world-record fee of 222 million euros ($264 million) from Barcelona, while the club also signed Mbappe on loan from Monaco but with an agreement to sign the teen sensation in a 180 million-euro deal at the end of this campaign. A report by British newspaper the Financial Times last week claimed that Qatar-owned PSG faced sanctions for breaching FFP rules with ""overstated"" sponsorship contracts to the tune of 200 million euros. PSG have numerous deals with Qatari sponsors, including with telecommunications firm Ooredoo and the Qatar National Bank. Introduced by European football's governing body in 2010, FFP limits clubs to making losses of no more than 30 million euros over three seasons. PSG have already fallen foul of FFP. The club were fined 60 million euros in prize money earned from playing in the Champions League in 2014. Back then UEFA deemed PSG had artificially inflated their income using a sponsorship deal with another Qatari state-owned enterprise, the Qatar Tourism Authority. A repeat offence could mean a more serious punishment, including in the worst case potentially being exluded from UEFA competitions. However, the club from the French capital have been making moves to attract new sponsors, including a deal announced last month with Asian sports marketing firm Desports, which PSG have called ""a groundbreaking multimillion euro agreement""."
483,17/04/2018,21:24,Neymar says out of action until at least May 17,"Brazilian superstar Neymar said Tuesday that he won't be back playing at least until the second half of May, when he is scheduled to have his final medical exam following foot surgery.","""The last exam is on May 17 and from there I will see,"" the Paris Saint-Germain and Brazil forward told a press conference in Sao Paulo. ""It has not been decided."" The timing leaves the world's most expensive footballer in a tight race to feature again for PSG with the freshly crowned French champion's season ending on May 19 with a game against Caen. However, his prospects for starring in Brazil's much fancied side at the World Cup in Russia, which runs from June 14 to July 15, look good. ""I hope I won't watch the World Cup on TV,"" Neymar joked, calling the tournament a ""dream"". ""I will have enough time to prepare,"" he said. ""It's evolving well."" With the enforced rest period Neymar, added, ""I will arrive better than I was before."""
484,16/04/2018,10:58,PSG must keep building says Emery after French title romp,Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery said the club must continue to strengthen as the French champions try to transform their dominance at home into success in the Champions League.,"Angel Di Maria and Giovani Lo Celso scored twice as PSG secured a fifth Ligue 1 title in six seasons on Sunday with a 7-1 rout of last year's champions Monaco. Unai Emery's team blew Monaco away in a first-half blitz that saw PSG score four times in 14 minutes at the Parc des Princes with with Lo Celso striking either side of goals from Edinson Cavani and Di Maria. Rony Lopes pulled a goal back for Monaco as he scored for the eighth game in a row, but Di Maria added a fifth before Radamel Falcao turned into his own net and Julian Draxler struck late on as PSG romped to the club's seventh championship. ""Other teams have more titles than us. Monaco, Nantes, Saint-Etienne, Marseille, Lyon...but we must keep on building,"" Emery, who is likely to be replaced in the summer, told Canal+. ""There is a solid tool for the future, to remain number one in France and become that elsewhere with patience and hard work."" With a fifth successive League Cup already won, PSG completed the second leg of a domestic treble -- they are also through to the French Cup semi-finals -- and could yet break their record 96-point haul from the 2015-16 campaign. PSG also became the first team in Europe's top leagues this season to reach 100 goals on a night they were without the injured Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, the teenager left on the bench after a bout of illness. But a second successive last 16 exit in the Champions League means heads will roll at the end of this season in preparation for another attempt to muscle in among Europe's elite. ""That defeat (to Real Madrid) hurt us but we continued to work with the players, the staff and the president who is always at our side,"" said PSG captain Thiago Silva. ""It was a difficult moment but I think in the end it's a good season. We have taken back our title but we must continue to work, we have a French Cup semi-final (against Caen) on Wednesday."" Monaco arrived in Paris unbeaten on their last eight league visits to the capital but any prospect of them prolonging PSG's wait for the title quickly eroded. Kamil Glik's absence in the heart of the visiting defence was acutely felt as Lo Celso started the move that resulted in the opening goal on 14 minutes, sauntering into the box to tap in a Dani Alves cross. While Cavani's second half of the campaign has proved less prolific than the blistering spell that yielded 19 goals before Christmas, the Uruguayan bagged his league-best 25th goal with a powerful header from a Yuri Berchiche cross. Cavani then released Di Maria with a superb hooked pass from inside his own half and the Argentine raced clear before lifting an exquisite chip over the advancing Danijel Subasic. Javier Pastore supplied Lo Celso to head in PSG's fourth on 28 minutes and Monaco suffered further misfortune when France international Djibril Sidibe was stretchered off with a leg injury, a worrying sign for Didier Deschamps ahead of the World Cup. Monaco briefly held up the onslaught as Lopes turned home an Almamy Toure cross seven minutes before half-time for the in-form Portugal international's 13th goal this term. But PSG continued to attack at will and Pastore's nonchalant assist for Di Maria allowed the winger to grab his second of the game on 59 minutes. The hosts were gifted another goal when Falcao's attempt to clear a corner went horribly wrong, summing up Monaco's misery as the ball looped beyond Subasic on 77 minutes. Germany international Draxler rounded out the demolition, firing home via a deflection as PSG clinched the title at home for the first since 1994 while shattering Monaco's 17-match unbeaten run. Monaco later tweeted that they would reimburse the fans who had made the fruitless trip to the capital."
485,15/04/2018,23:36,"PSG secure title, but thoughts already on summer of change","It may have felt in many respects as though Paris Saint-Germain's season ended a month ago, but this Sunday they find themselves celebrating reclaiming the French title, their second trophy in a fortnight.","While Neymar is still absent recovering from an operation on a fractured foot, Unai Emery's side took back the Ligue 1 crown in the best possible fashion, demolishing last year's champions Monaco. A near flawless run of domestic form over the last three months comfortably saw off their nearest rivals, and Sunday's thumping triumph followed a 3-0 win over Monaco in the League Cup final at the end of March. To their credit, PSG have not wallowed in self-pity since their defeat to Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League in early March, just after the crushing blow of losing Neymar to injury. ""The defeat against Real Madrid was a big defeat, but apart from that I am very happy with what the team has produced this season,"" said Emery recently. After being denied by Monaco last year, there was never really any doubt that PSG would reclaim the crown this time. They have been top since August. Champions for the fifth time in six seasons, Emery's team are on course to set a new points record. There have been only two defeats, against Strasbourg and Lyon. ""The league title is very important to me. It is the main competition and it shows how consistent a team is,"" Emery said this week. ""The club wants to progress, improve, become the best in the world."" There is certainly merit to be had in dethroning Monaco, but the principality side effectively accepted defeat at the end of August when they allowed Kylian Mbappe to move to the capital, just a few weeks after Neymar was signed for a world record fee of 222 million euros ($264 million). Qatar-owned PSG's budget is about that of Lyon, Monaco and Marseille -- their three biggest rivals -- combined. Perspective is therefore necessary. PSG have now won as many domestic honours in seven years of Qatar ownership as in the previous 41 years of their history, and they can still win this season's French Cup. But their financial might -- even regardless of the threat of UEFA sanctions for breaches of Financial Fair Play -- ensures the playing field is so uneven at home, and the Champions League is their holy grail. A second successive exit in the last 16 means heads will roll at the end of this season in preparation for a new attempt to definitively become part of the European elite. Emery's contract is due to expire and the Spaniard will not be kept on. With their credibility on the line, Qatar Sports Investments cannot afford to get it wrong when it comes to naming a successor. But having been linked with the likes of Antonio Conte, Luis Enrique, even Jose Mourinho, instead it seems that Thomas Tuchel will be the chosen one. Given Tuchel's profile -- a free agent since leaving Borussia Dortmund last year, with just one major trophy as a coach and little European pedigree -- appointing the 44-year-old German may surprise many. The new man's biggest job will be learning to get along with Neymar, a brilliant player but one whose off-field antics are frequently in the headlines. That is assuming Neymar remains in Paris for a second season, amid constant speculation of a move away, possibly to Real Madrid. Other players will certainly leave, with the likes of Thiago Motta and Javier Pastore possibly having won their last Ligue 1 title. ""I have spoken to Neymar. He doesn't know yet when he will be back, but the project here is with Neymar, of course,"" captain Thiago Silva told TF1 on Sunday. ""I am sure the project here will carry on for us to try to make our dream come true."""

The Brazilian has been in his home country recovering from a foot operation and PSG are hoping to have him back before the end of the season. ""I still need a month to make a full recovery,"" Neymar told Brazilian television on Friday. But they should be champions well before any possible return date for the world's most expensive player, and beating Monaco would be the perfect way to seal the deal. It would come a year after the side from the principality finished eight points clear of PSG at the summit in a campaign which also saw them reach the Champions League semi-finals. ""Knowing that we can be champions at home, against our main rivals this season and the team that kidnapped the title from us last season, is an exciting moment,"" defender Marquinhos told PSG TV. PSG's campaign has been overshadowed by their defeat against Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, but they are on course for a clean sweep of the domestic trophies. Unai Emery's side have a 100 percent home record and if they can keep that up they will be able to celebrate the seventh title in their history on Sunday. PSG have won their last five meetings with Leonardo Jardim's side too, including a 3-0 victory in the recent League Cup final, when Kylian Mbappe ran his old club ragged. The 19-year-old will make his loan move permanent in a 180 million-euro ($222 million) deal at the end of this season, when PSG will hope to spend big again to rebuild for another assault on Europe. PSG have two key doubts with midfield general Marco Verratti injured groin while striker Kylian Mbappé is sick. ""Marco is working with the doctor, we don't want a relapse and Kylian didn't train yesterday with a poorly stomach,"" coach Unai Emery said Friday. Ex-Borussia Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel emerged as favourite to take over from Emery in the PSG dugout this week. In the meantime, Emery has the chance to bow out of Paris with a league title, although they will not be taking the Monaco of Radamel Falcao and the in-form Rony Lopes lightly. ""Of course, we have a lot of respect for them, but we will be at home and to have the chance to be champions again, against the reigning champions, is exciting for us, and especially for the supporters,"" Thiago Motta told PSG TV. Beneath the top two Lyon and Marseille are locked, level on points, in a fierce battle for third place and the final Champions League qualifying berth. Lyon, with Memphis Depay in superb form, have recovered from a sticky patch and sit ahead of Marseille on goal difference. OL host Amiens while Marseille travel to struggling Troyes. He can blow hot and cold, but the Dutchman really has been in superb form, and with it Lyon have hauled themselves right back into contention for a top-three finish. Depay scored one and set up the rest in Lyon's 5-0 win at Metz last weekend, having netted a brace in a 2-0 defeat of Toulouse before that. ""He is staying here, all the time, my children,"" said Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas, attempting an answer in English, when asked on French television last weekend if he would ever sell the Dutchman to Real Madrid."
489,10/04/2018,14:17,PSG seem set to bet on unproven Tuchel,"Thomas Tuchel is not a big-name coach, he has won few trophies and has never managed a squad of stars, but French and German media agree that he will probably succeed Unai Emery at Paris Saint-Germain.","The German website SportBuzzer reports that the 44-year-old Bavarian has already signed a two-year contract. In France, the sports daily L'Equipe quibbled over the details, saying it is ""premature to say the deal is signed"" but ""it's only a question of timing"", probably at the end of the season. Emery appears to be merely biding his time in the PSG hotseat after the crushing elimination from the Champions League at the hands of Real Madrid. Tuchel's modest playing career peaked early with a handful of matches for Stuttgart Kickers in the German second division in 1992-93. He went on to coach Mainz and Borussia Dortmund, winning the German Cup after succeeding the highly successful Jurgen Klopp. Tuchel was recommended to the camp of emir Tamim ben Hamad al Thani by the Qatari consul to Germany, L'Equipe reported. He would be the first German to lead PSG. Tuchel has been without a club since his tumultuous departure from Dortmund in May 2017 after a series of public disagreements with the club's chief executive. Bayern Munich tapped up Tuchel recently as a possible successor to 72-year-old Jupp Heynckes, who insists he will not stay. But Tuchel ""was already signed with a club,"" said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. This interest from big clubs shows Tuchel's standing despite his lack of trophies. That German Cup run included a 3-2 victory over Bayern Munich in a crazy semifinal. He also led Dortmund to second behind Bayern in the Bundesliga in 2016. Tuchel is famed for his passion for tactics. Niko Kovac, who manages Eintracht Frankfurt, the losing team in last year's German Cup final, called Tuchel a ""chorus master"" and praised his ""genius for playing different systems week after week."" Tuchel also has a reputation for man management, especially with younger players, and attracted attention at Dortmund for the spectacular way he developed such rising stars as Ousmane Dembele, now at Barcelona, US international Christian Pulisic and Julian Weigl. But Tuchel reportedly had difficulties with veteran players he wanted to phase out. This profile as a tactician and demanding, even authoritarian, coach calls to mind Pep Guardiola who works at Manchester City for the Emiratis, the great regional rivals of the Qataris, and is poised to add the Premier League title to his collection of titles. Guardiola has won the Champions League. Tuchel has never progressed beyond the last eight of the trophy PSG's owners most covet. Emery arrived in Paris with three Europa League titles but remains the man responsible for the ""Remontada"" when PSG blew a 4-0 lead against Barcelona, losing the second leg 6-1 last March. One reason offered for Emery's difficulties in Paris is a lack of experience handling a squad of stars. Tuchel had Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, a star with a big ego in Dortmund who is now at Arsenal, but PSG has a dressing room full of divas. Neymar's entourage reportedly pushed for Luis Enrique, the former Barcelona coach who won the Champions League with the Brazilian in his team in 2015. Meanwhile veterans such as Thiago Silva, and the Italian playmaker Marco Verratti, have let it be known that they favoured the return of Carlo Ancelotti, who managed the Paris club from 2011 to 2013. SportsBuzzer says Tuchel is already working on what he needs to do at PSG. But history suggests he won't have much time to show he can do better than Laurent Blanc who took PSG to the Champions League quarter-finals in 2015 and 2016 and was fired in June 2016. For PSG, Tuchel represents another long-odds bet, but the prize, for both sides, remains huge."
490,05/04/2018,17:43,PSG on cusp of title as race for Europe escalates,Paris Saint-Germain could secure a fifth Ligue 1 title in six seasons this weekend as Unai Emery's runaway leaders continue their assault on a record-breaking points tally in France.,"PSG can clinch the club's seventh league crown with a victory at Saint-Etienne on Friday if defending champions Monaco lose at home to Claudio Ranieri's Nantes 24 hours later. With a fifth successive League Cup in the bag, PSG are on the verge of completing the second leg of a domestic treble -- they are also through to the French Cup semi-finals -- and could yet shatter their record 96-point haul from the 2015-16 campaign. ""We want to win, to carry on with our work and along our path. We're going to continue with the aim of winning to show our strength,"" said Emery, whose side have 83 points and seven matches still to play. ""We want to keep going as well to become champions and to collect as many points as possible."" PSG will be without Marco Verratti, Julian Draxler and Dani Alves for the trip to Saint-Etienne, who have thrust themselves back into contention for Europe on the back of a nine-match unbeaten run. ""We're not scared of anything. Everything is possible. That's what is great about football,"" said Saint-Etienne boss Jean-Louis Gasset, an assistant at PSG under Laurent Blanc. ""I hope to see a sold-out stadium. I knew what this ground was like as an opponent: it's a pressure cooker."" As for the injured Alves, he became the most decorated footballer in history -- surpassing fellow Brazilian and former PSG defender Maxwell -- after lifting the 36th trophy of his career following last weekend's League Cup defeat of Monaco. A stuttering run of one win in eight games heavily compromised Nantes' Europa League ambitions, but a stoppage-time goal from Lucas Lima did hand them a 1-0 victory over Monaco in November. ""It will be a big match for us. I want to see how we react after the (3-0 loss) against Saint-Etienne. I want to see the character of my players, their strength,"" said Ranieri ahead of Saturday's visit to the principality. Monaco extended their unbeaten league run to 16 matches in Wednesday's 1-1 draw at Rennes, but coach Leonardo Jardim admitted his side were not at their best just four days after losing another final to PSG. ""Fatigue is something we're used to. We can talk about a poor match rather than tired legs at Rennes,"" said Jardim. ""The team wasn't tired the first 30 minutes and it was the worst period. We should have done more."" Monaco hold a five-point cushion over Marseille in the fight for the second automatic Champions League spot, although they must still go to Paris on April 15. Jardim is hopeful Keita Balde and Joao Moutinho will return on Saturday, but Stevan Jovetic is uncertain as he battles a calf problem. Marseille host Montpellier on Sunday with goalkeeper Steve Mandanda unlikely to play again this season after he was ruled out for up to six weeks with a thigh problem. Lyon, in fourth, trail Marseille by two points and will try to maintain their Champions League pursuit at rock-bottom Metz, while fifth-placed Rennes head to Nice. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
491,01/04/2018,13:07,Emery insists PSG are going well and growing stronger,"Despite their elimination from the Champions League, Paris Saint-Germain are ""going well"" said coach Unai Emery, while defending his record, after his team won the French League Cup final.","PSG beat Monaco 3-0 in Bordeaux on Saturday night in a final that created more debate over video replay, was followed by messages of congratulation from PSG's injured superstar, Neymar, and was accompanied by violence off the pitch which left four policemen hurt. ""I believe the club is going well,"" Emery said after PSG won the trophy for a fifth straight time. ""It's stronger now to make history here in France and then to continue to grow abroad, in Europe and in the rest of the world."" Yet the main target this season had been Europe rather than a fourth domestic league title. The second straight elimination in the last 16 of the Champions League makes it unlikely his contract, which runs out in June, will be renewed. Names of potential successors at PSG have begun to leak out with several French media saying the German Thomas Tuchel was the favourite. ""Even if there is a very, very solid project it can be difficult to keep patience,"" said Emery. ""It's necessary to have patience and consistency."" Neymar, the club's biggest star, sent his congratulations from Brazil, where he is recuperating from foot surgery, singling out Dani Alves. Both should be part of the Brazil squad at the World Cup that starts on June 14. Neymar posted a photo of the 34-year-old defender, who won his 36th trophy on Saturday, standing next to a collection of cups with the headline ""Greatest champion in history."" In the accompanying text, mixing Portuguese and French, the striker wrote: ""Congratulations to all, very happy for you!!! ALLEZ PARIS @psg @danialves this congratulations is more special for you brother, for whom trophies are part of this your history .. hopefully more will come, including July. I love you idol!"" Neymar also posted a video of the fourth-minute penalty kick by Edinson Cavani that put PSG ahead. Earlier this season, the two men fought over who should take a spot kick. The penalty on Saturday followed a three-minute delay for video review after Monaco centre-back Kamil Glik brought down Kylian Mbappe. Later in the first half, Monaco had a goal by Radamel Falcao ruled out on review for a tight offside. Even though video review benefited his team, PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe was uneasy. ""Today, it went in our favour, so we are going to say that we are happy, but the video is a problem,"" Kimpembe said. The delay meant the ""players got cold, everyone was waiting, it was rather a pain in the neck."" Colombian striker Falcao was unhappy. ""I don't know what the referee could have seen on his video screen to give the penalty,"" the Monaco captain said. ""This type of decision could kill football, above all when it isn't clear cut, notably for offside. We lost four minutes and then the referee only played two minutes of added time at the end of the first half."" The violence off the field involved confrontations between rival groups of PSG fans and supporters of both clubs and the police. The match ""was the scene of many clashes between the police and the supporters of the two teams who came to Bordeaux to fight,"" the French police union said in a statement, adding that four officers from special units were hurt, ""some seriously."""
492,01/04/2018,13:01,Klinsmann suggests PSG should stick with Emery,Former Germany coach Jurgen Klinsmann reckons Paris Saint-Germain are better off sticking with Unai Emery as coach next season.,"Rumours abound that the Spaniard's time at the Parc des Princes is up after PSG's latest Champions League failure. Names touted as possible successors after PSG's last 16 exit to Real Madrid included German Thomas Tuchel, but for Klinsmann the Qatari-backed side are best off with Emery. ""Looking at things from the outside I'd say the best idea is to continue as they are, to keep their manager. Even if Tuchel is a superb coach I don't see any reason for them to change,"" Klinsmann told AFP. Klinsmann was speaking at Bordeaux on Saturday night where he attended the French League Cup final with PSG beating Monaco 3-0. Emery's contract runs out in June, with Tuchel suggested by French sports daily l'Equipe and RMC radio as the best placed to take over. ""Tuchel is very talented,"" added the 1990 World Cup winner. ""There is no doubt about that. But I think Paris already has a great coach. Emery is in the process of doing a fantastic job."" Saturday's win leaves a clean sweep of the domestic trophies for the third time in four seasons on the cards for PSG, although that will not completely make up for the disappointment of another underwhelming campaign in the Champions League."

Kylian Mbappe was a constant menace and perhaps the difference between the two sides, as his current team beat his former club for the second successive final after last year's 4-1 victory. ""Tonight there was a great Kylian on the other side, he was the difference in the game,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. ""I think we played with the right attitude, always tried to look for a goal after the penalty."" The capital club's win also extended their all-time record amount of League Cup crowns to eight and stretched their winning streak in domestic Cup competitions to 40 matches since a French Cup defeat by Montpellier in January 2014. The holders were awarded a spot-kick after only four minutes, as Polish centre-back Kamil Glik brought down Mbappe. After a three-minute wait for the decision to be confirmed by VAR, Cavani stepped up to beat Subasic and grab his 34th goal of the season. Monaco responded well and Belgian midfielder Youri Tielemans fired over after some quick build-up play. But PSG doubled their advantage in the 21st minute as Mbappe set Di Maria through on goal with a wonderful pass, and the Argentinian international fired a low shot under goalkeeper Subasic to score for the third League Cup final in a row. Rony Lopes wasted a golden opportunity for Monaco to halve the deficit as he chipped wide with only PSG goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to beat. Just seconds later it was Cavani's turn to squander a magnificent chance, miskicking off target after Mbappe had laid the ball on a plate for him with the goal gaping. Trapp's blushes were spared shortly afterwards, as after his error allowed a Radamel Falcao header to drop into the net, VAR ruled the goal out for offside. Jardim's Monaco put up a much better fight than 12 months ago, and Portuguese winger Lopes came agonisingly close early in the second half when his curling effort flicked the top of the crossbar. Mbappe, who joined PSG from Monaco in a 180-million-euro deal last year, continued to look dangerous but proved wasteful in front of goal as he prodded past the post just two minutes after Subasic had saved at his feet. But the 19-year-old continued to create opportunities, and it was his jinking run which ended with Cavani slotting into the corner. The striker has now scored eight goals in French League Cup finals, after previous doubles in 2014, 2015 and last year."

UEFA said this is punishment for fans throwing fireworks onto the pitch during the second leg of their last-16 tie with Real. They were also sanctioned for fans using a laser pointer and were fined a total of 43,000 euros ($53,000). Marseille were slapped with a ban on their fans travelling to their next two away matches in Europe after supporters were involved in violence in the Europa League game at Athletic Bilbao.

Mbappe confidently swept in a first-time finish on 12 minutes after a brilliant ball in behind the defence by Julian Draxler. The teenager netted his second on 26 minutes after Layvin Kurzawa pulled the ball back from the byline, with Mbappe lifting his league goals tally to 13 for the season. With his team just four points above the relegation zone, Angers coach Stephane Moulin had made no secret of prioritising Saturday's home game against Caen over the trip to the capital. That approach was underpinned by the decision to leave top scorer Karl Toko Ekambi on the bench in Paris, although the Cameroonian bagged his 15th goal of the campaign after coming on with half an hour to play. Mbappe nearly completed his hat-trick with seven minutes remaining but his effort smacked back off the post, while PSG goalkeeper Kevin Trapp denied Toko Ekambi an equaliser right at the end. A 16th successive home league win leaves Unai Emery's side 17 points clear of second-placed Monaco, who face PSG in the League Cup final at the Stade de France on March 31."
496,13/03/2018,20:27,Neymar 'has a future' at Paris Saint-Germain - father,Neymar's father and the head of Paris Saint-Germain both poured cold water Tuesday over rumors that the world's most expensive footballer wants to quit the French club after returning from injury.,"""Neymar already has a future at PSG, Neymar already has a present at PSG,"" Neymar Santos Sr told journalists at his son's charity center, the Neymar Junior Institute, in Praia Grande, Sao Paulo state. With the superstar striker out for weeks while he recuperates from foot surgery, reports have emerged in the European media that Neymar is disenchanted with PSG and wants to return to his old club Barcelona -- or even make a shock move to arch rivals Real Madrid. Without the injured Neymar, PSG went crashing out of the Champions League to Real Madrid in the last 16 this month. PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, his sports director Antero Henrique and club spokesman Jean-Martial Ribes visited the 26-year-old at his luxury house near Brazil's coast on Monday and his charity institute on Tuesday. Their trip had been planned far in advance of the current uproar, Ribes told AFP. However the meeting, which Neymar Sr recorded with photos on his Instagram feed, couldn't help having something of the look of a crisis summit. Emerging in front of reporters at the institute, both sides seemed keen to quash the speculation. Neymar ""is happy, highly motivated and excited to come back as soon as possible,"" Al-Khelaifi said. However, journalists were told that they could not ask about the Real Madrid rumors. Neymar fractured a bone in his right foot on February 25 and faces a lengthy lay-up following surgery in early March. Brazilian team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar has said that Neymar -- transferred to PSG from Barcelona after the French club paid his 222 million-euro ($264 million) buyout clause last August -- will need at least two and a half months, maybe three, to return to action. PSG still hopes to get him back before the end of its season. ""Everybody is doing his best to come back as soon as possible, without any risk for sure,"" Al-Khelaifi said. ""But the doctors are going to say. I'm not in a position to say exactly when he will come back. The doctors are following and it depends on recovery, but I think he's in good shape,"" the club president said. Brazil's national team are hoping he will be back to full fitness in time to help lead them at the World Cup starting in Russia on June 14. Experts say that while Neymar will be short of match practice, he could benefit by arriving at the tournament fresher than his rivals."

""This is not the first time. He needs to improve his temperament,"" said Emery. ""He needs to control his feelings, especially in the big matches. He's a player with a lot of personality and we have spoken to him about it,"" added Emery, whose side were reduced to 10 men whilst trying to overturn a deficit against Real Madrid. ""But he's getting better and he's a very important player for us both now and for the future."" ""He will continue to develop,"" Emery said of the 25-year-old who has played 154 games for PSG and 24 times for Italy. Verratti took a huge amount of media flack after PSG's 5-2 aggregate defeat by Real with Italian daily La Gazzetta dello Sport writing ""he is incapable of keeping a cool head"", an issue it said would also compromise his international career."
498,09/03/2018,19:03,Embattled Emery still believes in PSG blueprint,Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery insisted Friday he still believed in the Qatari owners' blueprint for the club but refused to speculate whether he would be part of their plans.,"In his first press conference since PSG's limp exit from the Champions League at the hands of Real Madrid, Emery faced a barrage of questions about his future. ""Right now, I am part of the project and I am working as if I am going to be here for the rest of my life,"" the Spaniard said. French sports daily L'Equipe reported Friday that Chelsea coach Antonio Conte is being lined up to replace Emery. ""I don't think about my future. My concern is to prepare for the next match,"" Emery said. ""PSG is a sound project. The people within that project could change, but the project itself is sound."" PSG, who have a 14-point lead at the top of Ligue 1, face Metz on Saturday. Emery said it was ""normal"" that he face criticism for PSG's failure to progress further than the last-16 of the Champions League despite effectively spending 400 million euros on Neymar and 19-year-old French striker Kylian Mbappe last summer. ""The most important thing is the analysis that we can carry out within the club about what happened, and what we can change to make progress,"" Emery said. The absence of Neymar with a broken foot bone hampered the Parisians in the second leg as they went down 2-1 at the Parc des Princes and lost 5-2 on aggregate. PSG's Qatari owners had set a target of winning Europe's top club prize by this year, but the team has failed to break into Europe's elite."

""Despite police warnings on the duty of the club to prevent such incidents, which follow several similar and regrettable occurrences at the PSG-Nice game on 27 October 2017 and, more recently, the PSG-Marseille match on February 2018, it is not acceptable that the same things were allowed to happen in a match of such importance,"" said the police. The statement said that the police had sent a letter the day after the match to remind PSG of their obligation ""to prevent the introduction and use of smoke makers and fireworks in Parc des Princes"". It added that police chief Michel Delpuech ""will soon receive the directors of PSG to draw up a plan to stop such excesses"". On Thursday, UEFA, the governing body of European football, said it was opening an enquiry into the events at the match in which PSG was eliminated from Europe."
500,09/03/2018,14:28,Neymar wants Barcelona return - Spanish reports,"Neymar already regrets moving to Paris Saint-Germain and is seeking a shock return to Barcelona, according to reports in the Spanish media on Friday.","In the same week that PSG crashed out of the Champions League, and only seven months after he joined the club for a world record 222million euros ($264 million, Neymar´s future has become uncertain. Spanish sports newspaper Mundo Deportivo claims the Brazilian, recovering from surgery on a broken foot in Brazil, has made contact with Barca to ask how he can engineer a return. The article adds Neymar has explained he made a mistake in leaving the club, was wrong to want independence from Lionel Messi and has been disappointed by the standard of opposition in Ligue 1. Barca, however, is not the only club Neymar is reportedly targeting as a potential way out of PSG. Madrid-based newspaper AS reports Neymar´s father has met with Real Madrid, who are ready to pay 400million euros to sign the striker. Asked about the speculation on Friday, Real coach Zinedine Zidane said: ""Neymar could play in all the clubs because he is very good, like many players. ""I´m not going to talk about a player that is not mine. On the 400 million, they paid 220 million and when they bought me they paid 72. ""It seemed crazy to me and 10 years later they are paying 220 million. It can be that in the next 10 years someone will pay 400m, or sooner, I do not know."" Mundo Deportivo concedes Neymar´s courting of Barcelona may even be a tactic to justify a move to Real, given the Catalan club are likely to reject any chance to re-sign the 26-year-old. Barcelona are still embroiled in a financial dispute over a bonus due to Neymar last summer, which the club cancelled when they believe it became clear he was moving to PSG. Neymar missed PSG's last 16 loss to Real on Tuesday after undergoing surgery on a broken foot in Brazil last week."
501,09/03/2018,01:45,"Down and out in Europe, PSG resume domestic duties",Embattled Unai Emery's Paris Saint-Germain must put aside the pain from their prosaic Champions League exit to drag their focus back to domestic affairs with an unglamourous Ligue 1 tie against Metz on Saturday.,"Their European ambitions are again in tatters after Tuesday's 2-1 loss to Real Madrid. To add insult to injury, European football's governing body UEFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against PSG for the spate of smoke bombs and a laser deployed by their supporters during the match at the Parc des Princes. Emery's expensively-assembled Qatari-backed team host the club propping up the table with a nagging cloud over Neymar's future. Having broken a foot bone in a league match against Marseille, the 222-million-euro marquee signing watched Tuesday's game in Brazil where he is recovering from surgery. PSG's Brazilian defender Marquinhos urged his close friend to stay put at the Parc des Princes with rumours rife that Real Madrid are prepared to break the bank to attract the former Barcelona player back to Spain. ""I ask him to stay and let things settle down,"" Marquinhos said. ""He is an important player for us. We really need him to have confidence in our project, our players and our coaches."" With his contract up at the end of the season and expected to be shown the door, Emery will at least want to walk away his head held high having delivered PSG's seventh Ligue 1 title, while his team are also still in both Cup competitions. A scripted success against modest Metz will hardly lessen the gloom at PSG, but anything other than three points will cast further doubt on the direction of the club since Qatar Sports Investment bought them in 2011. PSG's yawning 14-point lead could be cut to 11 if Monaco make the most of their Friday night trip to Strasbourg, one of only two teams to inflict defeat on PSG in the league this season. The defending champions welcome back captain Radamel Falcao, fit again after a thigh injury sustained at the start of February. ""Falcao will start, but he's not at his best level yet,"" cautioned Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. Falcao himself has his sights set on one goal - to make it to the World Cup this summer with Colombia after serious injury robbed him of taking part in the 2014 edition in Brazil. ""To take part in a World Cup is my dream,"" said the 32-year-old. Ligue 1 fixtures (all 1900 GMT unless stated) Playing Friday Strasbourg v Monaco (1945)"
502,07/03/2018,15:41,PSG defeat prompts questions over Qatar soft-power effort,"Paris Saint-Germain's latest bruising exit from the European football Champions League may have been particularly painful for two men watching among the almost 50,000-strong crowd at Parc des Princes.","High in the stands in the Paris stadium were Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and the former ruler, his father Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani -- who together have helped bankroll the French team's obsession with landing club football's biggest prize: the European Cup. Tuesday's limp defeat, even if by Real Madrid, seems scant return for the more than one billion euros poured into PSG since Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) bought the French club in 2011. This was meant to be the year the club -- having signed Neymar and Kylian Mbappe for a combined 402 million euros ($499 million) -- joined European football's elite. Instead, PSG has failed to realise its ambitions, crucially at a time when Qatar is at the centre of a bitter political conflict with neighbouring former allies in the Gulf. Even more galling for Qatar and PSG is that one of the favourites this year is Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City. Those involved with PSG say there is no chance of Qatar turning its back on the club. ""The project is not stopping,"" said a source close to the club. ""The investment has been huge and is continuing."" Nasser Al-Khelaifi, who simultaneously serves as chairman of QSI and president of PSG -- in addition to being a tennis buddy of the current emir -- spoke immediately after the humbling defeat about taking time to reflect, despite being ""upset"". ""Short-term, the club's Neymar-powered, Gulf feud-busting tactics would appear to be at an end,"" said Simon Chadwick, a professor of Sports Enterprise at Britain's Salford University and a member of a Qatari government sport think tank. ""Longer term, however, one senses it will be a case of keep calm and carry on."" Success ""requires sustained investment in talent acquisition and development"", he adds, not just the occasional big name signing. Patience, though, is not a highly regarded virtue in modern-day football, even though the experience of ""nouveau-riche"" clubs such as England's Chelsea and Manchester City demonstrate it takes time for a team to establish itself among Europe's traditional elite. For those directly involved with the day-to-day running of PSG, reflection on the Real defeat is likely to take the form of what to do with coach Unai Emery and Neymar. Paris-based French football specialist Jonathan Johnson says the latest failure will see ""heads roll"" and even speculates that Khelaifi may be for ""the chopping block"". For Qatar, what to do next with PSG seems to be a matter of broader considerations, including international politics, diplomacy and finance. The emirate has exploited sport to pursue a soft power approach to improving its global image. This effort has reached its height in football, through PSG and the country's winning bid to host the 2022 World Cup. ""Overall, there's no doubt that Qatar's six-year involvement with PSG has been a soft power success,"" says Christopher Davidson, a professor in Middle East politics at Durham University. Financing the PSG European dream though is key. One billion euros may sound a lot but is equal only to a fortnight's spending on World Cup preparations for Qatar. And despite its vast gas riches, the boycott by its regional rivals has hit Doha's economy. ""The economic blockade drags on and no real end is in sight,"" Davidson said. ""Cutting through the extensive propaganda produced by both sides, there's no doubt that the Qatari economy is feeling the squeeze."""

Certainly, their emphatic 5-2 aggregate victory over PSG was as convincing as it was comfortable, and an unprecedented third straight Champions League triumph, the fourth in five years, is now within reach. Ronaldo's form this season has, not coincidentally, matched that of his team. Inititally below his own high standards in La Liga, particularly at the Santiago Bernabeu, he has sustained his performances in Europe and hit a peak in recent weeks. The Portguese's opener in Paris means he now has 15 goals in his last nine games overall and, in the Champions League, has scored in a remarkable nine consecutive matches, equalling the record of Ruud van Nistelrooy. Zidane, meanwhile, disregarded in February, is top dog in March, lauded in Spain for his tactical acumen against Unai Emery, and strength of character for picking a bench that included Gareth Bale and Isco, as well as Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, both available after injury. But Real must now turn their revival into something more concrete. Lose in the quarter-finals, or even the last four, and the success over PSG will quickly retreat from view, replaced by a likely third-place finish in La Liga and lack of silverware added in the equation. Perhaps a squad that won the league title last season, and owns three Champions League triumphs, has lacked edge in the campaign´s early stages but is sharpening with a major prize in sight. ""We've had difficult moments in the Liga and Copa del Rey, but it's always difficult to maintain the same level while playing every three days,"" Zidane said on Tuesday. ""You can't always win everything, but we're winning now in the Liga and we have to look ahead to our game with Eibar on Saturday."" Zidane has begun treating domestic games almost like trials for Europe, rotating key players or trying other ones in unfamiliar positions. That strategy will be tested in April, given Real host city rivals Atletico Madrid in La Liga, the weekend before their quarter-final second leg. By then, Bale will hope to have played his way back into favour. The Welshman was left out of the starting line-up in France, just as he had been for the first leg in Madrid three weeks before. Snubbed for Real's two biggest games of the season so far, Bale would appear to have reached a crossroads in his relationship with Zidane, whose explanation afterwards was brief but revealing. ""Today it was important to have two lines of four, to defend well against their wide players,"" the Frenchman said. ""We did that very well."" Fit again, and seemingly finding form, Bale faces a fight not to be deployed only in Real's throwaway fixtures. ""For sure Bale would prefer to play more,"" Zidane added. ""All the players are important here, which is what I look at. ""Gareth is one of them. He did not start the home or away (games against PSG), but he will play games. He is an important player for us."""
504,07/03/2018,12:29,PSG's ambitions in tatters as Real's pedigree shows,Paris Saint-Germain's Qatari-bankrolled bid to put themselves among Europe's elite foundered again as Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid comfortably beat the French club to move into the quarter-finals of the Champions League.,"Ronaldo administered the killer blow with a 51st minute header at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday that saw PSG's chances of pulling back a two-goal defeat from the first leg vanishing into the smoke from supporters' flares. A scrappy PSG goal from Edinson Cavani was followed by the cherry on the cake for the defending European champions with Brazilian Casemiro's deflected goal. As the ball looped into the net to complete a comfortable 5-2 win over the two legs, the half a billion euros a year that PSG's Qatari owners have pumped into the club since 2012 had once again failed to land the one prize they crave. The absence of Neymar, the Parisians' star and a player who offered the best chance of unlocking the Madrid defence, was significant. Having broken a toe in a league match against Marseille, the 222-million-euro signing watched the game in Brazil where he is recovering from surgery. Neymar's future at PSG will be thrown into question by PSG's failure to progress to the quarter-finals of Europe's top club competition for the second successive year. Marquinhos, PSG's Brazilian defender who is a close friend of Neymar, urged him not to turn his back on France with rumours rife that Real Madrid are prepared to break the bank to attract the former Barcelona player back to Spain. ""I ask him to stay and let things settle down,"" Marquinhos said. ""He is an important player for us. We really need him to have confidence in our project, our players and our coaches."" Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said PSG had bowed to Madrid's superior experience at the highest level -- it was the eighth successive season that Real have reached the last eight. ""We know that Real have a lot of experience. We didn't do what we needed to do to win,"" he said. The same point was hammered home by Marquinhos: ""We need to grow in maturity as a team and show more strength in this kind of match."" Khelaifi insisted it was too early to make major changes, but Unai Emery, the Spanish coach who was given another chance by his Qatari paymasters after PSG spectacularly collapsed against Barcelona in the same competition last season, will surely be shown the door at the end of the season. Emery previously won the second-tier Europa League three times with Seville but has never taken a club beyond the last 16 of the Champions League. Mauricio Pochettino, the Argentine who has turned English club Tottenham into a force to be reckoned with this year, is the latest name to emerge as a possible replacement. Ronaldo meanwhile will be laughing at those who speculated earlier in the season that at 33 his powers were waning. The World Player of the Year scored twice to punish PSG's slack defending in the first leg in Madrid and his goal in Paris took him to a remarkable 117 in the Champions League, putting him 19 ahead of his eternal rival Lionel Messi of Barcelona. In truth, the Champions League offers Madrid the only chance of silverware this season. They have virtually conceded the Spanish title to Barcelona and have been knocked out of their domestic cup. For PSG, there is just the scraps of a near-certain seventh French league title and both cups to look forward to -- scant consolation for a club that wants to conquer Europe."
505,06/03/2018,12:56,Beleaguered Brazilians sick of fuss over Neymar's toe,News crews from around the world may have flocked to cover Neymar's foot operation but some Brazilians would rather see the spotlight on the country's woes.,"No-one here doubts the talent of the 26-year-old star of the Brazilian national team and Paris Saint-Germain. But people are sick of seeing him treated like a pampered rich kid. The sport's most expensive player ever underwent surgery Saturday at Mater Dei hospital in the southeastern city of Belo Horizonte. The private, ultra-modern facility's tinted windows make it look more like an office building. The roof boasts a chopper pad, which Neymar used when he was released from the hospital on Sunday. Across the street is a decrepit maternity hospital called Odete Valadares. Like most state-run hospitals in Brazil, it is short on staff and all kinds of equipment, even beds. The pale pink paint is peeling. Several windows are broken. ""We need more beds in the neo-natal emergency room. Sometimes patients have to sleep on cots,"" said Dr. Klaus Morales on Facebook the day of Neymar's surgery on a broken metatarsal. ""Fifty meters from here in the Mater Dei hospital, Neymar will undergo surgery on a toe,"" Morales wrote. ""Helicopters are flying over the area non-stop and the news media focus only on this, while our patients here must wait hours to be treated,"" said Morales. The situation was disgraceful, he added. Dozens of camera crews staked out spots for hours outside the Mater Dei hospital while Neymar was inside -- the fate of Brazil team at this year's World Cup finals could rest on him making a full recovery. And Neymar's teammates will sorely miss him when they take on Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday. But no-one was covering the problems that many Brazilians face, said Priscila Silveira, a 28-year-old government employee in Belo Horizonte. ""The public health system is in a state of crisis and we have major crime problems that do not get the attention they deserve in the news media,"" she said. Brazil has one of the world's highest homicide rates, and after two years of recession that is just now beginning to ease, the jobless rate is almost 12 percent. ""For us it is hard to see a public figure abroad such as Neymar while we here are suffering because of so many things, such as violence, muggings every day, a terrible public education system, besides all the problems with corruption,"" said Aderaldo Pulquerio, 47, a maintenance worker. The same gripes are heard in Rio de Janeiro, where Geraldo de Oliveira, a 62-year-old taxi driver, could not disguise his anger. ""It is minor surgery on a toe. If that happened to the rest of us, we would not manage to be operated on or treated. But since that guy has money, he can do it,"" said de Oliveira. Among the Neymar fans who turned out Saturday at the Mater Dei hospital was a man in a wheelchair named Sanderson. He carried a sign that read: ""I broke my heel and knee. I need your support and that of your medical team."" Neymar began rehab Sunday at his 10-million-dollar home on the coast near Rio. His neighbors include celebrites and politicians accused of corruption. This does not help his popularity, although the player caters to younger fans on social media, always with a touch of glamor and controversy. On Friday, the day before his surgery, Neymar published on Instagram a photo in which he is seen giving his girlfriend Bruna Marquezine, an actress, a passionate kiss as she sits on him in a wheelchair. jmy-lg/csc/js/ma/dw/gj"

""I speak with him practically every day, so yes we have agreed between us that we would see each other again later on in this competition,"" said PSG defender Dani Alves when asked if he had been in touch with his fellow Brazil international. ""For sure, we will feel his absence. But between sitting down and crying and getting up and getting on with it, I always opt for the second option."" Angel Di Maria, a Champions League winner with Madrid in 2014, is set to replace Neymar in the Paris line-up before a sell-out crowd of 47,000 at the Parc des Princes. ""He is a spectacular player, who made history with Real Madrid. He can play in any position across the middle, he moves well, has a good shot, and is quick,"" Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said of Di Maria. PSG took the lead in the first leg in Spain last month through Adrien Rabiot only for Real to hit back with Ronaldo scoring twice to break through the 100-goal barrier for the club in the Champions League. Marcelo also netted for Real, who are aiming to become the first club since Bayern Munich in 1976 to win a third consecutive European Cup. Madrid have not been eliminated from the Champions League this early since Lyon beat them in 2010. However, PSG are relying on their formidable record at home, where they are unbeaten in over 50 games going back two years. They have also overturned a 3-1 first-leg deficit against Real before, winning 4-1 in their UEFA Cup quarter-final return in 1993. George Weah scored for PSG that night. Now the president of Liberia, his son Timothy made his professional debut for the Ligue 1 leaders at the weekend. A repeat of that famous comeback would be the most significant result for PSG since the Qatari takeover of the club in 2011, after four straight quarter-final eliminations and then a humiliating loss in Barcelona in the last 16 a year ago. The front page of L'Equipe sports daily on Tuesday carried a photograph of that famous night under the headline: ""To Be Repeated."" ""I think that we need games like this and to beat these teams to take a step forward and so that our opponents really take notice of PSG, and don't just think we have loads of money,"" said 34-year-old Alves, who played in two Champions League final victories for Barcelona. ""PSG have had their limits in this competition in the past and now we need to go beyond them to keep on progressing as a club."" An elimination would surely spell the end for coach Unai Emery, who is out of contract in June. Similarly, an exit would be disastrous for French legend Zidane, with Real currently 15 points behind leaders Barcelona in La Liga and already out of the Copa del Rey. ""After the game, it's going to be difficult for one of the two teams, but that is football,"" said Zidane. Given their domestic difficulties, Real are throwing everything into their quest to win a record 13th European Cup. ""That can mean added pressure or added motivation,"" said captain Sergio Ramos. ""The margin for error is minimal."" Toni Kroos (knee) and Luka Modric (thigh) could return for Real after spells on the sidelines. Javier Pastore was named in PSG's squad despite a calf concern, meaning Neymar is their only notable absentee. There will be a minute's silence before kick-off of at this and all the midweek European games in honour of Fiorentina and Italy defender Davide Astori, who died suddenly at the weekend aged 31."
507,05/03/2018,19:45,PSG gunning for Real Madrid scalp despite Neymar absence,"Paris Saint-Germain remain optimistic that they can record what would be the biggest victory since the Qatari takeover of the club, even with Neymar out injured, when they face Real Madrid on Tuesday.","A late collapse saw PSG lose 3-1 in Madrid last month in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. And they come into Tuesday's return without Neymar, as the world's most expensive player recovers in Brazil from a foot operation. Despite that blow, and the prospect of having to overturn such a deficit against the two-time reigning European champions, PSG are not throwing in the towel as they bid to reach the quarter-finals. ""I think that we need games like this and to beat these teams to take a step forward and so that our opponents really take notice of PSG, and don't just think we have loads of money,"" said Dani Alves, who played in two Champions League final victories for Barcelona and was in the Juventus side beaten by Real in last season's final. ""I said last summer when I was presented here that I wasn't coming just to live in Paris or take the money. I came here because I am a competitor,"" added Alves, speaking to media at the Parc des Princes on the eve of the game. After Qatar Sports Investments bought the club in 2011, PSG had four successive quarter-final defeats in the Champions League before the humiliation in Barcelona in the last 16 a year ago. A failure to turn the tie around on Tuesday would mean PSG being eliminated by one of Spain's big two for the fourth time in six seasons. ""PSG have had their limits in this competition in the past and now we need to go beyond them to keep on progressing as a club,"" added Alves. Neymar's absence is an obviously huge blow, but Alves and coach Unai Emery both insisted that Paris have enough quality in their ranks to cope without him. ""When one player is missing, it opens the door for someone else, and I know that whoever comes in through that door will do so with all their force,"" said Emery. Angel Di Maria, who won the Champions League with Real in 2014, is likely to be the major beneficiary of Neymar's absence. The Argentine has been PSG's form player with 13 goals in 14 starts in 2018, although he has played just 67 minutes in the Champions League this season. ""He is a spectacular player, who made history with Real Madrid. He can play in any position across the middle, he moves well, has a good shot, and is quick,"" said Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane. Di Maria has a point to prove, as does Emery, who took charge of his 100th PSG game at the weekend. His contract expires in June and there is surely no prospect of a renewal in the event of a defeat, even with PSG on course for a domestic clean sweep. The pressure is also on Zidane, albeit less so after the manner of their first-leg victory. Cristiano Ronaldo, whose brace in the first leg took him past 100 Champions League goals for Real, is in form again and the Spanish giants have not been knocked out at this stage of the competition since 2010. ""Tomorrow (Tuesday), after the game, it's going to be difficult for one of the two teams, but that is football,"" said Zidane. Fifteen points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona and out of the Copa del Rey, Real are throwing everything into their quest to win a third consecutive Champions League. ""That can mean added pressure or added motivation,"" said captain Sergio Ramos. ""We are focusing everything on the Champions League and the margin for error is minimal."" Toni Kroos and Luka Modric trained on the Parc des Princes pitch on Monday evening and could play after spells on the sidelines with respective knee and thigh problems. Javier Pastore, who had been a slight doubt with a calf problem, was named in the PSG squad."

The hope for PSG is that they might be able to get their 222 million-euro ($264 million) man back for the latter stages of the Champions League. But in order to make it to the quarter-finals in April, they will need to overturn the first-leg deficit following their defeat, inflicted with two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and a Marcelo strike, at the Santiago Bernabeu last month.

510,04/03/2018,16:05,Neymar leaves hospital by helicopter for recovery,"Brazilian superstar Neymar left hospital by helicopter on Sunday, a day after a successful foot operation, to begin his recovery ahead of a possible World Cup return.","The 26-year-old Paris Saint-Germain forward went to the airport in Belo Horizonte by helicopter, from where he was expected to head on a private jet to his luxury villa at the Mangaratiba beach resort around 100km from Rio de Janeiro. According to Brazilian website Uol, Neymar's entourage have already prepared his recovery ""headquarters"" at his villa, which includes a gymnasium and a machine capable of producing 300kg of ice a day, similar to those used by modern football clubs. His recovery will be monitored by Brazil and PSG physiotherapist Rafael Martini, who has been working alongside Neymar since he started his career at Santos in Sao Paulo. The whole of Brazil is holding its breath while waiting to see if their star player, who captained the country to Olympic gold on home turf in 2016, would be fit to play in Russia. But while Brazil frets over his potential World Cup availability, PSG are keen to get Neymar back playing before the end of the season, although he will miss Tuesday's crunch Champions League last 16 second leg at home to Real Madrid. Both Brazil and PSG hailed a successful operation on Saturday on the fractured fifth metatarsal in Neymar's right foot. The world's most expensive player will not start training for at least another six weeks, the French doctor representing PSG at the Belo Horizonte hospital, Gerard Saillant, told journalists on Saturday. Should his recovery go well, Neymar could even be back in club action in May. If PSG beat Real and then make it through the quarter-finals too, he might even be able to play in the Champions League semi-final second leg on May 1 or 2, or if not then perhaps the May 26 final in Kiev, Ukraine -- should the French outfit get that far. With PSG boasting a 14-point lead at the top of Ligue 1, they can afford to do without Neymar for domestic duties, but he was prised from Barcelona for a world record 222 million euros ($264 million) to help the Qatari-owned Parisians win a first Champions League title. And while Brazil scored a self-interest victory in ensuring Neymar underwent an immediate operation that PSG initially seemed reluctant to sanction, the French club are keen to regain some control over their player's recovery. Brazilian surgeon Rodrigo Lasmar performed the operation, accompanied by Saillant, who previously operated on ex-Brazil star Ronaldo's injured knee. ""The recovery time will depend on the player's evolution. In six weeks we will make a new evaluation,"" Lasmar said on Saturday. Saillant, meanwhile, denied there was any conflict between the Brazilian football federation and PSG over their separate interests. That was a reference to an article in French newspaper l'Equipe, which claimed that Lasmar had lied over the nature of the fracture to force Neymar to undergo surgery. PSG had been hoping the forward would regain full fitness much sooner from what they considered a hairline fracture, whereas Brazil were keen to have him operated on to ensure he could recover and be fully fit by June. Lasmar said he would need two to three months of recovery while PSG had hoped he be out for only six to eight weeks. Cocooned away in his homeland, Neymar appears to be ensuring Brazil continue to hold the upper hand in their arm-wrestle with PSG."
511,04/03/2018,02:38,Neymar leaving hospital to begin rehab,"Brazil and Paris Saint-Germain superstar Neymar was to leave hospital Sunday after a successful operation on his broken foot, but it will be six weeks before doctors know when the world's most expensive player can train again.","Neymar was due to be discharged early in the morning from the Mater Dei hospital in Belo Horizonte, 24 hours after surgery to repair a fractured fifth metatarsal in his right foot. The operation was declared a complete success. Now the question is whether the 26-year-old can catch any of PSG's remaining season, and even what kind of shape he'll be in at the start of Brazil's World Cup campaign in Russia this June. ""The recovery time will depend on the player's evolution. In six weeks we will make a new evaluation,"" Lasmar said after performing the operation. Gerard Saillant, the French doctor representing PSG at the hospital, told journalists that the timing of Neymar's return to full training could only be given at the six-week mark. ""It is absolutely impossible to give you the slightest detail before those six weeks,"" he said. On Thursday, Lasmar said the star player -- whose transfer from Barcelona cost PSG a record 222 million euros ($264 million) last August -- would need at least two and a half months, maybe three, to return. This would put him uncomfortably close to the start of the World Cup on June 14, including missing two friendly warm-up games. After his one hour and 15 minute operation, Neymar spent his Saturday afternoon in a hospital bed watching live TV coverage of PSG's Ligue 1 game against Troyes, Saillant said. PSG won 2-0, but Neymar's absence will be keenly felt during Tuesday's Champions League showdown against Real Madrid. The striker has scored 28 goals in 30 appearances in all competitions for the club -- a prolific tally that came to a halt February 25 when he broke his foot during a 3-0 drubbing of Marseille. Amid reports of tensions between PSG and Brazil's footballing authorities over Neymar's medical treatment, PSG insisted that it would be in charge of his recuperation. ""The post-operation rehabilitation will begin immediately under the control of the club's physiotherapist,"" PSG said in a statement on their website. Earlier, Paris newspaper L'Equipe reported that PSG believe Lasmar lied about Neymar's condition. The report said that Neymar was initially found to have suffered a minor fracture at the Marseille game and that PSG were shocked when Lasmar declared it was a serious break requiring longer than expected recuperation time. However, doctors stressed Saturday that there was no friction between PSG and Brazil's federation, the CBF. ""Contrary to what might have been written or said..., decisions already taken and those to come have had the complete agreement of Neymar of course, and of his family, all the staff at PSG, the medical staff, the organization and management of PSG, and the representatives of the CBF,"" Saillant said. ""There is absolutely no split, despite what was written."""

Only a short time later, Neymar, 26, was watching live coverage from his hospital room of PSG's Ligue 1 game against Troyes, said Gerard Saillant, the doctor representing PSG in Belo Horizonte. Neymar should be discharged from the hospital early Sunday, Lasmar said. But PSG said that Neymar will not be able to return to training for at least six weeks. This followed an earlier statement from Lasmar that the star player would be out of action for at least two and a half months, maybe three. Neymar will definitely miss PSG's make-or-break Champions League last 16 second leg against Real Madrid next Tuesday. But if Lasmar's prognosis of a nearly three-month wait is true, then Brazil will be scrambling even to get him ready for the World Cup in Russia starting in June. Neymar broke his fifth metatarsal -- the bone leading to his small toe -- during a 3-0 drubbing of Marseille on February 25. The striker -- whose transfer from Barcelona cost PSG a record 222 million euros ($264 million) last August -- has scored 28 goals in 30 appearances in all competitions for the club. Amid reports of tension between PSG and Brazil's footballing authorities over Neymar's medical treatment, PSG insisted that it would take charge of his recuperation. ""The post-operation rehabilitation will begin immediately under the control of the club's physiotherapist,"" PSG said in a statement on their website. ""An assessment will be conducted in six weeks in order to determine the possible date of his return to training."" Earlier, Paris newspaper L'Equipe reported that PSG believe Lasmar lied about Neymar's condition. The report said that Neymar was initially found to have suffered a minor fracture and that PSG were shocked to hear Lasmar say on Thursday that it was a serious break requiring a longer than expected recuperation. Following the surgery, however, doctors stressed that there was no friction between PSG and Brazil's federation, the CBF. ""Contrary to what might have been written or said..., decisions already taken and those to come have had the complete agreement of Neymar of course, and of his family, all the staff at PSG, the medical staff, the organization and management of PSG, and the representatives of the CBF,"" Saillant said. ""There is absolutely no split, despite what was written."" Lasmar pointed out that physiotherapy would be done by Rafael Martino, who does work both for PSG and the Brazilian national team, which ""shows the integration of all parties."" After a remarkable turnaround in fortunes since the shambolic 7-1 semi-final loss to Germany in the 2014 World Cup, Brazil are seen as top contenders in Russia. But a big part of that optimism depends on the talented Neymar, who missed that infamous humiliation four years ago through injury. Jose Luiz Runco, a former chief medical officer for the Brazilian team, told AFP that Neymar will walk with crutches after two to three weeks, exercise while putting weight on his repaired foot after about 60 to 75 days, and only then return to training. ""He's likely to recover pretty quickly because he's an athlete and young."" A potential plus for Neymar is that the enforced break from competitive football may do him good. ""When you think how exhausting the European season is, he could even arrive fresher than the others, both physically and emotionally,"" said Cristiano Nunes, the physiotherapist for Brazilian club Internacional. Neymar may not be able to walk for a while, but he is already carrying the burden of a nation's expectations. ""The World Cup begins here today, with this operation,"" said fan Iago Coura, 24, who came to the hospital with three friends. ""Lasmar is the team's best player right now."""

Academy product Christopher Nkunku marked his first start of the season with his first goal this term 13 minutes from time to complete a victory that left PSG 14 points clear of defending champions Monaco at the top of Ligue 1. ""Ahead of a big match and after (league and French Cup wins over) Marseille, I'm very happy because we kept up our level of play,"" PSG coach Unai Emery said. ""I want the players to be ready (against Real). The players all want to play and that makes the decision tougher for me, but it's better like that."" With a 3-1 deficit to overcome in the second leg of their last-16 tie against Real on Tuesday, Emery refused to risk Cavani while Mbappe stayed in Paris to continue treatment on an ankle injury sustained against Marseille in midweek. Marco Verratti was also rested for Saturday's trip, as Di Maria again took full advantage of the opportunity presented to several members of PSG's expensively assembled squad in the wake of Neymar's injury. Di Maria himself was feted as the player to turn PSG into genuine Champions League contenders when he signed from Manchester United for 63 million euros ($78 million) in 2015, and the 30-year-old has arguably been their best performer of late. ""Angel is an important player who has the quality to make the difference,"" Emery said. ""He's got both the confidence and the desire. We want the players to be at their best level on Tuesday, and for some like Angel, it will be a special moment."" Troyes goalkeeper Erwin Zelazny produced a series of saves to deny Di Maria, and then Giovani Lo Celso twice in the first half, but the home goal was breached after a defensive lapse on 47 minutes. A poor clearance followed by further miscommunication in the Troyes backline gifted Julian Draxler the opening to slide in Di Maria and the Argentine masterfully dinked the ball over an advancing Zelazny. Twenty-year-old Nkunku sealed the win on 77 minutes, picking out the far corner of the net after gathering a threaded pass from Dani Alves as the linesman's flag controversially stayed down. Troyes boss Jean-Louis Garcia and his assistant were both ordered to the stands after protesting the decision to allow the goal, with replays indicating Nkunku had strayed marginally offside. Emery then handed a first-team debut to Timothy Weah, as the son of former PSG star, and current Liberian president, George Weah replaced Lo Celso for the final few minutes. The 18-year-old US youth international, whose father won the 1995 Ballon d'Or, nearly bagged a debut goal in stoppage time after racing clear of the Troyes defence before being foiled by Zelazny. Goals from Wahbi Khazri and Ismaila Sarr propelled Rennes up to fifth courtesy of a 2-0 victory at Amiens, while Slovenia forward Robert Beric netted twice for Saint-Etienne in a 2-2 draw with Dijon. Angers pulled clear of the relegation zone with a 3-0 home win over Guingamp, but Metz remain firmly rooted to the bottom after conceding a late equaliser in a 1-1 draw against fellow strugglers Toulouse. On Friday, Rony Lopes scored his sixth goal in seven games as Monaco came from behind to beat Bordeaux 2-1 to tighten their grip on second place, with Marseille and Lyon not in action until Sunday."

""My name pushes me a little bit more because my father did very good things here. I want to do the same thing,"" said Weah, who nearly scored a debut goal in stoppage time. ""Everything is going to be fine, soon I will start to score goals!"" Born in New York City, the teenager signed a professional deal with PSG last summer but has spent much of his time with the club's reserve team in the fourth division. ""He's a very young player but he works very hard. He played 15 minutes and had a good chance to score. He deserves it. It's the first time, he needs to keep on working,"" PSG coach Unai Emery said. George Weah spent three successful and prolific seasons at PSG between 1992 and 1995, and remains the only African footballer to the win the Ballon d'Or award, in 1995."
515,03/03/2018,14:24,Neymar's golden foot to go under the knife,"Brazil and Paris Saint-Germain superstar Neymar was to undergo surgery on a broken right foot on Saturday, putting the planet's most expensive footballer out of action until the eve of the World Cup.","The operation, performed by Brazilian national team surgeon Rodrigo Lasmar, was expected early on Saturday morning in the Mater Dei hospital in Belo Horizonte, where Neymar checked in the previous night. Jose Luiz Runco, a former chief medical officer for the Brazilian team, told AFP that the surgery to mend the broken fifth metatarsal ""is not difficult"" and should take between one hour and 90 minutes. What concerns Brazil and PSG is how long it will take Neymar to get back on the field, and scoring goals. Lasmar described the break as serious and said that recovery will take from two and a half to three months. That leaves PSG without the striker -- whose transfer from Barcelona cost the club a record 222 million euros ($264 million) last August -- when they face Real Madrid in a make-or-break Champions League clash next Tuesday. Neymar has scored 28 goals in 30 appearances in all competitions for PSG, a prolific performance cut short by the injury on February 25 during the Parisians' 3-0 drubbing of Marseille. Brazil's concern is that Neymar will be coming back only a few weeks before the June start of the World Cup in Russia. After a remarkable turnaround in fortunes since the shambolic exit in a 7-1 defeat against Germany in the 2014 tournament, Brazil are seen as top contenders this time. A big part of that optimism, though, depends on the talented Neymar. Neymar returned from Paris to his villa on the Brazilian coast on Thursday and on Friday night flew to Belo Horizonte. In the heated atmosphere around the operation, Brazil's Globoesporte website claimed that Neymar was expected to come by helicopter and had booked a whole wing of the Mater Dei hospital. But a local newspaper reported he would take a more modest suite measuring around 80 by 40 feet (24 x 12 metres). Staff at the hospital, a tall building with mirrored windows, were put on paparazzi lockdown, with a ban on using their cellphones anywhere near the star. However, an AFP photographer was given access to a room similar to the one Neymar was due to take -- a small suite with basic furniture and a second room for the patient. ""I hope he recovers quickly in time for the Cup, so that he can play,"" said Mateus Falqueto, 13, who waited outside the hospital in the hope of getting Neymar's autograph on a yellow Brazilian team shirt that had already been signed by several other players. Neymar, 26, is hardly camera shy. Ahead of his arrival at the hospital he put up a picture on Instagram of himself in a wheelchair with his actress girlfriend Bruna Marquezine sitting on his lap and kissing him. The image-conscious PSG star also posted a close-up of his hand, tattooed with a small cross, holding Marquezine's hand. Neymar will feel the weight of a nation's expectations as he races to recuperate in time for the World Cup. He already seems sure to miss two warm-up friendlies against Russia and Germany in March. However, he is in good hands. Lasmar's father Neylor was also the Brazilian team doctor in the 1980s and operated on another big star of the Brazilian footballing galaxy, Zico -- getting him ready in time for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. A plus for Neymar is that the enforced break from competitive football may do him as much good as it threatens harm. ""When you think how exhausting the European season is, he could even arrive fresher than the others, both physically and emotionally,"" said Cristiano Nunes, the physiotherapist for Brazilian first division club Internacional in Porto Alegre. ""He'll return with a real desire to play football and to show his potential."" According to a report in the French newspaper L'Equipe on Saturday, PSG are furious at Lasmar's diagnosis of a full fracture in the metatarsal, saying that in France doctors found only a less serious hairline fracture, which would allow Neymar back on the field more quickly. Neymar has suffered 14 injuries that forced him to miss at least one game, including when he fractured a vertebrae during the 2014 World Cup -- forcing him to miss the infamous thrashing by Germany -- but the latest is by far the most serious, GloboEsporte.com said."
516,02/03/2018,15:23,"PSG will still be strong without Neymar, insists Zidane",Zinedine Zidane has warned his Real Madrid players there is no room for complacency despite Neymar's absence from next week's Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain.,"Neymar is to undergo surgery on a foot injury and will miss the last-16 decider at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday, where Real hold a 3-1 advantage from the first leg. Without the Brazilian, PSG's chances of a comeback appear to be significantly reduced, although the in-form Angel di Maria should fill the void. The Argentinian scored twice in a 3-0 win over Marseille on Wednesday. ""We feel sorry for Neymar but they are a very strong team and the player that is going to replace him will be very strong,"" Zidane said on Friday. ""We are going to play a European Cup match, a return match, where we will have to give 2000 percent. ""Whether there is one player or another, the player who plays will be prepared, they will want to prove themselves."" Real are at home to 10th-placed Getafe on Saturday as Los Blancos look to regain momentum following Tuesday's surprise defeat to Espanyol. Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, who play each other on Sunday, sit 15 and 10 points clear of Real respectively, but Zidane claims he will not give up in the league. ""It's going to be complicated, but not impossible,"" Zidane said. ""Look what is happening between the first and the second, there are five points now. Did you expect it? If Atletico beat Barcelona, it is two points, did you expect that? ""The league is alive and I am optimistic, always, until the end."" Marcelo trained on Friday and is available to face Getafe but Luka Modric and Toni Kroos are still recovering from thigh and knee injuries respectively. Zidane refused to offer any indication whether the pair will be fit to face PSG."
517,02/03/2018,02:15,Neymar injury offers Di Maria and co chance to step forward for PSG,"While Neymar's untimely injury is a huge blow to Paris Saint-Germain, it does represent a golden opportunity for Angel di Maria and other members of their expensively assembled squad.","Not only will Neymar miss PSG's Champions League last 16, second leg against Real Madrid next week, but the world's most expensive player might not feature for his club again this season, with the doctor who will operate on his fractured foot in Brazil saying he could be out for three months. That means it is without their 222 million-euro ($264m) star recruit -- who arrived in Brazil on Thursday for surgery on Saturday -- that PSG must try to overturn a 3-1 first-leg deficit against Madrid, as well as secure a clean sweep of the domestic honours. However, the man most likely to directly benefit is Di Maria, himself feted as the player to turn PSG into genuine Champions League contenders when signed from Manchester United for 63 million euros in 2015. The Argentine may not be a first pick for coach Unai Emery anymore, but he has still probably been their best player in 2018, profiting from whenever Neymar, Kylian Mbappe or Edinson Cavani have been absent. A double in Wednesday's 3-0 win over Marseille in the French Cup quarter-finals means Di Maria has now scored 12 times in 2018 in 13 starts. ""He had been lacking a little bit of confidence, but he is a player who can change a match at any moment,"" said Marco Verratti of the former Real Madrid winger. ""He is not someone who we are just discovering. He has done a lot of great things in his career."" PSG go to struggling Troyes this weekend, and with a 14-point lead over Monaco at the top of Ligue 1, Emery must be tempted to wrap his players in cotton wool before the Real game. ""We will miss Neymar, but the team is preparing to do without him,"" said Emery, who saw Mbappe come off at half-time against Marseille. ""He took a kick on the ankle and asked not to play the second half. But I don't think it's too serious."" Others who could have an important role in upcoming games are Javier Pastore and Julian Draxler, underused of late but who cost a combined 80 million euros. Meanwhile, the return of Thiago Motta provides a boost to Emery, with the veteran Italian midfielder proving his fitness in an impressive 74 minutes on the field against Marseille in midweek. He missed the first leg against Real altogether, but even at 35 he remains the man who makes PSG tick. While the brilliant Bernardo Silva left champions Monaco for Manchester City last year, his compatriot Rony Lopes has taken the opposite route. Now 22, the Portuguese attacking midfielder was at City before being sold to Monaco in 2015. After spending last season on loan at Lille, he returned to the principality as a replacement for Silva, and is enjoying a fine campaign. Often troubled by injury in the past, Lopes has scored five times in Monaco's last six league games, including a brace in last week's 3-3 draw at Toulouse. Leonardo Jardim's side are unbeaten in 12 league outings and sit second in the table. ""I am playing close to my best at the moment, but I know that I can get better still,"" Lopes said ahead of Friday's clash with Bordeaux. His coach added: ""This year he is progressing, he has more confidence and he is almost never injured, so I am pleased for him."""

""What struck me when I arrived was I went through the Juventus Museum and thought 'wow, so many trophies',"" said Matuidi. ""That's when I realised that I was entering a whole new dimension. We French like to rest on our laurels. We tell ourselves we have good players and don't really want to work more than that. ""When I was at Paris, I wasn't made to go to the gym. Here after five minutes in the dressing room if you're five minutes late to the gym, they come and pick you up. ""There's no secret. If Juve played in two Champions League finals in three years, it's down to hard work.

519,28/02/2018,00:36,Neymar out 'at least six weeks' and to miss Real clash,"Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar faces ""at least six weeks"" out with a fractured bone in his foot and will miss next week's return leg of the Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid, his father said on Tuesday.","""PSG know that they will not be able to count on Neymar for the upcoming matches: his treatment will last six to eight weeks, whether there is an operation or not,"" Neymar senior told ESPN Brasil. The Brazilian star suffered the injury, as well as a twisted ankle, in an innocuous looking incident towards the end of Sunday's 3-0 league victory over bitter rivals Marseille. PSG coach Unai Emery said earlier on Tuesday that ""no decision"" had been made regarding an operation, denying an earlier report in the Brazilian press that the world's most expensive player would go under the knife to repair the cracked bone in his right foot. Brazilian newspaper Globo Esporte had claimed a decision had been reached for Neymar to undergo surgery, and that the 26-year-old would be sidelined until May."
520,27/02/2018,15:38,"Neymar could still face Real, no operation planned: Emery","Neymar still has a ""small chance"" of playing against Real Madrid in the Champions League and there are no plans for an operation on his cracked bone, Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery said on Tuesday.","""For Neymar there has been no decision to have an operation,"" said Emery, denying an earlier report in the Brazilian press that the world's most expensive player would go under the knife to fix the cracked bone in his foot. ""Neymar is the first to want to play every match, he's very focussed on Real. I think there's a small chance that he'll be ready for the match,"" added Emery. PSG trail 3-1 from the last 16 first leg in Madrid two weeks ago and the loss of Neymar would be a huge blow to their chances of overturning that deficit at the Parc des Princes on March 6 and reaching the Champions League quarter-finals. Neymar suffered a cracked metatarsal in his foot and a twisted ankle in an innocuous looking incident against Marseille on Sunday night. And while Spaniard Emery said there is a possibility he'll recover by next week, he was more pessimistic than he had been on Sunday night. ""Today, after analysing Neymar, it looks less likely than it did on Sunday that he'll be ready for this match,"" said Emery. However, he was clear in his dismissal of a report published by Brazilian newspaper Globo Esporte on Tuesday morning that claimed a decision had already been reached for Neymar to undergo an operation, and that he would be out until May. ""Last night (Monday) the club issued an official statement: it said how the player was medically,"" said Emery. ""Things (like operations) aren't decided like that,"" he added, clicking his fingers. ""You need discussions with the doctor, the player, his entourage. ""To make such an important decision you need tranquility and a bit of patience. ""Right now, I don't think you need anything else. There's a lot of information from outside, but the truth is what I told you, which is what the doctor told me."" While PSG's primary concern is having the world's most expensive player available for their Champions League match next week, in Brazil it is Neymar's participation at the World Cup that is most pressing. The 26-year-old captained Brazil to their first ever Olympic gold medal 18 months ago on home soil and is seen as crucial to their hopes in Russia in June and July. Were he to undergo an operation now and return to fitness in May, that would suit Brazil, who could then rely on a fully fit and fresh Neymar for the World Cup. Four years ago, Neymar missed the semifinal against Germany with injury and Brazil were thrashed 7-1. Globo had said Neymar would have a ""pin"" attached to his metatarsal bone and would be fit to return in May. Recovery from metatarsal injuries usually take weeks, if not months. Just last year, Neymar's international team-mate Gabriel Jesus was out of action for two months after breaking a metatarsal playing for Manchester City. Former England stars David Beckham and Wayne Rooney spent six weeks on the sidelines with metatarsal injuries in the past. Earlier on Tuesday, AFP spoke to a number of medical experts who all set a downbeat tone. ""It would be very risky as it's a fragile bone in the foot which is difficult to protect,"" said Jean-Marcel Ferrat, a former doctor with the France national football team. ""(Playing against Real) could compromise the rest of his season."" Parisian osteopath Alain Gosp Server said such injuries normally take ""three weeks to heal"". ""It will all depend on his treatment but what's sure is that he wouldn't be at 100 percent (in eight days),"" added Gosp Server."
521,27/02/2018,01:16,"Neymar suffers fractured metatarsal, serious doubt to face Real","Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar suffered a sprained ankle and a fractured metatarsal when he was stretchered off in Sunday's win over Marseille, the Ligue 1 leaders announced on Monday.","The Brazilian, who signed for PSG in a world-record move from Barcelona last year, is now a serious injury doubt for the Champions League last-16 second leg against Real Madrid at the Parc des Princes on March 6. PSG trail in the tie after a 3-1 first-leg defeat in Spain, with their hopes of a maiden Champions League title taking a further body blow with the confirmation of Neymar's injury, although they didn't specify how long the 26-year-old would be out of action. ""Additional examinations performed today (ultrasound and CT) confirmed an external sprain of the right ankle, but also an associated fissure of the fifth metatarsal,"" PSG said in a short statement. The chances of Neymar returning to fitness in time to face the reigning European champions now appear extremely slim. He is all but certain to miss Wednesday's French Cup quarter-final against Marseille and the weekend's Ligue 1 visit to Troyes, with the Real clash just three days later. Metatarsal injuries usually take weeks, if not months to recover from. Just last year, Neymar's international team-mate Gabriel Jesus was out of action for two months after breaking a metatarsal with Manchester City, and has struggled with further injuries since. Former England stars David Beckham and Wayne Rooney spent six weeks on the sidelines with metatarsal injuries in the past, with both still arguably being rushed back too soon for the 2002 and 2006 World Cups respectively. Brazil fans will also be keeping a close eye on Neymar's fitness, especially after he missed their 2014 World Cup thrashing by Germany with injury. PSG, who lead the French top flight by a massive 14 points, also said that Brazilian centre-back Marquinhos had picked up a leg muscle problem. Neymar was stretchered off in anguish towards the end of PSG's 3-0 victory over their great rivals in the capital, having innocuously rolled his right ankle and flopped to the ground in pain. With the game already as good as over, the stadium held its breath as he was treated and then carried away, with PSG forced to finish the match with 10 men having made all of their substitutions. Neymar himself posted a picture on Instagram of his right leg with the ankle and foot heavily bandaged, before later appearing to delete the post. ""08:10. Finished for today,"" said the caption. French newspaper Le Parisien had earlier reported that tests on Monday morning had ruled out a ""fracture of a serious sprain"". But the club later confirmed their fans' worst fears, with the return game against Real just eight days away. Despite the injury potentially benefiting Madrid, the Spanish side's coach Zinedine Zidane claimed he hoped Neymar would recover in time to play. ""I'm not happy with the Neymar injury and I hope he can be back for the game. I will never want a rival player to be out injured,"" Zidane said at a press conference in the Spanish capital earlier on Monday. While Neymar was leaving the Parc des Princes on crutches on Sunday, PSG coach Unai Emery insisted he was ""optimistic"". ""We will be optimistic. If I had to say today (whether or not he will face Real) I would rather say yes,"" said the Spaniard. But now his team's hopes of keeping their European dream alive are hanging by a thread, despite the continued presence up front of Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe. PSG have never reached the Champions League final, and lost at the last-16 stage last season after a humiliating 6-1 second-leg thrashing by a Neymar-inspired Barcelona, having won the first game 4-0."
522,26/02/2018,18:53,Bale and Real aiming to sustain momentum with PSG on the horizon,Gareth Bale and Real Madrid may each have enjoyed a recent revival but their challenge now is to maintain momentum ahead of next week's crunch Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain.,"Real travel to Espanyol in La Liga on Tuesday, looking to reduce the gap behind leaders Barcelona, who visit Las Palmas two days later. Second-placed Atletico Madrid, meanwhile, host Leganes on Wednesday. But, with Barca 14 points clear of Los Blancos and all-but uncatchable at the top, the priority for Zinedine Zidane's side is to keep the winning feeling after five victories on the bounce. Particularly eager will be Bale, who has endured an injury-hit season, but delivered a statement performance, and a goal, in Saturday's 4-0 thrashing of Alaves. With next week's crunch Champions League second leg against PSG looming, the Welshman will be looking to reassert his part in the three-pronged threat with Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, Real's traditional 'BBC'. Bale's place is not secure. He was left out of the starting line-up against Leganes last week, while Zidane's preference of Isco in the first leg against PSG was vindicated, as his team ran out 3-1 winners. The talented Marco Asensio also made a decisive contribution off the bench. But, at his best, Bale remains a formidable force and Espanyol may well find an opponent this week keen to prove a point. ""Every day it is much better, it is what we want, we want to see a 100 percent Gareth,"" Zidane said on Monday. ""The other day he played a great game, scored a goal. The most important thing is his participation in the game and he has done very well."" There is an attacking conundrum to be solved too at Barcelona, where Saturday's 6-1 drubbing of Girona thrust into view the 'fabulous four' of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele. Coutinho, who arrived from Liverpool in January, and Dembele, whose debut season in Spain has been thwarted by fitness problems, are the new additions. They may both be retained against Las Palmas but it remains to be seen whether coach Ernesto Valverde believes he can risk the whole quartet against more established opposition. Barca host Atletico Madrid on Sunday and then Chelsea in the Champions League next month. On Coutinho and Dembele, Valverde said: ""These are two players who can help us a lot, with different styles. Coutinho can play more in the hole, he is technically comfortable, and Dembele is more of an out-and-out winger."" Barca's chief rivals for the title remain Atletico, who sit seven points adrift, and this weekend's meeting will offer Diego Simeone's side a rare chance to close the gap. First, however, they must overcome Leganes and claim an eighth consecutive victory to follow Sunday's emphatic 5-2 win at Sevilla. French forward Antoine Griezmann, instrumental as ever, scored a hat-trick. ""He is very good, an extraordinary footballer,"" Simeone said after the match. ""Everyone is currently in a brilliant run of form. We played good football and must continue in this way."" Elsewhere on Wednesday, Valencia, in fourth, visit Athletic Bilbao, and Villarreal, in fifth, travel to eighth-placed Eibar. Sixth-placed Sevilla are away at Malaga.

The European champions have two La Liga fixtures to negotiate before their crunch meeting with PSG, starting with a trip to Espanyol on Tuesday. They then host Getafe on Saturday. One player hoping to cement his starting spot against PSG will be Gareth Bale, who scored and played 90 minutes in Saturday's 4-0 thumping of Alaves.

He has made several blunders lately but Stephane Cassard, Marseille's goalie coach, insists he has full confidence in Pele. ""He does not even have to prove his mental qualities anymore,"" Cassard told AFP. ""Just look at the number of clean sheets Yohann has in his career."" Last season, Pele held the opposition scoreless 18 times in 38 appearances for Marseille. His percentage is even better this season. In just eight games in all competitions, he has kept five clean sheets. Pele, who is 35, was sidetracked by ill health and missed most of three years after suffering a pulmonary embolism in 2010 while with Toulouse. Recently, Pele has been plagued by sporting rather than health worries. After coming on as a sub in Saint Etienne he allowed a cross to loop over his head to set up a goal that cost Marseille two points. On Thursday in the Europa League, he hit one clearance straight to an opponent. Braga could not capitalise on the chance and Marseille won comfortably, but such incidents can create doubt. ""Yohann showed what he can do over a whole season,"" Cassard said. ""He can take it. That's why I first chose him."" Cassard and Franck Passi, a longtime Marseille coach who had a couple of spells as interim manager, brought Pele to the club in 2016. Cassard says that the player did not ""even want talk about number one or number two."" ""When one has experienced a serious illness, as he has, and been forced from the pitch for three years, and one succeeds in returning to the highest level, that says something. He can face anything."" ""Yohann was backup to Steve Mandanda who had proved over nine years that he was a top goalie,"" said Cassard. When Mandanda left for Crystal Palace, ""few believed in Pele when he took over,"" recalled Cassard. Mandanda returned in the summer. Having been, briefly, No.1, Pele became No.1b. ""I have two great goalies,"" said manager Rudi Garcia who also coached Pele for one season at Le Mans. ""These are intelligent lads with lots of experience,"" said Cassard. ""Yohann knows why he is still at Marseille. We all get on well, there is no misunderstanding, the situation is clear""."

It would be a fifth league crown in six seasons for the Parisians but, for all the money poured into the club by their Qatari owners, PSG have not been able to translate domestic domination into European success, with the 6-1 humiliation at Barcelona a year ago the low point. Emery attracted a lot of the blame for that performance and for the loss to Zinedine Zidane's Real at the Santiago Bernabeu, where he removed striker Edinson Cavani with the score still level. But the former Sevilla coach argues that PSG are much better at home, where they had beaten Barca 4-0 in the first leg last season. ""It is above all at the Parc that we remain a powerful force,"" he added. ""Marseille and Real Madrid know they have to come to Paris, but they don't really know what is facing them. Together we will do it."" Cavani scored twice in a 5-2 romp against Strasbourg last weekend, the second set up by world-record signing Neymar. But Cavani's on-field gestures make it clear he thinks the Brazilian should pass to him more often and their strained relationship is under the microscope. For Marseille, there might never be a better time to go to the Parc des Princes as they look to end a 15-match winless streak against PSG dating back to November 2011. They have not finished in the top three since 2013 but are regaining some consistency and punch under Rudi Garcia and enter the weekend one point behind Monaco in the race to finish second. The warm-up to the main event is the latest round in another of France's bitterest rivalries as Saint-Etienne travel the 70 kilometres to Lyon. Whatever happens on the field, expect fireworks. Lyon's thumping 5-0 victory in the return fixture in November saw captain Nabil Fekir provoke anger from the Saint-Etienne fans by holding up his shirt in front of them, culminating in a yellow card and a one-match suspension. Both sets of fans have been persistently guilty of setting off flares at games and the resentment between the clubs runs deep. Bruno Genesio's Lyon have gone four league matches without a win to slip six points adrift of Marseille in the race for a Champions League spot.

But goals after the break from Nicolas Pepe and Brazilian striker Luiz Araujo earned Christophe Galtier's side a point that left Lille just one place above the relegation zone. Lyon looked the side most capable of troubling Paris Saint-Germain after beating the league leaders in January, but a subsequent rotten run of form means they could finish the weekend six points adrift of third-placed Marseille.

The 34-year-old Dante joined Nice from Wolfsburg in 2016 and this was his first strike for them in 55 league games.

530,17/02/2018,22:29,"Cavani, Neymar key as PSG rebound from Madrid gloom",Edinson Cavani struck twice as Paris Saint-Germain beat Strasbourg 5-2 on Saturday to relieve some of the pressure on the runaway Ligue 1 leaders following their Champions League defeat at Real Madrid.,"Strasbourg struck early through Jean Eudes Aholou, but PSG hit back courtesy of a Julian Draxler effort before two goals in as many minutes from Neymar and Angel Di Maria put the home side in control. Stephane Bahoken pulled one back midway through the second half as Strasbourg threatened an unlikely comeback, but Cavani's league-best 22nd and 23rd goals of the season ensured victory for Unai Emery's team. ""The victory was important after the match on Wednesday. We win all our home matches,"" said Emery, whose side last dropped points at the Parc des Princes in May. ""We have to show we can maintain this level of play against bigger teams, without meaning any disrespect to Strasbourg."" He added: ""We spoke about (the Madrid defeat) in the dressing room. Of course they remember the match from Wednesday. That's normal so it's important to speak about positive things. We feel very strong at the Parc."" Captain Thiago Silva and Di Maria were recalled after Emery faced criticism for dropping them for the 3-1 loss in Madrid, and the coach was whistled by a section of home supporters unhappy with the Spaniard's decisions in midweek. Neymar was largely overshadowed by Cristiano Ronaldo in Spain on Wednesday, but the Brazilian could have struck within 90 seconds in Paris when he was denied the legs of Strasbourg goalkeeper Alexandre Oukidja. The visitors, who inflicted PSG's first defeat of the season in early December, sprang another surprise by grabbing the lead on six minutes following a clinical counter-attack. Neymar was guilty of overplaying and lost possession allowing Strasbourg to break with great effect, the move finishing off with Aholou steering home a precise first-time finish from Kenny Lala's cross. PSG responded quickly though as an intended pass through from Neymar was diverted straight into the path of Draxler who swept low into the far corner for his first league goal in over three months. The hosts promptly surged ahead as Neymar, picked out lurking on the far side of the box by Giovani Lo Celso, exhibited terrific composure and a deft touch to eliminate two defenders and tap home after his initial effort was kept out by Oukidja. A dreadful lapse of concentration from Pablo Martinez then allowed Di Maria to pinch the ball from the centre-back within seconds of the restart and drill beyond Oukidja for PSG's third. Oukidja shovelled away a powerful Cavani header and Di Maria fluffed a glorious chance to extend the lead after Dani Alves had squared for the Argentine, but Bahoken gave Strasbourg a lifeline as he guided home from the edge of the box on 67 minutes. However, Cavani allayed fears of another late PSG collapse with a clever chipped finish over the advancing Oukidja, and the Uruguayan struck again 11 minutes from time after latching on to an assist from Neymar. Elsewhere, Saint-Etienne secured a third win in four outings with a 1-0 victory at Angers, Montpellier climbed to fifth after a 1-1 home draw with Guingamp, and Troyes moved out the relegation zone thanks to a 1-0 win over Metz. Diafra Sakho netted his first league goals for Rennes following his January move from West Ham in a 2-2 draw away to Caen, with the hosts left to rue a pair of missed penalties. Defending champions Monaco eased to a 4-0 home win over Dijon on Friday as Pietro Pellegri eclipsed Kylian Mbappe to become the youngest player in the club's history. The win, which saw Pellegri -- at 16 years, 10 months and 30 days -- beat Mbappe's previous record set in December 2015, kept second-placed Monaco 12 points behind PSG. Lyon will look to arrest a three-match losing streak away to Lille on Sunday, while third-placed Marseille can return to within a point of Monaco if they beat a resurgent Bordeaux at the Velodrome."

532,16/02/2018,16:14,PSG coach refuses 'future' talk after Real defeat,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery refused to ""waste his energy"" worrying about his job after the 3-1 first-leg last-16 defeat to Real Madrid when questioned on Friday.","One of the sub plots of the ""clash of the round"" was which manager, Emery or Madrid handler Zinedine Zidane, would lose his job if his side lost. But Emery, whose team led Barcelona 4-0 after the first-leg in the last-16 last season only to throw their chance away by losing the away match 6-1, was always under more pressure than Zidane who has led his side to back-to-back European titles. ""My future is the present. Getting ready for tomorrow's game and getting ready for Real. I won't waste my energy (talking about my future),"" Emery said on the eve of Paris's home game with Strasbourg. ""I remain convinced that PSG can qualify,"" he said in the wake of Wednesday's disappointing first-leg result. ""I believe the team had a good game against the best team in the world. I am convinced we can win and get through to the next round,"" he insisted. ""I am happy with the way the players responded to what happened even if that was not the result we were looking for,"" he said. PSG took a first-half lead before a controversial penalty converted by Cristiano Ronaldo levelled the score before half-time. Emery took off an isolated Edinson Cavani in the second half and while Neymar and Kylian Mbappe could not turn PSG's edge in possession into goals, Ronaldo and Marcello seized their chances and fired Madrid into a highly protectable lead for the return on March 6. Taking off Cavani ""was a tactical choice I made during the game,"" Emery said. ""For me (Neymar) had a great game, made some very good moves. It comes down to details,"" he lamented. ""At home he will show how good he is,"" promised the man who's job depends on it."
533,15/02/2018,18:25,Emery's PSG under pressure after Madrid setback,Runaway Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain find themselves under pressure for the first time this season after Wednesday's Champions League defeat at Real Madrid.,"Unai Emery's men have blown away all before them domestically this term, but with world-record signing Neymar failing to fire and captain Thiago Silva left to sulk on the Santiago Bernabeu bench, Cristiano Ronaldo led struggling Real to a 3-1, first-leg win. That leaves PSG needing an unlikely comeback to reach the quarter-finals, having fallen at the last-16 stage in dramatic fashion to Barcelona last season. Failure to reach the final this season, even if a domestic treble of Ligue 1, French Cup and League Cup titles is won, could see Emery's job in danger and the rumours of a Neymar exit intensify. Neymar's fellow Brazilian and Real left-back Marcelo said before the match that he thinks ""Neymar will play for Real Madrid one day"". But the Spanish press were not impressed with the 25-year-old as Ronaldo stole the show, with Marca writing on Thursday: ""His match was not that of a Ballon d'Or (winner). The real Ballon d'Or was at the other end of the pitch, with the No. 7 on his back."" The French capital-city side return to action on Saturday with what looks to be a straightforward league game against Strasbourg at the Parc des Princes, despite losing for the first time this season at the newly-promoted outfit in December. Spaniard Emery has some tricky decisions to make ahead of the weekend and, more importantly, the second leg in two weeks' time, after dropping Silva just hours before the Real match and replacing the Brazilian with 22-year-old Presnel Kimpembe. ""It was the choice of the coach,"" said Silva's usual centre-back partner Marquinhos. ""He had all the players available and, (Silva) is our captain, a very important player who kept a positive attitude in the dressing room."" Silva's wife wasn't so positive, though, criticising Emery on social media saying: ""Tactics, tactics, what tactics?"" The fact that PSG are coming under so much fire for losing what was a tight contest at the defending European and Spanish champions shows how high expectations have risen, and Strasbourg can expect to face a backlash on Saturday, whoever Emery selects. Elsewhere in Ligue 1 this weekend, champions Monaco host Dijon on Friday bidding to strengthen their grip on a Champions League place after taking second from Marseille last time out. Stevan Jovetic stepped up with two goals in the absence of the injured Radamel Falcao in the 4-0 thrashing of Angers, while Keita Balde has also started to hit form. When Lyon stunned PSG to move to within eight points of the leaders last month an unlikely title challenge looked possible, but three straight defeats have left them four points adrift of Marseille in the third and final Champions League spot. Bruno Genesio's men visit relegation-threatened Lille on Sunday, while Marseille host Bordeaux. The enigmatic Italian striker was booked last week for complaining about racist abuse at Dijon, with the French league since opening an investigation into the incident. Nice will be looking to Balotelli on Sunday to help them end a three-match losing streak against Nantes, in a crucial match in the fight for a Europa League spot behind the top four. Balotelli has scored 19 goals in 26 matches this season, while being booked 11 times and sent off once."
534,15/02/2018,13:38,PSG coach Emery up against it after big decisions backfire,"Unai Emery has been in a constant battle to win over the doubters since joining Paris Saint-Germain, but the pressure on him is now greater than ever after Wednesday's 3-1 defeat by Real Madrid.","A year after the spectacular collapse in Barcelona and the 6-1 defeat that sent them packing from the Champions League in the last 16 despite a 4-0 win in the first leg, again PSG fell apart late on against one of Spain's giants. Having looked the more likely team to win the last 16, first leg at the Santiago Bernabeu, and at least been on course to leave with a precious draw, Paris now face an uphill struggle to save the tie. Emery cannot shoulder all of the blame if his players are unable to cope with the pressure at crucial moments in such games. However, he would have had a sleepless night after returning to Paris with the big decisions he made on Wednesday backfiring. From leaving a player of Thiago Motta's experience out altogether, to dropping captain Thiago Silva and choosing to play 21-year-old Giovani Lo Celso in midfield, Emery gambled big before kick-off. Then he decided to take off the clubs's all-time record goal-scorer, Edinson Cavani, in the second half, only to replace him with a right-back in Thomas Meunier. Angel Di Maria, a proven big-game performer and PSG's best player in 2018, was left on the bench. ""The result will make us see things differently, but the team deserved better,"" claimed Emery. But when compared with opposite number Zinedine Zidane, for whom Marco Asensio came on and set up late goals for Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcelo, it does not look good for him. ""The match was just a few centimetres away from proving him right with the big decisions he made,"" wrote Vincent Duluc in French sports daily L'Equipe. ""But, cruelly, the Madrid night ended up highlighting the weak points of a coach guided by his science more than his instinct."" Emery was attacked by the wives of Silva and Di Maria on social media after leaving out the pair, and he faces a fight to keep the PSG dressing room together ahead of the return leg on March 6. PSG are on course to recapture the Ligue 1 title from Monaco and remain in the domestic cup competitions, but they did not commit the two biggest transfer fees in the history of the game last year to sign Neymar and Kylian Mbappe just to continue their domination in France. Emery's contract is due to expire at the end of the season, although it remains to be seen if he would even last until then if PSG fail to go through to the quarter-finals. ""I think that we have a chance at home, with our supporters behind us,"" insisted Emery. ""We will make Real Madrid suffer. We have the character to turn it around."" History is not on the 46-year-old's side, though. He has never won a knockout tie in the competition in five previous Champions League seasons with Valencia, Spartak Moscow, Sevilla and Paris. His difficulties communicating in French have perhaps not helped his image in Paris, and his achievements in Spain, notably at Sevilla, cannot be dismissed. But even in his home country he has his doubters, all the more so after another defeat at the Bernabeu, where he has now lost 10 times and drawn once in 11 visits as a coach. ""Players like Neymar deserve better allies on the bench,"" wrote Rafa Cabeleira in El Pais."
535,15/02/2018,10:23,Advantage Ronaldo but Neymar warns it's not over yet,Paris Saint-Germain face a huge task to reach the Champions League quarter-finals after Cristiano Ronaldo defied predictions his powers are waning with two goals as Real Madrid won 3-1 in the first leg of their last-16 tie.,"Billed as a contest between World Player of the Year Ronaldo and his Brazilian heir-in-waiting Neymar, the 33-year-old Portuguese came out emphatically on top as he became the first player to score 100 Champions League goals for the same club. On a pulsating evening in the Bernabeu, Ronaldo dragged Real level with a penalty after Adrien Rabiot had given PSG the lead, fed by a cheeky Neymar backheel. As PSG seemed to be heading for a draw that would have put the French side in the driving seat for the return leg on March 6, Ronaldo turned the match in Madrid's favour with a scrappy goal that bounced in off his knee. As Madrid poured forward, Marcelo piled on the pain with an 86th-minute volley to show PSG -- who have never won the Champions League -- the value of the experience of winning the competition 12 times. ""Real Madrid love the Champions League and as players we can feel that on the pitch,"" Ronaldo said after being named man of the match. ""Today things worked out for me, scoring two goals and helping the team win, but we know the tie is not finished yet."" Neymar, who cut a dejected figure at the end, said his side ""committed errors at certain moments"". ""We were not mature enough at the end of the match,"" the 26-year-old Brazilian said. ""We didn't play badly, but I think we need to be better if we want to eliminate Real Madrid. It is difficult, but nothing is impossible."" The return leg at the Parc des Princes will be the hottest ticket in Europe. With Real trailing bitter rivals Barcelona by 17 points in the Spanish league, coach Zinedine Zidane's job seemed in danger before this tie. He paid tribute to his talisman, who despite showing signs of fallibility in La Liga this season has scored 11 goals in Europe in just seven matches. ""With Ronaldo it's difficult to always say the same thing. He has shown once again that he always turns up in the big games,"" Zidane said. The Frenchman said he would savour the victory, but warned his side to guard against complacency against PSG. ""There is a second leg to come where we will need to play with a lot of intensity. We know we are going to suffer."" PSG coach Unai Emery, who has never been further than the Champions League round of 16 in five previous attempts, gambled with a young lineup, starting with 21-year-old Argentinian midfielder Giovani Lo Celso and 22-year-old defender Presnel Kimpembe. But it was the Spaniard's decision to withdraw the club's all-time top scorer Edinson Cavani with half an hour to go that potentially cost him dear. With PSG's attacking edge lost, Real clawed their way back into the game. The Paris side's Qatari backers stuck with Emery last season despite a humiliating 6-1 defeat to Barcelona in the last 16, but they are unlikely to show the same patience if the second most expensive squad in history fails to overcome Real. ""The team played well and deserved better,"" Emery said. ""We have to be optimistic and positive for the match in Paris. We still have a good chance of getting through."""
536,15/02/2018,02:39,Zidane expects Real to 'suffer' in Paris after first-leg win,Zinedine Zidane warned his Real Madrid players that they can expect to suffer in the return leg of their Champions League tie with Paris Saint-Germain despite seeing Cristiano Ronaldo inspire a 3-1 comeback victory on Wednesday.,"The reigning European champions stunned the PSG of Neymar in the last 16, first-leg showdown with two goals in the final seven minutes at the Santiago Bernabeu from Ronaldo and Marcelo. Ronaldo had earlier drawn Madrid level with his 100th Champions League goal for the club from the penalty spot on the stroke of half-time, cancelling out Adrien Rabiot's opener for the French side. ""We can afford to have a bit of euphoria tonight. We have to be satisfied, and enjoy this,"" said Zidane. ""But there is a second leg to come where we will need to play with a lot of intensity. We know we are going to suffer."" Real had already suffered for large spells of Wednesday's match, before PSG collapsed defensively in the closing stages, unable to adjust after Zidane sent on Marco Asensio. Striker Asensio set up the two late goals, and Zidane will take plenty of credit for the impact his substitutions had on the game just when it looked as though PSG would leave the Spanish capital with the edge in the tie. Zidane, under pressure because of Real's indifferent domestic form, again saw the Champions League bring the best out of his team and Ronaldo. ""With Ronaldo it's difficult to always say the same thing. He has shown once again that he always turns up in the big games,"" said Zidane, after the Portuguese became the first player to score 100 Champions League goals for the same club. He has scored 11 this season in Europe in just seven matches, and he won the battle of the superstars at the Bernabeu with PSG's Neymar. ""Real Madrid love the Champions League and as players we can feel that on the pitch,"" Ronaldo said after collecting his man of the match prize. ""Today things worked out for me, scoring two goals and helping the team win, but we know the tie is not finished yet."" While Real are looking to win the European Cup for the third year running -- something no club has done since Bayern Munich in 1976 -- and the 13th time overall, PSG risk seeing their wait for a first Champions League crown go on. A year after they fell apart in historic fashion to lose 6-1 in Barcelona at the same stage of the competition after winning 4-0 at home, here was another late collapse on Spanish soil. Coach Unai Emery surely needs to win this tie to remain in the job, but he took big decisions that backfired. Captain Thiago Silva was left out, 21-year-old Giovani Lo Celso started in midfield and Angel Di Maria stayed on the bench even when Edinson Cavani came off in the second half. ""The team played well and deserved better. We have to be optimistic and positive for the match in Paris. We still have a good chance of getting through,"" claimed Emery, who has drawn once and lost 10 times in 11 visits to the Bernabeu as a coach. Emery tried to turn the focus on Italian referee Gianluca Rocchi, saying the penalty the hosts got for a Lo Celso challenge on Toni Kroos was soft. He also felt his side should have had a spot-kick for a Sergio Ramos handball. ""When we play against a big team, it's the same, always,"" bemoaned PSG president Nasser Al Khelaifi. ""Last year against Barcelona, this year against Real Madrid. OK, Real Madrid are a big club, but that's enough now. UEFA have to do something."""
537,15/02/2018,01:29,"'Nothing is impossible', says Neymar after PSG lose to Real",Neymar insisted that Paris Saint-Germain can still qualify for the Champions League quarter-finals despite losing 3-1 to Real Madrid in the first leg of their last-16 tie on Wednesday.,"""My analysis is that we committed errors at certain moments. We were not mature enough at the end of the match,"" the world's most expensive player told Brazilian media after PSG squandered the lead at the Santiago Bernabeu. Adrien Rabiot had put the French side ahead, but Cristiano Ronaldo's double strike and a Marcelo goal turned the game on its head in the Spanish capital. ""We didn't play badly, but I think we need to be better if we want to eliminate Real Madrid,"" added Neymar. He was in the Barcelona side that lost 4-0 away to PSG in the first leg of the last 16 last season, before a stunning 6-1 victory in the return. On PSG's chances of beating Real in the return leg on March 6, he said: ""I think it is difficult, but nothing is impossible. Last year I was in a much worse situation and we managed to get through. I hope we will be able to play better."""
538,14/02/2018,14:31,Neymar and PSG aim to depose mighty Real in Champions League,Title-holders Real Madrid face Neymar's Paris Saint-Germain in a blockbuster Champions League clash on Wednesday with the French club needing to erase the painful memory of their collapse last time they came to Spain.,"Propelled by the riches of their Qatari owners, PSG dream of following in Real's footsteps and becoming kings of Europe, a year after their humiliating exit in the last 16 at the hands of Barcelona. On that occasion, having won 4-0 in the first leg, PSG collapsed in the return at the Camp Nou, going down 6-1. ""This is a chance for us to keep growing as a club by playing against the reigning champions and the team that has won the most titles. We want to get to that level,"" said PSG's Spanish coach Unai Emery ahead of Wednesday's last 16, first leg at the 81,000-seat Santiago Bernabeu, which kicks off at 1945 GMT. Emery said his side -- who will be backed by 4,000 fans in the Spanish capital -- had learnt from that defeat a year ago and are ""better prepared now"". The pressure on him is immense, with PSG's owners unlikely to look kindly on a second consecutive exit at this stage of the Champions League given the extent of their investment at the start of this season. The mastermind of Barcelona's stunning comeback that night, Neymar, is now a PSG player, having cost the French club a world-record fee of 222 million euros ($264 million). They also committed 180 million euros to take 19-year-old striker Kylian Mbappe from Monaco. ""It is not easy to win a competition like this. We need to go through a lot of things on the way, but each season, and every day that goes by, we are working and getting closer to our objective,"" said PSG's Brazilian defender Marquinhos. If domestic form is anything to go by, then PSG look in great shape. They have won 14 out of 15 games since the end of the Champions League group, while Real flounder in fourth place in La Liga, 17 points behind leaders Barcelona. Just as Emery can ill afford a defeat over two legs -- the return will be in Paris on March 6 -- so Real coach Zinedine Zidane's future likely depends on the outcome of the tie. ""I am not thinking about my future. I am only thinking about the match,"" the Frenchman insisted on the eve of the game. History is on Real's side -- they are the 12-time European champions, winners in each of the last two seasons. In Cristiano Ronaldo, Madrid have the current Ballon d'Or and a player who has scored 99 times for them in the Champions League. The Portuguese has 43 goals in his last 43 appearances in the knockout phase. Neymar, meanwhile, is seen by many in Madrid as the man Real president Florentino Perez should try to sign to succeed Ronaldo, now 33. Marcelo, the Real left-back and an international colleague of the Brazilian forward, said at the weekend that he could see Neymar one day in the home dressing room at the Bernabeu. Marquinhos, meanwhile, insisted Neymar is not unsettled by the speculation. ""He knows very well how to control his emotions. He handles the pressure and responds on the field,"" he said. Mbappe is in the spotlight, too. The teenager is the youngest player to reach 10 Champions League goals -- and PSG beat Real to his signature last August. PSG's front three of Neymar, Mbappe and Edinson Cavani have scored 70 goals between them, compared to 38 for Real's 'BBC' of Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema. ""Neymar is a great player, but we have to think about the whole team, the collective is more important,"" said Marcelo. PSG travelled without veteran midfielder Thiago Motta, meaning recent signing Lassana Diarra is tipped to start against his old club. For Real, Nacho should replace the banned Dani Caravajal at right-back."
539,13/02/2018,22:04,Neymar not unsettled by Real speculation - Marquinhos,"Neymar has not been affected by the rumours linking him with a move to Real Madrid, his Paris Saint-Germain teammate Marquinhos insisted ahead of the sides' Champions League showdown.","""I don't see him as being destabilised. He knows very well how to control his emotions. He handles the pressure and responds on the field,"" said Marquinhos of his fellow Brazilian at a press conference at the Santiago Bernabeu. ""He is a great person with a great entourage. We leave him to do his job on the field. ""He came to Paris to do great things and tomorrow's (Wednesday's) match is a chance for him."" Madrid left-back Marcelo had earlier done his bit to fuel the speculation, saying: ""Madrid fans like good players. Any fan would like to have Neymar in their team."" That was after he gave an interview to Brazilian television saying that his international colleague would one day play for the Spanish giants. Real had been interested in Neymar before he joined Barcelona in 2013, and he then moved to Paris last August after the French side activated his 222 million-euro ($264 million) release clause to make him the world's most expensive player. Neymar has since averaged a goal a game in a PSG shirt, including scoring six times in the group stage of the Champions League. When asked by a Spanish journalist if he would rather have Cristiano Ronaldo in his team, PSG coach Unai Emery replied: ""I am delighted to have Neymar."" Real and PSG meet at the Bernabeu in the first leg of the last 16 before the return at the Parc des Princes on March 6."

For them, it all comes down to what they can do in Europe, where they have enjoyed such success in the past. Madrid are the record 12-time champions, and winners of the Champions League in each of the last two seasons. However, their recent domestic form has called into question Zidane's future as coach, and PSG have been feared in Spain ever since they swooped to sign Neymar from Barcelona for a world-record fee. ""I am not thinking about my future. I am only thinking about the match. I can only control what happens on the field and prepare for that,"" a relaxed-looking Zidane told reporters at Real's Valdebebas training complex on Tuesday. ""That is what is important. My future does not matter much."" It is hard to imagine Zidane's future not being tied to the outcome of this tie, with such an early exit from Europe unthinkable for a club who have been European champions in three of the last four seasons and reached at least the semi-finals in seven straight campaigns. The last time Madrid fell in the last 16, it was to a French side in Lyon in 2010. This is the first time that Zidane, a World Cup winner with France, has come up against a side from his home country as a coach. It is impossible not to also see this tie as a confrontation between the global superstars on each side in Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar. ""They are two great players. We are talking about a player (Ronaldo) who has done extraordinary things, won five Ballons d'Or, scored 500 goals. I am not going to compare them, I'm talking about my player,"" said Zidane. Ronaldo, at 33 exactly seven years Neymar's senior, stands on 99 Champions League goals for Real. ""Neymar is a similar player with the kind of qualities that can make the difference in a game. ""But it's not Ronaldo against Neymar that everyone wants to see, the fans want to see a good game."" The last time the sides met at the 81,000-seat Santiago Bernabeu was in the 2015/16 group stage, with Nacho scoring the hosts' winner. He is set to start here in the absence of suspended right-back Dani Carvajal, with Gareth Bale also tipped to return to the line-up. Paris have of course been in Spain since that game in 2015, and will never forget the 6-1 humiliation they suffered in Barcelona at the same stage of last year's Champions League. PSG fans are hoping there can be no repeat of such an embarrassing defeat, especially with Neymar -- who masterminded that Barcelona comeback -- now in their ranks. ""We lost an incredible match but it is just part of the development of the club,"" PSG striker Edinson Cavani told Spanish sports daily Marca. ""We lost and learnt from it. PSG have brought in new players since then, we have more experience."" However, one of the Qatar-owned club's most experienced players, Thiago Motta, was left out of the squad by coach Unai Emery. That means Lassana Diarra, the former Real player who joined PSG just last month, looks set to start in midfield, behind the star front three of Neymar, Cavani and Kylian Mbappe. PSG are staying at a plush hotel in a Madrid skyscraper built on the site of Real's old training ground near the Bernabeu, and will be backed by around 4,000 fans. As many as 1,800 police officers will be on duty to look out for trouble on what has been classified a ""high risk"" occasion."
541,13/02/2018,14:25,Zidane relaxed as Real Madrid get ready for PSG clash,Zinedine Zidane insists he is not letting the pressure get to him as he prepares his Real Madrid side for Wednesday's huge Champions League last-16 clash with Paris Saint-Germain at the Santiago Bernabeu.,"""I'm very happy. We all live for these moments. I don't feel any particular pressure,"" a relaxed Zidane said at a press conference at Real's Valdebebas training complex on Tuesday. ""We have prepared as we usually do. Certainly tomorrow (Wednesday) there will be a bit more pressure than usual, but I'm going to enjoy it. My future does not bother me much just now."" Zidane has been going through the toughest period of his short managerial career, with Real fourth in La Liga, a huge 17 points behind leaders Barcelona, albeit with a game in hand. That has led to speculation that the Frenchman's future as coach is on the line against a feared PSG side, with the two-time defending European champions putting all their hopes in the Champions League going into the first leg of this tie. ""I am just trying to get on with my work. This is my passion,"" said Zidane, who has won eight trophies as Real coach. ""I have nothing that I need to demonstrate."" The tie is a special one for the Marseille-born Zidane, as he faces a French club for the first time since being appointed Real coach in January 2016. The second leg will be in Paris on March 6. ""Playing against PSG as someone from Marseille, there has always been a rivalry there, but I'm not going to think about that. I just want a beautiful game of football."" Zidane got the full backing of Real's Brazilian left-back Marcelo, who said the former World Cup winner has a great relationship with the stars in the Madrid dressing room. ""He is a person who is very close to us and who helped us so much when he arrived here,"" said the 29-year-old. ""He is a great coach who has done so much for this team and will keep on doing so to get things back to how they used to be."" Marcelo will be coming up against his international team-mate Neymar, who he claimed ahead of the game in an interview with Brazilian television would ""one day play for Real Madrid"". ""Madrid fans like good players, and Neymar is a world star. Any fan would like to have Neymar in their team,"" he added on Tuesday. Real, though, are wary of the threats elsewhere in a PSG side also featuring the likes of Edinson Cavani and Kylian Mbappe. ""Of course Neymar is a great player who is on top of his game, but we are not only thinking about him."""
542,13/02/2018,01:47,Big-spending PSG still trailing in Real's financial shadow,"Paris Saint-Germain smashed the world-record transfer fee last year to sign Neymar from Barcelona, but despite the big spending driven by their Qatari owners, the French club still lag behind Real Madrid in terms of financial muscle.","Reigning European champions Real (647.6 million euros) made almost 200 million euros more in turnover than PSG (486.2 million) last year, according to Deloitte. The Spanish giants host Unai Emery's side in the Champions League last 16, first leg on Wednesday, but can the Ligue 1 leaders ever expect to match their illustrious opponents off the pitch, never mind on it? In the world of club football, Real have always stood alone in terms of sporting achievements as record 12-time European champions, but in recent years they have also dominated financially. The Madrid club posted the world's highest annual turnover for a decade until recently being overtaken by Manchester United, fuelled by the Premier League's astronomical TV rights. Real's prosperity in the 21st century was born from president Florentino Perez's 'Galactico' transfer strategy of paying whatever it took to buy the world's biggest stars. ""If Real have the best players in the world in each position, then revenue won't be a problem,"" Perez told AFP in 2016. Real broke the world-record transfer fee five times between 2000-2013 by signing Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane, Kaka, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. The club's other crucial asset is its Santiago Bernabeu stadium, to which Perez wants to add a roof, new reception areas, a shopping centre and even a hotel -- costing an estimated 400 million euros. ""This is a very busy stadium with large advertising space, many spaces for companies,"" said Jose Maria Gay de Liebana, economics professor at the University of Barcelona. ""The Santiago Bernabeu is a gold mine."" Real Madrid is the most powerful brand on the planet according to the 2017 ranking of Brand Finance, but PSG are on ""the same path"" according to Leibana. But he added: ""If we go to the other side of the world and ask people, everyone knows Real Madrid, and this isn't the case yet for PSG."" The difference between the two clubs' reach can be seen by their respective social media followings -- Real have approximately 190 million followers online compared to only 50 million for PSG. But situated in the French capital and backed by Qatar's billions, PSG have plenty of scope to make more money. Sports marketing specialist Frank Pons believes the Parisians need to continue copying Real's Galactico transfer tactics if they're to bridge the gap. ""In terms of reputation, transfers of 400 million euros in total for Neymar and (Kylian) Mbappe put (Paris) on the map very quickly,"" he said. ""This takes years to achieve normally, but they managed to do it quickly."" PSG still have a staggering amount of cash available to splash on players, with last month's 'Soccerex Football Finance 100' study ranking them above Real financially when taking into consideration money in the bank and potential investment from owners. Perhaps the biggest reason Real have an edge over PSG, though, is because of on-field success, as the French side have still never even reached a Champions League final. Neymar, Mbappe and co could go a long way towards changing the balance of power by beating their illustrious opponents at the Bernabeu on Wednesday."
543,08/02/2018,22:29,Blazing Marseille attack draws attention from Paris stars,"Marseille open the Ligue 1 weekend by taking one of the hottest attacks in Europe to the fortress of one of their ancient rivals, Saint-Etienne.","Marseille's motto is ""Straight to goal"" and they are living up to it in 2018 with 27 goals scored in all competitions since the start of the year as they have risen to second in the table. In the big five European leagues, only Paris Saint-Germain, whose superstars are running away with Ligue 1, have hit more. Marseille's total includes 15 league goals since January 1, two fewer than PSG and the same as Barcelona, Real Madrid and Lazio. In their last league game, Marseille scored five times in the first 56 minutes before easing up as they won 6-3 at home to Metz. On Tuesday, they travelled to second division Bourg-en-Bresse, rested several starters and won 9-0 in the French Cup. ""It's a hallmark of my teams that they have lots of different scorers,"" said Rudi Garcia, who built a similarly explosive attack when he guided Lille to the league title in 2011. Marseille have four scorers in double figures, led by Florian Thauvin with 14 and followed by Valere Germain on 13 and Morgan Sanson and Lucas Ocampos both on 10. The recent surge has been fuelled by the improving form of two veterans, Dimitri Payet and Kostas Mitroglou and the transformation of youngster, Clinton Njie, into Garcia's trump card off the bench. Thauvin, who has two international caps, is growing into a star in his second stint in Marseille. He hit a hat-trick against Metz and is both scoring and creating as he strives to force his way into the France squad for the World Cup. Mitroglou, the veteran Greek striker who has struggled since his signing last year, hit a hat-trick on Tuesday to follow a goal off the bench in Metz. ""He's starting to pay off his fee,"" Garcia said. Payet suggested his form is improving when he scored direct from a free kick for the first time in almost a year against Bourg. Saint-Etienne, reinforced by winter recruits Mathieu Debuchy, Paul-Georges Ntep, Neven Subotic and Yann M'Vila, have won two in a row. Yet while the Marseille attack is on fire, the worry is that the fans of the two clubs might set the stadium ablaze. The use of flares and smoke bombs by fans has more than doubled this season. The French authorities estimate that there have been 1,502 incidents so far, up from 679 at the same stage last season, French sports daily L'Equipe reported. Marseille fans lead this league with a score of 384 and were punished with partial closure of the Velodrome for the Metz game. Saint-Etienne are second in the smoke table. On Saturday, leaders PSG play in Toulouse in a last run out before the Valentine's Day Champions League encounter with Real Madrid. PSG will be without Kylian Mbappe after French football's disciplinary commission announced on Thursday that the young French striker would be banned for a second match for a foul on Ismaila Sarr of Rennes during the League Cup semi-final on January 30. Mbappe suffered a knock in January and has struggled for form. The enforced absence allows him to rest but also offers Angel Di Maria, who has been in sparkling form, the chance to cement a place in the lineup. e between Kylian Mbappe and Angel Di Maria has also been the subject of much scrutiny this week. Mbappe suffered a knock in January and has struggled for form just as the older Argentine has regained his sparkle."
544,06/02/2018,23:14,Di Maria fuels PSG as Marseille hit nine in French Cup,"Angel Di Maria scored a hat-trick as holders Paris Saint-Germain defeated second-tier Sochaux 4-1 on Tuesday to reach the French Cup quarter-finals, while Marseille demolished Ligue 2 outfit Bourg-en-Bresse 9-0.","The Argentine winger headed PSG, who were playing without the rested Neymar, ahead inside the first minute at the Stade Bonal in eastern France, but twice former winners Sochaux levelled through Florian Martin before the quarter hour. Edinson Cavani restored the lead for Unai Emery's team on 27 minutes when he turned in a Layvin Kurzawa cross at the far post, and Thiago Silva then rattled the crossbar with a header from a corner. Di Maria added a third just prior to the hour with a composed finish after he was released in behind the home defence by a pass from Italian midfielder Marco Verratti. He completed his hat-trick just three minutes later by forcing home a rebound from close range after Sochaux goalkeeper Lawrence Ati Zigi parried a fierce shot from Cavani. Dani Alves finished the game in goal for PSG after Kevin Trapp was sent off in the closing stages for a foul outside his area on Sochaux striker Thomas Robinet. Earlier, both Kostas Mitroglou and Lucas Ocampos scored hat-tricks as in-form Marseille crushed a hapless Bourg-en-Bresse in a heavily lopsided last 16 tie. Rudi Garcia's side, who are second in Ligue 1 after thrashing Metz 6-3 last week, romped into a 4-0 lead inside 20 minutes at the struggling Ligue 2 side and showed no mercy against hapless opponents. ""We had an actual nightmare, the two sides were a world apart,"" admitted Bourg-en-Bresse coach Herve Della Maggiore. ""We watched them play."" Despite making six changes to the starting XI, Marseille ended the tie as a contest with early goals from Luiz Gustavo, Dimitri Payet, Ocampos and Mitroglou. Greek international striker Mitroglou has struggled to nail down a place in the team since joining from Benfica last year, but he strolled through the vacant home defence to score the fifth before half-time. Argentinian Ocampos grabbed his second early in the second half, although he was made to wait to complete his treble as Marseille went a game-high 23 minutes without scoring before he headed home. Mitroglou quickly got back in on the act as some more awful defending allowed him to nod in his seventh goal for the club, before Clinton N'Jie wrapped up the scoring with number nine from the penalty spot. Marseille have now won eight and drawn one of their last nine matches in all competitions, scoring 30 goals in the process. But they fell well short of their record win -- a 19-0 French Cup victory over Stade Raphaelois in 1933."

Then come Argentine midfielder Angel Di Maria and Brazilian defender Marquinhos, both on 1.12m euros, Italian midfielder Thiago Motta (875,000 euros) and Argentine Javier Pastore (770,000 euros). The first non-Parisian on the list is Radamel Falcao, the Colombian striker who earns 750,000 euros a month and, because he is in Monaco, pays no taxes. The top ten is rounded out by Dani Alves, another Brazilian defender at PSG, who makes 700,000 euros. Next come three more PSG stars -- German striker Julian Draxler and Italian playmaker Marco Verratti both make 600,000. PSG's French striker Hatem Ben Arfa is tied on 500,000 euros a month with two Marseille players, the former West Ham player Dimitri Payet and Brazilian Luiz Gustavo. At the other end of the Ligue 1 salary table are Amiens, where the average monthly salary is 15,000 euros, including three players on just 2,800 euros. Since the sacking of the Marcelo Bielsa, who was making 560,000 euros a month to coach Lille before he stormed out, PSG's Unai Emery has become the highest earning manager on 450,000 euros a month. Next comes another man working tax-free in Monaco, Leonardo Jardim, on 350,000 closely followed by Claudio Ranieri, who won the English Premier League with Leicester in 2016 and makes 340,000 a month in Nantes."

Lyon doubled their lead before the half-hour as Bertrand Traore, making his first league start since early November, volleyed in at the near post past replacement keeper Seydou Sy. But Senegal international Balde held off a succession of defenders before rifling in a low angled drive to halve the deficit just three minutes later. Radamel Falcao then equalised on 36 minutes when he converted the rebound after seeing his penalty, awarded for a foul on Kamil Glik, saved initially by Anthony Lopes. It took the Colombian to 17 league goals for the season -- trailing only Paris Saint-Germain duo Edinson Cavani (21) and Neymar (18). But Monaco were reduced to 10 men on the stroke of half-time as Balde, booked moments earlier for kicking away the ball in frustration, was shown a second yellow card for a nasty foul on Ferland Mendy. The hosts then lost captain Falcao to a thigh injury 10 minutes into the second half, but it was his replacement Stevan Jovetic who set up Portugal international Lopes for the winning goal a minute from time. Lyon conceded possession cheaply inside their own half, and the Montenegrin striker rolled the ball into the path of Lopes who drilled into the far corner to complete a sensational turnaround and help avenge last month's 3-2 loss in the French Cup. ""It was a very tough match. We conceded two goals far too early, we lost two players to injury and had a man sent off, everything was against us,"" Lopes said. ""But we showed we are a strong team and we deserved to win on the basis of the second half. It's our best match in terms of solidarity, but not in quality. We showed that we're a real team."" The result bumped Monaco up to third, one point behind Marseille, while Lyon finished the weekend a point outside the Champions League places in fourth after dropping from second. ""It was a sin not to have won tonight,"" Lyon coach Bruno Genesio said. ""Even worse to lose after the way we started. We had a really good start but then we practically stopped playing when we were 2-0 ahead.""

After Saturday's trip north, PSG visit second-tier Sochaux in the French Cup and then host Toulouse in Ligue 1 before all eyes turn to the first leg of their Champions League last-16 clash with holders Real Madrid in Spain on February 14.

While PSG continue their inexorable march towards a fifth title in six years, the battle for second place intensifies this weekend as Lyon host defending champions Monaco on Sunday. It will be the second meeting in 10 days after Lyon dumped Monaco out in the last of 32 of the French Cup following a 3-2 victory at the Stade Louis II. But after six wins in seven league outings, Lyon slumped to a 3-1 defeat last time out on what was Gustavo Poyet's debut as Bordeaux coach having replaced the sacked Jocelyn Gourvennec. Monaco sealed a return to the French League Cup final on Wednesday as Radamel Falcao struck twice in a 2-0 defeat of Montpellier to set up a rematch against last year's winners PSG. ""He (Falcao) hadn't scored in three games but everyone knows he's a big player and all players know there are times when they don't score,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. ""Now we have time to think about the final, we will prepare better for the final than last season,"" he added, after seeing his side thrashed 4-1 by PSG a year ago. Marseille, who are level on 48 points with Lyon after Sunday's 2-2 home draw with Monaco, will look for a fifth league win in six when they host bottom-of-the-table Metz on Friday.

However Tite defended his team's biggest name ahead of this summer's World Cup in Russia, saying that it was not up to Neymar whether or not he took spot-kicks for his club. ""At top clubs, the coach decides the line-up, the squad, substitutes and set pieces. (The criticism) was very unfair."" Tite said in an interview with the GloboEsporte website. The incident fuelled rumours that Neymar is unhappy at PSG and failing to gell with other players, but he played downed the row after scoring another penalty in Saturday's 4-0 thumping of Montpellier.

The 28-year-old joined the club from Palermo in 2011 as the first major acquisition of the Qatari ownership era, but recent signings Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and Julian Draxler are limiting his chances. When Brazilian star Neymar arrived in the summer, Pastore diplomatically handed over his No.10 shirt to the world's most expensive player -- and also lost his place in the team. ""I want Javier Pastore to stay here with us. It's better for the team,"" Emery said on Monday of the player that club captain Thiago Silva accused of angling for a way out by returning late from the winter break. Emery acknowledged that Pastore may be keen on a move. ""I've spoken to him a great deal. What he says outside to others is something else, that's his responsibility,"" the Spanish coach said. ""Pastore is a great player. When he's fit he's an important element here. ""My opinion is that I want him to stay. But then it's up to him to see what he wants for himself. ""With the World Cup (coming up), all players want to play more."" Possessing sublime skills but with a tendency to disappear from games, Pastore has played 17 times in all competitions this season for PSG but featured only twice in 2017 for Argentina. And he has left little doubt as to what his intentions are. ""I need to play much, much more and try and get to the World Cup,"" he said on Saturday.

""Fabinho played a big match today, not only for the goal but for his defensive quality and ability to break the line,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. The chase for the Champions League places remains wide open in France, with Lyon, Marseille and Monaco separated by just one point in the hunt for the second and third spots behind PSG. ""One point each was fair. In the war for second place there are no easy games, and it will continue like this until May,"" Jardim added. Senegal striker Balde, a close-season signing from Lazio, pounced on a loose ball to race clear and clip home his sixth league goal for Monaco and give them the perfect start. But the lead lasted less than three minutes, as Monaco shot themselves in the foot. A low cross from Valere Germain caused havoc and Florian Thauvin put pressure on right-back Almamy Toure, who saw his clearance deflected straight into the air for Rami to nod in his first league goal for Marseille. The game settled down after its frenetic start, but Rudi Garcia's hosts should have forged ahead in the 27th minute when Dimitri Payet blazed over with the goal at his mercy. Marseille completed the turnaround in the 47th minute, as Payet whipped in a free-kick and Germain stooped to send a diving header past away goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. It was the 27-year-old's 12th goal for OM since joining from Monaco last July. The champions hit back four minutes later, though, as Brazilian midfielder Fabinho strolled straight through the middle of the Marseille backline and slotted the ball in off the post. Monaco thought they had retaken the lead, but Jemerson's header was ruled out by the linesman's flag, despite the defender not being one of two visiting players in an offside position when Rachid Ghezzal swung in a free-kick. Both sides had chances to snatch all three points, with Marseille keeper Steve Mandanda denying Ghezzal and Germain volleying agonisingly wide, but neither could find the winner they needed to go second. Brazilian star Malcom appeared to dive for a crucial penalty as 10-man Bordeaux upset high-flying Lyon 3-1 to give new coach Gustavo Poyet a winning start in Ligue 1. Malcom, the 50 million-euro ($62m, £44m) rated winger who has been linked with Arsenal, also scored the 27th-minute penalty to give Bordeaux a shock 2-0 lead. Poyet had already seen Nicolas De Preville put the home side in front in south-western France, with Gaetan Laborde scoring another penalty for the hosts after Marcelo had pulled one back for Lyon. Bordeaux had another Brazilian, Otavio, sent off after the break but they held on to make it two wins from two games since previous coach Jocelyn Gourvennec was sacked. The result was a big blow to Lyon, who had beaten PSG at home last weekend and then won at Monaco in the French Cup on Wednesday. PSG beat Montpellier 4-0 on Saturday, with Neymar scoring twice and Angel Di Maria also on target after Edinson Cavani got the opener to take him to a club record 157 goals in all competitions."
555,28/01/2018,01:45,Neymar brushes off penalty controversy,"Neymar played down the latest debate surrounding whether he or Edinson Cavani should be taking penalties for Paris Saint-Germain, after scoring a spot-kick against Montpellier on Saturday.","The world's most expensive player was booed by the PSG home fans despite scoring four goals in an 8-0 thrashing of Dijon a fortnight ago, after taking a penalty that could have given Cavani the club's all-time goalscoring record. But after Cavani had broken Zlatan Ibrahimovic's PSG record with the opener, the Brazilian was handed the ball by his strike partner to slot home a spot-kick for the first of his two goals in Saturday's 4-0 win. ""The coach has chosen me to take the penalties,"" Neymar told the Brazilian press. ""The coach decides that and I have to assume the responsibility. I know my responsibilities, I came here to take them on."" Spanish media reported earlier this week that the 25-year-old is unsettled in Paris and set to move to Real Madrid at the end of the season. When asked by reporters after the victory if he was happy at the Parc des Princes, a disgruntled Neymar said ""yeah, why?"" and walked out of the mixed zone. Although Neymar and Cavani have had their differences -- they had an infamous spat over who should take a penalty in September -- there is no doubt that they are a force to be reckoned with when in form. The Uruguayan set up Neymar to complete his double late on against Montpellier, although he may have been going for goal himself. The pair have now scored 53 goals between them in all competitions this season, with Cavani one ahead of the former Barcelona forward. Neymar was quick to praise his team-mate after Cavani's 157th PSG strike took him past Ibrahimovic. ""Of course (I'm happy) for 'Edi' who has become the best scorer in the history of Paris,"" he said. ""It's good for him. We are all very glad that he did it."" PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, who played a pivotal role in bringing Neymar to the French capital from Barca for 222 million euros ($264 million) in August, rubbished the Spanish media claims that his star attraction wants to leave. ""It's a rumour and of course it's not true,"" insisted the Qatari. ""He's happy here, he wants to stay here. He only came here five months ago and he still has four and a half years left on his contract. ""The Spaniards want to start a little (game), but we don't want to get into this game. He won't 100 percent be with us next season, but 2,000 percent."" Neymar was brought to PSG with a first Champions League title in mind and coach Unai Emery will be desperate to have the Brazil captain fully fit for the last 16, first-leg tie at Real on February 14. ""He is a different player, he is spectacular,"" the Spaniard said."
556,27/01/2018,20:15,Cavani says he can work with Neymar,"Edinson Cavani insisted that he is happy playing with Neymar at Paris Saint-Germain, after the Uruguayan broke the club's goalscoring record and his strike partner netted twice against Montpellier on Saturday.","The 30-year-old is PSG's top scorer this term with one more goal than world-record signing Neymar, who returned to the team for the first time since being booed after taking a penalty that could have given Cavani the record in an 8-0 thrashing of Dijon on January 17. But Cavani gave Neymar the ball to take a spot-kick in Paris on Saturday, and also set up the Brazilian to score his second late on and complete a 4-0 rout. ""He (Neymar) has done a lot and is doing a lot for the team,"" Cavani told Canal+, after Neymar's first appearance since scoring four goals against Dijon. ""We have to stay together. The most important thing is that the team works, we have important goals (for the season)."" Cavani broke Zlatan Ibrahimovic's all-time PSG record by tapping in his 157th goal for the club. The Uruguay striker had levelled Ibrahimovic's previous mark of 156 goals 10 days ago, and turned home Adrien Rabiot's cutback in the 11th minute at the Parc des Princes. ""I am very happy with the match, for the win, which is the most important thing,"" said Neymar. ""And of course for 'Edi' who has become the best scorer in the history of Paris. ""It's good for him. We are all very glad that he did it."" Neymar's double took his tally to 26 PSG goals since joining from Barcelona, and coach Unai Emery was delighted to have the 25-year-old back from a two-game injury absence. ""He is a different player, he is spectacular,"" the Spaniard said. ""After his small injury, he brought the little thing needed to help the team win again. ""I understand the (aggressive) tactics of our opponents because I did the same thing when I was in Spain and playing against (Lionel) Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo."" Cavani celebrated the record by throwing his shirt into the crowd, receiving a booking after shaking hands with the referee and having to take a new jersey from the bench. ""It's something magnificent, I'm very emotional,"" Cavani added. ""In life, you're not always given so much warmth. I'm very content, very happy to be here."" It was the 30-year-old's 27th goal for the Ligue 1 leaders in all competitions this season. Cavani has now scored 157 goals in 229 matches for the capital side since joining from Napoli for 64 million euros ($79.5 million) in 2013, while Ibrahimovic managed 156 in 180 games during his four seasons in Paris before leaving for Manchester United in 2016. ""When we signed 'Edi' for five years, we were really convinced he was the best scorer,"" said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi. ""Today, he proved it, it's a wonderful thing. You, the media, criticise a lot, but now we have the answer tonight -- he's the top scorer in PSG history."" PSG lead the Ligue 1 table by 11 points from second-placed Lyon, who beat Emery's side last weekend and visit Bordeaux on Sunday."
557,26/01/2018,20:02,Neymar returns to PSG squad from injury,"Neymar is back is in the Paris Saint-Germain squad for their Ligue 1 clash with Montpellier on Saturday after missing two matches with injury, the French league leaders announced on Friday.","PSG coach Unai Emery had hinted earlier that Neymar could play at the weekend after revealing that the Brazilian had returned to full training, and the club's squad list confirmed that the world's most expensive player was ready to return from a knock to his right thigh. ""All being well he'll play on Saturday, if he feels it's right,"" said Emery, who then heaped praise on his superstar attacker. Emery has called on fans to show Neymar more affection after he was booed for taking a penalty on his only league appearance of 2018, which denied Edinson Cavani a chance to break the PSG goalscoring record. Spaniard Emery also dismissed tales in Spanish media of interest in Neymar from struggling Real Madrid. ""Neymar will become the best player in the world and he will achieve that here with us,"" insisted Emery. PSG's fans backed Neymar during their team's midweek 4-2 French Cup win over Guingamp, unfurling a banner saying: ""To boo players runs contrary to our values"". Last weekend Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane described Neymar as a ""great player who everyone loves"". ""This is a player who has charmed everyone, the whole football world. He is a great player,"" said Zidane. Madrid fans will get a chance to judge for themselves as PSG and Real meet in the Champions League last-16 in February and March."
558,26/01/2018,02:20,Emery wants PSG fans to show Neymar 'affection',"Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery has called on fans to show Neymar more ""affection"", despite the Brazilian's excellent form since joining the Ligue 1 leaders.","The world's most expensive player has struggled with injury since the winter break and was booed for taking a penalty on his only league appearance of 2018 so far against Dijon, which denied Edinson Cavani a chance to break the PSG goalscoring record. But Neymar scored four times in an 8-0 rout that day and has been a key figure for the capital club this season with 24 goals, and Emery wants the PSG fans to get behind their star player. ""We need to give Neymar affection, he's a player we need to make the most of,"" the Spaniard said after Wednesday's 4-2 French Cup win over Guingamp. ""He is here, in Paris, and he's a great player."" PSG's ultras backed Neymar during the midweek game, unfurling a banner saying: ""To boo players runs contrary to our values."" PSG head into Saturday's game against Montpellier at the Parc des Princes with an eight-point lead at the Ligue 1 summit over Lyon, after Bruno Genesio's men became only the second team to beat them in the league this term last weekend. Neymar was absent for the 2-1 loss with an apparent thigh problem and hasn't played since returning from a rib injury for the thrashing of Dijon, while reports in Spain have claimed Real Madrid are hopeful of signing the 25-year-old. ""He's continuing his recovery with the physio, I hope he'll be back with the team very soon,"" Emery added. Kylian Mbappe is also an injury worry for the match against Montpellier, who have the best defensive record in the French top flight, having been stretchered off last Sunday after a clash with Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. ""He's fine, we'll see if he can return on Saturday, but I hope he'll be ready at the latest for Lille (on February 3). It was a hard knock and the risk is getting another blow,"" said Emery. Cavani's form in front of goal has dipped in recent weeks after a stellar start to the season, with the proximity of Zlatan Ibrahimovic's club scoring record appearing to have an adverse affect on his game. The Uruguayan is level with Ibrahimovic on 156 PSG goals, but he has scored just once in four outings, having managed 25 in 26 matches before that this season. PSG announced the signing of former Real Madrid and Chelsea midfielder Lassana Diarra earlier this week, but Saturday's game will likely come too early for the France international despite him training for the first time on Thursday. The race for the three Champions League spots could take a crucial turn on Sunday, when third-placed Marseille host reigning champions Monaco, who sit just a place and one point adrift. Second-placed Lyon will be looking to extend their unbeaten league run to eight matches when they visit Bordeaux, after following up the win over PSG with an impressive 3-2 cup victory at Monaco. The former Newcastle United flop has flourished since returning to Marseille permanently last year, already scoring 10 league goals this season. The 24-year-old winger could help Marseille strengthen their grip on a top-three spot on Sunday against Monaco, as he bids to secure his place in France coach Didier Deschamps' World Cup plans."
559,24/01/2018,21:07,No Neymar as PSG make Cup progress,Paris Saint-Germain made light of Neymar's absence in beating Guingamp 4-2 to secure their ticket to the French Cup last 16 on Wednesday as Edinson Cavani was made to wait for his club-record goal.,"Adrien Rabiot opened the scoring in the 21st minute followed smartly by Lucas Deaux's own goal, with Javier Pastore and Marquinhos completing the round of 32 win after the break. Marcus Thuram and Yeni Ngbakoto were on the mark in either half for Guingamp from the penalty spot. Despite PSG's dominance Cavani failed to get on the scoresheet as he pursues a record 157th goal, but it wasn't for the want of trying as he failed to convert a hatful of chances. The Uruguayan striker is on the verge of becoming PSG's all-time scorer after drawing level with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's benchmark in the 8-0 rout of Dijon last week. Neymar left the pitch after that Ligue 1 outing angered at booing directed at him from Parc des Princes fans when he stepped up to take a penalty rather than allowing Cavani a shot at the record. The world's most expensive player was missing from PSG's 2-1 loss at Lyon on Sunday and again for this Cup tie with according to the club ""a pain in his right thigh"". A section of the club's fans - 'Collectif Ultras Paris' (CUP) - conveyed a message of support to the Brazilian. ""To boo our players runs contrary to our values,"" ""Neymar PSG Cup united for Paris"", home supporters wrote on banners in the stands."

""I am extremely happy to finally be able to join my hometown club,"" said Diarra to the official PSG website. Diarra, who has won 34 caps for France, was released by United Arab Emirates club Al Jazira at the end of December. ""His experience, both abroad and with the France team, will provide our staff with additional options as we enter an exciting second half of the season,"" PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said in a statement."
561,22/01/2018,21:50,Lucas 'gutted' by PSG snub,"Brazilian midfielder Lucas Moura has said he is ""gutted"" at being frozen out at Paris Saint-Germain, in an interview published by L'Equipe on Monday.","Lucas had been a highly-rated target for Manchester United when he opted to join PSG from Sao Paulo in 2013 but he has fallen down the pecking order in the French capital since the arrival of countryman Neymar at the start of the season. ""It's a brutal blow. I'm gutted that I'm no longer playing, to no longer be able to express myself as I was doing before,"" Lucas told the online version of the French sports newspaper. ""I'm not happy. I thought I'd built something solid with this club, but that's clearly not the case."" The 25-year-old said he does not know what the future holds but has one eye on Spain's La Liga. ""With my speed and technique, I could perform well there,"" he added. ""But it doesn't matter where I end up, I know what I'm capable of. I didn't become an international by chance."" Lucas has played 34 times for his country but following the world record acquisition of Neymar and the loan signing of teenage French starlet Kylian Mbappe, PSG have to sell to balance the books or else fall foul of UEFA's financial fair play rules. Together, those two transfers will cost PSG more than 400 million euros ($490 million) once they complete Mbappe's permanent deal from Monaco at the end of this season. They will hope to recuperate a chunk of that from the sale of a player they bought for around 45 million euros and who helped them win four straight Ligue 1 titles."
562,22/01/2018,18:59,Ballsy Dani Alves dismisses red card criticism,"Paris Saint-Germain full-back Dani Alves insisted on Monday he has the broad shoulders and ""well-placed"" balls to live with criticism over his dismissal against Lyon on Sunday.","Alves was sent off for dissent just before the hour mark of PSG's 2-1 defeat in Lyon after a furious reaction to a free-kick decision that went against him. The score was 1-1 at the time but former Manchester United winger Memphis Depay blasted home an injury time scorcher to consign the French Ligue 1 leaders to only their second defeat of the season. But the veteran Brazil international was anything but contrite in an Instagram post accusing referee Clement Turpin of ""hiding"" from a mistake by sending him off. ""Since when is disagreement a lack of respect?"" said Alves. ""If people want to blame me, they can, they're free to do so. ""I have wide enough shoulders and a well-placed pair that always keep me on my feet!""

The newspaper later reported that he had passed his medical. Earlier, sports daily L'Equipe was one of several media outlets to report that the former Real Madrid player was set to sign a 18-month deal to join PSG. The Ligue 1 leaders are looking for an extra option in an area of the park where the ageing and injury-prone Thiago Motta needs back-up. Diarra, who was born and raised in eastern Paris, last played in France for PSG's great rivals Marseille but left in February last year. The former Arsenal, Chelsea and Portsmouth midfielder, who has won 34 caps, was most recently playing in the United Arab Emirates for Al Jazira."
564,19/01/2018,19:17,Aulas provokes PSG into 'fake news' accusation,"Paris Saint-Germain accused Lyon chairman Jean-Michel Aulas of peddling ""fake news"" on Friday, after he attacked the Ligue 1 leaders over their big transfer spending.","Aulas had denounced ""the dangerous inflation PSG creates in France"", and the capital club hit back on Twitter. PSG responded with an angry tweet that suggested Lyon were just trying to cash in and draw a big crowd when the visitors' big-name stars such as Neymar and Kylian Mbappe come to town. ""After today's fake news from Jean-Michel Aulas as a Lyon-PSG teaser, a question: are you trying to break records for attendance and gate receipts by hosting PSG?"" asked the tweet. Aulas took over at Lyon in 1987 and steered the club to seven consecutive league titles between 2002 and 2008. Since being bought by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011, PSG have won four league titles and are running away with Ligue 1 again this season, 11 points ahead of second-placed Lyon. Aulas has previous form in provoking PSG, especially before the clubs play. Ahead of the first meeting this season, a hard-won home victory for PSG, Aulas said there was ""no chance for second level clubs to compete on the field with PSG"". Paris midfielder Adrien Rabiot said at the time that he did ""not know if it is in order to destabilise us but it is not the first time, and it is often before PSG-Lyon"". ""PSG want to win the Champions League for geopolitical reasons,"" Aulas told French newspaper Le Parisien. ""The inflation generated in France by PSG is artificial inflation because the funds come from a state. PSG are trying to catch up and overtake the most powerful clubs, but they are clubs who generate their own resources."" Aulas also suggested that world-record signing Neymar isn't being paid 100 percent by PSG and questioned whether some of his salary comes directly from Qatar."
565,18/01/2018,16:36,Neymar cost Barcelona over 200 mln euros,"FC Barcelona shelled out more than 200 million euros ($245 million) for Neymar including his salary and the ""countless hidden clauses of the transfer,"" Spain's El Mundo daily said Thursday.","If confirmed, this would be greatly superior to the 57.1 million euros the club said it paid for his 2013 transfer, or even the 83.3 million euros later estimated by Spanish authorities probing irregularities in the move. The 25-year-old and his parents have been ordered to stand trial over the transfer, as have Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu and his predecessor Sandro Rosell. El Mundo based its information on documents handed over to Spanish prosecutors by Brazilian authorities, which are also probing the football star for tax evasion. A judicial source, who refused to be named, confirmed to AFP that prosecutors had indeed received those documents. But the source wasn't able to give any concrete figures, adding prosecutors received the documents in August last year. The Spanish judge in charge of the case has still not set a date for the trial and has to decide whether he can accept the latest information as evidence, as it arrived after the probe was closed, the sources say. According to El Mundo, the documents were given to Brazilian authorities by ""the former right-hand man of the footballer's father, Eduardo Musa."" The daily says the deal between Barcelona and Neymar's entourage was divided into two parts. On the one hand was ""the footballer's salary, which went up to 71 million euros before tax in five years,"" and on the other hand ""many fictitious contracts... that reach 134 million."" Among these contracts, El Mundo includes an agreement to play friendly matches with Santos, Neymar's former club, which never took place. The case against Neymar initiated with a complaint from Brazilian investment company DIS, which owned 40 percent of Neymar's sporting rights at the time of his transfer. DIS received just 6.8 million euros -- 40 percent of the 17 million euros fee paid to Santos -- with the company claiming it was cheated out of its real share because part of the transfer fee was concealed by Barcelona, Santos and the Neymar family. Spanish prosecutors have recommended that Neymar be handed a two-year jail sentence and fined 10 million euros. Sentences of two years or less are habitually suspended for first time offenders in Spain."
566,17/01/2018,23:46,Neymar scores four as Cavani matches Zlatan record,Neymar scored four times while Edinson Cavani equalled Zlatan Ibrahimovic's Paris Saint-Germain all-time goalscoring record as the runaway Ligue 1 leaders thrashed Dijon 8-0 on Wednesday.,"Angel Di Maria struck twice inside the opening quarter-hour at the Parc des Princes before the Argentine provided the cross for Cavani to net his 156th PSG goal. Neymar marked his return from a rib injury with the hosts' fourth just before half-time, and the Brazilian made it a hat-trick with two more second-half strikes as Dijon were mercilessly ripped apart. Kylian Mbappe piled on further misery for the visitors 13 minutes from time before Neymar notched his fourth of the evening from the penalty spot -- denying Cavani the chance to make club history. Argentine Di Maria, who grabbed the winner in Sunday's 1-0 victory at Nantes, needed just four minutes in Paris to put Unai Emery's team ahead with a stunning left-footed strike into the top corner. The former Real Madrid and Manchester United winger added a second when he applied the final touch after Neymar lifted the ball over Dijon goalkeeper Baptiste Reynet following a ball through from Cavani. The Uruguayan then netted his league-best 20th goal of the season by heading a right-wing cross from Di Maria, pulling level with the record Ibrahimovic set across four seasons in the French capital. Neymar made it 4-0 on 42 minutes with a sublime free-kick, with the world's most expensive player pouncing on a miscued clearance to double his tally just before the hour. He then struck a sensational third goal of the night with a run that beat several Dijon defenders and culminated in a crisp low drive from the edge of the area. Neymar released Mbappe as the teenager scored within five minutes of replacing Di Maria, while the Brazilian rounded out a record home win for PSG from the spot after Cavani tumbled to the ground. PSG have yet to drop a point at home this season and lead Lyon by 11 points, with a trip to face Bruno Genesio's men next up for the league leaders at the weekend. Nabil Fekir scored his 15th goal of the campaign as Lyon defeated Guingamp 2-0, with 19-year-old midfielder Houssem Aouar also on target at the Stade du Roudourou. ""Nabil's performance was extraordinary. He's been on a roll since the start of the season. He's at an international level and doing it consistently, which is a good sign for us,"" Genesio said. Claudio Ranieri's Nantes conceded a last-gasp penalty in a 1-1 draw at Toulouse, as Max-Alain Gradel salvaged a point for the hosts by cancelling out a first-half header from Slovenia international Rene Krhin."

Chapron then showed the player a second yellow card, although that has now been rescinded, the French league told AFP, freeing him to play in their next game. The referee apologised on Monday, saying Diego Carlos had bumped into him but that his own reaction had been ""clumsy"" and ""inappropriate"". The FFF said its technical committee of referees had decided that Chapron be ""withdrawn... until further notice"". He will be called to appear before the French league's disciplinary commission to explain himself. The sanction means he has been removed from refereeing duties for Wednesday's Ligue 1 game between Angers and Troyes. The FFF statement added that 45-year-old Chapron -- who recently took charge of a game in China -- had reviewed video footage of the incident and ""noted that his fall had been caused accidentally."" Chapron apologised, saying in a statement to AFP on Monday: ""The Nantes player, Diego Carlos, crashed into me. ""At the time of the collision, I felt a sharp pain where I had recently suffered an injury. My unfortunate reaction was to stick my leg out towards the player."" Footage of the incident quickly went viral across the world. Chapron and Diego Carlos were racing to catch up with a breakaway by PSG's Kylian Mbappe as the game, which the visitors won 1-0, moved into stoppage time at the Stade de la Beaujoire. The referee appeared to cut across the Brazilian defender and contact was made, sending both to the floor. As he got up, Chapron kicked the player, catching him on his right foot. He then started to walk away before turning around and brandishing a second yellow card. He also awarded PSG a free-kick. Nantes said they had asked the disciplinary commission of the league (LFP) to meet as a matter of urgency on Monday to rescind the second yellow card and allow Diego Carlos to play in Wednesday's game against Toulouse. ""After reading Tony Chapron's report confirming...that Diego Carlos had not knocked him over deliberately, the commission has decided to withdraw the second yellow card,"" the LFP confirmed to AFP. Nantes president Waldemar Kita, who was seen laughing incredulously after the red card was shown, said he spoke to Chapron at the end of the game. ""He told me that he had never wanted to kick the player and that he had felt himself pushed in the back,"" he told French television. ""It's a joke. I got 20 text messages from across the world telling me this referee is a joke."" Nantes midfielder Valentin Rongier had a good view of the incident and called for the referee to be given a lengthy ban. ""He says he slipped, but I know he kicked him,"" Rongier told Canal+. ""I know it's very difficult to referee but you have to question them from time to time... We do that, we get a 10-match ban."" Chapron has been refereeing in France's top flight since 2004 and has taken charge of more than 400 matches, including the French Cup final in 2014. Earlier this season he was invited to referee in the Chinese Super League, officiating the game between Shanghai Shenhua and Tianjin Teda in October. He recently told a French local television channel that he would retire at the end of this season."

He went on to play a further year with AC Milan before ending his career at Corinthians. Neymar cost PSG a world record 222 million euros ($264 million) in August when he joined from Barcelona. Ronaldo added that he would like to see Manchester City's Gabriel Jesus installed up front for Brazil. ""The World Cup's coming and we need his goals,"" he said. ""It's been a long time that we've been looking for a number nine."""

Neymar was on target in both of those victories but the league's leading scorer Edinson Cavani was absent after returning late from his Christmas and New Year break back home in Uruguay. Argentine Javier Pastore was also overlooked for Wednesday's outing after returning late from his holiday with both players talked to about their tardiness by coach Unai Emery. PSG captain Thiago Silva raised doubts about Pastore's future at the club when he said: ""I believe Pastore told the club he wanted to leave but in the end they couldn't reach a deal."" Pastore for his part strongly denied in an interview with Yahoo Sports from Argentina at the weekend that he wanted out. ""I love Paris and I love PSG,"" said Pastore, whose arrival in 2011 opened the floodgates to a host of talent that followed him into the club. ""Believe me I'll always be loyal to this club."" With next month's heavyweight Champions League date with Real Madrid looming Emery's side visit Nantes enjoying a nine-point lead over defending Ligue 1 title-holders Monaco and Lyon. And given that Nantes haven't managed to better PSG in Ligue 1 since 2005, the Qatari-backed visitors are on target to add another three points to the 50 they have already banked. PSG are not playing until Sunday night which gives Monaco the opportunity to reduce that gap for 24 hours at least with victory at Montpellier on Saturday. Leonardo Jardim's team resume league duties also having secured their ticket to the League Cup last four as goals from Thomas Lemar and Adama Diakhaby lifted them to a 2-1 defeat of Cote d'Azur rivals Nice on Tuesday. But they look set to be without their captain, Radamel Falcao, who is recovering from a thigh injury. ""You have to be careful with a thigh because this sort of injury can quickly lead to six weeks off,"" cautioned Jardim who may also be without Guido Carrillo. Multiple former champions Lyon host second from bottom Angers. Under performing Bordeaux meanwhile approach their trip to Troyes boosted by an unusual show of support. Jocelyn Gourvennec's side, precariously placed one point above the relegation zone, trained on Friday watched by the club's workforce who left their desks to give the team a much needed boost. Midfielder Jeremy Toulalan said: ""It gave us pleasure because at the moment we aren't getting a great deal of support. ""I've been at quite a few clubs but this is the first time I've seen anything like that, it warms the heart."" Fixtures (all times GMT)"
572,11/01/2018,00:13,Neymar strikes as PSG reach League Cup semis,Neymar scored a second-half penalty as four-time defending champions Paris Saint-Germain toiled before overcoming 10-man Amiens 2-0 to reach the semi-finals of the French League Cup on Wednesday.,"PSG were again without leading scorer Edinson Cavani, who also missed Sunday's French Cup rout of Rennes after returning late from his Christmas and New Year break in Uruguay. Amiens' hopes of springing an upset were heavily undermined by the dismissal of goalkeeper Regis Gurtner on 34 minutes for a foul on Kylian Mbappe after charging out of his area. And Neymar eventually made the visitors' numerical advantage count by winning and converting a spot-kick eight minutes into the second half at the Stade de la Licorne. Mbappe, earlier denied by a fingertip save from Jean-Christophe Bouet, was then thwarted by a combination of the substitute keeper and the crossbar before firing another effort narrowly wide. Marquinhos also struck the woodwork after connecting with a cross from Giovani Lo Celso, but Adrien Rabiot wrapped up a remarkable 35th consecutive win in domestic cup ties for PSG with a glancing header from an Angel Di Maria corner on 78 minutes. The goal was given following consultation with the video assistant referee (VAR) -- being used for the rest of the competition as a test ahead of its expected arrival in Ligue 1 next season -- after goal-line technology failed to award it. ""Our team worked hard but we didn't shine like on Sunday, but we also didn't concede chances. It was easier to win because we played with an extra man,"" said PSG coach Unai Emery. PSG will travel to Rennes, who they thrashed 6-1 in the last 64 of the French Cup, in the semi-finals at the end of the month, with Monaco set to host Montpellier in the other last-four tie. ""All teams prefer to play at home. But we will make another trip to Rennes full of desire to reach the final and win the title,"" Emery added. Isaac Mbenza scored with four minutes left as Montpellier snatched a 1-0 win at Angers, while Adrien Hunou struck twice late on as Rennes defeated Toulouse 4-2. Monaco became the first side to reach the last four of the competition on Tuesday as goals from Thomas Lemar and Adama Diakhaby saw Leonardo Jardim's team overcome Cote d'Azur rivals Nice 2-1 at the Allianz Riviera."
573,07/01/2018,13:03,PSG want answers as Pastore and Cavani miss Cup tie,Crack marksman Edinson Cavani and gifted midfielder Javier Pastore will need to provide answers to their tardy returns from Latin America with both men absent from the Paris Saint-Germain squad to face Rennes in the French Cup Sunday.,"Sources close to the club say both men face heavy sanctions with Cavani returning two days late Friday and Pastore yet to return. Cavani said he'd wanted to spend the New Year with his family and had complications booking flights back, and as the club's key striker PSG will be happy he's at least back in Paris. Pastore told Yahoo sports from Argentina he had personal issues to settle, and adamantly insists the no show has nothing to do with a desire to quit PSG. ""I love Paris and I love PSG,"" said Pastore, who is said to enjoy the favour of the club's Qatari president Nasser al-Khelaifi. ""I have some personal issues to settle,"" said the Argentine international. ""I was the first one to believe in the project,"" he insisted in reference to his arrival for a fee of 40 million euros in 2011, which opened the floodgates to a host of talent that followed him into the club. ""Believe me I'll always be loyal to this club."" After playing a key role in his first four seasons Pastore played less over the past two seasons before e return to form under Basque coach Unai Emery this season. ""I speak to him a huge amount. When his head is right he's a massive player for us,"" Emery told AFP on Friday."
574,04/01/2018,15:14,PSG relishing prospect of Real Madrid showdown - Emery,Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery is confident his side can get the better of Real Madrid as he looked ahead to next month's heavyweight Champions League showdown in an interview with AFP.,"And Emery dismissed suggestions that defeat to the reigning champions would constitute a failure for a club that invested huge sums in Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Dani Alves in the hope of winning the Champions League. ""It is a chance for us to show that we are at the same level as them, that we can beat the best teams,"" the Spaniard said as his team prepares to return to action following the French winter break. PSG play their first game of 2018 on Sunday away to Rennes when they begin their defence of the French Cup. Their January schedule will be taken up by domestic action, but a nine-point lead over Monaco and Lyon at the top of Ligue 1 means they will perhaps already be starting to think about the first leg of their last-16 tie in Madrid on February 14. ""I always think positive,"" said Emery. ""We will prepare well to come into the tie strong and compete with Real. I think we can win."" PSG are driven by the memory of what happened at the same stage of the competition last season, when they lost 6-1 away to Barcelona to go out having won 4-0 at home in the first leg in the French capital. ""We can learn a lot of things from that tie,"" Emery said. ""I think after that tie, and after the extra step PSG have taken, we will see teams, UEFA, referees have more respect for us, and I think we are now better prepared."" The extent of PSG's spending under their Qatari owners has not made themselves popular with Europe's traditional elite. A combined outlay of around 400 million euros ($483 million) on Neymar and Mbappe alone -- the two most expensive transfer deals in history -- have led to questions as to how PSG can comply with UEFA's financial fair play rules. But Emery, the former Sevilla coach, said: ""When I was in Spain, there were two clubs with huge financial power, Real Madrid and Barcelona. Real bought the best players in the world, (Luis) Figo, (Zinedine) Zidane, Ronaldo. ""In Spain, nobody ever talked about where the money they spent was coming from. And for Spanish football it was very good. ""I am at PSG, in Paris which is one of the most visited cities in the world, with great culture. ""When the possibility arose for a financial power like that of Qatar to come in, and to have some of the best players in the world... I think the whole of France, French clubs are happy. ""It is normal that other teams are saying 'wow' because there is now greater competition. ""Outside the club there is a lot of talk about financial fair play. Here, the club is on the right road, within the rules of financial fair play."" Nevertheless, it seems certain that PSG will trim their wage bill during this month's transfer window in order to balance the books. The likes of Lucas Moura, Javier Pastore and former Newcastle striker Hatem Ben Arfa look likely to move on. However Emery insisted that Argentina midfielder Pastore had not asked for a move amid talk that he could return to Italy. He added: ""Certain players who play less can maybe be protagonists in another team because they are good players and they don't have the chance to play here, like Lucas Moura or Hatem Ben Arfa."""
575,04/01/2018,02:40,PSG lure in fans with escape games,"Paris Saint-Germain are making the idea that football is part of the entertainment industry central to their strategy as they strive to become a ""global brand"" and attract new fans.","In pursuit of the worldwide ambitions of their Qatari owners, PSG are not just recruiting global football stars such as Neymar, but are also multiplying partnerships outside sport and moving into music, fashion, cinema, e-Sport and even ""escape games"". In early December, club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi took his squad to pose for the cameras with Mickey and Minnie the day after PSG beat Lille, and just as the Most Valuable Player at the Super Bowl did for many years, they went to Disneyland to celebrate. Now, the club has turned its stadium Parc des Princes into a theme park, hosting an ""immersive"" escape game called ""Inside PSG"" on non-matchdays into at least April. The idea is not new. Lyon were the first French football club to organise this type of game at a sports venue, but PSG have gone beyond of the classic version of the game -- solving puzzles to escape a single room in an hour -- by offering ""a mission"" that visits parts of the Parc usually inaccessible to fans. Moving between the dressing rooms, players' tunnel and the VIP boxes, competitors have an hour and a half to interrogate some 15 actors playing roles including coach, security chief and official photographer and find a lost object needed for a match that kicks off in 90 minutes. ""Inside PSG"" is the latest effort in a series of marketing operations targeted at culture and entertainment. It comes after a partnership with the Rolling Stones, which allowed the club to sell PSG merchandise using the group's famous ""tongue and lip"" logo, a ""Justice League"" promo which paired Neymar with Batman and Kylian Mbappe with the Flash, the creation of a PSG e-Sports team and the appearance of a redesigned club shirt on the catwalk of street couture label Koche during Paris Fashion Week. ""The idea is to cover the areas that interest everyone,"" Fabien Allegre, PSG's director of marketing and brand development, told AFP. He said he hopes to use the game to attract families ""who don't know PSG but tomorrow could become fans of the club."" ""When you want to become a global brand you have to enlarge your scope and do anything that others either won't allow themselves to do because of their history or cannot do because they don't have the good luck to have Paris in their name or the Eiffel Tower in their logo,"" he said. ""They want to show that PSG is not just a sports club but also entertainment,"" said Pierre-Henri Londner, co-founder of Team Break, the company that created the PSG game. Is there a risk that this strategy of ""sportainment"" and the effort to ""recruit"" beyond the frontiers of football will offend traditional fans, notably PSG's infamous ultras? ""To do it without alienating existing fans it can't become pure entertainment, but that balance is extremely difficult to achieve,"" Frank Pons, director of the International Observatory of Sports Management at Laval University in Montreal, told AFP. Although the club no longer runs tours of the Parc, PSG has found a way to avoid relying simply on match days for revenue and ""make the stadium profitable 365 days a year"", said Pons. ""In accessing a new 'fan base', they are going to look for other types of income that they don't have at the moment,"" Pons said. Allegre says that the strategy is a logical response to the outlay on players Al-Khelaifi undertook in the summer and looked towards Barcelona, who attracted more than 1.7 million visitors to their stadium in 2015. ""We are lucky enough to have a president who has invested heavily this summer and we must also respond with revenue growth,"" he said. When you look at the queue for stadium tours at Barcelona, that's something important in the club's business-plan."" Allegre said he hopes to attract ""50,000 to 60,000"" customers ""in a first run of 60 dates"". With tickets costing 22 euros ($26.50) for children and 27 euros for adults, and 12 sessions a day, ""Inside PSG"" could generate more than one million euros of revenues. Will that give a little push to the club's finances as it races to present a budget in the spring that is in line with European football governing body UEFA's Financial Fair Play requirements? ""It can't hurt,"" says Allègre."
576,21/12/2017,19:24,Neymar wants 'history' with Real scalp,"Neymar believes Paris Saint-Germain can ""make history"" by eliminating holders and record 12-time winners Real Madrid when the two clubs meet in the last 16 of the Champions League.","French league leaders PSG were paired with Cristiano Ronaldo's Real in the tie of the round, and big-spending PSG are looking for a rapid return on their massive summer investment. ""We know it will be a difficult match against a team that has been playing together for years and also wants to win, but we can beat them,"" Neymar said on Thursday as PSG arrived in Doha for their winter training camp. ""We can make history. We're here to do just that, to play football, and we're going to do everything to win,"" added the Brazilian, who cost PSG a world record 222 million euros ($264 million) in August when he joined from Barcelona. PSG have never advanced beyond the quarter-finals of the Champions League since the club's takeover by its Qatari owners in 2011, throwing away a 4-0 first leg lead to spectacularly crash out in the last 16 to Barcelona last season after four straight quarter-final exits. They will travel to Madrid for the first leg on February, with the return meeting at the Parc des Princes on March 6. Neymar, who was voted third in this year's Ballon d'Or, also admitted it would be ""difficult"" for him to win next year's award -- a prize that has changed hands between Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for the past decade. ""That doesn't depend just on me, but also on my team-mates and what we win this season. It's obvious that the World Cup will be very important ... but we'll have to do things well as a team first and then think about individual stuff,"" the Brazilian said. Neymar has scored 17 goals in 20 matches since his arrival in Paris, but Kylian Mbappe believes the team's attack will become even more potent as the season progresses. ""We have a great attack and I think we can do even better,"" said Mbappe, who turned 19 on Wednesday. ""We've only been together for five months and we've already been able to develop in certain ways, but in a year it can be even better. ""We know each other very well but there are still some of those automatic reflexes missing to really know one another by heart. ""I think we can get there quickly to do some really great things for PSG. We have lots of talent but to win titles you need a real team, and I think we're capable of doing it."""
577,19/12/2017,01:50,Silva targets return as PSG mull winter moves,Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery is hopeful captain Thiago Silva will return from injury for Wednesday's final match of the year at home to Caen before the French league heads into its winter break.,"The Brazil international hasn't featured since hobbling off during a 3-1 defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League a fortnight ago, but has resumed full training and could replace the suspended Presnel Kimpembe in central defence. ""I believe and hope, like Thiago Silva and the doctor, that he will be okay to play,"" Emery said on Monday, as PSG look to remain unbeaten at the Parc des Princes under the Spaniard. After Wednesday's fixture, the runaway Ligue 1 leaders will then have 18 days until their next match -- against Rennes in the last 64 of the French Cup on January 7. But with PSG looking to balance their books following the August arrivals of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, January could prove a busy month for the club in the transfer market. Emery has already spoken with Lucas Moura and Hatem Ben Arfa about possible exits, while Argentine pair Javier Pastore and Angel Di Maria continue to be regularly linked with moves away from Paris. PSG have mooted recruiting a holding midfielder to replace the oft-injured Thiago Motta, but sporting director Antero Henrique has ruled out any further acquisitions for the time being. ""Right now, we have no need to dip into the winter transfer market. An opportunity may always arrive but at the moment the answer is no,"" Henrique told Le Parisien newspaper. Caen are without a win in four matches ahead of the trip to PSG -- their total of 11 goals scored is the second worst tally in France, although only PSG and Montpellier have a better defensive record this term. Neymar excelled on his return, after missing games against Lille and Strasbourg, with two goals and two assists in Saturday's 4-1 win over Rennes, but PSG will also be without Marco Verratti and Dani Alves as both serve one-match bans. Second-place Monaco, who trail PSG by nine points, go in search of a fourth straight win against Rennes at the Stade Louis II, where coach Leonardo Jardim is enjoying rebuilding last year's title-winning side. ""I'm passionate about this project, it's sort of my project,"" said Jardim. ""It's my fourth season here. I'm passionate but realistic. I believe we can succeed with this project. ""Other challenges were offered to me but I didn't leave because I'm driven by this project. I'm happy to work here. I'm going to continue, even if we don't know what the future holds. ""There are two years left on my contract and I'm making the most day after day of the club and Monaco."" Lyon are level on points with Monaco after Sunday's 2-0 victory over Marseille and will bid to keep pace with the defending champions when they travel to Toulouse. Marseille will look to regroup at home to Troyes after a howler by Steve Mandanda contributed to Rudi Garcia's team's 12-match unbeaten run coming to an end. Mario Balotelli has scored eight goals in his last eight games in all competitions to help Nice recover from a dreadful start, but the Italian will be absent against Lille due to suspension."
578,18/12/2017,16:00,PSG want new midfield general,"Big-spending Paris Saint-Germain might sign a holding midfielder during the winter transfer window as they pursue their dream of winning the Champions League, coach Unai Emery suggested Monday.","Qatar-backed PSG sent shockwaves through world football by luring Brazilian superstar Neymar from Barcelona for 222 million euros ($261 million) and setting up a record 180 million euros deal for teenage sensation Kylian Mbappe. But the impressive riches of their forward line are not yet reflected in their midfield. ""Thiago Motta is a sentry for us and when he's out we don't really have a replacement,"" Emery told a press conference on Monday. His side have a are runaway leaders in France's Ligue 1, but face Cristiano Ronaldo-led Real Madrid in a keenly-awaited Champions League last-16 double header in February. Motta won the Champions League in 2006 with Barcelona and again in 2010 with Inter Milan and has been at PSG since 2012. ""Having a replacement for him if he's out would be the key area to strengthen,"" said Emery. To balance the books it is thought PSG are likely to sell over the winter break with Brazil's Lucas Moura and French midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa thought to be surplus to Emery's requirements. Meanwhile the Argentines Javier Pastore and Angel Di Maria are also believed to be potential departees."

French league leaders PSG play Rennes on Saturday afternoon. ""He's sorted out his problem,"" Emery told a press conference at PSG's training ground. ""He was here yesterday (Thursday) and trained well and for the match you would expect him to be ready to play."" Asked if Neymar's numerous trips brought potential fitness risks, Emery said he did not think so. ""He is accustomed to making lots of trips, with the national team as well. He travels a lot and long distances."" ""I think he is in good shape and maintaining his fitness and yesterday in training he worked normally,"" Emery said. Emery said that two injured players, Thiago Silva and Thiago Motta, might make their returns to the squad this weekend."

""For me Mbappe is the revelation of football,"" Maradona, the star of Argentina's 1986 World Cup triumph, said in an interview with Spanish daily As. ""He seems to me that he can be better than lots of players."" It has been a remarkable 2017 for Mbappe. He helped fire Monaco to a first French league title in 17 years and reached the Champions League semi-finals, before joining PSG in a stunning deal worth 180 million euros ($209 million). Maradona named the Frenchman as part of a list of players he believes are worthy of challenging Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi's perpetual claim to the Ballon d'Or -- an award both have won five times each since 2008. ""Giving it to Cristiano and giving it to Messi has become boring,"" said Maradona. ""There needs to be others getting involved in the fight, like Cavani, Mbappe, (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic. I don't know, there just needs to be some others."" Maradona also recalled advising Real Madrid president Florentino Perez to sign Mbappe prior to him moving to PSG. ""I said that to Florentino, sign Mbappe. I told him that! It was when we saw each other at FIFA,"" Maradona recounted. ""He told me, 'But you know I have Cristiano already.'"" Mbappe had reportedly been a target of Real, but the European champions were ultimately beaten to his signature by PSG."

Emery himself got back from Strasbourg in the early hours of Thursday. Signed Neymar shirts and a Rolex watch were among the items stolen with the family telling the police goods worth around 20,000 euros in total were taken. ""The door was closed but not locked,"" the police said. ""The door was lifted off its hinges and the thieves took luxury handbags, jewellery, football shirts and designer clothes,"" the police confirmed.

PSG will take on Amiens in the last eight, after the newly-promoted top-flight club edged out second-tier Tours 2-1. ""We needed to improve from the league game and the team was more focused from the start,"" said PSG coach Unai Emery. ""Maybe we could have scored more goals and played better after it went to 4-2, but we are still happy."" With Neymar having only just returned from a visit to his native Brazil, Emery opted to play Edinson Cavani up front on his own with Kylian Mbappe on the bench. Home hopes of a repeat performance for Strasbourg were dashed in only the 12th minute, as Yoann Salmier sliced Angel Di Maria's cross into his own net. Argentina international Di Maria made it two midway through the first half, capitalising on a goalkeeping error by Alexandre Oukidja to slot in his fourth goal of the season. But Strasbourg pulled one back before half-time against the run of play as midfielder Jeremy Grimm, who has been with the club throughout their rise from the third tier, slotted into the corner. The hosts battled hard in the second period but their resistance was finally ended when Thomas Meunier crossed for fellow full-back Dani Alves to tap in from close range. German international Julian Draxler impressed in a three-man attacking midfield alongside Di Maria and Javier Pastore, and drilled in to end a nine-game goal drought for club and country. Jeremy Blayac came off the bench to score a late consolation for Strasbourg, but PSG had long since secured their place in the quarters. Elsewhere, a much-changed Lyon were stunned 4-1 at Montpellier despite taking a 10th-minute lead through teenager Myziane Maolida, as Souleymane Camara scored twice for the hosts. Nice goalkeeper Yoan Cardinale was the hero as Lucien Favre's men edged past managerless Lille on penalties after Mario Balotelli had rescued the a 1-1 draw for the visitors. Monaco will be Nice's last-eight opponents, after the principality outfit saw off Caen on Tuesday. Rennes beat Marseille in a penalty shootout after an entertaining 2-2 draw at Roazhon Park, where Kostas Mitroglou and Valere Germain scored for the visitors, but to no avail.

I hope he will come back in three or four days' time,"" Emery said. The coach said Neymar approached him as the PSG squad was preparing for Saturday's Ligue 1 match against Lille. ""He told me he had a family matter and that if the club and I gave him the chance to go to Brazil to take care of this problem, it was important to him. ""The person comes first, the player comes second,"" Emery said. Neymar, the world's most expensive player following his 222 million euros ($261.5 million) move from Barcelona this year, went to Brazil on Saturday ""for personal matters"", a source from his management company NN Consultaria told AFP. French radio station RMC Sport reported that the 25-year-old flew home after receiving ""bad news involving his family"". Neymar tweeted on Monday but gave no reasons for his trip to Brazil. He was suspended for the 3-1 victory over Lille and he looks likely to miss Wednesday's League Cup match against Strasbourg, the team that inflicted PSG's only league defeat of the season. Emery refused to be drawn on whether Neymar would be considered for selection for the Ligue 1 match against Rennes on Saturday. ""We're going to wait and see if he is ready to come,"" the Spaniard said. ""First of all he has to be at peace with his problem."" The French league begins a three-week winter break on December 20.

Real, the two-time defending European champions and 12-time winners overall, came second behind Tottenham Hotspur in their group and will host PSG in the Spanish capital in the first leg on February 14. ""I don't think it's the worst draw possible. I think we are of a level where we can play against Real Madrid,"" said Emery. ""If you want to do something big in the Champions League you have to play against the best sides. ""I think these matches will be the centre of the footballing world when they come around."" Bayern were rewarded for finishing behind PSG with a tie against Besiktas, the Turkish champions, while the French club will once again have to overcome one of the Spanish giants. Last season Paris faced Barcelona in the last 16 and were eliminated in extraordinary fashion, winning 4-0 at home in the first leg only to lose 6-1 in the return at the Camp Nou. In that match, Barcelona needed to score three times from the 88th minute onwards and did so. But since then PSG have strengthened, signing Neymar for a world record 222 million euros ($264 million) from Barca and beating Madrid to the signature of Kylian Mbappe from Monaco. The tie will be the first meeting of the sides since the 2015-16 group stage, when Madrid won 1-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu after a 0-0 draw in Paris. ""I have lots of friends in Madrid, I know Real Madrid well too, having watched a lot of their matches. I know what the atmosphere is like there,"" said Spaniard Emery. ""It is a wonderful opportunity for us. I am sure the team will be in perfect shape when the tie comes around."" Meanwhile, Emery admitted that he has allowed Neymar to return to his native Brazil to deal with a family matter. The 25-year-old was suspended for Saturday's 3-1 win over Lille in Ligue 1 anyway, and now looks likely to miss Wednesday's League Cup tie at Strasbourg, where Paris lost 2-1 only 10 days ago. ""Neymar called me on Saturday. He said to me he had a family issue and wanted to know if the club and I would allow him to go to Brazil to deal with the problem,"" said Emery. ""The person comes first, then the footballer. We gave him permission to make the trip. I hope he'll be back in three or four days, but I don't know if he'll be back for Wednesday's match."""
586,11/12/2017,13:49,Ronaldo v Neymar as Real draw PSG in Champions League,Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid will resume their bid for a first European Cup treble in 42 years against Neymar's Paris Saint-Germain after the big-spending duo were on Monday drawn together in a mouth-watering Champions League last 16 clash.,"No club has won the European title three years running since Bayern Munich in the mid-1970s, underlining how big an achievement it would be if Madrid -- 12 times winners overall -- won the trophy again in the final in Kiev in May. Challenging them for the title will be a record five English clubs through to the last 16, with Chelsea facing the most challenging hurdle in the shape of La Liga giants Barcelona. Barca's Spanish rivals Real know exactly what it takes to be European champions, and in Ronaldo have the most prolific goal-scorer in the competition's history. Emilio Butragueno, a Real director and former striker, regretted that one of the favourites would be eliminated so soon in the competition. ""For the potential of the two teams, luck has worked out this way and one of the two teams will be out at the last 16 stage, which we think is a bit soon taking into account they are two of the contenders for the title,"" Butragueno told BeIN Sports Spain. PSG made waves in the transfer market in the close season when they signed Brazilian star Neymar for a world-record 222 million euros ($261.5 million), followed closely by great French hope Kylian Mbappe, who will cost 180m euros when his loan deal becomes permanent next summer. ""Every summer they have signed great players, they get stronger all the time and they have had a nearly impeccable group stage,"" acknowledged Butragueno. ""With Neymar and Mbappe they have improved a lot up front, they are a very dangerous team who will demand the best of us. We need to face both games like finals and for the fans it will be a thrilling tie."" PSG ambassador Maxwell said the Real tie threw up the chance for the Parisian club to atone for their 6-1 hammering by Barcelona that eliminated them in the last 16 last season. ""It's a good draw, with two good games to play,"" Maxwell said. ""Our fans will like it after we were knocked out by Barcelona last season. ""It will be nice. It's a beautiful challenge for the club. I think we're ready for that."" Barcelona will be wary of Chelsea, the English club enjoying four wins to three in their 12 previous Champions League meetings, their most recent coming in the semi-finals in 2012 as the London side marched to the title. ""It is a good tie, the factor of playing the first leg away can always help you a little,"" said Barca director Guillermo Amor. ""We are very optimistic, we are confident and want to keep going in this competition. ""We will see who arrives better for the dates of the game. We hope we will be strong because we are facing a strong team, an English team that runs and is very physical but also has very good players."" English Premier League leaders Manchester City play Basel, who have had some fine results against English sides in recent years, while five-time winners and current Bundesliga table toppers Bayern Munich drew Turkish giants Besiktas. Bayern's director of sport Hasan Salihamidzic said the Germans would not be underestimating Besiktas, who should enjoy some raucous support from the city's Turkish community. ""We know how strong they are after we followed their games against Leipzig. It will be a difficult task, but we are looking forward to the unusual atmosphere in their stadium,"" he said. ""One always says that it is a disadvantage to play at home in the first-leg, which is right -- it certainly won't be an advantage - but we are strong enough to accept that and we will give our all."" England's three-time champions Manchester United face Sevilla, Liverpool, five-time winners, will be up against two-time former champions Porto, and Tottenham take on last year's beaten finalists Juventus. Juve vice-president Pavel Nedved dubbed Spurs a ""very solid team"". ""Juventus have been there (finals) twice in the last three years, it's something that definitely does not happen to everyone, for now we think of Tottenham and nothing else."" Unfancied Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk will play Roma to round out the eight ties, with first legs set for February 13/14 and 20/21 and second legs March 6/7 and 13/14."
587,09/12/2017,20:52,PSG sink managerless Lille to halt slide,Runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain shook off the absence of the suspended Neymar on Saturday to end their recent wobble with a 3-1 win over managerless Lille in Ligue 1.,"Angel Di Maria nodded in a cross from Kylian Mbappe on 28 minutes at a chilly Parc des Princes, with Javier Pastore powering in a second just after half-time. Anwar El Ghazi gave Lille, who suspended manager Marcelo Bielsa last month and replaced him with a team of four interim coaches, a glimmer of hope by pulling a goal back four minutes from time. But with goalkeeper Mike Maignan up for a last-gasp corner, Mbappe burst free of the Lille backline after the ball was cleared upfield to dribble in a third as PSG ended a run of back-to-back defeats. ""We needed this win after the last two defeats to get our rhythm back and regain confidence,"" PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe told Canal Plus. ""We've done that today and we're very pleased. ""Criticism in football is normal. Everyone is used to these kinds of things and it drew a reaction from us."" The win provisionally moved Unai Emery's team 12 points clear of Lyon, Monaco and Marseille at the top and ensured PSG will head into the new year in first place in France. ""There's still a long way to go, and the most important thing will be after 38 matches,"" added Kimpembe. ""I'm happy with the display,"" said Emery, who remains unbeaten at home since taking over as PSG coach in June of last year. ""We controlled the match better than in our last two league games, against Troyes and Strasbourg."" Defeat snapped a two-match winning run for Lille and left them just two points clear of the relegation zone ahead of Saturday's later games. France paid a ""national homage"" to late rock star Johnny Hallyday, known as the French Elvis, on Saturday with a procession down the Champs Elysees. The French league is also honouring Hallyday, who died aged 74 on Wednesday after a battle with lung cancer, at grounds around the country this weekend, with some of his most famous songs played before kick-off in Paris. PSG were looking to end their worst week of the season, after a 2-1 defeat at Strasbourg last weekend was followed by a 3-1 reverse away to Bayern Munich in the Champions League. It was the first time in three years that PSG had lost successive games, but the capital club set about righting the ship as Di Maria headed in an Mbappe cross -- the flag staying down despite the Frenchman straying marginally offside. PSG lost midfielder Adrien Rabiot to an apparent hamstring injury at the break, but Pastore doubled the hosts' advantage by blasting past Maignan after Marco Verratti robbed Ibrahim Amadou of possession deep in Lille territory. Mbappe nearly added a third when his low strike was awkwardly tipped onto the post by Maignan, but Lille received a lifeline when Giovani Lo Celso's sliding challenge inadvertently set up substitute El Ghazi. Edinson Cavani was denied a league-leading 18th goal of the campaign as Maignan plunged down low to his right to superbly deny the Uruguayan, but the Lille keeper was nowhere to be seen when Mbappe sealed victory in the closing seconds."

590,06/12/2017,16:37,Bayern serve Euro rivals reminder of potency,Bayern Munich delivered a stark warning to their Champions League rivals for the knockout stages as their resounding win over Paris Saint-Germain underlined their return to form.,"Bayern finished second in Group B behind PSG on head-to-head goal difference, despite their comprehensive 3-1 win on Tuesday night, as both clubs progressed with 15 points. However, the Germans were a different side to the one humbled 3-0 in Paris at the end of the September. Frenchman Corentin Tolisso scored twice after Robert Lewandowski opened the scoring while Kylian Mbappe netted a consolation goal for PSG at the Allianz Arena. ""We are still FC Bayern,"" boomed Thomas Mueller, sending a timely reminder to potential last-16 opponents of the threat posed by the five-time European champions. Bayern fell short of securing the four-goal winning margin needed to finish top of their group but proved they deserve to be regarded among the favourites for the title. ""That was a good signal to our rivals,"" insisted midfielder Sebastian Rudy. Veteran head coach Jupp Heynckes has turned the team around in the last two months since Carlo Ancelotti was sacked the day after the defeat in Paris. ""Bayern are among the absolute top teams, you can tell that a lot has happened,"" said PSG's Germany midfielder Julian Draxler, reflecting on the impact Heynckes has had since returning for a fourth spell in charge. The 72-year-old coached Bayern to the 2013 treble and has managed the delicate balancing act of dividing up game time fairly among his star-studded squad. Frenchmen Tolisso and Kingsley Coman both seized their chances with eye-catching displays as Bayern proved they will be a force in the knockout phase. Bayern made their point against big-spending PSG, whose Brazil star Neymar -- the world's most expensive player -- had a quiet night in Munich. PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi described Bayern's performance as a ""lesson for everyone"". Bayern were five points behind Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga when Heynckes took over in early October, but the Bavarian giants now hold a six-point lead. ""We've confirmed that we have ambitions, the team is getting better and better,"" said Heynckes. As well as instilling discipline and returning harmony to the dressing room, where there was in-fighting under Ancelotti, he has coaxed top performances from key stars. Mueller, Jerome Boateng, Javi Martinez and Arturo Vidal were left out of the starting side, as Heynckes rotated, giving James Rodriguez, Tolisso and Coman the chance to shine against PSG. It was something Ancelotti never really got right in his 15 months at the helm. ""I have 20 professional players and almost all of them are internationals, I have to make use of the whole squad,"" said Heynckes. ""Changes like that are obvious to me."" Nevertheless, frustrations boiled over at the Allianz Arena as Bayern fell short of usurping PSG as group winners. Defender Mats Hummels stormed off at the final whistle, exchanging words with Mueller, and left the stadium without speaking to waiting reporters. ""Mats is very ambitious, the way we know him, he wanted to win by more,"" explained Heynckes. ""He is playing exceptionally well and he wanted the fourth or fifth goal."" Bayern go into the runners-up pot for the draw at 1100 GMT on Monday. It means they could well draw the likes of Barcelona, Manchester United or Premier League pace-setters Manchester City, led by former Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, in the last 16. Several of the current Bayern squad won the title in 2013 and have the experience of reaching at least the semi-finals five years in a row between 2012 and 2016. ""We're there and you can count on us not being an easy opponent,"" warned director of sport Hasan Salihamidzic."

Around 30 PSG fans were questioned by Munich police, while three Bayern fans were found to be carrying weapons and were arrested on assault charges. Around 4,000 PSG fans are expected at the match which was already flagged up by authorities as at risk of violence. Both clubs are through to the last 16 and will meet at Munich's Allianz Arena with Bayern needing to win at least 4-0 in order to finish as group winners after losing 3-0 in Paris last September."
592,04/12/2017,13:08,Suarez cannot see Neymar joining Real Madrid,"Barcelona striker Luis Suarez insisted he cannot envisage former teammate Neymar moving to rivals Real Madrid due to his ""admiration"" for Barca.","Neymar spent four years at the Camp Nou before sensationally moving to Paris Saint-German in August for a world record 222 million euro ($264 million) fee. However, rumours of a move back to Spain with the European champions surfaced after Neymar clashed with new strike partner and Suarez's international teammate Edison Cavani back in September. ""No, not at all,"" Suarez told Spanish sports daily Marca on Monday when asked about the prospect of Neymar moving to Madrid. ""Sincerely, I don't see it. I know how Neymar is and the admiration that he had for Barcelona and his teammates. I don't see him now going to play for Real Madrid."" Along with five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi, Suarez and Neymar formed one of the deadliest strike forces of all-time as they won two La Liga titles and a Champions League in three seasons together. However, despite a bitter fallout between the club and Neymar after PSG paid the Brazilian's buyout clause, Suarez insists he has only admiration and love for his former colleague. ""Ney is now mature enough and was completely aware of the decision he took,"" added Suarez. ""I am sure it was painful because he was happy here, but we all have to accept that he had other challenges he wanted to take on. ""It was an understandable decision that he took with his family. There is no reproach, only admiration and pure love for what he gave this club and the relationship we had during those years."" And Suarez said he had no role in calming tensions between Cavani and Neymar. ""No, I was an outsider. They weren't situations that I could control."""
593,02/12/2017,22:14,Emery shrugs off shock PSG loss,Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery shrugged off concerns about next week's Champions League clash with Bayern Munich after his side fell to their first Ligue 1 defeat of the season at lowly Strasbourg on Saturday.,"Neymar's PSG travel to Munich knowing that they will top Group B as long as they don't lose 4-0 to Bayern, and asked by reporters if he was worried about his team ahead of the clash, Emery replied ""No"". ""Tuesday's match is a big test against a team that also wants to go far in the Champions League. We want to show that we want to have a good season,"" he said. PSG face having their lead at the top of Ligue 1 cut ahead of their trip to Germany, with Marseille and Lyon taking the field on Sunday looking to close the gap on the runaway leaders' after their shock slip in Alsace. But Emery insisted that his team deserved to win and wasn't worried about the display. ""We had plenty of opportunities to score and not lose the game (against Strasbourg), but we weren't clinical in front of goal,"" said Emery. ""We deserved to win so I'm not worried."" Stephane Bahoken downed PSG with a bullet finish in the 65th minute to drag the lowly home side away from relegation trouble and up to 14th. The exhausted Strasbourg players charged over to their gobsmacked fans at the final whistle of a breathless encounter which saw the hosts hold off a bombardment from their all-star guests that lasted right to the end of the nine minutes of stoppage time. ""To beat a team like that you need all the planets to align and you need to go above and beyond,"" said Strasbourg coach Thierry Laurey. ""They fought like lions out there. I am very proud of this team."" Striker Bahoken struck just as Emery's side looked primed to snatch the three points, with Kylian Mbappe cancelling out Nuno Da Costa's 13th-minute headed opener three minutes before the break and PSG piling on the pressure. But with the capital city club camped in Strasbourg's half and the rested Edinson Cavani readying himself to come on to push for the win, Bahoken raced onto Da Costa's flick-on and thumped his winner past Alphonse Areola. They kept the away side at bay in a frantic final flurry that saw the baying home fans bite their nails as they counted down the nine minutes of added time, and it was a mixture of dogged defending and outstanding keeping from substitute keeper Alexandre Oukidja that staved off the assault. The French Algerian, who replaced the injured Kamara in the Strasbourg goal, made an incredible reaction save from Cavani's last gasp header, tipping the ball over the bar just as the Uruguayan looked certain to snatch what would have been a heartbreaking point. ""We missed out tonight. We created chances but we weren't able to convert them. We conceded two silly goals, we lacked a bit of concentration,"" PSG defender Marquinhos told Canal+. ""We will learn from this. We have a very important match coming up and we need to think about that already."" Radamel Falcao closed in on Ligue 1 top scorer Cavani with his 14th goal of the season as Monaco took advantage of PSG's defeat with their first win in four games to move second, nine points behind the leaders. The Colombian's second-minute strike was enough for Leonardo Jardim's team to scrape past second-bottom Angiers 1-0 to close the gap ahead of third-placed Marseille's short trip to Montpellier on Sunday and Lyon, in fourth, travelling to Caen. Mario Balotelli was on target as Nice beat bottom club Metz 3-1 to move four points clear of the relegation zone."
594,02/12/2017,19:37,Neymar's PSG beaten by lowly Strasbourg,Newly-promoted Strasbourg stunned Neymar's Paris Saint-Germain 2-1 on Saturday to inflict the first defeat of the season on the runaway Ligue 1 leaders.,"The exhausted Strasbourg players charged over to their gobsmacked fans at the final whistle of a breathless encounter which saw the lowly hosts hold off a bombardment from their all-star guests that lasted right to the end of the nine minutes of stoppage time. Stephane Bahoken downed PSG, who travel to Bayern Munich on Tuesday, with a bullet finish in the 65th minute to drag the lowly home side away from relegation trouble and up to 14th. His goal also gave Marseille the chance to close the 10-point gap between Rudi Garcia's in-form side and PSG when they face Montpellier on Sunday. ""We missed out tonight. We created chances but we weren't able to convert them. We conceded two silly goals, we lacked a bit of concentration,"" PSG defender Marquinhos told Canal+. ""We will learn from this. We have a very important match coming up and we need to think about that already."" Striker Bahoken struck just as Unai Emery's side looked primed to snatch the three points, with Kylian Mbappe equalising Nuno Da Costa's 13th-minute headed opener three minutes before the break and PSG piling on the pressure. But with PSG camped in Strasbourg's half and the rested Edinson Cavani readying himself to come on to push for the win, Bahoken raced onto Da Costa's flick-on and thumped his winner past Alphonse Areola to consign PSG to their first defeat in all competitions since April. Dominant but wasteful PSG had two gilt-edged chances just before Mbappe eventually equalised, and both were fluffed by Angel Di Maria in the space of two minutes. First the Argentine sliced wide from a tight angle in the 39th minute after racing onto Neymar's precision through-ball, then he shot straight at Bingourou Kamara when fed neatly by his countryman Javier Pastore. Pastore thought he'd given PSG a deserved lead just before the break when he spun on Mbappe's cross and drilled a hard low shot that flashed past Kamara but crashed off the post and back into the beaten keeper's arms. PSG continued to press for the winner throughout the second half but Bahoken struck in a lightning breakaway attack, and Strasbourg shut up shop for the final 25 minutes. They kept the away side at bay in a frantic final flurry that saw substitute keeper Alexandre Oukidja save the points with seconds remaining, tipping away Cavani's header just as the Uruguayan looked certain to snatch what would have been a heartbreaking point."
595,01/12/2017,10:50,Faltering Monaco need to show backbone - Jardim,"Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim said his faltering French champions need players ""with character"" after slipping 12 points behind runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain.","The principality side made a strong start to the domestic season despite seeing their title-winning side decimated in the transfer window, with Benjamin Mendy, Bernardo Silva, Kylian Mbappe and Tiemoue Bakayoko all leaving the club. But back-to-back defeats by PSG and Nantes have left Monaco languishing in fourth place, while last season's Champions League semi-finalists were also dumped out of Europe with a 4-1 home loss to RB Leipzig last week. ""At this difficult moment, we need players with character, with experience,"" Jardim said Thursday ahead of Saturday's match against lowly Angers. ""They are important to bring us a little more desire and tranquility."" Without teenage sensation Mbappe, who left on loan to title rivals PSG ahead of a 180-million-euro ($214.3 million) move next year, Radamel Falcao has shouldered the goalscoring burden, while close-season signing Stevan Jovetic has struggled with form and fitness. Colombian Falcao has managed 13 goals in just 12 league games this term, but has not scored in his last two outings, and Jardim knows his other forwards have to step up. ""It's completely different when he plays with another striker,"" said the Portuguese coach. ""That gives more space to Falcao, as we did last season and at the beginning of this season. ""When he's alone, our midfielders like Rony Lopes (Rachid) Ghezzal and Joao (Moutinho) are not used to going into the area, dribbling and scoring. ""Even if they play well, it's more difficult for Falcao."" Monaco suffered another setback on Wednesday, with the news that Belgium international midfielder Youri Tielemans would need knee surgery. PSG's front line of Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Mbappe have looked unstoppable for much of this season, although the league leaders had to wait until the 73rd minute to break down a stubborn Troyes in midweek. But world-record signing Neymar and Cavani both scored late on, despite the Uruguayan's first-half penalty miss, to continue their unbeaten start to the campaign with a 2-0 win that pulled them 10 points clear of second-placed Marseille. The three are unlikely to start together for Saturday's game at newly-promoted Strasbourg, though, with coach Unai Emery set to ring the changes ahead of their final Champions League group-stage game at Bayern Munich. PSG only need to avoid a four-goal loss at the Allianz Arena to finish top of Group B, but youngsters Presnel Kimpembe and Giovani Lo Celso could be given starts again at the weekend. Elsewhere, Marseille visit Montpellier on Sunday bidding to extend a 10-match unbeaten streak in the league, while Lyon will look to bounce back from a shock home defeat by Lille at Caen. Monaco's close-season signing from Lazio has struggled to impress consistently since leaving Italy, but has still scored three league goals in only six starts. The 22-year-old Senegal international netted 16 times in Serie A last season, and with former Inter Milan striker Jovetic injured, Balde may prove the perfect foil for Falcao in the weeks before the winter break."

The Qatar-owned club will stay and train at the Aspire Zone facility. PSG spent time in Tunisia during last season's winter break but this will be their fifth trip to Qatar since the Qatar Sports Investments takeover in 2011. Unai Emery's team are unbeaten this season and moved nine points clear at the top of Ligue 1 after beating reigning champions Monaco 2-1 away on Sunday. The winter break in France lasts for just over two weeks until the first weekend of January, when top-flight clubs enter the French Cup."
597,21/11/2017,20:19,Paris return set to inspire Celtic's Dembele - Rodgers,Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers thinks Moussa Dembele will go on to become one of the best strikers in the world and he is hoping the Frenchman will thrive against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday.,"Dembele, 21, was born in the Paris suburbs and was on PSG's books as a youngster before opting to move to England to turn professional with Fulham. He then joined Celtic last year and has scored 38 goals in 61 games for the Scottish champions, becoming a key player in a side that has still never lost a domestic match under Rodgers. ""For the boys returning to Paris there's always a big motivation. Moussa left Paris when he was 15 and went to Fulham where he progressed really well in the formative stage of his career,"" Rodgers, who also has France under-21 midfielder Olivier Ntcham in his squad, said in the French capital on Tuesday. Dembele recently scored a 12-minute hat-trick playing for France under-21s against Slovenia and will relish the chance to run out at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday. ""I think he has the quality to go right to the top. I've worked with top talents especially at that end of the field and I certainly think he is on course to be one of the best strikers. ""He has shown it for Celtic and France under-21s and I'm sure (senior France coach) Didier Deschamps will be looking at the next step for him."" Despite Dembele's enormous potential, he has only scored six goals so far this season, and none in Europe. And there is a chance that he will start on the bench in Paris with Leigh Griffiths another option available to Rodgers. ""We wouldn't want it any other way. As a manager you need that competition,"" said the former Liverpool boss. ""They are two players with different qualities, but what I can get from both is goals. Leigh has shown his quality in the Champions League already in qualifying and at Anderlecht."" Celtic are already eliminated from the Champions League with two games still to play in Group B and were beaten 5-0 at home by PSG in September. However, they can clinch the consolation of a berth in the Europa League knockout rounds by bettering Anderlecht's result at home to Bayern Munich. Otherwise, the Scottish side will have another chance to do that when they entertain Anderlecht next month."
598,21/11/2017,15:46,Neymar's nocturnal antics not a worry to PSG coach,Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery insists he is not concerned about Neymar's lifestyle after the Brazilian superstar was photographed at a Paris nightclub in the early hours of Sunday.,"""Outside of his work, his football, he can enjoy himself with his friends,"" Emery said on Tuesday, at a press conference ahead of Wednesday's Champions League meeting with Celtic at the Parc des Princes. ""In training he is great. He is young, and he also needs to go out, but he is still responsible."" Neymar was pictured at a nightclub in the Paris suburbs attending a private concert held by the American rapper Tyga, according to a report in Le Parisien. Earlier he had played 90 minutes in PSG's 4-1 win over Nantes. The world's most expensive footballer has suffered a dip in form and there have been concerns about his love of a party, which he documents on his Instagram feed with more than 84 million followers. There have been regular media reports in recent weeks that Neymar, 25, is struggling to settle at PSG since his August move from Barcelona, with stories of rifts with team-mates and disagreements with Emery. But PSG's Spanish coach added: ""It is important to maintain a high level, but the younger players also need to spend time with their friends. ""He has the responsibility to rest up on Sunday. He was back with us yesterday and for tomorrow he will be fine."" Neymar has scored in each of PSG's four Champions League outings. The French club have taken maximum points and qualified for the last 16 with two games to spare. They top Group B with 17 goals scored and none conceded, and another victory against Celtic -- who are already eliminated -- could see PSG clinch top spot before they go to Bayern Munich next month. ""We want to demonstrate that we want to go very far in this competition. We did that when we went there,"" added Emery, with reference to PSG's 5-0 win in Glasgow when the sides last met in September. ""Celtic are still a good side, with international players who are used to winning, so this will be a difficult game."" Belgian full-back Thomas Meunier could return for Paris but Thiago Motta is out. The veteran midfielder has undergone surgery in the United States to clear up a knee problem. With Motta likely to be sidelined for a while, PSG have been linked with a move for young Brazilian midfielder Wendel, 20, of Rio de Janeiro side Fluminense. ""That is something the club is working on. They are thinking about the future, I am only thinking about the present,"" said Emery when asked about a possible transfer."
599,18/11/2017,19:42,Cavani kills Ranieri's Canaries,Edinson Cavani fired two goals past Claudio Ranieri's Nantes as Paris Saint-Germain went six points clear in Ligue 1 on Saturday with an eye-catching 4-1 win.,"With the Champions League visit of Celtic looming in midweek, PSG's Kylian Mbappe was rested but his replacement Javier Pastore scored one and made one, while Angel Di Maria fired home the other goal from a corner he had taken himself. The win puts PSG on 35 points from 13 games ahead of the defending champions Monaco on 29, with the sides to meet in a a table-top showdown on the south coast next weekend. ""We aren't thinking about Monaco, just about winning,"" Cavani said. The star of the show Saturday may have been Pastore but Cavani's brace lifted his goal tally to 15 league goals from 13 games, or 68 goals from 67 matches since Zlatan Ibrahimovic left for Manchester United. ""Very pleasing for a striker, but there's a long way to go and I want to carry on and get bigger and better match after match,"" Cavani said. Cavani timed his run onto Pastore's through ball perfectly before lashing a fierce shot low past 'keeper Ciprian Tatarusanu on 38 minutes for the opener. ""I gave him the ball and he scored the goal, that's the kind of player he is,"" Pastore said. Cavani's other strike was a tap-in late on after defenders watched in horror as the loose ball fell to the wrong man. In between Di Maris took a short corner which Marco Verratti returned to him before his searching left foot cross-shot crept in at the far corner to make it 2-0. Ranieri, the mastermind of Leicester City's Premier League title two seasons ago, brought on Pjejuce Nakoulma at 2-0 down and he pegged PSG back within three minutes to make it 2-1. But Parstore, fed by Verratti, lobbed the giant Romanian 'keeper, who got a hand to the ball only to see it drop over the line on 65 minutes. ""We were unlucky to lose 4-1, we played a good match. They are a huge team and you have to congratulate them,"" Ranieri said."
600,17/11/2017,02:20,Ranieri plots downfall of unbeaten PSG,"Claudio Ranieri, the wily Italian who masterminded Leicester City's remarkable Premier League triumph, hopes to spring another surprise when his Nantes side visit French leaders Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday.","Since his arrival at Nantes in June, Ranieri has built on the club's strong second half of last season under then-coach Sergio Conceicao to guide them to within two points of the Champions League spots. Nantes have picked up 23 points from a possible 30 following back-to-back defeats to start the campaign, and Ranieri is fairly relaxed ahead of the trip to the Parc des Princes. ""I'm going to take two buses,"" quipped Ranieri, as he mused how to stop a PSG attack that has plundered 39 goals in 12 matches. ""I know what's going to happen Saturday night. I want to see my team calm and really determined to play well. As for the result? I know we could lose,"" he said. ""I always have a precise idea (of how to play) against an opponent. The idea is always fantastic, but the reality is a bit different!"" ""Paris are going to win the championship. They've grown into a great team which is getting better all the time,"" he added. Brazilian superstar Neymar returns to domestic duty after a tumultuous fortnight with Brazil, cutting a fragile figure in the press conference that followed a 3-1 win over Japan in Lille last Friday. Though Neymar has scored 11 goals in 12 games since his world-record move to PSG from Barcelona, recent weeks have yielded stories of rifts with his team-mates and disagreements with coach Unai Emery. Brazil coach Tite spoke out in Neymar's defence last week as the striker wiped away tears, while Emery insisted there were no issues between himself and the player. ""None of these rumours are important. What counts are the discussions I have with him. We're very happy with him, he will triumph here,"" said Emery, whose side lead defending champions Monaco by four points. ""It's the same for all the players who change clubs, coaches, team-mates and cities. The adaptation process takes time,"" added the Spaniard. ""His team-mates, the staff and the club must do everything to help this process. He's getting better and better. It's what happens on the pitch that's most important. When the team gets results, things are good and everyone feels better."" Monaco face Amiens on Friday at the reopened Stade de la Licorne ahead of a crucial week that could spell the end of their Champions League campaign and heavily impact on their Ligue 1 title defence, with PSG heading to the principality next Sunday. Promoted Amiens were cleared to return to their home ground for the first time since a barrier collapse during the September 30 clash with Lille injured 29 people. The match with northern rivals Lille -- originally called off after just 16 minutes -- will be replayed on November 20. Nabil Fekir and in-form Lyon will chase a fifth straight league win away to Nice, while Marseille visit Bordeaux in the club's first match since terminating the contract of Patrice Evra. The former Manchester United star and France international left Marseille by mutual consent on November 10 after his infamous karate kick on one of Marseille's own fans. Saint-Etienne, who were thrashed 5-0 at home by fierce rivals Lyon last time out, are without a coach going into Friday's game with struggling Lille following the resignation of Oscar Garcia who stepped down on Wednesday after just five months at the helm.

601,16/11/2017,16:43,Knee surgery for PSG's Thiago Motta,"Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Thiago Motta looks set to go under the knife for a knee complaint which will sideline him until after the winter break, the club said on Thursday.","Motta is now 35 and has been playing less as midfield starlet Adrien Rabiot, 22, gradually starts to fullfil his potential in the ambitious side. Motta has been complaining of severe pain in his knee and club doctors have opted for arthroscopic cleansing, cleaning up of tiny pieces of bone that may be flouting around in the knee. ""Thiago Motta has been complaining of increasing pain in his right knee since September,"" PSG coach Unai Emery explained on their website. ""And this seems the best stage of the season to conduct arthroscopic cleansing,"" he said. ""There are plenty of players just waiting to grab their chance to get a start,"" said Emery. Rabiot, under contract until 2019, has been pushing for more playing time and even threatening to leave the club."
602,10/11/2017,17:25,Tearful Neymar blasts 'false' PSG rift stories,"An emotional Neymar on Friday called for an end to ""false stories"" about his alleged frosty relations with Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery and striker Edinson Cavani.","""I want to ask you to stop creating stories which are not true,"" Neymar told a press conference following Brazil's 3-1 international friendly victory over Japan in Lille, before leaving in tears. ""I want to say what I think. I'm totally realistic and what I don't like is these false stories about me, there is nothing bothering me at my club. ""I'm here because I asked to be here. It's going really well (in Paris), I'm really happy here and motivated. I'm a player who wants to give everything on the pitch. ""What bothers me is everyone creating stories about me, with my coach and with Cavani. These things are not real, it's not true."" Neymar and Cavani reportedly fell out over penalty-taking duties after the Uruguayan refused to let the former take a spot-kick in PSG's 2-0 win over Lyon in September. Both players subsequently played down the incident, but rumours continue to swirl claiming the Brazilian is unsettled in the French capital. Neymar, who scored a penalty but also missed a spot-kick in the win over Japan, admitted he had also spoken to national team coach Tite about the matter. ""I just want to be happy, I'm not here to make or create trouble with anybody. I know my role on my pitch and I do what my coach asks me to do,"" he said. ""I had a chat with (team coordinator) Edu and Tite because these things are hurting me, every day there are these stories."" Tite, who replaced Dunga as Brazil boss in June 2016, quashed any notion that he himself had experienced run-ins with the 25-year-old striker. ""People said I had problems with Neymar, it wasn't true. We heard that a lot and it wasn't true,"" said Tite. ""My relationship with him is the best. I'm not saying this to be a nice guy but because it's true."""
603,04/11/2017,20:15,100 up for insatiable Cavani as PSG win without Neymar,The injured Neymar was left at home as Edinson Cavani reached a century of goals in Ligue 1 with a brace in Paris Saint-Germain's 5-0 romp away to Angers on Saturday.,"The world's most expensive player sat out the game at the Stade Raymond Kopa with a minor thigh problem picked up in the midweek Champions League win over Anderlecht but he was not missed as PSG went provisionally seven points clear at the top of the table from Monaco. Kylian Mbappe and Julian Draxler both scored early goals and Cavani netted his 100th in France's top flight on the half-hour mark. The Uruguayan scored again on the hour mark before Mbappe grabbed his second of the day late on to take him to six goals in 12 appearances for the club. A second successive five-goal victory for PSG means they remain unbeaten in all competitions this season, while Angers are still without a win at home. ""I think this performance was on the same level as those at home against Nice (3-0) and Anderlecht (5-0) this week. It was along the same lines in terms of our attitude and our mentality,"" said coach Unai Emery. As well as Neymar, PSG were without Marquinhos and Angel Di Maria, whose partners have both given birth in recent days. Emery therefore opted to give a first start since August to Javier Pastore. PSG's opener arrived inside five minutes as Mbappe turned in a Dani Alves cross from the right, and it was 2-0 before quarter of an hour had been played. Again Alves was the provider with a delightful through ball for Draxler, who beat Mathieu Michel with a clipped first-time finish. The third goal that allowed Cavani to reach his century came at the end of a brilliant move, with Alves finding Adrien Rabiot, who released Mbappe to showcase his lightning pace and set up the Uruguayan to blast home. Cavani, signed from Napoli in 2013, reached the landmark on his 145th Ligue 1 appearance and joins a select club in having scored 100 times in two of Europe's big five leagues having also achieved the feat in Serie A. The only others to have done so are Gonzalo Higuain (Spain and Italy) and Zlatan Ibrahimovic (France and Italy). He is also well on course to catch Ibrahimovic as the club's all-time top scorer in the league, with the Swede hitting 113 in his four seasons. Cavani hit his 101st -- his 13th of this season -- in trademark fashion, starting his run in the right-back position and bursting forward to collect a Draxler pass before toe-poking home. Mbappe completed the rout as he rounded Michel and scored from a tight angle after being released by Lucas Moura. Reigning champions Monaco can close back to within four points of PSG at the summit with a win at home to Guingamp later (1900 GMT). Claudio Ranieri's Nantes host Toulouse looking for a win that will take them back up to third above Lyon, who go to derby rivals Saint-Etienne on Sunday. Sunday also sees Marseille host Caen in what could be a tense atmosphere in their first outing since Patrice Evra was suspended by the club for aiming a karate kick at the head of one of his team's own supporters. Evra was red-carded after the incident, which occurred in the pre-match warm-up before Thursday's Europa League clash with Vitoria Guimaraes in Portugal."
604,30/10/2017,19:28,Mbappe form casts cloud over PSG with last 16 in sight,The misfiring Kylian Mbappe could be dropped for Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League clash with Anderlecht on Tuesday as the French club look to secure their place in the last 16.,"Mbappe's rise to superstardom has been rapid but the France forward, who is still just 18, is currently going through the worst spell of his short career to date. After starring in Monaco's run to the Ligue 1 title and Champions League semi-finals last season, Mbappe joined PSG in August on an initial loan deal that will become permanent for 180 million euros ($209 million) next year. That will make Mbappe the second most expensive player in history behind his PSG team-mate Neymar, but recent performances suggest that the constant glare of the media spotlight is beginning to catch up with him. ""He is fine. Since he arrived here there have been a lot of changes for him, on the pitch and in terms of his profile in the media, and he is still pretty young so sometimes I don't think it's easy,"" insisted PSG midfielder Adrien Rabiot on Monday. ""He had some very good performances very early on and he came from a club where he had played very well, in Europe as well. He has been exposed right away, he's a real star, and at that age it is really difficult to handle it all."" Mbappe has scored four times in his first 10 games in a Paris shirt, including the opener in the 4-0 win over Anderlecht in Belgium two weeks ago. But since that game he received a rating of just two out of 10 from sports daily L'Equipe for his display in the 2-2 draw at Marseille and was off colour in Friday's 3-0 win against Nice. Angel Di Maria was excellent in that match standing in for the suspended Neymar. The Brazilian is back here, but Di Maria will hope to keep his place and Mbappe is the obvious candidate to take a breather. ""It is a new experience for him,"" coach Unai Emery told reporters at the Parc des Princes on Monday. ""When you play well, you open all the papers and you listen to all the sports shows and they say that you are the best. ""You need to be able to balance your mentality, your emotions. When you play badly, you have to be ready for the criticism."" PSG, who are without the injured Thiago Motta, have had a flying start in Champions League Group B, winning their opening three games with 12 goals scored and none conceded. They will secure qualification for the last 16 with two matches to spare if they beat their Belgian visitors and Celtic fail to beat Bayern Munich in Glasgow at the same time. Anderlecht got a 1-1 draw when they last visited the Parc des Princes in the group stage in 2013, but they have yet to register a point or even a goal in this season's competition. Such is the gulf between the clubs that coach Hein Vanhaezebrouck even admits the Belgian champions are prioritising their domestic meeting with Club Brugge next weekend. However, he insisted: ""This is not a small match, it is a match against maybe the best team in Europe at the moment. ""We will try to show up well. We have not come to be massacred or just to do our job because we are obliged to -- otherwise I would prefer to stay at home."""
605,27/10/2017,22:40,Cavani doubles up to send PSG seven points clear,Suspended Neymar watched from the stands as Edinson Cavani's brace inspired Paris Saint-Germain to a 3-0 win over Nice on Friday to send Unai Emery's side seven points clear in Ligue 1.,"Cavani's first half double, both assists provided by Angel Di Maria, earned unbeaten PSG their ninth league win of the season. It pushed them up to 29 points, seven clear of defending champions Monaco who face Bordeaux on Saturday. And it was the ideal warm-up ahead of Tuesday's clash with Anderlecht when they can secure a place in the Champions League last 16. The win also served to erase the memory of last week's draining 2-2 draw with hated rivals Marseille. Neymar was absent for only the second time since his world record signing, the Brazilian copping a one-match ban after being sent off in that stormy visit to the south coast. Di Maria filled Neymar's expensive shoes on only his second start since August. Emery introduced centre back Presnel Kimpembe for Marquinhos with Spanish left-back Yuri Berchiche replacing Layvin Kurzawa. Rightback Dani Alves returned but veteran midfielder Thiago Motta was absent because of a knee complaint Mario Balotelli was a welcome starter for the visitors after missing last week's 2-1 loss to Strasbourg with a calf knock. Nice coach Lucien Favre was forced into an unscripted last minute change when keeper Yoan Cardinale suffered an injury in warm-up with Walter Benitez summoned off the bench. The Argentine stand-in keeper was quickly put to work by PSG as Di Maria fired in an inch perfect freekick from the left with the match barely three minutes old. Cavani dived low to head past Benitez by the near post to bring a smile to the face of Neymar and to secure a place in his club's history with their 2,500th league goal. Balotelli tested PSG keeper Alphonse Areola with a long range effort down at the other end but that proved a rare respite for Benitez. On 31 minutes Cavani claimed his 99th Ligue 1 goal when the Uruguayan ran onto Di Maria's neat flick to round the on-rushing Benitez and slide the ball into an empty net. Benitez then had to act sharply to deny Di Maria getting his first goal of the campaign off an assist from Kylian Mbappe. The second half was only seven minutes old when a defensive blunder by Nice led to Cavani heading into the box with Alves getting a touch before the ball was helped on its way past Benitez by Nice captain Dante. Mbappe then showed why he will become the world's second most expensive player when his loan deal is completed at the end of the season, the teenager sprinting round a cluster of Nice defenders before firing into the side netting. As PSG reflected on a job well done Nice were left contemplating their fourth league loss on the bounce to keep them hovering above the relegation zone."

Neymar grabbed a brilliant equaliser in a fiery encounter at Marseille Sunday before his side went down 2-1 with ten minutes to go. Leading the chase for another equaliser, Neymar appeared to lose his cool, picking up two yellows in quick succession for retaliation. His teammate Edinson Cavani levelled with a dramatic injury-time free-kick to save a point for the Ligue 1 leaders. PSG coach Unai Emery has told his 25-year-old star to wise up to provocation tactics. ""He is intelligent. He is also aware that he must learn from what happened on Sunday,"" said Emery. ""I spoke to him about it before the match and we said not to get involved in any provocation. But on the pitch, with the intensity and the aggression, the players are people The 222 million-euro ($264 million) Brazilian has scored 10 goals in 11 games since his move from Barcelona. Neymar was also given a further one-match suspended ban that will be activated should he be sent off again this season."

I am at the disposal of the attorney general if he wants to see me again,"" said the Qatari after his day-long appearance with Swiss justice officials. ""I am calm and I am leaving calmly."" Khelaifi, a 43-year-old Qatari with close ties to the Gulf state's royal family, is under investigation for allegedly striking illegal media rights deals with disgraced former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke, who had been Sepp Blatter's right-hand man. Khelaifi and his legal team arrived at the Swiss attorney general (OAG) headquarters in the Swiss capital Bern at about 9:30am (0730 GMT), avoiding the main entrance and two dozen reporters gathered outside. Khelaifi and Valcke have been under investigation since March in connection with media rights for the 2026 and 2030 World Cups on allegations including corruption, bribery, criminal mismanagement and forgery of a document. Authorities in France, Greece, Italy and Spain have cooperated with the Swiss probe, including by raiding properties. But the OAG only went public with the case on October 12. Khelaifi's high-profile French lawyer, Francis Szpiner, then swiftly announced that his sports tycoon client ""denies any corruption"" and ""wanted to be heard as soon as possible"" by Swiss prosecutors. OAG spokesman Andre Marty told reporters there was ""a good dozen"" lawyers in the room on Wednesday, ""from all parties involved"", in addition to two representatives of the Swiss attorney general. It is highly likely that FIFA lawyers were present, since the integrity of contracts signed by Valcke on behalf of world football's governing body is a central question in the case. The beIN Media group, which is headquartered in Doha, has insisted that its World Cup rights deals were ""advantageous for FIFA"", rejecting any suggestion that it got favourable treatment. The contract covers broadcasting rights for the MENA (Middle East, North Africa) region for the tournaments. The Qatar broadcaster's offices in Paris have been raided at the request of Swiss authorities. A raid was also carried out at a luxury Sardinian villa that, it is alleged, was put at the disposal of Valcke, who is serving a 10-year ban from all football-related activity. The villa, set in lush grounds on the Mediterranean island and which has an estimated value of seven million euros ($8.3 million), is owned by an international real estate agency. Valcke, a 53-year-old French national, has told the French sports newspaper L'Equipe that he ""received nothing from Nasser"".

PSG, who were bought by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011, are not implicated in the Swiss investigation. The corruption accusations are the latest to rock world football which is still reeling from the events of 2015, when FIFA officials were arrested en masse at the governing body's annual conference. They are also the latest allegations to target Qatar. The Gulf state has found itself routinely accused of corruption since controversially winning the right to host the 2022 World Cup, charges it has always denied."

Marseille are fifth on 18. ""It was an important goal given how this match went,"" said the Uruguayan striker Cavani. ""It was very difficult for us to play in this atmosphere and it's an important point. That's football -- there are matches where you have to give everything."" Ambitious Marseille, bought last year by American businessman Frank McCourt, are targeting a return to the Champions League and would likely have settled for a point ahead of the kick-off. The atmosphere was red hot with supporters fighting running battles with police outside the ground with even cars bearing Paris number plates being attacked. There were 13 arrests at a game from which PSG fans were banned over security fears. Inside, Neymar was constantly pelted with coins and lighters when he took corners and needed police protection with raised shields when he went close to the sidelines. After a series of heavy tackles the Brazilian, the world's most expensive footballer, picked up his first yellow for standing on the hand of Morgan Sanson, who had just fouled him. Two minutes later Neymar suffered a further series of challenges and eventually lost his cool by appearing to aim a headbutt at Ocampos. The Argentine fell to the floor and remained there before Neymar smiled broadly and turned away without protest as the referee waved his red card. PSG's other key striker Kylian Mbappe had an evening to forget as he was marked and tackled out of the match and was even booked when appealing for a penalty. ""It wasn't the best Paris performance,"" said Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda. ""We are disappointed, that goal killed us, but we have to use this as a springboard now."" Marseille coach Rudi Garcia wa also frustrated. ""We lost two points, we could have gone 3-1 up. But it's our own fault for giving them the chance,"" said Garcia, who was previously at Roma and Lille. Lyon climbed to fourth earlier on Sunday with a 5-0 away win at promoted Troyes as Dutch striker Memphis Depay scored a second-half hat-trick. The 23-year-old Depay joined Lyon in January 2017 from Manchester United and is finding his feet in France now that Lyon have sold Alexandre Lacazette to Arsenal. The injured Mario Balotelli watched from the stands as Nice slumped to another defeat, going down 2-1 at home to Strasbourg. The side who finished third last season are currently 14th and go to Paris Saint-Germain next Friday. Monaco beat Caen 2-0 on Saturday with Ligue 1's leading scorer Radamel Falcao netting a penalty for his 13th goal of the campaign to keep the pressure on the leaders"
612,21/10/2017,13:24,Neymar a mentor for Mbappe at PSG says Marquinhos,"Neymar will do more for Paris Saint-Germain than the former number 10 Ronaldinho and has been key to the younger new recruit Kylian Mbappe, the club's vice-captain Marquinhos has told AFP.","Marquinhos and Neymar were on the same gold medal-winning Brazil team at the 2016 Rio Olympics and the defender believes the striker's leadership skills will be an important factor in the club's success this season. ""He's a wonderful player. When it's a big game that's when he shows the most character, the best attitude,"" Marquinhos said of the 25-year-old Brazilian superstar who joined PSG for a world-record 222 million euros ($261.5 million) in the close season. ""He likes to take charge of things and he loves a boiling atmosphere,"" said the central defender ahead of PSG's trip to Marseille for a Ligue 1 grudge match Sunday with the capital outfit top on 25 points and OM third on 17. ""I know Neymar well and know he loves this kind of game,"" said Marquinhos. The 23-year-old Marquinhos, who is in his fifth season at PSG and has played over 20 times for Brazil, says Neymar's role as mentor to the 18-year-old Mbappe will also be helpful. ""Neymar knows how important he is for Kylian, as Messi was important for him, as Ronaldinho was important for Messi. ""Kylian is an adorable guy, and the two of them hit it off straight away,"" said Marquinhos of the dazzling striker who arrived from Monaco a few weeks after Neymar. ""Even if they don't speak the same language, on the pitch you can see how well they get on. ""Both of them are capable (of winning the Ballon d'Or). The main thing is that it's magnificent to have the pair of them here,"" said Marquinhos. Ronaldinho, the Brazilian superstar of his time, played for PSG from 2001 to 2003. Qatar-owned PSG recruited Mbappe from Monaco just before the transfer deadline last month on an initial loan deal which is set to be made into a permanent move next year for 180 million euros."
613,14/10/2017,20:05,PSG fight to go six clear in France,A Thomas Meunier brace gave Paris Saint-Germain a hard-fought 2-1 win at Dijon in Ligue 1 on Saturday after the hosts thought they'd earned a late draw through Benjamin Jeannot's stunning volley.,"The result gives PSG, whose chairman Nasser al-Khelaifi is under investigation in his capacity as beIN Media chief over the sale of World Cup broadcasting rights, a six-point lead over second-placed Monaco who lost 3-2 at Lyon on Friday. In a packed and raucous stadium, Dijon made a real fight of it as a PSG side deprived of Edinson Cavani, Marco Verratti, Thiago Motta, Thiago Silva and Layvin Kurzawa were given a rough time by the hosts. Angel Di Maria, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe could have scored a hatful and PSG hit the woodwork twice before their go-ahead goal on 70 minutes. Belgian right-back Meunier held his nerve to slot the opening goal past prone Dijon goalkeeper Baptiste Reynet, who had just parried a shot in what was an excellent performance. His teammate Jeannot's goal will be a contender for goal of the season, running at full tilt he fired a left-footed volley with such force in the 87th minute it left PSG keeper Alphonse Areola rooted to the spot. The rapture was short-lived however as Meunier again calmly slotted home as Mbappe put the ball on a platter for him deep into injury time. ""It was a small dose of destiny,"" Meunier told reporters. Meunier has now scored three league goals in his last two appearances, further strengthening his case for inclusion in Wednesday's Champions League tie at Anderlecht. ""We knew it would be tough but we were not expecting to have to fight like that,"" France midfielder Adrien Rabiot told French television after the game. ""For them it was their game of the season and their mentality and team spirit made us use up a great deal of energy."" Swiss prosecutors revealed this week they are probing PSG chairman Khelaifi, who heads the Qatari-owned beIN Media group, and disgraced former FIFA executive Jerome Valcke over the sale of media rights for World Cups from 2018-2030. FIFA said Friday it was also investigating Khelaifi over the media rights issue. On Friday, Nabil Fekir's last-gasp free-kick delivered three crucial points to Lyon as their captain sealed a home win over champions Monaco, who rested Colombian striker Radamel Falcao ahead of their midweek hosting of Besiktas."

615,03/10/2017,19:25,"Neymar penalty spat has calmed down, says Cavani",Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani has played down his penalty-taking spat with Paris Saint-Germain team-mate Neymar.,"Cavani and Brazilian Neymar, the world's most expensive player, reportedly fell out over penalty-taking duties for PSG in recent league matches. The despite blew up a couple of weeks ago when Cavani, PSG's regular penalty-taker, refused to let Neymar take a spot-kick against Lyon, only to then miss. But then at the weekend, and after rumours Cavani had been offered a million euros to cede penalty duties to his higher-profile team-mate, Neymar took, and scored, a spot-kick against Bordeaux. ""These things happen in football. These are things that are sometimes blown up,"" Cavani, speaking to reporters in Caracas ahead of a World Cup qualifier against Venezuela on Thursday, said on Monday. ""We all know that they become bigger than they are. They are sorted out in the dressing room. Every (problem) has a solution. It's calmed down."" Despite giving up spot-kick duties, which Cavani took over when Zlatan Ibrahimovic left PSG a year and a half ago, the Uruguayan has still outscored his Brazilian team-mate eight goals to six in France's Ligue 1."
616,03/10/2017,18:20,"Mbappe could win Ballon d'Or, says Matuidi","Kylian Mbappe is so good he could one day emulate the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo by winning the Ballon d'Or, his France international team-mate Blaise Matuidi said on Tuesday.","While Mbappe and Matuidi have never been club team-mates, the former joining Paris Saint-Germain from Monaco in August only after the latter had left for Juventus, they have lined up on the same team sheet for the national side. And getting another chance to study Mbappe up close and personal in training at France's Clairefontaine base ahead of their final two World Cup qualifiers against Bulgaria and Belarus, Matuidi has been impressed. ""Hopefully he'll keep going the way he has, we're lucky to have such players in our team, we must make use of them,"" said Matuidi. ""He (Mbappe) is someone who can win you a match with his ingenuity. ""He keeps his feet on the ground, that's what's so great despite all the talent he could have. ""He's always keen to work hard, to do more. He's sure to have a very, very big future. ""I believe he'll be amongst those who could one day win the Ballon d'Or."" Matuidi, 30 and capped 58 times, said he hasn't come across a more precocious talent during his time in the professional game. ""To be honest, no,"" he said of the 18-year-old starlet. ""At that age, what he's doing is pretty exceptional. ""He's a great player -- he's young but he seems like a 30-year-old."" France lead European qualifying group A by one point going into their final two matches, knowing that a maximum return will guarantee them a place at Russia 2018. However, any slip up away to Bulgaria on Saturday would likely see them lose top spot to Sweden, who play minnows Luxembourg. Only the group winners qualify directly for the World Cup, while the runners-up will face a play-off."
617,01/10/2017,20:12,Verratti ruled out of Italy's World Cup qualifier,"Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti has been ruled out of Italy's World Cup qualifier against Macedonia in Turin next week, the Italian football federation announced Sunday.","Coach Giampiero Ventura has called up Cagliari midfielder Nicolo Barella in his place for the clash on October 6 and a friendly against Albania three days later, the federation said without giving any explanation. Verratti played 79 minutes for PSG on Saturday before being substituted in the 6-2 win over Ligue 1 rivals Bordeaux. Italy are second in Group G behind Spain and look set for the playoffs to qualify for the World Cup in Russia next year. Ventura also called up Chievo striker Roberto Inglese in case Torino's Andrea Belotti is unavailable after picking up a knee injury playing Serie A this weekend."
618,30/09/2017,19:23,Neymar sparkles as PSG thrash Bordeaux,"Neymar scored twice, including a first-half penalty, and created another goal as Paris Saint-Germain hammered previously unbeaten Bordeaux 6-2 in Ligue 1 on Saturday.","The Brazilian curled in a brilliant 30-yard free-kick after just five minutes at the Parc des Princes before sliding in Edinson Cavani to double the lead seven minutes later. Thomas Meunier's excellent side-footed finish made it 3-0 to PSG on 21 minutes, but Bordeaux hit back on the half hour as Younousse Sankhare applied the final touch to a slick team move. PSG were then awarded a penalty, the first since a row between Neymar and Cavani over spot-kick duties overshadowed a 2-0 win against Lyon a fortnight ago, with Neymar this time stepping up to convert. ""For me the important thing with penalties is to score them,"" said PSG coach Unai Emery. ""The main thing is the two of them see the opportunity and they both can take penalties. The decision is down to those two. We've already spoken about it internally."" Julian Draxler volleyed in a superb fifth before half-time and Kylian Mbappe added another on 58 minutes, while Malcom scored a late penalty for Bordeaux, as PSG pulled three points clear of defending champions Monaco at the top. ""It was a good win against a team that was still undefeated,"" said Mbappe. ""We don't need to send a message, we're just concentrating on ourselves. We could still do better, we're not going to be picky, but there's still room for a bit more."" Emery rested captain Thiago Silva for the visit of third-place Bordeaux, who arrived in the capital trailing PSG by just four points after seven matches. The hosts brushed aside five-time European champions Bayern Munich 3-0 in midweek and the gap in class on Saturday was evident from the start against Jocelyn Gourvennec's team. With Monaco dropping points in Friday's 1-1 draw at home to Montpellier, PSG immediately signalled their intent as three quick-fire goals left Bordeaux seeking to limit the damage. Neymar struck early as his magnificent free-kick flashed beyond a helpless Benoit Costil, with the Brazilian then playing in Cavani to poke in his eighth league goal of the season on 12 minutes. PSG were further in front when Yuri Berchiche's cross from the left skipped past Mbappe but Meunier ran onto it and the Belgian international steered masterfully past Costil. Bordeaux replied on 31 minutes after Theo Pellenard demonstrated remarkable composure to thread in Nicolas de Preville who squared for Sankhare to tap into an empty net. But a senseless handball from Otavio gifted PSG a penalty and Neymar, rather than Cavani whose effort in the Lyon win on September 17 was saved, tucked away the spot-kick for his sixth league goal. Draxler made it five in style on the stroke of half-time when he fired in from Mbappe's floated cross, and the French teenager notched a goal of his own on 58 minutes after he was released in behind the defence by the German. Bordeaux substitute Alexandre Mendy smacked the outside of the post on 69 minutes, while Neymar nearly completed his hat-trick when his shot whistled just wide after a clever exchange with Draxler. Brazilian Malcom, who extended his contract with Bordeaux until 2021 this week, netted a consolation in the final minute after Jonathan Cafu was fouled in the area by Meunier."
619,29/09/2017,13:52,Ben Arfa appeals to LFP over PSG exclusion,"Outcast France international Hatem Ben Arfa has appealed to the French League's (LFP) legal committee after again being sent to train with Paris Saint-Germain's reserves, the LFP told AFP on Friday.","An earlier story in L'Equipe newspaper said the French giants had told Ben Arfa to return to training with the reserves from Friday onwards. It's the second time this season the 30-year-old has been banished from the first team and comes only two weeks after being welcomed back into the fold. PSG originally sent the attacking midfielder to train with the reserves after unsuccessfully trying to offload the former Newcastle United and Marseille player during the summer. ""Legally, I believe the club has violated the professional football Charter,"" Ben Arfa's lawyer Jean-Jacques Bertrand told AFP three weeks ago. The Charter allows teams to relegate a professional player to a second training group as long as it is only ""temporary (and) exclusively for sporting reasons relating to the management of the squad"". Ben Arfa was left out of PSG's Champions League squad this season while his hopes of forcing coach Unai Emery into a rethink took a hit by the mega-money signings of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe in August. With the departure of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Manchester United, Ben Arfa was PSG's marquee signing just over a year ago following a stellar campaign with Nice that saw him rebuild his faltering career after several unsuccessful years in England. But his PSG dream soon turned sour and he was left in limbo as Emery made clear before the season began that he didn't want the temperamental player."
620,27/09/2017,22:42,Neymar on target as PSG outclass Bayern,Edinson Cavani and Neymar both scored as Paris Saint-Germain claimed a convincing 3-0 victory over a disappointing Bayern Munich in their heavyweight Champions League clash in the French capital on Wednesday.,"PSG got off to a dream start as their other Brazilian summer signing Dani Alves gave them the lead inside 90 seconds at the Parc des Princes and they never looked back. Cavani's sweeping first-time strike just after the half-hour mark made it 2-0 before Neymar completed the scoring in the second half as Bayern went down to their heaviest defeat since losing to Barcelona by the same score in the semi-finals of this competition in May 2015. The result leaves the French club top of Group B with the maximum six points from two games, eight goals scored and none conceded. They are on course to win the section -- Bayern are level on three points with Celtic, who won at Anderlecht. For PSG this was a chance to measure themselves against one of the continent's traditional powers in their biggest European match since their humiliating exit in Barcelona last season. In that regard the evening was a resounding success for Unai Emery's team, although the German club were some way short of their usual standards. The match also saw Cavani and Neymar feature together for the first time since their disagreement over who should take a penalty in a league game against Lyon 10 days previously. This time there were no such disputes, and both men could celebrate contributing to the final outcome. Bayern have been among the critics of PSG's spending policy after a summer which saw them notably spend a world-record 222 million euros ($264 million) to sign Neymar from Barcelona. The Brazilian is reportedly being paid more than three million euros a month in Paris, and Bayern supporters had that in mind as they unfurled a pointed banner prior to kick-off. Complaining about match tickets costing 75 euros, it read: ""We are not Neymar. Ticket prices must be reasonable."" It would have been easier to swallow paying that price if their team had won, but they fell behind in the second minute and never recovered. Neymar was allowed to cut in from the left before picking out Alves, who arrived unmarked in the area to take a touch and finish past Sven Ulreich, standing in for the injured Manuel Neuer in the Bayern goal. Javi Martinez came closest to equalising for Carlo Ancelotti's side with a half-volley from the edge of the area that was tipped over by Alphonse Areola, but the hosts were able to soak up the pressure and hit on the break. Cavani shot just wide after being fed by Kylian Mbappe and those two combined for the second goal in the 31st minute, Mbappe again teeing up Cavani for a superb first-time finish high into the net and his 10th goal this season. Bayern were stunned, and a combination of the 'MCN' then almost brought a third, with Neymar laying off Mbappe's pass for Cavani, whose effort was saved. Things did get worse for the visitors in the second half and they conceded again in the 63rd minute, with Neymar poking home from inside the six-yard box as Martinez failed to clear following good play by Mbappe. That was Neymar's sixth goal for PSG and the 18th in total from the 'MCN', with the promise of many more to come."
621,26/09/2017,18:59,'Money doesn't score goals' - Robben mocks PSG,Arjen Robben poked fun at big-spending Paris Saint-Germain on the eve of Bayern Munich's key Champions League away match in the French capital.,"With Anderlecht and Celtic also in the pool, the PSG-Bayern clash at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday could go a long way to deciding who wins Group B. ""Paris have certainly given out a few more euros than us, but money doesn't score goals, quality on the pitch scores goals, good teams score goals,"" said veteran winger Robben before the team jetted to Paris. PSG signed Neymar from Barcelona for a world record 222 million euros ($264m) last month and recruited Kylian Mbappe from Monaco on an initial loan deal which is set to be made into a permanent move for 180 million euros next year. But when asked about PSG's star-studded 'MCN' attack -- Mbappe, Edinson Cavani and Neymar -- Robben was unfazed: ""The important thing is the performance of the team, not just to focus on particular players"". Meanwhile, when asked about his Dutch team-mate's comments, Bayern centre-back Mats Hummels was slightly more diplomatic about PSG's strengths. ""He is absolutely right that money doesn't score goals but it does allow you to buy players who score goals,"" Hummels told reporters at the Parc des Princes. ""PSG are a top-level club. They are very strong going forward, and are well covered in all other positions. A bit like us they have two players per position."" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge is convinced the German champions -- who beat Anderlecht 3-0 in their first group outing two weeks ago -- can get a good result in the French capital. ""I know our team, they are highly motivated and concentrated for games like this,"" said the former striker. ""I am convinced we can get something out of this game."" Nevertheless, the biggest test for Bayern's shaky defence -- which threw away a two-goal lead at home to struggling Wolfsburg in a 2-2 draw last Friday -- will be to contain the 'MCN'. ""Of course, that is an attack with world-class players, we have to control that, but we have more experience,"" countered Rummenigge. Bayern president Uli Hoeness launched a thinly-veiled attack on PSG's spending policy in an interview on Monday, but Rummenigge focused on the football. ""This is a prestige game, but one thing is clear: the Champions League is not decided, we want to create the conditions to become group winners."" ryj-as/mw <org>CELTIC PLC</org>"
622,26/09/2017,15:30,'We have more enemies now' admits PSG coach Emery,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery believes it reflects well on his team that Europe's traditional powerhouses now see the French club as ""enemies"" after their unprecedented close-season spending spree.","PSG spent a world-record 222 million euros ($264 million) to sign Neymar from Barcelona and also welcomed Kylian Mbappe from Monaco on an initial loan deal that is set to become a permanent move for 180 million euros next year. After failing to make it past the quarter-finals of the Champions League in the last five years -- and following their humiliating loss to Barcelona last season -- those deals were the clearest signs yet of the determination of PSG's Qatari owners to win the European Cup and they have upset their rivals in the process. ""When I was in Spain, I watched the big clubs -- Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, the Manchester clubs, Juventus -- and I saw that every year they would buy the best players in the world,"" said Emery, speaking ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Bayern in Paris. ""The team here has taken big steps towards competing with the best sides. Today, in sporting terms, we have more enemies. ""They see that we are a serious team with the players we have bought in the past and also this year, and now we can also be among the candidates to win the Champions League. ""That is why for other teams we are now the sporting enemies and people talk more about us. Lots of things are said, some true, some not. But I think it's good that people are talking a lot about PSG because PSG are among the top clubs in Europe."" The president of Spain's La Liga, Javier Tebas, recently accused PSG of ""laughing"" at UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules with their signings of Neymar and Mbappe, who had also been a target for Real Madrid. Wednesday's opponents Bayern have been critics of the French side too. Bayern president Uli Hoeness told German magazine Kicker this week that spending 100 million euros on a player would be ""unacceptable"" for his club. Meanwhile, Bayern winger Arjen Robben mocked PSG before the German side's departure for Paris on Tuesday, reminding them that ""money doesn't score goals"". PSG and Bayern are level on three points each in Champions League Group B ahead of Wednesday's game, having both won on the opening matchday."

The Spiegel claims Neymar earned 54 million euros at Barcelona last season, 8.5 million more than Lionel Messi, considered one of the world's best -- and highest paid -- players alongside Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo."
624,23/09/2017,14:16,Neymar-Cavani rivalry 'healthy' for PSG - Okocha,"The tension between Paris Saint-Germain forwards Neymar and Edinson Cavani is ""healthy"" and they should be left to sort things out themselves, according to the club's former star Jay-Jay Okocha.","Cavani and world-record signing Neymar squabbled over a penalty during PSG's 2-0 win over Lyon last weekend, which Cavani took and missed, and Neymar is since reported to have apologised for his behaviour. But Okocha believes the two players can help push each other to greater heights and says that when he and Ronaldinho were on free-kick duties at Parc des Princes, they simply took it in turns. ""It's healthy competition. It's always good to have more than one player who can take free-kicks or penalties,"" he told AFP during an interview in London on Friday. ""At the end of the day, it happens in almost every team. You just have to negotiate and say: 'You take the first one, I take the second one.' ""It's all about the team and winning matches. It can be negotiated. Each player has got his best spot, so you know that if it's in that area, you're definitely taking it. ""And if it's in a neutral area, whoever feels good can take it."" Okocha was present at the announcement of the three-man shortlist for this year's Best FIFA Men's Player Award, which pits Neymar against Cristiano Ronaldo and his former Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi. Ronaldo and Messi have won every major world player award since 2008, but Okocha believes Neymar's move to Paris will help the 25-year-old Brazilian in his quest to eclipse them. ""He's not too far. It's all about competing, believing in himself and consistency,"" said Okocha, who played for PSG between 1998 and 2002. ""The other two have refused to give in so to go above them, you have to do a bit more than they are doing, which is a very tough ask. ""He took a bold decision to move, but now he can be his own man and he can show that he has what it takes to be the best."" Okocha, 44, also had some words of advice for his nephew, Arsenal winger Alex Iwobi. While Iwobi was praised for his performance in Arsenal's 0-0 draw at Chelsea last weekend, after being selected ahead of Alexis Sanchez, his uncle believes he may have to bide his time before nailing down a first-team place. ""I don't know about getting ahead of Alexis Sanchez, but he has done well so far,"" Okocha said. ""We shouldn't forget this is his second season with the A team. He can only get better. ""My happiness is that he's in good hands. He's in a very good team and he's progressing as a player. He's got an opportunity to grab. ""I don't want to put him under pressure. All I care about is his progress as a player. He should be patient."" Iwobi, 21, is one of the new breed of Nigeria players who have taken the Super Eagles to within touching distance of a place at next year's World Cup. After missing out on a spot at successive Africa Cups of Nations, it would be Nigeria's first major tournament appearance since the 2014 World Cup. The team's difficulties prompted Okocha to think about running for president of the Nigeria Football Federation, but he says recent results suggest a corner has been turned. ""I was worried about the direction our football was going in. We were suffering,"" said the Nigeria great. ""I realised that we had to change the administrative part of the game because if you don't put a good structure in place, especially for the younger players, you will suffer in the future. ""That was one of the reasons why I was thinking about that, but things are looking better now. If they can save me that stress, I will be happy doing what I'm doing now."""
625,22/09/2017,15:52,Injured Neymar to miss first PSG game - reports,"Neymar will miss Paris Saint-Germain's Ligue 1 game at Montpellier on Saturday after the world's most expensive player injured his right foot, French media report.","The Brazilian striker has made an immediate impact at his new club with four goals and four assists from his first five outings since moving to the French capital from Barcelona. According to Radio RMC on Friday, the injury does not throw into doubt Neymar's participation in Wednesday's Champions League clash against Bayern Munich. Neymar posted a photo of his injured right foot on Snapchat. His absence in Montpellier will mean no repeat of last weekend's 'penaltygate' incident with fellow PSG striker Edinson Cavani. The South American pair fell out over who should take a spot kick in Sunday's 2-0 win over Lyon. That left PSG atop Ligue 1 on 18 points, three clear of defending champions Monaco."
626,22/09/2017,15:19,'Penaltygate' threatens to halt PSG's lightning start,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery refused to name his first-choice penalty taker on Thursday, after Neymar and Edinson Cavani's apparent falling out against Lyon last week.","The Ligue 1 leaders travel to Montpellier on Saturday looking to make it seven straights wins to kick off the season, after smashing spending records in the close season to compile the fearsome 'MCN' front line of Neymar, Cavani and Kylian Mbappe. But the South American pair disagreed over who should take a penalty in the 2-0 win over Lyon, before Cavani saw his effort saved by Anthony Lopes, with Neymar appearing to walk away shaking his head in disgust. ""The two players who will be taking the penalties are Cavani and Neymar,"" Emery told a press conference on Thursday. ""(That is) because they're capable of assuming this responsibility, but other players can take them. ""During training we practice penalties because when the decisive moment arrives and we can win a title with penalties, we will need more than two. ""Last year, the penalty taker was Cavani, this year with the arrival of Neymar there are two. Who is number one and who is number two, I will make that decision."" Despite the furore over the penalty drama, PSG have been in irresistible form and lead reigning champions Monaco by three points at the top of the early table. However, Spaniard Emery may opt to make some changes for the trip to Montpellier with Wednesday's Champions League clash against Bayern Munich in mind. Monaco kick off the weekend action with a trip to Marcelo Bielsa's struggling Lille on Friday. Leonardo Jardim's principality outfit bounced back from a shock 4-0 thrashing at Nice by seeing off Strasbourg 3-0 last week, with Radamel Falcao's brace taking him to nine league goals for the season already. Monaco welcome Porto to the Stade Louis II in the Champions League on Tuesday, but Jardim ruled out making wholesale changes. ""My message doesn't change: the next match is the most important,"" he said. ""It's not possible for a player to save himself for the Champions League. If he does, he could also miss out on that match."" But Lille have had a terrible start to the season after Bielsa's arrival and are on a five-match winless run since beating Nantes in their opening game. The Argentinian coach abruptly resigned as Marseille coach after their first game of the season in 2015, but vehemently insisted there would be no repeat at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. ""I will not resign, I will not give up for any reason,"" the enigmatic Bielsa said. ""The only way for me to stop working here is for me to be dismissed from office, which does not depend on me. ""There is absolutely no possibility that I will give up my post."" On Sunday, Marseille host Toulouse hoping to build on back-to-back wins over Amiens last weekend and against Konyaspor in the Europa League.

627,21/09/2017,19:36,"Tensions between Neymar, Cavani 'normal' says PSG coach",Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery has admitted that tensions mounted in the dressing room at the Parc des Princes last weekend following the penalty dispute between Neymar and Edinson Cavani against Lyon.,"""They are two very competitive players. They want the best for the team first of all, but then they also have individual objectives,"" said Emery at a press conference on Thursday. ""I insist: There is a good atmosphere in the squad. Just after the match it was very emotional, so you can have conversations. People might call them disputes but they are normal and happen after practically every match, in one sense or another. ""But it doesn't break the harmony or the good atmosphere in the team,"" insisted the Spaniard. PSG beat Lyon 2-0 in the Ligue 1 game to make it six wins from six to start the season but the post-match debate was dominated by the penalty incident. PSG were leading 1-0 when they won a spot-kick with 10 minutes remaining for a foul on Kylian Mbappe. Having already scored three times from the spot this season, Cavani assumed the responsibility would once again be his. Neymar tried to get the ball from the Uruguayan but it was Cavani who eventually took it, only to see his effort saved. Emery's inability to designate a clear first-choice penalty taker has led to criticism in some quarters of weak management from the Spaniard. ""Last year, the penalty taker was Cavani. This year, with the arrival of Neymar, there are two. After that, who is number one and who is number two, that is a decision I'll have to take,"" he said on Thursday. There has been talk of tensions in the PSG dressing room between Neymar and his fellow Brazilians on one side and the rest of the squad on the other. Another incident in Sunday's game saw Cavani and Neymar disagree over who should take a free-kick with the match still goalless. Dani Alves intervened to give his compatriot the ball on that occasion, and Neymar's strike was saved. Signed from Juventus in the close season, Alves is already considered a highly influential figure in the Paris dressing room. Sports daily L'Equipe reported that Alves -- a former Barcelona team-mate of Neymar -- organised a dinner for the whole PSG squad at a restaurant in the plush 16th arrondissement of the French capital, near the Arc de Triomphe, on Wednesday evening. But Alves has been slammed by a staunch ally of Cavani. Legendary ex-Uruguay striker Diego Forlan, now 38, called Alves' behaviour at the free-kick ""childish"" in an interview on Spanish radio. ""There was no sense in Dani Alves going and taking the ball. You can't have a third person going to help one guy so the guy who always takes (free-kicks) doesn't,"" Forlan, the top scorer at the 2010 World Cup, told Cadena Cope. ""It's childish. But the Brazilians are friends so they look out for themselves."" Alves, who scored from a free-kick on his competitive debut for PSG against Monaco in the Champions Trophy in July, hit back at Forlan on Twitter. He wrote: ""I don't know what match you saw but for your information I did not take the ball from any teammate. They took it from me!"" ""And also for your information the last free-kick goal scored by PSG was by me...so shut up and stop making a controversy in my name."""
628,18/09/2017,16:28,"PSG win again but tensions simmer between Neymar, Cavani","Paris Saint-Germain kept their perfect start to the season going on Sunday, but the 2-0 win over Lyon also laid bare certain tensions in their all-star front line.","PSG were leading 1-0 at the Parc des Princes when they won a penalty with 10 minutes remaining for a foul on Kylian Mbappe, making his home debut. Having already scored three times from the spot this season, Edinson Cavani assumed the responsibility would once again be his. Neymar tried to get the ball from the Uruguayan but it was Cavani who eventually took it. And his effort was brilliantly saved, Anthony Lopes tipping the ball onto the bar. ""The penalties are taken by a couple of players, one is Cavani and the other is Neymar. There needs to be a gentleman's agreement on the pitch to decide who takes the penalties,"" coach Unai Emery admitted later. ""We will sort things out internally for the next time, because I think they are both capable of taking them, and I want the two of them to mix up who takes them."" Those comments, and the fact Cavani was unsuccessful from the spot, suggests Neymar will get his chance in future. The Brazilian had previously tried and failed to grab the ball from Cavani when a penalty was awarded in the 3-0 win over Saint-Etienne last month. Cavani scored that time. Earlier in Sunday's game, the duo disagreed over who should take a free-kick with the match still goalless. Dani Alves intervened to give his compatriot the ball on that occasion, and Neymar's strike was saved. ""They are two great players. They want to score goals. There are no problems between them, everything is fine,"" insisted PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe. Most coaches would envy the embarrassment of riches at Emery's disposal. The 'MCN' front line of Mbappe, Cavani and Neymar has cost the capital club 466 million euros ($557 million, £411 million) but now the coach has to somehow keep them all happy. Cavani scored a remarkable 49 goals in all competitions last season and already has nine this season -- it would have been 10 had the opener against Lyon not been credited as a Marcelo own goal. But Cavani, who previously lived in the shadow of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, has seen PSG commit the two biggest transfer fees in history to sign Neymar and Mbappe. And 222 million-euro man Neymar has come to Paris to be the main man after spending four years in Lionel Messi's shadow at Barcelona. ""This victory has exposed tensions between Neymar and Cavani,"" said sports daily L'Equipe on its front page on Monday. The 'MCN' scored eight goals between them in their first two matches together against Metz (5-1) and Celtic (5-0), but Sunday was less encouraging. Cavani saw very little of the ball, while Neymar and Mbappe were relatively subdued, even if they combined to force PSG's second on the night, a Jeremy Morel own goal. Julian Draxler, a 40 million-euro signing from Wolfsburg in January, was also shoehorned into the team on Sunday but overloading the side with attacking stars is to the detriment of the overall balance. PSG have not slipped up yet, but Sunday's game showed that Emery has plenty on his plate."
629,18/09/2017,14:54,Mbappe makes winning Parc des Princes debut,Kylian Mbappe played a decisive role on his Parc des Princes debut for Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday in a thrilling 2-0 win over Lyon with both goals accreditated to the visitors.,"Lyon's youngsters proved more than a match for PSG's multi-millionaires who had to wait until the last quarter of an hour before Lyon defender Marcelo deflected the ball into his own goal. Then four minutes from time Mbappe rushed onto Neymar's assist with his close range shot bounding off Jeremy Morel to settle the electric encounter. This sixth successive league win pushed Unai Emery's side three points clear of defending champions Monaco who had maintained their title push with a 3-0 win over Strasbourg 24 hours earlier. Lyon's visit on paper had looked to be PSG's toughest test of the Ligue 1 season so far, and so it proved. Despite their 466 million euro strike force of Neymar, Edinson Cavani and Mbappe seven time former champions Lyon emerged with plenty of honour, if not the three points. PSG were restricted to just a handful of shots in the first period as Lyon's defence doggedly refused to roll over. PSG's best chances came a minute from the break when on a counter attack Mbappe, appearing before his home supporters for the first time after outings at Metz and Celtic, fed Neymar with the Brazilian's rasping shot boxed away by Lyon keeper Anthony Lopes. On the restart Mbappe was switched to take Neymar's place on the right. The second half was only minutes old when Lyon striker Nabil Fekir troubled PSG keeper Alphonse Aerola with a tight-angled shot. On 55 minutes Neymar, brought down outside the box by Fekir, flicked the ensuing freekick over the wall only for a diving Lopes to parry the ball away from the top far corner. The PSG crowd then had its collective heart in its mouth as Lyon launched attack after attack on Aerola in the home goal in a thrilling passage of play. PSG captain Thiago Silva had to use his head to stop Lucas Tousart's header, then seconds later Tanguy Ndombele unleashed a superb strike from 30m which had sparks flying off the crossbar. On 72 minutes Emery introduced Giovani Lo Celso for Julian Draxler, and the move proved decisive when Lo Celso crossed from the left with Cavani nudging the ball towards goal with the outside of his foot before its deflection off Lyon defender Marcelo. Lopes then did brilliantly to save a Cavani penalty awarded after Ferland Mendy had felled Mbappe. Cavani struck the spot kick low and left with Lopes' intervention sending it ricocheting off the upright and to safety. With four minutes remaining and Lyon looking for a deserved equaliser Neymar passed to Mbappe with the 18-year-old Monaco recruit's close range shot hitting Lopes and bouncing off Morel into the Lyon goal. Lyon, losing for the first time this season, left Parc des Princes in fifth place, eight points adrift of the leaders. Lyon coach Bruno Genesio reflected: ""I don't think there's a club in France that can compete with PSG for the title, but for one match, yes."" Earlier a sizzling Mario Balotelli strike ten minutes from time gave Nice a 1-0 win at Rennes and Marseille pulled out of an early season slump when a Clinton Njie brace gave the ambitious southerners a 2-0 win at Amiens. On Saturday a revitalised Radamel Falcao grabbed a brace in Monaco's 3-0 win over Strasbourg and Saint-Etienne moved up to third with a 1-0 win over Dijon. Nantes continued their good form under Claudio Ranieri, as they beat Caen 1-0 to make it four games unbeaten without conceding a goal while Bordeaux stayed unbeaten with a 1-0 victory at Toulouse."

""In this recording the player makes uncalled for gestures aimed at the France national manager,"" a source disclosed. When the plotters approached 25-year-old Kurzawa he contacted the police, who set in train a sting operation.

632,15/09/2017,16:40,Ben Arfa back training with PSG first team,"France international forward Hatem Ben Arfa was back training with the Paris Saint-Germain first team on Friday following a spell banished to the reserves, coach Unai Emery confirmed.","""He was welcomed into the group,"" said Emery in his pre-match press conference ahead of Sunday's Ligue 1 clash with Lyon. ""He did several training sessions with the reserves but today he trained with us."" Ben Arfa, 30, had found himself out in the cold having fallen out of favour under Emery since both joined the club last season. PSG had tried to offload Ben Arfa during the close season without success as his high salary put off potential suitors. He was left out of PSG's Champions League squad while his hopes of forcing Emery into a rethink took a hit by the mega-money signings of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe in August. With the departure of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Manchester United, Ben Arfa was PSG's marquee signing just over a year ago following a stellar campaign with Nice that saw him rebuild his faltering career after several unsuccessful years in England. But his PSG dream soon turned sour and he was left in limbo as Emery made clear before the season began that he didn't want the temperamental former Lyon and Marseille player. Ben Arfa's lawyer had threatened to take PSG to court after his client was banished to the reserves, who play in the French fourth tier. But on Friday, PSG published pictures of Ben Arfa training with the first team on their official website."
633,15/09/2017,01:50,PSG's 'MCN' turn focus back to domestic action,"Paris Saint-Germain and their fearsome attacking trio of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani host Lyon on Sunday looking to make it six successive wins to kick off the Ligue 1 season.","The expensively-assembled frontline, dubbed 'MCN', starred in PSG's 5-0 humbling of Celtic in the Champions League on Tuesday, in a match where they were irresistible for long periods. The capital club's long-held ambition has been to lift the European Cup, but now their attentions turn back to domestic matters, as they look to increase an early three-point lead over defending champions Monaco at the top of the table. The 18-year-old Mbappe, who will become the world's second-most expensive player ever at the end of his season-long loan from Monaco, scored on his debut last week in a 5-1 thrashing of Metz, with Cavani and Neymar also on the scoresheet. The trio all netted in the first 40 minutes of the midweek game in Glasgow, meaning they have scored eight goals between them in the two matches they have played together. ""I'm very happy, it was a very good match, it was very important to win and playing with great players is always a pleasure,"" said Neymar after his PSG Champions League debut. ""Mbappe is one of them, and he still has a lot of room for improvement."" Sunday's match on paper is PSG's biggest test of the league season so far, with an unbeaten Lyon going to Paris off the back of a 1-1 Europa League draw with Apollon Limassol in Cyprus. But Unai Emery's side are on a 35-match unbeaten streak at home in all competitions, having not lost at the Parc des Princes since a 2-0 defeat by Monaco in March 2016. Worryingly for their Ligue 1 and European rivals, the Spanish coach believes that his team will only get better after the thrashing of Celtic. ""They have only played a few games together,"" Emery said. ""But the key is that the team is going to improve more and more. ""Of course we have added to the team but it is more about all the people working together. As far as this is concerned I am really, really happy."" Reigning champions Monaco suffered a 4-0 humbling at Nice last time out, before putting in a vastly-improved display during a 1-1 midweek Champions League draw at RB Leipzig. The thumping by their Cote d'Azur rivals ended a Ligue 1 record of 16 consecutive wins for Leonardo Jardim's men, although they did lose 4-0 at Nice last September before going on to win the title. The principality outfit will be fully expecting to get back to winning ways when they welcome newly-promoted Strasbourg to the Stade Louis II on Saturday, despite having goalkeeper Danijel Subasic and winger Thomas Lemar ruled out through injury. Bordeaux, one of four unbeaten teams in the French top flight after the first five games, kick off the weekend action at Toulouse on Friday. Marcelo Bielsa's Lille travel to Guingamp looking to end a winless streak of four matches that has put an expected revival under the enigmatic Argentinian coach on hold. Nantes have fared better under their new coach Claudio Ranieri, with the Italian's men hosting Caen having not conceded a goal in three matches that have produced two wins and a draw.

634,13/09/2017,09:08,Emery warns five-star PSG can only get better,Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) coach Unai Emery says his side have learned lessons from the past after they started their Champions League Group B campaign with a 5-0 thrashing of Celtic.,"Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, Edinson Cavani's double and a Mikel Lustig own goal consigned Celtic to their record home European defeat and propelled PSG to the top of the table on goal difference from Bayern Munich, who they host on match day two. It was a real statement of intent from this summer's big spenders who signed Brazilian Neymar and teenage sensation Mbappe in a bid to make a real impression on the competition. After four consecutive seasons of reaching the quarter-finals, PSG fell at the round of 16 last season when they capitulated against Barcelona after winning the first leg 4-0. It was a result that convinced their Qatari owners to break the world transfer record to bring Neymar to the French capital. The 6-1 defeat to the Catalan giants in the second leg was a humbling for PSG but Emery says they are approaching this season's campaign with a renewed confidence. ""We did learn from the past and what happened last year. We have worked really hard to improve things within the team,"" the Spanish coach said. ""I think my team showed a lot of character. What I was really pleased with was the fact we were in control with the ball and without the ball. ""Of course we have added to the team but it is more about all the people working together. As far as this is concerned I am really, really happy."" The French side's formidable front line terrorised the Celtic defence and Emery warned they would only get better. The PSG coach singled out Mbappe, who PSG have an option to buy from Monaco for a fee that could reach 180 million Euros, for praise. ""This is what he needs at the moment. He wants to be a great player and he is going to grow up into that role,"" Emery said of the 18-year-old who scored his second goal in two games. ""They have only played a few games together... but the key is that the team is going to improve more and more."" Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers said his side, who conceded five at home for the first time since Rangers beat them 5-1 in September 1960, said his side weren't at the same level of the French superstars. ""You have to give credit to them. They are a really special team and they are going to be close to winning it for sure,"" the Northern Irishman said. ""This is a level where you have to look after the ball, and you have to make the ball work for you, and in the first half we didn't do that."""
635,12/09/2017,23:07,'MCN' lead five-star PSG past hapless Celtic,"Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani all scored as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League campaign with a 5-0 thrashing of Celtic in Glasgow on Tuesday.","Brazilian Neymar continued to pay back his 222 million-euro ($264 million) world record transfer fee with his fifth goal in five games to put PSG in front before he set up Mbappe to make it 2-0. Edinson Cavani then converted from the penalty spot five minutes before the break after the Uruguayan striker had been pulled down by Jozo Simunovic. Things got worse for Celtic in the second half as Mikael Lustig's 83rd-minute own goal and Cavani's angled header two minutes later heaped more misery on the Scottish champions, who could yet find themselves in trouble with UEFA after a fan managed to make his way onto the pitch to aim a kick at Mbappe during the first half. The emphatic win propels PSG to the top of Group B on goal difference from Bayern Munich, who beat Anderlecht 3-0 and who the French side host in a fortnight. The nature of the victory was also a real statement of intent from this summer's big spenders who are determined to make a bigger impression than ever before on Europe's elite club competition. Following last season's collapse to Barcelona in the last 16 -- a tie in which Neymar starred for the Catalan giants -- this European campaign was always going to be about a test of PSG's mettle rather than their flair. However, the French side's superstars -- and in particular their front three, who have been quickly christened the 'MCN' in France -- showed no signs of fear inside the intimidating atmosphere of Celtic Park as the gulf in class between the sides showed from the start. PSG's pressure soon paid off but Neymar's opener wasn't without controversy. Celtic felt they should have had a free-kick in the PSG half after Scott Sinclair went down but the visitors took full advantage as Adrian Rabiot's quickly-played ball behind Anthony Ralston found the Brazilian who expertly lifted the ball over Craig Gordon. Paris coach Unai Emery had identified Leigh Griffiths as the danger man for Celtic before the game and the Scottish striker came close to grabbing an equaliser minutes later when his curling free-kick was tipped over by Alphonse Areola. Mbappe then showed why PSG are prepared to make him the world's second-most expensive player when he grabbed his second goal in two games since joining on a season-long loan from Monaco. Neymar's headed ball across goal was missed by Cavani but the 18-year-old, who PSG have an option to buy for a fee that could reach 180 million euros, pounced to smash the ball past Gordon. A moment of madness from Celtic allowed the French side to add to their advantage before the break as Simunovic needlessly pulled back Cavani as a cross came in from the visitors' left. The Uruguayan took the spot-kick himself and sent Gordon the wrong way to lift the ball high into the net. Celtic improved after the break as PSG took their foot off the gas but two late goals helped put a greater shine on the victory for the visitors and left the Scottish giants with their biggest ever home loss in Europe. Lustig scored an own goal after substitute Julian Draxler drilled the ball across goal before Cavani rose at the back post to send a sublime angled header past Gordon from Layvin Kurzawa's cross."

Spanish clubs have dominated the competition in recent seasons. Madrid have lifted the trophy in three of the last four years with that run only interrupted by Barcelona's success in 2015. However, that dominance has been put under threat by the riches of not only PSG, but a Premier League resurgence with England boasting five teams in the group stage for the first time. PSG will be assured a red hot atmosphere to begin their European campaign at Celtic with the Scottish champions looking to spring an almighty upset. However, it is German champions Bayern Munich, who start at home to Anderlecht, who will provide an early test of PSG's title credentials in the battle to top Group B. Neymar's departure provoked a summer of institutional chaos at Barcelona with a public split between the club's beleaguered board and leading figures in the dressing room. Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu has claimed the Catalans will have a ""more competitive"" side this season than last despite losing Neymar after splashing out a fee that could rise to 145 million euros on 20-year-old French winger Ousmane Dembele to replace the Brazilian. Dembele impressed in a cameo appearance as a substitute on his debut with an assist for Luis Suarez as Barca thrashed Espanyol 5-0 on Saturday. However, Bartomeu's theory will be put under the spotlight straight away with the visit of Juventus, who dumped Barca out at the quarter-final stage 3-0 on aggregate last season. Real shouldn't be troubled as they begin their defence of the competition at home to Cypriots APOEL Nicosia on Wednesday. Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool have the toughest tasks of England's five-strong contingent looking to reassert the cash-rich Premier League on the European stage after several years of disappointing results in the Champions League. Spurs are looking to end their Wembley hoodoo against Borussia Dortmund in a clash that will go a long way to deciding who will be Real's closest challengers in Group H. Mauricio Pochettino's men have won just one of their last 11 outings at their temporary home before moving into a new stadium next season. Dortmund, though, have bitter memories of Wembley themselves having lost the Champions League final in 2013 there to rivals Bayern. Fresh from a 5-0 hammering at the hands of Manchester City, Liverpool are seeking revenge for their defeat to Sevilla in the 2016 Europa League final when Champions League football returns to Anfield for the first time in three years. Jose Mourinho also leads Manchester United back into European football's premier club competition at home to Basel. City travel to Feyenoord for the Dutch champions' return to the Champions League for the first time since 2001, whilst Chelsea host Azerbaijani newcomers Qarabag. Chelsea face stiff competition to make the knockout stages with Atletico Madrid and Roma making up Group C. Atletico travel to the Italian capital on Tuesday to begin their latest attempt at finally landing the Champions League having fallen to cross city rivals Real in the final stages of each of the past four seasons. Two of the revelations of European football last season go head-to-head in Group G as Leipzig welcome Monaco on their Champions League debut. Backed by energy drinks giant Red Bull, Leipzig emerged as Bayern's closest challengers in Germany. Unlike Monaco, who have raked in over 300 million euros in transfer fees for Mbappe, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva, Leipzig have maintained their young core in Liverpool-bound Naby Keita, Emil Forsberg and Timo Werner."

Mbappe completed a move to PSG last Thursday on an initial season-long loan as part on agreement that includes an option to buy the teenager for 180 million euros ($215 million). ""I discussed it in depth with my family and I took the decision to join PSG,"" said Mbappe, who comes from the Paris suburbs. He insisted he had not fallen out with the Monaco ownership and praised the club's vice president Vadim Vasilyev, but told reporters: ""There were some things that happened that I will talk about, you'll hear soon."" Mbappe, speaking as he was officially unveiled at the Parc des Princes, said it had been vital for him to stay in France despite strong interest from Real Madrid. ""It's a great pleasure to join this club, it's one of the best in the world,"" said Mbappe. ""It's extremely ambitious and wants to become the best. ""It's putting everything in place to make that goal more than possible and that's important to me. ""It was also important to not leave France after just six months playing at the top level, and it was important to return to the city where I was born and where I grew up."" Mbappe's arrival in the capital follows the world-record signing of Neymar from Barcelona, and the Frenchman is eager to continue his development alongside a highly accomplished cast of players. ""I come into the dressing room with the smallest prize list. These are players who for the most part have won everything already, it's going to be a rewarding experience. I have a lot to learn and a lot to prove."" After splashing out 222 million euros for Neymar, PSG concluded a complicated deal for Mbappe which prompted UEFA to announce a day later that it was looking into whether the club had broken financial fair play rules. But for Mbappe, whose transfer fee could rise to 180 million euros with add-ons, the eye-catching figures are far from his concern. ""For me, the price is what it is, it's not going to change my way of playing and it's not something that's going to worry me,"" he said. ""On the contrary, I think playing with these players is going to free me."""

""We are very confident in our position and in our recruitment,"" he told a press conference. ""UEFA can do as it wishes, but we have done everything in a transparent way. We haven't hidden anything and we don't need to hide anything."" PSG, owned by Qatar sovereign wealth fund QSI, broke the world transfer record to pay 222 million euros ($264 million) for Brazilian superstar Neymar in August before signing Mbappe on loan with an option to buy the 18-year-old from Monaco for up to 180 million euros in the second largest deal in history. The massive outlay sparked complaints from clubs in Spain and Germany that they were competing with a state-backed entity. The president of Spain's La Liga, Javier Tebas, said Wednesday PSG were ""laughing at the system"". UEFA announced Friday it was looking into whether PSG had broken the FFP rules that are designed to prevent clubs spending more than they earn. Al-Khelaifi said: ""We respect all of FIFA and UEFA's rules. It's not our problem if other clubs aren't happy. ""My concern is that we achieve our aims."" In a reference to the complicated deal that brought Mbappe to PSG from Monaco, the striker thanked his lawyers ""who have given themselves a bit of a headache recently, but for a good cause"". Mbappe said that at the end of last season he had decided to stay with Monaco, ""but certain events happened which made me change my mind"". ""I discussed in depth with my family and I took the decision to join PSG,"" said the teenager who comes from the Paris suburbs. He insisted he had not fallen out with the Monaco ownership and praised the club's vice president Vadim Vasilyev, but told reporters: ""There were some things that happened that I will talk about, you'll hear soon."""
639,05/09/2017,23:26,Neymar: Barça president a 'joke',"Neymar labelled Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu a ""joke"" as the war of wards between Barcelona's beleaguered board and the Brazilian star continued on Tuesday.","In interviews with Catalan newspapers Mundo Deportivo and Sport, Bartomeu claimed Barca would be better off without Neymar this season following his world record 222 million euro ($263.7 million) move to Paris Saint-Germain. With Bartomeu's handling of Barca's haphazard transfer policy being heavily criticised, he described the loss of Neymar as an ""opportunity"" for Barca to rebuild their midfield rather than pile resources into a superstar front three of Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. ""The trident was very good but it had its consequences,"" Bartomeu told Sport. ""It is an opportunity to return to the collective football in the middle of the field, which traditionally was Barca's strength. ""It is an opportunity, with a new coach, a new project. We need to stop being pessimistic!"" Bartomeu also criticised Neymar and his father and agent Neymar Sr's exit strategy. ""This president is a joke,"" Neymar replied in a comment about the news on social media site Instagram. A vote of no confidence motion has been launched by former Barca presidential candidate Agusti Benedito that could oust Bartomeu if it receives enough support from the club's members in the coming weeks. Neymar's departure sparked a shopping spree from Barca, who landed 20-year-old French winger Ousmane Dembele for an initial 105 million euro fee from Borussia Dortmund and Paulinho for 40 million from Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande. However, Barca missed out on a host of other targets, including Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho, blaming the rampant inflation in the transfer market caused by PSG and Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City. La Liga has asked UEFA to investigate both PSG and City for breaches of financial fair play rules. ""Qatar and Abu Dhabi are two countries that have two clubs,"" added Bartomeu. ""If Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Real Madrid or Arsenal buy a player from you, you know (the money) comes from football. ""But these two clubs distort the market."" Bartomeu also insisted a four-year contract extension for Lionel Messi has been signed by the player's agent and father, Jorge Horacio Messi. Barca announced an agreement with the five-time World Player of the Year in July, but Messi himself is yet to put pen to paper amid rumours he is unhappy with the running of the club. Messi's current deal expires in 2018 meaning he could leave Barca for free next summer. ""It is all agreed and signed,"" Bartomeu added. ""There are three contracts: one with Messi's foundation, that is signed by the president of the foundation and the player's brother; a contract with Leo Messi's image rights, that his father and administrator of his company have signed; and the work contract that Leo's father has signed."""
640,04/09/2017,19:56,Monaco question Mbappe deal,"Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev has questioned Kylain Mbappe's loan to Paris Saint-Germain in a move he calls ""the most successful in world football"".","The 18-year-old striker moved to PSG last Thursday in a season-long loan deal with a 180 million euro buy-out clause attached, making him the second most expensive player of all time behind new teammate Neymar. ""We (Monaco) could not understand to the very end whether this deal was really possible as UEFA had questions to PSG about their compliance with financial fair-play,"" Vasilyev told Russian news agency TASS. ""It was a very tough deal,"" he added. ""Initially, we did not want the footballer to strengthen our opponents. ""But I think this deal appears to be the most successful one in the world of football."" PSG secured Mbappe less than a month after signing Brazilian superstar Neymar from Barcelona in a world record 222 million euro ($264 million) deal. Last week Europe's football ruling body UEFA opened a ""formal investigation"" into PSG's dealings over the transfer window. UEFA said it would look at whether PSG had violated the financial fair play regulations ""in light of its recent transfer activity"". UEFA president Alexsander Ceferin insisted on Monday that ""Nobody is above the law"". The Slovenian, speaking to the European Clubs Association in Geneva, added: ""UEFA is at your side to ensure that the participants in our competitions are all treated equally. ""Financial fair play is a tremendous success because it has enabled clubs to reduce their losses drastically and adopt an economic model that is viable for the long term. ""Nevertheless, UEFA's credibility and that of football rests on us ensuring that the rules that are in force are respected."""
641,03/09/2017,14:10,How will PSG get around FFP rules?,"After spending 380 million euros ($450.66m) to secure the services of Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, Paris Saint-Germain's next task is to make sure they don't break UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules.","European football's governing body opened an investigation into PSG's lavish spending on Friday, having previously sanctioned the club in 2014 for FFP violations. PSG, who made Neymar and Mbappe the two most expensive players of all-time, responded by saying they expect a ""rise of 20 to 40 percent"" in revenues from ""international income, sponsoring, merchandising, ticket sales, TV rights, sporting results and summer and winter tours"". The club need to increase their estimated annual turnover of 520 million euros by somewhere between 105 and 210 million to comply with FFP, and there are plenty of ways they can do it. FFP rules dictate that a club cannot make an annual loss of more than 30 million euros, and an obvious way for PSG to avoid this will be to ship off some dead wood from their squad in the January transfer window. After their summer acquisitions, there are some highly-valued players who coach Unai Emery will probably find surplus to requirements. The website Transfermarkt values PSG's squad at more than 520 million euros, but as the signings of Neymar and Mbappe show, that is almost certainly an underestimate. Forwards Javier Pastore, signed in 2011 for 42m euros, Lucas Moura (40m euros) and Angel Di Maria (63m euros) are all unlikely to have a regular starting place. Neymar and Mbappe, 18, are both all but certain to start the big games alongside Edinson Cavani, and with Julian Draxler next in line, PSG could easily recoup some cash by selling Pastore, Lucas and Di Maria. One of the biggest reasons for shelling out a world record 222 million euros on Neymar was because of the Brazilian's marketability. PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi said after the 25-year-old's move that he would be worth 450 million euros ""soon"". PSG's current deals with kit manufacturer Nike and shirt sponsor Emirates airlines (an estimated annual 40m euros) are far from the dizzying heights enjoyed by the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid. Barcelona receive at least 150 million euros annually from Nike for the privilege of making their jerseys, while English giants Manchester United are paid 67 million euros a year by Chevrolet in a shirt-sponsorship deal. The scope is clearly there for PSG to find a far more financially-attractive deal after Neymar's signing, which could potentially wipe out any FFP fears in one swoop. Qatar Sports Investments have always wanted to win the Champions League since taking over PSG, and one way to avoid FFP sanctions would be to achieve just that. With TV rights for Europe's premier competition at an all-time high, reaching the final for the first time could pay out more than 100 million euros. Retaking the Ligue 1 title from Monaco would also help, while the French top flight's international TV rights will have gone up in value after the Neymar signing. The French league's (LFP) international rights were sold for just 80 million euros annually for 2018-2024, compared to 700m euros for La Liga and one billion euros for the Premier League. ""At a domestic level, the LFP is even more likely to reach or exceed an annual figure of one billion euros,"" according to French economist Jean-Pascal Gayant. PSG have plenty of cards to play, and if the 145 million-euro fee for Mbappe (before add-ons) is judged to come under expenditure for next season after his season-long loan deal from Monaco, then they might not have too much to worry about anyway."
642,01/09/2017,19:37,"UEFA probes PSG after Neymar, Mbappe deals","UEFA opened a ""formal investigation"" into Paris Saint-Germain on Friday after the French club broke the world transfer record to sign Neymar.","European football's governing body said it would look at whether PSG had violated its Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. ""The investigation will focus on the compliance of the club with the break-even requirement, particularly in light of its recent transfer activity,"" UEFA said in a statement. PSG signed Brazilian striker Neymar for a world-record 222 million euros ($264 million) on August 3 and completed a loan move for Kylian Mbappe on Thursday in a deal that includes an option to buy the French teenager for 180 million euros. ""In the coming months, the Investigatory Chamber of the UEFA Club Financial Control Body will regularly meet in order to carefully evaluate all documentation pertaining to this case,"" the statement added. ""UEFA considers Financial Fair Play to be a crucial governance mechanism which aims to ensure the financial sustainability of European club football."" The FFP system was first approved by UEFA in 2010 to try and combat soaring debts in the game. From 2013 to 2015 clubs could only post a net total loss of 45 million euros, which was reduced to 30 million for the next three years, running until 2018. Non-compliance with the rules can result in a series of disciplinary measures, ranging from a warning to the deduction of points, and even exclusion from European competition. PSG have already incurred sanctions for a previous violation and were slapped with a 60-million-euro fine, 40 million of which suspended, in 2014, and saw their squad for the Champions League cut from 25 to 21 players."
643,31/08/2017,14:08,Spurs complete deal for PSG's Aurier,"Ivorian right-back Serge Aurier has joined Tottenham Hotspur from Paris Saint-Germain on a five-year contract, the two clubs announced on Thursday.","Spurs are reported to have paid PSG around £23 million ($29.6 million, 25 million euros) to sign the 24-year-old, who won two Ligue 1 titles during his three years in Paris. The deal was held up as Spurs' request for a work permit was complicated by the suspended two-month prison sentence Aurier was given after an assault on a police officer outside a Paris nightclub in May 2016. ""This is a huge and exciting opportunity at a massive football club and I am determined to prove myself as a professional both on and off the pitch,"" Aurier said in comments published on the Spurs website. ""This is a fresh start for me and I will do everything to make the Spurs fanbase, which is huge and diverse, proud of me. ""The fans are the most important people at any club and I am looking forward to showing them and everyone at Spurs the real Serge Aurier."" Aurier's conviction for elbowing a police officer meant he was barred from entering the United Kingdom by the British authorities for PSG's Champions League game against Arsenal last November. His reference to Spurs' ""diverse"" fanbase was a pointed one as he was suspended by PSG last year for making a homophobic slur against former coach Laurent Blanc in a social media video. Aurier, capped 40 times by Ivory Coast, began his career with French club Lens and spent two and a half seasons at Toulouse before joining PSG in January 2014. During his time at Parc des Princes, he also won three French Cups and three French League Cups. At Spurs he will fill the void left by England right-back Kyle Walker's £45 million move to Manchester City. He can also play at centre-back. Aurier is Spurs' fourth acquisition of the transfer window after Davinson Sanchez, a club-record £42 million recruit from Ajax, back-up goalkeeper Paulo Gazzanigga and Argentinian youngster Juan Foyth."
644,28/08/2017,03:01,Mbappe on verge of stunning PSG move,"Monaco's teen sensation Kylian Mbappe is expected to complete a stunning move to Paris Saint-Germain when he flies into the French capital on Monday, according to widespread French media reports Sunday.","Radio stations France Info and RMC reported that PSG had agreed to pay 180 million euros ($215 million) including bonuses for the 18-year-old French international striker. That would make him the second most expensive transfer in football history behind Neymar, who joined PSG from Barcelona for 222 million euros earlier this month. However, concerns over meeting UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) obligations mean PSG could initially sign Mbappe on loan, according to sports daily L'Equipe. ""Monaco and PSG on Sunday reached an agreement for a loan move for Kylian Mbappe to the Parisian club with an option to buy for 180 million euros,"" said L'Equipe, adding that Mbappe would undergo a medical by Monday morning. Mbappe is due to leave the principality on Monday morning along with Monaco winger Thomas Lemar and fly to Paris on his way to teaming up with the French national squad. France will play a World Cup qualifier against the Netherlands at the Stade de France on Thursday and a game against Luxembourg in Toulouse next weekend. France coach Didier Deschamps insisted last week when he named his squad that no player would be allowed to leave the national team camp at Clairefontaine, around 50 kilometres south of Paris, to complete a transfer. With the transfer window closing on Thursday, that means Mbappe is set to complete the move on Monday, allowing him to team up with Neymar and Edinson Cavani in a mouthwatering PSG attack after the international break. After being left out of the Monaco squad last week, Mbappe was an unused substitute for Sunday night's game against Marseille as the reigning French champions won 6-1. That saw them join PSG at the top of the Ligue 1 table with four wins from four games at the start of the season. Asked after the game about Mbappe's expected departure, Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim said: ""I am not confirming anything. It is not my role to discuss that. My role is on the field. ""He is a Monaco player. That is why he was on the bench. But after it went 4-0 I didn't need him. The club's project is to bring through the best players."" Mbappe was outstanding in the second half of last season but he has not played in any of Monaco's last three games as they extended their record winning run to 16 league games. ""Kylian is a star and a top-level player. But for six months last year we often played without him and won,"" added Jardim. Mbappe refused to speak to French television at the end of Sunday's game. Also targeted by Real Madrid this summer, a move for Mbappe to PSG will leave many wondering how the Qatar-owned club can avoid sanctions from European football's governing body considering the investment already made on Neymar. FFP rules currently stipulate that clubs cannot post losses of more than 30 million euros over the three-year period to 2018. Among the sanctions risked by PSG if they are found to have broken those rules is a ban from the Champions League. Mbappe burst onto the scene in the second half of last season and scored 15 goals in 29 appearances in Monaco's run to the French title. He netted 26 times in 44 matches in all competitions. Brought up in the northern suburbs of Paris, Mbappe was compared to a young Thierry Henry as he first broke into the Monaco side in December 2015, just before his 17th birthday. He has won four caps for France."

""After first giving up his No.10 shirt, will he (Pastore) now give him (Neymar) his place in the team,"" one Le Parisien headline asked of the player who took up the No.10 shirt after Zlatan Ibrahimovic left last season, only to hand it to the Brazilian this season. ""Neymar will start on the left at the cost of Pastore,"" the article claimed. ""So it'll be Neymar, (Edinson) Cavani and without doubt (Angel) di Maria in a three pronged attack,"" said Le Parisien, which then gave a long list of top signings who will be warming the PSG bench. Alongside Pastore will be the Brazilian Lucas Moura, who is rumoured to be staying as he has been friends with Neymar since the age of nine, and Germany captain at the Confederations Cup Julian Draxler, who arrived just last year in a big money transfer of his own. Sports daily L'Equipe saw things differently, though. ""Neymar - the football version,"" ran their headline in a joke about how the most expensive transfer in football history has dominated news without the 25-year-old forward even kicking a ball yet. ""A trio of Neymar, Pastore and di Maria will support Cavani,"" they predicted, but were unsure where the extra man would be cut. In the tiny Brittany town of Guingamp, with a population of around 7,000, tickets for the match have been changing hands for a king's ransom as the Stade du Roduourou has a capacity of just over 15,000. ""We could have filled a stadium of 40,000 seats with no problem at all,"" Guingamp president Bertrand Desplat told local newspaper Le Telegramme. ""Remember the star of the show is going to be Neymar and for us we want to welcome this very special player and his team in the best conditions possible,"" he said. Journalists however may find themselves a bit squeezed for space as the rustic press tribune allowing for 80 press seats has been extended to a blockbuster 350."

653,05/08/2017,17:02,Neymar deal makes financial sense - PSG chief,"Neymar's world record 222 million euro ($264 million) transfer fee may look expensive, but it will end up earning a great deal of money for Paris Saint-Germain, club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi insisted Saturday.","Neymar, 25, is among the world's finest players and will help the ambitious Ligue 1 club gain the success it craves in Europe. But the eye-popping fee left many experts divided over whether it was good business or a risky financial gamble. ""I don't think it's expensive, I'm convinced we are going to earn more money with him. It's a project of two brands: we're associating the Neymar brand and the PSG brand,"" Al-Khelaifi said. And the incredible commercial potential of the former Barcelona star was visible after his first day at the club, with a rush on PSG shops on the Champs-Elysees and Parc des Princes to purchase his coveted number 10 jersey. The French club had already clawed back around a million euros on their world-record investment in just one day thanks to selling a staggering 10,000 shirts bearing the Brazilian's name, costing 140 euros each. The club are also expected to sell a further 15,000 Neymar shirts on Saturday, when he was presented to the fans at the Parc des Princes ahead of their Ligue 1 opener against Amiens. The merging of the brands appears to have commercial potential too. PSG deputy managing director Frederic Longuepee told AFP that the club was valued at 1 billion euros and has ""200 million fans around the world"". As for the Neymar brand, the player has 30 million Twitter followers, 60 million on Facebook and a whopping 78 million on Instagram -- second only to Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo. ""With Neymar, PSG will sell a great deal of shirts and have all kinds of commercial partnerships in France and around the world, but it is difficult to measure how much,"" Jean-Pascal Gayant, Professor of Economics at the University of Le Mans, told AFP. Gayant believes that while the transfer fee may look ""risky"", the club would swiftly renegotiate its existing commercial and sponsorship contracts to benefit from the Neymar effect. ""There are not two Neymars in the world. I would love for us to meet in two years and see what his value will be compared to today. At least double,"" boasted Al-Khelaifi. Pundits in England suggest part of the transfer fee gold rush is fuelled by a belief prices will indeed rise sharply, but not everyone agrees. ""Not much surprises me anymore, but 400 million (euros) would do the trick. In sporting terms, physically he is at his peak value now, in our way of calculating a player's value. The optimum is around 26 or 27-years-old (he's 25),"" said Loic Ravenel, a researcher with the Football Observatory. ""Over the next five years his value will rise but, maybe not to those summits,"" he told AFP of Al-Khelaifi's predictions. And the Football Observatory estimated Neymar's value using their algorithm -- which they can apply to any footballer in Europe -- at 210.7 million euros. ""The most added value would be with (Kylian) Mbappe, (Paul) Pogba, or (Anthony) Martial, players at 21-22 (18, 24 and 21 in fact), and who can still be resold at 26, which is the case in point with Neymar,"" the expert insisted. ""But maybe by then another young footballer may have come along and replaced him, maybe someone even better, attracting the media and the sponsors."" Former Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa, now with French side Lille, believes Neymar is value for money. ""If one considers what he brings or produces nothing that is invested is exaggerated. According to this logic, Neymar is not expensive,"" said Bielsa. Former Barcelona vice-president Marc Ingla hailed Neymar's signing as a new dawn for the French league. ""It's exciting, it's very good news for French football,"" said Spaniard Ingla, now director general at Lille. ""I have great belief in Ligue 1 and its ability to produce great talents. For me, France is like the Brazil of Europe. Neymar is an accelerator of the image of Ligue 1 which he can bring to wider television audiences."" On the pitch, PSG are hoping Neymar can help them win back the Ligue 1 title they lost to Monaco last season, and also finally get their hands on the Champions League trophy."
654,05/08/2017,00:32,Neymar prepares for 'bigger challenge' at PSG,"Neymar was unveiled as a Paris Saint-Germain player on Friday following his sensational world record transfer saying he had left Barcelona not for money but a ""bigger challenge"" in France.","The 25-year-old Brazilian superstar flew into Le Bourget airport, north-east of Paris, in a private jet on Friday morning before heading into the city in a motorcade. He was presented to the international media at PSG's Parc des Princes stadium just after 1:30pm (1130 GMT) in his first public appearance since buying out his contract at Barcelona for a world-record 222 million euros ($264 million) on Thursday. ""I want something bigger, a greater challenge. I am here to give my best and help the club win titles,"" said Neymar, who has signed a five-year contract with the Qatar-owned club expected to be worth 30 million euros net per year. He insisted he had come to France ""for the ambition of the club, which is very similar to mine."" But Neymar admitted that leaving Barcelona, where he formed part of a lethal attacking trio with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, was not a decision he took lightly. ""It was one of my most difficult decisions. In Barcelona I had adapted well to the city and the team. I had friends there and it has not been easy,"" he said. ""It was a tense time, thinking about what I should do in my life. I have left behind a lot of friends, but things go very fast in football."" Neymar will be presented to the PSG support on Saturday prior to his new team's first game of the Ligue 1 season against promoted Amiens. A ceremony will begin from 3:45pm (1345 GMT) with the kick-off put back quarter of an hour to 5:15pm to allow extra time for the player's unveiling before an expected sell-out crowd of more than 45,000. Neymar got a taste of what is to come when he stepped outside the Parc des Princes on Friday in his new team's kit, to be greeted by hundreds of ecstatic supporters. However, Neymar, whose last game for Barcelona was in a friendly against bitter rivals Real Madrid last weekend in Miami, will not be able to make his debut against Amiens. A French league spokesman said that the Brazilian's international transfer certificate (CIT) had failed to be lodged by the midnight deadline on Friday so he will watch the game from the stands instead. At 30 million euros a year, Neymar will be the second highest-paid player in the world -- behind Carlos Tevez and his 38 million euros a year at Shanghai Shenhua in China but ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo's 23.6 million euros annual salary at Real Madrid. The transfer fee shatters the previous world record of 105 million euros set by Manchester United in signing France midfielder Paul Pogba last year from Juventus. It is an eye-watering sum, but one that PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi insisted will eventually look like a bargain for the player who came third in the Ballon d'Or in 2015 behind Messi and Ronaldo. ""There are not two Neymars in the world. I would love for us to meet in two years and see what his value will be compared to today. At least the double,"" said Al-Khelaifi. There is scepticism at the role played by PSG's owners Oryx Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) at a time of political crisis for the energy-rich state which has been boycotted by its Gulf neighbours in recent months and will play host to the World Cup in 2022. But the impact of Neymar's arrival could be seen early on Friday morning on the Champs Elysees in Paris, where more than 1,000 fans queued outside a club superstore in order to get their hands on a PSG shirt with Neymar's name and number on the back. And on the field PSG are hoping Neymar, who will wear the number 10 shirt vacated a year ago by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, can help them win back the Ligue 1 title lost to Monaco last season, and also finally get their hands on the Champions League trophy. Meanwhile, there was still bitterness in Spain over the player's exit with Barcelona insisting they won't pay a 26 million euro ($30.8 million) bonus to Neymar for renewing his contract with the Catalan giants in 2016."
655,04/08/2017,23:16,"PSG sell 10,000 Neymar shirts on first day","Neymar started repaying his mammoth transfer fee on the day he was introduced as Paris Saint-Germain's marquee summer signing with the club selling more than 10,000 shirts bearing his name on Friday.","The 25-year-old Brazilian was signed from Barcelona for a world record 222-million euros ($264m) but with shirts emblazoned with his name and No.10 on the back selling at an average of 100 euros, PSG generated 1 million euros on his first day. If PSG can keep that up, they would have recouped the transfer fee by mid-March, within the first season of Neymar's five-year deal -- although in reality that revenue is shared with shirt manufacturer Nike, meaning it would actually take twice as long to pay for the player. Such is the demand for the shirt at one of two PSG stores, on the iconic Champs Elysees boulevard and the team's outlet at their Parc des Princes home, that shoppers on Saturday will be limited to a single jersey each. Neymar is due to be unveiled to the PSG fans on the Parc des Princes pitch on Saturday at 3.45pm (1345 GMT) ahead of their opening Ligue 1 match of the season against newly-promoted Amiens at 5.15pm."
656,04/08/2017,09:13,Neymar pledges glory for PSG,"Brazilian superstar Neymar was expected in the French capital early Friday, promising to bring glory to Paris Saint-Germain after signing a world record transfer deal with the ambitious Qatari-owned club.","The 25-year-old forward doubled the previous record fee with his 222 million euro ($264 million) move from Barcelona and will earn a reported 30 million euros ($35.5 million) a year under the new deal. ""I am extremely happy to join Paris Saint-Germain,"" Neymar said late Thursday. ""Since I arrived in Europe, the club has always been one of the most competitive and most ambitious. And the biggest challenge, what most motivated me to join my new teammates is to help the club to conquer the titles that their fans want. ""Paris Saint-Germain's ambition attracted me to the club, along with the passion and the energy this brings. I played four seasons in Europe and I feel ready to take the challenge. ""From today, I will do everything I can to help my new teammates, to open up new horizons for my club and to bring happiness to its millions of supporters around the world."" PSG said that Neymar will appear at a press conference at the club's Parc des Princes at 1130GMT on Friday. He will then be presented to fans at the same ground at 1345GMT on Saturday before the season-opening Ligue 1 fixture against promoted Amiens. PSG wasted no time in pressing Neymar's commercial value by announcing that shirts bearing his name will be on sale from 10h00 am (0800 GMT) Friday at the club's megastore on the city's iconic Champs Elysees. Football legend Pele congratulated Neymar on his move, telling his successor in the famed Brazilian number 10 shirt: ""Good luck for your new challenge"". ""Paris is a beautiful city and one of my favourites in the world,"" three-time World Cup winner Pele wrote on Twitter. The transfer is more than double the previous world record set by Manchester United's capture of Paul Pogba from Juventus last year for 105 million euros, leaving many commentators aghast at the rampant inflation in football transfer fees. Leading coaches such as Arsenal's Arsene Wenger and Manchester United's Jose Mourinho lamented that the move could cause even greater inflation in transfer fees and player wages. ""It also looks like the inflation is accelerating,"" said Wenger, whose 21 years at Arsenal have been characterised by prudent spending. ""It's beyond calculation and beyond rationality."" However, in the French capital there is huge excitement at PSG having landed a star name to finally make them feared among European football's elite with even French president Emmanuel Macron enthused. ""It adds attractiveness. Yes, it's good news,"" said Macron. ""Paris at his feet"", splashed Le Parisien as Neymar dominated the French front pages Friday. ""A king comes to Paris,"" crowed L'Equipe newspaper. The mood is understandably more sombre in Barcelona where attention has turned to who the Catalans can sign to replace Neymar in the month before the transfer window closes. Neymar's Brazilian international teammate Philippe Coutinho of Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund's Ousmane Dembele have both been linked. There is also scepticism at the role played by PSG's owners Oryx Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) at a time of political crisis for the energy-rich state which has been boycotted by its Gulf neighbours in recent months and will play host to the World Cup in 2022. Spanish newspaper El Mundo described the move as a ""state signing."" Spain's La Liga initially refused to accept payment for Neymar's buyout clause in a bid to stall the move over allegations of transfer irregularities, but Neymar's ex-teammates wished him well. ""My friend I wish you the best in everything that comes!!!"" Luis Suarez posted on Instagram alongside a picture of the two hugging. ""Also thank you for your support, for everything that I learned with you and for the unique moments that we spent together!!!! Keep like this and never change love you little bro."" bur-dj/cw/wdb <org>FFP</org> <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org> <org>MANCHESTER UNITED</org>"
657,03/08/2017,19:33,Neymar free to join PSG as Barca buyout clause paid,Neymar is now free to complete his world record transfer to Paris Saint-Germain after Barcelona confirmed on Thursday his 222 million euro ($260 million) buyout clause had been received by the Catalan club.,"""On Thursday afternoon Neymar Jr's legal representatives visited in person the club's offices and made the payment of 222 million euros in the player's name with regards to the unilateral termination of the contract that united both parties,"" Barca said in a statement. The move had been held up by the Spanish league's refusal to accept the cheque presented by Neymar's lawyers at their Madrid headquarters earlier on Thursday. La Liga president Javier Tebas said he wouldn't accept PSG's money as he believes the deal will violate UEFA's financial fair play rules. And Barca added that they will aid UEFA in any future enquiry into whether the French side fall foul of regulations that don't allow clubs to lose more than 30 million euros over three years. ""The Club will pass on to UEFA the details of the above operation so that they can determine the disciplinary responsibilities that may arise from this case,"" continued the Barca statement. However, UEFA insisted the move doesn't automatically break FFP rules as PSG have time to balance their books. ""The transfer of Neymar to PSG will have an effect on the club's finances over several years but the impact of such an operation cannot be judged in advance, notably as PSG could well sell several players for a significant amount,"" UEFA said in a statement to AFP. The player is now due to arrive in Paris on Friday, according to airport sources in the French capital, to complete the deal. And Neymar could be presented at PSG's Ligue 1 opener at home to Amiens on Saturday. The Brazilian's new mark is more than double the previous record set by Manchester United's capture of Paul Pogba from Juventus last year for 105 million euros."
658,03/08/2017,13:32,La Liga rejects payment of Neymar buyout clause,"Spain's La Liga refused to accept the payment of Neymar's 222 million euro ($260 million) buyout clause on Thursday, delaying the Brazilian's world record move from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain.","However, legal experts believe La Liga won't be able to prevent PSG pushing the transfer through. ""We can confirm that the legal representatives of the player attended La Liga to pay the clause and this has been rejected,"" a La Liga spokesperson told AFP. Neymar had been expected to complete his move to the French giants by the weekend after Barcelona announced the 25-year-old striker's decision to leave on Wednesday on the condition his buyout clause was met. La Liga president Javier Tebas has been an outspoken critic of PSG's move to snatch one of the Spanish league's biggest stars. Tebas believes the astronomical sums being spent by the French giants, including a reported 30 million euro salary after tax for Neymar, makes it impossible for them to comply with financial fair play regulations (FFP). ""La Liga is an entity that defends the interests of the clubs and right now it is defending Barcelona,"" said Marcos Galera, a lawyer and founding member of Spanish sports law specialists Agaz. ""But if you follow literally Spanish legislation, they had an indemnity clause agreed....and the rules are that if you have a clause agreed, you have to abide by it."" One option open to PSG and Neymar is for the money to be deposited with a notary and to seek an international transfer certificate through FIFA. ""PSG and Neymar have the option to go to FIFA with the request that FIFA give them a provisional transfer,"" Javier Ferrero, a specialist in sports law for the Senn Ferrero firm, told AFP. ""What FIFA rules prioritise is that the players should have the chance to play."" Clubs can be sanctioned by UEFA for making a loss of more than 30 million euros over a three-year period. However, UEFA insist that the deal wouldn't automatically breach FFP. ""The transfer of Neymar to PSG will have an effect on the club's finances over several years but the impact of such an operation cannot be judged in advance, notably as PSG could well sell several players for a significant amount,"" UEFA said in a statement to AFP. PSG have already been fined and saw their Champions League squad limited by UEFA for breaches of FFP in 2014. Spanish clubs have dominated the Champions League in recent seasons with Barcelona and Real Madrid winning the competition for the last four years and Tebas fears their place at the top of the pyramid could be threatened by ""financial doping"". ""We will not accept this money from a club like PSG,"" Tebas told Madrid sports daily AS on Wednesday. ""Especially when this club is infringing rules and laws."" The role played by PSG's owners Oryx Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) has been looked upon skeptically in Spain with the El Mundo newspaper describing the move as a ""state signing."" ""The clubs/state that compete with financial doping can destabilise professional football in Europe, the international market and competitions,"" added Tebas."
659,03/08/2017,09:17,France 'delighted' at Neymar tax windfall,"French Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin on Thursday said he would be ""delighted"" at the prospect of Neymar paying tax in France after his expected record-busting transfer to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).","""If in fact Neymar does come to a French club, the budget minister will be delighted at the tax that he will be able to pay in France,"" Darmanin said on France Inter radio. ""It's better for this player to pay his tax in France rather than pay it elsewhere,"" Darmanin said. ""When you are a minister, your duty is to defend the interests of the state, and the interests of the state are that people pay their tax in France."" Neymar was expected to arrive in Paris on Thursday to finalise his world-record 222-million-euro transfer ($260 million) from Barcelona to PSG. His wages will reportedly triple to 30 million euros ($35.5 million) a year."
660,02/08/2017,13:37,Barcelona confirm Neymar wants to to leave,"Barcelona confirmed Neymar's wish to leave the Catalan giants on Wednesday, but insisted the Brazilian's 222 million euro ($260 million) buyout clause must be paid as his potential world record move to Paris Saint-Germain moved a step closer.","""Neymar Jr, accompanied by his father and representative, communicated to FC Barcelona this morning his decision to leave the club,"" Barca said in a statement. ""The club have informed them that the buyout clause in his contract that from July 1 is 222 million euros must be paid in full."" Such a fee would smash the current record £89.3 million ($111 million, 105.2 million euros) Manchester United paid for Paul Pogba last year. Neymar has also been given permission to not participate in training after making a brief appearance at Barca's training ground on Wednesday. Speculation over the 25-year-old's future has dominated the first few weeks of new Barca boss Ernesto Valverde's reign. Neymar arrived back in Barcelona on Tuesday from a fleeting promotional tour to China. He turned up for training at 9am local time (0700GMT) on Wednesday morning, but left less than an hour later after telling teammates ""he is leaving"", a Barca spokesperson confirmed. Presuming both clubs don't come to a late agreement, the buyout clause would have to be paid to Barcelona via Spain's La Liga to free the player from the contract he signed last year and runs until 2021. However, La Liga president Javier Tebas has threatened not to accept PSG's money over what he perceives as a failure on the French side's part to comply with UEFA's financial fair play rules (FFP). Clubs can be sanctioned by UEFA for making a loss of more than 30 million euros over a three-year period. ""We will not accept this money from a club like PSG,"" Tebas told Madrid sports daily AS on Wednesday. ""Especially when this club is infringing rules and laws."" Barcelona have also threatened to report PSG to UEFA over any potential breach of FFP. PSG have already been fined and saw their Champions League squad limited by UEFA for breaches of FFP in 2014. Winning the Champions League for a first time is the dream driving PSG's owners Oryx Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) to fund a deal that could herald the start of a new era at the elite level of European football. Since QSI's takeover in 2011, PSG have failed to make it beyond the quarter-final stage in recent seasons - most notably blowing a 4-0 first leg lead to lose 6-1 to a Neymar-inspired Barcelona in the last 16 of last season's competition in March. Prising Neymar from the grip of Barca would truly announce PSG's presence as a contender for the likes of Barca, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich to fear. Neymar has formed one of the deadliest strike partnerships in football history with five-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez over the past three seasons. Together they have won two La Liga titles, a Champions League and three Spanish Cups, whilst Neymar has scored 105 goals and provided 80 assists in just 186 games. Yet, one justification for Neymar to jump ship on top of the reported offer to triple his salary to 30 million euros net a season, is a desire to move out of Messi's shadow if he is to end the Argentine and Cristiano Ronaldo's decade-long dominance to win the Ballon d'Or. Neymar's four-year spell in Spain has also been overshadowed by the murky transfer deal which brought him to Barcelona from Santos in 2013. He and his parents as well as Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu face charges of fraud and corruption in an ongoing case brought by DIS, a Brazilian investment company. DIS owned 40 percent of the players' rights at the time of the deal and believe they were deliberately cheated out of their real share due to the complex structure of the transfer. Neymar was reported by Spanish media to be heading next to London to study the PSG contract with his father and his agent."
661,31/07/2017,16:18,Neymar gets China red-carpet treatment as speculation grows,Neymar hit the red carpet in Shanghai on Monday as speculation mounted that the Brazil star could be set to quit Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain for a world-record 222 million euros.,"The 25-year-old striker is at the centre of an apparent tug of war between the two European giants in what would be the most expensive transfer fee in football history. A training spat with new Barcelona signing Nelson Semedo during a pre-season tour in Miami ramped up chatter that Neymar could be about to swap Spain for the French capital. Neymar, who has remained tight-lipped about the transfer rumours, posted a message for Chinese fans on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, after arriving for a promotional visit. ""Ni Hao China! I'm Neymar Jr. and I've just arrived in China,"" he wrote. ""I'm in Shanghai at the moment. I would like to send a huge hug to all my Chinese fans, thank you very much for your support."" He later posed for a scrum of photographers and television journalists and answered questions about fashion, before attending an evening event for a clothing brand. Neymar also posted on Weibo a picture of himself with fellow Brazilian forward Hulk, who plays in the Chinese Super League for Shanghai SIPG. Even following the training-ground bust-up in the United States, after which Neymar appeared to storm off, his Barcelona team-mates said they wanted him to stay at the Camp Nou. ""Neymar and I, we are very close and I want him to stay and I know the situation,"" defender Gerard Pique told ESPN FC. ""Right now he doesn't know what to do and we are trying to help him -- the ones (on the team) that are more close to him -- to take the right decision."" PSG's pursuit of Neymar has angered some in Spain, where football league chief Javier Tebas says he will file a complaint with UEFA for financial fair play breaches by the French club."
662,30/07/2017,11:17,Alves urges 'friend' Neymar to show courage,Veteran Brazil international full-back Dani Alves said he is hopeful superstar Neymar will join him at Paris Saint Germain but insisted he isn't using his personal friendship to sway the Barcelona forward's decision.,"The two were team-mates at Barca from Neymar's arrival in 2013 until Alves left to join Juventus a year ago. Having joined PSG, 34-year-old Alves hopes Neymar will show courage and decide to swell the French capital club's large Brazilian contingent, that includes forward Lucas Moura, and centre-backs Thiago Silva and Marquinhos. Neymar, 25, is involved in a tug of war between the two European giants with his potential transfer to Paris the major saga of the off season. ""I hope it will happen. I've got nothing to do with his decision, it's a very important decision for him,"" said Alves, after scoring in PSG's French Super Cup victory over Monaco in Tangiers on Saturday. ""Men have to make these kind of decisions. I hope he'll join us, he's one of my best friends and I always want my friends to be close by. ""I can't interfere in his decision. It's his decision to make but we'll welcome him with open arms if he comes."" PSG are allegedly weighing up whether or not to trigger Neymar's 222-million-euro ($261 million) release clause, which would more than double the biggest transfer fee ever paid, currently the £89 million (105 million euros, $115 million) Manchester United forked out to bring back France midfielder Paul Pogba from Juventus. Pogba was then instrumental in convincing his friend Romelu Lukaku to join United from Everton for £75 million earlier this month. But Alves says he won't be trying to influence his compatriot. ""I helped him once, I helped him come to Barcelona. I didn't make the decision for him, but I simply told him what there was at Barca, and he decided to go there,"" said Alves. ""Decisions are for the courageous. I'm the most courageous: I decided to quit Barca, to quit Juve; I always make my decisions. ""He has to decide for his maturity and his ideas about continuing to improve."""
663,27/07/2017,08:13,Marchisio brace lifts Juventus to 3-2 win over PSG,Claudio Marchisio's second-half double was enough for Juventus to see off Paris Saint-Germain 3-2 on Wednesday and send the French champions home from the United States on the back of two consecutive defeats.,"The Italian international scored the goal of the game, a fiercely struck effort in the 62nd to restore Juve's lead after PSG's equaliser on 53 minutes. Although Unai Emery's team battled hard, as the clock ticked down Moise Kean was brought down in the box allowing Marchisio to win it from the penalty spot. It was a tough call on PSG defender Layvin Kurzawa, who appeared to become entangled with Kean, but Juventus were not complaining about a decision which capped a decent night's work for the Italian giants. Any of the 44,444 who came to the Hard Rock Stadium would have been acutely aware that Miami is preparing itself for the arrivals of European titans Barcelona and Real Madrid on Saturday in what's being billed as the glittering showpiece of this summer's International Champions Cup friendly tournament. Yet while La Liga's finest wait in the wings, this was a chance for two other stellar clubs to whet the appetite of the voraciously soccer mad inhabitants of South Florida. It was PSG's last match in the United States before leaving to meet Monaco in Morocco on Saturday, prior to returning home to fine tune preparations for the start of the domestic season. Emery's side have endured a difficult time Stateside, both on and off the pitch. The results - a penalty win over Roma following a 1-1 draw before being roundly beaten by Tottenham Hotspur in Orlando last Saturday - have been compounded by a very public -- and so far unresolved -- attempt to prise the Brazilian forward Neymar from Barcelona. Emery, who admitted PSG are still working on transfer targets but refused to be drawn on specific names, said: ""We are looking at how the players are performing rather than the results and I have been pleased."" Nevertheless, the PSG manager's mood wouldn't have been lifted by a chastening first 45 minutes. Their tormentor in chief was the excellent Argentina international midfielder Paulo Dybala, 23, who went close to opening the scoring on 28 minutes when his free-kick was tipped over by Areola just three minutes after compatriot Angel Di Maria forced Italian veteran Gianluigi Buffon into an excellent save. Juan Cuadrado, the Colombian former Chelsea winger, was also in the mood to shine and went close soon after but it was left to Dybala and another Argentinian to open the scoring. Gonzalo Higuain , who scored 24 goals in his first season in Turin following his record breaking 90 million euros move from Napoli last summer, sent the ball inside to Dybala who instantly returned it straight into the path of the 29 year-old -- who advanced on goal before calmly beating Alphonse Areola in the 45th minute. It was a brilliant finish matched only by Marchisio's 62nd minute piledriver which restored the Old Lady's lead after Gonçalo Guedes had tapped home a Di Maria cross to bring the scores level on 53 minutes. Some sloppy play from PSG substitute Layvin Kurzawa saw the lively Kean win possession and his center was powerfully driven past Areola by the Italian international midfielder. Buffon's replacement Carlo Pinsoglio enjoyed an impressive second-half run out and his brilliant stop to deny Jese on 74 minutes would have drawn approval from Juve's legendary captain. He could do little with Javier Pastore's close range header on 80 minutes, but Marchisio would have the final say in the 89th. Juventus finish off their US tour against Serie A rivals Roma in Boston on Sunday."
664,23/07/2017,04:37,Spurs open pre-season with 4-2 friendly win over PSG,Harry Kane's late penalty helped Tottenham Hotspur start their pre-season preparations in emphatic fashion as French champions Paris St Germain imploded in Orlando.,"PSG were reduced to 10 men just moments into the second half when German goalkeeper Kevin Trapp, who had endured an awful first 45 minutes, was sent off for handballing outside of the box. And although Unai Emery's side were difficult to break down, late strikes from Belgian defender Toby Alderweireld and Kane, both on as substitutes, sealed a 4-2 triumph in front of 33,332 fans at the Camping World Stadium. It's very early days in this pre-season yet there was certainly enough on show from the London team to suggest a strong campaign in the Premier League beckons. Both teams arrived at the Camping World stadium with tremendous uncertainty surrounding their transfer dealings this summer. The French champions are reportedly poised to land Neymar from Barcelona in a world record 222-million euro ($256.8 million) deal, and also remain confident of landing Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez. Emery was giving nothing away when asked about the potential transfers. ""We are always looking for players who can help the team,"" he said. ""Now for us the most important thing is to concentrate on the matches we have coming up,"" added the coach, who on the evidence of Saturday's game could use the infusion of talent. Tottenham, meanwhile, were once again forced to contest claims that Eric Dier, their versatile England international, was the subject of a $50 million bid from Manchester United. There is certain to be movement involving both teams as their respective domestic seasons draw closer, yet this was the first time Mauricio Pochettino's side had played this pre-season. PSG beat Roma on penalties in Detroit last Wednesday after their exhibition game finished 1-1 after 90 minutes. That match saw Dani Alves, the Brazilian defender, make his Paris debut following his transfer from Juventus and he was started again here by Emery in a line-up which also included Thiago Motta and Uruguayan forward Edinson Cavani. Pochettino, whose side travel to New York on Sunday ahead of Tuesday's match with Roma at Red Bull Arena, kept star men Kane and Dele Alli on the bench, although Dier began in midfield alongside Mousa Dembele. On six minutes, Cavani powered the French side ahead. Youngster Cameron Carter Vickers was caught out by Adrien Rabiot who raced clear and squared for the Uruguayan frontman. Tottenham looked culpable defensively, yet just five minutes later, Christian Eriksen pulled the Premier League side level. The Danish international unleashed an unstoppable, curling effort from 30 yards which flew past Kevin Trapp into the top corner. While Eriksen's equaliser was world class, Dier's 18th minute goal was pure luck. Trapp's poor clearance was hit straight at the Spurs player who gleefully saw the ball rebound over the line. The English Premier League side should have extended their lead even further soon after, but Georges-Kevin Nkoudou wastefully fired over with just Trapp to beat before Ben Davies also went close thanks to some lovely build up play involving Vincent Janssen. Pastore , however, wasn't about to waste any opportunities and his close range strike on 36 minutes brought the entertaining tussle level once more only for Motta to head against his own post five minutes before the interval. Trapp's disastrous evening plummeted to new depths just 20 seconds into the second half. The German handled the ball outside of the box and was immediately shown the red card. Kane and Alli, brought on by Pochettino during a raft of eight half-time changes, now had the chance to make the Parisians pay for their sloppiness and it was the England striker who sealed the triumph after Blaise Matuidi handled in the box six minutes after Alderweireld's fantastic 20-yard strike left replacement keeper Alphonse Areola with no chance. ""There are lot of positives to take,"" Pochettino said. ""Our first game, it's good to feel the competition. It's a friendly but playing this kind of team it's always good to compete. ""The result isn't important. We just need to recover and arrive at the start of the Premier League season in good condition."""
665,22/07/2017,04:26,Picture this! Pensive Neymar stirs renewed PSG fever,Neymar's decision to post a photo of himself in thoughtful contemplation sparked a fresh wave of speculation that he is on the verge of sealing a world record 222-million-euro ($256.8 million) move from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain.,"The Instagram picture, even accompanied by a matching emoji, shows the 25-year-old Brazilian superstar stretched out on the pitch with his chin resting on his left hand. It garnered more than 1.5 million 'likes' within 12 hours of it being posted in the United States where Barcelona are on a pre-season tour. Three of the 'likes' came from PSG players -- winger Angel Di Maria, goalkeeper Kevin Trapp and midfielder Marco Verratti. French newspaper Le Parisien fuelled speculation Friday with an unsourced report that Neymar had told several Barcelona teammates of his intentions to join PSG, adding that the transfer is considered a done deal by some Barcelona players. That echoes media company Esporte Interativo's insistence that an agreement has been reached for Neymar to move to the French capital from Barcelona, where he has played since 2013. On Tuesday, PSG skipper -- and fellow Brazilian -- Thiago Silva gave a digital thumbs up to a mocked-up photo montage published by Esporte Interativo showing Neymar in a PSG shirt along with compatriots and prospective teammates in France. Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde described the ongoing saga as a ""time of rumours"". ""We understand it's how it is. He is with us right now, one of us,"" said Valverde in East Rutherford where his team plays Juventus in a pre-season friendly on Saturday. That match will give Neymar a chance to display his coveted skills for the first time this summer. ""He's a player we love and we want,"" Valverde said. ""Not only football wise, but also for the things he brings to the locker room. ""There's no need to worry about something we don't know if it's going to happen or not. If it happens in the future, we'll see."" PSG skipper Thiago Silva told Le Parisien he had no idea if the Brazilian star was about to switch to the French capital. ""I don't know. I hear a lot from journalists and a player like Neymar would be an interesting addition to the PSG project,"" said Thiago, speaking in Florida -- where the French club takes on Tottenham in a friendly on Saturday. ""But, for the moment, it is especially important to prepare for the new season. After and if Neymar arrives it would be a good thing for the squad."" Is Neymar going to sign? ""Not yet,"" smiled the captain. In Spain, it was reported by Catalan media group RAC 1 that ""certain players"" at Barcelona have already tried to convince Neymar not to accept the PSG offer which would dwarf the 105 million euros Manchester United paid Juventus for Paul Pogba. Javier Mascherano said Neymar was ""the future"" of Barcelona as the Argentine pleaded with the striker to stay put. ""In the case of Ney, obviously he is young, and I hope he's here with Barcelona for many more years,"" Mascherano told American sports network ESPN. ""He is a really important player for the club. Because of his age, he's the future of the club, and we hope we can keep on counting on him."" However, it's believed the Brazilian is being seduced by the immense wealth on offer to him from the Qatari owners of PSG and by the opportunity to have a team built around him. The daily Sport newspaper also claimed that Luis Suarez has also attempted to persuade Neymar not to split up the MSN frontline at Barcelona made up of Lionel Messi, Suarez and the Brazilian star. Catalunya Radio said that the deal is ""95 percent complete"". One of the keys would be the payment to Neymar's father and agent of a ""premium exceeding the 40 million"" paid when the player controversially moved to Spain from Santos. Other reports have claimed that Neymar senior has recently met with, or is about to meet, PSG sporting director Antero Henrique. However, Barcelona vice-president Jordi Mestre insisted Tuesday that it is ""200 percent"" certain that Neymar will stay at the club. In a public game of tit-for-tat pronouncements, PSG coach Unai Emery hailed the Brazilian. ""Neymar has advanced his game massively and today he is one of the five best in the world,"" said Emery. ""Our president is working hard to attract top players and our fans would be content to count on a new top player to go along with the talent we already have."""
666,20/07/2017,05:35,PSG edges Roma on penalties in friendly,"Paris Saint-Germain edged Roma 5-3 on penalties on Wednesday after they played to a 1-1 draw in a friendly international football match in Detroit, Michigan.","Brazilian defender Marquinhos gave the Ligue 1 giants the lead in the 36th minute, but Roma responded with a strong second-half performance that saw Sadiq Umar nab the equalizer in the 60th minute. Under the rules of the International Champions Cup friendly tournament the match was then settled by a shootout. Only Roma's Gerson failed to convert, and Marquinhos capped his night with the decisive penalty. Brazil international Dani Alvez made his debut for PSG, starting at right back a week after he signed with the French club in a deal worth a reported 14 million euros ($16 million). Alves played 69 minutes and was perhaps lucky not to concede a penalty in the 57th, when his slide tackle caught Diego Perotti in the area. PSG's Spanish coach Unai Emery was satisfied with what he saw from Alves, who won three Champions Leagues and six La Liga titles at Barcelona and who many had expected to end up with former manager Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. ""He played with his experience,"" Emery said. ""He talks a lot on the pitch, he also brings a lot in attack."" The match drew more than 36,000 to Comerica Park, home of Major League Baseball's Detroit Tigers. Paris had seized the lead nine minutes before halftime. A neat combination between Thiago Motta and Jese saw the ball fall to Marquinhos, who fired home a right-footed shot from the center of the area. The French club continued to push, with Lucas Moura firing straight at Roma keeper Alisson, but the lead remained at 1-0 at halftime. With six changes for Roma and two for PSG, both clubs struggled to find a rhythm to open the second half. But Roma gradually increased the pressure and were rewarded on the hour mark a pass from Gerson saw the speedy Sadiq put in behind and the 20-year-old Nigerian put the ball through Alphonse Areola's legs. Blaise Matuidi had three late chances for PSG, including blazing over from close range in the 85th minute and an injury-time effort. In the shoot-out, the first five penalties were converted before Gerson, the third penalty-taker for Roma, missed. ""The team did a good job,"" Emery said. ""The result was not the most important thing. Of course, we wanted to win, but what is important is to give playing time to many players."""
667,18/07/2017,15:17,Barca '200%' certain Neymar will stay,Barcelona vice-president Jordi Mestre insisted Tuesday that Brazilian star Neymar will be staying in Spain despite rumours linking him with a move to Paris Saint-Germain.,"Asked during a press conference if he could confirm Neymar would remain at Barca ahead of the 2017-18 season, Mestre replied: ""200 percent"". Reports in Spain have suggested PSG are looking to lure the 25-year-old to the Parc des Princes after snapping up Neymar's international teammate Dani Alves on a free transfer. ""PSG want to finalise the signing of Neymar this summer"", wrote Catalan daily Sport, while the Madrid-based AS newspaper led with the headline ""Neymar flirts with PSG"". PSG are reportedly attempting to take advantage of Neymar's desire to step out of Lionel Messi's shadow, with the French club prepared to build a team around the Brazil forward. ""In the background of Neymar's annoyance there's always a concern, which has to do with his role in the team and his wish to become a leader,"" wrote Sport. ""But you have to be aware that there are no shortcuts to leadership and it is something that is earned slowly, naturally and progressively,"" it added. According to Marca, PSG would be willing to stump up the 222 million euros ($256.8 million) required to trigger Neymar's release clause and would offer him a five-year deal worth 30-plus million euros a season. However, a report in French sports daily L'Equipe on Tuesday quoted a PSG club source as saying: ""We're not going to repeat the Neymar show. There is a huge release clause and you have to be realistic."" PSG have previously been linked with Neymar only for the striker to pen a new five-year deal with Barca last October."

The 34-year-old won three Champions Leagues and six La Liga titles at Barcelona, whose former manager Pep Guardiola had hoped to lure Alves to Manchester City. But the right-back turned down the chance to reunite with Guardiola as PSG offered Alves a deal worth 14 million euros ($16 million, £12.4 million) a year, according to reports in France, twice what City had been willing to pay. ""I didn't only have interest from Manchester City but other clubs in England as well,"" said Alves. ""I have friends here, my wife likes the city and that's why I changed my mind. ""If Guardiola feels wronged, I apologise for that. If Manchester City feel annoyed, I am sorry as well but I take responsibility."" Alves passed a medical in the French capital before he was presented at a press conference in Paris, holding aloft his new shirt with the number 32 on its back. He quit Italian giants Juventus two weeks ago after helping them to a Serie A and Coppa Italia double while also reaching the Champions League final in his only season in Turin. ""Our goal is to win the Champions League, we're assembling a very strong team with this goal in mind,"" said Alves. ""I like to make history and this club has yet to win this title. I like big goals, ones that are special and ambitious and all that is why I am here."" Alves lifted the UEFA Cup twice with Sevilla before winning a remarkable haul 23 of trophies in eight years at Barcelona. ""Believe me I came here to win trophies,"" he added. ""The club has grown amazingly and I'm delighted to be here. ""We're going to share some great moments together, I'm sure of it!"" Alves will join a host of Brazilians in Paris, with Thiago Silva, Marquinhos and Lucas already at the Parc des Princes, while PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said the recruitment of Alves sent a strong signal to their European rivals. ""You had a lot of opportunities but you chose our proposal, it's a big message to the world,"" Al-Khelaifi said of Alves' decision to join PSG. ""We want to win lots of trophies, to win the Champions League, as everyone knows, is our biggest dream. With your experience, your ambition, I'm very confident about the chances of winning together."" Alves' arrival follows that of Spanish left-back Yuri Berchiche from Real Sociedad for a reported 14 million euros last week."

The German daily says the French club and the player are on the verge of an agreement. Dortmund are set to receive an offer from PSG when their season finishes after the German Cup final on May 27 against Eintracht Frankfurt. Aubameyang, 27, could reportedly earn up to 14 million euros per season at PSG. The Gabon international, who was born in France, has repeatedly said he wants to eventually join Real Madrid or at least play in the Spanish league, but he has family in Paris. The striker has three years left on his Dortmund contract, but has hinted he may leave at the end of the season and the German club has not ruled out selling him. Ex-Germany striker Lukas Podolski says it would be a good move for Aubameyang. ""He comes from France, speaks the language, his family is there,"" Podolski wrote in a column for Bild last week. ""But he has to ask himself: do I have the same feeling as in Dortmund? ""He is the superstar at Borussia. Saint-Germain has lots of them.

""We are happy because it was a difficult match at Angers,"" said PSG coach Unai Emery. ""We're content with three points. We were well-prepared, concentrated and worked well."" Monaco can reclaim their three-point advantage with victory at home to relegation threatened Dijon on Saturday but with one eye on next week's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Borussia Dortmund, they could be vulnerable. What's more, Monaco have had one less day to prepare for Saturday's game after their first leg in Germany, which the Principality outfit won 3-2, was postponed 24 hours after a triple bomb blast damaged the home side's team bus and left Spanish defender Marc Bartra with a broken wrist. How much that incident has affected Monaco's already weary players remains to be seen while PSG -- knocked out of Europe themselves in dramatic circumstances in the previous round when Barcelona came back from a 4-0 first leg deficit to triumph 6-5 on aggregate -- have only domestic matters to concentrate on now. Di Maria's first goal was a rare bright spark in an otherwise tight first half, but there was no doubting the quality of the Argentine's placement as he bent a sumptuous free-kick from 25 yards over the defensive wall and beyond the despairing reach of Alexandre Letellier in the Angers goal on 28 minutes. The home side had the ball in the net on 39 minutes through captain Cheikh Ndoye but it was controversially disallowed for a foul by Famara Diedhiou on Serge Aurier when television replays proved inconclusive as to which of the two was the true offender as they wrestled in the area. Ndoye came close again 18 minutes from time when his powerful header appeared destined for the top corner until goalkeeper Kevin Trapp acrobatically tipped the ball over the bar. For a team in mid-table safety, Angers were played with real purpose but lacked the quality to break down a stubborn away defence. And six minutes form time, PSG struck with rapier speed and efficiency on the counter-attack mas Lucas Moura fed Di Maria to slot home his second at the near post, although Letellier's positioning was highly questionable."

""He's been with Paris for five years and now he's starting to wonder whether it's better earning a lot (of money) and not winning anything, or to start winning trophies."" Verratti has won four consecutive league titles with the Ligue 1 giants since joining the club from Pescara, in the process forging a reputation as one of the best creative midfielders in the world. But PSG's failure to make an impact in Europe, in spite of huge investment by the club's Qatari owners, has left the 24-year-old midfielder disillusioned. Poised to cruise into the last eight of the Champions League following a sensational 4-0 rout of Barcelona in the first leg of their last 16 clash, PSG were dramatically overhauled 6-1 in the second leg less than a fortnight ago. It was hailed as one of the most remarkable comebacks in sport, but left Verratti with doubts over his commitment to Unai Emery's side.

On their way to a record sixth consecutive Serie A title, the Turin giants will also meet Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals. But Di Campli added: ""There are a few interested (clubs) in Italy, but I have doubts that will be his final destination. ""It's not about money: whichever club takes Verratti will pay him well.

674,14/03/2017,21:17,PSG condemn Barca collapse ref in letter to UEFA,"Paris Saint-Germain have sent a letter of complaint to UEFA about the referee who oversaw their spectacular collapse to Barcelona, accusing him of ruining their Champions League campaign.","The Spanish champions' historic win was overshadowed by a series of controversial calls from German referee Deniz Aytekin and he awarded them two penalties on the way to a 6-1 hammering last week to surge into the quarter-finals. A source with knowledge of the letter confirmed Tuesday media reports about the dossier sent to UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin; UEFA said that it had received a letter from PSG, giving no details of its content. The source told AFP that the letter was designed to ""point out a series of errors"" and ""errors of judgement"" by Aytekin. Under-pressure PSG coach Unai Emery said in the aftermath of Barcelona's miracle revival from a 4-0 first-leg deficit: ""We had chances to make it 3-2 and then the refereeing decisions, I don't know if they were right or not, but for sure they damaged us."" PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi was less forgiving. ""The outcome of the match could have been different with more clear-sighted officiating,"" he told Le Parisien newspaper at the weekend.

675,10/03/2017,01:45,Skipper Silva a symbol of PSG's failure,There may not have been the dramatic tears this time but there was a familiar feeling of agony for Paris Saint-Germain captain Thiago Silva on Wednesday as his side suffered their absurd Champions League humiliation.,"Silva was derided for letting his emotions get the better of him as he captained Brazil at the 2014 World Cup, images of him in tears after a penalty shoot-out win over Chile seen as evidence of a mentally weak side. That team, of course, ultimately lost 7-1 to Germany in the semi-finals. As it happened, Silva did not play in that game due to suspension, but he was there wearing the armband as PSG succumbed 6-1 to Barcelona, the second most remarkable implosion in recent footballing memory seeing the French side lose 6-5 on aggregate. ""It is difficult to talk. As captain, I am very proud of my players. But nothing worked out. That is the truth. It is a defeat that hurts,"" Silva said after the game at the Camp Nou. It is unfair to single out one player in PSG's train-wreck of an evening, but as captain Silva has to take his share of the responsibility. The 32-year-old has often been hailed as the best player in the world in his position but whether he should be captaining some of the planet's leading sides is open to debate. After 2014, Dunga replaced Luiz Felipe Scolari as Brazil coach and went on to axe Silva. In Paris, he has worn the armband for a team whose performances in the Champions League still do not match their ambitions -- four successive quarter-final exits and now elimination in the last 16 in spectacular fashion. Unai Emery's side failed to make the most of their stunning 4-0 win in the first leg, when Silva was absent. The official line was that the former AC Milan man was suffering from a calf problem, but some have questioned that. ""It is difficult to say if he was injured. Nothing much showed up in the tests. It is as though he became paralysed as the game approached,"" one source told sports daily L'Equipe after the first leg. On Wednesday, he was back alongside compatriot Marquinhos in the heart of the Paris defence, with youngster Presnel Kimpembe making way, but to Le Figaro Silva was ""a leader out of his depth"". ""For a long time I have said he is not my cup of tea because he is not a leader. He doesn't bring the best out of his teammates and doesn't stand out in difficult moments,"" former PSG and France defender Dominique Bathenay told L'Equipe. It now remains to be seen how Silva and PSG will recover from such a defeat, the club's heaviest reverse in 20 years. They are still alive in all three domestic competitions going into Sunday's trip to Ligue 1's bottom club Lorient, although they trail league leaders Monaco by three points. Emery, himself now under enormous pressure, will make changes and Marco Verratti is suspended. As for Monaco, the principality club will be aiming to turn around a 5-3 first-leg deficit when they host Manchester City in the return of their Champions League last-16 tie next Wednesday. Before that, Leonardo Jardim's side entertain European chasers Bordeaux on Saturday, while Nice -- still in the title hunt and unbeaten at home this season -- welcome Caen on Friday. That match was brought forward to avoid a clash with the conclusion of the Paris-Nice cycle race."

Emery, meanwhile, said PSG were damaged by German referee Deniz Aytekin's decisions to award two penalties to Barcelona -- both in the second half. Lionel Messi converted the first penalty on 50 minutes to make it 3-0, before PSG's Edinson Cavani scored what looked like a crucial away goal. But Neymar, after scoring an 88th-minute free kick, tucked away the second penalty in the 91st minute before Sergi Roberto got the vital goal in the fifth minute of injury time. ""The truth is we have let a huge opportunity get away and we are aware of that. In the first half it was more our fault than them playing well,"" said Spanish coach Emery.

However, he scored just twice in 14 appearances and quickly fell down the pecking order for PSG's Spanish coach Unai Emery before joining home town club Las Palmas on loan in January. ""I like him a lot as a player and a person, and I hope that from Thursday it goes well for him at Las Palmas,"" Zidane said on Tuesday. When the Canary Islanders pushed the boat out to bring the 24-year-old forward back to La Liga at the end of January, qualifying for Europe was the aim. Instead, Las Palmas have lost all four games to Granada, Sevilla, Malaga and Real Sociedad since signing Jese to slip to 12th and cap his miserable season for far. A move away from Real was supposed to relaunch his career after the devastating effect of a cruciate knee ligament injury that cut short his breakthrough season in 2013/14 when Zidane was Madrid's assistant coach to Carlo Ancelotti. At the time Jese was one of the brightest young talents in world football with goals against Barcelona, Valencia, Athletic Bilbao and Villarreal that campaign putting him on the verge of a call-up to Spain's 2014 World Cup squad. Despite going onto to make 94 appearances in all for Madrid, his career at the Bernabeu never recovered as he lived in the shadow of Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale and was also ultimately usurped by the likes of Lucas Vazquez for first team opportunities. ""He is a high quality Spanish player who has always shown enormous potential,"" added Zidane. ""It didn't go as he would have wanted at PSG, maybe he did not have all the minutes to show what he could do. ""I wish him is all the best from Thursday, and hope that he regains his form because he is a great player."" Substitutes Isco and Alvaro Morata made a huge impact as Real came from 2-0 down to beat Villarreal 3-2 on Sunday and could be rewarded with a start on Wednesday as Zidane promised to rotate his squad once more. Gareth Bale started the Real fightback by scoring on his first start for three months and the Welshman has been included in Zidane's 19-man squad despite suffering a knock late on at the Ceramic Stadium."
682,18/02/2017,16:25,PSG thrashing could have been worse - Luis Enrique,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique admitted his side's 4-0 Champions League mauling at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain could have been even worse as he insisted he has taken no decision over his future on Saturday.,"The Spanish champions are on the verge of not reaching the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time in 10 years after defeat in Paris that matched their heaviest in Enrique's three-year reign. ""Evidently, it is a huge blow for everyone, but the sky hasn't caved in,"" Enrique said on Saturday ahead of his side's clash at home to Leganes. ""The opponent deserves more. They were better, we have to accept that. ""It was a fair result. The truth is it could have been even more."" Enrique has received fierce criticsm over the past few days with even midfielders Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta questioning his tactics. The former Barca captain is out of contract at the end of the season with no talks scheduled over a renewal. However, he claimed that the debacle in Paris would not decide whether he decides to stay on if offered a new deal. ""The only thing that is clear is that what happens in these months has nothing to do with my decision,"" he added. ""Not one game, not 10 games, no even our 38 games this year. ""I still haven't made my decision."""
683,15/02/2017,01:30,Barcelona shell-shocked after PSG hammering,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique admitted his side's Champions League hopes are all but over for this season after they were outclassed 4-0 by a brilliant Paris Saint-Germain in their last 16 first leg on Tuesday.,"Angel Di Maria scored twice for the French champions on his 29th birthday at the Parc des Princes, while Julian Draxler and Edinson Cavani -- on his 30th birthday -- were also on target in a stunning home performance. The result leaves PSG on the brink of a place in the quarter-finals for the fifth season in succession, while Barcelona are staring at their earliest exit since losing to Liverpool in the last 16 in 2007. It was the Catalans' worst night in Europe since their 7-0 aggregate mauling at the hands of Bayern Munich in the 2013 semi-finals, and no team has ever gone through after losing 4-0 in the first leg of a European tie. ""It is difficult to explain. They were superior to us from the start,"" admitted Luis Enrique. ""There was a 15-minute spell in the first half in which we were on top, but otherwise PSG attacked quickly on the break and created a lot of chances. ""It was a disastrous night for us. They were completely superior. There is not much more to say."" Di Maria, the former Real Madrid winger, opened the scoring with a free-kick in the 18th minute and Germany star Draxler marked his European debut for the club with the second goal five minutes before the interval. Di Maria curled in his second and the home side's third 10 minutes after half-time before Cavani completed the rout with his 34th goal of the campaign in the 71st minute. ""PSG did what we expected them to do and produced their best version and we were at our poorest,"" the Barcelona coach added. ""It's extremely difficult for us now but we go back to our stadium and really we need a heroic performance but why not dream? ""These players have shown down the years that they can get great results. Our chances are slim but there is a chance all the same."" History suggests their chances are less than slim and the tie is PSG's to lose now after what was a signature European performance from the French champions. They had twice been eliminated by Barca in the four seasons prior to this, but their 3-1 home defeat to the Catalans in 2015 was their only loss in their 42 previous European outings at the Parc des Princes. Coach Unai Emery, meanwhile, had only won one of 23 games against Barcelona in his coaching career, but his team destroyed their opponents right from the off. Lionel Messi, Neymar, Luis Suarez and Andres Iniesta all endured miserable nights while the likes of Draxler, Di Maria, Adrien Rabiot and Thomas Meunier were all superb. Centre-back Presnel Kimpembe also produced an accomplished display on his Champions League debut at the age of 21 in place of injured captain Thiago Silva. ""We could not have imagined a better evening. To win 4-0 against Barcelona on my birthday is incredible,"" Di Maria told beIN Sports. ""It was the perfect match. But to go through we will need to play like this again because they are also capable of scoring four goals."" Emery could be forgiven for basking in the glory of such a victory after the criticism he faced in his early months in France. However, the Spaniard preferred to strike a note of caution ahead of the return. ""We put in a great effort against a great team but the message in the dressing room was that we still have 90 minutes to play. ""Satisfaction for a coach is very short-lived and I respect the great team that Barcelona are."""
684,14/02/2017,23:00,Di Maria stars as brilliant PSG stun Barcelona,Angel Di Maria scored a brilliant brace on his birthday as Paris Saint-Germain sensationally destroyed Barcelona 4-0 at the Parc des Princes in their Champions League last 16 first leg on Tuesday.,"Di Maria, the former Real Madrid star, opened the scoring in the 18th minute and curled in another 10 minutes into the second half to celebrate his 29th birthday in style. January signing Julian Draxler also netted in between while Edinson Cavani marked his 30th birthday by adding his name to the scoresheet in the 71st minute in the French capital. Barcelona were completely stunned, the defeat their biggest European humiliation since losing 7-0 on aggregate to Bayern Munich in the semi-finals in 2013. They are now staring at a first exit from the competition before the quarter-finals in a decade, unless they can pull off a miraculous escape in the second leg at the Camp Nou next month. This was PSG's night, though, and Unai Emery's side will surely go on to secure a fifth successive appearance in the quarter-finals. ""To win 4-0 against Barcelona on my birthday is incredible, we are so happy. It was the perfect match and we are delighted with the result,"" Di Maria told beIN Sports. ""To go through we will need to produce another performance like this. We scored four goals but they are capable of doing the same thing."" PSG had twice been eliminated from the Champions League at the hands of Barcelona in the previous four seasons, and the Catalans also had a fearsome record in games against sides coached by Emery, losing just one of 23 before this. But Luis Enrique's team, for all the brilliance of Lionel Messi, have recently looked more fragile than in a long time and the French champions showed no fear. They were without injured captain Thiago Silva and the suspended Thiago Motta, meaning a start for Adrien Rabiot in midfield and a Champions League debut in defence for 21-year-old Presnel Kimpembe. Draxler also made his European debut for the club and the German was superb as PSG pressed Barcelona high right from the off -- the home side had already worked Marc-Andre ter Stegen in the Barca goal before they got the opener. The menacing Draxler was fouled just outside the area and Di Maria bent the resulting free-kick over the wall and in for his third goal in the Champions League this season. Crocked following an early foul by Rabiot, Neymar was off the field receiving treatment as the Parc des Princes crowd erupted. He was able to continue, but the visitors were lacklustre, Luis Suarez starved of service, Messi quiet and skipper Andres Iniesta struggling to cope. One Neymar acceleration did lead to an Andre Gomes shot that was turned behind by Kevin Trapp, yet otherwise the chances were at the other end. Ter Stegen saved from Draxler after a counterattack, but there was nothing he could do as the German made it 2-0 five minutes from half-time, exchanging passes with Marco Verratti and rifling a shot past the goalkeeper from the right side of the area. The expectation was that Barcelona would come out fighting after the restart but instead they fell further behind in the 55th minute to a piece of brilliance from Di Maria. The move started with Trapp rolling a goal-kick out to Rabiot on the edge of his own box and the midfielder turning away under pressure from Messi. It ended with Di Maria curling a left-foot shot high into the top-left corner of the net from the edge of the other area. Di Maria then came off to a standing ovation, but Paris were not finished. Thomas Meunier surged forward from right-back and set up Cavani, who thumped home his 34th goal of the season in all competitions. A miserable night for Barcelona was compounded when Samuel Umtiti hit the post late on."
685,13/02/2017,20:47,PSG lose skipper Silva for Barcelona clash,"Paris Saint-Germain will be without injured captain Thiago Silva for Tuesday's Champions League last 16 first leg against Barcelona, the club revealed on Monday.","The Brazilian centre-back is suffering from ""a persistent left calf problem"", a club source said. Earlier media reports said Silva had missed Monday's final training session ahead of the game at the Parc des Princes and would not make the 18-man squad named by coach Unai Emery. Silva watched his teammates do their work while sat on an icebox. The 32-year-old had already missed last Friday's 3-0 win at Bordeaux in Ligue 1 with a minor muscle problem but had been expected to be ready in time to face the Spanish giants. PSG, who are looking to reach the quarter-finals for the fifth season in succession, are also without ex-Barcelona midfielder Thiago Motta due to suspension. However, Argentine playmaker Javier Pastore could feature. Silva's place in central defence may be filled by the young Presnel Kimpembe alongside Marquinhos with Blaise Matuidi set to inherit the captain's armband."
686,13/02/2017,14:55,Cavani and Suarez head to head,"Born in the same Uruguayan city of Salto just one month apart, Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani have gone on to become two of the world's leading strikers and will go up against each other when Paris Saint-Germain face Barcelona on Tuesday.","When asked about his relationship with Suarez ahead of the game on Monday, PSG hotshot Cavani described the Barcelona man as his friend but insisted the two are very different attackers. ""Luis is very physical, he uses his body a lot. I am different, I don't move as much as him,"" said Cavani, who will celebrate his 30th birthday on the day of the UEFA Champions League last 16, first leg at the Parc des Princes. Here AFP Sports compares the two Uruguayan stars: EDINSON CAVANI (Paris Saint-Germain) Date of birth: 14/2/87 Clubs: Danubio, Palermo, Napoli, Paris Saint-Germain (since July 2013) International caps/goals: 89/37 International honours: Copa America 2011 Honours with PSG: Three Ligue 1 titles, two French Cups, three French League Cups Goal-scoring record for PSG: 114 goals in all competitions (second only to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, on 156, on club's all-time list); 33 in all competitions this season (25 in Ligue 1, 6 in Champions League, 2 in League Cup) LUIS SUAREZ (Barcelona) Date of birth: 24/1/87 Clubs: Nacional, Groningen, Ajax, Liverpool, Barcelona (since July 2014) International caps/goals: 90/47 International honours: Copa America 2011 Honours with Barcelona: One UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Super Cup, one FIFA Club World Cup, Two La Liga titles, Copa del Rey twice Goal-scoring record for Barcelona: 109 goals in all competitions; 25 in all competitions this season (18 in La Liga, 2 in Champions League, five in other tournaments)"
687,13/02/2017,13:52,Emery's Barcelona challenge in five figures,Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery has managed teams against Barcelona 23 times since 2007. Here is the size of his challenge in five figures as his side prepare to take on the Spanish superstars in the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday:,"Emery, who moved from Sevilla last year and has also coached Lorca, Almeria, Valencia and Spartak Moscow, has won just once against Barcelona, lost 16 times and drawn six. The 2-1 win in La Liga in October 2015 came on a day that Barcelona were playing without Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta. The woodwork saves Sevilla three times in the match. Barcelona beat Emery's side 2-0 in the final of the Copa del Rey last year. Paris Saint-Germain will be the fifth club Emery has coached against Barca. With Spanish lower league side Almeria there was one draw and one loss, Valencia four draws and six defeats, two defeats with Spartak Moscow, one win, one draw and seven defeats with Sevilla. Perhaps Emery's most exciting encounter against Barcelona came in the 2015 European Super Cup in Tblissi when the Catalan giants beat Sevilla 5-4 after extra time. Barcelona had led 4-1 in the 52nd minute but Emery's side fought back superbly to extend the game. Argentine superstar Lionel Messi has played 21 matches against Emery's sides and scored 25 goals -- as many as Emery's sides have scored against Barcelona. Barcelona have scored 58 goals in all against Emery's five teams. Paris Saint Germain are warned. The Spanish coach's season will be judged on whether he can get the French club into at least the Champions League semi-finals for the first time."
688,13/02/2017,01:30,Digne backs 'MSN' to outgun PSG once more,Lucas Digne says Barcelona's deadly strike force will again carry them past Paris Saint Germain when the teams meet at the Parc des Princes in the Champions League last-16 on Tuesday.,"At just 23, left-back Digne has already experienced the demands at the top level with PSG in his homeland and Roma in Italy, but nothing comes close to the demands he faces day-to-day since joining Barcelona in July. ""When you are a competitor, you always want to win. This locker room was born for that, this club is made for that,"" Digne told AFP in an exclusive interview. ""Every year you have to win trophies and that's how it is. That's what we are playing for. ""All players dream of winning trophies, it is that adrenaline that we seek."" Digne already has the Spanish Super Cup from this season to add to the eight trophies he won in just two years at PSG. However, much bigger challenges and prizes await with Barca in search of a second treble in three years. Luis Enrique's men travel to the French capital for the first leg of their Champions League last 16 clash on Tuesday just one point off the top of La Liga and already having booked their place in the final of the Copa del Rey. Digne was on the losing side when Barca propelled themselves towards a fifth European Cup by sweeping aside PSG 5-1 on aggregate at the quarter-final stage two years ago. Luis Suarez and Neymar combined for the goals in that tie, but Lionel Messi remains the senior partner in Barca's frightening 'MSN' front three. ""Leo is magic. He is the best player in the world,"" added Digne. ""When you have the best forwards in the world, it can always make a difference. ""The goal of football is to score goals, so if you have the best attack, for sure it helps."" Despite an outlay totalling hundreds of millions of euros, PSG are yet to break the glass ceiling of the last eight in the Champions League since owners Qatar Sports Investments took control of the club six years ago. Domestic dominance wasn't enough to save Laurent Blanc his job at the end of last season as the owners tired of European failure with Sevilla's three-time winning Europa League coach Unai Emery put in place. But Digne believes even more time is needed for PSG to break into the Champions League elite. ""The history of a club is very important. I think we have to give them time to build. ""The fact that they have changed staff, they are in full construction of a new project so we must give them time."" Digne's decision to move to the Camp Nou with his career trajectory on the rise was questioned with Spanish international and Catalan native Jordi Alba standing in his way of a regular starting place at left-back. Yet, Barca boss Luis Enrique's desire to rotate has meant he has already made 20 appearances this season. ""I've played a lot, I've played important matches. I'm at the biggest club in the world at 23 years old,"" he added. ""A lot of people would like to be where I am today and I'm really happy about that. ""I said that it was a dream to play for this club and that it would be really great for me to have an experience like this. ""Today I am lucky enough to be able to do so. It was in the back of my mind to be able to reach the highest level. Having such a chance is a wonderful thing for me."""
689,13/02/2017,01:28,"Emery, PSG look to get one over Barcelona at last",Paris Saint-Germain host Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday with their Spanish coach Unai Emery desperate to improve his awful personal record against the Catalans.,"Emery was brought to the French capital last year as the successor to Laurent Blanc in order to help take PSG to the next level in Europe after four consecutive quarter-final exits in the Champions League. But finishing second in their group behind Arsenal exposed PSG to a tougher draw in the first knockout round and now they must beat the Spanish champions -- the second leg will be at the Camp Nou next month -- just to make it to the last eight again. Emery, the former Sevilla boss, has come up against Barcelona 23 times in his coaching career and won just once, in La Liga last season. Paris, meanwhile, have been knocked out of the Champions League by Barcelona twice in recent campaigns, losing in the quarter-finals in 2013 and again in 2015 to Lionel Messi, Neymar and co. But there is a new-found confidence at the Parc des Princes after a fine start to 2017 which has seen them win 10 and draw one of their last 11 games in all competitions. ""We believe in ourselves and this game comes at a good time for us. If it had come at the start of the season I would have been more worried, but everything has changed,"" PSG's Italian midfielder Marco Verratti said after Friday's 3-0 win at Bordeaux in Ligue 1, in which Edinson Cavani scored twice. The French champions have beaten Barcelona in the recent past, claiming a 3-2 win in the group stage in September 2014. They are also a formidable proposition at the Parc des Princes, having lost just once there in Europe in the last decade. ""It's a huge challenge. Simply put, we will have to play two huge matches,"" Brazilian left-back Maxwell, a former Barcelona player, told PSG's website. ""No-one enters this competition hoping to cross paths with them. Still, it's up to us to make the difference."" Emery will be unable to utilise veteran midfielder Thiago Motta, another ex-Barcelona player, due to suspension. Meanwhile, one winger from Angel Di Maria, Lucas Moura and January signing Julian Draxler will have to settle for a place on the bench. Barcelona travel to France buoyed by a crushing 6-0 win at Alaves in La Liga at the weekend in which Luis Suarez scored twice. That result means Luis Enrique's side have now lost just once in 22 games although it was overshadowed by an awful ankle injury suffered by right-back Aleix Vidal which rules him out for the rest of the season. Javier Mascherano and Arda Turan are sidelined too, although one man who could feature is Rafinha, who was named in the squad but will need a mask to protect a broken nose. Barcelona are still fighting on three fronts, keeping alive the prospect of another La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League treble to match those achieved in 2009 and 2015. ""It's not really something we talk about amongst ourselves but all the players have it in mind,"" the club's former PSG defender Lucas Digne told AFP. ""As long as we are still in every competition, it is very important. This club is born to win trophies."""
690,10/02/2017,13:43,PSG can compete on Barca's level - Di Maria,"Paris Saint-Germain should have no fear of another Champions League clash with Barcelona despite a poor record against the Spanish champions ahead of their last 16 meeting on Tuesday, insists PSG winger Angel di Maria.","Barca have held the upper hand in six previous meetings over the past five seasons, losing just once and progressing to the semi-finals from their two quarter-final clashes in 2013 and 2015. However, ahead of Barca's latest trip to the French capital, Di Maria, who experienced plenty of El Clasico highs and lows against the Catalans in four seasons with Real Madrid, believes PSG now have the quality to compete with the Spanish giants for a first ever European crown. ""PSG have players of enormous quality. People like Marco Verratti, who is wanted by Real Madrid and Barcelona, give the team something extra,"" Di Maria told Madrid sports daily Marca on Friday. ""When he isn't there, the team feels (his absence). I think that PSG can easily compete with Madrid or Barcelona."" However, to make the last eight, PSG face the daunting task of restricting Barca's fearsome 'MSN' front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar. Suarez and Neymar did the damage in the last tie between the sides, scoring all five of Barca's goals in a 5-1 aggregate rout, but it is his Argentine international teammate Di Maria fears most. ""Barca have great players. The MSN is the best attack right now,"" he added. ""Leo is different from the rest. ""I think to stop him it requires the whole team because when he doesn't do something magical he leaves a teammate free."""

I am here to give my all and try to get into Europe, which is the dream and hope all Canary Islanders have."" Jese joined the French champions on a five-year deal in August for a reported 25 million euros ($26.8 million) from Real Madrid, but scored just twice in 14 appearances for Unai Emery's side this season. ""Money doesn't bring all the happiness in the world. I want to be happy playing football, doing my best and showing my qualities,"" added Jese on the perceived step down from Madrid and PSG. ""I didn't triumph (at PSG) for various reasons. The coach there opted for other players and I never had the chance to start a run of games."" Las Palmas sit 11th in La Liga, but could still make a late push for European football next season as they trail sixth-placed Villarreal by just six points. ""What we have to do is enjoy having Jese,"" Las Palmas coach Quique Setien said after his side beat Valencia 3-1 on Monday. ""There is no better place than home at the moment for him to recover his self-belief."""
692,24/12/2016,12:25,Draxler joining PSG - Wolfsburg,Germany forward Julian Draxler will move from Wolfsburg to Paris Saint Germain in January ending a long-standing transfer battle with the Bundesliga side.,"German and French media gave a transfer fee of between 36 million and 40 million euros ($37.5 million - $42 million). The clubs did not give financial details of the deal but Draxler will sign a four and a half year contract in January, Wolfsburg said. The move had been expected after the 23-year-old World Cup winner publicly said he wanted to quit Wolfsburg. His attitude had caused tensions at Wolfsburg. ""Those who want to leave should be allowed to go. It should have already been settled in the summer!"" said teammate Mario Gomez. ""This kind of attitude always brings confusion in a team,"" Wolfsburg coach Valerien Ismael commented recently. The French champions were just one of several clubs on the trail of the player known for his speed and dribbling ability. ""We have had intense and constructive discussions with Julian Draxler and his management as well as with Paris Saint-Germain in recent days and finally achieved a very good result for all sides,"" Wolfsburg's head of sport Olaf Rebbe said in a club statement. ""Of course I am sad to see Julian go, because he is an outstanding player,"" Ismael added in the statement. ""On the other hand, I think this is the right move for everyone. ""In both recent games against Frankfurt and Gladbach he once again gave everything he had, and showed that he cares about our club. I hope he finds a new challenge in France."" Draxler cost Wolfsburg 35 million euros when he transferred from Schalke in August 2015. But he never really settled. PSG director of football Patrick Kluivert has been on the lookout for reinforcements after a poor start to the campaign by the French side. PSG are third place in Ligue 1 at the halfway stage, five points behind leaders Nice. PSG must also face Barcelona in the last 16 of the Champions League. Draxler will compete with Angel di Maria, Hatem Ben Arta and Lucas for a place on the PSG wings. Bild newspaper published a photo of Draxler with Kluivert holding a PSG shirt with the number 23. The German player must still undergo a medical before signing after the transfer market opens on January 1."

695,09/12/2016,02:15,Pressure on Emery as PSG meet Nice in summit clash,Unai Emery is once again a coach under pressure as his Paris Saint-Germain side prepare to face Nice on Sunday looking to close the gap on the surprise Ligue 1 leaders.,"A 12-game unbeaten run had appeared the perfect response to early-season criticism of Emery at PSG, but in the last week the Spaniard has seen his side humbled 3-0 by Montpellier and then left to scramble a 2-2 draw with Ludogorets in the Champions League. After two such worrying performances, it is debatable whether Emery could even survive a defeat at home to Nice, which would leave the defending champions seven points adrift of the southern upstarts with the season's halfway stage approaching. ""It is a difficult spell, but we will show a reaction on Sunday in what is a huge match for us,"" insisted midfielder Blaise Matuidi, just about the only PSG player deserving of pass marks against Ludogorets. PSG needed a late Angel di Maria equaliser to avoid defeat at home to the Bulgarians after a lacklustre display but the result meant they finished second in Champions League Group A to Arsenal. ""This disappointment must give us the desire to lift our hands and show a different face in the last 16. We must improve, and that starts on Sunday against Nice,"" said Emery in his still stumbling French. PSG have Adrien Rabiot and Javier Pastore on the sidelines while Di Maria is in wretched form, so they may look to Hatem Ben Arfa for creative inspiration against the club for whom he starred last season. Without him, the side from the Cote d'Azur -- with a reported budget less than a tenth of PSG's -- have gone from strength to strength this season under Lucien Favre and they have topped the table since mid-September. They have only lost once in the league all season and impressed in beating Toulouse 3-0 last weekend to hold a three-point lead over Monaco and a four-point advantage over the capital giants. Mario Balotelli is in line to feature after making his comeback from a month on the sidelines with a calf injury in Thursday's Europa League meeting with Russian outfit Krasnodar. Monaco travel to Bordeaux on Saturday knowing a win would take them provisionally top of the table, above Nice on goal difference. Leonardo Jardim's prolific side are still running at an average of more than three goals per game and were able to rest key players for Wednesday's Champions League defeat to Bayer Leverkusen in Germany having already qualified for the last 16 as group winners. They are targeting the symbolic title of topping the table at the year's end and striker Valere Germain said: ""It would be nice to be autumn champions and we will give everything in the final matches of the year to do that."" Lyon will aim to bounce back from the disappointment of being eliminated from the Champions League after failing to get the better of Sevilla as they host Rennes. Rennes are fourth but have struggled away from home this season and Lyon can leapfrog them with a win. Bruno Genesio's men also have a game in hand after their match at Metz last weekend was abandoned when firecrackers were thrown at OL goalkeeper Anthony Lopes, leaving him with ""acoustic trauma"" but no lasting damage. Nantes, who are in the relegation zone, will have new coach Sergio Conceicao watching from the stands when they host Caen on Saturday. Conceicao, the 42-year-old former Portugal winger, was in charge of Vitoria Guimaraes last season. Fixtures (kick-offs 1900 GMT unless stated)"

Twice former European champions Benfica pulled a goal back late on through Raul Jimenez and qualified as runners-up. ""We reached our objective, we wanted to win the group and we did it with a splendid performance here in Lisbon,"" said Callejon. In the group's other game, Besiktas travelled to Ukraine hopeful of advancing after their rousing three-goal fightback on matchday five against Benfica, but the Turkish champions unravelled in a disastrous first half. Artem Besedin bundled in Dynamo's opener on nine minutes at the Olympic Stadium and Besiktas suffered a critical blow on the half hour with Andreas Beck sent off for a professional foul on Derlis Gonzalez. Andriy Yarmolenko converted the resulting penalty and the hosts struck twice more before the break through Vitaliy Buyalskiy and Paraguayan Gonzalez to floor the visitors. Frustrations boiled over as Cameroon striker Vincent Aboubakar was dismissed for a second yellow card on 56 minutes and a miserable evening grew even more humiliating with Serhiy Sydorchuk and Junior Moraes adding their names to the scoresheet. ""We are very, very upset and you can see it from every player's face in the dressing room. We want to forget this game and want to represent Turkey in the best possible way in the Europa League now,"" said Besiktas captain Oguzhan Ozyakup. Lucas Perez grabbed his first hat-trick in an Arsenal shirt as Arsene Wenger's side thumped Basel 4-1 in Switzerland to pip French champions PSG to top spot in their group. Hobbled by an ankle injury, Perez has played sparingly since his arrival from Deportivo la Coruna in August, but the Spaniard was gifted two simple finishes as the Gunners dominated at St. Jakob-Park. The Spaniard slotted home his third on 47 minutes and Mesut Ozil set up Alex Iwobi to score a fourth before Seydou Doumbia notched a consolation for Basel. Ludogorets claimed a memorable point and a place in the Europa League with a 2-2 draw at the Parc des Princes where they twice led on a frustrating evening for Unai Emery's hosts. Virgil Misidjan headed the Bulgarian outfit into an early advantage, but Edinson Cavani's superb acrobatic effort brought PSG level on the hour. A mistake from Brazilian centre-back Marquinhos allowed Jonathan Cafu to tee up Wanderson to put Ludogorets back on top, with Angel Di Maria's stoppage-time strike not enough to prevent Arsenal climbing above Paris. ""It's a disappointment. We played a good match at Arsenal (in November) and came back in first place. I think the team deserved to win, but that's football,"" said PSG coach Emery. Turkey midfielder Arda Turan hit a quickfire second-half hat-trick to propel Barcelona to a 4-0 win at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach in Group C with Lionel Messi also on target for the Catalan giants. Celtic's Patrick Roberts scored a terrific solo effort against parent club Manchester City in a 1-1 draw at the Etihad Stadium. Kelechi Iheanacho staked his claim to a longer run in Pep Guardiola's first team -- with Sergio Aguero facing a four-match ban -- as the Nigerian struck a fine equaliser. Robert Lewandowski's stunning first-half free-kick ended Atletico Madrid's bid for a perfect six group wins from six as Bayern Munich won 1-0 at the Allianz Arena. Rostov will continue their European adventure in the Europa League after finishing third in Group D following a goalless draw at PSV Eindhoven."
697,24/11/2016,04:10,"Arsenal have lost momentum, admits frustrated Wenger",Arsene Wenger admits Arsenal have lost momentum and look destined for a frustrating second-placed finish in their Champions League group after being held to a 2-2 draw against Paris Saint-Germain.,"Wenger's side were on course to wrap up top spot in Group A when they led 2-1 late in the second half at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday. But Lucas's 77th minute header was deflected into his own net by Gunners winger Alex Iwobi and Arsenal were unable to find a winner. That leaves the north Londoners level on points with PSG but behind them on a head-to-head record, meaning the French team will take first place if they win their last group match, against minnows Ludogorets on December 6. Arsenal travel to Basel on the same night and Wenger conceded it doesn't look likely they will take pole position following their third successive draw in all competitions, meaning they will probably get a tougher tie in the knock-out stages. ""It's not over, but we have a 90 percent chance to finish second,"" Wenger said. ""We wanted to finish first. We haven't lost a game in this group so we have done well, but we haven't finished the job. ""We dropped off after it was 2-1. We didn't maintain the pressure and paid for that. ""It's frustrating. We were a bit passive on the corner for their second goal."" Arsenal know only too well how damaging it can be to finish second as a series of tough draws have led to six consecutive last-16 exits. But Wenger tried to remain upbeat and insisted the quality of some of the teams finishing second meant even group winners couldn't be guaranteed an easy draw. ""Will it be bad for us? We have to wait and see,"" he said. ""If you finish first you play the second game at home, but you look at the groups and it's difficult to tell what is better. ""For me it's more frustrating not to win the game but they are a team with top technical quality."" After a strong run that raised hopes of sustained challenges for silverware at home and abroad, Arsenal have looked lethargic in lucky draws against Manchester United and PSG. Wenger knows his side have been below their best over the last week, but he doesn't expect the dip to last. ""We have not lost but we have lost a winning momentum a little bit,"" he said. ""There is a special spirit in the squad. We are unbeaten for 18 games and sometimes you go through a period where you are a little bit less effective. ""It's up to us to transform the draws into wins, but there is no reason to panic."" PSG could easily have finished with victory as Edinson Cavani squandered two late chances, but boss Unai Emery was happy enough with a polished performance that puts his side's European destiny in their own hands. ""If we are to analyse the two matches against Arsenal I think that we deserve to be first at the moment,"" he said. ""It was a good test and I'm pleased with the way the team responded. ""Arsenal have some good players and are set up well. We did very well against them and our best players showed great personality. ""The players met my expectations. It was a terrific performance and it's important now that we build on this in our next fixtures."""

699,22/11/2016,16:09,Aurier barred from UK for Arsenal tie - PSG,Paris Saint-Germain defender Serge Aurier has been barred from Britain and will miss the club's Champions League tie against Arsenal on Wednesday after British authorities revoked his visa.,"The French champions called the decision ""incomprehensible"" but Britain's Interior Ministry said it was acting according to established immigration rules. ""Paris Saint-Germain is stunned by this incomprehensible situation that attacks the very integrity of the UEFA Champions League,"" the club said on Tuesday, adding it was because of Aurier's September conviction for assaulting a police officer outside a Paris nightclub. The French champions made clear their anger with British authorities, especially because they said they were only informed of the final decision on Tuesday lunchtime, calling that ""a flagrant lack of respect for the club"". ""After an initial application on October 18, complete with all the necessary documents, the British authorities had originally granted Paris Saint-Germain's Ivory Coast international an entry visa to the UK on October 21,"" PSG said. ""However, on November 16, his visa was finally revoked by the British Ministry of the Interior, who justified their about-face by citing Aurier's conviction."" PSG, who face Arsenal with top spot up for grabs in Group A, said that they lobbied against the decision to no avail and were further angered by the fact that the final ruling came so late. The 23-year-old Aurier has not spent any time in prison, despite being sentenced to two months for the assault, and has filed an appeal against the decision. However, Britain's Interior Ministry stood by its decision. ""Mr Aurier received a two month custodial sentence in September for assaulting a police officer. The immigration rules clearly state that non-EU nationals who have received a custodial sentence of less than 12 months within the last five years will be refused on criminality grounds,"" a statement from the ministry said. However Andrew Osborne, head of immigration and joint head of sport at London-based law firm Lewis Silkin, criticised a ""harsh decision"" that he said was another example of the British government's 'hostile' immigration policy. ""Given that the player has given full disclosure of the offence, that he will only be in the UK for a very short period and that he has an outstanding appeal this seems a harsh decision,"" said Osborne. ""The timing of the initial approval and then late change of heart to revoke the visa is also tough and causes PSG maximum difficulty. This looks like another example of the 'hostile' immigration environment that the current Government want to cultivate."" Aurier's failure to make it for the Arsenal showdown is just the latest chapter in his colourful career. He made a throat-slitting gesture to the crowd during a World Cup qualifier last month after his cross was inadvertently turned into his own net by a Mali player in an Ivory Coast victory, prompting a FIFA investigation. Aurier also got in trouble last season after making derogatory comments about his then-PSG coach Laurent Blanc and other team-mates, including current Manchester United star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, on a social media video post. He was suspended for five weeks but owned up to having committed ""a stupid mistake"". The assault conviction came after he was stopped in May when leaving a nightclub in the early hours of the morning in the French capital. The court heard that the troubled footballer refused to cooperate with police when asked to leave his tinted-glass Porsche Cayenne, which police said was incorrectly parked outside the club in an upmarket district of Paris. Police said the situation turned violent when an agitated Aurier elbowed one of the officers in the chest. In its strongly worded statement on Tuesday, PSG said: ""The club has argued several times that since the player has launched a legal appeal against the criminal ruling, he is therefore entitled to the presumption of innocence, as any other person exercising their right to appeal. ""Paris Saint-Germain strongly regrets that the presumption of innocence has not influenced Britain's decision."" UEFA had also supported PSG in its attempts to get Aurier into Britain for Wednesday's game, the club added."
700,22/11/2016,02:00,Top spot at stake as Arsenal host PSG,"worldfootball looks ahead to Wednesday's Champions League action with Arsenal v Paris Saint-Germain the plum tie while Barcelona, Manchester City and Bayern Munich all face challenging away games (kick-offs 1945 GMT unless stated):","<strong>Group A</strong> at London Arsenal (ENG) v Paris Saint-Germain (FRA) The Gunners will be out to put one over the French champions, whom they held 1-1 in Paris, as both struggle for top spot in Group A, the pair having already booked passage to the knockout phase. The Londoners could look to Olivier Giroud, who rescued a point from the bench at Old Trafford, to spearhead their attack after Alexis Sanchez played through hamstring trouble. As Arsenal drew with Manchester United to leave them fourth in the Premier League, PSG warmed up for Wednesday with a fourth straight win, 2-0 over Nantes, as they chase down French leaders Nice. PSG's Old Trafford misfit Angel Di Maria scored against Nantes but came off in the first half with a thigh injury, albeit not one expected to keep him out. Argentine playmaker Javier Pastore is set to miss the trip to London with a knee problem. Ludogorets (BUL) v Basel (SUI) at Sofia Bulgarians Ludogorets and Basel have proved the makeweights in Group A with both garnering a solitary point to date. A Europa League spot is the consolation prize that awaits the side that can cement third place. The two parted 1-1 in the first meeting in Switzerland. Previous encounters saw the Swiss win handsomely in a two-leg playoff three years ago. Ludogorets will be slight favourites, courtesy of home advantage, and they gave Arsenal a brief scare in their last outing, but let slip a two-goal lead to succumb 3-2. <strong>Group B</strong> Napoli (ITA) v Dynamo Kiev (UKR) at Naples Napoli might just about top the group but they are locked in a three-way struggle with Benfica and Besiktas for two places in the last 16. They came from behind to see off Kiev in Ukraine in the reverse fixture and badly need three points here. Their weekend 2-1 win at Udinese kept them in touch with the top four in Serie A, though prolific striker Arkadiusz Milik is still out injured. Lorenzo Insigne grabbed a brace at Udinese and the Italians will be looking to him and Jose Callejon to fire them past Dynamo, the whipping boys of the group with just one point. Besiktas (TUR) v Benfica (POR) at Istanbul (Kick-off at 1745 GMT) Benfica, level on points with Napoli, travel to Turkey's still-unbeaten Besiktas, who are just a point adrift of the top pair. A Benfica victory will take the two-time champions, top in the Portuguese league, through to the knock-out phase. But they cannot afford to be complacent against a Besiktas side which held them to a draw in Lisbon. The Turkish champions are looking to get out of the pool phase for the first time in six attempts and their fans are sure to give Benfica a hostile reception. <strong>Group C</strong> Celtic (SCO) v Barcelona (ESP) at Glasgow Top spot is still up for grabs in Group C as Barcelona, two points clear of Manchester City, travel to a Celtic side they squashed 7-0 at the Camp Nou. A win for Lionel Messi and Co. -- he is set to return after a sickness bug at the weekend -- will see the Spanish champions into the last 16, though a draw might also do it depending on the other game. Luis Suarez will be back from suspension, which is bad news for a Celtic side who are two points adrift at the bottom of the group. The Scottish giants warmed up for Barca with a 1-0 win over Kilmarnock which left them 13 points clear in their domestic league. Borussia Moenchengladbach (GER) v Manchester City (ENG) at Moenchengladbach, Germany City's Yaya Toure-inspired weekend win at Crystal Palace keeps them a point off leaders Chelsea in the Premier League. But it is at the back that they have worries, particularly the fitness of talisman centre-back Vincent Kompany, who suffered a head injury in a collision with keeper Claudio Bravo at Palace. Victory in Germany for Pep Guardiola's side will see them into the next round. The home side look on course for a Europa League slot and need to pull off a surprise win if they are to have any hope of making further progress in this competition. On current form that looks a tall order after successive domestic losses, to Cologne and Hertha Berlin, sent them into the bottom six in the Bundesliga. <strong>Group D</strong> Rostov (RUS) v Bayern Munich (GER) at Rostov, Russia (Kick-off 1700 GMT) Five-time European champions Bayern head to Russia's Rostov for their Group D clash licking their wounds after being knocked from the top of the Bundesliga. Their 1-0 defeat at Dortmund on Saturday allowed RB Leipzig to finish the weekend top of the German league table. Bayern are already into the last 16 but need a win at Rostov to stay in touch with group leaders Atletico Madrid, who they host on December 6 for a potential top-spot decider. Bayern will be without injured keeper Manuel Neuer, meaning Sven Ulreich will deputise. Rock-bottom Rostov and PSV have a single point each so are locked in a struggle for a Europa League place only. The Russians have a solid home record and held Rubin Kazan to a goalless draw on Friday. Atletico Madrid (ESP) v PSV Eindhoven (NED) at Madrid Atletico might already be through and top of the group, but they are on a poor run in the Spanish league. Beaten finalists in two of the last three editions of the Champions League, the Spaniards will qualify as group winners if they win and Bayern do worse. Coach Diego Simeone seems to be losing his iron grip a tad and success built on a rock-solid defence appears to be slipping. Phillip Cocu's PSV will be massive underdogs nonetheless and they only drew 0-0 at lowly Willem II at the weekend in domestic action, with their Dutch championship hopes evaporating slowly."
701,26/09/2016,17:07,PSG defender sentenced to jail for police assault,Paris Saint-Germain defender Serge Aurier was sentenced to two months in jail by a court in Paris on Monday for assaulting a police officer.,"But the 23-year-old will not serve any time in prison as he is appealing his sentence which was less than one year. The Ivory Coast international was later included in PSG coach Unai Emery's squad for Wednesday's Champions League tie at Ludogorets in Bulgaria. The incident occurred on May 30 outside a Paris nightclub when Aurier was arrested and placed in police custody. The court heard that the troubled footballer refused to cooperate when asked to leave his tinted-glass Porsche Cayenne which police claimed was incorrectly parked outside the club in the early hours in an upmarket district of the French capital. Police said the situation turned violent when an agitated Aurier elbowed one of the officers in the chest, causing him to have to take a day off work. ""The driver got out of the car straight away and apologised but the front passenger (Aurier) refused to show his hands,"" the policeman told the court. He said he had to grab Aurier to make him exit the car, at which point the player elbowed him. Aurier denied the charge and was allowed to leave the court. ""The club takes note of his condemnation. An appeal has been lodged at the end of the hearing by the player's lawyer,"" said a PSG statement. ""Serge Aurier will continue to benefit from the presumption of innocence ahead of the appeal court's decision."" Aurier later took to Twitter to express his ""confidence in justice"" and that he would await ""the appeal ... to express myself again"". The player, who has had recent disciplinary problems with his club, rejected the police account of the incident and said he was the victim of violence. He has filed a complaint against the police. Given his lack of remorse, the court went beyond the prosecutor's request for a sentence of two months suspended or with community service. The sentence took into account Aurier's four previous convictions for driving without a licence. The court also ordered him to pay 600 euros $674) in damages and interest as well as 1,500 euros in court costs. He was described by the public prosecutor as having ""lacked lucidity"" during the incident and acted in a ""puerile and immature"" manner. Aurier, who said in court he earns 200,000 euros a month, was in trouble with his club last season after making derogatory comments about his then-PSG coach Laurent Blanc and other team-mates, including current Manchester United star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, on a social media video post. He was suspended by his club for five weeks but owned up to having committed ""a stupid mistake"". However, when filming a video to apologise for his comments, Aurier behaved in an ""indifferent"" manner and needed several takes to get his apology right, according to France Football magazine. PSG owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi even yelled at him that he would ""stay five hours if necessary, but you'll do what we ask"", added the magazine. The year before, Aurier copped a three-match ban from UEFA after reacting to a PSG victory in the Champions League by posting a video on Facebook in which he called the referee a ""son of a bitch"". But since returning to pre-season training in July, Aurier has impressed his bosses. ""The club wants to underline the player's professional attitude shown since his return on July 4. ""At the same time, Paris Saint-Germain reaffirms our affection and respect for the forces of order and the jobs they do."" However, his court appearance comes on the back of Aurier being sent off in PSG's 2-0 Ligue 1 defeat at Toulouse on Friday night, their second reverse of the season."
702,19/09/2016,16:15,Ben Arfa again stranded on PSG sidelines,Hatem Ben Arfa's future at Paris Saint-Germain looks increasingly bleak after the France international winger was again left out of the squad by coach Unai Emery for Ligue 1 action on Tuesday.,"Champions PSG take on newly promoted Dijon at the Parc des Princes lying three points shy of early Ligue 1 pacesetters Monaco, who host second-placed Nice on Wednesday. This is the third consecutive game that Emery has not picked Ben Arfa, who arrived at PSG in the summer from Nice, the Spanish coach justifying his squad selection by saying it was a ""purely sporting decision"". Ben Arfa, 29, has already missed out on the 1-1 draw with Arsenal in the Champions League and the 6-0 league thrashing of Caen last week. ""I'm preparing the team that I think to be the best to play the match,"" Emery said. ""He's a player like the others, I think that the players in the squad today are those who have best prepared for tomorrow's game,"" said Emery, who explained earlier this month that Ben Arfa needed to ""work more"". Victory for PSG would lift them back onto the summit -- at least for 24 hours -- ahead of the top-of-the-table clash between Monaco and Nice. Monaco followed up their shock 2-1 win over Tottenham in the Champions League at Wembley last week with a 3-0 defeat of Rennes to leave them top of the Ligue 1 pile on 13 points. A double from Thomas Lemar and a towering Radamel Falcao header -- the Colombian's first goal for his club since August 2014 -- helped them see off the Brittany outfit and leapfrog PSG. Monaco are seeking their eighth consecutive win against a Nice side only two points behind and featuring newly recruited playmaker Younes Belhanda. The on-loan Dynamo Kiev forward's late strike in last weekend's 1-1 draw with Montpellier helped the Cote d'Azur side maintain their unbeaten start to the campaign. Italian striker Mario Balotelli is due to return after the former Liverpool, Man City and AC Milan star sat out the Montpellier stalemate. The midweek programme is wrapped up by Marseille -- who have only one win from their first five outings -- on the road at Rennes. Marseille were a sad imitation of their former best in a drab goalless draw against Lyon on Sunday when they failed to muster a shot on target. Watching the unappetising encounter from the Stade Velodrome directors' box was American tycoon Frank McCourt, the future owner of the ailing club. ""He's going to spark something and so much the better for us,"" said Marseille sporting director Basile Boli after meeting the 63-year-old former owner of baseball team Los Angeles Dodgers at the Lyon game. McCourt held informal talks with the French league's financial watchdog (DNCG) on Monday. Once the sale is concluded he will have a second, formal meeting with the DNCG."
703,13/09/2016,22:46,Sanchez rescues draw for Arsenal in Paris,Alexis Sanchez struck with 12 minutes left as Arsenal came from behind to earn an unlikely 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain in their Champions League opener on Tuesday.,"PSG had led virtually from kick-off, an Edinson Cavani header opening the scoring as the clock ticked onto 42 seconds at the Parc des Princes. The goal was PSG's quickest ever in the Champions League, but the French champions, and Cavani in particular, were guilty of failing to convert a succession of golden opportunities. Chilean forward Sanchez made them pay as he netted the equaliser before both sides ended the game with 10 men after Olivier Giroud and Marco Verratti were each sent off at the death. The result puts Arsenal in a strong position in Group A, with the other game in the section also ending in a 1-1 draw between Basel and Ludogorets Razgrad. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger sprung a surprise in his line-up as he selected David Ospina in goal and left first-choice Petr Cech on the bench. Meanwhile, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Alex Iwobi both started with Theo Walcott missing due to injury. PSG coach Unai Emery, under pressure after a poor start to the season, made a number of changes to his team too, including recalling Serge Aurier in defence, and the Ivorian was the source of the early opener. With the Arsenal defence still settling, Aurier powered forward from right-back and delivered a cross that was met by a flick of the head from Cavani at the near post, enough to beat Ospina and find the net. It was a dream start for the French champions, quarter-finalists in each of the last four seasons, and for Cavani as he seeks to step up and assume the responsibility of leading the attack following the departure of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Uruguayan has always racked up the goals, but he also has a habit of conjuring breathtaking misses and he squandered two golden chances to increase PSG's lead before the interval. First, after showing admirable determination to beat his man to the ball on the edge of the area, he rounded Ospina only to see his shot slip just wide of the post with the goal gaping in the 34th minute. Then, with half-time approaching, he controlled a delightfully flighted pass into the box by Angel Di Maria only to tumble embarrassingly to the ground while attempting a spectacular finish with only the 'keeper to beat. Before that, only an alert piece of goalkeeping by Ospina prevented Di Maria from scoring direct from a wickedly delivered corner, and Arsenal were lucky to go in at the break just one goal behind. PSG's inability to convert their chances meant the Gunners remained in the game, and Ospina played his part by making decisive interventions in front of Cavani and Di Maria in the second half. Alphonse Areola, playing in goal for PSG for the first time in more than three years, did not have a save to make until the 78th minute, when he blocked brilliantly from Iwobi's close-range effort, Arsenal's first shot on target all evening. There was nothing he could do, though, to keep out the follow-up from Sanchez. That goal ensured a share of the points, although both teams had chances to win, with Ospina again thwarting Cavani before Areola denied Iwobi at the other end. Giroud and Verratti were both shown second yellow cards in stoppage time for a childish scuffle off the ball."
704,12/09/2016,16:20,Verratti tells Balotelli to get serious,Paris Saint Germain's Italian midfielder Marco Verratti has challenged troubled Ligue 1 new boy Mario Balotelli to concentrate on his football all week long and not just on matchdays.,"The former AC Milan, Manchester City and Liverpool striker scored twice on his debut for French outfit Nice on Sunday, where he is trying to resurrect his floundering career. And the gloves were off when Italy international Verratti was asked what he thought of his compatriot. ""I just hope he realises that football is not just 90 minutes, but an all week long thing,"" Verratti said at the PSG training ground. ""He's a good player who has always had a problem with his mentality. But I do know he's a good guy."" The midfield enforcer was on the same side as Balotelli at the 2014 World Cup, where the striker had been tipped to peak but was instead one of the major disappointments of the tournament. The 26-year-old signed a one-year deal at the Allianz Riviera after being allowed to leave Anfield on a free transfer. He struck twice on his debut to help Nice beat Mediterranean rivals Marseille 3-2 in Ligue 1 on Sunday."
705,12/09/2016,02:10,PSG's Emery with all to prove in Champions League,"Unai Emery arrived in France with a reputation as one of Europe's brightest coaching talents, but he admits that he has moved out of his ""comfort zone"" by taking the Paris Saint-Germain job.","The 44-year-old Spaniard leads the French giants into their Champions League opener against Arsenal at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday knowing the outcome could prove crucial in determining who wins Group A. Certainly in a section also featuring Basel and Ludogorets Razgrad, nobody at PSG is envisaging anything other than progress to the knockout stage for a club who have reached four successive quarter-finals. Indeed, going beyond the last eight, while also dominating domestically, is the only way Emery can improve on the job done by his ousted predecessor Laurent Blanc. ""I've arrived at a club that want to keep on winning and to kick on to the next level. That's the challenge and it's a difficult one,"" Emery said in an interview with UEFA.com last week. ""Here the requirement is to win and the players are aware of that. And that is not easy. That demands a lot of mental effort from me, the players and the club."" A coach as intense as Emery is not afraid to put in the work, although he must be aware that he has put his reputation on the line by coming to Paris. Losing at home is unthinkable for a club that have won every domestic trophy in the last two years, and their unconvincing start to the season has brought inevitable criticism. PSG's inability to rise above that glass ceiling of the quarter-finals in the Champions League was what led to Blanc's downfall, and yet this is a competition in which Emery still has everything to prove. Winning the Europa League three years in a row with Sevilla is a remarkable achievement, and three straight third-place finishes with Valencia in La Liga before that was impressive too. But Emery's Champions League record is patchy at best. With Valencia, he lost to Schalke in the last 16 in 2011 and then went out in the group stage a year later. A previous stint abroad with Spartak Moscow lasted just a few months before he was fired in November 2012 after a poor showing in the Champions League, and Sevilla went out in the group stage last season. ""The objective is to grow and do everything in order to become a candidate to win the Champions League,"" Emery told sports daily L'Equipe in July. To do that he has to improve a team that has lost its talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Manchester United and not replaced him with a player of similar stature. Emery has overseen the arrivals of Jese, Grzegorz Krychowiak, Hatem Ben Arfa and Thomas Meunier since his appointment. All are good players, if not stars in the Zlatan mould. None has yet made an impression at the Parc des Princes. David Luiz surprisingly left to return to Chelsea on transfer deadline day -- against Emery's wishes -- and Edinson Cavani still struggles to convince having been handed the keys to the attack post-Zlatan. All of which means Emery has work to do. ""It is a challenge moving from a big team like Sevilla to another great one like PSG. Each has advantages and drawbacks, but PSG give me the chance to move out of my comfort zone,"" Emery told UEFA. It remains to be seen if Emery can export his methods abroad, even if France is not an alien place to him -- he hails from Hondarribia, the pleasant Spanish town that looks over the Bidasoa river to Hendaye in the French Basque country. He has no qualms about expressing himself in French, but the fluency is not there yet, and it is not there in PSG's play so far either. Emery's PSG remain a muddled work in progress, and Arsenal will hope to take advantage of that."

But with his position at PSG under threat from compatriot Marquinhos, new Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has brought him back to Stamford Bridge for a reported fee of 32 million pounds. ""I'm delighted to return to Chelsea. We had a fantastic story during my first time at the club and I want to help the team and Antonio Conte achieve a lot of success,"" Luiz told the Chelsea website. ""I always had a wonderful relationship with the fans and I am looking forward to wearing the blue shirt at Stamford Bridge once again."" Luiz looked in high spirits when he was pictured arriving at London's St Pancras railway station earlier in the day after travelling to the English capital from Paris via Eurostar. Dressed in a white T-shirt and black jeans while listening to music on his headphones, Luiz stopped for selfies with fans as he strolled through the station. Although he endured criticism for some haphazard defending during his first Chelsea stint, Luiz helped the club win the Champions League for the first time when they defeated Bayern Munich in the 2012 final. Luiz, who also played a key role as Chelsea won the 2012 FA Cup and 2013 Europa League, originally joined the Blues from Benfica in January 2011. He made 143 appearances, scoring 12 goals, before his record-breaking switch to PSG. Luiz has played against Chelsea four times in the two years since leaving the club as PSG were opponents in the Champions League in each of the last two seasons. He vowed not to celebrate if he scored against his former club, but did so as PSG advanced on away goals at the expense of Chelsea in March 2015. Luiz won nine trophies at PSG, including back-to-back Ligue 1, French Cup and French League Cup titles. Earlier on Wednesday, Chelsea paid a reported 23 million pounds to sign former Bolton Wanderers left-back Marcos Alonso from Fiorentina."

But the 29-year-old was in danger of losing his place to compatriot Marquinhos this season and, with new Chelsea manager Antonio Conte desperate for defensive reinforcements, the Blues have agreed to bring him back to Stamford Bridge for a reported £32 million. ""Chelsea Football Club and Paris Saint-Germain have agreed terms for the transfer of David Luiz back to London,"" a statement on Chelsea's website read, similar to PSG's own statement. ""The move is now subject to him agreeing personal terms and passing a medical.""

He vowed not to celebrate if he scored against his former club, but did so as PSG advanced on away goals at the expense of Chelsea in March 2015. Earlier on Wednesday, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte paid a reported £23 million to sign former Bolton left-back Marcos Alonso from Fiorentina."

709,11/08/2016,02:10,Cavani doubt as PSG begin title defence at Bastia,"Under new coach Unai Emery and with a new-look squad following the departure of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Paris Saint-Germain begin their quest for a fifth consecutive Ligue 1 title at Bastia on Friday.","Ibrahimovic dominated the French game during his four years at PSG but has moved on to Manchester United after scoring 113 Ligue 1 goals including a club-record 38 last season. There has been no marquee name signed as the Swede's replacement, but the capital side have recruited Hatem Ben Arfa on a free from Nice and completed the purchase on Monday of Real Madrid's Jese Rodriguez to further boost their attack. ""This season we have not bought players at exorbitant sums but that doesn't matter. It is important to invest your money well,"" said club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi at Jese's unveiling. PSG have spent around 65 million euros ($72.6m, £55.8m) this summer, with Poland midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak following Emery from Sevilla and Belgium right-back Thomas Meunier arriving from Club Brugge. Edinson Cavani will finally get his wish to be the main man in the Paris attack, although he is a doubt for the game at the Stade Armand-Cesari because of a thigh injury. With Thiago Silva missing last week's 4-1 Champions Trophy win against Lyon in Austria and Marquinhos away at the Olympics with Brazil, PSG may be light in defence, while Emery must choose between Kevin Trapp and Alphonse Areola in goal. Bastia finished 10th last season but are usually strong at home, and Emery has rejected suggestions Ligue 1 will be easy despite PSG winning the title by a 31-point margin from runners-up Lyon last season under Laurent Blanc. ""If people say to me the league is easy, I respond that it's easy if you work hard,"" Emery told L'Equipe recently. ""PSG have won a lot, which means they have worked hard and worked well. We need to keep doing that while also trying to improve by going further in Europe."" Monaco also open their campaign on Friday, entertaining Guingamp, now coached by former PSG boss Antoine Kombouare, at the Stade Louis II. The principality club have already been in competitive action, beating Fenerbahce of Turkey in the Champions League third qualifying round. They will face Villarreal in the play-offs, with the first leg to come in Spain next Wednesday. Minds may well be on that, while Jardim's attack will be decimated against Guingamp with Radamel Falcao and Vagner Love injured and Valere Germain suspended. ""The team is 100 percent ready. I think we are stronger now than in our first match of the season. Things have been positive so far with qualifying for the play-offs,"" said Jardim, who could hand a first start to new signing Kamil Glik in defence. He could also select exciting 17-year-old forward Kylian Mbappe, who is fresh from winning the European under-19 title with France last month. Along with Monaco, Lyon are expected to be the closest challengers to PSG this season and Bruno Genesio's men kick off their campaign at promoted Nancy on Sunday. Lyon have lost Samuel Umtiti to Barcelona but have strengthened their defence with the signings of Nicolas Nkoulou from Marseille, Argentine prospect Emanuel Mammana and Poland's Maciej Rybus. Despite their sound beating by PSG last weekend, Genesio is hopeful his team can feature prominently once again. ""If we handle being back in the Champions League and can repeat our form from the last five months of last season, we can upset PSG,"" Genesio told France Football. Other key opening fixtures include Saint-Etienne at Bordeaux, Nice against Rennes and Marseille at home to Toulouse. Ligue 1 opening weekend fixtures"

""I'm extremely happy to join PSG, who have become one of the most competitive teams in Europe,"" said Jese, in a statement on the French club's website. ""Along with the club I have very big goals for the years to come and it will be a real pleasure to work under Unai Emery. I can't wait to start this new challenge in my career."" The 23-year-old found opportunities limited in Madrid behind the Spanish giants' vaunted attacking trio of Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, but Real coach Zinedine Zidane last week suggested he would prefer to send Jese out on loan. ""I'm very pleased to welcome Jese to PSG. These past few seasons he has confirmed he is one of the most promising individuals at Real Madrid and in Spanish football,"" said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, adding that the Spaniard would be the club's final signing this transfer window. Jese, capped by Spain at Under-21 level, scored 13 goals in 62 league appearances for Real and was also part of the sides that won the Champions League in 2014 and 2016. He is expected to be presented to the media later on Monday, with PSG kicking off the defence of their Ligue 1 crown away to Bastia on Friday."
711,05/08/2016,20:22,Lyon provide first test for new-look PSG,The post-Zlatan Ibrahimovic era officially begins for Paris Saint-Germain when they take on Lyon in the French Champions Trophy on Saturday in the unlikely surroundings of the Austrian city of Klagenfurt.,"PSG have undergone a summer of considerable change since securing a second consecutive clean sweep of France's domestic trophies in May, with Ibrahimovic leaving for Manchester United at the end of his contract. Coach Laurent Blanc was sacked, paying the price for failing to take Paris beyond the quarter-finals of the Champions League, with Unai Emery arriving from Sevilla as his replacement. Emery's new-look PSG, with new signings Hatem Ben Arfa, Grzegorz Krychowiak, Thomas Meunier and Giovanni Lo Celso, now attack their first competitive game after winning all four matches in pre-season. ""For us this is very important,"" said Emery, whose team begin their Ligue 1 title defence at Bastia next Friday. ""It is still a pre-season match but it is also a chance to win a first trophy."" PSG will be without Thiago Silva and Edinson Cavani, while Adrien Rabiot and Poland midfielder Krychowiak, who followed Emery from Sevilla, are suspended. ""Cavani has a little strain so it was better that he stayed in Paris,"" said Emery, who will choose between Ben Arfa and France under-19 striker Jean-Kevin Augustin in attack. Their European limitations ultimately cost Blanc his job, but PSG's dominance of the French game has been outrageous in recent seasons and this weekend they will be bidding to win the Champions Trophy for the fourth year running. The season curtain-raiser traditionally pits the champions against the French Cup holders, but just like last year, PSG will meet the Ligue 1 runners-up Lyon for the trophy. Twelve months ago the game was played in the Canadian city of Montreal and it has also been staged in China, Gabon, the United States, Morocco and Tunisia in recent years. The reasons for taking the match to these exotic venues appeared obvious, but the decision to go to Klagenfurt -- the 32,000-seat Woerthersee Stadion was rebuilt to host matches at Euro 2008 -- this time is rather harder to fathom. In fact, it was a conscious decision to remain in Europe despite offers from Asia and Australia, according to the French league's director of economic development. ""PSG had just come back from the United States so it would have been complicated to go to Asia or Oceania,"" admitted Mathieu Ficot. ""So instead we decided to go somewhere in Europe, where we hadn't previously been."" Unlike Paris, Lyon stayed in Europe for their pre-season, although they did find themselves in Istanbul for a planned friendly against Fenerbahce when Turkey was hit by a botched military coup. They have also seen defender Samuel Umtiti depart for Barcelona but have so far kept hold of midfielder Corentin Tolisso and star striker Alexandre Lacazette, the latter a target for PSG among others. Defensive trio Nicolas Nkoulou, Emanuel Mammana and Maciej Rybus have all arrived, although the latter two will not feature this weekend. ""There is a trophy up for grabs and also the chance to measure ourselves against this Paris side to see what we can do over the course of the season and if we can reduce the gap between us and PSG,"" said Lyon coach Bruno Genesio. Of the departure of Ibrahimovic, he added: ""It changes things a little bit because he scored a lot of goals but they have other great players. We will still be up against one of the best teams in Europe."""

The left-footed Lo Celso can play both through the middle and out wide in an attacking midfield role and has been picked to represent Argentina at next month's Rio Olympics.

717,03/06/2016,14:29,PSG boss hints at Blanc departure,The future of Laurent Blanc as Paris Saint-Germain coach was thrown into grave doubt on Friday after the chairman of the big-spending French champions said major changes were afoot.,"Nasser Al-Khelaifi in April insisted that Blanc, who has been head coach at Qatari-owned PSG since 2013, would stay on despite failing once again to get past the quarter-final stages of the Champions League. But just weeks on the ambitious Al-Khelaifi strongly suggested that could be set to change and dropped a major hint that he could be after Atletico Madrid's in-demand coach Diego Simeone. ""The players, the coach, the management, we need turnover, a new cycle,"" he told the Le Parisien newspaper. ""I've supported (Blanc) for three years. Now, I have to ask the right questions. Big changes could happen. ""I've been here for five years and this is the first time that we have this sense of failure. This isn't simply the fact of having lost in the quarter-finals of the Champions League (to Manchester City), it's the way it happened. ""This elimination is the worst moment since I came to Paris."" Despite signing a new contract in February taking him through to June 2018, Blanc's position with the club's money-bags owners came under threat with the tame surrender to City. Blanc led PSG to a runaway fourth straight win in the French league, and success in the domestic cups, but it appears not to have been enough for his Qatari bosses. Al-Khelaifi did not list names of a possible replacement for Blanc, but said in the interview that he had ""a lot of respect for Atletico""."

While the German club cannot compete with United's wealth, size, support and standing in the game, they have nevertheless come up with a creative package to offer Sweden's all-time top scorer. The offer was posted on the club's website under the headline ""RWO and Ibrahimovic in negotiations"" next to a picture of the Swedish flag. The deal includes introducing a monarchy to the city of Oberhausen and making Ibrahimovic king, the club's fast-food stands would replace traditional German bratwurst with Swedish sausages and a local brewer would rename their beer IbrahimovicPilsnener. As if that wasn't enough to tempt Ibrahimovic, the offer includes building a new stand with supplies from Swedish furniture giants IKEA. ""The player will decide in the next few days,"" concluded the statement. ""We are cautiously optimistic that he will make a positive decision in the direction of RWO."" The club are now waiting to hear from Ibrahimovic -- and are fully aware the call may never come. ""Our media relations officer apparently has nothing better to do on a Wednesday night,"" RWO's president Hajo Sommers told German broadcaster Sport1 on Thursday. ""He thought that, given the whole current transfer madness, an announcement like this would go down well, so he knocked one out. ""The young man has too much free time, but I think it's great."" Sommer has offered to pick Ibrahimovic up from the airport and take him on a sightseeing tour of Oberhausen in Germany's Ruhr Valley. ""That would be a whole new experience for Ibrahimovic,"" added Sommer. ""If he wants to expand his horizons, let him come, we would pick him up. ""We could show Ibrahimovic all there is to see in Oberhausen. ""In a football province, like Oberhausen, there are a few things which other places wouldn't have.

PSG said it would make no comment on the incident before a judiciary decision. Aurier was summoned to a September 26 hearing over the attack. The incident occurred after Aurier was challenged by police because his Porsche Cayenne was causing traffic problems after he left a nightclub. Aurier was ""aggressive"" and ""quite contemptuous"" when police tried to breathalyse him. It was then he allegedly ""elbowed"" the policeman in the throat, a source said. Reigning French champions PSG briefly suspended Aurier in February after he appeared in a video on social media insulting coach Laurent Blanc. Aurier later admitted he had made a ""stupid mistake"" and apologised. With an estimated transfer value of between 20-25 million euros, Aurier was a key element of PSG's drive towards a fourth consecutive French league title and the Champions League quarter-finals in the just-completed season. He is under under contract with the club until June 2019."

Ibrahimovic then converted a penalty immediately after half-time to restore the capital club's lead, before he played in Edinson Cavani to add a third goal on 56 minutes. The 34-year-old Swedish star signed off in trademark spectacular style with his second of the evening, the 156th and final goal of his PSG career, eight minutes from time as Laurent Blanc's side repeated last year's domestic treble despite a late consolation from Michy Batshuayi. ""I'm very happy to win my final match with a fantastic team,"" said Ibrahimovic. ""We've worked hard over the four years. It was an incredible adventure for me, especially when you know how things were when I arrived and how they are now. ""It's mission accomplished. I didn't learn to speak French but I've won everything. I came, I saw, I conquered."" Marseille interim coach Franck Passi lamented his side's slow start to both halves, rueing a lack of concentration. ""You must not give away goals like the ones we conceded because it's difficult for us to score them,"" he said. ""It needed to stay at 1-1 for longer, we had the chances but we only scored two goals. ""We couldn't to afford to concede a goal so quickly, we needed to be more focused."" With the Ligue 1 crown and French League Cup already in the bag, PSG were aiming to move level with record 10-time French Cup winners Marseille in a repeat of the 2006 final, won 2-1 by Paris. Ibrahimovic, who last weekend broke Argentine striker Carlos Bianchi's single-season club record of 37 league goals, was aiming to bring down the curtain the down on a glittering four-year stay in the French capital in fitting fashion having already helped PSG to 11 trophies. However, Abdelaziz Barrada fired an early warning signal to PSG in their quest for another title when the midfielder's 25-yard drive flashed just wide of Salvatore Sirigu's right-hand post with less than a minute gone. Blanc's side were ahead though with their first attack as Angel Di Maria, provider of 18 assists in his first Ligue 1 campaign, delivered another from a wicked right-wing cross that was turned in by Matuidi from close range. But Marseille, who were hoping to salvage their season after finishing 13th in the league, responded on 12 minutes as Thauvin's strike from just outside the area clipped Thiago Silva's leg to wrong-foot Sirigu. Thauvin was fortunate to escape punishment when he blocked Ibrahimovic's goalbound strike with his hand shortly before the interval, but Marseille were caught out seconds after the restart as Nicolas Nkoulou bundled over Matuidi inside the box. Ibrahimovic slotted past Steve Mandanda from the penalty spot to put PSG back in front on 47 minutes, before Paris' record goalscorer played in Cavani to steer home a third nine minutes later after Chile international Mauricio Isla lost possession in midfield. Matuidi then released Ibrahimovic to stroke home a fourth on 82 minutes and guarantee PSG a 10th successive win over Marseille, despite Batshuayi converting a rebound three minutes from the end after Sirigu could only parry Benjamin Mendy's low shot. Blanc then withdrew Ibrahimovic, who will leave Paris when his contract expires at the end of June, to a rapturous ovation late on in the final act of a remarkable chapter in PSG's history."

""It's beyond my control and I don't know what will happen. I'd like to see that decided quicky though,"" said Digne, who was pushed down the pecking order in Paris by the Brazilian Maxwell. ""The clubs will have to agree on that and there seems to be differences of opinion."" Roma came third in Italy this season after a late run under coach Luciano Spalletti put them into the Champions League qualifying round. After winning the under-20's world championships with France Digne joined Paris in 2013 and is under contract until 2018. With France Digne also plays second fiddle to Juventus defender Patrice Evra for the left-back position."
723,20/05/2016,02:22,Departing Ibrahimovic hoping to sign off with French Cup,Zlatan Ibrahimovic will aim to lift one final trophy as the curtain comes down on his record-shattering Paris Saint-Germain career in Saturday's French Cup final against bitter rivals Marseille.,"Ibrahimovic, who obliterated Pauleta's club goals record earlier this season and now stands on 154 from 179 games, announced he will leave Paris when his contract expires at the end of June after a trophy-laden four years in France. The Swede will look to fire Laurent Blanc's side to a second straight domestic treble which would send PSG level with Marseille as 10-time winners of the French Cup. Ibrahimovic notched his 37th and 38th league goals in Saturday's 4-0 thumping of Nantes in his final appearance at the Parc des Princes to surpass Argentine striker Carlos Bianchi's 37-goal mark set during the 1977-78 season. Having been crowned France's player of the year for a record third time, before modestly declaring ""I came like a king, left like a legend,"" Ibrahimovic will look to bow out with his reputation enhanced yet further. Although the 34-year-old has missed training with a sore calf this week, there is no question the Sweden star will spearhead the PSG attack one final time at the Stade de France. ""It's a bit of a sad moment, but the project continues. So does Zlatan's career. You have to go through moments like this to move forward,"" said Blanc, reflecting on Ibrahimovic's profound impact on the club. ""Zlatan has brought the club on enormously, beyond expectations. He has had one of the best seasons as a footballer and it's been a huge pleasure to work with him."" Saturday will also mark the final appearance for Gregory van der Wiel, with the Dutch defender set to move on having joined PSG in 2012, the same summer as Ibrahimovic. Midfielder Marco Verratti underwent surgery on Monday and the Italy international will not only miss the final but his country's Euro 2016 campaign as a result. For Marseille, who have gone 27 years since their last French Cup title, Saturday's showdown is a chance to salvage what has been nothing short of a catastrophic season. The club never recovered from the bombshell departure of Marcelo Bielsa in August and finished 13th, their lowest position since the 2000-01 season, having embarked on an unwanted record of 15 home games without a win. However, winger Romain Alessandrini believes taking on the French champions can bring the best out of an underperforming OM side. ""We're up against a very good PSG team that is used to winning trophies, so we have nothing to lose,"" Alessandrini, who was part of the Rennes side beaten 2-0 by Guingamp in the 2014 final, told OM.net. ""It's up to us to do everything to win this match, to enjoy it and to bring the cup back to Marseille. ""There's an eternal rivalry between the two clubs. It's going to be rather intense to say the least. If we win, it'll be an incredible day for us. ""Our best two matches this season, despite the results, were against PSG so I think it'll a high quality match."" Marseille could welcome back Georges-Kevin Nkoudou after the winger recently returned to training following a thigh injury picked up in last month's 1-0 semi-final victory over Sochaux."
724,17/05/2016,16:45,Van der Wiel to leave PSG,"Dutch full-back Gregory van der Wiel will leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of the season, the French champions announced on Tuesday.","The Netherlands international joined from Ajax in 2012, and went on to win eight major domestic honours, including four consecutive Ligue 1 titles, in his four campaigns with PSG. This term the 28-year-old has had to settle for a place on the bench more often than in previous years due to the good form of Ivorian Serge Aurier. Van der Wiel has played 132 times for the capital city club, scoring five goals. He could still make one more appearance for Laurent Blanc's side, with the French Cup final against Marseille to come at the Stade de France on May 21. According to reports Italian Serie A clubs Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan are interested in signing the defender."
725,14/05/2016,22:59,Ibrahimovic breaks PSG record in Nantes rout,Zlatan Ibrahimovic headed home a minute from time to break Paris Saint-Germain's single season Ligue 1 scoring record in a 4-0 rout of Nantes on Saturday.,"With the title long wrapped up and a French Cup final against bitter rivals Marseille to come a week later, the night was all about Ibrahimovic and his quest to break the record at the Parc-des-Princes. Having equalled the record of Argentine Carlos Bianchi in the 18th minute with his first goal, Ibrahimovic netted a minute form time from Javier Pastore's cross to end a match-long quest that had looked set to frustrate him. It was the perfect end to his last match at the Parc in a PSG shirt before leaving for pastures new and he was immediately substituted, but not before his children ran onto the pitch wearing PSG replica shirts bearing the names King and Legend on their backs -- a reference to Ibrahimovic's Friday tweet in announcing his departure: ""I came like a king, left like a legend."" If anyone had been in any doubt who the night was about, that was surely dispelled in the tenth minute when the ground as one rose to applaud their talismanic import. Wearing the No.10 jersey, Ibrahimovic acknowledged the crowd as Nantes obligingly waited patiently for almost a minute before taking a free-kick. The visiting defence seemed to oblige in more ways than one against a team clearly intent solely on setting up their centre-forward to score. Ibrahimovic notched his first goal as he played the ball out wide on the right to Angel Di Maria, before sprinting to the back stick where he was able to chest home the Argentine's cross on his knees from six yards out without a yellow-shirted defender in sight. If there was one player determined to ruin the party it was Nantes goalkeeper Maxime Dupe, who made a reaction one-handed save to deny a close range Ibrahimovic flick before then thwarting the big Swede when one-on-one as even the linesman seemed unwilling to spoil the festivities. PSG's desire to tee up their stand-in captain for the night took on comic proportions 10 minutes from halftime. When faced with a clear shooting opportunity inside the box, Di Maria wiggled and twisted in trying to find Ibrahimovic rather than strike at goal himself. PSG finally switched back into the rich vein that had seen them romp to the title with two months to spare as Ibrahimovic and Di Maria combined to set up up Lucas Moura for a simple second two minutes before the break -- PSG's 100th league goal of the season. PSG notched their third on 52 minutes as Dupe parried a fierce Ibrahimovic free-kick, only for Marquinhos to win a sprint between three home players to tap in the rebound with not a yellow shirt reacting. Ibrahimovic had a shot deflected behind for a corner as he took on three defenders and Dupe twice dived to his side to beat away shots before the big Swede lifted another chance over the bar as he became increasingly desperate. But Pastore picked him out with a minute left to the stadium's delight as Ibrahimovic fulfilled his quest. Monaco secured the third and final Champions League qualification spot as first half goals from Ivan Cavaleiro and a Fabinho penalty gave them a 2-0 win over Montpellier. Nice won 3-2 at Guingamp but had to settle for fourth in Hatem Ben Arfa's final game for the south coast club. Toulouse scored two goals in the final 12 minutes through Martin Braithwaite and Yann Bodiger to turn a 2-1 deficit at Angers into a 3-2 victory that kept them a point above Reims, whose 4-1 win over second-placed Lyon wasn't enough to prevent them descending into Ligue 2 alongside Lorient and Troyes."
726,13/05/2016,13:21,Superstar Zlatan prepares for Euro swansong,Zlatan Ibrahimovic has one of the hottest shots in football and he is not at all modest about it.,"""One thing is for sure, a World Cup without me is nothing to watch,"" said the Swedish superstar after his country failed to qualify for Brazil 2014. So it is just as well he has made it to Euro 2016. Ibrahimovic scored three goals in the two-leg playoff against Denmark that Sweden won 4-3 on aggregate to reach France. The 34-year-old, who will leave Paris Saint-Germain this summer, makes the difference for an otherwise mediocre Sweden team. ""It's a challenge -- a world class player and good players, but not as good as him -- to get a good team,"" said Sweden coach Erik Hamren. Ibrahimovic is not just Sweden's captain and best player now, he is possibly the country's greatest ever, their all-time record goal-scorer with 62 and a record 10-time winner of the national Guldbollen award for player of the year. Born in a difficult neighbourhood of Malmo to a Bosnian father and Croatian mother, Ibrahimovic has enjoyed a glittering career. He has just won his 11th league title, a fourth straight French championship with PSG following two titles at Ajax, three at Inter Milan, one at Barcelona and one at AC Milan. There were also two with Juventus that were revoked because of the Calciopoli match-fixing scandal while the biggest gap in his CV is his lack of success in the Champions League. At international level he does not represent one of the major powers, and with his 35th birthday approaching, this may be his last chance at a major tournament. A player who stands 6ft 4ins tall (1.95m) and has a black belt in taekwondo has scored some of the most eye-catching international goals, from his back-heel against Italy at Euro 2004 to his breathtaking overhead kick from 35 yards against England in 2012. But international honours have not followed. 'Ibra' has featured at just one World Cup, in 2006, and has not gone beyond the quarter-finals of the European Championship, a competition in which he has scored six times spread over the 2004, 2008 and 2012 finals. However, after once briefly quitting the international scene, he has flourished under Hamren. The coach's ability to get along with Ibrahimovic contrasts with Pep Guardiola, with whom the striker famously endured a difficult relationship at Barcelona. Ibrahimovic has said that he once told Guardiola to ""go to hell"" and blamed him for a disappointing stint at the Camp Nou. ""When you buy me, you are buying a Ferrari,"" he said. ""If you drive a Ferrari you put premium fuel in the tank, you drive onto the motorway and you floor the accelerator. ""Guardiola filled up with diesel and went for a spin in the countryside. If that's what he wanted, he should have bought himself a Fiat from the start."" The Euros will be particularly special for Ibrahimovic as they take place in the country that has become his adopted home in four years with PSG. He is a superstar in France, and has his own puppet on the cult satirical programme Les Guignols, but he has never mastered the language and has an uneasy relationship with the French media. Some who have spent time in his company talk of an intelligent person who despises losing, and whose demanding nature has been the biggest factor in transforming PSG. He has suggested the club did not even exist before his arrival in 2012. Ibrahimovic once refused a trial at Arsenal as a teenager, later explaining himself by saying ""Zlatan doesn't do auditions"". He has never made it to the English game, but that could still change. His PSG deal -- worth a reported 20 million euros ($22.7m) a year -- expires in June and he has confirmed that he will be leaving for a new challenge elsewhere. He has enjoyed a superb season with PSG, breaking the 40-goal barrier, and recently joked that he would stay if the Eiffel Tower were replaced with a statue of him. For now, though, his French swansong will come in the colours of Sweden."
727,13/05/2016,10:11,Zlatan Ibrahimovic says leaving PSG,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic confirmed on Friday that he will leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of this season, but the French champions said the Swedish star will eventually return in a ""management"" role.","""My last game tomorrow at Parc des Princes. I came like a king, left like a legend,"" wrote Ibrahimovic, ending speculation that he could extend his contract with PSG beyond this season. Ibrahimovic, whose existing deal expires on June 30, will make his final home appearance for the club in their last Ligue 1 game of the season against Nantes on Saturday. However, he will then run out in a PSG shirt one more time when they face Marseille in the French Cup final on May 21 at the Stade de France. ""After discussions between Paris Saint-Germain and the agent of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the club and the player have mutually decided not to renew his contract,"" PSG said. ""They have also agreed that once his playing career is over, Ibra will join the management of the club in a position of responsability."" In the meantime, Ibrahimovic will make his French swansong as a player when he turns out for Sweden at Euro 2016 in June. There has been widespread speculation about the 34-year-old former Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona and AC Milan star's next destination. He has been linked with a move to the English Premier League, while his agent recently suggested he could return to AC Milan and Major League Soccer is another potential destination. Ibrahimovic, who last weekend was crowned France's player of the year for a record third time, has enjoyed enormous domestic success with PSG since moving to the French capital from Milan in 2012, winning the Ligue 1 title in each of his four seasons. If Paris win the French Cup next week, they will have completed a clean sweep of the domestic honours for the second year running and Ibrahimovic will have won 12 trophies with the club. ""I am very proud of the last four years. I have loved every day I have spent here,"" Ibrahimovic said. ""PSG has become a star club internationally and I have played a major part in that transformation. ""The time has now come for me to take a different path. ""This is not a farewell but simply a goodbye for now. I came here like a king and leave as a legend. But I will come back!"" Ibrahimovic scored his 36th league goal of the season in Wednesday's 1-1 draw at Bordeaux, leaving him just one away from equalling Argentine striker Carlos Bianchi's club record of 37 in a top-flight campaign, set back in 1978. He has 46 in all competitions and has 152 goals in total as a PSG player in 178 appearances, having overtaken Portuguese great Pauleta as the club's all-time leading scorer back in October. Ibrahimovic has also become the club's all-time leading scorer in the league and in Europe, but he never managed to reproduce his brilliant domestic form in the Champions League. The Swede performed poorly in PSG's quarter-final exit to Manchester City last month, missing a penalty in the 2-2 first-leg draw at the Parc des Princes before Paris went out 3-2 on aggregate. In Paris speculation will now turn to who PSG will sign to replace their talisman. They have in the past been linked with moves for Real Madrid and Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and Barcelona's Brazil forward Neymar. However, moves for these two players would be extremely complex and costly, and a report in sports daily L'Equipe on Friday indicated that the Qatar-owned club will instead turn their attentions to Antoine Griezmann. The Atletico Madrid striker, who on Thursday was named in France's Euro 2016 squad, would cost in the region of 70 million euros (£55.1m, $79.5m), L'Equipe said."
728,11/05/2016,22:35,Bordeaux come from behind to hold PSG,Bordeaux recovered from falling behind to a Zlatan Ibrahimovic goal to hold champions Paris Saint-Germain to a 1-1 draw in a rearranged game in Ligue 1 on Wednesday.,"Ibrahimovic had put the visitors in front with his 36th league goal of a remarkable campaign just before the hour mark, but Nicolas Pallois equalised for Bordeaux shortly after. With PSG having been crowned champions in record quick time two months ago and Bordeaux safely in mid-table after pulling clear of trouble, this match had a distinct end-of-season feel to it. The draw takes PSG's all-time record points tally to 93, some 28 ahead of Lyon in second, but they were some way short of their irresistible best in the absence of the likes of Blaise Matuidi, Javier Pastore, Marco Verratti and Edinson Cavani. Paris should have been in front late in the first half but Lucas Moura somehow contrived to miss with just the goalkeeper to beat. Alone six yards out, the Brazilian only needed to help an Ibrahimovic shot into the net but instead barely made contact with the ball, allowing Jerome Prior to save. At the other end, Kevin Trapp saved well from Jaroslav Plasil and Diego Rolan in the first half, before Ibrahimovic struck on 59 minutes. Angel Di Maria crossed from the right and the Swede peeled away from Brazilian defender Pablo to head home. Named France's player of the year for the third time in four seasons at the weekend, Ibrahimovic now has 46 goals in all competitions for the campaign. His league tally leaves him just one away from equalling Argentine striker Carlos Bianchi's club record of 37 in a top-flight campaign, set back in 1978. Bordeaux were level just seven minutes later, though, as the giant Malian Cheick Diabate headed on a corner for Pallois to lash home at the back post. Shortly after that, Ibrahimovic came off with what looked like a minor calf knock, but he will hope to be fit in time for Saturday's final league game of the season against Nantes at the Parc des Princes."
729,08/05/2016,19:35,Ibrahimovic crowned France's player of year,Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was voted France's Ligue 1 player of the year for a record third time on Sunday.,"Ibrahimovic won the award, voted for by his peers, ahead of PSG team-mate Angel Di Maria, Nice forward Hatem Ben Arfa and Marseille midfielder Lassana Diarra after scoring 35 goals in the capital club's romp to a fourth straight French title. PSG are on course to repeat last year's domestic treble, having won the League Cup last month, with the final of the French Cup on May 21 against bitter rivals Marseille. However, Ibrahimovic's future in Paris remains uncertain with the 34-year-old out of contract at the end of the season. PSG coach Laurent Blanc claimed the Ligue 1 coach of the year prize for the second straight season, while 18-year-old Rennes striker Ousmane Dembele was named France's young player of the year after netting 12 goals in a remarkable debut campaign."
730,07/05/2016,23:14,Lacazette hat-trick as Lyon thrash Monaco to book Champions League spot,French international Alexandre Lacazette hit a hat-trick as Lyon sealed a place in next season's Champions League by thrashing 10-man Monaco 6-1 at Parc OL on Saturday.,"Second-placed Lyon went into the game ahead of Monaco in the Ligue 1 table on goal difference, and they pulled clear quickly with goals from Rachid Ghezzal and Lacazette inside the first eight minutes. Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa headed in a third after visiting striker Lacina Traore was sent off, and Lacazette dinked in before Ricardo Carvalho pulled one back before half-time. Centre-back Yanga-Mbiwa piled yet more misery onto Monaco just before the hour mark before Lacazette completed a hat-trick. Lyon are all but assured of a place in the Champions League group stages, and of being runners-up behind Paris Saint-Germain for the second straight season, thanks to their far superior goal difference to Monaco with just a game to go. The principality side though will be looking nervously over their shoulders as they look to hang onto the third and final spot in Europe's premier competition, after Nice beat the nine men of Saint-Etienne 2-0 to close the gap on the top three to just two points ahead of the final day of the season next Saturday. Since ending PSG's record unbeaten run in February, Lyon have not lost themselves, with Saturday's victory their eighth in 10 outings. Algerian winger Ghezzal has had an excellent campaign, and he grabbed his eighth league goal this term from a tight angle after less than three minutes. Sergi Darder teed up Lacazette to drill into the corner and continue a dream start for Bruno Genesio's hosts. Things went from bad to worse for Monaco midway through the first half, as Ivorian Traore picked up two yellow cards in just a couple of minutes. Lyon were ripping their opponents' defence to shreds in open play, but it was from a Ghezzal corner that Yanga-Mbiwa nodded his first goal for the club past the despairing dive of Danijel Subasic. Lacazette completed a brace with an audacious finish from Christophe Jallet's pass, scooping the ball past bewildered Serbian keeper Subasic. Home goalkeeper Anthony Lopes threw away his clean sheet before half-time when he punched a cross straight onto the head of Carvalho, but by then the game was already over as a contest. Yanga-Mbiwa had only scored five times in his whole career before this game, but he completed his first professional brace by stabbing home after another set-piece wreaked havoc in a Monaco defence that have conceded 16 goals in their last six matches. Lacazette bundled his way past Subasic and tapped in to grab his second treble of the season and round off a resounding result with 10 minutes to play. Saint-Etienne's Champions League hopes are now over after Kevin Malcuit and Franck Tabanou were both sent off at Nice. Claude Puel's men left it late, but finally made the most of their two-man advantage thanks to Valere Germain goals in the 86th and 89th minutes. Nice visit Guingamp next week, while Monaco host Montpellier. Elsewhere on Saturday, PSG set a new Ligue 1 points record of 92 by cruising past struggling Gazelec Ajaccio 4-0 in Corsica. Edinson Cavani scored a hat-trick before Zlatan Ibrahimovic's injury-time strike, as Gazelec slipped into the relegation zone. Toulouse clambered out of the bottom three at their expense after a tense 1-0 victory over already-relegated Troyes. Argentinian Oscar Trejo was the star for Pascal Dupraz's men, scoring the only goal in the second half just seconds after coming off the bench. Two of Gazelec, Toulouse and Reims will go down next week, after the latter were beaten 1-0 at Marseille. Michy Batshuayi gave OM their first home league win since September, leaving Reims a point behind their two rivals in the fight to avoid the drop. Lille were held to a 0-0 draw by Guingamp as they missed the chance to leapfrog Saint-Etienne into fifth."
731,29/04/2016,22:58,PSG rout Rennes to equal points record,Paris Saint-Germain matched their Ligue 1 points record from the 2013-14 season with Friday's 4-0 rout of Rennes moving them onto 89 points with three games still to play.,"Maxwell struck the opening goal five minutes after half-time on a soggy evening at the Parc des Princes before Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice to increase the Swede's goal haul to 34 for the campaign. Edinson Cavani added a fourth in stoppage time as PSG earned their 28th win of the season to surpass the previous mark also set two years ago. With games to come against Gazelec Ajaccio, Bordeaux and Nantes, Laurent Blanc's side have every chance of breaking another record in a domestic season that has been completely dominated by Paris. Rennes are now without a win in four games as their European hopes continue to fade, with the defeat leaving the Brittany club a point behind Lille, who visit Lorient on Saturday, in the race for sixth place which would warrant a Europa League spot should PSG beat Marseille in next month's French Cup final. A sparse crowd in the capital witnessed little of interest in the opening 45 minutes, Ibrahimovic and Angel Di Maria -- both named on the four-man shortlist for Ligue 1 Player of the Year -- going close with the Argentine also denied by Benoit Costil. But PSG burst into life after half-time as Maxwell rolled the ball through the legs of Rennes defender Joris Gnagnon as he strolled into the area before drilling a right-foot shot past Costil via the underside of the crossbar. Ibrahimovic combined with Di Maria to double the home side's lead just four minutes later, the Swede stretching to reach the Argentine's cross and flicking the ball home. Cavani hit the bar shortly after as PSG flexed their muscles, Costil making a string of fine saves to keep out Ibrahimovic, Javier Pastore and Lucas and temporarily limit the damage for Rolland Courbis' side. However, there was nothing the Rennes keeper could do as Ibrahimovic shrugged off Ludovic Baal after being played in by Pastore to blast in his second goal of the game 12 minutes from time. Marco Verratti, who replaced Benjamin Stambouli for the final half-hour, released Cavani in stoppage time with the Uruguayan putting a series of earlier misses behind him by picking out the far corner for his 16th goal of the season. Lyon host Gazelec Ajaccio on Saturday as they bid to keep hold onto second place and an automatic Champions League qualifying spot, while third-place Monaco host Guingamp and fourth-place Nice visit Nantes. Saint-Etienne, who like Nice are just two points behind Lyon and Monaco, will aim for a sixth straight win at home to Toulouse. Marseille travel to Angers on Sunday looking to snap an 11-game winless run in the league which has left the struggling French giants just five points above the relegation zone."
732,29/04/2016,02:20,Quartet scrapping for Champions League berths in France,"While Paris Saint-Germain have long since had the Ligue 1 title wrapped up, the battle for Champions League qualification beneath them is only intensifying in the final weeks of the French season.","Just two points separate Lyon in second from Saint-Etienne in fifth with three matches remaining, including a crucial set of fixtures this Saturday. Lyon sit second ahead of Monaco on goal difference, with Nice and Saint-Etienne both two points back. Only second carries with it automatic qualification for next season's Champions League group stage, with the team in third facing entry in the third qualifying round in late July. Monaco are desperate to avoid that fate after losing to Valencia in the Champions League play-offs at the start of this season, but their form has dipped rather alarmingly of late. Leonardo Jardim's side have won only two of their last eight matches, allowing Lyon to catch them up thanks to six wins and two draws over the same period. The two teams meet each other in a huge game on the penultimate weekend of the season, but first Monaco entertain Guingamp at the Stade Louis II on Saturday just before Lyon entertain relegation-threatened Gazelec Ajaccio. ""It is a decisive match, a bit like a semi-final. There will be something to play for at Lyon only if we win against Guingamp,"" said Monaco coach Jardim, whose side drew 1-1 at Rennes last weekend. ""The fact OL are favourites now changes nothing. There are four of us fighting for second place and all the teams will give everything to get it. ""The draw against Rennes doesn't change much. We are still obliged to win our next three matches. If we do that we will finish second."" Lyon, whose leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette has this week been linked with a move to Barcelona, will look to defend their unbeaten record at their new Parc OL when they host Gazelec. ""It is a very important match and we are really concentrated on it. We are not thinking about the match against Monaco,"" said midfielder Corentin Tolisso. ""Everything depends on a victory on Saturday. We need to be in front of them before playing Monaco."" With Hatem Ben Arfa in the form of his life, Nice have lost just once -- to PSG -- in their last seven games and go to Nantes looking to keep alive their hopes of a first podium finish since 1976. Ben Arfa, who has scored 17 Ligue 1 goals this season, has been nominated for the player of the year award in France along with PSG duo Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Angel Di Maria and Marseille midfielder Lassana Diarra. Nice need points before hosting Saint-Etienne next weekend, before which Les Verts entertain Toulouse on Saturday. Christophe Galtier's side are bidding to secure a fourth consecutive top-five finish and are on a run of five successive wins, all without conceding a goal. PSG's win against Lille last weekend ensured fifth place would bring with it a Europa League berth, while sixth will also offer European qualification if PSG beat Marseille in the French Cup final next month. Lille, who visit Lorient on Saturday, are currently sixth, one point ahead of Rennes, who go to Paris on Friday. Champions PSG can equal their own record for the most points in a Ligue 1 season with a win against Rennes after a week in which several stars used their days off to take a mini break in Las Vegas. ""My players do what they want. They had three days off, I gave them to them, and I think that's a good thing,"" coach Laurent Blanc said in response to media criticism after Ibrahimovic and Javier Pastore were among those who visited Vegas."
733,28/04/2016,11:40,PSG chasing Ligue 1 points record against Rennes,"French champions Paris Saint-Germain continue to tick off their remaining league fixtures as they welcome Rennes to the capital on Friday night, knowing that a win would equal their own Ligue 1 points record.","Laurent Blanc's men made it three French League Cup triumphs in a row last weekend, despite being reduced to 10 men, thanks to Angel Di Maria's winner against Lille. Now they will turn their attention back to the league, where they are 27 points clear at the top of the table with just four matches to play. PSG have just one game left this season of any real importance, the French Cup final against arch rivals Marseille at the Stade de France on May 21, although they need just four more points to break the Ligue 1 record of 89 that they set in 2013-14. The only disappointment for the club this season was the Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Manchester City, but Qatari chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi quashed speculation about coach Blanc's future by saying that he would stay at the club next term. Some of the PSG players, including Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Javier Pastore, were allowed to go on holiday to Las Vegas after the French League Cup win. Rennes coach Rolland Courbis though brushed off any thoughts that the weekend trip could affect their performance or fitness levels on Friday. ""Given that they have had three days' rest, I have other things to do than to judge PSG players and they had permission to go to Las Vegas,"" he told sports daily L'Equipe. ""I would have preferred them to have just played in the Champions League semi-finals, or to have just played a Ligue 1 game like Lille and Angers (on Wednesday), but we are not in charge. ""After their three days' rest, they can do what they want."" Rennes have dropped out of the race for Champions League qualification after picking up just one point in their last three matches, although Courbis still thinks that a top-six finish and a possible Europa League place are within his side's grasp with three games to go. ""Two wins could be enough to finish sixth, which would be much better than seventh,"" Courbis, whose team sit one point behind sixth-placed Lille, added. ""The minimum target for our last three games against PSG, Montpellier and Bastia is six points. ""We must stay professional and not let go when there is still something we can achieve, and that something is sixth. It's not easy, but it's not impossible."" It will be tough for Rennes to pick up one of their two targeted victories at the Parc des Princes, where PSG have lost just once in 37 league matches. Having said that, the Brittany club have only been defeated twice in their last eight Ligue 1 trips to the capital. German goalkeeper Kevin Trapp is likely to return in place of Salvatore Sirigu for PSG, with Di Maria and Ibrahimovic looking to cap off a week in which they were both nominated for the Ligue 1 Player of the Year award. Courbis has said that striker Kamil Grosicki is a doubt with a muscle problem, while Fallou Diagne is suspended."

After a serious slump in the first half of the season last year's winner Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette failed to make the cut despite his 12 goals since January. Winner in 2013 and 2014 Zlatan Ibrahimovic is Ligue 1's top scorer with 32 goals and is top passer with 13 assists and looks to be hot favourite to pick up a third award in the final season of his PSG contract. Angel di Maria has also run defences ragged but cannot boast the same statistics or wield the same authority as his Swedish teammate. Playmaker Ben Arfa has been unstoppable with the ball at his feet and has led Nice to the brink of Champions League qualification in scintillating style and scored 17 Ligue 1 goals. While Diarra's performances have been the one constant in Marseille's awful season, the former Chelsea, Arsenal and Real Madrid star is tipped to join arch rivals PSG in the summer. The Player's Union also elect a coach of the year with PSG handler Laurent Blanc in the running after winning the League and League Cup with a French Cup final to come. Ben Arfa's coach Claude Puel, who took Monaco to the 2004 Champions League final, may well pip Blanc after a thrilling season at Nice. Also on the list are early season form team Angers' coach Stephane Moulin and Thierry Laurey who has worked wonders on a shoe-string budget at relegation threatened Corsican minnows Gazelec Ajaccio. Players short list: Hatem Ben Arfa (FRA/Nice), Lassana Diarra (FRA/Marseille), Angel Di Maria (ARG/PSG), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (SWE/PSG) Coaches short list: Laurent Blanc (FRA/Paris SG), Thierry Laurey (FRA/Gazélec Ajaccio), Stéphane Moulin (FRA/Angers), Claude Puel (FRA/Nice)"

737,23/04/2016,23:25,PSG beat Lille to retain French League Cup,Ten-man Paris Saint-Germain beat Lille 2-1 in the French League Cup final at the Stade de France on Saturday to remain on course for a domestic clean sweep of titles.,"The Ligue 1 champions took the lead five minutes before half-time in contentious circumstances, with Javier Pastore's shot passing through the legs of an offside Layvin Kurzawa on its way into the net. But Lille hit back shortly after the restart when Djibril Sidibe fired a free-kick through the wall and into the net. The capital city side were dealt a huge blow when Adrien Rabiot was shown a second yellow card for a cynical foul on the impressive Sofiane Boufal with 20 minutes remaining. But a moment of madness from Lille goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama allowed Angel Di Maria to roll in the winner with 16 minutes to play for his 15th goal of the season. Laurent Blanc's men now have three trophies this term with a French Cup final against Marseille to come, as they look to ease the pain of their Champions League quarter-final defeat to Manchester City. ""My players, even at 10 against 11, wanted to win that game,"" coach Blanc told television channel France 2, after his team won the final for the third year in a row. ""We have a season to finish in the league and the French Cup on May 21, when we can end on a good note. ""Now we have already won the League Cup, I hope my players will be focused and motivated for the French Cup."" PSG thrashed Bastia 4-0 12 months ago to seal a record fifth League Cup title, while Lille were playing in the final of the competition for the first time. Blanc opted to play Lucas Moura alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Di Maria up front, leaving Edinson Cavani on the bench, while the returning Marco Verratti was named among the substitutes. PSG should have taken the lead just 21 seconds in, but after being set up by Ibrahimovic, Di Maria drilled his shot from only 10 yards out straight at Enyeama, who made an excellent save. Lille, who came into this match on a six-game winning streak, grew into the contest and PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu had to be alert to prevent Marquinhos from putting through his own net after Mounir Obbadi's pass caused panic in the defence. The holders though broke the deadlock when a corner was only cleared as far as Pastore. The Argentine's scuffed volley took a wicked deflection to beat Enyeama, whose furious appeals that Kurzawa was interfering with play from an offside position were waved away. Enyeama had to be dragged away from the officials at the interval, but Lille channelled their frustrations perfectly by levelling in the 49th minute. Sirigu, who has only been first-choice keeper in the cup competitions in his final campaign in France, was left apoplectic at his defenders after full-back Sidibe grabbed his sixth goal of the season with a low free-kick that split the wall in two. Things went from bad to worse for PSG when they were reduced to ten men after Rabiot hacked down the marauding Boufal. The deciding goal was one of the most bizarre of the season, and Nigerian keeper Enyeama was at fault. A long clearance from Sirigu was nodded through for Di Maria by Lille's Adama Soumaoro, but despite having defenders covering, Enyeama raced 30 yards out of his goal to give the PSG forward the simple task of knocking the ball past him and into a gaping net. Frederic Antonetti's Lille had chances to equalise, with Soumaoro heading wide from a free-kick and Obbadi seeing his volley bounce agonisingly past the post, but PSG held on."

The capital city club's main aim this term was to conquer Europe, only to be beaten by Manchester City as they bowed out at the quarter-final stage for the fourth year in a row. But after wrapping up the Ligue 1 title in record time, PSG are just two wins away from successfully defending their cup trophies, after setting up a mouthwatering French Cup final against arch rivals Marseille by beating Lorient on Tuesday. Talismanic striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic grabbed the winner in the 75th minute with his 42nd goal of a fantastic farewell season. The rest of the campaign still appears full of possibilities for the league champions, but Blanc is under pressure to at least match the feats of 12 months ago. The French coach is still sweating on the fitness of key midfielder Marco Verratti, who has been out since February 20 with a groin problem, for the Lille clash, while David Luiz may miss out with an ankle injury. Luiz's absence would mean that Marquinhos partners captain Thiago Silva in central defence, as he did in the European exit to Man City. Goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu looks set to leave the club at the end of the season after being replaced as number one by German Kevin Trapp, but he could still make an indelible mark with his last two matches likely to be the two cup finals. PSG are on course for a third successive French League Cup and are the record five-time winners of the competition, while Lille have never lifted the trophy and will be playing in the final for the first time. Lille will be tough opponents on Saturday though, after a recent resurgence in form under the tutelage of new coach Frederic Antonetti. Earlier this season they were struggling for goals and embroiled in a relegation battle, but a thumping 5-1 semi-final win over Bordeaux sparked them into life. A six-match winning streak, during which they have scored 16 goals, has propelled them to within just four points of the Champions League places with four Ligue 1 games remaining. ""We will not hide, we know where we're coming from and things will not totally change just because we have won six matches,"" Lille midfielder Florent Balmont told sports daily L'Equipe. ""We are nothing but outsiders for this final. PSG have so many great players. ""We know very well that if we are just average that will not be enough. We must play the perfect match, but we have nothing to lose."" The prodigious talent of Sofiane Boufal has shone through for Lille in recent weeks, with the Moroccan winger scoring a stunning volley as part of a hat-trick in a 4-2 win at Gazelec Ajaccio last Saturday. Portuguese international striker Eder has also chipped in with five goals since joining on loan from Swansea City in January, and suddenly the team look to be a far more potent force. Antonetti with be without central defender Renato Civelli as the Argentine starts a three-game ban, although winger Mounir Obbadi should be fit to start after returning to action from the bench in Corsica at the weekend."
739,19/04/2016,23:12,Ibrahimovic fires PSG into French Cup final,Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a typically brilliant goal as Paris Saint-Germain beat Lorient 1-0 away in a French Cup semi-final on Tuesday.,"The Cup holders and Ligue 1 champions will now face either second tier Sochaux or arch rivals Marseille in the final. The Parisians are bidding for a second successive clean sweep of the domestic honours in France and face Lille in the League Cup final this weekend. Ibrahimovic picked up the ball from a Di Maria pass and ran straight at goal from 40 yards out before curling a shot with the outside of his right boot around Lorient goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte from the edge of the area. Everyone had been expecting the Swede to pass but instead he racked up a 43rd goal in all competitions this season. Ligue 1's 11th placed side Lorient had put up little to worry the Parisians until then but second string keeper Salvatore Sirigu made a crucial late save when called upon. Both Ibrahimovic and strike partner Edinson Cavani went close as PSG peppered the Lorient goal in the first half after coach Laurent Blanc had put out a strong side. PSG midfielder Blasie Matuidi deflected suggestions it had been a close game saying his side had always been comfortable. ""We're in the final for the second year running, two finals for the second year running in fact. That was the objective and we did it. We were not great and neither was the pitch but we did the necessary,"" he told French television. PSG became the first team to bow out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage for four years in a row when they were beaten 3-2 on aggregate by Manchester City last week. Marseille, who fired coach Michel on Tuesday, have the chance to put a silver lining on an otherwise woeful campaign when they go to second-tier Sochaux in the second semi-final on Wednesday. OM slipped to a 2-1 defeat at Monaco on Sunday night as their winless run in the league extended to 10 matches. Michel has been replaced until the end of the season by his assistant Franck Passi, who will be helped by club legend Basile Boli, recently working as an ambassador for the club. Sochaux have picked up some big scalps this season though in their run to the last four, having seen off Nantes in the quarter-finals and Monaco in the last 16."

Zlatan Ibrahimovic returned to form with a brace at the Parc des Princes to take his tally for the season to 41 goals in all competitions, and he will be confident of causing problems for a Lorient team who have lost their last seven meetings with PSG. Caen were perfect opponents at the weekend as they had little to play for and PSG looked back to their best after Blanc returned to a familiar 4-3-3 formation. The main target this term was to conquer Europe, but despite Blanc appearing pleased to avoid the ""ogres of European football"" in Barcelona and Bayern Munich, PSG failed to make the most of the last-eight draw and were beaten by a Kevin De Bruyne strike at the Etihad Stadium. Now the coach says that they are fully focused on repeating their domestic clean sweep of last season, having already wrapped up the Ligue 1 title in record time and won the season-opening Champions Trophy. After facing Lorient, they take on Lille in the French League Cup final at the Stade de France on Saturday. ""At the start of the season the objective was to go as far as possible in the Champions League and especially get to the semi-finals, but also to win one of the domestic cups as well as the league,"" said Blanc, who last week claimed that his job is always under threat. ""But the reality is that we want to try to win everything. We still have a final and a semi-final to play, so the end of the season is still exciting. ""For PSG, as we are out of the Champions League, people say that it is all finished. But we still have two trophies to win."" Extra motivation for PSG is the fact that a successful defence of the French Cup would draw them level alongside arch-rivals Marseille as the competition's record 10-time winners. Lorient are looking to emulate the heroes of 2002, when Jean-Claude Darcheville scored the only goal in the final against Bastia. Marseille and their under-fire coach Michel have the chance to put a silver lining on an otherwise woeful campaign and they go to second-tier Sochaux in the second semi-final on Wednesday. OM slipped to a 2-1 defeat at Monaco on Sunday night as their winless run in the league extended to 10 matches. But the cup has provided some solace, and the draw has pitted them against lower-league opponents for the third successive round, leaving a heavyweight final clash with PSG still a strong possibility. Sochaux have picked up some big scalps this season though in their run to the last four, having seen off Nantes in the quarter-finals and Monaco in the last 16. Their cup exploits have given Albert Cartier's side a boost in the league too, with a five-match unbeaten run dragging them away from danger of being relegated to France's third division. The last of Sochaux's five major trophies came in the French Cup in 2007 when they beat Marseille on penalties in the final. French Cup semi-final fixtures (kick-offs 1900 GMT)"
741,16/04/2016,19:11,Zlatan leads PSG thrashing of Caen,Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paris Saint Germain ripped Ligue 1 rivals Caen to pieces in a 6-0 thrashing at the Parc des Princes on Saturday sending the champions 30 points clear at the top.,"The result follows PSG's disappointing 3-2 aggregate Champions League quarter-finals defeat to Manchester City, and backs up some theories to why they failed to make the semis again. On the day Paris won this season's Ligue 1 title it was with a 9-0 victory over bottom club Troyes, and there have been other five goal romps even as PSG rotate their squad amid theories their continental failure stems from a lack of competition to the Qatari bankrolled supers quad. Ibrahimovic scored twice, both emphatic finishes, taking his tally to 32 league goals to equal his record, while Argentine playmaker Angel di Maria, so ineffective against City, netted with a sumptuous lob. Other goals came from the returning Blaise Matuidi, banned for the City game, a typically marauding Edinson Cavani run and shot made it 5-0 and defender Maxwell tuned home a Cavani cross for 6-0. Coach Laurent Blanc had made a string of changes, but Caen, who went into the game ninth in Ligue 1, were simply blown off the park. If the stands featured uncomfortable gaps and some early whistling may have embarrased the home side, they must now turn their attentions to the French Cup semi-final with Lorient on Tuesday and the League Cup final against resurgent Lille next Saturday at the Stade de France. On Friday Alexandre Lacazette grabbed a late equaliser as 10-man Lyon salvaged a 1-1 draw in the chase for second place in Ligue 1 in a match stopped to clear up a snowstorm of ripped up newspapers. Nice took an 18th minute lead after Valere Germain beat a Lyon off-side trap while Lacazette prodded home in the 82nd minute after Mathieu Valbuana had hit the bar as the sides struggle to claim Ligue 1's second automatic Champions League berth. The result means Lyon remain second on 56 points after 34 games while Monaco are third on 55 ahead of their trip to Marseille Sunday and Nice are fourth on 54."
742,15/04/2016,16:10,Blanc claims his job is always under threat,"Laurent Blanc claimed on Friday that his job has been in danger since he joined Paris Saint-Germain as coach, after his team bowed out of the Champions League with a quarter-final defeat to Manchester City.","The Frenchman led PSG to a domestic treble of Ligue 1, French Cup and French League Cup titles last season, but the main objective for the club's billionaire owners, Qatar Sports Investments, remains to conquer Europe. The capital city side became the first team to ever exit the Champions League in the quarters for four successive seasons with a 3-2 aggregate loss to City. After expressing his delight at avoiding 'the ogres of European football' in Barcelona and Bayern Munich in the last eight, Blanc is now under pressure after failing to make the most of the supposed favourable draw. ""I have been in danger ever since I signed at PSG,"" Blanc told a press conference on Friday. ""You know that a coach is always in the hot seat, the only thing that gives you immunity from that is winning, and the last game we lost, and did not qualify."" PSG are still well-placed to successfully defend their trio of domestic trophies, having already wrapped up the Ligue 1 title in record time, and with a French League Cup final and a French Cup semi-final to look forward too. They will look to take out their European frustrations on Caen when they return to league action at the Parc des Princes on Saturday. Influential midfielder Marco Verratti missed Tuesday's second leg at the Etihad Stadium, and Blanc says that a comeback for the injured Italian is not imminent. ""Marco is following his programme, every day is an extra step forwards for him, but a return against Caen on Saturday is inconceivable for me,"" Blanc said. Verratti has not played for the club since a 4-1 league win over Reims on February 20."
743,13/04/2016,16:13,Defeat could spell end of road for PSG's Ibra generation,Defeat by Manchester City in the Champions League could mean the exit of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and his exalted generation at Paris Saint-Germain.,"Qatar Sports Investments have spent heavily at the French club to win the Champions League. Under Laurent Blanc they have won four straight French titles but now have become the first team to lose in four straight Champions League quarter finals. ""We are very disappointed with the result,"" said a visibly drained Paris president Nasser al-Khelaifi in a warning after the 1-0 defeat at Manchester on Tuesday which saw a 3-2 aggregate defeat. ""It's the fourth time we reach the quarter-finals and are eliminated. Now we have to take a step back and analyse what has happened."" Ibrahimovic, 34, is out of contract at the end of the season. The Swedish superstar, who has never won a Champions League, has already been linked to a move to the English Premier League. Al-Khelaifi said last month he wants Ibrahimovic to stay. But a summer rebuilding exercise could prove a game changer. Brazilian defender Maxwell is also 34 and with no deal after June. Brazilian-born Italian Thiago Motto is 33 and also coming to the end of his contract, like Dutch right back Gregory van der Wiel. Paris have the means and the desire to sign a new superstar, with Barcelona's Brazilian scorer Neymar apparently on their wish-list. Al-Khelaifi will surely be tempted to add new faces while keeping the likes of Angel di Maria, Thiago Silva and Marco Verratti. The other question mark surrounds Blanc, who has a contract until 2018 but has the Champions League failures hanging over his record. ""The future? We have a season to finish. We have a French Cup semi-final to try to win and a League Cup final to win,"" Blanc said. ""I know that doesn't have the same flavour, the same excitement as the Champions League but we owe it to ourselves to win them for the club. ""We are very disappointed but we will have to get over it."" Blanc was in the firing line after abandoning his usual 4-3-3 formation to play with three central defenders for the first half against City. It was a gamble that backfired and one that followed a disappointing performance in the first leg at the Parc des Princes. ""What a fiasco"" screamed the front page headline on sports daily L'Equipe as the search for someone to blame began. Former French international David Ginola said on BT Sport television that Paris were ""lazy"" against Manchester City and he doubted whether Blanc would still be in charge for the 2016-17 season. Blanc said ""City are a very, very good team and we need to congratulate them, but I think we can be disappointed because we could and should have done better."" ""In the first half we played with a new system and what happened, happened,"" said Ibrahimovic who saw City goalkeeper Joe Hart brilliantly save two of his free kicks. ""If it had gone well, nobody would say anything, and now people will say we gave it away. The second half was better, when we reverted to our normal tactics, but we gave away two games."" From a French viewpoint, the Paris performance leaves a sense of deja vu. Twelve times in the last 13 seasons a French side has appeared in the Champions League quarter-finals, and only twice have they gone further. One was Monaco in 2004 while the other was Lyon, semi-finalists in 2010."
744,13/04/2016,09:34,PSG left haunted by familiar feeling of failure,Paris Saint-Germain have some serious soul-searching to do after once again coming up short in the Champions League as they exited the competition at the hands of Manchester City on Tuesday.,"A 1-0 defeat in England saw PSG lose 3-2 on aggregate as they became the first team to lose in the quarter-finals of the Champions League in four consecutive seasons. After losing twice to Barcelona and once on away goals to Chelsea in the previous three campaigns, this was supposed to be the year Paris went one further and reached the semi-finals for the first time since being taken over by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011. Before last week's first leg against City, PSG coach Laurent Blanc had spoken of his relief at avoiding ""the two ogres of European football at the moment"", in Bayern Munich and Barcelona, as well as Real Madrid. Those three have become regulars in the last four of Europe's elite club competition in recent seasons and PSG aspire to join them, but they came up short against a City side enduring a disappointing season in England and appearing in their first ever Champions League quarter-final. Having already wrapped up a fourth successive French title, PSG are still on course to complete a clean sweep of the domestic honours for the second season running, but it is in Europe where they are to be judged these days given the enormous sums of money invested by their owners. ""What a fiasco"" screamed the front page headline on sports daily L'Equipe on Wednesday, as the search for someone to blame began. Blanc was in the firing line after abandoning his usual 4-3-3 formation to play with three central defenders at kick-off against City. It was a gamble that backfired and one that followed a disappointing performance in the first leg at the Parc des Princes. ""In the two matches they were incapable of imposing the rhythm required. It was not enough to try to win a match in the quarter-finals of the Champions League,"" Jerome Rothen, a former PSG player who featured in the 2004 final for Monaco and now working as a pundit, said on beIN Sports. From a French viewpoint it is a familiar failing -- 12 times in the last 13 seasons a French side has appeared in the quarter-finals, and only twice have they gone further. One of those was Monaco in 2004 while the other was Lyon, semi-finalists in 2010. But while those two surprised many by getting so far, there is pressure on PSG to reach the last four and even win the Champions League. The question now is, what does the future hold? ""The future? We have a season to finish. We have a French Cup semi-final to try to win and a League Cup final to win,"" Blanc said. ""I know that doesn't have the same flavour, the same excitement as the Champions League but we owe it to ourselves to win them for the club. We are very disappointed but we will have to get over it."" Once they have done that, the club may be tempted to clear the decks and freshen up the squad. Now is perhaps the time, with several leading players soon out of contract. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is the superstar of this PSG project, but the Swede is now 34 and has always been associated with failure in the Champions League, never having won it in his otherwise glittering career. Ibrahimovic's deal expires in the summer, while Maxwell and Gregory van der Wiel are out of contract at the end of the season too. The club have the means and the desire to sign a new superstar, with Neymar apparently on their wish-list, and Al-Khelaifi will surely be tempted to add new faces while keeping the likes of Angel di Maria, Thiago Silva and Marco Verratti. The other question mark surrounds Blanc, who has done a fine job overall and has a contract until 2018 but has now been to four Champions League quarter-finals as a coach and lost them all."
745,12/04/2016,23:41,"PSG not good enough, admits Blanc","Paris Saint-Germain got what they deserved as they were knocked out of the Champions League at the quarter-final stage by Manchester City on Tuesday, admitted coach Laurent Blanc.","Much-fancied PSG were eliminated at the quarter-final stage for the fourth campaign running after losing 1-0 to City at the Etihad Stadium to exit the competition 3-2 on aggregate. ""Over the two matches it is not exactly false,"" Blanc told beIN Sports when asked if the French champions had not been at their best. ""I think over the two games, especially this one, we tried to do what we wanted to do but maybe we just didn't have what was required. ""City are a very, very good team and we need to congratulate them, but I think we can be disappointed because we could and should have done better. ""City can be satisfied because they played with greater intensity in defensive phases and our big problem was that we didn't manage to score when we were on top in either leg and when that happens it's difficult to win a match."" Blanc sprang a major surprise by abandoning his usual 4-3-3 formation to play with three central defenders up against City's lone striker Sergio Aguero. It was a move that failed miserably, with PSG never getting going even before losing Thiago Motta to injury late in the first half. ""We analysed things and we also took into account the suspensions of David Luiz and Blaise Matuidi,"" said Blanc, who was also without the injured Marco Verratti. ""We saw in the first leg that they have lively and fast players going forward and so we wanted to protect ourselves in the middle. ""We got ourselves into trouble all by ourselves in the first half. That is the big regret because that happened in the first leg too."""
746,12/04/2016,22:46,De Bruyne downs PSG as Man City reach last four,Manchester City reached the Champions League semi-finals for the first time after Kevin De Bruyne's fine 76th-minute goal earned them a 1-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday.,"A week on from their 2-2 draw in the French capital, City saw Sergio Aguero squander a first-half penalty after he had been felled by PSG goalkeeper Kevin Trapp, but De Bruyne's late strike settled the Etihad Stadium nerves and completed a 3-2 aggregate success. Fifteen points off the pace in the Premier League and widely considered the tie's underdogs, City advance with hope intact that manager Manuel Pellegrini may yet bow out with a Champions League winner's medal around his neck before handing over to Pep Guardiola. But it was a bitterly disappointing evening for PSG coach Laurent Blanc, who lost Thiago Motta to injury and has now seen his team eliminated in the quarter-finals four seasons in a row. The French champions' ambitious Qatari owners must once again content themselves with the pursuit of another domestic quadruple, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic, whose contract expires at the end of the season, may never grace the continental stage in their colours again. The burst of sky-blue tickertape that greeted the teams as they entered the pitch illustrated the importance of the occasion to both clubs, while PSG's shape at kick-off confirmed pre-match reports that they would be set out in an untested 3-4-1-2 system. With Angel di Maria operating in a free role, PSG had plenty of options in midfield and they made an assured start, City goalkeeper Joe Hart forced to make a finger-tip save from a zinging Ibrahimovic free-kick. But as City began to probe, so they exposed fissures in PSG's new-look defence and after Aguero had twice shot wide, a loose pass from auxiliary right-sided centre-back Serge Aurier allowed Fernandinho to set Aguero clear. Sliding out, Trapp felled the Argentina striker with his feet, but the presence of two covering defenders meant that he was only booked and from the penalty, Aguero placed the ball a foot wide of the right-hand post. It was a let-off for the visitors, but after another careless Aurier pass had allowed Jesus Navas to curl wide, they suffered a further blow when Motta went off holding the back of his left thigh. With Blaise Matuidi suspended and Marco Verratti injured, it left PSG without their entire first-choice midfield and Blanc promptly rejigged, sending on Lucas Moura and reverting to his trusted 4-3-3. Although City, gamely, continued to push in search of a goal that would have given them an outright lead, PSG began to knock on the door at the other end. Hart had to parry another stinging Ibrahimovic free-kick and then clubbed the ball over his crossbar after Thiago Silva's header from a Lucas corner spat up off the turf towards him. The introduction of Javier Pastore for the hapless Aurier, on the hour, left PSG with their full attacking armada on show, but it was De Bruyne who stole the headlines, brilliantly shaping a right-foot shot into the bottom-right corner from outside the box to crush PSG's spirit. City's fans had to endure a couple more nervous moments, with Hart rushing out superbly to save from Edinson Cavani and Ibrahimovic seeing a goal ruled out for offside, before the final whistle rubber-stamped their club's arrival in the European big-time."
747,12/04/2016,02:00,"Heat on Ronaldo, Ibrahimovic to turn tables on Wolfsburg and City",Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain will look to their superstar strikers Cristiano Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic in desperate bids to clinch Champions League semi-final berths against Wolfsburg and Manchester City on Tuesday.,"The Parisians were held 2-2 at the Parc des Princes last Wednesday when Ibrahimovic missed a spot-kick and fluffed a one-on-one with Joe Hart, before ruthlessly exploiting a City error to net an equaliser. A 'Clasico' hangover was the way many described Real Madrid's shock 2-0 quarter-final first-leg defeat at Wolfsburg, which followed an away win in La Liga to arch rivals Barcelona. Poor performances from Real's stars were glaring as Gareth Bale was kept quiet and Ronaldo rarely shook off his markers. The three-time Ballon d'Or winner did have the ball in the back of the Wolfsburg goal within 74 seconds, but the Portuguese then threw up his arms in horrified disbelief at an offside flag. Never lacking in confidence Ronaldo, who has scored 13 goals in the competition so far this season, vowed his side would grind out a qualifying result. ""Tuesday has to be a magical night,"" said the Portuguese. ""The key objective is getting through to the next round. It is the only option that will allow us players and the fans to leave the stadium happy."" Regardless of his astonishing scoring record Ronaldo was kept quiet over both legs of last season's quarter-final 1-0 aggregate victory over Atletico Madrid as Javier Hernandez grabbed the crucial goal from a Ronaldo assist. Germany international Julian Draxler identified the Portugal captain as the main threat to Wolfsburg and also pointed out he has a habit of scoring against German sides. ""You can only be impressed with Cristiano Ronaldo,"" said Draxler. ""But at the end of the day, this is about Wolfsburg versus Real Madrid, not Wolfsburg versus Ronaldo."" PSG have hung their hopes on Ibrahimovic and have been rewarded with a constant flow of goals, assists and towering authority on the pitch and in the dressing room. After a hat-trick in a 4-1 league win over Nice the weekend before last, the 34-year-old striker has equalled his best ever goals tally in a Ligue 1 season and has 39 for the campaign in all competitions. But doubts linger over Ibrahimovic's Champions League legacy as he has rarely shone against top competition in Europe. He has 30 goals from 26 league games, but a more modest five in the Champions League this season. But as with Ronaldo, self-confidence would not seem to be the issue. ""I have never played as well,"" he said on Monday. ""I'm in the form of my life. I was born old and I'll die young."" Out of contract with PSG this summer, Ibrahimovic will need to deliver something against City if he wishes to prolong his stay at the ambitious Qatari-owned outfit."
748,11/04/2016,19:28,Man City seek to seize moment against PSG,European expansionists Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain resume their pursuit of new frontiers on Tuesday with their Champions League quarter-final delicately balanced at 2-2 following last week's first leg.,"Both clubs are fuelled by vast Middle Eastern wealth and both have landmarks in sight: for Qatar-backed PSG, a first semi-final appearance since 1995; for UAE-funded City, an unprecedented last-four berth. Away goals by Kevin De Bruyne and Fernandinho at the Parc des Princes unexpectedly left City in the driving seat, but the attacking armada at PSG coach Laurent Blanc's disposal means that his City counterpart Manuel Pellegrini will not instruct his side to sit on their advantage. ""I think that the most important aspect of this team is always to score,"" Pellegrini said. ""We are working here for around three years and for three years I always have the same answer. It is a team that is prepared to score goals, a team that is prepared to play. ""If we think that tomorrow (Tuesday) we need to try to draw 0-0, I think that we are going to lose the game. It's not in the way we normally play. ""Tomorrow you will see the same team that you have seen the last two and a half seasons here."" With PSG having already successfully defended their Ligue 1 crown and on course to repeat last season's domestic quadruple, they were widely expected to get the better of City, who are 15 points behind leaders Leicester City in the Premier League. But City seized the opportunities that came their way in Paris, going ahead via De Bruyne and then equalising through Fernandinho after a freak Zlatan Ibrahimovic goal and a close-range Adrien Rabiot effort appeared to have given Blanc's men control of the tie. The result was a major anti-climax for PSG, eliminated at this stage of the tournament for the past three seasons, and their disappointment was hardened by bookings for centre-back David Luiz and midfielder Blaise Matuidi that ruled both players out of the second leg. Marquinhos will deputise for his Brazilian compatriot Luiz at the Etihad Stadium, but Marco Verratti, sidelined for seven weeks with a groin injury, seems unlikely to step in for Matuidi after Blanc said on Monday that he would require a ""miracle"" to play. City will also be bereft of vital experience in central defence, with Pellegrini declaring captain Vincent Kompany unavailable despite his return to training on Monday after a calf injury. In Kompany's absence, Eliaquim Mangala will continue to deputise alongside Nicolas Otamendi, who will play despite twisting his ankle in Saturday's 2-1 win over West Bromwich Albion. Raheem Sterling is out with a groin problem, while Samir Nasri is ineligible, having returned to action following a hamstring injury earlier than anticipated, but David Silva and Yaya Toure are both fit after recent lay-offs. With Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and defending champions Barcelona in varying situations of peril in their own last-eight ties, the path to the final for Tuesday's victors could be less arduous than expected. Both teams yearn for success in Europe, but with PSG starved of the international exposure that City take for granted in the Premier League, elimination would be a particularly bitter pill for them to swallow. ""It's true that we've reached the quarter-finals three times. I understand the immense expectation, but if we reach the semi-finals, there will be expectation for the final,"" Blanc said. ""And it won't stop until the day Paris Saint-Germain win the European Cup. That's a certainty, with or without me. ""As long as PSG haven't won the European Cup, there will be an expectation and everyone will be under pressure -- last 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, final. ""You have to win the final because the project of the club is to win the European Cup. But we also have to show progress and tomorrow we have a chance to confirm that progress."""

He took part in City's final pre-match training session at the club's City Football Academy complex, but Pellegrini said that he would not feature against PSG. ""Vincent Kompany is not 100 percent,"" Kompany told his pre-match press conference, adding that it was ""not possible"" for him to play. Kompany's fellow centre-back Nicolas Otamendi did not take part in full training, having hurt his ankle in Saturday's 2-1 win over West Bromwich Albion, but Pellegrini said he would be able to play. ""Nico twisted his ankle in the last game,"" said the Chilean. ""He has some pain, but it's not dangerous."" Playmaker David Silva, who missed the West Brom game with an ankle problem, is also available, but Raheem Sterling remains absent with a groin injury and Samir Nasri is ineligible. City are bidding to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time, while French champions PSG graced the last four once in 1995."

After last Wednesday's first leg, which ended in a 2-2 draw at the Parc des Princes, Blanc said there was no chance Verratti or Javier Pastore would be fit for the return in England. However, Blanc later suggested that he was hopeful Verratti could make a miracle recovery in time to feature. Pastore, who has been troubled by a calf problem, was also included by Blanc, who kept his options open by naming 22 players in his squad for the trip. PSG will be without David Luiz and Blaise Matuidi, who are both suspended after being booked in the first leg."
752,11/04/2016,02:15,PSG's Di Maria out to banish Manchester ghosts,Angel di Maria will attempt to exorcise some personal ghosts when he returns to Manchester for Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League quarter-final second leg at Manchester City on Tuesday.,"The 28-year-old Argentina international endured a miserable time in the city with Manchester United last season, with a traumatic burglary expediting his departure at the end of the campaign. But whereas his position was constantly chopped and changed by United manager Louis van Gaal, he has benefited from being consistently selected on the wing at PSG, which has yielded a stirring return to form. ""It's not nice to say certain things, but it's more that they didn't let me settle properly than I couldn't settle,"" Di Maria said of his experience at United in a recent BBC interview. ""I started a game in one position, then the next game in another. I scored goals playing in one position, then suddenly the next game I was picked to play in a different position."" Hailing PSG head coach Laurent Blanc, Di Maria added: ""From the beginning he was clear where he wanted to play me and has never changed his mind. ""He gave me total freedom to move where I needed to move. I'm very happy here and it wasn't the case over there."" Handed United's fabled number seven shirt after a club-record £59.7 million ($84.3 million, 74 million euros) transfer from Real Madrid, Di Maria could scarcely have arrived at Old Trafford amid greater fanfare. But despite a promising start, including a delicious lob at Leicester City, Manchester would not prove a happy home for the man nicknamed 'Fideo' (Noodle) on account of his skinny frame. Van Gaal continually changed his role, even fielding him as a lone striker at one stage, and a succession of injuries prevented him from finding any rhythm. The nadir arrived in late January last year when a group of burglars armed with scaffolding poles attempted to smash their way into Di Maria's luxurious home while he, his wife and one-year-old daughter cowered inside. Di Maria promptly moved his family into a hotel and with Van Gaal admitting to feeling concerned about his star recruit's state of mind, the Argentine's form never recovered. Sent off for manhandling the referee in an FA Cup defeat by Arsenal in March, he was unable to win his place in the team back and spent the rest of the season on the bench. He left United having scored four goals and supplied 10 assists in 32 appearances. With PSG he has scored nine more goals and provided three more assists, despite having only played in six more games. Aligned on the right flank in an attacking triumvirate completed by Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani, Di Maria has freedom to roam infield and has looked a far happier player in the French capital. ""You have to be intelligent to roam around like Angel does,"" says Blanc. ""In particular, he has that ability to accelerate the tempo and an excellent vision of the game."" Man of the match in Real's victory over Atletico Madrid in the 2014 Champions League final, Di Maria was signed to give PSG's first XI an injection of the know-how required to win the competition. He was decisive in the last-16 victory over Chelsea, delivering assists for Cavani and Ibrahimovic in either leg of a 4-2 aggregate success, but failed to sparkle in last week's 2-2 draw with City. Ironically, given his complaints about his treatment at United, the suspension of Blaise Matuidi and injuries to Marco Verratti and Javier Pastore could see him moved into central midfield at the Etihad Stadium. But should he inspire PSG to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since 1995, the city of Manchester will no longer represent quite such a stain on his CV."
753,09/04/2016,19:04,Lucas lifts PSG before City showdown,A second-half brace by Lucas Moura handed a shadow Paris Saint-Germain side a 2-0 win away to Guingamp on Saturday as the Ligue 1 champions warmed up for their decisive date with Manchester City.,"The Brazilian opened the scoring with a penalty 11 minutes into the second half and struck again in the 71st minute as PSG triumphed in a game that coach Laurent Blanc had more or less admitted was an inconvenience he could have done without. PSG go to England for the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday up against it after a 2-2 draw in Paris last Wednesday. With that trip in mind, and with Paris having already secured a fourth consecutive French title last month, Blanc sent out an almost unrecognisable starting line-up in Brittany against opponents who began the day six points above the relegation zone. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Angel Di Maria, Thiago Silva, Thiago Motta, Edinson Cavani and Maxwell were all rested, with goalkeeper Kevin Trapp and captain for the day Blaise Matuidi the only players retained from the side that started at home to City. Matuidi will not play in England due to suspension, while the presence of Trapp must be in doubt after he came off at half-time, with Salvatore Sirigu taking his place, following a collision with team-mate Layvin Kurzawa. Trapp hurt his knee after crashing into Kurzawa, who was left with what looked like a broken nose but was able to carry on. The changes meant PSG were not their usual fearsome selves and a Guingamp side unbeaten in their last three outings had the best chances in the first period. However, Jimmy Briand had an effort disallowed for offside before Mevlut Erding, sliding in, failed to make contact with a low Jonathan Martins Pereira cross that was asking to be turned in. Instead, PSG took the lead early in the second half, Lucas rolling home the spot-kick after a foul inside the box by Jeremy Sorbon on the 18-year-old Christopher Nkunku. Kurzawa set up the second goal, playing a one-two with Matuidi down the left and picking out Lucas, who took a touch before slotting low past Jonas Loessl for his eighth in the league this season. Blanc will need Lucas on similar form against City, with the Brazilian a contender to start due to the absences of Marco Verratti and Javier Pastore leaving Angel Di Maria as the leading contender to line up in midfield. Elsewhere in France, Maxwell Cornet's brace gave Lyon a 2-0 victory at Montpellier on Friday that saw last season's runners-up leapfrog Monaco into second spot before the rest of the weekend's matches. Monaco face a tough test at in-form Lille on Sunday, while fourth visits fifth as Rennes travel to Nice later the same day. Saint-Etienne, in sixth, can boost their own European chances with a win when they entertain already-relegated Troyes later on Saturday."
754,08/04/2016,02:20,PSG seek boost ahead of City return,Paris Saint-Germain will use Saturday's Ligue 1 trip to Guingamp to iron out the mistakes that plagued them in their 2-2 draw against Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final.,"Laurent Blanc's side have their hands full going into next week's return leg in England having drawn Wednesday's encounter 2-2 at the Parc des Princes. ""We made too many mistakes and Manchester City punished us. You can't afford to make mistakes like this against a team of this quality,"" Zlatan Ibrahimovic told PSG TV. ""In the return leg, we have to play simple football and fix what didn't work (Wednesday). I'm confident, because I believe in myself and my team."" Ibrahimovic missed a first-half penalty against City, but the Swede made amends just before the break with his 39th goal of the season and needs just two more to match his haul from the 2013-14 campaign. Paris were beaten 1-0 on their last trip to Guingamp however and are winless in three visits to the Stade du Roudourou. Meanwhile in the race for second Lyon can crank up the pressure on faltering Monaco when they visit Montpellier on Friday where a win would send resurgent Lyon level on points. Lyon have won seven of their last nine games to charge back into contention for France's second automatic Champions League qualifying spot, and they could also welcome back Nabil Fekir for the trip to the Stade de la Mosson. The France international missed seven months with a serious knee injury but returned to action with Lyon's reserve team last weekend as he bids for a place in Didier Deschamps' squad for Euro 2016. ""To have Nabil back for the final push is good for us but you can't be too demanding right away. He's going to need to rediscover his rhythm as he gets back to 100 per cent,"" said Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. Monaco inflicted a first home defeat on PSG since May 2014 prior to the international break, but Leonardo Jardim's side then crashed to a 2-1 reverse against Bordeaux last Friday and have won just once in five outings. On Sunday, they will try to hold onto second when they visit Lille, who have undergone a remarkable turnaround under Frederic Antonetti and are gunning for a fifth win in a row. Last weekend's defeat in Paris damaged Nice's Champions League pursuit, and Claude Puel's men next face a Rennes side who are in direct competition with them for a top-three finish. Ousmane Dembele struck twice in a 3-1 victory over Reims last weekend as Rennes made it four wins in five to stay within a point of Lyon, while climbing above Nice into fourth. Saint-Etienne remain in the European picture as well and will fancy their chances of turning over Troyes, whose relegation was finally confirmed last weekend after a sixth successive defeat. Beleaguered Marseille coach Michel remains in charge at the Stade Velodrome despite presiding over an eight-match winless run that has left the traditional French giants just six points above the drop zone. Marseille are without a win at home since September, an agonising sequence of 13 matches, with Bordeaux hoping to extend their miserable run this weekend. ""The current situation is delicate and represents a big challenge for all of us,"" Marseille owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus said in a statement. ""Regarding the short term, I'm reassured by the professionalism and the desire of Michel to successfully complete the end of the season, with all his strength and energy,"" she added. Two wins in three have given Toulouse hope of escaping relegation and Pascal Dupraz's team will target a third straight home victory against Bastia on Saturday. Fixtures (kick-off times GMT)"
755,05/04/2016,02:05,Long distance travelled since last meeting,"When nouveaux riches Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City meet at the Parc des Princes in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday, they will do so as two of the ogres of the modern game.","Two of Europe's financial powerhouses thanks to their oil-rich Middle Eastern owners, City are in the last eight for the first time while PSG are there for the fourth year in succession. The stakes are high, and it will all be a far cry from the only previous meeting of the teams, only a little over seven years ago. On a cold December night in 2008, PSG visited City's Eastlands home for a UEFA Cup group stage tie that ended in an uninspiring 0-0 draw watched by 25,626 spectators. It was just a few months after City had been taken over by Sheikh Mansour and the Abu Dhabi United Group, and future England goalkeeper Joe Hart, Pablo Zabaleta and current captain Vincent Kompany were all in their team that night, as was a teenage Daniel Sturridge. None of that night's PSG team remain at the club today -- instead of Zlatan Ibrahimovic they had Peguy Luyindula and Mateja Kezman up front, while there was no Thiago Silva in defence, but Sammy Traore and Gregory Bourillon were playing. If the clubs -- whose only European silverware to date is one Cup Winners' Cup each -- have become Champions League regulars, City were only in Europe in 2008-09 as England's Fair Play representatives. PSG, meanwhile, had come close to being relegated from Ligue 1 the previous season but did win the League Cup and lost to champions Lyon in the French Cup final. Both teams went on to reach the quarter-finals, City losing to Hamburg and PSG to Dynamo Kiev, but it was an instantly forgettable encounter. ""A half-full Eastlands was given an example of European football at its most tedious,"" said the British Daily Telegraph. ""It was hardly the kind of occasion that will tempt the likes of Lionel Messi, Iker Casillas or Kaka to consider life in the blue half of Manchester."" Well, City's standing now is such that, with Pep Guardiola taking over as coach next season, it is not stretching the imagination too much to imagine Messi appearing at the Etihad Stadium at some point in the future. That year they were an emerging force and ranked 19th in analysts Deloitte's Football Money League, while PSG were nowhere to be seen. Indeed, before the clubs' meeting, Le Parisien marvelled that City's budget for the January transfer window would be twice PSG's entire budget for the year. The same Deloitte report for the 2014-15 season ranked both clubs in the top six, along with Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Bayern Munich, established superpowers who between them have won the Champions League five times since 2009 and been runners-up four times. ""Now we are in there with clubs who are as powerful as us financially, who have much greater histories and who possess players as talented as ours. This is the 'creme de la creme',"" PSG coach Laurent Blanc told France Info on Saturday. The challenge now for PSG and City -- whose combined revenues for last season were 944.3 million euros ($1.076 billion) -- is to get to the final themselves. PSG's explosion since their takeover by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011 has been more emphatic than City's, with four straight French titles compared to two since 2008 for City. City can say that competition is much fiercer in the Premier League, but they come into this tie as the outsiders, despite being able to call on the likes of Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne. That is testament to how far PSG have come in a short space of times, but these two clubs are the proof that anyone can emerge and compete with the traditional continental giants, at least if they can find an investor sitting on vast Gulf oil reserves."

""But the prospect of living in a city like Paris, and to play for a club like PSG is also a dream for every player. ""That's to say if PSG showed interest in Neymar we could talk about it."" PSG have dominated Ligue 1 since the Qatari takeover of the French capital club in 2011. Laurent Blanc's men wrapped up their fourth successive league title in record time in March, and face Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-final first leg at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday. And with talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic, courted by some of Europe's top clubs, in possibly his last season in France, PSG have reportedly identified Neymar as their number one target before the new season starts in August. Ribeiro added: ""A contract can also be dissolved on condition of paying the release clause. It's huge - 193 million euros. ""But I don't think that would be an insurmountable problem for PSG.""

758,02/04/2016,19:06,Insatiable Ibrahimovic nets hat-trick in PSG victory,Zlatan Ibrahimovic bagged a hat-trick as Paris Saint-Germain warmed up for their Champions League clash with Manchester City by beating Nice 4-1 at the Parc des Princes on Saturday.,"Ibrahimovic took his tally for the season to 30 league goals and David Luiz also scored for PSG, who secured their fourth consecutive Ligue 1 title with eight matches to spare last month, while Hatem Ben Arfa had earlier found the net for Nice. It was the best possible preparation for Paris before they host City in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday, as they bounced back from a 2-0 defeat at home to Monaco in their last outing before the international break and responded to City's 4-0 win at Bournemouth earlier in the Premier League. Coach Laurent Blanc sent out a strong side, albeit one in which youngster Hervin Ongenda made just his third league start of the season, and the capital club proved far too strong for a Nice side who started the day in third and were looking to close the gap on Monaco above them. Nice remain five points behind second-placed Monaco, who were beaten 2-1 at home by Bordeaux on Friday, and could be leapfrogged by both Lyon and Rennes with both clubs in action later this weekend. Ibrahimovic opened the scoring quarter of an hour in when he superbly controlled a high ball into the box by Luiz and fired past Nice goalkeeper Yoan Cardinale. However, the excellent Ben Arfa quickly brought Nice back on level terms with a superb strike that also exposed PSG's slight weakness in defence. The France winger saw centre-backs Luiz and Thiago Silva back off him, giving him the time and space to send a curling shot past Kevin Trapp into the top-left corner for his 14th goal of the season in all competitions. Nevertheless, PSG were back in front before the break thanks to a stunning Ibrahimovic free-kick, the Swede sending a rocket of a shot into the top-left corner from the edge of the area to make it 2-1. Brazil centre-back Luiz increased PSG's lead three minutes into the second half with a near-post header from a corner and Ibrahimovic completed his hat-trick eight minutes from time after being set up by Adrien Rabiot. The 34-year-old striker, who is out contract in the summer, has now equalled his best ever goals tally in a Ligue 1 season and has 38 for the campaign in all competitions."
759,02/04/2016,17:54,Cavani laments 'hardest three years' at PSG,Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani has admitted his time at Paris Saint-Germain has been the hardest of his career in an interview with French television station TF1 due to be broadcast on Sunday.,"""I have had the three hardest years of my career,"" Cavani, who joined PSG from Italian side Napoli in 2013, told TF1 show Telefoot. ""There have been positives and negatives, but a player can always improve, grow and become more mature, both as a player and as a man."" Just back from international duty, Cavani was again left on the bench for PSG's Ligue 1 game at home to Nice on Saturday and is likely to remain there for Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg against Manchester City at the Parc des Princes. The Uruguayan, who has scored 19 goals this season, is under contract in the French capital until 2018. Despite his consistently impressive figures in front of goal, the 29-year-old has had to live in the shadow of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and his future at PSG beyond this season appears uncertain. ""I only think about giving my maximum for the next few months and of having a fantastic finish to the season, just like we did last year,"" Cavani adds in the interview. ""After that I am sure I will have the chance to speak to the club and with the president (Nasser Al-Khelaifi)."" Dismissing any suggestion of resentment towards Ibrahimovic, who is out of contract this summer, Cavani adds: ""Ibrahimovic is having a great season. It is very important for us that he is at such a high level. ""Everything that has been written and said in the press has been invented and made up in France. ""Today our ambition is to win the Champions League. We have a better team now, more solid, and we have been playing together for a long time."""
760,01/04/2016,16:01,PSG awaiting positive sign from Ibrahimovic,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc said Friday the Ligue 1 champions were patiently awaiting a decision from Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic concerning his future.,"""Zlatan? We are still in reflection and discussion. Our wish is to talk with him to see what he wants exactly, we know what we want from him; after if we click we'll see,"" said Blanc of the 34-year-old Swede whose contract expires at the end of the season. ""I've nothing new to tell you on that subject; remain patient, it's not signs that we need but certitudes,"" Blanc added, telling journalists: ""If one day you are out of contract, you'll do the same thing, you'd contact everyone."" Ibrahimovic has not ruled out remaining with the French champions, his agent Mino Raiola revealed. Raiola said the Swede has received several offers including one from China and three from Italy's top flight, where Ibrahimovic won titles with Juventus, Inter Milan and AC Milan. But the Dutchman said Ibrahimovic, who will lead Sweden at this summer's Euro 2016, could stay in France. ""I have received offers from every continent in the world, including from China. I'm not saying for how much, but it is a huge sum,"" Raiola told Gazzetta dello Sport. He added that PSG are ""doing everything possible to try and make him renew (his contract). Paris remains an option."" Ibrahimovic has yet to play in England's Premier League and Raiola claimed that ""all the big clubs there, with the exception of Manchester City, where (Pep) Guardiola is the coach, have knocked on my door"". The Swede could play against Nice on Saturday, four days before Paris host Manchester City in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final. However, Javier Pastore is a doubt and Marco Verratti is still out with a groin problem, while Angel Di Maria will not play in the Ligue 1 game after picking up a leg knock on international duty with Argentina."
761,01/04/2016,02:20,Nice provide warm-up for PSG Champions League hopefuls,Paris Saint-Germain will warm up for their Champions League date with Manchester City by entertaining high-flying Nice at the Parc des Princes in Ligue 1 on Saturday.,"PSG wrapped up a fourth consecutive French title in record time last month, leaving them to focus all their energy on their other objectives, in particular their quest for European glory. They were beaten 2-0 by Monaco two weeks ago in their first match since securing the title, the result ending an unbeaten home league record going back almost two years, and coach Laurent Blanc will be eager to avoid another setback. English outfit City arrive in the French capital for the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final next Wednesday, so Blanc has a decision to make over whether to rest some of his many players who have been away on international duty. Former Manchester United man Angel Di Maria, for one, could be rested after picking up a knock playing for Argentina, while Marco Verratti remains on the sidelines with a groin injury. However, Ivory Coast right-back Serge Aurier could feature for the first time since being banished to the reserves in February after insulting Blanc in a video on social media. ""He is back with the squad. He must be considered as a member of the squad, nothing more and nothing less,"" Blanc told France Info on Thursday, before insisting that the matter was now closed. ""I wasn't shocked. Nothing shocks me anymore, but I was mad. Honestly, I think the boy didn't think about what he was saying. I have said what I had to say to him."" Nice will provide a stern test, with Claude Puel's side third in the table and targeting an unlikely Champions League place for next season. They have been propelled this season by the spectacular talent of Hatem Ben Arfa, who has promised to offer his own tribute to the late Johan Cruyff by pulling off the legendary Cruyff turn against the champions. ""I think I can't do anything other than try it in our next match,"" Ben Arfa told France Football. ""I have always had a weakness for those who dare, create, invent. That's what Cruyff did. He invented the idea of freedom out on the pitch."" While Nice look to stay ahead of the chasing pack in the battle to finish on the podium, their Cote d'Azur rivals Monaco threaten to run away with second spot and automatic qualification for next season's Champions League group stage. The principality club are five points ahead of Nice before hosting Bordeaux at the Stade Louis II on Friday, with coach Leonardo Jardim batting away criticism of his team's playing style. ""The quality of our game? That always depends on the people watching,"" said Jardim this week, and the Portuguese coach's results speak for themselves, with Monaco unbeaten in eight league games and having suffered one defeat in 18. Against a struggling Bordeaux, Monaco welcome back Bernardo Silva after a ban but Joao Moutinho remains injured and Nabil Dirar suspended. Lyon, who sit a point behind Nice in fourth, have lost just once in eight games and go to Lorient on Sunday bidding to keep the pressure on before France's reigning young player of the year Nabil Fekir makes his expected comeback from a serious knee injury next week. Away from the tight battle for European qualification, hapless bottom side Troyes will be relegated this weekend if they lose at home to Angers, while even a win might not put off the inevitable if results elsewhere go against them."

He added that PSG are ""doing everything possible to try and make him renew (his contract). Paris remains an option."" With Ibrahimovic on the books, PSG have swept the past three league titles, the Swede continuing a tradition that has seen him win championships with Juventus, in 2005 and 2006 (although both were revoked due to a match-fixing scandal), Inter (2007, 2008, 2009), Barcelona (2010) and AC Milan (2011). Ibrahimovic has yet to play in England's Premier League and Raiola claimed that ""all the big clubs there, with the exception of Manchester City, where (Pep) Guardiola is the coach, have knocked on my door"". And despite persistent rumours claiming Ibrahimovic could return to Italy, Raiola appeared to brush them under the carpet. ""All the big clubs want him, even Napoli,"" said Raiola, who took a cheeky swipe at the Serie A club's film-producing president Aurelio De Laurentiis. ""But there, all they're good at is making films."" With Ibrahimovic on his way out of PSG, the French capital club have been linked to Napoli's on-form Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuain. But De Laurentiis reiterated Higuain ""is going nowhere"" on Wednesday and Raiola said the ongoing oil price crisis could see the Qatar-backed French giants tighten their belt this summer. ""In Paris, things have changed. I don't know if they would be prepared to spend 90m euros (for Higuain): the price of oil has plummeted and the Emir is counting his pennies.

The match in California will come three days after another ICC game in Los Angeles, when Liverpool take on Chelsea at the Pasadena Rose Bowl on July 27. It is the third year in a row that the Rose Bowl has hosted pre-season exhibition matches featuring European clubs. Manchester United played the Los Angeles Galaxy at the venue in 2014 before a crowd of more than 90,000 flocked to see Spanish giants Barcelona play the Major League Soccer side at the arena last year. Organisers Relevent Sports also announced a match between Liverpool and Italian side AC Milan at San Francisco's Levi's Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers, on July 30. Last year Manchester United played Barcelona at the same venue before a sell-out crowd of more than 68,000. The 2016 International Champions Cup will run from July 23 to August 13 and will see matches played across the United States and other parts of the world. A total of 10 international teams will take part, including Liverpool, Chelsea, Leicester, AC Milan, Inter Milan, Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Celtic."
765,20/03/2016,23:50,PSG title party gate-crashed by excellent Monaco,Monaco ruined Paris Saint-Germain's Ligue 1 title celebrations as a clinical second-half performance gave the principality side a 2-0 victory at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.,"PSG wrapped up a fourth consecutive league title in record time with eight matches to spare by thrashing Troyes 9-0 a week ago, but they were uncharacteristically flat in the capital. After a drab opening 45 minutes it was the visitors who turned on the style, as Vagner Love's fourth goal for the club gave them a deserved 65th-minute lead. A David Luiz error gave Monaco a penalty that was coolly converted by Fabinho just three minutes later, as PSG slumped to just a second league defeat of the season, and a first at home since May 2014. The victory is a timely one for Leonardo Jardim's Monaco in the race for the top three and the Champions League, as they stay second in the table and now have the cushion of a six-point gap back to fourth-placed Lyon. ""This is a very important victory, but in getting this the team has actually only maintained our gap to our competitors,"" Jardim said. ""Paris is a big team, one of the top four in Europe, and they could win the Champions League. My players played a great game. In football, you have not won or lost before the match, everything is played on the pitch."" PSG manager Laurent Blanc selected an attacking line-up, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani, Lucas Moura and Angel Di Maria all starting on a night when the home fans expected to party. But they started slowly, and the hosts' frustration at their lacklustre opening half an hour was clear, as Cavani thumped the turf in anger after ballooning an acrobatic effort well wide. PSG improved in the minutes before half-time, with Cavani heading a Marquinhos cross wastefully off target when totally unmarked. The visitors grew in confidence in the second period and home keeper Kevin Trapp had to beat clear Fabinho's drive after a mistake by Luiz, before the German also had to save well at his near post from Thomas Lemar. PSG were pleasing the crowd with plenty of neat tricks and flicks, but rarely looked like breaking their opponents down. While Blanc's men appeared to be resting on their record-breaking efforts from last week, there was a hunger and desire about Champions League-chasing Monaco that brought the opening goal. Some quick passing released Lemar, who crossed low to the back post to give Love a simple tap-in with Trapp out of the picture. Less than two minutes later and the principality side were gifted the chance to double their lead from the penalty spot. Another horror-show in the PSG defence culminated in Luiz pulling back Fabinho, and the Brazilian full-back picked himself up to calmly chip his spot-kick down the middle. Unsurprisingly PSG pushed forward in numbers and, after Subasic had brilliantly clawed away a Cavani header, Ibrahimovic somehow contrived to head the ball over the top from two yards out with the goal at his mercy. It was not Ibrahimovic's day, the league's top scorer was left red-faced again after volleying over an unguarded net from point-blank range. Monaco held on in the face of heavy pressure to record a first win against PSG in over six years. Blanc said that his side's missed chances were the key, and played down suggestions that his men had eased off after winning the title. ""In the first half we created many chances, we controlled the game against a very defensive team,"" he said. ""I do not feel as though there was a party tonight, we will celebrate the title when we receive the trophy on the final day."" Hatem Ben Arfa's latest breathtaking strike set Nice up for a 3-0 win over struggling Gazelec Ajaccio that keeps them in contention for a surprise top-three finish. Ben Arfa collected possession wide on the right and skipped away from two challenges as he cut into the box before curling a shot beyond goalkeeper Clement Maury to set Nice on their way in the 14th minute at the Allianz Riviera. He then turned provider for Alassane Plea to make it 2-0 and Ivorian midfielder Jean-Michael Seri wrapped up the victory late on. Bordeaux were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Bastia in their first match since Willy Sagnol was sacked and replaced in the dugout by club legend Ulrich Rame."
766,19/03/2016,16:03,PSG's Van der Wiel fined after Ibrahimovic clash,"Dutch international defender Gregory van der Wiel has been fined by French champions Paris Saint-Germain following a verbal bust-up with Zlatan Ibrahimovic last weekend, coach Laurent Blanc said on Saturday.","""Gregory van der Wiel has been punished by the club, financially. There is no sporting sanction, so he will be in the squad,"" for Sunday's home game with Monaco, said Blanc. Sports daily L'Equipe reported that Van der Wiel was the subject of harsh criticism from Ibrahimovic at half-time in last weekend's 9-0 victory at Troyes that clinched the Ligue 1 title for the capital side. L'Equipe reported that the Swedish striker, unhappy at not having scored in the first half, told former Ajax right-back Van der Wiel: ""Listen, play the way I tell you and it will go well."" Van der Wiel then demanded to be replaced and did not reappear for the second half, when Ibrahimovic scored four times. The Dutchman immediately left the ground and was not there to join in their title celebrations. Meanwhile, Blanc admitted Javier Pastore is a doubt for the game with Monaco because of a nagging calf problem. The Paris coach also insisted no date has been fixed for the return of Italian playmaker Marco Verratti, who is struggling with a hernia. ""We are doing everything to treat Verratti. I know that everyone at PSG and in the Italy set-up is impatient and that everyone wants to hurry him back, but I will not give a date for his return,"" said Blanc. ""It is not very serious, just a bit of inflammation that needs to be treated."" Reports have indicated Verratti may not return until mid-April, meaning he could miss PSG's Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City at the beginning of next month."
767,18/03/2016,02:20,PSG ready to toast title triumph as Monaco visit,Paris Saint-Germain will get the chance to celebrate winning the French title in record time when they play host to second-placed Monaco at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.,"PSG became the earliest champions in French football history when they wrapped up a fourth consecutive title with eight games to spare last weekend, inflicting a pitiless 9-0 defeat on bottom side Troyes in Champagne country. That left Laurent Blanc's side a scarcely credible 25 points clear of their nearest 'challengers' Monaco at the summit and removed much of the edge from their meeting with the principality club in the capital. However, PSG will be eager to prove the gulf in class that separates them from the rest of the country as they defend an unbeaten home record in the league going back to May 2014 and close in on beating their own record for the most points in a Ligue 1 campaign. The game is a vital one for Monaco, however, with Leonardo Jardim's side just five points ahead of Cote d'Azur rivals Nice in the fight for second and automatic Champions League qualification. Monaco have lost just one of their last 17 league games but have drawn their last three, allowing PSG to clinch the title and the teams below them to retain hope in the process. Nevertheless, Monaco will hope PSG -- who are expected to be without Marco Verratti until mid-April because of a hernia -- take their eye off the ball now that the championship is secure. ""It can make a lot of difference - for PSG. The players might relax a bit or could play even better. I think we'll see a slight change,"" Nigerian defender Elderson Echiejile told Monaco's website. Nice are at home to relegation-threatened Gazelec Ajaccio on Sunday and by then they may have lost third place to Lyon, who entertain Nantes on Saturday. A run of one defeat in seven games has revitalised Lyon, although they were held to a 2-2 draw at Rennes last time out. Rennes, in fifth, are also right in contention for Champions League qualification and travel to Marseille on Friday hoping to extend their hosts' miserable record of not having won in 12 league games at the Stade Velodrome. OM, who have drawn their last five games and continue to languish in mid-table, could be about to see Abou Diaby finally make his debut, eight months after returning to French football. ""Right now all the lights are on green and I am ready to play. I have never been so close to a return. I feel good,"" said the injury-jinxed former Arsenal midfielder, who has not played since late 2014, this week. Diaby, who said he hopes to stay beyond the summer when his contract expires, added: ""My wish is to be in the squad and that we can get a victory. I want to experience the fervour of the Marseille support."" Meanwhile, troubled Bordeaux play their first game under new interim coach Ulrich Rame when they entertain Bastia on Sunday. Willy Sagnol was sacked by Les Girondins on Monday in the wake of a 4-0 defeat at Toulouse which left them five points clear of the relegation zone. ""I have spent nearly 20 years here. The club has given me a lot so I would like to give some of that back,"" said Rame, who won two league titles during a long and successful spell as a goalkeeper for Bordeaux."
768,17/03/2016,16:11,Europe's big guns ready for quarter-final draw,The draw for the Champions League quarter-finals in Switzerland on Friday promises to throw up plenty of tantalising ties in the first stage of the competition where any two teams can face each other.,"Restrictions on clubs from the same country facing off are lifted for the last eight, bringing the chance of either an all-German or all-Spanish clash. Defending champions Barcelona are firm favourites for the title after a comfortable 5-1 aggregate victory over Arsenal in the last 16, although no side has ever retained the European crown since it moved to its current guise of the Champions League. That suggests a title defence is harder than it may seem, and the likes of Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain are all expected to challenge Luis Enrique's men for the trophy to be played for in Milan on May 28. The most thrilling climax to a last 16 second leg was saved until last, as five-time champions Bayern produced a thrilling fight-back on Wednesday to knock out last season's runners-up Juventus in extra-time. Bayern legend and CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge on Thursday proclaimed his disappointment that two sides of the stature of the German and Italian champions could meet so early in the tournament. ""What I do not like at all is that it is all dependent on the draw,"" he said. ""UEFA should consider whether or not it should bring in seeding or something like that. It's no longer acceptable, I'm tired of fate."" With murmurs of the traditionally bigger clubs breaking away to form a European Super League, Rummenigge's ideas may be supported by some of the sides in the last eight hat. But the likes of Wolfsburg and Benfica, who could still potentially go head-to-head in the quarters, are unlikely to want any such seeding process. Wolfsburg reached this stage in Europe's premier competition for the first time by seeing off Belgian surprise packages Gent, who battled hard but to no avail in a 4-2 aggregate loss. Benfica, although they are two-time winners, have not won any continental trophy since their second European Cup back in 1962. Despite Rummenigge's views, Bayern head coach Pep Guardiola has said that he does ""not care"" who the Bavarians are drawn against in the next round. The Spaniard, who led Barcelona to two Champions League titles during his time in charge at the Camp Nou, will join Manchester City at the end of the season and could even be pitted against his future employers -- who eased past Dynamo Kiev to progress further than ever before. ""I don't care who we play next. If you want to reach the semi-finals then you have to be ready to beat any opponent,"" said Guardiola, for whom Thomas Mueller's 90th-minute equaliser protected a record of having never failed to reach the last eight as a coach. While many eyes will be on the possibility of an El Clasico showdown, Atletico Madrid's dramatic penalty shoot-out victory over PSV Eindhoven means that Spain have the most quarter-final representatives for the fifth successive season. The last country to provide more than two sides at this stage was England in 2011, but Premier League outfits have struggled in recent years. English champions Chelsea fell to their French counterparts PSG for the second season in a row, this time losing both matches 2-1. The draw takes place at UEFA headquarters in Nyon at 1100GMT."
769,14/03/2016,12:40,Ibrahimovic seals PSG title and hints at departure,Zlatan Ibrahimovic hit four goals to help seal a fourth straight French title for Paris Saint-Germain and then cast doubt on his future at the club.,"""For the moment I am not at PSG next year,"" the 34-year-old Swedish striker said in comments that will set off alarm bells from the English Premier League to China's big-paying clubs. Ibrahimovic was top scorer in a 9-0 trouncing of Troyes on Sunday that sealed the French title in record time with eight games still to go. But celebrations were tainted by Ibrahimovic's statement after. ""I still have a month and a half of competition left. What happens next year, for the moment, I don't know about it,"" he told BeIN Sports. Ibrahimovic, who arrived in Paris in July 2012 from AC Milan and has been linked with a move to Manchester United, added: ""If they replace the Eiffel Tower with a statue of me, I will stay at PSG. ""I can promise that!"" PSG's Qatari president Nasser Al-Khelaifi insisted that he wants Ibrahimovic to stay at the club. ""Zlatan is magical,"" said Al-Khelaifi. ""He is a great player. We are going to talk to him and see what he wants to do. We want him to stay."" On top of contract talks, Paris Saint-Germain are also still in the Champions League and progress in the tournament could also influence Ibrahimovic. Paris are still in contention for a four-trophy haul with the Champions League, French Cup and French League Cup still to be decided. ""The Champions League is our biggest dream,"" said the PSG president. Unlike last season when Paris waited until late March to take over top spot, the capital club have set the pace uninterrupted since beating Gazelec Ajaccio 2-0 in their second game of the campaign. ""We've worked well. Everyone is to be congratulated, first of all the players, the coaching staff, the medical team, etc,"" said coach Laurent Blanc. ""But the season isn't finished and we're going to have to get ourselves back in competition mode because there are some important dates coming up in April and hopefully May."" Three goals in six early first-half minutes by Uruguayan Edinson Cavani, Javier Pastore and Adrien Rabiot set PSG on the road to victory at Troyes who seem certain to be relegated. Ibrahimovic took centre stage in 10 magical second half minutes. The towering Swede made it 4-0 just seconds into the second-half after Cavani intercepted a clearance. Ibrahamivoc drilled the ball low into the left-hand corner. Ibrahimovic's second goal, a mid-air volley from an inch-perfect Angel di Maria cross, was his 100th in Ligue 1 action. For his third the Swede met a Layvin Kurzawa cross at full speed and unleashed a blinding right-footed shot that swerved into the far corner of the net. Matthieu Saunier compounded Troyes' woes with an own goal, while Lossemy Karaboue saw red for hauling Cavani down in the box with 16 minutes to play. Goalkeeper Matthieu Dreyer did well to save Cavani's penalty, but the striker tapped in at the second bite. Ibrahimovic wrapped up the rout, riding through a tackle to unleash an unstoppable shot from a Pastore through-ball, to bring his total to 102 goals scored in 115 Ligue 1 matches. ""I'm very lucky to play with good players,"" Ibrahimovic said, walking off with the ball wedged under his arm. ""The referee gave it to me!"" The Ligue 1 title was the fourth time Blanc has won it as a manager having also guided Bordeaux to the 2008-09 title. The gulf in class between Paris and the rest has never been more apparent since Qatar Sports Investments purchased PSG in 2011. With a budget of close to 500 million euros ($558 million), PSG's financial supremacy has enabled them to spring well clear of the rest of the competition. PSG have set records tumbling this term and surpassed Nantes' 32-game unbeaten run set during the 1994-95 campaign. They were finally beaten 2-1 at Lyon last month to end their sequence at 36 matches. They play in the League Cup final on April 23, four days after facing Lorient for a place in the French Cup final. The draw for the Champions League is this week. PSG, having beaten Chelsea for the second season running will be hoping to avoid a second straight meeting with Barcelona in the final eight."
770,13/03/2016,20:38,"Replace Eiffel Tower with my statue, says Ibrahimovic",Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic admitted Sunday he may be tempted to stay with the French champions -- if a statue of himself is erected in place of the city's iconic Eiffel Tower.,"The 34-year-old's cheeky response to the ongoing speculation over his future came as he hit four goals in a 9-0 demolition of Troyes which sealed a fourth successive Ligue 1 title for Qatari-backed PSG with eight games to spare. ""For the moment, I won't be at PSG next season,"" said Ibrahimovic whose current deal ends in July. ""I still have a month and a half of competition left. What happens next year, for the moment, I don't know about it,"" he told BeIN Sports. Ibrahimovic, who arrived in Paris in July 2012 from AC Milan and has been linked with a move to Manchester United, then added: ""If they replace the Eiffel Tower with a statue of me, I will stay at PSG. ""I can promise that!"" Earlier, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi insisted that he wants Ibrahimovic to stay at the club. ""Zlatan is magical,"" said Al-Khelaifi. ""He is a great player. We are going to talk him and see what he wants to do. We want him to stay."" Ibrahimovic's four goals on Sunday took his league total to 27 in 24 games this season. Qatari Al-Khelaifi added that PSG will now target a maiden Champions League triumph having already seen off Chelsea in the last 16. ""We must now stay focused because the season is not finished,"" he said. ""We have three more cups to fight for (Champions League, French League Cup, French Cup) but the Champions League is our biggest dream. ""We want to go as far as possible but we know there will be some very strong teams."""

""Zlatan is magical,"" said Al-Khelaifi. ""He is a great player. We are going to talk him and see what he wants to do. We want him to stay.""

772,13/03/2016,16:03,Abysmal domination at home leaves PSG looking abroad for kicks,"Along with the satisfaction of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals last midweek, Paris Saint-Germain may also have felt considerable relief at prolonging their European adventure.","After all, a failure to make it four consecutive appearances in the last eight of Europe's elite club competition would have made for a rather anti-climactic end to the season. PSG celebrated winning a fourth successive French title on Sunday, their sixth overall, with a 9-0 victory at bottom side Troyes. Laurent Blanc's team are the earliest champions in the history of the French game, with eight matches and two months of the season remaining. ""We have been top right from the start. I don't know if we'll ever manage to repeat such a performance,"" said Blanc this weekend. Paris will now hope to go and complete a clean sweep of the domestic trophies for the second year running, with a French Cup semi-final at Lorient and the League Cup final against Lille to come in April. That is certainly not to be sniffed at, but they measure themselves now against the continent's best in the Champions League, and there will be no euphoria at winning a league in which their domination has become abysmal. Before a 2-1 defeat at Lyon two weeks ago, they had gone a record 36 Ligue 1 games unbeaten since March 2015, and despite that solitary loss, PSG are on course to break their own record for the highest points total in France's top flight. These are heady times to be a supporter of the French capital's only top-flight side, and yet even they seem to regret the fact their team's superiority is so emphatic. A quick glance at the French league's official attendance records suggests that PSG are the country's best supported team, with average crowds of over 46,000 selling out the Parc des Princes. The reality, though, is somewhat different. Many season ticket holders only turn up for the biggest games, leaving thousands of empty seats and little of the once raucous atmosphere the rest of the time. That contrasts with the way things used to be, even in the last decade when PSG plunged the depths of mediocrity. Players and officials alike have expressed frustration at a support who often only make themselves heard to whistle their team on the rare occasions when they are not winning, or not winning well enough. ""Sometimes the crowd at the Parc can be too calm, and some of the whistles...I don't understand them,"" Paris president Nasser al-Khelaifi told Le Figaro in December. Blanc's side deserve better, but there is not much they can do when opposition teams occasionally rest key players in Paris, accepting defeat before the game has begun. PSG are not playing in the same league as the rest of France, such a monster have they become since the Qatari takeover of 2011. Talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic, in possibly his last season in France, has again gone past the 30-goal mark, while the arrival of Angel Di Maria and emergence of Lucas Moura have helped take PSG to another level at times. But the rest of the continent looks down on the lack of competition in Ligue 1 and an appearance in the semi-finals of the Champions League for the first time since 1995 is necessary for PSG to be fully respected abroad. However, Paris have been quick to stress that their domestic dominance is not all their fault, with the failings of their potential rivals also to blame. Monaco did not take long to give up on competing with Paris and switch their focus to bringing through young talent to sell on for profit. They have fewer points at this stage than any second-placed team since Lens in 2007, while Lyon and Marseille have had their own problems, allowing PSG to turn Ligue 1 into one of the most one-sided leagues in Europe. ""We have done our job. Our rivals have not done what they needed to do against the other teams in order to keep up,"" Blanc said. It may be some time yet before anyone else comes close to taking their crown away from them."
773,13/03/2016,15:57,Ibra nets four as stylish PSG seal French title in record time,"French giants Paris Saint-Germain, inspired by four stunning Zlatan Ibrahimovic goals, turned on the style Sunday to beat Troyes 9-0 and clinch a fourth consecutive Ligue 1 crown in record time.","Just four days after advancing to the Champions League quarter-finals, PSG wrapped up the club's sixth French title with eight games to spare by beating a Troyes side destined for an immediate return to the second tier. Laurent Blanc's men obliterated the French record for the quickest league victory, currently held by Lyon who won the 2007 title under Gerard Houllier with five games to go. Unlike last season when Paris waited until late March to take over top spot, the capital club have set the pace uninterrupted since beating Gazelec Ajaccio 2-0 in their second game of the campaign. Three goals in six early first-half minutes settled PSG's nerves at Troyes' sun-kissed Stade de l'Aube. First up was Edinson Cavani, the Uruguyan capitalising on a poor back pass to sneak in to beat goalkeeper Matthieu Dreyer on the second attempt. Pastore made it 2-0 shortly after, a David Luiz interception played quickly to Ibrahimovic, whose sublime backheel found the Argentinian who toe-poked a looped finish past a despairing Dreyer. No sooner had the game been restarted than Adrien Rabiot was the welcome recipient for PSG's third after following up on a Cavani shot that rebounded off Dreyer. It was then time for Ibrahimovic to take centre stage in 10 magical minutes. The towering Swede made it 4-0 just seconds into the second-half after Cavani intercepted another poor clearance, ""Ibra"" gifted too much space on the edge of the box and making no mistake as he drilled the ball low into the left-hand corner. Ibrahimovic's second was a gem, a first-time mid-air volley of an inch-perfect Angel di Maria cross as PSG swamped Troyes. His third -- and 100th in Ligue 1 action -- was equally sublime, the 34-year-old Swede meeting a Layvin Kurzawa cross at full speed and unleashing a blinding right-footed shot that swerved into the far corner of the net. Matthieu Saunier compounded Troyes' woes with an own goal, while Lossemy Karaboue saw red for hauling Cavani down in the box with 16 minutes to play. Dreyer did well to save Cavani's penalty, but the striker tapped in at the second bite. It was left to Ibrahimovic to wrap up the 9-0 rout, the striker showing great strength to ride a tackle and unleash an unstoppable shot after a Pastore through-ball."
774,13/03/2016,03:00,PSG poised to seal French title in record time,French giants Paris Saint-Germain are primed to clinch a fourth consecutive Ligue 1 crown in record time ahead of Sunday's trip to rock bottom Troyes.,"Just four days after advancing to the Champions League quarter-finals, PSG can wrap up the club's sixth French title with eight games to spare by beating a Troyes side destined for an immediate return to the second tier. Laurent Blanc's men are poised to obliterate the French record for the quickest league victory, currently held by Lyon who won the 2007 title under Gerard Houllier after 33 games. Unlike last season when Paris waited until late March to take over top spot, the capital club have set the pace uninterrupted since beating Gazelec Ajaccio 2-0 in their second game of the campaign. ""Paris have taken their own route in the league. Many teams have struggled to keep up with us, but the head-to-head confrontations only count for six points so the others haven't done what they needed to do,"" Blanc told reporters on Saturday. ""I hope we can go and pick up the title with eight games to go. It's a great performance that will be hard to repeat. ""I think it would be a good thing to be crowned champions (Sunday) because we will be achieving our goal eight games before the end of the season. ""That will allow us to approach a very busy April more serenely,"" added Blanc, who is set to win Ligue 1 for the fourth time as a manager having also guided Bordeaux to the 2008-09 title. The gulf in class has never been more apparent since Qatar Sports Investments purchased PSG in the summer of 2011, in what has become a landmark moment in French football. With a budget of close to 500 million euros ($558 million), PSG's financial supremacy has enabled them to spring well clear of the rest of the competition in Ligue 1 and render last year's keenly-contested title race a distant memory. PSG have set records tumbling this term and surpassed Nantes' 32-game unbeaten run set during the 1994-95 campaign, only for a 2-1 defeat at Lyon last month to end their sequence at 36 matches and with it any hopes of earning the invincibles tag. Meanwhile, Zlatan Ibrahimovic showed his talents remain undimmed as he shattered former Portugal striker Pauleta's 109-goal club record in just his fourth season at the Parc des Princes. But PSG's ambitions go beyond simply retaining the league title, with the club also through to the League Cup final on April 23 and set to face Lorient four days earlier for a place in the French Cup showpiece as they seek to defend last year's historic treble. However, conquering Europe represents the top priority for a squad assembled at vast expense, the arrival of Angel Di Maria for 63 million euros last August merely providing further ammunition as PSG attempt to trade blows with the continent's heavyweights. How PSG fare next month will go a long way to determining how successfully their season is portrayed, with Blanc's side due to play the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie on April 5-6 ahead of the return fixture a week later."
775,12/03/2016,15:14,Verratti out of potential title celebration match,Italy midfielder Marco Verratti will miss Paris Saint-Germain's trip to Troyes on Sunday in which the Ligue 1 leaders could sew up the French title with eight games to spare.,"Monaco's 2-2 draw at home to Reims on Friday night means victory on Sunday would give PSG un unassailable 25-point lead and a fourth straight title. But if they are to do so, they will have to manage without Verratti and perhaps also France midfielder Blaise Matuidi. ""Verratti won't be in the squad,"" said coach Laurent Blanc on Saturday. Verratti also missed the trip to Chelsea in the Champions League in mid-week but has a groin problem. ""We've been managing Verratti as we should,"" added Blanc. ""We tried everything possible, with his agreement, to get him fit to play in the Champions League. ""We managed it in the first leg but not the return."" Verratti played in the first leg at home to Chelsea three weeks ago, a 2-1 victory, before missing the return in which another success by the same score took the French champions into the quarter-finals. PSG will look to have him fit for the last eight starting next month. ""His injury is not very serious,"" said Blanc. ""It needs rest."" Matuidi has a thigh problem and although he played at Stamford Bridge, Blanc said: ""It'll will be tough for him to make the squad."""
776,11/03/2016,23:45,PSG poised to lift crown as Monaco held by Reims,Paris Saint-Germain's path to claiming the Ligue 1 title in record time this weekend was cleared on Friday as nearest challengers Monaco were held 2-2 at home by Reims.,"A win at lowly Troyes on Sunday would give Laurent Blanc's side 77 points -- 25 more than Monaco who are currently second with 52 points after 30 games -- and a fourth successive crown to round out an excellent week after reaching the Champions League quarter-finals. Until now the fastest a team has won the French league title was after 33 games when Gerard Houllier led Lyon to the crown in 2007. Monaco are targetting the second direct Champions League spot with Leonardo Jardim's side having no room for error with Lyon, the only team to beat the Parisians this season, third, seven points behind the Principality side. Monaco had gotten off to a bright start with winter signing Vagner Love getting a first half double. The Brazilian opened after just five minutes at Stade Louis II only for Gaetan Charbonnier to get the equaliser six minutes later following a superb cross from Nicolas De Preville. Vagner got his second on 37 minutes following an error by Charbonnier only for fellow Brazilian Diego to pull Reims level after 79 minutes, for a precious point as they sit three points above the drop zone. ""Our situation isn't good,"" said Jardim. ""I'm not happy. At 2-1 we had the chance to score a third and we missed. When you miss the third goal you give a lot of confidence to your rivals."" He added: ""But there are eight games left, 24 points to collect. The third (placed team) will play against the fourth (Rennes-Lyon), both won't win."" Lyon, coming off last weekend's 5-1 win against Guingamp, travel to another Brittany side Rennes on Sunday, with the hosts also in impressive form having beaten Nantes 4-1 last Sunday. Rennes are just a point behind Lyon along with Nice who travel on Saturday to Montpellier."

781,08/03/2016,21:27,PSG's Blanc hopes for Chelsea deja vu,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc believes that his side's success in eliminating Chelsea from last season's Champions League may give them an edge when the teams reconvene on Wednesday.,"PSG weathered the first-half dismissal of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to secure a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge a year ago that took them through on away goals and they return to west London leading 2-1 from the first leg of this season's last 16 tie. While much has changed in the year that has elapsed, most notably with Guus Hiddink succeeding Jose Mourino as Chelsea manager on an interim basis, Blanc is hopeful that last year's breakthrough success will strengthen his players' conviction that they can emerge victorious again. ""I think it might be an even more difficult match than last year, for different reasons,"" said Blanc, whose team were eliminated on away goals by Chelsea in 2014. ""But my players must be conscious that we did it last season. So if we've done it once, we can do it a second time. ""We're qualified as things stand, but we'll need to play our own game and impose ourselves. If we can do what we hope to, I think it'll be a good match for PSG."" While the ambitious French champions are a mammoth 23 points clear in Ligue 1 and on course for another clean sweep of domestic trophies, Chelsea are likely to need to win the Champions League just to qualify for next season's competition. But they are unbeaten in 13 Premier League games since Mourinho was sacked in December and proved in 2012 that a dismal league campaign need not be a bar to Champions League glory. ""Everyone knows where Chelsea's season is heading to, coming from a difficult situation in December when we were very close to the relegation zone,"" said Hiddink, who previously led Chelsea to FA Cup glory after taking over in unfavourable circumstances in 2009. ""The team responded, got the points and is now mid-table, but this was a soft target for Chelsea. We did that in a relatively short time. ""Now we want to go to a new target, which is the FA Cup and the Champions League. It can give another image to Chelsea."" Chelsea captain John Terry ruled himself out on the eve of the match after failing to recover from a hamstring injury. With Kurt Zouma also sidelined by a long-term knee problem, Branislav Ivanovic and Gary Cahill will line up at centre-back for the hosts, with Cesar Azpilicueta and Baba Rahman filling the full-back roles. Terry is due to leave Chelsea at the end of the season, but Cahill said that his team-mates could not allow their focus to be clouded by thoughts of keeping the 35-year-old on course for a golden send-off. ""It would be nice to go through this next round and John hopefully will be fit again sometime soon,"" said the England international. ""But our focus is on tomorrow."" Diego Costa is due to lead the line for Chelsea after being rested for Saturday's 1-1 draw with Stoke City and Blanc has warned his players not to fall for the Brazil-born Spain striker's provocative tactics. ""We know that he likes contact, duels, and even provocation,"" Blanc said. ""We saw that last year. It's his style of play and he plays like that against everyone. I'll tell the defenders not to respond, to stay cold. Even the Brazilians, they have to stay very cold. ""We paid last year (with Ibrahimovic's dismissal). It's hard not to react to provocation, but you have to master your nerves."" PSG's only injury worry concerns Italian midfielder Marco Verratti, who has missed three games with a groin problem. Blanc said that he would be assessed in Tuesday's pre-game training session. Javier Pastore is in line to deputise if Verratti cannot prove his fitness in time."

He returns on Wednesday with PSG leading 2-1 from the first leg of their last 16 tie, but says that he has no interest in settling scores. ""I never think about revenge and these things,"" he said. ""Every game is a new game, but hopefully I'll stay on the pitch longer this time. ""From the last game here, I never saw something like that before from mature players. I didn't expect that. But it's a new game, let's play different."" Despite a glittering career, Ibrahimovic, 34, has never won the Champions League, but while he dismissed suggestions that his career is winding down, he said that lifting the trophy was no longer an obsession. ""I'm only warming up. I don't believe it's the end of my career,"" said Ibrahimovic, who is Ligue 1's leading scorer with 23 goals. ""I think age is just a number and the difference is how you feel. I feel very young. The season I've done so far, I never had better statistics than this. ""When I was young and talking about the Champions League, yes, it was almost an obsession, but then I started to mature, started to get to know myself. ""And I said to myself, 'If I win it or not, it won't change the player I am.' But if I can win it, of course I'll be happy."" Ibrahimovic believes that it is only a matter of time until PSG win Europe's biggest prize, although he risked the wrath of long-term fans by declaring that the club's history had begun with Qatar Sports Investments' 2011 takeover. ""The club I'm playing in now is a project that began three and a half years ago,"" he said. ""With all the respect, what happened before that, I think the club was born the day that the Qataris took over. It's a totally new club. ""With time, with what the Qataris are investing, there are no limits. Trust me, they will hunt this Champions League until they get it. And they will not stop. With me or without me."" Ibrahimovic's contract expires at the end of the season, but he said that he had not started to think about his future. ""My future is I have another two months with PSG, then I have the Euro to play with my national team,"" he said. ""Whatever happens after that, like it is today, there is nothing after that. I'm not in discussion with nobody because for me it's not the moment to talk about that. ""I'm not worried about the future. The future looks good after the season I'm doing."""

787,07/03/2016,02:03,Stakes high as Chelsea and PSG clash again,"Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain meet at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday with both sides' seasons riding on the outcome of their Champions League last 16, second leg showdown.","PSG head to London with a 2-1 lead from the first leg in Paris last month thanks to a late Edinson Cavani winner, but the tie is finely poised, with John Obi Mikel's away goal giving Chelsea plenty of reason to believe they can progress. Away goals have decided the meetings of the sides in each of the last two seasons, with a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge taking PSG through at the same stage last season after Chelsea had come out on top in the 2014 quarter-finals. The stakes are extremely high for this latest clash of the clubs, with Chelsea looking to Europe for joy while they continue to struggle in the Premier League. They have lost just once in 16 games since the sacking of Jose Mourinho in December, but that loss came at the Parc des Princes three weeks ago and Chelsea are coming off a 1-1 draw at home to Stoke City that surely ended their hopes of a top-four finish in the Premier League. Meanwhile, PSG had their minds elsewhere during a 0-0 home draw with Montpellier at the weekend. They are 23 points clear of Monaco at the top of Ligue 1 and could secure another French title as early as next weekend, so they risk having a rather anti-climactic finish to the season if they are eliminated from Europe. That means there is huge pressure on Laurent Blanc's team, as Brazilian defender Maxwell admitted. ""Chelsea is on the minds of everyone. It is a very important match. Everyone is waiting for it -- the media, the club, the players too,"" he told French media after Saturday's match. PSG have doubts over the fitness of influential midfield duo Blaise Matuidi and Marco Verratti but hope at least one of the two will make the game. ""At this time of the season it is difficult to have everyone fully fit. We all have little knocks here and there. We hope to have a full squad,"" added Maxwell. Meanwhile, Chelsea could be without skipper John Terry but Hiddink insisted that Diego Costa should be fine despite sitting out the Stoke draw. Real Madrid's campaign is also now riding on success in Europe after they slipped 12 points behind leaders Barcelona in La Liga, although Zinedine Zidane's team are well placed to progress to the quarter-finals as they host Roma at the Santiago Bernabeu. The Spanish giants won 2-0 in the first leg in Italy and so appear poised to end a run of eight consecutive defeats to Serie A opposition in two-legged European ties. They also come into the game fresh from demolishing Celta Vigo 7-1 in La Liga at the weekend and hope to welcome Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Gareth Bale back into their starting line-up. ""He was happy to play again after such a long time. I think he will be ready to start. We will see over the next couple of days,"" said Zidane of Bale, who came off the bench to score against Celta after six weeks out. Roma travel without Daniele De Rossi and German defender Antonio Ruediger, who are injured, but Madrid must be wary of a team who have won seven straight Serie A games. In Germany, Wolfsburg will hope to make sure of a place in the quarter-finals for the first time when they entertain Gent on Tuesday defending a 3-2 first-leg lead. ""We can make history and reach the quarter-finals for the first time,"" Wolfsburg's Julian Draxler told Bundesliga.com. ""We'll approach the game as we would any other: we want to win it."" The other game this midweek sees Zenit St Petersburg entertain Benfica in Russia on Wednesday, with the Portuguese side holding a 1-0 lead from the first leg. Benfica are fresh from beating Lisbon rivals Sporting 1-0 away at the weekend and beat the Russians at this stage in 2012, but Zenit's Portuguese coach Andre Villas-Boas hopes his team can turn the tie around. ""We are confident that we can score the necessary goals. The quarter-finals of the Champions League is our dream. It will be a major event for Russian football,"" Villas-Boas said."
788,06/03/2016,01:30,Hiddink confident over Costa fitness for PSG clash,Guus Hiddink dismissed concerns over Diego Costa's fitness by insisting the Spain striker will be available for Chelsea's crucial Champions League clash with Paris Saint Germain on Wednesday.,"Costa missed Saturday's 1-1 Premier League draw against Stoke as he rested to avoid aggravating a tendon injury, but Blues interim manager Hiddink is confident his star forward will return for the last 16, second leg against PSG. With the French champions holding a 2-1 lead, Hiddink can't afford to be without the in-form Costa, especially as Chelsea laboured without him in a match that prompted the Dutchman to dismiss their top four hopes as ""impossible"" and set his sights on success in Europe and the FA Cup. ""Diego had a problem on the tendon, that's why I was cautious not to worsen the situation, but I think he will be OK on Wednesday,"" Hiddink said. ""I think the top four is difficult, almost impossible especially when other teams are knocking on that door. ""I am very respectful of the likes of West Ham who got a good result today (at Everton). On the other hand we know where we came from in December, one point off the relegation zone, and amazingly we got safe in a relatively short time. ""We got into mid-table which normally for Chelsea standards is not enough. But if we can go into a very beautiful March and April that would be nice in the Champions League and FA Cup."" Bertrand Traore, the exciting 20-year-old from Burkina Faso, started in attack in the absence of Costa, and justified his manager's faith with his second Premier League goal, a spectacular left-footed shot from 20 yards six minutes before the break. But Stoke pushed Chelsea all the way and were rewarded five minutes from the end when Mame Diouf headed into an empty net after Thibaut Courtois failed to claim Xherdan Shaqiri's cross. ""Traore showed in parts of the game he has the quality,"" said Hiddink. ""It is a bit different to start at Stamford Bridge. ""Young players need control and to dominate their nerves. But he showed with the goal he has a capacity to do a lot. ""We have some young players in the team and they compete in a healthy way. If they show what they can do in training they will be rewarded. ""The match was frustrating, it is always frustrating to concede a late goal. But you can say we started rather sloppy in the first half and after 15-20 minutes we had more composure. ""We scored a beautiful goal through Traore. But they have got some very creative players and in the end it was a fair result."" Stoke manager Mark Hughes revealed he was going to take off Diouf before his goal. ""I felt we deserved a point,"" he said. ""Arguably we felt a little bit hard done by. ""We had opportunities, certainly first half, which we didn't convert, unfortunately. ""And lo and behold we get done with a sucker punch just before half-time. ""You can be a bit deflated, but in fairness it was the complete opposite reaction. ""I basically told them to keep doing what you are doing and second half was more of the same. ""As the half progressed, I felt Chelsea looked to play on the counter attack and we had more control of the game possession wise. ""And there was a feeling in the stadium that we were the more likely team to get the next goal. ""I was a little bit fortunate because I was going to take Mame Diouf off just before he scored. That's the fortune you need. ""All-in-all, we have once again come here and shown real belief. That's the first point, I think, Stoke have got from Stamford Bridge since 1984."""
789,05/03/2016,22:10,PSG keep powder dry before Chelsea showdown,"With numerous stars rested, Paris Saint-Germain settled for an uninspiring goalless draw at home to Montpellier on Saturday ahead of their crucial Champions League return clash with Chelsea.","PSG's enormous lead at the top of Ligue 1 and determination to progress in Europe meant this game was never the priority for coach Laurent Blanc, although things could have been very different had Edinson Cavani found the net rather than the bar early on. The draw allowed the defending champions to restore their 23-point lead at the top over second-placed Monaco, who drew 2-2 at Caen on Friday, and means they could still secure a fourth straight title when they host the principality club at the Parc des Princes on March 20. By then they will hope to have confirmed their place in the last eight of the Champions League for the fourth year running, but all depends on the second leg of their last-16 tie with Chelsea in London on Wednesday, into which they take a 2-1 lead. ""There is no reason to be satisfied, that game could have been won. We weren't efficient going forward, it's a shame there was no goal,"" said Blanc. ""The most important thing, though, and what makes me the happiest is that we didn't lose anyone to injury. We decided to let some players play and others rest. Overall, it was satisfactory."" Blanc rested a host of key players to keep them fresh and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was on the bench alongside David Luiz and Thiago Motta while captain Thiago Silva was not involved at all. While Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi were not fit, there was a return for Angel Di Maria but the home starting line-up also featured 20-year-old defender Presnel Kimpembe and midfielder Christopher Nkunku, who was making his first start in Ligue 1 at the age of just 18. Nkunku showed some nice touches in a first half that lacked intensity at a Parc des Princes once again far from full. The hosts almost opened the scoring from one of their first attacks as a Maxwell cross was turned onto the bar by Cavani, but other than that PSG only really threatened when Di Maria turned on the style. The Argentine produced some flashes of quality and also nearly found the net from a curling left-foot free-kick that forced Laurent Pionnier in the Montpellier goal into an excellent save high to his left. Di Maria then sent a low ball across the face of goal but Lucas, sliding in, was unable to make contact in one of the last acts of the first half. The state of Di Maria's fitness has been one of the biggest concerns for Blanc ahead of the game at Stamford Bridge and he was replaced after an hour to make way for Ibrahimovic. Despite the Swede's introduction, PSG could not break down their opponents, but they will recall that a 0-0 draw at home to Lille immediately before the first leg against Chelsea did them little harm. Montpellier, meanwhile, will be pleased as they continued their revival since the January appointment as coach of Frederic Hantz. Monaco could only draw in Caen despite twice taking the lead, as Ivorian forward Christian Kouakou scored a minute from time to secure a point for the home side. Nice reclaimed third spot after downing bottom side Troyes 2-1, but Lyon, who inflicted a first domestic defeat of the season on PSG last weekend, can return to the Champions League places when they entertain Guingamp on Sunday. Saint-Etienne missed the chance to leapfrog their bitter Rhone Valley rivals as they were held to a 0-0 draw at Angers, while Lille beat Reims 2-0 and Gazelec Ajaccio grabbed a late equaliser to draw 1-1 at Bordeaux."
790,04/03/2016,17:54,Hiddink unsure if Terry will make PSG showdown,Chelsea's interim manager Guus Hiddink revealed on Friday that captain John Terry faces a race against time to prove his fitness for next week's decisive Champions League showdown with Paris Saint-Germain.,"Terry has been sidelined since injuring his hamstring against Newcastle United three weeks ago, but he hinted on Thursday that he was close to a return to action. Hiddink, however, said the 35-year-old defender is yet to train with the first-team group and will not be risked when Stoke City visit Stamford Bridge in the Premier League on Saturday. That gives Terry just a few days to show he is ready to play against French champions PSG, who hold a 2-1 lead from the first leg of the last-16 tie. ""He is not fit enough to start,"" Hiddink said. ""He is with the physio and also training. We will see how it goes for Wednesday. He hasn't trained with the group yet. ""Could he be on the bench against Stoke? I don't think so. With this kind of injury we have to have intense training before. It's too much of a risk. ""He has to prove his fitness before PSG. It depends on how he is in training, if it is possible, late on Monday. I will not take any risks with him."" Chelsea's win at Norwich City in midweek means they are now unbeaten in 12 league games since Hiddink's arrival and hopes of rescuing a place in the top four have been revived. ""The players responded well when I came in,"" Hiddink said. ""I said to everyone, 'what was your contribution in the year of the championship and the last half year? Don't give me an answer by word but in training and in upcoming games'. I think they responded."" Hiddink, however, insists he is not in the running to take the Chelsea manager's job long-term. ""I will be now and then at Stamford Bridge and at Cobham as a tourist,"" Hiddink added. ""I am here for a short period, that's how we started. I think the club has to go into a new -- transition is too big a word -- but a new era. ""They have to go into a new era of Chelsea which is not just about short spells."""
791,04/03/2016,16:36,Matuidi injury 'not looking good' for PSG,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc has admitted that a hamstring injury suffered by midfielder Blaise Matuidi ""does not look good"" with a crunch Champions League clash with Chelsea less than a week away.","Matuidi came off in the second half of Wednesday's 3-1 French Cup quarter-final win away to Saint-Etienne feeling his hamstring. Blanc said at the time the substitution was a precautionary measure but with the Champions League last 16, second leg against Chelsea to come next Wednesday it was always going to be a race against time for the player to recover. ""I am worried when a player comes off with a sore hamstring. He has undergone tests (on Thursday) and he is having more,"" said Blanc. ""We will keep a close eye on it. It is never a good sign, I won't lie. But we will see how serious it is and if we can get him back, not for tomorrow (Saturday) but for Chelsea."" Ligue 1 leaders PSG entertain Montpellier on Saturday with Marco Verratti set to again miss out but Angel Di Maria likely to return after missing the Saint-Etienne win and last week's defeat at Lyon, which was their first domestic defeat since March last year. Paris will go to London defending a 2-1 lead from the first leg against Chelsea."
792,04/03/2016,02:20,PSG focus on Chelsea ahead of Montpellier visit,Paris Saint-Germain head into Saturday's clash at home to a resurgent Montpellier with most eyes firmly fixated on next week's return leg at Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League.,"PSG rebounded from losing their 46-game unbeaten domestic run at Lyon last weekend by remaining on course to defend their French Cup crown after beating Saint-Etienne 3-1 in midweek. However, victory at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard potentially came at a cost with midfielder Blaise Matuidi facing a race against time to be fit for Wednesday's trip to Stamford Bridge. The France international was seen clutching his hamstring after he was taken off ""as a precaution"" midway through the second half, with Laurent Blanc admitting he was ""worried"" about Matuidi's fitness. Blanc will have to decide whether or not to rest key players ahead of the Chelsea clash, with Marco Verratti (groin) and Angel Di Maria (thigh) also struggling with injuries. The PSG boss though was pleased with the manner in which the runaway Ligue 1 leaders responded at Saint-Etienne after suffering their first defeat of the season. ""We can't erase (the loss), but we can use it to our advantage. That's what we did (on Wednesday) and I'm very happy about it. It was a good way to respond after the defeat which provoked quite a buzz,"" said Blanc, in quotes published by French daily L'Equipe. ""Montpellier will be a difficult match because we'll be thinking about the game against Chelsea which will be huge,"" said PSG captain Thiago Silva, with 2012 French champions Montpellier arriving in the capital on the back of three straight wins to pull clear of relegation trouble. ""We're ready for Chelsea. I think everyone knows what awaits us over there. I hope (Matuidi) will be able to play because he's an important player for the team,"" the Brazilian added. Defeat at Lyon means Paris can't clinch a fourth straight French title this weekend, but they could do so next week should Monaco slip up at fellow European hopefuls Caen on Friday. Monaco have lost just once in 15 league outings and have an eight-point cushion over Caen, who trail third-place Lyon on goal difference, in the race for the second automatic Champions League qualifying berth. Four wins in five has reignited Lyon's campaign and Bruno Genesio's side will bid to build on recent momentum when Guingamp visit Parc OL in Sunday's late game. A four-match winless run has slowed Nice's European charge, but they will fancy their chances of ending that series at home to bottom side Troyes on Saturday. Rennes and Nantes, unbeaten in the league since November, meet in the Brittany derby with both sides also firmly in the hunt for Europe, while Saint-Etienne travel to slumping Angers. Pascal Dupraz will embark on the daunting task of trying to salvage Toulouse's top-flight status having replaced Dominique Arribage ahead of Sunday's trip to Marseille. Toulouse are 10 points from safety and without a win in eight, but there is hope as Marseille have struggled mightily at the Stade Velodrome with just two wins all season and none in their last 11 home fixtures.

793,04/03/2016,01:32,Matic eyes Chelsea push for top four finish,Nemanja Matic claims Chelsea can still secure a top four finish if they can secure a fourth successive Premier League win when Stoke visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday.,"The Blues' win at Norwich this week moved last season's champions into the top half of the table for the first time since August and within eight points of fourth placed Manchester City. While their progress may look modest when measured in league places, Guus Hiddink's team are undeniably on the rise and remain unbeaten in domestic competition since December. The manner of recent performances has drawn comparisons to some of last season's better displays and with the second leg of the Champions League last 16 tie with Paris Saint Germain to come next week, they have hit form at exactly the right time. Chelsea interim manager Hiddink is remaining guarded about his side's Premier League ambitions. Blues midfielder Matic, though, believes that with the side now lying 10th, they can close the gap to the Champions League places if they can win all of their remaining 10 league games. ""It is very important to win games. We are a big team and have to keep doing this if we are to get closer to the first four,"" Matic said. ""I know it's very difficult to catch them but we will give our best to win every game from now on. ""I know that is very hard, maybe impossible, but in football anything can happen."" Chelsea will undoubtedly have one eye on the meeting with PSG when they will attempt to overturn a one-goal first leg deficit. But centre-back Gary Cahill insists the impressive form of striker Diego Costa since Hiddink took charge means the club is more than capable of competing on all fronts. ""It is perfect timing to have Costa back to his very best with the big games we have coming up. He's scoring goals and long may that continue,"" Cahill said. ""I'm sure for a striker if you start scoring goals, you think you will score every time you get on the pitch. He is in that mind-set now. ""People aren't talking about him not scoring for three-four games or whatever any more like earlier in the season. His record is great at the minute, so he feels confident. ""Ultimately for us if we have Diego in form and scoring goals, it's great for the team."" Stoke arrive at Stamford Bridge in confident mood, having moved above Chelsea and up to seventh by beating Newcastle 1-0 on Wednesday. That was a third successive victory for Mark Hughes' side, who are only five points outside the Champions League positions. Hughes spent three years at Chelsea as a player, and actually featured the last time they lost at home to Stoke, in a 1995 League Cup tie. The Potters have not won a league match at Stamford Bridge since 1974, and their manager is keen to put that right. ""I had a great time as a player there when they were a mid-table team. You could see things were starting to roll in the right direction as I left,"" Hughes said. ""Going back there, we haven't had the best of times. We're looking to change that. It will be a good match up. ""We've gone there in recent seasons and really haven't tested them enough."" Stoke are stretched defensively as Phil Bardsley faces several weeks out with a calf injury, Geoff Cameron has an ankle problem and Ryan Shawcross is in Germany seeing a specialist about his back injury."
794,02/03/2016,23:33,Ibrahimovic drives PSG into French Cup semis,Zlatan Ibrahimovic pulled the strings as Paris Saint Germain cruised into the French Cup semi-finals on Wednesday with a 3-1 away win at Saint Etienne.,"The result saw PSG bounce back from their first domestic defeat in a year, a 2-1 league loss at Lyon at the weekend, with goals from Edinson Cavani, Marquinhos and late substitute Lucas. Ahead of their crucial Champions League return match at Chelsea next week however key midfielder Blaise Matuidi limped off with a thigh injury in the second half. Paris coach Laurent Blanc had told his players their weekend performance was not good enough and had demanded application, which he seemed happy with afterwards. ""It's difficult to win here. But really it's rare you see a team win so easily at Saint Etienne,"" he told French television. ""PSG warranted their win. It's an experienced side, and even if they went missing at Lyon they showed up and did a job tonight."" Ibrahimovic carved open the home defence for the opener on 12 minutes with a perfectly weighted pass which his Uruguayan strike partner Cavani ran onto and smacked home with great relish. The giant Swede was at the heart of the second goal on 35 minutes too when Marquinhos tapped in at the far post after a fine team move, as a vicious cross from Ibrahimovic was flicked on toward the back post by Cavani. A spirited Saint Etienne, pumped up by 36,000 boisterous fans, hit back when a Valentin Eyserric penalty reduced the arrears to 2-1 just before the break. PSG were easing out the game when late substitute Lucas dribbled past several defenders and fired home the clincher two minutes into added time. Defending champions PSG have won the Coupe de France on nine occasions, second only to arch-rivals and ten-time winner Marseille, who play fifth tier Granville on Thursday. In an all top-flight quarter final earlier Wednesday, Lorient, on the back of two league wins, cruised past Gazalec Ajaccio 3-0. After first half goals from Romain Philippoteaux and Maxime Barthelme, Pape Paye finished the job with a late strike. The shock of the evening came when second division Sochaux made the semi-finals when they put an end to top flight Nantes' 16-game unbeaten run. Nantes had been leading for most of the game before Moussa Sow got an equaliser in the 87th minute to send the game into extra-time. Substitute Sekou Cissé made it 2-1 against the run of play before Sow sealed the win for the former Peugeot factory side and despite a late consolation from the Brazilian Adryan Socahux are into the final four.

795,01/03/2016,02:20,PSG looking to bounce back from Lyon loss in Cup,"Paris Saint-Germain will be desperate to get back on track after their shock 2-1 defeat at Lyon, when they face a trip to Saint Etienne for a French Cup quarter-final on Wednesday.","The capital city side suffered a first domestic defeat since March 2015 on Sunday, and know that it will not be easy away to Les Verts, who are well in the hunt for a Champions League place. PSG coach Laurent Blanc said that his men were ""too average"" in their loss at Parc OL, but it will be interesting to see if St Etienne try and mirror Lyon's tactics and play a high press against the cup holders. The Frenchman called on his team to rediscover the spirit that helped them go 36 league matches unbeaten. ""When I see the last ten minutes of the game, when we tried to come back and stay unbeaten, I can say that we were too average to do anything, even if it is Paris, even if it is my team,"" he said. ""The mentality and the aggression that enabled us to stay unbeaten for so long had gone, but it is possible that we can very quickly rediscover that spirit."" Blanc also has injury problems to worry about with the fixtures coming thick and fast. Marco Verratti is once again on the sidelines, while Angel Di Maria missed the Lyon loss after limping off against Reims the week before. With the second leg of the Champions League, last 16 tie against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge to come on March 9, it is unlikely that Blanc will risk either Verratti or Di Maria for the match at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. PSG have won the Coupe de France on nine occasions, second only to arch rivals Marseille who have ten, while the last of St Etienne's six cup successes came back in 1977. Marseille will be hoping to extend their record haul this season, as they face a last eight encounter with fifth-tier Granville on Thursday night. It is a dream tie for the Lower Normandy club, who continue the rich tradition of lower league success in the competition, they are the fifth team from the fifth division to reach the quarter-finals since 1999. The amateur side's Stade Louis Dior is not big enough to host such a match, though, and the game will be played at Ligue 1 club Caen's Stade Michel d'Ornano. This decision has drawn heavy criticism from Monaco, who play at Caen in the league on Friday. The principality outfit, who sit second in the top-flight, are worried about the state of the pitch when they play there. ""AS Monaco wish to express their displeasure following the scheduling of the quarter-final of the Coupe de France between Granville and Marseille,"" the club said in a statement. ""We cannot understand it, as the pitch at Stade d'Ornano already appeared in poor condition in the last game against Rennes."" Nantes, whose 0-0 draw with Monaco on Sunday means they have gone 16 outings without defeat, go to second-tier Sochaux on Wednesday. Sochaux have already claimed the top-flight scalps of Bastia and Monaco in previous rounds. The other quarter-final is an all-Ligue 1 clash between Lorient and Gazelec Ajaccio, with Gazelec having had a few extra days rest after their weekend league match with Marseille was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.

796,28/02/2016,23:57,PSG's record unbeaten run ended by Lyon,Lyon stunned Paris Saint-Germain 2-1 on Sunday to end the defending champions' hopes of becoming the first French team to avoid defeat for a whole league season.,"Young forward Maxwell Cornet stroked Bruno Genesio's men into a surprise early lead and Lyon deservedly made it two through Sergi Darder's wonderfully-taken goal on the stroke of half-time. Lucas Moura pulled one back for the runaway league leaders, but Lyon held on for a famous victory that moves them into the top three. For PSG this was a first league loss since a 3-2 defeat at Bordeaux in March 2015, although they remain 23 points clear of Monaco at the top of the table. Manager Laurent Blanc admitted that his side were off the pace and did not deserve to take anything from the game. ""We were too average, myself included,"" he told Canal+. ""Lyon were in a better state of mind. Were we not at our best? I don't know, we must regroup."" ""We expected a difficult game, but not as hard. I took off a player at half-time (Benjamin Stambouli), I could have made more changes,"" he admitted. Lyon manager Genesio wants his team's display to help them kick on for the rest of the campaign. ""The game counts for three points, but of course beating PSG makes it more satisfying,"" he said. ""What pleased me? The way we implented the plan, with the will to press them high. Certainly, we were up against one of the best teams in Europe, but we need to repeat this performance until the end of the season."" PSG were looking to extend their record unbeaten league streak to 37 matches, but Lyon started the stronger at Parc OL and they forged ahead in the 13th minute. Alexandre Lacazette picked out 19-year-old Cornet, who displayed good footwork to cut inside Gregory van der Wiel, before curling confidently into the far corner to grab his third Ligue 1 goal. The visitors are not used to being behind and their frustration boiled over when Thiago Motta appeared to strike Jordan Ferri in the face, with the Italian fortunate to escape with just a yellow card. On the day that Silva spoke of suffering a bout of depression in the aftermath of Brazil's World Cup thrashing at the hands of Germany two years ago, he was embarrassed by Darder in first half injury-time. Despite Rafael's cross being slightly behind Darder, the Spanish midfielder flicked the ball over the head of centre-back Silva with his first touch, and coolly steered home past Kevin Trapp with his second. With the unbeaten run close to coming to an end Blanc responded by sending on Javier Pastore for Benjamin Stambouli at the interval. The substitute was instrumental in creating space in the Lyon penalty area as the away side pulled one back less than six minutes into the second period. Pastore was crowded out by a group of home defenders, but the ball broke kindly for Brazilian Lucas, who bent his shot just inside the far post. Lyon went straight up the other end and could have restored their two-goal cushion, only for Ferri to side-foot wide. It was by far the busiest outing for Trapp since his move to Paris last summer and the German made an excellent point-blank save with his legs to keep out Rachid Ghezzal. But last season's runners-up closed out a fourth win in five games with ease to move into the third and final Champions League place and become the first team to beat PSG domestically in almost a year. Monaco were held to a goalless draw by in-form Nantes as Caen reignited their unlikely Champions League push with a 2-1 win at Saint-Etienne. Monaco are eight points clear in second but the six teams directly below are separated by just two points in the race for third place. Meanwhile, Marseille's match away to Gazelec Ajaccio was postponed due to the inclement weather in Corsica."
797,28/02/2016,21:46,Thiago Silva admits to post-World Cup depression,Brazil defender Thiago Silva has admitted he suffered from a bout of depression after the host nation's humiliating 7-1 loss to Germany in the semi-finals of the 2014 World Cup.,"In an interview which aired on Canal+ on Sunday, the Paris Saint-Germain captain was asked whether he was affected by depression following the World Cup, to which he replied: ""Yes. It was a somewhat difficult period. ""(PSG) president (Nasser Al-Khelaifi) gave me lots of guidance. He told me: 'You're the best defender in the world, but you still need to work more'. I told him: 'President, I always work. But in my head, I don't know what's happening, there's a problem'."" Silva also spoke about his omission from recent Brazil squads, with the 31-year-old having been overlooked by Dunga since the Selecao's quarter-final exit to Paraguay at last year's Copa America. ""I don't know what exactly is going on. I'm telling the truth. Everyone has forgotten that, even if I think I was responsible, that I didn't actually play against Germany (due to suspension). Everyone thinks it was my fault...it's not my fault, that."" He also thanked PSG coach Laurent Blanc for his support during those trying times. ""Every day, a journalist asked him if he was going to continue to play me, because I wasn't playing as well. He always responded that I was going to carry on, that I was the captain. And that gives you confidence,"" said Silva."

Laurent Blanc's runaway leaders are unbeaten in 36 matches in Ligue 1 dating back to last March, whereas Lyon have suffered 10 defeats -- three more than all of last season -- and find themselves embroiled in a congested scrap for Europe. PSG have beaten Lyon three times already this term, a crushing 5-1 win at the Parc des Princes in December was followed up by further triumphs in both domestic cup competitions, but OL will hope to maintain an unbeaten record in their new 60,000-seater fortress. Since moving into the Parc OL in January, Bruno Genesio's side have registered three wins out of four at home, with their lone dropped points coming in a 1-1 draw with Marseille. However, last Sunday's 1-0 defeat at Lille not only snapped a run of three successive victories but also left Lyon without midfielder Clement Grenier and former PSG defender Christophe Jallet for this weekend's clash after the pair were sent off to compound a miserable evening up north. ""We had the chance to go third and not only did we fail to do that, we also lost two players who will be suspended against Paris so we're paying a heavy price,"" said Genesio, whose side trail PSG by a staggering 34 points. ""That handicaps us even more against Paris, when that was the last thing we needed."" Monaco can take another stride towards claiming the second automatic Champions League berth when they travel to Nantes. Leonardo Jardim's side are eight points clear of Nice and Saint-Etienne, but will face an in-form Nantes outfit unbeaten in 15 matches in all competitions. ""We're very happy. There are still 11 games to go, and we have to hold on to second place,"" Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev told RMC radio. ""The most important thing is always the league table.

However, the French champions refused to say when any punishment would be made known. Aurier appeared in a video on the social media site Periscope in which he directed homophobic insults at Blanc and also appeared to insult several team-mates. Reports in France have suggested that the Ivory Coast international defender may not play for PSG again and that the club will look to sell him in the summer for a cut-price fee. The 23-year-old Aurier has been training on his own in the Swiss city of Geneva, where his agent Stephane Courbis is based, according to Le Parisien. Aurier could be sacked by PSG but his cause has been helped in recent days by team-mate Blaise Matuidi, who said at the weekend that the Ligue 1 club ""need him, whether it be on the field or off it."" And on Monday the African division of players' union FIFPro called for PSG to avoid dishing out an excessive punishment. ""While preserving the image of the club and marking the authority of the directors and coach...the future of Serge Aurier, as a player and as a man, should not be compromised, just because he forgot for two or three minutes that he had obligations towards his coach and his team-mates,"" they said in a statement.

He is well-liked by everyone,"" said Matuidi after PSG beat Reims 4-1 at the Parc des Princes as they continued their relentless march towards another French title. ""We know he made a mistake but, as they say, people make mistakes. He has apologised. He will have a discussion with the coach and we hope it will be positive."" Aurier was suspended by the club last Sunday after appearing in a video on the social media site Periscope in which he directed homophobic insults at PSG coach Laurent Blanc and also appeared to insult several team-mates. He will meet with the club's hierarchy on Monday amid speculation that PSG will not play Aurier again and will look to sell the Ivory Coast international in the summer for a cut-price fee. But Matuidi added: ""We need him, whether it be on the field or off it, because he is someone who is liked by everybody. ""But just like for Zlatan (Ibrahimovic), whose contract is up at the end of the season, I am not the president and I am not the coach. I am speaking as a player, and also as a friend of Serge."" The 23-year-old Aurier has been training on his own in the Swiss city of Geneva, where his agent Stephane Courbis is based, according to Le Parisien. Aurier could be sacked by PSG, but it is unlikely the club would take such a step when they could expect to sell him for as much as 25 million euros (£19.3m, $27.8m). An Africa Cup of Nations winner with the Ivory Coast last year, Aurier joined Paris on an initial loan deal from Toulouse in 2014, with the move made permanent last summer."

Ibrahimovic is playing some of the best football of his career at the moment and the 34-year-old also set up the opener for Gregory van der Wiel and got the assist for Edinson Cavani's goal as Paris maintained their unbeaten domestic record this season. Prince Oniangue had equalised for Reims in the first half but PSG were too strong and are now a huge 27 points clear at the top of the table before Monaco in second host bottom club Troyes later. Laurent Blanc's side extended their Ligue 1 record unbeaten run to 36 matches and the only black mark on their afternoon's work was the first-half substitution of Angel Di Maria, although that was merely a precautionary measure. With Serge Aurier still absent after being suspended by the club for insulting Blanc and several team-mates in a video posted on social media, Van der Wiel started at right-back for PSG and it was the Dutchman who opened the scoring in the 12th minute. Van der Wiel started the move and found Ibrahimovic before running onto the Swede's superb return ball to fire past Johann Carrasso, who was making his debut in goal for the visitors. However, Reims drew level in the 34th minute when Kevin Trapp got nowhere near a Nicolas de Preville free-kick delivery and Congolese midfielder Oniangue gleefully headed into the gaping net. Di Maria was then replaced by Lucas, apparently with a minor hamstring complaint, before Paris went back in front two minutes before the interval. Ibrahimovic initially tried to exchange passes with Lucas only for Franck Signorino to block, but the ball came back to the former Barcelona striker and he tucked home. There was still time for the hosts to make it 3-1 in stoppage time at the end of the first period, with Layvin Kurzawa and Ibrahimovic combining to set up Cavani. The Uruguayan had been brought into the starting line-up after coming off the bench to get the winner against Chelsea and his first-time finish past Carrasso was his 16th goal altogether this season. Blanc replaced the tired Marco Verratti with Blaise Matuidi at the start of a second half which was a quieter affair, although PSG got their fourth goal in the 68th minute. Matuidi worked the ball out to Van der Wiel on the right and his cross was converted by Ibrahimovic at the back post, although he was clearly in an offside position when the ball came in. Nice remain third after a 0-0 draw at Bordeaux on Friday but they could be leapfrogged by Saint-Etienne if they win at Marseille on Sunday and by Lyon, who go to Lille."
805,19/02/2016,16:03,PSG to make a decision on Aurier,"Paris Saint-Germain manager Laurent Blanc confirmed on Friday that the club would ""make a decision"" about the punishment for Serge Aurier, after rumours on social media suggesting he had already been suspended.","Ivorian right-back Aurier made homophobic comments about Blanc in a video released online, and was left out of the team that beat Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday. ""The club will make the decision on Aurier, not the coach,"" said Blanc. ""I will speak to him face-to-face, without a camera. The club will make a decision which he will have to respect. Then we will know whether or not we can count on Aurier until the end of the season."""
806,19/02/2016,02:20,Reims out to inflict European hangover on PSG,"Unbeaten runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain return to Ligue 1 duty against struggling Reims on Saturday, four days after earning a narrow first-leg advantage over Chelsea in the Champions League last 16.","Edinson Cavani made an immediate impact as a substitute on Tuesday by netting a 78th-minute winner at the Parc des Princes after John Obi Mikel had cancelled out Zlatan Ibrahimovic's deflected free-kick to hand Laurent Blanc's side a 2-1 edge. The Uruguayan has started just twice in the league in 2016 after losing his place as a regular starter, but Cavani could well return to the line-up with Blanc preparing to rotate his side this weekend. Reims are one of the few teams to frustrate PSG this season, with the capital club needing another late goal from Cavani to rescue a point in a 1-1 draw back in September. ""Even if it's PSG, a big European team, we're not going there as victims. We always want to show what we're capable of doing against the big teams,"" said Reims defender Abdelhamid El Kaoutari. ""I think (the outcome) will depend on what Paris have to offer. If it's the PSG from Tuesday (against Chelsea), there are few teams who can stand up to them,"" added Reims coach Olivier Guegan, whose side enter the weekend two points above the drop zone. Paris on the other hand are unbeaten in 35 league games and cruising towards a fourth straight French title, with a mammoth 24-point gap separating themselves and nearest challengers Monaco, who are at home to bottom side Troyes this weekend. Lyon were in crisis mode less than a month ago, but three convincing wins in a row have propelled Bruno Genesio's side right back into contention for a top-three finish. OL travel to Lille on Sunday with the visitors trailing third-place Nice and bitter rivals Saint-Etienne by just a point in the race for France's final Champions League berth. ""It's the start of a run we have to continue with a couple of difficult matches coming up. We have to keep on working with the same spirit,"" said Genesio in the wake of last weekend's 4-1 demolition of Caen. Lyon will be without influential midfielder Corentin Tolisso for several weeks after he hurt his hamstring in training, but there was a welcome sight as Nabil Fekir, out since September with a knee injury, stepped up his road to recovery in midweek. Saint-Etienne secured a 3-2 victory at home to Basel in the last 32 of the Europa League on Thursday having thrown away a two-goal lead, with Christophe Galtier's men facing a quick turnaround as they head to Marseille this weekend. Early-season surprise packages Angers and Caen will bid to turn around their fading fortunes at home to Montpellier and Rennes respectively, with both sides losers of their last three matches. Toulouse, currently eight points from safety, can ill-afford another defeat as they risk being cut further adrift when they take on 18th-placed Gazelec Ajaccio. Meanwhile, Bastia's match at home to in-form Nantes, planned for Saturday, has been postponed following violent clashes between fans and police in Corsica.

807,18/02/2016,13:26,Aurier to meet PSG officials on Monday after Blanc comments,"Serge Aurier will meet with Paris Saint-Germain officials on Monday to discuss his controversial social media outburst, French daily Le Parisien reported on Thursday.","The 23-year-old Ivorian used the online app Periscope to record a video in which he aimed homophobic insults at PSG manager Laurent Blanc, and there is the possibility he will be hit with either a ""big fine, a suspension until the end of the season, or even a dismissal"", according to Le Parisien. When contacted by AFP, the club said that they did not want to comment on the matter ""for now"". After the Champions League last-16, first leg win over Chelsea on Tuesday, PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi said that the club had ""made their decision"" about Aurier, without giving any details. Aurier is currently in Geneva to see his agent Stephane Courbis and will stay in Switzerland before returning to Paris."

It did not disclose a transfer fee, but previous British press reports said he would earn 23.5 million pounds ($33.6 million) over two years. ""His arrival will make the team's attack more incisive, we look forward to him showing off his brave spirit,"" the Chinese club added. Chinese teams have been splashing their cash in Europe, as wealthy owners embrace President Xi Jinping's vision of the sleeping Asian giant becoming a new footballing heavyweight. Hebei China Fortune are owned by a Beijing-based developer of industrial parks, founded by billionaire Wang Wenxue. Lavezzi joins Ivorian striker Gervinho at the club after he signed for 18 million euros ($20 million) in January, along with Cameroon captain and former Marseille centre-back Stephane Mbia. Lavezzi joined PSG in 2012 for 30 million euros ($34 million) from Napoli, but has been used mainly as a substitute this season, with just three league starts. The current transfer window shuts on February 26 in China, and has already seen big-money moves by Brazilians Alex Teixeira and Ramires, along with Colombia's Jackson Martinez, to join the cash-flush China Super League."
809,16/02/2016,22:41,Cavani gives PSG edge against Chelsea,The much-maligned Edinson Cavani came off the bench to score the winner as Paris Saint-Germain edged Chelsea 2-1 in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday.,"Cavani beat the excellent Thibaut Courtois in the 78th minute at the Parc des Princes, just four minutes after coming off the bench, to give the French champions the advantage ahead of the second leg on March 9. Zlatan Ibrahimovic had earlier given Paris the lead from a deflected free-kick only for a rare John Obi Mikel goal on the stroke of half-time to bring Chelsea level. PSG's win in what was a high-quality encounter means they have still lost just once -- to Real Madrid -- in 40 games this season, while it was a first defeat for Chelsea since Guus Hiddink replaced the sacked Jose Mourinho in December. With John Terry absent, Chelsea's reshuffled defence featured skipper for the night Branislav Ivanovic in the middle alongside Gary Cahill with Cesar Azpilicueta at right-back and Baba Rahman on the other side. Marquinhos started at right-back for PSG after Serge Aurier was ruled out by the club for disciplinary reasons, while Marco Verratti returned to the starting line-up after a month of fitness struggles. With the Italian midfielder pulling the strings from the off, Paris started strongly, asphyxiating Chelsea with their high press. Such a bright opening led to chances, with Verratti seeing his shot from 20 yards beaten away by Courtois and Lucas hitting one narrowly wide inside the first five minutes. Ibrahimovic sent a free-kick off target as Chelsea weathered the early storm and gradually grew into the game. They should have opened the scoring, too, but when Baba Rahman's inviting cross from the left found Diego Costa, his header from point-blank range was instinctively palmed onto the bar and over by Kevin Trapp in the home goal. That was a key moment as Paris went on to open the scoring in the 39th minute. Mikel was booked for halting a rampaging run by Lucas at the gates of the penalty box and Ibrahimovic stepped up to smash the resulting free-kick into the net, with the aid of a deflection off the wall, for his 28th goal of the season. However, the French champions were unable to hold onto their lead until the interval as Chelsea equalised with the final kick of the first half. Willian's delivery from the right was not cut out at the near post and Mikel gleefully prodded home from six yards for a rare goal. It could have been worse for the home side as Trapp was forced to make himself big and save from Costa four minutes into the second half following a counterattack led by Willian. A long spell of Paris domination followed but they were thwarted several times in their attempts to find a winner as Courtois produced an array of outstanding saves. The Belgian tipped over a long-range thumper by Angel Di Maria and denied Lucas after the Brazilian had played a one-two with Ibrahimovic and accelerated towards the area. He then stretched his huge frame across goal to turn behind a net-bound Di Maria free-kick, but there was nothing he could do to stop Cavani's winner. The Uruguayan, who has lost his place as a regular starter in the PSG side due to a poor start to 2016, played the role of super sub as he kept his cool to meet Di Maria's flighted ball into the box with a low first-time finish."
810,15/02/2016,16:00,PSG 'boxing in different category' against Chelsea,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc knows his side's awesome domestic form counts for nothing now as they prepare to face Chelsea in the Champions League for the third season running.,"PSG are in the midst of a record-breaking run of 35 games unbeaten in France's top flight and have not been beaten domestically since March last year. Their only defeats in that time have come against Barcelona in last season's Champions League quarter-finals and away to Real Madrid in this season's group stage. That shows they still have progress to make to become a genuine contender for European glory, and Blanc admits he will not be judged favourably if Paris fall to the Premier League side in the last 16. ""Coming into the season with PSG you know that your season will be judged on what you do in the Champions League,"" Blanc said at a press conference at the Parc des Princes on the eve of the first leg against Chelsea. With a touch of sarcasm, he added: ""There's hardly any point in even playing in the league because apparently you've won it before it has even begun. ""Here we are up against a club in the same category as PSG, if not even stronger. ""Chelsea have experience and have won the Champions League so, although we are better equipped now, we are also aware that we are coming up against a difficult team. ""Now we are boxing in a category that we don't have in our domestic league,"" added Blanc, whose side are a huge 24 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 from second-placed Monaco and destined to win a fourth straight French title. The teams renew their rivalry with recent history suggesting there is very little between them -- Chelsea triumphed on away goals in the quarter-finals in 2014 but PSG took revenge as they won in the same fashion in the last 16 a year ago. When December's draw, with a sense of inevitability, paired the sides together again, PSG appeared the undisputed favourites. That was as much down to Chelsea's travails as PSG's form, but just three days later Jose Mourinho was sacked and the London club have since begun a steady recovery under Guus Hiddink. They remain in the bottom half of the Premier League but they have gone 12 games unbeaten, including a 5-1 thumping of Newcastle United on Saturday as Diego Costa scored his eighth goal in that time. ""Now we have more confidence to go there and to play. Paris have a great team, great players, but we go there to try to win the game,"" Brazilian star Willian told Chelsea TV. Of his veteran counterpart Hiddink, Blanc said: ""He has brought a lot of serenity to the club and I think their form shows the players have rediscovered a bit of calm."" ""For Chelsea the Champions League will be a way for them to save their season,"" added midfielder Marco Verratti, who on Monday extended his contract with PSG through to 2020. ""We know this will be a very difficult match because Chelsea still have great players. There is no favourite."" Both managers have selection issues to contend with, as Chelsea sweat on the fitness of captain John Terry after he came off injured against Newcastle. However, he trained at the club's Cobham base on Monday and the smart money would be on him starting, especially as Kurt Zouma is out for the season with a knee injury. PSG's preparations have been overshadowed after defender Serge Aurier was suspended by the club for insulting Blanc and several team-mates in a video posted on social media over the weekend. Aurier's absence will mean either Gregory van der Wiel or Marquinhos starts at right-back, while Verratti, who has had a groin problem, could start for the first time in a month even if Blanc insists he cannot last 90 minutes. ""Of course we are perturbed by what happened, but I have almost my whole squad available -- one has taken himself out of consideration. Too bad for him,"" said Blanc."
811,15/02/2016,15:02,Blanc admits anger at Aurier insults,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc admitted that he took insults made by defender Serge Aurier in a video on social media ""very badly"" as he promised to confront the disgraced player face to face.","Aurier, 23, was suspended by PSG on Sunday, ruling him out of Tuesday's Champions League last 16, first leg clash with Chelsea, after homophobic insults directed at his coach in the clip recorded with the online app Periscope on Saturday night. The Ivory Coast international also appeared to insult several of his team-mates and Blanc was clearly angry when asked about the matter at a press conference on Monday. ""I took it very badly. One can think certain things and have opinions. We are in a democratic country but two years ago I made an effort to bring this boy to Paris. I find it pitiful,"" he said. ""We are here to prepare for Chelsea but he has penalised himself. He should be preparing for a last-16 Champions League tie. That would be better for him than being stuck at home not knowing what to do."" Expressing frustration with the younger generation of players, the World Cup-winning defender added: ""Lots of people in this new generation spend their time apologising. Rather than do that they should think more before they do anything. ""The club has taken decisions. You will find out if they take any more decisions, but if he has a problem with me I will not use the media to clear up my problem. I will deal with him directly,"" he added. Aurier, formerly of Toulouse, apologised on French television on Sunday evening saying he would ""accept all consequences"" after the release of the video. The Periscope app allows people to broadcast live videos via their smartphones, which Aurier did as his friend, who was smoking a shisha pipe, asked him questions posed by fans. He will miss the first-leg clash with Chelsea, a year after he was suspended by UEFA for insulting referee Bjorn Kuipers in a video he posted on social media. On that occasion, his tirade came after Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off in the second leg of PSG's dramatic away goals win against the London club at the same stage of the Champions League. He missed the quarter-final defeat to Barcelona as a result. In his absence, either Gregory van der Wiel or Marquinhos will start at right-back on Tuesday evening."
812,15/02/2016,02:05,Chelsea with momentum ahead of trip to Paris,Two months have passed since the draw for the Champions League last 16 was made and much has changed in that time as Paris Saint-Germain prepare to meet Chelsea in one of the headline ties on Tuesday.,"When the sides were paired together for the third successive season in December's draw at UEFA's Swiss headquarters, PSG appeared the undisputed favourites. That was as much down to Chelsea's travails as PSG's almost flawless form, but just three days later Jose Mourinho was sacked and the Premier League side have since begun a steady recovery under Guus Hiddink. They remain in the bottom half of the Premier League but they have gone 12 games unbeaten, including a 5-1 thumping of Newcastle United on Saturday as Diego Costa scored his eighth goal in that time. ""Now we have more confidence to go there and to play. Paris have a great team, great players, but we go there to try to win the game,"" Willian told Chelsea TV. PSG are not exactly in bad shape, with a 1-0 loss at Real Madrid in the group stage their only defeat in 39 games this season. They have not lost a domestic match since March last year and had won 16 games in a row before a 0-0 draw with Lille on Saturday, when coach Laurent Blanc decided to rest top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, captain Thiago Silva, Thiago Motta and Maxwell. However, PSG's build-up to the match has been overshadowed after defender Serge Aurier was suspended for insulting Blanc and many of his team-mates in a video posted on social media. Aurier would have started, as would highly influential midfielder Marco Verratti, who Blanc says is not fit enough having featured sparingly in a wearying run of 12 games in the last six weeks. ""They (Chelsea) didn't have a match last midweek, unlike us. The Champions League merits more preparation than we have been able to put in as we have been playing every three days,"" complained Blanc, whose side beat Chelsea in the last 16 a year ago after losing in the quarter-finals in 2014. Hiddink says he will not take any risks on captain John Terry, who came off injured against Newcastle, while Kurt Zouma is out for the season with a knee injury. Roma and Real Madrid, meanwhile, have both changed coaches since they were paired together with the first leg of their tie at the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday. Madrid came through their group unbeaten and ahead of PSG, but Rafa Benitez was sacked at the start of January with his team lagging behind in the Spanish title race and the legendary Zinedine Zidane has since come in, overseeing five wins and a draw in La Liga. At Roma, French coach Rudi Garcia was fired last month after a run of one win in 10. He has been replaced by Luciano Spalletti, who twice took Roma to the Champions League quarter-finals during a previous stint as coach, including in 2008 when the Giallorossi beat Real in the last 16. Zidane, who has Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Pepe carrying injuries, of course has happy memories of the competition with Real, having starred in their 2002 final win over Bayer Leverkusen. ""I have super memories as a player and as a coach because I won it with this club as assistant manager with (Carlo) Ancelotti too, so obviously there is a particular allure,"" he added. Wolfsburg reached the last 16 at the expense of Manchester United but the Bundesliga club had gone five games without a win before beating Ingolstadt 2-0 on Saturday to set themselves up for Wednesday's trip to Belgium to play Gent. ""The important thing for us is to have ended the negative run - we have won now and that's all that counts. There is a lot we can take from that for the future,"" said Wolves coach Dieter Hecking as his side prepare to face the team who were the surprise package of the group stage, qualifying at the expense of Valencia and Lyon. Tuesday's other match sees Zenit St Petersburg and their Portuguese coach Andre Villas-Boas face Benfica in Lisbon. The long Russian mid-season break means Zenit have not played competitively since December and they have already been in Portugal for some winter training. ""The main difficulty lies in the fact that we will meet with a team which is faster and more mobile, because it continues to play in a championship without interruption,"" said Villas-Boas last week."
813,14/02/2016,12:05,Aurier in hot water after Blanc 'faggot' social media jibe,Paris Saint-Germain defender Serge Aurier could find himself in hot water after insulting manager Laurent Blanc and many of his team-mates in a live video he and a friend recorded with the online app Periscope on Saturday night.,"The Ivorian at one stage appeared to describe Blanc as a ""faggot"", although he was not actually in shot at the time. When his friend asks him whether or not ""Blanc sucks off Zlatan (Ibrahimovic)?"", Aurier answers: ""Yes, he takes everything, even his balls."" The French champions have their most important match of the season on Tuesday with a Champions League last 16, first-leg tie against Chelsea at the Parc des Princes. Aurier would have been expected to start that game after being rested for Saturday's league draw with Lille, but his social media outburst could cost him his place. The Periscope app allows people to broadcast live videos via their smartphones, which Aurier did as his friend asked him questions posed by fans while smoking a shisha pipe. The 23-year-old Aurier continued to insult his team-mates in an expletive-filled tirade, including Angel di Maria, whom he called a ""clown"". When asked which PSG goalkeeper, Salvatore Sirigu or Kevin Trapp, was better, Aurier replied simply that Sirigu was ""done"". The right-back has responded that the video was fake and old, but comments on the live feed referencing Valentine's Day suggest that it was posted on Saturday night. Canal+ columnist Pierre Menes says he had been in contact with Aurier, tweeting that he is ""going to deny the claims and take legal action concerning the falsification of a video"". Aurier got himself into trouble in a similar manner just under a year ago. Last season PSG knocked Chelsea out in the last-16 on away goals, despite a controversial red card for Ibrahimovic. Aurier was then suspended after repeatedly swearing while insulting referee Bjorn Kuipers in a video he posted on social media."
814,13/02/2016,19:02,PSG warm up for Chelsea clash with Lille draw,A much-changed Paris Saint-Germain warmed up for their Champions League showdown with Chelsea with a low-key goalless draw at home to struggling Lille at the Parc des Princes on Saturday.,"Edinson Cavani had the best chance for the runaway Ligue 1 leaders but somehow missed the target with the goal gaping in the second half. The result ended a run of 16 consecutive wins in all competitions but it did allow Laurent Blanc's side to extend their record-breaking unbeaten run in Ligue 1 to 35 matches and left them still undefeated domestically since March last year. Lille will be delighted with a point that boosts their fight against relegation, but this was a Paris side missing top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, captain Thiago Silva, Thiago Motta and Maxwell. That quartet were all rested with one eye on Tuesday's last-16, first leg at home to an improving Chelsea, and Blanc made eight changes altogether to the side that beat Lyon 3-0 in the French Cup in midweek. Of the likely starting line-up against the Premier League side, only goalkeeper Kevin Trapp, David Luiz, Blaise Matuidi and Angel Di Maria started, while Marco Verratti was back on the bench after being troubled by injury recently. Lille, meanwhile, were without their biggest creative threat Sofiane Boufal due to suspension and Portugal striker Eder, freshly arrived on loan from Swansea City, was absent due to injury. It was always going to be a backs to the wall job for the away side but they have the meanest defence in the division after their opponents and were rarely troubled in the first half. Vincent Enyeama saved well from young forward Jean-Kevin Augustin and Layvin Kurzawa saw his header cleared off the line in a first period low on excitement. Verratti, the Italy midfielder whose presence is seen as critical against Chelsea, replaced the disappointing Javier Pastore at the start of the second half and Paris passed up a glorious chance to open the scoring in the 56th minute. Nigerian keeper Enyeama dropped a cross from the PSG left and the ball fell to Cavani, who somehow contrived to blast the ball high and wide despite being left with a gaping goal. Enyeama then saved from a deflected shot by Lucas, who had come on for Di Maria, as Lille held out for the first goalless draw at the Parc des Princes in Ligue 1 since December 2014. PSG are still a huge 25 points clear at the top of the table from Monaco, who visit Saint-Etienne on Sunday. Nice, in third, host Marseille on Sunday when Lyon are at home to Caen."

Sylla will likely attend the Champions League last 16, first leg tie in Parc des Princes after receiving an invitation from anti-racism groups. ""PSG (Sportitude and SOS Racism) invited me and I want to go,"" he told French daily Le Parisien. ""I want to show the English and especially my attackers that I'm still here, and doing well. Even if the wound that opened that night has still not closed."" Four Chelsea supporters were given football banning orders at an English court in July, although they denied racist chanting and said the carriage was simply full. But a district judge banned them because of ""compelling"" video evidence. Former police officer Richard Barklie, 50, Joshua Parsons, 20, and William Simpson, 26, were all banned from attending football matches for the maximum time of five years, while Jordan Munday, 20, was banned for three years. ""There are two parts to this: one is in Great Britain where the individuals were given stadium bans,"" Sylla's lawyer Jim Michel-Gabriel said. ""The other is in Paris where the prosecutor is still investigating a 'racist assault by a group on public transport'."""

Reaching the last four of Europe's premier club competition is the principal objective for PSG this season, but on Thursday Blanc received the Qatari owners' unequivocal backing after penning a contract extension until 2018. ""I'm very happy, also for my staff. A coach is nothing without his staff. For us, continuing the adventure is a show of faith but also a big responsibility,"" Blanc said of his renewal. ""The club has ambitions both nationally and in Europe, and we'll do all we can to reach those objectives."" PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi insisted he never had any doubts that the former France coach was the right man to take the club forward. ""I always had confidence in Laurent Blanc, I never thought about appointing another coach,"" said Al-Khelaifi, adding he had ""always believed in (Blanc's) ability to take the team to a higher level each season"". PSG are well on course to sew up a fourth successive league title, with a huge 24-point lead over nearest rivals Monaco, but Saturday's match at the Parc des Princes is the seventh in an eight-game series in little over three weeks. ""The calendar can't get any tighter than that. If you talk to me about the fixture list, I get heated, so it's better to avoid it,"" Blanc said after Wednesday's 3-0 victory over Lyon sent holders PSG through to the quarter-finals of the French Cup. ""As of Sunday, we'll start preparing for the game against Chelsea. The game against Lille, with all respect to Lille, is badly timed."" Second-place Monaco can widen the gap between themselves and the chasing pack in the race for France's other automatic Champions League qualifying spot when they visit Saint-Etienne, who are six points adrift in fourth, on Sunday. Third-place Nice, above Saint-Etienne on goal difference, host Marseille although Claude Puel's Champions League hopefuls will be without leading scorer Hatem Ben Arfa after the France international was ruled out for around a month with a hamstring injury. Lyon have forced their way back into European contention with successive 3-0 wins over Bordeaux and Angers, and Bruno Genesio's side will seek to bounce back from their cup exit at home to Caen. ""We've shown we have the quality to compete at the top of the table from here until the end of the season,"" Genesio said following the defeat in Paris, with teenage striker Maxwell Cornet adding to that sentiment. ""We've managed to pick ourselves up in the league. We have to continue to work hard ahead of Sunday's match,"" said Cornet, who was disappointed Lyon were unable to build on a promising start again PSG in midweek. Slumping Angers, losers of five of their past seven matches, will aim to arrest their slide and reignite an unlikely European challenge away to Rennes on Friday. Nantes and Lorient, who both progressed to the last eight of the French Cup on Wednesday, meet in a Brittany derby on Saturday, while Montpellier host fellow strugglers Toulouse with both sides bidding to avoid relegation.

""The club has ambitions both nationally and in Europe, and we'll do all we can to reach those objectives. ""We'll get there; we're ready. We're aware that we're at a big club where expectations are very high."" ""Laurent Blanc is now tied to the capital's club until 30 June, 2018,"" PSG said. Paris won the league, French Cup, and league cup last year and are on course to repeat the feat this year. They have not lost a game in domestic competition for seven months and beat Lyon 3-0 on Wednesday to reach the French Cup quarter finals. The club said Blanc signed his new deal just before the match. But the Champions League is the trophy that Paris owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi wants and the announcement surprised some. Paris are seeking their first-ever Champions League crown after bowing out at the quarter-final stage for the past three seasons. Al-Khelaifi said in a French newspaper interview in December that he considers Blanc to be ""one of the best coaches in the world."" And in announcing the new deal, he said he was ""extremely proud and happy"" with the extension. ""It was important to us that he be a continuing part of Paris Saint-Germain's plans. He has obtained excellent results since his arrival. He has already won eight trophies with us, which is quite simply formidable. ""Also, I like our team's playing style, a style that he has instilled."" Blanc has shown in his handling of the temperamental big-salary stars such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani and David Luiz that he can be firm while encouraging their talent. Former France international Blanc arrived at PSG in 2013 after Italian Carlo Ancelotti left for Real Madrid, despite the initial reservations of the Qatari owners who wanted a bigger-name. But Blanc had his contract extended in 2014, and has so far won eight trophies with the Parisians, last year taking the three key titles as well as France's Super Cup. PSG are riding high in the French top-flight this season, with a lead of 24 points over nearest rivals Monaco with only 13 more matches to play."

Adrien Rabiot then netted a third on 75 minutes, with Laurent Blanc's men staying firmly on course to repeat last year's domestic treble. Blanc handed Edinson Cavani, relegated to several substitute appearances in Ligue 1 since the turn of the year, a start in place of Angel Di Maria, while midfielder Blaise Matuidi made way for Benjamin Stambouli in midfield. A quiet first half saw Paris fail to register a single shot on target, with Cavani wasting the home side's best opportunity when he steered wide after Lucas picked out the Uruguayan just inside the area. Maxwell Cornet went close to giving Lyon the lead five minutes before the break, but Salvatore Sirigu flung himself to his left to brilliantly turn behind the teenager's curling effort. Ibrahimovic drilled narrowly wide early in the second period, but PSG's mounting pressure eventually told on 63 minutes as Lucas burst down the left-hand side before crossing for Ibrahimovic to chest home. The Swede struck again just four minutes later when Serge Aurier slid in a low cross from the right for Ibrahimovic, who was marginally offside, to poke beyond Anthony Lopes. Alexandre Lacazette blazed over as Bruno Genesio's men sought to reduce the deficit, and the visitors were understandably aggrieved when Rabiot, clearly behind the last defender, converted Maxwell's left-wing cross to seal a fourth win in as many attempts over Lyon this season. Earlier, Nantes came from behind in extra time to claim a thrilling 4-3 victory at Bordeaux, with US international Alejandro Bedoya netting a 118th-minute winner. Saint-Etienne also needed extra time to see off Ligue 1's bottom side Troyes as France Under-21 forward Neal Maupay struck the decisive blow in the 107th minute, while Lorient thumped fourth-tier Sarre-Union 4-0.

821,09/02/2016,16:11,"Blanc, Luiz, hold clear the air talks",Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc has held clear the air talks with David Luiz over the Brazilian international's refusal to come off against Marseille.,"Towards the end of Sunday's game at the Velodrome, Blanc ordered Marquinhos to replace Luiz, who had picked up a thigh injury, only for the defender to refuse to cede his place. Blanc was visibly upset after the 2-1 win, suggesting drily that ""he (Luiz) had done well to stay on the pitch because he was really good in the final ten minutes"". The player and coach met on Monday to discuss the incident. ""Yesterday we had a very good and very long discussion, it was imperative in order to continue to have good relations,"" Blanc told a press conference on Tuesday. ""It lasted quite some time. I'm quite satisfied with what he had to say at this meeting. It was important for him, for me, and for the team."" Blanc was speaking ahead of Wednesday's French Cup last 16 tie with Lyon for which Luiz remains a doubt. ""He injured his thigh and his knee but he's a special boy,"" said blanc. ""He'll train this afternoon as usual. He often plays with problems. He turned out (for Chelsea) in the Champions League final with a thigh problem."""
822,08/02/2016,00:10,Di Maria fires unbeaten PSG past Marseille,Paris Saint-Germain defeated bitter rivals Marseille 2-1 on Sunday to extend their record unbeaten run in Ligue 1 to 34 matches as the hosts remained unable to solve their home woes.,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored his league-leading 21st goal of the season to give PSG the lead inside two minutes at the Stade Velodrome, but Remy Cabella hauled Marseille level midway through the first half with a wonderful solo effort. However, Angel Di Maria struck the winning goal on 71 minutes to hand PSG a 15th straight win in all competitions and keep Laurent Blanc's side a huge 24 points clear at the top of the table. ""Marseille gave us a really physical battle which we expected. We showed our solidarity to see out the victory, but we've now got to ready ourselves for the two games before Chelsea (in the Champions League). It's not going to be easy,"" said Blanc. ""The players, like you (journalists), are thinking about the game against Chelsea but...it's not the last game before Chelsea, there's one in three days and another in six."" Marseille have now failed to win any of their last 10 home games in the league, while their streak of 11 games without defeat was also snapped after succumbing to a ninth successive 'Classique' loss. Despite the defeat Michel's side are still just five points off third-place Nice, who they visit next Sunday, in the race for the final Champions League spot. Billed as French football's most explosive fixture, Sunday's encounter on the south coast was no different with five people arrested prior to kick-off following a run-in with police outside the ground. Blanc made six changes to the side that beat Lorient on Wednesday to set a new record for the longest sequence of games without defeat in the French top flight, recalling the likes of Di Maria, Blaise Matuidi and David Luiz. Marseille welcomed back both Michy Batshuayi and Abdelaziz Barrada from suspension, while Lassana Diarra made his return from injury in central midfield. PSG were unbeaten in their last 10 meetings with Marseille, having won the last six in Ligue 1, and the visitors again seized the upper hand before the hosts had time to settle. Maxwell was sent galloping down the left wing after after being released by Matuidi and the Brazilian picked out Ibrahimovic at the back post as the Swede netted for the fifth game running. France midfielder Matuidi again dissected the Marseille defence a few minutes later, although this time Di Maria dragged his shot agonisingly wide of the far post. Barrada should have levelled for the home side when Thiago Motta failed to clear Brice Dja Djedje's cross, but the Morocco midfielder lashed over as the ball dropped invitingly for him. However, the hosts did equalise on 25 minutes as Cabella gathered the ball near the halfway line, skipped past Motta and fired low beyond Kevin Trapp from outside the area, with the German unable to keep it out despite getting a strong hand to the ball. Lucas wasted a prime chance to restore PSG's lead when he scuffed wide after a sublime Di Maria through ball, while Maxwell was forced to clear off the line after Batshuayi hooked a corner goalwards. But PSG continued their dominance of Marseille as Di Maria, set up by Ibrahimovic, swept home his ninth goal of the season 19 minutes from time to keep the capital club's winning run intact. Steven Fletcher came on for his Marseille debut late on, while Georges-Kevin Nkoudou watched a shot flash wide as the hosts hit PSG on the break but ultimately were left still searching for a first home win since September. Earlier, Saint-Etienne registered a thumping 4-1 win at Bordeaux to move level on points with Nice, while Rennes salvaged a point late on in a 1-1 draw at Lille. On Saturday, Monaco strengthened their hold on second place with a 1-0 win over Cote d'Azur rivals Nice, while Lyon continued their mini-revival with a 3-0 victory away to Angers."

When contacted by AFP though, PSG said that ""not all the conditions are ready yet"" for a transfer. The transfer window closes in China on February 26. Chinese teams have made their financial muscle felt in recent weeks, with former Chelsea midfielder Ramires and Atletico Madrid striker Jackson Martinez both moving to the Far East. Shakhtar Donetsk striker Alex Teixeira, reportedly a Liverpool target, joined Ramires at Jiangsu Suning for a Chinese record of 50 million euros ($55 million). Colombian striker Martinez had broken the previous record fee when he signed for Guangzhou Evergrande. The 30-year-old Lavezzi now could be set to continue the recent exodus from Europe to China, after only being given three Ligue 1 starts all season by PSG manager Laurent Blanc. The runaway French league leaders will attempt to increase their record unbeaten streak of 33 matches on Sunday at the Velodrome, where Marseille have not won in the league in nine outings."
824,06/02/2016,15:25,'No conditions' to new PSG contract - Blanc,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc insisted Saturday that negotiations with the Ligue 1 giants over a contract extension were advancing and were not linked to success in the Champions League.,"""It's moving forward, I don't like talking about my particular case too much, but stay patient a little longer and you'll soon have news,"" said Blanc whose contract expires in June. Asked if there were conditions attached with the reigning three-time Ligue 1 winners facing Chelsea in the Champions League last 16 on February 16. ""The club called us to tell us that they wanted to extend and that I know it has no conditions."" Former France international Blanc arrived at PSG in 2013 after Italian Carlo Ancelotti left for Real Madrid, despite the initial reservations of the club's Qatari owners who wanted a bigger-named manager. But the 50-year-old had his contract extended in 2014, and has so far won eight trophies with the Parisians, last year achieving an unprecedented domestic quadruple."

PSG -- with 66 points from 24 games -- have an impressive 24-point lead with their fourth consecutive and sixth overall league title beckoning. The Parisians have won their past eight 'Classique' clashes with Marseille, and another would give them a new record of consecutive wins against their rivals. ""To win we have to stick to our philosophy. We can't change it during a Classique,"" said Brazilian defender Maxwell, who has never been on the losing side in 10 previous meetings with Marseille. ""We're in a good place. We have to be confident, and have the same desire we've shown up until now. That makes the difference in these matches."" Marseille, who claimed the last of their ten Ligue 1 titles back in 2010, are eighth in the league -- 32 points behind PSG. A 1-0 victory at Montpellier Tuesday pushed Marseille's unbeaten league run to 11 matches, with their last away loss a 2-1 defeat to PSG at the Parc de Princes on October 4. But that impressive statistic conceals misery at their Velodrome stronghold where they have not won since September 13. Blanc's side will be looking to further flex their muscles with a Champions League last 16 tie against Chelsea on February 16. But counterpart Michel can count on the support of their loyal fans with PSG's supporters banned from travelling to Marseille because of security concerns. Marseille will be without newly-signed winger Florian Thauvin after he received a red card against Montpellier, but Scotland striker Steven Fletcher, also a transfer window signing, should give the southern giants fresh legs. ""It's a match we have to win, for the club, for the fans and above all for us,"" said Marseille midfielder Remy Cabella. ""If we got a result against Paris it would give us a boost."" Striker Georges-Kévin Nkoudou added: ""I know that there is always pressure between Paris and Marseille, but it remains a classic, and it's up to us to rise to the occasion."" Second-placed Monaco, 24 points behind PSG, host Nice, three points behind in third, in a classic Riviera derby on Saturday. The clash is crucial for qualification for elite European football next season, with Monaco's billionaire Russian owner Dmitry Rybolovlev making a rare appearance at training to motivate the troops. ""He said some words to motivate us, to wake us up and to take this match seriously,"" said Morocco midfielder Nabil Dirar. Lyon, back into the top half, above 11th-place Bordeaux on goal difference, are six points adrift of the Champions League spots. Coach Bruno Genesio is hopeful their 3-0 win over Bordeaux will boost his side. ""It's good for morale,"" said Genesio. ""I hope it will be the spark that will open the way to some good results."" Lyon travel to Angers, sitting fourth with 37 points, and looking to get back to winning ways after losing 2-1 at Reims, while Bordeaux host fifth-placed Saint-Etienne. Nantes will be looking to extend their unbeaten streak to 11 matches at Toulouse as Lille host Rennes, Guingamp travel to Corsica side Gazelec Ajaccio and Reims visit Caen. Tailenders Troyes, who sacked coach Claude Robin after a heavy 4-0 defeat at Guingamp left them 15 points from safety, travel to Bastia on Saturday. Fixtures (all 19:00 GMT unless stated)"
826,05/02/2016,13:11,Motta wants to end career in Paris,"Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Thiago Motta is set on staying in the French capital until his playing days are over, the two-time winner of the Champions League told AFP this week.","""If I can finish here, so much the better,"" said Motta, who is under contract at PSG until June 2017 but tried to force a switch back to Atletico Madrid last summer. ""It's difficult to imagine moving now, even if from one year to another things can change,"" said the 33-year-old Motta, who has won the Champions League with Inter Milan and Barcelona. ""I have decided to stay in Paris and I'm happy with that. PSG is my home and I feel important here,"" added Motta, who is in his fifth season with the French champions. Originally from Brazil Motta enjoyed six seasons at Barcelona before a switch to Atletico Madrid a year after his first Champions League win over Arsenal in 2006. He then enjoyed even greater success at Inter Milan, winning a treble of Italian league and Cup and the Champions League under Jose Mourinho in 2010. PSG coach Laurent Blanc describes Motta as part of the club's DNA and since joining in 2012 he has been a towering presence on and off the pitch as the club has won the last three French titles and has built a team capable of challenging for the Champions League."

France international Mathieu Debuchy made his Bordeaux debut following his loan move from Arsenal, while Uruguayan striker Diego Rolan was twice denied by fine saves from Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. Lyon climbed back into the top half of the table, above 10th-place Bordeaux on goal difference, and are six points adrift of the Champions League spots. Nice leapfrogged Angers into third as Hatem Ben Arfa grabbed his 11th goal of the campaign in a 1-0 win over Toulouse, while 10-man Angers were beaten 2-1 at Reims. Nantes extended their unbeaten streak to 10 matches following a 3-1 victory over Gazelec Ajaccio, Guingamp condemned lowly Troyes to a 4-0 defeat and Lille earned a 1-0 win over Caen. Runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain can break Nantes' 20-year-old record unbeaten run in Ligue 1 later when they host Lorient. Laurent Blanc's side stretched their streak without a loss to 32 matches with Sunday's 2-0 victory at Saint-Etienne and can claim the top-flight record outright if they avoid defeat at the Parc des Princes. On Tuesday, Monaco tightened their grip on second place with a 2-0 win at home to Bastia, while 10-man Marseille claimed a 1-0 victory at Montpellier to push their unbeaten run in the league to 11 matches."

They have totally dominated French football in the last few years, but this season they have found a higher level as their rivals have fallen away. Laurent Blanc's men are now a staggering 24 points clear of second-placed Monaco after the principality outfit were well-beaten at surprise package Angers. Lorient should not pose much of a threat to PSG's record bid, although manager Blanc may choose to ring the changes after a run of five games in a fortnight. The luxury of the depth of the Frenchman's squad is far greater than any other manager in the division can enjoy, but Blanc said after Sunday's match that he does mention records to his expensively-assembled group of players. ""There's been a great deal of talk about the record and it helped me motivate the players, even if they don't really need that,"" Blanc said. ""I ask a lot from the players, I demand it. And what I take away tonight as much as the record is the way this team never gives up."" PSG were pushed hard for long periods by a feisty Les Verts before closing out victory with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's sixth league brace this term. The defending champions will be without the injured defending trio of Thiago Silva, David Luiz and Gregory van der Wiel for the visit of Lorient, but it is hard to see Sylvain Ripoll's men throwing much caution to the wind in the capital. Monaco currently occupy second place in the table despite having a nine-match unbeaten run ended by a comprehensive loss at third-placed Angers on Saturday. Leonardo Jardim's side will be expecting to finish in the top three and qualify for a third successive Champions League campaign. They kick off the midweek programme on Tuesday evening when they host Bastia, who gave their new manager Francois Ciccolini the perfect start with victory over Lyon at the weekend. While PSG have been constructing win after win, both Lyon and Marseille have been struggling. Lyon, who were runners-up last season have now won just one of their last 10 Ligue 1 matches and new head coach Bruno Genesio will be looking for just his second win in charge when they host in-form Bordeaux on Wednesday. Marseille, meanwhile, have not won at the Velodrome in the league since September 13 against Bastia and their Spanish manager Michel is still struggling to turn the tide of negativity on the south coast. His most recent move was to bring much-maligned winger Florian Thauvin back to the club on loan from Newcastle United, and the 23-year-old could be in the lineup for the game against lowly Montpellier.

829,31/01/2016,23:16,Ibrahimovic blasts Paris into record books,A Zlatan Ibrahimovic brace saw Paris Saint Germain stretch their lead atop Ligue 1 to a massive 24 points on Sunday in a 2-0 away win over a spirited Saint Etienne.,"Not only was this a club record 13th straight win, it also sees the rampaging Paris side equal Nantes' 20-year-old record of 32 league games without defeat. Saint Etienne coach Christophe Galtier had joked before the game that Ibrahimovic must hate his team so often does he score against them. And the giant Swede duly clinched his 18th league goal of the campaign on the hour with a certain venom before scoring his 19th, a simple tap in, with the last kick of the game. Paris now have 63 points from 23 games after twenty wins and three draws, while in second Monaco have 39 points after losing 3-0 to third placed Angers, who now have 37, on Saturday. PSG have not lost in Ligue 1 since a 3-2 defeat to Bordeaux on March 15 last year. The hosts threw everything they had at the champions and drew several key saves from 'keeper Kevin Trapp, notably through captain Franck Tabanou. PSG's Argentine winger Angel di Maria was a constant menace with his runs and passes and set up Ibrahimovic for a cheeky back-heel shot by lobbing the static defence. But the opener came when when Ibrahimovic ran onto a perfectly weighted Serge Aurier cross to fire home at full stretch from the six yard line just after the hour. The clincher came in the closing moments after a sobering exhibition of PSG's masterful passing game found the striker unmarked at the back post. Earlier Sunday, Caen continued their fine season by beating Nice 2-0 as the visitors, who sold 49 percent of their shares to a mystery Saudi prince and English businessman this week, failed in their bid to move second. The hosts took the lead when Julien Feret teed up Rony Rodelin to drive in his sixth league goal of the season. Andy Delort doubled the lead from the penalty spot before half-time to leave Nice in disarray. Bordeaux's lanky striker Cheick Diabate, who scored a brace in last week's 2-2 draw with Nantes, grabbed another two in a 4-0 romp over Rennes. His aerial strength saw him power home a well placed header to grab the opener on the half hour and he then drilled a sharp left-footed snap-shot past Rennes 'keeper Benoit Costil just after the restart to make it 2-0, setting his side up for a deservedly clear win. Surprise package Angers inflicted a 3-0 defeat on Monaco on Saturday to reignite their unlikely challenge for a Champions League spot. Cheikh N'Doye deflected in Romain Saiss's effort after Monaco failed to clear a corner, N'Doye doubled the advantage before half-time as Angers took utter control, before gloss was added to the scoreline in the second period by Mohamed Yattara."

And with a yawning 21 point lead it is surely only a matter of when not if they secure a fourth consecutive league title and sixth overall. Blanc cut a contented figure after Wednesday's game, declaring: ""I'm especially happy, because no matter who plays, the team is winning. I congratulate my players."" And it appears that those players are happy in Paris with two players previously expected to leave at the end of this season, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Motta, both now looking to stay. ""I'd like to end my career in Paris,"" Motta told AFP this week, while Ibrahimovic has just accepted a telling and sizeable pay rise. As Chelsea's Champions League visit on February 16 looms the only blemish was the sight of Brazilian defender David Luiz hobbling off in stoppage time with an injured knee. PSG must travel to the Stade Geoffrey-Guichard without their fans who have been banned from attending the game after ""serious incidents between the team's respective fans in recent years"". Saint Etienne, blown away by PSG 4-1 at the Parc des Princes in October, squandered a chance to climb into the top four when they gave up a last minute goal at Reims in last Sunday's 1-1 draw. PSG's League Cup final opponents Lille routed Bordeaux 5-1 in their semi-final and will be out to continue that form at Marseille on Friday. Marseille are six points shy of the top three, with new coach Michel telling AFP: ""A podium finish is our dream, not our objective. ""If last year's side couldn't do it how can people demand of us to do it with fewer players and a smaller budget?"" Second-placed Monaco are at Angers who are dusting themselves off after last weekend's 5-1 drubbing by the runaway league leaders. Monaco's Portuguese trio Bernardo Silva, Fabio Coentrao and Helder Costa were all on target in the Principality side's 4-0 defeat of Toulouse to strengthen their hold on second place. Bastia host former multiple champions Lyon with a change of personnel in the dug out.

The PSG v Lille game will go ahead as planned on February 13 at 1600GMT according to the schedule released on Thursday. PSG coach Laurent Blanc had pleaded last week for a less congested schedule in order to prepare for the game with Chelsea and asked that the game against Lille be put back until either February 23 or 24.

Angel di Maria backed up his excellent brace against Angers on Saturday with a wonderful second goal to put paid to Toulouse hopes. The visitors' misery was compounded late on when substitute Martin Braithwaite had a penalty saved by Nicolas Douchez. The capital city outfit are now just one win away from extending their record haul of five League Cups and will face Lille in the final on April 23 at the Stade de France. PSG coach Laurent Blanc rang the changes from the side that played at the weekend, with seven alterations to the starting lineup in all. It was a rather drab opening 45 minutes in the capital, with a speculative effort off target from PSG midfielder Benjamin Stambouli the closest either side came to breaking the deadlock. Away manager Dominique Arribage though would have been pleased with the way his men kept their more illustrious opponents at arm's length for long periods. PSG though finally ended Toulouse's resistance in the 65th minute as Lavezzi sent out a reminder of his talents with a crucial goal. The Argentine was set clear by an excellent deep pass from Adrien Rabiot that took the visiting defence out of the equation, and he finished at the second attempt after goalkeeper Mauro Goicoechea had kept out his initial effort. Just seven minutes later his compatriot di Maria made it two with a pin-point, swerving shot from distance that gave PSG the breathing space they needed to ease into the final. Braithwaite came off the bench and won an 89th minute penalty when he was brought down by Presnel Kimpembe. But the Danish striker's weak spot-kick was well saved by stand-in goalkeeper Douchez. Although David Luiz hobbled off injured in stoppage time, this was a thoroughly satisfactory day for the French champions."
833,27/01/2016,11:37,"Ibrahimovic gets 700,000 euro pay boost","Paris Saint-Germain's star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been handed a 700,000 euros ($760,000) monthly pay-rise making him by far the highest-paid footballer in France, Le Parisien newspaper reported on Wednesday.","The 34-year-old Swede, who joined the club in 2012 from AC Milan and has scored 127 goals in 156 games since then, now gets 1.5 million euros ($1.1 million) a month before tax under the performance-based hike agreed late last year. On top, Ibrahimovic can pocket three big bonus payments for winning the Champions league, the French league title and and ending the season with the top combined total of goals scored and goal assists. With Paris Saint-Germain currently 21 points clear of second-placed Monaco in the league, the first of those targets is all but certain. Paris go up against Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champion League next month. Le Parisien added, however, that there was no word on whether Ibrahimovic would stay in Paris after his current contract expires at the end of the season. He is on record as saying he has no intention of leaving, claiming he has ""a beautiful relationship with PSG."" Ibrahimovic will be playing in France during the summer as Sweden contest the Euro 2016 finals"
834,25/01/2016,17:35,PSG play Toulouse for place in League Cup final,Paris Saint-Germain continue their quest for a domestic treble on Wednesday when they meet Toulouse for the third time in just eleven days.,"Having already knocked Dominique Arribage's men out of the French Cup and beaten them in the league in the last fortnight, PSG will be looking to complete a quick-fire hat-trick of wins in their League Cup semi-final at the Parc des Princes. Laurent Blanc's side are going for a third successive League Cup success and with the league title all but sealed already, they can afford to focus on the three cup competitions. Blanc opted to make a host of changes for the quarter-final victory over Lyon earlier this month, although it is likely that goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu will miss out on a start this time with doubt still surrounding his future. Edinson Cavani has lost his place in the starting line-up in recent weeks to Lucas Moura, but will probably get a chance to showcase his talents in this tournament. The capital city outfit will be expected to have little trouble in seeing off Toulouse, who are firmly stuck in the relegation zone after suffering a 4-0 thrashing at Monaco on Sunday. PSG dished out a hammering of their own on Saturday as they put five past Angers, with Angel di Maria taking plenty of the plaudits for an excellent brace. The champions elect are 21 points clear in the French top flight with only 16 games remaining, although hopes of a quadruple still appear overly optimistic given the calibre of the teams left in the Champions League knock-out stages. PSG will take on Chelsea in the last 16 of that competition, but for now it is all about the League Cup and improving their record haul of five titles since the inaugural edition in 1994-95. The first semi-final tie though is on Tuesday in Lille when three-time winners Bordeaux make the trip to the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. Willy Sagnol's team are unbeaten in 11 matches in all competitions after a late show rescued an unlikely point against Nantes at the weekend. Lille on the other hand have seen their recent resurgence under new coach Frederic Antonetti stutter. They were dumped out of the French Cup by fourth-tier Trelissac and suffered the ignominy of becoming the first team to lose to Troyes in the league this term. There have been rumours of disharmony in the Lille squad, but Florent Balmont played down the claims. The midfielder said: ""For me the group gets on well even if sometimes there are sparks. ""Obviously we don't always eat together as there is a generation difference. But there is mutual respect."" Despite their two goals in the final seven minutes, Saturday evening also produced a setback for Bordeaux as goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso picked up a knee injury and will be out until next season. Manager Sagnol has confirmed that back-up stopper Jerome Prior will take his place in goal for the rest of the campaign.

835,23/01/2016,19:37,Rampant PSG crush Angers to extend huge lead,Paris Saint-Germain served another reminder of their Ligue 1 supremacy with a thumping 5-1 victory at home to Angers on Saturday that moved the reigning champions 24 points clear at the top.,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic opened the scoring at the Parc des Princes with his 17th league goal of the season before Lucas doubled the lead for Laurent Blanc's side just before half-time. The floodgates then opened after the break with Gregory Van der Wiel rounding off a superb team move for PSG's third, only for Pierrick Capelle to pull one back, but Angel Di Maria then scored twice in the space of four minutes to complete the rout. With Paris still competing in four competitions, the capital club face a fixture backlog that will see them play seven games in three weeks ahead of their Champions League last 16, first leg against Chelsea on February 16. Blanc was without captain Thiago Silva, Marquinhos, Marco Verratti and Javier Pastore through injury but still fielded an imposing line-up, although there was no place for Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani, whose future remains unclear amid reports this week linking him to Manchester United. Angers held Paris to a 0-0 draw when the sides met in December, the last time the capital club dropped points this season and the only occasion in which they have failed to score in Ligue 1 this term. The visitors entered the weekend with the league's second meanest defence, with goalkeeper Alexandre Letellier denying both Van der Wiel and Blaise Matuidi with his feet in the opening half hour. However, there was little the Angers keeper could do on 32 minutes when PSG broke the deadlock through Ibrahimovic, whose low shot from the right side of the area took a slight deflection as it flashed through the legs of Letellier. Di Maria then released Van der Wiel down the right eight minutes later and the Dutchman broke into the box, recovering the ball after an attempted tackle by Romain Thomas, before knocking it back for Lucas to sweep home. Home keeper Kevin Trapp was a spectator for much of the first half, aside from a Thomas header that forced the German to pluck the ball out of the air under heavy pressure inside his six-yard box. The hosts' two-goal lead allowed them to showcase the more expansive side of their game, with PSG's third goal on 54 minutes emanating from a slick interchange between Ibrahimovic and Di Maria before Matuidi's superb volleyed cross was turned in by Van der Wiel at the far post. But Angers continued to battle and reduced the deficit five minutes later as Capelle latched on to a headed clearance and steered a low volley just inside the post. That proved merely a blip on the radar, though, as PSG reasserted their dominance with a fourth goal on 63 minutes when a tumbling Lucas scooped the ball back to Di Maria and the Argentine brilliantly fired past Letellier on the volley from outside the box. Di Maria struck again moments later after he was put through by Matuidi and he once more produced a high-quality finish, chipping over the advancing Letellier to round out an 11th straight win in all competitions. On Sunday, second-placed Monaco are at home to relegation-threatened Toulouse, while two struggling giants meet at the brand new Parc OL as Lyon host Marseille. On Friday, Rennes made a winning start under new coach Rolland Courbis as Roderic Filippi's late own goal saw them beat Gazelec Ajaccio 1-0, ending the visitors' 11-game unbeaten league run."
836,22/01/2016,02:15,Ibrahimovic hits form as PSG tackle game glut,"Runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain host third-placed Angers in Ligue 1 on Saturday, with star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic in towering form as a series of eight games in three weeks awaits the French champions.","Elsewhere, Marseille's visit to Lyon is a clash of struggling giants on Sunday, and on Friday new Rennes boss Rolland Courbis hopes to give his new team a first home win since August. A massive 21 points ahead of second-placed Monaco, PSG's midweek French Cup win delivered by a late Ibrahimovic goal means Laurent Blanc will be rotating his line-up in their seven scheduled games before Chelsea's visit in the Champions League on February 16. ""We have to get through this month of January, which is difficult with this crazy schedule,"" Blanc said after the come-from-behind 2-1 home win over Toulouse. On current form it is hard to imagine PSG allowing Ibrahimovic, whose contract expires in June, to leave at the end of the season. The Swede took his club goal tally in all competitions to 20 in midweek, but he is also the leader of the team, dictating matters on the pitch and also ruling the roost in the dressing room. So the Swede will start at the weekend while Edinson Cavani, linked with a switch to Manchester United this week and increasingly isolated both on the pitch and off it, may make way for Brazilian forward Lucas. ""Rotating the team all the time is making PSG a little sluggish,"" former France and Liverpool coach Gerard Houllier told sports daily L'Equipe this week, before praising the club's fitness coaches as the reason why PSG were hurting rivals in the latter stages of games. ""They are aiming at being ready by March and they've got real experts in the fitness domain,"" said Houllier. However, PSG have several stars in the sickbay in Thiago Silva, Marquinhos, Javier Pastore and Marco Verratti. Visitors Angers tumbled out of the Cup on Tuesday with a 2-1 home deafeat to Bordeaux. Marseille and Lyon are in eighth and ninth respectively. Lyon, runners up last season, fired their coach at Christmas while Marseille's incumbent Michel has been being booed by home fans lately. The former Spain international will be looking for Belgian striker Mishy Batshuayi, second only to Ibrahimovic in the Ligue 1 scoring charts, to add to his 12 league goals. Marseille can also build upon the momentum of a midweek home win in the Cup over Montpellier, following last Sunday's 3-1 victory at Caen. ""It's going to be a huge game in their brand new stadium, but it's nice to travel up there on the back of a win,"" Marseille midfielder Remy Cabella told regional paper La Provence. Rennes sacked their coach Philippe Montanier on Wednesday, and his replacement Courbis immediately promised to target second place. ""First place is mathematically out of the question, so why not go for it and target second,"" suggested the colourful 62-year-old journeyman, who has inherited a Rennes side just five points off second place but without a home win in their last ten attempts. Courbis will get the chance to turn around the Brittany outfit's fortunes with a home fixture against surprise package Gazelec Ajaccio, who are unbeaten in their last 11 league games. Relegation-threatened Toulouse, who face PSG for the third time in 11 days next week, first turn their attentions to resurgent Monaco, who moved back ahead of Angers after stretching their unbeaten run in the league to eight games last time out.

837,16/01/2016,19:12,Ibrahimovic hands PSG slender victory at Toulouse,"Not for the first time, Paris Saint-Germain were grateful to Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the Swede's second-half goal secured a 1-0 win away to Toulouse in Ligue 1 on Saturday.","It was far from a vintage performance from the champions and relegation-threatened Toulouse were unlucky not to take anything from the game on the day their refurbished stadium was officially inaugurated before a full house of around 33,000. Ibrahimovic converted from close range in the 73rd minute after David Luiz had helped on a Lucas corner to give PSG their ninth consecutive win in all competitions and allow them to extend their enormous lead at the top of the table to 23 points from Angers in second. Laurent Blanc's side are still undefeated in domestic competition this season and this result allowed them to extend their club record unbeaten run in the league to 30 matches going back to last March. Toulouse remain in the relegation zone but they had lost just once in nine outings before this game and they will at least have been buoyed by their display in the first of three meetings with the capital side in quick succession. Dominique Arribage's team travel to Paris on French Cup duty on Tuesday evening and then go back to the Parc des Princes in the semi-finals of the League Cup on January 27. PSG were missing the injured Thiago Silva and Angel di Maria due to injury and their afternoon did not get off to the best of starts as Javier Pastore -- starting a league game for the first time since October -- hobbled off with an apparent calf problem to be replaced by Edinson Cavani in the 18th minute. Toulouse were the better team in the first half and their leading scorer Wisam Ben Yedder, fresh from netting eight times in five games, came closest to breaking the deadlock, lashing a shot off the bar from 12 yards. His free-kick then came to nothing after Marquinhos had brought down Tongo Hamed Doumbia right on the edge of the penalty area. Marquinhos also came off hurt on the hour mark, making way for Gregory van der Wiel, but Paris started to threaten and Ibrahimovic teed up Lucas Moura to fire just wide. Ibrahimovic finally got the breakthrough soon after, beating Toulouse's 16-year-old goalkeeper Alban Lafont to score his 16th league goal of the season, all of which have come in his last 14 games. Such a scoring run would have impressed Just Fontaine, the France striking great who was present at Le Stadium to help unveil a stand that will carry his name. On Friday, Angers lost 2-1 at Nice, who moved above Cote d'Azur rivals Monaco into third as two late penalties by Hatem Ben Arfa turned the game around after Pierrick Capelle's first-half opener. Monaco can go second and trim PSG's lead to a mere 21 points with a win at Lorient on Sunday before Saint-Etienne host Lyon in the Rhone-Alpes derby."

""You have to work hard in January, the weather conditions may not be great,"" coach Blanc warned after their latest outing, a 2-0 league win over Bastia. ""There are heavy legs in January but we have big goals for February, March, April and May,"" said Blanc, whose side are also targeting the Champions League and face Chelsea in the last-16.

And two first half goals moved them 22 points clear of Monaco and maintained their unbeaten record in all domestic competitions since last March. Bastia turned up sitting just three points clear of the relegation zone but having only lost just one of their last six games. As for their well-heeled hosts PSG had laboured to a 1-0 victory against fourth-tier minnows Wasquehal in the French Cup last weekend. Blanc elected to start Brazilian winger Lucas Moura instead of Edinson Cavani and Kevin Trapp in goal. For Bastia, Brazilian Brandao was making his return to the Parc des Princes where in 2014 he headbutted Motta for which he picked up a six month ban. The visitors began brightly but as the half hour approached PSG's Angel Di Maria sent in a corner from the right with Bastia's bumbling defence allowing Thiago Silva's header to be nudged over the line by Motta. Argentine star Di Maria was at the heart of the hosts' second goal ten minutes later, helping to set up left-back Maxwell to fire an angled shot into the Bastia netting.

Laurent Blanc's side have not lost domestically since March last year and few will give Bastia a chance of ending that statistic in the capital, where Paris have been especially strong. The Corsicans sit just three points clear of the relegation zone but they have lost just one of their last six games, while PSG laboured to a 1-0 victory against fourth-tier minnows Wasquehal in the French Cup last weekend. ""It was one of our most difficult matches this season. Different qualities are required to win games like thse,"" said Paris goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu, who is a fitness doubt for this weekend, although Kevin Trapp is likely to start in goal with the Italian being tipped to leave the club this month. The return to fitness of Javier Pastore means Blanc has a near fully-fit squad to choose from now and the likes of Angel di Maria, Edinson Cavani and Thiago Silva are set to return here after being rested last weekend. Bastia welcome back skipper Yannick Cahuzac after he missed last week's French Cup win at Sedan due to suspension, while Guinea forward Francois Kamano has returned to training after three months out with a fractured metatarsal. Saturday will be an historic day for Lyon as they open their new 59,000-seat stadium against bottom club Troyes. The ground in Lyon's eastern suburbs will be one of the venues for Euro 2016 and while most clubs in France rent stadiums from local authorities, Lyon have funded it themselves. It cost 450 million euros (£331 million; $484 million) but Lyon are hoping it can generate 70-100 million euros per year and therefore help them compete with the very best clubs in Europe once again. ""That is why we began this adventure in the first place. When we started thinking about it at the beginning of the last decade, we were the champions of France and selling out every match,"" said Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas. The current state of the Lyon side is a concern to fans with last season's runners-up languishing in ninth place at the halfway stage. Their poor form cost coach Hubert Fournier his job and Bruno Genesio has replaced him after being promoted from his backroom role. Genesio's first game was the 7-0 Cup win against minnows Limoges and nothing less than a victory will do against a Troyes side who prop up the division having failed to win a league game all season. One man who will not feature for Lyon is Serbian defender Milan Bisevac, who has left the club to join Serie A side Lazio. Second over the winter break, Monaco are at home to Gazelec Ajaccio and will be without the suspended Lacina Traore after the giant striker scored four goals and was then sent off in a 10-2 Cup win against Saint-Jean-Beaulieu. Third-placed Angers host Caen having been weakened by the sales of Razza Camara and goalkeeper Ludovic Butelle to Derby County and Club Brugge respectively. Yoann Gourcuff could make his first appearance since returning to first club Rennes in Saturday's Brittany derby against Lorient, while Montpellier's first league game under the new management team of Pascal Baills and Bruno Martini will be against Bordeaux.

At a joint press conference with Inter coach Roberto Mancini, Blanc said: ""A season is judged on every trophy there is to win. ""In France last year we had a perfect season but quite rightly the expectation for a club of our size is to have a big performance in the Champions League. ""To be good in the Champions League, you have to be good in the league. It's easy to say we need to qualify for the semi-finals, but harder to achieve. ""I believe my players are ready to reach that goal this year, however."" PSG have qualified for the last 16 of the tournament where they will play English champions Chelsea for the third successive season. Chelsea triumphed in 2014 but PSG gained revenge in last season's competition, before being knocked out by eventual winners Barcelona. PSG last reached the semi-finals in 1994/95, inspired by the tournament's top scorer that season, George Weah. They were eventually beaten by AC Milan. The Parisians have reached the last eight of the tournament in the preceding three seasons. Blanc added that some players might leave during January but refused to speculate. ""I don't have to answer you on this specific topic as we came here to talk about tomorrow's game against Inter. We didn't come here for the market."" Inter have been linked to PSG winger Ezequiel Lavezzi and the coach of the Italian league leaders Mancini joked that the two sides could talk after the game. Lavezzi, along with other South American stars who play for PSG, arrived in Doha on Tuesday, two days later than the rest of the side. Mancini added that his team would be taking the friendly seriously. ""Tomorrow we'll play against Paris Saint-Germain. It is one of the top teams in Europe at the moment but I think that there is one game. Inter-PSG, I think that is a good game."" The match has caught the imagination of the Qatari public and is a rare sell-out at the 15,000 Jassim Bin Hamad stadium in Doha. The stadium is home to Al Sadd, the team for which former Barcelona legend Xavi Hernandez now plays."

""We have high objectives and we do want the second part of the season to be great,"" he told reporters after a 90-minute training session in the Qatari capital. ""We started really well, breaking a record but we want to break more with the league and, of course, with the champions league our goal is to go as far as we can."" However he added: ""There's a big game waiting for us."" PSG have drawn English champions Chelsea for the third season in a row in the Champions League. Chelsea triumphed in 2014 but PSG gained revenge in last season's competition, before being knocked out by eventual winners Barcelona. This time PSG will start as clear favourites not only because of their irresistible form but because the English champions have been dismal all season, losing nine matches and currently sit 15th in the English Premier League before the latest matches later on Monday. PSG's Qatari owners hope the summer signing of Argentina winger Angel Di Maria from Manchester United can help propel them further in 2016, with president Nasser Al-Khelaifi declaring: ""We are close to our dream."" The matches take place in February and March. In France, the league is all but won. PSG sit a massive 19 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 at the halfway mark of the season with 51 points, a record for the French league. They have won 16, drawn three and remain unbeaten. Among the records the Parisians have a chance of breaking is for the most points in a Ligue 1 season -- the current high is 89 held by PSG -- and the most games unbeaten, which currently stands at 32, set 20 years ago by Nantes. Midfielder Matuidi has just been named French footballer of the year 2015 by France Football magazine and said he was ""really happy"" about the award. ""It's a real honour. I was voted in by former award recipients so I'm really happy about that. I'm very proud,"" said the 28-year-old. PSG will play Italian league leaders Inter Milan in a friendly in Qatar on Wednesday before heading back to France. Training on Monday took place in temperatures of around 22 degrees Celsius (71 Fahrenheit). Among the players taking part were Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Verrati. The session was overseen by coach Laurent Blanc. The Italian side arrived in Doha on Monday morning."

""If Ibrahimovic is still active, then I want to buy him right away. He is a magnificent physical specimen, so it's entirely possible,"" Beckham said. ""Who does not want a man who is prepared to kill to win?"" Beckham and Ibrahimovic were teammates in the English midfielder's final days as a professional player with the French club. Beckham has found a stadium site in Miami after years of struggles and told the newspaper construction of a venue ""will take three years, maybe two."" Ibrahimovic, 34, could be nearing the end but still might be just what Beckham is looking for to jump start his new club. ""I've played with or against the very best in the world. I have never met anyone who was so serious during both practice and games,"" Beckham said of Zlatan. ""When I came to Paris I knew that he was an incomparable talent as a player, but he'd be so tough and merciless on himself at all times, I had no idea. He's a born winner. He is a beast with huge self-confidence and I'm one of his biggest admirers."""

PSG won 3-0 at fourth-placed Caen on Saturday to set a new record of 51 points at the halfway stage of the season after an unbeaten first 19 matches during the current campaign. PSG also set a club-record 28-match unbeaten league run after expensive stars Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Angel di Maria both hit the target in Caen. Monaco are second after a 0-0 draw at winless and rock bottom Troyes on Saturday took them a point clear of Angers. St Etienne moved up to sixth, just three points behind Monaco in the congested race for the European places. Later on Sunday, 2009 champions Bordeaux host the team that succeeded them a year later, Marseille, in an era before Qatari money helped PSG sweep all before them."
850,20/12/2015,02:16,PSG dominate as off-field matters overshadow French game,"French football was dominated by Paris Saint-Germain in 2015, but the game in the country has regularly been overshadowed by affairs off the field over the last 12 months.","PSG won an unprecedented clean sweep of the domestic trophies last season and have enjoyed a record-breaking first half to the current campaign that has seen them open up an enormous lead at the top of Ligue 1. The only teams to beat Laurent Blanc's side since March have been Barcelona and Real Madrid, both in the Champions League. They had equalled the club record for their longest unbeaten sequence in the top flight of 27 games - and set a new Ligue 1 winter break points record of 51 with a win in their final match of the year in Caen. Meanwhile, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the dominant personality in the French game, wrote his name firmly into the history books by passing Pauleta's club record tally of 109 goals in all competitions when he scored a brace in a 2-1 win for Paris over bitter rivals Marseille in October. But where Paris again fell short was in the Champions League -- they made the continent sit up and take notice when they beat Chelsea last season only to fall to eventual winners Barca in the quarter-finals. The club's Qatari owners hope the summer signing of Argentina winger Angel Di Maria from Manchester United can help propel them further in 2016, with president Nasser Al-Khelaifi declaring: ""We are close to our dream."" They can focus all their energies on that competition because their rivals at home cannot keep up. Lyon pushed them almost all the way in the title race last season, with Alexandre Lacazette and Nabil Fekir being named France's player and young player of the year respectively. However, with Fekir now out injured long term, they are struggling awfully this season. Monaco's performance in reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League was laudible but they continue to sell their best players -- including Anthony Martial to Manchester United -- undermining their chances of genuine on-field success in the process. Marseille, meanwhile, continue to lament the shock departure of enigmatic Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa in August. Lyon played their final game at their old Stade de Gerland in December and will move into an impressive new 59,000-seat stadium early in the new year. The French footballing landscape is changing and Bordeaux took up residence in a new stadium of their own earlier this year as France gears up for Euro 2016. The finals could mark the dawn of a new era for the game in France after an often difficult last few months. This is a country still raw from the terror attacks in and around Paris that left 130 people dead, and the national sport was one of the targets on that night of November 13. Before the full scale of what was happening became clear, three loud explosions emanated from directly outside the Stade de France during France's 2-0 win over Germany in a friendly. The game carried on in a surreal atmosphere and only later did it become clear that the explosions were suicide bomb attacks. It also later transpired that the France midfielder Lassana Diarra's cousin was among the victims as carnage took hold elsewhere in Paris. ""We are all proud to be French and what's happened will leave a mark on all of us,"" admitted the France coach Didier Deschamps. Those events led to serious concerns about the hosting of a major tournament so soon afterwards, but any suggestions the European Championship will be moved elsewhere were quickly dismissed. Meanwhile, two figures have continued to hog the headlines in the closing weeks of the year. While legendary former player and UEFA president Michel Platini has been tangled up in the scandal engulfing FIFA, star striker Karim Benzema was charged by police and sidelined from the national side due to a blackmail affair involving a sex-tape and his team-mate Mathieu Valbuena. Both stories threaten to run on and on well into 2016."
851,19/12/2015,20:06,Ibrahimovic wondergoal as PSG break points record,Paris Saint-Germain go into the winter break with a Ligue 1 record points haul of 51 after a 3-0 away win at Caen lit up by a thrilling Zlatan Ibrahimovic strike on Saturday.,"Already 1-0 up from an early Angel di Maria goal Ibrahimovic produced a stunning 25-yard snap-shot which flew into the top corner of the Caen goal on 36 minutes. As the stadium rose to acclaim the giant Swede for the simple power and precision of his split-second effort, even the beaten 'keeper was left smiling. The win lifted PSG to a massive 20 points clear of Angers, in action on Sunday at Saint-Etienne. It also extends the star-studded Qatar-backed club's unbeaten record in the league to 28 games since March. ""This calendar year, 2015, has been a really, really good year for PSG,"" said coach Laurent Blanc. ""But halfway through the season, records don't mean much to me,"" he warned. Summer-signing Di Maria rounded off the scoring with his sixth Ligue 1 goal since joining from Manchester United, making it 3-0 as he rounded off a slick team effort on 50 minutes. ""I was happy with the way many of the players, whose minds were on the long trips most of them were about to make. But you saw how they played, right from the off,"" said Blanc. Caen 'keeper Remy Vercoutre deserves a special mention himself after saving four stinging shots in a bewildering first-half goalmouth scramble, two of them spectacular stops with the feet from Lucas Moura and Ibrahimovic. Not to be outdone PSG's German 'keeper Kevin Trapp then saved an 84th minute penalty from Caen's Andy Delort as the champions shone in every area against a side who went into the game in fourth place. Third-place Monaco end a turbulent 2015 at Troyes later Saturday, with the bottom club still looking for a first win of the season. Among the other fixtures is a Brittany derby between Guingamp, who are in the relegation zone, and a Rennes side with just one win in their last 13 league games. Marseille will look to end a difficult year on a high note when they visit Bordeaux on Sunday night in the last match before France takes a two-week winter break over the festive period. On Friday teenager Olivier Boscagli sent Nice into the French winter break on a winning note as he struck the only goal in a 1-0 victory at home to Montpellier."
852,19/12/2015,11:15,Qatari owner blasts 'well-behaved' PSG fans,"Owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi has hit out at Paris Saint-Germain's fans for being too ""well-behaved"" in an interview published on Saturday.","Speaking to Le Figaro newspaper, the Qatari billionaire said he wants the club's supporters to make more noise in cheering on their dominant heroes at the Parc des Princes. ""We need more atmosphere in the stadium. Sometimes our fans are a bit too well-behaved,"" moaned Al-Khelaifi. ""We give our time, our heart, our passion for the fans. I'd like them to be constantly behind us, from the first minute to the last."" Before Al-Khelaifi took control of PSG in 2011, the Parisians had endured serious problems from violent hooligan groups that more often fought amongst themselves than with those ultras of rival teams. Al-Khelaifi even supported the supporter pacification process begun in 2010 by his predecessor, aimed at rooting out the violent, but noisy, hooligan groups, a move which saw the Boulogne Boys and Tigris Mystic disbanded along with several other notorious groups. In the interview, Al-Khelaifi also ruled out bringing in new faces during the January transfer window. ""Our team is very strong, therefore we won't need new players; we need every player (already) in this team, so we won't be selling anyone,"" he added. Going into Saturday's trip to Caen, PSG are 17 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 and unbeaten in a club record-equalling 27 league matches. The owner said he wanted to keep coach Laurent Blanc at the Parc and that he was looking to extend the former France boss' contract, suggesting he is not in the market to hire Jose Mourinho, who was sacked by Chelsea on Thursday. However, Al-Khelaifi was less concrete on the future of star forward and record PSG goalscorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, whose contract runs out at the end of the season. ""He puts his heart into this club. We'll discuss in February what he wants to do,"" said Al-Khelaifi of the 34-year-old Swede."
853,18/12/2015,02:10,PSG target more records as Lyon seek seasonal cheer,Paris Saint-Germain have more records in sight as they play their final game of 2015 at Caen in Ligue 1 on Saturday evening.,"Laurent Blanc's side can set a new mark for the most points halfway through a French season by winning in Normandy, while avoiding defeat will be enough for them to set a new record for the longest unbeaten run in the club's top-flight history. PSG are an enormous 17 points clear of nearest challengers Angers and a win at the Stade Michel-d'Ornano will take them into Christmas on 51 points, one more than the previous best tally at this stage set by Lyon in their pomp nine years ago. The capital club's 5-1 win at home to a struggling Lyon side last weekend allowed them to extend their unbeaten record in the league to 27 games since March as they matched their previous best sequence set back in 1993-94. They have not lost a domestic game at all this season, although they did struggle to break down a young Saint-Etienne team in the League Cup in midweek before Edinson Cavani struck late on to clinch a 1-0 win. The task facing Caen is a huge one, even if the Normandy side are enjoying an excellent campaign themselves and are certain to end the calendar year in the top four. ""Paris are one of the best sides in Europe. We will need to be at 200 percent to stand a chance of getting a result,"" said the Caen left-back Chaker Alhadhur. Angers, who have gone five games unbeaten, are in action on Sunday at Saint-Etienne, a side struggling for form but still in touch with the European places. And, after seven losses in their last 11 league outings, Les Verts coach Christophe Galtier was encouraged by the performance of a team containing six players aged 21 or under at kick-off against PSG on Wednesday. ""For the youngsters, such a match is worth 20 or 25 games for the reserves. They acquired a lot of experience,"" said Galtier. Third-place Monaco, eliminated from the League Cup this week, end a turbulent 2015 at Troyes, the bottom club still looking for a first win of the season. Nice, in fifth, entertain Montpellier in the Friday night game as they seek a first win in six matches, while Lyon face Gazelec Ajaccio in Corsica in what could prove to be OL coach Hubert Fournier's final match in charge, regardless of the result. Lyon have collected a solitary point from their last five outings, jeopardising their chances of returning to the Champions League next season just as they prepare to move into a new 59,000-seat stadium in January. Gazelec have themselves turned their fortunes around in spectacular fashion after a disastrous start to life in the top flight and the unglamorous surroundings of the Stade Ange-Casanova will not be an easy place for Lyon to get back to winning ways. ""There is no problem in terms of desire, but many of the players have lost confidence,"" admitted Fournier after a narrow 2-1 win against second-tier Tours in the League Cup on Wednesday in the last ever game at the old Stade de Gerland. ""It is time the year came to an end, although we have one last push to come in Ajaccio."" Among the other fixtures is a Brittany derby between Guingamp, who are in the relegation zone, and a Rennes side with just one win in their last 13 league games. Marseille will look to end a difficult year on a high note when they visit Bordeaux on Sunday night in the last match before France takes a two-week winter break over the festive period.

854,15/12/2015,15:37,Chelsea tie too tough to call for PSG coach Blanc,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc refuses to see his side as favourites to beat Chelsea in their Champions League last 16 tie despite the contrasting form of the two teams.,"PSG beat Chelsea on away goals at the same stage of last season's Champions League and their only defeats in their last 39 games have come against Barcelona and Real Madrid. They sit a huge 17 points clear at the top of Ligue 1, while Chelsea are a lowly 16th in the Premier League, only one point above the relegation zone after Monday's defeat at Leicester City. ""This time it will be 50/50. Although we beat them the last time, these are still two strong, ambitious clubs,"" Blanc said on Tuesday. ""February is not so far away, but there is nothing to say that Chelsea will still be in the same position, and nothing to say that we will be in the same form as we are now."" The draw could have been better for PSG, but it could also have been worse with Barcelona and Bayern Munich among their possible opponents after they finished second in their group. ""No coach says to himself that he has an easy draw. We need to analyse it. By finishing second in our group we had some big teams to avoid. Here we will be coming up against a fine team who have already won the Champions League,"" Blanc added. ""Preparing for the game will be the only easy thing. The two teams have not changed much and know each other well."" Blanc was speaking before Paris begin their defence of the French League Cup with a last 16 tie at home to Saint-Etienne on Wednesday."
855,14/12/2015,19:19,PSG weighing options as League Cup defence begins,Paris Saint-Germain will consider their priorities as they begin the defence of their French League Cup crown when they host Saint-Etienne in the last 16 on Wednesday.,"The record five-time winners extended their unbeaten start to the domestic season with a 5-1 rout of Lyon on Sunday that stretched PSG's lead at the top of Ligue 1 to an enormous 17 points. Last season PSG won a clean sweep of domestic trophies, which included a 4-0 thrashing of Bastia in the League Cup final, but their hunger for Champions League glory this term could impact their fortunes in the domestic cups. PSG were paired with Chelsea in the draw for the last 16 on Monday, the third straight year the sides have met in the knockout phase, with Blanc saying back in September that the capital club may have to ""let go"" of one of the domestic competitions to prioritise Europe. ""We will try to manage training sessions, workloads and rotations, but we will maybe need to let go of one of the national cup competitions, or at least not put everything into them. Even if that will be difficult,"" Blanc admitted earlier this season. Saint-Etienne handed PSG their last defeat in this tournament, overcoming the Parisians 5-3 on penalties in the 2012-13 quarter-finals en route to lifting the title, but their recent form is poor with Christophe Galtier's men sliding to an eighth league defeat of the season at the weekend. The rest of the Ligue 1 clubs competing in Europe this term also enter the field in midweek with a pair of former three-time winners, Bordeaux and Marseille, taking on Monaco and second-tier Bourg en Bresse respectively. Meanwhile, Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas confirmed Hubert Fournier would remain as coach at least until the winter break as last year's Ligue 1 runners-up have struggled mightily of late, picking up just one point from a possible 15. They host second-tier Tours in the last-ever match at the Stade de Gerland before moving into their new 59,000-capacity stadium in January. On Tuesday, resurgent Lille, winners of straight three straight league games under new coach Frederic Antonetti, host second-tier Laval, Guingamp face Nice, with Rennes at home to Toulouse and Lorient taking on Ligue 2 high-flyers Dijon."
856,13/12/2015,23:07,Five-star PSG punish Lyon to extend enormous lead,Zlatan Ibrahimovic took his tally to 14 goals in his last 11 Ligue 1 games as Paris Saint-Germain outclassed Lyon 5-1 on a gloomy Sunday night in the French capital.,"Ibrahimovic and Serge Aurier both netted in the first 17 minutes for Laurent Blanc's side before a shocking error by goalkeeper Kevin Trapp allowed Jordan Ferri to pull one back for Lyon. However, Edinson Cavani restored PSG's two-goal advantage after the restart and Ibrahimovic got his second of the night from a penalty. Substitute Lucas added the fifth in stoppage time as PSG moved a scarcely credible 17 points clear of their nearest challengers Angers and Monaco with the campaign just 18 games old. PSG are now unbeaten in 27 Ligue 1 games, a run going back to March, and remain on course to break the record for the most points halfway through a French season. The great Lyon team of the last decade had 50 points at the mid-way stage in 2006/07, but Paris already have 48 points and so can set a new mark with a victory at Caen in their last game of the year. This was a meeting of the reigning champions and the team that pushed them the furthest in the title race last season, but Lyon are a shadow of their old selves and were deprived of a host of key players at the Parc des Princes, including the injured Alexandre Lacazette. Visiting goalkeeper Anthony Lopes had already saved from Ibrahimovic and Cavani before the Swede opened the scoring 11 minutes in when Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, rather than clear, headed Thiago Silva's long ball into his path. Six minutes after that Paris struck again, Aurier gratefully heading in from close range after a brilliant dead-ball delivery from the left by Angel Di Maria. Lyon were given hope when Ferri let fly from almost 30 yards and Trapp, attempting to tip the shot over, only succeeded in helping the ball into the net. The German was ironically cheered by the home fans whenever he got the ball after that and the goal did lift the away side. Nevertheless, there was a gulf in class between the teams and PSG scored again just after the hour mark, Cavani turning in another Di Maria cross to score for the 10th time in Ligue 1 this season. Ibrahimovic then struck again inside the final quarter of an hour, beating Lopes from the spot to score for the 14th time in his last 11 appearances after going down under a Henri Bedimo challenge in the box. The fifth goal came on the break in stoppage time, Di Maria again with the assist and Lucas, always so effective coming off the bench, with the finish. Lyon are sixth in the table and have now gone five Ligue 1 games without a win as the pressure on coach Hubert Fournier refuses to subside. Angers came from behind to draw 1-1 with Bordeaux as Romain Thomas cancelled out the opener from Diego Rolan, and they are ahead of Monaco only on goal difference. The principality club moved into the top three for the first time since the opening weekend of the season as a late Fabinho penalty gave them a 1-0 win against Saint-Etienne, who had Kevin Malcuit sent off. ""It was a positive match. We controlled the opposition and they didn't have many chances,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. Meanwhile, Marseille are now seven home league games without a win after a 1-1 draw with Gazelec Ajaccio at the Stade Velodrome. Jacques Zoua put the Corsicans in front from the penalty spot but Michy Batshuayi equalised before half-time with his 11th league goal of the season before OM had Abdelaziz Barrada sent off."
857,08/12/2015,23:01,Ibrahimovic breaks record as PSG stroll,Zlatan Ibrahimovic set another record as Paris Saint-Germain finished their Champions League pool phase on a positive note in beating Shakhtar Donetsk 2-0 at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.,"Brazilian Lucas Moura broke the deadlock on 57 minutes before record goalscorer Ibrahimovic set the seal on their group A victory with the second four minutes from time. But with Real Madrid thumping Malmo 8-0 in Spain, PSG finished three points back in second and risk a tough draw in the last 16 where the likes of champions Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City lurk. The main bonus for Paris was seeing Ibrahimovic break another record, becoming the club's top goalscorer of all time in European competitions, eclipsing Liberian great George Weah with his 17th strike. That ensured a party atmosphere in the French capital despite Ibrahimovic's finish from Lucas's pass more dribbling into the net rather than bursting it. It had otherwise been an insipid performance from the French champions, whose qualification for the last 16 as group runners-up had already been assured two weeks ago with a 5-0 win at Malmo. The fans were briefly awakened by Lucas's rasping drive just before the hour mark to open the scoring. What will most be occupying the minds of PSG supporters now, though, is Monday's knock-out stage draw in Nyon, Switzerland."
858,07/12/2015,17:50,Luiz targets deep run in Europe with PSG,Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz said on Monday the French champions must show they are serious European contenders by reaching the latter stages of this season's Champions League.,"PSG have already qualified for the knockout phase as runners-up behind Real Madrid in Group A and host Shakhtar Donetsk at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday in the final round of matches. However, after three straight quarter-final exits Brazilian defender Luiz insisted Laurent Blanc's men need to go further in this year's competition. ""We are stronger (than last season). But it's not easy to win the Champions League and face the best teams. If we don't get past the quarter-finals, we can say we haven't progressed -- we have to go further,"" Luiz told a press conference. ""The experience we've gathered, the stability of the squad, with the players who are here, are the reasons we are better than last season. ""We work well together, we've had a good start, but the start counts for little, it's the end that matters,"" the Brazilian underlined. PSG have swept aside all-comers domestically, opening up a 15-point lead at the top of Ligue 1, but face the possibility of coming up against Barcelona or Bayern Munich in the last 16 when the draw is made at UEFA headquarters in Nyon next Monday. And Blanc, whose men will finish behind Madrid even if they end on the same numbers of points, admitted he hoped his team were not made to regret a 1-0 defeat at the Santiago Bernabeu when PSG were left to rue a host of missed chances. ""I hope we won't regret the draw,"" said the Frenchman. ""Not getting a positive result (in Spain) is a huge regret."""
859,04/12/2015,22:50,PSG crush Nice as Ibrahimovic makes more history,Zlatan Ibrahimovic set up one goal and notched two more to break yet another scoring record as Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain crushed 10-man Nice 3-0 on Friday.,"Edinson Cavani got the opener for PSG at the Allianz Riviera before Nice had Niklas Hult sent off for conceding a penalty that Ibrahimovic scored just before half-time. That was his 86th Ligue 1 goal, allowing him to pass Mustapha Dahleb and go out on his own as PSG's all-time top scorer in the top flight of French football. For good measure, the Swede scored again in the second half to secure the victory that puts Laurent Blanc's defending champions provisionally 16 points clear of second-placed Caen at the top of the table. ""We knew that record was going to fall. It was just a case of when, because he scores an enormous amount of goals and will continue to do so,"" Paris coach Laurent Blanc told beIN Sports. PSG are still unbeaten in Ligue 1 this season after 17 games and have not lost domestically since March, with only Barcelona and Real Madrid getting the better of them in the Champions League in that time. The capital side had slipped up in midweek with a goalless draw at Angers and this was tipped to be one of their toughest tests of the campaign against a Nice team who lay fifth and had been scoring freely thanks to the influence of Hatem Ben Arfa. The former Newcastle United winger was back in the Nice side after illness and almost put the hosts ahead on the half-hour mark when he turned away from Benjamin Stambouli before letting fly from 25 yards, only for his shot to flash just over the bar. Five minutes after that PSG took the lead, Ibrahimovic collecting possession outside the box, playing a one-two with Blaise Matuidi and then squaring for Cavani to roll in. The game was then ended as a contest a minute before the break when Nice were reduced to 10 men, Hult receiving a straight red for bringing down his fellow Swede Ibrahimovic in the area. Ibrahimovic stepped up to score the resulting penalty and break the record of Dahleb, an Algerian who played for Paris in the 1970s and 1980s. Already the club's all-time leading scorer and top scorer in European competition, it was another record for the 34-year-old, who has helped transform Paris since signing from AC Milan in 2012. Just for good measure, he got his second of the night just after the hour mark with a low finish at the near post from an Angel Di Maria assist. That took him to 12 Ligue 1 goals for the campaign, making him the top scorer in France's top flight this season, one ahead of Lorient's Benjamin Moukandjo. It also raised the question of whether PSG will be tempted to offer him a new deal when his existing contract expires next summer. ""He has been, is and will perhaps continue to be capital in the project of the club. I think Thiago Silva, Thiago Motta and Ibrahimovic are the emblems of this PSG team,"" said Blanc. Second-placed Caen host Lille on Saturday after Lyon entertain Angers in what will be their final Ligue 1 game at the Stade de Gerland before they move into a new stadium in January."
860,01/12/2015,21:36,Angers frustrate PSG in dour draw,Paris Saint-Germain's nine-match winning run in Ligue 1 was brought to a halt on Tuesday as they were held to a 0-0 draw away to promoted Angers.,"The reigning champions dropped points for just the third time this season after being unable to break down the division's tightest defence behind that of their own at the Stade Jean Bouin. The result left PSG on 42 points from 16 matches but still 14 points clear of nearest challengers Caen, who visit Monaco on Wednesday, with Angers one point further back in third. With six games in a 19-day stretch leading up to the winter break, PSG coach Laurent Blanc has made no secret of his desire to rotate his squad. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who drew level with Mustapha Dahleb's club-record 85 top-flight goals over the weekend, dropped to the bench while Serge Aurier made his first league start since October in defence. Blaise Matuidi also returned to the side after being used as a substitute in Saturday's 4-1 win over Troyes, while Adrien Rabiot again kept his place in midfield after impressing in recent weeks. PSG were bidding to stretch their unbeaten league run to 25 games and nearly grabbed a fifth-minute lead when Edinson Cavani connected with a corner, only for the Uruguayan's glancing header to bounce back off the near post. Aurier then forced Angers goalkeeper Ludovic Butelle, who had kept nine clean sheets in 15 appearances prior to Tuesday, into a sharp save with a fierce angled drive. But the home side were again rescued by the woodwork on 33 minutes when Angel Di Maria weaved his way in from the right side of the penalty area before seeing his curling left-footed strike smack against the far post. Angers also struck the frame of the goal when a looping header from Romain Saiss dropped onto the top of the crossbar and bounced over, although PSG keeper Kevin Trapp appeared to have it covered. The hosts went even closer three minutes into the second half when skipper Cheikh Ndoye rose to meet a corner, but Trapp made a fine stop from point-blank range to thwart the Senegalese midfielder. Saiss again caused trouble from a set-piece, this time at his own end, as he flicked a cross towards his own goal with Butelle doing well to turn it over. Ibrahimovic replaced Lucas Moura on 71 minutes but PSG were still unable to find a way past Butelle who clawed away Rabiot's low strike late on that was destined for the bottom corner to preserve a hard-earned point for Angers. Nice missed the chance to leapfrog Angers into third when they were held to a 0-0 draw at mid-table Lorient."

Thomas Ayasse got one back for the away side but the win for Paris means they are still unbeaten domestically this season and are so far clear of their rivals that they have already secured the symbolic title of autumn champions for the team that tops the table at Christmas. ""It is a good thing to be autumn champions because it confirms that we are picking up an enormous amount of points, but it does not mean we are certain to win the title,"" tempered PSG coach Laurent Blanc despite his team finishing the day 15 points clear at the top. The match was also significant for being the first top-level game to be played in the French capital since the terror attacks in the city and outside the Stade de France during France's game with Germany on November 13 that left 130 dead and many more injured. With France still in a state of emergency, there were stringent security checks on the way into the Parc des Princes, and there was also a moving tribute before the game kicked off. The likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar, Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo and other sporting superstars appeared on a video played on big screens with each repeating the slogan 'Je Suis Paris' (I am Paris) that PSG also sported on their shirts. A huge French flag greeted the players as they came out while 'La Marseillaise' was sung and a minute's silence held, just as had been the case across France and elsewhere in Europe last weekend. France's prime minister Manuel Valls and the Emir of Qatar were among the crowd for the game as the club owned by the Gulf state further demonstrated their dominance over the rest of Ligue 1. PSG were looking to make it 24 Ligue 1 games unbeaten against a Troyes side who had still not won since returning to the top flight in the summer and it was a largely one-sided contest. Cavani had already come close twice before he opened the scoring 20 minutes in, meeting Angel Di Maria's assist with a first-time finish after the visitors lost possession cheaply in their own half. At the other end Kevin Trapp had to intervene twice with good saves from Fabien Camus and Benjamin Nivet to ensure Paris remained in front going into half-time. The hosts went on to double their lead just before the hour, however. A penalty was awarded when Lucas was brought down inside the area by Chris Mavinga and Ibrahimovic stepped up to send Paul Bernardoni the wrong way from the spot and score his 10th league goal of the campaign. The third goal arrived midway through the second half when a Di Maria cross was headed away by the Troyes defence but only as far as Kurzawa, who controlled on his chest before volleying low into the bottom-right corner. Augustin, who had replaced Cavani, got the fourth goal with six minutes left, his shot from 25 yards going through the legs of Bernardoni. Ayasse got one back with a fine strike in injury time but Troyes remain rooted to the foot of the table. Paris are now 15 points clear of Angers who moved second with a 2-0 home win over Lille thanks to two goals in five first-half minutes through Gilles Sunu and Ismael Traore.

865,26/11/2015,19:00,No away fans as PSG play first home game since Paris attacks,Paris Saint-Germain will wear shirts with the words 'Je suis Paris' for their first home game since the terror attacks on Saturday as Ligue 1 is played without away supporters for a second successive weekend.,"The three-time reigning French champions face rock-bottom Troyes in their first game at the Parc des Princes since three suicide bombers blew themselves up outside the Stade de France on November 13, with 130 people in total killed in a series of attacks on the French capital. It will be the second time they wear the 'Je suis Paris' shirts after Wednesday's Champions League game against Malmo when they strolled into the last 16 with a 5-0 rout of their Group A rivals in Sweden. As well as the lack of away fans, security will be beefed up with spectators required to present identity papers and banned from carrying bags into the grounds with the security perimeter outside the Paris stadium extended. Similar security measures were also planned for Thursday's Europa League clash between Marseille and Dutch side Groningen in the Stade Vélodrome. The French football league (LFP) confirmed Thursday that the subsequent three rounds of Ligue 1 games and the next two rounds of Ligue 2 fixtures will be played without away fans with the ban to be extended to European Champions League and Europa League games playing in France until December 10. The decision was taken because of lack of available police with France in a state of emergency after the attacks, and with the COP21 climate change conference taking place in the French capital from November 30 to December 11. ""Given the current circumstances, the travel ban of supporters will be maintained, because of the rationalisation of security measures, as it is obvious that the police have other things to do now than accompany the fans,"" French Minister of State for Sports Thierry Braillard said. Travelling fans will not be able to attend games until December 18-20, the final weekend before the Christmas break. PSG will be overwhelming favourites to maintain their unbeaten Ligue 1 run against Troyes who by contrast have failed to win a game with just five points after 14 games. Troyes defender Jonathan Martins Pereira admitted the odds were stacked against the side from 150km southeast of Paris, not only because they will be without their fans. But he warned: ""Even if we only have a five-percent chance, we'll give it everything we have to try and pull off a shock. ""We'll go to Parc des Princes to stand up to Paris Saint-Germain. And why? There are so many surprises in football ... "" In the weekend's early match on Friday, Lyon, sitting second 13 points behind PSG, face Montpellier badly in need of a quick fix after being bundled out of the Champions League by Gent in midweek. The Belgian visitors' 2-1 win in the last European game to be played at the Stade de Gerland put an end to Lyon's hopes of reaching the last 16 in what has been a miserable continental campaign. Caen, equal on points with Lyon but behind on goal difference, travel to Bordeaux on Sunday looking to make up for last week's disappointing 0-0 draw at home against Angers, as Nice a point behind the Normandy side, travel to Toulouse on Saturday. Monaco, in sixth place, host fellow southerners Marseille on Sunday.

866,25/11/2015,23:06,PSG cruise into last 16 on Ibrahimovic's Malmo return,Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored on his return to hometown club Malmo as Paris Saint-Germain strolled into the Champions League last 16 on Wednesday after routing their Group A rivals 5-0 in Sweden.,"First-half goals from Adrien Rabiot and Angel Di Maria put the French champions in control before Ibrahimovic struck just after the interval. Di Maria was then on target again before Lucas added a late fifth to ensure PSG's progression to the knockout phase for the fourth straight year. However, Real Madrid's 4-3 victory in Ukraine means that PSG will go through as runners-up, exposing Laurent Blanc's side to the possibility of being drawn against Barcelona or Bayern Munich in the next round. Malmo can still drop into the Europa League but the odds are stacked against them with the Swedes needing to pick up at least a point at the Santiago Bernabeu in a fortnight to stand a chance. Much was made of Ibrahimovic returning to the club with whom his professional career began 16 years ago, with the Sweden captain booking out Malmo's main square to show the match on a big screen for those without tickets. The 34-year-old was also handed the PSG captain's armband for the occasion, but there was little room for sentiment once the game kicked off as the visitors silenced the home fans just three minutes in when Rabiot headed home a Gregory van der Wiel cross for his first Champions League goal. PSG were cruising with less than a quarter-hour gone as Di Maria doubled their lead, curling low just inside Johan Wiland's right-hand post after he was picked out on the edge of the area by Blaise Matuidi. Norway forward Jo Inge Berget came close to pulling one back, jinking past Van der Wiel after linking up with Markus Rosenberg only to be denied by a fine stop from PSG goalkeeper Kevin Trapp. Ibrahimovic then took centre stage five minutes into the second half, beating Wiland from a tight angle to end an 11-month European goal drought and erase any hopes of a Malmo fightback. The hosts were awarded a penalty on 61 minutes after Nikola Djurdjic was fouled by Maxwell, but Rosenberg smacked his spot-kick against the post. Di Maria notched his second of the evening soon after as Maxwell atoned for his earlier error by finding the unmarked Argentine who headed past a helpless Wiland. That was Di Maria's last act as he was immediately replaced by Lucas and it was the Brazilian who capped the rout by curling home a free-kick eight minutes from time. The sell-out crowd at the Malmo New Stadium then rose in unison to applaud their hero as Ibrahimovic made way for Jean-Kevin Augustin late on."
867,24/11/2015,18:18,Security to be stepped up for PSG-Troyes,"Security will be increased for Saturday's Ligue 1 clash between Paris Saint-Germain and Troyes, the team from the French capital said on Tuesday.","Saturday's league match will be the first the champions play at their Parc des Princes home since the deadly terror attacks on November 13 that left 130 people dead in Paris. Since then, security has been increased at sporting occasions right across France while all sport was called off at the weekend immediately following the attacks. The measures will be ""maintained for an indefinite period of time"" according to a statement by PSG. ""Fans are invited to arrive early in order to facilitate security controls and ease access through the turnstiles,"" the statement said. PSG's players will also abandon their habit of arriving at the stadium along the red carpet at the ground's main entrance. Gates will open two hours before the 1600 GMT kick-off while fans will be required to show ID to gain access to the stadium. Helmets and bags have also been banned from the stadium. The security perimeter around the Parc des Princes is set to be extended, impacting on traffic, and will be controlled by police. PSG will honour the victims with a special shirt for the game that will see the name of the sponsor emblazoned across the front replaced by the solidarity phrase: Je suis Paris (I am Paris)."
868,24/11/2015,01:40,Ibrahimovic's Malmo return leaves some fans conflicted,"As Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic returns to his home town on Wednesday, some Malmo fans are torn over whether to support the city's prodigal son or the team that launched his career.","On a football pitch in the immigrant-heavy neighbourhood of Rosengard, where the 34-year-old Swede grew up, one of his childhood teammates sighed as he pondered where his sympathies would lie during the Champions League match between Malmo and PSG. ""Both, both. Maybe for Malmo a little bit more,"" Ivan Milosevic said, before laughing and adding: ""I'm a 'Malmoitian',"" referring to a term for the city's inhabitants. Born the same year, both players began their careers at FBK Balkan, a local club founded by immigrants from the former Yugoslavia in 1962, which the club say makes them the oldest immigrant football team in Europe. ""He was a funny character, constantly up to a lot of mischief. Nicked bicycles, came with it to practice, always had a ball, bantered with others in the team...,"" he said. ""He ran around and didn't listen to the coaches. Did what he liked to do, dribbled when he was meant to pass."" Almost 15 years after he left Malmo for Ajax, Ibrahimovic's maverick image remains intact as he regularly courts controversy, ranging from his recent claim that he put France ""on the world map"" to an offer to donate a signed bicycle to female players after the Swedish FA rewarded a male player with a new Volvo. In the troubled suburbs that dot Malmo's eastern half, support has never wavered and on the field his influence is clear. ""He's the big idol here, everyone looks up to him,"" said Milosevic. Ibrahimovic joined Malmo FF in 1994, paving the way for other players from an immigrant background to do the same. It was a remarkable feat in a city that remains deeply segregated, especially for someone who according to his own autobiography would sometimes go to bed hungry. Greek-born Aneta Moura, a former neighbour, said she remembered him as ""maybe a bit mischievous. His mother had to come and get him here and there."" When he was between eight and 10, he was the ""boss"" of a group of children whom he would push into the local grocery store to go buy sweets for him, she said. ""Because poor Zlatan didn't have money to go buy (anything)... He wasn't raised quite like the other children. I know that, I could feel that from him,"" she said. But she added: ""He was a very alert boy. He's still the same."" Preparations for Wednesday's game have been underway in Malmo from the moment it was announced that PSG would be coming to town. ""All of Malmo will be able to watch the game. I've booked the main square where the game... will be broadcast live,"" Ibrahimovic wrote on Facebook in September. At the local Rosengard shopping centre, Muhsen Awad, a Swedish-Arabic interpreter who also runs a side business selling football flags and CDs, said he had ""tried in every way possible"" to get his hands on a ticket for the game without any luck. They have been on sale for as much as 20,000 kronor ($2,289, 2,146 euros) on the black market, he claimed, adjusting one of the many blue and white Malmo flags adorning his shop. ""For sure there will be mixed feelings... It will be a historic game when Zlatan comes to play against his 'own', original team,"" he said, before predicting that Malmo fans would still remain loyal to their own team. ""All of our region supports Malmo FF no matter who they play against,"" he said. Those comments were echoed by Max Wiman, a columnist for regional daily Sydsvenskan. Ibrahimovic ""has very strong feelings for Malmo,"" he said, noting that the PSG star had described playing a Champions League game in the city as ""a dream"". Although he was ""fantastically big"" there and would probably be cheered before the match, ""most people will support Malmo,"" he said."
869,21/11/2015,19:38,PSG see off Lorient to stretch lead,Reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain stretched their lead in Ligue 1 to 13 points on Saturday after claiming a 2-1 victory away to Lorient with security tight after the attacks in Paris.,"Playing for the first time since the attacks, the capital club extended their winning run to eight matches through first-half goals from Hervin Ongenda and Blaise Matuidi at the Stade du Moustoir. Benjamin Moukandjo netted his league-best 10th goal to set up a nervy finish but Lorient ultimately suffered their first defeat in six outings. Tightened security checks were in place in Brittany, much like the rest of the country, just eight days after terrorist attacks in Paris and by the Stade de France left 130 people dead and more than 350 injured. As on Friday prior to Nice's 3-0 victory over Lyon, France's national anthem, 'La Marseillaise', rang out around the ground before a minute's silence was observed in memory of the victims. Eleven doves of peace were released into the sky ahead of kick-off, while PSG players wore shirts adorned with the words ""Je suis Paris"" (I am Paris) below the club crest. PSG coach Laurent Blanc had admitted it would not be easy for his team to focus on football following last week's atrocities but said none of his players had asked him to be left out of Saturday's squad. However, the league leaders were without Javier Pastore, Marco Verratti, Angel Di Maria and Ezequiel Lavezzi due to injury while David Luiz was rested to protect his knee from Lorient's artificial surface. PSG had won on each of their last four visits to Lorient and duly grabbed a 26th-minute lead through academy product Ongenda who poked home Gregory van der Wiel's cross for his first goal in the French top flight. Ongenda had a hand in the visitors' second goal six minutes later, releasing Zlatan Ibrahimovic with the Swede then squaring for Matuidi to guide past Lorient goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte from close range. Sylvain Ripoll's hosts had lost just once since August and nearly find a way back into the contest when Raphael Guerreiro sent an effort just wide of Kevin Trapp's right-hand post early into the second half. Lorient did eventually pull one back on 82 minutes as Cameroon striker Moukandjo, who now has five goals in his last three matches, headed in substitute Romain Philippoteaux's cross but it served as nothing more than a consolation. Nice climbed to third on Friday Valere Germain and Vincent Koziello struck either side of a Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa own-goal to move them to within a point of second-placed Lyon. Monaco host Nantes later on while the Corsica derby between Bastia and Gazelac Ajaccio has been rescheduled for Sunday due to strong winds. Marseille travel to Saint-Etienne for Sunday's late kick-off with fourth-placed Caen at home to fifth-placed Angers."
870,20/11/2015,16:51,Blanc admits negotiations for new PSG deal,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc on Friday confirmed that he is currently in negotiations over an extension to his current contract, which expires at the end of this season.","""We are in discussions about an eventual contract extension. We are negotiating. No decision has been made yet,"" said Blanc at a press conference ahead of Saturday's Ligue 1 clash with Lorient. ""The fact we are talking shows there is a common desire to do it,"" added Blanc, who this week celebrated his 50th birthday. ""The club called me to discuss it. It wasn't my request. That is a good thing."" Blanc is in his third season in charge of PSG, whom he led to a clean sweep of the domestic honours in France last season as well as the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Reaching the last four in that competition and retaining the Ligue 1 title are the primary goals for this season. ""Those are our two major objectives. The national Cups this season are not a major target, which doesn't mean we won't be playing them to win."" PSG are unbeaten in Ligue 1 this season and come into the weekend 10 points clear of second-place Lyon before going to Lorient on Saturday. They can clinch a place in the last 16 of the Champions League when they visit Swedish side Malmo next midweek."
871,20/11/2015,15:46,Blanc: 'Playing football will be hard',Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc has admitted it will not be easy for his team to focus on football as the French champions play for the first time since last week's terror attacks.,"""Everyone is affected, but life goes on,"" said Blanc at a press conference on Friday ahead of Saturday's trip to play Lorient in Ligue 1. PSG were not in action last weekend due to the international break. Many of Blanc's players have only just returned to the French capital after playing for their countries and Blanc said none had come to him asking not to play in Brittany. ""We can't avoid talking about the context. Everyone is affected, but life goes on. We have to carry on with our jobs to get over all this."" The game in Lorient is set to go ahead just eight days after the shocking terrorist attacks in Paris and by the Stade de France, while France were playing Germany in a friendly, that have killed 130 people. Among the dead were two men who ran an Italian restaurant in the Paris suburbs and who were close to members of the PSG squad, including goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu and midfielder Javier Pastore. ""They are affected and putting a lot of things into perspective too,"" added Blanc, who this week celebrated his 50th birthday. ""There is a job to do, which has been done, and which is easier to say than do. But life goes on. ""It will be difficult to play football this weekend, but we have to do it, because to not do so would be letting the terrorists win."" When asked how he and his staff have dealt with the squad's mental state after the events, Blanc said: ""It has not been easy because you need to find solutions, ways of lifting them. ""The message we have put across to them, despite all that, despite the shock and despite being touched to some degree or other by what happened, is that life goes on and our life is to play football. ""We are asked to prepare for a match, to play it. We will do so with great professionalism. That is our job."" However, Pastore will not travel because of a calf injury, while Marco Verratti is not fit and Brazil defender Davis Luiz will not feature for the Ligue 1 leaders in order to protect his knee from Lorient's artificial surface."
872,15/11/2015,22:39,'Worried' David Luiz says returning to Paris,"Paris Saint-Germain's Brazilian defender David Luiz was on his way back to the traumatized French capital on Sunday, but admitted he was doing so with a sense of dread.","The international star was lampooned by fellow professionals after saying he wanted to stay in his native Brazil rather than return to Paris after Friday's gun and bomb attacks that killed at least 129 people. But he is suspended for Brazil's clash with Peru on Tuesday and said he had no option but to go back to his club. ""I'm worried. I want to be near my girlfriend and my friends who stayed in France,"" he told GloboEsporte before leaving for the airport. ""Unfortunately, I'll have to live with this situation because I have to go to work."" Luiz, 28, was sent off for a second yellow card in the dying minutes but Brazil hung on for a 1-1 draw against arch-rivals Argentina on Friday in a tense World Cup qualifying battle. After the match, as news filtered through of the mounting death toll in Paris, the former Chelsea defender said he did not want to return to France. ""If it were up to me, I'd stay,"" he said at the time."
873,07/11/2015,19:04,PSG in rampant mood on return to domestic action,Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice as Paris Saint-Germain extended their huge lead at the top of Ligue 1 by destroying a hapless Toulouse 5-0 at the Parc des Princes on Saturday.,"Frustrated by their inability to put the ball in the net in a Champions League defeat to Real Madrid in midweek, PSG saw Angel Di Maria open the scoring on their return to domestic duty before Ibrahimovic got a brace either side of a Lucas goal. Ezequiel Lavezzi completed the rout. The win saw the reigning French champions continue their unbeaten start to the domestic season as they made it seven league victories in a row. The Parisians may be forgiven if they lose no sleep over high-flying Caen, in second place, who closed the gap to 11 points with a tight 2-1 win at home over Guingamp in one of Saturday's late games. The campaign is only 13 games old but PSG are already 13 points ahead of Lyon and Saint-Etienne -- who meet on Sunday evening -- as well as Angers, who were beaten 2-0 at home by Rennes on Friday. ""We are not yet champions but if we continue like this we can win it soon,"" Lucas told Canal Plus. ""We can go down in history. To not lose a match is our objective."" Laurent Blanc's charges let themselves down with poor finishing as they succumbed to a 1-0 defeat at Real Madrid in midweek, but their poise was better on Saturday and it was a day to forget for struggling Toulouse. The visitors started the day in the relegation zone and had not won in 11 league games since the opening weekend of the season, so an away win would have been an enormous upset. Paris just six minutes to open the scoring thanks to Di Maria, whose dead-ball delivery from 40 yards was not intended as a shot, but evaded everyone on its way into the net. The hosts continued to create openings but their second goal in the 18th minute was something of a gift from the Toulouse defence as on-loan Monaco man Marcel Tisserand inexplicably headed the ball back across his own six-yard box to leave Ibrahimovic a simple finish. The Swede and Di Maria both had chances to increase the advantage prior to the interval while Edinson Cavani was denied by a good Ali Ahamada save at the start of the second half before Toulouse created their first opportunity of note from a Jean-Daniel Akpa-Akpro ball across the box that passed just beyond the reach of Martin Braithwaite. Blanc freshened up his attack with the introduction of Lucas and Lavezzi in place of Cavani and Di Maria, and it was the Brazilian who made it 3-0 on 66 minutes, starting the move and then continuing his run to the back post where he headed home Gregory van der Wiel's cross. Lucas played his part in the fourth goal which arrived with a quarter of an hour remaining, as his shot was beaten away by Ahamada and Ibrahimovic arrived to convert the follow-up. Lavezzi put the seal on an utterly comprehensive win with just his second of the season on 78 minutes as PSG extended their unbeaten run in Ligue 1 to 22 matches since March. In other late games, tiny Gazalec-Ajaccio got a crucial three points at Reims with a 2-1 win that lifted them to third from bottom. Level with them on 12 points are Montpellier, who clinched a last gasp 2-1 win at home to Nantes. Lille climbed to 16th with a late goal giving them a 1-1 draw with Bastia while rock bottom Troyes, the only team in Ligue 1 still without a win, were beaten 4-1 at Lorient."
874,06/11/2015,15:47,PSG missing three players for Toulouse,"Paris Saint-Germain will be missing a trio of key players for Saturday's visit of Toulouse, coach Laurent Blanc said on Friday.","Italy midfielder Marco Verratti (ankle), defender Marquinhos (hamstring) and playmaker Javier Pastore, who is lacking match fitness, will all sit out the clash at the Parc des Princes. Pastore has missed the last three matches due to a contagious eye infection and has yet to regain full fitness, said Blanc. Marquinhos injured his hamstring during training last week ahead of the Ligue 1 leaders' trip to Rennes, while Verratti was forced off during Tuesday's 1-0 Champions League defeat at Real Madrid. The Italian could be out for a month, according to French newspaper l'Equipe. Unbeaten PSG have a 10-point lead over second-placed Lyon after just 12 matches -- 10 of which they have won."
875,06/11/2015,02:20,Untouchable PSG leave Ligue 1 rivals fighting for scraps,"The suspense in the Ligue 1 title race appears to already be over, with Paris Saint-Germain 10 points clear and unbeaten after 12 matches, leaving the rest of the top flight to battle for lesser honours.","Laurent Blanc's PSG side are firmly on course for a fourth straight title, and while they clearly admit that winning the Champions League is their main priority, even a 1-0 defeat at Real Madrid in midweek was met by positive feedback after a proud performance. It was the capital side's first defeat of the season in all competitions, but the manner in which they dominated the 10-time European champions only underlined their status as one of the top teams in Europe. PSG return to the comforts of the Parc des Princes on Saturday when Blanc will lead his men out against second-from-bottom Toulouse expecting to take maximum points from what appears a home-win banker. Seven-time champions Lyon are second and ahead on goal difference above Angers as well as their arch-rivals Saint-Etienne, who visit the Stade Gerland in the weekend's feature match on Sunday. However the fashion in which Hubert Fournier's side were all but eliminated from the Champions League on Wednesday, following a 2-0 defeat at home to Zenit St Petersburg, again shows the gulf in class between PSG and one of their closest rivals. ""We would have been more comfortable, heading into the Saint-Etienne match, if we would have won on Wednesday but it's up to us to recover and rely on the things that have working for us this season,"" said Fournier. Lyon's key striker Alexandre Lacazette added the team would bounce back for one of the fiercest rivals in French football. ""We have to just prepare the best we can for Sunday because a derby against Saint-Etienne is a match we have to win."" Angers, who kick off the weekend slate on Friday at home to mid-table Rennes and are tied with Lyon, are more concerned about avoiding relegation after their recent promotion. Another telling statistic is that apart from PSG and Monaco, the other four French clubs that have qualified for the Champions League -- Lyon, Marseille, Lille and Montpellier -- have won just one match between them in 22 matches at the top continental level since 2012. Monaco have climbed the table after a stuttering start to their campaign, and come into their Sunday tie at Bordeaux in sixth place, while Marseille are well out of the running with four wins from 12 fixtures and a distant 17 points adrift, ahead of their clash at home to Nice on Sunday. Lille continue to rebuild under two-time Africa Cup of Nations winner Herve Renard, but the road looks long for the 2011 champions after just two wins this season left them three points above the relegation zone. The Dogues (Great Danes) host lower-table Bastia on Saturday on a night when fifth-placed Caen await Guingamp, improving Nantes travel to Montpellier, fresh from their midweek win over Nice, Lorient meet Troyes and Reims are at home to GFC Ajaccio.

876,03/11/2015,22:48,Unlikely hero Nacho takes Madrid into last 16,First-half substitute Nacho was the unlikely hero with the only goal of the game as Real Madrid beat Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 on Tuesday to seal their place in the Champions League last 16.,"The defender had only been on the field for two minutes as an emergency left-back in place of the injured Marcelo when he took advantage of a defensive mix-up in the 35th minute to slot past stranded PSG goalkeeper Kevin Trapp and score the only goal of the game. The result allowed Rafael Benitez's side to become one of the first teams to guarantee their place in the knockout rounds as they maintained their unbeaten record this season and inflicted a first defeat on PSG since Barcelona eliminated the French champions from this competition in April. However, PSG only have themselves to blame for losing after missing a host of chances in a first half they dominated. With Shakhtar Donetsk beating Malmo 4-0 in Ukraine in the night's other game, Laurent Blanc's side remain four points clear of the teams below them and so should still comfortably join Madrid in the next round, but they are likely to have to settle for second place. There was particular pressure on the visitors to show they could genuinely compete with one of the continent's finest in their own backyard after they lacked inspiration in a 0-0 draw with an injury-hit Real in France a fortnight ago. And to be fair to PSG, they immediately took the game to their hosts, controlling possession and overcoming the loss of influential midfielder Marco Verratti to what appeared to be an ankle injury after just 17 minutes. Back at his old home ground, Angel Di Maria played in Serge Aurier and his cutback picked out Blaise Matuidi for a first meaningful shot at goal, although his effort on his weaker right foot was easily saved by Keylor Navas. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, so disappointing in the reverse fixture, then curled a shot agonisingly wide and the Swede also hammered a long-range free-kick inches past the post with Navas beaten just before the half-hour mark. The crucial moment in the game arrived shortly after, with Nacho being sent on to replace Marcelo after the Brazilian pulled up injured. Two minutes after that, the 25-year-old defender put his team in front, with the aid of the PSG defence. When a Toni Kroos shot struck Thiago Silva and looped up into the air, Trapp came racing off his line towards the ball but then stopped, allowing Nacho to sidefoot a first-time effort into the unguarded net from the left side of the box. The goal came utterly against the run of play, and to their credit PSG did not let their heads go down. Adrien Rabiot sent a controlled volley with his left foot against the base of the post from 25 yards before somehow both Edinson Cavani and Ibrahimovic failed to connect with an inviting Maxwell cross from the left. Worse was to come as Cavani passed up the best chance to fall the visitors' way yet, squandering a glorious opportunity to score after a Di Maria pass had left him through with just Navas to beat. There was a vast improvement from Madrid in the second half and most of the chances were theirs, with Trapp saving from Isco, twice, and Kroos. However, there was to be more agony for Paris as Di Maria crashed a free-kick off the top of the bar and over in the 89th minute, as the home fans breathed a sigh of relief."

878,02/11/2015,20:29,Blanc wants PSG to impose themselves on Madrid,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc has called on his players to have the courage to impose their game on Real Madrid when the two sides meet in the Spanish capital on Tuesday.,"First place in Group A is on the line at the Santiago Bernabeu with both sides having taken seven points from their opening three games after a 0-0 draw when they clashed in Paris two weeks ago. ""After a 0-0 draw at our home Real have a psychological edge,"" admitted Blanc. ""We are coming here to Madrid and, without lacking any respect to a great club, we want to impose our play here. ""It is ambitious I know, but I hope that we can win both the physical and technical battles because it will take both to win."" The French champions were criticised for not making more of a drastically depleted Madrid side due to injuries at the Parc des Princes. Blanc admitted he was surprised at the Spanish giants attacking intent having labelled Rafael Benitez's men defensively minded in the build-up to the first meeting between the two. And the former Barcelona defender believes his side must be better physically and technically to inflict Madrid's first defeat since Benitez took charge in June ""It is just in terms of intensity and precision we didn't have the means to be better. ""These two criteria of technical skill and physical strength is what it will take to make this match a reference for us."" Despite three consecutive French titles, including a domestic quadruple last season, PSG have yet to truly make an impact on the Champions League in recent seasons. Victory at the Bernabeu would arguably be the biggest win since Qatar Sports Investments starting investing millions in the club in 2012. However, Blanc played down the importance of making a mark in the group stages after their experience of being thrashed 5-1 on aggregate by eventual champions Barcelona in the quarter-finals last season despite a 3-2 win over the Catalans in the Group Stage. ""It is a prestigious match, but a victory at Real Madrid doesn't give us any guarantee of being in the quarter or semi-finals in the spring. ""Last year we beat Barcelona at home in the group stage, but they eliminated us in the quarter-finals."""

Laurent Blanc's side were streets ahead of Saint-Etienne -- seen as contenders for a top-three finish -- in a 4-1 stroll at the Parc des Princes last Sunday. They are currently seven points clear of second-placed Angers and have gone 22 matches without losing in all competitions since being beaten by Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals last April. In Ligue 1, their unbeaten run covers 20 games going back to March, and few give Rennes, or anyone, a chance of ending that record right now. ""Against PSG, I get the impression that players from other teams go onto the pitch with a feeling of resignation,"" former Lyon, Paris and France goalkeeper Gregory Coupet told leading sports daily L'Equipe this week. ""For example, on Sunday for PSG v Saint-Etienne, we try to talk it up as a big match, but well...you could see that they were just trying to avoid getting hammered. ""It feels like when clubs face PSG they go into the game knowing already they won't get one point never mind three."" However, Rennes could be helped by the number of leading names missing from the Paris squad that departed for Brittany on Thursday, with David Luiz, Marquinhos, Javier Pastore and Edinson Cavani all missing. Blanc may be tempted to rest some players ahead of the Madrid clash but Zlatan Ibrahimovic should start in attack with the Swede having scored seven goals in his last five league games. Rennes have gone six games without a league win, although a strong line-up secured a 1-0 victory at Bastia in the League Cup on Tuesday. ""They are superior to us in every area,"" said Rennes coach Philippe Montanier, although he remains hopeful of causing an upset. ""In one match everything is possible. If someone wants to become rich they should put a euro on us."" Angers are in action on Sunday away to Monaco, who are unbeaten in seven games and beginning to look like the side that finished third last season. Caen, currently in third, visit struggling Bastia on Saturday, while Lyon are away at winless bottom side Troyes as they seek a confidence-boosting win ahead of a crucial Champions League clash against Zenit St Petersburg. Saint-Etienne are at home to Reims as they look to bounce back from a punishing trip to Paris, and Marseille travel to Nantes on Sunday evening. Before that, Nice will seek to get back on track after a shock loss to struggling Gazelec Ajaccio when they face Lille on the Cote d'Azur. Claude Puel's side had scored 17 goals in recording four straight wins prior to that, inspired by the superb form of Hatem Ben Arfa, who is now being linked with a France recall. ""I am not going to question Hatem's quality and his talent,"" France coach Didier Deschamps told Eurosport as he refused to rule out naming the mercurial playmaker for next month's friendly matches against Germany and England. ""Why not? I will think about it based on what he has done with Nice,"" added Deschamps of Ben Arfa, who has had a chequered career but has scored seven Ligue 1 goals this season.

880,29/10/2015,11:48,Di Maria admits desperation to leave Man Utd,Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Angel di Maria has recognised he was desperate to leave Manchester United to join the French champions after an ill-fated solo season in England.,"Di Maria's near £60 million ($92 million) move from Real Madrid to United in 2014 remains a British transfer record. The Argentine failed to live up to the form he had shown in Madrid's Champions League winning campaign in 2014, though, as he left having scored just four goals in 32 appearances. However, he confirmed that a terrifying attempted robbery at his Manchester home in February had precipitated his desire to join the French champions. ""I started very well, but then I had problems with people at the club,"" Di Maria told Spanish sports daily Marca on Thursday. ""I started to be put on the bench. Then my house was robbed, all of it made me want to leave there quickly."" Di Maria will return to Madrid with PSG in the Champions League next week having spent four years with Los Blancos. The 27-year-old was pushed out of the club to make way for James Rodriguez after his stellar performances at the 2014 World Cup despite Di Maria's major role in finaly delivering Madrid's 10th European Cup. And he claimed he never wanted to leave the Santiago Bernabeu. ""My intention was always to stay. I never wanted to leave. ""I don't know what happened inside the club, but that was more to do with agents. ""These are things that happen in football. I left as I left, but I take with me the nicest part which was the final ovation of the Bernabeu."""

Marco Verratti put through his own net to give Les Verts, who are fifth, a consolation but Lucas headed in the hosts' fourth to secure a comfortable PSG win that underlined the yawning gap between them and the rest of French football. Laurent Blanc's side have still not lost a game this season in any competition and are now undefeated in 20 Ligue 1 matches since March. That form has allowed them to move seven points clear of Angers, the newly-promoted surprise package who drew 0-0 at home to Guingamp on Saturday. Blanc made three changes to the team that drew with Real Madrid in the Champions League during the week and it was one of those players brought into the side, Kurzawa, who opened the scoring midway through the first half. The former Monaco left-back fired in a low shot from the left side of the penalty area that Saint-Etienne 'keeper Stephane Ruffier got a touch to but could not keep out. Ruffier did make a tremendous save to deny Cavani before the break but he could not prevent the Uruguayan from converting an Ibrahimovic assist three minutes after the interval for his seventh league goal of the season. Cavani returned the favour when he set up the Swedish striker to grab his seventh of the campaign midway through the second period, before a Marquinhos clearance ricocheted off Verratti and in for an own goal at the other end. However, a Lucas back-post header crossed the line despite Ruffier's attempts to keep it out as the capital club put the seal on their victory. ""To have 29 points after 11 matches is a very good thing, because some of our direct rivals have been dropping points,"" said Blanc. ""We need to try to improve our game in the league and play with greater determination so we don't get taken by surprise when it comes to the Champions League."" Earlier, Monaco closed in on the European places with a 1-0 win at Reims as Bernardo Silva got the only goal of the game against their 10-man hosts. Leonardo Jardim's team opened the scoring in the 11th minute at the Stade Auguste-Delaune when Nabil Dirar crossed from the right and the diminutive Silva got up to head in his third goal of the season at the back post. They might have added to their lead but Argentine striker Guido Carrillo hit both posts before the interval, while Jordan Siebatcheu hit the upright for Reims in stoppage time. The hosts had been reduced to 10 men midway through the second half when Antoine Devaux walked for a second yellow card, as Monaco claimed a first league win in a month to climb to eighth.

884,22/10/2015,02:27,Diminished Madrid were 'exceptional' - Benitez,"Real Madrid coach Rafa Benitez described his injury-hit team's performance in holding Paris Saint-Germain to a 0-0 draw at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday as ""exceptional"".","""We deserved to win the match. Given the circumstances the performance of the team was not good, it was exceptional,"" said Benitez after the Group A clash that failed to live up to expectations as a spectacle but edged both clubs a step closer to qualification for the last 16. ""I was convinced the team would play well and try to win the game. We had chances to win it, more than them, and decent control of the match against a team who are not easy to play against. ""As coach I am very satisfied with the performance of the players."" Real were without Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez for the trip to the French capital, along with Pepe, so their attacking potential was greatly reduced, although they could still call upon their all-time leading scorer in Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese superstar came as close as anyone to winning the game with a 72nd-minute volley that flew just wide, but the point keeps Real on course for qualification for the last 16 from Group A and makes them favourites to win the section. They host PSG in the Spanish capital in a fortnight, with both clubs on seven points, four points clear of Malmo, who beat Shakhtar Donetsk 1-0 in Sweden in the night's other game. Critics who label Benitez an overly defensive coach will point out that Madrid failed to score for the first time in 41 Champions League group games since a 2-0 defeat to Juventus back in 2008, when Bernd Schuster was in charge. It was also Madrid's third goalless draw this season, but this was not a bad result for Real at a venue where Barcelona lost 3-2 in the group stage a year ago. ""I am not worried about possession. I am more interested in the performance of the team, and despite the injuries we saw a great Real Madrid,"" Benitez added. ""We were aggressive and incisive. Everything we planned turned out well. There are always little details missing but I think overall it was exceptional."" PSG's attack was spearheaded by their own all-time leading scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, but he was kept quiet along with Edinson Cavani and Angel Di Maria, leaving home coach Laurent Blanc to focus instead on his team's defensive display. ""I am not satisfied because we didn't get the result we were looking for,"" said Blanc, who was disappointed with the first half in particular. ""We corrected things in the second half. We opened up to Madrid hitting us on the break but I think that was a risk we had to take to try to win the game. ""One can be disappointed and think PSG would dominate but even against a Real side with lots of absentees its not easy. ""We competed with them. We didn't dominate but the draw was fair and we were very good defensively so the biggest satisfaction comes from there,"" added Blanc, whose team, like Real, remain unbeaten in all competitions this season."
885,21/10/2015,22:43,"Honours even as PSG, Real play out goalless draw",Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid played out an anti-climactic 0-0 draw in the Champions League on Wednesday despite both teams being able to call upon their all-time leading scorers.,"Cristiano Ronaldo, who overtook Raul as Madrid's top scorer in history last weekend, came as close as anyone to breaking the deadlock in the French capital with a second-half volley that whistled wide. Zlatan Ibrahimovic and PSG, meanwhile, were stifled by Real's defensive organisation and never seriously tested Keylor Navas in the visitors' goal. But while the game failed to live up to expectations as a spectacle, the result is not a bad one for either team, particularly the visitors. Both sides remain unbeaten this season and are yet to concede after three games in Group A as they sit locked together on seven points at the top of the section. Malmo won 1-0 at home to Shakhtar Donetsk in the night's other game but Paris and Madrid are each four points clear of the Swedes and will have an opportunity to clinch qualification for the last 16 when they meet again in Spain in a fortnight. Perhaps that will be a more open contest, but under the Parisian drizzle it was Rafael Benitez's tactical nous that frustrated the hosts and enabled Real to secure a result that is not to be sniffed at given their current injury problems. Deprived of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez, Benitez handed starts to Jese and Lucas Vazquez on the flanks in a 4-4-2 formation but his main objective appeared to be to stifle a PSG side obsessed with dominating possession. It was a tactic that proved very effective in the first half, with Paris unable to trouble Navas other than from a low Blaise Matuidi shot from the edge of the box in the 11th minute that was stopped comfortably enough by the Costa Rican. The French champions were too slow and predictable on the ball and Angel Di Maria, who had said ahead of the game that he would not celebrate if he scored against the club with whom he won the Champions League in 2014, looked like he would rather not be playing at all. It was Real who were the more likely side, and Toni Kroos slipped a pass through to Jese, who was denied by Kevin Trapp racing from his line. A brief spell of applied Madrid pressure followed after Di Maria lost the ball cheaply in the opposition half and Trapp tipped over a Ronaldo header following a Kroos corner. Ronaldo tried his luck from two long-range free-kicks either side of half-time but they only served to show why, for all his immense talent, he has scored from just two of his last 89 direct free-kicks. But it was Ronaldo who might have won the game in the 72nd minute. When a Paris corner came to nothing, Real broke quickly and Marcelo teed up the Portuguese superstar for a volley from a tight angle to the left of the box that fizzed just past the far post. He was also the target of the affection of a pitch invader who ran on to the field for a hug with the Ballon d'Or winner before being dragged away to the biggest cheer of the evening."

The two were accused of having given under-the-table payments to players in order to avoid taxes between 2000 and 2005, in breach of the country's labour laws. Players who benefited from the payments included former France international Nicolas Anelka and Brazil's Ronaldinho. The long-running case had already seen Laurent Perpere, who headed up the PSG between 1998 and 2003, given a ten-month suspended sentence and a 30,000-euro fine in 2013. His successor Francis Graille was also handed down a six-month suspended sentence and a 15,000-euro fine."
887,20/10/2015,02:05,Supremacy at stake as PSG host injury-hit Madrid,Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid will test their Champions League credentials when they meet at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday with supremacy in their group at stake.,"The two teams, who harbour ambitions of going all the way in Europe's elite club competition, are locked together at the top of Group A having both beaten Malmo and Shakhtar Donetsk without conceding a goal. Both sides are therefore well on course to qualify for the last 16, but their double confrontation over the next two weeks -- they also meet in the Spanish capital on November 3 -- will likely determine who wins the section and thereby sets up a more favourable draw in the first knockout round. Madrid's preparations for the match -- which comes ahead of a testing run of games in which they will also meet Celta Vigo, Sevilla and Barcelona in La Liga in the next month -- have been overshadowed by injuries. Gareth Bale is set to miss out with a recurrence of a calf injury suffered in the 3-0 win against Levante at the weekend, while James Rodriguez, Pepe and Dani Carvajal are all expected to be sidelined in Paris. Karim Benzema is also a major doubt due to a hamstring strain. However, Rafael Benitez's men have been boosted by the return of Luka Modric to training after an abductor muscle injury and captain Sergio Ramos is reportedly set to start against the French champions after overcoming a shoulder injury. Madrid are joint top of La Liga and are still unbeaten this season under Benitez, but Spain midfielder Isco admits that record will be seriously tested at the Parc des Princes. ""They are one of the most complete sides in the competition and they have great players,"" Isco told realmadrid.com. ""The two matches against them will be very hard and will be defined by the small details. We need to follow the same path as we have up to now, scoring a lot of goals and conceding very few."" Like their opponents, PSG are yet to lose this season and they are top of Ligue 1 after winning 2-0 at Bastia at the weekend. Indeed, that result left them unbeaten in their last 20 games in all competitions since a 2-0 defeat against Barcelona in the quarter-finals of last season's Champions League in April. However, Paris coach Laurent Blanc also has injury concerns, with Marco Verratti and Angel Di Maria hoping to feature after missing the Bastia game and David Luiz struggling to overcome a knee injury suffered playing for Brazil. In addition, first-choice goalkeeper Kevin Trapp faces a fight to recover from a thigh injury in time, so Salvatore Sirigu is standing by to replace him. ""Real can hurt you at any moment. In midfield and up front all of their players can make the difference,"" warned PSG striker Edinson Cavani. The all-star cast for the game will be headed by PSG's Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Real's Cristiano Ronaldo, who have both become the all-time leading scorers for their respective clubs since the start of this month. Meanwhile, Argentina winger Di Maria will be eager to feature for Paris against the side he helped win the Champions League in 2014 with an outstanding performance in the final against Atletico Madrid. However, he says he will not produce his trademark celebration, his fingers forming the shape of a heart, should he score. ""I won't celebrate because in my heart I have not forgotten what I went through with Madrid. It was unforgettable, a magnificent memory that will always stay with me,"" Di Maria told Canal Plus. While Paris have faced Barcelona six times in the last three seasons, they have not come up against Real for two decades. Back then, the French side knocked Madrid out of Europe in consecutive seasons, beating them in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals in 1993 when a legendary late goal by Antoine Kombouare secured a 5-4 aggregate triumph, and then coming out on top in the Cup Winners' Cup quarter-finals a year later."

The vandalism involved a ""group of 40 to 50 people"" who watched the match and were armed with ""petrol, baseball bats and pickaxe handles"", according to the Haute-Corse prefect Alain Thirion. ""We had put in place measures to ensure there would be no incidents inside the stadium, which was the case,"" he added, although branches of Societe Generale and Credit Mutuel banks were torched. Thirion praised Bastia for their marshalling of the game, which PSG won 2-0. The local public prosecutor, Nicolas Bessone, vowed to hunt down and punish the perpetrators."
889,17/10/2015,19:14,Ibrahimovic double leads PSG past Bastia,Zlatan Ibrahimovic's second-half brace guided Paris Saint-Germain to a 2-0 victory at Bastia on Sunday as the reigning champions extended their unbeaten start to the campaign.,"Ibrahimovic slotted home the opener on 72 minutes at the Stade Armand Cesari after he was set up by Edinson Cavani despite the Uruguayan being offside in the build-up. The Swede then netted his second of the contest seven minutes from time as Paris registered their fourth straight league win and avenged last season's shock 4-2 defeat in Corsica. It was a far from convincing performance from Laurent Blanc's men but the result provisionally moved Paris eight points clear at the top with nearest challengers Angers and Caen in action later on. Goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu made his first start of the season in place of the injured Kevin Trapp, while PSG were also without Blaise Matuidi due to suspension as well as injured duo Marco Verratti and David Luiz. Meanwhile, Angel di Maria was rested ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Real Madrid with Adrien Rabiot and Benjamin Stambouli handed starts in central midfield. Javier Pastore's diving header that skipped wide of the post on 20 minutes represented the visitors' best chance in a fairly uneventful first half. There was a hairy moment for Sirigu, however, on his return to the side as a poor pass from the Italian was pounced upon by Gael Danic but the 'keeper redeemed himself by blocking at the feet of the Bastia midfielder just before the half-hour. Ibrahimovic had the ball in the back of the net just after half-time but his effort was correctly ruled out for offside, while Bastia 'keeper Jean-Louis Leca held well from a crisply-struck Cavani volley on the hour. Rabiot then planted a header straight at Leca following a corner but Paris eventually made the breakthrough, albeit in controversial circumstances. Cavani latched on to a clipped ball over the top from Pastore and then showed excellent composure as he teed up Ibrahimovic to slot home from close range, but Bastia were left feeling agrieved as replays indicated the Uruguayan was in a clear offside position as he broke in behind the defence. The Swede then made the points safe on 83 minutes with his second straight brace, having netted both goals in a 2-1 win over bitter rivals Marseille before the international break, as he tucked away a cutback from Serge Aurier. Former Manchester United defender Rafael salvaged a 1-1 draw with an 85th-minute equaliser for Lyon at ten-man Monaco on Friday. Mario Pasalic, on loan from Chelsea, netted his first Ligue 1 goal to put Monaco in front on 39 minutes but the home side were unable to hold on after Wallace was sent off midway through the second half for a horror tackle on Rachid Ghezzal."

The 34-year-old, who joined PSG from AC Milan in July 2012, then claimed the record outright just three minutes later, after the home side were awarded another spot-kick with Ibrahimovic holding his nerve to beat Steve Mandanda again. Ligue 1 leaders PSG led the match 2-1 at half-time."

""Our start to the Champions League is perfect but we're still not qualified for the next round,"" PSG captain Thiago Silva told Canal+ after the match in Lviv. ""Now we have to rest up and starting Thursday we'll prepare ourselves for Sunday. Marseille have plenty of qualities, it's always special to play against them."" Wednesday's performance in Ukraine was arguably PSG's most complete display this term, a worrying sign for a Marseille side languishing down in 15th place, 12 points behind their arch rivals. Despite thumping wins over Troyes and Bastia, OM have lost four of eight league matches so far and new boss Michel is still adapting to the French mentality. ""It appears that in French football players preserve themselves so they don't play too many matches in a row, and they choose their matches within reason. This surprises me but I have to get used to it,"" said Michel, in quotes published by French sports daily L'Equipe. ""They tell me that when there are big games coming up, against PSG for example, that this is normal behaviour. I have to accept it but I have trouble understanding it,"" added the former Real Madrid midfielder, who spoke of certain players asking to sit out Thursday's home Europa League clash against Slovan Liberec, which OM lost 1-0. Recent history is not on the Spaniard's side either as PSG have won the last seven meetings between the two clubs, including a 3-2 victory at the Stade Velodrome in April that effectively signalled the end of Marseille's title challenge. Lyon's woes in front of goal persisted in their midweek 1-0 Champions League defeat at home to Valencia as last season's runners-up continue to struggle to overcome a long-term injury to Nabil Fekir. Hubert Fournier's men enter Saturday's showdown with fourth-placed Reims, unbeaten in their last five, already eight points adrift of PSG. ""Winning against Reims would be a good remedy to (Tuesday's) disappointment,"" Fournier, whose side have won just one of six matches since losing Fekir, told the club's website. ""There are more expectations than last season, perhaps too many right now for several reasons. ""Alexandre (Lacazette) is a case in point. He's struggling, just like the rest of the team, to meet people's expectations,"" Fournier said of the reigning Ligue 1 Player of the Year, who has scored just one goal this term and was left out of Didier Deschamps' latest France squad. ""(But) we're just four points from second place, so it's not an irreversible situation,"" added the OL coach. Second-placed Saint-Etienne, who had their five-match winning run emphatically snapped by Nice last weekend, will aim to get back on track at Caen, while third-placed Rennes, coming off three successive draws, go to mid-table Monaco. Free-scoring Nice have racked up 13 goals over the course of a three-match winning streak and will look to continue their ascent at home to Nantes. Promoted Angers, one of four teams five points off the pace, host Bastia, Lorient face Bordeaux, while goal-shy Lille kick off week nine against fellow strugglers Montpellier on Friday."
892,29/09/2015,20:26,Paris stronger than Real - Shakhtar coach,A day ahead of hosting Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League Shakhtar Donetsk coach Mircea Lucescu said the Qatar-backed outfit were even stronger than Real Madrid right now.,"""We have every chance because we're playing at our place but Paris are just incredible. They are rolling in cash and have the best players and talent such as Marco Verratti,"" said the Romanian. ""They are well financed and well organised. They have lost in three quarter-finals but this time out they'll go further. Even the very biggest clubs will struggle against them."" The match will take place in Lviv due to the conflict in Ukraine and Lucescu while lamenting playing all matches away from home had one positive thing to look forward to. ""At least for the Champions League games we can count on support from the Lviv fans,"" he said. It'll be a real test but a real show too."" Paris Saint Germain coach Laurent Blanc offered support for the suffering of the war but said his side may add to their pain. ""We're going there to win a Champions League game, whatever the circumstances,"" said Blanc. ""It's difficult to talk about and I'm not fully informed. But I was over there during the Euros with France (as coach in 2012)."" Blanc also admired the Ukrainians style of football. ""They may have lost 4-0 at Real Madrid but they we're 50-50 for possession and it was equal if the first half. They are a good team and we shall give them every respect."""
893,26/09/2015,19:47,PSG overcome poor start to stroll past Nantes,Paris Saint-Germain recovered from a sluggish start at Nantes on Saturday as they came from behind to record a 4-1 victory that provisionally stretched their lead to four points at the top of Ligue 1.,"Yacine Bammou had nodded Nantes into an 11th-minute lead at the Stade de la Beaujoire but Zlatan Ibrahimovic equalised for the reigning champions just after half-time. Edinson Cavani then came off the bench to notch his league-leading sixth goal of the season as PSG went ahead on 73 minutes before Angel Di Maria added a third with Serge Aurier also getting on the scoresheet. Laurent Blanc stuck with his rotation policy, ahead of week's trip to Ukraine to face Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League, as Cavani, Blaise Matuidi, Thiago Motta and Maxwell were all left out of the starting line-up. PSG had recorded seven straight victories against Nantes in the league but the visitors fell behind early on Saturday after Javier Pastore was dispossessed just outside own area and Valentin Rongier's cross was expertly converted by Bammou. PSG rode their luck and were fortunate not to concede a second just a few minutes later as Bammou nipped in ahead of Thiago Silva to connect with Alejandro Bedoya's near-post delivery only for his header to come back off the post. Nantes had scored just twice in six matches prior to the weekend but were creating plenty of chances as Jules Iloki then scuffed wide with just Kevin Trapp to beat after being played in by Rongier. Having failed to capitalise on several openings Nantes were pegged back on 48 minutes as Pastore played a floated ball into the area, and although Di Maria's volley was cleared off the line, Ibrahimovic was on hand to bundle in the rebound to draw to within one goal of Pauleta's club record of 109. Blanc introduced Cavani for Lucas Moura just past the hour and the Uruguayan made an immediate impact as he rose to flick in a Di Maria free-kick at the near post to give PSG the lead. Di Maria then netted his second goal in as many matches after racing onto Pastore's ball over the top and lobbing onrushing Nantes 'keeper Remy Riou. There was time for Aurier, back from suspension, to add further gloss to the scoreline on 90 minutes as the Ivorian acrobatically volleyed in a Pastore corner. Later, Lyon go to a Bordeaux side still licking their wounds following a midweek 6-1 thrashing at Nice, while fourth-placed Rennes take on winless Troyes. Saint-Etienne will aim to trim PSG's lead back to a single point on Sunday when they host Nice with Marseille, hit with a partial stadium ban following last week's crowd trouble, taking on Angers and Monaco going to Guingamp. David N'Gog struck the only goal for Reims in a 1-0 win on Friday that lifted them to third."
894,25/09/2015,17:06,PSG coach Blanc prioritising Europe,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc admitted on Friday that his side may have to ""let go"" of one of the domestic cup competitions if they are to achieve their dream of winning the Champions League.","PSG won a clean sweep of the domestic trophies last season, taking the French Cup and League Cup as well as the Ligue 1 title. However, they were eliminated from the Champions League at the quarter-final stage for the third season running, the absence of key players due to injury and suspension costing them against eventual European champions Barcelona. ""We will try to manage training sessions, workloads and rotations, but we will maybe need to let go of one of the national cup competitions, or at least not put everything into them. Even if that will be difficult,"" Blanc told a press conference on Friday. ""Have you seen the dates for the national cups? They are catastrophic for us in terms of the Champions League."" However, Blanc added: ""There is no one truth when it comes to the Champions League, no one way of guaranteeing you will go very far. ""The most important thing is to have your best players on top form in April, May, when everything is decided."" Paris, who are top of Ligue 1 and unbeaten after seven games, go to Nantes on Saturday before travelling to Ukraine to face Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League next Wednesday."
895,25/09/2015,02:15,Dominant PSG target elusive European success,The Ligue 1 season may only be seven matches old but the question already being asked in France is whether any of the other 19 top flight clubs can make a serious challenge to three-time defending champions Paris Saint-Germain.,"After Laurent Blanc guided the Qatar-backed capital club to a treble of domestic trophies last season (championship, French Cup, League Cup), the team are off to an unbeaten start to this campaign. But the Parc des Princes outfit, who brushed aside Guingamp 3-0 in midweek to preserve a one point lead at the top over Saint-Etienne, have made no bones of the fact their main priority remains winning a first ever Champions League title. Three consecutive runs to the quarter-finals, twice knocked out by Barcelona and once by Chelsea, has left a bad taste and the task at hand this season is to better that record and reach next May's final in Milan. The team are ticking along nicely in domestic action and new signing Angel Di Maria opened his league scoring account on Tuesday as the club improved their unbeaten start to five wins and two draws with a goal-difference of plus-10. Former PSG midfielder and French international Luis Fernandez has little doubt where the title will be come the end of the Ligue 1 campaign. ""They will be champions, don't worry about that,"" said the 55-year-old who also enjoyed two spells as coach of PSG, guiding the club to the 1996 Cup Winners' Cup, their only European conquest. ""(Angel) Di Maria clicked well with (Marco) Verratti against Malmo (in their opening 2-0 Champions League group win) but maybe they have to change things at the back,"" added Fernandez who admits Europe's biggest competition is on everyone's mind. PSG will travel to Ukraine and a testing Champions League tie against Shakhtar Donetsk on Tuesday before Real Madrid come to Paris on October 21. ""For me they are already in preparation (for the Champions League). We will know in March if Laurent (Blanc) has got it right."" The task at hand this weekend will be garnering another three points when they travel to fourth-from-bottom Nantes. Bitter rivals Marseille are yet to hit top gear and with the departure of coach Marcelo Bielsa and disturbing crowd trouble at last week's home draw against Lyon, Saint-Etienne have emerged as the closest challengers to PSG's throne. Christophe Galtier's side improved to five wins, one defeat and a draw in midweek with a 1-0 win at promoted Troyes and the 'Greens' can keep the pressure on PSG with a win at home to surging Nice on Sunday evening. Rennes are enjoying a great start to the Ligue 1 season but dropped two points at minnows Ajaccio in a 1-1 draw on Wednesday, and lie three points back, ahead of Saturday's home tie against Troyes. Seven-time champions Lyon, are also yet to hit full stride and will have one eye on their key Champions League fixture against former finalists Valencia on Wednesday. They travel to a Bordeaux side licking its wounds after they were thrashed 6-1 by a Hatem Ben Arfa-inspired Nice in midweek. Hubert Fournier's team are still coming to terms with the loss of long-term injury casualty and French international Nabil Fekir as well as the stuttering goal-scoring form of last season's player of the year Alexandre Lacazette (one goal this season).

896,22/09/2015,23:09,Ibrahimovic off the mark as PSG ease past Guingamp,Zlatan Ibrahimovic ended his goal drought as Paris Saint-Germain extended their unbeaten start to the Ligue 1 season on Tuesday with a 3-0 victory at home to Guingamp.,"Javier Pastore gave PSG a first-half lead at the Parc des Princes before Angel Di Maria netted his first goal in domestic French football to double the advantage. Ibrahimovic, who hadn't scored since claiming a brace in a 6-0 win over Guingamp last May, added a third late on but also had a penalty saved as the reigning champions provisionally moved four points clear at the top of the table. PSG coach Laurent Blanc had defended his decision to rotate his squad in successive draws but the capital club were almost at full strength on Tuesday with the exception of rested duo Thiago Silva and Marco Verratti. Edinson Cavani, whose league-leading fifth goal salvaged a point for PSG in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Reims, nearly added to his tally inside five minutes but Guingamp goalkeeper Jonas Lossl made a terrific stop to deny the Uruguayan. Last season's 6-0 drubbing in the corresponding fixture prompted Guingamp coach Jocelyn Gourvennec to adopt a conservative approach with Jimmy Briand and Sloan Privat, both on target at the weekend in a 2-1 win over Gazelec Ajaccio, left on the bench. But PSG needed just 18 minutes to break the deadlock as Ibrahimovic found Pastore in space and the Argentine glided towards the edge of the penalty area unchallenged before slotting a precise low finish out of the reach of Lossl. Ibrahimovic went perilously close to doubling the advantage moments later as the Swede's curling left-foot strike flashed narrowly wide of the far post. Another chance fell to Ibrahimovic after a clever one-two with Cavani but this time the striker's deflected effort was palmed away well by Lossl. Yannis Salibur's dipping long-range free-kick called PSG goalkeeper Kevin Trapp into action just before the break but the home side resumed their dominance after half-time. First, Ibrahimovic had a thunderous free-kick fisted away by Lossl with the Swede again left frustrated as Laurent dos Santos rushed back to clear off the line after PSG's stand-in skipper had slipped the ball past Lossl from a tight angle. It was a busy night for the Guingamp custodian as the Dane made another fine save to prevent Pastore from adding his second but Lossl was culpable as PSG did eventually double their advantage on 77 minutes. Ibrahimovic cut in from the right and after his low drive was spilled by the visiting keeper, Di Maria was quickest to react to the rebound for his first Ligue 1 goal. Di Maria then provided the pass for Ibrahimovic to score his first goal of the season with the Swede poking just inside the far post seven minutes from time. Ibrahimovic could have added a fourth after Cavani was tripped by Salibur but he saw his spot-kick kept out by Lossl. Earlier, Angers and Reims drew 0-0, leaving both sides still with just one defeat through their first seven matches. Rennes and Saint-Etienne can both trim PSG's lead back to a single point when they visit Gazelec Ajaccio and Troyes respectively on Wednesday, while Lyon host Bastia and Marseille travel to Toulouse."
897,21/09/2015,12:03,Concerns as violence hits French league,French sports minister Thierry Braillard on Monday called for tougher controls as violence marred Ligue 1 action in France at the weekend just months ahead of Euro 2016.,"The clash between Marseille and Lyon in the Velodrome Stadium on Sunday night was restarted after a 20-minute stoppage caused by missile-throwing fans, while there were also incidents during Saturday's Ligue 1 match between Bastia and Nice in Corsica as Paris Saint-Germain's fans caused trouble in the streets of Reims after a 1-1 draw. Months ahead of the kickoff of Euro 2016 in France on June 10, an emergency meeting has been called by the French Professional Football League (LFP) in their Paris headquarters on Monday to assess the situation. ""We are after all months from a tremendous event which is the organisation of the European football championship and I really call for everyone to assess what happened,"" Braillard told French radio RTL. The return of Lyon's Mathieu Valbuena to face his former club had already made for a charged atmosphere in the southern port city. Lyon were leading 1-0 when play was interrupted as objects, including bottles and cups, rained down from the stands. The game was restarted after a 20-minute stoppage and finished in a 1-1 draw. ""This is unacceptable and I think we really need to have much firmer controls,"" said Braillard. ""Marseille is a footballing city. The Marseille public is known to be a great public. I think there are security measures that must be respected and we can't see glass bottles like that in the stands. ""Where are we going? Imagine that a bottle had struck a player! What situation would we be in today? It's unacceptable and I think that we really need to tighten up controls."" In addition to the club facing a hefty fine, Marseille president Vincent Labrune, could also be punished for his comments blaming the ""incidents"" on biased referring. ""There was a great stadium, a great atmosphere. And there was unfortunately the facts of the game which led to one or two incidents it's true,"" said Labrune. ""We had a remarkable refereeing quartet, they didn't do it on purpose but from what I saw it was always, always in the same direction,"" he added. The atmosphere was further fueled by an ongoing feud between the club presidents with Lyon boss Jean-Michel Aulas criticising his Marseille counterpart. ""The words of Vincent Labrune are irresponsible, for me he is a clown, and I don't think he has a future in football."" In Bastia, local authorities had once again banned Nice fans from attending the game at the Furiani Stadium because of multiple incidents over the years between the two clubs."
898,16/09/2015,02:10,"Blanc satisfied with PSG start, Di Maria impact",Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc admitted bigger tests await his side after they began their Champions League campaign with a 2-0 win against Malmo on Tuesday.,"Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani got the goals as PSG, quarter-finalists in each of the last three seasons, saw off the Swedish champions at the Parc des Princes in Group A. But Paris face a fight with Real Madrid for supremacy in the section, and the Spanish giants underlined their credentials by brushing aside Shakhtar Donetsk 4-0 in the night's other game as Cristiano Ronaldo netted yet another hat-trick. ""It's easy to compare after the first match. We will see at the end of the group stage. The two home teams have won, but our next matches will be away from home,"" said Blanc, whose side visit Ukraine next while Madrid go to Malmo. ""We need to make sure we get points away from home, although not every team playing at home managed to win tonight."" Meanwhile, Blanc warned that Di Maria is still some way short of his best form after handing the Argentine just his second start since signing from Manchester United last month. ""Angel is still building himself up. He arrived late after the Copa America and he was carrying a hamstring injury. I think we were right to let him rest at first rather than rush him in,"" said Blanc of the winger brought in to help take Paris to the next level in Europe. ""He needs games because, let's not forget, it was just his second start. ""He is clever in front of goal. He can bring us quality with his passing but I also think he can score a certain number of goals over the course of a season. ""We were very good down the right with Gregory (van der Wiel) and Marco (Verratti) and Angel. It augurs well."" It was not quite such a good night for Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who returned after injury to face his hometown team and the club with whom he started his career but missed a handful of chances in the first period and was eventually substituted 15 minutes from the end. ""I decided to take him off because, when you come back, you start to get tired after about 70 minutes, and he is also of a certain age,"" Blanc said of the 33-year-old striker, who had an abdominal injury. ""He could have finished the match but that would have perhaps been taking a pointless risk. We have attacking players on the bench who could come on so I'd be stupid not to use them."" Malmo coach Age Hareide was magnanimous in defeat. ""Our last Champions League game was in December last year. Since then we have only played in the Swedish league which is not the same level. The qualifiers are not enough,"" said the Norwegian. ""Hats off to Paris. It was a magnificent match from them. ""We need to be realistic. We will battle for third place. That's important as it gives access to the Europa League,"" added Hareide. ""We have Real Madrid up next and we are much better at home than away from home. Unfortunately we concede too many goals away from home and we absolutely need to learn how to close the door."""
899,15/09/2015,22:39,"Di Maria, Cavani strike as PSG see off Malmo",Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on target as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League campaign with an ultimately comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.,"Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player to set the French champions on their way, but they missed a succession of opportunities before finally extending their advantage when Cavani headed home in the 61st minute. With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions as they target not just qualification for the knockout rounds but an improvement on their runs to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns. But while they got the points, it was far from a vintage display by Laurent Blanc's side with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasteful in front of goal and later being substituted against his hometown team and the club with whom he started his illustrious career back in 1999. The Swedish striker returned after injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that had been held to a 2-2 draw at home by Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but he was upstaged in the fourth minute by Di Maria. The Argentina winger was labelled as the man to take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was signed from Manchester United last month, and he indicated why as he ran onto Marco Verratti's pass in behind the Malmo defence before angling a beautiful finish past Johan Wiland and into the far corner of the net. However, if anyone then expected PSG to romp to a big victory, they were to be disappointed. Malmo, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, lined up with nine full internationals on the field at kick-off and, with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield, were stuffy opponents. But, save for a Nikola Djurdjic shot that slid just wide of Kevin Trapp's far post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack. Instead, PSG let themselves down at times with wasteful passing and poor finishing, not least from Ibrahimovic, who failed to convert no fewer than five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cavani just after the restart. Nevertheless, he proved much more adept when it came to setting up his colleagues, and it was from an Ibrahimovic pass that Di Maria sent in a curling shot which was tipped around the post by Wiland on 52 minutes. The second goal finally arrived just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan heading home his sixth of the season after Ibrahimovic had flicked on a left-wing cross from Maxwell. That ended any ideas that Malmo had of coming back into the game, and only a superb stop by Wiland from point-blank range to deny David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had a goal disallowed right at the death."
900,15/09/2015,21:09,Di Maria scores opening goal of Champs League season,Angel Di Maria started repaying his massive transfer fee as he scored the opening goal of the new Champions League season for Paris Saint-Germain against Malmo on Tuesday.,The 27-year-old was bought by the French champions for 63 million euros ($68.9 million) at the start of the season with the specific aim of helping them win the Champions League following three successive quarter-final exits. Di Maria scored in the fourth minute after collecting a pass form Italy midfielder Marco Verratti. It was the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star's first goal in his third appearance for PSG.
901,14/09/2015,02:15,Ibrahimovic faces first club as PSG host Malmo,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic gets the chance to face his hometown club, and the team with whom he started his career, as Paris Saint-Germain begin their Champions League campaign against Malmo on Tuesday.","The French champions and the Swedish title-holders meet at the Parc des Princes in the opening round of games in Group A, and with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in the section, PSG can ill afford a slip-up. It will be a particularly special occasion for Ibrahimovic, who grew up in the southern Swedish city and scored 16 goals in 40 league appearances for Malmo before moving to Ajax in 2001, later enjoying illustrious spells with Juventus, Inter Milan, AC Milan and Barcelona. After Malmo beat Celtic 4-3 on aggregate to qualify for the group stage, Ibrahimovic, now 33, wrote on Twitter: ""One day I hope to experience the Champions League in Malmo on the pitch. Congratulations!"" The return match in Sweden is not until November, but in the meantime Ibrahimovic will be eager to help his current side get off to a winning start in Europe, and get among the goals -- he is presently just three shy of Pauleta's club record tally of 109. The striker missed Friday's 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in Ligue 1 due to an abdominal injury suffered on international duty last week, but Paris coach Laurent Blanc stressed that Ibrahimovic wanted to save himself for Malmo. In his absence, Paris dropped points for the first time in Ligue 1 this season, two catastrophic errors from German goalkeeper Kevin Trapp gifting Bordeaux goals in reply to Edinson Cavani's brace for PSG. ""We need to move on, although we also need to analyse the reasons why we drew. It's a different competition, a different opponent, but we will need to be much more rigorous and disciplined against Malmo,"" warned Blanc. Javier Pastore is a doubt with a calf problem and Serge Aurier is suspended for Paris, who are dreaming of going all the way in the Champions League this season after being eliminated in the quarter-finals in each of the last three years. Their home record in Europe is excellent, with the 3-1 loss to eventual winners Barcelona in the quarter-final, first leg in April their first defeat in 34 matches in the French capital in continental competition going back to 2006. Malmo finished bottom of their Champions League group last season, losing five out of six games, and they head to France on the back of a 1-1 draw at home to Elfsborg that left them fifth in the Swedish top flight. With only seven games of the season remaining, a third consecutive title looks to be beyond them. However, Norwegian coach Age Hareide will be hoping Malmo, beaten European Cup finalists in 1979, can reproduce the performances that took them through three rounds of qualifying to reach the group stage. ""They are huge favourites and have world class players in every position, but we showed against Salzburg and Celtic that we have the level,"" Swedish international defender Anton Tinnerholm told local newspaper Sydsvenskan. Malmo, whose star man is former Ajax and Werder Bremen striker Markus Rosenberg, are without Agon Mehmeti due to a foot injury."
902,11/09/2015,22:43,Trapp nightmare as PSG held by Bordeaux,Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Kevin Trapp endured a nightmare evening as the reigning French champions saw their perfect start to the season ended in a 2-2 draw with 10-man Bordeaux on Friday.,"PSG had looked set to make it five straight Ligue 1 wins to start the campaign thanks to an Edinson Cavani first-half brace either side of Henri Saivet's equaliser. However, German goalkeeper Trapp, who had already been at fault at the first goal, was caught in possession in the box by Wahbi Khazri with 11 minutes left, allowing the Bordeaux player to snatch a point for his side. It was a sweet result for the visitors, who had been forced to take the metro earlier in the day when their bus broke down and were reduced to 10 men shortly before their second goal when skipper Saivet was sent off. And the result denied PSG what would have been a record-equalling 14th successive win in France's top flight. Ironically, that record is still held by the 2009 Bordeaux side coached by current Paris boss Laurent Blanc, and Les Girondins were the last team to take anything from the capital club in the league back in March. That day, their 3-2 victory in south-western France was overshadowed by an extraordinary rant by Zlatan Ibrahimovic at the match officials. And Bordeaux's performance here was overshadowed by the disastrous display by Trapp, who had previously not conceded a goal since signing in the summer from Eintracht Frankfurt to usurp Salvatore Sirigu. ""He is a goalkeeper who takes lots of risks. I ask him to take risks. I hope next time things will turn out better for him, but he won't change his way of playing,"" said Blanc. ""That's football. We could have played the same game and won, but it wouldn't change my analysis. We were not good enough in lots of areas."" Bordeaux coach Willy Sagnol added: ""The players showed great spirit and never gave up but both goalkeepers gave out gifts today. It was German goodwill (from Trapp) to help with his adaptation in France."" Ibrahimovic was not involved here, the Swede resting after suffering an abdominal injury on international duty and eager to return against his old club Malmo in the Champions League next Tuesday. However, Angel di Maria made his first PSG start, lining up on the right of a front three also featuring Cavani and Lucas. Di Maria was lively, constantly weaving his way into central positions from the right flank, but it was Cavani who opened the scoring just past the midway point in the first period after a moment Bordeaux goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso will want to forget. When he fumbled a harmless ball inside the area, Cavani pounced, controlling and volleying high into the net. The former Marseille shot-stopper was taunted by the PSG fans, but Bordeaux were back level on the half-hour mark courtesy of more suspect goalkeeping, this time from Trapp. Khazri's left-wing corner was helped on by Saivet at the near post, but it was Trapp who got the decisive final touch, fumbling the ball over the line when he really should have saved. Nevertheless, the match quickly swung back the home side's way, and Cavani restored their lead on 34 minutes, his 25-yard free-kick not right in the corner but leaving Carrasso rooted to the spot regardless. Carrasso then redeemed himself for his earlier error with a crucial save to deny Di Maria a first goal in French football just before the interval after Nicolas Pallois had been caught in possession by Lucas. And Trapp then made up for his mistake at the equaliser by getting a vital touch to a net-bound Enzo Crivelli header and taking the ball away from debutant Brazilian defender Pablo, who was arriving at the back post. Bordeaux's hopes appeared to have gone when Saivet was sent off for a second yellow card shown for a foul on Marco Verratti 13 minutes from the end. But almost immediately the visitors were level, Khazri charging down Trapp and stealing the ball off the German's toe to stab into an empty net."

""He is not in the best of states. He picked up an injury with Sweden, but he could have played against Bordeaux, although he won't. We have decided to rest him so he will be on top form against Malmo,"" Blanc told a press conference on Thursday ahead of Friday's match at the Parc des Princes. Ibrahimovic is eager to play against Malmo, his hometown team and the club where he started his career before joining Ajax in 2001. PSG are top of the Ligue 1 table with 12 points having won four games out of four."

905,10/09/2015,02:15,Blossoming Matuidi bids to keep PSG perfect,French champions Paris Saint-Germain and dynamic midfielder Blaise Matuidi will aim to extend their perfect start to the Ligue 1 season on Friday night at home to a depleted Bordeaux.,"Laurent Blanc's men have collected maximum points through their first four matches with France international Matuidi playing an integral role in their early success. The 28-year-old has had a hand in four of the club's seven goals so far, notably netting the opener in a 2-0 victory over Gazelec Ajaccio before his second-half strike earned PSG all three points in a 1-0 win at Montpellier a week later. Matuidi's exploits haven't been limited to Ligue 1 either with the Frenchman in sparkling form on the international stage as well. His brace against Serbia on Monday, the second goal a stunning long-range volley, steered the Euro 2016 hosts to a 2-1 win in Bordeaux and prompted fellow Les Bleus midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin to label him as PSG's key man. ""He is such a good player. He is maybe not the grandest name in the PSG team but, in my view, he is the most important player in that team,"" said Schneiderlin, in quotes published by French sports daily L'Equipe. ""He is now scoring goals, which completes his game,"" added the Manchester United midfielder. Angel di Maria stayed in Paris over the international break after being left out of Argentina's squad to allow him to work on his fitness and could also make his first start for PSG against a Bordeaux side still missing the likes of Cheick Diabate and Lamine Sane as well as the suspended Clement Chantome. While PSG have a refreshed Di Maria to look forward to, Lyon were dealt a cruel blow with Nabil Fekir, the league's leading scorer this term, set for around six months on the sidelines after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in last Friday's 1-0 friendly victory over Portugal in Lisbon. Fekir's hat-trick again Caen last time out left Lyon, who went toe-to-toe with PSG until the final month in last year's title race, on seven points through four matches but his injury deprives coach Hubert Fournier of a key man going into Saturday's meeting with Lille. Rules in France's top flight enable a club to sign a player outside the transfer window in the case of such an injury but Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas has ruled out drafting in a replacement. ""We said to ourselves that to sign a new player when Nabil is going to have an operation would not be the best thing,"" said Aulas in an interview on the club's website. ""After discussions .. we're all in agreement that we have great confidence in the group. We have Alex (Lacazette) and Claudio (Beauvue). There is also Maxwell (Cornet) who has impressed everyone and Aldo (Kalulu),"" he added. The honeymoon period for Marseille and new coach Michel was abruptly ended by defeat at previously pointless Guingamp in their last outing with Bastia next up for OM on Sunday. Monaco will begin the post-Anthony Martial era against Gazelec Ajaccio in Corsica while second-placed Reims visit Toulouse as Rennes, also on nine points, head to Nantes. Angers, just one of two remaining unbeaten outfits and the only one of the three promoted sides with a victory this season, travel to winless Lorient. Fixtures (kick-offs 1800 GMT unless stated)"

""The Foundation will transfer one million euros to these organisations that will be funded by club revenue."" The announcement on Wednesday follows a series of donations and projects put into place by top clubs around the world such as Real Madrid, Roma and Bayern Munich after the arrival of thousands of refugees, many from war-ravaged Syria, into Europe over the past weeks. Following Roma's gesture to donate 575,000 euros as well as jerseys worn by stars Francesco Totti, Edin Dzeko and Miralem Pjanic to the newly-launched ""Football Cares"" auction site, the European Association of football clubs (ECA) announced a generous plan involving teams playing in the Champions League and Europa League. Clubs have committed to giving one euro per ticket sold in their first continental matches this season, the ECA announced. All 80 clubs have committed to the initiative with the money -- estimated between 2-3 million euros going into a fund created by the ECA. Elsewhere, Bayern Munich stars Javier Martinez and Mario Goetze appealed for internet users on Twitter to join the solidarity movement to help the masses of refugees from as far as Syria, Iraq and Somalia who have been arriving in Munich since last weekend. ""Today, I continue with #RefugeesWelcome. We are involved in this challenge,"" wrote Martinez, who handed out clothes and footballs to refugees at the city train station last weekend, while other Bundesliga clubs, such as Borussia Dortmund, Schalke, Mainz and Borussia Moenchengladbach have made substantial donations. On Saturday, Real Madrid announced a donation of one million euros to refugees that have arrived in Spain and provided shelter while Bayern Munich announced a similar proposal and also introduced other money-making projects."

It's Mino (Raiola), my agent, who looks after that. You need to ask him,"" said the 33-year-old Swede at a press conference near Stockholm, where is currently on international duty. ""If I wanted something to happen, I would have got involved. I preferred to rest, enjoy my holidays, look after my family. But I know Milan were a bit desperate. ""What I can say is that I took it as a compliment that there might be interest in me."" Ibrahimovic, who played for Milan from 2010 to 2012 and won the Serie A title in his first season with the club, added: ""It was concrete from them. And they were really interested in me from the start. ""I am going to stay at PSG and I'm happy there. We have a good team and the family are happy."" Ibrahimovic is in the final season of his contract at PSG and, when asked about his future plans, he simply replied: ""We will see."" Ibrahimovic and Sweden are preparing to play Russia in Moscow on Saturday in a crucial Euro 2016 qualifier before hosting Austria next Tuesday."
908,30/08/2015,22:57,Cavani steals Di Maria's thunder as PSG win,Angel di Maria made his debut as a second half substitute as champions Paris Saint-Germain maintained their perfect start to the season with a 3-0 win at Monaco on Sunday.,"Argentine Di Maria played his first 24 minutes for the Parisians following a 63 million-euro ($68.9 million) move from Manchester United and even set up PSG's final goal. But it was Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani who was the hero, notching a brace before Ezequiel Lavezzi finished off the scoring. Cavani's first was a bullet header into the top corner and the second a simple side-foot finish from 12 yards. The win put PSG three points clear of the pack as Monaco remained in mid-table. Cavani had the best chance of the opening period a couple of minutes before the break, but picked out by Maxwell's inch-perfect pass, he swiped wildly at the ball, which hit his standing leg before bobbling wide. Monaco's Italian striker Stephan El Shaarawy had a sight of goal early in the second period but shot straight at goalkeeper Kevin Trapp. Cavani broke the deadlock on 57 minutes with a bullet header into the top corner from Blaise Matuidi's pinpoint cross, leaving goalkeeper Danijel Subasic a helpless spectator. Moments later, Matuidi blew a one-on-one chance with Subasic with a poor first touch before the goalkeeper eventually saved his tame, low, curling shot. Di Maria entered the fray on 66 minutes in the place of Lucas Moura and should have had his first assist for the club almost immediately, but after arrowing an inch-perfect ball into the box, Cavani directed his free header straight at Subosic. But Cavani did not need to wait long for his second and showed a predator's instincts on 73 minutes as Monaco's backline stood off Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who slipped in the Uruguayan between full-back and centre-back for an easy finish. Serge Aurier squandered a great chance with a sliced shot after bursting into the box although Cavani was in perfect position in front of goal to complete his hat-trick. But seven minutes from time, substitute Lavezzi, who'd replaced Ibrahimovic, ran onto a searing long ball from Di Maria to lash home a thunderous volley. Earlier on Sunday, Saint-Etienne scored either side of half-time to defeat Bastia 2-1 at their Geoffroy-Guichard stadium to end the Corsicans' unbeaten start to the Ligue 1 season. Just three days after qualifying for the Europa League group phase, Christophe Galtier guided his side to a second win of the early domestic season thanks to a 20th minute strike from captain Loic Perrin and then a 62nd minute winner from on-loan Valentin Eysseric. Bastia had pulled level four minutes before the break through Gael Danic but slip to sixth in the table after their first defeat in four outings. Bordeaux picked up their first win of the season with a 2-0 victory over Nantes in a battle of former champions. Tunisian midfielder Wahbi Khazri grabbed the all-important opener right on the stroke of half-time before 19-year-old Serbian defender Milan Gajic wrapped up the victory with a strike three minutes from time. The defeat was the first of the season for the Canaries. On Saturday, Lyon returned to winning ways as they rode a Nabil Fekir hat-trick to a 4-0 thrashing away to Caen while Rennes claimed their place in the top three with a 3-1 home victory over Toulouse. Reims are second on goal difference following a 4-1 dismantling of suffering Brittany side Lorient, while Lille won for the first time under new coach Herve Renard when they edged Ajaccio 1-0. On Friday, Marseille came back to earth with a thud following their 6-0 thrashing of Troyes last week in new coach Michel's first match in charge, but it all went wrong at Guingamp where they slumped to a 2-0 reverse."

""I'm very happy to join such an ambitious club as Paris Saint-Germain,"" Kurzawa told PSG's website. The amount of the deal was not revealed by PSG but French media reported it was worth in the region of EUR24 million ($27m) ""I'm going to continue my apprenticeship at the highest level beside players who are among the best in the world,"" said Kurzawa who has two caps for France.

Monaco meanwhile must overcome a Champions League hangover after being knocked out of the competition at the last qualifying stage on Wednesday by Valencia, despite reaching the quarter-finals last season. Marseille began life without Marcelo Bielsa, who dropped a bombshell by resigning after an opening day defeat against Caen, by showing signs of an immediate resurrection under Madrid-born Michel when they destroyed Troyes 6-0 last weekend. The hugely popular south-coast club will try to make it two wins from two when they head up to Brittany and a Friday evening date with Guingamp. But they will still have to do without former France international Abou Diaby, whom they signed from Arsenal, who is not yet match-fit. ""I have spoken with him and he is full of motivation,"" said Michel. ""I think in two or three weeks he will be ready to reintegrate into the squad,"" added the 52-year-old former Spain international. PSG will know their Champions League group phase opponents on Thursday when the draw is made in Switzerland and the top prize in European football remains a prime goal for the Qatari-backed capital side. ""To win the Champions League is our objective,"" confided Brazilian defender David Luiz. ""It will not only depend on our preparation but also the luck or bad luck we get with the draw,"" said the former Chelsea centre-back. Bastia will travel to Saint-Etienne on Sunday as the 'Greens' look to recover from Europa League duty at home to Moldovan outsiders Milsami on Thursday. Angers, from the northwest of France, toasted their finest hour in 1957 when they were beaten 6-3 by Toulouse in the French Cup final, but under former player Stephane Moulin they have garnered two wins and a draw from their first three top flight outings as they host Nice on Saturday. Nantes meanwhile are off to a fine start of their own and the eight-time French champions, who last lifted the title in 2001, travel to winless Bordeaux. Former French player of the year Yoann Gourcuff, who has fallen from grace following a series of injuries that marred his time at Lyon, is back in the news and on the verge of signing with Rennes. The son of current Algeria coach Christian Gourcuff is unlikely to make his debut in time to face Toulouse at home on Saturday but his signature is imminent and will be a huge boost to the two-time French Cup winners. Elsewhere, last year's runners-up Lyon travel to Caen with four points from three matches, while Reims await Lorient, Troyes are at home to 2012 champions Montpellier and Herve Renard's Lille entertain GFC Ajaccio.

911,26/08/2015,18:44,PSG's Digne seals Roma loan move,Serie A side Roma continued to shore up their defence on Wednesday with Paris Saint Germain French international left-back Lucas Digne completing his loan move to the capital club.,"After completing a medical, Digne, 22, signed with the Giallorossi in a one-year deal that will see Roma pay PSG 2.5m euros and could end up with the 22-year-old making the move permanent. Key to the transfer was Roma coach Rudi Garcia, who while in charge of PSG's Ligue 1 rivals Lille handed Digne his first-team debut for the club in 2011. Digne, who was a member of the France Under-20 side crowned world champions in 2013, told Roma TV: ""I chose Roma because it's a legendary club with a great history. I know that in this city and at this club there's everything you need to succeed."" It was at Lille that Digne, despite still being a teenager, first impressed and in his second season with the northern French club he made seven appearances in the Champions League. Digne signed a five-year deal with PSG two seasons ago and in his short time with the capital club won two league titles and the French Cup. Garcia -- who has guided Roma to two successive runners-up finishes behind Juventus in Serie A -- admitted two weeks ago strengthening his defence was a priority after the club sold Greek international Jose Holebas to newly-promoted English Premier League side Watford and French defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa joined Lyon. Since then they have signed Slovakian Norbert Gyomber from Catania on a season-long loan deal, which includes an option to make the transfer permanent. VfB Stuttgart defender Antonio Ruediger was also signed on a similar deal last week. The recent arrivals have left a question mark over the future of former Chelsea defender Ashley Cole, who is still a Roma player. Cole was given his chance to shine last season but was spectacularly exposed during a stunning 7-1 home defeat to Bayern Munich in the group stages of the Champions League. He was given few opportunities by Garcia in the wake of his poor performance and has been linked with a move away from the club. Roma, held to a 1-1 draw away at Verona in their league opener on Saturday, host champions Juventus this weekend."
912,21/08/2015,22:39,Matuidi strikes to maintain PSG's perfect start,A second-half strike by the excellent Blaise Matuidi gave Paris Saint-Germain a 1-0 win away to Montpellier on Friday as the French champions maintained their perfect start to the new Ligue 1 season.,"Matuidi's 61st-minute goal gave PSG a win that they deserved for their dominance of possession in a match of few chances on a hot night at the Stade de la Mosson. The capital club have won their opening three games of the campaign, all without conceding a goal, making this their best start to a season since 1999. And this result also allowed them to extend their club record run of consecutive Ligue 1 wins to 12, meaning they are now just two more victories short of levelling the overall record held by the Bordeaux side of 2009 that won the title. Laurent Blanc was the coach of that Bordeaux team and his current PSG side look a cut above the rest of France already this season, although in Montpellier they were facing opponents who had already lost their opening two matches without scoring a goal. David Luiz came close to giving PSG an early lead, his dipping and swerving free-kick being beaten away by Jonathan Ligali in the Montpellier goal. The visitors were then dealt a blow as Javier Pastore was forced off with an apparent calf injury inside 10 minutes, his place being taken by Adrien Rabiot. Chances were and few between, with Ezequiel Lavezzi stabbing a shot wide after pouncing on a Jonas Martin mistake on the edge of the box seven minutes before the interval. Edinson Cavani had the ball in the net shortly after the restart only to be denied by a marginal offside call, while before that Kevin Trapp, the summer signing from Eintracht Frankfurt, excelled at the other end with a fine save to tip over Ramy Bensebaini's header. The only goal arrived just after the hour mark, Maxwell exchanging passes with Lavezzi before feeding Matuidi, whose left-foot shot beat Ligali at his near post. It was a second goal in as many games for the tireless France midfielder, who opened the scoring in the 2-0 victory over Gazelec Ajaccio last weekend, and it secured a club-record sixth straight away win in the top flight. On Saturday, last season's runners-up Lyon host Rennes before Monaco, beaten 3-1 at Valencia in the first leg of their Champions League play-off in midweek, entertain Toulouse. Marseille, beaten in each of their opening two matches, play their first game under newly-appointed Spanish coach Michel at home against Troyes on Sunday."
913,20/08/2015,13:14,"Perfect PSG wait on Zlatan, di Maria",Paris Saint-Germain come calling on bottom-club Montpellier on Friday intent on retaining their perfect start to the new Ligue 1 season.,"Laurent Blanc's reigning French champions haven't put a foot wrong in their pursuit of a fourth straight league trophy so far. Their championship run began in 2013 when they succeeded the team they face on Friday as title-holders. A rare season-opening success over Lille followed by last weekend's 2-0 defeat of Corsican newcomers Gazelac Ajaccio has left PSG in familiar surroundings, on top of the pile, in company with Reims and Caen. The big question mark for PSG fans, and Montpellier, is whether Zlatan Ibrahimovic will take to the pitch. The Swedish striker has missed out on the opening skirmishes with a right knee sprain. He took part in training on Wednesday but is by no means certain to be judged fit enough to line up. Similar doubts hang over the participation of Argentina winger Angel di Maria. The 63 million-euro (£44.3m; $68.9m) signing from Manchester United was introduced to the Paris fans before kick-off at the Parc des Princes last weekend, but was not fit enough to make his debut. Di Maria continues his race for full fitness after coming away from Argentina's defeat to hosts Chile in the Copa America final with a thigh injury. PSG have nothing to fear from recent history with Montpellier's last home win over the capital club back in 2003. While the glory days of of 2012 may seem a long way off Montpellier, under charismatic coach Rolland Courbis, took a respectable seventh place last term. They owe their position at the foot of the table on two defeats, to Rennes and Angers. The strain of their poor start appears to be taking its toll with Montpellier president Louis Nicollin questioning coach Courbis's pre-season preparations. ""I adore Courbis but his notion of not playing any friendly games concerns me as I'd predicted (a bad start). Now I don't know when it's going to stop. I'm scared."" Courbis responded: ""I read what he (Nicollin) had to say, I found what he said hard, but it's logical he's not happy. ""If we're going to trouble PSG we have to all remain solid."" Monaco, who are up against it to make the Chamnpions League group phase after a first leg 3-1 play-off loss to Valencia in midweek, are in action on Saturday at Toulouse. In other games Lyon, who ran Monaco closest last term, host Rennes, Reims are on the road at Nantes while Caen make the long trip south to Nice. Marseille, under new Spanish coach Michel, are in action against Troyes on Sunday."

Argentina winger Angel di Maria, the 63 million-euro (£44.3m; $68.9m) signing from Manchester United, was introduced to the Paris fans before kick-off, although he was not yet fit enough to make his debut. And with Zlatan Ibrahimovic again sidelined, PSG were not at full strength, as 18-year-old forward Jean-Kevin Augustin was handed a first start in the top flight. But this was always likely to be a trying night for Gazelec, a club whose overall budget for their debut season at the top level barely equates to Ibrahimovic's annual salary at the Parc des Princes. It always seemed a question of when, not if, Paris would open the scoring and they duly did so in the 11th minute thanks to Matuidi, the France midfielder taking the ball into the box and then sending a fizzing left-foot drive high into the net from a tightening angle. PSG added their second goal just before the midway point in the first half, captain Silva putting the disappointment of being dropped from the Brazil squad last week behind him as he headed home from a Thiago Motta corner. At that point it looked like turning into a rout, but Edinson Cavani failed to convert several openings in the second half and Serge Aurier headed a great chance wide. David Luiz was denied by a brilliant Clement Maury save as the hosts settled for a win that leaves them, ominously, already in top spot on goal difference. Earlier on Sunday, Marseille slumped to a second defeat in as many games, a first-half strike by Hamari Traore giving Reims all three points in a 1-0 win in Champagne country. Marseille, still reeling from the shock resignation of coach Marcelo Bielsa following their opening 1-0 defeat to Caen, never really looked like scoring and find themselves in the relegation zone in the fledgling standings. Bielsa's former assistant Franck Passi took charge of the away side in Reims but he insisted the Argentine's departure could not be used as an excuse for a disappointing display. ""We have to stop talking about trauma! We've put last weekend (Bielsa's resignation) behind us,"" said Passi. ""We mustn't hide behind that excuse. But it's clear that it will not be easy and it will take time to find a solution."" In contrast to OM, it has been a great start to the season for Reims, who had already beaten Bordeaux on the opening weekend. Sunday's other match saw Lorient scramble a 1-1 draw at home to Bastia thanks to a stoppage-time Benjamin Moukandjo penalty, which cancelled out Floyd Ayite's early opener. Mathieu Valbuena made his Lyon debut in a 1-0 win at Guingamp on Saturday as Claudio Beauvue netted the only goal of the game against his old club. Rennes and Caen were the weekend's other winners, while Monaco warmed up for their Champions League play-off first leg away to Valencia in midweek by drawing 0-0 at home to Lille on Friday. It was a trying night for the principality club, who lost influential midfielder Joao Moutinho to an ankle injury that will keep him out for up to six weeks."
915,14/08/2015,02:19,David versus Goliath as PSG host Corsican minnows,One of the smallest clubs ever to play in France's top flight could be in for a rude awakening on Sunday when Corsican minnows Gazelec Ajaccio face Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes.,"PSG began their quest for a fourth consecutive Ligue 1 title with a 1-0 victory at Lille last weekend, despite playing more than an hour with 10 men following Adrien Rabiot's sending-off. Laurent Blanc's side will now be looking for a 15th successive win in domestic competition when they entertain newly-promoted Gazelec in the capital. Gazelec, appearing in the top flight for the first time in their history after winning back-to-back promotions, had a gentle introduction to life in Ligue 1 when they drew 0-0 at fellow new boys Troyes last weekend. But now they are being thrown in at the deep end against PSG in what, on paper at least, is one of the biggest mismatches ever seen in a major European league. While Qatar-backed PSG boast a budget for this season of around 490 million euros ($546m, £350m) and last week signed Angel di Maria from Manchester United for 63 million euros, Gazelec's budget is reported to be around 13.8 million euros. That alone is less than the annual salary of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The biggest name in the islanders' squad is probably Djokovic, although that would be the Croatian-born, Dutch-raised midfielder Damjan Djokovic, not the tennis superstar Novak. However, Paris skipper Thiago Silva insisted: ""It is going to be a difficult match because we don't know much about this team. They might cause us problems. But if we are as focused as we were against Lille we should be fine. ""It is difficult for any team to come and play against us at the Parc,"" added Silva, with a nod to PSG's record of not having lost at home in the league since May last year. However, PSG have Ibrahimovic on the sidelines just now with a knee problem while Di Maria is not yet ready to make his debut, although he is set to be unveiled to the home fans. Last season's runners-up Lyon responded to a frustrating opening 0-0 draw against Lorient by further strengthening their squad with the signing of France playmaker Mathieu Valbuena from Dynamo Moscow. The pint-sized former Marseille star signed a three-year deal at the Stade de Gerland after a one-season exile in Russia and could make his OL debut on Saturday at Guingamp. ""He started playing again at the beginning of July for Dynamo Moscow. He has shown in training that he is ready and will bring his technical quality to the team,"" said Lyon coach Hubert Fournier. ""He is eligible and there is a chance he will start."" Claudio Beauvue will hope to play for Lyon against the club he left in the summer for an initial 4.5 million euros after scoring 27 goals in all competitions last season, but there is a doubt over France's reigning player of the year Alexandre Lacazette, who came off last weekend with a back problem. Monaco play host to Lille on Friday before going to Spain for the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Valencia next Wednesday, while Marseille will aim to bounce back from the shock of coach Marcelo Bielsa's resignation as they visit Reims on Sunday. Bielsa stunned French football by quitting OM following their opening 1-0 defeat to Caen at the Stade Velodrome, leaving his assistant Franck Passi to take charge in Reims. ""I am not saying it's not serious, it is unfortunate, but OM is a big institution and has already experienced this type of situation,"" said club president Vincent Labrune on Thursday. Elsewhere, Saint-Etienne host Bordeaux and newly-promoted Angers, leaders after the opening weekend, host Nantes in a local derby. Fixtures (kick-offs 1800GMT unless stated)"
916,08/08/2015,12:19,Lyon boost as star striker Lacazette extends contract,"Lyon received a massive boost on Saturday when star striker Alexandre Lacazette signed a new contract up to 2019, the Ligue 1 club announced.","The deal ends any danger that last season's top scorer in France with 27 goals would be lured away from the Stade de Gerland despite interest from Europe's superpowers. ""It was complicated and long,"" the 24-year-old France international declared after putting pen to paper to a deal worth reportedly 4,5 million euros ($4.9 million, £3.1 million) a year. ""I let it be known my wish to stay at the club and to refuse any outside offer,"" he added. ""The important thing for me was not whether I would extend my contract or not, but to stay at the club. ""I knew that I was going to stay here."" He becomes Lyon's top earner ahead of playmaker Clement Grenier, who has also signed a new deal. Among those suitors intent on signing up the £30 million (42 million euro, $46.5 million)-rated striker were Premier League sides Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal. Saturday's announcement follows Lyon manager Hubert Fournier's assertion on July 24 that Lacazette would remain a Lyon player. Seven-time former champions Lyon finished second to champions Paris-Saint Germain last season, and open their 2015-2016 campaign at home to Lorient on Sunday."
917,06/08/2015,15:36,PSG complete signing of Di Maria,"Paris Saint-Germain have completed the signing of Argentina winger Angel di Maria from Manchester United on a four-year deal, the French champions announced on Thursday.","""Paris Saint-Germain is delighted to announce the signing of Angel di Maria until June 30, 2019,"" read a club statement. Di Maria, 27, had already passed a medical in Doha before flying to Paris on Wednesday after Qatar-owned PSG had agreed a fee of 63 million euros (£44.3m; $68.9m) with United. That makes Di Maria the second most expensive player in the history of French football behind Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani, who joined Paris from Napoli for 64 million euros in the summer of 2013. ""I am very proud, and can't wait, to wear the colours of Paris Saint-Germain. I want to win every competition we enter, both in France and Europe,"" Di Maria, a Champions League winner with Real Madrid in 2014, was quoted as saying in the statement. ""I want to win the Champions League, which is a dream for all footballers, for a second time. We will do everything we can to bring Europe's biggest trophy to France and the fans of Paris Saint-Germain."" The former Rosario Central, Benfica and Madrid star will be looking to recover his very best form after a disappointing season in the Premier League with United. After helping Argentina reach the final of the Copa America in Chile last month, Di Maria is behind in his pre-season preparations and will not play any part in PSG's Ligue 1 season opener at Lille on Friday. He is the third major summer signing for Laurent Blanc's side after German goalkeeper Kevin Trapp joined from Eintracht Frankfurt for 9.5 million euros and midfielder Benjamin Stambouli penned a five-year deal after moving from Tottenham Hotspur for nine million euros. The arrival of Di Maria could be bad news for his compatriots Javier Pastore and Ezequiel Lavezzi and Brazilian winger Lucas, who all now risk being pushed down the pecking order at the Parc des Princes."
918,06/08/2015,02:20,No Zlatan as PSG begin title defence at Lille,"Paris Saint-Germain begin their quest for a fourth straight Ligue 1 title on Friday at Lille, who will be playing their first competitive match under new coach Herve Renard.","The capital club won every domestic trophy available last season and have already won silverware at the start of this campaign, beating Lyon 2-0 in last weekend's Champions Trophy in the Canadian city of Montreal. In addition, this week has seen them agree a deal to bring long-time target Angel di Maria to Paris from Manchester United -- the 27-year-old Argentina winger will be unveiled on Thursday after he passed a medical and the clubs agreed a fee of 63 million euros (£44m, $68.9m). Di Maria, who had a long summer break after helping Argentina to the Copa America final, will have to wait to make his debut and the game at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy will also go ahead without Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Swede, beginning the final season of his contract at PSG, is sidelined after hurting his right knee against Lyon, so Javier Pastore could start for the visitors. Otherwise, coach Laurent Blanc is likely to stick with the same team that outclassed Lyon, meaning German goalkeeper Kevin Trapp, a new recruit from Eintracht Frankfurt, will again start and Ivorian powerhouse Serge Aurier should get the nod after an outstanding display last week. ""He has had a great pre-season, he is full of motivation and has learned from last season, which was chaotic with all his injuries,"" said Blanc of the defender. For Lille, it is the start of a new era after Renard -- who coached Aurier and the Ivory Coast to Africa Cup of Nations glory in February - was appointed to succeed Rene Girard in the dugout. It has been a trying summer for Renard with defender Simon Kjaer, midfielder Idrissa Gueye and forward Nolan Roux all leaving the club and Lille losing out to Aston Villa in their attempts to sign Lorient's Jordan Ayew, but the 46-year-old is looking forward to the game. ""It is a great occasion to open the season. Is it a good thing to host PSG so early? I can't answer that,"" he said. ""With PSG you never know, if their machine is well-oiled or they are on top form it becomes more and more difficult. But the important thing for us is to focus on ourselves and be ready to play well and make as few mistakes as possible."" Fresh from beating Swiss side Young Boys 7-1 on aggregate in the Champions League third qualifying round, Monaco make the short trip to Nice for a Cote d'Azur derby. The principality club, who finished third last season largely thanks to their watertight defence, have sold Geoffrey Kondogbia and Yannick Ferreira Carrasco to Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid this summer but have reinvested much of the money raised into improving their attack. The early signs are good, with new boys Guido Carrillo, Ivan Cavaleiro and Stephan El Shaaraway all scoring against Young Boys. ""The objective is the podium. Paris are a long way ahead of everyone else. But there's no reason why we can't try to finish second,"" said the Moroccan Nabil Dirar. ""We are better than at the same stage last year. And the team is progressing. August will be very important."" Elsewhere on Saturday, a new-look Marseille entertain Caen after a summer which has seen Andre-Pierre Gignac, Dimitri Payet, Andre Ayew, Giannelli Imbula, Jeremy Morel and Rod Fanni all leave the Stade Velodrome. A host of new faces have come in, including injury-prone former Arsenal midfielder Abou Diaby, for whom this match will come too soon. Last season's runners-up Lyon open their campaign against Lorient at the Stade de Gerland, while tiny Corsican club Gazelec Ajaccio play their first ever Ligue 1 game against fellow newly-promoted side Troyes.

919,05/08/2015,11:08,Di Maria 'delighted' with PSG move,"Argentina winger Angel Di Maria said he is ""delighted"" to be joining French champions Paris-Saint Germain in an interview screened on BeIn Sports on Wednesday.","The 27-year-old has yet to officially sign for the Qatari-backed Parisians ahead of a move from Manchester United. But in an interview with BeIn Sports, who are owned by the same Qatari Sports Investments group that includes PSG in its portfolio, Di Maria spoke of his joy at securing a move to the big-spending outfit. ""I'm delighted to sign for PSG because the club has done everything to bring me here,"" said Di Maria, who passed a medical in Doha on Tuesday. ""I'll try to do my best, I'll work hard to give my utmost and if everything goes well, we'll win a lot of trophies."" The former Real Madrid star said his goal was to bring more than just domestic glory to last year's French treble-winners. ""Paris won all the trophies in France and that's important for such a big club. ""My aim is to help Paris get past the Champions League quarter-finals."" PSG have been knocked out in the Champions League quarter-finals the last three years (twice by Barcelona and once by Chelsea) and their best result in Europe's premier club competition remains a semi-final appearance in 1995. Di Maria's arrival will be PSG's biggest in the current off-season following those of German goalkeeper Kevin Trapp from Eintracht Frankfurt and French midfielder Benjamin Stambouli from Tottenham. The Argentine spent just one season at Manchester United, who have agreed a £44.3 million (63 million euros; $68.9 million dollars) fee with PSG. Having helped Real win the Champions League in 2014, Di Maria moved to Old Trafford for £59.7 million. Di Maria -- who has 65 caps for Argentina -- scored four goals in 32 appearances for United."
920,04/08/2015,19:58,Di Maria passes PSG medical in Doha,Argentine international Angel di Maria's proposed move from Manchester United to Paris Saint-Germain has moved closer after the winger passed a medical with the French champions in Doha on Tuesday.,"The 27-year-old had extensive tests at the Aspetar sports hospital after being given permission by the Premier League giants to fly to the Qatari capital for talks with PSG officials. The two clubs have already agreed a fee of £44.3 million (63 million euros; $68.9 million dollars) for Di Maria who will end his one-year stay at Old Trafford. United snapped up Di Maria for a British record £59.7m from Real Madrid last summer, but the winger's form slumped dramatically after making an encouraging start to life in north-west England. After netting three goals and making four assists in his opening six games for the 20-time English champions, Di Maria spent time on the sidelines with injury and fell out of favour with Red Devils boss Louis van Gaal. He started just one of the final ten games of last season with his final United goal coming in a 2-0 FA Cup third round win over Yeovil Town in January. Di Maria was also unsettled off the field after an attempted burglary on his home in Cheshire in February. Since that incident, the Argentine has been living in a city-centre appartment in Manchester -- owned by former United player Phil Neville -- with his family. The former Benfica player had said he wanted to stay at United but after failing to report for the second part of the club's pre-season tour of the United States on July 25, his future at Old Trafford appeared to be over. Di Maria -- who has 65 caps for Argentina -- scored four goals in 32 appearances for United."
921,01/08/2015,23:10,PSG ease past Lyon in Champions Trophy,"Paris Saint-Germain started the new season on Saturday just as they ended the old, lifting silverware in the shape of the French Champions Trophy thanks to a 2-0 win over Lyon in Montreal.","Two early goals by Serge Aurier and Edinson Cavani put Paris in control of the traditional season-opening contest and left Lyon with a mountain to climb long before their captain Maxime Gonalons was sent off in the 64th minute. Having completed an unprecedented clean sweep of the domestic honours in France last season, this win underlined their status as the team to beat again in the coming campaign. Tipped to be their main challengers once more, Lyon were invited to face the treble winners after finishing second to them in Ligue 1 last season as the Champions Trophy was played outside France for the seventh year in a row. But, weakened by a series of injuries to key players and by the absence of suspended starlet Nabil Fekir, Lyon never looked like winning a game played in front of an enthusiastic crowd at the Saputo Stadium in the largest city of Canada's French-speaking Quebec province. A strong PSG side featuring German summer signing Kevin Trapp in goal opened the scoring in the 11th minute as the Lyon defence failed to clear a free-kick into the box and David Luiz drove the ball back into the six-yard box for his fellow defender Aurier to head home. The second goal arrived just six minutes later when Anthony Lopes saved from Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Cavani, who started pre-season late after featuring for Uruguay at the Copa America, lashed home the loose ball. With last season's top scorer and player of the year Alexandre Lacazette unable to make an impression, Lyon offered little at the other end and Blaise Matuidi missed a great chance to increase PSG's lead after Lopes saved from Ibrahimovic's extravagant backheeled effort. Ibrahimovic, who has been in good form during his club's pre-season tour of North America as he enters the last year of his PSG contract, fired wide in the second half when finding himself with just Lopes to beat. And shortly after he was on the receiving end of a Gonalons challenge that saw the Lyon captain pick up a second yellow card and depart for an early bath. ""The mood in the camp is good. It is early days but we have prepared well,"" Matuidi told beIN Sports. ""The season will be long. Now we have spent 18 days abroad and it is difficult, so we are looking forward to going home, seeing our families again and resting before the season starts."" Fresh from winning a third successive Champions Trophy, Laurent Blanc's PSG side start their title defence at Lille on Friday, while Lyon will begin the new Ligue 1 season at home to Lorient next Sunday."

United had been aiming to maintain their 100 percent record after registering wins over Club America, San Jose Earthquakes and European champions Barcelona in their three previous games. However, the English Premier League giants were undone by two goals from PSG which highlighted the defensive frailty of Louis van Gaal's squad, which has been bolstered by several high-profile signings this summer. United began promisingly, stroking the ball around comfortably and probing for openings against the Parisian defenders. The Red Devils got the ball in the net after 22 minutes when Juan Mata prodded home Daley Blind's exquisite through ball, only for it to be ruled offside. But three minutes later, PSG struck at the other end when a long ball forward caused havoc in United's defensive unit. French international Matuidi raced forward and got between Luke Shaw and Phil Jones to toe-poke home past the onrushing David De Gea to make it 1-0. PSG doubled their lead nine minutes later with a well-worked goal that came all too easily for the French champions. Ibrahimovic picked up the ball in midfield and released Maxwell down the left flank. The Brazilian fullback advanced and then calmly picked out Ibrahimovic with the return pass for the Swedish star to slot past De Gea. The build-up to the match had been dominated by speculation surrounding United's unsettled Argentine star Angel Di Maria, who is expected to complete a move to PSG imminently."

He will undergo surgery in Lyon on Friday. Grenier, was initially included in Didier Deschamps' France squad for last year's World Cup, before breaking down and missing the tournament.

""I have heard that he's not on the plane so I cannot say anything,"" van Gaal said. ""I have heard that he was not on the plane,"" he reiterated. Di Maria had been excused from the first part of United's tour after playing in the Copa America.

""It's a very long, drawn-out affair,"" Blanc said. ""Two big clubs are having talks. Let's just wait for the moment and we will see the outcome very shortly. ""For the moment, he (Di Maria) is down to play for Manchester against PSG on Wednesday. For the moment, that is.

""There are some details that still need to be worked out between the club and the player, but there is every chance that he will join up with his future teammates in New Jersey in the coming days or even hours,"" the paper said. Di Maria would be PSG's big transfer move of the summer as they look to convert their domination of the domestic scene in France onto the European stage with a first-ever victory in the Champions League. Since the Qatar Sports Investments took over the running and financing of the club four years ago, a top player has been added to the squad each summer - Javier Pastore (43million euros) in 2011, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva (more than 60million euros) in 2012, Edinson Cavani (64million euros) in 2013 and David Luiz (50 million euros) in 2014.)

Courtois saved the day for the Premier League champions, denying spot-kicks from Jean-Christophe Bahebeck and Thiago Silva before blasting the winner into the top corner for the 6-5 shoot-out triumph against the French champions. It was a morale-boosting win for Chelsea, who fell 4-2 to Major League Soccer's New York Red Bulls to open their pre-season North American tour. The match between two clubs that clashed in the late stages of the Champions League the past two seasons got off to a tense start before a crowd of 61,224 at Bank of America Stadium -- home of the NFL's Carolina Panthers. The first minute saw a run-in between Diego Costa and Paris defender Serge Aurier, while Ibrahimovic appeared to strike John Terry in the head a couple of minutes before scoring, although neither player was cautioned.

Marco Verratti had a chance to double the lead in the 36th minute but his attempt to chip over Asmir Begovic went high. Courtois replaced Begovic at halftime as both sides made multiple substitutions. The Belgian turned away a 50th minute shot from Thiago Motta and as the half wore on Chelsea began to assert themselves. After Cesc Fabregas and Lucas were off target, Moses combined with Fabregas for the equalizer in the 65th. Radamel Falcao then came on for his first appearance for the Blues since signing a one-year loan deal in the wake of a disastrous one-year loan at Manchester United.

Talisca's 34th-minute strike made it 1-1, while Jonas connected in the 42nd minute to put Benfica ahead. After a clumsy challenge by Benfica's Jardel brought Christophe Nkunku down in the box, Moura equalized, converting the ensuing penalty with a right-footed shot that saw Benfica keeper Julio Cesar dive the wrong way. The Portuguese side nearly grabbed an equalizer in the 87th, but Nelson Oliveira's shot was pushed over the ball by goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu. PSG manager Laurent Blanc, still resting many of his top players, was pleased with the victory by a youthful squad. ""The young players played well,"" he said. Based in New Jersey for their North American visit, PSG next play Fiorentina on Tuesday before matches against Chelsea and Manchester United. Benfica will play Fiorentina, Major League Soccer's New York Red Bulls and Mexico's Club America."
930,03/07/2015,15:36,PSG ready to spend after sanctions lifted,"UEFA has lifted financial sanctions against Paris Saint Germain and the French champions will now launch into the transfer market, their president said Friday.","But Nasser al-Khelaifi said there was no an ""unlimited"" budget and new purchases would be carefully chosen. Paris Saint Germain, owned by a Qatar government company, and English rivals Manchester City were among the first major targets of UEFA president Michel Platini's Financial Fair Play (FPF) rules aiming to punish clubs run at a loss. Their heavily subsidised spending and Champions League squads were limited under UEFA sanctions, which al-Khelaifi confirmed have been lifted. ""We are very pleased with this constructive and fair decision,"" the president said in a statement on the club's website. ""This decision will allow the club to resume its development. We are now able to really act on the transfer market that opened on June 9,"" he added. ""In the past two years, we have achieved excellent financial results in all areas of the club, especially in sponsorship, revenue related to the stadium and merchandising. ""All these measures taken by the club led to a positive financial result in 2014-15 and with no debt. ""We still have room to progress with the Parc des Princes renovation project. We are working on an expansion of our stadium to increase capacity to 60,000 seats. Ultimately, this transformation of the arena will increase our revenues."" Al-Khelaifi insisted though that Parisian giants, who have been linked with a number of big signings, cannot splurge wildly on new players. Under the deal with UEFA that ended the sanctions, the club will ""have to submit financial results including balanced financial results"" for 2015-16, the president said. ""So we will spend our money on well targeted players as we have always done to help the club grow. We will not have an unlimited budget,"" added the Parisian president. Under the sanctions placed on the Ligue 1 champions last year, the club were not allowed to spend more than 60 million euros on transfers and could only register 21 players for last season's Champions League campaign, in which they lost in the quarter-finals to eventual winners Barcelona. Now freed from the constraints, last season's domestic quadruple winners will have even loftier ambitions. ""Our goals are clear and you can be certain that Paris now, more than ever, has the will to fight to achieve a place at the summit of European football,"" assured Al-Khelaifi. Laurent Blanc guided Paris to the French title, French Cup, Super Cup and League Cup as they swept all before them in France last season."
931,01/07/2015,22:00,UEFA lift Fair Play sanctions on PSG - L'Equipe,"UEFA has decided to lift the sanctions imposed on Paris Saint-Germain under the Financial Fair Play rule, meaning the French champions can spend more on new players after proving they will be debt-free by the end of next season, according to French newspaper L'Equipe.","PSG were heavily sanctioned by European football's governing body in May 2014 after breaching FFP rules. But UEFA's new ruling means that the Parisians can increase the size of their Champions League squad from 21 to 25 players for next season (2015/16), L'Equipe reported. The online edition of the newspaper added that UEFA's Financial Supervisory Instance of Clubs (ICFC) department has lifted the 60-million-euro limit that was imposed on the Qatari-owned Paris giants. PSG -- who've won back-to-back Ligue 1 titles -- were purchased by Qatar Investment Authority in 2011. They'll now be able to recruit players unrestricted instead of being hampered by a spending ceiling. The Parc des Princes outfit have been heavily linked with a move for Juventus' star midfielder, Frenchman Paul Pogba, who's mooted to have a transfer fee of around 100 million euros. Manchester United's Argentine winger Angel di Maria is also a target -- a player that PSG missed out on last season due to the restrictions. PSG, who won all four domestic trophies in France last season, had signed an agreement with UEFA to promise that they would not go above a deficit of 30 million euros at the end of last season. And one year in advance, the club have signed a deal stipulating that they will be debt free come the end of the 2015/16 season, which resulted in the sanctions being lifted early against the capital club."

Zlatan Ibrahimovic and his PSG teammates await Marseille for the first of their much awaited so-called 'Classico' games on October 4 with the return clash on February 7. The closest thing France has to a real derby is the bitter regional clash between Lyon and Saint-Etienne on November 8 with the opposite date scheduled for Janary 16.
934,12/06/2015,15:40,"Ibrahimovic ""happy"" to stay at PSG",Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic dismissed rumours on Friday linking him with a move from Paris Saint-Germain to AC Milan and insisted he was happy to stay in the French capital.,"""I am happy at PSG, I don't know where these stories are coming from,"" he told a press conference before Sweden's European Championship qualifier against Montenegro on Sunday. Ibrahimovic, 33, who helped PSG to a clean sweep of four domestic trophies last season (League, Cup, League Cup and Champions Trophy) insisted: ""I am a PSG player and I have another year left on my contract. ""The media blow things up but there is no truth to these stories about Milan."" However, he did acknowledge that a return to Milan, where he enjoyed a successful spell form 2010 to 2012, was not entirely out of the question. """"Anything can happen,"" he added."

""I'm proud to play here. I want to improve and help the team keep winning trophies,"" said Lucas, whose side won the league title, the French Cup and the League Cup this season. ""Next year we want the Champions League title,"" added the Brazilian, whose side were beaten by Barcelona in the quarter-finals this season. PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaïfi, who brought Lucas to Paris as part of an ambitious drive from the Qatari owners, also expressed his pride in having a player such as Lucas at the club. ""I want to see this player of such enormous potential in our colours on the football pitches of France and Europe,"" said Al-Khelaifi. Known for his box-to-box runs and individual brilliance Lucas made 26 league starts for Paris this season and appears to be starting to fullfil his potential. PSG also extended the contract of Javier Pastore on Monday, the 25-year-old Argentine midfielder was viewed by most pundits as the club's player of the season."
936,01/06/2015,20:21,Pastore eyes Champions League title after extending PSG stay,Argentinian offensive midfielder Javier Pastore celebrating what he terms his best season in Paris Saint Germain's historic campaign winning four trophies will be with them till 2019 after extending his contract on Monday.,"The 25-year-old -- capped 19 times -- was suspended for Saturday's 1-0 win over second tier Auxerre in the French Cup final but it failed to dampen on a personal note his overall assessment of the season. ""I'm very happy. This has been the best year of my career,"" said Pastore. ""This season was special because I played so much and I felt especially comfortable out on the pitch. ""I'm very proud of my season, and also of all my teammates because without them, I couldn't achieve anything,"" added Pastore, who scored six goals in 51 appearances but also set up many others for his team-mates. Pastore, who was the first big name to sign for the Paris club under its Qatari owners in 2011 from Italian side Palermo for 43million euros ($47million), said the historic campaign was terrific but he had further goals to accomplish with PSG. ""I hope to keep winning titles here and to play a champions league final with this team, that's my main objective now,"" said Pastore, who has been selected for the Argentina squad for the upcoming Copa America. ""I think we can get there in the next few years, why not next season? I hope so. That's my aim, to win the champions league, to play a final with Paris Saint-Germain is my focus."" Pastore has accrued three league titles, two League Cups and a French Cup winners medal since arrived at the club."
937,30/05/2015,23:13,PSG stroll to incredible quadruple,Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain claimed an historic quadruple trophy haul on Saturday by beating Auxerre 1-0 to win the French Cup title.,"Edinson Cavani's header after 64 minutes sealed another title for the Parisian club who had already won the Ligue 1 crown along with the Champions' Trophy and the League Cup -- the three other trophies possible in French football. The French Cup was the only domestic title missing from PSG's cabinet since they were taken over by their Qatari owners in 2011. Clear favourites before the kick off, PSG only needed the second-half Cavani goal to do what no other club had ever achieved in France and bag their ninth French Cup. PSG rounded off their season in a memorable fashion with their first French Cup since 2010 but it wasn't as easy as expected for one of the richest clubs in world football. Ligue 2 side Auxerre, who finished ninth in their third successive season in the French second-tier, relied on counter-attacks and long balls to cause trouble to a full-strength Paris team and it took them over an hour to break the deadlock. Captain Thiago Silva had come back from a thigh injury in time for the final as well as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who also started despite struggling with a minor calf problem. The only absence of note was that of Javier Pastore, who was suspended. Laurent Blanc's side have shown themselves to be a step ahead of all their home rivals in 2014-2015 but Auxerre held their ground against the capital giants as they marched towards a clean sweep of domestic honours. Even striker Ibrahimovic failed to find the back of the net and Thiago Motta was the main threat of the first half when his long-range effort cracked against the right hand upright five minutes from the break. Auxerre 'keeper Donovan Leon, just 22, needed no help when he held off a Cavani header from a Maxwell cross inside the second half. But with 64 minutes gone, the Uruguayan forward once again rose unmarked in the heart of the defence to cannon a powerful header off the underside of the bar and into the back of the net. Late but unconvincing attempts from Amara Baby or Cheick Fantamady Diarra for the Burgundy side never troubled Paris' Cup specialist Nicolas Douchez, who kept his fourth clean sheet of the tournament. On their march to the Stade de France, PSG beat Ligue 1 rivals Montpellier, Bordeaux, Nantes, Monaco and Saint-Etienne. Relegated in 2012, Auxerre, who saw Eric Cantona, Abou Diaby and Bacary Sagna rise through their ranks, won a league and cup double under legendary coach Guy Roux in 1996 while also lifting the Cup in 1994, 2003 and 2005. PSG's victory means that Bordeaux, who were sixth in the league, now qualify for the Europa League, while Ligue 1 runners-up Lyon will play in the next Champions' Trophy."

It took the Ligue 1 giants, bankrolled by Qatar Sports Investments, to first place in the list, with Manchester City, who topped the poll in 2014, slipping to third place with an average yearly wage of £5.015 million. However, PSG later denied they had the deepest pockets when it came to paying their players. ""While winning the Ligue 1 for the third consecutive year, the club is still not on top of the global sports brands in terms of salaries,"" the Paris giants said in a statement. ""Contrary to the hierarchy established in the recent study published by SportingIntelligence, Paris Saint-Germain is not even in the top five of this ranking.

940,17/05/2015,20:06,"Lacazette, Blanc take honours in French awards",Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette was named France's player of the year at a ceremony in Paris on Sunday as Paris Saint-Germain boss Laurent Blanc won the Ligue 1 coach of the year prize.,"Lacazette won the award, voted for by his peers, ahead of PSG trio Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Javier Pastore and Marco Verratti after a remarkable season in which he has scored 27 Ligue 1 goals to help Lyon finish second and qualify for next season's Champions League. His form has attracted interest from elsewhere, with PSG and Arsenal among those linked with an approach for the 23-year-old. And Lacazette admitted that he is uncertain where his future lies beyond this campaign. ""I don't know,"" he replied when asked if he would still be at OL next season. ""That is a question that will be asked at the end of the season. ""I am very proud, it is a boyhood dream come true to win the trophy for the best player."" There was to be no third straight player of the year gong for Ibrahimovic, but Blanc won the coach's award for the second time in his career, a day after the capital club retained the French title. The 49-year-old, who previously took the honour when in charge of Bordeaux in 2008, saw his PSG side secure a third consecutive Ligue 1 crown with a game to spare on Saturday after they beat Montpellier 2-1. Having already won the season-opening Champions Trophy and the League Cup, PSG can win an unprecedented clean sweep of the domestic honours by beating second-tier Auxerre in the French Cup final on May 30. Hubert Fournier of runners-up Lyon, Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier and Guingamp coach Jocelyn Gourvennec were the other nominees. ""This trophy is not a title, but a reward,"" said Blanc. ""Titles are won on the field and are more important, they represent more. But I am nevertheless happy to be rewarded."" Blanc was beaten to the prize last year by Lille's Rene Girard and he added: ""Last year I did not get the reward when we were more dominant in the league. But when I started out, I won it when we finished second (with Bordeaux)."" Lyon forward Nabil Fekir, who has scored 13 goals in Ligue 1 this season playing alongside Lacazette and recently broke into the French national set-up, won the young player of the year award. ""A year ago I never would have imagined experiencing this. But I deserve this trophy,"" insisted Fekir, who chose France over Algeria and made his debut for Les Bleus against Brazil in March."
941,16/05/2015,23:03,Blanc position strengthened as PSG reign supreme,"Paris Saint-Germain have underlined their dominance of the French scene, strengthening the position of coach Laurent Blanc, but the biggest challenge for the club remains to become truly competitive in Europe.","In Ligue 1, Blanc's side were pushed almost all the way by an exciting young Lyon team, eventually retaining the title with a game to spare on Saturday. A third consecutive Ligue 1 crown keeps them on course to win an unprecedented clean sweep of France's domestic trophies -- with the season-opening Champions Trophy and the League Cup already in the bag, Paris are also overwhelming favourites to win the French Cup final against second-tier Auxerre on May 30. The way in which they won the title, pulling away from Lyon thanks to a rampant run of eight straight wins, and their performances in the domestic cups, means Blanc deserves great credit. He has shown himself capable of handling the big egos in his expensively-assembled squad, in particular for his temporary sidelining of Ezequiel Lavezzi and Edinson Cavani for their late returns from Christmas holidays, declaring ""the end of certain privileges"". Blanc's stance, at a time when he was under pressure with Paris third in the table, three points behind leaders Marseille at the season's halfway stage, was risky but it paid off, ensuring that he should now stay on into the last year of his contract. Meanwhile, the coach himself pinpointed the work done at a winter training camp in Morocco when asked why his team found such fine form in the run-in. ""I think at the start of 2015 everyone realised what was happening. The turning point was our winter training camp in Marrakech. That's when we got back on track,"" he told beIN Sports as PSG finally showed the gulf in class that exists between them and the rest of France. ""They are too strong for the French league. When they are really focused, when they have the desire, when they have a full-strength squad, they are unbeatable,"" admitted Nantes coach Michel Der Zakarian recently. In Europe, however, it was a season of mixed fortunes as, for the third year running, Paris saw their Champions League hopes ended in the quarter-finals. Although hindered by injuries and suspensions, a 5-1 aggregate loss to Barcelona was a reminder of just how far Paris still have to go before being genuine contenders to win that competition. However, there is no disgrace in being outplayed by Barcelona, especially when you don't have a full-strength team -- just ask Pep Guardiola and Bayern Munich. Putting the defeat into perspective, Blanc said at the time: ""We need to have patience to win the Champions League. Barca fans know that. It is a big club but it had patience to win the Champions League for the first time in 1992 after (nearly) 100 years."" In any case, a great leap forward was made in Europe with the defeat of Jose Mourinho's Chelsea on away goals in the last 16. Paris progressed despite playing most of the second leg at Stamford Bridge with 10 men after Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off, and indeed the club may now have a dilemma on their hands surrounding the future of the Swede. He has reached 30 goals in all competitions again, despite missing a third of the season due to injury or suspension. Ibrahimovic remains the big draw but he will be 34 later this year and is out of contract in 2016. And in Marquinhos, Marco Verratti and Javier Pastore, Blanc has other players whose importance is only increasing. UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules mean PSG, like last summer, will not be able to splash unlimited amounts of cash, and president Nasser Al Khelaifi will need to decrease the wage bill and sell players before being able to make moves for the likes of Kevin de Bruyne, Paul Pogba or Angel di Maria. Therefore, letting Ibrahimovic -- whose annual salary is in the region of 16 million euros ($18.3m) -- go a year early could be a sensible move, although it seems more likely that Cavani or Lavezzi will depart."
942,16/05/2015,22:59,Five key players in PSG's title-winning season,Paris Saint-Germain clinched their third consecutive Ligue 1 title with a game to spare on Saturday after beating Montpellier 2-1.,"Here, AFP Sports selects five players who played central roles in helping PSG win the French title for the fifth time. MARQUINHOS (BRA/defender) An outstanding young defender around whom, along with Marco Verratti, PSG would like to build a team really capable of winning the Champions League. The Brazilian, who turns 21 this month, has been just as useful at right-back as in central defence this season and has even appeared in central midfield. The presence of Thiago Silva and David Luiz means Marquinhos may become even more of a fixture at right-back in future. Broke George Weah's club record by making 34 appearances in one season for Paris without suffering a single defeat before his run came to an end in the Champions League quarter-final against Barcelona. MARCO VERRATTI (ITA/midfielder) The diminutive 22-year-old playmaker is one of the most exciting young players in world football. Outstanding technically and a magnificent passer of the ball, Verratti has added an ability to score and create goals to his game this season, with as many assists in Ligue 1 as in the last two campaigns combined. Also scored his first goals in the French top flight. The giants of European football would love Verratti, but if PSG can keep hold of him the sky is the limit. JAVIER PASTORE (ARG/midfielder) After two disappointing seasons saw him fall out of contention for the Argentina squad at last year's World Cup, Pastore has recovered the form that he showed when he first arrived in France in 2011. Indeed he has been so impressive in recent months that the enigmatic Eric Cantona described the 25-year-old as ""the best player in the world"". Pastore has scored or set up 15 goals and dazzled fans and opponents with his marvellous touch. Comfortable in midfield or wide in PSG's front three, although he is given a licence to roam. ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC (SWE/forward) The Swede has not been as impressive as in either of the previous two seasons, when he won France's player of the year award on both occasions. That is partly due to a heel injury that saw him miss half a dozen games in the autumn and then a three-game ban in April that followed an extraordinary rant at a referee following a defeat in Bordeaux. The extent to which his influence is on the wane was exemplified by PSG beating Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League despite having Ibrahimovic sent off in the first half of the second leg at Stamford Bridge. And yet Ibrahimovic remains the biggest draw at the club. He has still weighed in with 30 goals in all competitions this season and with 106 goals in total since signing in 2012, he is now just three away from Pedro Pauleta's overall club record of 109. EDINSON CAVANI (URU/forward) Cavani is still not the player he was expected to be when Paris paid a French record 64 million euros ($72.7m, £46.2m) for him in the summer of 2013, and there is a good chance he will leave the club in the close season, with the likes of Juventus, Atletico Madrid and Manchester United all having been linked with the Uruguayan. However, Cavani has scored 16 league goals and 28 in all competitions, including 10 in six matches in the run-in. He has scored goals against Lyon, Marseille and Saint-Etienne in the league, notched a brace in the League Cup final defeat of Bastia and found the net six times in 10 Champions League games."
943,15/05/2015,16:36,Blanc says Montpellier match 'most important of season',"Paris Saint-Germain head to Montpellier on Saturday for what is ""the most important game of the season"", said coach Laurent Blanc ahead of a match that could see PSG walk away as champions.","The capital side, currently sitting six points clear of second placed Lyon at the top of the table, only need one point from their last two games to clinch their third consecutive French title. ""We know what we have to do, winning as always. It's a crucial game, it can help us reach our goal. It's the most important game of the season,"" said Blanc on Friday. PSG face Montpellier on Saturday before hosting strugglers Reims in the final game of the season. They will, however, have to wrap up their league programme without Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the Sweden forward is sidelined with a calf injury. Former Chelsea man David Luiz, who missed his side's last two games against Nantes and Guingamp, has sufficiently recovered from his heel injury to be included in the squad but midfielders Marco Verratti and Thiago Motta are suspended. The Ligue 1 giants, having already won the League Cup, are still on course for an unprecedented domestic treble as they will face second-tier Auxerre in the French Cup final on May 30. Meanwhile, France midfielder Blaise Matuidi has ruled out a move away from the Parc des Princes. ""I will be at Paris next season, unless the managers come and tell me they don't need me any more,"" said the 28-year-old, who is under contract until 2018 but has been linked with a move to the English Premier League in the press. ""I feel good here, I'm valued by the coach, the managers and my teammates. ""I love this city, I grew up here, everything's going well for me. ""You never know what tomorrow will bring but I really hope to still be here and I'll do my best to do better than this year."""
944,15/05/2015,02:15,PSG one point away from French title,Paris Saint-Germain head into their penultimate league match of the season on Saturday in the knowledge that one point will be enough for the capital side to claim a third consecutive French title.,"PSG have amassed 77 points from the 36 games played so far -- with just three defeats -- six ahead of Lyon. With three points on offer for a win and one for a draw, the Parisians would walk away as champions should they not lose at Montpellier on Saturday. ""Last year we had a very good season, and that's an understatement. We played great football, set a new points record, won practically every match, even when we had Champions League games in midweek,"" PSG coach Laurent Blanc said in an interview with beIN Sports France. ""This season has been more difficult, we have to admit that, it got to the point where we had to acknowledge the situation and realise that teams like Marseille and Lyon, who were playing well, would get away from us. ""I think at the start of 2015 everyone realised what was happening, the turning point was our winter training camp in Marrakech. That's when we got back on track."" Blanc, whose side wrap up their league programme at home to Reims next week, didn't want to rush into judging the season given that his team also have to play the French Cup final against Auxerre in a bid for an unprecedented domestic treble, having already won the League Cup. ""It's only at the very end of the campaign that you can assess your season,"" the former France international said in the interview, also published on the Ligue 1 website. ""We can't really judge how successful the season has been yet. But honestly, I think that we've had a good year."" PSG's expensively-assembled squad have pulled through in a cat-and-mouse season with second-placed Lyon, but suffered a deflating Champions League exit to Barcelona. Blanc said that having reached the Champions League quarter-finals for the last three years, the next challenge was to advance further in Europe's top club competition. ""We've heard in the media that in order for PSG to become a big European club, it has to win the Champions League inside five years, and the media just won't let it lie,"" the coach said. ""Perhaps they're right, but five years is a long time, but also a short time, especially when you see how far Paris Saint-Germain has already come. It's not just an ambitious project, it's a very, very ambitious project and we have the means to realise our goal, but the project only started three years ago."" Blanc added, however, that PSG didn't need to go out and buy a load of players, insisting instead that experience was key. ""What do the clubs in the semi-finals of the Champions League have that we don't have? More experience, more quality as well, in terms of players and also coaching staff,"" he said. ""So we have to look to learn from these clubs. But we are looking to learn from huge clubs, age-old institutions, who have always been at the very highest level, who have won the Champions League five, six or even ten times! And we want to scrap, to fight with these clubs."" In other matches, Lyon host sixth-placed Bordeaux (59pts) with the latter still pushing for one of the two Europa League spots up for grabs and currently occupied by Marseille and St Etienne (63). Monaco, whose Portuguese coach Leonardo Jardim extended his contract through to 2019 in midweek, lie third on 65pts and entertain Metz in the Principality. Marseille travel to Lille and St Etienne head for Evian, who must win to stand any chance of not joining Metz and Lens in being relegated to the second division.

Even if Lyon win their remaining three matches, Laurent Blanc's Paris side require only four more points to retain the title, and they should have little trouble getting the job done on current form. Far from letting their Champions League quarter-final exit to Barcelona last month have an adverse affect on performances, PSG -- with the League Cup in the bag and French Cup final to come -- have appeared determined to go on and secure what would be an unprecedented domestic treble. The form of Cavani and the return from suspension of his strike partner Ibrahimovic have both been key for the capital club, and they now have 58 goals between them in all competitions this season. Cavani in particular has looked like a different player in the last month and his first hat-trick in French football means he has now scored 10 times in six matches in domestic competition. The Uruguayan set the ball rolling by diverting in a low Serge Aurier cross from the right with less than two minutes on the clock and fans still arriving at the Parc des Princes on a sunny national holiday evening in Paris. Guingamp beat PSG 1-0 when the sides last met back in December, but with their top-flight survival secured coming into this fixture, their thoughts seemed to have already turned to a well-earned summer holiday. Claudio Beauvue, whose outstanding season has made him a target for clubs in England and elsewhere, almost caught out Salvatore Sirigu with a swerving free-kick from fully 40 yards, but the visitors offered next to nothing in open play and fell further behind on 18 minutes. Marco Verratti exchanged passes with Cavani and teed up Ibrahimovic, who took his time before firing into the roof of the net. Ibrahimovic was then happy to play the role of provider as Paris ran away with the game in the second half, first setting up Cavani for a great finish to make it 3-0 shortly after half-time. Maxwell then arrived at the back post to head in after a cheeky chip to the back post by Ibrahimovic, and Cavani's hat-trick goal came following a quick Verratti free-kick. There was still time for Ibrahimovic to get his 30th of the campaign from the penalty spot at the death after he had been brought down inside the area, as Paris recorded their biggest league win since the Qatari takeover that revolutionised the club in 2011.

""I don't know if we'll end up champions but over the last five or six games we've been tough to play against,"" said Blanc after last weekend's 2-0 victory at Nantes, which was a sixth straight league win and featured a fine performance from the giant Swedish striker. ""It's all about concentration and determination to win the ball back. Our current form is due to the focussed concentration the team is achieving,"" he explained. Injuries and suspensions mean Paris' backline is threadbare for Guingamp's arrival and their top marksman Claudio Beauvue will be interested to hear that midfielder Thiago Motta may be drafted into central defence. The left-sided Marquinos may be played on the right too. Gregory van der Wiel is suspended, David Luiz has a foot injury and Serge Aurier a thigh problem as Guingamp come to Paris in the week their coach Jocelyn Gourvennec was shortlisted as manager of the year due to the club's run to the last-16 of the Europa League. Second-placed Lyon travel north to relegation-threatened Caen on Saturday with four wins and a draw from their last five games. Their 27-goal striker Lacazette is expected to win French player of the year next week and he is desperate to boost his tally to 30 by season's end. The other three players on the short-list are Javier Pastore, Marco Verratti and Ibrahimovic, all PSG players, and rumours this week in the French press say Lacazette will also be in blue next season. Lyon president Jean Michel Aulas is trying to deflect this kind of pressure from the champions with a war of words in the press. ""They intimidate their rivals and pressure officials,"" Aulas said this week.

948,03/05/2015,23:34,Ibrahimovic sparks Paris title thrust,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic, fresh from a three-match ban, sparked Paris Saint Germain's 2-0 win at Nantes in Ligue 1 on Sunday, moving them a step closer to third straight French title.","The Swede had a hand in both goals, notably playing the ball between Nantes' captain Oswaldo Vizcarrondo's legs to set up Blaise Matuidi's clincher on the half-hour. Edinson Cavani had pounced as early as the third minute after the Swede had sparked a goalmouth scramble with a snap shot. The 2-0 win puts PSG on 74 points at the top with Lyon three points behind with three games to play. Having already won the League Cup, and with a French Cup final to come against Auxerre on May 30, Lauren Blanc's side are on track for a domestic clean sweep. Vizcarrondo was left red-faced when Ibrahimovic produced the cheeky pass through his legs before he turned in a panic to see Matuidi race through anc clip a slick finish round the onrushing Remy Riou in the Nantes goal. The Swede was playing his first game since starting a three match ban stemming from comments describing France as a ""shit country"" when he thought he was off camera after a defeat to Bordeaux. Nantes worked hard all night with relentless support from a packed stadium but Paris dominated throughout. Cavani might have had a hatful but for a string of first-half saves from Riou. While Serge Gakpe and Johan Audel both forced fingertip saves from Paris 'keeper Nicolas Douchez, who continued to impress in the absence of Salvatore Sirigu, their chances were few and far between. Thanks to a hugely industrious Paris engine room led by Marco Verratti, Nantes were largely reduced to hopeful punts from the wing. It was PSG's sixth straight league win and their remaining fixtures appear eminently winnable -- they must visit Montpellier and welcome Guingamp and Reims to the Parc des Princes, where they are unbeaten domestically in a year. Lyon for their part beat strugglers Evian 2-0 on Saturday to maintain their challenge for a first league title since 2008. A superb free-kick from Clement Grenier and an Alexandre Lacazette penalty gave Lyon the three crucial points. Earlier Sunday, Monaco's Portuguese duo Bernard Silva and Joao Moutinho set up a 4-1 hammering of Toulouse that took their team five points clear of their closest pursuers for Ligue 1's third and final Champions League spot. Marseille had looked good for a Champions League place, having led Ligue 1 at Christmas. But a classy Monaco run has seen a 15 point turnaround between the two clubs. Monaco are now on 65 points, with Marseille and Saint Etienne on 60. Monaco had a great run in the Champions League this season only getting knocked-out 1-0 on aggregate in a close run affair with Juventus. Third place in France offers a place in the third qualifying round for next season and all the aces now seem to be firmly in Monaco's hands."
949,01/05/2015,02:20,No margin for error for PSG and Lyon as title battle heats up,Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon continue their game of cat and mouse at the top of Ligue 1 this weekend as they face Nantes and Evian respectively.,"PSG opened up a three-point lead over Lyon at the top of the table on Tuesday with a 3-1 win in their game in hand against Metz, putting the defending champions in the driver's seat with just four matches remaining. The capital club have, on paper at least, an easier route to the title as their first step takes them to mid-table Nantes, where they haven't lost since 2004. Any fears that PSG would take their foot off the gas following their deflating Champions League quarter-final exit to Barcelona have been allayed with their displays in their last two outings, a 6-1 demolition of Lille being followed by the victory against Metz. With Zlatan Ibrahimovic back from his three-match ban, Paris coach Laurent Blanc has a difficult decision over who to drop out of in-form trio Javier Pastore, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Edinson Cavani. But it is the kind of dilemma most coaches would love to have, and former France and Liverpool boss Gerard Houllier, who won titles in charge of both PSG, in 1986, and Lyon, in 2006 and 2007, believes the capital side are now poised to secure a third consecutive Ligue 1 title. ""Even if the race is still wide open, the Parisians are 80 percent favourites for me,"" the 67-year old told sports daily L'Equipe. ""For Lyon to be champions, they will have to win all of their games and hope for a PSG slip-up. But the Parisians are on the upswing."" Lyon coach Hubert Fournier also conceded his side's titles hopes are out of their hands but insisted they would give PSG a run for their money. ""We no longer hold our destiny in our hands,"" Fournier admitted ahead of the meeting with relegation-threatened Evian. ""But it's up to us to give our all right to the death so we have no regrets should Paris eventually slip up. If they don't falter, that doesn't really change anything -- we still have the desire to get the best possible result every time. ""We still believe in our chances even though we're up against a side who are having a great season, and who possess one of the best squads in Europe -- better than Chelsea, for example."" Fournier is waiting on the fitness of forward Nabil Fekir, who has a slight back problem, but will again look to 26-goal leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette as they attempt to extend a four-game unbeaten run. Leaders at Christmas, Marseille's title challenge has crumbled in 2015 and their meltdown has been so dramatic that even second-bottom Metz fancy their chances for their showdown on Friday. While Marseille are now five points adrift of a Champions League qualifying berth, Metz are eight points from safety and so could be relegated this weekend if they lose and other results go their way. Elsewhere, third-placed Monaco host strugglers Toulouse while Saint-Etienne, in fourth, go to Corsica to face Bastia. On Sunday, Lille face local rivals Lens, who are rock bottom and must win and hope other results go their way to put off an inevitable relegation back to Ligue 2.

The Ivory Coast international has signed a contract with the club until June 2019,"" read a statement issued by the Ligue 1 leaders. The 22-year-old, who shone at last year's World Cup in Brazil and helped the Ivorians win the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year, has made a total of 14 appearances for Paris this season, scoring one goal. Paris did not confirm the fee paid for Aurier, a right-back who began his career with Lens and then spent two and a half years at Toulouse before being loaned to the Parc des Princes last summer. Media reports in France place the fee in the region of 10 million euros (£7.2m, $11m). Aurier did not feature as Laurent Blanc's side beat Metz 3-1 on Tuesday to move three points clear of Lyon at the top of Ligue 1 with three games remaining."
951,29/04/2015,00:10,PSG go top thanks to Pastore artistry,A standout performance by Argentinian Javier Pastore inspired Paris Saint Germain to a 3-1 win over relegation-threatened Metz on Tuesday and saw the winners open a three point lead at the top of Ligue 1.,"Pastore, one of three players pin-pointed as not going anywhere in the close season by club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi in an interview in Tuesday's Le Parisien, was in devastating form, setting up all three PSG goals for Marco Verratti, Edinson Cavani and Gregory van der Wiel. The win gives the two-time defending champions a three point cushion over Lyon, who have a slightly better goal difference with four matches remaining. Metz by contrast saw a four match unbeaten run come to an end and are still without an away win since September -- they lie second bottom, eight points from safety and just 12 still in play. PSG coach Laurent Blanc, who also received the thumbs-up from Al-Khelaifi in the interview, said his players were handling the incessant run of games very well. ""One forgets often that Paris has been on the go non stop for the past two months,"" said Blanc, whose side could seal a domestic treble this season having won the League Cup and a date with second tier Auxerre in the French Cup final. ""However, it gives me joy as a coach to see like this evening players who are determined, who battle for every ball, who betray few weaknesses."" Blanc, who saw his side's hopes of the Champions League ended by Barcelona last week in the quarter-finals, said that the result was not a title winning one. ""It is not an essential step towards the title,"" said the former France national coach, whose contract was not renewed after the Euro 2012 finals. ""There are still four matches remaining and we have to take a lot of points. We are in a good place but that is not enough."" Verratti struck with a sweetly-taken right-footed effort, after being set up by Pastore. The 25-year-old was at the heart of the second goal as well, finding Cavani, who had started the move, with a deft pass and the Uruguayan, along with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who was serving the last match of his suspension the other two players named as not for sale, made no mistake. Metz, though, refused to lay down and got back into the game seven minutes into the second-half as Bouna Sarr outstripped David Luiz down the right flank and the 23-year-old's cross beat Thiago Silva and was met with full force by on-loan striker Modibo Maiga's head giving goalkeeper Nicolas Douchez no chance. However, the hosts wrapped up the points 13 minutes from time as the dynamic Pastore picked out van der Wiel's run down the right hand side and the Dutch international defender's shot crept under Metz goalkeeper Anthony Mfa Mezui. Blanc praised Pastore's performance with certain qualifications. ""He is a player I value highly,"" said Blanc. ""He had a difficult time earlier in the season but in the last 10-12 matches he has come through especially in the absence of Ibrahimovic. ""This evening he could have been better as he lacked lucidity on occasions, but I think that could be down to fatigue."""
952,22/04/2015,02:05,Patience needed to deliver PSG Champions League - Blanc,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc has called for patience in the French champions' bid to win the Champions League for the first time after a 5-1 thrashing on aggregate by Barcelona saw them bow out at the quarter-finals for the third consecutive year.,"A first-half double from Neymar handed Barca a comfortable 2-0 victory on Tuesday to add to their 3-1 win in Paris last week to reach the semi-finals of Europe's premier club competition for a seventh time in eight years. PSG haven't made the last four since their best ever showing in the competition 20 years ago despite the hundreds of millions of euros invested in recent years by their Qatari owners. However, Blanc used the example of Barca, who won the first of their four European Cups in 1992, 93 years after they were formed. ""We need to have patience to win the Champions League. Barca fans know that. It is a big club but it had patience to win the Champions League for the first time in '92 after (nearly) a 100 years. ""I hope Paris don't have to wait so long. The semi-finalists tonight are Barca and Bayern who have a huge football potential and took time to get there. ""Paris will achieve it one day but we have to have patience."" There are no such worries for Barca boss Luis Enrique who claimed the club's consistent success in Europe over the past decade is thanks to their distinctive style of play, despite accusations that he has turned Barca into a more counter-attacking side this season. ""The club is one of the most important in Europe and the numbers show that. ""Moreover, there is a characteristic style that any fan in Europe would instantly recognise."" Victory kept Barca on course to win the treble of La Liga, Champions League and Copa del Rey for just the second time in the club's history. The only previous time came during Pep Guardiola's first season in charge and Enrique's friend could be the man standing in his way of repeating that achievement after Bayern Munich romped back from a 3-1 first leg deficit to hammer Porto 6-1 and also reach the last four. ""I am very happy that Guardiola has gone through because I like when good things happen to my friends. ""There were a lot of people that wrote them off and the fact that they scored six with a lot of players out says everything about Guardiola as a coach and Bayern as a team. ""We will see what the draw on Friday brings."" And Enrique dismissed suggestions Barca had at least met the minimum requirement expected of them by reaching the semi-finals once more. ""There are no limits on our ambition seeing the players I have and the work they have done since the start of the season in a special year for the club given all the changes that have taken place. ""It wouldn't be logical for us to have a minimum objective, that doesn't mean anything. The objective is to be better than our next opponent and deserve on the field to reach the final."""
953,21/04/2015,22:42,Neymar double eases Barcelona past poor PSG,Barcelona cruised into their seventh Champions League semi-final in eight years as a double from Neymar handed them to a 2-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain to seal a 5-1 aggregate victory on Tuesday.,"Just as in last week's first leg in Paris, the Brazilian opened the scoring after a sensational assist from Andres Iniesta. Neymar then capitalised on some shoddy defending to head home his 30th goal of the season from Dani Alves's cross. Barca will now take their place alongside Bayern Munich in Friday's draw for the last four, the ties to be played next month. Only once in European Cup history had a side come back from losing the first leg at home 3-1 and there was little doubt about the outcome as Barca dominated proceedings from the off. The opener arrived on 14 minutes as Iniesta collected the ball inside his own half, spun past three PSG challenges and then rolled the ball through to Neymar, who calmly rounded Salvatore Sirigu before slotting home. PSG briefly threatened to respond as Zlatan Ibrahimovic had a goal rightly ruled out for offside against his old club on his return to the side from suspension. However, Barca were soon back in command as Lionel Messi fired just over from Luis Suarez's knockdown before Sirigu was forced into a flying save to turn away Alves's powerful drive before clutching Neymar's follow-up effort. There was nothing the Italian could do 12 minutes before the break, though, as he was exposed by more shocking defending from the French champions as Alves was given plenty of time to pick out his compatriot and the unmarked Neymar powered a header into the bottom corner for his fifth goal in four games against PSG this season. Barca boss Luis Enrique could afford the luxury of withdrawing Iniesta and Sergio Busquets at the start of the second period for Xavi and Sergi Roberto respectively with one eye on Saturday's Catalan derby away to Espanyol. With the hosts taking their foot off the gas, PSG did at least have the chance to add some respectability to the scoreline, but unlike Barca's star front three of Messi, Suarez and Neymar, who now have 95 goals between them this season, they were wasteful in front of goal. Marco Verratti passed up the best chance when he pulled his shot wide when well-placed at the edge of the area, whilst Ter Stegen did well to repel Ibrahimovic's piledriver 18 minutes from time. Messi had one final chance to move ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo as the leading scorer in Champions League history, but the Argentine's goal drought in the competition stretched into four games as his shot flashed just wide."

""The strong position taken by (The French Professional League) president Frederic Thiriez in favouring changes for next season in the filming of players on their way back to the changing rooms constitutes a genuine advance for all professional clubs,"" the statement read. ""In the spirit of conciliation, as the end of the season promises to be highly-charged right up to the climax, we have decided to suspend our decision (to boycott) but we will remain vigilant in protecting our players and the manner in which they are filmed."" Marseille said they had held constructive talks with senior figures from Canal Plus over the past few days and that significant progress had been made. The two clubs had been furious over how two of their stars, Zlatan Ibrahimovic of PSG and Marseille's Dimitri Payet, had been held to account by the league after being caught on camera. Ibrahimovic was suspended for four games after he was filmed delivering an expletive-laden rant against referees and France after his side lost at Bordeaux. Payet was banned for two matches for shouting at the referee's room that Marseille had been ""screwed"" after a goal was disallowed in their 0-0 draw with title rivals Lyon. Both subsequently had their bans reduced by one game."
955,20/04/2015,02:20,Barcelona keen to show PSG no mercy,Barcelona defender Dani Alves has warned his side against complacency when they host a Paris Saint-Germain side bolstered by the return of key personnel through suspension to the Camp Nou on Tuesday.,"Two goals from Luis Suarez took Barca to the brink of a seventh Champions League semi-final in eight seasons as they romped to a 3-1 win in the first-leg of the quarter-final tie in Paris last week. However, a late own goal from Jeremy Mathieu offered the French champions a glimmer of hope as they welcome back top-scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic and midfield maestro Marco Verratti. ""We will not speculate with the result because we don't know how to,"" Alves, who has been linked with a move to PSG come the end of the season, told Barca's website. ""The philosophy and the spirit of the team is to challenge for every ball as if it was the last. ""We cannot think about our advantage, but just control the game and look to score from the first minute. That is the only way to overcome PSG."" Barca remained on course for a treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League with a hard-fought 2-0 win over Valencia on Saturday thanks to goals in the first and last minute from Suarez and Lionel Messi, who registered his 400th goal for the club. And Luis Enrique's men will also have key players back available as Alves returns after he too missed the first-leg through suspension, whilst Andres Iniesta is expected to overcome the back bruising he suffered at the Parc des Princes in time to feature. It would take a remarkable turnaround for PSG to progress to the semi-finals for the first time since 1995 as Barca haven't lost at home by more than one goal for nearly two years, when Bayern Munich rounded off a historic 7-0 aggregate thrashing of the Catalans with a 3-0 victory at the Camp Nou. However, domestically things have been far easier for PSG in recent weeks as two goals from Javier Pastore kept them a point clear of Lyon at the top of the table in a 3-1 win at Nice. David Luiz played the full 90 minutes despite his horror show when he was nutmegged twice by Suarez in the build-up to the Uruguayan's goals and insisted that he is not feeling the after-effects of a hamstring problem that was originally expected to keep him out of both legs of the tie. ""I do not feel any pain , I just feel tired after that match,"" said the Brazilian. ""In Barcelona we will do all we can. Of course we must still believe."" However, teammate Blaise Matuidi admitted they will have to defend an awful lot better against Barca's star front three of Messi, Suarez and Neymar to stand any chance. ""We must above all go without any complex and try everything to achieve what would be an amazing feat. ""We will be keen to show something different from the first-leg and primarily defend well because that's what we missed at the Parc des Princes."" PSG captain Thiago Silva has been included in the squad despite limping off with a thigh injury early on in the first leg, but Thiago Motta and Serge Aurier miss out through injury and suspension respectively."
956,19/04/2015,16:05,Thiago Motta ruled out of Barcelona return,"Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Thiago Motta has failed to recover from a thigh injury in time for Tuesday's decisive Champions League quarter-final, second leg against Barcelona, the French club announced Sunday.","The absence of the Brazil-born Italian, who picked up the injury in the league win over Marseille two weeks ago, is a massive blow for the Ligue 1 giants who have to overturn a 3-1 deficit in Spain. Brazilian David Luiz, however, was supposed to be sidelined for a month with a similar injury, but came back early and even featured in PSG's 3-1 victory of Nice on Saturday, a game where the former Chelsea defender was bestowed with the captain's armband. Ivory Coast right-back Serge Aurier, who is serving a three-match ban, is the only notable absence in the 21-man squad named by coach Laurent Blanc for the Nou Camp showdown. Captain Thiago Silva, who was rested against Nice, has been called up while Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti are also back after missing the first leg throughout suspension."
957,18/04/2015,19:07,PSG beat Nice to forget Barca defeat,Paris Saint-Germain bounced back from their Champions League humbling against Barcelona by beating Nice 3-1 on Saturday to boost their bid for a hat-trick of Ligue 1 titles.,"A clinical first half finish from Javier Pastore put PSG in charge against the run of play. Minutes later, Mathieu Bodmer deflected a speculative effort from Said Benrahma to level with the last kick of the half. But Paris took a decisive lead in the second half with a fine volley from Pastore and an Edinson Cavani penalty in a game sandwiched between Champions League commitments. PSG temporarily moved a point ahead Lyon at the top of the table ahead of Sunday's derby against Saint-Etienne. Nice remain mired in midtable in 11th but are still not sade, only six points above the relegation zone. With Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti suspended, on top of injuries to Thiago Silva and Thiago Motta, PSG coach Laurent Blanc had to rely on a reshuffled team to get past the French Riviera side. Lucas Moura, Serge Aurier and Lucas Digne were introduced into the starting line up while former Chelsea defender David Luiz, despite not being fully fit, was bestowed with the captain's armband. But it was Pastore's fourth goal of the season, following a defence-opening pass by Lucas, who gave PSG the breakthrough with their first real chance of the match. It was, however, quickly cancelled out by former Parisian Bodmer, although Nice still went into the half-time break frustrated to have nothing more to show form their first half dominance. The second half was a complete reversal, though, as Nice goalkeeper Simon Pouplin shined, preventing David Luiz and Lucas from finding the back of the net. Pastore added his second of the afternoon just after the hour mark as he latched onto a rebound after Pouplin saved his original driven effort. Cavani, brought down in the box by Jordan Amavi, bagged his ninth of the season on 69 minutes to seal the deal. Later on Saturday, Monaco can strengthen their grip on third by beating Rennes before looking to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit when they host Juventus in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final next week. At the foot, the bottom two Metz and Lens meet in what is almost certainly the last chance for either to avoid the drop. On Friday, Marseille's slump continued as Marcelo Bielsa's side went down to a 1-0 defeat at Nantes that further damaged their hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League."
958,17/04/2015,20:05,Financial losses worsen for French clubs,"French professional clubs registered combined losses of 93 million euros ($100m, £67.1m) during the 2013-14 season, a significant increase on the previous campaign, the Professional Football League (LFP) announced on Friday.","The figures are a sharp rise from the 39 million euros of combined losses for the 40 professional clubs in France's top two divisions in 2012/13, but most of the losses were registered by Monaco. Qatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain, who have the biggest annual budget in France at 495 million euros, lost just 300,000 euros last season and Marseille 12.5 million euros. However, Monaco, owned by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, reported a deficit of 76 million euros despite finishing second in their first season since winning promotion back to the top flight. The principality club relied on injections from their owner to make big signings in the transfer market but their inability to generate income is restricted by their notorious lack of support, with crowds at the Stade Louis II rarely above 10,000. ""Repeated losses show the difficulties encountered by clubs as they seek to develop income streams to cover considerable charges, notably wages as well as social charges and taxes,"" said the LFP. Combined income for French professional clubs last season was 1.7 billion euros, of which 43.4 percent came from Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco, the two Ligue 1 sides in this season's Champions League quarter-finals. All the losses have been incurred in Ligue 1, where the 20 clubs lost 102 million euros, while clubs in the second tier actually had a 9 million-euro surplus."
959,17/04/2015,17:44,PSG coach Blanc in favour of goal-line technology,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc on Friday said he was ""in favour"" of goal-line technology after the announcement that it would be introduced in Ligue 1 next season.","""I already said I was in favour of video technology, especially on the goal line. I think it's a good decision,"" said Blanc at a press conference ahead of PSG's trip to Nice on Saturday. ""It will allow us to tell, even if there are not many situations like it, whether the ball has crossed the line or not. That is the most important thing."" The technology will only be introduced in Ligue 1 and will not involve the lower leagues or the domestic cups. It was brought in to English football at the start of last season and was also used at last year's World Cup in Brazil, while it will also be applied in Germany and Italy next season as well at the women's World Cup in Canada in June."
960,17/04/2015,02:25,"Wounded Paris resume title chase, Lyon face derby rivals",Paris Saint-Germain will have little time to lick their wounds following their Champions League loss to Barcelona as they turn their focus back to the Ligue 1 title race for Saturday's trip to Nice.,"PSG are staring at a third successive exit from the Champions League at the quarter-final stage after losing 3-1 at home to Barcelona in the first leg at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday. The second leg at the Camp Nou awaits next Tuesday, but Laurent Blanc's side can ill afford a slip-up when they face Nice, 650 kilometres along the Mediterranean coast, at the Allianz Riviera on Saturday afternoon. Blanc acknowledged the game is one his side ""absolutely have to win"" as they lie a point behind leaders Lyon, albeit with a game in hand. Already banned against Barcelona in midweek, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Verratti will be suspended again, while captain Thiago Silva came off with a thigh injury in the first half on Wednesday and Blanc may not be willing to risk David Luiz after he had to play 70 minutes of the Champions League game after being rushed back from a hamstring problem. Having already beaten Lyon, Monaco and Marseille this season, mid-table Nice may therefore fancy their chances as they look to pull further clear of the relegation zone. However, when asked if he thought this was a good time to face PSG, Nice coach Claude Puel replied: ""I don't think so. I would have preferred to play PSG after a good result. For them, for French football and for us. ""They didn't play as well as they would have wanted against the Catalans and they will be eager to put in a better showing against us."" Lyon reclaimed top spot on Wednesday when they beat Bastia 2-0 thanks to late goals by Mohamed Yattara and Alexandre Lacazette, the latter getting his 25th in the league this season. Hubert Fournier's side have won their last two outings to boost their title chances but now they play host to Saint-Etienne in the most passionate derby in French football at the Stade de Gerland on Sunday evening. Lyon may have home advantage but Les Verts come into the Rhone derby in great shape, a run of seven games unbeaten in the league leaving them fifth in the table, two points shy of the podium. In addition, having struggled so badly in the derby for the last two decades, Christophe Galtier's team won 3-0 at home to Lyon in November and have lost on just one of their last six visits to their rivals. ""It is a chance for us to make the supporters and the city proud. It would be great if we could repeat our performance of last season but Lyon will want revenge,"" said Saint-Etienne midfielder Jeremy Clement, who started his career with Lyon. Monaco currently occupy the third and last qualifying berth for next season's Champions League as they prepare to welcome Rennes to the Stade Louis II on Saturday. ""For me it is the key game that we have to win if we are to finish on the podium. It is the most important match in Ligue 1 this year,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. His team are unbeaten in eight league games but this match falls between the two legs of their Champions League quarter-final tie against Juventus and captain Jeremy Toulalan could again miss out with a hamstring problem. A point behind Monaco in fourth, Marseille are at Nantes on Friday, while Bordeaux in sixth go to in-form Lille on Sunday. At the foot, the bottom two Metz and Lens meet in what is almost certainly the last chance for either to avoid the drop. Fixtures (kick-offs 1800 GMT unless stated)"
961,15/04/2015,02:30,Top French clubs boycott TV over incriminating film,Top French clubs Paris Saint Germain and Marseille are boycotting a leading French broadcaster for showing film of incidents which led to bans for star players Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Dimitri Payet.,"Both were punished for tirades aimed at referees which were shown by Canal Plus. As a reprisal, PSG and Marseille say they will not answer the station's questions after games or at press conferences until the end of the season. Paris coach Laurent Blanc rejected a question from Canal Plus after Saturday's League Cup final win over Bastia. The channel attended Blanc's press conference Tuesday ahead of PSG's Champions League quarter final clash against Barcelona, but it did not try to ask a question. Paris are furious at a four match ban imposed after Canal Plus pictures showed Swedish star Ibrahimovic in an expletive-laden rant against referees and France after his side lost at Bordeaux. French international Payet was banned for two matches for shouting at the referees room that Marseille had been ""screwed"" after a goal was disallowed in their 0-0 draw with title rivals Lyon. Again it was shown by the subscription broadcaster which, with BeIn Sport, has the rights to show French league games. France's two most popular clubs said in a statement they ""do not want to take the risk of being open to new sanctions linked to unfortunate comments provoked by a controversial refereeing decision."" They added that ""the number of Canal Plus group cameras and microphones that surround the teams in all circumstances, and the possibility of a retroactive judgement after the showing of images used as proof by football judges lead us to adopt this very great caution."" Canal Plus deputy director general Maxime Saada told AFP that the channel had become a ""hostage"" between the clubs and league disciplinary judges because of film taken around the Ligue 1 matches. He said this was ""stopping our teams of journalists from carrying out their jobs."" Saada said that Canal Plus was a ""respectful partner"" of French clubs and wants only to show ""the spectacle of Ligue 1 and its 20 clubs in its totality."" The channel currently pays 420 million euros ($448 million) a year to show French matches and from 2016 this will rise to 540 million euros a year. Despite Canal Plus protests, French clubs have been showing increasing mistrust of the channel. According to media reports, the Professional Football League planned to send Canal Plus an official letter warning it to stick to their contract. Under the deal between the broadcaster and the clubs, it promises ""not to promote scenes contrary to the image of football"" and ""to give a positive image of football putting the emphasis on beautiful gestures and the beautiful game."" League officials have indicated that if Canal Plus does not change its ways it could be stopped from filming off the pitch. Some clubs also feel they get a more critical treatment from Canal Plus than from the rival BeIn Sport, representatives told AFP. But Lyon coach Hubert Fournier said television channels should not be ""falsely accused"" for the actions of players. ""From the moment you accept them (TV cameras) in these mixed zones, it is for the actors to be conscious of their comments and actions to avoid this kind of scandal,"" said Fournier. The French government's Secretary of State for Sport Thierry Braillard said he was ""profoundly surprised and disappointed"" at the decision of Paris and Marseille."
962,14/04/2015,21:16,PSG appeal Ibrahimovic ban to French Olympic Committee,"Paris Saint-Germain are appealing against Zlatan Ibrahimovic's four-match ban to the French Olympic Committee (CNOSF), France's highest sporting authority, sources confirmed to AFP on Tuesday.","Ibrahimovic, 33, received the ban for comments attacking France and its referees after a 3-2 defeat to Bordeaux, and will miss upcoming Ligue 1 games aagainst Nice, Lille, Metz and Nantes. If the CNOSF quickly decide to appoint a mediator, Ibrahimovic's sanction would be suspended and the Swedish forward could return to the pitch while awaiting a final decision. The mediator can decide to confirm the sanction, propose a different sanction or send the player before a disciplinary commission. PSG are still in the running for an unprecedented four trophies after winning the League Cup last weekend, and Ibrahimovic's absence would be a blow to their chances. The Ligue 1 champions already take on Barcelona in the Champions League on Wednesday without him after the tempestuous striker was suspended for his sending off against Chelsea in the last 16. And playing against Bordeaux, Ibrahimovic was left furious at refereeing decisions in the game which PSG lost despite his two goals, and the striker appeared to insult a match official as he left the field. And he went on: ""In 15 years, I have never seen such a referee. In this shit country, this country does not deserve PSG. We are too good for this country."" Amid a political furore, Ibrahimovic quickly made a video apology for the comments. Marseille have already appealed to the CNOSF against French international Dimitri Payet's two-match ban after he was also caught on film insulting a referee in a foul-mouthed rant. The day after the sanctions both PSG and Marseille announced they would be boycotting Canal Plus for broadcasting the offensive comments made by their players."
963,14/04/2015,16:05,Blanc looks to draw lessons from past Barcelona clashes,Memories of their agonising Champions League exits in the last two seasons will spur Paris Saint-Germain on when they host Barcelona in the first leg of their quarter-final on Wednesday.,"The clubs meet at the Parc des Princes with the French champions desperate to make it to the last four after losing to Barcelona and Chelsea in the quarter-finals in each of the last two seasons, both times on away goals. But their 3-2 win against the Catalans in Paris in the group stage, and the character they showed to beat Chelsea on away goals in the last 16, despite the sending-off of Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the first half at Stamford Bridge, suggest they have what it takes to make the leap forward this time. ""Beating Chelsea, in a stadium where it is very difficult to get a result, showed that we have the quality, so why not do it again,"" said former Barcelona defender Maxwell at an eve-of-game press conference at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday. The Brazilian talked of reaching the semi-finals as a ""dream"", but he and his team-mates must work out how to avoid conceding a potentially crucial away goal against the potent Barcelona front three of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez. Asked if the thrilling win against the Catalans last September could be used as a reference point, PSG coach Laurent Blanc responded: ""It is one of many games we have looked at to prepare this match. ""We have looked at what we need to do and what we need to avoid doing. We can draw lessons from that game, because we won it and are one of the only sides in Europe to have scored three goals against Barcelona. ""But there are things we need to make sure we don't do, like concede an away goal, especially going away from home in the second leg. ""Lots of teams play Barcelona with the aim of not conceding, but they are a team who can play anywhere in Europe and score goals with the players they have. ""One of the goals they scored here was like something out of the Playstation."" The goal in question was scored by Messi, while Neymar was also on target, but PSG claimed the three points that night thanks to strikes from David Luiz, Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi. Barcelona claimed revenge, and top spot in Group F, by winning 3-1 at the Camp Nou in December, with Messi, Neymar and Suarez all scoring after Ibrahimovic had put the visitors ahead. While Ibrahimovic is suspended this time, Blanc is faced with the conundrum of how to stop Messi, who scored his 45th goal of the season in Saturday's 2-2 draw at Sevilla. ""People say that, when he only scores 40 goals, he has something wrong with him,"" said Blanc. ""Putting a man marker on him would be the best thing for him and also the best way for us to have a player sent off."" As well as Ibrahimovic, the home side will be without the banned Verratti and the injured David Luiz. Blanc confirmed that Lucas will be involved following his return from two months out in Saturday's League Cup final win against Bastia, but he played down the chances of seeing Thiago Motta make the team despite confirming that his hamstring injury, suffered against Marseille on April 5, is not as bad as was feared. ""Motta has started running again, which is great news because after Marseille a lot of people thought it was serious. Nevertheless we will need a little miracle for him to start the game tomorrow."""
964,14/04/2015,02:10,"Without Ibrahimovic, PSG renew Barcelona rivalry","Diminished by injuries and suspensions, Paris Saint-Germain renew hostilities with Barcelona on Wednesday as the sides clash at the Parc des Princes in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.","PSG have been eliminated in the last eight on away goals in each of the last two seasons, including losing to Barcelona in 2013. As they look to finally make it back to the semi-finals of Europe's elite club competition for the first time in 20 years, the side from the French capital could hardly be in better form. A point clear at the top of Ligue 1, they are on course to win an unprecedented clean sweep of the domestic honours after mercilessly crushing Bastia 4-0 in the final of the League Cup at the weekend. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice in that game, having netted a hat-trick in last midweek's 4-1 French Cup semi-final defeat of Saint-Etienne to reach a century of goals for the club. The Swede has scored 13 times in his last seven matches for club and country, but he will miss the meeting with one of his former clubs due to suspension after being sent off in the second leg of the last-16 win over Chelsea last month. Ibrahimovic is also about to begin a four-game domestic ban, so PSG must get used to being without their talisman, who has 28 goals in total this season. ""He was good, very good,"" said Blanc of Ibrahimovic's display in the League Cup final. ""His objective now is the second leg against Barcelona in 10 days. He will get some rest."" Blanc must also do without Marco Verratti due to suspension, while David Luiz and Thiago Motta have hamstring injuries, although the return to fitness of the likes of Yohan Cabaye and Lucas does provide some consolation. In any case, the absence of Ibrahimovic may not prove as crucial as it appears at first glance. After all, he was injured when Paris beat Barcelona 3-2 at the Parc des Princes in a thrilling group-stage game in September. He was back by the time the sides met at the Camp Nou in December and even scored in that game, but could not prevent Barcelona winning 3-1 on the night. And it was with 10 men following the Swede's sending-off that the French champions rallied to eliminate Chelsea on away goals on a remarkable evening at Stamford Bridge. That game felt like something of a coming of age for PSG in Europe, but the test that awaits them against Barcelona cannot be underestimated, even if they are unbeaten in 33 European home games stretching back almost nine years. ""It will be very difficult but it could be extraordinary,"" reasoned midfielder Blaise Matuidi. ""We have already shown that we can compete against them and even beat them. We will need to be at 150 percent, even with all the absences. We will give everything."" In contrast to their hosts, Barcelona come into their eighth consecutive quarter-final in the competition with only one notable player missing in the shape of right-back Dani Alves, who is suspended. Luis Enrique's side are top of La Liga but not everything is rosy for the Catalans just now after they threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Sevilla on Saturday, despite a 45th goal of the season for Lionel Messi. Neymar also scored in that game but could not hide his disgust later on when he was substituted and the Brazilian will now be eager to get back on the field against PSG after netting in both meetings between the sides in the group stage. ""We must make as few mistakes as possible and not concede,"" warned another of Barcelona's Brazilians, Adriano. ""They have quality players who need only the slightest opportunity to score goals. They are very dangerous on the break."""

The Swedish forward scored his tenth goal in just five games a few minutes before half-time, controlling Mathieu Peybernes' poor headed clearance before lashing a shot inside the bottom corner. Cavani added a third with a superb header, finding himself at the end of Serge Aurier's cross. The Uruguay striker grabbed his 20th goal of the season and put the final nail in the Corsican side's coffin in injury time thanks to a brilliantly-timed pass by Ibrahimovic that sent him through on goal.

""The club deplores the severity with which its player has been sanctioned, given his immense contribution to the image of French football, both in France and internationally,"" PSG countered in a statement. ""The club would also highlight, in this respect, that the player's only hearings at the disciplinary commission have been requested after supplementary reports were made following viewing of images after the act. ""It is, once again, after viewing images filmed by a television crew, that the commission decided to impose a disproportionate sanction on the player; one that denies Paris Saint-Germain a key player during this crucial period of the season and its quest for domestic success.""

The final will be a repeat of the first ever League Cup final in 1995 when PSG defeated Bastia 2-0 in front of less than 25,000 fans at the Parc des Princes. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was suspended on Thursday for four matches for a tirade towards a referee and saying: ""In this shit country, this country does not deserve PSG. We are too good for this country."" But the Swedish star remains eligible to play with the ban not being applied until next Tuesday. He fired home a stylish hat-trick on Wednesday as PSG brushed aside Saint-Etienne to also reach the French Cup final against second division Auxerre on May 30. While their Swedish talisman remains the centre of attention in the world of French football, he is set to miss key league matches due to his outburst while a one match suspension also means he misses the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final at home to Barcelona next Wednesday. However despite the recent criticism towards the 33-year-old striker from Malmo, Blanc lept to the defence of his key man and said much of it was unwaranted. ""What I saw, after our victory at the Velodrome (3-2 win over Marseille on Sunday), was the scathing criticism directed towards him (Ibrahimovic) by certain members of the media that I really didn't understand,"" said the former France and Bordeaux coach. ""These players are not machines. You can put doubt over a performance in one match but not the player himself who is still an extraordinary player. The Parc des Princes outfit have also hit the top of Ligue 1 thanks to the win at Marseille and with seven matches to play they have a one point lead over Lyon in their bid for a third straight league title. Reaching two finals is also immense pride for Blanc and the club's Qatari owners who have financed the club's rise to the top in France while they are now also challenging for top European honours. ""I am very proud to coach these boys here. I am really seeing what I want to see on the pitch and that gives me great satisfaction."" ""Of course the more the season advances, we are thinking more about it (the quadruple) but we haven't done anything yet and we haven't won anything."" added Blanc. Bastia are their surprise opponents after defeating Monaco on penalties in the semi-finals to reach their first League Cup final since the defeat against PSG in 1995. The Corsican club who got off to a sluggish start to their season, which prompted the sacking of Claude Makelele as coach and the arrival of Ghislain Printant, are five points above the relegation zone and in good position to stay in the top flight. The club, who will bring a strong and vociferous crowd of support to the Stade de France, won their only piece of major silverware in 1981 when they defeated Saint-Etienne 2-1 to win the French Cup."

He will, however, be eligible to play in PSG's League Cup final against Bastia on Saturday. A day after scoring a brilliant hat-trick, Ibrahimovic stayed away from Thursday's hearing of the disciplinary commission of the Professional Football League (LFP). He was instead represented by a lawyer and two PSG officials. LFP commission president Sebastien Deneux said Ibrahimovic's comments were ""rude and insulting"". The hearing has tarnished another stellar week for the Swede whose hat-trick in a 4-1 French Cup semi-final win over Saint Etienne took him to 102 goals for Paris Saint-Germain in less than three seasons. He is now only seven goals behind the club record 107 by Portuguese star Pauleta. But the Swede's stormy personality keeps getting him in trouble. He was banned for two matches in February for a foul on Saint Etienne's Romain Hamouma which was not immediately seen by the referee but was caught on video. Another match ban was suspended. Ibrahimovic has since been banned by UEFA for his sending off against Chelsea. And televised images were again his downfall against Bordeaux in March. Furious at referee decisions in the game which PSG lost despite Ibrahimovic's two goals, the Swede appeared to insult a match official as he left the field. And he went on: ""In 15 years, I have never seen such a referee. In this shit country, this country does not deserve PSG. We are too good for this country."" Amid a political furore, Ibrahimovic quickly made a video apology for the comments. With Ibrahimovic in domineering form, Paris will miss him for any lengthy suspension as they target an unprecedented domestic championship, French Cup and League Cup treble. Paris coach Laurent Blanc reckons a quadruple with the Champions League is also possible."
973,09/04/2015,20:41,Ibrahimovic faces long ban for anti-France rant,"A day after scoring a brilliant hat-trick, Paris Saint-Germain's tempestuous striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic stayed away Thursday from a disciplinary hearing which could impose a long ban for his comments attacking France and its referees.","The 33-year-old Swedish star faces up to five matches on the Ligue 1 sidelines for a widely televised rant in which he said France did not deserve a team like the star-studded Paris Saint-Germain because of the way it is treated. Ibrahimovic did not turn up for the French league's disciplinary commission hearing. He was represented by a lawyer and two Paris Saint Germain officials. The commission could impose a four-match ban on Ibrahimovic and activate a suspended one-match ban imposed in January. Ibrahimovic will already be missing for the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Barcelona next week after his sending off against Chelsea in the last 16. The hearing has tarnished another stellar week for the Swede whose hat-trick in a 4-1 French Cup semi-final win over Saint Etienne took him to 102 goals for Paris Saint-Germain in less than three seasons.

974,09/04/2015,00:17,Zlatan hat-trick fires PSG into French Cup final,A Zlatan Ibrahimovic hat-trick fired Paris Saint-Germain to a 4-1 French Cup semi-final victory over Saint-Etienne at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday as their epic quest for a four-trophy sweep continued apace.,"Ibrahimovic's opener from the penalty spot on the 21st minute was his 100th goal for the club, he then rounded the 'keeper on 81 for the second, and completed his hat-trick with a fine run and shot in injury-time. But an injury-depleted Paris had to fight for long periods of this gutsy Cup tie as Saint-Etienne drew level with a Romain Hamouma header, going in 1-1 at half-time before an Ezequiel Lavezzi header put PSG back ahead on 60. Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier praised Swede Ibrahimovic as ""the greatest foreigner to have played in France"" as he lamented his side's inability to match PSG's pounding artillery. PSG have scored 11 times against Saint-Etienne in four matches this season of which eight have come off Ibrahimovic's boot. ""There's nothing to say, at this level they are unbeatable, in any case for us,"" said Galtier. ""They had the perfect match, in intensity, technical plan, determination. It's never good to take on this type of team so near the final. ""I'm disappointed for my players that they weren't able to go all the way in this adventure. But that's all, there was too big a difference. ""They are a war machine. They were superior on all levels."" PSG now face second division Auxerre, who beat holders Guingamp 1-0 on Tuesday, in the Cup final at the Stade de France on May 30. Paris also take on Bastia in the League Cup final at the same venue on Saturday, face Barcelona in Paris in the Champions League quarter-finals first-leg next Wednesday and they lead Ligue 1 by a single point from Lyon. No French club has ever clinched the domestic treble. ""As long as we're in the running on four fronts, we're thinking about this quadruple, but nothing is won yet,"" said PSG coach Laurent Blanc. ""They aren't machines. You get used to the players scoring two or three goals per match. They also have the right to be a little tired. Zlatan was tired against Marseille (last weekend). ""They are an exceptional group of players and Zlatan is one of them. I'm proud to coach these boys. I've a fantastic group, with an enormous capacity to work."" With defender David Luiz, midfielder Thiago Motta, and forwards Edinson Cavani and Lucas all ruled out through injury, coach Laurent Blanc also rested Blaise Matuidi with a packed calendar of matches coming PSG's way. The giant Swede converted his spot-kick with aplomb after Lavezzi had been tugged from behind and the referee awarded a generous penalty. But Saint-Etienne stormed back at the Parisians and were level four minutes later when Hamouma's glancing header from a free-kick curled beyond 'keeper Nicolas Douchez at the near post. Mevlut Erding should then have given the visitors the lead after 32 minutes, but he hesitated when through on Douchez, who deflected his tardy shot to safety. Lavezzi then ran onto a sumptuous cross from Pastore just after the hour and rose alone on the edge of the six-yard box, his looping header leaving Stephane Ruffier rooted to the spot as the ball crept just inside his far post. Ibrahimovic then calmed home nerves running onto a through ball to round the 'keeper and slot home into an empty net to send the stadium wild. His third goal was equally extravagant as his trademark dribble found him a glimmer of space to shoot home his 102nd goal for the club. Ibrahimovic becomes PSG's second top all-time scorer, seven shy of Pauleta's 109 goals. Saint-Etienne 'keeper Stephane Ruffier kept his side in contention early in the first half as Paris came out all guns blazing, saving twice from Lavezzi and stopping a fierce Javier Pastore shot as a series of goal efforts zipped wide. On Tuesday second division Auxerre turned back the clock on past glories as they beat holders Guingamp 1-0. Relegated in 2012, Auxerre won a league and cup double under legendary coach Guy Roux in 1996 while also lifting the Cup in 1994, 2003 and 2005."
975,08/04/2015,18:16,Fans to appear in court after Marseille-PSG match trouble,"Four fans arrested after violence during last weekend's Ligue 1 clash between Marseille and Paris Saint-Germain have been ordered to appear in court in the southern city, legal sources said Wednesday.","One supporter is accused of throwing a smoke bomb, while the others face public order offences after fans clashed with riot police outside the Stade Velodrome last Sunday. A date for their court appearance has not yet been set. Officers used tear gas to disperse troublemakers after some supporters tried to block traffic near the stadium, a police spokesman told AFP. A bus carrying PSG players to the Velodrome was struck by objects thrown, including a golf ball which smashed a window. PSG reclaimed top spot in the French Ligue 1 from Lyon after beating third-placed Marseille 3-2. Some 65,000 spectators packed into the Velodrome for the match dubbed 'Le Classique'."
976,06/04/2015,00:02,PSG beat Marseille to reclaim Ligue 1 summit,Paris Saint-Germain must now be considered favourites to win a third consecutive Ligue 1 title after coming from behind to beat fierce enemies Marseille 3-2 in 'Le Classique' at the Stade Velodrome on Sunday.,"Marseille held a 2-1 lead at the interval thanks to Andre-Pierre Gignac's brace either side of a Blaise Matuidi beauty, but two goals in the first six minutes of the second half swung the match decisively in the capital club's favour. Marquinhos equalised and then Jeremy Morel's own goal in the 51st minute allowed PSG to claim a seventh consecutive victory against OM in all competitions as Laurent Blanc's side moved back to the top of the table, a point above Lyon. ""Unfortunately tonight (Sunday), we lost two players which is worrying for the upcoming matches,"" Matuidi told Canal Plus tv in reference to injuries picked up by David Luiz and Thiago Motta. ""Overall, we played a great match but it wasn't easy against a good Marseille team, but I think the best team won. ""It's up to us to fight to the end and we'll do everything to win a maximum of trophies,"" added Matuidi with PSG in the hunt for the league title, Champions League, French Cup and League Cup. PSG coach Laurent Blanc was happy with the win but disappointed with the injuries. ""We'll savour the victory but we paid an expensive price because we lost two players. That is a problem but we are very happy to have won here at Marseille,"" said the former Bordeaux and France coach. ""To have won is a very, very good job done tonight (Sunday). (Blaise) Matuidi was amazing with his physical game and he worked hard this week to try and score a goal because we were winding him up a bit. ""He hasn't had much success in front of goal,"" added the former Marseille defender. Marseille are now five points off top spot in third, which will surely prove fatal to their title chances. Not only that, but Bielsa's team -- who had Andre Ayew red-carded after the final whistle -- are hanging onto the third and final Champions League qualifying berth, with fourth-placed Monaco only three points behind with a game in hand. There was an intimidating environment for Paris, whose team bus was struck by missiles -- including a golf ball that smashed a window -- en route to the ground. It was Marseille who opened the scoring on the half-hour mark, Gignac switching the play to Dimitri Payet on the right and then outmuscling Marquinhos to head home his team-mate's cross at the back post. When Paris lost David Luiz to a hamstring injury, it looked like it would not be their night, but Matuidi silenced the Velodrome in the 35th minute with a magnificent curling strike into the far top corner of the net on his weaker right foot. However, Marseille reclaimed the lead two minutes before the interval. Alaixys Romao hounded Pastore out of possession in midfield and suddenly Gignac found himself through on goal with just Salvatore Sirigu to beat. His finish for his 18th goal of the season was cool, and the home support greeted the half-time whistle as though they had won the game. But PSG drew level on 49 minutes, Marquinhos firing into the roof of the net after a Zlatan Ibrahimovic free-kick struck Rod Fanni inside the box and broke to the Brazilian defender. And two minutes after that they scored again, Morel turning a Pastore ball from the left into his own net under pressure from Ibrahimovic. They are in pole position with seven games of the season remaining, although they saw Thiago Motta limp off injured late on and Lyon remain very much in contention after winning 3-1 at Guingamp on Saturday. Monaco came from behind to draw 1-1 with Saint-Etienne on Friday, and while they have a game in hand to play against Montpellier on Tuesday, their sole focus now is on securing a top-three finish. Elsewhere on Sunday, an injury-time goal by substitute Nicolas Maurice-Belay gave Bordeaux a 2-1 home victory against relegation-threatened Lens. Mariano had given Bordeaux the lead only for Pablo Chavarria to equalise for the visitors, who are bottom. Caen moved six points clear of the relegation zone after coming from behind to win 2-1 at Nantes. Alejandro Bedoya put the Canaries ahead early on but Emiliano Sala levelled with a penalty 10 minutes from time and a Thomas Lemar free-kick evaded everyone to end up in the net in stoppage time as the Normandy side claimed a first win in four."
977,05/04/2015,17:50,Ibrahimovic rumoured to have applied for US visa,"Paris Saint-Germain star Zlatan Ibrahimovic has applied for a US visa, according to a Swedish media report on Sunday, stoking speculation about his future with the Ligue 1 champions.","Ahead of Sunday's crucial game against Marseille, tabloid Aftonbladet said the 33-year-old PSG striker had applied for a non-tourist visa at the US embassy in Paris last month. ""He was there on March 19 and applied,"" an anonymous source told the paper, adding that the immigrant visa he applied for allows long-term stays. The Swede has a contract with PSG until June 2016 and has previously said he considered ending his career with a major North American club. While speculation was rife over whether Ibrahimovic was already in discussions with a club, Aftonbladet said there had been suggestions that the trip could also be related to an advertising contract. Ibrahimovic will go before the disciplinary commission of the French league on April 9 for scathing comments targeting the referee and the country of France after PSG's 3-2 top flight defeat at Bordeaux on March 15."
978,04/04/2015,15:44,Blanc unhappy at scheduling of Marseille clash,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc on Saturday hit out at the decision to schedule his side's crunch clash with Marseille, known as the Classique, for the weekend immediately after an international break.","""To play the Classique after this international break is not the best of ideas. I only had the whole squad available yesterday, including two Argentinians who came back yesterday morning with their heads all over the place,"" Blanc said ahead of Sunday night's showdown. ""There is nothing we can do about it. They did three laps of the pitch."" PSG had 10 first-team regulars away with their countries over the last week, including Argentina's Ezequiel Lavezzi and Javier Pastore, who were involved in friendly matches in the United States. ""A match like this deserves a week's preparation. Everyone's expecting great football and goals in a game like this, but I don't think the players will be in the best condition, especially the South Americans. ""It's a shame, but I think a little more coherence would have allowed the game to be scheduled on another date."" The game at the Stade Velodrome, the biggest fixture in French football, could be crucial in determining who goes on to win the Ligue 1 title. PSG started the weekend a point clear of Lyon at the top of the table, with Marseille another point back in third. ""Given how open the league is, one can imagine that the very last match will be decisive. This will be an important game between two contenders for the title but there are only three points at stake,"" Blanc said. ""We need to hold on to first place. When you are first, if you don't slip up you have your destiny in your hands. With eight games left it is not a bad position to be in."" Brazilian winger Lucas, who has not played since mid-February, will again be missing for Paris but everyone else is available. This will be the first of eight games in the next 24 days for Paris, who had wanted next Wednesday's French Cup semi-final against Saint-Etienne to be postponed until a later date but saw their request rejected. They face Bastia in the League Cup final next Saturday and then take on Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-final first leg on April 15."
979,03/04/2015,02:27,Swedes' love for Ibrahimovic unshaken by outburst,"A foul-mouthed outburst by Paris Saint-Germain star Zlatan Ibrahimovic has drawn virtually no criticism in his native Sweden, where churlish comments have only underscored his image as a straight-talking underdog.","The 33-year-old will face the French league's disciplinary commission on April 9 for comments made after PSG's defeat at Bordeaux on March 15, when he labelled France a ""shit country"" that ""does not deserve PSG."" French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said he was ""shocked"", while far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen suggested the Swede could leave France if he was unhappy. But in Sweden few people were upset or even surprised by the spat. Mats Lilienberg, who played with Ibrahimovic at Malmo, painted a picture of a hardworking, focused athlete whose hyperbole was only part of his charm. Beneath the swagger he ""is another person if you know him,"" the 45-year-old former teammate told AFP. ""He was coming up, he was young and cocky. He was exactly the same then as he is today. But... he's very kind, humble. He's there for people who are close to him,"" he said. In Ibrahimovic's hometown of Malmo there were no signs that the French controversy had dented the image of the city's own superstar. ""He's got class, he's got good character. His attitude is not always good but you still like it,"" 16-year-old Elias Abdullah said on the sidelines of a school football tournament. ""It's not every day that a small guy from Rosengaard becomes the world's best football player,"" he added, referring to the immigrant-heavy neighbourhood where Ibrahimovic, like himself, once lived. Ibrahimovic, born in Sweden to a Bosnian father and a Croatian mother, admitted in a 2011 autobiography that the first time he ventured into the city centre was in his late teens, feeling like an outsider who knew very little about the country's top footballers until he became one himself. ""I mean, I was from Rosengaard. I didn't give a damn about the Swedes. I'd been following the Brazilians,"" he said. Since then he's made a remarkable journey into mainstream Swedish culture, winning numerous awards. A ""fantastic class journey"", as detailed in his best-selling autobiography, helped boost his popularity in the country, says Cristine Sarrimo, an assistant professor of literature at Lund University. The story was a ""myth about an anti-hero who... succeeds against the odds, completely on his own merits,"" she said. Anja Gatu, a sports columnist at regional daily Sydsvenskan, said that even though he still had his detractors -- some of whom could be found among the anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats -- Ibrahimovic's football skills had won over the Swedish public after an initially rocky start. The fact that he ""never made a secret of wanting to be the best"" coupled with his brash comments -- sometimes made in jest but misunderstood -- sat uneasily with some Swedes, she said. Gatu herself took offence in 2013 when he waded into a row over the Swedish FA's decision to reward Swedish midfielder Anders Svensson with a car, but not his female counterpart Therese Sjoegran. ""They can have a bicycle with my autograph and that will be enough,"" Ibrahimovic told tabloid Expressen, adding that the criticism of the award was casting a pall over Svensson's achievements. In a country where even prime ministers have labelled themselves feminists, there was no shortage of outrage. ""We're not as patriotic in Sweden as they are in France,"" said Daniel Kristofferson, a sports journalist at Expressen. The Bordeaux tantrum may not have been entirely unintentional as ""he does very few things that are not planned,"" he suggested. ""Is it that he's gotten fed up? He usually switches club after three years,"" he added."

""It's a wonderful achievement, good news. It shows work well done,"" said Marquinhos as PSG sit top of Ligue 1. ""I'm very happy they've shown this confidence in me. It's a new stage in my life,"" he continued. ""Paris Saint-Germain is a big team, recognised all over the world. We're playing Champions League so the level is progressing. I'm progressing here."" PSG's Qatari president Nasser Al-Khelaifi added: ""Marquinhos represents the club's future and the renewal of his contract is a strong sign of what he means to PSG. ""We're very happy to be able to prolong our adventure with this talented young player.While the biggest European clubs are following Marquinhos, this extension reinforces PSG's long-term ambitions."""

In this shit country, this country does not deserve PSG. We are too good for this country."" However, during a press conference in Solna, near Stockhom, ahead of Sweden's Euro 2016 qualifying trip to Moldova on Friday, Ibrahimovic said: ""I was punished instead of the referee for errors that he made."" When asked if the referee in the game in question, Lionel Jaffredo, deserved to be punished, Ibrahimovic replied: ""No idea. What do you think? We are punished, he isn't."" His comments about France drew criticism from French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, but Ibrahimovic said he enjoyed playing in Ligue 1, where he arrived from AC Milan in 2012. ""I like France! Everything else is rubbish. I would not have come to France if I didn't like it, and I certainly wouldn't have extended my contract if I didn't like it. I would not have played for so long if I didn't like it,"" he said. The 33-year-old also hit out at the decision to hand him a one-match Champions League ban following his sending-off against Chelsea recently. ""If you look at the situation, I am going to be punished more for an unjustifiable red card than the referee for his mistake... It is not acceptable,"" he said. He will miss the first leg of PSG's quarter-final against his old club Barcelona in Paris on April 15."

""I am shocked by the remarks in equal measure about the refereeing as about France,"" he said. ""I would urge him to behave in an exemplary manner all the time."" Far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen even suggested Ibrahimovic could leave the country if he felt that way, but others have supported him. ""He's a world class player,"" Sweden coach Eric Hamren said, and reminded everyone that a fly-on-the-wall camera inside any dressing would be highly revealing. But the French referees' union, SAFE, called the outburst ""a new torrent of hate and verbal violence"" by Ibrahimovic, who stands to pick up a ban of up to five domestic games. He will, however, be available on Friday, as he will not learn his fate until April 9. That means he will also be free to play in the the league game with title rivals Marseille after the international break, a French Cup quarter-final with Saint Etienne and a League Cup final with Bastia the week after. PSG are in fact still chasing four trophies after eliminating Chelsea in the Champions League last week, where Ibrahimovic was sent off for a muscular foul on Oscar. Ibrahimovic was, however, trying to pull out of a wild challenge and Paris are holding their breath to see if the ban is for one or two games. In the meantime, PSG will discover their quarter-final opponents in Friday's draw. The French champions currently lie second in Ligue 1 on 56 points, two behind Lyon and two ahead of Marseille with nine games to go. But with matches coming thick and fast, injuries are racking up. They lost Yohan Cabaye to a knee injury 10 minutes into his comeback last week while David Luiz has a thigh strain but is suspended, anyway. His natural replacement Marquinhos also has a thigh strain and Lucas Moura and Serge Aurier are both also sidelined with injuries. On the bright side, Argentine attacking midfielder Javier Pastore is on a run of brilliant form and coach Laurent Blanc has an enviable pool of talent to select from. Lorient will bank on a trio of young strikers, Jordan Ayew, Raphael Guerreiro and Benjamin Jeannot, who have 22 goals between them for the club that is 15th on 34 points and who have won two, lost two and drawn one of their last five games. Leaders Lyon will be aiming to stay top ahead of the international break and have thir top French goalscorer Alexandre Lacazette back in fine form for the visit of Nice. Third-placed Marseille, will hope to build on their return to form which has featured a 6-1 hammering of Toulouse and a 0-0 draw with Lyon, where they were denied a good goal for offside, when they travel to second bottom Lens.

Senegalese international Lamine Sane rose highest to meet a cross into the heart of the area and sent a glancing header past the despairing dive of PSG's Italian 'keeper Salvatore Sirigu. There was more concern for Blanc and his defending champions when star defender David Luiz pulled up lame clutching his hamstring and came off immediately just before half-time. Ibrahimovic then poached his 13th league goal of the season following a goalkeeping howler from Cedric Carasso five minutes after the break. The Sweden captain, who was shown a controversial straight red card against Chelsea, used his striking instincts to flick the ball past Carasso after the 'keeper and Portuguese defender Thiago Ilori made a botched job of clearing a bouncing ball in the box. Bordeaux then took the lead again when Wahbi Khazri found himself completely unmarked inside the area and was able to place his header past the helpless Sirigu with 20 minutes left.

Lyon are a point clear of the capital club with 57 points from 28 games, and four ahead of Marseille in third. The leading trio are all in action on Sunday with Lyon also travelling to third-placed Marseille, as PSG travel to Bordeaux. All eyes will be on Laurent Blanc's PSG following wild celebrations after they survived the early sending off of star Zlatan Ibrahimovic against Chelsea to advance to the Champions League last eight. However, Blanc warned ""we don't have time to enjoy these moments"" as they prepared for Sunday's game in western France. Bordeaux striker Isaac Kiese Thelin feels his side, who are sixth, will be the fresher. ""They'll have played a match more than us. We'll obviously be fresher,"" said Kiese Thelin, who is relishing a clash with fellow Swede Ibrahimovic. ""He's an excellent player and we need to be wary of him because he's capable of anything."" Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas meanwhile said he was hoping for at least a draw in a key clash at the Stade Velodrome. ""What's important is to remain in the top three,"" said Aulas. ""It's more important for Marseille than for Lyon because we stay ahead of them in any case. ""If we could at least draw and keep our four points advantage (on Marseille) it would allow us to approach the last nine matches of the championship more positively."" A win would see Lyon pull seven points clear of Marseille, who can close the gap with victory. Aulas admitted that confidence was high after last weekend's success. ""The Montpellier match was a breakthrough for us in terms of talent, team spirit and if we can maintain this mindset we can envisage getting a good result in Marseille."" PSG's European success should provide a source of inspiration for Monaco as they prepare to defend a 3-1 advantage against Arsenal at home next Tuesday. In the meantime it's Bastia, tenth in Ligue 1, but carrying some momentum in 2015, who arrive at the Louis II Stadium. ""For me Arsenal is not the most important,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. ""The most important is always the next one. And it's Bastia."" Monaco have painful memories of last month's League Cup semi-final defeat at home to the Corsicans in a penalty shootout. So it will be with a spirit of revenge that Jardim's side, who are fourth in Ligue 1 but with a game in hand, approach the game as they look to close the gap with the top three. Nice take on relegation rivals Guingamp at home on Friday, while on Saturday St Etienne, in fifth, travel to tailenders Metz. Elsewhere, Montpellier look to bounce back from their defeat to Lyon when they host Reims as Nantes host Evian and Lens welcome southerners Toulouse with Normandy side Caen travelling to Brittany outfit Lorient.

The Champions League quarter-final, set for April 14 or 15, adds to an already busy schedule and will be the Ligue 1 giants' fourth game in just 10 days. According to a PSG source, the club are in the process of making a written request for a delay to the French Football Federation. PSG are gunning for an unprecedented quadruple as they are still in both Cups, the Champions League after knocking out Chelsea, and Laurent Blanc's side are placed second in Ligue 1, one point behind leaders Lyon.

""I am not surprised that PSG, even with one man down, beat Chelsea,"" Platini said in Lyon on the sidelines of a committee meeting for Euro 2016, to be hosted by France. ""It's a great achievement. They are already ready to win the tournament, they have the team to win it. They are programmed to do so,"" the Frenchman added. Held 1-1 in their last 16, first leg, tie at the Parc des Princes, the Parisians advanced by twice coming from behind in the second leg. Captain Thiago Silva scored an extra-time header for 10-man PSG to clinch a 2-2 draw, leaving it all square at 3-3 over the two legs and sending the Parisians through on away goals. The French press hailed the achievement on Thursday which sports daily L'Equipe headlined as 'Heroic'. ""A Capital Exploit,"" the newspaper continued, saying the victory ""was among the most glorious nights in the Parisian club's history"", on a par with victories over Real Madrid in 1993 and Barcelona in 1995 when they reached the semi-finals of Europe's elite competition. ""The Parisians qualified for the Champions League quarter-finals by being stronger than Chelsea and fewer on the pitch,"" L'Equipe said. ""Above all, don't stop,"" it urged. PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi agreed that the PSG ""project was on the right track"". ""Qualifying here (in London), against (Jose) Mourinho's Chelsea was difficult. Before the game, I told the players face to face that we could do it. Everyone believed it. I'm very proud,"" said the Qatari businessman. ""We played over 95 minutes as warriors, in an incredible atmosphere which made us think we were at home. ""Since we bought the club (in 2011), we have believed in our European ambitions. After beating a team such as Chelsea, I believe we can go far. Our project is on the right track."""

""I don't know if I have to get angry or start to laugh,"" he told reporters at Stamford Bridge. ""For me, when I saw the red card I was like, 'The guy doesn't know what he's doing.' That is not the worst. The worst is when I got the red card, all the Chelsea players come around. It felt like I had a lot of babies around me."" Despite Ibrahimovic's dismissal, PSG twice came from behind to force a 2-2 extra-time draw that took the French champions into the quarter-finals on away goals after a 3-3 aggregate draw. ""It was an amazing performance because we were playing with one less (player),"" Ibrahimovic added. They played with big hearts. It's not easy to play with 10 guys, especially against a team like Chelsea. We showed quality and big heart.""

Silva's looping header, six minutes from the end of extra time, made the score 2-2 on the night and 3-3 on aggregate, taking PSG through on away goals, 11 months after they had lost to Chelsea by the same rule in the quarter-finals following another 3-3 draw. ""PSG really want to join the big boys and I think we did that tonight (Wednesday). I think the match will be a reference for the club for years to come,"" Blanc said. ""I know things go quickly. We'll try to appreciate this victory, this qualification. Then there'll be the draw for the quarter-finals and the pressure. We won't forget what we've done here. We did something good, but we didn't do something exceptional. We're in the quarter-finals, so we've done something, but you have to keep things in perspective."" PSG's qualification for the quarter-finals represented their first Champions League knockout-phase success against a European heavyweight since Qatar Sports Investment acquired the club in 2011 and president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said it was a breakthrough moment. ""It's magnificent, historic for us,"" he told beIN Sports. ""Thank you to Laurent Blanc, thank you to the players. And thank you to the supporters. We felt like we were at home."" In a spiky, ill-tempered match, an 81st-minute goal by Gary Cahill left Chelsea on the brink of the last eight, only for Luiz to equalise with an emphatic header five minutes later. Silva conceded a penalty for handball that allowed Eden Hazard to restore Chelsea's lead early in extra time, but then atoned with the goal that sent the French champions through. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho accepted Blanc's assertion that the better team had won and the only sour points for the victors were Ibrahimovic's dismissal and a booking for Marco Verratti that will keep him out of the first leg of the quarter-final. Ibrahimovic was shown a straight red card in the 32nd minute by Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers after catching Oscar in a 50-50 challenge and Blanc called on European governing body UEFA to rescind the Swede's dismissal. ""There's a committee that will convene to look at what happened and I hope they're not too strict,"" he said. ""I hope Ibra can be with us in the quarter-finals."" Mourinho, who coached Ibrahimovic at Inter Milan, echoed Blanc's words about the sending-off, but complained -- with some justification -- that Diego Costa should have been awarded a first-half penalty for a foul by Edinson Cavani and that Luiz had perhaps been fortunate to avoid censure for an off-the-ball body-check on Costa. ""It was a clear penalty on Diego Costa and, once more, I think it's a waste of time and money to have the officials on the side of the goal because normally they do nothing,"" he said. ""The David Luiz elbow I didn't see, I confess. But when UEFA give him the man of the match, I have to believe there's no elbow. I can't believe UEFA would give man of the match to someone who made an aggression. Perhaps they cannot give us the penalty to go and take it now, but maybe they can do what is fair and suspend David and take Ibra into the quarter-finals, which maybe he deserves."" Urging his players to switch their attention to the Premier League title race, where they currently enjoy a five-point lead with a game in hand, Mourinho said: ""We lost a competition and, at this moment, we have the Premier League to win and we're in a good situation. ""There's no time to cry."""
997,11/03/2015,23:30,10-man PSG claim Chelsea revenge,Thiago Silva scored a sensational extra-time header as 10-man Paris Saint-Germain knocked Chelsea out of the Champions League after an electrifying 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.,"PSG had talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off in the first half and fell behind to a Gary Cahill goal with nine minutes remaining, only for Chelsea old boy David Luiz to take the tie to extra time with an emphatic 86th-minute header. Silva appeared to have gifted Chelsea a place in the last eight after conceding a penalty for handball that Eden Hazard converted, but the PSG captain scored with six minutes of the game remaining to send Laurent Blanc's side through on away goals after a 3-3 aggregate draw. The irony of the scoreline will not have been lost on PSG, who were eliminated by Chelsea on away goals in last season's quarter-finals after another 3-3 draw, but their breakthrough victory was richly deserved after a mature and resolute display on a tense and fractious night. The French champions' dreams of an unprecedented quadruple remain intact, while Jose Mourinho will have to wait at least another season for an opportunity to win the Champions League with his beloved Chelsea. It was a game almost totally devoid of incident until a moment of controversy in the 32nd minute that thrust referee Bjorn Kuipers beneath the spotlight beams. After a PSG move broke down, Ibrahimovic showed a shade too much eagerness to regain possession by sliding in on Oscar, but although he caught the Brazilian on the ankle, both players were equally committed to the challenge and the red card that followed felt excessive. PSG were, understandably, rattled, with Thiago Motta booked for dissent, and Chelsea threatened to capitalise, with Diego Costa denied a penalty despite clearly being caught on the lower leg by Edinson Cavani. But PSG kept their shape well and shortly before the hour they came within inches of going ahead. A brisk move down the centre of the pitch involving Marco Verratti and Javier Pastore saw the latter release Cavani, who neatly skirted Thibaut Courtois, only to hit the left-hand post from an angle with the goal at his mercy. PSG continued to press, Cahill blocking from Blaise Matuidi and Courtois saving from Pastore, and with the tie on a knife-edge, tempers began to fray. Costa was booked for a dangerous late challenge on Silva and in the aftermath, Luiz received a yellow card for trying to claim he had been headbutted by the Chelsea striker. Moments later Verratti, too, saw yellow, for catching Hazard, ruling him out of the first leg of the quarter-final. After Sirigu had thwarted Ramires at his near post, Chelsea broke the deadlock from a corner when Costa took an air shot and the ball fell kindly for Cahill to slam home. But after PSG substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had seen a header saved by Sirigu, his corner allowed Luiz to take the tie to extra time with a thumping near-post header that cannoned into the net via the crossbar. Silva's recent performances suggested a return to his optimum level, but he was guilty of a rush of blood to the head early in extra time when he challenged Kurt Zouma for a high ball with his arms way above his head. Replays were inconclusive as to whether he actually made contact with the ball, but Hazard made no mistake from the spot. Courtois saved brilliantly from a Luiz free-kick and a Silva header, but the PSG captain had the final say with a goal that settled a breathless and dizzying contest and took the visitors into a new dimension."
998,10/03/2015,21:30,"Verratti can be PSG's Xavi, says Fabregas",Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas paid his Paris Saint-Germain rival Marco Verratti the ultimate compliment on Tuesday by comparing the young Italy international to Barcelona great Xavi.,"The two players go head-to-head at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday when the Champions League last 16 tie between their sides will reach a conclusion following a 1-1 draw in the first leg. The pair recently filmed a television advertisement together and, having closely followed Verratti's development, Fabregas feels the 22-year-old is worthy of comparison with his former Barcelona and Spain team-mate Xavi. ""I think Marco Verratti is an exceptional player, an exceptional talent,"" Fabregas told a press conference at Stamford Bridge. ""I don't want this to be anything big, but he reminds me a little bit of Xavi. He's that type of player. ""He plays in a 4-3-3, comes deep to get the ball, turns fast, is small, has great control of the ball and great ability technically. ""He's one of those players who has a big career. He's still young. He needs to learn, and he's at the right club playing week in, week out, with great players. I'm sure in the next few years he will become a top player."""
999,10/03/2015,21:22,Mourinho accuses PSG of unnecessary aggression,"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho taunted Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday ahead of the teams' Champions League last 16 second leg, accusing them of committing systematic fouls and producing sterile approach play.","PSG largely controlled the first leg in Paris, which ended 1-1, enjoying 54 percent of possession and registering 11 shots on goal to Chelsea's one, but that one attempt yielded an away goal for Branislav Ivanovic that puts the London club in the driving seat ahead of Wednesday's return leg. Chelsea winger Eden Hazard was the victim of nine fouls at the Parc des Princes -- a record for a Champions League match -- and Mourinho said that the French champions' approach had been too aggressive. ""I was surprised in that game because a team with fantastic players was the team with the record of fouls, was the team that was making foul after foul, was the team that stopped Hazard with fouls every time, was the team attacking the player in possession with two or three players with very aggressive actions,"" Mourinho said. ""Even with players like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a typical attacking player, he was coming back and tackling Hazard from behind to stop counter-attacks. ""I thought an English team would never be surprised by aggressivity because of the aggressivity we have in our country. ""During this season we've played teams from the Championship and League One in the cups, a team from League Two, I think, Shrewsbury (in the League Cup), but the most aggressive team was Paris Saint-Germain. ""For me it was a real surprise. With players of such quality, I was expecting more football."" Mourinho also responded sarcastically when it was put to him by a French journalist at the eve-of-match press conference that PSG had dominated the first leg. ""It depends on your concept of football,"" Mourinho replied. ""What is dominate? If it's number of chances, yes, Paris had more chances than us. If dominate is to stop the opposition play, making foul after foul, then yes, they dominated. ""If dominate is to have the ball and move the ball without progression, yes they dominated. They dominated in everything except the result."" PSG coach Laurent Blanc had used his own pre-match media conference to warn his players not to succumb to Chelsea striker Diego Costa's ""games"", but Mourinho refused to take the bait when he was asked for his reaction. ""I don't want to know what he told me (said),"" Mourinho said. ""You can tell me, but I don't answer."" Apart from the injured John Mikel Obi, Chelsea will be at full-strength for the game at Stamford Bridge, with Mourinho revealing that midfield lynchpin Nemanja Matic is fit to start. The Serbia international has missed two games through suspension and also injured his ankle during the celebrations that followed Chelsea's 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup final. ""I told him we won two very important matches without him. So maybe he's not so important,"" Mourinho said with a smile. ""He was laughing. I said, 'Why are you laughing?' But yes, he's very important for us. We did well without him, but we're happy to have him back. ""He's fit to play, but (has had) no football for a couple of weeks and no training because he was really injured. He's going to play tomorrow in his normal position."""
1000,10/03/2015,19:24,Blanc and PSG wary of Costa's 'games',Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc on Tuesday told his players to be wary of underhand tactics from Chelsea striker Diego Costa ahead of Wednesday's Champions League last 16 return leg.,"Having claimed a 1-1 draw in the first leg in Paris, Jose Mourinho's Chelsea hold the upper hand in the tie as they attempt to reach the quarter-finals for the fourth time in five seasons. PSG must score to stand any chance of progressing, but Blanc is also concerned about the bruising Costa, who has attracted as much attention for his goals -- 17 since joining Chelsea from Atletico Madrid last year -- as for his rough-house tactics. ""We know him very well. He's changed country, club and mentality, but I think the English championship suits him well,"" Blanc told a press conference at Stamford Bridge. ""He's a boy who likes contact, who likes a duel, who's a bit provocative. We'll have to hold our nerve and not get involved in his games. ""He needs that to bring out the best in him. I saw him in the League Cup final against Tottenham (which Chelsea won 2-0), and he was looking to do that right from the start. ""So tomorrow night (Wednesday) the centre-backs or players around him will have to make sure they're effective in stopping him. ""He's a physical player, technical too, but he'll try to provoke a reaction and we must not get caught up in his games, particularly as we're away from home."" Blanc also suggested that Chelsea might be tempted to indulge in gamesmanship in order to protect their advantage, but said he had no concerns about Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers's ability to control the game. ""On the refereeing, I'm pretty calm,"" Blanc said. ""The referee is experienced in the Champions League. ""I hope he puts in a good performance and the teams go out there and try to play football. ""Chelsea will try and employ certain tactics to keep things going their way -- we do that as well -- but it's about having experience in these big matches."" PSG were knocked out by Chelsea in last season's quarter-finals after a 3-3 aggregate draw, with Demba Ba's 87th-minute strike in the second leg earning the London club a 2-0 win that took them through on away goals. But whereas Zlatan Ibrahimovic was missing for PSG due to a hamstring injury, he is fit to face Chelsea on Wednesday and Blanc backed the talismanic Swedish striker to make his presence felt. ""The French press might always be asking questions about Zlatan's influence in Champions League knockout games, but I think that whether it's (John) Terry or (Gary) Cahill or (Kurt) Zouma, whoever plays at centre-back for Chelsea, I don't think they'll be happy to play against him,"" Blanc said. ""We know that he can score at any moment, against any team, and in any stadium. And that will be important for us."" Blanc also confirmed that PSG's players will wear black armbands as a mark of respect for the 10 people -- including three prominent French sports personalities -- who died in a helicopter crash in Argentina."
1001,10/03/2015,18:08,PSG players to wear black armbands after tragedy,"Paris Saint-Germain players will wear black armbands in their Champions League last 16, second leg, clash against Chelsea on Wednesday as a mark of respect for three of France's best-known athletes who were killed in a helicopter crash in Argentina.","Champion sailor Florence Arthaud, Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Camille Muffat and Olympic boxer Alexis Vastine were among the 10 victims when two helicopters filming the survival series ""Dropped"" smashed into each other in the rugged mountains of La Rioja province, local officials said. ""The players of Paris Saint-Germain will wear a black armband in respect to the victims of this terrible catastrophe that has hit the world of French sport, in Argentina,"" read a club statement. The accident triggered shock in France, where television footage showed the two helicopters flying extremely close to each other, then their rotors clipping and both aircraft plummeting to the ground. The victims' bodies were burnt beyond recognition in the fiery crash, provincial security secretary Luis Cesar Angulo told AFP. The first leg match finished 1-1 in Paris."
1002,07/03/2015,21:04,Routine win sets PSG up for Chelsea showdown,Paris Saint-Germain warmed up for their decisive Champions League date with Chelsea by recording a routine 4-1 home win against struggling Lens on Saturday that took them provisionally to the top of Ligue 1.,"A David Luiz free-kick just before half-time and a Zlatan Ibrahimovic penalty on the hour mark put Laurent Blanc's side in control at the Parc des Princes, and substitutes Blaise Matuidi and Javier Pastore made sure of the points after Yoann Touzghar had reduced the deficit. The result took the defending champions two points clear at the top, although Lyon can reclaim first place if they win at Montpellier on Sunday evening. Paris remain unbeaten at home this season and have now gone 14 games without losing in all competitions, and those records were never really in danger of ending against such limited opposition. However, Blanc will be aware of the need for an improved display against Chelsea, with the last-16 tie level at 1-1 and PSG needing to score in the second leg at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday to have a chance of progressing to the quarter-finals for the third season running. ""First and foremost we had to make sure we won this game to go top of the table, so it was job done,"" said Blanc. ""But the context of the Chelsea game is different. They are a top-level team so we can't compare this game today with that one."" He added: ""I think we will create fewer chances at Stamford Bridge than today, so we will need to be more clinical, because even although we got four goals here we were not clinical enough."" With the Chelsea game in mind, Blanc rested Thiago Silva and left Marquinhos, Matuidi and Edinson Cavani on the bench against a Lens side nine points adrift of safety and without a win in eight league games in 2015. The home side started well on a beautiful early spring day in Paris and almost took the lead in the 14th minute when Marco Verratti fed Ibrahimovic, but the Swedish striker drilled his shot against the bar and over. Rudy Riou clawed away a David Luiz header before Ibrahimovic squandered a gilt-edged opportunity, seeing his attempted chip go straight into the arms of Riou after being played through on goal by Adrien Rabiot. Lens eventually settled into the contest and looked set to hold out until half-time on level terms until PSG won a free-kick a minute before the interval and David Luiz's low strike from 35 yards swerved into the bottom-right corner of the net. Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a tap-in by a miraculous last-gasp challenge by Ludovic Baal shortly after the restart, but the capital club doubled their lead on the hour mark as Gregory van der Wiel was fouled in the box and Ibrahimovic converted the resulting penalty for his 12th league goal of the season. Touzghar converted a cross from the left to reduce the arrears on 69 minutes, but Blanc sent on Cavani, Matuidi and Pastore for the final stages and the latter two both got their names on the scoresheet towards the end. First Pastore's low ball to the back post was turned in by Matuidi with 10 minutes left, and three minutes after that Pastore thumped home a volley after a delightful one-two with Ibrahimovic. There was still time for Van der Wiel to crash a shot off the bar, but the win was a fine response from PSG to Marseille's superb 6-1 victory at Toulouse on Friday night. Fourth-placed Monaco, France's other Champions League representatives, also won on Saturday, triumphing 3-1 away at Evian to move back to within six points of Marseille in third with a game in hand. Anthony Martial and Almamy Toure scored for the principality side either side of an own-goal by Kassim Abdallah that followed some superb play by Dimitar Berbatov. A Diego Rolan brace, including a 95th-minute penalty, gave Bordeaux a 2-1 win at in-form Caen that put them fifth, while there were also victories for Rennes, Bastia and Reims."
1003,06/03/2015,16:35,Motta back but Silva rested for PSG,Italian international midfielder Thiago Motta is available again after injury for Paris Saint-Germain's Ligue 1 encounter with Lens on Saturday but skipper Thiago Silva will not feature.,"Coach Laurent Blanc revealed on Friday that he would make changes to his side following Wednesday's 2-0 win against Monaco in the quarter-finals of the French Cup. And both the return of Motta and the decision to rest Brazil defender Silva comes with one eye on next midweek's Champions League last-16, second leg against Chelsea in London. ""We bring back Thiago Motta who is over his calf injury. He hasn't played for three weeks, so we will see how he gets on. He is a very important player for our philosophy,"" said Blanc. ""He took a blow to the calf against Lyon (on February 8) which didn't prevent him from playing against Nantes (three days later), and it was against Nantes that he got injured."" Motta therefore missed the 1-1 first-leg draw with Chelsea at the Parc des Princes. Of his decision to rest Silva, Blanc added: ""He has played a lot. He has started the last eight or nine matches and been incredible. But maybe some others will get a rest too."" Blanc also indicated that Zlatan Ibrahimovic will return to the line-up after missing the last two matches due to suspension. ""He is ready. We have had him working while he was out suspended and he has had a good break, which he needed. ""Now he needs to play, and the match against Lens is a good thing for him as it will give him a taste of competition before Chelsea."" PSG can go provisionally top of the Ligue 1 table by beating struggling Lens before Lyon -- who are currently one point clear -- go to Montpellier on Sunday."
1004,06/03/2015,02:20,PSG firing on four fronts as battle at the Bridge looms,"Paris Saint-Germain have the perfect opportunity to go top of Ligue 1 on Saturday, when they host lowly Lens ahead of their Champions League showdown against Chelsea in London next Wednesday.","Laurent Blanc's expensively assembled unit, have flattered to deceive with inconsistent league performances as they bid to defend their French title, but are still in four competitions as the season enters its decisive phase. A domestic treble remains on track after a 2-0 French League Cup win in midweek over Monaco put them into the semi-finals and the team already have the League Cup final to look forward to against Bastia. And in Ligue 1 PSG only trail Lyon in the league by one point with 11 matches to play as PSG continue to pursue their dream of winning the Champions League. Meaning their clash at Stamford Bridge will be the biggest match of their season so far. Blanc has managed to focus his squad in domestic play but admits his players are all thinking about the battle against Jose Mourinho's Premier League leaders. A 1-1 draw at the Parc des Princes, puts the Blues ahead on away goals, but the match is still well balanced. ""Everyone has the Chelsea match on their minds but there is also a complicated match against Lens on Saturday afternoon for which I hope to get back (Yohan) Cabaye and Thiago Motta,"" said Blanc, who added he would rotate the squad ahead of the Chelsea match. PSG defender Lucas Digne also admitted the challenge of winning four competitions is fuelling motivation to the squad. ""At the moment we're the only club in Europe competing on all fronts and it's very important for us to achieve all of our objectives."" Lyon's grip at the top of the pack, has wobbled after a poor showing last weekend when they were deservedly beaten 2-1 by Lille, and they will be tested on the road again this Sunday when they travel to in-form Montpellier. The south-coast club, who won their only French title in 2012 under current Lille coach Rene Girard, have risen to sixth place in the table as the chasing pack that includes Monaco, Saint-Etienne and Bordeaux continue to haunt faltering Marseille in third. Monaco, while they were beaten in Cup action in Paris on Wednesday, are a true threat to Marcelo Bielsa's feuding side and their 3-1 Champions League win at Arsenal ten days ago went down as one of the shocks of the European season. Leonardo Jardim, their Portuguese coach in his first season at the Louis II stadium, has fended off his critics with a string of excellent results since Christmas as they get set to travel to Evian. The team are six points behind Marseille, with a game in hand, while they will go into the return leg against Arsenal, on March 17, as strong favourites to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since 2004 when they lost the final against Mourinho's Porto. Saint-Etienne, a further point back in fifth, scraped through to the French Cup last four with a penalty shootout win at third division Boulogne on Tuesday, but can now focus on Ligue 1 objectives on friendlier territory at home to Lorient on Sunday. Marseille will raise the weekend curtain at relegation-threatened Toulouse on Friday while Bordeaux travel to improving Normandy side Caen as part of a six match slate on Saturday.

1005,04/03/2015,23:00,Cavani seals PSG spot in French Cup semis,A finely taken goal by Edinson Cavani sealed a 2-0 win for Paris Saint Germain over Monaco on Wednesday in their French Cup quarter-final and kept alive their hopes of a domestic treble this season.,"Cavani's second-half effort -- his 18th goal in all competitions this term -- added to David Luiz's scrappy header - leaves PSG still involved in the Cup, they are in the League Cup final and battling to retain their league title. They are also tied at 1-1 with Chelsea heading into their Champions League last 16 second leg clash next week. Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim had rested some of his players or left some on the bench and he said that was partly to blame for their loss. ""We always try to win but today was very tough for us,"" said the Portuguese handler, whose side lost on penalties to Bastia in the League Cup semi-finals. ""We didn't have a specialist central defender and that makes life complicated. ""PSG therefore were logical winners."" PSG were without several first choice players including hardman Italian international midfielder Thiago Motta and the stylish French international Yohan Cabaye while talismanic striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was serving the second match of his two game suspension. Jardim opted to leave some on the bench players such as Joao Moutinho and Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco while as is the norm with French Cup games Dutch international Maarten Stekelenburg started in goal instead of Danijel Subasic. PSG took an early lead as the mop haired Luiz managed to head home at the second opportunity after his weak downward header had bounced into the ground, but he reacted quickest to head it past Stekelenburg. Cavani went close to doubling the lead soon afterwards but his shot had some of the power taken off it by a Monaco defender and Stekelenburg gathered the ball safely. Monaco had seen little of the ball in the early stages but Alain Traore was denied only by the stanchion of the bar and the post with a curling freekick. However, Cavani put the game beyond their reach seven minutes into the second-half as he ran onto a nicely sleighted pass from Marco Verratti and unleashed a shot which went in off the post. PSG should have been 3-0 up minutes later in an incredible passage of play and one that Javier Pastore will prefer to erase from his memory. Twice he hit the post and then when presented with a far easier opportunity and the net beckoning he fired wildly over the bar, earning a look of disbelief from Cavani. The hosts were swarming all over their hard-pressed opponents and it was Pastore's Argentinian international team-mate Ezequiel Lavezzi who was hanging his head soon afterwards as he nipped in ahead of his marker but his effort went the wrong side of the post. PSG joined fellow Ligue 1 outfit St Etienne -- who have not won the trophy since 1977 -- who had to come from behind to force a 1-1 drew before eventually prevailing 4-3 on penalties over third tier Boulogne on Tuesday. The semi-finals line-up will be completed on Thursday when the last two matches take place including holders Guingamp playing fourth division Concarneau with the Ligue 1 side in a bit of a slump having lost three times last week."
1006,03/03/2015,02:30,'Tired' Monaco seek PSG upset in French Cup,Paris Saint-Germain are gunning for an unprecedented domestic treble as they host Monaco on Wednesday in the French Cup quarter-finals.,"PSG are currently second in Ligue 1, one point behind leaders Lyon after being held to a frustrating 0-0 Sunday draw by Monaco, a team they meet for the second time in four days. But PSG know the way to the Stade de France as they already booked their ticket for the French League Cup final next month against Bastia. PSG face a tough challenge on Wednesday as they take on one of the few top flight sides remaining. And Monaco love nothing more than to live up to their giant-killer reputation, as Arsenal learnt the hard way last week in Champions League action. The French Cup has been identified as a priority by Paris president Nasser al-Khelaifi as the Ligue 1 giants have yet to lift the trophy in the Qatar-fuelled era. PSG, however, seem to be in a tight spot with the return leg of their Champions' League clash against Chelsea looming on March 11 while the Ligue 1 leaves Laurent Blanc's men with little room for error. Injuries to Thiago Motta (calf), Yohan Cabaye (thigh), Serge Aurier (thigh) and Lucas (adductor), on top of Zlatan Ibrahimovic's two-game suspension, make things even harder for the capital club. In this context, Monaco could appear as firm favourites. But coach Leonardo Jardim played it down. ""We will try to have a good game. We are more tired than PSG and our squad isn't as big. We have 18-19 players and two keepers. In the back, we have two players injured and two others who are suspended. We will have to find a solution but we're working on it,"" the Portuguese explained. ""Wednesday's game will be different. We will have fans backing us up and we'll have to recover,"" PSG's Blaide Matuidi responded in accord. ""The fresher team can certainly come out on top."" In an early match on Tuesday, six-time winners Saint-Etienne head to Boulogne-sur-Mer, who ply their trade in their third-tier. The Ligue 1 side are seeking to revive former glories to end a title drought in the tournament stretching all the way back to 1977. And, as coach Christophe Galtier vowed, Les Verts, will take the encounter seriously. ""The Cup is important, it's been too long since Saint-Etienne reached a semi-final. It's part of the club's DNA"", he explained. The tie will be significant too for Boulogne 'keeper Jody Viviani. Now 33, Viviani spent four years with Saint-Etienne as their backup shot-stopper, appearing 40 times for the club. ""It's always nice to face Saint-Etienne. I know quite a few guys over there, including Loic Perrin and Moustapha Bayal Sall whom I played with,"" he recalled before denying rosy memories would cloud his judgement. ""We certainly must not stop to watch Saint-Etienne play. We'll have to make all the efforts to stay united and play together to match our opponent,"" Viviani added. ""We are, after all, just two games away from the Stade de France."" In other games, title holders Guingamp, who slumped to a third defeat in a week after their 1-0 loss against Nantes, travel to neutral site Lorient where they play fourth-tier Concarneau, while Brest take on Auxerre in a Ligue 2 classic.

1007,21/02/2015,19:09,PSG beat Toulouse to go top in Ligue 1,Paris Saint-Germain went top of the Ligue 1 table for the first time this season on Saturday as teenage midfielder Adrien Rabiot scored twice in a 3-1 win against Toulouse.,"Rabiot struck in each half at the Parc des Princes and Thiago Silva added the third goal after Wissam Ben Yedder had pulled one back for the visitors. The result allowed Laurent Blanc's side to climb from third place above both Marseille and Lyon into top spot as they extended their unbeaten run to six league games and 11 matches in all competitions. PSG are a point clear of Lyon, although OL need just a draw at home to Nantes on Sunday to go top of the table again, while Marseille can move level on points with the capital club if they win at Saint-Etienne on Sunday. Paris had been boosted by their display in drawing 1-1 with Chelsea in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday, although Blanc's side were missing a host of regulars due to injury and suspension against Toulouse. The injured Lucas, Thiago Motta, Yohan Cabaye and Serge Aurier were joined on the sidelines by the banned Marco Verratti and David Luiz. However, Javier Pastore made his first start since the end of January after injury and Rabiot also came into the line-up. And it was the 19-year-old, who had a spell on loan at Toulouse two years ago, who brought the game to life after a quiet start with the opening goal in the 27th minute. Pastore's low ball from the right was laid off by Zlatan Ibrahimovic for Rabiot, who dispatched a beautifully controlled first-time shot from the edge of the box into the left corner of the net. Silva headed wide when unmarked as Paris missed a great chance to extend their lead soon after, before Salvatore Sirigu was called into action at the other end to keep out an Abel Aguilar header from Etienne Didot's cross. The hosts extended their lead just three minutes after the restart as Rabiot stabbed in from close range after superb work by Pastore on the right flank. On a bitterly cold afternoon in Paris, Toulouse reduced the deficit soon after when Ben Yedder converted after Aleksandar Pesic had headed on a free-kick. It was an eighth league goal of the season, but first since early November, for Ben Yedder, who had come off the bench for the injured Didot late in the first half. However, unlike last weekend -- when PSG threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at home to Caen -- the defending champions held on to their advantage and wrapped up the points on 74 minutes when Silva headed in a Jean-Christophe Bahebeck free-kick. Elswhere on Saturday, the game between Evian and Lorient was called off because of snow in Annecy, in the shadow of the Alps. Monaco warmed up for their Champions League trip to Arsenal in midweek by winning 1-0 at Nice in the Cote d'Azur derby on Friday night. The principality side had Aymen Abdennour sent off in the first half but snatched all three points thanks to a late Bernardo Silva strike to move up to fourth in the table."

""There is nothing new to say. I only speak of concrete facts and I will not confirm or rebut this."" The former Chile and Athletic Bilbao manager admitted his contract with Marseille would end in June but his future in France is still uncertain.

But that came after the star-studded side gave up a 2-0 lead against Caen last weekend. Blanc's team have drawn their last two Ligue 1 games as they stutter through the championship. With leaders Lyon just two points ahead of Paris and Marseille, the capital team host relegation strugglers Toulouse on Saturday, and can overtake their rivals before they play on Sunday. France is blessed to have Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and PSG's other 'extraordinary' players, according to Toulouse coach Alain Casanova. ""Ligue 1 is very lucky to have players like Zlatan and Thiago Silva, without being nasty we could have become like Belgium if PSG hadn't started signing stars,"" the Toulouse coach said this week. Gerard Houlier has coached both Lyon and Paris Saint Germain to league titles and this week he tipped Paris to win the league. Lyon have 51 points with Marseille and Paris breathing down their necks on 49. ""Paris is probably more comprehensive because they really have some key players in key areas,"" Houlier told the Ligue 1 website. ""Lyon is a young team lacking a bit of experience. But they play very well together and their game is fluent and very entertaining,"" added the Frenchman, who suggested early pace-setters Marseille are running out of steam. Without a win in five games Nantes travel to Lyon, unbeaten in 10 games and who welcome back 21 goal star Alexandre Lacazette after almost a month on the sidelines. Lacazette is one of 16 former Lyon youth team players in the senior squad, and one of 12 who were born in the Lyon area. ""Statistics prove that a player has better chances of success when he's close to home,"" head of their youth centre Stephane Roche said this week. Marseille have won two, drawn two and lost two since the New Year, but Saint Etienne have lost three of their last four ahead of what should be a boisterous evening at the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium between two of France's best supported clubs. It's worst supported club is Monaco, with an average of just 7,835, but they travel up the coast to Nice for a Cote d'Azur derby on Friday. After 14 matches unbeaten Monaco drew at Lyon and then lost at Guingamp in their last two league outings, but have only conceded twice in 10 matches in 2015. Goals seem to be the problem after the close season departure of Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez. And their coach Leonardo Jardim is now banking on veteran Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov. ""We need him on top form. He's our number one striker and nothing has changed there,"" explained Jardim, but Berbatov has only six league goals this season. Nice have won three and drawn three of their last six league games and are coached by former Monaco handler Claude Puel. Another factor in Nice's favour would be Monaco's trip to London next Wednesday for a Champions League tie with Arsenal."
1011,17/02/2015,22:46,Courtois saves help Chelsea hold PSG,A first-half away goal by Branislav Ivanovic and some fine goalkeeping by Thibaut Courtois put Chelsea in command of their Champions League last-16 tie with Paris Saint-Germain as Tuesday's first leg ended 1-1.,"Ivanovic headed in on 36 minutes after Gary Cahill had helped the ball into his path to give Chelsea the lead from their first and only real chance of the evening at the Parc des Princes. Edinson Cavani replied with a header of his own in the 54th minute and PSG enjoyed the bulk of the chances but Courtois intervened time and again to keep the Premier League leaders on level terms. ""We were winning 1-0 and we could have held on, but we know we are stronger at Stamford Bridge and we will try to qualify there,"" Chelsea's Eden Hazard told France's Canal Plus television after the game. ""We need to play better and create more chances because we didn't have many."" Jose Mourinho's side should certainly fancy their chances of progressing to the quarter-finals when the second leg comes around in London on March 11, with Paris needing to score in that game to keep the tie alive. That was something Laurent Blanc's side failed to do when the teams met in the last eight a year ago, allowing Chelsea to go through on away goals despite losing the first leg 3-1 in France. Seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, Chelsea are a stronger side than they were then, while PSG had been forced to deal with something of an injury crisis in the build-up to this game. With Lucas, Thiago Motta and Yohan Cabaye among the players on the sidelines, Blanc opted to start David Luiz in midfield against his former club while Marquinhos lined up in central defence despite being a doubt ahead of the game. Chelsea were at full strength but their chief creator, Cesc Fabregas, struggled to make an impact in the match up against the combative Luiz. In a cagey opening, it was the hosts who created what chances there were, with Blaise Matuidi the first to test Courtois on 11 minutes with a header from a Cavani cross. The Belgian goalkeeper was equal to that effort and was called into action again seconds later to keep out a Zlatan Ibrahimovic header from a Matuidi centre. Ibrahimovic and his fellow forwards were afforded little space in the final third and they had to wait until after the half-hour mark to trouble Courtois again, Cavani seeing his near-post header from Ezequiel Lavezzi's corner turned behind. Chelsea were happy to soak up the pressure and hit Paris with a sucker punch nine minutes before the interval thanks to a rare attacking combination between three of their back four, Ivanovic stealing in behind Luiz to head home after Cahill had flicked on a John Terry cross. However, those defenders hardly covered themselves in glory as PSG drew level nine minutes after the restart, leaving Cavani completely unmarked to head home his 17th goal of the season -- his sixth in the Champions League -- from a Matuidi left-wing cross. With their backs to the wall, Paris came out fighting in the second half and Chelsea were again grateful to the outstanding Courtois as he saved from Ibrahimovic before Lavezzi's follow-up was blocked. Courtois, again preferred to Petr Cech between the posts by Mourinho, then got his fingertips to a Luiz header from a Lavezzi free-kick. PSG's unbeaten record at home this season did not appear under threat in the closing stages, but they could not get the winning goal on the night. Cavani put a glorious chance wide of the far post 10 minutes from time and, when Ibrahimovic got a header on target in stoppage time, that man Courtois was on hand yet again to save Chelsea."
1012,17/02/2015,20:01,Luiz starts in midfield against old club Chelsea,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc took a gamble on Tuesday by selecting David Luiz in midfield for the Champions League last 16, first leg against Chelsea at the Parc des Princes.","The Brazilian, who scored an own-goal as a Chelsea player in a 3-1 win for PSG when the clubs met in the French capital in the first leg of the quarter-finals last season, steps forward from his usual position in central defence. He will play in the holding role with both Thiago Motta and Yohan Cabaye missing due to injury, with Blanc gambling on the fitness of Marquinhos. The young defender partners Thiago Silva at the back just three days after coming off injured against Caen in a 2-2 draw in Ligue 1. There are fewer surprises in the Chelsea line-up with Blues manager Jose Mourinho having a near full-strength squad at his disposal, barring the injured John Obi Mikel. Gary Cahill is preferred to Frenchman Kurt Zouma in central defence alongside captain John Terry while Thibaut Courtois, as expected, gets the nod in goal ahead of Petr Cech.

1013,16/02/2015,15:10,Blanc unhappy at Ibrahimovic for publicity stunt,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc said Monday that star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was wrong to take his shirt off to celebrate a goal as part of a United Nations anti-hunger campaign.,"After scoring PSG's opening goal in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Caen in Ligue 1, the Swede took off his shirt to reveal his tattooed torso. Ibrahimovic picked up a booking for the celebration, although he explained on Sunday that the removable tattoos were the names of people around the world suffering from hunger. The campaign is being organised by the UN's World Food Programme. Blanc said: ""I knew he was involved with them but I personally wasn't aware of the tattoos. I knew there was something planned for after the match but that's all. ""He scored very early on and took off his shirt. If it was to show off his tattoos we certainly saw them and it was a successful initiative. But it cost us a yellow card. ""Imagine if the match had heated up and he got a second yellow. The intention was good, but I don't know if it was a good thing to take off his shirt. ""I hope he doesn't do it again tomorrow,"" added Blanc on the eve of PSG's Champions League last 16, first leg against Chelsea at the Parc des Princes."
1014,16/02/2015,14:48,Trio definitely out for PSG against Chelsea,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc confirmed on Monday that Lucas, Yohan Cabaye and Serge Aurier will all miss Tuesday's Champions League last 16, first leg against Chelsea at the Parc des Princes.","""It is official. It is impossible for them to be on the field,"" said Blanc of the trio, who all came off injured in Saturday's 2-2 draw against Caen in Ligue 1. Brazilian defender Marquinhos also came off in that game and reports have indicated that he will be absent too, although Blanc said he will only make a decision on his fitness after training on Monday afternoon. ""For the others, we will have to see if they are available. There is a training session at 16h (1500 GMT). After that we will know who can take part. ""It is not the best preparation for such an important match."" Thiago Motta, Blaise Matuidi and Javier Pastore are also struggling with their fitness to varying degrees ahead of the game."
1015,14/02/2015,18:23,PSG in injury crisis ahead of Chelsea clash,French champions Paris Saint-Germain were hit by an injury crisis on Saturday as they not only saw four players break down but also threw away a 2-0 lead over Caen in a dramatic 2-2 draw.,"It was the worst possible preparation for the French Ligue 1 champions who await Premier League leaders Chelsea at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 matchup. Following midfielder Yohan Cabaye, who limped off in the 16th minute, coach Laurent Blanc looked on in horror as Brazilian defender Marquinhos, Ivory Coast international Serge Aurier and Brazilian playmaker Lucas all suffered injuries and had to leave the match. The late injuries, to newly crowned African champion Aurier and Lucas, meant PSG finished the match with nine men after Blanc had used all of his three substitutes. ""I'm no doctor but, concerning Cabaye and Lucas, it's a muscle injury. For Marquinhos, it's the hamstring. For Aurier, the quadriceps,"" explained Laurent Blanc. ""They all are muscle injuries. I need to see the seriousness of it all but, for Tuesday's game, it's going to be very, very difficult to have them back."" Blaise Matuidi was also taken off on the hour mark with the midfielder having received a knock on the back of the knee. ""It's more a knock so it's not as worrying. I substituted Blaise to be safe,"" added Blanc. The freak scenario in front of a stunned home crowd at the Parc des Princes went from bad to worse when Caen miraculously salvaged a point with two late goals. Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ezequiel Lavezzi gave PSG what appeared to be a winning advantage after first half goals but Caen, who began the day four points above the relegation zone, were given a lifeline on 89 minutes when Emiliano Sala scrambled home from inside the box. Then deep into injury time, following a foul by Ibrahimovic, Herve Blazile curled a left-foot free kick into the top corner leaving PSG and their watching faithful in shock. ""If someone had told me this is how it would end after 20 minutes played, I wouldn't have believed him. Then it started with Cabaye and bad news just kept coming in: another one at half-time, then two others in the second half,"" the PSG coach told the press. ""But the worst news is losing two points we were holding in our hands. We couldn't keep a hold on those two points. I had never witnessed such a scenario. It was just abnormal, even for those who have a lot of experience."" Jose Mourinho and his Chelsea side are enjoying a weekend off, after being knocked out of the FA Cup in the previous round, but will have looked on with great interest at what was happening on a rainy Saturday in Paris. The teams also met last season when PSG won 3-1 at the Parc des Princes in the first match only to be eliminated when Demba Ba gave Chelsea a late 2-0 victory in the second leg, sending the Londoners through on away goals. The point against Caen keeps the capital club level with Marseille, who drew 2-2 on Friday at home to Reims, while leaders Lyon can extend their one point advantage at the top when they travel to Lorient as one of three Sunday fixtures. In other matches on Saturday, Toulouse picked up three crucial points as they edged Rennes 2-1 while League Cup finalists Bastia continued their fine run with a 2-0 victory on the road at Nantes. Lille and Nice finished 0-0 in the north while Lens remain second from bottom after a woeful 2-0 home defeat against third from bottom Evian. Monaco's scheduled fixture at home to Montpellier was postponed due to heavy rain. Apart from Lyon's tie at Lorient on Sunday, sixth-placed Bordeaux meet fourth-placed Saint-Etienne in a fixture crucial to European places for next season."
1016,13/02/2015,02:19,PSG seek home lift as Chelsea loom,Casting a long shadow over Paris Saint-Germain's Ligue 1 date with modest Caen this weekend is the imminent visit to the Parc des Princes of cross-channel giants Chelsea.,"PSG square up to Jose Mourinho's runaway Premier League leaders in the Champions League last 16 first leg on Tuesday with Laurent Blanc's side itching for revenge. Last season Chelsea blocked PSG's passage to the Champions League semi-finals on away goals. ""Last year was an apprenticeship which must not be repeated,"" PSG's Qatari president Nasser Al-Khelaifi assured AFP at the draw in December. At Thursday's press conference, it was Chelsea inevitably rather than Caen preoccupying Blanc's mind. The PSG boss made fun of how his Chelsea counterpart was regarded as, in his words, ""a genius"" despite their FA Cup knock-out at the hands of minnows Bradford. That Cup upset has given Chelsea crucial more time to prepare for Tuesday's trip to Paris with this weekend's programme in England devoted solely to the FA Cup fifth round. ""As Mourinho is a genius, Chelsea lost their Cup tie 4-2 and everyone thinks that's fantastic. ""But if the same thing had happened to PSG (in the Cup), it would have triggered a tsunami, or at the very least some turbulence. ""People would have said that the manager didn't know a thing."" PSG, who are in the League Cup final and reached the French Cup quarter-finals in midweek, squandered the chance to top the table last weekend when Zlatan Ibrahimovic's controversial retaken penalty salvaged a 1-1 draw at Lyon. That left Ligue 1's defending title-holders in third, level on points with second-placed Marseille and two shy of Lyon. With Marseille in action on Friday against Reims, and Lyon away to struggling Lorient on Sunday, PSG will be anxious to bag the three points in Saturday's early game to keep the wheels on their title bid and put them in the perfect frame of mind for Tuesday's massive European tie. Encouragingly for Blanc, Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani scored his first goal in five games in the 2-0 Cup win over Nantes on Wednesday. A win over Reims at the Velodrome on Friday will lift Marseille into the lead, at least until PSG and Lyon turn out over the weekend. Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa is without suspended Mario Lemina, Nicolas Nkoulou, who picked up a knee injury appearing for Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations, and midfielder Abdelaziz Barrada. There is also uncertainty over Andre Ayew, who is taking time to come to terms with Ghana's defeat on penalties in last Sunday's African Nations Cup final against the Ivory Coast. Down at the other end of Ligue 1 a tense encounter is on the cards between two relegation-threatened teams, Lens and Evian. Bottom club Metz host mid-table Guingamp.

1017,09/02/2015,23:00,Ibrahimovic proud as punch to be cast in wax,Swedish football great Zlatan Ibrahimovic professed himself to be extremely proud to have his waxwork model unveiled at the Grevin Museum in central Paris on Monday.,"The 33-year-old striker -- who was honoured for his goalscoring exploits for champions Paris Saint Germain since he joined in 2012 -- is portrayed in a PSG shirt with his arms raised to the sky. ""It is really incredible to be here,"" beamed Ibrahimovic. ""It is a huge honour. Don't forget to take plenty of photos of me!"" added the charismatic Swede, who nevertheless appeared for once to be a little intimidated by the occasion and was far from the cheeky chappie he often is on and off the pitch. The waxwork model of Ibrahimovic, who has played over 100 times for his national side, has been placed close to the player widely believed to be the greatest ever footballer Brazilian maestro Pele, France's multiple rally world champion Sebastien Loeb and another French sporting great Judoka Teddy Riner. Among the dignitaries present to celebrate the occasion with the former AC Milan, Inter Milan, Juventus and Barcelona marksman was the Swedish Ambassador to France as well as PSG's Qatari president Nasser Al-Khelaifi. Ibrahimovic -- whose statue took six months to complete -- was a unanimous choice by the Grevin Academy presided over by the journalist Stephane Bern, who saluted him for being a 'football icon'. ""We love your cheeky side which contributes to your legend,"" gushed Bern. Ibrahimovic did not go away empty-handed, though, instead of a match ball he is used to keeping after several hat-tricks he took with him a replica of a sculpture of his head created by Eric Saint Chaffray."
1018,08/02/2015,23:41,Ibrahimovic rescues controversial point for PSG,Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a controversial penalty as Paris Saint-Germain snatched a 1-1 draw at Ligue 1 leaders Lyon on Sunday.,"Champions PSG could have gone top with victory but needed a highly contentious retaken penalty just to earn a share of the spoils at the Stade Gerland. They remain third, two points behind their night's hosts, and level with second-placed Marseille, who drew 1-1 at Rennes on Saturday. Swedish giant Ibrahimovic saw his first penalty attempt saved by goalkeeper Anthony Lopes, but he had another chance seconds later when the referee decided Lyon players had encroached on the penalty area too early. This time he made no mistake, equalising in the 69th minute. With Ligue 1 top scorer Alexandre Lacazette out injured, the young Lyon side held its own thanks to a fine performance from Lopes. They even took a surprise early lead through Cameroon youngster Clinton N'Jie on 31 minutes, his second goal of the season, following a clever one-two with Nabil Fekir. Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani and David Luiz all failed to convert chances, leaving coach Laurent Blanc frustrated. Blanc will be left scratching his head trying to find an answer as to how his side managed to fail to win a match in which they dominated possession and created the lion's share of chances. Lyon could even have extended their lead late on but Fekir and Arnold Mvuemba missed good chances. And the leaders will feel hard done by after that re-taken penalty, despite maintaining their advantage at the top of the table. Earlier, Monaco's recent charge up the standings came to a shuddering halt when they conceded a first goal in over 800 minutes to fall 1-0 at ten-man Guingamp. The result leaves Monaco fifth on 40 points while Saint Etienne, who drew 3-3 with Lens on Friday, have 41 in fourth, but only the top three in France qualify for the Champions League. In Brittany on Saturday, Swedish striker Ola Toivonen gave Rennes the lead after 26 minutes, smartly chesting down a loose ball to score past Steve Mandanda in the Marseille goal. Marseille were saved when Lucas Ocampos, the Argentine signed on loan from Monaco in the last moments of the transfer window, found the net in the 59th minute after coming on as a half-time substitute."
1019,07/02/2015,16:13,Blanc warns Verratti over 'stupid' behaviour,"Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti must improve his persistently poor behaviour, coach Laurent Blanc warned on Saturday.","The Italian was criticised on Tuesday by his manager after yet another spat in PSG's 1-0 League Cup win at Lille. ""He's a danger to himself,"" said Blanc. ""It's no laughing matter for me. I'm sorry for him but enough is enough."" ""We've been telling him the same thing over and over for the past two years"", explained Blanc after the Lille game where Verratti was substituted just after the hour mark. ""If he's not smart enough to understand that, he's heading for even bigger trouble."" ""Frankly, I've known coaches who have been more virulent than me"", said Blanc as he tried to drive the point home. ""What did I say exactly? That he took too many cards and that he would have trouble if he kept it on."" ""I want him to realise he needs to adjust his behaviour. He knows it. The problem is that he's known it for over two years. ""He's a great player, he's having a very good season. But when he makes stupid mistakes, I have to tell him."" ""I am thinking about the team. With only ten men, you don't win many games. We know Marco isn't a mean player. We know how he gets all of his cards,"" said the 1998 world champion, refering to Verratti's constant protests against referees. Verratti, 22, has picked up seven yellow cards in 20 Ligue 1 games already this season. Last year, he was booked ten times in 29 games. ""He need to correct that bad habit. It won't be easy. People say 'but he's young'. But that's exactly when he needs to learn."""
1020,06/02/2015,02:15,PSG face tough test at Lyon,"Champions Paris Saint-Germain can reclaim the top spot in Ligue 1 on Sunday, but they need to beat current leaders Lyon away from home to do so.","It's a tough assignment for Laurent Blanc's men, but they were boosted by a 1-0 win over Lille in midweek that took them into the French League Cup final. With the Cup behind them and the Champions League clash against Chelsea coming up, the Ligue 1 giants need to focus on improving their league ranking. ""It's not a final but it could be the turning point of the season"", admitted Blaise Matuidi. ""We've got a lot of avenues open to us and we want to do well in all the different competitions."" With 15 games to go, PSG have little margin for error. The defending champions have yet to hit their stride during a mediocre campaign but maximum points at Gerland would take PSG ahead of their rivals in the table. The Ligue 1 title race has effectively become a three-way tussle between current leaders Lyon on 49 points with Marseille and PSG hot on their heels on 47. And PSG have no choice in Lyon, as Thiago Motta explained. ""If we lose on Sunday in Lyon, people will talk about a crisis at PSG. Our aim is to win and reclaim the top spot"", said the Italian midfielder. The pressure is thus on Laurent Blanc and his men. Bernard Lacombe, special advisor to Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas, knows that and cunningly added to their burden. ""PSG will be champions. At one point, the Parisian players are going to rebel. Let's hope it'll be as late as possible"", Lacombe told Radio Scoop. Lyon, who are surprise leaders at this point in the season, are on eight-match unbeaten run, having only dropped points at Monaco. But, just as they did in the Principality, Lyon will have to do without their number one striker Alexandre Lacazette (21 league goals). Second place Marseille could also take the reins, should they manage to win their first away game since October at Brittany outfit Rennes, who are winless in five Ligue 1 outings. Marcelo Bielsa squad was boosted with the arrival of Lucas Ocampos from Monaco this week while their target man Pierre Andre Gignac is on clinical form in front of goal with a league tally of 14. At the bottom of the table, Metz face a tough battle against Bastia whose confidence has been given a massive boost with their reaching the League Cup final. Losing League Cup semi-finalists Monaco face Guingamp and will rely on their defence, which has let in just one goal in their last 14 games, to overhaul Saint-Etienne in fourth spot while Les Verts take on Lens on Friday. Lens, who are just goal difference away from the bottom spot, need points quickly and they know it. ""We hope to get the better of Saint-Etienne"", said Lens manager Antoine Kombouare. ""The way we have played lately shows what we are capable of and it boosts our confidence. We are aware of the difficulties that are ahead of us. Lille came third in Ligue 1 last season but a goals drought has seen them fall to a lowly 13th place with fans calling for the coach René Girard to resign, and hanging up a banner to that effect at the club's training facility. They travel to sixth placed Montpellier Saturday seeking not only in need of goals and points but a boost in morale. Fixtures (all times are 1900GMT unless stated)"
1021,03/02/2015,23:26,PSG defeat Lille to reach League Cup final,French League Cup holders Paris Saint-Germain moved to within one win of retaining the trophy as a first-half goal from defender Maxwell gave them a 1-0 semi-final victory at Lille on Tuesday.,"The French champions dominated affairs with the bulk of possession and mustered the only goal of the match on 27 minutes when Brazilian full back Maxwell blasted a fierce shot into the corner leaving Lille's Nigerian 'keeper Vincent Enyeama no chance. Laurent Blanc's side will play either Monaco or Bastia, who meet at the Louis II stadium on Wednesday, in the April 11 final at the Stade de France. The victory keeps PSG on track for a quartet of trophies with a Champions League last-16 tie against Chelsea on February 17 and a last-16 French Cup fixture against Nantes lying ahead. The capital club also have the chance to go top of Ligue 1 on Sunday when they attempt to overturn a two point deficit on Lyon when the teams meet at the Stade Gerland. Rene Girard's Lille side were out of their depth against the star-studded PSG line-up who put a first choice team out including Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani, Thiago Silva and David Luiz. The hosts hardly conjured up a second half opportunity as reserve 'keeper Nicolas Douchez, standing in for Salvatore Sirigu, enjoyed a relaxed evening in the away goal. Lucas and Cavani played a role in the winner with the Uruguayan marksman sliding the ball across to Maxwell who made no mistake from the edge of the penalty box."
1022,30/01/2015,22:29,PSG edge Rennes to close gap on Lyon,Ezequiel Lavezzi scored the only goal as champions Paris Saint-Germain edged Rennes 1-0 on Friday to maintain their undefeated Ligue 1 home record and cut the gap on leaders Lyon to just one point.,"The win was PSG's sixth consecutive home win in all competitions while stretching their Ligue 1 record at the Parc des Princes to eight wins and three draws. However, Lyon, who face PSG in 10 days' time, can restore their four-point lead with victory at Monaco on Sunday. Lavezzi grabbed the decisive goal after 29 minutes after a neat interchange of passes down the left between Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was involved twice, Adrien Rabiot and Javier Pastore. Argentine star Lavezzi, who has been linked with a move to Liverpool before the transfer window shuts on Monday, was then on hand to tuck the ball past Benoit Costil in the Rennes goal for his third goal of the season. Rennes may have gone into Friday's game having not won a game in Ligue 1 since December 3 but they had defeated PSG 2-1 on their last visit to the capital in May. They showed they would not be intimidated by the champions and came close to an equaliser moments later. Pastore played a poorly-weighted back pass which was intercepted by Abdoulaye Doucoure. The midfielder was clean through but his tame shot was well saved by an alert Salvatore Sirigu in the PSG goal. Five minutes after the interval, it was the turn of Costil to keep his team in the hunt. Brazilian defender Marquinhos found Edinson Cavani with a neat pass which dissected the Rennes backline but the Uruguayan striker was denied his 17th Ligue 1 goal of the season by a fine diving save from Costil. Cavani missed another close-range opportunity before he was hauled off by manager Laurent Blanc. At the other end, Sirigu kept PSG's advantage intact with a save from Christian Bruls after Lavezzi had given the ball away."
1023,30/01/2015,12:55,Football: Bordeaux sign PSG midfielder Chantome,"Bordeaux confirmed on Friday the signing of Clement Chantome from Ligue 1 rivals Paris Saint-Germain, for an undisclosed fee, with sources saying the deal is set to run for three-and-a-half years.","The 27-year-old, who has picked up one cap for France, has only appeared in six matches for Laurent Blanc's PSG side this season, all as a substitute. He becomes Bordeaux's second signing during the winter break, following the arrival of Swedish international striker Issac Kiese Thelin from Malmo, and could make his debut at home to Guingamp on Sunday. Chantome joined PSG as a teenager in 2000 and came up through the ranks to make 162 first team appearances, scoring five goals. He spent last season on loan at Toulouse scoring twice in 23 appearances. Bordeaux confirmed a six-month loan deal with Caen on Thursday when they off-loaded Argentine striker Emiliano Sala to the Normandy club."
1024,29/01/2015,11:49,"Pogba agent hints at PSG, Real move","Paris Saint Germain and Real Madrid could lead the race to buy Juventus star Paul Pogba although the French midfielder may remain in Italy for another season, his agent Mino Raiola said Thursday.","A string of stunning performances for the Italian champions has seen the combative midfielder's value rocket, with a number of top European clubs said to be lining up to secure Pogba's signature at the end of the season. Raiola, the Dutch 'super agent' who also represents Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Mario Balotelli among others, compared Pogba to a painting by Dutch master Vincent Van Gogh. ""Who knows how much he is worth? It depends how much money you have to spend, and who is buying,"" Raiola said in an interview with La Gazetta dello Sport on Thursday. He hinted the 21-year-old could make the ""natural"" choice of a move to Paris Saint Germain, or decide to leave Juve ""only for a top club"". Either way, Raiola believes Juventus could purchase the backbone of a new team capable of challenging for Champions League honours with the money they receive for the Frenchman. ""If they don't sell Pogba they won't have the money they need to challenge for honours in the Champions League,"" added Raiola. ""How long can I keep Paul in Italy? Everyone has a card up their sleeve, it just depends when they want to play it. ""PSG is the most natural choice. If he wants to go there, who can say no? But I don't know if that is an option right now. Paul could stay for another year at Juve. ""Plus, if he leaves, he will leave only for a top club. So, if it's not this year, it could be next. In the meantime, his value is on a par with all the other 'big' players on the market, so he can stay another year."" Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri recently admitted Pogba could leave the club before the end of his contract, which expires in June 2019. ""We have to live in the present. We don't know what will happen in June,"" said Allegri. ""A lot of clubs are looking at him, but that's normal. He's young, strong and has yet to reach his full potential as a player."" Champions League winners Real Madrid recently distanced themselves from the French international, with Madrid legend Zinedine Zidane telling Marca: ""He's a very good player, but there's a lot of very good players out there. ""I can't tell you if he's right for Real Madrid because it's not up to me."" But Raiola added: ""Today they say they're not interested, but tomorrow they would run to sign him. ""He is the only big player available on the market this summer. If you can't buy (Cristiano) Ronaldo, Ibra or (Lionel) Messi, the only one you can buy is him (Pogba)."""
1025,25/01/2015,23:33,Lyon pull clear as Ibrahimovic lifts PSG,"Lyon reeled off their seventh consecutive Ligue 1 win on Sunday, a 2-0 defeat of 10-man Metz pushing them four points clear, as Paris Saint-Germain moved level with second-placed Marseille.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the only goal in a 1-0 win at St Etienne that allowed champions PSG to move level on points with out-of-sorts Marseille who lost 2-1 at Nice on Friday. PSG and Marseille have 44 points after 22 games, four behind Lyon, who the Parisians will play at the Gerland Stadium in two weeks' time. A 31st minute penalty from Alexandre Lacazette and a late second from Corentin Tolisso proved the undoing of Metz who drop to bottom of the table. The only downside for Lyon came when Lacazette, the league's top scorer with 21 goals, had to come off with a thigh problem minutes after his spot-kick, awarded for defender Guido Milan's foul on Rachid Ghezzal. Milan picked up a harsh red card for his indiscretion. Coach Hubert Fournier confirmed that Lacazette would miss next week's trip to Monaco and was doubtful for the game against PSG the following week. ""We'll have to wait for a full report from the club's medical staff before we know how long he will be out,"" said Fournier. But Fournier expressed satisfaction with the result. ""We feel like we've done a job today. We were under a lot of pressure because everyone thought we were going to win, but Metz posed us a lot of problems,"" he said. Ibrahimovic once again proved the undoing of St Etienne, after he also scored the goal that eliminated them from the League Cup on January 13. This time the win came thanks to a penalty awarded after Jeremy Clement handled in the area, with Ibrahimovic stepping up to convert after 60 minutes for his ninth league goal this season. It condemned St Etienne to their first defeat going back to October 5, as they sit fourth eight points behind Lyon. Despite the closeness of the result, the Parisians dominated, and with defender Thiago Silva in form confirmed they have regained some of their solidity in defense. The visitors could have doubled their account after 70 minutes but Italian midfielder Marco Verratti's shot was blocked by St Etienne defender Paul Baysse, and six minutes later a Cavani effort hit the bar. Elsewhere Sunday, Evian helped their hopes of avoiding relegation with a 1-0 win over Toulouse which pushed them three points clear of the drop zone. Caen midfielder Julien Feret helped the Normandy side claim their second straight 4-1 victory, this time against his former club Rennes with three decisive passes and a goal five minutes from time. Feret set up Sloan Privat to head in after just four minutes, and was hand to tee up Lenny Nangis five minutes after the break before netting a third himself, as Damien Da Silva compounding Rennes' misery with a minute to go. Caen move off the bottom of the table to 18th place as midtable Rennes notched up a sixth game without a win to set themselves up a nervous trip to PSG next weekend."
1026,21/01/2015,23:59,Cavani on the mark again as PSG progress in Cup,Uruguayan international striker Edinson Cavani scored his second goal in as many games since being restored to the Paris Saint-Germain line-up as PSG reached the last 16 of the French Cup on Wednesday with a 2-1 win over Bordeaux.,"Cavani -- who along with Argentinian international Ezequiel Lavezzi were left out for three games by coach Laurent Blanc for returning late from the Christmas holidays -- gave the hosts a 14th minute lead which was doubled by Javier Pastore, also registering his second goal in as many matches. Bordeaux reduced the deficit two minutes into the second-half but PSG held on, despite having defender Zoumana Camara sent off seven minutes from time, in a far more assured performance than they have produced over the past few weeks. Their victory was achieved despite Blanc not starting first team regulars such as Thiago Motta, David Luiz and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, preferring to give them some rest ahead of the champions pivotal Ligue 1 clash with highflying St Etienne this weekend. Blanc was pleased to have secured their place in the last 16 in a competition which has been set as one of their targets by club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, although he regretted that they had not played at the same tempo in both halves. The former France national coach also denied that Ibrahimovic had been left out because of a loss of form -- he has still scored eight league goals despite having been laid low by injury earlier in the season. ""I wanted to rotate the squad,"" said the 49-year-old. ""What is more he has accrued two yellow cards and a third one would have seen him suspended. ""Also he needs some rest so he is on top form for the weeks ahead and I am optimistic he will be. ""We have a loaded schedule in February including the Champions League last 16 clash (with Barcelona)."" Blanc will have taken some pleasure at seeing St Etienne having to go to extra-time in their match on Wednesday with second tier Tours before prevailing 5-3. St Etienne's Dutch striker Ricky van Wolfswinkel -- who endured a miserable time in the English Premier League last season after a big money move to Norwich -- scored a double. Indeed Tours came closest to pulling off a shock as all the other Ligue 1 clubs progressed including holders Guingamp, who beat second division Chateauroux 2-0. There was no fairytale for the conquerors of Marseille in the previous round as an injury-depleted Grenoble side, from the fourth tier, lost to third division Boulogne. On Tuesday league leaders Lyon's hopes of the domestic double this season ended as a hat-trick by Vincent Bessat gave Ligue 1 rivals Nantes a 3-2 victory in a thrilling round of 32 French Cup clash. The 29-year-old -- who was born in Lyon -- scored the winner two minutes from the end of normal time to book the 'Canaries' place in the last 16. Quevilly, the team that Lyon beat to win the 2012 French Cup, produced another famous exploit as the fourth division French side claimed the scalp of Ligue 1 side Bastia, holding their nerve to prevail 3-1 on penalties after the match finished 1-1 after extra-time."
1027,18/01/2015,19:01,Cavani marks return from wilderness with goal,Edinson Cavani redeemed himself after being dropped for three matches by scoring in Paris Saint Germain's hard fought 4-2 Ligue 1 victory over Evian on Sunday.,"The 27-year-old Uruguayan star -- who along with Ezequiel Lavezzi had been suspended after they returned late from Christmas holidays -- notched his eighth goal of the campaign as PSG moved above St Etienne into third, four points adrift of leaders Lyon, who beat Lens 2-0 on Saturday. St Etienne then missed a chance to go back ahead of them when they fought out a 0-0 deadlock at Brittany outfit Rennes. In lashing, cold rain the two sides mustered a mere two shots on target all night Saint Etienne winger Ricky Van Wolfswinkel the only lively man on the pitch hobbled off after an hour. Second-placed Marseille -- who are ahead of PSG on goal difference -- host Guingamp in the weekend's final match with Ligue 1 looking like it may have a close run title run in this season. However, title favourites PSG's overall performance against a team in the relegation zone will still cause coach Laurent Blanc some concern. ""I had the impression that we were waiting for us to be hurt before reacting,"" said Blanc. ""We're happy we won and the three points are primordial. ""However, there are things from the performance to be analysed and resolved. ""It is not in the team's philosophy to be reacting but rather it is to be creating and be proactive,"" added the 49-year-old former France coach. The hosts went behind in the 14th minute as Zlatan Ibrahimovic's careless header dropped to an Evian player who fed Cedric Barbosa. Barbosa eluded Thiago Motta's tackle and fired in a shot which Salvatore Sirigu went the right way for but he failed to keep the ball out. Boos rang out round the ground and the fans nerves weren't eased as Evian goalkeeper Benjamin Leroy produced some remarkable saves to keep them in front. One from Ibrahimovic was especially noteworthy, although another at point blank range from David Luiz was even better and earned the goalkeeper a congratulatory hug from the Brazilian defender. However, it was Luiz who finally broke his resistance getting on the end of a corner to level the match and setting off on one of his trademark celebratory runs along the touchline that had former France president Nicolas Sarkozy grinning alongside PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi. Their grins were even wider as shortly before half-time Italian midfielder Marco Verratti prodded home for his first league goal for the club. The hosts were unable to put the game to bed during the second-half and it was Evian who equalised as Gregory van der Wiel's poor decision not to leave the ball, from a harmless freekick, and instead head it back to Sirigu proved disastrous. Sirigu was unable to gather the ball properly after saving it with one hand and the ball trickled over the line. Back came the boos and the time came for Blanc to send on Cavani -- whether it was his physical presence that prompted it or not PSG almost immediately restored their one goal advantage through Javier Pastore. Pastore played the ball to Ibrahimovic, who found Lucas out on the right and the Brazilian's low cross was superbly tucked away by the Argentinian striker. The match was finally safe when Cavani -- who had started the move -- pounced to tap in Ibrahimovic's pass and put himself not only level with the Swede as the club's joint top scorer with eight league goals but also back in the good books of both fans and coach."

St Etienne, though, can go back ahead of them should they beat Rennes later on Sunday while second-placed Marseille -- who are ahead of PSG on goal difference -- host Guingamp. However, PSG's overall performance against a team in the relegation zone will still have caused coach Laurent Blanc some concern.

1031,13/01/2015,23:48,Ibrahimovic's winner eases pressure on Blanc,Zlatan Ibrahimovic's hotly-contested second-half goal gave holders Paris Saint Germain a place in the last four of the League Cup after a 1-0 win over St Etienne on Tuesday.,"Ibrahimovic's 72nd minute goal, which he chested over the line despite the efforts of goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier to claw it away, was disputed both by the home players and the spectators. Angry fans hurled projectiles on to the pitch, including a plastic water bottle thrown at a linesman, and St Etienne coach Christophe Galtier urged the crowd to calm down. The match was held up for around 10 minutes while order was restored. The victory, though, is welcome both for PSG and especially for the coach Laurent Blanc, who has come under pressure in the past four weeks after a series of disappointing results and player trouble. PSG came into the game on the back of a 4-2 league defeat by modest Bastia last Saturday, with Blanc having disciplined big name players Edinson Cavani and Ezequiel Lavezzi for returning late from holiday. Blanc, who has guided PSG into the Champions League last 16 where they will play Chelsea, said that he had not been very confident before the match after what he had seen against Bastia. ""After the Bastia match I had the impression that we no longer knew how to play and there was a bad atmosphere within the squad,"" said Blanc. ""Tonight, though, I saw positive things and we have won at a place where it is difficult to do so. ""However, I am neither more reassured than I was before the match, but on the other hand neither am I very worried."" Earlier, Bastia continued their good run of form, recovering from going a goal behind early on to storm into their first League Cup semi-final since 2000 with a 3-1 victory over Rennes. The Corsican side, who unusually for a top tier side in Europe these days, fielded six homegrown players in their starting line-up and another five on the bench, were helped considerably by their opponents having two men sent off. Former France international striker Djibril Cisse rounded off a joyous night for Bastia as the 33-year-old fired home a powerful shot a minute from time. ""I am happy for the players for all the work they have put in in recent weeks,"" said Bastia coach Ghislain Printant, who is bidding to become only the second coach in the club's history to land a trophy with their sole piece of silverware coming in the 1981 French Cup. ""This semi-final is a deserved reward for them."" The semi-final line-up will be finalised on Wednesday when Monaco host French Cup holders Guingamp and Lille are at home to Nantes."
1032,10/01/2015,19:18,Bastia stun PSG in thrilling comeback,Paris Saint Germain gave up a two-goal lead when Bastia stormed back to win 4-2 in Corsica on Saturday as the defending champions spurned the chance to go top of Ligue 1.,"Laurent Blanc's men had looked to be in total control after goals in the 10th minute from Lucas, a lovely lob, and in the 20th when the 19-year-old Tottenham-linked midfielder Adrien Rabiot pounced on the loose ball and fired it with his left foot into the bottom corner. Ryad Boudebouz pulled one back from the spot for Bastia on the half-hour after Gregory Van der Wiel was harshly judged to have handled. And just on the stroke of half-time David Luiz was caught napping as Francois Modesto headed home a corner. Bastia took the lead with a thunderbolt in every sense of the word, as defender Julien Palmieri latched on to a poorly cleared corner in the 56th minute and unleashed a jaw-dropping half-volley. The pulsating finale ended when Palmieri himself ran clear of the defence to make it 4-2 in the 89th minute for a fully deserved win that ended eight straight Ligue 1 defeats for Bastia to the capital side. Ahead of the match a one minute silence was observed in the wake of the Islamist attacks that left 17 people dead this week. Some local fans unfurled a banner reading 'Qatar finances PSG and terrorism'. The shock loss left PSG in third, on 38 points, with Bastia two points above the relegation zone. Ligue 1 leaders Marseille, on 41 points, also lost on Friday when they went down 2-1 at Montpellier. Kevin Berigaud and Paul Lasne scored for the hosts either side of the interval with Bilel Omrani gave Marseille hope late on. Lyon are on 39 points, one ahead of PSG. Propelled by 17-goal top scorer Alexandre Lacazette, Lyon will now be licking their lips as they target three points at home to Toulouse on Sunday that would see them go a point clear at the top. Elsewhere fourth-placed Saint-Etienne will attempt to extend a 10-game unbeaten run in the league as they face Reims away. Fifth plays sixth at the Stade Louis II on Sunday night when Monaco entertain Bordeaux in a match which will see visiting coach Willy Sagnol return to the ground where he played between 1997 and 2000. Monaco will be looking for revenge for a 4-1 defeat at Bordeaux back in August and, fresh from winning their last seven games, should be an entirely different proposition this time."

""It's hasn't been very easy to work, the same as for everyone,"" said Blanc in Friday's press conference, which began with a minute's silence for the 13 victims of these attacks. ""But life goes on, we have to work hard and train, even if it's not in a happy context. ""We got together in the centre-circle at midday (Thursday, for the nationwide minute's silence) just like the rest of the country. ""Football is not pushed to one side. Footballers are citizens who are not insensitive to what's happening. ""But life and work goes on."" Looking ahead to the game, Blanc said it had come too soon for Brazilian-born Italy midfielder Thiago Motta, who is nursing a foot injury. Blanc added that he has yet to decide whether or not to forgive South American pair Edinson Cavani and Ezequiel Lavezzi and welcome them back into the fold. They were both dropped for Monday's 3-0 French Cup victory at Montpellier after missing a team training camp in Marrakech, Morocco. ""This decision has not yet been taken. I will take it after the match. There's no hurry, they weren't in a hurry to come back (from their holidays),"" added Blanc. ""They did something unacceptable, it's a lack of respect for the whole football club."""

A furious Blanc, however, declined to give details of the financial punishments meted out on the pair. ""We could have done without this, it comes at a bad time,"" said Blanc. ""We summonsed, Olivier (Letang, PSG's sporting director) and myself, Cavani and Lavezzi. We had explanations and following that the club took financial and sporting sanctions."" Former France international Blanc said he had ""the backing and support of the club"" to sanction the players. ""I find it inadmissible and unacceptable,"" said Blanc. ""When you're in a sports club, a collective project, once you put a personal project before the group, it puts the group in danger. I detest that. Once you meddle with the group and the team, I can become nasty and unforgiving."" Uruguayan Cavani and Argentine Lavezzi were notable absentees from a winter training camp in Morocco which culminated in a 1-0 friendly win over Inter Milan and neither player appeared at the club's first training session of the new year at the club's base in the Paris suburbs.

They were notable absentees from a winter training camp in Morocco which culminated in a 1-0 friendly win over Inter Milan on Tuesday and neither player appeared at Friday morning's first training session of the new year at the club's base in the Paris suburbs. They both only arrived back at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport on a flight from Buenos Aires at the same time as the training session started at 1000 GMT. Argentine Lavezzi finally arrived at the PSG training ground in his Ferrari four hours later, while Uruguayan Cavani followed about 10 minutes after that. After the pair had failed to show up in Morocco, Blanc said he would want ""some explanation"" from Cavani and Lavezzi. Blanc refused to be drawn on a possible transfer of either player, however. ""We can't say that today. We're going to wait until they arrive,"" he said. ""We'll expect some explanation, and then we'll make sporting decisions as a club."" Blanc said just before France's winter break that Cavani lacked ""confidence"" and was going through a ""difficult"" time. Arsenal have been linked with a move for the forward, although he would probably cost at least 50 million euros (£39m, $60m). Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini, meanwhile, has denied any contact with Lavezzi. Blanc on Sunday vowed to toughen ""discipline"" within the squad with PSG sitting in third place in Ligue 1, behind Lyon and leaders Marseille, at the season's halfway stage.

Former Newcastle favourite Cabaye grabbed the only goal of the match on 57 minutes when he converted following sustained pressure from the capital club. Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani was a notable absentee and given an extended winter break while talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic was given a chance to prove his return to fitness and lasted the full 90 minutes. PSG are currently third in Ligue 1, but only three points behind leaders and arch rivals Marseille, while they also have a key Champions League last-16 tie against Chelsea looming large in February.

Moura, who made his name with Sao Paulo and broke into the Brazilian national side in 2011 but failed to make the cut for the World Cup, told Globo television the Brazilian game is slower and that playing in Europe had bolstered his all-round development. Brazil coach Dunga called Lucas into his squads for recent friendlies against Austria and Turkey but injury forced his withdrawal. But he told Globo he hoped to get another chance to pull on the national shirt for a March 26 friendly in Paris. ""That would be special -- I can say France is my second country,"" Lucas said. Fellow international Paulinho could be in line to return to the Brazilian league, however, with media reports in Brazil saying Corinthians are looking to bring him home from Tottenham Hotspur after just a year in north London. Several sterling showings during Brazil's Confederations Cup success last year earned Paulinho a 22 million euros move to White Hart Lane but after a strong start the 26-year-old has been a peripheral figure this season. Last month, Paulinho admitted he was open to a move back to his old club owing to a lack of playing time with Spurs."

1040,20/12/2014,21:59,"PSG held at home, Marseille on course to end year on top","Paris Saint-Germain failed to find the killer punch in a drab goalless draw at home to Montpellier on Saturday, handing arch-rivals Marseille the chance to end the year on top of the Ligue 1 table.","Marseille stay top on goal difference before they take on Lille at home on Sunday while third-placed Lyon, who could theoretically upset the apple cart if Marseille came unstuck, travel to Bordeaux. But for the Parisians, it was another case of failing to live up to the pressure, following defeats to Barcelona in the Champions League and then Guingamp in the league, before an unconvincing 3-1 victory at second-tier AC Ajaccio in the League Cup in midweek. An error-strewn first-half at the Parc des Princes saw the mid-table visitors knock the Parisians out of their normally fluid style and frustrated them throughout the first 45 minutes. Montpellier could even claim the best chance of the first 45 minutes when Morgan Sanson had the the ball in the net with an acrobatic volley from Antony Mounier's cross from the left, but Mounier was harshly ruled offside and the goal did not count. PSG had to wait until five minutes from half-time before carving out a creditable chance of their own but failed to take advantage as Edinson Cavani needed one touch too many on Marco Verratti's through pass and the ball ran away from him, allowing Montpellier 'keeper Jonathan Ligali to smother it at his feet. The home side were looking anything like reigning champions even after upping the tempo at the start of the second half, as Montpellier managed to soak up everything PSG could throw at them. But PSG gave notice that it might not be long before they took the lead as they moved up a gear in the 63rd minute. First Lucas had a penalty appeal waved away after tangling with Abdelhamid El Kaoutari in the area and from the resulting corner, taken by Thiago Motta, Thiago Silva rose unchallenged to head goalwards only for Mounier to scramble it off the line. However, it was not be as the clock ran down with neither side looking likely to break the deadlock. Montpellier had scored seven goals in their previous two matches, but seemed mostly content to play a containing game and manager Rolland Courbis looked the happier at the final whistle as counterpart Laurent Blanc reflected on what might have been. Blanc said: ""I am disappointed with the last two games, against Guingamp and Montpellier, as we should have got more than one point from two matches and that would have meant we had a satisfactory first half of the season. ""Our lack of rhythm since the start of the campaign was evident again tonight."" He added: ""All season, we have been guilty of a lack of fight in midfield. It's true we didn't have many chances, but then nor did they. We are missing that attacking edge."" Ironically, the two sides will meet again in their very next next competitive match, having been drawn together in the French Cup, with the tie to be played in early January. Guingamp, meanwhile, continued their mini-revival with a hard-won point from the 1-1 draw at Toulouse to leapfrog their opponents into 12th place -- but still only three points above the relegation places. Thibault Giresse put Guingamp ahead in the eighth minute before Tongo Hamed Doumbia equalised after 26 minutes and Wissam Ben Yedder missed a 56th minute penalty, allowing the visitors to hold on for a share of the spoils. Nantes came away from the short trip to Lorient with all three points after a 2-1 win, Reims climbed to ninth with a 3-1 win away at Rennes and Monaco won 1-0 away at struggling Metz, while the bottom two, Caen and Bastia, shared the points in a 1-1 draw."

The capital club come into this weekend in second place, a point behind leaders Marseille, with Lyon two points off top spot in third place. OL managed to close the gap on the top two after both suffered defeats last weekend, with Paris losing for the first time in the league this season at Guingamp. Laurent Blanc's side host Montpellier at the Parc des Princes on Saturday, and there is pressure on PSG after they followed losses to Barcelona in the Champions League and then Guingamp with an unconvincing 3-1 victory at second-tier AC Ajaccio in the League Cup in midweek. ""We are a team who are going through a bad spell, and at times like that nothing smiles for you,"" said Blanc, whose biggest problem just now lies in central defence, where Brazilian duo Thiago Silva and David Luiz are struggling to find their best form. ""It is true that our defence has been a recurring problem since the start of the season, and it is something of a paradox that we also have the best defence in the league. ""Our biggest job is there, although there are other things we need to do."" Mid-table Montpellier have scored seven goals in their last two games, but PSG should be too strong for the 2012 champions, with the likes of Silva, Thiago Motta and Zlatan Ibrahimovic set to return refreshed after being rested in midweek. Before that game, Blanc had declared that some of his players would ""stay behind to recharge a little physically and mentally to be ready for the match against Montpellier"". However, visiting coach Rolland Courbis is relishing the chance to spring a surprise. ""End the year with a win at Paris Saint-Germain? Now there's a challenge,"" he said. ""I want my team to get in amongst them and bother them."" Courbis and his side host PSG in their next competitive match too as the two came out of the hat together in the French Cup draw, with the last-64 tie to be played in early January. A victory for PSG will take them above Marseille, at least before Marcelo Bielsa's side play on Sunday at home to Lille. The visitors come into the game fresh from beating Bordeaux on penalties in the League Cup on Wednesday night and must now try to stop OM recording a ninth straight league win at the Stade Velodrome. Lyon, meanwhile, travel to Bordeaux chasing a fourth successive league win and a return to form after being eliminated from the League Cup on penalties by Monaco. Forward Yassine Benzia is ruled out of the game for Lyon but they received a boost on Wednesday when playmaker Yoann Gourcuff made his comeback after his latest two-month spell on the sidelines due to injury. As for Monaco, the principality club are themselves riding the crest of a wave with their League Cup qualification following progression to the Champions League last 16 and last Sunday's 1-0 win over Marseille which left them sixth in the table. However, after going all the way to penalties on Wednesday, and with the likes of Ricardo Carvalho, Layvin Kurzawa, Geoffrey Kondogbia and Dimitar Berbatov all on the sidelines, Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim is less than pleased about having to go to Metz on Saturday. ""It is hard physically to put all these games together. It would have been more logical to play on Sunday,"" he moaned."
1042,11/12/2014,11:36,PSG fans knifed after Barca game,"Two Paris Saint-Germain supporters suffered knife wounds in two separate incidents following the French side's Champions League match on Wednesday against Barcelona in the Spanish city, police said.","The two victims, whose lives were not in danger, were taken to hospital for treatment, a police spokesman said, adding that the identity of their attackers was not known. One of the two victims remained in hospital. The attacks come less than two weeks after a Deportivo fan was killed after being beaten and pushed into a river during clashes outside Atletico Madrid's Vicente Calderon stadium before a La Liga match between the two sides. The Spanish government sacked the security heads of the two clubs after the death and Spain's Football Federation and the government-controlled Higher Sports Council have said tougher sanctions for clubs over violent behaviour by supporters will come into force on December 15. Barcelona won the match 3-1 but both sides qualified for the last 16 knockout stages of the competition."
1043,10/12/2014,22:45,Barcelona down PSG to secure top spot,"The attacking trio of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez were all on target as Barcelona came from behind to beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-1 on Wednesday in their Champions League Group F decider.","Both sides had already qualified for the last 16, but first place was still up for grabs, with the French champions needing just a point at the Camp Nou and Barcelona having to win. When Zlatan Ibrahimovic put the visitors ahead against his old club on 15 minutes, PSG appeared to be in control, but Barcelona's all-star front line all weighed in with goals to swing the match back the home side's way and ensure that Luis Enrique's side go through to next Monday's draw as group winners. Messi equalised just four minutes after Ibrahimovic's opener, before Neymar put the hosts ahead on 42 minutes and Suarez secured the victory 13 minutes from time, ending PSG's record as the last club in Europe's leading leagues still to be unbeaten in all competitions this season. With both sies having already qualified ahead of the final round of games, PSG coach Laurent Blanc had admitted that his men would be able to play with more freedom, as long as they could get the ball from their hosts. Barcelona monopolised possession right from the start, but PSG took the lead with their first shot on target, Ibrahimovic beating Marc-Andre ter Stegen with a first-time effort on his left-foot after Blaise Matuidi had laid off a Lucas ball in from the right. It was the Swede's 12th goal of an injury-hit campaign and the first time he had ever scored against Barcelona, the club with whom he spent a year under Pep Guardiola in 2009-10. However, Barcelona were quickly back level, Messi arriving at the back post to convert after neither David Luiz nor 'keeper Salvatore Sirigu had cut out Suarez's first-time ball across the six-yard box. Messi now has 75 Champions League goals, and 76 in all European competitions, equal with the all-time record mark of former Real Madrid star Raul. Enrique's decision to start with a back three left plenty of space for PSG to exploit in wide areas and they had chances to reclaim the lead. First when Matuidi's ball in from the left was struck wide by Lucas and then when Edinson Cavani connected with an Ibrahimovic assist from the other side, forcing a save from ter Stegen. However, the Catalans displayed their fearsome attacking firepower at the other end Sirigu beat away a Suarez shot before Neymar put them in front three minutes prior to the break. The Brazilian was released by Andres Iniesta before advancing and curling a superb shot beyond Sirigu into the right corner of the net for his third goal in the competition this season. It remained an enjoyably open contest in the second half and the French champions almost equalised in the 53rd minute when Lucas broke into the area, only for ter Stegen to deny the Brazilian before Cavani's follow-up was blocked practically on the line by Marc Bartra. Blanc sent on Javier Pastore and Ezequiel Lavezzi for midfield duo Marco Verratti and Matuidi as his side went in search of the equalising goal that would have put them back on top of the group. Yet it was Barcelona who scored again in the 77th minute, with Suarez getting on the scoresheet at the Camp Nou for the first time since joining the club from Liverpool in the summer. When Neymar's shot was turned out by Sirigu, Suarez was on hand to convert the rebound, securing the win and sealing revenge for a 3-2 defeat in Paris at the end of September."
1044,09/12/2014,02:15,Enrique hopes PSG defence wilts under Barca fire,"Barcelona's hopes of beating Paris Saint-Germain and leapfrogging them to finish top of their Champions League group rests on troubling the French champions' defence more than they did in the 3-2 defeat in Paris, claimed coach Luis Enrique.","PSG -- who came from behind to beat Nantes 2-1 on Saturday, ensuring they remained the only unbeaten team in the major European leagues -- top the table by a point and a draw will suffice to see them win their Champions League group for the third successive season. Barcelona, who prevailed in a tightly-fought quarter-final between the teams in the 2012/13 campaign, progressing on away goals, will be compelled to go for goals but enter the game on the back of a crushing 5-1 derby win over Espanyol, in which Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick. However, Enrique, who played with PSG coach Laurent Blanc at Barcelona, said that his forward line would have to be more clinical than they were in the entertaining defeat in Paris. ""I hope that their defence will suffer a little more at the Camp Nou than was the case in the first game,"" said the 44-year-old, who took over after Gerardo Martino was sacked following a trophyless season last term. ""I hope that we will deserve the victory, and the only way to do that is by showing our superiority on the pitch."" For Enrique, who played for both great Spanish clubs Real Madrid and Barca in his career, the match with PSG is the type of challenge he relishes and gives his players a test of their ability to beat the best. ""For us, the match against Paris Saint-Germain is a marvellous match, indeed it is perfect for us,"" he said. ""It presents us with an opportunity to beat the team that is the leader in the group, and who beat us in the first meeting. We know whatever the score is, a win is enough for us and we are going to rise to the occasion as we have done since the beginning of the season."" Enrique, who began his coaching career with the Barcelona B team before spells with Serie A side Roma and then Spaniards Celta Vigo, warned that his team would not be able to throw caution to the wind, though, especially with former Barca striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic facing them and in sparkling form. ""They have got Ibrahimovic back (he was injured for the game in Paris) and several other important players were rested ahead of this game. ""I am expecting a side not unlike the the one we played in Paris and with lots of attacking possibilities."" Enrique is likely to keep faith Dutch goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen, as he has done throughout the Champions Leaue campaign, but will hope he is more on his game than he was in Paris. Blanc will have virtually a full pack of cards to choose from in terms of personnel but the former France national coach is praying his players are not as dopey as they have been at times in Ligue 1 this season, and was the case against Nantes. ""We will have to be much more aggressive and determined in Barcelona,"" said Blanc. ""I managed this match (against Nantes) with one eye on the next game. It's ok because we won but sometimes we are playing with fire."" The good news for Blanc is that despite his long lay-off Ibrahimovic has not lost his sharpness in front of goal, as illustrated by his double against Nantes. ""Even an Ibra at 90 percent is a handful for most teams,"" said the club's Brazilian captain Thiago Silva. PSG will certainly hope that is the case on Wednesday."
1045,05/12/2014,22:36,Vintage Berbatov leads Monaco to victory,Veteran Bulgarian Dimitar Berbatov scored a brace as Monaco warmed up for a decisive Champions League date with a 2-0 win away to Toulouse in Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Berbatov's neat finish put the principality club ahead on the stroke of half-time at Le Stadium and the former Manchester United man then converted a penalty in the second half as Monaco climbed provisionally up to seventh in the table. Leonardo Jardim's side have spent most of the season playing catch-up with their rivals at the top of Ligue 1 but this win is a timely boost ahead of Tuesday's home Champions League clash with Zenit St Petersburg, in which a draw will be enough to take them through to the last 16. Monaco have significant selection problems in defence that will continue to cause concern when the Russian side come calling, with Ricardo Carvalho, Layvin Kurzawa and Elderson Echiejile sidelined as well as midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia. With young Brazilian Wallace suspended for the trip to south-west France, Aymen Abdennour was partnered in the heart of the defence against his former club by midfielder Jeremy Toulalan. Nevertheless, the makeshift back four kept a clean sheet while Berbatov made it three goals in his last two games after previously not finding the net since August. After Bernardo Silva had an effort cleared off the line by Dragos Grigore, Berbatov opened the scoring right on half-time with a sweet finish across goalkeeper Ali Ahamada after neatly controlling Anthony Martial's centre. Ahamada saved from Silva right at the start of the second period but Monaco eventually doubled their lead with 13 minutes left, Berbatov coolly converting a penalty awarded for a foul on Fabinho. Reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain, who go to Barcelona in the Champions League next midweek, currently trail leaders Marseille by a point but can go provisionally top of the table with the right result when they host Nantes on Saturday. Marseille are looking for an eighth consecutive home win when they face Metz on Sunday evening."
1046,05/12/2014,02:35,Marseille and PSG in race for Christmas bragging rights,"With three matches until the Ligue 1 winter break, the enthralling battle between Marseille and Paris Saint-Germain promises more twists in the race to be top of the table at Christmas.","Marcelo Bielsa's Marseille pacesetters cling to their one point lead over Laurent Blanc's unbeaten PSG side after both sides were held to a draw on the road in midweek. The two-time defending champions blew a chance to return to the summit on Wednesday when they were held 1-1 at struggling Lille while Marseille also wasted two points after settling for the same scoreline at Lorient. PSG host Nantes at the Parc des Princes on Saturday with a chance to at least take temporary possession of top spot before Marseille entertain Metz at the Velodrome 24 hours later. PSG then travel to Guingamp before hosting Montpellier in their final match before the break, while Marseille are in Monaco on the penultimate weekend and then finish with a home tie against Lille. Blanc said there were few regrets about the stalemate at Lille during a match in which he gave last season's Ligue 1 top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic the night off. ""I'm satisfied with the draw because I saw phases of play that I haven't seen with PSG for a long time,"" said Blanc. ""In my opinion our play was much more fluid that in previous weeks but of course we're disappointed not to go top. ""I rested Zlatan because of our schedule. You can't just come back from this type of injury after seven weeks out,"" added the former France and Bordeaux coach on the Swede's return from a heel problem. ""November was a tough month and I have to manage the squad. We wanted to rest Ibra (Ibrahimovic) because he just played three matches in a row and in December we have a series of five matches. We decided early on he would not make the trip to Lille."" continued the former centre-half. Marseille, who held a seven point lead over PSG after 10 of 16 matches this season, can look no further than their away form and a drop in goals from top scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac for their stuttering results of late. Gignac continues to lead the scoring charts on 11 alongside Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette, but the French international has only found the target once in his last six matches. ""We've been creating chances and playing well but our problem has not been playing away from home, it has been a lack of efficiency in front of goal,"" explained Bielsa. Elsewhere, Saint-Etienne are six points off top after their first home win in 20 years over arch rivals Lyon last Sunday, and a no-nonsense 2-0 win at 2012 champions Montpellier in midweek. Christophe Galtier's exciting side can keep the pressure on the top three when they host basement dwellers Bastia on Saturday. Brittany club and French Cup finalists Rennes, who host Montpellier the same evening, and Bordeaux, who await Lorient at the Stade Chaban-Delmas, are both in the mix just a point behind Saint-Etienne. Lyon stayed third, a point above Saint-Etienne, after Lacazette's injury-time winner over Reims on Thursday and they travel to Evian on Sunday. Last season's runners-up Monaco open the weekend slate on Friday when they make the short trip to Toulouse, Lens have a chance to escape the relegation zone at home to Lille while Reims entertain Guingamp and Caen meet Nice in Normandy.

1047,03/12/2014,22:58,PSG held by Lille after Sirigu own goal,An own goal by Paris Saint-Germain keeper Salvatore Sirigu held the French champions to a 1-1 draw at Lille on Wednesday in a stalemate that kept Marseille atop Ligue 1 by a single point.,"Edinson Cavani put PSG, who were without star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, into a 29th minute lead, after good work from Ezequiel Lavezzi down the right. That left Laurent Blanc's unbeaten side provisionally overtaking Marseille, who were held by the same scoreline by Lorient 24 hours earlier. But in the 42nd minute Lille were back level after Sirigu's attempt to punch away a corner did not have the desired effect as the ball hit the bar and went into his net. The match was at Lille's Metropole stadium which staged last month's Davis Cup tennis final. Earlier, Saint Etienne climbed into third on the back of a 2-0 win at Montpellier with the first half goals scored by defenders Florentin Pogba and Paul Baysse. ""It's a good week so far,"" said Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier ahead of the upcoming derby with Lyon. ""I don't know how far back we'd need to go to have 29 points after 16 games."" In Corsica, Bastia fans took direct action to show their displeasure after the club's 2-1 home loss to Evian, with a group of around 50 supporters blocking the players and officials' exit. This eighth loss of the season left them propping up the table on goal difference with 14 points. On Tuesday, Lorient's Ghana international Jordan Ayew scored a penalty to cancel out Dimitri Payet's opener and salvage a 1-1 draw against his former club Marseille. Toulouse saw off hosts Nantes 2-1, while Dimitar Berbatov was on the scoresheet as Monaco shrugged off being reduced to 10 men to beat Lens 2-0."
1048,29/11/2014,22:08,Zlatan penalty enough for PSG,Paris Saint-Germain kept the pressure on Marseille at the top of Ligue 1 with a 1-0 win against Nice at the Parc des Princes on Saturday thanks to an early Zlatan Ibrahimovic penalty.,"The Swede's second goal in as many games and sixth in Ligue 1 this season may have been the only goal of the match, but the defending champions could, and should, have won by a greater margin against limited mid-table opponents. Nevertheless, Laurent Blanc's side remain unbeaten this season and have now recorded nine consecutive victories in all competitions, with this latest triumph allowing them to close the gap on Marseille back to one point following OM's 2-0 defeat of Nantes on Friday night. ""The third match in a week is always a difficult match. We changed half the side from the one that beat Ajax on Tuesday,"" said PSG coach Blanc. ""We'd like to be better, but we're working on it and the best is still to come for this team."" PSG welcomed back captain Thiago Silva and Thiago Motta after both had missed the midweek Champions League game against Ajax, and while Nice might have opened the scoring inside seven minutes when Alassane Plea tested Salvatore Sirigu with a low shot, the home side came flying out of the blocks. Edinson Cavani, who had scored seven goals in his last seven club appearances, sent a dipping volley from outside the area narrowly wide before Ibrahimovic showed sublime skill to take down a long Javier Pastore ball, turn and lash a shot against the post. The breakthrough duly arrived on the quarter-hour when a penalty was awarded after Lucas was cleaned out in the box by two Nice defenders, Jordan Amavi and Romain Genevois. And Ibrahimovic, who scored a hat-trick in this fixture last season, stepped up to score from the spot despite goalkeeper Mouez Hassen diving the right way. Cavani then forced a good save out of Hassen after exchanging passes with Ibrahimovic but, perhaps with one eye on next Wednesday's trip to Lille, Paris were unable to keep up their excellent start to the game. ""My team learned a great deal tonight, we were overwhelmed in the first half hour,"" said Nice handler Claude Puel. ""We were so tense in the first-half we could hardly clear the ball. But we survived the storm with great team-work and generosity."" Nice maintained hope of snatching something from the encounter and Plea should have done better with a header from Amavi's cross before the latter himself glanced a header wide from a free-kick 12 minutes from time. However, PSG held out and have now been beaten just once in their last 38 home league games. Marseille continue to set the pace after Florian Thauvin scored one goal and set up another on Friday to end Nantes' sequence of nine matches without defeat that had seen the resurgent Canaries climb into the top four. Thauvin deftly converted a Dimitri Payet cross and then saw his free-kick headed in by Rod Fanni before half-time for Marcelo Bielsa's side. In the later games on Saturday, Monaco followed their Champions League win at Bayer Leverkusen in midweek with a 2-0 defeat at Rennes, as the Brittany outfit climbed to fourth. Three rapid-fire goals in five second-half minutes saw Lorient climb out of the relegation zone with a 3-2 win at Toulouse. Caen and Motpellier drew 1-1, Lens beat Metz 2-0 in the northern derby and Bastia's new interim coach Ghislain Printant saw his side slump back into the relegation zone with a 2-1 defeat at Reims. On Sunday, third-placed Lyon make the short journey to face derby rivals Saint-Etienne, who are sixth."
1049,26/11/2014,02:15,Blanc looking for PSG improvement against Barcelona,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc is confident his side can raise their game when they face Barcelona next month looking for the draw that will take them into the Champions League last 16 as Group F winners.,"Both sides had already qualified for the knockout stage before recording wins on Tuesday, with PSG beating Ajax 3-1 at the Parc des Princes and Barcelona crushing APOEL Nicosia 4-0 in Cyprus with the help of a Lionel Messi hat-trick. And the French champions are a point clear at the top of the section, meaning a draw at the Camp Nou in a fortnight will see them progress as winners of their group for the third season running and, in theory, set up a kinder draw in the next round. A brace from Edinson Cavani either side of a Zlatan Ibrahimovic strike gave Paris their eighth straight win in all competitions and maintained their unbeaten record this season, and yet PSG were once again some way short of their very best against the Dutch champions. ""I think we came up against a team that played better football than us but were not that dangerous at the end of the day,"" said Blanc, whose side were pegged back by a Davy Klaassen equaliser midway through the second half only for Ibrahimovic and Cavani to both score late on. ""The more clinical and dangerous team was PSG. It is the second time where the statistics have been against us in terms of possession (against Ajax) but we also need to be able to win games in situations like this."" Of the impending clash with Barcelona, who PSG beat 3-2 at the Parc des Princes in a thrilling game in September, Blanc said: ""For now let's appreciate this win. We have games to play in the league between now and then. ""Between now and December 10, even though it's not far away, we will improve. Barcelona will certainly make things difficult for us, like they did here, but we can make things difficult for them too and it will be a great match."" The sluggish nature of PSG's performance left Ajax coach Frank de Boer disappointed that his side could not take advantage and he admitted that the Ligue 1 outfit will need to up their game at the Camp Nou. ""They have some players who maybe have some nonchalance in them, a lack of concentration at times,"" said de Boer. ""I think if they play against Barcelona like this it will be very difficult for them."" However, PSG should have captain Thiago Silva and midfield trio Thiago Motta, Marco Verratti and Yohan Cabaye back from injury by then. ""We have injuries but we have to get on with it,"" said Blanc. ""Despite that we keep moving forward. The injured players will come back but they will need a few games to get back to their best level."" Meanwhile, De Boer must lift his side for a home game with APOEL which will decide who takes third place and a berth in the Europa League, although he is set to be without captain Nicolai Boilesen with a serious-looking injury that forced him off early on and is likely to require an operation. ""I think sadly he will need an operation. I think he has damaged ligaments,"" said De Boer. ""It's a shame that we made lots of errors and committed lots of silly fouls. It was very, very frustrating, but we did much better in the second half."""

And Cavani then made sure of the victory as PSG moved a step closer to their objective of advancing to the last 16 as group winners, the result allowing them to maintain a one-point lead over Barcelona with a trip to the Camp Nou still to come next month. Barcelona won 4-0 away to APOEL in Cyprus in the night's other game, but with both sides already through to the last 16 before this matchday, the French champions now know that a draw in Spain next month will see them progress in first place. The statistics make for impressive reading for Laurent Blanc's side, who have now won eight games in a row in all competitions and remain unbeaten this season, a status shared only with Chelsea in Europe's leading leagues. PSG are also now undefeated in 32 European outings at the Parc des Princes, a record that stretches back over eight years, although Ajax could count themselves a little unlucky to return to Amsterdam with nothing to show for their efforts. The Dutch champions, with only one player aged over 25 in their starting line-up, played the better football for long spells but, having already been eliminated before this game, can now look forward to a home game with APOEL in two weeks in which they will hope to secure the consolation of a place in the Europa League in the new year. The loss of captain Nicolai Boilesen to injury after just 10 minutes came as a blow to Frank de Boer's side but it did not prevent them from keeping the ball for long spells inside the opposition half. Nevertheless, a PSG side missing Thiago Silva, Thiago Motta, Marco Verratti and Yohan Cabaye fired the first real warning shot in the 24th minute. Ibrahimovic, facing his former team, played Ezequiel Lavezzi through with just the goalkeeper to beat but the Argentine was denied by a fine Jasper Cillessen save. Only a superb interception by Gregory van der Wiel prevented Arkadiusz Milik from closing in on goal at the other end before Paris broke the deadlock just after the half-hour mark, Ibrahimovic lofting a pass over the Ajax defence for Lavezzi, who squared the ball to Cavani and allowed the Uruguayan to finish into an empty net. That should have given the hosts a platform from which to build but instead they appeared content to try and see the game out, and were duly punished in the second half. Tricky teenage winger Ricardo Kishna whipped in a glorious cross from wide on the left and Klaassen stooped to head low into the net past the despairing dive of Salvatore Sirigu. Lasse Schone then curled a free-kick narrowly over for the away side but it was Paris who struck again 11 minutes from time, Ibrahimovic controlling and volleying past Cillessen from the right-hand side of the box to find the net at the far post. And as the rain lashed down, a poor back-pass by Niki Zimling allowed Cavani to round Cillessen and make it 3-1 in the 83rd minute as he scored his seventh goal in his last seven games for the club."

1052,24/11/2014,19:53,PSG focussed on Ajax ahead of Barca finale,"Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc and his players say they are not taking the visit of Dutch side Ajax lightly as they face off in Champions League Group F action, despite the fact they have already qualified for the second round.","The two-time defending French champions top the pool with 10 points while Barcelona are one point back, and also qualified ahead of the final day clash between the two teams at the Camp Nou, which will determine the group winners. Ajax still have the matter of sealing third place and a spot in the Europa League although Cypriot club APOEL Nicosia are just one point back and at home to Barcelona the same night. ""We can not start thinking about the match against Barca,"" warned PSG keeper Salvatore Sirigu. ""Before playing this so called final, we have to first of all play against Ajax and win,"" added the Italian. ""Ajax are going to give everything, they are playing for third place and that's important for them. Looking at the away match and the problems they caused us, our thoughts are not about Barca but much more on the match tomorrow."" Ajax coach Frank De Boer has promised his side are going to throw everything into the match in order to push closer towards a place in Europe's second-tier competition. ""We are not going to give up without a fight, we play very good football and we can't play with fear in our bellies,"" said the former Dutch international. ""I don't want us to play with fear but put up a real fight to get the best result possible."" Blanc has guided PSG to an unbeaten start to the season in all competitions and the 3-2 victory over Barcelona on September 30 set up the one point difference between the clubs. The capital club would only need a draw at Barcelona, if they win on Tuesday, to get the all important top spot but Blanc says his team still need to be more ruthless after dropping two points in Holland during the 1-1 draw in the reverse fixture against Ajax. ""We didn't have the same confidence when we played that match and we still have progress to make, but we are still very present in Ligue 1 and also the Champions League. ""I think, and I hope that in the important moments we will be more like killers, which we weren't in the first match,"" added the former Bordeaux and France coach."
1053,24/11/2014,02:30,PSG hampered by injury problems ahead of Ajax clash,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc continues to struggle with a raft of injury problems as his side prepare to entertain Ajax at the Parc des Princes in Champions League Group F on Tuesday.,"The French champions are already through to the last 16 for the third season running after following up a 1-1 draw away to Ajax in September with three consecutive wins. They come into their penultimate group game a point clear of Barcelona, who have also qualified, and their trip to the Camp Nou on December 10 is set to decide who goes through to the knockout stage as winners of the section. However, in the seemingly unlikely event that Barcelona should lose to APOEL in Cyprus, PSG would be guaranteed top spot by beating already-eliminated Ajax in the French capital. Few would bet against PSG, who are unbeaten in 31 home games in Europe and are still unbeaten in 19 games in all competitions this season after a 3-2 win at Metz in Ligue 1 on Friday. A late goal by Ezequiel Lavezzi against Metz clinched a seventh straight win for Laurent Blanc's side, but the PSG coach saw his injury worries increase in that match as midfield duo Yohan Cabaye and Thiago Motta both came off prematurely. ""Motta came off at half-time with a calf problem. Yohan Cabaye also had a calf problem. That is what happens to clubs who have a lot of international players. You need to be able to deal with it,"" conceded Blanc. David Luiz, Lucas and Marco Verratti all missed that game and the latter is expected to be on the sidelines once more against Ajax, so young midfielder Adrien Rabiot could again feature after starting for the first time this season against Metz. The weekend win also saw talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic start for his club for the first time in two months after a heel injury. Ibrahimovic, who spent three years with Ajax before joining Juventus in 2004, will now be looking forward to facing his old club, while full-backs Gregory van der Wiel and Maxwell will also face their former side. ""It is always special for me to play against Ajax. I learnt so many things there. My time in Amsterdam allowed me to become a man,"" said Maxwell, who made his name in Europe during a five-year spell with Ajax. Ajax have lost only two of their last 15 games but both defeats came against Barcelona and their 2-0 home loss to the Catalans three weeks ago condemned them to another premature exit from the Champions League. They have mustered just two points from four games so far but remain a point clear of APOEL in the battle to claim the consolation of a place in the Europa League, with a home encounter against the Cypriots to come. Ajax came from behind to beat Heerenveen 4-1 on Saturday and sit second in the Dutch Eredivisie, two points behind leaders PSV. They have appeared vulnerable defensively at times this season but coach Frank de Boer, who is without the banned Joel Veltman, hopes his team can put up a good showing in France. ""I am not worried about my defence. Obviously, we cannot allow ourselves any lapses in concentration against a team like Paris,"" he said. ""But my men will apply themselves in the right manner, I am convinced of that."""
1054,22/11/2014,10:54,France bans Ajax fans without tickets for Champions League,French authorities said Saturday that Ajax Amsterdam fans without tickets would not be allowed to travel to the French capital for Tuesday's Champions League clash with Paris St Germain.,"An Interior Ministry decree said ""a large number of Dutch supporters, joined by supporters from other countries, are expected in Paris"" ahead of the match and had agreed to stage a battle ""in a symbolic part of the capital"". The decree outlining the ban highlighted the fierce rivalry between Paris and Amsterdam fans and past violence involving Ajax supporters. Only the 850 Ajax fans with tickets would be allowed to travel to Paris, the decree said. It did not say how other supporters would be stopped however. The ministry said the there was a ""serious risk to the safety of people and property"". It added that Ajax fans, even when escorted by Dutch police, ""are known for acts of violence when travelling with the club, particularly during European cup matches"". It highlighted violence involving Dutch fans and those of SV Hamburg, Borussia Dortmund, AC Milan and Lyon. Paris St Germain lead Champions League qualifying Group F ahead of favourites Barcelona. They drew 1-1 with Ajax in Amsterdam on September 17."
1055,17/11/2014,15:15,PSG to play Inter Milan friendly in Morocco,"Paris Saint-Germain will play Inter Milan in a friendly in the southern Moroccan city of Marrakesh on December 30, it was announced Monday.","According to the Moroccan football federation, the two teams will hold training camps in the city during their respective leagues' winter breaks. The match will be played in the 40,000-seater Grand Stade, which will have hosted the final of the FIFA Club World Cup 10 days previously. Marrakesh was also to have been host to the opening match of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, but Morocco refused to host the tournament in January-February over fears of the spread of the deadly Ebola epidemic. The north African state had called for the Cup to be postponed, but organisers CAF rejected their request, stripping them of their position as hosts and barring them from playing in the continental showcase. Oil-rich Equatorial Guinea, which co-hosted the 2012 edition with Gabon, were named as Morocco's replacement as new hosts for the 2015 tournament."
1056,09/11/2014,23:05,PSG too strong for Marseille as Ligue 1 race tightens,Paris Saint-Germain defeated arch rivals Marseille 2-0 at the Parc des Princes on Sunday as the Ligue 1 title race was thrown wide open.,"The two-time defending champions dominated their visitors from the south in an intense encounter and wrapped up three crucial points thanks to an opportunist strike from Brazilian Lucas Moura and a close-range header from Edinson Cavani. PSG are now just one point behind Marseille as their unbeaten start to the season, in all competitions, continued in the biggest fixture in French football. Lyon, who won their fifth straight match earlier in the day when they downed Guingamp 3-1 at the Stade Gerland, are also breathing down the necks of Marseille and stand two points adrift. The match in the capital struggled to burst into life despite the return of PSG's Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic who came on with 24 minutes left for his first action since September 21. Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa looked on in shock with the match 1-0 as his side's chances of an equaliser took a severe turn for the worse with 12 minutes left when Giannelli Imbula was shown a straight red card for what appeared to be a minor offence. Cavani capped a convincing performance for PSG with a poacher's header from just outside the six-yard box with five minutes remaining that capped a perfect week for the capital club who also booked their place in the Champions League knockout phase. Monaco held on for a 1-1 draw at Saint-Etienne despite finishing the match with ten men in a stormy encounter at the Geoffroy Guichard stadium. Reims extended their unbeaten run to five matches with a 2-0 victory over Lille, who now haven't won in the league in five outings. Alexandre Lacazette went top of the Ligue 1 scoring charts with 11 goals as he opened the scoring for Lyon in the eighth minute with a back post header from Nabil Fekir's cross. Fekir doubled the lead on 20 minutes after converting on the slide a low cross from Christophe Jallet. At that point Lyon seemed in cruise control but they needed Fekir's second goal, three minutes from time, to finally steady their nerves. The Cup holders pulled a goal back on the stroke of halftime as Sylvain Marveaux's free-kick came back off the bar and hit Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes before going in. Under steady rain at Saint-Etienne, Lacina Traore saw his shot deflected past Stephane Ruffier to put Monaco 1-0 in front after just 17 minutes. However Saint-Etienne, were handed the first of two dubious decisions on 58 minutes, when Dutchman Ricky van Wolfswinkel was allowed to run clear despite being blatantly offside and he gratefully tucked away the equaliser. Monaco suffered more bad fortune when they were reduced to ten men with 19 minutes left when Tiemoue Bakayoko was shown a second yellow card for a light brush against a Saint-Etienne player that even had the home players appealing to the referee for leniency. ""We didn't create a lot of chances and we were lucky enough to take the lead but we weren't able to protect the advantage,"" said Monaco playmaker Jeremy Toulalan. ""We've being playing some good matches and we might have lost this one a while ago but it's a good draw and now we just have to push on and hope for better results."""
1057,08/11/2014,18:48,Ibrahimovic returns to PSG squad to face Marseille,Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been included in Laurent Blanc's squad to face Marseille on Sunday in the Ligue 1 top-of-the-table clash at the Parc des Princes.,"The Sweden captain, has been out of action since September 21 with a heel injury, but only returned to full training on Friday. ""He has been out seven weeks but of course he wants to play but we have to consider our decision carefully,"" Blanc said on whether last season's top scorer would play against Marseille who come into the high-octane clash with a four-point lead over their arch-rivals. ""He cannot sprint at 100 per cent and between doing cycling and 'ab' work to flat out sprinting, there is a big difference,"" added Blanc, who played as a defender for Marseille between 1997 and 1999. ""If he is ready, the question remains whether he can start the match. Is it reasonable to throw him into such a big match? The answer is no! But when it's Zlatan, reason doesn't come into it because he is a player who is out of the ordinary."" Lucas and Marco Verratti are also in the 20-player squad despite carrying knocks while key defender Thiago Motta and Gregory Van der Wiel are suspended."
1058,07/11/2014,14:21,Ibrahimovic poised for 'Clasico' return,"Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is poised to make his return in Sunday's top-of-the-table Ligue 1 clash against Marseille after returning to full training on Friday, the capital club confirmed.","The Sweden captain took part in training for the first time since injuring his heel on September 21 and his return is a huge boost for Laurent Blanc's champions, who come into the high-security clash at the Parc des Princes, four points back of their arch rivals. The club published several photos of last season's Ligue 1 top scorer in training with the headline - ""Encouraging signs ahead of the clasico"". Ibrahimovic, who scored 41 goals in all competitions last season, trained with the ball for the first time on Thursday and later spoke on the club's tv channel about his motivation to make his return against Marseille, arguably the biggest fixture in French football. ""This type of match, you have to win. I've played in a lot of derbies in my career, in Holland, Italy, in Spain so I have the experience in these situations,"" continued the former Ajax, Juventus, AC Milan and Barcelona star. His Brazilian teammate Lucas fuelled the rumours about a potential return when he spoke to AFP and revealed the Swede's initial form. ""I saw him yesterday on the training ground and he was running very well. He said he was feeling a bit of pain but he's doing really well and is running normally. I hope he will be ready Sunday because we've missed him and he's a great player,"" said Lucas."
1059,06/11/2014,02:15,PSG wary of Marseille after securing Euro progress,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc is hoping his side's Champions League exertions do not work against them in Sunday's top of the table clash with bitter rivals Marseille.,"PSG will head into the biggest grudge match in French football with the pressure on as they trail the Ligue 1 leaders by four points. And while Blanc's men were busy securing their place in the Champions League knockout stage with two games to spare in Group F by defeating APOEL of Cyprus 1-0 at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday thanks to Edinson Cavani's early strike, Marseille have no European distractions this season. When asked if his team had set themselves up perfectly for Sunday's encounter by maintaining their unbeaten record this season and making it five wins on the bounce in all competitions, Blanc suggested that the APOEL performance could work against them. ""Is playing a Champions League match on a Wednesday ideal preparation for a 'Clasico' on a Sunday? I don't know,"" said the former Marseille defender. ""Winning is always better than losing or drawing, it helps you recover better. ""Marseille will come here with an ambitious mindset after the start they have had to the season, but we will approach the match in the same way."" Despite being undefeated three months into the campaign, too many draws allowed Marseille to pull away at the top, with PSG saving their best performance so far for their Champions League win against Barcelona at the end of September. ""We have dropped points in games this season but the fact we are playing in the Champions League has prevented us from picking up as many as we maybe deserve,"" added Blanc. ""It's certainly an advantage for Marseille, and the more games you play the more you expose yourself to the risk of picking up injuries."" PSG have been without their biggest asset, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, for the last seven weeks as the Swede battles to recover from a heel injury. He watched the victory over APOEL from the stands and Blanc was cautious when asked if his star centre-forward might return this weekend. ""I can't answer that, honestly. I said last week it is a very unusual injury but he has made good progress in the last few days. ""I think we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. He has started training and running, and if that progress continues in the coming days, everything is possible."" In Ibrahimovic's absence, more responsibility falls on the shoulders of Cavani, who scored his fourth goal in his last four appearances to put PSG ahead after just 57 seconds against APOEL and hit the post soon after, but also squandered several other openings. ""Strikers go through spells where they get the breaks. The goal was probably his least easy chance,"" said Blanc. ""He is a boy who scores goals and always will, but he lacks confidence."" PSG's next Champions League outing is at home to Ajax at the end of this month, with December's trip to Barcelona -- whose 2-0 win in Amsterdam on Wednesday also took them through -- likely to decide who goes through to the last 16 as winners of Group F. ""We needed the three points to be sure of going through. Now let's try to confirm our ambition and finish first, which is an advantage -- a small one, but an advantage all the same,"" said Blanc. APOEL are bottom of the group with only one point but could yet pip Ajax to third and the consolation of a place in the Europa League knockout stage."
1060,04/11/2014,15:17,Ibrahimovic to miss PSG's Champions League match,Striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic will miss Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League match against APOEL on Wednesday with the nagging heel injury that has now seen him sidelined for more than 10 weeks this season.,"PSG coach Laurent Blanc said the Swede was ""not far away, but he's missing something"". ""It's an injury that is not muscular, so he has had to work it a lot,"" Blanc said. ""He's lacking competition and has lost contact with the ball, but physically he's not lost much."" Blanc, with one eye on Sunday's Ligue 1 match against Marseille, added: ""If that damn pain went away, he could be very competitive very quickly."" Quizzed on Ibrahimovic's call-up by Sweden for matches on November 15 and 18 against Montenegro and France, Blanc replied: ""It doesn't surprise me. ""When you have a chance of getting a guy like that back, you try your arm."""
1061,04/11/2014,02:15,PSG keep focus on Europe as Marseille await,Paris Saint-Germain have their eyes set on sealing a place in the last 16 of the Champions League when they entertain APOEL at the Parc des Princes in Group F on Wednesday.,"The French capital club are unbeaten at home in Europe in eight years and a win against the Cypriot champions will be enough to take them through to the knockout phase in the competition for the third season running providing Ajax fail to beat Barcelona in Amsterdam in the night's other game. Laurent Blanc's side, who have not lost at all this season, dream of winning the Champions League but their display against APOEL in Nicosia two weeks ago, when they required a late Edinson Cavani strike to secure a 1-0 victory, means they will not be taking the group's supposed outsiders lightly. ""I think this match will be similar to when we played them last time. Nicosia are a difficult team to play against, aggressive in the right way and with good individual talents,"" Paris goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu told the club's website. ""They get men behind the ball and it is difficult to find spaces against them."" In recent times, PSG have saved their best performances for Europe, such as their 3-2 win against Barcelona at the end of September, while in Ligue 1 their displays have often been laboured. However, this week they could perhaps be forgiven for prioritising domestic matters with a crunch home meeting with their bitter rivals Marseille -- whom they trail by four points at the top of the table -- awaiting on Sunday evening. Blanc's injury worries have eased of late, with Brazilian centre-back Marquinhos returning to the side after a month on the sidelines in Saturday's 2-1 success at Lorient while Zlatan Ibrahimovic is on the road to recovery from a heel injury. The Swede, still PSG's top scorer this season, has been sidelined since September 21, and while he has been called up by Sweden for a Euro 2016 qualifier in Montenegro next week, it seems unlikely that he will be ready to return just yet. Cavani will therefore once again lead the home attack while right-back Gregory Van der Wiel and midfielder Thiago Motta will start before sitting out the Marseille encounter due to suspension. APOEL may only have one point so far, from a 1-1 home draw with Ajax, but they were only beaten 1-0 in Barcelona before almost holding PSG two weeks ago and they need a result to boost their chances of at least finishing third. The Cypriot club, coached by former Greek international Giorgos Donis, are four points clear at the top of their domestic league after beating Ethnikos Achna 4-0 away at the weekend with Irish former Celtic striker Cillian Sheridan scoring twice. Their most dangerous weapon is the veteran Brazilian Gustavo Manduca, although the former Benfica player is nursing a hamstring problem and Donis has a concern at left-back with Marios Antoniades and one-time Monaco man John-Arne Riise injured."
1062,01/11/2014,19:17,PSG gear change cranks up pressure on Marseille,Unbeaten Paris Saint Germain drew to within a single point of Ligue 1 leaders Marseille on Saturday with a come-from-behind 2-1 away win over Lorient.,"Lorient stunned the champions with Raphael Guerreiro's tight shot opening the scoring on 42 minutes. But Paris came back early in the second-half with goals from Edinson Cavani and substitute Jean-Christophe Bahebeck. Marseille, who lost at Lyon last weekend, have 25 points ahead of their home game with Lens on Sunday and PSG have 24, as these two giants of French football get ready to go head-to-head in Paris next weekend. Paris also maybe had one eye on their Champions League clash with APOEL of Cyprus in midweek, given the pedestrian nature of a sluggish first-half performance. But they were given a rude awakening just before half-time. Lorient came out of defence to launch a blistering break in their orange strip and yellow boots. Andre Ayew took the ball into the box and fed midfielder Raphael Guerreiro, who stunned PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu with his sudden tight-angled shot to make it 1-0. ""We played badly all over the pitch in the first half. But you saw straight away the difference in the second half, and we got a goal straight away and went in for the win,"" the PSG 'keeper said. And the difference was indeed eye-catching as Paris moved up a gear. A defence splitting pass from Argentine playmaker Javier Pastore set up Cavani's equaliser just after the break, the Uruguayan nimbly hoisting the ball over the onrushing 'keeper before executing his traditional rifle-shot goal celebration. It was his third goal in three starts. Coach Laurent Blanc then made a double substitution bringing on Marco Veratti for the misfiring Yohan Cabaye and Jean-Christophe Bahebeck for a tired looking Ezequiel Lavezzi and it paid immediate dividends. Veratti fed Bahebeck as he ran into space and his shot flew home from a tight angle to send a wave of joy through a relieved Paris side. PSG can now look ahead to next Sunday with confidence. ""We are hoping for a great show next week and a great performance from both teams, we're all looking forward to it,"" said Sirigu. In Friday's game Monaco drew 1-1 at home to Reims. Later Saturday, Lille host St Etienne, Nantes welcome Rennes in the Brittany derby Sunday and Marseille will be keen to reopen a four-point gap on Paris when they host Lens in Sunday's late game."
1063,31/10/2014,15:44,Ibrahimovic again absent but recovering well,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc on Friday revealed that Zlatan Ibrahimovic is recovering well from a nagging heel problem but admitted the Swede will miss Saturday's Ligue 1 trip to Lorient.,"""He is feeling a lot better, not enough to enable him to train with the rest of the squad or for him to be in the squad tomorrow but there are some positive signs,"" said Blanc at a press conference. ""Yesterday and the day before were rare days where he did not feel any pain. I see that as a positive sign and he is quite satisfied himself."" PSG face APOEL of Cyprus in the Champions League next week and then host Ligue 1 leaders Marseille on November 9, but Blanc suggested that the Swedish striker will not be ready to return until later in the month. ""We have waited four weeks, we can wait another week or 10 days. He is starting to feel the time dragging but as long as that pain was there he could only work on his own and he couldn't just do anything. ""Once there is no more pain, he can start to work more intensively."" Ibrahimovic, the leading scorer in Ligue 1 in each of the last two seasons, has not played since the 1-1 draw with Lyon in late September but Blanc has no doubts that he will quickly rediscover full fitness. ""He will quickly get back to his previous level because he has worked. He has been on the bike and done exercises to keep up his fitness,"" said Blanc, whose side come into the weekend in second place in the table, four points behind Marseille."
1064,31/10/2014,02:25,PSG bid to crank up pressure on stuttering Marseille,"As their meeting with bitter rivals Marseille approaches, Paris Saint-Germain will look to further increase the pressure on the Ligue 1 leaders with a win at struggling Lorient on Saturday.","PSG are the only side in France's top flight to still boast an unbeaten record after Marseille went down 1-0 at Lyon last weekend, a result that means the two clubs are now separated by just four points at the top of the table. The clubs clash in the French game's biggest grudge match at the Parc des Princes on November 9, and Paris would love to go into 'Le Classique' with a chance of seizing first place from OM. A win at Lorient would leave just one point between the sides and turn up the heat on Marseille, who host Lens at the Stade Velodrome on Sunday night. Laurent Blanc's PSG, who host APOEL of Cyprus in the Champions League next midweek, welcome back Edinson Cavani after suspension for the trip to Brittany while Marquinhos is set to return, but they must do without the banned Gregory Van der Wiel. Zlatan Ibrahimovic is still on the sidelines with a heel problem that refuses to go away, yet the capital side should still have enough firepower to take three points from the artificial pitch at the Stade du Moustoir. ""It is very important for us to win at Lorient to stay alongside Marseille,"" captain Thiago Silva told PSG TV. ""We are playing them in our next game so this is a chance to close the gap. Artificial pitches are very different. The ball goes very fast, so we will need to be fully focused."" Lorient may have won at Evian in the League Cup in midweek but their miserable league form -- six defeats in their last seven outings -- suggests that their chances of causing an upset are slim. ""They are not unbeatable. We will do everything to try and get a result,"" declared their former Marseille striker Jordan Ayew optimistically. Ayew's old side had equalled the club record of eight successive league wins before coming unstuck at Lyon, and Marcelo Bielsa's men were then eliminated from the League cup at Rennes on Wednesday, going down 2-1. ""Losing makes me sad. We are very disappointed to exit the competition so quickly,"" said Bielsa after seeing OM take the lead only to be hauled back on level terms before conceding the winner in the last minute. ""Two defeats in a row obviously forces us to rethink things. Sunday's game is very important and we must immediately start thinking about that."" Against Lens, Bielsa will welcome back a host of players who were rested in the League Cup, including goalkeeper Steve Mandanda and leading scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac, although full-back Brice Dja Djedje is banned after his red card at Rennes. On Friday, Monaco will look to continue their recent good form when they entertain Reims at the Stade Louis II. The principality club won 3-1 away to Bastia last weekend and have lost just once in nine matches in all competitions. ""At the start of the season not everything was bad, just as today not everything is good. There is always room for progress in football,"" said coach Leonardo Jardim. Monaco, who will be without Layvin Kurzawa but welcome back midfield duo Joao Moutinho and Jeremy Toulalan, can leap provisionally into fourth place with a victory. Third-placed Lyon are unbeaten in seven games but travel to Nice on Saturday wary of the south-coast club's Brazilian star Carlos Eduardo, who netted five times in a stunning 7-2 success at Guingamp last weekend. Meanwhile, Lille entertain Saint-Etienne chasing a return to winning ways before travelling to face Everton in the Europa League. Fixtures (all kick-offs 1900 GMT unless stated)"
1065,25/10/2014,22:47,Classy PSG make Bordeaux pay penalty,Two penalties by Lucas Moura and a clever chip by Ezequiel Lavezzi helped champions Paris Saint Germain beat Bordeaux 3-0 in Ligue 1 on Saturday and put pressure on leaders Marseille.,"Resurgent Marseille have 25 points ahead of their game on Sunday at Lyon, where they can clinch a club record 10th straight league win. PSG are second with 21 having played a game more. In later matches, eight-times former champions Nantes, back in the top flight since last year, climbed to third on 19 points after their 1-1 home draw with Reims. And last season's runners-up Monaco beat Bastia 3-1 away to climb to sixth on 17 points despite a long injury list. Bordeaux coach Willy Sagnol had promised to take the game to the champions and his outfit went into the game level on points with the Parisians. But with Brazilian international centre-back pair Thiago Silva and David Luiz holding firm, Paris always looked superior in that part of the pitch. With Edinson Cavani suspended and Zlatan Ibrahimovic injured, PSG coach Laurent Blanc started with a makeshift front three of Javier Pastore, Lucas and speedy youngster Jean-Christophe Bahebeck. Bordeaux had reason for early cheer on 27 minutes when Gregory van Der Wiel delivered a wild studs-up kick to Wahbi Khazri's heel with the ball gone and the referee right behind him. He was sent off, but the numerical advantage would last a mere ten minutes. Andre Poko's complete miss as he swung at a stray ball would have been comical if the Bordeaux midfielder hadn't ended up connecting with Marco Verratti's knee, and while he was unfortunate, he had to walk too. Sagnol was furious with the red card decision against Poko. ""If that was a red card then maybe (instead of playing football) we should dance or do figure skating. The referee had the red card out before Veratti even hit the deck,"" he complained. Blanc agreed with Sagnol suggesting neither foul had been worth a straight red. ""The sending off motivated the team, but I'd have liked to see 11 against 11. There is such a thing as a yellow card, and both players who were fouled were able to play on. This is a contact sport,"" he explained. With Bordeaux deflated PSG went on the offensive. From the ensuing free-kick Luiz was already turning to celebrate a goal but saw his thunderous shot come back off the post with the wall and 'keeper well beaten. PSG then spurned a series of chances before Verratti was brought down in the area as the pressure mounted. With Ibrahimovic and Cavani absent penalty duty fell to Lucas, who stepped up in his pink boots and sent Stephane Carrasso the wrong way, his spot-kick ripping into the opposite corner. Five minutes into the second-half Lucas himself was brought down as he beat the offside trap and PSG were awarded another penalty. The Brazilian coolly planted his second spot-kick in the other corner, Carrasso diving the right way but unable to deal with the venom of the shot. Lavezzi, who was returning after being out injured for a month, completed the scoring nine minutes from time when his close-range chip took a deflection off defender Maxime Poundje on its way into the net. Elsewhere Caen notched up their first home points after four straight defeats in their own stadium with a 2-1 win over Lorient, and Reims scored a last minute goal to beat Montpellier 1-0."
1066,24/10/2014,02:15,Marseille chase new record as PSG tackle Bordeaux,Ligue 1 leaders Marseille chase a club record ninth consecutive victory on Sunday when they travel to Lyon while defending champions Paris Saint-Germain are in action at home to Bordeaux 24 hours earlier.,"Marcelo Bielsa's new look Marseille side have been the talk of French football after a blistering start to their campaign and the question is now whether they can protect a seven point advantage and go all the way to a tenth league title. PSG are their closest rivals and remain the only unbeaten side in the division but six draws in ten matches has seen them lose ground on Bielsa's men, who are shaping up as serious title contenders. OM striker Andre-Pierre Gignac has been the star man with ten goals in as many matches, including one in their most recent 2-0 victory over Toulouse at the Velodrome, a streak that also earned the 28-year-old a recall to the France team. Few would have bet against Laurent Blanc's two-time defending champions going on to win a third crown but Marseille appear to be the real deal after Argentine Bielsa came in at the beginning of the season and revamped their style of play. The capital club know that if the gap is not reduced this weekend, the importance on the clash between the two sides at the Parc des Princes on November 9 will take on increased significance. They will also be without key striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic who is still struggling with a heel injury. Marseille have won eight matches in a row on two occasions, back in 1937 and 1998, but it was Lyon who snapped their streak last time out. And the fourth-placed hosts at the Stade Gerland are themselves unbeaten in six and coming off a 5-1 thrashing of Montpellier last Sunday. Third-placed Bordeaux come into their clash level on points with PSG but low on confidence after a 1-1 home draw against lowly Caen last Sunday. ""We know how good Paris are and we know their players,"" said Bordeaux coach Willy Sagnol, who is in his first season in charge of a top flight club. ""The advantage about going to Paris is that we have nothing to lose and everything to win. I want the players to take risks to go for victory in Paris because we don't have a team to defend,"" added the former international full-back. ""We'll be looking to get a result with open play and grab some goals but we've got to raise our level and it's going to be a packed stadium. We are playing a team with an international stature but I prefer to concede five goals by at least trying to take the game to them."" concluded Sagnol. Should Marseille triumph in Lyon and set a new record for victories, they would be two short of Bordeaux's single-season record of 11 achieved on the way to the 2009 Ligue 1 crown, under Blanc, while the Girodins also have the overall record for wins at 14, chalked up between March and August 2009. In other matches, fifth-placed Saint-Etienne return from Europa League duty at Inter Milan and host Metz on Sunday while a busy Saturday slate features Bastia at home to Monaco, Lorient at Caen, Reims take on Montpellier in the Champagne region and sixth-placed Nantes are on the road at Evian. Sunday's early match takes place at Rennes when Lille are in Brittany while Nice travel to Guingamp. The weekend programme begins Friday with Toulouse hosting rock-bottom Lens.

1067,21/10/2014,23:04,Cavani rescues PSG with late winner in Cyprus,Edinson Cavani rescued Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday as his solo strike with three minutes remaining was enough to defeat APOEL Nicosia 1-0 after the Cypriots dominated for large periods of the match.,"The Uruguayan marksman claimed his second goal in PSG's Champions League Group F campaign and his sixth of the season when he latched onto a loose ball in the box and, despite falling to the ground, was able to hook it home with his right boot for a victory that rarely looked on the cards. APOEL will consider themselves unlucky not to have claimed at least a draw and should have taken the lead on several occasions in a match that slipped from their grasp and puts their qualification chances in jeopardy. PSG remain top of the section with seven points, a point clear of Barcelona, who beat Ajax 3-1 at the Camp Nou on Tuesday, while APOEL prop up the group with just one point. The Cypriot champions, who became the first team from the island to reach the quarter-finals of Europe's biggest club competition in 2012, outworked and outmuscled their more illustrious visitors in a tight game of few chances. On a night when PSG coach Laurent Blanc was able to field his captain Thiago Silva in the centre of defence after nine weeks on the sidelines, it was Silva's Brazilian compatriot David Luiz who cleared off the line twice in a second half largely controlled by APOEL. The closest the match came to a goal until Cavani's strike was in the 56th minute when a glancing header from Tiago Gomes beat PSG 'keeper Salvatore Sirugu but was miraculously headed off the line by David Luiz. Minutes later the former Chelsea player scrambled the ball clear when Sirigu was again left wanting and at full-time Blanc could feel very lucky to be returning to the French capital with three points. Twenty-one first-half goals flew in during the opening 45 minutes of the other seven matches taking place on Tuesday but there was no threat of a breakthrough in the Cypriot capital as the game proved a slow burner. The best first-half chance fell to APOEL's lanky Irish centre-forward Cillian Sheridan in just the second minute, as he clipped a volley towards the bottom corner only to be stopped by the reflexes of Sirigu who dived to his right and tipped the ball behind. PSG looked the more polished side on the ball and dominated possession but the hosts set up a resilient defensive wall that the visitors failed to breach. Marshalled by Brazilian veteran Carlao, who spent six seasons in Ligue 1 with Sochaux, APOEL dealt comfortably with Cavani while Javier Pastore and Lucas on the flanks were also stifled. After the break, APOEL, whose 1-0 loss at Barcelona last month was their only defeat this season coming into this game, went on the attack and took the game to PSG before Cavani popped up with three minutes left to snatch the points."
1068,20/10/2014,20:50,Blanc confident PSG will rise to the occasion,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc said on Monday his French champions need to stay focussed if they are to subdue Cypriot opponents APOEL Nicosia in Champions League action on Tuesday.,"Blanc's expensively assembled squad, who will be without last season's top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic for the trip to Cyprus due to injury, have reached the quarter-finals the past two seasons and are now top of Group F after two matches with four points. Barcelona, who lost 3-2 against PSG at the Parc des Princes on matchday two, are second on three points, with Ajax a further point back and APOEL on one. Ajax, play Barcelona on Tuesday at the Nou Camp, before the away teams host the same opposition in the fourth round of fixtures on November 5. ""They are a club who are used to European matches, and have some players like Carlao -- a Brazilian defender who spent six seasons with Sochaux -- who know the French championship well,"" said Blanc, formerly Bordeaux and France coach. ""When I saw their two Champions League matches this season, especially at home against Ajax (1-1), I realised they are definitely a team to be taken seriously,"" ""If we do not have maximum concentration, we will have enormous difficulties and we have to be as determined as we were in Amsterdam (1-1) and against Barcelona (3-2)."" PSG, who were knocked out by Barcelona in the last eight in 2013, on away goals, and suffered a similar fate against Chelsea at the same stage earlier this year, will face an APOEL side more than capable of making life difficult for their visitors. ""We need to impose our game because they are a team who defend very well with two lines of four players and they are not afraid to defend deep,"" said Blanc. ""They're very disciplined and very brave and the time that they do have the ball, they can put the opposition in difficulty because they are very dangerous on the counter-attack,"" added Blanc, who has lifted the team into second in Ligue 1, seven points behind Marseille after a stuttering start to the season. The 48-year-old says his players also find it easier to get themselves motivated for big European matches rather than the routine of domestic duty. ""It's not only the players (who find more motivation), but you the journalists, I'm sure you are more motivated and professional when you conduct an interview with someone important rather than someone unknown,"" said Blanc. ""When I said that players are more motivated for the Champions League, it is because it is a major objective for the club and there is a lot of pressure in this competition. ""It does not mean that the players are not motivated for league matches but unconsiously there is a better concentration in C1 (Champions League). ""There are only those who haven't played the Champions League who don't understand that. When you hear that famous music (Champions League theme before matches), it really stirs something up inside you,"" added Blanc."
1069,17/10/2014,22:44,PSG go second after subduing nine-man Lens,Ten-man Paris Saint-Germain won a stormy encounter at the Stade de France on Friday as they overcame nine-man Lens 3-1 to move within four points of Ligue 1 leaders Marseille.,"Despite taking an early lead through Adamo Coulibaly, Lens self-destructed as they conceded three goals in 27 minutes and had two players sent off in front of a packed house at the national stadium, just outside of Paris. PSG had Edinson Cavani red-carded. Yohan Cabaye, Brazilian Maxwell and under-fire Uruguayan Cavani, from the penalty spot, did the damage for Laurent Blanc's side as they went second in the table, one point ahead of Bordeaux. Marseille can extend their advantage when they host Toulouse on Sunday while Bordeaux await fourth-from-bottom Normandy club Caen later the same day. Lens remain third from bottom with just eight points from 10 matches. ""The match was a bit bizarre,"" said PSG 'keeper Salvatore Sirigu. ""We started well and then conceded a goal but we had the force to bounce back and the desire to win and that will make us stronger. ""Things are a bit complicated at the moment with all our injuries but we're working to return to full strength,"" added the Italian. Lens took the lead against the run of play with only 10 minutes gone when 33-year-old Coulibaly intercepted a loose ball just inside the PSG half and raced towards goal. An angled shot from the left of the box took a telling deflection off the unfortunate stand-in captain Thiago Motta and beat Sirigu at the far post to put Lens in front. PSG, despite playing in Paris and without injured talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic, were the away side, and struck back decisively with two goals in six minutes that swung the match back in their favour. Former Newcastle favourite Cabaye took advantage of a rare chance to be included in the starting eleven, as he pounced on a loose ball 25 yards from goal and drove home the equaliser that Rudy Riou failed to keep out on 28 minutes. Six minutes later, the Lens 'keeper was badly at fault as a miscued clearance fell to defender Maxwell 35 yards from goal and his instinctive shot towards goal looped over the defence and Riou and into the goal which handed the initiative back to Blanc's men. Lens coach Antoine Kombouare, who was in charge at PSG between 2009 and 2011 and is a former player with the capital club, then saw his side's fortunes take a decisive turn for the worse eight minutes into the second half when Jean-Philippe Gbamin gave away a penalty and was sent-off in the process. Although he made light contact with Cavani who was in a goal-scoring position, a penalty and subsequent red card was harsh on the promoted northerners. Cavani, who has come in for sustained criticism in the French press over his lack of fire-power in front of goal, converted the penalty before being comically sent off during his celebrations. Firstly handed a yellow for a harmless gesture towards the crowd, he then grabbed the referee's arm in protest which prompted a straight red from the harassed official Nicolas Rainville. ""I don't know why Cavani was sent-off, players should be allowed to ask for an explanation and it was done in a polite way but it's just not possible that this can happen. It's a shame for the fans and the spectacle,"" continued Sirigu. Moments later, Jerome Le Moigne was given his marching orders for Lens for a second bookable offence as the home side went down to nine men and they never recovered. PSG can now look forward to their next Champions League fixture on Tuesday when they travel to Cyprus and a key match against APOEL Nicosia."
1070,16/10/2014,17:24,"Thiago Silva fit but Ibra and Luiz out, says Blanc","Thiago Silva is fit to play for Paris Saint-Germain against Lens on Friday, but Zlatan Ibrahimovic and David Luiz will both miss out, coach Laurent Blanc said on Thursday.","Silva played in the opening-day draw at Reims in August, but then suffered a hamstring injury in a friendly against Napoli three days later that has kept him out ever since. However, Ibrahimovic is still suffering from a heel problem while David Luiz picked up a thigh complaint while playing for Brazil against Argentina in a friendly in Beijing over the international break. ""David Luiz is injured, he won't play against Lens, Zlatan Ibrahimovic is out for Lens, as are Ezequiel Lavezzi and Marquinhos,"" said Blanc. ""Thiago Silva is fit but it remains to be seen if he will be in the squad, on the bench or in the starting line-up."" Speaking about Ibrahimovic's heel problem, Blanc added: ""It's improving but not enough to be in the squad. ""I hope it won't last long but as for a return date or day, I couldn't say."" The continued absence of Ibrahimovic means Edinson Cavani will again lead the attack for the defending champions, and Blanc is confident the misfiring striker will soon return to form after a poor start to the season. ""Edinson felt that he was not in the best form of his career and has buried himself in his work over the last 10 days and I have to say he has been exceptional in that regard,"" said Blanc. ""He needed to recover certain sensations. I am waiting impatiently for him to confirm that in a game situation, but I am very pleased with the work he has done."" Cavani has scored four times in 12 games in all competitions this season but looked horribly off colour in front of goal in the 3-2 Champions League win over Barcelona and the 1-1 draw with Monaco just before the recent international break. Friday's match against a Lens side in the relegation zone will be played at the Stade de France, the national stadium just outside Paris, but Blanc is unimpressed with the state of the pitch. ""The Stade de France pitch is a disaster, although it's never been good,"" he said. Lens are unable to play at their own stadium this season as it undergoes refurbishment work ahead of Euro 2016, so all their home fixtures so far have been played 80 kilometres away in Amiens. However, Friday's match is the first of three they will host at the Stade de France."

1073,05/10/2014,23:10,Monaco's Martial law holds PSG,"Anthony Martial scored an injury time equaliser for Monaco as a tired looking and injury stricken Paris Saint-Germain were held 1-1 at the Parc des Princes Sunday, their sixth draw in nine French league games.","Paris had been playing out the game after a Lucas Moura 70th-minute strike looked liked giving the capital side a much needed win. But Brazil defender David Luiz lamely tapped the ball into Martial's path deep into injury time and the 18-year-old made no mistake. Runaway leaders Marseille now have 22 points after their seventh straight win Saturday, 2-1 away at Caen, Bordeaux, who lost 1-0 at Reims, have 17 points while PSG, Lille and Nantes are all on 15. The game had seemed set for a 0-0 deadlock with PSG drained from a thrilling 3-2 win over Barcelona in the Champions League midweek and Monaco having earned a hard-fought draw at Zenit St Petersburg also jaded. But an unmarked Moura side-footed home unmarked from the edge of the six-yard box in the 70th minute after fine work from man-of-the-match, Argentine midfielder Javier Pastore. The first half was uneventful until Maxwell's cross on 37 minutes went begging as a sluggish Edinson Cavani arrived slightly late for a simple nod in. PSG were left to thank Salvatore Sirigu's reflexes after he then finger-tipped a Yannick Ferreira Carrasco snap-shot onto the crossbar on 43 minutes to hold the score to 0-0 at half-time. Veteran Zoumana Camara and Luiz were kept busy, but were never panicked by the Monaco forward line. Pastore put Cavani in just before the hour with a deft through ball only to see the Uruguayan run through with perfect timing and miss the ball completely. Defender Andrea Raggi thought he's scored a few moments later but Gregory Van Der Weil appeared from nowhere to clear off the line with Sirugu on the floor. Earlier Sunday Lyon cruised to a 3-0 victory over Lille at their Stade Gerland thanks to a hat-trick from France international striker Alexandre Lacazette. Lille had to play without eight first choice players and also had their coach Rene Girard sent off for the second time this season. They have now lost twice and drawn one of their last three league games. For Lyon, former France player of the year Yoann Gourcuff finally got a place in the starting line-up as his form comes back and he set up the first goal for Lacazette in the 39th minute. The 23-year-old striker with three France caps took his league tally to seven with another strike just on half-time and his hat-trick put the gloss on a fine days work when he wrapped up victory with six minutes to play. Saint-Etienne could have climbed to second place above Bordeaux with a home win but lost 1-0 at home to Toulouse thanks to Wissam Ben Yedder's sixth Ligue 1 goal this season. Saint Etienne have suffered two defeats and a draw in their last three league outings. Also Sunday Nantes teenager Georges-Kévin Nkoudou grabbed the winner that took the Canaries up to fifth after edging Guingamp 1-0 in the Brittany derby."
1074,03/10/2014,02:15,Monaco next up for PSG after Barcelona triumph,"A meeting of Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco might not carry the same allure that it did just a few months ago, but for Laurent Blanc's side it is a chance to really kick-start their domestic campaign.","PSG come into Sunday's encounter at the Parc des Princes fresh from an exhilarating 3-2 victory over Barcelona in the Champions League in midweek, a result that Blanc admitted was possibly his best since being appointed as coach last year. ""I will remember this win, as will the players and all those who were at the stadium. We do this job to live nights like these,"" he said. ""We hope this really launches our season. It can serve as a reference point for us to build from."" The champions are still unbeaten this season, but have drawn five of their eight Ligue 1 games so far and come into October five points behind leaders Marseille. They also have injury problems -- top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic has missed the last three matches with a heel complaint and the Swede faces a race against time to be fit to face Monaco. Captain Thiago Silva and Ezequiel Lavezzi are still out and Blanc admitted that Marquinhos struggled through to the end of the Barcelona clash with a similar problem. ""Marquinhos felt pain in his thigh and played the whole second half with that pain,"" he said. However, Monaco are themselves worrying about the fitness of Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov, who has an injured ankle. The principality club have unsurprisingly toiled since seeing star duo James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao depart without being replaced. That means that a fixture that was so eagerly anticipated last season is perhaps no longer the biggest showdown in the French game, but there is still no shortage of intrigue. If PSG are unhappy at being in fourth place, Leonardo Jardim's side languish in 12th and were beaten 1-0 at home by local rivals Nice last week. However, they did boost morale with an excellent draw at Zenit St Petersburg in the Champions League on Wednesday and now Jardim is hoping they can reproduce their European form in Ligue 1. ""It's easier for the manager to motivate the players in the Champions League,"" he acknowledged after the draw in Russia. ""The team played well, had a good 90 minutes with lots of quality and intensity. I think the team can play like this in the domestic league too."" Paris could be even further off the pace at the top by the time they kick off on Sunday, with leaders Marseille chasing a seventh consecutive win when they go to Caen a day earlier. Marcelo Bielsa has already transformed a side that failed to qualify for Europe last season and are now being tipped by some observers as genuine title contenders. Dimitri Payet, who scored in last weekend's 2-1 defeat of Saint-Etienne, is a doubt for the visit to Normandy because of an ankle knock, but Bielsa believes complacency could be his side's biggest enemy. ""One of the most important qualities that a footballer must have is knowing to capitalise on the effects of a favourable run of results,"" said Bielsa. ""Sometimes it generates more confidence or allows a player's qualities to shine through more easily, but sometimes the players start to think things will continue in the same way without them putting in the effort."" Bordeaux, who are two points behind OM in second, can go provisionally top with a win at struggling Reims on Friday. On Sunday, Lyon, who are unbeaten in four, can move to within a point of third-placed Lille by beating the northern side at the Stade de Gerland. Saint-Etienne entertain Toulouse on Sunday while Metz, who are fifth, go to an Evian side in the bottom three. Fixtures (kick-offs 1800GMT unless stated)"
1075,30/09/2014,22:45,PSG edge Barcelona in five-goal thriller,Paris Saint-Germain overcame the absence of their injured talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic to beat Barcelona 3-2 in a thrilling Champions League Group F encounter at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.,"The Catalans, who had not even conceded a goal all season in seven matches before this one, fell behind inside 10 minutes when David Luiz prodded in his first PSG goal. Barcelona needed just two minutes to draw level thanks to a marvellous Lionel Messi strike, but Marco Verratti headed the hosts back in front after 26 minutes and Blaise Matuidi added another in the 54th minute. Neymar reduced the deficit, yet Paris held on for their first win in the group after a 1-1 draw at Ajax two weeks ago, while Barca failed to build on a narrow 1-0 win over APOEL of Cyprus in their first outing. Barcelona arrived in France in fine form but this was billed as their biggest test since the arrival of Luis Enrique as coach in the summer, even if their hosts were denied the services of Ezequiel Lavezzi and captain Thiago Silva as well as the prolific Ibrahimovic. Edinson Cavani spearheaded their attack, while Barcelona again had Marc-Andre ter Stegen in goal in Europe rather than La Liga regular Claudio Bravo. But their previously watertight defence looked rather fragile against a PSG side who started with all guns blazing and were soon rewarded. Daniel Alves gave away a free-kick for stopping a Paris attack with his hand, and the home side opened the scoring from the resulting delivery, Luiz controlling Lucas's ball in from the left before turning and poking the ball into the far corner from eight yards. Barcelona's defence had finally been breached for the first time this season after 640 minutes, but their response was immediate. Indeed, the celebrations were still ongoing when the Catalans drew level thanks to a moment of trademark brilliance, Messi exchanging lightning-quick first-time passes with Andres Iniesta and Neymar before giving Salvatore Sirigu in goal no chance with a left-foot strike into the far corner. It was the Argentine's 68th Champions League goal, putting him level with his great rival Cristiano Ronaldo in the all-time standings and to within three of the competition's all-time leading scorer, Raul. However, PSG were not deterred, and while Neymar lifted the ball just over the bar following a lofted pass into the box by Messi, the home side regained the advantage in the 26th minute. Again the goal came from a set-piece, and this time Barcelona's defence looked especially unsure of themselves, ter Stegen flapping at a Thiago Motta right-wing corner and Ivan Rakitic allowing Verratti, the smallest player in the PSG side, to head into the net at the far post to score his first goal for the club. Barcelona trailed despite having almost 60 percent of the possession in the first half, with Messi curling a free-kick just over the bar a minute prior to the break. PSG were simply the more clinical of the two teams and extended their advantage nine minutes after the restart, a Gregory van der Wiel cross from near the right corner flag flashing all the way across the penalty box for Matuidi - who scored in the last meeting of the clubs here 18 months ago - to convert. Again Barcelona needed just two minutes to muster a response, Neymar getting his seventh of the season with a delightful control and calm side-footed finish into the net off the right-hand post. They then camped around the penalty box as they went in search of a leveller, but Marquinhos produced a crucial flying block to prevent Jordi Alba from equalising before substitute Munir El Haddadi fizzed in a shot that grazed the outside of the right post and went wide."
1076,29/09/2014,19:09,PSG without Ibrahimovic against Barcelona,"Paris Saint-Germain star Zlatan Ibrahimovic will miss Tuesday's Champions League clash with Barcelona at the Parc des Princes due to a nagging heel problem, the French club have confirmed.","""As the different tests carried out this morning on the problem with his left heel were not satisfactory, Zlatan Ibrahimovic is out of the match against Barcelona,"" said a statement released by PSG on Monday. Ibrahimovic, who played for Barcelona in the 2009-10 season, had already missed his club's last two games in Ligue 1. Without him, Laurent Blanc's side performed poorly in a 1-1 draw at Toulouse on Saturday and they are under pressure to get a result against the Catalans after opening their Group F campaign with a 1-1 draw with Ajax in Amsterdam two weeks ago. Ibrahimovic is joined on the sidelines by captain and centre-back Thiago Silva, who has not played since early August because of a thigh injury, and Argentine forward Ezequiel Lavezzi, who has a hamstring problem. However, Blanc said that he was not surprised at the news his Swedish talisman would miss the encounter and remains hopeful his side can get a result in his absence. ""This morning he was having treatment but in truth I had already started to prepare for this game knowing that he probably wouldn't be there,"" Blanc told a press conference at the Parc des Princes on Monday afternoon. ""It certainly won't be easy, we know that. Last year we played difficult games without Ibra. ""We have other attacking players of great quality and we will need to compensate for his absence by producing an even better team performance."" Blanc added that Ibrahimovic faces a race against time to be ready in time for next Sunday's home meeting with Monaco, PSG's final outing before the October international break. ""We will see how it evolves, but obviously the medical staff are doing all they can to get him ready,"" he said. Last season, Paris beat Chelsea 3-1 in the first leg of their quarter-final tie but Ibrahimovic picked up an injury in that game and missed the return, which Chelsea won 2-0 to advance on away goals. Barcelona's French defender Jeremy Mathieu admitted that the absence of Ibrahimovic was good news for the away side. ""It is an advantage for us. He has a massive influence on their game and makes the difference in practically every match,"" said Mathieu."
1077,29/09/2014,16:35,Blanc puts faith in PSG philosophy for Barca clash,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc says there is no question of his side giving up their footballing philosophy in Tuesday's Champions League Group F encounter with Barcelona.,"Blanc's team won many plaudits for their attractive brand of possession football last season as they romped to the Ligue 1 title and reached the Champions League quarter-finals for the second season running, losing on away goals to Chelsea. But putting the emphasis on keeping possession means they will be taking on Barcelona -- the masters at the art of keeping the ball -- at their own game, and the PSG coach believes that is a risk worth taking. ""In my view we need to prepare to play the way the players are used to playing. If we start doing things that we are not used to, that is when we will put ourselves in danger,"" said Blanc at a press conference on the eve of the match at the Parc des Princes. A style of football that produced spectacular results at times last season has not prevented Paris from enduring a sluggish start to this campaign. The French champions are yet to lose but three draws in their last four Ligue 1 games have left them five points behind leaders Marseille while a 1-1 draw at Ajax two weeks ago means there is added pressure on them to get a result on Tuesday. But their way of playing is one that the former France defender has advocated since spending a season on the books at the Camp Nou in 1996-97 alongside the likes of former coach Pep Guardiola and current Barca coach Luis Enrique, and now Blanc is ready to take them on at their own game. ""Barcelona have always been one of my favourite teams, above all for their style of play,"" he said. ""I know some people like them and others don't, but they always play good football and score goals. ""I only played there for one year but I was very proud to wear their colours. But I have prepared a PSG team to beat Barcelona. We need to have that mentality. ""I think Paris Saint-Germain will rediscover their level and performances of last season by playing football, sticking to the philosophy we used last year. ""You can see where Barcelona have got by sticking to a system for 40 years. It will be an extraordinary game. We will put in a great performance tomorrow if we stick to our philosophy but add a bit more agression, especially when we don't have the ball. ""And that is all the more important because we know that Barca, when they have the ball, are very difficult to stop."" Blanc is also confident his side will create chances against opponents who are yet to concede a single goal in seven matches in all competitions this season, including a 1-0 victory over APOEL of Cyprus on matchday one and a 6-0 trouncing of Granada in La Liga at the weekend. ""I've seen all Barca's games this season and in every match their opponents have had chances,"" he said, with Edinson Cavani charged with the task of leading the attack in the absence of former Barca star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who has a heel problem. Brazilian full-back Maxwell, another member of the PSG squad to have enjoyed a spell at the Camp Nou, insisted that his old team's run without conceding cannot last much longer. ""They have got back their intensity at winning the ball back,"" he said. ""It is the philosophy that Guardiola had too. But it's not impossible (to score against them). Some day they need to concede and I hope it will be tomorrow."""

1079,29/09/2014,02:15,New-look Barcelona ready for first big test in Paris,Barcelona face their first big test of the Luis Enrique era when they face Paris Saint-Germain in the French capital in the Champions League on Tuesday.,"The Catalans looked sluggish in the 1-0 win against APOEL that kicked-off their Group F campaign a fortnight ago, but they travel to France having won six and drawn one of seven matches altogether this season, and are yet to concede a single goal under their new coach. Their performance in tearing apart Granada in La Liga on Saturday, when Neymar scored a hat-trick and Lionel Messi netted twice in a 6-0 victory, would have made for ominous viewing for anyone with PSG connections. ""At the moment I don't see any player who isn't capable of putting in a good performance in Paris and that for me is an advantage,"" said Luis Enrique, who welcomes Gerard Pique and Jordi Alba back into his squad for the match at the Parc des Princes after both were rested against Granada. That duo are both almost certain to start in a meeting of the two favourites to progress to the last 16 from the section, while there is no question of Messi, who is the only player to have started all seven games for Barca this season, being rested yet. ""I prefer to see him on the pitch until the last minute to press and participate in our collective play,"" added the coach. ""The temptation is there, it could happen at any point in the season, but his habitat is on the field."" The biggest doubt surrounds who will start in goal, with Claudio Bravo having kept a clean sheet in all six domestic games so far while fellow summer recruit Marc-Andre ter Stegen was preferred against APOEL. Either way, the newly watertight Barcelona defence will expect to endure a tough evening in the first meeting of the clubs since the quarter-final clash in April 2013, when Paris came away with a draw in both legs but were eliminated on away goals. Since then, Carlo Ancelotti has been replaced in the PSG dugout by Laurent Blanc, who played alongside Luis Enrique at the Camp Nou for a season in the 1990s. PSG, like their opponents, are still unbeaten in the current campaign but all the pressure on Tuesday will be on Blanc, whose side are yet to convince this season and yet will be expected to take the game to Barca in front of their own fans. Paris may already be a European superpower in financial terms but now they crave real success on the continent after being eliminated from the Champions League at the quarter-final stage in each of the last two seasons. Meanwhile, a lack of motivation for the less glamorous challenges in store in Ligue 1 has been suggested by some as the reason for their sluggish recent displays, but a run of four draws in their last five matches includes a 1-1 stalemate at Ajax in their Group F opener. On Saturday, Blanc rotated his squad and tried out a new formation against Toulouse but was only rewarded with another 1-1 stalemate. ""We are aware that last season we dominated the league and this year, with the same team and the same coach, we are not winning matches so easily,"" admitted Blanc, who played down talk that his side might now be fearing the prospect of facing Barcelona. ""Do we need to be worried because we didn't win? If we had won, we would maybe be more confident. Barcelona are a great team. Everyone knows that. ""Barcelona is a different competition, and even if we are having difficulty and certain things worry me, the spirit is good. The players are putting in a lot of effort, perhaps more than last season when they were winning matches 3-0 or 4-0."" The home side are not helped, however, by fitness problems to key players, with Ezequiel Lavezzi joining captain Thiago Silva on the sidelines. In addition, former Barcelona striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, PSG's talisman, has missed the last two games with a heel problem and is a doubt."
1080,27/09/2014,19:23,Stumbling PSG drop points again,"Paris Saint-Germain were held to a 1-1 draw at Toulouse in Ligue 1 on Saturday, once again failing to convince as a Champions League clash with Barcelona looms on the horizon.","Laurent Blanc's reigning champions remain unbeaten this season, but they had to come from behind to claim a fourth draw in their last five matches in all competitions, Jean-Christophe Bahebeck cancelling out Wissam Ben Yedder's opener. The result ended PSG's run of 10 successive wins over Toulouse and left them two points adrift of Ligue 1 leaders Marseille, who could increase that advantage if they record a sixth consecutive win when they host Saint-Etienne on Sunday evening. Paris were again without Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who sat out a second game in a row with a nagging heel injury, and Blanc made half a dozen changes to the team that had won 2-0 at Caen in midweek. One of those changes saw Serge Aurier return to the starting line-up against the club he left on loan in the summer, and the Ivorian defender was at fault as the hosts took the lead with just eight minutes played. When he was short with a pass back towards Salvatore Sirigu, the lively Ben Yedder pounced in between the goalkeeper and David Luiz before converting from a tight angle. It was the little striker's ninth goal in his last 11 Ligue 1 games, and Toulouse should have gone on to increase their lead soon after. However, Aleksandar Pesic somehow contrived to miss with the goal gaping after Sirigu had beaten out a Pavle Ninkov shot. PSG recovered to draw level just after the half-hour mark when Marco Verratti found Bahebeck with a quickly-taken free-kick over the home defence, and the forward slotted past Zacharie Boucher to score his first Ligue 1 goal for the club. However, the visitors rarely really looked like winning the game and the performance raises further doubts as to their prospects in Europe before Barcelona come to the Parc des Princes on Tuesday. Earlier, France's other Champions League group stage representative Monaco suffered a fourth loss in just eight league games this season. The principality club, who had won their last three games in all competitions, were beaten 1-0 at home by Nice in the Cote d'Azur derby, with Brazilian midfielder Carlos Eduardo scoring the only goal from an early free-kick. Leonardo Jardim's side, who go to Russia to play Zenit St Petersburg in midweek, continue to languish in the bottom half of the table. There are four games later on Saturday, including Lille at home to SC Bastia, while Bordeaux host Rennes and in-form Lyon go to Nantes on Sunday."
1081,26/09/2014,09:29,PSG seeking boost in Toulouse before Barcelona clash,What a difference a win makes. Paris Saint Germain's 2-0 win away at Caen in midweek not only broke a sequence of three draws but lifted them to second in the table and temporarily silenced the critics.,"With a tantalising Champions League tie against Barcelona coming up at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday, the French champions are on their travels again on Saturday, at Toulouse. And victory could put them level on points with early season leaders Marseille, although that could all change on Sunday when the leaders are in action at home to high-flying Saint Etienne. Earlier in the week, PSG coach Laurent Blanc admitted his side had been having ""a bit of a hard time"", but victory at Caen steadied the nerves and provided a morale-boost ahead of the visit of Barcelona. Toulouse currently occupy 10th place, right in the middle of the table after a 3-0 win over Rennes in midweek, but can always be expected to put up a fight against the league's big boys. As coach Alain Casanova said on Thursday: ""We know only too well that they're a lot better than we are, but over 90 minutes we're capable of getting a result. ""A football match is never a foregone conclusion, we have to draw on all out talents, it's as simple as that."" PSG will again be without talisman striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, which gives Casanova further reason for optimism. ""Ibrahimovic is the best player in this league, in fact, he's one of the four best players in the world, along with (Cristiano) Ronaldo, (Lionel) Messi and Neymar, and on top of that he has a nasty habit of scoring against us (five goals in three matches), so it's better we haven't got to face him,"" Casanova grinned. However, Paris' strength in depth showed as the Brazilian midfield pair of Lucas and Marquinhos scored the goals which saw off Caen, even if Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani was largely shackled by the home defence. The win, their first since early August and first away from home this season, put PSG three points behind leaders and bitter rivals Marseille in the Ligue 1 table. For their part, Toulouse will rely on the goalscoring prowess of in-form striker Wissam Ben Yedder, leading scorer for the past two seasons, who became the club's 10th most prolific striker of all-time with his 35th goal for the club in last week's 3-3 draw with Caen. PSG are still unbeaten this season, but they drew with Ajax in Amsterdam in thir first Champions League group game. That places added importance on the meeting with Barcelona - but first they have to negotiate the trip to Toulouse. ""Our level of play isn't of the same brilliance as last year, but we are getting closer to it, little by little,"" said PSG coach Laurent Blanc. ""Physically we are not at the top, but we dug in a little more in the second half than in the first. We still made chances."" Sunday sees a top-of-the-table clash as third-placed Saint Etienne travel to Marseille."
1082,25/09/2014,22:45,UEFA opens financial probes against seven clubs,"UEFA announced on Thursday that it had opened probes against Monaco, Roma, Besiktas, Inter Milan, Liverpool and Russian club Krasnodar for suspected breaches of financial fair play rules.","In a statement, European football's governing body said that the seven clubs' accounts for 2012 and 2013 had shown a ""break-even deficit"". As a result, UEFA said that its Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) investigatory chamber had decided to launch formal investigations. ""These clubs will need to submit additional monitoring information during October and November upon the deadlines set by the CFCB, subsequent to which an additional communication will be made and conservatory measures may be imposed,"" it said. The principle of financial ""fair play"" is to prevent clubs accruing losses in excess of a 45-million-euro limit over the course of two seasons. The goal is to stop clubs from trying to buy success by concerning the transfer market while also racking up huge debts that could threaten the health of the game. UEFA sanctions for wrongdoers include withholding prize money from European competitions. On Thursday, UEFA said that the CFCB had decided to withhold prize money from five clubs involved in this season's European competitions due to ""important overdue payables"" to other clubs, employees or their national tax authorities. The five clubs were Turkey's Bursaspor, Romanian teams Cluj and Astra Giurgi, Montenegrin capital side Podgorica, and Lithuania's Ekranas. UEFA noted that the decision to withhold the prize money -- the amount of which was not revealed -- was a provisional move pending further investigation and would remain in force until December. Other penalties can include transfer-market restrictions and fines. Big-spending Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain were among nine clubs sanctioned last season for overspending on player transfers and wages and fined 60 million euros. ""Overall, and including the clubs already mentioned above and the nine clubs which have signed settlement agreements last season, 115 clubs will remain under monitoring,"" UEFA said. It said that the financial fair play rules had proven their mettles, with overdue sums decreasing from 57 million euros in June 2011 to eight million euros in the same month this year. In addition, aggregate losses reported by Europe's first-division clubs in the 2013 financial year have gone down to 800 million euros from a record-reported deficit of 1.7 billion euros in 2011, it said. Roma said they support the fair play initiative having overcome financial hurdles in recent years. ""Our current ownership took over a club in economic distress just three years ago and were very clear from the outset that our club would be run as a business in order to maximize economic success along with on-field performance,"" said a Roma statement. ""We are very proud of the economic and competitive accomplishments achieved in a very short time and are even more optimistic about our future. ""We look forward to a dialogue with UEFA and are confident they will recognize our accomplishments and consider us a model for future investment in European football."""
1083,25/09/2014,22:42,Rodgers relaxed about Financial Fair Play,"Liverpool are relaxed about reports they face an investigation into potential breaches of Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations by European governing body UEFA, manager Brendan Rodgers said on Thursday.","British media reports claim that Liverpool are one of several clubs under investigation, including Monaco, Inter Milan and Roma. Clubs that did not play in Europe last season have recently submitted their accounts to UEFA's scrutiny, but Rodgers is confident that Liverpool will not fall foul of the regulations. ""It's obviously something that will be dealt with by the directors,"" he said. ""It's something we're comfortable with because we're great advocates of Financial Fair Play. It's ongoing with the club."" Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain received heavy penalties last season for breaching FFP rules, which oblige clubs not to spend beyond their means. Rodgers also declared that he was unconcerned by media speculation linking in-form 19-year-old winger Raheem Sterling with interest from European champions Real Madrid. ""It shows that he's playing exceptionally well,"" Rodgers told a press conference. ""I think you could probably link Raheem with every club in the world at the moment. He's a fantastic young talent. ""I've nothing really to add to it. There's obviously lots of speculation every day about players coming and going here at Liverpool. He's a wonderful boy who's developing very, very well here. ""I think him and his representatives and the people close to him know how comfortable he is here and I'm sure at some point in the future, whatever contract we're looking to work with will be sorted, but he's still got three years left and there's no rush from my perspective."" Liverpool host Everton on Saturday in the season's first Merseyside derby and Rodgers revealed that striker Daniel Sturridge could be in line to make his comeback after a thigh injury. ""We've got a number of injuries that we're going to give every chance to,"" said the Northern Irishman. ""He's a player who's out on the field working. Him and a number of others we'll just assess nearer the time. But if he doesn't make it, he won't be far off after that."""
1084,24/09/2014,23:14,Brazilian duo steer PSG to second spot,"Brazilian duo Lucas and Marquinhos gave Paris Saint Germain a 2-0 win at Caen on Wednesday, ending a run of three successive draws and moving the champions into second spot.","The victory was also the perfect tonic ahead of next Tuesday's mouth-watering Champions League duel against Barcelona in Paris. The win, their first since early August and first away from home this season, put PSG three points behind leaders and bitter rivals Marseille in the Ligue 1 table. Despite missing star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic with a heel injury, PSG still had too much class for Caen. Lucas put them 1-0 up after 17 minutes, easily brushing off two defenders before firing home from 10 metres past Remy Vercoutre in the Caen goal. Fellow-Brazilian Marquinhos added the second 10 minutes into the second half when he headed in a corner from Jean-Christophe Bahebeck with the ball evading the desperate attempts of N'Golo Kante to clear. Lille slumped to their first Ligue 1 defeat of the season, a 1-0 loss at Nice shattering their hopes of moving into second place. It was Lille's first away setback since February when Nice also got the better of them, also by a single goal. On Wednesday, it was their former player Mathieu Bodmer who secured Nice's third home win of the season with a 41st minute header from a corner. Lille are fifth in the table, four points off the lead. Lyon, the seven-time champions, were the night's biggest winners with a 4-0 home win against Lorient. Nabil Fekir scored twice with Alexandre Lacazette and 21-year-old Clinton N'Jie also on target. Highly-rated Cameroon star N'Jie had earlier signed a new five-year deal with Hubert Fournier's side and marked the occasion in style with his first goal for the club. Monaco, last season's runners-up, recorded their third win in three games to shake off their early season slump which had seen them slip to bottom place. After a Champions League win over Leverkusen and a 1-0 win against Guingamp, Monaco needed a stoppage time winner from substitute Valere Germain to beat Montpellier. Monaco are now comfortably in mid-table with 10 points from seven games. ""We had to wait until injury time to score, but the win was deserved,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. ""Monaco were the better team in the first half and second half. We showed a lot of quality, controlled the match and had lots of chances. We were the justified winners of the match."" On Tuesday, Marseille picked up their fifth straight victory as top scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac claimed a brace in a 5-0 thrashing of Reims. Gignac could even afford the luxury of a missed eighth-minute penalty, before scoring two first-half goals while Ghana international Andre Ayew also struck twice at the Stade Auguste Delaune. The win took Marcelo Bielsa's side three points clear at the top although either Saint-Etienne or Bordeaux can draw level with victory when they meet on Thursday. ""It's very satisfying to get five wins in a row and we did it in style as well,"" said Gignac, who also scored twice in the 3-0 win over Rennes at the weekend. ""Obviously it's been a good day and now we can look forward to a big match against Saint-Etienne on Sunday."""
1085,16/09/2014,20:31,Blanc urges Paris to prove European credentials,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc has said the Ligue 1 champions must prove they have what it takes to go all the way in the Champions League ahead of their clash with Ajax on Wednesday.,"Knocked out in the quarter-finals in each of the last two seasons, first by Barcelona and then by Chelsea, PSG are determined to go further this time and are widely expected to come through Group F, which also contains Barca, APOEL of Cyprus and the Dutch champions. Ajax coach Frank de Boer sought to put pressure on the French capital club ahead of the game at the Amsterdam Arena by labelling them as one of the contenders to lift the trophy, but Blanc played down expectations. ""Of course PSG are becoming better and better known on a European level because of the players they have signed and their results,"" he said. ""But to be among the favourites is one thing, to prove it on the pitch is much more difficult."" PSG's Qatari president Nasser Al-Khelaifi set his side the target of winning the Champions League by 2016, but Blanc insisted he has not been set any specific goal for this season. He said: ""The club have not given me any precise objective. But when they say to you that you have to go as far as possible in the Champions League, I understand that means to try and go all the way. ""It is easy to say. We can say it is the objective but so many clubs can say the same. Getting out of the group stage is the first concrete objective. The first match is important and could condition what comes next."" Blanc was full of praise for Ajax, even if the four-time European champions can no longer be considered the force they once were at continental level. ""When you come to this stadium and walk down the corridors, you see what Ajax represent,"" said the 48-year-old Blanc. ""For me they are a legendary club. I grew up watching them play total football. They have had some great players and coaches."" Ajax edged out struggling Heracles 2-1 in the Dutch Eredivisie at the weekend and de Boer knows they will need to perform better on Wednesday. ""We are without doubt not the strongest side there is but we showed last year that we could beat the strong sides,"" said de Boer, whose side beat Barcelona 2-1 at home in last season's competition. ""I expect my players to make the most of tomorrow's match. We can and must play much better."" The game will see former Ajax stars Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Gregory Van der Wiel come up against their former clubs, while the visitors have doubts over the fitness of their two summer signings David Luiz and Serge Aurier. However, both trained on Tuesday and Blanc said: ""I think and I hope that both will be ready to play."""
1086,16/09/2014,11:09,"PSG's Aurier, Luiz fit for Ajax trip",Paris Saint-Germain defenders David Luiz and Serge Aurier have been given the all clear to travel with the French champions to Wednesday's Champions league group opener at Ajax.,"Luiz picked up a knee injury playing for Brazil and Aurier lost consciousness during a clash of heads playing for the Ivory Coast. The pair were missing for Saturday's 1-1 Ligue 1 draw at Rennes but their presence in Wednesday's squad does not guarantee they will play in Amsterdam. Skipper Thiago Silva will not be available however as he continues to recover from a thigh injury. Defensive midfielder Adrien Rabiot, who has fallen out of favour with team bosses since the interseason when he nearly joined AS Roma, was not selected for the match."
1087,15/09/2014,19:10,Verratti commits his long-term future to PSG,Highly-rated Italian international midfielder Marco Verratti out off potential suitors on Monday by signing a one-year extension to his present contract which ties him to French champions Paris Saint Germain until 2019.,"The 21-year-old, who has been capped nine times and was a member of the Italy squad at the World Cup finals, said he had never thought PSG would feature on his CV but now he had enjoyed success with them since he joined from Pescara in 2012 he was keen to extend the adventure. ""When I thought about my career PSG did not figure at all,"" he said. ""I want to carry on winning trophies with the club as well as making progress alongside the great players there."" PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi said he was delighted to have secured Verratti's accord as he feared teams were lining up to take him away. ""All of Europe covets Marco Verratti, and every year he gives he declares to us his desire to stay with us,"" said the Qatari. ""Marco is one of the ablest players at the club and our extending his contract demonstrates the club's ambition to become one of the biggest teams in Europe."""

It was a third draw in three outings for PSG who had opened the scoring two minutes before the break through a rare goal from defender Zoumana Camara. But a slipup by Camara allowed the hosts get a share of the points as Cameroon striker Paul-Georges Ntep got one past PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu after 55 minutes. The visitors only had one other clear chance on goal through Swedish international Zlatan Ibrahimovic in the first half. ""I would have preferred not to score and to win the match,"" admitted Camara. ""It's not worrying. It's a draw. There's nothing alarming about that. Now we have to recover because the Champions League is Wednesday. It's going to be something else, that's for sure."" Laurent Blanc's side now have a busy schedule with six more games in the next three weeks, with their Champions League campaign beginning at Ajax next Wednesday. ""We really wanted to score a second goal but everything was against us,"" said Blanc with skipper Thiago Silva still sidelined while David Luiz suffered a knee knock playing for Brazil and Serge Aurier needs extra tests after losing consciousness during a clash of heads playing for the Ivory Coast. Rennes move up to third, a point behind PSG. Lyon, meanwhile, got back to winning ways on Friday with a 2-1 home win against Monaco. Nabil Fekir opened the scoring after 30 minutes for the hosts before Lucas Ocampos equalized nine minutes later. Corentin Tolisso's goal after 73 minutes ended a three-game losing streak for new coach Hubert Fournier, as Monaco sit 16th after five games, ahead of Tuesday's Champions League game at home against Bayer Leverkusen. The win lifted Lyon to 12th place, four points behind leader Bordeaux, as they prepare to play at Paris Saint-Germain next week."
1089,12/09/2014,01:55,PSG begin busy month with Rennes test,"With the international break now over, French champions Paris Saint-Germain begin a busy sequence of matches on Saturday when they travel to Brittany to face Rennes in Ligue 1.","Laurent Blanc's side will play seven matches in the next three and a half weeks, with their Champions League campaign beginning at Ajax next Wednesday, but first they will look to extend their unbeaten start to the season at the Stade de la Route de Lorient. The capital club produced comfortably their best performance so far this season when they hammered Saint-Etienne 5-0 in their last outing before the international break, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring a hat-trick, but they will be wary of a Rennes side who won when the clubs last met in May. On that occasion, PSG had just been confirmed as champions when Philippe Montanier's men claimed a 2-1 victory in the capital that secured their own survival, although the Rennes squad has undergone a major overhaul since then. Rennes, who are unbeaten in their last three outings, saw 11 new faces arrive over the summer, with the last to join before the transfer window closed being Gent forward Habib Habibou, who began his career as a youth at PSG. He will hope to make his debut as Montanier looks for his side to spring a surprise against the two-time defending champions. ""I think Paris will be even more difficult to beat this season, but the merit will be all the greater for the teams who manage to,"" Montanier said. ""I hope we prove to be one of them."" PSG have defensive problems with skipper Thiago Silva still sidelined while David Luiz suffered a knee knock playing for Brazil and Serge Aurier needs extra tests after losing consciousness during a clash of heads playing for the Ivory Coast. Paris come into the weekend in second place, two points behind unbeaten leaders Bordeaux, who go to Guingamp on Sunday. Elsewhere on Sunday, Marseille go to bottom club Evian looking for a third straight win that would improve the tense atmosphere around the club after coach Marcelo Bielsa hit out at president Vincent Labrune for his summer transfer dealings. The enigmatic Argentine claimed that none of the players he wanted to bring to the Stade Velodrome were signed, and insisted that he was against the decision to bring in young Brazilian defender Doria, a five million-euro signing from Botafogo on deadline day. However, Doria, who at 19 is labelled as one of Brazil's most exciting prospects, told sports daily L'Equipe that Bielsa's comments have left him unfazed. ""That changes nothing for me,"" he said. ""I think that is a problem between the coach and the board. It doesn't matter. I was told Bielsa had been following me for a while; now he says he doesn't know me. I am going to do my job and show him my worth. That's all I can do."" Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim has also endured a difficult start to life in Ligue 1 after seeing a host of leading players depart without being replaced. However, in contrast to Bielsa, the Portuguese refused to hit out at the club's hierarchy ahead of his side's trip to Lyon. ""The team has lost five first-team regulars, including its three top scorers, two leading assist providers and its captain,"" said Jardim after seeing Radamel Falcao follow James Rodriguez, Emmanuel Riviere and Eric Abidal out of the principality. ""We can therefore no longer compare the team to that of last season. ""The club's plans have changed. It is a different team, with a few experienced players to supervise the youngsters."" Monaco, who host Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League next Tuesday, face a Lyon side who have also started badly but who welcome back playmaker Yoann Gourcuff after his latest injury.

Paris St Germain said however that the 21-year-old would undergo more medical examinations after he was stretchered off in Wednesday night's game in Yaounde. ""The victim of a violent clash of heads when he was disputing the ball with Cameroon attacker Kweuke Leonard, the Elephants defender lost consciousness in the 55th minute, creating shock on the pitch and among the public,"" said a federation statement. ""Treatment that was given in the Ahmadou Ahidjo stadium in Yaounde helped him to recover enough to go back to the Ivorian team bench."" The federation said Aurier suffered ""shock from the force of the blow to his head but did not have any convulsions."" Ivory Coast coach Herve Renard said that Aurier ""briefly"" lost consciousness but that his injuries were not ""serious"". Paris St Germain said Aurier had gone with the Ivory Coast team back to Abidjan for a scan before returning to France where he will undergo ""extra exams."" ""Paris St Germain are in permanent contact with the player and the Ivorian team medical staff,"" said a club statement. Clinton N'Jie and Vincent Aboubakar scored twice each for the four-time African Cup winners the Indomitable Lions in the crucial Group D win that gave Cameroon a three-point lead after two qualifying games. Cameroon also had a goal disallowed in a performance that helped overcome the bitter disappointment of crashing out of the World Cup in Brazil this year when they lost all three group games and became embroiled in a row over bonuses."

But European football's governing body said on Friday that their appeals body had partially upheld PSG's appeal and instead fined the club 50,000 euros ($64,790). PSG will host Spanish giants Barcelona on September 30. The club have also been ordered to make changes at their stadium ""in order that people with reduced mobility are better protected,"" UEFA said in a statement. During the April 2 first-leg quarter-final -- in which PSG beat the Londoners 3-1 -- a group of disabled Chelsea fans were seated among the home supporters due to a lack of facilities in the visitors' stands.

It stops new investors from coming into football,"" said Al-Khelaifi, who became PSG president after Qatar Sports Investments bought the French capital club in 2011. QSI sanctioned the spending of huge sums in the transfer market in their first three summers at the Parc des Princes in a bid to turn the club into one of Europe's biggest, culminating in the 64 million-euro (£51m, $84m) recruitment of Edinson Cavani from Napoli in July 2013. But in May PSG, along with Premier League champions Manchester City, were slapped with a fine of 60 million euros for breaching FFP regulations, namely accruing losses in excess of the 45-million-euro limit over the course of the past two seasons. The French champions also agreed not to increase their wage bill for the next two campaigns and to ""significantly limit spending"" in the transfer market while curbing losses to no more than 30 million euros next year. That compromises their chances of competing in the Champions League against the financial might of the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and the cash-rich giants of the English Premier League. ""It protects the big clubs and obliges the smaller ones to remain small clubs,"" Al-Khelaifi continued. ""If investors are prevented from coming into football, they will invest in Formula One or elsewhere. ""It is not good for football. We are ready to work within the rules but I hope UEFA are going to change it next year because a lot of clubs have complained. I hope a solution can be found."" Ironically, FFP makes it practically impossible for clubs within France to compete with PSG's strength domestically as Laurent Blanc's side chase a third consecutive Ligue 1 title. Just a year ago, Monaco splashed out over 150 million euros in the transfer market, the majority going on signing Colombian stars James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao. That saw them emerge as a genuine threat to PSG's hegemony, but Russian billionaire owner Dimitri Rybolovlev has now reined in his spending, with the need to adhere to FFP cited as the principal reason. Rodriguez was sold to Madrid for up to 80 million euros while Falcao was touted around Europe's leading clubs before joining Manchester United on loan on transfer deadline day. They were not replaced, and Monaco's chances of challenging for the title, a year after finishing second with a record points tally, appear slim. ""I'm not worried for PSG but I am worried for French football,"" said Al-Khelaifi when asked about the apparent lack of competitiveness in Ligue 1. ""It is not good to see great players leaving. I was very happy to see a major investor at Monaco and I hope that others will come because it's very important for French football."" The constraints of PSG limited their summer recruitment drive to a 49.5 million-euro splash on Chelsea's Brazil defender David Luiz, while Serge Aurier joined from Toulouse on an initial one-year loan. They had to abandon moves to sign Argentina winger Angel di Maria because that would have meant selling someone first, something Al-Khelaifi was not prepared to do. Di Maria ended up joining Manchester United for a British record fee of £59.7 million. ""Financial Fair Play has been a bit difficult for us but it hasn't stopped us,"" said Al-Khelaifi. ""For Di Maria, I had discussions with Real Madrid and my friend (president) Florentino Perez but we didn't reach an agreement on the price and so we stopped the discussions. ""I think our squad is fine as it is. We didn't need any other players. We had already spent an awful lot on players over the last three years. The idea is to construct a great club, with stability now."" And the likes of Cavani, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Javier Pastore, all expensive signings of the QSI era, remain despite being linked with moves away. ""When we buy a player it is because we believe in his qualities. We had very significant offers for several players. I said no. Stability is very important."""

And the likes of Cavani, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Javier Pastore, all expensive signings of the QSI era, remain despite being linked with moves away. ""When we buy a player it is because we believe in his qualities. We had very significant offers for several players. I said no. Stability is very important."""
1094,01/09/2014,00:10,PSG crush St Etienne as leaders Bordeaux draw,Champions Paris Saint-Germain thumped Saint-Etienne 5-0 as Bordeaux saw their 100 percent record at the start of the Ligue 1 season ended on Sunday with a 1-1 draw against Bastia.,"Zlatan Ibrahimovic, making his injury return, scored a hat-trick and strike partner Edinson Cavani also netted as the big-spending Parisians ran riot in the capital to move up to second. ""It's normal when you add a very good player that you play better,"" said PSG coach Laurent Blanc. ""We are therefore better with him, his presence is important."" But they were given a huge helping hand by Saint-Etienne goalkeeper Stephane Ruffier who failed to control a back pass on 24 minutes, turning the ball into his own net as he tried to the steer it on to his right foot but instead pushed it over the line. Ibrahimovic, making his return from injury, notched his first four minutes before the break with a firm header from Maxwell's left-wing cross. He doubled his tally as he ran on to a wayward back pass on 62 minutes before rounding Ruffier and slotting into the empty net. A minute later Cavani lashed in an unstoppable drive from distance that left Ruffier rooted to his line. Ibrahimovic completed his hat-trick on 72 minutes after beating a static offside trap and slotting the ball past Ruffier at his near post. St Etienne coach Christophe Galthier paid tribute to the Sweden star. ""Our opponents were superior in every department, showed great determination and had their leader back,"" he said. ""I had said I'd like to see Ibra but but I didn't want to see him score."" Earlier, Bordeaux, trailing 1-0 to a first-half strike from Ivorian forward Junior Tallo, were let off the hook when Floyd Ayite's net-bound strike with quarter of an hour remaining was deflected onto the bar by the hand of home defender Nicolas Pallois. No penalty was given and instead Bordeaux drew level in the 79th minute thanks to Diego Rolan's third goal of the season. The result left Bordeaux two points clear of PSG and Lille. ""From the bench, everything happens so fast that you can't see,"" said Sagnol of the penalty incident. ""But it would be a shame to reduce the match to just that."" Bastia, who were wearing white Bordeaux training tops after bringing the wrong kit to the Stade Chaban-Delmas, opened the scoring on 18 minutes when Tallo fired home from eight yards after Ayite's miscued header fell into his path. Bastia coach Claude Makelele could only look on as Mariano's ball into the box was chested down and then fired home on the turn by Uruguayan forward Rolan. ""As I said to the referee, these things happen so fast,"" said Makelele of the penalty controversy. ""He made a mistake and has admitted it. I'm satisfied with that."" Meanwhile, Lyon's poor start to the season continued as they threw away a lead to lose 2-1 at promoted Metz. France striker Alexandre Lacazette tapped in to give Lyon the lead midway through the second half at the Stade Saint-Symphorien, only for Yeni Ngbakoto to equalise with a penalty in the 82nd minute after Jordan Ferri was adjudged to have fouled Bouna Sarr. Metz then clinched their first win since returning to Ligue 1 with three minutes remaining when Venezuelan striker Juan Falcon swooped to head home from Kevin Lejeune's cross. The late turnaround sealed a dreadful week for Lyon, who were knocked out of the Europa League play-offs by Romanian side Astra Giurgiu in midweek and have now lost three Ligue 1 games on the bounce. On Saturday, Monaco came from behind to draw 1-1 with Lille as Dimitar Berbatov cancelled out Nolan Roux's opener, but the Principality club's day was overshadowed by the late withdrawal from their squad of Radamel Falcao amid mounting speculation that the Colombian is on his way out of the club. There were also wins for Rennes, Lorient, Nantes, Toulouse and Lens to go along with a 4-0 victory for Marseille on Friday against south coast rivals Nice."
1095,31/08/2014,14:35,Europe's Big Five smash transfer window records,"England and Spain have led a record breaking summer transfer market by Europe's big five leagues worth well over $2 billion (1.5 billion euros, £1.2 billion), with more big deals looming before the window closes on Monday.","Radamel Falcao and Arturo Vidal are among the big names and Real Madrid and Manchester United in the big clubs touted for major deals on the final day of the transfer window when another $250 million of business could be done. ""This summer transfer window is one of records,"" said Dan Jones of the Deloitte consultancy's Sports Business Group. He highlighted that in the last two summer windows more than 20% of English Premier League clubs' spending occurred on deadline day. ""There is still potential for a significant increase"" in the record breaking spending already seen, he said. FIFA's transfer monitoring system said that by Sunday, $2.09 billion had been spent by top clubs in England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France, breaking last year's record of $2.02 billion. It said that England's Premier League accounted for more than 43% of the big five's spending, followed by Spain on more than 25% and Germany on about 10%. Italy and France follow, with spending down in both in Serie A and Ligue 1. According to Deloitte's figures, more than £725 million ($1.2 billion) had been spent by England's 20 Premier League clubs from June 9 up to Friday. That is already more than £100 million more than last year. British media said the figure had risen to nearly £750 million by Sunday, helped by Manchester United's £14 million plus purchase of Danny Blind from Ajax Amsterdam. Manchester United have been Europe's top spenders, laying out more than £140 million ($240 million) to buy Blind, Angel di Maria from Real Madrid for £59 million, Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo. They have been linked with Vidal and other names before the transfer windown closes at 2200 GMT on Monday. Liverpool have also spent more than £115 million, mainly to buy Mario Balotelli, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren. Chelsea have laid out more than £75 (including Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa) and Arsenal more than £62 million. English clubs have spent about $300 million on Spanish players. But, according to FIFA, Spain's current spending is closing on $600 million and already three times higher than last year's pre-season transfer window. A spending splurge by Real Madrid and Barcelona has accounted for the buying. Barcelona paid Liverpool more than $125 million for Luis Suarez, while Real Madrid spent a reported $108 million on Monaco's James Rodriguez and more than $35 million on German World Cup midfielder Toni Kroos. But after losing Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich, Real are still in market for a big signing, according to club officials. Media reports Sunday linked Real to Falcao at Monaco and Manchester United's Mexican forward Javier Hernandez. Spending by Germany's cautious Bundesliga team is more than 25% up at nearly $300 million so far, according to FIFA's figures. But it is still way behind England and Spain. And Italy and France have seen dramatic falls in their spending, reflecting the state of their countries' economies and the impact of UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations. Spending by Italian clubs approaching $200 million is 45% down on last year. AC Milan took Chelsea's Fernando Torres in a loan deal on Saturday. Top French sides Paris St Germain and Monaco have spent 75% less this year on new players than in the 2013 transfer window. The $67 million move by Brazilian defender David Luiz from Chelsea to Paris was the biggest purchase in France."
1096,22/08/2014,22:42,Ten-man PSG held by struggling Evian,"Paris Saint-Germain once again came unstuck against their bete noire Evian on Friday, being forced to settle for a 0-0 draw after having Yohan Cabaye sent off in their Ligue 1 clash in Annecy.","Evian have caused problems for PSG at their Parc des Sports in the recent past, knocking the capital club out of the French Cup at the quarter-final stage in 2012-13 and then winning 2-0 last December after Paris had gone 26 games unbeaten. Nevertheless, the Alpine outfit had lost their opening two matches of this campaign, conceding nine goals in the process, including in a 6-2 thumping at Rennes last week. But they defended doggedly to hold the champions, who were missing talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic and captain Thiago Silva due to injury and have won just one of their opening three league matches after drawing 2-2 at Reims a fortnight ago. PSG coach Laurent Blanc gave first starts of the season to French international pair Cabaye and Blaise Matuidi, with Thiago Motta only on the bench after a headbutt from Brandao at the end of last week's 2-0 win against SC Bastia left him with a fractured nose. With Ibrahimovic absent, Edinson Cavani was given the opportunity to play in his favoured role of central striker, and he had the best chances for the visitors. However, his free-kick midway through the first half was tame and went straight into the arms of Evian's Danish goalkeeper Jesper Hansen. A defence-splitting pass by Lucas then put Cavani through, but he slipped while attempting to round Hansen and his shot was easily blocked. Lucas fired narrowly wide of the far post early in the second period and the Brazilian then created another opening for Cavani in the 71st minute, but this time the long-haired forward saw his ferocious strike beaten out by Hansen. Before that, the visitors were reduced to ten men in the 62nd minute when Cabaye, starting for the first time since an extended post-World Cup holiday, was shown a second yellow card for a second foul on Nicki Bille Nielsen. With a man less, they lacked the inspiration to break down the determined hosts, although Evian only really attempted to snatch victory themselves in the dying minutes. Salvatore Sirigu had been a virtual spectator all evening, but the Italian international 'keeper was finally called into action in the second minute of stoppage time to tip a net-bound Nicolas Benezet effort over the bar. Early leaders Bordeaux are in action away to Nice on Saturday, while Saint-Etienne, the only other side with maximum points after two games, entertain Rennes on Sunday. Marseille will look for their first win under new coach Marcelo Bielsa away to French Cup holders Guingamp on Saturday afternoon, and Monaco travel to Nantes on Sunday night after losing their first two games of the campaign."
1097,21/08/2014,02:15,Whipping boys Evian next up for injury-hit PSG,Injuries to several key players mean that Paris Saint-Germain's trip to struggling Evian in Ligue 1 on Friday may prove a stiffer test than the reigning champions bargained for.,"With captain Thiago Silva already out for several weeks with a hamstring injury, PSG saw Zlatan Ibrahimovic go off with a slight muscle tear in his side early in last week's 2-0 home win against SC Bastia. A first Ligue 1 win of the campaign for Laurent Blanc's side was also overshadowed by a fractured vertebra suffered by Gregory Van der Wiel, while midfielder Thiago Motta's nose was fractured following an ugly clash with Bastia's Brazilian striker Brandao in the tunnel after the game. There is plenty of depth to the capital club's squad, with Serge Aurier, Yohan Cabaye, Blaise Matuidi and Ezequiel Lavezzi all starting on the bench last weekend, but the loss of Silva and Ibrahimovic in particular is an undoubted blow ahead of the game in Annecy. When Paris faced Evian away last season, nobody expected their run of 26 Ligue 1 matches without defeat to come to an end, yet they were beaten 2-0. In April 2013, Evian also knocked their illustrious opponents out of the French Cup quarter-finals on penalties, but it would still be a major surprise if they slipped up this time. ""We are a step ahead compared to this time last year,"" says Blanc, whose team started last season slowly before running away with the title. ""Our physical preparation has not changed. It is just that we have been together a year longer. In terms of our play, there is no comparison."" ""Last year we lost 2-0 there but the conditions were complicated because the pitch was frozen,"" pointed out left-back Lucas Digne. ""In any case we are expecting another difficult match."" That is despite the fact that Evian lie rooted to the foot of the table already. Many observers' pre-season favourites to go down, Evian have conceded nine goals in losing their opening two matches, including a 6-2 hammering at Rennes last weekend. ""There were good signs in pre-season, but unfortunately after 180 minutes in Ligue 1 we have let in nine goals,"" said Evian coach Pascal Dupraz, before adding: ""It is never good to play PSG, but we didn't steal our victory when we beat them last season."" Under normal circumstances, the pressure would be on Dupraz, but he is so powerful within the club, also holding the role of general manager, that the chances of him being ousted from the dugout seem slim. In contrast, the pressure is on two of Ligue 1's newest faces already, with Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa in need of a first win when his side face Guingamp in Brittany. More seasoned observers of French football believe that Argentine Bielsa and Monaco's new Portuguese coach Leonardo Jardim, with their out of the ordinary tactical choices and training regimes, may have underestimated Ligue 1. Monaco have lost their first two games under Jardim, including a 4-1 thumping at Bordeaux, and need to halt the slide when they go to Nantes. The principality club's Russian vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said: ""We are not satisfied. We have started badly. But I am not worried, because we have changed a lot of things in terms of methodology and the team. We need time for everything to gel."" In contrast, Bordeaux have enjoyed a perfect start under new boss Willy Sagnol. They travel south to face Nice, while Saint-Etienne, having also had a perfect start, host Rennes on Sunday after a hazardous trip to Turkey to play Karabukspor in the Europa League on Thursday. Lyon are also in Europa League action on Thursday, against Romania's Astra Giurgiu, before hosting Lens, while Lille play Lorient in between the two legs of their Champions League play-off with Porto.

Images from CCTV cameras in the tunnel at the Parc des Princes showed Brandao waiting for Motta to approach him before headbutting the Brazil-born Italy international at the end of the Ligue 1 game. ""Of course it merits a sanction,"" Braillard told France Info, calling Brandao's action ""scandalous, unacceptable"". Brandao, who was suspended for four matches last season for elbowing PSG's Yohan Cabaye at the Parc des Princes while playing for Saint-Etienne, risks a lengthy suspension, while PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi on Saturday called for a lifetime ban. Bastia said they would release a detailed statement on Monday after speaking to the player and others involved in the incident in the capital. The disciplinary committee of the Professional Football League (LFP) are set to examine the incident on Thursday. To make matters worse for Brandao, PSG, the French champions, also confirmed that right back Gregory Van der Wiel suffered ""a fracture of the second lumbar vertebra following a knee in the back from the Bastia player Brandao in the first half""."

The French champions added that right-back Gregory Van der Wiel suffered ""a fracture of the second lumbar vertebra following a knee in the back from the Bastia player Brandao in the first half."" The game, in which Lucas and Edinson Cavani found the net, was also overshadowed by the early injury to Zlatan Ibrahimovic that forced him off. PSG said that the Swede, who was the stand-in captain in the absence of Thiago Silva with a hamstring injury, had ""a partial tear of the left oblique muscle of the 12th rib."" They added that ""the evolution of these injuries under treatment over the next few days will allow the medical staff to estimate recovery times."" Brandao, who was suspended for four matches last season for elbowing PSG's Yohan Cabaye at the Parc des Princes while playing for Saint-Etienne, risks a lengthy suspension for his behaviour with Paris president Nasser Al-Khelaifi on Saturday calling for a lifetime ban. Bastia said that they would only release a detailed statement on Monday after speaking to the player and others involved in the incidents in the capital."
1100,16/08/2014,19:03,Ibrahimovic off injured in PSG victory,Paris Saint-Germain overcame the early loss of the injured Zlatan Ibrahimovic as they eased to a 2-0 victory against SC Bastia at the Parc des Princes on Saturday.,"The Swede appeared to strain a muscle in his side in innocuous fashion early on, and lasted barely 15 minutes before making way for Ezequiel Lavezzi. However, in his absence, Lucas opened the scoring in the 26th minute and Edinson Cavani doubled their advantage just before the hour mark to score his first of the campaign and give PSG their first victory in Ligue 1 after last weekend's 2-2 draw at Reims. Bastia had never beaten PSG away from home in the top flight but they were optimistic of springing a surprise thanks to the influence of their new coach Claude Makelele, the former Paris captain who gave up his role as assistant coach at the Parc des Princes to take over in Corsica this summer. Makelele's men had recovered from 3-1 down to draw 3-3 at home to Marseille last weekend, but they rarely looked like doing anything similar on this occasion as PSG's expensive summer signing David Luiz was afforded a gentle stroll in the late afternoon sunshine for his Ligue 1 debut. The Brazilian -- signed from Chelsea for a reported 50 million euros (£39.9m, $67.1m) -- might not have started this match had his compatriot and captain Thiago Silva not been ruled out for several weeks with a hamstring injury suffered in Monday's friendly win against Napoli, and home coach Laurent Blanc could have done without losing his stand-in skipper Ibrahimovic as a result. Blanc also took Gregory Van der Wiel off at half-time, the Dutch right-back reportedly struggling with a calf knock and making way for Serge Aurier, who made his home debut after signing on loan from Toulouse. Before that, Van der Wiel had been the creator of the game's opening goal, his cross from the right being met first-time on the volley by the unmarked Lucas at the back post. The reigning champions then struck again in the 57th minute when Uruguay star Cavani brilliantly controlled a quickly-taken Marco Verratti free-kick inside the area before acrobatically volleying past Bastia's on-loan PSG goalkeeper Alphonse Areola and into the net. On Friday, Lille warmed up for the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Portuguese giants FC Porto by beating promoted Caen 1-0 courtesy of a second-half penalty from Belgian international forward Divock Origi."
1101,15/08/2014,02:30,Makelele bidding to be thorn in PSG's side,A familiar face will hope to make it another frustrating day for Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday as the champions play their first home game of the new Ligue 1 season against SC Bastia.,"The Corsicans are now coached by former France midfielder Claude Makelele, who gave up his position as Laurent Blanc's assistant at the Parc des Princes to become a coach in his own right. Makelele also finished his playing career as captain of PSG and his presence on the opposition bench adds extra intrigue to a game that carries real importance to the hosts after they kicked off the campaign with a 2-2 draw at Reims. ""I am very happy that things have turned out this way and I can't wait to be at the Parc des Princes,"" said Makelele of the prospect of returning to Paris after last week's 3-3 draw with Marseille, another of his old clubs. Makelele's previous job means he knows exactly how PSG will set themselves up, but he played down Bastia's chances of recording a first ever win in this fixture. ""Laurent Blanc has a clear philosophy and he will not change just because I have been his assistant,"" said the 41-year-old. ""I know well enough how things work there to have an idea of what to expect but I have no miracle recipe. Nobody can compare themselves with PSG in Ligue 1. In my view, no team will go to the Parc and win. But we will do everything to be the only ones who do."" PSG, who have now failed to win their opening game in any of the four seasons since the Qatari takeover in the capital, were dealt a blow on Monday when captain Thiago Silva suffered a hamstring injury in a 2-1 friendly victory against Napoli that will rule him out for several weeks. Blanc has been criticised for bringing Silva back so soon after he was afforded a long summer break, and he may now be tempted to give new recruit David Luiz a little longer to build up his fitness. ""Thiago Silva did not return to training too soon. If we need to blame someone for this injury then I plead guilty. I take responsibility,"" Blanc said. On the prospect of coming up against his old assistant, he added: ""I didn't expect him to leave us but I am not disappointed. It was his wish, his choice to seize the opportunity."" There are seven new coaches in Ligue 1 this season and the only one to lose on his debut was Leonardo Jardim, whose Monaco side were beaten 2-1 at home by Lorient despite seeing fit-again Radamel Falcao come off the bench and score a penalty. They will look to bounce back at Bordeaux, whose new coach Willy Sagnol is a former Monaco player. ""Like Monaco, Bordeaux have a new coach who advocates attacking football so we can expect a good game. We know we need to react after the defeat against Lorient,"" said Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic, who will miss the influence in central defence of suspended captain Ricardo Carvalho. Lille go to promoted Caen on Friday in a game brought forward to help them prepare for the first leg of their Champions League play-off against Porto next Wednesday. The northern club are desperate to progress in Europe, but Lille coach Rene Girard has reminded his side that Ligue 1 remains their bread and butter. ""Within the squad, we are not talking about Europe. The number one objective remains the league, even if competing in the Champions League is very important,"" he said ahead of a meeting with a Caen side that won 3-0 at Evian last week. Elsewhere, Lyon travel to Toulouse on Saturday while Marcelo Bielsa's Marseille entertain Montpellier and Saint-Etienne take on Reims on Sunday. Fixtures (Kick-offs 1800GMT unless stated)"
1102,13/08/2014,11:18,PSG without Thiago Silva for 'several weeks',"Paris Saint-Germain captain Thiago Silva will be out for ""several weeks"" with the hamstring injury that forced him off early in Monday's friendly against Napoli, the French champions confirmed on Wednesday.","""Tests undergone by Thiago Silva yesterday (ultrasound and MRI) have confirmed an injury to his right hamstring. He will be unavailable for several weeks,"" read a statement on PSG's website. The Brazilian centre-back lasted just 12 minutes of Monday's 2-1 win in Italy before having to come off after back-heeling the ball in his own penalty box. He is now unlikely to return until after the international break at the start of September, meaning he will miss Ligue 1 games against SC Bastia, Evian and Saint-Etienne and probably Brazil's friendlies in the United States next month against Colombia and Ecuador. However, PSG will hope that he is able to return in time for the start of the Champions League group stage on September 16 or 17. Silva surprised many by starting in last Friday's 2-2 draw at Reims in the opening Ligue 1 game of the new season, just days after returning to Paris following a holiday in the wake of the World Cup in his native Brazil. Paris coach Laurent Blanc insisted that the 29-year-old was in condition to play in that game, but questions will now be asked as to whether he returned too soon. In his absence, compatriots Marquinhos and David Luiz are likely to form PSG's centre-back pairing."
1103,11/08/2014,22:53,Silva injured as Luiz celebrates PSG debut with victory,Brazil centreback David Luiz began life with his new club French champions Paris Saint Germain with a 2-1 win in a friendly against Italian side Napoli on Monday in Naples.,"The 27-year-old -- who cost the French side a reported 50million euros (£39.9m, $67.1m) when he signed from Chelsea in June -- fared better than his national and club captain Thiago Silva, who had to go off in the 13th minute and trudged to the dressingroom with his right thigh strapped with ice. Both only returned to France last week after taking a holiday following the World Cup where Luiz wept openly following the 7-1 humiliation by eventual champions Germany in the semi-finals -- Luiz captained the side as Silva was injured -- and then lost to the Dutch in the third place match. Two others who also only recently returned Argentinian Ezequiel Lavezzi and Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani received different reactions from the home crowd for whom they were heroes until they left in 2012 and 2013 respectively. Lavezzi -- who impressed at the World Cup and was arguably Argentina's most effective player till he went off at half-time of the 1-0 defeat to Germany in the final -- went off to a standing ovation but Cavani weas booed and jeered throughout. Lavezzi's compatriot Gonzalo Higuain gave Rafael Benitez's side the lead six minutes into the second-half only for PSG's Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who had come on at the beginning of the second-half, to level four minutes later. Luiz went close to opening his account for PSG with a thunderous header from a corner in the 76th minute but it went over the bar. The visitors secured victory with a superb solo effort by Javier Pastore, the Argentinian outfoxing several Napoli defenders before slotting home 13 minutes from time. sk/pi"
1104,08/08/2014,22:54,Eventful night for Ibra as PSG start with draw,Zlatan Ibrahimovic took centre stage as reigning Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain had to come from behind to claim a 2-2 draw with Reims in the opening game of the new season on Friday.,"The Swede, France's leading scorer and standout performer in each of the last two campaigns, scored one goal, was credited with another, and missed a penalty that he had won in a remarkable encounter at the Stade Auguste-Delaune. After Ibrahimovic opened the scoring, goals from Prince Oniangue and Antoine Devaux had unfancied Reims in front at half-time in Champagne country, but Ibrahimovic saw parity restored in the second period when his cross was palmed across the line by home 'keeper Johny Placide. It was not the ideal start to the season for the capital club, but coach Laurent Blanc had warned that PSG would need time to find their feet with a host of leading players only recently beginning their preparations after taking holidays in the wake of the World Cup. And starting slowly is nothing new for PSG, who have now failed to win their opening match in any of the four seasons since Qatar Sports Investments began their revolution at the club in 2011. ""I thought my team played well. My only reproach is that they didn't kill the game off inside the first 20 minutes,"" Blanc told beIN Sports television. ""We expected it to be difficult and we didn't get the result we wanted but it is encouraging for the future because nobody could have complained had we been 4-0 up early on."" Summer signing David Luiz did not feature in the visitors' squad, while Yohan Cabaye, Blaise Matuidi, Maxwell and Ezequiel Lavezzi were also absent, but Brazil's Thiago Silva surprisingly started, and captained the side, having only come back to Paris earlier this week. On a wet night, Silva was a spectator for much of the opening 20 minutes as Paris threatened to embarrass their hosts. Ibrahimovic, scorer of a brace in last weekend's 2-0 Champions Trophy victory against Guingamp in Beijing, broke the deadlock inside seven minutes with a low finish under Placide after good work by Javier Pastore. The big striker was then furious with Lucas after the Brazilian attempted, unsuccessfully, to dribble round the 'keeper instead of tee up his colleague, who had the goal gaping. But when Marco Verratti laid another chance on a plate for Ibrahimovic moments later, he hit the post rather than roll the ball into an empty net. Reims could not cope with their opponents' attacking quality, but they were again let off the hook on 20 minutes when Ibrahimovic, having won a penalty after going down rather easily under a Mickael Tacalfred challenge, saw his spot-kick saved by Placide. And the hosts, playing their first competitive game since the summer appointment as coach of Jean-Luc Vasseur to replace Lyon-bound Hubert Fournier, soon punished PSG's profligacy. Congolese midfielder Oniangue got the equaliser when he turned in an Aissa Mandi free-kick that had been missed by Gregory Van der Wiel at the near post, and then Devaux slotted in his side's second after running half the length of the pitch and exchanging passes with Gaetan Charbonnier. Vasseur's side could not maintain their advantage after the restart, though, as PSG applied the pressure. It was 2-2 just after the hour mark when Ibrahimovic skipped away from Tacalfred and held up a spinning cross that did for the falling Placide, who could only palm it over his own line and then out again. If there was any doubt, Edinson Cavani made sure by tucking home the rebound, but the goal was credited to Ibrahimovic. PSG could not find a winner however, coming closest when substitute Clement Chantome's stoppage-time attempt was cleared off the line by the alert Mandi."
1105,07/08/2014,17:29,David Luiz focused on PSG future after World Cup trauma,Brazil defender David Luiz insisted he was over his World Cup heartbreak as he was unveiled as a new Paris Saint-Germain player at a plush hotel in the French capital on Thursday.,"""The days immediately after were very difficult. Obviously when you fail to reach an objective you are disappointed, but football is great because it gives you the chance to bounce back quickly,"" said the 27-year-old centre-back, who joined PSG from Chelsea on a five-year deal in June. He arrived in Paris at the start of this week after a holiday in the wake of a traumatic World Cup campaign on home soil, which saw Brazil eliminated at the semi-final stage in a record 7-1 defeat to Germany. The former Benfica player captained the Selecao in that game in the absence of his defensive partner and new PSG team-mate Thiago Silva, who was suspended, and he could not hold back the tears after the defeat in Belo Horizonte. His performances throughout the competition were the subject of criticism and have led many to question Qatar-bankrolled PSG's wisdom in spending a reported 50 million euros (£39.9m, $67.1m), a record sum for a defender, to sign him. His former manager at Chelsea, Jose Mourinho, has since said that Luiz was not a first choice at Stamford Bridge anyway and that he ""was a good professional and we will miss him...but from a football point of view we believe our squad is stronger this season than it was."" However, Luiz insisted that his track record, which includes winning the Champions League with the London club in 2012 and the Europa League in 2013, is a measure of his true quality and that Brazilian defenders are better than their World Cup meltdown suggests. ""The qualities of those who were at the World Cup is not up for discussion,"" he said at the brand-new Peninsula Hotel, close to Paris' emblematic Arc de Triomphe, which was built with Qatari money. ""Before the World Cup we played in lots of games too. In football, we always speak about the last match and the next one and I can't wait to play the next match because I miss being out on the pitch and I try to improve every day. ""Ten or 15 years ago everyone wanted attacking players from Brazil but now there are also lots of defenders playing for big clubs. That shows the quality of Brazilian defenders."" Of Mourinho, he said: ""It is normal that he should say what he said. If he had said that he missed me, he would have been contradicting himself. But now I listen to my new coach and what matters is what Laurent Blanc says. ""Mourinho and Chelsea, that is in the past. I was very happy there. But now I am looking at the present, in this great club, with a marvellous project for the future."" Luiz will play no part in the first game of PSG's defence of the Ligue 1 title, away to Reims on Friday evening, but he said he hoped to be ready in time to make his debut for Blanc's side when SC Bastia visit the Parc des Princes next weekend. Silva could also make his first appearance of the new campaign in that game and the Brazilian duo are almost certain to be Blanc's first-choice centre-back pairing. ""We are very good friends. We have played very well together for a long time,"" said Luiz of Silva, who is captain for club and country. ""We barely need to look at one another to have an understanding. It is good to have someone next to you who knows you."""
1106,07/08/2014,13:55,PSG end Di Maria transfer talks,"Paris Saint-Germain have pulled out of talks with Real Madrid over the transfer of Angel Di Maria because the Argentine midfielder is too expensive, club president Nasser al-Khelaifi said Thursday.","""We spoke with Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, but Di Maria was too expensive and we stopped talks,"" Khelaifi said during the unveiling of Brazil defender David Luiz. PSG have to bow this season to Financial Fair Play restrictions imposed by European football's governing body, UEFA. The Qatari-bankrolled capital club, along with Premier League champions Manchester City, were in May slapped with a fine of 60 million euros ($82 million, £49 million) for breaching FFP regulations, namely accruing losses in excess of the 45-million-euro limit over the course of the past two seasons. The French champions, in addition, agreed not to increase the club's wage bill for the next two campaigns and to ""significantly limit spending"" in the transfer market while curbing losses to no more than 30 million euros next year. With PSG having already forked out around 50 million euros to secure Luiz's services from Chelsea, Real's valuation of Di Maria at nearly 60 million forced them to back away from transfer talks. Khelaifi added that he didn't think Luiz had been expensive. ""He's a great player. It's the price. There were lots of big clubs who wanted to buy him and I'm very glad he came here,"" he said."
1107,07/08/2014,02:10,Blanc wary as understrength PSG begin,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc knows it will be difficult for his team to hit the ground running as they begin the defence of their Ligue 1 title away to Reims on Friday.,"The capital club are odds-on favourites to win a third consecutive French crown and go to the Stade Auguste-Delaune fresh from defeating Guingamp 2-0 in Beijing last weekend in the season-opening Champions Trophy. However, a quartet of key players will not be involved in Champagne country having only just started pre-season training after a post-World Cup holiday. None of Argentina's Ezequiel Lavezzi or Brazil trio Thiago Silva, Maxwell and new signing David Luiz will be considered for selection against Reims as a result. ""This month is going to be strange because we have so many players coming back at different times and not everyone is in the same physical condition,"" admitted Blanc. ""We have done a lot of tiring physical work. The games in August will be difficult but we are not worried."" Reims, who finished 11th last season, have a new coach, with Jean-Luc Vasseur replacing Hubert Fournier, who has taken over at Lyon. It is quite the baptism of fire for Vasseur, 45, who arrives from Ligue 2 Creteil and takes charge of a top-flight game for the first time against the club where he started his playing career. ""It is symbolic but I am thinking more than anything about my players. My job here is to take the team and the club forward. That comes before anything else,"" said Vasseur, who also began his coaching career at the Parc des Princes, working with the club's youngsters. ""When you have a game like this for the first match of the season there is not much I need to say to motivate the players."" While PSG have strengthened further with the recruits of Luiz and Serge Aurier, Reims have lost influential Polish midfielder Grzegorz Krychowiak to Spanish side Sevilla. The most likely threat to PSG's supremacy continues to come from Monaco, despite a summer in which they have lost playmaker James Rodriguez to Real Madrid and last season's leading scorer Emmanuel Riviere to Newcastle United. The principality club have a new coach in Leonardo Jardim, but after the lavish spending of last year, the 40-year-old Portuguese has yet to see any marquee signings arrive. As they prepare to host Lorient -- who have a new coach of their own in Sylvain Ripoll -- in their opening game on Sunday, veteran defender Ricardo Carvalho is confident that last season's runners-up can enjoy another successful campaign. ""We have a new coach, with a different mentality and methods to those of (Claudio) Ranieri,"" he said. ""Our pre-season has been a bit tiring. We have travelled a lot but we worked well. ""It is an advantage that we now know one another better. Two or three players should still join us but we are already stronger than last season."" There are seven matches on Saturday, with the pick seeing Marseille travel to Corsica to face Bastia in a meeting of two teams with new coaches. OM's response to a poor last season was to overhaul their backroom staff with Argentine Marcelo Bielsa appointed as coach. Bielsa, who has yet to give a press conference since arriving at the Stade Velodrome, has done plenty of experimentation on the field in pre-season, including using a 3-1-3-3 formation at times. Bastia, meanwhile, have handed the reins to former Real Madrid and Chelsea midfielder Claude Makelele, who was assistant coach at PSG last season and makes his debut against the club he represented for one campaign in the 1990s. Fresh from beating Grasshopper Zurich to qualify for the Champions League play-offs, Lille entertain promoted Metz, while Saint-Etienne go to Guingamp and Lyon's first game under Fournier is at home to Rennes on Sunday."
1108,06/08/2014,02:15,Insatiable Zlatan ready to keep making history,It was business as usual for Zlatan Ibrahimovic as he scored both goals against Guingamp to win France's season-opening Champions Trophy for Paris Saint-Germain in Beijing last weekend.,"One long-range thunderbolt and then a penalty had the Ligue 1 title-holders on the way to a 2-0 victory inside just 20 minutes, and gave the rest of France a glimpse of what could be to come in the season ahead. In a poll in the popular sports daily L'Equipe this week, 81 percent of those asked believed PSG would win a third successive championship and 65 percent said that the Swedish striker would be the top scorer for the third year running. Other world-class talents, such as Edinson Cavani, Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez, have come, and in the latter's case, gone from France in the last two years, but none can rival Zlatan's personality on or off the field. His presence may spell trouble to PSG's rivals, but his importance to the overall image of a French game which struggles to generate the same level of interest as its English, Spanish or German counterparts cannot be underestimated. With a total of 1.84 million, Ibrahimovic has more Twitter followers than any French club, PSG included, and PSG's Twitter homepage is emblazoned with a picture of the Swede celebrating a goal. Speaking of goals, he has already rewritten records since arriving in France from AC Milan in 2012 and he is on course to keep on doing so in the campaign ahead. In 2012-13, he became the first player to score 30 goals in a French top-flight season since Jean-Pierre Papin for Marseille in 1990 and he followed that with 26 goals in the last campaign, 10 more than any other player. Despite missing much of the latter stages of last season due to injury, he still mustered a total of 40 goals in all competitions, beating the previous individual club best of 39 set by Carlos Bianchi in 1978. As a result, he already lies sixth in the capital club's list of all-time leading scorers, with 78. And if he keeps scoring at his present rate, he could overtake Pedro Pauleta's record tally of 109 this season. ""When I came to Paris, I said that I wanted to make history,"" said Ibrahimovic after beating Guingamp last weekend. ""I am starting my third season here and we have already won five trophies. ""I still have a strong desire to win every match. We have written our names down in history and we continue to do so."" He has already won nine league titles in spells in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and France, but the main goal for 'Ibra' now must be to win the Champions League, a competition in which he has often failed to deliver in the biggest matches. He will turn 33 in October, so there will not be many more chances for a player whose contract at the Parc des Princes runs through to 2016. But he comes into this season seemingly more settled and fresh than ever before. Sweden's failure to qualify meant Zlatan did not take part at the World Cup, although he was still one of the last PSG players to report back for pre-season training. But having declared that ""a World Cup without me is nothing to watch"", he did make it to Brazil and was spotted alongside PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi in the crowd as Spain lost to Chile and Uruguay beat England, with his colleague Cavani playing a starring role. In Paris, coach Laurent Blanc has yet to work out a way of getting the best out of Cavani and Ibrahimovic together in the same side, but the latter's objectives are clear. ""Do better than last season. We had a fantastic season winning three trophies,"" he said. ""We are focused on keeping this project growing and moving forward. There is pressure on us but the players who are here are used to that. To say that we are a great team is not enough. We have to prove it on the field."""
1109,05/08/2014,02:14,Financial Fair Play main threat to PSG dominance,Paris Saint-Germain threaten to again run away with the Ligue 1 title but punishments from UEFA in relation to Financial Fair Play could prove a thorn in the side in their pursuit of greater acclaim.,"PSG strolled to a second successive championship last season, and with nearest rivals Monaco losing Colombian World Cup star James Rodriguez to Real Madrid, there appear few on-field obstacles to the capital side retaining their title. However, the financial constraints imposed upon the Qatari-bankrolled club by European football's governing body are another matter. PSG, along with Premier League champions Manchester City, were in May slapped with a fine of 60 million euros ($82 million, £49 million) for breaching FFP regulations, namely accruing losses in excess of the 45-million-euro limit over the course of the past two seasons. The French champions, in addition, agreed not to increase the club's wage bill for the next two campaigns and to ""significantly limit spending"" in the transfer market while curbing losses to no more than 30 million euros next year. Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi bemoaned the sanctions, saying they would represent a ""tremendous handicap"", particularly in PSG's quest for continental success. But he defiantly proclaimed that nothing would derail PSG's five-year plan, a blueprint laid out by Qatar Sports Investments following their takeover in June 2011 targeting a Champions League title by 2016, adding: ""To be clear -- the players I want, I'll have them."" True to his word Al-Khelaifi and PSG soon splashed out a reported 50 million euros, a world record fee for a defender, to sign Chelsea's David Luiz. And they then appeared to devise a way to circumvent the restrictions in place with the season-long loan signing of Ivory Coast defender Serge Aurier from Toulouse - a deal which includes an option for PSG to eventually make the move permanent. It is reported that a similar arrangement could also pave the way for Argentine winger Angel Di Maria to arrive in Paris from Real Madrid, initially on loan. Whether such a deal is feasible remains to be seen with PSG still seemingly needing to offload players -- Alex, Jeremy Menez and Christophe Jallet have already left -- to adhere to the wage restrictions administered by the FFP ruling. Nevertheless, coach Laurent Blanc, who in May signed a contract extension to keep him at the club until 2016, can be confident that his squad already has sufficient quality to dominate at home. They gave a hint of what could be to come when they brushed aside Guingamp 2-0 in the season-opening Champions Trophy in Beijing last weekend. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored both goals in that game and this will be an important season for the outstanding player in France in the last two years. The Swede will turn 33 in October and may view this as his last realistic chance to win the Champions League, the trophy that he and PSG desire more than anything else. But his importance at the Parc des Princes also presents a problem that Blanc has not yet been able to solve -- how to get the very best out of both Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani in the same starting line-up? The 27-year-old Uruguayan was the marquee signing of last summer, brought in from Napoli for a Ligue 1 record 64 million euros. He scored 16 league goals in his debut season but his campaign was hindered by injury and he was unhappy at being forced to play out of position on the wing because of the need to accomodate Ibrahimovic through the middle. Cavani said last week that he would be staying put despite suggestions he wants away. But he added: ""It is important for an attacker to play in a position that is natural for him. Everyone knows what my position is and there is no point talking about it again."" If Blanc can solve the Cavani conundrum, then PSG may finally manage to get beyond the quarter-finals in the Champions League despite the limitations placed on them by UEFA."
1110,04/08/2014,02:10,PSG expected to reign supreme as Ligue 1 returns,"Not so long ago it was the most competitive league in Europe, yet few people will anticipate anything but a Paris Saint-Germain procession towards another title as the Ligue 1 season commences this weekend.","There were five different champions in five seasons from 2008 to 2012 but now the capital club will be looking for a third consecutive title after a summer in which their rivals, feeling the financial pinch, got weaker. In May, PSG were fined 60 million euros ($82 million, £49 million) by UEFA for failing to comply with Financial Fair Play rules, although that has not stopped them from strengthening. They accepted the punishments ""in spite of the tremendous handicap they represent in terms of the club's ability to fully compete on an equal footing against Europe's biggest teams."" But president Nasser Al-Khelaifi declared that ""nothing and no-one will stop us, we always dream bigger."" And the capital club were still able to splash out a reported 50 million euros to sign Brazil defender David Luiz from Chelsea while powerful Ivory Coast full-back Serge Aurier joined on loan from Toulouse. Meanwhile, talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic remains, and he is eager to pick up where he left off last season. ""My job hasn't finished. I said when I arrived at the club two years ago that I wanted to help make history at this club,"" he said. ""We're doing that and we'll continue to do so."" While it remains to be seen whether Laurent Blanc's side can get beyond the quarter-finals in the Champions League, Ibrahimovic's words will sound ominous to the rest of French football. Indeed, it is hard to see where a genuine threat can come from. Monaco spent big last year to emerge as contenders but the principality club's Russian billionaire owner Dmitry Rybolovlev will be wary of the need to make sure they fall in line with Financial Fair Play. They have a new coach, with Claudio Ranieri having been replaced by the 40-year-old Portuguese Leonardo Jardim, formerly with Sporting Lisbon. However, Colombia's James Rodriguez has gone to Real Madrid for a reported 80 million euros, and if Radamel Falcao is fit again, his future at the Stade Louis II remains shrouded in uncertainty. No major signings have come in, and Jardim, of whom little was known in France before his arrival, knows that competing with PSG will be a huge ask. ""They are the leading candidates to win the title. Once again they have strengthened their squad so it is going to be difficult to challenge them,"" he admitted. Monaco are one of seven clubs to have appointed a new coach this summer, with major changes having been made at Marseille. Last season, French football's best-supported side failed to qualify for Europe for the first time in 10 years and, in an effort to revive fortunes, excentric Argentine Marcelo Bielsa was named as coach. The 59-year-old has brought six staff members with him, plus a translator, but little is known of his early impressions of life at the Stade Velodrome -- he has yet to speak to the media. ""The objective is to finish at least third,"" said president Vincent Labrune, with a podium place carrying with it Champions League qualification, although they must cope without playmaker Mathieu Valbuena, sold to Dynamo Moscow. There is also a new coach at Lyon, with former OL defender Hubert Fournier arriving from Reims to replace Remi Garde. This will be a third consecutive campaign without Champions League football at the Stade de Gerland, and the team who dominated in the last decade are now merely outsiders for a top-three finish. Among the coaching changes elsewhere, former French internationals Willy Sagnol and Claude Makelele have taken over at Bordeaux and Bastia respectively. However, Lille and Saint-Etienne, having retained their coaches, will hope to build on top-four finishes last season and make impressions in Europe, something a French game lacking strength in depth desperately needs. Meanwhile, two famous names return, with Metz promoted alongside former champions Lens, now owned by Azerbaijani businessman Hafiz Mammadov. Nevertheless, survival will be the name of the game for them."
1111,02/08/2014,17:16,PSG cruise to Champions Trophy triumph in China,French Ligue 1 title-holders Paris Saint-Germain added the Champions Trophy to their growing list of accolades with a 2-0 win over Cup winners Guingamp in Beijing on Saturday.,"Star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored both goals inside the opening 20 minutes as the champions effectively ended the match as a contest inside the first period. ""We came here (to Beijing) because of the Champions Trophy and therefore to win it,"" said PSG coach Laurent Blanc. ""It's something very positive. The other positive is that we continued our preparation, our hard work and we didn't reduce our training programme due to today's match."" PSG were without several regular starters who are still recovering after their World Cup exertions, including captain Thiago Silva and new signing David Luiz, but Blanc used the opportunity to give some younger players a chance. ""This month of August will be quite strange as we have players arriving at different times and not everyone is in the same physical condition. ""But we have young players and it's the coach's job to have faith in them, like tonight."" It was the capital-based outfit's second successive victory in the competition, between the French champions and Cup winners, having defeated Bordeaux in Gabon in 2013. They also won the first ever edition in 1995, beating Nantes on penalties. Guingamp coach Jocelyn Gourvennec said his side's defeat was no surprise. ""PSG won in a logical manner. We had a few chances to get back into it with dead-ball situations but it was tough chasing the ball in this heat and they hold it better than us,"" he said. ""No team in France and very few in Europe manage to have more possession than PSG."" Ibrahimovic opened the scoring after just nine minutes when taking goalkeeper Mamadou Samassa by surprise with a shot from 20 yards. On 20 minutes he doubled the advantage form the penalty spot after Jean-Christophe Bahebeck was brought down by Lars Jacobsen. The big Swede was enjoying a purple patch and in the last minute tried his luck from inside his own half, although without success. Frighteningly, Blanc said there is a lot more to come from Ibrahimovic. ""Ibra is not in top form, like the rest of the team,"" said the former France coach. ""We expect to have a lot of competition from teams who are further advanced in their preparation than us but despite all that, we always want to play good football and to finish off chances, and Ibra finishes off a lot of chances for us. ""Consequently, it's not unsurprising that he made the difference and was man-of-the-match."" Guingamp's best opportunity came in the 31st minute when Brazilian centre-back Marquinhos was harshly adjudged to have brought down Claudio Beauvue, but Italian goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu, who was a virtual spectator throughout, saved Mustapha Yatabare's spot-kick. PSG begin their quest for a third straight Ligue 1 title on Friday at Reims while Guingamp host Saint-Etienne next Saturday in their opening Ligue 1 fixture of the season."
1112,31/07/2014,14:02,Cavani 'staying' at PSG despite transfer speculation,"Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani on Thursday claimed that he would not be leaving the French champions this summer, despite ongoing speculation about his future.","""I am staying, why would I not?"" said the 27-year-old Uruguay star, who only joined PSG a year ago in a Ligue 1 record deal from Napoli worth 64 million euros (£50.7m, $85.6m). ""I am very happy in Paris and I have a contract with PSG to respect,"" added Cavani, who was speaking in Beijing, where his club are due to face Guingamp on Saturday in the Champions Trophy, the French season-opener between the champions and the Cup holders. ""I feel good here. But as I have already said, it does not only depend on the position of the player but also on certain things that can happen inside a club."" Cavani scored 16 league goals in his debut Ligue 1 season but his campaign was hindered by injury and he was unhappy at not being able to play through the middle of the attack because of the presence of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Clubs in England have been linked with a move for the player, but PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has said Cavani is not for sale, despite needing to make sure his side fall into line with the demands of UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules. Of his complaints at being forced to play out of position at the Parc des Princes, Cavani said: ""The staff have responded to what I have said before. We have had some small problems regarding where I wanted to play but I feel very good about it all. ""I waited for the right moment to speak about it. Halfway through the season was not ideal. At the end of the season it was not such a big worry. ""It is important for an attacker to play in a position that is natural for him. Everyone knows what my position is and there is no point talking about it again."" After helping Uruguay reach the last 16 of the World Cup in Brazil last month and then struggling with a virus, Cavani only joined up with his club colleagues on their Asian tour on Monday. ""It is always nice to be back with your team-mates. I am happy to come back with the aim of going as far as possible in every competition. ""The club has made important signings and the main aim is to go further still in the Champions League."" Paris, who have been eliminated from the Champions League at the quarter-final stage in each of the last two seasons, have made two summer signings, recruiting Brazil defender David Luiz from Chelsea on a five-year deal and bringing in promising Toulouse full-back Serge Aurier on loan."

1117,22/07/2014,16:13,UEFA shuts PSG stands over abuse of disabled Chelsea fans,French club Paris Saint-German were ordered by UEFA to close part of their stadium as punishment for their supporters' abuse of disabled Chelsea fans during their Champions League quarter-final match in April.,"UEFA said that it had ordered a one-match closure of sectors 104 and 105 of the Parc des Princes, the club's home stadium in the French capital. ""The sanction has been imposed for the discriminatory conduct of some Paris Saint-Germain supporters towards disabled fans of Chelsea,"" UEFA said. The sanction applies to the next European club competition match in which PSG play as hosts. The Parisians have an automatic berth in the group stage of this season's Champions League and therefore go into action in September. During the April 2 first-leg quarter-final -- in which PSG beat the Londoners 3-1 -- a group of disabled Chelsea fans were seated among the home supporters due to a lack of facilities in the visitors' stands. They were subjected to a hail of abuse, spat on, and pelted with plastic bottles. ""It seemed like I was sitting in hell and it was something that I had no control over,"" Chelsea supporter Lisa Hayden, a wheelchair user, recently told the BBC. ""I felt no-one had our backs: there were 10 of us and thousands of them and I didn't think we were going to get out of there,"" she added. Chelsea won the April 8 second leg at Stamford Bridge 2-0, ejecting PSG due to the away goals rule. In May, Mike Penning, then Britain's disabilities minister, called on UEFA to consider throwing PSG out of this season's Champions League. He also pointed to the problem of seating for supporters with disabilities, which has likewise been flagged up at several English Premier League clubs. ""Disabled fans are fans and they shouldn't be treated any differently. They should be sat with their own fans and be able to enjoy the game like everyone else,"" Penning, now the policing minister, told the BBC at the time."

Eighty-seven professional footballers have broken rules banning them from betting on top French leagues, with 23 under particular scrutiny from the LFP for having placed online bets against their own teams. Ligue 1 players -- Nantes' Johan Audel and Valenciennes' Anthony Le Tallec -- are among the group accused of betting on their own teams and have also been summonsed to appear before the LFP. The hearings will take place on July 17 and 24. Under French law, sportsmen are not allowed to bet on competitions in which they are taking part."

The two big spending European giants received fines of 60 million euros ($82 million, £49 million) and had their Champions League squads reduced to 21 while Turkish trio Buraspor, Galatasaray and Trabzonspor, Russian sides Zenit St Petersburg, Anzhi Makhachkala and Rubin Kazan, and Levski Sofia from Bulgaria were also penalised. Initially hit with a further penalty of having eight homegrown players in their European squads for next season, UEFA have now reconsidered. ""Should a club be entitled to register a maximum number of 21 players on the A list, the minimum number of places exclusively reserved for 'locally trained players' shall be five instead of eight, of which a maximum of four shall be 'association-trained'"" read a UEFA statement.

1120,30/05/2014,23:33,Football: David Luiz says happy to head to PSG,"David Luiz said Friday he was happy to start a new phase of his career at Paris Saint-Germain, after they reached a deal to buy the Brazilian defender from Chelsea.","""I made a point of wrapping everything up before coming to train with the national team,"" he told journalists at Brazil's base camp outside Rio de Janeiro, where they are preparing to launch their World Cup campaign on June 12. ""It's a new phase, a new project, a new country, a new language.... I was very happy at Chelsea, I won titles, but I had arrived at the end of a cycle. I'm going to start a new cycle in Paris. ""It's going to be announced when the (transfer) window opens. But I can already say I've reached a deal with Paris and I'm very happy to be going there."" Cash-flush PSG are reportedly paying £50 million ($84 million, 61 million euros) for Luiz, a world-record fee for a defender. Asked about playing at PSG alongside Thiago Silva, he said his Brazil teammate and fellow defender was a ""marvellous person who always makes me really happy. ""We've never been rivals. He's a great leader,"" he said. At Chelsea Luiz was primarily used in a defensive midfield role by Blues manager Jose Mourinho after being unable to break up the central defensive partnership of John Terry and Gary Cahill. The 27-year-old, who joined the west Londoners from Benfica for £21.3 million in January 2011, made only 19 appearances in the Premier League this season, although he did help Chelsea eliminate PSG from the Champions League quarter-finals. lg-ybl/jhb/bc"
1121,27/05/2014,15:04,Football: Makelele signs for Bastia amid tax inquiry,Former Chelsea and Real Madrid star Claude Makelele on Tuesday signed a two-year deal to coach Ligue 1 side Bastia as a tax fraud investigation against him gathered pace.,"Swiss authorities have agreed to a French request to help with an inquiry into Makelele's assets. Makelele, 41, will take up his first full managerial post with the Corsican side, having been assistant coach at Paris Saint Germain since December 2011 with Carlo Ancelotti and then Laurent Blanc. ""It's an exciting challenge, a difficult one but I feel ready - I'll be bringing all my experience and hunger for football,"" said Makelele, who played 71 times for France. Makelele succeeds Frederic Hantz, who in a four- year spell gained Bastia promotion to Ligue 1 and a 10th place finish last term. The Swiss government's official bulletin released Tuesday announced an accord to help investigate Makelele's assets held in the UBS bank in Switzerland. When the request was made in April, Swiss media said it could be linked to Makelele's investment in the Swiss side Servette FC. Former Servette president Marc Roger, who organised the sale of a stake to Makelele in 2004, has said he owned between five and 10 percent of the club's shares. Servette went bankrupt shortly after and Roger was sentenced to a two year suspended jail term for false accounting and fraud."

""It's an exciting challenge, a difficult one but I feel ready - I'll be bringing all my experience and hunger for football,"" said the ex France international. Makelele succeeds Frederic Hantz, who in a four-year spell gained Bastia promotion to Ligue 1 with a 10th place finish last term. He will be assisted by former Bordeaux player Didier Tholot, 50, who coached Ligue 2 Châteauroux from June 2010 to late 2013."
1123,26/05/2014,02:05,Football: Atletico domestic success breaks continental mould,Atletico Madrid fans could be forgiven for feeling that there was a crushing sense of inevitability about their defeat to rivals Real in the final of the Champions League on Saturday.,"For all that Diego Simeone's side went into European football's showpiece game in Lisbon as Spanish champions, having finished three points clear of both Barcelona and Real, they remain the David against their city neighbours' Goliath and they could only continue to upset the odds for so long. At the start of the season, the bookmakers' odds on Atletico winning the Spanish title were much the same as those on Aberdeen or Motherwell pipping Celtic to the Scottish championship. Nobody could have foreseen Atletico winning the double of domestic league and Champions League. In the end, it took a 93rd-minute Sergio Ramos equaliser to save Real, who won 4-1 after extra time to lift the European Cup for the 10th time. ""This will make us better,"" vowed Atletico coach Simeone after Saturday's defeat. ""Now the rest of the world knows that Atletico can compete."" A week earlier, after winning La Liga, the Argentine had declared that ""there is no replacement for hard work"", but with a budget that is only around a quarter of that of Real and Barca, their domestic dominance may not last too long. Indeed, while they succeded in Spain, Europe's other leading leagues turned out to be more predictable than ever before. In Germany, Bayern Munich were champions in record quick time, clinching the Bundesliga title with seven games to spare and ending 19 points clear of Borussia Dortmund despite taking their foot off the accelerator in the closing weeks. They didn't lose a single match until after securing the title and went on to add the German Cup for good measure. In France, mega-rich Paris Saint-Germain confirmed their dominance as they retained the Ligue 1 title with a record 89 points, nine points more than runners-up Monaco, whose own tally was a new club record. And in Italy, the country's richest and most decorated club Juventus won a third straight title with a record tally of 102 points, finishing 17 points clear of runners-up Roma. Money is almost everything in football today. In England, Liverpool briefly appeared poised to win a first title since 1990 before Manchester City, fuelled by huge injections of cash from their Abu Dhabi-based owners, emerged to be crowned Premier League champions for the second time in three seasons. They did so by scoring 102 goals, one short of the Premier League record set by Chelsea in 2010. Liverpool were the season's hard-luck story, as they came so close to ending a 24-year wait to win a 19th English top-flight title, but having climbed from seventh to second in the space of a year their manager Brendan Rodgers was happy to label the season ""a wonderful adventure."" The likes of Laurent Blanc at PSG and Pep Guardiola at Bayern could not get away with saying that if they went one season without winning silverware. ""I get the impression that our season is only measured on what we have done in Europe. It is a bit simplistic,"" bemoaned Blanc after leading the French capital club to a domestic double, as well as a quarter-final exit from the Champions League. ""You have to win everything here, but even when you do, it's still not enough,"" admitted Guardiola, whose season featured four trophies altogether but will probably be best remembered for a Champions League semi-final hammering by Real Madrid. Madrid president Florentino Perez's exuberant celebrations in Lisbon were understandable given the spending he has sanctioned on his club's quest to win that 10th European Cup, or 'La Decima'. But with the world's two most expensive players at his disposal in Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, it was only a matter of time before they got there. Meanwhile, having broken the mould at home, and on their run in Europe, Atletico will struggle to fend off approaches from elsewhere for their best players over the summer. Their ability to do that will determine to what extent they really can compete again next season."

1126,20/05/2014,21:54,Football: Ranieri parts company with Monaco,"Italian coach Claudio Ranieri has parted company with French Ligue 1 runners-up Monaco, club vice-president Vadim Vasilyev confirmed on Tuesday.","The 62-year-old former Chelsea coach took charge at the Stade Louis II in May 2012, leading them to promotion back to the top flight last season, and had a year left to run on his contract. Principality side Monaco finished runners-up to Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1 this season, qualifying them for the Champions League. ""I can confirm the departure of Claudio Ranieri. We have taken the decision to part ways,"" Vasilyev told a press conference. ""I would like to acknowledge the very good job that Ranieri has done."" Ranieri also previously coached Serie A clubs Inter Milan, Napoli, Fiorentina, Juventus, Roma and Parma as well as Spanish outfits Atletico Madrid and Valencia. The Italian was recruited in May 2012 after the club was rescued from the point of bankruptcy by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. He returned the club to Ligue 1 and a spending spree in the past 12 months saw the arrival of Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez, Eric Abidal and Joao Moutinho. Despite guiding Monaco to second place, nine points behind PSG, Ranieri's future had been the subject of growing speculation. ""It was a difficult decision,"" Vasilyev added. ""It's never easy when the results are good. But we believe that at this stage of the project we need to find a new dynamic. ""We didn't share the same vision of the club's development. We need new ideas to build and develop our club. We're in for the long haul, there's a vision for development."" According to media reports, Monaco are in talks with Portuguese coach Leonardo Jardim, 39, who on Tuesday parted company with Sporting Lisbon after just one season in charge. However Vasilyev would not confirm the name of the new coach until certain details had been ironed out. Vasilyev added: ""I cannot confirm the name of the new coach while the details are still being sorted. ""We are looking for a modern coach who can bring new methods, who has a vision, has an attacking philosophy and who can create a good show for our supporters."" ""It's secondary for us if the coach is well-known or not."" Ranieri had one year to run on his contract, but Saturday's 1-1 draw against Bordeaux on the final day of the season proved to be his last game in charge."

Guingamp qualified for the match courtesy of their 2-0 victory over Rennes in the French Cup final. ""Paris SG have more and more fans in the region and this first tour of Asia is part of our international strategy,"" club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi said in a statement. The Trophee des Champions to be played in the Chinese capital is set to mark 50 years since diplomatic relations were established between France and China.

The French Ligue 1 champions have benefitted from a massive cash investment in top-drawer players after their takeover by Qatar Sports Investments in late 2012. But Qatari sports businessman Al-Khelaifi insisted that the sanctions by European football's governing body would have little impact next season. ""It does not change anything in the project, the motivation of the club, the players,"" he said in an interview with AFP. ""We respect, we accept this decision. But nothing and no-one will stop us, we always dream bigger."" Concerning the limit on spending for new players, he added: ""To be clear -- the players I want, I'll have them."" The 43-year-old said however that the groundwork had already been laid and there would be no big-name departures. Although they have options to buy several players, they could limit it to one, he said. ""We had a five-year plan when we bought the club, which will not change. We have great players, some among the best in the world, I don't know if we still need to buy, and it's not because of financial fair play. ""We have already invested a lot these last three years, we will continue, but when we need to."" ""Paris deserves a great club, for me it's one of the most beautiful cities in the world, it deserves a big club with big sponsors. And it's not very difficult, I'm not worried to see revenues grow. I'm confident about it."" But he brushed aside speculation around a move for Juventus' France international midfielder Paul Pogba, 21. ""Pogba is an excellent player, he's the future of the France team. But he's not the profile that we're looking for in Paris."" Their Champions League quarter-final finish was their only disappointment of the season, he said. ""I'm very satisfied, we had three trophies (Ligue 1, League Cup, Champions Trophy). I'm happy with results, we played a better style of football this season and we nearly made the Champions League semi-finals. ""I'm not going to lay the blame on anyone. We don't have Chelsea's experience, some of their players have played Champions League for the past ten years, for us it's true it was the first time. ""Zlatan (Ibrahimovic) makes the difference when he is there, he has the confidence, experience on his side."" ""But we'll be stronger next season, more motivated. We have to look ahead, towards the future, not back."" Al-Khelaifi praised coach Laurent Blanc's first season at the helm, giving his backing to the former France defender. ""I like what he's doing, he does great work, he's a professional. And contrary to what certain media have reported I haven't talked with other coaches this season."""

European places will now be allocated on the final day of the season next Saturday with Champions League and Europa League berths still up for grabs. PSG's goals came through Brazilians Marquinhos (41) and Lucas (66) and Blaise Mathuidi (83) with the titleholders bidding to close out their season on a further high at home against Montpellier next weekend. Cabaye picked up the injury late in the first half after a tackle for which Lille's France international midfielder Marvin Martin was given his marching orders. The 28-year-old was stretchered off and taken to hospital immediately for a scan, which Blanc later said had not revealed anything serious. ""The ankle is very swollen, but obviously it was more fear than harm,"" said Blanc. ""I didn't see it but yes I was scared. Obviously he must have been thinking of the World Cup."" Minutes later, Brazilian defender Marquinhos broke the deadlock with a header, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, playing for the first time in a month, missing a chance to give the visitors a two-goal advantage just before the break. Lucas got the second after 65 minutes as he picked up a cross from Argentine teammate Javier Pastore, with the Brazilian also setting up the third as Matuidi gave the Lille defence the slip behind Ibrahimovic. Midfielder Jonathan Delaplace got one back for the hosts in extra time, but it was too little too late as third-placed Lille are just two points ahead of Saint Etienne, 3-1 winners at Nantes, thanks to a Mevlut Erding double. Lyon were the big losers of the weekend as they could miss out on an 18th straight Champions League spot after losing 1-0 at home to Lorient. Lyon were reduced to ten men after just 14 minutes when Mouhamadou Dabo was red-carded, with Cheick Doukoure giving the Brittany side the only goal after 53 minutes. Lyon are fifth, just one point ahead of Marseille who shared the spoils 1-1 at Bordeaux, and could grab the final Europa League berth. Nothing is decided yet at the bottom of the table, either, although French Cup winners Guingamp secured their top flight place next season with a 2-0 win at home against Toulouse. The final Ligue 1 ticket will be decided in a winner-takes-all tie between Sochaux and Evian on Saturday after both won their ties. Sochaux won 2-1 at Rennes and Evian beat Nice 2-0."

""I think next year we will improve one or two things. We will wait to find out the Financial Fair Play punishments, but I think we will still be able to improve the team,"" said Blanc, whose side travel to Lille on Saturday knowing a win will see them set a new record for the most points in a Ligue 1 season, beating the previous best of 84, set by Lyon in 2006. ""We already have a very, very good team, a team that has been together for two years and is getting to know itself well. ""We need to target the right areas and I am convinced we will improve the squad. The club has considerable means but the solution, even without Financial Fair Play, is to improve in terms of quality. ""I don't think we need seven, eight or nine players.

The gap down to Saint-Etienne in fourth is five points, but a Lille slip-up coupled with a win for Les Verts away to Nantes will take the battle for France's last Champions League spot down to the final round of games. Nevertheless, while PSG have reigned supreme over French football this season, they have gone off the boil since being knocked out of the Champions League by Chelsea last month and have taken just four points from their last four games. On Wednesday, they were confirmed as champions just before going down to a 2-1 defeat at home to Rennes, while Lille are France's form team at the moment, on a run of 13 games without defeat. ""I don't know what frame of mind PSG will be in on Saturday,"" admitted Lille coach Rene Girard. ""Will Laurent Blanc rotate his squad? Is it a good or a bad thing that they have already won the title? Maybe some players will already be thinking about the World Cup. ""But they remain a squad full of great players, so we must just worry about ourselves and take the points we need to be sure of taking third place."" PSG coach Blanc, who on Thursday extended his contract by an extra year through to 2016, has refused to criticise his team for their poor performances in recent weeks but has urged them to go on and set a new record for the most points in a Ligue 1 season. With two games to go, Paris are only one point away from equalling Lyon's all-time record tally of 84, set in 2006, and Blanc said: ""I think this team deserves to be in the record books, but to do that we will need to get points against Lille and Montpellier."" Saint-Etienne are guaranteed Europa League football next season but two wins from their last two games would see them snatch a Champions League place if Lille took no more than one point themselves. However, Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier is more interested in making sure that his side finish above great rivals Lyon, something Les Verts have not achieved since 1993. ""Lille haven't collapsed so far and I don't see why it would happen now,"" said Galtier ahead of the visit to mid-table Nantes. ""I only want us to focus on ourselves. Our main objective is to secure fourth place."" Marseille could still pip Lyon to the final Europa League berth after winning last weekend's meeting of the clubs to move to within two points of Remi Garde's side. Lyon are at home to Lorient on Saturday while Marseille go to Bordeaux in what will be Jose Anigo's penultimate game as interim coach before Marcelo Bielsa takes over at the Stade Velodrome in the summer. At the bottom, the battle to avoid joining Valenciennes and Ajaccio in being relegated to the second tier is intensifying, with Sochaux a point adrift of safety but in fine form. Herve Renard's side are unbeaten in their last six matches and travel to Rennes, who are now safe after surprisingly beating PSG in midweek. Evian, in 17th, are at home to Nice before travelling to Sochaux on the final day of the season, while French Cup winners Guingamp, two points above the drop zone, entertain Toulouse knowing a victory will confirm their safety."
1145,08/05/2014,15:35,Football: Blanc extends PSG contract until 2016,"Laurent Blanc has extended his contract as coach of Paris Saint-Germain by one year until June 2016, the newly-crowned French champions announced on Thursday.","In his first season with PSG, Blanc not only guided the capital club to Ligue 1 success, but also victory in the League Cup and the season-opening Champions Trophy. PSG also reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the second year in succession. With 25 victories in 36 Ligue 1 matches, Blanc enjoys the highest win rate in the history of the club, which has won 39 out of 53 official matches this season. It was also his second Ligue 1 crown as a coach having guided Bordeaux to the 2009 title. ""I am very happy to continue with Paris Saint-Germain,"" said the 49-year-old Blanc, who coached the France national team between 2010-12. ""I want to be a part of this project over the long term, the most ambitious project in European football. Together, we will dream bigger."" PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi added: ""It is perfectly justified to show our confidence in Laurent Blanc. ""We are very happy with his results this season, as well as the very attractive football the team has played. We are convinced we will win a lot more trophies together."" Blanc, a 1998 World Cup winner capped 97 times by France, replaced Real Madrid-bound Carlo Ancelotti in the Parisians' dugout last summer. PSG are a more fluent, more cohesive side than 12 months ago, and Blanc deserves credit for the job he has done, especially as they were a club in turmoil when he took over following the departure of Ancelotti and the resignation of sporting director Leonardo, combined with the threatening emergence of big-spending Monaco. Blanc could scarcely have been further down the club's list of targets for the job and yet he wasted little time in finding a winning formula, settling on a 4-3-3 formation that brought the best out of the midfield trio of Thiago Motta, Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi, even if it partly meant sacrificing record signing Edinson Cavani. The Uruguayan has had to settle for a role out on the flank with Zlatan Ibrahimovic still the undisputed star of the side, but Cavani has still delivered 16 league goals, while also scoring a brace in the 2-1 League Cup final triumph over Lyon."
1146,08/05/2014,00:02,Football: PSG clinch title despite defeat,Paris Saint-Germain clinched the French league title for the second successive season on Wednesday before going down to a 2-1 home defeat against Rennes at the Parc des Princes.,"Confirmation that PSG had secured the Ligue 1 championship came through just before they kicked off their match as it emerged that nearest challengers Monaco had been held to a 1-1 draw by Guingamp, and news of the result in the principality was met with jubilation by Paris fans. The result left second-placed Monaco seven points behind PSG with only two matches of the season remaining and means that Claudio Ranieri's side will have to settle for the runners-up spot and automatic Champions League qualification. However, PSG captain Thiago Silva admitted that it was a rather strange way for his team to win the title. ""There is no sadness but it was a difficult match,"" the Brazilian defender told Canal Plus television. ""We did well for 10 months. The last month has not been good but I am very happy today. I hope we can continue like this next season and try to win the Champions League as well,"" he added. Monaco took the lead against Guingamp in the 77th minute courtesy of a strike from the in-form Dimitar Berbatov, his fifth in his last four games. However, Fatih Atik equalised for the Bretons five minutes from the end, and PSG fans cheered as it filtered through to them that Monaco had been pegged back. Guingamp, who won the French Cup by beating Rennes 2-0 in the final at the weekend, hung on for a precious draw in their fight against relegation despite having Moustapha Diallo sent off. PSG appeared buoyant at the start of their match and took the lead inside three minutes when Edinson Cavani found Ezequiel Lavezzi, who drilled home. However, Rennes recovered to equalise midway through the first half, on-loan Marseille winger Foued Kadir firing into the net through a crowd of bodies in the PSG box. Paul-Georges Ntep set up that goal, and four minutes later the France under-21 forward put Rennes in front, his free-kick from wide on the left avoiding everyone in the box as it sailed into the net at the far post. That proved to be the end of the scoring, with the home side unable to conjure an equaliser even after the introduction of Zlatan Ibrahimovic just before the hour mark, the Swede making his first appearance in a month after a thigh injury.

The result left second-placed Monaco seven points behind PSG with only two matches of the season remaining and means that Claudio Ranieri's side will have to settle for the runners-up spot and automatic Champions League qualification. Monaco took the lead against Guingamp in the 77th minute courtesy of a strike from the in-form Dimitar Berbatov, his fifth in his last four games. However, Fatih Atik equalised for the Bretons five minutes from the end, and PSG fans cheered as it filtered through to them that Monaco had been pegged back. Guingamp, who won the French Cup by beating Rennes 2-0 in the final at the weekend, hung on for a precious draw in their fight against relegation despite having Moustapha Diallo sent off. PSG appeared buoyant at the start of their match and took the lead inside three minutes when Edinson Cavani found Ezequiel Lavezzi, who drilled home. However, Rennes recovered to equalise midway through the first half, on-loan Marseille winger Foued Kadir firing into the net through a crowd of bodies in the PSG box. Paul-Georges Ntep set up that goal, and four minutes later the France under-21 forward put Rennes in front, his free-kick from wide on the left avoiding everyone in the box as it sailed into the net at the far post. That proved to be the end of the scoring, with the home side unable to conjure an equaliser even after the introduction of Zlatan Ibrahimovic just before the hour mark, the Swede making his first appearance in a month after a thigh injury.

1148,07/05/2014,23:07,Football: Five key moments in PSG's run to the title,"After Paris Saint-Germain clinched a second successive Ligue 1 title on Wednesday, AFP Sports traces five key moments that helped the French capital club retain their crown:","- After a sluggish start to the season, PSG's new coach Laurent Blanc quickly ditched the 4-4-2 formation favoured by his predecessor Carlo Ancelotti and switched to a 4-3-3. A 2-0 win at Bordeaux at the start of September was when the new system clicked and was when it became clear that Blanc had found the way to get the best out of his midfield. Thiago Motta controlled the game, Blaise Matuidi scored one goal and Marco Verratti made another. Zlatan Ibrahimovic later raved about the performance, comparing it to that produced in the 1-1 draw away to Barcelona in last season's Champions League quarter-finals. PSG were now properly up and running under Blanc, the former Bordeaux coach. - PSG looked set to suffer their first defeat of the season when they had Thiago Motta sent off and then went 1-0 down in the first half away to bitter rivals Marseille at the start of October. However, the 10 men showed superb character to equalise before the break through Maxwell, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic then scored to seal a 2-1 victory midway through the second period. A week later, they went top of the table for the first time and they were never to relinquish that position. - As impressive as Paris were, they were helped by the lack of a genuine challenger. Following their huge spending spree last summer, Monaco were the best-placed to put up a fight, but a 2-1 home loss to Valenciennes in their last outing before Christmas confirmed that Claudio Ranieri's side were not quite championship-winning material. Had they won, they would have gone into the winter break level on points with PSG. Instead they ended 2013 three points adrift and that gap continued to grow in the second half of the season. - Never was PSG's superiority over the rest of French football more evident than in the 5-0 home win against Nantes in January. That night, Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice as Blanc's men destroyed once-proud Nantes, champions eight times themselves. PSG toyed with their opponents, completing a record 863 passes, on their way to equalling their biggest winning margin of the season. - A 3-0 home win against Reims in April secured a club record eighth consecutive Ligue 1 win and left them on the brink of the title. The blow of their Champions League elimination at the hands of Chelsea a few days later slowed their domestic charge, but their relentless run into the spring gave them sufficient margin with which to play."
1149,07/05/2014,23:07,Football: Five key players in PSG's title-winning season,Paris Saint-Germain clinched their second consecutive Ligue 1 title on Wednesday after closest challengers Monaco could only draw with Guingamp.,"Here, AFP Sports selects five players who played central roles in helping PSG win the French title for the fourth time. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (SWE/forward) France's player of the year in his debut Ligue 1 season in 2012/13, the Swede has been even better this time around. He leads the Ligue 1 scorers' charts with 25 goals and has 40 goals in all competitions, breaking the previous club record of 39, set by the Argentine Carlos Bianchi in 1978. The 32-year-old is irreplaceable and scored hat-tricks in wins at home to Nice and away to Toulouse. He has also provided 11 assists, the most in the division behind James Rodriguez of Monaco. Edinson Cavani (URU/forward) Cavani has actually been a little bit of a disappointment since his arrival for a Ligue 1 record 64 million euros (£52.9m, $88.9m) last summer. However, despite being forced to spend most of his time out wide in PSG's three-man attack because Zlatan Ibrahimovic must start through the middle, and despite spending the whole of February out injured, the Uruguayan has still weighed in with his fair share of goals. He has found the net 25 times in all, including 16 in Ligue 1. Ten of those goals came in a run of 11 matches before Christmas, and his individual strike against Bastia in October is a contender for goal of the season. Thiago Motta (ITA/midfielder) The Brazilian-born Italian international midfielder is the man who truly makes PSG tick. After missing large chunks of last season due to injury, the 31-year-old Motta has hardly missed a match this time around and controls the tempo of the game in a three-man midfield which also features the energy of Blaise Matuidi and the creative spark of Marco Verratti. The textbook Motta performance came in the 2-0 home win against Bordeaux in January, when he completed 130 passes in a majestic display. That Motta didn't play in the 2-0 loss at Evian in December, one of only two defeats suffered by PSG this season, is no coincidence. After all, he has been on the losing side just three times in 57 Ligue 1 appearances for the club. Thiago Silva (BRA/centre-back) Centre-back Silva, 29, is the captain of both PSG and Brazil. While by no means the most physically imposing of defenders, his reading of the game is second to none and the former AC Milan player is considered by many as the very best in his position in the world. Spent six weeks on the sidelines in the autumn with a thigh injury but otherwise has marshalled the Paris defence and has helped them claim the best defensive record in Ligue 1 once again. Made his 50th Ligue 1 appearance for the club against Rennes on Wednesday and is a nominee for the Ligue 1 Player of the Year award along with Ibrahimovic and Motta. Gregory Van der Wiel (NED/right-back) After a difficult first season in France following his transfer from Ajax, Dutch international Van der Wiel has flourished in the current campaign. Coach Laurent Blanc puts far greater emphasis on his full-backs getting forward than his predecessor Carlo Ancelotti, and Van der Wiel's rampaging runs from right-back have been a prominent feature this season and have also helped create several important goals, including Maxwell's equaliser in the 2-1 win away to bitter rivals Marseille in October. As a result, Van der Wiel has seen off the competition from Christophe Jallet to become the first choice in the position."
1150,07/05/2014,23:05,Football: Domestic bliss eases European pain for PSG,"Paris Saint-Germain have spent vast sums over the last three years building a squad of international superstars, but a goal scored by a Paris-born striker will be remembered as the defining moment of their season.","That goal, though, was scored by PSG fan Demba Ba for Chelsea three minutes from the end of the Champions League quarter-final second-leg tie between the clubs and it took the English side into the last four on away goals. For the second season running, PSG fell just short when they stood on the brink of a place in the Champions League semi-finals, having been beaten by Barcelona, also on away goals, 12 months earlier. But this season can still go down as the best in the club's history after they won their fourth French title, and second in a row, on Wednesday, having also lifted the League Cup by beating Lyon in the final at the Stade de France last month. Progress has been made since Laurent Blanc replaced Real Madrid-bound Carlo Ancelotti in the dugout last summer, and PSG are on the verge of setting a new Ligue 1 record points tally, currently standing just one short of the previous best of 84 set by Lyon in 2006. They have also already set a new record for the most goals scored in a French top-flight season, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, having scored 40 goals in all competitions this season, beating the previous individual club best of 39 set by Carlos Bianchi in 1978. They are a more fluent, more cohesive side than 12 months ago, and Blanc deserves credit for the job he has done, especially as PSG were a club in turmoil when he took over last summer following the departure of Ancelotti to Real Madrid and the resignation of sporting director Leonardo, combined with the threatening emergence of big-spending Monaco. Blanc could scarcely have been further down the club's list of targets for the job and yet he wasted little time in finding a winning formula, settling on a 4-3-3 formation that brought the best out of the midfield trio of Thiago Motta, Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi, even if it partly meant sacrificing record signing Edinson Cavani. The Uruguayan has had to settle for a role out on the flank with Ibrahimovic still the undisputed star of the side, but Cavani has still delivered 16 league goals, while also scoring a brace in the 2-1 League Cup final triumph over Lyon. In the aftermath of the defeat to Chelsea, some doubts were raised about Blanc's suitability to lead the club on to the next level, although he has been offered an extension to his existing contract, which expires in 2015. Blanc has not yet put pen to paper, but that is surely only a matter of time now following the clinching of the first league and cup double in the club's history, to which can be added their victory in the season-opening Champions Trophy. As deep as the disappointment of exiting the Champions League was, the club's owners Qatar Sports Investments did initially set a timescale of five years to win the competition, although the spectre of punishments from UEFA in relation to their Financial Fair Play rules may set them back a little further. ""I get the impression that the Champions League is all that matters. We are making winning the French title, a national Cup and the Champions Trophy banal,"" said Blanc recently, complaining that their domestic success was being ""devalued"". Chelsea reached the last eight or further in the Champions League seven times in 12 seasons before finally winning the trophy in 2012, while Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City have yet to go beyond the last 16 in three attempts. Those experiences suggest that PSG will have to be patient before conquering Europe, all the more so now with the prospect of UEFA sanctions hanging over the Parc des Princes, but for now they can at least take some satisfaction from the fact that they reign supreme at home."

1154,06/05/2014,23:09,Football: French legend Zidane set for Bordeaux - reports,"France legend Zinedine Zidane is poised to become head coach of Ligue 1 side Bordeaux, according to reports in the French media on Tuesday.","Zidane, 41, played for Cannes, Bordeaux and Juventus before joining Real Madrid in 2001 and retiring at the age of 34 in 2006. He is currently working as an assistant to Real coach Carlo Ancelotti, and in January graduated with a diploma in sports management at the Centre for the Law and Economics of Sport in Limoges. Reports linking him to the job at Bordeaux have gathered strength this week with some papers suggesting his arrival at the Girondins was imminent. The Sud Ouest daily wrote Tuesday that Bordeaux had made Zidane ""top of their list"" to replace existing manager Francis Gillot. Gillot is under contract until 2015 with a release clause built into his deal. Bordeaux president Jean-Louis Triaud said on Tuesday: ""It's a rumour and the time is coming, when it's the moment to discuss the set up for next season we'll talk about it then."" He added: ""It's not the news for today,"" he added. French news channel I-Tele suggested the 1998 Ballon d'Or's appointment as Bordeaux boss was ""90 percent"" assured. I-Tele reported that ""Zidane had met Jean-Louis Triaud"" and that the two men ""were almost in agreement on everything"". Zidane and Triaud are set to meet up again ""by the end of the week"" to wrap up the arrangement. ""It's almost done,"" the same source reported. If it comes about Zidane will become the second 1998 French World Cup champion to manage Bordeaux after his former teammate Laurent Blanc, who was also a rookie coach, taking over the Bordeaux reins in 2007. Blanc, now in charge of defending champions Paris Saint-Germain who can win the 2013-2014 title on Wednesday, guided them to the Ligue 1 title in 2009. Zidane played for Bordeaux between 1992 and 1996. The majestic playmaker's last game was with the French team in the 2006 World Cup final in Berlin against Italy, when he scored a goal but was then sent off in the second half for head-butting Marco Materazzi. Bordeaux are placed seventh in L1 ahead of the visit of Marseille on Saturday for their penultimate game of the season."

""We had the perfect match,"" said Guingamp coach Jocelyn Gourvennec, whose side also qualified for the Europa League as a result. ""To win a second (Cup) in five years isn't easy,"" added the former Rennes playmaker whose side also won in 2009 against the same opponents. ""We controlled very well and were very disciplined."" Jonathan Martins Pereira got the opener after 37 minutes when he latched onto a Christophe Mandanne header to catapult into the net. And Mali international striker Mustapha Yatabare claimed the second just after the break when he slipped through the Rennes defence to shock goalkeeper Benoit Costil with a close range header for his eighth goal in the competition. Costil held firm however after 53 minutes with a nice save which deprived Yatabare of a second goal of the night. It was the third victory this season for Guingamp over their fellow Bretons whom they beat twice in the league, and another woeful end for Rennes who also lost the 2009 French Cup final against the same side, who were then in the second tier. Rennes were also beaten by Saint-Etienne in last season's League Cup final, leaving them still without a major title since beating Lyon to lift the Cup back in 1971. It is a dire record for Rennes which hails from the capital of Brittany with a population of 207,000 and owned by billionaire Francois Pinault. Guingamp -- the club where Didier Drogba shot to prominence -- have a population of little more than 7,000. It was their third Cup final after losing the 1997 title match to Nice. Gourvennec, who achieved as a coach what he failed to win during his playing career, is now turning his focus to the fight against relegation.

As well as Ibrahimovic, champions-elect PSG also have central defender and skipper Thiago Silva and Italy midfielder Thiago Motta in the running for the prize, with the fourth and final nominee Monaco's Colombian playmaker James Rodriguez. The latter is also nominated for young player of the year along with his Monaco colleague, the left-back Layvin Kurzawa, PSG midfielder Marco Verratti and Toulouse's Ivory Coast defender Serge Aurier. The winners will be announced at a ceremony on Sunday, May 11."
1159,25/04/2014,02:29,Football: PSG on brink of second straight Ligue 1 crown,Paris Saint-Germain can wrap up their second straight Ligue 1 title this weekend as relegation-threated Sochaux provide what could be their final obstacle on Sunday.,"A 10-point lead, following a sparkling domestic campaign which has seen Laurent Blanc's side suffer just two defeats, means the title is theirs with a lunch-time win away to Sochaux or 24 hours earlier if Monaco lose at relegated Ajaccio. Herve Renard, the flamboyant Sochaux coach who memorably led Zambia to their first African championship in 2012, has worked miracles to lift his men within three points of safety after taking over in mid-season. The Frenchman would ideally hope PSG arrive at the Stade Auguste Bonal with the title wrapped up and in relaxed mood to face his players, who he told recently to ""never give up"" in their remarkable bid to avoid the drop. While PSG's season was severely damaged by their Champions League quarter-final exit against Chelsea, a 2-1 victory in the League Cup final last weekend over Lyon and a laboured 1-0 midweek win over Evian has helped lift the gloom of another failed European campaign. Blanc was hardly satisfied by the form of his players on Wednesday and is just eager to tie up the title race before deciding on his own future for next season. ""It wasn't our best match of course but we got the job done,"" said Blanc, following Blaise Matuidi's late winner against Evian. ""We have to improve (against Sochaux) or we'll have the same problems and it's up to the players and staff to think about this. ""Nothing is ever accomplished in football if you don't put in the necessary ingredients,"" continued the former Bordeaux and France coach. ""I have told the players that the title isn't won yet and we're still missing that final little effort but nothing is ever easy. While few, if any, believe PSG can self-destruct from their position of power, a celebration has already been planned for the final day of the season on May 18 when Montpellier come to the capital's cauldron. After the ugly scenes of violence and hooliganism that marred their trophy celebration last year, it has already decided there will be no party in the streets of Paris this time around. Elsewhere, Lille have a stranglehold on third spot and carry a seven point advantage to Bordeaux, while their closest pursuers Saint-Etienne cling to a Europa League spot by just two points over bitter rivals Lyon. Saint-Etienne are on the road at Evian on Saturday while Lyon, who were held 0-0 by Toulouse in midweek, host Bastia at their Stade Gerland 24 hours later. French Cup finalists Guingamp have been sucked into a relegation dogfight and host an equally desperate Valenciennes outfit in a massive match to keep surging Sochaux at bay. The Brittany club are just two points above Renard's side while Valenciennes are a further four adrift. Nantes host Marseille in the only match on Friday while Lorient make the short trip to Rennes, Montpellier host Toulouse and Reims head south to Nice in the other Saturday fixtures.

1160,23/04/2014,21:24,Football: Late Matuidi goal gives laboured PSG victory,Blaise Matuidi struck in the 89th minute to give Paris Saint-Germain a 1-0 win against struggling Evian at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday and take the capital club to the brink of the title.,"It looked like PSG would have to settle for a point against their 10-man opponents until Lucas played in fellow substitute Matuidi and the France midfielder slotted the ball through the legs of goalkeeper Jesper Hansen at the near post. The result leaves the reigning champions 10 points clear of nearest challengers Monaco with only four games remaining and means they can clinch a second consecutive title with a win away to Sochaux on Sunday, or 24 hours earlier if Monaco lose at relegated Ajaccio. However, the nature of the performance left coach Laurent Blanc far from satisfied at full time. ""The first half was very bad. We appeared to be lacking in motivation and were very slow moving the ball,"" said Blanc. ""There wasn't enough movement and Evian could even have been in front. We had a word with the players at half-time and the second period was better. ""Of course it wasn't our best performance but we did the job in the end."" Fresh from winning the League Cup by beating Lyon 2-1 in the final last Saturday, Blanc's side were looking for revenge on Evian, who beat them 2-0 in the reverse fixture back in December. Evian are still scrapping to avoid relegation but they have performed well against the leading lights in Ligue 1 this season, taking four points out of a possible six against Monaco and also holding Lille. They were unlucky not to take an early lead as well, Danish international Daniel Wass hitting the crossbar from a long-range free-kick in the fifth minute. Wass then forced home goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu into a good save from a header shortly after, as a PSG team still missing injured top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic and showing seven changes from that which beat Lyon struggled to find their rhythm. When they did, Hansen raced off his line to deny Ezequiel Lavezzi and young midfielder Adrien Rabiot fired over as the first half ended goalless. The early kick-off meant the Parc des Princes stands did not really fill up until the second half, but most of the drama was saved for after the restart. Lavezzi was unable to convert a Rabiot cutback from inside the six-yard box before Evian were reduced to 10 men with an hour played when former Marseille defender Kassim Abdallah picked up a second yellow card for a foul on Lucas Digne. Visiting coach Pascal Dupraz shook his head on the touchline, mindful of the onslaught that was to come, but Hansen saved from Lavezzi and Matuidi somehow missed the target after the Evian defence made a hash of dealing with a low ball across goal by the Argentine forward. It looked as if Evian would hold on until, with just a minute remaining, Matuidi struck his fourth goal of the season much to the relief of the home fans. Meanwhile, Lyon had to settle for a 0-0 draw away to Toulouse, a result which leaves Remi Garde's side in fifth spot, two points behind rivals Saint-Etienne and three clear of Marseille in sixth. OL must finish in the top five to qualify for next season's Europa League."

It is the second trophy won by the club from the French capital since their takeover by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011 and subsequent transformation into one of the wealthiest clubs in Europe, following their title triumph last season. And their League Cup victory -- their fourth in the 20-year history of the competition -- could be followed by another Ligue 1 crown as early as next Wednesday, although they must hope nearest rivals Monaco lose on Sunday for that to happen. ""It is a privilege and an honour to play in a final but you have to win it, and we won it,"" said Blanc. ""It was difficult because Lyon were very good, especially in the second half. We're having a good season but for people to remember it we had to win titles and that's the first one."" PSG had been in the doldrums following their Champions League quarter-final exit to Chelsea at the start of the month and their 1-0 loss in Lyon last weekend had heaped pressure on Blanc, even if it did little real damage to their championship aspirations. Two consecutive games without scoring since the loss of 40-goal leading scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic to injury had also increased the pressure on misfiring record signing Cavani, but the Uruguayan produced a superb first-half display in which he scored twice and could have had two more goals. The opener arrived with exactly three minutes played, Maxwell playing a one-two with Ezequiel Lavezzi and dinking the ball over advancing Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes for Cavani to poke home. Lyon, back at the Stade de France for the first time since winning the French Cup two years ago, might have equalised moments later, but Bafetimbi Gomis hit the side-netting after good work from his strike partner Lacazette. Gomis then headed an Arnold Mvuemba corner straight at Nicolas Douchez, who was preferred in goal to regular PSG first-choice 'keeper Salvatore Sirigu, just as he had been in the earlier rounds of the competition. However, Paris were on top and Cavani was unlucky not to score with a superb first-time volley from 25 yards that was spectacularly saved by Lopes. Brazilian defender Alex then had the ball in the net following a Lavezzi free-kick only for the offside flag to cut short the PSG celebrations, but they increased their lead from a controversial penalty incident just after the half-hour mark. Lucas got to a long ball forward from Thiago Silva in front of Lopes only to go down under minimal contact from the Portuguese goalkeeper. The incident appeared to take place just outside the box but the referee awarded a penalty, and while Lopes escaped a red card he could do nothing to keep out Cavani's emphatically struck kick from 12 yards, leaving OL with an uphill struggle to get back into the game. ""I'm very disappointed,"" said Lyon coach Remi Garde. ""It's sad to lose a final due to a glaring error like that. What do you want me to say?"" For Cavani, it was his 24th goal of the season, although he then squandered a good opportunity to complete his hat-trick when he blazed over after a piercing run by Lucas. Lyon were down and out at half-time but Garde made a tactical switch eight minutes after the restart, replacing right-back Mouhamadou Dabo with another forward in Jimmy Briand. Lacazette was moved across to the left and three minutes later he collected possession on the flank and cut inside before beating Douchez with a low shot from 20 yards. However, an effort from substitute Nabil Fekir that hit the side-netting was as close as OL came to equalising."

1165,18/04/2014,02:25,Football: Pressure on PSG ahead of Lyon final date,"If they had their way, France's leading clubs would have done away with the League Cup a long time ago, but Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon both need the boost of winning Saturday's final.","The sides meet at the Stade de France in the final of the country's secondary knockout competition just six days after Lyon beat the capital club 1-0 at the Stade de Gerland in Ligue 1. Under normal circumstances, PSG would be the heavy favourites, but a difficult last 10 days have considerably increased the pressure on Laurent Blanc's side. Following the agony of their Champions League elimination at the quarter-final stage on away goals to Chelsea, Paris saw their run of eight consecutive league wins ended in Lyon, a result that means they will have to wait until next Wednesday's meeting with Evian at the earliest before retaining the title. But if another Ligue 1 crown is inevitable, Blanc knows his team must win the oft-derided League Cup -- a trophy the club have won three times before -- if they are to improve on their record last season under Carlo Ancelotti. ""The last week has been difficult. That's the way it is. We have to move on,"" says midfielder Yohan Cabaye. ""We have the chance to play for a title. It's a different competition and there is no doubt that the players are ready and determined."" Failure could have serious consequences for the coach himself, who has said he will not give a definitive answer to the offer of a contract extension until after the final. The former France coach has another year remaining but the recent run of back-to-back defeats, something the club had not experienced since 2011, has led to speculation that he could be sacked and forced president Nasser Al-Khelaifi to give him the dreaded vote of confidence this week. ""He is our coach today and I insist that I want him to stay. I was very clear about that before the second leg of the Champions League tie against Chelsea and my opinion did not change after that match,"" Al-Khelaifi told daily Le Parisien. ""Laurent Blanc has my unconditional support and nothing that happens on the field can change that."" Despite beating PSG last Sunday, Lyon are currently in fifth place in Ligue 1 and are at risk of finishing beneath their bitter rivals Saint-Etienne as well as missing out on Champions League qualification once again. Knocked out of the Europa League by Juventus last week, this could still go down as a successful season for OL if they can secure the League Cup, a trophy they have only won once before. Remi Garde, who oversaw Lyon's French Cup triumph two years ago when they also lost the League Cup final to Marseille, is confident despite a raft of absences for what will be his team's 56th match of a long season. ""The spirit of the team is great at the moment. It was important for us to win ahead of the final,"" he said in reference to last week's win against the same opponents, which was secured by a goal from young midfielder Jordan Ferri. He is suspended this weekend, while Gueida Fofana, Yoann Gourcuff and Clement Grenier are injured, leaving Lyon particularly light on options in midfield. However, it is the absence of another player that could have the most profound impact on the showpiece, as Lyon bid to repeat their victory against PSG in the final of the French Cup in 2008, when a Sidney Govou goal in extra time secured them a 1-0 win and a league and cup double. PSG are still without 40-goal top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is in Sweden recovering from the thigh injury suffered against Chelsea. There has been a noticeable drop in form from PSG in the games they have played without Ibrahimovic since he arrived in France at the start of last season. They have lost five of the 16 matches he has missed in that time. This season they have lost five games -- four of them without Ibrahimovic in the line-up."
1166,14/04/2014,19:10,"Football: Ranieri focussed on semi-final, not on future",Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri knows that the best way to respond to ongoing speculation about his future is to finish the season by winning silverware.,"The principality club travel to Ligue 1 strugglers Guingamp on Wednesday in the semi-finals of the French Cup and are huge favourites to lift the trophy at the Stade de France next month with Paris Saint-Germain already out. They are also second in Ligue 1, although a 10-point deficit to PSG with five games remaining means it is only a matter of time before the capital club win the title. Ranieri has done very little wrong since taking charge at the Stade Louis II, leading them to promotion back to the top flight last season, and he has a year left to run on his contract. However, that has not dampened speculation that the club's billionaire majority shareholder Dmitry Rybolovlev will seek to replace the Italian in the summer, with reports last week linking him with an approach for France great, and current Real Madrid assistant, Zinedine Zidane. ""I don't know if I'll be the coach of Monaco next season,"" said Ranieri. ""But I want to win the French Cup and finish as close to PSG as possible. When the team wins, it's better for everyone."" He added: ""I love football, I love my job and I am very serious about my work. But I acknowledge that it's very difficult to have a career like (Arsene) Wenger or (Alex) Ferguson with a club today."" Monaco, who have won the French Cup five times but not since 1991 when Wenger was the coach, will be without promising left-back Layvin Kurzawa due to injury. His absence is a blow as Monaco attempt to handle the pressure that comes with being favourites against a Guingamp side who have lost their last four matches in Ligue 1. ""We are the big favourites to win the Cup, which is to be expected. The pressure will be on us,"" said Ranieri, although Guingamp will be looking to return to the final of a competition they won as a second-tier side in 2009. On that occasion they stunned their Brittany neighbours Rennes at the Stade de France, and there is a possibility that the clubs could meet again in the final this season. Rennes, who have not won a major trophy since the 1971 French Cup, play second-tier Angers in the first semi-final on Tuesday at the Stade de la Route de Lorient. The Bretons have had a difficult season under Philippe Montanier, who has found life tough since arriving last summer from Real Sociedad, where he was named coach of the year in La Liga. His team lie 14th in the table, meaning they are at risk of finishing in their lowest position in more than a decade, so a lot is riding on Cup success. ""There is a lot at stake,"" said Montanier. ""This club has had a rather strange relationship with the Cup. We can feel the weight of expectation. ""We need to focus on the game rather than what is at stake. We have gone through some difficult times but if we had been offered the chance at the start of the season to play a semi-final in our own stadium we would have taken it immediately."" Angers are bidding to reach the final for the first time since 1957, although their main aim this season is to win promotion to the top flight. Fixtures (both 1900 GMT)"

1169,12/04/2014,22:13,Football: Monaco win means PSG must wait,Monaco's 1-0 win at Rennes on Saturday means Paris Saint-Germain will have to wait a little longer before securing a second straight Ligue 1 title.,"A Monaco defeat in Brittany would have left PSG in a position to secure the championship on Sunday with a win away to Lyon, where they won the title last year, but a solitary strike by Emmanuel Riviere early in the second half gave the principality club the points. Monaco are now 10 points adrift of PSG with five matches remaining, although they are more interested in keeping Lille in third at arm's length. Lille won 1-0 at home to local rivals Valenciennes earlier thanks to a second-half Divock Origi goal, a result that put them eight points clear of fourth-placed Saint-Etienne, who go to Reims on Sunday. Only the top two teams go straight into next season's Champions League group stage, with the third-placed side having to go through two qualifying rounds to get there and fourth having to settle for the Europa League. Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri dropped skipper Eric Abidal for the match at the Stade de la Route de Lorient, while goalkeeper Danijel Subasic missed a league game for the first time this season. The Croatian was replaced in the starting line-up by Argentine international Sergio Romero, who kept a clean sheet on his Ligue 1 debut. Only a great save by Benoit Costil at the other end prevented Layvin Kurzawa from giving Monaco the lead in the first half, but the game's only goal arrived 10 minutes into the second half, Jeremy Toulalan setting up Riviere to score his 10th league goal of the campaign. Monaco now turn their attentions to Wednesday's French Cup semi-final against Guingamp, and they could end up meeting Rennes again in the final, with Philippe Montanier's side facing Angers in the other semi. In Lille, the only goal of the game came for the hosts 20 minutes from time when Salomon Kalou set up Belgian forward Origi, whose shot was deflected into the net off Valenciennes defender Carl Medjani. The visitors were furious at not being awarded a foul when Simon Kjaer caught Tongo Hamed Doumbia at the other end in the build-up, and they remain eight points adrift of safety with time running out to avoid relegation. After what was their ninth 1-0 win this season, Lille coach Rene Girard insisted catching big-spending Monaco is not in his thoughts. ""It is not our objective but if they slip up we will be there. The important thing is to worry about ourselves and to keep going,"" said Girard, whose team have a difficult run of fixtures to finish the season, including a trip to Marseille and a home meeting with PSG. ""The end of the season will be tough, but it was good to win tonight to keep us in the running."" Elsewhere, Ajaccio came from behind to draw 1-1 against Bordeaux, with Mehdi Mostefa's late equaliser earning them a draw that postpones their inevitable relegation back to the second tier. However, they will be down if Guingamp claim a point at Nantes on Sunday. Sochaux kept their survival hopes alive with a 2-0 win against Toulouse, but Evian stay well clear of the drop zone after a 2-1 win against Bastia, while Vincent Aboubakar scored in injury time to give Lorient a 2-1 win at Nice. Dimitri Payet's late goal handed Marseille a 3-2 win at Montpellier on Friday night under the watchful eye of Marcelo Bielsa, the former Argentina coach who is being tipped to take over from interim coach Jose Anigo at the Stade Velodrome."
1170,12/04/2014,17:33,Football: Blanc to wait before deciding on new contract,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc says he will wait until after next weekend's League Cup final against Lyon before deciding whether to accept the offer of a new contract.,"Blanc's existing deal is due to expire at the end of next season but negotiations about an extension have been ongoing for some time. His credit took a serious knock with Tuesday's exit from the Champions League to Chelsea at the quarter-final stage, but PSG could secure a second consecutive Ligue 1 title by beating Lyon on Sunday, as long as Monaco lose away to Rennes on Saturday. And the capital club will play Lyon again next Saturday at the Stade de France, so Blanc admits he is focussing purely on the field at the moment. ""I have the offer of a contract but we will wait because there are more important things to worry about on the pitch,"" he said at a press conference on Saturday. ""I will give an answer in 10 days. ""I decided myself that we had something to finish on the field before finalising my extension. I don't want to be distracted by the games that await us. I am very happy in Paris and very, very motivated by what's happening on the pitch."" Blanc added that the days following their Champions League exit have been difficult but said that he is motivated by what is left to play for before the end of the campaign. ""It wasn't easy. The lads were very, very disappointed. Everyone was affected by the elimination,"" said the former France defender. ""The Champions League is a dream. Wednesday and Thursday were not very enjoyable. Now we need to move on. There could be worse ways to end the season. ""We still have the chance to win two trophies. We have got ourselves into a position to win these titles when we could have been left with nothing to play for. ""I get the impression that the Champions League is all that matters. We are making winning the French title, a national Cup and the Champions Trophy banal. The players know that they need to finish the season well."" He added: ""Lyon are a very good team. It is a good thing to have them coming up. Lyon played well in both games against Juventus."""
1171,11/04/2014,02:25,Football: PSG hope to seal title after European disaster,"While the thumping hangover following Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League exit in midweek still lingers, the capital club might be able to sooth the pain by securing the Ligue 1 title on Sunday.","Laurent Blanc's expensively-assembled squad were within minutes of the semi-final spot they so badly craved at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge before a late Demba Ba strike took the Londoners through on away goals and plunged PSG into depression. They must now turn their attentions to putting the finishing touches on an almost perfect domestic campaign, and they stand on the brink of a fourth French title as they travel to Lyon on Sunday night. Nearest challengers Monaco sit 13 points adrift in second place with six games to go, and if they lose away to Rennes on Saturday, the path will be clear for PSG to win a second straight championship by beating Lyon at the Stade de Gerland, the same venue where they wrapped up the title last year. The match against Remi Garde's fifth-placed Lyon side will also serve as a rehearsal for the League Cup final between the two teams at the Stade de France on Saturday, April 19. Blanc's reported contract extension past 2015 appeared a formality before the derailment in London but with the club's Qatari owners craving Champions League success, reports this week suggest that he could yet be axed. The coach and his squad have been hit badly by the end of their European adventure and training was cancelled the day after the match as the club got to grips with their defeat. Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani was targeted as one of the players to underperform on the biggest stage and much has been said of their lack of experience needed to win Europe's biggest competition. ""Difficult to accept a result like that,"" Cavani tweeted after the match. ""We now have to concentrate on our other objectives."" They will be facing a Lyon side who were also eliminated from Europe this week, losing 2-1 away to Juventus in the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final tie to bow out 3-1 on aggregate. Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri will be keen to maintain their six-point lead over third-placed Lille while Saint-Etienne in fourth must win at Reims to keep their slim hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League alive. Les Verts faltered badly last week when they were held to a 1-1 home draw by Nice and a five-point deficit to Lille needs to be reduced quickly if they hope to return to the European Cup for the first time since 1981. Lille entertain relegation-threatened Valenciennes in a local derby in Saturday's early match. Meanwhile, Marseille make the short trip to Montpellier on Friday and coach Jose Anigo admitted this week he may have made a mistake in taking the job back in December after coming in for a torrent of abuse last weekend during the 3-1 home win against Ajaccio. Anigo, who will return to his primary role of sporting director in the summer, has endured a difficult time since the murder of his son Adrien back in September. ""There has been a form of disrespect and forgetfulness from the fans, so yes you can ask the question,"" he replied when asked whether he regretted taking the job when Elie Baup was sacked. ""Did I make the right decision to offer my services to the club because I got nothing in return and I didn't make more money? ""I possibly got it wrong but I am curious to see how it's going to finish for me."" Elsewhere, Ajaccio will be relegated on Saturday if they lose at home to Bordeaux. Fixtures (all kick-offs 1800GMT unless stated)"
1172,07/04/2014,02:10,Football: Chelsea seek Napoli repeat in PSG rescue bid,Chelsea will hope to draw inspiration from their 2012 Champions League triumph when they attempt to overturn a 3-1 deficit in their quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday.,"Javier Pastore's 90th-minute solo goal in last week's first leg at Parc des Princes gave PSG a two-goal advantage that puts them firmly in control of the tie ahead of the second leg at Stamford Bridge. Only 24 percent of the teams to have lost 3-1 in the away leg of a UEFA tie since 1970 have gone on to reach the next round, but Chelsea can take heart from the fact that they pulled off just such a feat two years ago. A 3-1 defeat at Napoli in the last 16 precipitated the sacking of coach Andre Villas-Boas, but his successor, Roberto Di Matteo, oversaw a 4-1 win after extra time in the return leg, before leading the west London club to victory on penalties over Bayern Munich in the final. Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho has never lost a European quarter-final, and defeat by PSG would be doubly difficult for the Portuguese to swallow in the light of Di Matteo's achievement in 2012 and last year's Europa League success under interim manager Rafael Benitez. Furthermore, with Chelsea's Premier League title challenge wobbling, success in the Champions League has taken on even greater importance. Chelsea breezed to a 3-0 win over Stoke City on Saturday, briefly taking them back to the top of the table, but Mourinho insists that their position is ""fake"" due to the fact that rivals Manchester City still have two games in hand. He is nevertheless relishing the prospect of Tuesday's game beneath the lights in west London, declaring that his side can approach the match ""without fear"". ""I want to enjoy that game. I enjoy the difficulty,"" Mourinho said. ""Now we know that we need to win 2-0, 3-1, 4-1, 5-2. We know that we need a crazy result against Paris. We must be ready to go without fear, go at them, and see what happens. ""If we have to lose after a magnificent night of football, a magnificent night of emotion, we have to lose."" Chelsea have kept eight consecutive clean sheets at Stamford Bridge, but PSG are on a club-record run of 11 successive wins and have lost by two clear goals only once in their last 110 fixtures. Chelsea will be missing the suspended Ramires and are also likely to still be without Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o, who missed the first leg with a hamstring injury and did not feature against Stoke on Saturday. Mourinho, who bemoaned the lack of ""real strikers"" in his squad after the first leg, is therefore expected to select Fernando Torres at the tip of his attack, after Andre Schurrle failed to convince in a 'false nine' role at Parc des Princes. PSG also have problems up front, with talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic unavailable after injuring his thigh in the first leg, but in record signing Edinson Cavani, the French champions have an able deputy. With the Uruguay international set to replace Ibrahimovic at centre-forward, Lucas Moura is in line to come into the team on the right flank. PSG coach Laurent Blanc had the luxury of being able to rest almost his entire first-choice starting XI in Saturday's 3-0 win over Reims, with right-back Gregory van der Wiel making his first appearance for a month. However, Blanc is reluctant to meddle with a winning team and said that Christophe Jallet was likely to continue on the right flank of his side's defence. ""Van der Wiel's return, which I hadn't necessarily anticipated, gives me competition on the right with Jallet and even Marquinhos, who I tried at the end of the match (against Reims),"" said Blanc. ""Having said that, I already have a team line-up in mind, so we'll now have to see how the guys recover."" Beaten by Barcelona in the quarter-finals last season, PSG are seeking to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 1995."
1173,04/04/2014,21:32,Football: France sells TV rights for nearly $1 billion,"France's top football league sold domestic television rights for 2016-20 for a record sum of nearly one billion dollars a year, officials said Friday.","The new deal saw Ligue 1 sold for 726 million euros ($994 million) a year and the second division for 22 million euros a year. The Canal Plus cable television broadcaster made the biggest offer to secure the right to the first choice of the two best Ligue 1 matches each week. The previous record for 2008-2012 sold for 668 million euros a year while this season and next the figure falls to 607 million euros. But with Qatari and Russian investors now ploughing huge sums into Ligue 1 clubs -- allowing Paris Saint Germain to buy Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Monaco Radamel Falcao for a combined figure over 120 million euros -- the French Professional League (LFP) had hoped for more. ""I had wanted to put the French championship in the top three in Europe,"" said LFP president Frederic Thieriez, who added that the figure was below but close to what the league had sought. ""I would have liked more because I have big ambitions for French football, but the market has spoken,"" he added. BeIn Sports, a Qatari-backed cable broadcaster, was the second highest bidder. None of the other competitors, such as Eurosport or telecoms firm Orange, won any television rights. The auction put France in fourth place in the European television rights league -- ahead of Germany (675m euros), but behind Spain (750m), Italy (960m) and especially England's Premier League, which earns a massive 1.7 billion euros a year. The LFP had set a reserve price above the 726 million euros announced, but it was not immediately revealed how much they wanted. Thiriez said only that the offers by Canal Plus and BeIn Sport were ""very close"" with tens of millions of euros between them. According to sources close to negotiations, Canal Plus will increase payments from their current 420 million euros a year to about 550 million. BeIn has been paying about 150 million euros a year. Its new deal was not revealed. BeIn could be saving its financial power for bids to UEFA, Europe's governing body, for the 2015-2018 rights to the Champions League, which have to be handed in on Monday, analysts said. Despite the arrival of the Qatar Investment Authority to bankroll PSG and Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev at Monaco, French clubs say they face growing financial difficulties as they battle to pay top salaries to help them compete in Europe. While PSG are close to qualifying for the semi-finals of Europe's Champions League, other clubs are deep in debt. The French government has put football stars in the group that will have to pay a 75 percent tax on the highest salaries. The French league estimates this will cost clubs 44 million euros a year."
1174,04/04/2014,02:26,Football: PSG look for Cavani to step forward in Ibra absence,Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain will hope that record signing Edinson Cavani can fill the void left by the absence of injured top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic as they prepare to host Reims on Saturday.,"The meeting with the club from the Champagne country comes in between the two legs of the Champions League quarter-final against Chelsea, with Laurent Blanc's side leading 3-1 ahead of Tuesday's return at Stamford Bridge. And given that the capital club sit 13 points clear of nearest challengers Monaco at the top of the table with just seven games left, Blanc is bound to give a rest to some of his key players with Chelsea in mind. One man who will definitely miss the game is Ibrahimovic, who is set for a spell on the sidelines after coming off in the second half against Chelsea with an injury to the back of his right thigh. ""I just hope he comes back quickly because we will need him,"" admitted Blanc of the Swede, who has scored a club record 40 goals in all competitions so far this season. However, one man who stands to benefit from Ibrahimovic's misfortune is Cavani, the Uruguayan who cost 64 million euros (£52.9m, $87.7m) from Napoli last summer. Cavani has scored 21 goals altogether in his debut season in France, but he has only three in an injury-hit 2014 and earlier this week he admitted his displeasure at having to play on the wing in a 4-3-3 formation. ""For a striker who is used to finishing chances, having to fulfil other tasks is not easy,"" he told sports daily L'Equipe, before adding: ""There are things that I need to talk about with the club, things that need to be done differently."" Paris are on a club record-breaking run of 10 consecutive wins in all competitions and have not lost at home in the league since November 2012, so it would be a huge shock if they failed to record a positive result this weekend. Opponents Reims have twice reached the European Cup final themselves, including in the first ever final in 1956, when they were beaten 4-3 by Real Madrid at the Parc des Princes. These days their aims are rather more modest, but they are enjoying an excellent season under coach Hubert Fournier and come into the weekend just a point behind Marseille in sixth. ""It will be difficult, we can't hide that. But we are going to the Parc to get a result,"" insisted Reims' Cape Verde winger Odair Fortes. Elsewhere, second-placed Monaco will look to bounce back from a shock defeat at Evian last weekend when they host Nantes on Sunday, with the principality club's coach Claudio Ranieri sweating on the fitness of Layvin Kurzawa, Joao Moutinho and James Rodriguez. Lille are just six points behind Monaco in third but they face a tricky test at Toulouse, whose five-game unbeaten run means that a top-five finish, and possible European qualification, is not out of the question. ""Europe is not a taboo word for us and it's great that the players are talking about it,"" said Toulouse coach Alain Casanova last week. ""But talking about it and actually going out and doing it are two different things."" The south-western side are poor at home, though, having won just one of their last eight games in front of their own fans. Fresh from winning last week's Rhone derby at Lyon, Saint-Etienne in fourth continue their push for a podium finish and a Champions League berth when they host Nice, while Lyon go to struggling Valenciennes in between the two legs of their Europa League quarter-final against Juventus. Meanwhile, Lorient entertain Evian amid ongoing uncertainty about the future of their long-serving coach Christian Gourcuff, who has been linked with a move to take over the Algerian national team."
1175,03/04/2014,02:09,Football: Mourinho left with regrets as Chelsea lose in Paris,"Chelsea manager José Mourinho criticised his team's sloppy defending and lack of a cutting edge after they went down 3-1 to Paris Saint-Germain in their Champions League quarter-final, first leg on Wednesday.","The Premier League side recovered from the loss of an early Ezequiel Lavezzi goal to equalise courtesy of an Eden Hazard penalty just before the half-hour mark and the Belgian also struck the post before half-time. However, PSG seized the initiative again in the second period and a David Luiz own goal put them back in front before Javier Pastore's stoppage-time effort handed the Ligue 1 leaders a potentially decisive two-goal advantage heading into next Tuesday's return at Stamford Bridge. ""I think by the strategical point of view the team had great discipline, and the most difficult things to do in the game they did very well,"" said Mourinho, who is looking to become the first coach to win the European Cup with three different clubs following previous triumphs with Porto and Inter Milan. ""They stopped (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic. (Edinson) Cavani was under control. The positional play from (Thiago) Motta and (Marco) Verratti in the centre of the pitch was completely under control. ""But we couldn't transform the half-chances that we created into goals and on top of that we made defensive mistakes, individidual defensive mistakes. So we paid the price."" The opening goal came from a poor defensive header by Chelsea captain John Terry while David Luiz gave away the free-kick which led to his own goal and goalkeeper Petr Cech was beaten at his near post for Pastore's third. ""In the first goal the ball goes to Lavezzi - control, half-volley, boom. It's like this at this level - one chance, one goal,"" admitted Mourinho. ""The game was under control and we had the chance to go 2-1 up at the end of the first half. But we didn't score and then after that we scored in our own goal and after that the third goal, it was a joke. It was not a goal it was a joke."" The Portuguese also confirmed that his decision to select winger Andre Schuerrle in attack rather than Fernando Torres in the absence of the injured Samuel Eto'o reflected a lack of confidence in his mis-firing strikers. ""I'm not happy with my strikers' performances, so I have to try things, and with Andre at least we know we have one more player to associate with the other players. ""But football is not just about that. It's about scoring goals and getting in behind. And that is for strikers, real strikers."" Mourinho, who insisted that his team have ""nothing to lose now"" must wish that he could be reunited with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the PSG striker who played for him at Inter in 2008-09. The Swede, who has scored 40 goals in all competitions this season, is a doubt for the second leg, however, after coming off with what looked like a thigh injury in the second half at the Parc des Princes, but PSG can still call on Cavani, Lavezzi and Pastore, among others. And the French club's coach Laurent Blanc singled out Lavezzi for praise after the Argentinian produced an outstanding performance and also lauded his team for their second-half display. ""Ezequiel is back on top form now and he brings us depth and pace in attack. And on top of that he got a goal - and a forward always gets a better mark when they get a goal,"" said the former France defender. ""The performance was encouraging. At half-time maybe some were wondering if we were really up to the level of Chelsea but we had a very constructive discussion at half-time, we knew we had to work harder and be more disciplined in midfield, and the second half was excellent."" On the significance of Pastore's goal, Blanc said: ""I don't know if it will be decisive, but now I think Chelsea will be obliged to attack us. ""Our philosophy is to have the ball. It will be tough, but we've given ourselves the possibility to be able to play for a place in the last four, so bravo to the players."""

""I'm very happy here. The club is doing an amazing job to become like other top clubs. I've seen big changes, developments on and off the field that I've never seen elsewhere,"" said Ibrahimovic, who has a contract that runs to 2016 in Paris worth around £15 million ($25m, 18 million euros) per year. ""Either you aim low or medium, but these people, they aim high! To come to England today is not a question that is brought up. First of all I think it's impossible to take me to England. I don't think the people behind this project will let me go."" Ibrahimovic, who moved to Paris from AC Milan in 2012, added: ""When I was at Milan I spoke to some English clubs, but I don't think I'll ever look back and say I wish I had gone to England. ""I respect the Premier League but I have no regrets about not playing there."" However, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who had Ibrahimovic in his Inter Milan side in the 2008/09 season, said it would be a shame if he never experienced life across the Channel. ""If he's happy in Paris - and I know he is - he has to stay,"" said Mourinho.

Laurent Blanc's side come into the game at the Parc des Princes in great shape, having beaten Nice 1-0 on Friday to record a club record ninth consecutive win in all competitions. That left them needing just three more wins from their last seven matches to secure a second consecutive Ligue 1 title, and they also have a League Cup final against Lyon to look forward to later this month. In contrast, Chelsea's 1-0 defeat at Crystal Palace on Saturday led manager Jose Mourinho to declare that they could no longer win the Premier League title. A day later, Liverpool replaced them at the top of the table and they would fall four points behind Manchester City if Manuel Pellegrini's side win their two games in hand. However, Mourinho's experience at this level is second to none, and that could give the English club the edge.

1181,31/03/2014,23:17,Football: Mourinho tips Chelsea to bounce back against powerful PSG,"Jose Mourinho has ruled his Chelsea side out of the Premier League title race, but he believes they will bounce back from domestic disappointment against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday.","The Chelsea manager questioned his players' mentality after a surprise 1-0 loss at Crystal Palace led to them being knocked off top spot in the Premier League by Liverpool. Mourinho loves to play mind games, but with Manchester City poised to leapfrog the Blues by winning their games in hand, it may be true that Chelsea's best chance of silverware now lies with the Champions League. And the Portuguese insists that his team will rise to the occasion as they face the Ligue 1 champions-elect at the Parc des Princes in the first leg of their quarter-final tie. ""Paris is the kind of match they feel comfortable to play. A big match, great stadium, opponents with top quality,"" said Mourinho ahead of the trip to France. Despite that, he says that the tie is finely poised, with PSG having emerged as a leading continental force in the last two years, spending astronomical sums to attract the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Brazil captain Thiago Silva to France. ""They have some of the best players in the world playing together in the same team, so they are a very powerful team,"" Mourinho said of a side who lost on away goals to Barcelona at the same stage last season. ""They are big, big, big candidates."" While Mourinho is driven by the desire to become the first coach to win the European Cup with three different clubs following previous triumphs with Porto in 2004 and Inter in 2010, Ibrahimovic is still aiming to win the greatest prize in club football for the first time. But, at the age of 32, the Swede seems to have belatedly reached his prime, with his tally of 40 goals in all competitions this season breaking the PSG club record. If the consensus in England seems to be that Ibrahimovic always disappoints at the highest level, Mourinho, who coached the maverick striker at Inter in 2008/09, thinks rather differently. ""I only coached him for a year but it was a good year, a good experience and I rate him as one of the best players I have ever coached,"" he said. PSG have not lost in 28 home European games and are currently on a club record-breaking run of nine straight wins in all competitions. They are running away with the Ligue 1 title and come into April 13 points clear of nearest challengers Monaco. They were some way short of their best in Friday's 1-0 win at Nice, but coach Laurent Blanc admits that thoughts were already on Chelsea. ""We can say that the players were already thinking about Chelsea. On Wednesday we will need to do better in the final third,"" said Blanc, who was a player at Barcelona in the late 1990s when Mourinho was on the staff at the Camp Nou. ""The best preparation (for Chelsea) was to win and, while we didn't play brilliantly against Nice, we got the result. Sometimes there are games like that."" Blanc will hope that his side are able to raise their game against the London club as PSG seek to live up to the sky-high expectations surrounding them inside France, where there is a growing belief that they can go all the way and lift the trophy in Lisbon in May. Just as Chelsea were transformed after being taken over by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich a decade ago, the arrival of Qatar Sports Investments has made PSG capable of competing with Europe's very best, and the squad stand to earn a bonus of 1 million euros (£826,000, $1.38m) per man if they win the trophy. Silva will sport a mask to protect a fractured cheekbone but Gregory van der Wiel is unlikely to play due to a nagging knee problem so Christophe Jallet is set to play at right-back. For Chelsea, Mourinho has said he expects Samuel Eto'o to miss the game because of a hamstring injury and Nemanja Matic is ineligible."
1182,30/03/2014,23:00,Football: Ivorians star for Lille and St. Etienne,Ivory Coast international Salomon Kalou grabbed an injury time winner for Lille in Ligue 1 action on Sunday while his compatriot Max Gradel was the hero in Saint-Etienne's 2-1 derby win at arch rivals Lyon.,"Lille had earlier tightened their grip on third place with a dramatic 1-0 over Guingamp when Kalou came off the bench to prod the ball home in the 92nd minute to snatch three desperately needed points for Rene Girard's side. But in the weekend's final match, Gradel scored with 16 minutes left to keep Saint-Etienne three points behind Lille, and the final Champions League berth, with seven matches left. In a tense Rhone derby at Lyon, Turkish international Mevlut Erding scrambled home a right wing cross in the 28th minute to put Saint-Etienne in front. However Lyon responded 11 minutes later when Bafetimbi Gomis laid on a pinpoint cross from the wing which Alexandre Lacazette skillfully volleyed home to level the match at 1-1. It was the 22-year-old Frenchman's 14th goal of the season, drawing him level with Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani as the second top scorer in Ligue 1 behind PSG's Swedish talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic who rests on 25. It was then down to Ivory Coast striker Gradel to steal the headlines, as the former Leicester City, Bournemouth and Leeds United player, plucked the winner with a quarter hour to play. Earlier at Lille, the match appeared to be heading for a goalless draw before Kalou popped up inside the six yard box to knee the ball home following a corner from the right that led to a scramble. ""We came out of that one very, very well,"" said a delighted Girard. ""We're still in third so where is the problem? I think that many teams in France would like to be in third place even if we've struggled of late and have been missing efficiency,"" he added. ""We've got some complicated matches coming up so we'll just have to see. I was sorry to see some of the players whistled (by Lille fans) but we're not going to place too much importance on that. It was the public, it was not supporters."" continued Girard. In the only other match on Sunday, Rennes made it back-to-back league wins with a confident 3-0 home success against Bastia that moved them eight points clear of the drop zone. It was the first time this season that the Brittany outfit had picked up three straight victories following their French Cup quarter-final success over Lille on Thursday. They will now play second division Angers for a place in the Stade de France final against either Monaco or Guingamp. ""It's been a beautiful week, with three wins in three matches without conceding a goal,"" said Rennes coach Philippe Montanier. ""It boosts morale after the many difficult weeks. ""It's a week which has put us on the right track. We took another step towards staying in the top flight, and the perspective of a French Cup semi-final has spiced up our season."" The Corsican outfit remain in 10th position. Monaco suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat away to Evian on Saturday to leave PSG well on track for a second straight French title. Laurent Blanc's PSG side warmed up for their Champions League showdown against Chelsea on Wednesday with a 1-0 win over Nice on Friday. Elsewhere on Saturday, Odair Fortes scored to earn Reims a 1-1 draw at home to Lorient, after Vincent Aboubakar netted a first-half penalty, while there were goalless stalemates between Montpellier and Valenciennes and Nantes and Bordeaux. Marseille scored in the dying minutes to salvage a 1-1 draw at relegation-threatened Sochaux while Ajaccio and Toulouse battled to a 2-2 draw in Corsica."

The match appeared to be heading for a goalless draw before Kalou popped up inside the six yard box to knee the ball home following a corner from the right that led to a scramble. The win extends Lille's advantage to six points over fourth placed Saint-Etienne who are involved in the Rhone derby at Lyon in the weekend's final match later on Sunday. Lyon are alone in fifth spot and nine points adrift of Lille and the all important final Champions League berth for next season. Earlier, Rennes made it back-to-back league wins with a confident 3-0 home success against Bastia that moved them eight points clear of the drop zone.

The hosts dominated from the outset with Romain Alessandrini opening the scoring after 14 minutes and Swedish striker Ola Toivonen doubling their advantage on 28 minutes. Cameroonian midfielder Jean Makoun rounded off the scoring after 59 minutes. The victory lifts Rennes up to 12th position and eight points above the relegation zone with seven matches to play. The Corsican outfit remain in 10th position. Monaco suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat away to Evian on Saturday to leave Paris Saint-Germain 13 points clear at the top of the Ligue 1 table with just seven games left. Toulouse missed the opportunity to leapfrog Marseille into the top six as they were held to a 2-2 draw by Ajaccio in Corsica. The visitors had fallen two goals behind as Ricardo Faty and Gadji Tallo netted for Ajaccio, but Issiaga Sylla pulled one back before Clement Chantome, the on-loan PSG midfielder, equalised. But Toulouse missed a great chance to win the game when Jonathan Zebina saw a stoppage-time penalty saved by Guillermo Ochoa in the home goal. Elsewhere on Saturday, Odair Fortes scored to earn Reims a 1-1 draw at home to Lorient, for whom Vincent Aboubakar netted a first-half penalty, while there were goalless stalemates between Montpellier and Valenciennes and Nantes and Bordeaux. On Friday, champions PSG took another step towards retaining their title and warmed up for next Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg at home to Chelsea by winning 1-0 at Nice."
1184,25/03/2014,02:15,Football: PSG ready for acid test of European ambitions,"When Qatar Sports Investments bought Paris Saint-Germain in 2011, they gave themselves five years to win the Champions League, but hopes are high in the French capital that they could get there ahead of schedule.","Having matched last season's achievement of reaching the quarter-finals of Europe's leading club competition, PSG are now preparing to face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea in this year's last eight next month. It will be the first true test of Laurent Blanc's side, who have not been suitably challenged domestically and have cruised through to this stage in Europe without having to play any of the continent's biggest names. PSG have lost just one league game since March last year and last Friday's 1-0 victory at Lorient allowed them to make it a club record eight wins on the bounce in all competitions. Under Blanc, they are 10 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 and are almost certain to retain the title won last year under Carlo Ancelotti. They have scored 70 goals in 30 league matches and Zlatan Ibrahimovic alone has 40 in all competitions, breaking the club record for the most goals in one campaign. But they are only doing what their enormous budget means they should be doing. In France, no other club can really compete financially -- not even Monaco -- and that gulf has translated onto the field. Two draws in two games against Monaco and a draw at home to third-placed Lille before Christmas suggest that it has not been a cakewalk, but even Blanc himself says that their domestic league is not enough of a challenge to prepare them for the pressures of Europe. Even there they have not been presented with a true test of their credentials, having cruised through a group containing the modest trio of Olympiakos, Benfica and Anderlecht before brushing aside a struggling Bayer Leverkusen. No wonder sports daily L'Equipe's front page headline asked if PSG were 'Ready For The Big Step Up' prior to the draw being made last Friday, and Chelsea will be just that. Possession is king for PSG, with Thiago Motta, Marco Verratti and Yohan Cabaye all available to Blanc in midfield, but Mourinho's side will be happy for their opponents to have the ball. Chelsea will also ask serious questions of a defence that has looked vulnerable at times in Europe this season - goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu was PSG's best player in the second leg against Leverkusen, and a fractured cheekbone suffered by captain Thiago Silva against Lorient is a cause for alarm. Silva and Ibrahimovic are the biggest influences in this PSG side and, at the age of 32, the latter is personally driven by the desire to win the biggest prize of all in club football having fallen short so many times before. In France, observers are confident of PSG's credentials, with 60 percent of those responding to a L'Equipe poll saying that Blanc's side would beat Chelsea, while Mourinho himself tried to claim at the weekend that PSG against his side. The financial incentive is certainly there for PSG, with the club's mega-rich owners offering a bonus of 1 million euros (£833,000, $1.38m) per player if they can win the trophy this year. But that might prove a step too far. After all, this season's quarter-final line-up is the strongest in recent memory, with all eight clubs advancing having won their groups. Six of the eight quarter-finalists have won the European Cup 23 times between them. Atletico Madrid have at least been to the final. ""There are teams who have a legitimacy in the Champions League in terms of experience that we don't have, but I think the consideration that our opponents have for us has increased,"" said Blanc recently, although PSG need only look to Chelsea if they doubt that patience might still be required even when throwing enormous of money chasing the dream. A decade ago, the London club were themselves new to this level and they reached the last eight or further seven times in 12 seasons before finally winning the trophy in 2012."

The daily revealed that plans to give it a facelift for Euro 2016 will increase the number of VIP places to 4,500 and will also include new restaurant facilities. French champions, and current Ligue 1 leaders, Paris Saint-Germain hope to eventually raise capacity - which currently stands at 45,000 - to 60,000 after the tournament, added Le Parisien, although PSG themselves refused to comment. As well as being home to PSG, the Parc des Princes has hosted many showpiece matches, including the 1984 European Championship final, and was home to the French national football and rugby teams before the Stade de France opened in 1998. The 24-nation Euro 2016 will run from June 10 to July 10, 2016."
1186,24/03/2014,13:19,Football: Finances forgotten as French Cup levels playing field,"While Ligue 1 contenders Monaco go into the French Cup as the team to beat, minnows Moulins and Cannes as well as Angers and Lens are also included in a surprise quarter-final lineup.","Amateur fourth division side AS Moulins were just days from liquidation in 2012 when they managed to come up with the 200,000 euros necessary to stay in business, a sum that would hardly pay a week's salary for some of the Monaco players. Playing in front of crowds in the region of 1,000 fans, they now stand two matches from a dream date at the Stade de France, a bumper payout and even a place in the Europa League. They host Angers on Tuesday, a club enjoying a fine campaign of their own and just outside the promotion places back to Ligue 1. Most of the Moulins' squad, maintain jobs outside of football, but that has not stopped them taking the scalps of top flight clubs Lorient and Toulouse in previous rounds. Club chairman Vincent Rondet is expecting the tie to generate great enthusiasm with the match set to be played at neighbouring, fifth division club Gueugnon's 14,000-capacity Jean-Laville stadium. ""This has never happened to the club and there's a real excitement in the city which is decorated in blue and white,"" said Rondet. ""We are awaiting one of the great teams in Ligue 2 (Angers) and I hope we can have the most people possible at the stadium so it will be a great party."" he added. Cannes, a destination more renowned for its glitzy lifestyle and world famous film festival, are the second fourth division side entertaining dreams of writing an unprecedented page in French Cup history. They tackle Ligue 1 side Guingamp at their Pierre de Coubertin stadium hoping to add to the Brittany's clubs recent slide which included a 1-0 home defeat against Lyon on Sunday. The third, and on paper most balanced tie, is between Ligue 1 rivals Rennes and Lille on Thursday, which will provide a welcome distraction for both teams from their contrasting league fortunes. Lille are coming off a well deserved 1-1 draw at Monaco at the weekend but are battling to protect third spot and the all important final Champions League place for next season. Coach Rene Girard, who won the 2012 league championship with Montpellier, has worked wonders with the northern club as they stand on the brink of Cup success and a place in Europe's most prestigious competition. Rennes meanwhile upset Marseille 1-0 at the Velodrome on Saturday to pull six points clear of the relegation zone. Monaco appear resigned to settle for the runner-up place this season in Ligue 1 after falling 10 points back of fellow big spenders Paris Saint-Germain. Their greatest chance of silverware is the French Cup and their Italian coach Claudio Ranieri is expected to field a strong line-up against second division Lens on Wednesday. Lens, the 1998 French champions, travel to the Louis II stadium looking for their first French Cup after losing finals in 1948, 1975 and 1998. A return to the top flight is their priority, lying second in their division, and a domestic double would delight their raucous 'blood and gold' supporters who last went to the Stade de France in 2008 when they lost the League Cup final 2-1 against Paris Saint-Germain.

1187,21/03/2014,23:25,Football: PSG maintain title march against valiant Lorient,"Paris Saint-Germain, fresh from drawing Chelsea in the Champions League quarter-finals, maintained their march to a defence of their Ligue 1 title with a 1-0 win over spirited Lorient on Friday.","Thiago Motta's first half goal was all that split the two teams with the valiant mid-table hosts giving Laurent Blanc's side plenty of nervy moments in Brittany. The hard fought win on Lorient's artificial pitch at their Stade du Moustoir extended PSG's crushing lead at the top of Ligue 1 to 11 points, with second-placed Monaco in action on Sunday against third-placed Lille. ""We can't always win 3,4 or 5-0. We must congratulate the players even if it was not an extraordinary performance,"" said Blanc, who insisted that his team had not been distracted by their impending clash with Chelsea. ""All reporters believe that we have talked of nothing but Chelsea, that it's difficult to think of Lorient. But tonight we were at the Moustoir, not at  Stamford Bridge."" For PSG, who prevailed despite not being at the top of their game, this success was their sixth in a row in Ligue 1 and their eighth on the trot in all competitions. The one sore point for Blanc was the injury suffered by captain Thiago Silva, who had to come off early on in the first half. Blanc elected to field Brazilian Marquinhos in place of his compatriot Alex in central defence, with Marco Verratti regaining his place in midfield from Yohan Cabaye after a two-game absence. Christophe Jallet came in for the injured right back Gregory Van der Wiel against his former club. On the right Blanc preferred Ezequiel Lavezzi to Lucas. Lorient kept the champions-in-waiting at bay until the 41st minute, when in a move inspired by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Motta broke the deadlock. Ibrahimovic conjured up an exquisite back-heeled flick of the ball to Edinson Cavani down the left, with the Uruguayan returning the favour for the Swede to attempt a close range angled shot. The star striker's attempt was denied by Lorient keeper Fabien Audard but Motta was on hand to pounce on the loose ball, the Brazilian-born Italian only having to nudge it over Audard's goal line. Ibrahimovic by this point was wearing the captain's armband having inherited it from Silva, who was forced to come off in the 24th minute after receiving an accidental knock in the face from Vincent Aboubakar's elbow in an airborne duel. Alex came on in his fellow Brazilian's place. PSG enjoyed almost three quarters of the possession in the first half and would have been relieved to have reaped the one goal reward. Lorient emerged for the restart with fire in their bellies, and Jerome Aliadiere should have done better when blazing his effort high over the PSG cross bar. On the hour, Verratti ceded his place to Cabaye, as Lorient's Aliadiere paid for his lack of precision shooting, making way for Sadio Diallo. Only Audard's reflex action and a large slice of luck kept out Jallet's tight-angled shot on the right from doubling PSG's lead with quarter of an hour remaining. PSG held on despite a couple of late scares, notably when midfielder Bryan Pele had the ball in the back of the PSG net only for his effort to be deemed offside."
1188,20/03/2014,02:30,Football: Ibra 'just doing his job' as PSG go to troubled Lorient,Zlatan Ibrahimovic has tried to play down his role in turning Paris Saint-Germain into a leading European force as the Ligue 1 leaders prepare to go to Lorient on Friday evening.,"The Swede has been idolised by the PSG fans ever since he scored a brace to help the capital club come from two goals down to draw 2-2 at home to Lorient on his debut on the opening day of last season. Last weekend he got two more goals in the 2-0 home win against Saint-Etienne that kept the reigning champions eight points clear of Monaco at the top of the table. As a result, he moved on to 40 goals in all competitions this season, breaking Carlos Bianchi's previous club record of 39 in a single campaign, set back in 1978, but Ibrahimovic did not appear overly impressed. ""The important thing was to win. My goalscoring records are just a bonus,"" said the former AC Milan striker, who has 25 goals in Ligue 1 alone this season. ""We're having a fantastic season and that's why we have such a big lead atop the table. It's not because we're just too strong for the league or because Ligue 1 is too easy. It's because we train very hard."" Laurent Blanc's side are also eagerly waiting to discover who they will face in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, with the draw to be made on Friday. Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Chelsea are among the possible opponents for PSG in the last eight, but none of them will relish coming up against the French champions. Domestically, their dominance is such that they have lost just one of their last 40 Ligue 1 games, so a trip to Lorient's Stade du Moustoir will hold no fears, even if they must adapt to its artificial surface. Lorient have been one of France's most stable clubs in recent years. However, uncertainty over the future of long-serving coach Christian Gourcuff appears to have had an impact on performances, and the mid-table Bretons have won just one of their last eight matches. Gourcuff has spent quarter of a century in charge of Lorient in three separate spells, the most recent an unbroken stint since 2003. In that time he has helped turn a tiny provincial outfit into an established top-division club who are currently enjoying their eighth consecutive season in Ligue 1. But Gourcuff's contract is due to expire in the summer and he has not accepted the offer of a two-year extension, with his relationship with the club's hierarchy having deteriorated in recent times. ""There is no mutual confidence and we have very different feelings on a number of issues,"" said Gourcuff, who has seen many of his best players sold on in recent years and was especially unhappy at losing midfielder Mario Lemina to Marseille on the last day of the summer transfer window. Gourcuff, whose son Yoann plays for Lyon, says he ""still wants to work as a coach"" and admits it would be ""heartbreaking"" to leave Lorient, but his departure from the club now appears inevitable. At least 12-goal leading scorer Vincent Aboubakar should be able to return for the hosts after missing last week's 2-0 loss to Sochaux due to a knee problem. Yohan Cabaye is a doubt for PSG with the back problem he picked up last weekend, so Marco Verratti should return in midfield. Gregory Van der Wiel, the Dutch international right-back, is still struggling with a knee problem. Monaco host third-placed Lille on Sunday looking to increase the gap between the teams, which currently sits at nine points, while Saint-Etienne host Sochaux, Lyon go to Guingamp and struggling duo Marseille and Rennes meet in the pick of the other matches this weekend.

They also come into this game on the back of a five match winning streak, in which they have scored 16 goals, and unbeaten in nine since a home cup defeat to Montpellier at the end of January. They have been beaten just three times this season, and one of those was in a dead Champions League group stage match away to Benfica when they rested several players having already secured top spot in the pool. Leverkusen's form could not be more different having lost five in a row before they scraped a 1-1 draw at Hannover 96 on Saturday. That dismal five-match losing run began with a 1-0 home defeat in the cup to second division Kaiserslautern. They've also lost eight and won just two of their last 11 matches in all competitions. Their European form hasn't exactly been impressive either, losing their last group stage game 5-0 at home to Manchester United before going down 4-0 in their own stadium against PSG three weeks ago.

1194,07/03/2014,15:09,Football: Runaway PSG looking to avoid complacency,"Fresh from beating their biggest rivals last weekend, Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain are determined to avoid complacency when they travel to face Bastia on Saturday.","Laurent Blanc's league leaders eased to a 2-0 victory against Marseille in the Classique at the Parc des Princes in their last outing to move onto 64 points -- a record tally at this stage of the season -- and open up a gap of eight points to nearest rivals Monaco. Apparently too strong for their domestic opponents, the club from the capital could be forgiven for focusing all of their attention on the Champions League, in which they defend a 4-0 lead against Bayer Leverkusen going into the second leg of their last-16 tie next Wednesday. Nevertheless, coming into the trip to Corsica to face a Bastia side who are ninth in the table but have won just one of their last five Ligue 1 outings, Blanc has refused to admit that a second consecutive title is secure. ""It's not up to me to confirm or deny that. I think it's better to be in our situation than that of our pursuers,"" said the 48-year-old. ""There are still a lot of points to be taken. We have a good number of points, but we need more. It's not over. ""Some people will say that if there is too big a gap we will start to lose focus. There is no easy solution. But we have managed to distance ourselves from our rivals and we are not going to complain."" Blanc, who was sweating on the safe return of many of his players from international duty this week, will be without Edinson Cavani for the game. The striker, who returned from more than a month on the sidelines with a thigh injury to score against Marseille, was allowed to go back to his native Uruguay for personal reasons this week. ""Cavani will not play. He will undoubtedly only get back (to France) on Saturday,"" admitted Blanc. ""Of course we'd like him to be there but it's not the case."" Second-placed Monaco entertain relegation-threatened Sochaux as they bid to get back to winning ways following their 2-0 loss at Saint-Etienne last time out. Claudio Ranieri's side are now hoping to secure the automatic Champions League qualification that comes with finishing runners-up as soon as possible, but they can ill afford to underestimate Sochaux, who have won three and drawn two of their last six matches to keep alive their chances of an unlikely great escape from the drop. ""Some people think it will be easy against Sochaux, I think the opposite. I have the feeling that this team is going to stay up,"" said Ranieri, before adding that captain Eric Abidal will miss the game at the Stade Louis II having briefly been admitted to hospital at the start of the week after taking the wrong flu medication. ""Eric Abidal is not quite ready for Saturday. It's the same for Aymen Abdennour, (but) Dimitar Berbatov has improved physically and he will be able to start."" Lille, in third, face a stiff test at home to Montpellier, who have not lost in nine Ligue 1 games, while Saint-Etienne, who are a point off the Champions League places, travel to Lorient later on Sunday. Lyon go to Bordeaux on Sunday night, but Marseille were not happy about having to play host to south-coast rivals Nice on Friday. The game is taking place just 48 hours after a clutch of OM players were in action for their countries in Wednesday's card of international friendlies. Marseille are seeking revenge for a 5-4 defeat to Nice in the French Cup in January, but they will also have to do without top scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac due to suspension.

1195,01/03/2014,16:03,"Football: Cavani ready to return for PSG, says Blanc",Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc on Saturday confirmed that Uruguayan record signing Edinson Cavani will return from injury in Sunday's Ligue 1 meeting with Marseille.,"Blanc admitted that fringe players Christophe Jallet, Zoumana Camara and Hervin Ongenda are all missing but said that Cavani would feature for the first time since pulling up with a thigh injury in the 2-0 win against Bordeaux on January 31. ""He has worked really well this week,"" said Blanc of Cavani, who has scored 20 goals this season since moving to France from Napoli for a Ligue 1 record fee of 64 million euros ($88m, £52.75m) last summer. ""As long as there are no problems in the last session (on Saturday) he will be in the squad. Will he start? You will see."" Traditionally the biggest game in the French calendar, 'Le Classique' has lost a bit of its lustre recently with Monaco emerging as the biggest threat to PSG's domination of Ligue 1. Marseille are 18 points behind their enemies from the capital coming into the game at the Parc des Princes, although they have boosted their chances of Champions League qualification thanks to a five-match unbeaten run. ""This is a special match. It always will be in my opinion and we know the reasons for that,"" said Blanc, who spent two seasons as a player at Marseille and scored the winner for OM in this fixture in 1997. ""But for there to be a bit of spice to it, both clubs need to be doing well. If there is less pressure, it's maybe because you (the press) are creating less. ""There is always this rivalry between the two clubs, between the south and the north, the capital and the province."" PSG won 2-1 away to Marseille in the reverse fixture in October, despite having Thiago Motta sent off half an hour in and going a goal down. Since then, though, OM have sacked Elie Baup and replaced him with sporting director Jose Anigo until the end of the season. ""They are solid. The reverse fixture was one of our best matches, with 10 against 11 for almost an hour,"" admitted Blanc. ""Paris were very, very strong. We will play our own game. Will they take risks or will they sit back? I don't know. Everyone knows how we will play."""
1196,28/02/2014,02:24,Football: PSG ready for test from resurgent Marseille,Paris Saint-Germain host Marseille in France's fiercest rivalry on Sunday night with the capital club hoping to have Edinson Cavani back to help them see off their resurgent opponents.,"Laurent Blanc's PSG side have had a superb last 10 days, crushing Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 in the Champions League and then beating Toulouse 4-2 away last Sunday to maintain their five-point lead over Monaco at the top of the Ligue 1 table. Since then they have been boosted by the news that France midfielder Blaise Matuidi has finally put pen to paper on a new contract tying him to the Parc des Princes until 2018. Now there is real hope that Uruguay striker Cavani will be able to make his comeback after four weeks on the sidelines with a thigh injury. ""The objective is to have him at our disposal against Marseille,"" revealed Blanc. ""We will have to see how the injury evolves, but when I see him in training I think he is close to being ready. In any case, we are not going to take any risks, but things are on the right track."" Bitter rivals Marseille come into the 'Classique' boosted by their recent improved form under interim coach Jose Anigo, which has reignited their hopes of finishing in the top three and qualifying for next season's Champions League. Inspired by Andre-Pierre Gignac, who has scored 12 times in 13 games, OM have won three and drawn two of their last five league matches. That run of results has allowed them to close to within three points of Lille, who remain on the podium despite a poor start to 2014. Now, though, Marseille must try to end a sequence of four successive defeats in all competitions against their old foes. ""It is a really exciting match, but to get a result against Paris would be a massive achievement for us,"" said midfielder Alaixys Romao. ""If we raise our game than why can't we win? We have improved over the last few weeks and are defending better. ""It will be difficult but over one game who knows. Paris don't intimidate me. They play good football so you just hope to show that you can compete at their level."" Meanwhile, second-placed Monaco continue their chase of the leaders with a tough trip to Saint-Etienne, who are fourth. Monaco are unbeaten in 2014 and their Colombian playmaker James Rodriguez says the race is still alive, especially if PSG slip up against Marseille. ""Personally I want to win the title but we know that Paris are very strong,"" said the 22-year-old. ""To get in front of them, we have to show more intensity in our game and win every match because the margin of error is very small. We all know anything can happen in the championship, and Marseille can win at Paris for example."" Elsewhere, Lyon have dragged themselves back into the race for European places but they face a tough test on Sunday at home against Montpellier, who are unbeaten in eight Ligue 1 matches under the leadership of Rolland Courbis. Remi Garde's team are five points behind Lille, who travel to bottom side Ajaccio. While the Corsicans have been cut adrift, Herve Renard's Sochaux have caught a glimmer of light in the their bid to stave off relegation as they sit five points from safety ahead of a home clash with Bordeaux. Third-from-bottom Valenciennes are two points from safety and travel to Reims, while the pick of the other games is a Brittany derby between Rennes and Guingamp.

The win extended the Parisian club's unbeaten home run in the league to 25 matches and served as an ideal rehearsal for Tuesday's trip to Bayer Leverkusen in the last 16 of the Champions League. ""The focus before Leverkusen was above all to win this match,"" reflected Blanc. ""The players have been thinking about Leverkusen but (tonight) they put it to one side and got the job done. ""We could have been more efficient, but to score three goals and not concede any isn't bad,"" added the PSG coach. Defeat for Valenciennes means Ariel Jacobs' side remain in the bottom three, two points from safety and fourth-from-bottom Evian TG. Bearing in mind next week's first-leg tie in Germany, Blanc predictably chose to rotate his squad, making five changes to the side involved in the stalemate at Monaco last weekend. Midfielder Yohan Cabaye made his full debut following his arrival from Newcastle United last month, with Jeremy Menez handed a rare start and Ezequiel Lavezzi returning to the side in place of Lucas Moura. Blanc had expressed concerns of ""mental fatigue"" among his players following a congested run of fixtures but the Frenchman would have been encouraged by the hosts' bright start, but for their profligate finishing. Lavezzi made an immediate impact, charging down a defensive clearance and lofting the ball over goalkeeper Nicolas Penneteau towards Ibrahimovic although the Swede's tame goalbound flick was cleared off the line by Kagelmacher. Lavezzi was then denied by a fine Saliou Ciss block before Penneteau flew to his left to keep out a Thiago Silva header with Ibrahimovic scuffing the rebound across the face of goal and Marquinhos unable to convert at the far post. It was of little surprise when PSG broke the deadlock 18 minutes in, even if the nature of the goal was somewhat fortuitous. Ibrahimovic drilled a 30-yard free-kick into the defensive wall and the ball broke favourably to Lavezzi for the Argentine to stick away his fourth goal of the season. A second very nearly followed soon after as Lavezzi flicked Gregory van der Wiel's cross wide of the far post. The Argentine was then thwarted by Penneteau, who turned his effort round the post, having been played in by Ibrahimovic. The hosts were slicing apart Valenciennes with alarming ease, with Lucas Digne flashing an effort narrowly wide after bursting into the box. Valenciennes failed to register a single effort on target in the first half, their best chance coming on the half-hour when David Ducourtioux dragged wide from 12 yards out. The visitors were hanging on as PSG failed to transform their superiority into goals but Ibrahimovic eased any tension five minutes after half-time as he extended his league-best goals tally to 19, stabbing home after Cabaye's mishit volley bounced into his path. The points were made safe just two minutes later as Lavezzi broke free down the left and played in a cross that Kagelmacher bundled into his own net. Title challengers Monaco could cut the gap back to five points on Saturday, but Claudio Ranieri's men face a tricky trip to Corsica to face Bastia. Already without Radamel Falcao, Monaco will also have to make do without new signing Dimitar Berbatov after the Bulgarian suffered a knee injury in the French Cup victory at Nice in midweek."

The Italian then saw his side triumph 1-0 after extra-time away to Cote d'Azur rivals Nice in the French Cup last 16 on Wednesday as recent signing Dimitar Berbatov got his first goal for the club. That success was achieved despite Ranieri making sweeping changes to his line-up, but now the likes of Eric Abidal, Joao Moutinho and James Rodriguez are set to return to the side. ""I rotated the squad a lot at Nice because Monaco have to play three big games this week,"" said Ranieri, before lauding the contribution of his Bulgarian recruit, who appeared as a second-half substitute. ""Berbatov got the goal. I asked him to play in between the lines and he did that well."" Bastia, meanwhile, have had a great week. After failed to register an away win all season, they ran out 3-1 victors at Toulouse in a rearranged game on Tuesday that was notable for Djibril Cisse's first goal since returning to French football last month. ""Djibril put in a courageous performance. It was important for him to score,"" admitted Bastia coach Frederic Hantz, who is hoping the 32-year-old former Marseille striker can score enough goals to stake a late claim for a place in France's World Cup squad. ""We need to be careful with him and not go too quickly, so that he is in top form by March, April, May. If we do that we can help him achieve his (World Cup) objective."" Bastia then claimed another away win on Wednesday when the French League (LFP) confirmed that their 2-0 opening-day defeat at Nantes had been overturned because Les Canaris fielded an ineligible player. Hantz's side therefore now have European qualification in their sights, and they will be hopeful of claiming another positive result at Furiani, where only Lyon have taken three points this season. They are without goalkeeper Mickael Landreau due to a calf injury though, and Monaco are defending an unbeaten record in 2014. Nevertheless, they have managed just two wins in their last six league games and could find themselves eight points off top spot come kick-off. Before facing Bayer Leverkusen in Germany in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie next Tuesday, PSG entertain struggling Valenciennes at the Parc des Princes on Friday. The capital club, who are still without the injured Edinson Cavani, have not been at their best since hammering Nantes 5-0 last month and could do with a boost in a game that may see January signing Yohan Cabaye make his first start for the club. Third-placed Lille travel to face Evian on Sunday before fourth and fifth face off at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard as Saint-Etienne meet Marseille. Les Verts have lost just once in eight league games and have won their last five home matches, all without conceding a goal. Marseille, meanwhile, are enduring a season of ups and downs but head to Le Chaudron having taken seven points from a possible nine. ""We are on a good run at home and we are fourth in the table. That gives us reason to be ambitious,"" midfielder Benjamin Corgnet told Saint-Etienne's website. Lyon have also revived their hopes of European qualification via the league in recent weeks, and Remi Garde's side will expect to register three points when they host bottom side Ajaccio.

However, Lens were handed a lifeline when Mehdi Zeffane brought down Adamo Coulibaly inside the penalty area a minute into injury time, and Pierrick Valdivia - who started his career with Lyon - converted from the spot. Lens, who were French champions in 1998 but are currently battling to win promotion back to Ligue 1 after a three-year absence, went on to win the tie in extra-time. The decisive moment arrived in the 94th minute when young defender Jean-Philippe Gbamin took advantage of hesitant goalkeeping by Remy Vercoutre to head home a corner. While Lens can look forward to a trip to the principality next, Lyon's hopes of silverware now appear to rest with the League Cup, in which they will meet Paris Saint-Germain in the final in April. Only four Ligue 1 sides made it through to the quarter-finals, with Monaco advancing thanks to a 1-0 extra-time win at Cote d'Azur rivals Nice on Wednesday, in which Dimitar Berbatov scored the winner, his first goal since arriving from Fulham last month. Rennes will meet Lille in the only last-eight tie between two top-flight sides, while 2009 winners Guingamp will go to Cannes. Fourth-tier amateurs Cannes, the club where Zinedine Zidane started his career, knocked out Saint-Etienne on penalties in the last 64 and followed that up by beating Montpellier 1-0 after extra-time on Tuesday. Montpellier had beaten PSG in the previous round but came up short on a poor pitch on the south coast, although they were also left to rue a missed penalty by Mbaye Niang in extra-time. The other quarter-final tie will see Angers, of Ligue 2, travel to Moulins, an amateur club from central France."
1208,13/02/2014,18:58,Football: Monaco furious after tax agreement challenged,"AS Monaco on Thursday expressed ""amazement"" after seven clubs in France's top two divisions decided to challenge an agreement that would allow the Principality club to continue playing in Ligue 1.","The ruling body of the French league, the LFP, announced late last month that Monaco had agreed to pay a fixed sum of 50 million euros ($68.3m, £41m) to avoid being forced into moving their headquarters across the border into France for tax reasons or face being kicked out of the competition. However, top-flight rivals Paris Saint-Germain, Bordeaux, Lille, Lorient, Marseille and Montpellier, as well as second-tier Caen, have decided to contest that settlement in the hope that a different agreement can be found. In response, Monaco released a statement to AFP in which they said: ""Our first reaction is of amazement. ""The discussions with the LFP were carried out within the legal framework (and) a vote with a large majority (16 votes) in favour of this agreement was approved. ""We can therefore only express our stupefaction that this can be challenged just a few days later."" The LFP initially ruled last year that all professional clubs must be set up as French companies for tax purposes, a decision that was made targeting Monaco. Monaco benefit from highly favourable tax laws in the Principality compared to those in place in France itself, meaning operating costs are significantly lower for the club owned by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev. They were also exempted from the French government's controversial 75 percent tax rate on earnings over 1 million euros, for which other professional clubs will be liable."
1209,12/02/2014,23:48,Football: Berbatov scores to send Monaco through in French Cup,Dimitar Berbatov scored an extra time winner to send Monaco through to the last eight of the French Cup as his new side beat 10-man Nice 1-0 on Wednesday and keep alive their hopes of the domestic double this season.,"The former Fulham forward's goal - his first since moving to Monaco last month - came in the 113th minute of a turgid affair at Nice's Allianz Riviera ground. The 33-year-old Bulgarian met a speculative cross from teammate Lucas Ocampos to divert the ball into the net from five yards out with Nice's keeper Mouez Hassen well-beaten. Berbatov had come on as a second-half substitute, to make only his second appearance for the Monegasques, who currently lie second in France's Ligue 1 five points adrift of defending champions Paris Saint Germain. It was a game of few chances and little excitement with neither side looking like winning until Berbatov pounced. After a dull first half with few clear opportunities for either side, the game burst into life straight after the break, with the dismissal of Nice's Timothee Kolodziejkczak. He was adjudged to have hit Monaco defender Ricardo Carvalho and was promptly sent off, but obviously aggrieved by the decision he took several moments to leave the pitch. Monaco came closest to breaking the deadlock on the hour mark when a header from Ocampos flashed narrowly wide of the left upright. But it was 10-man Nice who should have scored when Mathieu Bodmer seized on a loose ball from a corner just seven yards from goal in the 76th minute but his flick was well-saved by Monaco's goalkeeper Sergio Romero. Both sides had made several changes from their weekend Ligue 1 fixtures. Nice brought in Hassen and Jeremy Pied from the team which lost 2-1 at Valenciennes at the weekend, while Monaco boss Claudio Ranieri, who admitted before the game that the Cup was not his priority this season, made four changes from the side which drew 1-1 with Paris Saint-German on Sunday. In Wednesday's other results, Rennes won 1-0 at Auxerre, Guingamp beat L'Ile Rousse 2-0 and amateur side Moulins from France's fourth tier beat Sete 3-1 to head into the quarter-finals. Lyon, the 2012 winners, and Lens play each other on Thursday for the final place in the quarter-finals."
1210,11/02/2014,20:52,Football: France third choice keeper Landreau out for five weeks,"World Cup finals bound France's third choice goalkeeper Mickael Landreau is facing five weeks on the sidelines after suffering a calf muscle injury, sources at his Ligue 1 club Bastia revealed on Tuesday.","The 34-year-old -- who won two league titles with Nantes in 2001 and Lille in 2011 -- picked up the problem in the 3-0 defeat by Marseille in their Ligue 1 clash on Saturday. He is due to miss Ligue 1 games against Monaco, Saint Etienne and defending champions and leaders Paris Saint Germain. Landreau is currently third in Didier Deschamps' pecking order to keep goal for France at the World Cup finals in Brazil behind Tottenham's Hugo Lloris and Steve Mandanda of Marseille. Landreau has 11 caps to his name. He made his debut in the 2001 Confederations Cup, and was a member of the French squad that reached the 2006 World Cup final, although coach Raymond Domenech didn't give him any playing time. After falling out of favour - he was overlooked for Euro 2008 - he earned a recall in 2012 from Deschamps, with Cedric Carrasso making way."

Monaco salvaged a point after PSG's captain Silva stretched and inadvertently turned a Fabinho cross into his goal in the 74th minute. The result was probably a fair reflection of the match, but PSG will be the most disappointed as they had held the lead since the eighth minute through a headed goal by Javier Pastore. ""It was a good game with lots of chances,"" reflected Monaco manager Claudio Ranieri. ""I hope PSG will win the Champions League for French football, and leave a few points for Monaco...."" Lurking at the back post, Pastore, who was drafted into the PSG side as replacement for injured striker Edinson Cavani, was able to score from close range after a corner had been flicked-on from defender Alex. Monaco's response to going behind was immediate and they should have been level just six minutes later, but Emmanuel Riviere squandered a great chance pushing a rebound from Sirigu wide with the goal at his mercy. But it was not all one-way traffic. PSG should have doubled their lead when Ibrahimovic, of all people, squandered a fine opportunity from just five yards out after good play on the left flank between Pastore and Maxwell. The second-half was a more scrappy affair with PSG largely in control. PSG came closest to scoring when Ibrahimovic fired in a fierce free-kick from the edge of the area which Monaco's Croatian keeper Danijel Subasic did well to turn wide in the 55th minute. Both sides had a chance to secure victory in the final minutes. First Fabinho was denied in the 89th minute from giving Monaco - who brought on former Fulham striker Dimitar Berbatov for his debut in the 64th minute - victory after his thunderous shot was well-saved by PSG's Sirigu. Then just moments later, Monaco's Subasic pulled off a similar save to deny Ligue 1's top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Meanwhile, the chasing pack behind the top two teams mostly had a good weekend. Lille, Marseille, Lyon and Reims all won with St Etienne the only side in the top seven not to get three points following a disappointing 0-0 at mid-table Toulouse."

Claudio's Ranieri's men are five points adrift of PSG, and with Colombian star Falcao ruled out for the season with a knee injury, Monaco turned to former Manchester United striker Berbatov in the January transfer window to help fill the void. Berbatov arrived on loan from Premier League strugglers Fulham, with the Bulgarian saying a recommendation from ex-teammate, and former Monaco defender, Patrice Evra convinced him to swap England for the Cote d'Azur. Looking ahead to his first match in Monaco colours, Berbatov said: ""It's the best possible way (to start). ""You play against one of the biggest clubs in football, one of the best players in football (Zlatan Ibrahimovic), so what else can a player want? ""It's going to be a fantastic opportunity for me. ""They are favourites, but they're coming to ours so it will be difficult for them. ""It won't be easy, but we can win Sunday,"" added the 33-year-old, who could start on the bench should Ranieri elect to keep faith with in-form duo Emmanuel Riviere and Valere Germain up front. PSG kept their hopes of a domestic double intact on Tuesday as two goals from Ibrahimovic saw the capital club edge past Nantes 2-1 to seal a place in the final of the League Cup. With several key fixtures on the horizon, including the Champions League last-16 tie against Bayer Leverkusen, PSG are entering what coach Laurent Blanc has dubbed ""money-time"" and is counting on his side to perform. Midfielder Yohan Cabaye, thrust into the midst of a title race after signing from Newcastle United last month, knows victory against Monaco would steer Laurent Blanc's men ever closer to defending their crown. ""It won't be over, there are still 14 matches to play. But a win would bring us closer to the title,"" said the France international, who could be in line for his full debut.

The 33-year-old moves from a relegation battle in England to a title fight in France, with a meeting with Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain to come this weekend at the Stade Louis II. ""My friend Patrice Evra told me a lot of good things about the club. And when Monaco called me, I said why not. I was looking for something new,"" said Berbatov, who played alongside the France left-back at Old Trafford between 2008 and 2012. However, he said that the presence of enigmatic Italian coach Claudio Ranieri - another familiar face from his days in England - was also a factor in convincing him to make the switch to a new country. ""I decided to come here because it's a great team. I know the coach. He was working in England, so it was an easy decision to make. I have never been here in France but I think the football, it's really good. ""It's a new experience for me and it's a new adventure for me. I had the chance to train with my new teammates and it was really, really special because I saw how talented the players are that Monaco have."" Considered something of a maverick and known for his languid style, Berbatov, who has also played for Bayer Leverkusen and Tottenham Hotspur, believes his way of playing will help him be successful in the French game. ""You guys, when you watch the game, you want to be entertained, not fall asleep. This is my goal,"" he added. ""Today I saw really nice things from my teammates, really talented players, so it's going to be good for me to work with them and hopefully my style of play is going to be good for the team and for the French league as well."" Berbatov was unveiled to the press along with Monaco's two other January signings, Nigerian left-back Elderson Echiejile and Tunisian centre-back Aymen Abdennour. Echiejile has already made his debut since signing from Braga, but Abdennour, who arrived on an initial six-month loan deal with an option to take up a permanent four-year contract in the summer, will not be able to play for at least another two to three weeks with a thigh injury. Berbatov, though, is likely to be in Ranieri's squad for Sunday's game against PSG, when a win will take Monaco to within two points of top spot."
1221,03/02/2014,16:10,Football: PSG ready for pivotal phase of campaign,Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc admitted on Monday that his team are moving into 'money time' as they begin a busy month of February with a League Cup semi-final at Nantes on Tuesday.,"The month ahead will be crucial to PSG's season, with the Ligue 1 leaders travelling to face Bayer Leverkusen in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie and also going to title rivals Monaco on Sunday. But first they will look to get the better of a Nantes side who lost 5-0 at the Parc des Princes in Ligue 1 last month and clinch their place in the final at the Stade de France. ""We are coming up to the money time, so we need to perform,"" said Blanc, who said the focus for now is solely on winning Tuesday's semi-final. ""We are trying to concentrate fully on this tie. The most important thing in a Cup is to get to the next round, especially as the next game will be at the Stade de France."" Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani will miss the game at the Stade de la Beaujoire with a thigh injury which is expected to keep him out for three weeks, but Yohan Cabaye could start for the three-time winners after coming off the bench to make his debut in Friday's 2-0 league win against Bordeaux. ""Cavani will start running again soon but we didn't want to aggravate it so we will not take any risks. We have a big squad and we need to use it when there are injuries,"" added Blanc. ""As for Cabaye, I think he is ready to play. Physically he is fine. He has blended naturally into the squad. If I need to use him I won't hesitate."" The second semi-final on Wednesday sees Lyon play host to second-tier Troyes at the Stade de Gerland as they continue their quest for success on four fronts this season. OL may have lost at Rennes on Sunday, but their recent improved form has put them back in European contention in the league, while they are also still alive in the French Cup and the Europa League. ""The chance to get to the final of a national cup competition is great for us,"" said Lyon coach Remi Garde, who admits he would love the opportunity to come up against PSG in the showpiece, which will be staged in April. ""That is the dream, yes. But before getting there we need to concentrate on beating Troyes."" The second-tier club have eliminated two top-flight sides on their way to the last four in Valenciennes and Evian, but Lyon should welcome back playmaker Yoann Gourcuff for the tie after a minor leg muscle problem.

1222,01/02/2014,22:16,Football: Late equaliser salvages point for Monaco in Brittany,Monaco saw their championship chances dented on Saturday as they were forced to come back twice before snatching a 2-2 draw at Lorient to fall five points behind Paris Saint-Germain.,"It took an 88th minute equaliser from Layvin Kurzawa to save pride for Claudio Ranieri's men as the visitors were staring down the barrel of defeat with time running out. ""I'm disappointed, I thought Monaco deserved the win,"" said Ranieri. ""It was a good game, but that's football,"" the Italian added. Lorient, who came into the match in 10th spot and within touching distance of the European places, took a shock lead on 13 minutes when Monaco failed to clear a corner kick. Kevin Monnet-Paquet picked up the loose ball following a poor clearance and whipped in a cross that Cameroon striker Vincent Aboubakar met with a firm header to beat Croatian 'keeper Danijel Subasic. However with half-time looming, Ranieri's men equalised on 41 minutes thanks to a clinical finish from Valere Germain. Emmanuel Riviere was the catalyst as he broke into the penalty area before laying off a perfect pass for Germain who made no mistake from close range. The second half provided a more balanced affair with both teams struggling to create clean scoring chances before Jeremie Aliadiere appeared to grab the winner with 17 minutes left. The striker who began his career at Arsenal before spells at Celtic, West Ham, Wolves and Middlesbrough banged the ball home from a rebound to pile the pressure on Monaco before Kurzawa came to their rescue. Monaco now know next Sunday's home clash against Paris Saint-Germain is a must-win situation with their deficit increased to five points after the leaders defeated Bordeaux 2-0 on Friday. Later, Saint-Etienne moved to within one point of third spot with a 3-0 defeat of Valenciennes at home. Lille who are in possession of the final Champions League spot travel to Nice on Sunday. Nantes failed to put pressure on the leading pack as they fell 1-0 at second-from-bottom Sochaux - a win would have lifted them to fifth ahead of the Sunday slate. Reims meanwhile lost 4-2 at home to Montpellier, Evian and Ajaccio's key relegation battle ended all square at 1-1, and Guingamp lost 3-2 at Bastia."
1223,01/02/2014,11:50,Football: Monaco dominate deadline day with double swoop,Monaco added to the capture of Bulgaria striker Dimitar Berbatov by signing powerful Tunisia defender Aymen Abennour right at the end of the January transfer window.,"Tunisian international Abdennour, 24, signed from Monaco's Ligue 1 rivals Toulouse, initially on loan but with an option to turn the deal into a permanent four-year agreement in the summer. ""Aymen Abdennour is a very solid defender with a profile that we didn't have in the squad. We have been following him for a long time and so we are very satisfied to have reached a deal with Toulouse to bring him to Monaco,"" vice-president Vadim Vasilyev told the club's website. That deal was passed just before the January transfer window slammed shut and came after the announcement that former Bayer Leverkusen, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United striker Berbatov had joined until the end of the season from Fulham to cover for the injured Falcao. Falcao suffered a serious knee injury playing in a French Cup tie last month and is set to miss the rest of the season as well as the World Cup in Brazil. After making major waves in the transfer market last summer, Monaco were one of the busiest French clubs again in the January window, although in general Ligue 1 is spared from the chaotic scenes that come on the final day of the window in England. Monaco had earlier signed Nigerian left-back Elderson Echiejile from Braga in Portugal and giant Ivorian striker Lacina Traore from Anzhi Makhachkala, although the latter was then loaned out to Everton. Paris Saint-Germain settled for just the one January signing in France midfielder Yohan Cabaye, who joined from Newcastle United for a fee of up to 23 million euros (£19m, $31.4m) including bonuses on Wednesday. Cabaye made his PSG debut from the bench in Friday's 2-0 Ligue 1 win against Bordeaux and almost marked the occasion with a goal, hitting the post from a late header. The most notable moves elsewhere in France on deadline day came at Saint-Etienne, where Algeria left-back Faouzi Ghoulam was sold to Napoli for a reported six million euros ($8.1m) and was replaced with Benoit Tremoulinas, capped by France but who had been with Dynamo Kiev. Les Verts also brought back France midfielder Josuha Guilavogui on loan, six months after selling him to Atletico Madrid."
1224,30/01/2014,16:05,"Football: Cabaye will make impact at PSG, says Blanc",Paris Saint-Germain coach Laurent Blanc insisted on Thursday that Yohan Cabaye will make his presence felt with the French champions despite the fierce competition for places.,"The 28-year-old France midfielder completed his transfer to the Ligue 1 leaders from Newcastle United on Wednesday, penning a three-and-a-half-year deal in the capital for a fee which is reported to be worth 23 million euros (£19m, $31.4m) including bonuses. Now Cabaye, who played under Blanc for France, must try and work his way into the coach's favoured 4-3-3 formation, where Blaise Matuidi, Marco Verratti and Thiago Motta are considered the first-choice trio in the centre of the park. However, Blanc said Cabaye was just the player he was looking for and said he had no doubts the former Lille man will get enough game time between now and the end of the season to guarantee his place in the France squad for the World Cup. ""I'm very satisfied. I said when the transfer window opened that I would be satisfied if we could bring in one extra player in midfield,"" said Blanc at a press conference ahead of Friday's home match against Bordeaux at the Parc des Princes. ""We had a good number of propositions but there weren't many who had all the characteristics we were looking for. ""I am happy because I know him well. But when I spoke to the directors a month ago I only gave them the profile I was looking for, not the name. ""He will play, you will see. When you have a three-man midfield, if you have four, five or six players who can play there it's not too many. ""People don't ask such questions of Bayern, (Manchester) City, Milan or Juve. The best three play, and then you get injuries and suspensions."" Indeed, with Italy playmaker Verratti suspended and Adrien Rabiot struggling with a knee problem, Cabaye could be thrown straight into the team on Friday, as long as his transfer is officially ratified in time. ""We have not received the letter. We are hoping it will arrive later today (Thursday). If it comes through, he will be in the squad. ""Otherwise he will have to wait until next Tuesday,"" he said, when PSG travel to Nantes in the semi-finals of the League Cup. A win for PSG against Bordeaux will see them move provisionally six points clear at the top of Ligue 1 before second-placed Monaco go to Lorient on Saturday."
1225,30/01/2014,02:30,Football: Cabaye ready to be thrown into PSG side,New signing Yohan Cabaye says he is prepared to be thrown straight into the Paris Saint-Germain side when the Ligue 1 leaders host Bordeaux at the Parc des Princes on Friday evening.,"The 28-year-old France midfielder completed his transfer from Newcastle United on Wednesday, penning a three-and-a-half-year deal in the capital for a fee which is reported to be worth 23 million euros (£19m, $31.4m) including bonuses. Cabaye, who made his name with Lille and played under PSG coach Laurent Blanc in the French national side, faces fierce competition for places in the Paris line-up, with Blaise Matuidi, Marco Verratti and Thiago Motta considered the first-choice trio in a 4-3-3 system. However, there could be an early opportunity for Cabaye to impress against Les Girondins with young Italian playmaker Verratti suspended and Adrien Rabiot, another option for Blanc, struggling with a knee problem. ""I am in a hurry to make my debut and represent ny new club. I feel fit and I hope to be in the squad and to participate,"" Cabaye said at his unveiling at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday evening. Cabaye also admitted that he had heard of the supposed scepticism about his signing from star players Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva, but there can be little doubt that PSG's rivals would love to be able to call on a player of his quality. The reigning champions sit three points clear at the top of the table and have a trip to second-placed Monaco to come next weekend. It is therefore crucial for them to get back to winning ways against Bordeaux after a 2-1 home defeat to Montpellier in the French Cup and a 1-1 draw at Guingamp in their last two outings. Blanc still has concerns surrounding the fitness of Ezequiel Lavezzi and captain Silva, while Bordeaux strike duo Cheick Diabate and Guillaume Hoarau are struggling for fitness just now, as is playmaker Ludovic Obraniak. Francis Gillot's side have already lost three times to PSG this season, but they did beat Saint-Etienne 2-0 last weekend and a surprise victory here could see them go fourth. ""There is no magic formula,"" said ex-PSG striker Hoarau when asked what was needed to beat the league leaders. ""You need a little bit of everything. We can't afford to let them play their game. People say they are not at their best just now - I'm not sure we can use that term but we need to hope that they perhaps don't play at 100 percent."" Monaco may be without the injured Radamel Falcao for the rest of the season but they didn't miss the Colombian in last weekend's 2-0 win against Marseille and will hope to make it eight victories in 10 league games when they visit Lorient on Saturday. Lorient themselves have lost just once in 10 in the league, though, and are usually a tough proposition on their artificial pitch in Brittany. Third-placed Lille go to Nice on Sunday looking to halt a sequence of four league games without a win in a match that could see talented right-back Sebastien Corchia make his debut following his move from Sochaux. ""I had other opportunities but I preferred to come to Lille because the coach (Rene Girard) phoned me personally. They are an ambitious club who will help me progress,"" said Corchia, who has in the past been linked with Bayern Munich and Juventus. Another club who have been busy in the January transfer window are Rennes, who could have new recruits Paul-Georges Ntep, Ola Toivonen and Kamil Grosicki in their side when they entertain Lyon on Sunday. Lyon, inspired by former Rennes playmaker Yoann Gourcuff, are aiming to extend a run of 12 matches without defeat in Brittany. Fourth-placed Saint-Etienne entertain Valenciennes on Saturday while Marseille, in fifth, are at home to Toulouse on Sunday. Fixtures (kick-offs 1900 GMT unless stated)"

""I was won over by the ambitious project at Paris Saint-Germain and I can't wait to join this exceptional squad and help the team reach its objectives in France and in Europe,"" said Cabaye, who passed a medical earlier in the day in Paris. PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi added: ""The transfer of Yohan Cabaye is further proof of the club's capacity to attract the best French and overseas players."" Reports in France indicate that PSG will pay 20 million euros (£16.5m pounds, $27.3m) for the player, plus a potential three million euros more in bonuses. Cabaye must now compete for a place in a three-man PSG midfield where Italy duo Thiago Motta and Marco Verratti and his France colleague Blaise Matuidi have been first picks this season. ""It is hard for any player to turn down PSG at the moment. I accepted the offer immediately,"" he said at a press conference at the Parc des Princes as he looked forward to helping Laurent Blanc's side in their bid to retain the Ligue 1 title while also aiming for success in the League Cup and the Champions League. ""The midield here is very good and the coach has given me no guarantees but I have no problem with that. I think competition for places is a good thing."" PSG coach Blanc is a confirmed fan of Cabaye having given him his France debut in 2010. Cabaye joined Newcastle in 2011 for £4.3million from Lille, with whom he won the Ligue 1 and French Cup double in his last season. The 26-times capped midfielder only had good things to say about his time in England despite his initial disappointment at Newcastle's decision to reject an offer from Arsenal last summer and a difficult relationship with the Magpies' sporting director Joe Kinnear. ""I had two and a half extraordinary years there and discovered the Premier League with them,"" he said. ""I was at a good club but the league is so difficult that we struggled to get into the Champions League. ""We had a common agreement (for him to leave). Last summer it didn't happen but the opportunity came up this time."""

They have only one win in their last six league matches and three defeats in a row in all competitions. What's more, their notoriously fiery fans turned viciously against them last week with one hardline ultra group blasting the players as ""sub-human"" in an internet posting that was later taken down. Not only are matters on the pitch and in the stands causing concern but rumours are rife that the dressing room is far from a harmonious place. Jose Anigo's team, the 1993 European champions, currently sit nine points off the Champions League qualifying positions, although they do have a game in hand. Their one saving grace on Wednesday is that they will be entertaining a team in dire straits having recently dropped into the relegation zone. With home matches against Toulouse and Bastia next up, a victory is a must if the nine-time champions are to start to turn their increasingly miserable season around. Even so, Anigo is far from confident, saying: ""Winning twice in a row at home is not easy, so three times!"" As for Valenciennes, their coach Ariel Jacobs is wary of a potential backlash from the angered home side. ""I don't like to speculate on the level of morale at our opponents,"" he said. ""Marseille are coming off three matches without a win, being eliminated from two cup competitions, will there be a revolt? ""We don't know. Do they have pressure and doubts? We don't know that either. ""We can't rely on that, we have to be ready physically and mentally; Marseille's quality will ensure this is a tough match."""

Cabaye will reportedly travel to Paris to undergo a medical examination on Tuesday, ruling him out of Newcastle's trip to Norwich City in the Premier League later in the day. Speaking on Monday, Newcastle manager Alan Pardew had expressed pessimism about the club's chances of holding onto Cabaye, who signed from Lille for a fee of £4.3 million in 2011.

And Lacazette secured victory inside the final quarter of an hour as he finished after being set up by substitute Jimmy Briand at the end of a breakaway, taking his tally for the season to 12 goals in the process. Remi Garde's side have started 2014 with six successive wins in all competitions and are now unbeaten in 12 games since a 4-0 defeat away to Paris Saint-Germain at the beginning of December. That remains their only defeat in their last 18 outings and Sunday's victory saw them move provisionally up to fifth place in the table, three points adrift of Saint-Etienne before Les Verts face Bordeaux later on Sunday. Also on Sunday, Monaco begin life without injured top scorer Radamel Falcao when they play host to Marseille at the Stade Louis II.

The draw is enough for the defending champions to extend their lead at the top of the table to six points, although second-placed Monaco can trim the gap back to three with a win against Marseille on Sunday. PSG had endured a mixed week, thumping Nantes 5-0 to underline their superiority over the rest of Ligue 1 before being surprisingly eliminated from the French Cup by Montpellier. At the Stade du Roudourou, coach Laurent Blanc was without injured captain Thiago Silva, so Marquinhos lined up in the heart of the defence, while there was a first start in Ligue 1 since the beginning of December for Javier Pastore. And against opponents who had not won in six league games and had scored just three times since the start of November, PSG for once struggled to stamp their authority on proceedings. Zlatan Ibrahimovic had a shot from 40 yards turned around the post by Guy Roland Ndy Assembe with the visitors' best chance of the first half, but that came just two minutes before the interval. Guingamp were a greater threat at the other end, with the 21-year-old Rachid Alioui taking advantage of a rare start to volley just wide early on and then send in a long-range free-kick that moved in the air and was turned desperately onto the crossbar by PSG 'keeper Salvatore Sirigu. Edinson Cavani had an effort correctly ruled out for offside at the start of the second half, and the game looked set to peter out to a goalless draw on a difficult pitch. However, the home side had other ideas and took the lead in the 84th minute when striker Yatabare stole a yard on Marquinhos to head in from a right-wing corner. It was the Malian striker's sixth league goal of the campaign, and his first since early October, and it sparked wild scenes of celebration among the packed crowd inside a stadium which boasts a capacity greater than that of the small town of Guingamp itself. However, the giants from the capital were rescued soon after when Brazilian centre-back Alex got to a corner before Ndy Assembe to head home and restore parity. ""It is always difficult to win games. We came here to win even if we had a lot of respect for Guingamp,"" said Blanc. ""It is disappointing but I am still satisfied that we never gave up and came back to get a deserved point. ""We were not as good today. Why? I don't want to hide behind it but the state of the pitch was deplorable. It is the case for both sides but it handicaps the team that plays the most football.

While their hopes of winning an unprecedented haul of four trophies went up in smoke, Blanc remained philosophical heading into Saturday's trip to Guingamp. ""It was a typical Cup match and sadly it was us that went out which is disappointing,"" said the former France and Bordeaux coach. ""If we can take something positive out of it, it's the fact that we have one competition less to worry about and our calendar will be less packed. ""Certain players needed game time and it showed (against Montpellier), but the Cup serves for that purpose too,"" he added. Monaco come into their Sunday evening tie at home to Marseille five points behind the capital club, but despite qualifying for the last 16 of the French Cup on Wednesday, they were counting the cost of a potentially season-ending knee ligament injury to star striker Radamel Falcao. The Colombian was stretched off just before half-time of the 3-0 win over fifth division Chasselay leaving his Italian coach Claudio Ranieri blaming the officials. ""If Falcao has something serious, it is the referee's fault,"" said Ranieri. Teammate Jeremy Toulalan also expressed his concern about the man who has found the back of the net nine times in league action this season. ""It doesn't look very, very good,"" expressed the playmaker as Falcao's World Cup hopes looked slim. Lyon are now the only French club maintaining a bid for four trophies after they sailed through their French Cup tie at amateur side Yzeure. Yoann Gourcuff's spectacular return to form has been the foundation for Remi Garde's men and they are also into the knockout phase of the Europa League as well as the League Cup semi-finals. While their chances of overhauling PSG remain far-fetched as they face a 19-point deficit, a win at home to Evian on Saturday could bring them within six points of the final Champions League spot. Third-placed Lille have staggered in recent weeks and hold just a three-point advantage on Saint-Etienne as they host Rennes in the weekend curtain raiser on Friday. Saint-Etienne meanwhile will look to compound Bordeaux's dismal exit in the French Cup after the holders were sensationally dumped out of the competition by amateur club L'Ile-Rousse in Corsica. The weekend's key relegation ties feature last-placed Ajaccio at home to Herve Renard's second-from-bottom Sochaux while Valenciennes are four points from safety as they host mid-table Lorient. Toulouse await Bastia, Nice are on the road at Montpellier and Nantes entertain Reims at La Beaujoire stadium. Fixtures (all kick-offs 1900 GMT unless noted):"
1237,22/01/2014,22:54,"Football: PSG suffer Cup shock, Falcao hurt in Monaco win","Paris Saint-Germain were surprisingly beaten 2-1 by Montpellier in the round of 32 of the French Cup on Wednesday, while an injury to star striker Radamel Falcao overshadowed Monaco's win against minnows Chasselay.","Unbeaten at home since November 2012 and flying high at the top of Ligue 1, PSG were expected to see off a struggling Montpellier side at the Parc des Princes. However, the visitors have improved recently under coach Rolland Courbis and took the lead 20 minutes in when Daniel Congre headed in a Siaka Tiene cross. Home coach Laurent Blanc left Zlatan Ibrahimovic on the bench at kick-off, although that allowed Edinson Cavani to play in his favoured central striking position and the Uruguayan converted a Lucas Digne centre to draw PSG level on the half-hour. There were chances at both ends after that but it was Montpellier who snatched a winner midway through the second half, Victor Hugo Montano heading in a corner to stun the home support. While Montpellier had their Colombian striker to thank for taking them through, an injury to his compatriot Radamel Falcao overshadowed Monaco's 3-0 victory at Chasselay earlier. Falcao crumbled to the ground following a challenge by Soner Ertek inside the Chasselay area -- for which no penalty was given -- just before the interval and needed lengthy treatment before being carried away on a stretcher. He had given the principality club the lead just before the half-hour mark, tapping into an empty net after Valere Germain had headed down a cross for his 11th goal in French football. Emmanuel Riviere replaced the former Atletico Madrid striker after half-time and went on to score two more goals in a game that was played at Lyon's Stade de Gerland. The injury to Falcao and the fall-out from it somewhat marred what should have been a special occasion for fourth-tier strugglers Chasselay and their star player, veteran former Monaco captain Ludovic Giuly. ""When you play against a team from a lower division, they are going to play really hard. That's normal, and that is what I tell my players before the match but it's not possible for a referee to blow his whistle for free-kicks without ever booking anyone,"" moaned Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri after the game. ""If Falcao has something serious, it is the referee's fault. ""Everyone wants to play like in England and let the game go. It's not possible here. The referee must see when there is a foul and blow his whistle."" Meanwhile, Monaco released a statement in which they said: ""The player Radamel Falcao was hit in the left knee. Must await further tests in the coming days to clarify the exact nature of the injury."" Ertek himself admitted to being upset at the potential implications of his challenge. ""I am gutted. I honestly don't think I touched him,"" he said. ""Did he hurt his own ankle? Did I touch him accidentally? I don't know but it ruined my match."" The injury to the 60 million-euro (£50.4m, $82.5m) striker also stole the headlines from tiny Corsican club L'Ile-Rousse, of the fifth division, who stunned the holders Bordeaux. In a game played in Ajaccio because their own ground was not deemed suitable for the tie, L'Ile-Rousse held out at 0-0 for 120 minutes before winning 4-3 in a penalty shoot-out. Toulouse were also knocked out, losing 2-1 at fourth-tier Moulins, but Lyon survived a scare in their tie away to fourth-tier club Yzeure, winning 3-1 after falling behind in the 75th minute. Yzeure, from central France, had eliminated Ligue 1 Lorient in the previous round but Jimmy Briand quickly brought the 2012 Cup winners level before a terrific Yoann Gourcuff strike put them in front and Steed Malbranque sealed the win late on. There was considerable drama on Tuesday too as Marseille lost 5-4 at home to south-coast rivals Nice while three other Ligue 1 sides -- AC Ajaccio, Sochaux and SC Bastia -- all lost to second-tier opponents. As a result, only seven Ligue 1 clubs will enter the draw for the last 16 of the competition."

Lille have somehow managed to stay in touch with their financially stronger rivals, after former Montpellier title-winning coach Rene Girard fashioned a first half of the season that saw them lose just three times in 19 outings. The northern outfit, who last won the French title in 2011 under current Roma boss Rudi Garcia, come into the weekend four points off top spot as they await eighth-placed Reims in the final match on Sunday evening. Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri said earlier this week that he wants to slash his extensive squad during the transfer window but admits it is a luxury problem that most managers would love to have. ""I would like to reduce the squad because it is not easy to train with 24 or 25 players,"" said the much travelled Italian, whose former clubs include Inter Milan, Roma, Juventus, Valencia, Atletico Madrid, Chelsea and Napoli. ""It is not always easy to sell players but I am professional and the players are all professional, but to have so many players allows me to have more choice for my selection,"" he added. His Colombian striker Radamel Falcao finished the first half of the season with nine league goals, six behind PSG top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and his goal last weekend helped the Cote d'Azur club into the next round of the French Cup as they came back to defeat lower division Vannes 3-2. PSG were forced to spend several days in Brittany as they awaited the necessary conditions to play their twice-postponed cup tie against Brest before finally prevailing 5-2 on Wednesday. Ibrahimovic was once again their catalyst with a first-half hat-trick to sink the second division side. Laurent Blanc's side have lost just one match in all competitions this season, a league defeat at bogey side Evian. Saint-Etienne sit alone in fourth after defeating Evian 1-0 in a rescheduled midweek fixture as they overtook Bordeaux. They can keep their run of form going at Guingamp on Saturday, albeit with 90 minutes added football in their legs, after the Evian triumph. Bordeaux have closed in on the European places despite a dreadful start to the campaign, but a 13-point deficit to PSG may likely be a bridge too far as they get set to tackle Toulouse at home on Saturday. Marseille, Nantes and Reims are locked in a tie for sixth on 29 points and play Evian away, Lorient at home and Lille away respectively. Second from bottom Sochaux have been busy in the early days of the window as coach Herve Renard brought in two of his former Zambian African champions Stoppila Sunzu and Nathan Sinkala, as well as Marseille's Ghanaian striker Jordan Ayew on loan. Renard, who is in charge of his first Ligue 1 side, has his work cut out to erase the team's six point ladder to safety.

1249,01/01/2014,22:45,Football: Rivals worried by PSG threat - president,"Paris Saint-Germain president Nasser Al-Khelaifi insisted that rivals are ""worried"" about the threat posed by his club and launched a passionate defence of his home country Qatar in an interview with AFP on Wednesday.","Qatar-owned PSG are in the Gulf state on a winter training camp and will play Real Madrid in a glamour friendly in Doha on Thursday before returning to France to resume their domestic campaign. The French capital club have emerged as one of the most powerful names in football since being bought out by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011, and are now a genuine threat to the likes of Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich on the European stage. They have been helped by the signing of a huge sponsorship deal with the Qatar Tourism Authority, which could net the club up to 200 million euros ($274m) a year. That deal raised eyebrows at a time when UEFA are trying to implement their Financial Fair Play rules, but Al-Khelaifi says PSG are doing nothing wrong. ""I don't understand. Are they worried about the competition itself or about the sponsors? Sometimes they are worried by PSG as a club,"" he told AFP. ""Maybe that's the reason. We respect every club, we don't enter into any other club's subjects or internal affairs. This is between us and UEFA. ""Of course it's a real contract, we had a meeting with the financial fair-play committee. We have been very transparent, we have answered every question. ""What I understand is that Qatar invest a lot in sport to promote the country. This is a big part of the investment of Qatar, investing in PSG. ""Because today everybody talks about PSG and Qatar. So I think this is something that gives a huge exposure. It helps tourism and that's what we explained (in relation to FFP)."" Al-Khelaifi, a former tennis player, also sought to defend Qatar against allegations that the country has abused the rights of workers involved in construction projects ahead of the 2022 World Cup, which it will host. ""As a Qatari, it hurt me of course,"" he said. ""Someone took very badly of my country. I know my country. The law is very strict. No one in our country from the government or the people would accept seeing foreign companies go against the law. ""Honestly, I think (criticism of Qatar) was unfair. I make mistakes myself...but it's not because I make mistakes that my country is bad."" Under Al-Khelaifi's presidency, PSG's outlay on players has been enormous, capped by the 60 million-euro ($82.5m) recruitment of Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani last summer. The January transfer window is now open, and PSG have been linked with moves for several players this month, including Chelsea star Juan Mata, Juventus and France midfielder Paul Pogba and Yohan Cabaye of Newcastle United. However, Al-Khelaifi played down suggestions that the club will add to coach Laurent Blanc's squad this month. ""Today I don't think we need to recruit anyone. We have a strong team, very well organised. But you never know. The mercato (transfer window) is lasting one month, you can have injuries, lots of things can happen,"" he said. ""Of course the coach wants to buy players. If I was a coach I would like to buy everybody. He's very ambitious, he wants the team to be stronger. We'll see what will happen. ""It's a long-term project. We know what we want, our objectives. It's not just buying players. We need to build the new history of the club. The club has won the title three times and we need more trophies."" PSG have a Champions League last-16 tie with Bayer Leverkusen to look forward to and are also on course to retain the Ligue 1 title, sitting three points clear of Monaco at the top of the table halfway through the season. When Blanc was appointed in the summer to replace Real Madrid-bound Carlo Ancelotti, few thought he would remain at the Parc des Princes for the long term, but Al-Khelaifi said he is delighted with Blanc. ""We started something with Laurent Blanc and we're so satisfied with his job. I'm satisfied with the choice we made with him,"" said the 40-year-old."

But 13 of those companies are expected to be Ligue 1 clubs and while the government expects to generate 210 million euros from the tax, 44 million euros of that will come from football clubs. ""The decision of the Constitutional Council to approve the 75 percent tax is sad news for French football,"" said UCPF in a statement sent to AFP on Monday. ""UCPF continues to consider this tax as profoundly unfair and anti-economical."" UCPF also called on the government to reform the law to improve ""the competitiveness of French clubs"". The law would see high earners such as Paris Saint-Germain's Zlatan Ibrahimovic, rumoured to be on around 14 million euros a year net, suddenly hit with up to 7 million euros of extra tax to pay. Given his contract it would probably fall on PSG to stump up the extra funds but in a league where clubs are already losing money, such commitments could force teams to sell off their top stars and highest earners to balance the books, thus weakening the league on the European stage."
1251,30/12/2013,15:36,"Football: Messi more than a dream signing, says Ibrahimovic","Signing Lionel Messi would take French champions Paris Saint-Germain to the next level, according to their current star forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic.","Press rumours in France suggest the big-spending Qatari-backed Parisians are in the market for a record bid for the Argentine wizard. And Ibrahimovic, who failed to strike up a particularly successful partnership with Messi during his one season at Barcelona, believes signing the four-time Ballon d'Or winner would not just allow PSG to dream of bigger and better, but would make them a whole new force to be reckoned with in European competition. ""If he's up for sale then the whole world will be after him, not just PSG,"" said Ibrahimovic from the French champions' winter training camp in Doha. ""I don't know the situation but I think he's very happy at Barcelona. ""The press creates this but only he knows the truth. ""PSG's project is to dream bigger but if you buy Messi, you don't dream bigger, you are bigger."" Signings such as that of Ibrahimovic, Brazilians Thiago Silva and Lucas and Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani have got many people believing PSG can genuinely challenge for Champions League honours this season. Last year they reached the quarter-finals where they lost on away goals to Barca, while their best result in the competition remains their semi-final run in 1995. And although PSG are champions of France and leading the way in Ligue 1 this season too, Ibrahimovic is determined to go further. ""I'm never satisfied, I want to win. We've progressed well and quickly. The team has come on very quickly in the right direction,"" he said. ""We play very good football, we have the ball, we create chances. ""There's a high level of collective quality, our mentality is progressing. Everything's going in the right direction and I'm delighted."" PSG will play Real Madrid in a friendly in Doha on Thursday and Ibrahimovic is taking that match very seriously. ""Unfortunately it's a friendly match but we'll treat it like a competitive match. It would be good for confidence to win."""

""Will he be back (by Sunday)? We have no idea. I hope so but I can't give an answer,"" said Blanc at a press conference on Friday. Cavani scored both goals in the 2-1 League Cup last-16 win against Saint-Etienne at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday before being allowed to travel to Montevideo the next day to deal with unspecified personal affairs. ""We can always make a player play in extreme conditions, but at the same time we need to think about the games coming up in January and February. We can't just do anything,"" Blanc added. ""If he does come back, it is not the best preparation but there is nothing else we can do."" Cavani has scored 12 Ligue 1 goals this season and 18 in all competitions. His partnership with Zlatan Ibrahimovic has produced a total of 40 goals in all competitions."

""We have spoken about it but I think you (the media) are confirming certain things that aren't yet in place,"" Blanc, who was also a teammate of Barthez at United, told football weekly France Football. ""It's hopefull. It would be the same role that he had with the France team when I arrived and for which I kept him. He was a consultant. ""I think his experience at the highest level can be beneficial to the goalkeepers at PSG,"" continued Blanc who left the France job following the team's quarter-final exit at Euro 2012 and was replaced by Didier Deschamps. ""Will it happen? I don't know anything. Fabien is interested but there is nothing definite for the moment."" Barthez has also been active away from the football pitch and has recently embarked on a successful career as a race car driver."
1255,18/12/2013,23:45,Football: Cavani double eliminates holders St Etienne,A double by Paris Saint Germain's Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani eliminated French League Cup holders St Etienne 2-1 from this season's competition after extra-time of their Last 16 clash on Wednesday.,"Cavani -- who has scored 18 times in 23 games for PSG since he joined from Napoli in the close season -- had given the hosts the lead in the first-half only for former PSG striker Turkish international Mevlut Erding to level in the second period to force extra-time. However, Cavani grabbed the winner two minutes from the end of extra-time, though, he looked to be in an offside position when he knocked home Jeremy Menez's low cross. It was revenge for PSG as they had been knocked out by St Etienne on penalties in the competition last season. PSG's bitter historical rivals Marseille also progressed by the same scoreline against Toulouse which resulted in their interim coach Jose Anigo announcing he would still be in the role after the winter break as he celebrated his first win in charge. Former Toulouse star Andre-Pierre Gignac grabbed Marseille's winner from the penalty spot in a competition that Anigo -- who stepped in after Elie Baup was sacked earlier this month -- said is low on his list of targets compared to the French Cup despite Marseille having almost made it their own in recent years having won it in 2010, 2011 and 2012. ""I am very happy with this result,"" said Anigo. ""But I know that first thing in the morning it will be time to sit down and assess how we approach this weekend's game with Bordeaux which will not be an easy one as they are the side playing with the most confidence at the moment."" Earlier seven-time French champions Lyon reached the quarter-finals with a 3-2 win over fellow Ligue 1 side Reims. Lyon, who have won the League Cup just once in 2001, twice took a two goal lead only to see Reims come back to trail by just a goal. Goals by France international forward Bafetimbi Gomis and Alexandre Lacazette -- both scorers in Sunday's 2-2 draw with Marseille -- seemingly put Lyon in a comfortable position at 2-0 up by the hour mark. Gomis nodded home at the far post from Lacazette's cross in the 58th minute while the latter extended their lead on the hour with a super right-foooted shot after excellent lead-up work by playmaker Yoann Gourcuff. Gourcuff, whose inconsistency has attracted criticism, restored their two goal advantage -- after Prince O'Niangue had made it 2-1 -- eight minutes from time with a cracking shot from long range having already gone close only to see his shot come back off the post. However, Lyon's habit of letting slip leads throughout the season -- they led Marseille 2-0 last Sunday before being held to a draw -- looked as if it was going to happen again as Reims scored four minutes from the end of normal time through Floyd Ayite's penalty."

1257,18/12/2013,11:47,Football: Monaco emerge as only threat to dominant PSG,"Paris Saint-Germain began what they hope will be an era of dominance in French football in 2013, a year that was also marked by the return of Monaco as a force and the national team's dramatic qualification for the World Cup.","Nineteen years after they were last crowned champions, PSG won their third title and their first trophy since the Qatari takeover at the Parc des Princes in 2011 under Italian coach Carlo Ancelotti. The capital club's strength compared to the rest of the country was frightening, epitomised by player of the year Zlatan Ibrahimovic. His goals helped the side reach the Champions League quarter-finals, where they bowed out on away goals to Barcelona, and his impact was such that the verb 'to zlatan' became commonly used slang in French. Glamour was added during the second half of last season by David Beckham's cameo at the Parc des Princes, the veteran Englishman finishing his glittering career with a Ligue 1 winner's medal. In a touch of class, Beckham promised to donate his salary to a local children's hospital, but PSG's success came at a big cost to owners Qatar Sports Investments, who spent huge sums building a formidable squad. As sports daily L'Equipe said: ""Never has a French league title come at such a price for the owner of a club"". And turmoil soon followed. Ancelotti left for Real Madrid, while sporting director Leonardo departed too after being banned from all official functions for 14 months for shoving a referee. Ancelotti was replaced by former France coach Laurent Blanc, who was considered to be little more than a stop-gap when appointed but who has succeeded in further improving the team. Few would bet against them winning a second successive title and making another big impression in the Champions League in the New Year. The year saw other grand old names enjoy success, with Bordeaux winning the French Cup and Saint-Etienne ending a 32-year trophy drought when they lifted the League Cup. But Monaco now appear to be the only realistic threat to PSG's dominance. Promoted back to Ligue 1 after a two-year absence, their billionaire Russian owner Dmitry Rybolovlev splashed the cash, including an outlay of 60 million euros ($82.4m) on Radamel Falcao from Atletico Madrid. That deal was briefly a French league record until PSG hit back with the 64 million-euro recruitment of Edinson Cavani from Napoli, and a two-way fight for supremacy was underway amid concerns that Ligue 1 was about to become as lopsided a contest as the Barcelona and Real Madrid-dominated Spanish league. Monaco's rivals have set about challenging their right to benefit from the favourable tax laws in the principality, that particular imbalance having been made all the more acute by the French government's introduction of a 75 percent tax rate on earnings over a million euros which almost led to a strike by angry clubs. But, as that row drags on, the French have good reason to be proud of their national team again. Didier Deschamps's side toiled for much of 2013, but their remarkable recovery from a 2-0 first-leg defeat to Ukraine in their World Cup qualifying play-off in November raised spirits. Les Bleus won the second leg 3-0 at the Stade de France to book their ticket to the 2014 finals. Now there is hope that a team featuring Ballon d'Or candidate Franck Ribery can make an impression in Brazil as they build towards Euro 2016, which France will host. By then, some of the exciting young stars who helped France win this year's under-20 World Cup in Turkey, including Paul Pogba, Lucas Digne and Florian Thauvin, should be key players in the full national team. No wonder French Football Federation president Noel Le Graet felt compelled to describe the end of 2013 as ""a new beginning"" for the sport in the country."
1258,10/12/2013,02:25,Football: Destiny in Dortmund's hands for Marseille decider,Borussia Dortmund can keep alive their bid to return to the Champions League final for the second straight season with victory over Marseille at the Velodrome on Wednesday.,"The Bundesliga side will reach the knockout stages next February by taking maximum points regardless of what happens in the second Group H fixture between Napoli and Arsenal in Italy. Napoli, who are on nine points with Dortmund and three behind Arsenal, must beat the Premier League pacesetters by three clear goals, should Dortmund also win in France. However it will be the German club who go through with Rafa Benitez's team due to their superior head-to-head record against both clubs. Arsenal will go through with a draw or a defeat by two goals or less. Marseille meanwhile are in turmoil, and fired coach Elie Baup following their 1-0 home defeat against Nantes on Friday, replacing him with Jose Anigo. They cannot even dream of the consolation of Europa League football in the New Year as they are pointless following five straight defeats. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp looked on as his side suffered their fourth league defeat of the season on Saturday when they slumped 1-0 at home to second-placed Bayer Leverkusen but the price was heavier than just three points. Germany midfielder Sven Bender is ruled out after limping off with an ankle injury while Turkey international Nuri Sahin is doubtful after slightly tearing an ankle ligament. ""We lost 1-0, but that's actually the least of our problems,"" Klopp said following the match. Dortmund are already withouth midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, defender Mats Hummels, Neven Subotic and Marcel Schmelzer as Klopp's injury worries show no sign of easing. He is also down to his fourth choice at centre-back, having played Bender out of position in the 3-1 win over Napoli on matchday five, as Manuel Friedrich is cup-tied and Hummels injured. ""We now find ourselves in the situation where we are constantly having to react,"" said Klopp. ""But necessity is the mother of invention, so we'll see what happens. ""We have certainly had easier moments, but we have to fight on."" Caretaker manager Anigo takes charge of his first match back at the helm of Marseille after a four year spell between 2001 and 2005, preceded before then as sporting director. The club, who are fifth in Ligue 1 and 13 points back of Paris Saint-Germain, parted ways with Baup following their sixth league defeat of the season on Friday."

PSG stayed top on Saturday with a 5-0 demolition of rock-bottom Sochaux. ""The matches are always complicated and difficult,"" said Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri. ""Ajaccio played very deep but I saw that we had a desire to win. I am satisfied with three points."" With top scorer Radamel Falcao out of action with a thigh strain for a third successive match, Monaco's scoring onus once again fell on the shoulders of his Colombian compatriot James Rodriguez who had netted twice in his last two games. But it was Anthony Martial who had the first shot on target after 16 minutes with the teenager's fierce drive well-saved by Ajaccio's Mexican goalkeeper Francisco Ochoa. Ivory Coast striker Gadji Celi Carmen Junior had Ajaccio's first attempt on goal after 30 minutes, but Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic saved well. Martial again came close early in the second half but a diving header went just wide. Ajaccio's task became even tougher just after the hour mark when Jean-Baptiste Pierazzi was red-carded for a foul on Rodriguez. Once Riviere had grabbed the deserved lead, Monaco twice came close to increasing their lead with Rodriguez and Portuguese international Joao Moutinho both denied by the woodwork from free-kicks. Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama's run of not conceding a goal ended after 1,062 minutes on Sunday with an own goal by Lille team-mate Simon Kjaer in the clash with Bordeaux. The Danish defender deflected a harmless looking shot by Bordeaux's Landry N'Guemo which tantalisingly hit the post before entering the net in the 28th minute. It was the first time Enyeama had had to pick the ball out of his net since September 15 in the 2-0 defeat by Nice. It also proved to be the only goal of the game. Enyeama had been closing in on the overall Ligue 1 record of 1176 minutes held by Gaetan Huard for Bordeaux during the 1992-93 campaign. On Saturday, Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice and created two goals as PSG routed Sochaux. The big Swede took his league goals tally to 13 thanks to an all-round masterclass which helped PSG quickly recover from their midweek loss to Evian in what was their first defeat of the season. That setback ended PSG's 36-match undefeated run and it was Sochaux who were cast in the role of fall guys on Saturday. Ibrahimovic scored twice in the last five minutes after Thiago Silva, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Edinson Cavani, with his 11th of the season, had also hit the target. PSG coach Laurent Blanc praised the tireless workload of Ibrahimovic and Cavani. ""They play a lot but they are the major players in our team,"" said Blanc. ""All big clubs need their most important players. There are just two more matches until the winter break and the league is our objective as we have already done our work in the Champions League (PSG are certain of a last 16 place). ""I will try to put together the best team possible to take the points in these two league games."" Earlier Saturday, flagging Marseille sacked manager Elie Baup, the dismissal coming at the end of a week when the south coast club suffered two successive Ligue 1 defeats.

That setback ended PSG's 36-match undefeated run and it was rock-bottom Sochaux who were cast in the role of fall guys on Saturday. Ibrahimovic scored twice in the last five minutes after Thiago Silva, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Edinson Cavani, with his 11th of the season, had also hit the target. PSG were on top from the start at the Parc des Princes where Sochaux had lost on their last five visits, conceding 16 goals. Ibrahimovic had two early opportunities -- grazing the post in the eighth minute before smashing a free-kick into the wall, five minutes later. Their pressure told after 14 minutes with the big Swede once again involved. His pass to the far post allowed Silva to slot the ball right-footed past Pierrick Cros in the Sochaux goal. Ibrahimovic then freed Thiago Motta who was thwarted by the busy Cros. PSG continued to toy with the visitors with Marco Verratti, Cavani and Maxwell causing a string of problems. Cavani came closest to adding a second goal just on the stroke of half-time when his 20-metre drive was kept out by Cros. PSG were rewarded for their endeavour with a second goal in the opening minute of the second half. Lavezzi scored from a Motta pass although there was a hint of offside when the Argentine striker collected the ball. On the hour mark, Cavani made it 3-0 and again Ibrahimovic was involved. The Swede crossed for Cavani at the far post who controlled the ball before quickly hitting the target. Ibrahimovic deservedly grabbed the fourth in the 85th minute with a brutally-struck free-kick from 20 metres which fizzed past the despairing dive of Cros. Cavani then teed-up Ibrahimovic in the 89th minute for the fifth. Lille can close the gap on PSG to one point with a win at Bordeaux on Sunday while third-placed Monaco, who are five points off the lead, meet Ajaccio. Earlier Saturday, flagging Marseille sacked manager Elie Baup, the dismissal coming at the end of a week when the south coast club suffered two successive Ligue 1 defeats. The 1-0 loss to Nantes on Friday, which followed a similar reverse at Lille left Marseille in fifth and they now trail PSG by 13 points. ""Elie Baup has left after talks between the (club) president and the coach at the end of training on Saturday morning,"" said a Marseille spokesman. The Velodrome club's sporting director Jose Anigo, a former manager at the club himself, will assume temporary control up to the French league's winter break. ""He will be in the dug out against (Borussia) dortmund on Wednesday night."" The 58-year-old Baup was appointed at the start of the 2011-2012 season, replacing current France manager Didier Deschamps and guiding Marseille into second place behind PSG last season. In contrast to last term, this season has been marred by a run of poor performances in the league and the loss of all five matches in the Champions League. Baup is the second manager to leave his Ligue 1 job in 48 hours, after Montpellier split with Jean Fernandez on Thursday -- the latter was replaced by veteran Rolland Courbis on Saturday. Anigo's first match at the helm is against Borussia Dortmund in the sixth and final Champions League group game with only pride at stake on Wednesday."

In contrast to last term, this season has been marred by a run of poor performances in the league and the loss of all five matches in the Champions League. Baup is the second manager to leave his Ligue 1 job in 48 hours, after Montpellier split with Jean Fernandez on Thursday. Anigo's first match at the helm is against Borussia Dortmund in the sixth and final Champions League group game with only pride at stake on Wednesday. In Ligue 1, Marseille host former multiple French champions Lyon next Sunday, followed by the visit of Bordeaux. In the French League Cup, Marseille, who won the 2010 league title under Deschamps in 2010, face Toulouse."
1264,05/12/2013,12:11,Football: PSG cling to top spot as rivals close in,"Following Paris Saint-Germain's shock defeat in midweek at Evian and a milestone week for Ligue 1 goalkeepers, the race in France is wide open with three games remaining until the winter break.","PSG coach Laurent Blanc suffered his first defeat in charge since replacing current Real Madrid handler Carlo Ancelotti, and it was the capital club's first defeat in 36 matches, one short of the team record. The unexpected setback has allowed Lille to close within one point and Monaco two, after both clubs picked up wins over Marseille and Nice respectively, heading into the weekend's action. It was also a notable week for veteran goalkeepers Mickael Landreau of Bastia and Lille's Vincent Enyeama. Landreau, who began his incredible career between the sticks for Nantes in 1996 at just 17, set a new mark for top flight appearances in midweek when he raised the bar to 603, one better than former Monaco custodian Jean-Luc Ettori who set the previous record between 1975 and 1992. Nigeria's African champion Enyeama was also very much the talk of the league when he extended his number of minutes without conceding a goal to 1035 with a match-winning performance against Marseille. He is now within 141 minutes of the Ligue 1 all-time record of 1176 minutes unbeaten, held by Gaetan Huard and set in 1993. ""In the dressing room, it was incredible, everyone congratulated me,"" confessed Enyeama following the 1-0 win and passing the mythical 1000 minute mark. ""Above all, I am just very proud to be here and be a part of this team,"" he added. Landreau equalled Lettori's mark last Sunday with a clean sheet during Bastia's 2-0 win over Evian before breaking the record against Corsican neighbours Ajaccio in a 1-1 draw on Wednesday. Ettori, 58, was diplomatic after losing his long standing record. ""It is not just an anecdote and created a buzz,"" he said in reference to his mark. ""Six hundred and three matches is not insignificant, it's huge in fact and I'm happy for Mickael,"" said Ettori. ""I played 750 matches for the same club (all competitions) and that is a record that is going to last, in fact I think it will never be broken,"" he added. At PSG, Blanc's men have a chance to bounce back with what appears to be a home banker against rock bottom Sochaux on Saturday while Monaco host equally struggling Ajaccio and Lille travel to in-form Bordeaux. Nantes have positioned themselves just one point behind fourth placed Marseille and the two teams meet in a Friday clash at the Velodrome, with Elie Baup's position as OM coach potentially on the line. League Cup holders Saint-Etienne, were beaten by Rennes in midweek, and await the buoyant Evian side after their best win of the season over PSG. Lorient and Rennes meet in Brittany, Reims and Nice will do battle in the Champagne-region and Valenciennes are at home to Guingamp on Saturday. Struggling 2012 champions Montpellier will have a caretaker coach for the trip to Toulouse in the remaining match after coach Jean Fernandez resigned on Thursday.

That goal came just seconds after Javier Pastore had missed a glorious chance to bring the defending champions level, and the result ends PSG's unbeaten record under Laurent Blanc. Indeed, the capital club's sequence of Ligue 1 matches without defeat ends at 26, one short of the club record set in their title-winning 1993-94 campaign. And their overall run without losing in all competitions ends at 36 matches, also one short of the club record. However, that sequence does not include a defeat to Evian on penalties in the quarter-finals of the French Cup last season, and now the club from the shadow of the Alps can claim to be PSG's bogey side. ""This win is marvellous for all our fans, the whole region. I have to congratulate my players,"" said Evian coach Pascal Dupraz, who nevertheless admitted his frustration that his side were unable to produce such performances on a regular basis. Blanc did not dwell long on the run coming to an end. ""We had our chances in the first-half and we can have regrets about the loss because we should have opened the scoring and that could have meant a different result,"" he said. Blanc's side are now just a single point clear of Lille at the top of the table, with the northern side having beaten Marseille 1-0 on Tuesday, with Nolan Roux scoring a stoppage-time winner as Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama kept his 11th consecutive clean sheet. Meanwhile, Monaco are just one point futher behind in third after they won 3-0 away to Nice in a Cote d'Azur derby on Tuesday, achieved without Radamel Falcao, as the Colombian missed a second successive game due to injury. James Rodriguez, Emmanuel Riviere and Lucas Ocampos got the goals for Claudio Ranieri's men, as Nice fell to a sixth straight defeat. Elsewhere on Wednesday, veteran goalkeeper Mickael Landreau broke the record for the most appearances by any player in France's top flight as he started for Bastia in their Corsican derby draw with Ajaccio. French international Landreau played his 603rd Ligue 1 game, three days after equalling the previous record held by former Monaco 'keeper Jean-Luc Ettori, in a game played on neutral ground on the mainland at the Stade Parsemain, home of second-tier club Istres. But Landreau, formerly of Nantes, PSG and Lille, was unable to help Bastia beat their island rivals as the game ended in a 1-1 draw, a late Eduardo strike for Ajaccio cancelling out Florian Raspentino's early opener. ""It is fabulous to experience this and to be able to share it,"" said Landreau after the match. ""The game was played behind closed doors, but I prepare for every match in the same manner. ""I can feel what this represents, and it is massive."" Saint-Etienne missed the chance to reclaim fifth spot as they went down 3-1 away to Rennes in Brittany, with Argentine striker Silvio Romero scoring his first two goals in French football for the hosts. Bordeaux inflicted a first home defeat on Guingamp since the opening day of the season, winning 1-0 thanks to a solitary Julien Faubert strike, while Lorient increased the pressure on beleagured Montpellier coach Jean Fernandez with a 2-0 victory at the Stade de la Mosson. Maxime Barthelme put Lorient ahead before Cameroon international forward Vincent Aboubakar scored his ninth goal of the season from the penalty spot at the death after the home side had been reduced to nine men by the dismissals of Vitorino Hilton and Abdelhamid El-Kaoutari. However, Montpellier's plight is not as serious as that of Sochaux, who remain rooted to the bottom seven points from safety after losing 2-0 at home to Reims."

PSG's last defeat of any sort came against Evian in Annecy in April, when they lost on penalties in the quarter-finals of the French Cup. Not including that, however, PSG are 36 games unbeaten in all competitions, one short of the overall club record. Their nearest challengers Lille beat Marseille 1-0 on Tuesday, with Nolan Roux scoring a stoppage-time winner as Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama kept his 11th consecutive clean sheet. Meanwhile, Monaco strengthened their grip on a top-three place thanks to their 3-0 victory away to Nice in a Cote d'Azur derby, achieved without Radamel Falcao, as the Colombian missed a second successive game due to injury.

1268,03/12/2013,23:02,Football: Roux late winner caps Enyeama's 'keeping masterclass,A goal two minutes into time added on by Nolan Roux gave Lille a priceless 1-0 win over Marseille in their Ligue 1 clash on Tuesday and consolidated their second spot in the table.,"Roux's sixth goal of the season was a bit harsh on a Marseille side that had several superb chances throughout the game but found Nigerian international goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama in imperious form. Lille's win moved them to wthin a point of leaders Paris Saint Germain, who play Evian on Wednesday, while Marseille are 10 points adrift of PSG and being threatened for fourth spot by Nantes, who grabbed a late winner in a 2-1 victory over struggling Valenciennes. Monaco stayed third and moved to within two points of PSG when they beat ailing Nice 3-0 later on Tuesday with Emmanuel Riviere ending a scoring drought dating back nine games as he grabbed the second goal to help his side to their third successive win. Enyeama moved past 1000 minutes in not conceding a goal -- since the 2-0 defeat by Nice on September 15 -- taking it to 1035 minutes. The 31-year-old goalkeeper -- who captained Nigeria to their Africa Cup of Nations triumph earlier this year -- is second on the all-time top flight list behind Frenchman Gaetan Huard who in the 1992-1993 season didn't concede a goal for Bordeaux for 1176 minutes. ""What can I say! I am just enjoying the moment,"" Enyeama told Bein Sport. ""It's not just me, though, it is the whole group. We stay strong like a team. We have the spirit and the strength. ""I don't know what is possible now. All I can say is that I havre a great team round me and a great set of coaches."" Going into the match there had been fears over how former Lille star Florian Thauvin would be received after a group of Lille supporters went to the airport and booed and hissed him when Marseille arrived for the match. Thauvin -- in form of late with five goals in the last 12 games and creating another three -- produced not much of note in the first-half, save one wonderful mazy run deep into Lille territory and although he was dispossessed the ball fell to Mathieu Valbuena who found Andre-Pierre Gignac. The former France striker shrugged off a defender and only had Enyeama to beat but the goalkeeper proved equal to the task blocking Gignac's shot and when the rebound fell to Valbuena his shot drifted wide. One double save in the second-half in particular stood out, Dimitri Payet's fierce strike being batted away by Enyeama but straight to Gignac out wide right in the area, but his curling effort was tipped away by the goalkeeper. Marseille's frustrating evening deepened when the ever lively Valbuena went down heavily on his left shoulder and had to be taken off immediately, leaving the pitch and trudging down the tunnel holding his left arm gingerly. The game seemed to be petering out into a deserved share of the points only for Roux to reward Enyeama's superb display as he headed into the far corner."

Lille meanwhile solidified second place and are just one point behind the capital outfit following Roux's injury time winner. ""Mathieu is suffering from a disjointed collarbone and won't be available for several weeks, maybe three or four,"" Baup announced at the post match press conference in northern France. The lively forward is now ruled out for the rest of the year after coming off in the 70th minute following a bad fall resulting from a collision with Lille's Danish defender Simon Kjaer. To add insult to injury for Marseille, Valbuena's fellow winger Dimitri Payet came off seven minutes later with a calf injury as Baup's attacking options took a severe blow on a chilly night at the Pierre-Mauroy stadium. Marseille are already missing Ghana striker Andre Ayew who is a long-term injury casualty following knee surgery last week which is expected to sideline him for up to two months."

1271,02/12/2013,02:30,Football: Victory a must as Marseille travel to Lille,French giants Marseille travel to high-flying Lille on Tuesday knowing that they must win if they harbour any hopes of challenging for the Ligue 1 title this season.,"Although that objective already appears beyond Elie Baup's men, they must at least take something from the game to remain in Champions League contention. Marseille won for the third time in a row on Friday with a 2-0 success over 2012 champions Montpellier, currently struggling at the wrong end of the table. That ensured they remained within sight of the top three but should they lose to Lille at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy, they could find themselves distanced to eight points off the top three by the end of the midweek fixtures. With Lille on a 10-game unbeaten streak and Monaco looking to have got over their November blip and back to winning ways these last two weeks, Marseille know they cannot afford to come away empty-handed from the north. And they will be looking to in-form forward Florian Thauvin to continue his recent goalscoring run against his former employers. Thauvin had a difficult start to life on the south coast after his protracted summer move from Lille, and he is not expecting to be welcomed back with open arms. ""The match at Lille will be like any other. I'll get a tough reception but I'm going there to win and take three points,"" said the 20-year-old, who has scored four goals in his last four league matches. ""I'm delighted to be doing good things for the team. It was my objective to repay the confidence the club has shown in me. I think I'm doing that well now,"" he added. Lille coach Rene Girard is hoping his side can continue the impregnable form they've been showing in remaining unbeaten, both in terms of results and goals conceded, for their last 10 matches. ""Ten matches in a row without conceding a goal, that's a first in my career,"" said Girard. ""That shows the character of this team, the lads are committed, we can play them out of position -- they make sacrifices, they turn up."" Lille have had one less day to recover, though, having played on Saturday. ""The Marseille game is coming quickly and it'll be tough,"" added Girard. ""We'll try to recover well, we don't have much of a choice. ""We're not going to complain, it would only use up more energy."" Monaco, meanwhile, travel to the Allianz Riviera on Tuesday to face local rivals Nice. Italian coach Claudio Ranieri has said he is quietly optimistic that record forward signing Radamel Falcao will be fit to return having missed the 2-0 success over Rennes. Having gone three matches without a win, which saw them drop to third having spent most of the early part of the season at the top of the table, Monaco have now won two in a row. France midfielder Jeremy Toulalan believes they can continue in that vein right up to Christmas. ""Now we have a match on Tuesday against Nice, a derby,"" he said. ""We need to win again, the aim is to win all our remaining matches up to Christmas. ""We've just gone through a tricky patch, I hope that was just that. ""I always said we'd have one, afterwards you have to react but the hardest thing is to be consistent."" Champions and leaders Paris Saint-Germain will be looking for revenge when they travel to Evian on Wednesday. The minnows, better known for their bottled water, were the last side to beat the Parisians, on penalties in a French Cup quarter-final back in April. Their last league defeat, 26 Ligue 1 matches ago, was to Reims at the beginning of March. Fixtures (1800 GMT unless stated)"

They remain four points clear of Lille and five ahead of Monaco at the top of the standings after easing past a Lyon side who once dominated the French scene themselves but who are currently languishing in mid-table. But while Lyon coach Remi Garde accepted that his team are ""not competing in the same league as Paris"", opposite number Laurent Blanc insisted the scoreline was not necessarily a fair reflection on the game. ""The size of the scoreline could make you think it was easy from beginning to end, but Lyon made life difficult for us early on,"" he said. ""If we keep playing at 100 percent, I think it will be very difficult to beat PSG. But we need to avoid complacency and be at our very best every game."" The build-up to the match was overshadowed by the news that both team buses were stoned on the way to the stadium, while Lyon lost Bafetimbi Gomis to injury in the warm-up. In his absence, OL played with a three-man central defence and for much of the first half they succeeded in frustrating the hosts. They were also helped by referee Antony Gautier's decision not to award a penalty when Cavani went down under a challenge from Bakary Kone 16 minutes in. Alexandre Lacazette had been left to plough a lone furrow up front for Lyon and he had the visitors' best opportunity of the first half, creating space for himself inside the box and lashing a shot against the bar. But PSG got their noses in front nine minutes before the interval when Cavani met a corner from the left and headed in through the legs of Yoann Gourcuff, who was standing on the near post. Five minutes later, the Uruguayan was brought down again inside the box. This time, Lyon goalkeeper Remy Vercoutre was the culprit, and a penalty was awarded. Ibrahimovic sent Vercoutre the wrong way as he coolly chipped into the net, and Lyon's chances of getting back into the game appeared to be over by the interval. They conceded again on the hour mark, though, Brazil skipper Silva converting the loose ball following a corner for his first ever goal in Ligue 1. And there was more pain to come for the visitors as Ibrahimovic beat Vercoutre from the spot once again after being fouled by Samuel Umtiti, taking his tally to 20 goals in his last 13 games for club and country. PSG are now unbeaten in 26 Ligue 1 matches and maintain a safe distance from Lille, who won 1-0 at northern neighbours Valenciennes on Saturday as Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama extended his remarkable run without conceding a goal to 945 minutes. Meanwhile, Monaco proved too strong for Rennes on Saturday despite being without the injured Radamel Falcao -- James Rodriguez and Anthony Martial scoring in a 2-0 triumph. Elsewhere on Sunday, Mickael Landreau equalled fellow goalkeeper Jean-Luc Ettori's record of 602 appearances in France's top flight as he kept a clean sheet for Bastia in a 2-0 win over Evian. The 34-year-old French international began his career at Nantes in 1996 and won the title with Les Canaris in 2001 before spells at Paris Saint-Germain and Lille, with whom he won the double in 2011. ""I have worked so hard to get to this point. I am enormously lucky,"" said Landreau after drawing level with Ettori, who spent his entire career at Monaco between 1975 and 1992 and picked up nine caps for France.

He has now drawn level with Ettori, who spent his entire career at Monaco between 1975 and 1992 and picked up nine caps for France, six of them at the 1982 World Cup where the side lost in the semi-finals against West Germany. Landreau, who has played 11 times for his country, remains part of the France set-up under Didier Deschamps and looks likely to appear at his second World Cup next year in Brazil following a role as a squad member in 2006 when Les Bleus lost in the final against Italy on penalties. On-loan Serbian winger Milos Krasic put the Coriscan side in front four minutes inside the second half before Tunisian international Wahbi Khazri sealed the result in stoppage time. Landreau, who was appointed captain for the match, helped Bastia move into the upper half of the table, while Evian remain fifth from bottom.

At the Chaban-Delmas stadium, Brazilian Jussie was the catalyst for Bordeaux, scoring the opening and closing goals while Gregory Sertic and Nicolas Maurice-Belay were also on target. ""It's very pleasing to score a double, as much as the victory,"" said the 30-year-old Jussie, who joined Bordeaux in 2007 from Lens after beginning his career at Brazilian club Cruzeiro. ""We've been in a bit of a black period, even if we weren't losing much, but this relieves the pressure a bit,"" added the striker, who took on French nationality in 2011 and was part of the championship winning team under current PSG coach Laurent Blanc in 2009. ""When everyone does their bit, it's a lot easier and the team worked hard in the second half.

1276,01/12/2013,04:41,Football: Foreign investors changing European football landscape,"Asian tycoons, Russian oligarchs, Arab sheikhs, American businessmen - 10 years after Roman Abramovich's takeover of Chelsea, European clubs remain targets for wealthy foreign investors, and rarely for their love of the shirt.","From Chelsea to the recent buyout of Italian giants Inter Milan by Indonesian media mogul Erick Thohir, a long list of clubs on the continent have changed hands over the last decade. The trend is most striking in England's Premier League, where the environment is more welcoming to potential investors, with many clubs listed on the stock exchange. In total, 11 of the 20 clubs in England's cash-rich top flight are in foreign hands. But investors have also turned their attentions to other European leagues, notably France, where clubs are not weighed down by massive debts as is often the case in Spain and Italy and are not protected in the same way as in Germany, where the law prevents any private investor from owning more than 49 percent of a club's shares. As a result, Paris Saint-Germain were bought out by Qatar Sports Investments in 2011 and Russian billionaire Dimitry Rybolovlev took control of Monaco in December of the same year before going on to dramatically revive the fortunes of the principality club. ""The influx of money has an immediate impact on the market. The first thing these new owners do is pay huge sums for the best players. That causes inflation and sometimes a sporting imbalance with clubs who can no longer keep up,"" says Didier Primault, co-director of the Centre for the Law and Economics of Sport (CDES) in Limoges, France. The CDES have produced a report for the European Union as part of their efforts to regulate the football transfer system. In their report, the CDES have noted that the greatest inflation occurred following Abramovich's arrival at Chelsea in 2003, after Manchester City were bought by the Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008 and last summer, when PSG and their Ligue 1 rivals Monaco fought with each other to break the French transfer record while Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona also splashed out. Fortunes have been used up to clear clubs' debts, with 200 million euros ($267m, £167m) of Thohir's initial investment in Inter going on reducing the Nerazzurri's arrears. But lavishing such sums on debt management and buying players is sometimes done without any regard for the economic logic of the state of the markets at that moment in time. The recent case of Monaco was a perfect example, with the principality club marking their promotion back to France's top tier by spending 167 million euros in the summer transfer window. Then there was the remarkable policy of another Russian billionaire, Suleiman Kerimov, who turned unfashionable Anzhi Makhachkala from the volatile region of Dagestan into a major player on the European stage by spending big to bring in a whole host of players in 2011, notably Cameroonian striker Samuel Eto'o, who was rumoured to be the world's highest-paid player when he signed from Inter. More recently, Malaysian Vincent Tan has steered Cardiff City into the English Premier League for the first time, but his methods - including changing the club's colours from blue to red and putting a family friend in charge of player recruitment - have not gone down well with supporters. ""There are different types of investors,"" says Frederic Bolotny, a consultant on the economics of sport. ""Some are looking for indirect benefits, as part of a political strategy, such as Qatar's ownership of PSG. Others are more irrational. ""Abramovich at Chelsea or Rybolovlev at Monaco are looking for respectability regardless of whether they can make money out of it. ""Not of all of these investors can be compared."" Indeed, cases in which foreign investors actively look to make money - such as the Glazers at Manchester United - are very rare. The gradual introduction of Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules by European football's governing body UEFA in a bid to stop clubs spending more money than they actually generate should - in theory - prevent more instances of such irrational spending as have become commonplace. ""I don't see how all this can go on once financial fair play is in full force,"" says Bolotny, who points a finger towards the ""golden contract, completely out of keeping with the market"" that PSG recently agreed with the official Qatar Tourism Authority and which will eventually net the French capital club 200 million euros. PSG will have to provide details of the agreement to UEFA before they consider the deal in relation to FFP. How UEFA go about curbing what seems to be a clear way of avoiding the FFP regulations remains to be seen, but if they do succeed in bringing the European game back to a healthier financial footing, will mega-rich foreign investors continue to show such an interest in the sport on the continent?"

""Our goals and objectives are to be the best racing operation in the world,"" Sheikh Joaan's media manager, Sherida al Kaabi, told a press conference at London's Dorchester hotel on Friday.

""Sheikh Joaan has ambitious plans for Al Shaqab Racing and the exciting thing for me is to have an opportunity to be involved at the highest level and be part of a team that is very serious about their aspirations,"" Herbert said. It has been a meteoric rise within 'the sport of kings' for Sheikh Joaan. The 28-year-old had not seen a thoroughbred racehorse win in his grey and maroon silks until August last year. But as well as Treve, this season saw Toronado triumph at Group One level with victory in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood, southern England, in July.

He has also tried to secure the future of his operation by spending a world record five million guineas (£5.05 million, $8.25 million, 6.07 million euros) at the Tattersalls yearling sales in Newmarket, eastern England, last month with a view to bolstering his breeding operation at his stud in Normandy, northern France, where he stands former racehorses Planteur and Style Vendome.

1279,26/11/2013,02:03,Football: Mitroglou the threat to unbeaten PSG,"After failing to get the job done in their last group game, Paris Saint-Germain will seek the draw required to qualify for the Champions League last 16 when they host a Kostas Mitroglou-inspired Olympiakos on Wednesday.","PSG come into their penultimate match in Group C three points clear of the Greek champions and six ahead of Benfica in third. They might already have progressed into the knockout stage had they not been held to a 1-1 draw at home by Anderlecht at the beginning of the month, but one more point at the Parc des Princes will mean they are certain to finish in first place. That should, in theory, mean an easier tie in the last 16 and will also allow coach Laurent Blanc to rest players for the final group game in Lisbon next month as the Ligue 1 title-holders try to maintain challenges on all fronts. PSG are top of Ligue 1 and unbeaten this season after a 3-0 victory on Saturday at Reims, the scene of their last defeat over 90 minutes way back in early March, 34 games ago. That set them up nicely for a busy run of fixtures prior to the winter break, and now they are looking forward to a rematch with Olympiakos, whom they beat 4-1 in Piraeus in September. ""It was the best way to prepare for the match against Olympiakos and a good start to a series of nine games before Christmas,"" said France midfielder Blaise Matuidi. ""It was another step forward for us and we are only focusing on ourselves. ""If we can keep playing with the same commitment and concentration it will be difficult for any team to beat us."" Of their unbeaten sequence, Blanc added: ""Some people look at us and hope we'll trip up, which of course has to happen sooner or later. But we're making sure that our unbeaten run continues as long as possible. As a coach you have to appreciate periods like this one."" Olympiakos are potentially dangerous opponents for PSG though. They have recovered from that defeat in the reverse fixture to beat Anderlecht 3-0 in Brussels and then take four points from a possible six against Benfica. As a result, they are favourites to go through with PSG. Under Spanish coach Michel, they have dropped just two points in the Greek Super League this season, conceding a miserly four goals in 12 games. Greece's richest and most successful club have several players who are familiar with PSG having previously been based in France, but the man to look out for is 25-year-old Mitroglou. The bearded striker's statistics make for impressive reading. Scorer of three goals in Greece's recent World Cup play-off tie against Romania, he struck a hat-trick against Anderlecht last month and has 14 goals in 10 domestic league games. He returns to the squad here to provide the firepower for the visitors in the French capital after being rested for the 4-1 victory at Panthrakikos on Saturday. However, PSG have no shortage of quality in attack - Zlatan Ibrahimovic has netted 17 times in his last 11 games for club and country and Edinson Cavani will return after being rested at the weekend. Dimitris Siovas and Jose Holebas also return for the visitors, who have won in France in each of the last two seasons, beating Marseille in November 2011 and Montpellier in October last year, but Michel will know that this PSG side are a different proposition altogether. Olympiakos need to win to maintain a chance of topping the group but could also qualify on Wednesday if the result in the night's other game in Brussels goes in their favour."
1280,26/11/2013,02:00,Football: Real and United home in on last 16,Former winners Real Madrid and Manchester United are amongst the teams that could wrap up qualification to the Champions League knock-out stages on Wednesday.,"Big-spending French champions Paris Saint-Germain, Olympiakos and Bayer Leverkusen can also qualify. GROUP A Bayer Leverkusen (GER) Manchester United (ENG) Both sides at the BayArena would secure qualification to the knock-out stages with a victory. Manchester United know that a win will almost be enough to secure top spot, unless they lose at home to Shakhtar Donetsk in their final group game. A draw would suffice for both teams as long as Shakhtar lose at home to Real Sociedad in the group's other match. Leverkusen have been hit by the loss of Germany midfielder Sidney Sam while United also have several players on the treatment table, notably Michael Carrick. The Germans, though, have been in good form in the league and are up to second behind Bayern Munich following their 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin while United were stunned by an injury-time equaliser at Cardiff on Sunday. The pressure is on Leverkusen, though, as their final match is away to Sociedad while United know they still have a home game at Old Trafford to come if they fail to secure qualification in Germany. Shakhtar Dontesk (UKR) v Real Sociedad (ESP) This is a must-win game for Sociedad if they harbour any hopes of prolonging their involvement in European football this season. While continuing their adventure in the Champions League will depend on them winning and Manchester United beating Leverkusen, and then Real beating the Germans in their final game with Shakhtar not stunning United at Old Trafford, a consolation spot in the Europa League is not so far-fetched. That, however, would still depend on beating the Ukrainians as anything else would see them finishing bottom of the group. Shakhtar's final match being away to group favourites United, they too will be feeling a win is necessary to keep their progression hopes alive, which could make for an open and entertaining match in Donetsk. Group B Juventus (ITA) v FC Copenhagen (DEN) Antonio Conte's Serie A team come into this match under pressure for their Champions League future. Bottom of the group and the only team yet to win a match, they must win this fixture to keep their destiny in their own hands. But even so, with a clash away to Galatasaray in their final group game, they know they cannot afford to lose either of their last two fixtures or face certain elimination. Only two wins will guarantee them a last 16 spot, although with both their opponents also having to play Real Madrid, Juve will feel quietly confident that a win and a draw will likely prove sufficient. Real Madrid (ESP) Galatasaray (TUR) A point would be enough to send Real into the knock-out stages and would also tie up top spot, barring an unlikely five-goal defeat at FC Copenhagen on the final matchday and assuming the Danes also win away to Juventus on Wednesday. Madrid will probably be without star forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who picked up a hamstring problem in the 5-0 win at Almeria on Saturday. The loss of a player who has scored 14 goals in his last seven matches for club and cuntry would seem a blow but such has been Real's domination of the group so far, and given they crushed Galatasaray 5-0 in Istanbul earlier in the campaign, they will be confident of doing enough to secure their passage through. Group C Paris Saint-Germain (FRA) v Olympiakos (GRE) Paris Saint-Germain will qualify for the last-16 knockout phase with a draw at home to the Greek champions at the Parc des Princes, while Olympiakos will also go through with a point should Anderlecht defeat Benfica in Brussels. Laurent Blanc has guided his Ligue 1 leaders on an unbeaten run in all competitions since taking over from current Real Madrid handler Carlo Ancelotti while the capital outfit have not lost in the league since last March when they went down 1-0 at Reims. Captain Zlatan Ibrahimovic has scored 17 goals in his last 11 matches for club and country, including the third in the 3-0 win over Reims on Saturday which kept the team four points clear at the top in France. Olympiakos coach Miguel Torres has also built an impressive unbeaten league run of 29 matches without loss since taking over in February as they lead the Greek league and have not lost a domestic match away from home in 28 fixtures, one short of their own national record. Anderlecht (BEL) v Benfica (POR) The Belgian leaders are much in need of their first victory of the group stage and will take heart from their gutsy 1-1 draw at PSG on matchday four. They lost 2-0 in Lisbon, the first time the teams met, but with the Portuguese picking up just one point from two fixtures against Olympiakos, Benfica will be looking for maximum points to stay in touch with the top two spots and also solidify their chances of guaranteeing at least third and a spot in the next round of the Europa League. The teams met in the 1983 UEFA Cup final which was won by the Brussels' club, an occasion that saw current Benfica assistant coach Minervino Pietra turn out for the Lisbon side. Anderlecht are trying to reach the second round for the first time since 2000-01 while Benfica finished third in their pool last season before going on to reach the Europa League final where they were beaten 2-1 by Chelsea in Amsterdam. Group D CSKA Moscow (RUS) v Bayern Munich (GER) The defending champions are Europe's in-form side and chasing what would be a record tenth consecutive Champions League victory when they visit a CSKA Moscow outfit who can only finish third at best. The Bundesliga front-runners are coming off a 3-0 thrashing off Borussia Dortmund at the weekend, the team they defeated in last year's final. That win on the road extended their German league record to 38 matches unbeaten, although they will be wary of dropping points and potentially top spot in the group to Manchester City. Bayern have won three of their eight trips to Russian clubs in European action but have only lost once back in 2008 when they were sent packing at the semi-final stage of the UEFA Cup, well beaten on the night 4-0 by Zenit Saint-Petersburg. The German club have been rocked by a suspected mole at the Allianz Arena who has been revealing tactics ahead of matches to the German press much to the fury of coach Pep Guardiola. Manchester City (ENG) v Viktoria Plzen (CZE) The 2012 English champions have qualified for the knockout phase for the first time following back-to-back wins over CSKA but need to keep the pressure on Bayern at the top who are three points clear heading into the penultimate matches. Manuel Pellegrini looked on as his side humiliated Tottenham 6-0 in Premier League action on Sunday and maximum points at home will set up a last day finale in Munich. The Czech Republic side make their first trip to England, but looking for their first points and a bid to keep alive their Europa League prospects flickering, looks a daunting challenge on paper at a City team who have lost just once at home in their last 22 European ties. Coming into this season's group stage, Plzen were riding a seven match unbeaten run on their travels but are now trying to break a four match European losing streak, their worst in club history."

The visitors however let their football do the talking with Mevlüt Erding scoring his first goal for Saint-Etienne after 23 minutes, lifting his side to sixth. It was a fourth straight defeat for Nice, who were hit by a string of injuries, with an error from third goalkeeper Luca Veronese, 22, accounting for the goal. On Saturday, PSG kept their unbeaten start to the season intact with a dominant 3-0 win at Reims. Lucas Moura and Jeremy Menez shared goals either side of half-time and Zlatan Ibrahimovic added a late insurance marker as Laurent Blanc's men rumbled to their 10th victory in 14 outings. Lyon were held 1-1 at home by relegation threatened Valenciennes, while Lorient picked up a rare away win by thrashing French Cup finalists Evian 4-0. The three other Saturday matches between Montpellier and Guingamp, Rennes at home to Bordeaux and Sochaux entertaining Bastia all finished 1-1. On Friday, Marseille moved up to fourth spot with their second straight win at Ajaccio, a 3-1 triumph in Corsica."

It was a fourth straight defeat for Nice, who were hit by a string of injuries, with an error from third goalkeeper Luca Veronese, 22, accounting for the goal. On Saturday, PSG kept their unbeaten start to the season intact with a dominant 3-0 win at Reims. Lucas Moura and Jeremy Menez shared goals either side of half-time and Zlatan Ibrahimovic added a late insurance marker as Laurent Blanc's men rumbled to their 10th victory in 14 outings. Lyon were held 1-1 at home by relegation threatened Valenciennes, while Lorient picked up a rare away win by thrashing French Cup finalists Evian 4-0. The three other Saturday matches between Montpellier and Guingamp, Rennes at home to Bordeaux and Sochaux entertaining Bastia all finished 1-1. On Friday, Marseille moved up to fourth spot with their second straight win at Ajaccio, a 3-1 triumph in Corsica."

Baup, who has seen his struggling outfit eliminated from Champions League action with two games to play in the group phase, received a welcome tonic following the international break as the Velodrome giants moved one point above Nantes. It was a tetchy encounter that featured five yellow cards, but only one against the 1993 European champions. ""There were some very interesting things, 17 shots, goals. We tried to keep the ball moving quickly and using width to go forward,"" said Baup. ""It was good to score three goals away from home against an Ajaccio team who really dug in,"" he continued. ""We saw our players (France) qualify for the World Cup and it has given everyone a boost of enthusiasm. We had a very bad run of results and now we're on a bit of a good run again, and there's still five matches until the winter break. ""We need to try and take maximum points,"" concluded Baup.

1286,22/11/2013,02:05,Football: PSG put record to test as French ride crest of wave,"After a week in which the national team's qualification for the World Cup provided a huge boost to French football, Paris Saint-Germain will bid to extend their long unbeaten run as Ligue 1 returns.","The capital club, who come into the weekend four points clear of Lille at the top of the table, travel to Champagne country to face Reims on Saturday afternoon. They have a score to settle with Hubert Fournier's side after losing 1-0 at the Stade Auguste-Delaune last season, although remarkably they have not lost in the league since that match on March 2, a run of 24 games. Indeed, the capital club have not lost any of their 18 matches in all competitions this season, but Saturday's opponents are in formidable form themselves. Reims have lost just once in 13 matches, a run that has seen them beat Lille, Lyon and Marseille, and draw with Monaco, while they also knocked the principality club out of the League Cup. They come into the weekend in sixth position and Fournier is hoping his side can spring another surprise. ""We need to make sure we have no regrets at the end of the game,"" he said. ""If a little window opens, we need to enter it. We must believe we can cause an upset."" Their chances of doing so may be helped by the fact PSG's preparations have been hindered by the late return from international duty of numerous players. Record signing Edinson Cavani was not due to return to France until Friday morning after helping Uruguay qualify for the World Cup in a play-off against Jordan and coach Laurent Blanc admitted that he is likely to be rested. While some members of his squad -- including Blaise Matuidi, who helped France beat Ukraine in remarkable fashion in their decisive World Cup play-off -- will be on a high, others had a less enjoyable experience playing for their countries. That was the case for Zlatan Ibrahimovic, whose Sweden side missed out on a place in Brazil after losing to Portugal. ""I would have been happier had Zlatan qualified for the World Cup with Sweden, (but) now we need to try to fulfil our objectives at club level, and I know that Zlatan's personal aims are high. That will help ease his disappointment,"" Blanc said. ""You can expect changes to the team,"" he added. ""(But) those who have stayed here during the international break do not necessarily have a greater chance of playing the next game."" Conditions are likely to be tricky, with temperatures in France having plummeted in recent days, and Blanc is not taking anything for granted. ""They will be especially motivated and we expect a difficult game. We have not been able to prepare in the best possible manner. ""I am afraid of them, just as I am afraid of any team. Another thing that concerns me at the moment is the weather because pitches are not going to be in great condition. Our philosophy is based on playing football, and to do that we need a good pitch."" Elsewhere, second-placed Lille entertain Toulouse on Sunday looking to extend a run of eight games without losing or even conceding a goal, while Nantes, in fourth, face third-placed Monaco. Two of France's most famous clubs, both were promoted back to Ligue 1 in the summer, but while big-spending Monaco were expected to compete near the top of the table, Nantes have surprised observers with their impressive form. Les Canaris have lost just once in seven outings and a win will see them leapfrog Monaco on goal difference, with Claudio Ranieri's men having won just one of their last four.

1288,05/11/2013,23:31,Football: PSG made to wait by obstinate Anderlecht,Paris Saint-Germain will have to wait to seal their place in the last 16 of the Champions League after being held to a 1-1 draw by Anderlecht on Tuesday.,"On a frustrating night at the Parc des Princes, PSG had most of the possession and no shortage of chances, but they fell behind to a Demy De Zeeuw goal midway through the second half and needed a Zlatan Ibrahimovic strike moments later just to earn them a point against a visiting side that had Sacha Kljestan sent off late on. The nature of this encounter in the French capital contrasted starkly with the sides' encounter in Brussels two weeks ago, when PSG recorded their biggest ever away victory in continental competition, trouncing Anderlecht 5-0. Laurent Blanc's men might have clinched top spot in the section with two games to spare in the event of a win, but instead they will need a draw at home to Olympiakos later this month to be sure of their last-16 berth. ""We were too average to win the game,"" said Blanc. ""I sincerely feel that, had we not equalised within five minutes of their goal, we might well have lost."" Anderlecht, meanwhile, will be pleased to have recovered some pride and registered their first point of the campaign. ""It was a very nice surprise,"" visiting coach John Van den Brom said of the outcome. ""I am very proud of my players after some of the criticism they have received recently, especially after the poor result against PSG last time."" Blanc was without Edinson Cavani due to a thigh injury, but he was able to welcome back Ibrahimovic after a nagging knee problem forced him to miss last Friday's 4-0 demolition of Lorient in Ligue 1. The Belgian champions had hinted that they would settle for any kind of improvement on the thrashing they suffered in the last meeting of the clubs, and they predictably adopted a cautious approach in an attempt to frustrate their hosts this time. It worked in the first half, with PSG unable to break down a defence comprising six men when the home side had possession, and early efforts from Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ibrahimovic that both missed the target were as close as they came in the opening period. Having initially been prepared to utilise Dennis Praet, their most likely creative spark, as an auxiliary right-back, Anderlecht slowly grew into the contest and their teenage Serbian striker Aleksandar Mitrovic flashed a shot just over Salvatore Sirigu's goal. PSG fans that have become used to seeing much better from their team greeted the half-time whistle with jeers, but there was worse to come after the restart. Ibrahimovic headed just wide from a Thiago Motta corner before teeing up Lucas to volley wastefully off target from an excellent position, and instead it was the visitors who drew first blood in the 68th minute to the disbelief of the entire stadium. Praet found Kljestan on the edge of the box to the left, and the American midfielder cut the ball back for Dutchman De Zeeuw, who beat Sirigu with a low first-time effort to finally break his team's goalscoring duck in this season's competition. PSG, though, needed just two minutes to draw level, Blaise Matuidi finding Ibrahimovic, and the Swede poking the ball over the line after his initial effort had hit the post to make it five goals in two games against Anderlecht. Blanc's side poured forward in search of the goal that would have won them the game and taken them through to the last 16, but they couldn't find it, even after the energetic Kljestan had been sent off for a second yellow card for handling nine minutes from the end."

Leverkusen's fit-again Lars Bender, who signed a contract extension in midweek, received a late red card for his second bookable offence while Stefan Kiessling, Sidney Sam and Heung-Min Son were all on the bench at the start. The Germans won the first tie between the two sides last month, a comprehensive 4-0 home win which put them on six points, one behind Manchester United. Shakhtar, who were quarter-finalists in 2011, have not beaten a German side at home in Europe since seeing off Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1980/81 UEFA Cup. Real Sociedad (ESP) v Man Utd (ENG) United can virtually ensure their last 16 place with victory in Spain after a 1-0 home win over Sociedad, playing in the tournament for the first time in 10 years, in Manchester moved them onto seven points from three games. But David Moyes's side have doubts over the fitness of Jonny Evans, Rafael da Silva and Tom Cleverley, who were all replaced at half-time in Saturday's 3-1 win at Fulham. ""It will be a difficult test against (Real) Sociedad,"" said Moyes. ""To go and play against any side in Spain who have qualified will be a hard test, but we will go over there and try and get a good result that will continue our good form in the group."" Sociedad have scored just once in three Champions League games so far and are without a point but warnmed up for Tuesday with a confidence-boosting 5-0 home win over Osasuna. Jagoba Arrasate's side are looking to avoid setting a club-record sequence of four straight defeats in Europe. Group B Juventus (ITA) v Real Madrid (ESP) Real Madrid have nine points from three games after a Cristiano Ronaldo double ensured a 2-1 win over Juventus last time out and they need just a point in Turin to make sure of a last-16 place. Nine-time winners Madrid have scored in all their last 19 Champions League away fixtures, losing only four but Juventus have won the last five meetings between the sides in Turin. Juventus are in third place and with that position in mind coach Antonio Conte rested Andrea Pirlo in Saturday's 1-0 win at Parma before the veteran midfielder replaced Claudio Marchisio. Ronaldo has scored seven times for Real Madrid in the Champions League this season just one off the record held jointly by Ruud van Nistelrooy, Filippo Inzaghi and Hernan Crespo. On Saturday, Real beat Rayo Vallecano 3-2 with a Ronaldo double and a Karim Benzema header as Gareth Bale laid on two goals for the second consecutive game. Real will be without left-back Fabio Coentrao after he limped off with an ankle injury. Xabi Alonso is also a doubt but Raphael Varane will return at the heart of the defence after being rested against Rayo. Copenhagen (DEN) v Galatasaray (TUR) Galatasaray won the first match 3-1 in Istanbul to put themselves in second spot in the table, five points behind Real but two ahead of Juve and three up on Copenhagen. The Danes drew 1-1 with Juve and lost 4-0 at Real Madrid while Galatasaray recovered from their opening 6-1 drubbing to the Spaniards to draw 2-2 with Juventus in Roberto Mancini's first game as coach. Copenhagen's home record in the tournament gives some cause for optimism -- in eight matches, they have lost only to Chelsea and have beaten Manchester United and drawn with Barcelona in previous years. For Galatasaray, Copenhagen holds special memories -- in 2000, a Fatih Terim-led team overcame Arsenal on penalties in the UEFA Cup final. Group C Paris Saint Germain (FRA) v Anderlecht (BEL) The French side can qualify for the knockout stages for the second successive year with victory over an Anderlecht team they walloped 5-0 in their previous encounter a fortnight ago to make it three impressive wins from three games in an admittedly easy group. The only good news for Anderlecht is that there are doubts over whether Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who scored four in the first match, will be fit as he was rested for the 4-0 Ligue 1 win over Lorient last Friday -- extending PSG's unbeaten Ligue 1 run to 23 -- with an inflamed knee. Anderlecht are searching for their first point and first goal of the campaign while their last away win in the Champions League came in the 2005/06 season at Real Betis. Olympiakos (GRE) v Benfica (POR) A lot at stake in this match as with both on four points, and Anderlecht on zero, they are battling for the runners up spot and a place in the last 16 or the third-place finish that guarantees a spot in the Europa League knockout stage, a competition in which the Portuguese outfit reached the final last season only to lose to Chelsea. The sides drew 1-1 in Lisbon, and Olympiakos will be looking to repeat their 5-1 win the last time they hosted Benfica in the Champions League in the 2008/09 campaign. Three Benfica players remain from that thumping including striker Oscar Cardozo, who was only on the bench that night but will be hoping to lead the line on Tuesday. Similarly Kostas Mitroglou should be up front for the hosts and eager to add to his tally of goals, having earlier this term become the first Greek player to score a hat-trick in the Champions League, admittedly against the porous Anderlecht defence. Group D Manchester City (ENG) v CSKA Moscow (RUS) City made heavy weather of beating the Russian outfit a fortnight ago in a match overshadowed by a racism controversy but look in sharper form after a 7-0 demolition of Norwich on Saturday, their biggest win in the top flight since 1968. Victory over the Russians would all but assure them of reaching the knockout stages for the first time after two flops under Roberto Mancini. The Italian's successor, Chilean Manuel Pellegrini showed his ruthless side when he dropped Joe Hart from the Norwich game and Romanian Costel Pantilimon may well keep his place for the CSKA game. City's talismanic central defender and captain Vincent Kompany is still struggling with a thigh injury and missed the Norwich game. CSKA come into the game on the back of a come from behind 2-1 win over Volga with impressive Ivorian striker Seydou Dumbia on the scoresheet. Viktoria Pilsen (CZE) v Bayern Munich (GER) The Germans are proving as unbeatable as PSG are, their 2-1 win over Hoffenheim on Saturday equalling the Bundesliga record for the longest unbeaten run, levelling the 36 matches unbeaten Hamburg achieved between January 1982 and January 1983. Victory on Tuesday, and CSKA failing to win at City, will see the holders qualify for the last 16. However, not all is rosy in the Munich camp as they are still struggling to impose themselves early in their matches. ""Obviously it's not such a wonderful situation,"" said Mario Goetze, who caused Pilsen all sorts of problems once he came on in the second-half of their match a fortnight ago, which ended in an easy 5-0 win for the German side. Pilsen have an impressive home record in the competition winning 10 out of 11 before City beat them this season. Bayern, though, are closing in on their record of successive away wins in the competition, six on their way to winning the 1996 title, as victory on Tuesday would be their fifth in a row."

With a lack of concentration in the Rennes defence Ayew struck right-footed from near the penalty spot for the Ghana striker's first goal in 10 months of Ligue 1 action. In the 73rd minute Rennes were awarded a penalty after Kassim Abdallah fouled Foued Kadir. Oliveira stepped up to take the spot kick but his effort was denied by Marseille keeper Mandanda, much to the delight of the travelling fans. This stalemate, after three losses in the league and two in the Champions league, lifted Marseille up to fifth, on 18 points. Rennes are one point behind in eighth. Marseille manager Elie Baup suggested the draw signified that his team had ""character"". But he warned: ""There's still lots of work to do...but this will do us good.""

""Now we've stopped the bleeding, we've got to continue with the cure."" Later, Lyon ended their five-match winless run with a 2-0 home victory over Guingamp, Reims ran out 4-2 winners over Bastia, Valenciennes came away from their trip to Ajaccio as 3-1 victors, Evian/Thonon saw off Toulouse 2-1 and Sochaux and Saint Etienne ended 0-0. The Ligue 1 summit is occupied by defending champions Paris Saint Germain, who moved three points clear of Monaco with a 4-0 rout of Lorient on Friday. The result at a rain-drenched Parc des Princes extended PSG's unbeaten league run to 23 games. The goals came from Lucas, Jeremy Menez and an Edinson Cavani double. ""We scored goals, created lots of chances and kept the ball despite the difficult weather conditions,"" said manager Laurent Blanc. ""Our philosophy for the game is the same whatever team we put out. There are players who have little playing time but they always demonstrate their qualities."" Monaco have the chance to draw level with PSG on Sunday with a win at Lille. Later Saturday, Ajaccio sacked Fabrizio Ravanelli as coach after the 3-1 home defeat to Valenciennes left them second from bottom of the table. ""We have decided to call a halt to our collaboration with Fabrizio Ravanelli,"" said Ajaccio president Alain Orsoni. ""It wasn't an easy decision."" Ravanelli is the third Ligue 1 coach to be sacked this season after Eric Hely at Sochaux and Daniel Sanchez at Valenciennes."

The performance was a perfect riposte to Blanc's eve-of-match warning about the danger of complacency seeping into his swashbuckling team and their laboured 2-2 draw with Saint Etienne last time out. The former France boss needn't have worried as this Friday night run out against struggling Lorient left PSG only six games shy of the club record of 37 games without losing. ""This is a very good result. The satisfaction is at all levels, individually and collectively,"" said Blanc. ""We scored goals, created lots of chances and kept the ball despite the difficult weather conditions. ""Our philosophy for the game is the same whatever team we put out. There are players who have little playing time but they always demonstrate their qualities."" Blanc retained his preferred 4-3-3 system with Cavani filling in the role of Swedish star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, missing with an injured knee. PSG raced into a three minute lead when Brazil midfielder Lucas, unattended by the far post, volleyed the ball past Lorient keeper Fabien Audard in a move begun by Lucas Digne. Menez doubled their advantage five minutes before the interval, outfoxing Baptiste Reynet, who had come on to replace the injured Audard between the Lorient posts. The Ligue 1 champions were running riot in the rain and Cavani's header made it three after stoic work by Lucas to tighten their grip on the game before they headed off to the dressing rooms. Lorient never looked capable of fighting their way back and the final word fittingly went to PSG when Cavani fired in a rebound after a late corner taken by Menez to cap a good night's work in the French capital. That was the Uruguayan's ninth of the season and he now heads the Ligue 1 scoring charts. While Lorient were left hovering just three points above the relegation zone for PSG this win will act as an ideal springboard to next week's Champions League date with Anderlecht. Monaco, who had sat second on goal difference before Friday's action in the French capital, can reduce the gap when they face third-placed Lille on Sunday."

Lorient never looked capable of fighting their way back and the final word fittingly went to PSG when Cavani fired in a rebound after a late corner taken by Menez to cap a good night's work in the French capital. That was the Uruguayan's ninth of the season and he now heads the Ligue 1 scoring charts. While Lorient were left hovering just three points above the relegation zone for PSG this win will act as an ideal springboard to next week's Champions League date with Anderlecht. Monaco, who had sat second on goal difference before Friday's action in the French capital, can reduce the gap when they face third-placed Lille on Sunday."
1296,31/10/2013,19:42,Football strike on as France says won't drop 75% tax,French football clubs said Thursday they will push ahead with a historic strike after President Francois Hollande rejected their demands to be exempt from a 75 percent tax on high-earners.,"The strike -- planned for the last weekend of November and including clubs from France's Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 first and second divisions -- will be the first for French football since 1972. Club chiefs met with Hollande on Thursday in a desperate bid to push for their exemption, but left empty-handed. The tax on incomes over one million euros ($1.4 million) must apply to ""all companies concerned"", Hollande was quoted in a statement as telling the clubs. ""The need to rebalance public accounts fully justifies this effort asked of companies that have made the choice of paying annual salaries at such a level,"" Hollande said. He also invited clubs to work with the government on developing a ""durable and balanced economic model"" for the industry. Football chiefs said they now had no choice but to push ahead with the strike. ""The president listened attentively but absolutely did not hear us,"" said Frederic Thiriez, the head of the French Football League. ""No solution was found tonight, so the mobilisation is going ahead,"" he said. The tax, one of the Socialist leader's main electoral promises, is part of next year's budget but has not yet been approved by parliament. The proposed levy is temporary and will affect income earned this year and in 2014. It is aimed at helping the eurozone's second-largest economy reduce a huge budget deficit. Hollande's initial proposal to tax the rich on individual incomes over one million euros was shot down as unconstitutional by the country's top court. But the government came back with a modified proposal that now makes companies liable to pay the 75 percent tax rate for the portion of employees' salaries above the million-euro ceiling. Football clubs complain that the move will hit them especially hard because they sign players on short-term contracts. They say the tax will make it impossible to attract top-flight talent. In protest at the tax, clubs in Ligue 1 and 2 have said they will not take part in fixtures from November 29 to December 2 in what has been described as a ""historic protest"". Football clubs argue that the measure will cost Ligue 1 about 44 million euros, given the high salaries earned by about 120 players from 14 clubs. Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain, France's richest club, counts more than 10 players whose pay exceeds the one-million bracket, including Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Although the tax proposal has been criticised by the opposition, there has been overwhelming agreement across the political spectrum that high-earning footballers should not be let off the hook. ""I don't weep for them,"" said Dominique Bussereau, a former minister from ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy's centre-right UMP party. ""I have no particular sympathy for professional football."" Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, added: ""It's indecent to see football clubs who are paying goalkeepers 120,000 euros per month come and complain, while millions of French have fallen victim to austerity."""
1297,31/10/2013,14:17,French football chiefs to meet Hollande over supertax,Chiefs of French football clubs are to meet President Francois Hollande Thursday in a bid to avoid a 75 percent super tax on millionaires after announcing a strike over the measure.,"The tax, one of the Socialist leader's main electoral planks, is part of next year's budget but it has not yet been approved by parliament. The proposed levy is temporary and will affect income earned this year and in 2014. It is aimed at helping the eurozone's second economy slash a huge budget deficit. But Budget Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said before the 1530 GMT meeting between the directors of the Ligue 1 and 2 football clubs and Hollande that the government would not cave into pressure. ""All the companies that are affected by this tax have to pay, that's the principle,"" he said on BFMTV. ""They will be reminded of this principle this afternoon.""

The last football strike in France took place in 1972. Jean-Pierre Louvel, the head of the UCPF, or Union of Professional Clubs, which is leading the rebellion, said he hoped for some leeway from Hollande. Lovel said he aimed to explore ""the possibilities of adapting the tax for football, as football companies are different from others,"" as they sign up players on short-term contracts. Football clubs argue that the measure will cost the Ligue 1 about 44 million euros, given the high salaries earned by about 120 players from 14 clubs.

This weekend, Monaco travel to face Lille in Ligue 1 in a meeting of the two sides immediately behind Paris Saint-Germain at the top of the table. Lille have not lost or conceded a goal in their last six league games, although they were also knocked out of the League Cup this midweek, losing 1-0 at home after extra-time to second-tier Auxerre on Tuesday.

1300,27/10/2013,23:36,"Football: PSG stay unbeaten, top after controversial draw",Paris Saint-Germain were 60 seconds from their first defeat of the season on Sunday before a desperate equaliser from Blaise Matuidi salvaged a 2-2 draw at Saint-Etienne and kept them top of Ligue 1.,"In a match full of drama and controversy, Saint-Etienne threw away a 2-0 second half lead albeit hindered by a red card which allowed Laurent Blanc's men back in the match. The point allowed PSG to cling to top spot as they lead Monaco on goal difference after Claudio Ranieri's side defeated Lyon 2-1 earlier in the day. ""It was a difficult evening for Paris and an intense match but I enjoyed myself regardless,"" said Blanc. ""PSG have to understand that we are going to come up against very good, organised teams and we were in a great stadium tonight. ""We gave them two goals which were terrible defensive mistakes and we were punished. ""I thought we were average and Saint-Etienne fully deserved at least a point."" added the former France and Bordeaux handler. Midfielder Benjamin Corgnet opened the scoring after just 18 minutes when he took advantage of a missed clearance from Brazilian centre-back Marquinhos to crash the ball past a static Salvatore Sirigu in the PSG goal. The visitors failed to convert their possession dominance as they chased an equaliser and fell further behind in comical circumstances six minutes after the break. Sirigu came out of his goal to collect a cross but tangled with his own defender Alex which allowed Romain Hamouma to clip the ball into an empty goal. It was the first time since last March that PSG had conceded two goals in a league match -- ironically against the same opposition. But the turning point occurred on 59 minutes when Fabien Lemoine tangled with Ezequiel Lavezzi who elbowed him in the face leaving him covered in blood. Referee Ruddy Buquet saw the incident differently and sent off the furious Frenchman who may have been dismissed for dissent in the heat of the moment. The red card swung the momentum in favour of Blanc's men and when Edinson Cavani stabbed the ball home from close range after a good pass from Brazilian defender Maxwell, the comeback was half completed. However stubborn defending from Saint-Etienne and some rousing support almost inspired Christophe Galtier's League Cup holders to victory. But with seconds remaining a looping ball into the penalty area from Matuidi eluded Saint-Etienne 'keeper Stephane Ruffier and bounced into the net. Earlier at the Louis II stadium, Ligue 1's top scorer Radamel Falcao found the target for the first time in four matches as he helped Monaco defeat Lyon 2-1. The former Atletico Madrid striker chipped Lyon 'keeper Anthony Lopes in the 36th minute following Mounir Obbadi's 28th minute opener as Claudio Ranieri's men extended their unbeaten run to seven wins and four draws in 11 outings. French striker Bafetimbi Gomis gave the visitors hope with 28 minutes left when he powered home a close-range header but it wasn't enough as Lyon suffered their fifth defeat. ""It was important for Falcao to score and when he scores Monaco usually win and we have to win all our matches if we want to stay at the top,"" explained Monaco's Portuguese defender Ricardo Carvalho. Lille slip to third, two points back behind PSG and Monaco following their disciplined 1-0 win at Nantes on Friday. Earlier on Sunday, Bordeaux rode two late goals from Mali international Cheikh Diabate and Polish winger Ludovic Obraniak to defeat Montpellier 2-0 in a battle of former champions at the Chaban Delmas stadium."

There will be a first lockdown in the professional game since 1972, scheduled for the last weekend of November, after a unanimous vote against Socialist President Francois Hollande's controversial supertax initiative. According to Ligue 1 teams, the new law, if implemented next year, would leave them with a 44 million euro tax bill and keep foreign talent away. On the pitch, Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic hit a majestic four goals during PSG's 5-0 humiliation of Belgian side Anderlecht in midweek. The 32-year-old has now scored 10 goals in his last five matches as Laurent Blanc's side continue their near perfect start to the season. His form has hit new heights as the capital club stand on the brink of the Champions League knockout phase, and have a two-point lead to protect heading into Sunday's away fixture at Saint-Etienne. ""He is in excellent form and scoring lots of goals,"" said PSG coach Laurent Blanc. ""But what I really appreciate is he is more and more involved in the play and he is very difficult to mark. ""I had the chance to play with some great players and he is a great player. He is like a locomotive for the others and pulls everyone to greater heights."" Monaco are the only other unbeaten side in the league but coach Claudio Ranieri must rally the troops for Sunday's home match against Lyon after being held 2-2 by lowly Sochaux in their last outing. Questions have cropped up over Monaco's title credentials despite six wins in ten matches and after throwing away a two-goal lead at Herve Renard's revamped Sochaux side, the match against struggling Lyon takes on added importance. Last season's runners-up Marseille have seen their season nosedive after losing 1-0 at Nice last week and crashing to a third straight Champions League defeat against Napoli on Tuesday. Elie Baup's side have fallen seven points off the pace and have already suffered three domestic defeats but a home match against lower table Reims on Saturday may be the remedy to get back to winning ways. ""What is important for me, after this series of results is to get back to success and do it in style,"" said Baup.

The president of the French professional clubs union (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, said: ""We are involved in a historic protest and have a real determination to save football by having a weekend without games at the end of November."" Clubs in France's first and second division -- Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 -- were ""confirming their firm opposition to the 75 percent tax proposal"" on annual incomes over one million euros ($1.3 million) by staging a walk-out between November 29 and December 2, he added. Under the proposals, companies rather than players would be liable to pay the high tax rate on the part of their employees' salaries that exceed one million euros. Louvel said clubs, concerned that their ability to attract high-earning top players from abroad to play in France will be hit, would open their doors to fans to explain to supporters why they needed to take such drastic measures. But whether they will win the backing of fans is debatable, with public perception of footballers currently near rock bottom. A recent poll suggested that 82 percent of those questioned had a poor image of the national team, three years after Les Bleus' calamitous World Cup campaign in South Africa, which was marred by a players' strike against the manager and an early exit from the competition.

The proposal will now go before the upper chamber of parliament, the Senate, before returning to the lower chamber National Assembly for a final reading. According to Ligue 1 teams, the new bill, if implemented next year, would leave them with a 44 million euro tax bill.

Jean-Michel Aulas, president of multiple former French champions Lyon, described the new tax as ""unfair"". ""It's an anti-labour tax. This proposal is retroactive, we're being taken hostage,"" said Aulas, whose club's fixture with Paris Saint-Germain will be one of the games lost on the strike weekend. Louvel criticised Ayrault's claim that football clubs would be treated like other businesses. ""Look at the drama which football is experiencing, we are the only country which taxes companies that are losing money,"" he said. ""I want our protest to change politics concerning this situation."" According to official French football figures, the combined loss of France's first and second divisions in 2011-2012 amounted to 108 million euros.

While the Bundesliga powers that be mull over what to do about the result Leverkusen are lying third, one point behind Bayern Munich, their best ever domestic start. Rolled over by Manchester United in their Group A opener the Germans got their European bid up and running at the second attempt, against Real Sociedad. Shakhtar, second only on goal difference to United, will be keen to dispel memories of last season's trip to Germany when the wheels came off their campaign with a 3-0 last 16 loss at Borussia Dortmund. The Ukrainian champions, appearing at the group stage for the fourth successive season, have begun brightly with a win over Real Sociedad and a draw against United. Manchester United (ENG) v Real Sociedad (ESP) United may be enduring a torrid start to the  Premier League, the weekend draw with Southampton leaving the titleholders in unusual territory - eighth place and their worst start in 24 years. Europe has proved more forgiving, with David Moyes' side topping Group A on goal difference after the Leverkusen win and Shakhtar stalemate. Pointless Real need to leave Old Trafford with something if they are to inject some life into their first CL campaign in a decade. Whatever happens the outcome is unlikely to be as harsh as their only previous visit to England, when they crashed 6-0 at Liverpool in the 1975/76 UEFA Cup.

Group B Real Madrid (ESP) v Juventus (ITA) Real Madrid are sailing regally to the knockout stages, the Spaniards' topping Group B after crushing defeats of FC Copenhagen and Galatasaray. Real could field Gareth Bale, who returned to action after minor injuries as a late substitute in Saturday's 2-0 win over Malaga which left Carlo Ancelotti's men in third. Juve's visit precedes the first 'el clasico' of the season with a trip to Barcelona looming at the weekend. Xabi Alonso, sidelined since fracturing a foot in August, is full recovered but unlikely to be thrust straight back into the fray. With two draws Juve are waiting for their first win, and hardly had the best preparations for the trip to the Bernabeu a 4-2 loss, their first of the season, to Fiorentina. Coach Antonio Conte spoke about ""a massive test', adding: ""Madrid are arguably one of the most ambitious teams. We're facing a club that really want this title, because of their history and their hunt for a tenth European Cup."" Galatasaray (TUR) FC Copenhagen (DEN) Both teams, with one point apiece, are out to bag their first wins in Istanbul. Galatasaray picked themselves up from an opening drubbing by Real to share the spoils with Juventus. Having made it into the knockout stages last season they need to get moving if they are to have any hope of repeating that feat this time against Danish champions Copenhagen. Group C Anderlecht (BEL) v Paris Saint Germain (FRA) Paris Saint Germain should be anticipating a third successive win in three Champions League games as they face an Anderlecht side devoid of confidence and pointless. Ligue 1 leaders after trouncing Bastia at the weekend PSG will be without defender Christophe Jallet, Javier Pastore and Thiago Silva, all injured but such are the riches at coach Laurent Blanc's disposal that their absences shouldn't matter. Anderlecht coach John van den Brom sent out the youngest team in the club's history for the 2-0 league win over Mons last Friday and could well do the same on Wednesday where out of form skipper Guillaume Gillet is likely to start on the bench. Benfica (POR) v Olympiakos (GRE) Both these sides will see the outcome of their two matches as pivotal as to who finishes second and a place in the knockout phase. Both have one win to their credit in the opening two games, over hapless Anderlecht. Benfica will fancy their chances for this game as they have won their last seven European home matches while Olympiakos have yet to beat Portuguese opposition away and have not managed a goal in five trips to Portugal. Olympiakos have been in imperious form in their own league, winning seven and drawing one of the matches, the latest a 4-1 away win against Platanias on Saturday. Group D CSKA Moscow (RUS) v Manchester City (ENG) Both will fancy their chances of taking the runners up spot with Pilsen pretty much out of the running and while City have a woeful away record losing five of their six Champions League away games in the past two campaigns they have a chance of recording their second successive away win this season as CSKA have a poor home record, taking just three points from a possible nine in their last appearance in the CL in 2011/12. City warmed up with a psychological boosting first away win in the Premier League on Saturday, 3-1 at West Ham with Sergio Aguero key to the victory. City manager Manuel Pellegrini believes he now has the squad strength to make an impact both domestically and on the continent. CSKA by contrast are now winless and goalless in their last five domestic matches and without playmaker Alan Dzagoev, who is injured. Bayern Munich (GER) v Viktoria Pilsen (CZE) Holders Bayern should have little trouble in making it nine points from three games against pointless Pilsen although coach Pep Guardiola wants to see a marked improvement in their first-half displays which have been generally lethargic all season. The hosts, though, will be missing Swiss midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri and Brazilian defender Dante, who are both injured, while Guardiola will hope that resting French star Franck Ribery at the weekend has allowed him to recover fully from a sore ankle. Pilsen may be struggling to make an impression on the Champions League but they said on Monday they had won an important battle to retain the services of their coach Pavel Vrba, who has guided them to two titles since arriving in 2008. However, they are presently trailing leaders Sparta Prague by six points and have just one win from their last four games."

1310,18/10/2013,02:35,Football: PSG sweating on Ibra fitness ahead of Bastia,Champions Paris Saint-Germain are sweating on the fitness of star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic ahead of the visit of Bastia on Saturday.,"PSG trail big-spending rivals Monaco on goal difference at the top of a Ligue 1 table increasingly developing into a two-horse race, already at this early stage of the season. Those two remain the only unbeaten sides after nine games and have both returned from the Velodrome cauldron with maximum points from a trip to their only potential challengers, Marseille. But the news is not good for PSG as Ibrahimovic was injured when playing for Sweden last Friday. He started training on his own on Thursday but the thigh problem could yet see him miss Saturday's match. It would be a further blow for the Parisians, who will already be without suspended midfield pair Thiago Motta, who was sent-off against Marseille, and Marco Verratti, whose booking against the same team led to his ban. Brazilian centre-back Marquinhos insists, though, that the champions have the squad to make light of any absences. ""They (Motta and Verratti) are two very important players for us but we have a big squad with quality players to replace them and in whom we have every bit of faith,"" he said. While they may be missing certain players, PSG can count on a rapidly improving Marquinhos, who said he was fatigued when he first arrived at the club from Roma at the start of the season. ""It was very difficult for me. I was out of condition when I arrived,"" he said. ""Physically (I'm now at 100 percent), yes, and mentally. But I still think I can improve a lot. I'm keeping my feet on the ground and continuing to improve."" Marquinhos, who cost 30 million euros ($41 million) from Roma even though he is still only 19, has one eye on earning a World Cup berth with his country. ""Why not? I have to dream and believe in myself. To play in the World Cup in my home country would be a dream,"" he added. Bastia are also likely to be without a crucial player in former PSG goalkeeper Mickael Landreau, who is suffering from a hamstring problem. Landreau is closing in on the record number of Ligue 1 appearances held by former Monaco goalkeeper Jean-Luc Ettori. He has 596 compared to Ettori's 602 and is set to break the record at the beginning of December should he play every one of Bastia's matches until then. Such matters won't concern PSG, though, who are simply looking for three points to ensure Monaco, who travel to second-from-bottom Sochaux on Sunday, do not get away from them. Monaco look set to recall France midfielder Jeremy Toulalan, who has been out since the beginning of September with a groin strain. ""I've been through a physical training programme and I'm better now, I'm ready to play,"" he said. In other matches, Marseille were looking to bounce back to form following their home defeat to PSG in the Cote d'Azur derby away to Nice in Friday night's early game. Marseille coach Elie Baup was expecting to have striker Andre-Pierre Gignac fit again after a toe injury, although winger Dimitri Payet was suspended. Nice's greatest worry was over the state of their pitch at the Allianz Riviera following the French Top 14 rugby match between Toulon and Clermont played there on October 5. Nice would draw level on points with fourth-placed Marseille with victory.

1312,04/10/2013,02:35,Football: Old rivals Marseille out to end PSG run,"Monaco may have emerged as Paris Saint-Germain's main rivals in the Ligue 1 title race this season, but the biggest game for the reigning champions is still against their bitter old foes Marseille.","The clubs meet at the Stade Velodrome on Sunday night in the fixture that the French have come to call the 'Classique'. The mega-rich title-holders from the capital will be guaranteed their usual warm welcome in the Mediterranean port city, home to arguably the most passionate fans anywhere in France. As it stands PSG trail Ligue 1 leaders Monaco on goal difference while Marseille are a point further back in third. There is plenty of incentive, then, for Elie Baup's side to continue their impressive record at home to PSG down the years. OM have lost just one of their last nine home meetings with the club from the capital, with that 4-2 reverse coming in October 2008. However, Marseille's recent record has been rather patchy, with just two wins from seven games since the beginning of last month, and they come into the clash off the back of a chastening 3-0 defeat away to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday. ""We know the importance of the game,"" said Baup. ""We need to put the Champions League to one side and start focusing on our domestic league once again. ""We have been on a good run, like Paris, so I don't think the defeat (in Dortmund) will leave any traces."" PSG are unbeaten in 11 matches in all competitions this season and have not lost in 19 games in Ligue 1 since a 1-0 loss at Reims on March 2. It is their longest unbeaten sequence since a record 27-game stretch during their title-winning 1993-94 campaign and their display in beating Benfica 3-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday would have made for ominous viewing for anyone with Marseille connections. ""We are eager for the Marseille game to come around but we need some time to savour this win first,"" said PSG coach, former OM defender, Blanc after the performance against Benfica. ""Marseille will be the last game of a long series (of seven games in 23 days) and we play football to be involved in matches like this,"" added PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu. One man who will not play in the game is captain Thiago Silva, who is still sidelined with a thigh injury, while Marseille are hoping striker Andre-Pierre Gignac -- scorer of a brace in a 2-2 draw between the clubs at the Velodrome last season -- can return after a toe problem. Meanwhile, Monaco, who have already taken four points from trips to Marseille and Paris this season, will be hoping to extend their unbeaten start when they entertain Saint-Etienne in the principality on Saturday afternoon. ""Saint-Etienne are a direct rival for us. I think they will be competing at the top of the table right to the end of the season,"" said Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri, who has doubts over left-back Layvin Kurzawa and former Saint-Etienne striker Emmanuel Riviere and will be without Jeremy Toulalan for the game. That could open the door to a starting berth for Colombian winger James Rodriguez, who has struggled to make an impact since his 45 million-euro ($61m) summer move from Porto. ""For James Rodriguez, it is a problem of mentality,"" explained Ranieri. ""He thinks like a forward but must also defend."" The three sides tipped to fight it out at the top of the table before the season began have already opened up a gap on the rest, but Lille have lost just once in six games to climb up to fourth before hosting Fabrizio Ravanelli's Ajaccio. Lyon have won just one of their last six games before travelling to Montpellier, who are traditionally strong at home, on Sunday. Fixtures (kick-offs 1800 GMT unless stated)"
1313,29/09/2013,23:17,Football: Monaco go top despite being held at Reims,Monaco moved back to the summit of Ligue 1 on Sunday despite being held to a 1-1 at Reims as the momentum swung again at the top in France.,"After Antoine Devaux had given the Champagne-region outfit a shock fourth-minute lead with a close range header, Portuguese international Joao Moutinho opened his season's scoring account with a brilliant free-kick that flew inside the near post nine minutes later. Up until Sunday, Colombian Radamel Falcao and Frenchman Emmanuelle Riviere had scored all of Monaco's goals in the league. Reims almost snatched a shock winner in the 86th minute but Togo international Floyd Ayite was denied by Monaco's Croatian 'keeper Danijel Subasic despite being clear on goal. In a feisty finale, Reims had Atlia Turan sent off for a second bookable offence with two minutes left, but Monaco were unable to capitalise. Claudio Ranieri's men however, have seen their two-point cushion at the top slashed to goal difference over Paris Saint-Germain who defeated Toulouse 2-0 on Saturday, as both clubs ended the weekend's action with identical records of five victories and three draws. ""We gave up a stupid goal early in the match and it's the second time we've started badly,"" explained Monaco captain Eric Abidal. ""It was important to be collective and efficient and we didn't do that. Reims played well and tryed to catch us on the counter but we just weren't clinical in front of goal. ""Even when they were down to ten men, they still created chances."" Marseille are in third on 17 points with Lille and Nice in fourth and fifth respectively, just ahead of Nantes and Saint-Etienne. Promoted Nantes continued their fine start to the campaign earlier on Sunday with a display reminiscent of the style that made them eight-time champions as they defeated Rennes 3-1. The afternoon kick-off at Rennes's Stade de la Route de l'Orient produced a feisty derby that was eventually taken over by the 'Canaries' thanks to strikes from Filip Djordjevic, Serge Gakpe and an injury time clincher from Lucas Deaux. ""We had a very good first half and produced good play and created good chances,"" said their 50-year-old Armenian-Franco coach Michel Der Zakarian. ""We should have been 3-0 up at half-time because we should have had a clear penalty and after we had a black spell at the start of the second half."" His slick passing formation outwitted their hosts in midfield and which led to Djordjevic's headed opener after just 17 minutes. In front of a crowd of some 25,000, Rennes, who suffered only their second league defeat, pushed forward in search of an equaliser only to slip further behind with a brilliant Nantes second on the stroke of half-time. Togo international Gakpe, cut into the box before turning two defenders inside out and then hooking a low shot around Rennes 'keeper Benoit Costil and into the far corner. Nelson Oliveira then broke through for Rennes on 55 minutes after the ball pin-balled into his path and he made no mistake with his one-on-one duel against Nantes number one Remy Riou to pull it back to 2-1. Der Zakarian's men then had to endure a nerve shredding finale before Lucas Deaux finished off a counter-attack deep into injury time to make the scoreline 3-1. Fabrizio Ravanelli's Ajaccio side followed their first win of the season against Lyon in midweek with a hard earned 1-1 draw at home to 2012 champions Montpellier. The Corsican side went behind when Ajaccio-born midfielder Remy Cabella converted a ninth minute penalty before grabbing a share of the points with Ronald Zubar's header 10 minutes before the break."

Radamel Falcao scored twice at the Stade Louis II on Wednesday to take his season's tally to a league-best seven goals, as Monaco extended their best start to a Ligue 1 campaign. ""As a striker of course I'm always happy when I score and that was again the case in the victory against Bastia,"" said Falcao. ""For us it was important to win, thanks to the victory, we stay top,"" added the Colombian. Ranieri, though, said it was premature to cast Monaco, who only returned to the top flight this season after a two-year absence, as genuine title challengers despite their strong start. ""I think it's too early to say we've sent out a signal (to the other teams) but we continue to reaffirm our good start to the season. ""With the results we play with confidence and calmness,"" said Ranieri, who dismissed the significance of being first in the table so early in the campaign. ""The standings? The important thing is the way in which the team moves forward,"" explained the Italian. On Sunday Monaco travel to mid-table Reims who have lost just once in seven outings and conceded only one goal since mid-August. Second-placed PSG, who are in the middle of a run of five fixtures in 15 days, return to the capital on Saturday to host Toulouse. Alain Casanova's men were languishing in the bottom three a fortnight ago but back-to-back victories have catapulted Toulouse up to 11th. Meanwhile, PSG put the disappointment of Sunday's 1-1 draw with Monaco behind them as Edinson Cavani struck the decisive goal in a 1-0 win away to Valenciennes. ""We got the main thing, the three points, because there was a lot of fatigue (on Wednesday). We had a difficult match but it won't be the first, nor the last this season,"" said PSG midfielder Blaise Matuidi. ""We had to recover the two points dropped at home to Monaco, and we did that. Now we have to continue our march forward,"" added the France international. The fixture marks a return to the Parc des Princes for Clement Chantome, who left Paris in the summer to join Toulouse on loan. Despite strong ties to PSG, who are unbeaten so far this term and have not lost any of their last 18 Ligue 1 games, a confident Chantome insisted Toulouse were capable of causing a surprise this weekend. ""We should go there to play the game. PSG are a beatable team when they doubt (themselves),"" said Chantome. Marseille, who are a point behind PSG in third, visit Lorient in Saturday's early game seeking to build on Tuesday's 2-1 win over Saint-Etienne. Joint-leading scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac could return for Marseille after the burly forward was back in training on Thursday following a toe problem, while Jeremie Aliadiere may be welcomed back into the Lorient line-up after a six-week injury lay-off. Elsewhere, Lyon will seek to bounce back from a defeat to lowly Ajaccio when they host Lille, while Saint-Etienne are at home to Bastia and Rennes entertain Nantes in a local derby. Valenciennes go to Sochaux, who are without a coach following the resignation of Eric Hely, in a bottom of the table clash. Fixtures (kick-off 1800GMT unless stated)"

A fifth win in seven games for the principality outfit moved them onto 17 points, two ahead of defending champions PSG, with Marseille one point further back. Both goalkeepers were tested early at the Stade Louis II with Wahbi Khazri drawing a pair of saves from Monaco custodian Danijel Subasic, while Bastia's Mickael Landreau had to be at his best to keep out Riviere and Layvin Kurzawa. However, Landreau's resistance was broken on 39 minutes as James Rodriguez played in Riviere who held off Francois-Joseph Modesto before steering a shot just inside the near post for his sixth goal of the season. Falcao then scored for the fourth straight game two minutes later as he ran onto Joao Moutinho's through ball before firing past Landreau. The Colombian added his second of the evening a minute from the end, taking his tally to a Ligue 1 best seven goals, as he pounced on Yannick Ferreira Carrasco's blocked effort to steer beyond a helpless Landreau. Earlier, PSG's record signing Edinson Cavani netted the only goal at the Stade du Hainaut in first-half stoppage time as Laurent Blanc's side won 1-0 away to struggling Valenciennes. ""We burned a lot of energy in the Monaco match and only had three days to recover. It was a difficult match in all senses,"" said PSG coach Blanc. ""But the important thing is to have taken the three points because we'll have plenty of matches like that over the course of the season."" Javier Pastore twice went close in the opening stages but both 'keepers were relatively untroubled in a quiet first 45 minutes before Cavani struck two minutes into first-half stoppage. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who on Tuesday signed a contract extension tying him to the club until 2016, carried the ball from well inside his own half before picking out the angled run of Cavani, who shot low first time across Nicolas Penneteau into the far corner. The hosts responded after the break with Marco Verratti forced to clear off the line from a Lindsay Rose header. Anthony Le Tallec then had Salvatore Sirigu scrambling across his line as his free-kick whistled just wide of the post. The former Liverpool striker, though, missed an excellent chance to haul the home side level late on as Mathieu Dossevi's effort was deflected into his path but Le Tallec failed to make any contact from six yards out as PSG held on for a narrow win. Defeat for Valenciennes extended the northerners' losing streak to six, leaving them second from bottom on just three points. Elsewhere, goals from Salim Arrache and Aboubacar Demba Camara gave Fabrizio Ravanelli's Ajaccio their first victory of the season as they recorded a 2-1 win at home to Lyon. Martin Braithwaite's 72nd-minute winner handed Toulouse a 1-0 win over Lorient, while promoted Guingamp routed basement club Sochaux 5-1, Nantes beat Nice 2-0 and Bordeaux drew 0-0 with Reims."
1318,24/09/2013,23:14,Football: Marseille get back to winning ways,Marseille put their recent patchy form behind them to beat Saint-Etienne 2-1 at the Stade Velodrome in Ligue 1 on Tuesday evening.,"After a fine start to the season, OM had gone four matches without a win in all competitions before hosting Les Verts. However, Saint-Etienne had not won in Marseille since August 1979, when Michel Platini was among the scorers, and their miserable record in the fixture was extended as they failed to fully recover from the concession of two first-half goals. Elie Baup's side came flying out of the blocks and opened the scoring in the 22nd minute when Benjamin Mendy connected first-time with a Mathieu Valbuena cross from the right, his shot bouncing over the stranded Stephane Ruffier and into the net. The young full-back's first Ligue 1 goal was followed by a first top-flight goal for midfielder Giannelli Imbula four minutes later. Imbula slotted low past Ruffier from a Rod Fanni cross at the end of a fine Marseille move, to leave Saint-Etienne facing a second straight defeat already. The visitors were handed a lifeline just after the half-hour mark when Alaixys Romao was harshly adjudged to have handled a Yohan Mollo cross right on the edge of the area and Faouzi Ghoulam stepped up to slot the penalty past Steve Mandanda in goal. However, they could not find an equaliser, and might have lost by more goals, with Ruffier notably saving twice from Valbuena before the interval. ""After they came back to 2-1 we found things a bit more complicated,"" admitted Baup, speaking to Canal Plus television after the game. ""But we have played well since the start of season, even in losing to Monaco and Arsenal, and we were rewarded tonight."" The win takes Marseille above Saint-Etienne and provisionally into second place in the table, behind leaders Monaco on goal difference before the unbeaten principality club play host to Bastia on Wednesday. Earlier on Tuesday, Lille followed up their weekend 2-0 win at Sochaux with a convincing 3-0 home victory against Evian. Salomon Kalou's neat back-flick turned a Florent Balmont shot into the net to give Lille an early lead in France's far north, and the unfortunate Jesper Hansen then scored an own-goal 32 minutes in. The Danish goalkeeper, who was making his Ligue 1 debut, did well to tip a Nolan Roux header onto the bar, but the ball then richocheted off him and into the net to make it 2-0. Ronny Rodelin then took advantage of poor defending to seal the victory in the second half. Among the other games on Wednesday, defending champions Paris Saint-Germain, who trail the leaders by two points, go to struggling Valenciennes without captain Thiago Silva, who faces six weeks out with a thigh injury."

Claudio Ranieri's side welcome 10th-place Bastia to the Stade Louis II as part of a full programme of midweek fixtures in France, leaving Monaco just three days to recover from Sunday's trip to the capital. ""It's a very good point to pick up. It was a difficult match against an excellent Paris team,"" said Monaco midfielder Mounir Obbadi of the draw in the capital. ""Now, we have to recover very quickly because we play again (on Wednesday) against Bastia, another very difficult match,"" added the Moroccan. Monaco are one of the league's two remaining unbeaten sides, along with PSG, and 60-million-euro ($81 million) striker Radamel Falcao has adapted well to life in Ligue 1, having netted five goals in six matches, including the equaliser on Sunday. ""Both teams tried to win and had their chances. In the end it was a draw. The most important thing for us is that the result keeps us top of the standings,"" said Falcao. ""We're making strides as a team. Personally, I'm especially happy to have scored because we stay first,"" added the Colombian. PSG, who climbed a spot to second after surpassing Saint-Etienne on goal difference, travel to lowly Valenciennes, who have lost five in a row following their lone victory on the opening weekend of the season. France midfielder Blaise Matuidi praised Monaco's display on Sunday but conceded the Parisians felt they should have won and vowed that PSG would bounce back at the Stade du Hainaut. ""Monaco showed they have a good team, even if I thought we were better than them (on Sunday). We'll hope to return to winning ways with a victory at Valenciennes on Wednesday,"" said Matuidi. Despite netting a fifth-minute opener, Zlatan Ibrahimovic endured a difficult evening against Monaco, spurning several chances to add to his haul, and echoed Matuidi's sense of regret. ""We're disappointed because we should have won the match. We played at home and we had a lot of chances. We scored but made an error for their equaliser and we paid for it,"" said the Swede, whose goal was just his second of the campaign. ""This season there's more pressure on us. We're the champions and everyone wants to beat us."" Ibrahimovic's partnership with club record signing Edinson Cavani again failed to sparkle, but the former stressed the need for patience. ""My understanding with Cavani? It's coming, it's coming,"" said Ibrahimovic. PSG will be without captain Thiago Silva, who could be out for several weeks, after the Brazilian defender sustained a thigh injury at the weekend. Third-place Saint-Etienne travel to Marseille on Tuesday knowing that a victory at the Velodrome would send Christophe Galtier's side top, for 24 hours at least. However, Marseille, who are a point behind Tuesday's opponents, could also move to the summit should they win by a three-goal margin. The hosts will be without forward Andre-Pierre Gignac, though, who was ruled out for seven to 10 days with a toe problem. Elsewhere, Nice, fresh off a 4-0 thumping of Valenciennes in the opening game at their new Allianz Riviera stadium, travel to Nantes, while Lyon are away to winless Ajaccio.

Paris played well but so did we,"" said Monaco boss Claudio Ranieri. ""We tried to win right up until the end and I'm very satisfied. I have no regrets. ""I know that Paris have a lot of quality and more experience than our players, so I'm happy,"" the Italian continued.

Ranieri, meanwhile, kept faith with the team that beat Lorient 1-0 last weekend as Mounir Obbadi continued alongside Geoffrey Kondogbia in central midfield with Jeremy Toulalan still out injured. Ibrahimovic had endured a slow start to the season with just one goal prior to Sunday, but last year's leading scorer made an immediate impact at the Parc des Princes as he gave PSG a fifth-minute lead. Thiago Silva's raking downfield ball picked out the run of left-back Maxwell who crossed for Ibrahimovic to volley past Danijel Subasic from close range. The hosts were dealt a blow on the quarter-hour, though, as Silva limped off with a hamstring injury to be replaced by Zoumana Camara. Falcao then hauled Monaco level on 20 minutes as he threw himself at Joao Moutinho's teasing cross into the box, the Colombian bravely putting his body on the line to head beyond Salvatore Sirigu. Monaco's Yannick Ferreira Carrasco fired just over on the volley shortly after, while Edinson Cavani dragged a shot wide of the far post after clever interplay between himself and Ibrahimovic. The Swede then wasted a glorious chance to add to his tally and restore PSG's advantage as he headed over after being left completely unmarked as Lavezzi swung in a dangerous free-kick. And Ibrahimovic was again guilty of botching another opening just moments later. Played through by Marco Verratti, the striker elected to cut back onto his right foot and, rather than shooting, over hit a chip towards the far post as he tried to pick out an advancing Lavezzi. There was further frustration for Ibrahimovic after the interval as he flicked a low cross from Lavezzi the wrong side of the post. Ferreira Carrasco volleyed wide when well placed, while substitute James Rodriguez and Layvin Kurzawa took turns to test Sirigu from distance but the contest began to peter out as the second half wore on. However, Cavani twice very nearly snatched all three points for PSG in stoppage time. The Uruguayan was firstly denied by a fantastic sliding intervention from Andrea Raggi after he chested down Blaise Matuidi's lofted pass and shot on the turn before he sent a header narrowly wide of the near post as Monaco withstood a late threat. ""We played a very good match, unfortunately we weren't able to get that decisive goal,"" said PSG midfielder Blaise Matuidi. ""We put them in difficulty, we had the chances but we failed to take them. We can be happy with the performance we produced, (it was) one of the best of the season."" Earlier, Lyon halted a run of six matches without a victory as they beat promoted Nantes 3-1.

And Les Verts, out of the Europa League,  began promisingly, with Romain Hamouma capitalising on a mistake from Toulouse goalkeeper Ali Ahamada to put the visitors into an 18th minute lead. This was the 26-year-old's third goal of the season. The home side drew back level after the hour when Danish striker Martin Braithwaite, a close season recruit, slid home a close range effort. Guinean defender Issiaga Sylla completed the comeback with quarter of an hour remaining, to give Toulouse a much-needed lift and leave Saint-Etienne treading water in second, on 12 points, sandwiched between billionaire duo Monaco and third-placed PSG. Toulouse's reward was to move up four places to 15th. Sunday's headline encounter at Parc des Princes, the first clash of the season between two of Europe's newest financial heavyweights, is set to indicate who has the early edge in France. Both teams are off to unbeaten starts although Monaco come into the match one point clear of Saint-Etienne while PSG are two points back but starting to change gears after an eye-catching 4-1 win over Olympiakos in midweek gave their Champions League quest a dream start. On Saturday, fourth-placed Marseille and last season's runners-up, travel to Bastia."
1330,17/09/2013,20:58,Football: Wenger not underestimating Marseille,"Marseille may be the outsiders in a testing Champions League Group F, but Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger knows his team cannot afford to underestimate the French club on Wednesday.","The two clubs renew acquaintances at the Stade Velodrome in their group opener on Wednesday, two years after their last meeting in the south of France, when a last-gasp Aaron Ramsey goal secured a 1-0 win for the Gunners. A limited Marseille side surpassed expectations to reach the quarter-finals that season and, with many of those who participated in that campaign remaining on the books, they have progressed under coach Elie Baup. While the presence of Arsenal as well as last season's Champions League runners-up Borussia Dortmund and Italy's Napoli makes Marseille the outsiders, Wenger believes the French team boast an excellent mix of defensive solidity and attacking flair. ""It is the toughest group. All four teams have a chance of qualifying,"" said Wenger at an eve-of-game press conference at the Velodrome on Tuesday. ""On average, you need 10 points to qualify. We can't say now that we will get nine points at home, so the start of the competition is very important for the confidence of the team. We will try to win. ""Marseille is a city where the people are always very passionate and the team is usually very hard to beat,"" he said ahead of the match at a ground which retains a wonderful atmosphere despite currently being closed on one side for reconstruction. ""They are strong defensively, physically strong. And they have a fearsome attacking quartet of (Mathieu) Valbuena, (Andre) Ayew, (Dimitri) Payet and Andre-Pierre Gignac, players who are all capable of making the difference. ""Some say that Dortmund and Napoli are our main rivals, but I would say they are at the same level."" Wenger, whose team lie just one point behind Liverpool at the top of the Premier League, is without a host of players due to injury for the game, including Santi Cazorla, Lukas Podolski, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mikel Arteta. However, Mesut Ozil and Olivier Giroud have been passed fit to play after illness and a knee problem respectively. Despite the presence of such talents in the English side, Marseille goalkeeper and captain Steve Mandanda insisted that he is not afraid and is just relishing being back in Europe's elite club competition. ""Why would we be scared? These are magnificent matches to play in and the reason why we play in the first place,"" said Mandanda, who is a survivor from the last meeting of the clubs here. Meanwhile, Marseille coach Baup dismissed suggestions that his team have a responsibility to boost France's standing in the European game at a time when few Ligue 1 clubs other than Paris Saint-Germain appear capable of genuinely competing at the very highest level. ""Our game (in France) has taken an interesting turn in terms of policy,"" said former Bordeaux coach Baup. ""Our under-20 team won the World Cup, our under-19 team got to the European Championship final, and coaches are trying to get their teams to play football. ""We can see this in our national teams but also in our clubs. We have two clubs (PSG and Monaco) with big budgets, comparable to the best teams in Europe, and they have attracted good players. ""All that means that our UEFA coefficient will improve over time."" Baup will be able to welcome back Ghana star Ayew after he served a domestic suspension at the weekend, so new signing Florian Thauvin will likely drop out of the line-up."
1331,17/09/2013,02:10,Football: Buoyant Arsenal seek winning start in tough group,In-form Arsenal face Marseille on Wednesday wary of the need to hit the ground running in what was just about the toughest Champions League group they could have been given.,"The Gunners have won their last five matches in all competitions, and sit in a lofty position at the top of the Premier League after Saturday's 3-1 win at Sunderland. That sequence of results, combined with the feel-good factor generated by the arrival of record signing Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid, ensures that confidence is high in Arsene Wenger's squad just now, even if they continue to be plagued by injuries. Santi Cazorla was the latest man to arrive in the treatment room, with an ankle problem ruling him out for the next few weeks, and the Spain star joins the likes of Lukas Podolski and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on the sidelines. The increasingly pivotal Olivier Giroud should be fit, however, despite picking up a knee knock in the win at Sunderland, and Wenger certainly hopes so after admitting that the France striker ""is the player at the moment that would be very difficult to replace."" A return to a ground he knows well from his days with Montpellier would be a special occasion for Giroud, as Arsenal seek to extend their record of never having lost away to a French club. ""I know Marseille very well, it is a big atmosphere there and an amazing crowd,"" Giroud told the Arsenal website. ""I am sure we will fight as we need a first win in the Champions League to start well. We need to be strong. Even though we have a lot of injuries, we have a lot of quality and we need to win this game."" These clubs met in the group stage two years ago, an Aaron Ramsey goal in injury time securing a 1-0 win for Arsenal at the Stade Velodrome before the clubs drew 0-0 in London. Amid all the talk about Ozil, who impressed on his debut at the weekend, Ramsey has been Arsenal's outstanding player in the opening weeks of this season. The Welshman scored three times in the 5-0 play-off round win over Fenerbahce and was at it again on Saturday, netting a brace. Nevertheless, it is the arrival of Ozil that has lifted the mood among Gunners fans and raised hopes that their team can progress from the group stage for a 14th consecutive campaign despite the presence of last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund and a Napoli side to be taken seriously under Rafael Benitez. Marseille started the Ligue 1 season with three consecutive wins but needed a late equaliser from Brazilian defender Lucas Mendes to come away from Toulouse with a point on Saturday. While hoping to push fancied duo Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco all the way on the domestic front, there was an acceptance by coach Elie Baup as soon as the draw was made that his team were very much the outsiders in Group F. ""The other three teams are superior to us but we can be the surprise package,"" said Baup at the time. Baup says hard work and an intensive pressing game will be the keys to unsettling Arsenal at a Stade Velodrome which will attract a crowd of around 45,000 despite remaining partially under construction. Nevertheless, the 1993 European champions can boast considerable attacking potential with the likes of Mathieu Valbuena, Andre-Pierre Gignac and Dimitri Payet being joined by France under-20 World Cup winner Florian Thauvin, who completed a protracted transfer from Lille just before the deadline and will hope to make his home debut. ""He has trained a lot and run a lot but he has hardly played any games,"" said Baup of the talented Thauvin, who had previously been monitored by Arsenal and who made his first appearance for Marseille at Toulouse on Saturday. ""I know he is not yet ready but he needs to reacclimatise to playing competitive games."""

1333,15/09/2013,02:30,Football: Sakho in search of lost time at Liverpool,"Mamadou Sakho, who could make his Liverpool debut at Swansea City on Monday, hopes to repair a career that began to unravel on a wintry night in northwest France in January 2012.","Sporting the captain's armband for Paris Saint-Germain, Sakho conceded a penalty with a rash sliding challenge on an opposition forward in the 71st minute of a French Cup tie at Lorient's Stade du Moustoir. Worse, PSG were playing Saint-Colomban Locmine, an amateur team from the French fifth tier, who promptly equalised from the resulting penalty. Worse still, Sakho was making his first appearance under new coach Carlo Ancelotti, who had succeeded Antoine Kombouare just 10 days earlier. Ancelotti took Sakho off almost immediately and although Diego Lugano spared PSG's blushes with an injury-time winner, it marked the beginning of a painful slide into obscurity for his younger team-mate. Initially, Ancelotti persevered with Sakho but that April he lost his place in the side, telling sports daily L'Equipe he found his situation ""maddening and frustrating"". He was omitted from the France squad for Euro 2012 and the arrival of Thiago Silva at PSG from AC Milan weeks later only compounded matters. Although he made 24 Ligue 1 starts last season, he watched many key games -- including both legs of the Champions League quarter-final against Barcelona -- from the bench. When another Brazilian centre-back, Marquinhos signed from Roma in July, the writing was on the wall and yet, just two years previously, Sakho had had the world at his feet. Aged 21, he was voted the best young player in Ligue 1 by his peers and included in the team of the season for the 2010-11 campaign. PSG team-mate Clement Chantome said he was ""the best defender in the French championship"". An anonymous opponent told L'Equipe: ""When he hits the ball with his head, it makes such a sound you think it's going to explode."" Prior to the takeover of PSG by Qatar Sports Investments in the summer of 2011, Sakho's career had pursued a steady upward trajectory from the moment he joined the club at the age of 12. The fifth of seven children raised by Senegalese parents in a working-class district of northern Paris, Sakho lost his father a year after joining PSG and says that, as a result, a career in football became ""an obligation"". A physically precocious, naturally assertive centre-back, he made his PSG debut at the age of 17 and was promptly made captain by then-manager Paul Le Guen, setting a new Ligue 1 record. Many saw in Sakho the potential for a life-long affiliation with PSG in the manner of AC Milan great Paolo Maldini, whose former club were among several starry names to show an interest in the hulking number three as his stock continued to rise. Ironically, however, it was at the hand of Maldini's one-time Milan team-mate Ancelotti that things began to fall apart for Sakho, who was judged too impetuous by the former Chelsea coach. Sakho will not want for visibility at Liverpool, though, and by proving himself at Anfield he will hope to resurrect an international career that slipped into decline as his star waned in Paris. He will have more than half an eye on winning a place in France's squad for the World Cup, should they qualify, and the move to England will also enable him to observe some of his idols at closer quarters. ""Some of my team-mates were champions of France, so I'm interested by the teams they played in and the mentality of the players,"" he said in May 2011. ""For example, I asked Claude Makelele how John Terry thought, how he worked. Then I compare myself, see what I'm missing."" If all goes to plan for Sakho, it will be PSG who see what they are missing."

It was enough to move Saint-Etienne a point above Paris Saint-Germain at the top of Ligue 1 following the champions' 2-0 win at Bordeaux on Friday. Big-spending Monaco could go back to the summit if they win at home to Lorient on Sunday. New Turkish attacking signing Mevlut Erding, formerly of PSG, may have drawn a blank but his supporting act stepped up to the mark in fine style. Corgnet slotted into an empty net on 17 minutes after home goalkeeper Nicolas Penneteau had denied Hamouma. The latter then doubled the advantage on 47 minutes, beating Penneteau with a fine strike from 20 yards. Corgnet wrapped up the victory with a shot through Penneteau's legs from Hamouma's cross six minutes later. Valenciennes' sole response came from a generously-awarded penalty when the referee gave handball against Bayal Sall. Midfielder Corgnet said it was his positioning further forward, behind the front man, that had made the difference. ""That's two matches now that I've played in the hole (behind the striker), my favourite role,"" he said. ""We've been playing better these last two matches and it's a pleasure to be a part of this team."" Earlier, former European champions Marseille had needed a late goal from Brazilian defender Lucas Mendes to snatch a point against the team that began the day bottom of the league. Victory would have taken the team from Provence back to the top of the table, a position they had lost when going down 2-1 at home to Monaco before the international break. ""We had some good periods, especially in the first half, some real quality moves, well co-ordinated, but we didn't turn them into goals,"" said Marseille coach Elie Baup. Marseille created, and squandered, several opportunities, including a shocking miss by Dimitri Payet, who failed to find the net while goalkeeper Ali Ahamada lay helpless on the ground. Ahamada then made an important save to deny France winger Mathieu Valbuena before Toulouse took a shock lead as Wissam Ben Yedder slotted home a pass from Dane, Martin Braithwaite. It would have been enough to secure a first win of the season but Mendes headed home a Valbuena free-kick three minutes from time to earn a point. Even so, Baup's team will need to up their game considerably if they are to gain anything at home to Arsenal in the Champions League in midweek. ""we will have to go looking to make things happen with mental strength, we will have to work hard because our team depends on a lot of collectivity,"" said Baup. On Friday, France midfielder Blaise Matuidi put PSG ahead from a precise Zlatan Ibrahimovic pass before Brazilian winger Lucas Moura sealed the victory for Laurent Blanc's team in the second half. It was a dominant performance from the champions against woeful opponents as PSG demonstrated they are starting to find their feet under Carlo Ancelotti's replacement. Sochaux dropped to the bottom of the table following a 1-0 defeat at Nantes, who moved up to sixth. Reims are fifth after a goalless draw at Montpellier while Ajaccio continue to fall -- they are now just one place above the relegation zone - following a 3-2 defeat at home to Evian.

Sakho and Ilori, who watched Liverpool's 1-0 league win over champions and arch-rivals Manchester United at Anfield on Sunday, signed their contracts after completing medicals at the Reds' Melwood training ground complex. Their arrival, coupled with that of Moses, at northwest side Liverpool meant Reds manager Brendan Rodgers had now signed eight players during the transfer window, the trio following Kolo Toure, Iago Aspas, Luis Alberto, Simon Mignolet and Aly Cissokho to Anfield.

However the lead was short lived as Monaco took advantage of some sloppy Marseille defending to equalise through Colombian record signing Radamel Falcao who crashed the ball home three minutes inside the second half for his third goal of the season. Frenchman Emmanuel Riviere then stole the headlines with 11 minutes left as he latched onto a sweet through ball from Portuguese midfielder Joao Moutinho before slotting the ball past former French number one Steeve Mandanda. It was Riviere's league leading fifth goal of the season. ""I finished off the work,"" said Riviere. ""My speed is my greatest quality and Im at 100% this season. ""It is my confidence which explains my success and the work I've put in. ""What is missing is finishing but my ambition is to target the France national team,"" he added. On a sour note for the 2004 Champions League finalists, Falcao came off with just over 15 minutes left with a right ankle problem although details of the injury remain uncertain. Monaco take their early season tally to 10 points from four matches while Saint-Etienne go joint second on nine with Marseille after defeating Bordeaux 2-1 earlier in the day and defending champions Paris Saint-Germain are on eight. Saint-Etienne bounced back from their midweek Europa League disappointment to beat Bordeaux 2-1 at home while Montpellier came back twice to force a 2-2 draw against fellow southerners Nice. At the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium where Saint-Etienne crashed out in the play-off round on Thursday, losing to Danish side Esbjerg 5-3 on aggregate, Sunday was another matter as goals from Romain Hamouma and captain Loic Perrin ensured there was no European hangover for Christophe Galtier's side. Meanwhile Nice played their last home match at the Stade du Ray before moving into a new venue but despite leading 1-0 and 2-1, Claude Puel's men were pegged back by the 2012 champions in an entertaining 2-2 draw. Galtier's side made it three wins from four as their midweek European disaster was put to one side and put them right in the thick of the title race on nine points. ""I expected a reaction after our Europa League elimination and the best response was the one we produced on the pitch even if there were times we suffered from fatigue and people playing out of position,"" said Galtier afterwards. ""It's a good win as we were coming off a big disappointment,"" he added. Josuha Guilavogui was held out of the hosts' squad with the France midfielder on the verge of a move to Atletico Madrid, but despite his absence Saint-Etienne went in front on eight minutes. Banel Nicolita was afforded too much time on the right and his teasing cross was volleyed expertly past Bordeaux goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso by Hamouma. The home side came close to a second just before half-time as Fabien Lemoine rattled the post, and Perrin went onto double their advantage five minutes after the break as he nodded in Benjamin Corgnet's free-kick. Ludovic Obraniak ensured the hosts were made to face a nervy finish as he cut the deficit with a thunderous strike in the 90th minute, but Saint-Etienne held on to record a third win in four outings and climb up to second."
1344,25/08/2013,23:34,Football: Lavezzi grabs winner as PSG edge past Nantes,"Paris Saint-Germain recorded their first win of the French Ligue 1 season on Sunday, beating promoted Nantes 2-1 at the Stade de la Beaujoire.","When Edinson Cavani gave PSG a 24th-minute lead, it looked set to be a long night for their hosts, but they held on and equalised eight minutes into the second half when a Jordan Veretout free-kick was turned into his own net by Alex at the back post. However, Ezequiel Lavezzi got what proved to be the winner in the 74th minute, firing home the loose ball after a Lucas effort had been blocked on the line by Gabriel Cichero. With his choice of a 4-4-2 formation coming in for some criticism after the defending champions were held by Montpellier and then Ajaccio in their opening two games, PSG coach Laurent Blanc opted for a three-man attack here, with Lavezzi brought back in alongside Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. ""We could go back to the 4-4-2 but also (try out) other systems. We need to find a system which gives us balance,"" said Blanc. ""We have an attacking potential that many other clubs envy but we mustn't forget that to win a match we have to defend well."" Even against a five-man Nantes defence, PSG threatened to run riot in the early stages, with home goalkeeper Remy Riou racing off his line to deny Ibrahimovic before Cavani's first-time half-volley flashed just wide midway through the first half. Shortly after, Ibrahimovic and Cavani combined for the opening goal, with the latter racing on to the Swede's pass before firing low past Riou. Yet the visitors could not build on that and only a fine Salvatore Sirigu save prevented Cichero from equalising for Nantes from an overhead kick just before the break. The hosts did draw level soon after the restart when the unfortunate Alex, under pressure from Papy Djilobodji, saw a Jordan Veretout free-kick rebound off him and into the net at the back post. Sirigu then had to save well to keep out a net-bound Alejandro Bedoya header, but PSG silenced the 37,000 crowd when Lavezzi scored what proved to be the winner. Earlier on an attritional weekend in France's top flight, Nice were held to a goalless draw by Ajaccio in Corsica, while Saint-Etienne dropped their first points of the league campaign, going down 1-0 away to a young Lille side. Salomon Kalou scored the only goal from the penalty spot to deny Les Verts the chance to move level at the top of the table with leaders Marseille. ""Saint-Etienne are a team who often pose us problems,"" acknowledged Kalou, mindful that it was they who pipped Lille to a European place at the end of last season, having also knocked them out of both domestic cup competitions. Marseille end the weekend two points clear of Monaco at the summit after maintaining their perfect start to the season with a hard-fought 1-0 win at Valenciennes, Andre-Pierre Gignac netting a late winner.

However, Ezequiel Lavezzi got what proved to be the winner in the 74th minute, firing home the loose ball after a Lucas effort had been blocked on the line by Gabriel Cichero. With his choice of a 4-4-2 formation coming in for some criticism after the defending champions were held by Montpellier and then Ajaccio in their opening two games, PSG coach Laurent Blanc opted for a three-man attack here, with Lavezzi brought back in alongside Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. ""We could go back to the 4-4-2 but also (try out) other systems. We need to find a system which gives us balance,"" said Blanc. ""We have an attacking potential that many other clubs envy but we mustn't forget that to win a match we have to defend well."" Even against a five-man Nantes defence, PSG threatened to run riot in the early stages, with home goalkeeper Remy Riou racing off his line to deny Ibrahimovic before Cavani's first-time half-volley flashed just wide midway through the first half. Shortly after, Ibrahimovic and Cavani combined for the opening goal, with the latter racing on to the Swede's pass before firing low past Riou. Yet the visitors could not build on that and only a fine Salvatore Sirigu save prevented Cichero from equalising for Nantes from an overhead kick just before the break. The hosts did draw level soon after the restart when the unfortunate Alex, under pressure from Papy Djilobodji, saw a Jordan Veretout free-kick rebound off him and into the net at the back post. Sirigu then had to save well to keep out a net-bound Alejandro Bedoya header, but PSG silenced the 37,000 crowd when Lavezzi scored what proved to be the winner. Earlier on an attritional weekend in France's top flight, Nice were held to a goalless draw by Ajaccio in Corsica, while Saint-Etienne dropped their first points of the league campaign, going down 1-0 away to a young Lille side. Salomon Kalou scored the only goal from the penalty spot to deny Les Verts the chance to move level at the top of the table with leaders Marseille.

There was apparently also interest in the 25-year-old from England, Marseille and Lyon. Toulouse, who recently sold another midfielder, Etienne Capoue, to Tottenham, do not have an option to buy Chantome, whose PSG contract has another two years to run. German youngster moves out on loan German under-21 international Karim Bellarabi has joined Eintracht Brunswick on loan from Bayer Leverkusen for a year, his owners said. The 23-year-old of Moroccan origin has not played since November due to a groin strain. It is a return to the newly-promoted Bundesliga club who Bellarabi left in 2011 to join Leverkusen. Nistor signs on for Evian/Thonon Romanian international midfield player Dan Nistor has joined French club on a four-year deal, the club announced.

At the Velodrome, French international Andre-Pierre Gignac inspired Marseille to a 2-0 defeat of Evian with a brilliant opener on 16 minutes before the home side then made the points safe with 23 minutes left when Dimitri Payet pounced on a rebound for his third goal of the young season. ""The numbers speak for themselves,"" said delighted Marseille coach Elie Baup. ""We've got six points, scored five and conceded one so we've got our season off to a very good start."" Saint-Etienne, who picked up their first silverware last season since winning the league in 1981 title when they won the League Cup, continued where they left off with a deserved 1-0 win over promoted yet pointless Guingamp. The only goal of the match was a flowing move on 52 minutes that was superbly finished off by Fabian Lemoine after a one-two on the edge of the box. Bordeaux gave themselves a hard nights' work when defender Marc Planus was shown a straight red card after just 28 minutes for a shocking tackle on Israeli international Eden Ben Basat but managed to escape with a 1-1 draw at Toulouse. The visitors, who last won the title under current PSG coach Laurent Blanc in 2009, took the lead just before half-time when Malian international Cheick Diabate broke the offside trap and beat Toulouse keeper Ali Ahamada with a close range finish. The lead lasted just two minutes however as Toulouse equalised through Ben Basat who shook off an earlier disallowed goal and blasted home a loose ball after a mixup in the Bordeaux defence. Europa League hopefuls Nice bounced back from their 4-0 thrashing at Lyon last weekend with a 2-1 win over Rennes as they got off to a bright start with a 20th minute opener from Argentine Dario Cvitanic against Rennes. Rennes got the perfect tonic before half-time when Nelson Oliveira scored in the dying seconds of the opening 45 minutes before a defensive howler put Nice back in front. An unforgivable mistake from Nigerian Ejike Uzoenyi - who was last man back - handed the ball on a plate to Jeremy Pied who calmly slotted in past astonished Rennes 'keeper Benoit Costil for three priceless points. Bastia were also the benificiaries of poor defending as they notched up their first points of the season with a 2-0 win over Valenciennes thanks to a Gianni Bruno tap-in with 14 minutes left before a powerful header from Adama Ba three minutes later carried the Corsicans home. Elsewhere, Reims handed new Lille coach Rene Girard his first defeat since moving from Montpellier where he won the 2012 title as they ran out 2-1 winners just outside Paris.

""Mamadou has expressed his desire to find another solution,"" said coach Blanc from PSG's Clairefontaine training base. ""The club has a very clear position until September 2. We will try to find the best solution for both parties."" The transfer window closes on September 2, suggesting PSG will let Sakho leave if they can find a replacement before then. Sakho is thought to be fourth choice centre-half behind the irreplaceable Thiago Silva and his fellow Brazilians Alex and Marquinhos. However, Blanc insisted the club will not be held to ransom. ""When a player wants to leave, the coach doesn't give in.... in this case he takes it on board."""
1356,16/08/2013,02:25,Football: Blanc hoping for Cavani impact as PSG make home bow,"Paris Saint-Germain play their first home game since Laurent Blanc replaced Carlo Ancelotti as coach of the Ligue 1 champions when they entertain Ajaccio at the Parc des Princes on Sunday evening, with memories of last season's struggles against the Corsicans still fresh.","The capital club were held to goalless draws in both meetings with Ajaccio in 2012-13, but those results did not prevent them from comfortably winning the Ligue 1 crown in May. Former France coach Blanc has been at the helm for six weeks now, and oversaw the Champions Trophy win against Bordeaux in his first competitive game at the helm before a 1-1 draw in Montpellier in last weekend's league opener. In both games, PSG have had to come from behind, with Brazilian full-back Maxwell earning them a draw at the Stade de la Mosson after they had trailed at the interval against opponents who pressed and harried tirelessly. With Corsican sides renowned for their aggression, and Ajaccio coach Fabrizio Ravanelli determined to make his team difficult to beat, PSG could face a frustrating evening on Sunday. However, Blanc will hope that 64 million-euro (US$85.4m, £54.6m) record signing Edinson Cavani can have an impact on his home debut after almost scoring as a substitute in Montpellier. ""Certainly,"" Blanc said when asked if the Uruguayan former Napoli striker, who started pre-season training late, will feature against Ajaccio. ""But the question is will he start. That is a decision we will take. He is a little bit behind with his preparation and has had some fitness problems."" Ajaccio lost 1-0 to Saint-Etienne last weekend, but Ravanelli will relish the occasion in the capital having already experienced the heat of the Parc des Princes during his days as a Marseille player. In November 1997, the Italian striker played a central part in a controversial victory at the ground for PSG's bitter rivals, diving to win a penalty that was converted by...Laurent Blanc. ""It is a great thing to return to Paris, especially as a coach. It is a real pleasure,"" said Ravanelli. ""We know we will be playing against an extraordinary team with extraordinary means. But even if we lose we will come out with our heads held high, because we know we can enjoy a good season."" Earlier on Sunday, Monaco, tipped as PSG's most likely title challengers, will look to build on their opening-day win at Bordeaux when they welcome Montpellier to the Stade Louis II. Claudio Ranieri's side. a mixture of expensive summer acquisitions and exciting young talent, won 2-0 in Bordeaux, with Radamel Falcao netting a debut goal after his 60 million-euro move from Atletico Madrid. And in midweek they won an appeal against a three-point deduction handed down as a punishment for a trouble at the end of a game last season, so confidence will be high at the principality club. Confidence is also high in Marseille after OM cruised to an opening-day win in Guingamp. They play host to Evian on Saturday, although recent signing Saber Khalifa is unlikely to make his debut against his former club in that encounter as he builds up his fitness. After thumping Nice 4-0 last weekend, Lyon travel to Sochaux on Friday, the match being brought forward to help Remi Garde's side prepare for next midweek's Champions League play-off, first leg against Real Sociedad. ""Sochaux are a team that like to play football and don't worry about their opponents. That's the club's culture,"" said Garde. ""We are expecting a tough game. We need to confirm our good form and try and cause them as many problems as possible."" In the pick of the other matches, Nice face Rennes at the Stade du Ray, although that match will be played behind closed doors as a punishment for fan misbehaviour last season.

But awash with cash from their Qatari owners the capital club, touting a budget of 400 million euros, are hot favourites to repeat their success, even if newly-promoted fellow moneybags outfit Monaco will look to push them hard. Falcao, a 60-million-euro acquisition from Atletico Madrid, is the big draw for the Monegasques, bankrolled by Russian billionaire owner Dimitri Rybolovlev. But the principality club must begin the season with a two-point deduction after a series of incidents at the end of a game last season. Montpellier represented a tough opening day test for the Parisians given the southerners' status as 2012 champions though they saw the architect of that win, Rene Girard, switch to Lille in the summer, with Jean Fernandez arriving to replace him.

The likes of Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez, Joao Moutinho, Ricardo Carvalho, Eric Abidal and Jeremy Toulalan have all moved to the Stade Louis II, making Monaco look like genuine challengers to reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain. But they have so far failed to bring in a goalkeeper to replace Croatian Danijel Subasic as first choice between the posts, with an approach for Mandanda, the 28-year-old Congolese-born French international. ""There was interest from Monaco which is true. It was a situation where I needed to talk with the club, I have been here for a while now,"" said Mandanda, who joined OM in 2007 from Le Havre. ""We talked with the president and decided to continue the adventure here, where there is an interesting sporting project. ""I didn't decide to leave, but I had to reflect. I feel good here, we have the Champions League to look forward to. Marseille have big objectives."" Marseille face Guingamp in their opening game of the Ligue 1 season on Sunday."
