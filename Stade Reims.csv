0,17/01/2021,23:44,Metz end Lyon's run as PSG take Ligue 1 lead,Lyon slumped to a shock 1-0 home defeat to Metz on Sunday that ended a long unbeaten run and allowed Paris Saint-Germain to stay top of Ligue 1.,"Rudi Garcia's side had come into Sunday's late match on the back of 16 league games without defeat, knowing that a win would have put them back in the lead of France's top flight. However Aaron Leya Iseka struck in the final minute to snatch the points for resilient Metz, who had to withstand a second-half onslaught before finally prevailing and moving ninth. ""We pushed, they pushed, and we were rewarded for our efforts. We knew that we would have little of the ball and that we would have to counter well, and that's what we did,"" said Belgian Leya Iseka. The loss leaves Lyon third, two points behind PSG and Lille, whose own late goal from Jonathan David secured a 2-1 win over Reims. Lyon should have taken the lead six minutes before the break when Karl Toko Ekambi was fed by Tintotenda Kadewere on a breakaway attack. Cameroonian Ekambi, who had forced a good save from Alexandre Oukidja three minutes earlier, successfully cut inside to fashion himself a shooting opportunity but could only blast over. Three minutes later Metz twice came close to taking a shock lead, first hitting the post following a Farid Boulaya cross before Marcelo charged back to block Lamine Gueye's shot on the line. With 16 minutes remaining Ekambi slammed home what he thought was the opener when the ball fell to him after fine play between Memphis Depay and Thiago Mendes. However after a long VAR review the goal was ruled out for Houssem Aouar straying offside when Mendes shot and then pressuring Metz defender Fabien Centonze, who had nodded the ball out to Ekambi. Islam Slimani had the perfect chance to win the match with seven minutes left of his Lyon debut but he shanked his shot, and Oukidja then did brilliant to keep out Aouar's close range effort after fine work from Memphis Depay. That allowed Leya Iseka to claim a shock win for Metz. Earlier David pounced in the first minute of stoppage for Lille to tap home after Xeka's powerful low drive was spilled by Reims goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic to put Lille on 42 points, equal with champions PSG. Jonathan Bamba's long-range leveller two minutes after the break gave Lille a chance to snatch the win after Arber Zeneli had given Reims a 35th-minute lead with a cross that bamboozled home stopper Mike Maignan. Monaco are six points off the lead in fourth after Wissam Ben Yedder's brace gave them a 3-2 win over Montpellier on Friday. The Principality club are level on 36 points with fifth-placed Rennes, who earlier on Sunday fought back from going a goal down after just three minutes at Brest to win 2-1. Saint-Etienne are just four points above the relegation zone after a 1-0 defeat at Strasbourg. The 10-time French champions are 16th and winless in five league matches thanks in part to a missed 10th-minute penalty from Ryad Boudebouz. Ludovic Ajorque scored the winner for the team from Alsace just before the half-hour mark. Nantes are hovering above the drop zone after drawing 1-1 at home with Lens, with Gael Kakuta's 81st-minute leveller for the away side denying Raymond Domenech a first win in charge of the hosts. The former France coach has guided Nantes to three straight draws since his much-derided appointment last month, with his team battling a run of games without a win that stretches back to early November. Bordeaux strolled to a thumping 3-0 win at Nice, who are also without a win in five."
1,19/12/2020,21:46,Reims hold Marseille after Nagatomo own goal,Marseille failed to win for the second time in four days with Saturday's 1-1 draw at home with Reims in Ligue 1.,"Japan's Yuto Nagatomo scored an own goal before Florian Thauvin grabbed an equaliser at the Stade Velodrome. Marseille stay fourth in the table, four points behind leaders Lille. The hosts' coach Andre Villas-Boas made two changes from the midweek defeat at Rennes as Nagatomo, Japan's second-most capped player, and Alvaro Gonzalez came into the starting lineup. The visitors' boss David Guion changed formation from Wednesday's victory over Nantes picking a five-man midfield as Mathieu Cafaro, who scored the winner, came in on the right. Nagatomo, making just his fourth start of the season, made the error for the opener after 21 minutes. Arber Zeneli played a low cross into the box and Nagatomo deflected the ball into his own net. The former Inter Milan left-back's performance then took a further turn for the worse with a yellow card five minutes later for a challenge on French attacker Cafaro. Thauvin brought the sides level just before the interval when the French striker prodded home Dario Benedetto's wayward header. Japan right-back Hiroki Sakai and France playmaker Dimitri Payet attempted to claim late winners but the outfit from the Champagne region held on for a point. Earlier, Opa Nguette and Farid Boulaya scored in Metz's 2-0 win over Lens to send their side up to eighth. Later, Lyon can go top with a win over 11th-placed Nice."
2,29/11/2020,18:19,"Lyon see off Reims to climb second, Monaco cruise","Lyon continued their fine run of form with a 3-0 win over Reims on Sunday which lifted them to second in Ligue 1, while Monaco beat Nimes to also move within two points of leaders Paris Saint-Germain.","Karl Toko Ekambi, Bruno Guimaraes and Moussa Dembele scored for Lyon as they made it 16 points from their last six matches to sit two points behind PSG and above Monaco and Montpellier on goal difference. ""We must continue in this vein and look upwards. We must put a run of victories together,"" said Lyon coach Rudi Garcia. ""This is the first time that we have won three times in a row. As in Angers (last week), we had an opportunity to (move up the) table. We seized it."" Lille can leapfrog Lyon, Monaco and Montpellier if they win at Saint-Etienne later on Sunday. PSG gave the chasing pack a chance to cut the gap in the title race with a 2-2 home draw against Bordeaux on Saturday, having blown a two-goal lead to lose to Monaco last week. Reims, who had Moreto Cassama sent off on 33 minutes, remain fourth from bottom and look destined for a relegation dog-fight. Toko Ekambi, returning from suspension, proved the key for Lyon, hitting the post early on before scoring the opener in the 22nd minute with a header at the back post from a cross by Memphis Depay. He also created the second -- Guimaraes's first for Lyon -- four minutes after the break, the Brazilian's shot taking a deflection off Marshall Munetsi. Toko Ekambi also teed up Dembele for the third shortly after he came on as a substitute for Tino Kadewere who had hit the post in the first half and had a goal ruled out for offside. Cassama was sent off for a foul on Depay when he looked to be in on goal. Later in the day, Monaco eased to a 3-0 victory over Nimes to notch their fourth straight league win. Young midfielder Sofiane Diop gave the hosts an early lead at the Stade Louis II, before Gelson Martins and Kevin Volland both struck in the second half to see off Nimes, who had Lucas Deaux dismissed in the 69th minute. Germany striker Volland has now scored five Ligue 1 goals for Monaco since his close-season move from Bayer Leverkusen. Fourth-placed Montpellier also extended their winning streak to four matches as Petar Skuletic scored late on to grab a 1-0 win at Lorient, despite midfielder Teji Savanier's missed penalty in the first half."

Lille can leapfrog them if they win at Saint-Etienne on Sunday evening. Reims, who had Moreto Cassama sent off after 33 minutes, remain fourth from bottom and look destined for a relegation dog fight.

4,25/09/2020,02:30,Neymar back but problems persist for PSG,"It has been a troubled start to the season for Paris Saint-Germain, overshadowed by a raft of coronavirus cases, suspensions and injuries, but the French champions can welcome back Neymar from a ban for this weekend's Ligue 1 game at Reims.","The world's most expensive player was handed a two-match suspension after his involvement in an unseemly brawl at the end of PSG's 1-0 home defeat by Marseille recently. Without him, his teammates bounced back from losing their opening two games of the season and recorded successive victories against Metz (1-0) and Nice (3-0). ""We are suffering a lot and we are really tired,"" said coach Thomas Tuchel after that latter outing, and Neymar's return can only improve their prospects of keeping that winning run going when they visit a Reims side who are winless in Ligue 1 and were in Hungary on Europa League duty on Thursday. Yet while PSG have now recovered the raft of players -- including Neymar and Kylian Mbappe -- who tested positive for Covid-19 following a holiday after their run to the Champions League final, the problems are not going away for Tuchel. Neymar faces further disciplinary action having been accused by Marseille of racially abusing their Japanese defender Hiroki Sakai in that same recent encounter. The French league will investigate those claims, and claims Neymar used a homophobic slur against Marseille's Alvaro Gonzalez, who the Brazilian says directed a racial slur at him. A decision in that case is expected next week. In the meantime, PSG learned on Wednesday that Angel Di Maria must serve a four-match ban for spitting at Gonzalez. The Argentine can feature this weekend but will not then be able to play another Ligue 1 game until early November, by which time PSG's Champions League campaign will be well underway. While Paris have been linked with a move for Chelsea midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko, Tuchel has lost left-back Juan Bernat to a serious knee injury and concerns remain about the form of Mauro Icardi. The Argentine striker did enough on loan last season from Inter Milan for PSG to sign him permanently for an initial reported fee of 50 million euros. However, he played no part in the Champions League semi-final win over RB Leipzig or the final against Bayern Munich, missed PSG's first two league games this season due to a positive Covid-19 test, and has failed to find the net in the two outings since his return. At least Mbappe looked lively last weekend against Nice, winning and converting a penalty before making another goal for Di Maria. It has been a slow start to life in France for David, who was one of the biggest signings made by a Ligue 1 club in the summer as Lille paid a reported 27 million euros ($31.4m) to recruit the 20-year-old Canada striker from Belgian side Gent. Brought in to replace Victor Osimhen, who was sold to Napoli, David has big boots to fill. Like Osimhen before him, David was prolific in Belgium but has struggled in his first four games in Ligue 1. Can he get his first goal this weekend? 26 - PSG have used 26 different players in four league games this season. 4 - The number of matches PSG's Angel Di Maria will miss -- after this weekend -- due to suspension. 21.5 - The average age of early league leaders' Saint-Etienne's starting line-up last weekend, with veteran coach Claude Puel having rejuvenated his squad. It is further evidence of Ligue 1's ability to keep producing young talent."
5,05/04/2020,22:10,French club doctor 'commits suicide' after coronavirus diagnosis,"French Ligue 1 club Reims were on Sunday in mourning for long-serving club doctor Bernard Gonzalez who committed suicide after being diagnosed with coronavirus, sources confirmed.","""Devastated, Reims cries for Bernard Gonzalez,"" said a statement released by the Ligue 1 club. ""Not just the club but also hundreds of men and women in Reims."" Contacted by AFP, Reims mayor Arnaud Robinet said he had been made aware of the suicide of the 60-year-old, who had worked at the club for over 20 years, by the local prefecture. ""I was told Doctor Gonzalez had left a note in which he mentioned that he had tested positive for COVID-19."" A medical source also confirmed to AFP the existence of this letter but added that the doctor had appeared ""to be in good shape two days ago"". ""I am shocked by his death because he was someone I had known for many years,"" said Robinet. ""No only was he the club doctor, but he was also the GP of many people in Reims. He was known for his human and professional qualities. ""He will be missed by the football family and all those in Reims who met him."" Reims club president Jean-Pierre Caillot said he was ""stunned"" by the news. ""This pandemic has struck Reims in the heart. A great personality and great professional of the sport has left us,"" said Caillot. More than 8,000 people have died from the coronavirus in France."
6,07/10/2019,00:16,Late goal earns Saint-Etienne derby win over Lyon on Puel debut,Robert Beric scored a last-minute winner as Saint-Etienne defeated bitter rivals Lyon 1-0 on Sunday and new coach Claude Puel made a triumphant start in his first match in charge.,"Former Leicester City and Southampton boss Puel replaced Ghislain Printant on Friday after signing a three-year deal with the club that entered the derby clash bottom of Ligue 1. ""To produce such a display against Lyon is great, especially in such a short amount of time,"" said Puel, who also spent three years at Lyon from 2008-2011. ""This victory shows the players the sacrifice and desire they need to put into a match. I'm building something here and this fine start must be backed up."" Lyon began the weekend in trouble of their own, languishing a disappointing 11th after a domestic six-match winless run but buoyed by a Champions League victory at RB Leipzig. Anthony Lopes tipped a Riyad Boudebouz effort onto the post in a cagey first half at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, and the Lyon goalkeeper made another top reflex save to deny Denis Bouanga on the hour. Moussa Dembele came off the bench for Lyon and forced Jessy Moulin to palm away his header on 85 minutes, with Houssem Aouar then trickling an effort wide after sneaking in behind the hosts' defence. Beric won it at the death though as he rose superbly to head a Boudebouz cross beyond the reach of Lopes to send Saint-Etienne up to 13th and two points above Lyon. ""I'm very worried by our results,"" said Lyon coach Sylvinho. ""We're losing all our matches in the same way. It's not up to me to say if I'm the man for the situation. ""I feel the same as I did after (the 2-2 draws with) Amiens and Brest,"" he added. ""We've conceded again at the end of the match. It's even more frustrating in a derby."" In-form Victor Osimhen's seventh league goal of the season wasn't enough for Lille as they missed the chance to go third after drawing 2-2 with Nimes. Nigeria international Osimhen, 20, who also scored in Lille's 2-1 Champions League defeat to Chelsea midweek, struck the hosts' leveller with 11 minutes remaining after a Renaud Ripart penalty at the end of the first half and Kevin Denkey's neat 70th-minute finish had cancelled out Loic Remy's 13th-minute opener. A win for Lille would have moved them above surprise package Angers following their 4-0 hammering at the hands of league leaders Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday. Instead Christophe Galtier's side stay in fifth on 15 points from nine matches, but they could have easily lost against a spirited Nimes side that belied their pre-match league position of 17th. The lively Romain Philippoteaux, who won the spot-kick that Ripart calmly slotted home, came close to scoring a wonderful individual strike when his finish clipped the outside of the post following an exciting dribble. Reims moved into sixth, a point behind Lille after Boulaye Dia's strike three minutes after half-time consigned former high-fliers Rennes to the latest defeat in a miserable run of form. Level with PSG at the top of the league at the end of August, Julien Stephan's Rennes haven't won in the eight games in any competition since and have plummeted down to 10th. Reims meanwhile consolidated a fine start to the season that sees them with the league's best defensive record alongside PSG, with just four goals conceded in nine games."
7,25/09/2019,23:08,Injury-hit PSG slump to shock home defeat by Reims,Paris Saint-Germain fell to a shock 2-0 loss to Reims at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday as headers from Hassane Kamara and Boulaye Dia gave the visitors a famous win.,"The Ligue 1 champions, depleted by a spate of injuries, remain top of the table after seven games, but have already lost twice this season after defeat at Rennes last month. It was PSG's first home loss in the league since a 2-0 reverse at the hands of Rennes in May 2018, ending an unbeaten run of 22 matches at the Parc. PSG only lead second-placed Angers on goal difference, after Rachid Alioui's late double grabbed Stephane Moulin's side a 2-0 win at Toulouse. Neymar, who had scored late winners in each of his previous two Ligue 1 games, started alongside Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Pablo Sarabia up front, with Edinson Cavani, Kylian Mbappe and Mauro Icardi all still injured. But the Brazilian, who failed to force through a return to Barcelona in the close-season, was a peripheral figure and was guilty of gifting Reims possession on numerous occasions. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel was also forced to play a makeshift midfield featuring full-back Juan Bernat, with Marco Verratti suspended. The hosts made a slow start, despite Neymar going close with a free-kick, and fell behind just before the half-hour mark. Reims, who also beat PSG 3-1 on the final day of last season, launched a rare attack and Hassane Kamara rose to powerfully head home Zimbabwean Marshall Munetsi's right-wing cross. PSG's injury woes intensified further shortly before half-time as Choupo-Moting hobbled off to be replaced by Angel Di Maria, who had originally been rested and named as a substitute. Reims came agonisingly close to doubling their advantage in first-half injury-time, as centre-back Yunis Abdelhamid's header bounced narrowly past the post. PSG dominated possession for much of the second half without posing a serious threat, and Reims again came within centimetres of making it two as substitute Remi Oudin's low, left-footed effort struck the base of the post. And Dia entered the fray before planting another fine header past the despairing dive of home goalkeeper Keylor Navas, sealing a richy-deserved victory. Earlier on Wednesday, Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen scored as Lille moved into third with a 2-0 victory over Strasbourg, while Lyon were held by Brest. Last season's runners-up Lille have now won all four of their home league games this term and sit two points adrift of PSG. The 20-year-old Osimhen put Christophe Galtier's Lille into a 43rd-minute lead at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy by lashing home after some slack Strasbourg defending to net his sixth goal in seven games this season. The three points were secured 19 minutes into the second half as Osimhen turned provider for former Chelsea and Marseille forward Loic Remy to slide in his first goal of the campaign. Elsewhere, Lyon saw their winless streak extended to six matches in all competitions with a 2-2 draw at promoted Brest. Moussa Dembele moved joint-top of the Ligue 1 goalscoring charts on six strikes with Osimhen by giving Lyon a 28th-minute advantage, but Yoann Court equalised for Brest less than 60 seconds later. Maxwel Cornet appeared to have eased some of the pressure on Lyon coach Sylvinho by netting in the 69th minute, but Court completed his double to snatch Brest a point with five minutes remaining. ""We didn't play well, I'm not satisfied,"" said former Arsenal and Barcelona left-back Sylvinho. ""Once again we lost the three points in the final minutes. We have a lack of confidence and it generates fear."" Lyon, widely considered PSG's likeliest title challengers ahead of this season, slipped to 11th, already six points off the pace."
8,23/09/2019,00:04,Neymar saves PSG to send French champions three points clear,Neymar scored a fine late winner as Paris Saint-Germain beat Lyon 1-0 on Sunday to move three points clear at the top of the Ligue 1 table.,"The Brazilian finally beat Anthony Lopes, who had pulled off numerous impressive saves, with three minutes of normal time to play at the Groupama Stadium. It was Neymar's second winning goal in as many league games since being reinstated to the team following a protracted transfer saga which saw him attempt to force through a return to Barcelona. ""Neymar can do better,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""It's the second or third game in four months for him. He's not at 100 percent capacity. ""He is not at his limit. He can do better, he will do better. He's going to get to his best level, with matches and decisive goals like that, it's going to help him."" The Parisians sit top on 15 points after Angers and Nice both won over the weekend to temporarily join Tuchel's side at the summit, and followed up their impressive midweek Champions League victory over Real Madrid with the win in constant drizzling rain in Lyon. Sylvinho's Lyon remain in ninth place and are without a win since mid-August. PSG were without the attacking trio of Kylian Mbappe, Edinson Cavani and Mauro Icardi due to injuries, while midfielder Marco Verratti started on the bench. The best of the early chances fell to Neymar on 22 minutes but his effort was superbly saved by Lopes. Neymar was denied again by another tidy Lopes stop four minutes before the break as the Portugal international tipped the Brazil forward's dangerous free-kick over the bar. PSG's domination from the first half carried over into the second 45 minutes. Abdou Diallo had the pick of the chances, using the wet conditions to glance a header from a Neymar corner over the crossbar. The world's most expensive player was targeted by home fans when taking set-pieces from the left-hand side as they threw plastic bottles and rolled-up bin bags at him. With 87 minutes on the clock, substitute Verratti found Neymar in the box who dribbled into space and finally beat Lopes to the keeper's left with a low shot. He celebrated by running towards the same corner of the ground where he had earlier been taunted by the Lyon supporters. Earlier, Angers moved into second place after replacement Casimir Ninga scored an 11-minute hat-trick in a 4-1 thrashing of Saint-Etienne. Ninga, who joined the club from second-tier Caen in August, put Angers into the lead with less than a quarter of an hour remaining before adding two more goals by the 89th minute to clinch their first home win over Saint-Etienne in 43 years. The defeat at Stade Raymond Kopa leaves Les Verts a point above the relegation zone, with Ghislain Printant's outfit having failed to win since the opening day of the season. Stephane Moulin's Angers, who finished 13th in the league last season, have claimed four wins from their opening six fixtures to pull level with Nice in second spot. ""Casimir made a thundering impact. I truly congratulate him because he's worked a lot since arriving at the club,"" Moulin said. ""The second half perfectly resembles what we have been doing since the start of the season. It's a little bit new but it corresponds perfectly to what we're trying to do."""

Blackburn-born Donis, whose father played for the English Championship club, joins the club as a replacement for Pablo Chavarria, who quit Reims for Spanish side Mallorca. Formerly with Juventus, Donis joined Stuttgart on a four-year contract in July 2017 and scored seven goals in 45 Bundesliga appearances."
10,10/08/2019,21:30,Opening day Marseille defeat 'difficult to accept' for returning Villas-Boas,"Andre Villas-Boas said losing his first game in charge of Marseille on Saturday was ""difficult to accept"" as he made his return to football.","Villas-Boas' side slumped to a 2-0 home defeat by Reims in their Ligue 1 opener. The former Porto, Chelsea and Tottenham manager is back coaching for the first time since an acrimonious departure from Shanghai SIPG in 2017, but saw second-half goals from Boulaye Dia and Suk Hyun-jun sink Marseille at the Velodrome. ""It's difficult to accept. We were too slow in attack. We failed to find space,"" he said. ""Obviously we need to become more confident, and doing so is always more difficult after a home defeat, but we have to keep working on it."" Villas-Boas has been given the task of returning OM to the Champions League for the first time since 2013, after taking over the reins from Rudi Garcia. But on Saturday's evidence he faces an extremely difficult job with a team who finished fifth last season to miss out on European qualification altogether. The 41-year-old named close-season arrivals Dario Benedetto and Alvaro Gonzalez on the bench, with France attacker Florian Thauvin missing through injury. The Portuguese coach saw his team make a laboured start, failing to manage a single shot on target in the first half, with goalkeeper Steve Mandanda forced into fine saves to deny Moussa Doumbia and Dia. The hosts finally called visiting 'keeper Predrag Rajkovic into action seven minutes after the restart, with the Serbian collecting Dimitri Payet's tame effort. Marseille midfielder Kevin Strootman rattled the crossbar in the 57th minute, but Reims deservedly found a breakthrough shortly afterwards as Dia played a neat one-two with Tristan Dingome and drilled the ball over the advancing Mandanda. Argentine international striker Benedetto was handed a Ligue 1 debut with 17 minutes remaining, but failed to make an impact as Reims substitute Suk instead ran clear at the other end to wrap up the three points in the final minute of normal time. On Friday, Cesc Fabregas was controversially sent off after a VAR review as Monaco were brushed aside 3-0 by an impressive Lyon in the opening game of the season. Reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain have left out the world's most expensive player Neymar for their first match against Nimes on Sunday, admitting talks over a possible move away for the Brazilian are ""more advanced""."
11,09/03/2019,22:31,Skipper Marcelo injured as Lyon stumble before Barca trip,"Lyon's stand-in captain Marcelo left the field with a leg injury as his side struggled to a 2-2 draw at Strasbourg on Saturday, just days away from the Champions League last 16 second leg at Barcelona.","Bruno Genesio's side head to the La Liga giants with the tie finely balanced at 0-0 after the first leg in France but the Brazilian defender is a doubt for Wednesday's fixture. ""It's too early to know if he'll play against Barcelona. He has a little issue with his hamstring. We'll do everything we have to so he plays, but we have to wait until Sunday,"" Genesio told Canal+. Genesio added he plans to talk to the club's doctor after extra tests are carried out on the centre-back on Sunday. Moussa Dembele scored twice for Lyon at the Stade de la Meinau before Ludovic Ajorque claimed a double of his own in the space of 60 seconds during the second half. Club skipper Nabil Fekir, forward Bertrand Traore, attacker Memphis Depay as well as midfielder Tanguy Ndombele started on the bench as Genesio attempted to rest the influential four as the French club eye a first quarter-final in Europe's top-tier competition since 2010. Fekir and Traore were brought on during the last quarter of an hour looking for a late winner but their efforts were in vain. Lyon remain in third place in the table, four points behind Lille who travel to Saint Etienne on Sunday. Elsewhere big-spending Monaco dropped down to 17th place after a 1-1 draw against Bordeaux as 10-man Amiens beat mid-table Nimes 2-1 to move to 16th and Dijon rose out of the automatic relegation places with a 1-1 stalemate against Reims."
12,26/01/2019,23:12,Monaco plight persists in wake of Henry exit,"Monaco suffered another damaging defeat as they lost 2-0 at Dijon in Ligue 1 on Saturday, just 24 hours after reappointing former boss Leonardo Jardim to take over from the sacked Thierry Henry.","Former France and Arsenal star Henry was suspended and later axed by Monaco after just two wins in the league since his arrival in October. Jardim, who led Monaco to the French title in 2017, is returning to the club only three months after he was dismissed following a dreadful start to the season. His first game back in charge will be Tuesday's League Cup semi-final against Guingamp, as Henry's former assistant Franck Passi oversaw the trip to fellow strugglers Dijon. The abject nature of this latest defeat further emphasised Monaco's perilous position in the table where they remain second from bottom, a point above last-placed Guingamp. ""We're giving everything but it's not enough,"" said Monaco captain Radamel Falcao. ""Each player has to continue to give more, all of us together. We're all in the same boat. ""We didn't manage to change things with Thierry Henry and now we must carry on with a better spirit and all fight together."" Dijon's Kwon Chang-hoon notched his first league goal since May, having recently returned from an Achilles injury, with a calm finish on 24 minutes after a static Naldo played the South Korean onside. Monaco were reduced to 10 men on the hour when Brazilian Naldo saw red for a clumsy challenge on Julio Tavares, and another defensive lapse allowed Naim Sliti to wrap up what was just Dijon's second league win since August. It was Naldo's second red card in a week after he was also dismissed in the 5-1 loss to Strasbourg last Saturday. ""We had chances just like in the past four of five matches but we always make a mistake that kills us,"" said Passi, who refused to be drawn on his own future. ""We let the other team go ahead and we're chasing after the result and that obviously makes it harder,"" he added. ""These players have the quality. They have what it takes to stay up but they just need for things to click and for it to happen quickly."" Youcef Atal and Allan Saint-Maximin scored for Patrick Vieira's Nice in a 2-0 home win over Nimes, while Kenny Lala fired home a sweet half-volley with practically the final kick to give Strasbourg a 1-0 victory over Bordeaux. Reims climbed into the top half as a 1-0 win at Guingamp stretched their unbeaten run to six matches. On Sunday, leaders Paris Saint-Germain will host Rennes without the injured Neymar. The world's most expensive player limped out of Wednesday's French Cup win over Strasbourg after hurting his foot, an injury similar to the one that ruled him out for more than two months last season. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel has said it is ""still too early"" to assess the seriousness of Neymar's injury, leaving the French giants sweating over his fitness ahead of their Champions League clash with Manchester United next month."

The equaliser came when Romain Metanire was judged to have tripped Fode Ballo-Toure as he raced into the box, just as the away side thought Remi Oudin's 64th-minute strike would be enough for the three points. PSG were one of a host of French teams to have their matches postponed for security fears ahead of a weekend of fierce protests from ""gilet jaune"" demonstrators. Lille are two points ahead of Montpellier, who were set to take on Thomas Tuchel's champions in Paris on Saturday before the match was moved to next month, while Lyon are a further point back in fourth after their trip to Toulouse was also put back to January. Earlier on Sunday, Strasbourg were stopped from following up a midweek draw with PSG with a win over relegation strugglers Caen when Saif-Eddine Khaoui struck with 10 minutes remaining to grab a precious away point."
14,12/11/2018,00:10,Cavani bags hat-trick as perfect PSG leave Henry's Monaco down and out,Thierry Henry's disastrous start as coach of Monaco continued on Sunday as Edinson Cavani's VAR-assisted hat-trick helped Paris Saint-Germain to an easy 4-0 win in the principality that saw them extend their perfect record in Ligue 1 this season.,"Neymar netted a penalty to complete PSG's victory, as they made it 13 wins from 13 league games under Thomas Tuchel, further stretching their start to the season that is a record in France and in Europe's so-called big five leagues. The result for them came after a week marred by revelations from French investigative website Mediapart that youth scouts at PSG had subjected potential signings to racial profiling over several years. But while they go 13 points clear of second-placed Lille at the Ligue 1 summit, the club who have been their main challengers in recent seasons continued their deeply worrying slump, with Henry again left to look on helplessly from the touchline. Champions in 2017, Monaco are in the relegation zone and five points away from outright safety having failed to win in six matches in all competitions since the Arsenal and France great took charge. They have now gone 16 games without a win altogether, with this result following a 4-0 home reverse against Club Brugge which knocked them out of the Champions League. Monaco are on their worst run in France's top flight in 32 years, at a time when Football Leaks claims about their Financial Fair Play breaches and the arrest of their Russian billionaire owner Dmitry Rybolovlev on corruption charges have cast a further shadow over the club. ""We are playing for survival, nothing else,"" said Henry, who has picked up a squad cursed by injuries. Here he was missing a dozen players due either to injury or suspension at kick-off, while both Belgian international Nacer Chadli and his replacement Jordi Mboula had to come off hurt. ""We lost two more players tonight, so it is starting to become a lot,"" he said, adding: ""I am staying positive because even with all that we managed to create chances against PSG."" The average age of his bench here was under 19, while his starting line-up featured a 17-year-old debutant in defence in Benoit Badiashile. It was little wonder that PSG -- themselves showing six changes following their Champions League draw at Napoli -- found the going so easy. They went ahead in the fourth minute when Neymar drove the ball across goal for Cavani to convert. The goal was initially disallowed before being given by the Video Assistant Referee, and the same thing happened in the 11th minute when Cavani turned the ball in again after the flag was wrongly raised for an offside against Moussa Diaby. In contrast to those two goals, a fine Julian Draxler finish in first-half stoppage time was initially given before being disallowed on review. However, Diaby squared for Cavani to complete his hat-trick in the 54th minute, and Neymar then rolled in a penalty after Kylian Mbappe had been fouled by France teammate Djibril Sidibe. ""I am very satisfied with the result, and with the fact we showed the hunger to win a 13th straight game. That is extraordinary,"" said Tuchel. ""Monaco and Henry are in a very difficult situation with lots of players out injured. This wasn't the night for Monaco to challenge us. They can do that if they have all their players back but not today."" Elsewhere on Sunday, Lucas Ocampos and Adil Rami scored as Marseille bounced back from a run of four straight defeats to beat Dijon 2-0 on an emotional afternoon at the Velodrome. A minute's silence was held before kick-off in memory of the eight people killed when two buildings collapsed in the southern French city on Monday. The result lifted Marseille up to sixth, back to within three points of third-placed Montpellier, who beat them 3-0 last weekend. Bordeaux were held to a goalless draw by Caen, while Rennes drew 1-1 with local rivals Nantes."
15,26/09/2018,23:14,Record-setting PSG make it seven wins in seven,Paris Saint-Germain set a new club record on Wednesday when a 4-1 victory over Reims gave them a seventh win from seven games this season and an eight-point lead in Ligue 1.,"With a perfect 21 points, new coach Thomas Tuchel surpassed the previous best start of 19 points by predecessor Unai Emery last season. The champions can now claim another slice of history on Saturday where a victory over Nice will allow PSG to equal Lille's all-time record of eight wins at the start of a season set back in 1936-1937. Missing the injured Lassana Diarra and suspended Kylian Mbappe, PSG surprisingly fell behind to Reims after just two minutes on Wednesday when Xavier Chavalerin stunned the Parc des Princes. But Edinson Cavani levelled after five minutes and then won the 24th-minute penalty which was converted by Neymar. Uruguay striker Cavani hit the third before half-time to take his season's goal tally to five, the same as Neymar. Thomas Meunier tucked away the fourth in the 55th minute after being set up by young striker Moussa Diaby much to the delight of watching US basketball legend Michael Jordan in town for this week's Ryder Cup. Moussa Dembele scored his first two goals for Lyon in two minutes in Dijon to set his team on course for an 3-0 victory that lifted them into second in Ligue 1. The 22-year old striker, who joined from Celtic on August 31, scored the opener after 17 minutes with a first-time chip over the goalkeeper and two minutes later added a second, acrobatically putting home a rebound. Martin Terrier headed a third in the 35th minute. On a night when six early matches produced six red cards, Lyon played the last 34 minutes with 10 men after Lucas Tousart received a second yellow card. Dijon's Enzo Loiodice followed in the final minute. Lyon are on 13 points from seven games, eight behind PSG. Lille, who started the evening in second, lost 1-0 at Bordeaux. Francois Kamano put the home team ahead after just seven minutes. Lille played the last few minutes with 10 men after Adama Soumaoro received a second yellow card. The other two teams who could have climbed to second, Marseille and Montpellier played games that followed similar patterns until the dying seconds. Montpellier fell behind at Caen to a goal by Saif-Eddine Khaoui after 10 minutes. Andy Delort and Damien Le Tallec resplied and put the visitors ahead and, briefly, second in the league. But Yacine Bammou leveled after 64 minutes. Seven minutes from time, Montpellier's Vitorino Hilton was sent off for a wild sliding tackle. Caen created dangerous chances, but Montpellier held on to draw 2-2. In Marseille, Kenny Lala broke away and put Strasboug ahead after 27 minutes. The home team replied twice just before half time. After Florian Thauvin was sent flying in the 41st minute, Dimitri Payet coolly converted the penalty. Then Morgan Sanson curled a shot inside the post to put Marseille ahead on the stroke of half time. After Jordan Amavi received a straight red in the 52nd minute the 10 men of Marseille held out until the 89th minute when Nuno Da Costa leveled for the visitors. Marseille responded with one last attack, and Valerie Germain met a low cross with a ferocious shot to secure a 3-2 win."
16,20/04/2018,22:09,Reims secure promotion back to French top flight,"Reims clinched promotion back to Ligue 1 on Friday, ending a two-year absence from the top tier of French football.","A 1-0 win at home to fellow promotion hopefuls Ajaccio, while second-placed Nimes dropped points, confirmed the club from Champagne country as Ligue 2 champions. Six times French champions in a glorious post-war era, when they also twice reached the European Cup final -- losing to Real Madrid in 1956 and 1959 -- Reims spent four consecutive seasons in Ligue 1 before being relegated in 2016."

The sacking comes a day after Reims lost 2-0 away at Nice, a fourth defeat in five league games leaving them dangerously close to the relegation zone. With three games to play, the former European Cup finalists from Champagne country are just two points clear of the bottom three."
18,22/04/2016,02:35,Race for Europe enters home straight in France,The battle for European places in France's Ligue 1 is set to come down to the wire with just four matches of the season remaining and several teams still in the running.,"Monaco reclaimed second place from Lyon last weekend after a 2-1 win over Marseille, while Bruno Genesio's men slipped to third after being held 1-1 by fellow Champions League hopefuls Nice. Four straight wins have fired Saint-Etienne back into contention along with Lille, who were at one stage in a relegation scrap before reeling off six victories in succession. Rennes' charge has been slowed by back-to-back defeats but the Bretons still harbour realistic hopes of qualifying for the Europa League, although their challenge could peter out should they lose to Monaco on Sunday. ""There's a scent of Europe. I'm sure that everything is still possible. We're a bit behind our direct rivals (...) but a victory against Monaco would put us back in the mix,"" said Rennes goalkeeper Benoit Costil. Monaco, meanwhile, still must go to Lyon on the penultimate weekend of the season which could determine the destination of France's second automatic Champions League qualifying spot behind runaway title-winners Paris Saint-Germain. Last weekend's draw at Parc OL, in which Lyon played for over an hour with 10 men, snapped a five-game winning run at home for OL, who will aim to respond on Saturday at relegation-threatened Toulouse. The visitors will be without the suspended Maxwel Cornet, while time is running out for Toulouse with three points separating them from safety despite a mini-revival under Pascal Dupraz. Nice coach Claude Puel felt it was a case of two points lost at Lyon and said beating struggling Reims on Friday was imperative if they are to remain on course for Europe's premier club competition. ""The peak of our season is on Friday. If we're not good against Reims, it's not even worth talking about the other matches, whether it's those of our opponents or our own,"" said Puel, whose side also face fifth-place Saint-Etienne in week 37. Saint-Etienne, who are level on points with Nice, have based their recent success on an impenetrable defence and host Lorient on Sunday, while Lille won't face Angers until next Wednesday with Frederic Antonetti's side taking on PSG in the League Cup final at the Stade de France this weekend. Crisis-hit Marseille enjoyed a rare highlight in a disastrous season as they set up a showdown with bitter rivals PSG in next month's French Cup final following Wednesday's 1-0 victory at second-tier Sochaux. However, they remain just six points clear of the bottom three and will hope interim coach Franck Passi, who has stepped in after the dismissal of Michel, can finally bring about an end to their 14-game winless run at the Stade Velodrome against Nantes. Gazelec Ajaccio host Bastia in a Corsican derby given added importance in light of the top-flight newcomers' battle to avoid an immediate return to Ligue 2. Gazelec have won just once since the turn of the year and find themselves trailing 17th-place Reims by two points, with games against Lyon and PSG still to come. Fixtures (kick-off times GMT)"
19,20/02/2016,19:11,No European hangover for rampant Ibra and PSG,"There was no Champions League hangover for Paris Saint-Germain as they continued their relentless march towards another Ligue 1 title by outclassing Reims 4-1 on Saturday, Zlatan Ibrahimovic scoring twice.","The Swede got the opener in Tuesday's 2-1 Champions League last 16, first-leg win against Chelsea and he scored once in each half here to take his tally for the season to 23 league goals and 30 in all competitions. Ibrahimovic is playing some of the best football of his career at the moment and the 34-year-old also set up the opener for Gregory van der Wiel and got the assist for Edinson Cavani's goal as Paris maintained their unbeaten domestic record this season. Prince Oniangue had equalised for Reims in the first half but PSG were too strong and are now a huge 27 points clear at the top of the table before Monaco in second host bottom club Troyes later. Laurent Blanc's side extended their Ligue 1 record unbeaten run to 36 matches and the only black mark on their afternoon's work was the first-half substitution of Angel Di Maria, although that was merely a precautionary measure. With Serge Aurier still absent after being suspended by the club for insulting Blanc and several team-mates in a video posted on social media, Van der Wiel started at right-back for PSG and it was the Dutchman who opened the scoring in the 12th minute. Van der Wiel started the move and found Ibrahimovic before running onto the Swede's superb return ball to fire past Johann Carrasso, who was making his debut in goal for the visitors. However, Reims drew level in the 34th minute when Kevin Trapp got nowhere near a Nicolas de Preville free-kick delivery and Congolese midfielder Oniangue gleefully headed into the gaping net. Di Maria was then replaced by Lucas, apparently with a minor hamstring complaint, before Paris went back in front two minutes before the interval. Ibrahimovic initially tried to exchange passes with Lucas only for Franck Signorino to block, but the ball came back to the former Barcelona striker and he tucked home. There was still time for the hosts to make it 3-1 in stoppage time at the end of the first period, with Layvin Kurzawa and Ibrahimovic combining to set up Cavani. The Uruguayan had been brought into the starting line-up after coming off the bench to get the winner against Chelsea and his first-time finish past Carrasso was his 16th goal altogether this season. Blanc replaced the tired Marco Verratti with Blaise Matuidi at the start of a second half which was a quieter affair, although PSG got their fourth goal in the 68th minute. Matuidi worked the ball out to Van der Wiel on the right and his cross was converted by Ibrahimovic at the back post, although he was clearly in an offside position when the ball came in. Nice remain third after a 0-0 draw at Bordeaux on Friday but they could be leapfrogged by Saint-Etienne if they win at Marseille on Sunday and by Lyon, who go to Lille."
20,19/02/2016,02:20,Reims out to inflict European hangover on PSG,"Unbeaten runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain return to Ligue 1 duty against struggling Reims on Saturday, four days after earning a narrow first-leg advantage over Chelsea in the Champions League last 16.","Edinson Cavani made an immediate impact as a substitute on Tuesday by netting a 78th-minute winner at the Parc des Princes after John Obi Mikel had cancelled out Zlatan Ibrahimovic's deflected free-kick to hand Laurent Blanc's side a 2-1 edge. The Uruguayan has started just twice in the league in 2016 after losing his place as a regular starter, but Cavani could well return to the line-up with Blanc preparing to rotate his side this weekend. Reims are one of the few teams to frustrate PSG this season, with the capital club needing another late goal from Cavani to rescue a point in a 1-1 draw back in September. ""Even if it's PSG, a big European team, we're not going there as victims. We always want to show what we're capable of doing against the big teams,"" said Reims defender Abdelhamid El Kaoutari. ""I think (the outcome) will depend on what Paris have to offer. If it's the PSG from Tuesday (against Chelsea), there are few teams who can stand up to them,"" added Reims coach Olivier Guegan, whose side enter the weekend two points above the drop zone. Paris on the other hand are unbeaten in 35 league games and cruising towards a fourth straight French title, with a mammoth 24-point gap separating themselves and nearest challengers Monaco, who are at home to bottom side Troyes this weekend. Lyon were in crisis mode less than a month ago, but three convincing wins in a row have propelled Bruno Genesio's side right back into contention for a top-three finish. OL travel to Lille on Sunday with the visitors trailing third-place Nice and bitter rivals Saint-Etienne by just a point in the race for France's final Champions League berth. ""It's the start of a run we have to continue with a couple of difficult matches coming up. We have to keep on working with the same spirit,"" said Genesio in the wake of last weekend's 4-1 demolition of Caen. Lyon will be without influential midfielder Corentin Tolisso for several weeks after he hurt his hamstring in training, but there was a welcome sight as Nabil Fekir, out since September with a knee injury, stepped up his road to recovery in midweek. Saint-Etienne secured a 3-2 victory at home to Basel in the last 32 of the Europa League on Thursday having thrown away a two-goal lead, with Christophe Galtier's men facing a quick turnaround as they head to Marseille this weekend. Early-season surprise packages Angers and Caen will bid to turn around their fading fortunes at home to Montpellier and Rennes respectively, with both sides losers of their last three matches. Toulouse, currently eight points from safety, can ill-afford another defeat as they risk being cut further adrift when they take on 18th-placed Gazelec Ajaccio.

22,02/02/2016,16:03,Gourcuff still not fit to return for Rennes,Injury-plagued former France midfielder Yoann Gourcuff will not return for Rennes' clash with Saint Etienne on Thursday.,"The 29-year-old has only seen 15 minutes of action since joining Rennes from Lyon at the end of last season. Manager Rolland Courbis does not want to risk bringing the former AC Milan and Bordeaux man back too early. ""It's a logical decision to make. Everything is going well, but there was still some doubt (about his fitness) just 24 hours ago,"" Courbis said. ""It would be asking too much to bring him back straight after a 4-0 defeat (at Bordeaux)."" When Gourcuff, who started his career at Rennes, returned to Roazhon Park last year he was struggling with a thigh injury, and he finally made his debut as a substitute against Lorient last month. But he suffered an ankle injury, his 15th injury in just over three years, in an accidental collision with a team-mate in that match and is yet to feature again since. That was to be the only time he played under Philippe Montanier, the coach who signed him, as former Montpellier boss Courbis has now taken over the reins. ""If you listened to him, it was seem obvious that he would play the next day"", Courbis added. ""His enthusiasm is intact and his desire to play is huge. But it will take more than a week or a few days. ""When Yoann returns, likely against Lille or even later against Angers, it will be in a key position and not just as a substitute for the last quarter of an hour, as would be the case for a young debutant."" Rennes currently sit sixth in the Ligue 1 table, just three points off the third and final Champions League spot. Despite Gourcuff's latest setback Courbis is nearing a full-strength squad after the returns to fitness of Mexer and Paul-Georges N'Tep."

It will be the second time they wear the 'Je suis Paris' shirts after Wednesday's Champions League game against Malmo when they strolled into the last 16 with a 5-0 rout of their Group A rivals in Sweden. As well as the lack of away fans, security will be beefed up with spectators required to present identity papers and banned from carrying bags into the grounds with the security perimeter outside the Paris stadium extended. Similar security measures were also planned for Thursday's Europa League clash between Marseille and Dutch side Groningen in the Stade Vélodrome. The French football league (LFP) confirmed Thursday that the subsequent three rounds of Ligue 1 games and the next two rounds of Ligue 2 fixtures will be played without away fans with the ban to be extended to European Champions League and Europa League games playing in France until December 10. The decision was taken because of lack of available police with France in a state of emergency after the attacks, and with the COP21 climate change conference taking place in the French capital from November 30 to December 11. ""Given the current circumstances, the travel ban of supporters will be maintained, because of the rationalisation of security measures, as it is obvious that the police have other things to do now than accompany the fans,"" French Minister of State for Sports Thierry Braillard said. Travelling fans will not be able to attend games until December 18-20, the final weekend before the Christmas break. PSG will be overwhelming favourites to maintain their unbeaten Ligue 1 run against Troyes who by contrast have failed to win a game with just five points after 14 games. Troyes defender Jonathan Martins Pereira admitted the odds were stacked against the side from 150km southeast of Paris, not only because they will be without their fans. But he warned: ""Even if we only have a five-percent chance, we'll give it everything we have to try and pull off a shock. ""We'll go to Parc des Princes to stand up to Paris Saint-Germain. And why? There are so many surprises in football ...

Meanwhile it was just a second reverse of the season for surprise package Reims as their five-match unbeaten run was brought to an end. Lyon, soundly beaten at Bordeaux last weekend, were forced into an early reshuffle on Saturday when Milan Bisevac hobbled off after just six minutes and was replaced by Jordan Ferri. Johny Placide, whose injury-time own goal handed Lyon a 2-1 win in the same fixture last season, made a smart low stop to turn behind a deflected strike from Lacazette midway through the first half. Nicolas de Preville then tested Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes at the other end with a low drive that the Portuguese international pushed away at his near post. The hosts were awarded a penalty on 41 minutes when Jaba Kankava handled inside the area but Reims were handed a reprieve as Lacazette smashed his spot-kick against the crossbar. It was the second time Lacazette had failed to convert from the penalty spot this season following a costly miss in a 1-1 draw at nine-man Gent in the Champions League last month. Last year's Ligue 1 Player of the Year redeemed himself, however, on the stroke of half-time as Lacazette exchanged passes with Claudio Beauvue before firing across Placide to put Lyon in front. The frame of the goal came to Reims' rescue for a second time on 56 minutes with Beauvue sending a thumping header against the bar following a Mathieu Valbuena corner. Placide then made a fine stop to tip over a stinging long-range effort from Lacazette with substitute Grejohn Kyei squandering a glorious chance to level for Reims on 75 minutes after a wonderful ball in from Diego on the left.

26,02/10/2015,02:20,PSG-OM headline act as Lyon seek Reims remedy,Paris Saint-Germain renew their rivalry with bitter foes Marseille at the Parc des Princes on Sunday as Laurent Blanc's men bid to retain their unbeaten start going into the international break.,"PSG have a four-point lead over nearest rivals Saint-Etienne in Ligue 1 and made it two wins from two Champions League group stage matches with a 3-0 triumph away to Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday. ""Our start to the Champions League is perfect but we're still not qualified for the next round,"" PSG captain Thiago Silva told Canal+ after the match in Lviv. ""Now we have to rest up and starting Thursday we'll prepare ourselves for Sunday. Marseille have plenty of qualities, it's always special to play against them."" Wednesday's performance in Ukraine was arguably PSG's most complete display this term, a worrying sign for a Marseille side languishing down in 15th place, 12 points behind their arch rivals. Despite thumping wins over Troyes and Bastia, OM have lost four of eight league matches so far and new boss Michel is still adapting to the French mentality. ""It appears that in French football players preserve themselves so they don't play too many matches in a row, and they choose their matches within reason. This surprises me but I have to get used to it,"" said Michel, in quotes published by French sports daily L'Equipe. ""They tell me that when there are big games coming up, against PSG for example, that this is normal behaviour. I have to accept it but I have trouble understanding it,"" added the former Real Madrid midfielder, who spoke of certain players asking to sit out Thursday's home Europa League clash against Slovan Liberec, which OM lost 1-0. Recent history is not on the Spaniard's side either as PSG have won the last seven meetings between the two clubs, including a 3-2 victory at the Stade Velodrome in April that effectively signalled the end of Marseille's title challenge. Lyon's woes in front of goal persisted in their midweek 1-0 Champions League defeat at home to Valencia as last season's runners-up continue to struggle to overcome a long-term injury to Nabil Fekir. Hubert Fournier's men enter Saturday's showdown with fourth-placed Reims, unbeaten in their last five, already eight points adrift of PSG. ""Winning against Reims would be a good remedy to (Tuesday's) disappointment,"" Fournier, whose side have won just one of six matches since losing Fekir, told the club's website. ""There are more expectations than last season, perhaps too many right now for several reasons. ""Alexandre (Lacazette) is a case in point. He's struggling, just like the rest of the team, to meet people's expectations,"" Fournier said of the reigning Ligue 1 Player of the Year, who has scored just one goal this term and was left out of Didier Deschamps' latest France squad. ""(But) we're just four points from second place, so it's not an irreversible situation,"" added the OL coach. Second-placed Saint-Etienne, who had their five-match winning run emphatically snapped by Nice last weekend, will aim to get back on track at Caen, while third-placed Rennes, coming off three successive draws, go to mid-table Monaco. Free-scoring Nice have racked up 13 goals over the course of a three-match winning streak and will look to continue their ascent at home to Nantes. Promoted Angers, one of four teams five points off the pace, host Bastia, Lorient face Bordeaux, while goal-shy Lille kick off week nine against fellow strugglers Montpellier on Friday."
27,16/08/2015,16:38,Traore on target as Reims bury Marseille,A first-half Hamari Traore goal handed Reims back-to-back wins in a 1-0 victory which condemned struggling Marseille to their second consecutive defeat of the Ligue 1 campaign on Sunday.,"Marseille, still reeling from the shock resignation of coach Marcelo Bielsa following their opening 1-0 defeat to Caen, failed to threaten the Champagne side who won their opening two matches of the season for the first time since returning to the elite four years ago. Reims provisionally take top spot equal on six points with Caen, 1-0 winners on Saturday against Toulouse, and ahead of Sunday's later games when champions Paris Saint-Germain are at home to newly-promoted Corsican minnows Gazelec Ajaccio. Marseille, by contrast, are in the relegation zone along with Guingamp and Montpellier, the two other teams still without a point after two games. Bielsa's assistant Franck Passi was in charge of the visitors but passive and slow Marseille's forward line of Michy Batshuayi, Florian Thauvin, Romain Alessandrini and Lucas Ocampos rarely threatened Reims goalkeeper Kossi Agassa. Although Marseille had looked dangerous early on with winger Alessandrini firing over on 12 minutes, it was Reims who opened the scoring from their first chance two minutes later, Traore volleying low into the net after Benjamin Mendy had headed away a corner. Shaken Marseille paid for their lack of precision and rarely threatened Agassa, while by contrast Reims could have added to their tally but for some fine goalkeeping by OM captain Steve Mandanda. Mandanda, who was making his 300th Ligue 1 appearance, did well to keep out another Traore effort on 29 minutes and David N'Gog's shot on 61. Marseille will be desperate for a win next Sunday at home against newly-promoted Troyes, who came from behind to claim their second consecutive draw with a 3-3 stalemate at home against Nice on Saturday."
28,16/08/2015,14:46,Georgia captain Kankava joins Reims,"Georgian international midfielder Jaba Kankava has signed for Reims for three seasons with an option for a fourth from Ukrainian first division side Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, the French Ligue 1 club confirmed on Sunday.","Georgia captain Kankava, who has scored six goals in 52 games for the national side, was a mainstay for the Ukrainian club, who lost the Europa League final last May to Sevilla. The 29-year-old will help fill the gap at the club from the Champagne region following the departure of Poland international Grzegorz Krychowiak to Sevilla. Kankava was presented to the press just before kickoff of Sunday's Ligue clash at home against Marseille. Reims won their opening match of the season 2-1 at Bordeaux last weekend."
29,09/08/2015,19:24,"Saint-Etienne, Bordeaux lose as Bielsa fallout continues",Bordeaux and Saint-Etienne both suffered Ligue 1 opening day defeats on Sunday as French football was still suffering the shockwaves of Marcelo Bielsa's resignation as Marseille coach.,"At the Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux, Willy Sagnol's men were 10 minutes from victory before Nicolas De Preville cancelled out Wahbi Khazri's 41st minute opener and Theoson Jordan Siebatcheu grabbed a dramatic 88th minute winner for Reims. At Toulouse, Loic Perrin gave Saint-Etienne a 17th minute lead before the home side turned matters around. Martin Braithwaite levelled the match 10 minutes after Perrin's opener before star striker Wissam Ben Yedder put away the winner, eight minutes into the second half. Toulouse finished the match with 10 men when Aleksandar Pesic was shown a straight red card with four minutes left. Meanwhile, Bielsa's shock exit at Marseille after Saturday's opening 1-0 defeat at home to Caen sparked a bitter war of words between the Argentine and his former employers. Former European champions Marseille accused the Argentine of trying to hold them hostage over his new contract. A strongly-worded club statement claimed: ""Marseille possess a sufficiently rich history to refuse to surrender to the rule of one man"". The French giants insisted they wouldn't be ""held prisoner by a man who places his personal interests high above those of the club"". The attack on the man known as 'El Loco' (the mad man) came less than 24 hours after he had delivered what captain Steve Mandanda described as his ""hammer blow"". Bielsa blamed last minute changes to his contract for the decision which left Marseille president Vincent Labrune dumbfounded. ""I am, like all the supporters, dazed by Marcelo Bielsa's shock decision,"" Labrune declared in a statement. ""However, we take note of this decision which places the club in a difficult place having started the new season with a home defeat."" He confirmed that one of Bielsa's assistants, Franck Passi, would step up as caretaker coach pending a permanent replacement. The club and owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus assured fans they would ""take all necessary measures in the coming days to enable Marseille to enjoy a season to the height of its expectations"". Bielsa, who had been in charge since May 2014, wrote in his resignation letter: ""I am sad and frustrated. ""I cannot accept the situation of instability at the club. ""We had reached an agreement on a contract extension for 2016-2017, which was missing just a signature."" Bielsa said he had met Wednesday with the club's chief executive Philippe Perez and Igor Levin, Louis-Dreyfus's lawyer. ""They wanted to change the contract,"" he complained. ""I took this final decision as working together requires a minimum of trust, which we do not have."" Bielsa, who guided Chile to the last 16 at the 2010 World Cup, was at pains to point out his abrupt exit had nothing to do with money, revealing he had turned down a new deal multiplying his salary threefold. And he said he'd been patient with the club, despite uncertainty in the way they had conducted themselves in the close-season transfer market. Champions Paris Saint-Germain opened the Ligue 1 season on Friday with a hard fought 1-0 win at Lille."
30,23/09/2014,20:57,Marseille thrash Reims to soar clear in Ligue 1,High-flying Marseille picked up their fifth straight victory on Tuesday as Ligue 1 top scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac claimed a brace in a 5-0 thrashing of Reims.,"Gignac could even afford the luxury of a missed eighth-minute penalty, before scoring two first-half goals while Ghana international Andre Ayew also struck twice in a one-sided affair at the Stade Auguste Delaune. The win takes Marcelo Bielsa's in-form side three points clear at the top of the French table ahead of a busy Wednesday slate, before Saint-Etienne host Bordeaux on Thursday with both teams currently tied for second. Gignac, who was left out of Didier Deschamps' World Cup team that reached the quarter-finals in Brazil, gave the national coach food for thought as he took his lead-leading tally to eight goals in seven matches. France are preparing to host Euro 2016 and qualify automatically. French-born Ayew, who helped Ghana finish runners-up to Egypt at the 2010 African Championships, put the result beyond doubt seven minutes after half-time, before an audacious back-heeled goal on the hour mark added further gloss. Marseille, who won the last of their nine French titles in 2010 under Deschamps, put the icing on the cake with 16 minutes remaining when Gianelli Imbula celebrated a rare goal much to the delight of the travelling Velodrome faithful. In the only other match in Ligue 1 action on Tuesday, eighth-placed Brittany side Rennes host lower table Toulouse. Defending champions Paris Saint-Germain are now five points adrift, and will be without injured striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic for their trip to Caen on Wednesday, while fourth-placed Lille travel to the Cote d'Azur and a tie against fourth-from-bottom Nice. Montpellier, the 2012 champions under current Lille head coach Rene Girard, host last season's runners-up Monaco, before Thursday's big clash at the Geoffroy-Guichard stadium between Saint-Etienne and Bordeaux."
31,01/09/2014,19:01,N'Gog returns to France after English exile,French striker David N'Gog brought to an end a six year spell in England on Monday by joining Ligue 1 outfit Reims.,"The 25-year-old - who was a free agent after being released by Premier League side Swansea at the end of last season - signed a two year contract with Reims. N'Gog, who came through the Paris Saint Germain youth system, joined Liverpool in 2008 with the former France Under-21 international spending three seasons there scoring nine goals in 63 appearances. However, with the arrivals of Uruguayan star Luis Suarez and England international Andy Carroll in early 2011 he found his opportunities limited and he joined Bolton for £4million ($6.6million, 5million euros) but left them in last January's transfer window for Swansea, where he only played three times."
32,08/08/2014,22:54,Eventful night for Ibra as PSG start with draw,Zlatan Ibrahimovic took centre stage as reigning Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain had to come from behind to claim a 2-2 draw with Reims in the opening game of the new season on Friday.,"The Swede, France's leading scorer and standout performer in each of the last two campaigns, scored one goal, was credited with another, and missed a penalty that he had won in a remarkable encounter at the Stade Auguste-Delaune. After Ibrahimovic opened the scoring, goals from Prince Oniangue and Antoine Devaux had unfancied Reims in front at half-time in Champagne country, but Ibrahimovic saw parity restored in the second period when his cross was palmed across the line by home 'keeper Johny Placide. It was not the ideal start to the season for the capital club, but coach Laurent Blanc had warned that PSG would need time to find their feet with a host of leading players only recently beginning their preparations after taking holidays in the wake of the World Cup. And starting slowly is nothing new for PSG, who have now failed to win their opening match in any of the four seasons since Qatar Sports Investments began their revolution at the club in 2011. ""I thought my team played well. My only reproach is that they didn't kill the game off inside the first 20 minutes,"" Blanc told beIN Sports television. ""We expected it to be difficult and we didn't get the result we wanted but it is encouraging for the future because nobody could have complained had we been 4-0 up early on."" Summer signing David Luiz did not feature in the visitors' squad, while Yohan Cabaye, Blaise Matuidi, Maxwell and Ezequiel Lavezzi were also absent, but Brazil's Thiago Silva surprisingly started, and captained the side, having only come back to Paris earlier this week. On a wet night, Silva was a spectator for much of the opening 20 minutes as Paris threatened to embarrass their hosts. Ibrahimovic, scorer of a brace in last weekend's 2-0 Champions Trophy victory against Guingamp in Beijing, broke the deadlock inside seven minutes with a low finish under Placide after good work by Javier Pastore. The big striker was then furious with Lucas after the Brazilian attempted, unsuccessfully, to dribble round the 'keeper instead of tee up his colleague, who had the goal gaping. But when Marco Verratti laid another chance on a plate for Ibrahimovic moments later, he hit the post rather than roll the ball into an empty net. Reims could not cope with their opponents' attacking quality, but they were again let off the hook on 20 minutes when Ibrahimovic, having won a penalty after going down rather easily under a Mickael Tacalfred challenge, saw his spot-kick saved by Placide. And the hosts, playing their first competitive game since the summer appointment as coach of Jean-Luc Vasseur to replace Lyon-bound Hubert Fournier, soon punished PSG's profligacy. Congolese midfielder Oniangue got the equaliser when he turned in an Aissa Mandi free-kick that had been missed by Gregory Van der Wiel at the near post, and then Devaux slotted in his side's second after running half the length of the pitch and exchanging passes with Gaetan Charbonnier. Vasseur's side could not maintain their advantage after the restart, though, as PSG applied the pressure. It was 2-2 just after the hour mark when Ibrahimovic skipped away from Tacalfred and held up a spinning cross that did for the falling Placide, who could only palm it over his own line and then out again. If there was any doubt, Edinson Cavani made sure by tucking home the rebound, but the goal was credited to Ibrahimovic. PSG could not find a winner however, coming closest when substitute Clement Chantome's stoppage-time attempt was cleared off the line by the alert Mandi."
33,11/04/2014,02:25,Football: PSG hope to seal title after European disaster,"While the thumping hangover following Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League exit in midweek still lingers, the capital club might be able to sooth the pain by securing the Ligue 1 title on Sunday.","Laurent Blanc's expensively-assembled squad were within minutes of the semi-final spot they so badly craved at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge before a late Demba Ba strike took the Londoners through on away goals and plunged PSG into depression. They must now turn their attentions to putting the finishing touches on an almost perfect domestic campaign, and they stand on the brink of a fourth French title as they travel to Lyon on Sunday night. Nearest challengers Monaco sit 13 points adrift in second place with six games to go, and if they lose away to Rennes on Saturday, the path will be clear for PSG to win a second straight championship by beating Lyon at the Stade de Gerland, the same venue where they wrapped up the title last year. The match against Remi Garde's fifth-placed Lyon side will also serve as a rehearsal for the League Cup final between the two teams at the Stade de France on Saturday, April 19. Blanc's reported contract extension past 2015 appeared a formality before the derailment in London but with the club's Qatari owners craving Champions League success, reports this week suggest that he could yet be axed. The coach and his squad have been hit badly by the end of their European adventure and training was cancelled the day after the match as the club got to grips with their defeat. Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani was targeted as one of the players to underperform on the biggest stage and much has been said of their lack of experience needed to win Europe's biggest competition. ""Difficult to accept a result like that,"" Cavani tweeted after the match. ""We now have to concentrate on our other objectives."" They will be facing a Lyon side who were also eliminated from Europe this week, losing 2-1 away to Juventus in the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final tie to bow out 3-1 on aggregate. Monaco coach Claudio Ranieri will be keen to maintain their six-point lead over third-placed Lille while Saint-Etienne in fourth must win at Reims to keep their slim hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League alive. Les Verts faltered badly last week when they were held to a 1-1 home draw by Nice and a five-point deficit to Lille needs to be reduced quickly if they hope to return to the European Cup for the first time since 1981. Lille entertain relegation-threatened Valenciennes in a local derby in Saturday's early match. Meanwhile, Marseille make the short trip to Montpellier on Friday and coach Jose Anigo admitted this week he may have made a mistake in taking the job back in December after coming in for a torrent of abuse last weekend during the 3-1 home win against Ajaccio. Anigo, who will return to his primary role of sporting director in the summer, has endured a difficult time since the murder of his son Adrien back in September. ""There has been a form of disrespect and forgetfulness from the fans, so yes you can ask the question,"" he replied when asked whether he regretted taking the job when Elie Baup was sacked. ""Did I make the right decision to offer my services to the club because I got nothing in return and I didn't make more money? ""I possibly got it wrong but I am curious to see how it's going to finish for me."" Elsewhere, Ajaccio will be relegated on Saturday if they lose at home to Bordeaux.

34,30/03/2014,23:00,Football: Ivorians star for Lille and St. Etienne,Ivory Coast international Salomon Kalou grabbed an injury time winner for Lille in Ligue 1 action on Sunday while his compatriot Max Gradel was the hero in Saint-Etienne's 2-1 derby win at arch rivals Lyon.,"Lille had earlier tightened their grip on third place with a dramatic 1-0 over Guingamp when Kalou came off the bench to prod the ball home in the 92nd minute to snatch three desperately needed points for Rene Girard's side. But in the weekend's final match, Gradel scored with 16 minutes left to keep Saint-Etienne three points behind Lille, and the final Champions League berth, with seven matches left. In a tense Rhone derby at Lyon, Turkish international Mevlut Erding scrambled home a right wing cross in the 28th minute to put Saint-Etienne in front. However Lyon responded 11 minutes later when Bafetimbi Gomis laid on a pinpoint cross from the wing which Alexandre Lacazette skillfully volleyed home to level the match at 1-1. It was the 22-year-old Frenchman's 14th goal of the season, drawing him level with Paris Saint-Germain's Edinson Cavani as the second top scorer in Ligue 1 behind PSG's Swedish talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic who rests on 25. It was then down to Ivory Coast striker Gradel to steal the headlines, as the former Leicester City, Bournemouth and Leeds United player, plucked the winner with a quarter hour to play. Earlier at Lille, the match appeared to be heading for a goalless draw before Kalou popped up inside the six yard box to knee the ball home following a corner from the right that led to a scramble. ""We came out of that one very, very well,"" said a delighted Girard. ""We're still in third so where is the problem? I think that many teams in France would like to be in third place even if we've struggled of late and have been missing efficiency,"" he added. ""We've got some complicated matches coming up so we'll just have to see. I was sorry to see some of the players whistled (by Lille fans) but we're not going to place too much importance on that. It was the public, it was not supporters."" continued Girard. In the only other match on Sunday, Rennes made it back-to-back league wins with a confident 3-0 home success against Bastia that moved them eight points clear of the drop zone. It was the first time this season that the Brittany outfit had picked up three straight victories following their French Cup quarter-final success over Lille on Thursday. They will now play second division Angers for a place in the Stade de France final against either Monaco or Guingamp. ""It's been a beautiful week, with three wins in three matches without conceding a goal,"" said Rennes coach Philippe Montanier. ""It boosts morale after the many difficult weeks. ""It's a week which has put us on the right track. We took another step towards staying in the top flight, and the perspective of a French Cup semi-final has spiced up our season."" The Corsican outfit remain in 10th position. Monaco suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat away to Evian on Saturday to leave PSG well on track for a second straight French title. Laurent Blanc's PSG side warmed up for their Champions League showdown against Chelsea on Wednesday with a 1-0 win over Nice on Friday. Elsewhere on Saturday, Odair Fortes scored to earn Reims a 1-1 draw at home to Lorient, after Vincent Aboubakar netted a first-half penalty, while there were goalless stalemates between Montpellier and Valenciennes and Nantes and Bordeaux. Marseille scored in the dying minutes to salvage a 1-1 draw at relegation-threatened Sochaux while Ajaccio and Toulouse battled to a 2-2 draw in Corsica."

The match appeared to be heading for a goalless draw before Kalou popped up inside the six yard box to knee the ball home following a corner from the right that led to a scramble. The win extends Lille's advantage to six points over fourth placed Saint-Etienne who are involved in the Rhone derby at Lyon in the weekend's final match later on Sunday. Lyon are alone in fifth spot and nine points adrift of Lille and the all important final Champions League berth for next season. Earlier, Rennes made it back-to-back league wins with a confident 3-0 home success against Bastia that moved them eight points clear of the drop zone. It was the first time this season that the Brittany outfit had picked up three straight victories following their French Cup quarter-final success over Lille on Thursday.

""It's a week which has put us on the right track. We took another step towards staying in the top flight, and the perspective of a French Cup semi-final has spiced up our season."" The hosts dominated from the outset with Romain Alessandrini opening the scoring after 14 minutes and Swedish striker Ola Toivonen doubling their advantage on 28 minutes. Cameroonian midfielder Jean Makoun rounded off the scoring after 59 minutes. The victory lifts Rennes up to 12th position and eight points above the relegation zone with seven matches to play. The Corsican outfit remain in 10th position. Monaco suffered a surprise 1-0 defeat away to Evian on Saturday to leave Paris Saint-Germain 13 points clear at the top of the Ligue 1 table with just seven games left. Toulouse missed the opportunity to leapfrog Marseille into the top six as they were held to a 2-2 draw by Ajaccio in Corsica. The visitors had fallen two goals behind as Ricardo Faty and Gadji Tallo netted for Ajaccio, but Issiaga Sylla pulled one back before Clement Chantome, the on-loan PSG midfielder, equalised. But Toulouse missed a great chance to win the game when Jonathan Zebina saw a stoppage-time penalty saved by Guillermo Ochoa in the home goal. Elsewhere on Saturday, Odair Fortes scored to earn Reims a 1-1 draw at home to Lorient, for whom Vincent Aboubakar netted a first-half penalty, while there were goalless stalemates between Montpellier and Valenciennes and Nantes and Bordeaux. On Friday, champions PSG took another step towards retaining their title and warmed up for next Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg at home to Chelsea by winning 1-0 at Nice."
36,08/02/2014,22:23,"Football: Lille snap drought, Marseille boost Euro prospects","Champions League hopefuls Lille snapped a five match winless run on Saturday as they beat lowly Sochaux 2-0, while Marseille helped their European prospects by easing past Bastia 3-0 in Ligue 1.","Eighteen-year-old Divock Origi stabbed home amidst a goalmouth scramble after just three minutes at the Stade Pierre Mauroy before Ryan Mendes added a second goal in second-half stoppage time to strengthen Lille's grip on third place. For Belgian youth international Origi it was his first goal since the opening weekend of the season, while Cape Verde striker Mendes rounded off a clinical counterattack to belatedly get his campaign up and running as Rene Girard's men moved three points clear of Saint-Etienne. Earlier, Marseille gave their European aspirations a timely boost as they cruised to a 3-0 home win over Bastia. Dimitri Payet struck twice in the first half before Andre-Pierre Gignac added his 11th of the campaign after the break to keep Marseille fifth, five points adrift of Lille. With Marseille out of both domestic cup competitions, the league represents the only avenue to European football next term for Jose Anigo's side, who appear to be trending upwards after a third win in five. ""We mastered our subject. We did what we needed to do by scoring very quickly and then killing off the match with the second goal,"" said Gignac afterwards. ""We scored three goals without conceding any, that's the most important thing. ""Since the end of December, we have scored an average of two goals per match. It's good and today we also kept a clean sheet."" Successive victories had seen Bastia looking to break into the top half of the table at the Stade Velodrome but the visitors fell behind on 13 minutes as Payet exchanged passes with Gignac before scuffing a shot that deceived goalkeeper Mickael Landreau. There was little the league's record appearance maker could do about Payet's second though as the winger curled in a sumptuous long-range effort on 25 minutes to take his season's tally to seven. Landreau prevented Marseille from increasing their lead as he turned a Gignac effort round the post before the burly striker headed over from a Benjamin Mendy cross. Wahbi Khazri came close to reducing the deficit two minutes after half-time when he fired against the outside of the post but Bastia's day was to get worse shortly after as Landreau limped off with an ankle injury. His replacement Jean-Louis Leca's first task was to pick the ball out of the net as Gignac netted Marseille's third on 55 minutes, slotting home the rebound after Giannelli Imbula's venomous 25-yard strike cannoned back off the crossbar. Florian Thauvin missed a glorious chance to add his name to the scoresheet just after the hour mark following another Mendy delivery but it mattered little as Marseille strolled to victory. Basement side Ajaccio picked up just their second win of the season after beating Rennes 3-1, while fellow relegation candidates Valenciennes collected three vital points following a 2-1 victory at home to Nice. Elsewhere, Reims came behind to defeat Guingamp 2-1, while Remy Cabella was on target as 10-man Montpellier drew 1-1 with Evian TG. Leaders Paris Saint-Germain travel to title rivals Monaco on Sunday in a top of the table clash at the Stade Louis II, while two of France's most storied clubs, Nantes and Lyon, meet at the Stade de la Beaujoire.

37,05/12/2013,00:03,Football: PSG's long unbeaten run brought to an end,Paris Saint-Germain failed to equal the record for their longest unbeaten run in France's top flight as they suffered a shock 2-0 defeat away to Evian on Wednesday.,"Youngster Clarck Nsikulu put Evian in front at the end of a counterattack with 15 minutes remaining in freezing Annecy, and on-loan Marseille winger Modou Sougou made sure of the win for the home side when he added another in the 87th minute. That goal came just seconds after Javier Pastore had missed a glorious chance to bring the defending champions level, and the result ends PSG's unbeaten record under Laurent Blanc. Indeed, the capital club's sequence of Ligue 1 matches without defeat ends at 26, one short of the club record set in their title-winning 1993-94 campaign. And their overall run without losing in all competitions ends at 36 matches, also one short of the club record. However, that sequence does not include a defeat to Evian on penalties in the quarter-finals of the French Cup last season, and now the club from the shadow of the Alps can claim to be PSG's bogey side. ""This win is marvellous for all our fans, the whole region. I have to congratulate my players,"" said Evian coach Pascal Dupraz, who nevertheless admitted his frustration that his side were unable to produce such performances on a regular basis. Blanc did not dwell long on the run coming to an end. ""We had our chances in the first-half and we can have regrets about the loss because we should have opened the scoring and that could have meant a different result,"" he said. Blanc's side are now just a single point clear of Lille at the top of the table, with the northern side having beaten Marseille 1-0 on Tuesday, with Nolan Roux scoring a stoppage-time winner as Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama kept his 11th consecutive clean sheet. Meanwhile, Monaco are just one point futher behind in third after they won 3-0 away to Nice in a Cote d'Azur derby on Tuesday, achieved without Radamel Falcao, as the Colombian missed a second successive game due to injury. James Rodriguez, Emmanuel Riviere and Lucas Ocampos got the goals for Claudio Ranieri's men, as Nice fell to a sixth straight defeat. Elsewhere on Wednesday, veteran goalkeeper Mickael Landreau broke the record for the most appearances by any player in France's top flight as he started for Bastia in their Corsican derby draw with Ajaccio. French international Landreau played his 603rd Ligue 1 game, three days after equalling the previous record held by former Monaco 'keeper Jean-Luc Ettori, in a game played on neutral ground on the mainland at the Stade Parsemain, home of second-tier club Istres. But Landreau, formerly of Nantes, PSG and Lille, was unable to help Bastia beat their island rivals as the game ended in a 1-1 draw, a late Eduardo strike for Ajaccio cancelling out Florian Raspentino's early opener. ""It is fabulous to experience this and to be able to share it,"" said Landreau after the match. ""The game was played behind closed doors, but I prepare for every match in the same manner. ""I can feel what this represents, and it is massive."" Saint-Etienne missed the chance to reclaim fifth spot as they went down 3-1 away to Rennes in Brittany, with Argentine striker Silvio Romero scoring his first two goals in French football for the hosts. Bordeaux inflicted a first home defeat on Guingamp since the opening day of the season, winning 1-0 thanks to a solitary Julien Faubert strike, while Lorient increased the pressure on beleagured Montpellier coach Jean Fernandez with a 2-0 victory at the Stade de la Mosson. Maxime Barthelme put Lorient ahead before Cameroon international forward Vincent Aboubakar scored his ninth goal of the season from the penalty spot at the death after the home side had been reduced to nine men by the dismissals of Vitorino Hilton and Abdelhamid El-Kaoutari. However, Montpellier's plight is not as serious as that of Sochaux, who remain rooted to the bottom seven points from safety after losing 2-0 at home to Reims."
38,04/12/2013,23:03,Football: PSG's long unbeaten run brought to an end,Paris Saint-Germain failed to equal the record for their longest unbeaten run in France's top flight as they suffered a shock 2-0 defeat away to Evian on Wednesday.,"Youngster Clarck Nsikulu put Evian in front at the end of a counterattack with 15 minutes remaining in freezing Annecy, and on-loan Marseille winger Modou Sougou made sure of the win for the home side when he added another in the 87th minute. That goal came just seconds after Javier Pastore had missed a glorious chance to bring the defending champions level, and the result ends PSG's unbeaten record under Laurent Blanc. Indeed, the capital club's sequence of Ligue 1 matches without defeat ends at 26, one short of the club record set in their title-winning 1993-94 campaign. And their overall run without losing in all competitions ends at 36 matches, also one short of the club record. However, that sequence does not include a defeat to Evian on penalties in the quarter-finals of the French Cup last season, and now the club from the shadow of the Alps can claim to be PSG's bogey side. ""This win is marvellous for all our fans, the whole region. I have to congratulate my players,"" said Evian coach Pascal Dupraz, who nevertheless admitted his frustration that his side were unable to produce such performances on a regular basis. Blanc's side are now just a single point clear of Lille at the top of the table, with the northern side having beaten Marseille 1-0 on Tuesday, with Nolan Roux scoring a stoppage-time winner as Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama kept his 11th consecutive clean sheet. Meanwhile, Monaco are just one point futher behind in third after they won 3-0 away to Nice in a Cote d'Azur derby on Tuesday, achieved without Radamel Falcao, as the Colombian missed a second successive game due to injury. James Rodriguez, Emmanuel Riviere and Lucas Ocampos got the goals for Claudio Ranieri's men, as Nice fell to a sixth straight defeat. Elsewhere on Wednesday, veteran goalkeeper Mickael Landreau broke the record for the most appearances by any player in France's top flight as he started for Bastia in their Corsican derby draw with Ajaccio. French international Landreau played his 603rd Ligue 1 game, three days after equalling the previous record held by former Monaco 'keeper Jean-Luc Ettori, in a game played on neutral ground on the mainland at the Stade Parsemain, home of second-tier club Istres. But Landreau, formerly of Nantes, PSG and Lille, was unable to help Bastia beat their island rivals as the game ended in a 1-1 draw, a late Eduardo strike for Ajaccio cancelling out Florian Raspentino's early opener. ""It is fabulous to experience this and to be able to share it,"" said Landreau after the match. ""The game was played behind closed doors, but I prepare for every match in the same manner. ""I can feel what this represents, and it is massive."" Saint-Etienne missed the chance to reclaim fifth spot as they went down 3-1 away to Rennes in Brittany, with Argentine striker Silvio Romero scoring his first two goals in French football for the hosts. Bordeaux inflicted a first home defeat on Guingamp since the opening day of the season, winning 1-0 thanks to a solitary Julien Faubert strike, while Lorient increased the pressure on beleagured Montpellier coach Jean Fernandez with a 2-0 victory at the Stade de la Mosson.

However, Montpellier's plight is not as serious as that of Sochaux, who remain rooted to the bottom seven points from safety after losing 2-0 at home to Reims. Leaders Paris Saint-Germain travelled to Evian in Wednesday's late kick-off looking to equal the club record for the longest unbeaten run in the top flight of 27 games, set two decades ago. PSG's last defeat of any sort came against Evian in Annecy in April, when they lost on penalties in the quarter-finals of the French Cup. Not including that, however, PSG are 36 games unbeaten in all competitions, one short of the overall club record. Their nearest challengers Lille beat Marseille 1-0 on Tuesday, with Nolan Roux scoring a stoppage-time winner as Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama kept his 11th consecutive clean sheet. Meanwhile, Monaco strengthened their grip on a top-three place thanks to their 3-0 victory away to Nice in a Cote d'Azur derby, achieved without Radamel Falcao, as the Colombian missed a second successive game due to injury. James Rodriguez, Emmanuel Riviere and Lucas Ocampos got the goals for Claudio Ranieri's men, as Nice fell to a sixth straight defeat. The midweek round of games concludes on Thursday when mid-table duo Lyon and Toulouse meet at the Stade de Gerland."
40,29/09/2013,23:17,Football: Monaco go top despite being held at Reims,Monaco moved back to the summit of Ligue 1 on Sunday despite being held to a 1-1 at Reims as the momentum swung again at the top in France.,"After Antoine Devaux had given the Champagne-region outfit a shock fourth-minute lead with a close range header, Portuguese international Joao Moutinho opened his season's scoring account with a brilliant free-kick that flew inside the near post nine minutes later. Up until Sunday, Colombian Radamel Falcao and Frenchman Emmanuelle Riviere had scored all of Monaco's goals in the league. Reims almost snatched a shock winner in the 86th minute but Togo international Floyd Ayite was denied by Monaco's Croatian 'keeper Danijel Subasic despite being clear on goal. In a feisty finale, Reims had Atlia Turan sent off for a second bookable offence with two minutes left, but Monaco were unable to capitalise. Claudio Ranieri's men however, have seen their two-point cushion at the top slashed to goal difference over Paris Saint-Germain who defeated Toulouse 2-0 on Saturday, as both clubs ended the weekend's action with identical records of five victories and three draws. ""We gave up a stupid goal early in the match and it's the second time we've started badly,"" explained Monaco captain Eric Abidal. ""It was important to be collective and efficient and we didn't do that. Reims played well and tryed to catch us on the counter but we just weren't clinical in front of goal. ""Even when they were down to ten men, they still created chances."" Marseille are in third on 17 points with Lille and Nice in fourth and fifth respectively, just ahead of Nantes and Saint-Etienne. Promoted Nantes continued their fine start to the campaign earlier on Sunday with a display reminiscent of the style that made them eight-time champions as they defeated Rennes 3-1. The afternoon kick-off at Rennes's Stade de la Route de l'Orient produced a feisty derby that was eventually taken over by the 'Canaries' thanks to strikes from Filip Djordjevic, Serge Gakpe and an injury time clincher from Lucas Deaux. ""We had a very good first half and produced good play and created good chances,"" said their 50-year-old Armenian-Franco coach Michel Der Zakarian. ""We should have been 3-0 up at half-time because we should have had a clear penalty and after we had a black spell at the start of the second half."" His slick passing formation outwitted their hosts in midfield and which led to Djordjevic's headed opener after just 17 minutes. In front of a crowd of some 25,000, Rennes, who suffered only their second league defeat, pushed forward in search of an equaliser only to slip further behind with a brilliant Nantes second on the stroke of half-time. Togo international Gakpe, cut into the box before turning two defenders inside out and then hooking a low shot around Rennes 'keeper Benoit Costil and into the far corner. Nelson Oliveira then broke through for Rennes on 55 minutes after the ball pin-balled into his path and he made no mistake with his one-on-one duel against Nantes number one Remy Riou to pull it back to 2-1. Der Zakarian's men then had to endure a nerve shredding finale before Lucas Deaux finished off a counter-attack deep into injury time to make the scoreline 3-1. Fabrizio Ravanelli's Ajaccio side followed their first win of the season against Lyon in midweek with a hard earned 1-1 draw at home to 2012 champions Montpellier. The Corsican side went behind when Ajaccio-born midfielder Remy Cabella converted a ninth minute penalty before grabbing a share of the points with Ronald Zubar's header 10 minutes before the break."
41,25/08/2013,23:34,Football: Lavezzi grabs winner as PSG edge past Nantes,"Paris Saint-Germain recorded their first win of the French Ligue 1 season on Sunday, beating promoted Nantes 2-1 at the Stade de la Beaujoire.","When Edinson Cavani gave PSG a 24th-minute lead, it looked set to be a long night for their hosts, but they held on and equalised eight minutes into the second half when a Jordan Veretout free-kick was turned into his own net by Alex at the back post. However, Ezequiel Lavezzi got what proved to be the winner in the 74th minute, firing home the loose ball after a Lucas effort had been blocked on the line by Gabriel Cichero. With his choice of a 4-4-2 formation coming in for some criticism after the defending champions were held by Montpellier and then Ajaccio in their opening two games, PSG coach Laurent Blanc opted for a three-man attack here, with Lavezzi brought back in alongside Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. ""We could go back to the 4-4-2 but also (try out) other systems. We need to find a system which gives us balance,"" said Blanc. ""We have an attacking potential that many other clubs envy but we mustn't forget that to win a match we have to defend well."" Even against a five-man Nantes defence, PSG threatened to run riot in the early stages, with home goalkeeper Remy Riou racing off his line to deny Ibrahimovic before Cavani's first-time half-volley flashed just wide midway through the first half. Shortly after, Ibrahimovic and Cavani combined for the opening goal, with the latter racing on to the Swede's pass before firing low past Riou. Yet the visitors could not build on that and only a fine Salvatore Sirigu save prevented Cichero from equalising for Nantes from an overhead kick just before the break. The hosts did draw level soon after the restart when the unfortunate Alex, under pressure from Papy Djilobodji, saw a Jordan Veretout free-kick rebound off him and into the net at the back post. Sirigu then had to save well to keep out a net-bound Alejandro Bedoya header, but PSG silenced the 37,000 crowd when Lavezzi scored what proved to be the winner. Earlier on an attritional weekend in France's top flight, Nice were held to a goalless draw by Ajaccio in Corsica, while Saint-Etienne dropped their first points of the league campaign, going down 1-0 away to a young Lille side. Salomon Kalou scored the only goal from the penalty spot to deny Les Verts the chance to move level at the top of the table with leaders Marseille. ""Saint-Etienne are a team who often pose us problems,"" acknowledged Kalou, mindful that it was they who pipped Lille to a European place at the end of last season, having also knocked them out of both domestic cup competitions. Marseille end the weekend two points clear of Monaco at the summit after maintaining their perfect start to the season with a hard-fought 1-0 win at Valenciennes, Andre-Pierre Gignac netting a late winner. Monaco drew 0-0 at home to Toulouse on Friday in a game played behind closed doors at the Stade Louis II as a punishment for crowd trouble at the end of last season. Claudio Ranieri's side now travel to face Marseille in a top-of-the-table clash at the Stade Velodrome next Sunday. In contrast to Marseille, Lyon's perfect start to the campaign was ended in a 1-0 home defeat to Reims, as Odair Fortes's deflected effort gave the visitors the points after Clement Grenier had missed a penalty for the hosts in a second half delayed for 35 minutes because of torrential rain at the Stade de Gerland. That result came four days after Lyon's chances of making the Champions League group stage were severely compromised by a 2-0 home defeat to Real Sociedad in the first leg of their play-off."
