0,13/02/2021,17:38,Haaland spares Dortmund blushes,A late equaliser from Erling Braut Haaland spared Borussia Dortmund's blushes on Saturday as they drew 2-2 at home against Bundesliga rivals Hoffenheim.,"Haaland's 81st minute strike averted a fourth defeat in five Bundesliga games for crisis-hit Dortmund. Yet even a draw leaves Dortmund three points adrift of the Champions League places in sixth, and heaps more pressure on interim coach Edin Terzic. Dortmund have won just four of ten league games since Terzic took the reins from Lucien Favre in December, prompting growing speculation over his future. Yet veteran defender Mats Hummels defended his coach on Saturday and backed Dortmund to revive their season. ""It's never the case that things are exactly how you want them a few weeks after a new coach takes over. That wasn't the case years ago under Jurgen Klopp, and it isn't the case now under Edin,"" Hummels told Sky. ""We're working hard, and success will come,"" he added. England international Jadon Sancho gave Dortmund a perfect start, racing up the left-wing to score his fourth league goal this season on 24 minutes. The lead didn't last long, as Munas Dabbur scuffed a shot past Marwin Hitz to level just seven minutes later. Ihlas Bebou bundled in Hoffenheim's second just after half-time, the ball bouncing off the Togolese and into the goal as Hitz tried to beat away a dangerous cross from the left wing. Haaland had a goal ruled out for offside in the second half before pouncing on a misplaced pass to snatch a crucial late equaliser. Fellow Champions League hopefuls Bayer Leverkusen also dropped points after they conceded two late goals to draw 2-2 with strugglers Mainz. Lucas Alario tapped in a low Moussa Diaby cross to give Leverkusen the lead on 14 minutes. Patrik Schick appeared to have sealed three points with a second on 84 minutes. Yet second-from-bottom Mainz were rewarded for a brave performance as late goals by Robert Glatzel and Kevin Stoeger saved a point and continued their recent revival under new coach Bo Svensson. Elsewhere, Werder Bremen were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Freiburg while Sami Khedira helped rescue a 1-1 draw for Hertha Berlin against boyhood club Stuttgart. ""It was the first time I'd ever played against Stuttgart so it was strange, but it was nice to come back,"" Khedira, who joined Hertha from Juventus in January after a decade abroad, told Sky. Austrian striker Sasa Kalajdzic headed in his ninth goal of the season to give Stuttgart the lead at the end of a scrappy first half. Veteran midfielder Khedira came off the bench in the second-half and set up a late equaliser for 17-year-old Luca Netz to save the capital club from a fifth straight defeat."
1,07/02/2021,22:26,Leipzig face in-form Wolfsburg in Cup quarters,"RB Leipzig will face Wolfsburg in the quarter-finals of the German Cup after Sunday's draw, while Borussia Moenchengladbach will host Borussia Dortmund in the other all-Bundesliga tie.","Leipzig are second in Germany's top division while Wolfsburg are third and on a run of five straight wins in league and cup. The other top flight side left in the competition, Werder Bremen, will travel to second-tier Jahn Regensburg as clubs eye a cup that looks much more winnable with Bayern Munich out of the way. Bayern's conquerers at the last-32 stage Holstein Kiel have been rewarded for their penalty shootout win over Darmstadt in the last 16 with a trip to Rot-Weiss Essen, who play in the fourth division. Essen will likely be no pushover however after having knocked out Bayer Leverkusen, Arminia Bielefeld and second division team Fortuna Duesseldorf in previous rounds. Quarter-final draw, matches to be played March 2 and 3: RB Leipzig v Wolfsburg Borussia Moenchengladbach v Borussia Dortmund Jahn Regensburg v Werder Bremen Rot-Weiss Essen v Holstein Kiel"
2,24/01/2021,13:58,Hertha Berlin sack both coach Labbadia and general manager Preetz,Bundesliga strugglers Hertha Berlin on Sunday sacked both coach Bruno Labbadia and general manager Michael Preetz in a shake up following their 4-1 thrashing at home by Werder Bremen.,"Saturday's heavy defeat leaves Hertha two points from the relegation places in the league table, which the club's CEO Carsten Schmidt described as ""a very precarious situation"". ""After much deliberation, we feel that a change of head coach can give the team fresh impetus,"" Schmidt added in a statement. Labbadia, 54, took charge in April 2020 and kept Hertha in Germany's top flight last season, but the team has taken just one point from four games in 2021. He is replaced by caretaker coach Pal Dardai, who was in charge of the first team from 2015 until 2019 before being moved to the club's youth academy. Schmidt said Hertha expects to name a permanent head coach ""in the coming days"". Preetz, 53, was shown the door after 25 years with Hertha, first as a player, then eventually becoming general manager in 2009. He has been axed for failing to move Hertha forward despite the spending of around 100 million euros ($122 million) in transfers last season, funded by the club's wealthy backer Lars Windhorst. Sports director and former Germany defender Arne Friedrich will take over Preetz's responsibilities until the end of the season. Hertha face a tough run of fixtures next month with Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig, who are currently second, both visiting Berlin's Olympic Stadium in February."
3,02/01/2021,23:20,Olmo fires RB Leipzig top of Bundesliga ahead of Bayern Munich,RB Leipzig dislodged Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table Saturday as Dani Olmo's second-half goal was enough to seal a 1-0 win at Stuttgart.,"""It was really good for me and the team to start the year with a win,"" Olmo told DAZN. With European champions Bayern at home to strugglers Mainz on Sunday, Leipzig took the chance to go a point ahead as Olmo fired through the legs of Stuttgart goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Stuttgart's Swiss shot-stopper had earlier pulled off some heroics by using his foot to save a Emil Forsberg first-half penalty attempt. Leipzig also wasted a golden chance when Amadou Haidara fired wide just after the break. With 23 minutes left, Spain midfielder Olmo finally got the breakthrough, finishing a move he started after Leipzig had moved the ball across the Stuttgart penalty area. ""It feels good to be top,"" admitted Leipzig defender Willi Orban. ""The first half was good, the second was better - we were clearly the dominant team."" Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen blew the chance to take first place after stumbling to a 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt which saw them drop to third as the league resumed after a two-week break. ""I have made my feelings clear in the dressing room,"" Leverkusen head coach Peter Bosz told Sky. ""We deserved to lose. Frankfurt had a better claim to the victory."" Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri scored with a deft back-heel flick to give the visitors the lead after only 10 minutes in Frankfurt. However, Amin Younes equalised to make it 1-1 at half-time before Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada put in a cross which Leverkusen defender Edmond Tapsoba turned into his own net. Before kickoff, Frankfurt director Fredi Bobic confirmed reports his club are interested in Bayern's teenage striker Joshua Zirkzee, 19, after selling Dutch forward Bas Dost to Brugge. Zirkzee could back up Frankfurt's top scorer Andre Silva, who has notched nine league goals this season. Union Berlin rose to fourth - into the Champions League places for the first time in the club's history - after their 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi, who has scored in his last three league games, capped another impressive display with a goal and assist. After Bremen lost the ball in their own half, the 23-year-old Nigeria international took advantage of a two-on-two situation by drawing the defence and passing to Sheraldo Becker, who fired home on 12 minutes. Awoniyi doubled Union's lead on 28 minutes by tapping the ball over the line, just out of the reach of Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka. Bremen had a penalty appeal turned down when a shot by Japan midfielder Yuya Osako clipped the hand of a Union defender, then Romano Schmid had a goal ruled offside. Hoffenheim lost both defender Kevin Akpoguma and Germany midfielder Sebastian Rudy with early leg injuries as they crashed to a 3-1 home defeat to Freiburg. With the hosts struggling to reshuffle, Freiburg were 3-0 up at half-time thanks to a Baptiste Santamaria goal, a Vincenzo Grifo penalty and an own goal by Senegal defender Kasim Adams. Hoffenheim scored a second-half consolation goal through Togo winger Ihlas Bebou. Borussia Moenchengeladbach, who host Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 next month, earned their first win in five league games with a 1-0 victory at Arminia Bielefeld. Swiss striker Breel Embolo netted the winning goal just after half-time when he held off a defender and fired home. Mid-table Augsburg rebounded after back-to-back defeats with a 1-0 win at Cologne with Brazilian winger Iago netting the late winner. Bottom side Schalke are now 30 games without a win -- one short of the Bundesliga record -- after a 3-0 defeat away to Hertha Berlin. Former Tottenham manager Christian Gross, installed as Schalke's fourth head coach this season, got off to a losing start as Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi, Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba and his replacement, Poland forward Krzysztof Piatek, scored for Hertha. Having netted two minutes after coming off the bench, Piatek had a second late goal ruled offside."
4,14/12/2020,03:30,Dortmund out to reverse slump after Favre dismissal,"New Borussia Dortmund boss Edin Terzic will make his debut in the dugout when his team travel to Werder Bremen on Tuesday, with the crisis-hit Bundesliga giants looking to pick up their first win in four league games.","After former coach Lucien Favre was sacked on Sunday, Dortmund are looking to bounce back from a humiliating 5-1 defeat to Stuttgart which saw them drop out of the top four and cost the Swiss coach his job. Former Favre assistant Terzic will now take the reins as interim boss until the end of the season, starting with the trip to Bremen. Dortmund have not lost a league game in Bremen since 2014, yet they travel north with just one point from their last three matches and several players out injured including Belgians Thomas Meunier and Thorgan Hazard and star striker Erling Braut Haaland. Terzic is charged with leading Dortmund back into the top four after recent results saw them fall behind the leading pack of Bayer Leverkusen, Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig. ""We can't afford another performance like that,"" said captain Marco Reus after the defeat to Stuttgart. ""We need to make a statement in Bremen."" Leaders Leverkusen, who leapfrogged Bayern with a 4-1 win over Hoffenheim to go top for the first time in six years on Sunday, face local rivals Cologne on Wednesday. Peter Bosz's side have now won three games in a row and are unbeaten this season, but the Dutch coach warned against complacency on Sunday. ""We're top after 11 games. If we are top after 34 games then I will be delighted, but we're not there yet,"" said Bosz. Bayern, who sit just a point behind Leverkusen in second, host the league's only other unbeaten side Wolfsburg on Wednesday. The injury-plagued champions may be without Leon Goretzka, who hobbled off the pitch during a 1-1 draw with Union Berlin on Saturday, but are hoping that defender Niklas Suele will return to the fold. ""Niklas had a painful blow to his thigh, but we are hoping he will be back in action on Wednesday,"" said coach Hansi Flick after Suele missed Saturday's game. Wednesday's game could see Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski, the league's top goalscorer so far this season, chalk up his 250th career goal in the Bundesliga. The Polish star has 249 goals in 331 Bundesliga appearances for Bayern and Dortmund, and is fast approaching the all-time league record of 268 goals held by former Schalke striker Klaus Fischer. The Jamaica winger is in blistering form this season and fired Bayer Leverkusen to the top of the table with two goals in a 4-1 win over Hoffenheim on Sunday. Bailey opened the scoring with a scintillating strike against Hoffenheim before adding another later on to take his season tally to nine goals and six assists in all competitions. The 23-year-old also picked up an assist the last time Leverkusen met Cologne, setting up Sven Bender's opener in a 3-1 win back in June. 249 - Bundesliga goals Robert Lewandowski has scored in 331 appearances for Bayern and Dortmund. The Polish striker would become only the third Bundesliga player to reach the 250 mark if he scores against Wolfsburg. 27 - Games Schalke have now played since their last league win back in January. The league's bottom side are now just four games away from equalling the longest winless streak in Bundesliga history. 4 - Goals Congolese striker Silas Wamangituka has scored in his last two games for seventh-placed Stuttgart, who take on fellow high-fliers Union Berlin on Tuesday."
5,12/12/2020,17:38,Leipzig top Bundesliga as Dortmund crash to heavy home defeat,"Fresh from knocking Manchester United out of the Champions League in midweek, RB Leipzig saw off Werder Bremen 2-0 on Saturday to leapfrog Bayern Munich into top spot in the Bundesliga table.","Leipzig captain Marcel Sabitzer converted a penalty and Dani Olmo, who shone in the attacking midfield role, grabbed a first-half goal for the hosts. The victory left Leipzig a point clear of defending champions Bayern, who can regain first place at FC Union later on Saturday in Berlin. The home win capped a good week for Leipzig, who knocked United out of Europe on Tuesday with a 3-2 victory to reach the last 16 of the Champions League. Borussia Dortmund, also through to the knock-out stages in Europe, lost ground in the title race, dropping to fifth, after crashing 5-1 at home to Stuttgart, whose winger Silas Wamangituka netted twice."
6,06/12/2020,17:59,'Disrespectful' Wamangituka fires Stuttgart past Bremen,"Congolese striker Silas Wamangituka scored twice to give Stuttgart a 2-1 away win over Werder Bremen on Sunday, in a cagey encounter between two of the Bundesliga's struggling giants.","After scoring from the spot in the first half, Wamangituka prompted a furious reaction from the Bremen players when he provocatively walked the ball into the open goal to seal the win in stoppage time. ""The way he finished was obviously disrespectful. He had a very good game and he should just tap the ball in, and not make a song and dance about it,"" Bremen's Davie Selke told Sky. It was a first win in six games for promoted side Stuttgart, who have nonetheless started strongly upon their return to the Bundesliga under American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo. Matarazzo's side now sit eighth in the table, having picked up 14 points from their first 10 games. Wamangituka gave Stuttgart the lead just after the half-hour mark, smashing the ball in from 12 yards after Manchester United loanee Tahith Chong fouled Wataru Endo in the box. The visitors held Bremen at bay for much of the second half, and had several chances to double their lead on the counter-attack. Wamangituka finally sealed the victory in stoppage time after pouncing on a mistake by goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka. Yet he was booked for unsportsmanlike conduct after taking his time to put the ball in the open net. Selke nodded in a consolation goal before the final whistle, but it was too little, too late for the home side. Bremen have not won since the first week of October, and have now dropped to 12th after a promising start to the season. Having avoided relegation by the skin of their teeth last season, the four-time Bundesliga winners are hoping to avoid being dragged into another fight for survival this season."
7,21/11/2020,23:11,Haaland scores four as Dortmund cut Bayern's lead,Erling Braut Haaland netted four goals and Youssoufa Moukoko became the youngest player in Bundesliga history on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund routed Hertha Berlin 5-2 to trim Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the table to just a point.,"It was the first time the 20-year-old Haaland had scored four goals in a game for Dortmund since his January debut, with all of them coming in the second half. ""I drank a Red Bull at half time, I got some wings and everything was good,"" said Haaland. The Norwegian now has 10 goals in seven Bundesliga matches this season to give him a total of 31 goals in 30 games in all competitions for Dortmund. After Matheus Cunha gave Hertha a first-half lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, Dortmund roared back. Haaland equalised when he tapped home an Emre Can pass on 47 minutes. He grabbed his second two minutes later with perfect timing to slip his marker and fire in a Julian Brandt pass. Haaland wrapped up his hat-trick on 62 minutes, just before Raphael Guerreiro stabbed the ball home from close range to make it 4-1. Cunha converted a late penalty, but the night belonged to Haaland who finished a move he started with 10 minutes to play. There was still time for history to be made as Moukoko made a late cameo off the Dortmund bench to replace Haaland. One day after his 16th birthday, Moukoko is the youngest player in Bundesliga history. ""He's only just turned 16 -- that is amazing,"" Haaland said of Moukoko. ""He has a big career ahead of him."" Dortmund's romp in Berlin moved them second in the standings, behind defending champions Bayern who stayed top despite a 1-1 home draw with Werder Bremen. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer produced great stops to twice deny US forward Josh Sargent as Bremen earned their first point at Bayern for a decade. ""We had to invest a lot,"" Neuer told Sky. The 34-year-old bounced back after conceding six goals in Germany's crushing defeat by Spain in midweek with two brilliant first-half saves in quick succession. He used a boot to block a Sargent shot, then lunged across goal to save from Ludwig Augustinsson. In the dying stages, Neuer then stood tall to block a shot by Sargent, who had broken clear. Bayern coach Hansi Flick was far from pleased that Bremen took the lead in his 50th game in charge, saying his team ""have to defend better"". Bremen deservedly went ahead just before half-time when midfielder Maximilian Eggestein finished off a superb attack. ""We conceded a very cheap goal, that's how Bremen's plan worked and they defended very well,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. Kingsley Coman equalised in the 62nd minute at the Allianz Arena by meeting a Leon Goretzka cross at the far post. Bayern forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting fired over with the goal at his mercy five minutes from time. However, Neuer's heroics at the other end preserved the draw. Bayer Leverkusen are third after their 2-1 win at strugglers Arminia Bielefeld thanks to Aleksandar Dragovic's late winner. The victory was a relief for Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, who scored a embarrassing own goal early in the second half. Leverkusen were 1-0 up thanks to a Leon Bailey goal when Hradecky sliced a clearance, which rolled into the empty net behind him. Dragovic stabbed home from close range two minutes from time to spare Hradecky's blushes. RB Leipzig sit fourth after Yussuf Poulsen came off the bench and produced a deft second-half volley in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt after winger Aymen Barkok gave the hosts an early lead. Despite having seven players quarantined with the coronavirus, a depleted Hoffenheim drew 3-3 at home with Stuttgart. Schalke's winless run stretched to 24 league games, dating back to January, after losing 2-0 at home to Wolfsburg. A Daniel Caligiuri equaliser two minutes from time gave 10-man Augsburg a 1-1 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach."
8,20/11/2020,03:10,"Huge tests for Real, Barca, a milestone for Flick - what to watch in Europe this weekend","Real Madrid and Barcelona's stuttering starts to the season could continue, while AC Milan's unbeaten record in Serie A is in danger and Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick is aiming to continue his astonishing record.","AFP Sport previews the standout football action on the continent this weekend: Monaco v Paris Saint-Germain, Friday 2000 GMT PSG are five points clear at the top of Ligue 1 and chasing a ninth straight win when they face Monaco, the only other club to have won the title in the past eight seasons. Paris have won 4-1 and 4-0 on their last two visits to the principality but they might find things harder this time, not least because coach Thomas Tuchel is without a host of injured players, while Neymar is a doubt. The game has a German accent to it, with Monaco looking to return to the upper echelons of the French game under new Croatian coach Niko Kovac, who was born and raised in Germany. Ex-Borussia Dortmund boss Tuchel has been full of praise ahead of the game for Kovac, who he came up against when the latter was at Eintracht Frankfurt. Kovac is looking to relaunch his career after being sacked by Bayern Munich. Bayern Munich v Werder Bremen, Saturday 1430 GMT Kovac was replaced in the dugout in Bavaria by Hansi Flick, who went on to win the Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup treble last season and has added the UEFA and German Super Cups this season. On Saturday Flick takes charge of Bayern for the 50th time when they host Werder Bremen. Flick's record is astonishing. He has overseen 45 wins, one draw and just three defeats, with Bayern averaging 3.3 goals a game in the Bundesliga. Bayern sealed the title with a 1-0 win in Bremen in June. Werder only just stayed up last season and lost 6-1 on their last trip to Munich. A similar outcome is quite possible this time. Villarreal v Real Madrid, Saturday 1515 GMT Zinedine Zidane's Real have had two weeks to stew on a 4-1 hammering at Valencia and could find the going tough again this weekend when they make another trip to Spain's east coast to play Villarreal. Unai Emery's side are undefeated in six La Liga games and are second in the table, two points behind leaders Real Sociedad and two above Real, who have a game in hand. While Madrid are without talisman Sergio Ramos after he suffered a hamstring injury playing for Spain, Villarreal have two of Spain's most in-form strikers in Paco Alcacer and Gerard Moreno. The latter has four league goals this season and scored a late equaliser for Spain against Switzerland in the Nations League last weekend, while Alcacer has nine in total. They could make life very difficult for the champions. Atletico Madrid v Barcelona, Saturday 2000 GMT Barcelona claimed a first win in five La Liga games last time out when they thumped Real Betis 5-2, but they are currently eighth in the table, nine points behind Real Sociedad with two matches in hand. On Saturday they visit Atletico, who are six points above Ronald Koeman's side and on a club-record unbeaten run of 23 league matches. Luis Suarez's absence against his former side after a positive coronavirus test is a great shame, as will be the lack of fans, but this match still pits Lionel Messi against Joao Felix, and there is the return of Antoine Griezmann to face his old team. Napoli v AC Milan, Sunday 1945 GMT Milan's revival is real, as they spent the international break on top of Serie A, unbeaten and two points ahead of Sassuolo in second. A huge test awaits, however, as they go to Napoli, who are three points off the lead in third. Napoli have lost their last two home games but look like contenders for a top-four finish this season and the prospect of coach Gennaro Gattuso getting one over the club he served with such distinction as a player is a fascinating one."
9,20/11/2020,03:05,Flick seeking Kimmich replacement for Bayern half century,Hansi Flick needs to settle on a replacement for Bayern Munich's injured midfield dynamo Joshua Kimmich ahead of his 50th game as head coach on Saturday.,"The 25-year-old Kimmich is recovering from knee surgery after limping off in the 3-2 win at Dortmund a fortnight ago which kept Bayern top of the Bundesliga. Bayern boss Flick was ""relieved"" that Kimmich should be able to return in January, but in the meantime must find a midfield replacement for Saturday's match at Werder Bremen. Veteran Javi Martinez, 32, is the prime candidate as Corentin Tolisso returned from France duty carrying a knock. Having taken over when Niko Kovac was sacked last November, Flick steered Bayern to the Champions League title last season as part of the treble. The 55-year-old has the best record of any Bayern coach going into his 50th match in all competitions. Under Flick, Bayern have won five titles by also lifting the Bundesliga, German Cup, UEFA Super Cup and German Super Cup as well as the Champions League. They can add a sixth title in February at the FIFA Club World Cup in Doha. His record of 45 wins, one draw and three defeats puts Flick ahead of former top Bayern coaches Pep Guardiola and Jupp Heynckes, who steered them to the 2013 treble. Mid-table Bremen are unbeaten in their last six league games since losing to Hertha Berlin on the opening day of the season, but Bayern have won their last 19 league games against Bremen dating back to 2010. Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski has scored 19 times against Bremen and three more would see him reach the landmark of 250 Bundesliga goals. Having climbed to second with a 3-0 win over Freiburg a fortnight ago, RB Leipzig are chasing a first win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. In their four seasons in Germany's top flight, Leipzig have never won at Frankfurt, a statistic the visitor's coach Julian Nagelsmann wants to fix. ""Leipzig have never played well there. We're missing a win. It's time to change that,"" Nagelsmann said Thursday. He praised the performance of Leipzig's attacking midfielder Dani Olmo who was ""the best player on the pitch"" in Spain's 6-0 trashing of Germany on Tuesday. Bundesliga history could be made at Hertha Berlin on Saturday if Moukoko, who turns 16 on Friday, makes his league debut for Borussia Dortmund. The teen has scored a mind-blowing 47 goals in 25 matches for Dortmund U19s over two seasons and has been training with the first team. Dortmund have hinted he might play at Berlin's Olympic Stadium and therefore become the youngest player in the league's history. Hertha coach Bruno Labbadia says Moukoko's goal-scoring feats in German youth football proves he is good enough to potentially make his senior bow. ""He knows where the goal is, so his age is absolutely irrelevant,"" Labbadia said Thursday. ""Whether you are 16 or 35 -- if you can score goals, then there is a place for you."" 27 - wins Hansi Flick has enjoyed in his first 31 German league games as Bayern head coach. 21 - the games Thomas Mueller has played for Bayern against Bremen and never lost. 13 - the goals Moukoko has scored in just four games this season for Dortmund Under-19s. Fixtures (all times 1430 GMT unless stated)"
10,22/10/2020,13:43,Werder cancel training after player tests positive for coronavirus,"Werder Bremen announced on Thursday they had cancelled training after an unnamed squad member tested positive for coronavirus, disrupting preparations for this weekend's league game against Hoffenheim.","The player concerned, who has been place in home quarantine, is ""doing well and has no symptoms,"" Werder said in a statement. Werder's first-team squad and Florian Kohfeldt's coaching staff are in individual voluntary isolation before the club's next round of testing for Covid-19 on Friday. There are concerns whether Werder will be able to host Hoffenheim on Sunday (1700 GMT) behind closed doors in the Bundesliga. The local health authority in Bremen has also said two of the Werder squad - an unnamed staff member and player - must also go into a 14-day quarantine despite both returning negative tests. Werder are the latest German top-flight side to reveal positive tests for Covid-19 after Bayern Munich's Germany winger Serge Gnabry was sidelined by the virus Tuesday. Germany reported a jump in Covid-19 figures on Thursday with 11,287 new cases in the past 24 hours -- a large increase from the previous record of 7,830 last Friday."
11,05/10/2020,18:10,Bremen sell ex-Everton midfielder Klaassen back to Ajax,Bundesliga side Werder Bremen confirmed Monday that Netherlands playmaker Davy Klaassen is returning to Dutch giants Ajax.,"Ajax will pay Bremen 11 million euros ($13 million), which could rise to 14 million euros with bonuses, for Klaassen who came through the Dutch giants' academy. ""It was clear to us that we would not let Davy go at any price, but only if our expectations were met, especially since he was one of our top performers,"" said Bremen director Frank Baumann. ""That has happened and we were able to fulfil Davy's wish to switch to Ajax, because he sees his sporting home as being there."" The 27-year-old joined Bremen from Everton in 2018 as the German club's record transfer at a cost of around 13.5 million euros. He has scored 16 goals, created 13 more in 81 appearances for the north German side and captained the team to Saturday's 1-0 win over Arminia Bielefeld. He made his professional debut for Ajax in 2011, winning three Dutch league titles and making 180 appearances and scoring 55 goals before joining Everton in 2017. He has played 16 times for his national team, although his last appearance for the 'Oranje' was back in 2017."
12,03/10/2020,17:58,Haaland nets twice as Dortmund run riot,Erling Braut Haaland again demonstrated his deadly finishing by netting twice on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund climbed to second in the Bundesliga table with a 4-0 demolition of Freiburg.,"Dortmund bounced back from last weekend's shock defeat at Augsburg as Haaland shone to leave him on 21 goals in 23 games for Dortmund since his January transfer as the burly Norwegian claimed clinically-taken goals. Having also scored in Wednesday's German Super Cup 3-2 defeat at Bayern Munich, the 20-year-old Haaland has netted five goals in as many games this season. Dortmund were missing England winger Jadon Sancho and goalkeeper Roman Buerki, both recovering from illness having tested negative for the coronavirus. Club captain Marco Reus made his first start for eight months after a groin injury. US teenager Giovanni Reyna, who assisted all three goals, was outstanding alongside Reus in the attacking midfield role for Dortmund. The 17-year-old played Haaland into space for the burly Norwegian to score both his goals, then delivered a pin-point corner for Emre Can's headed goal. Haaland, 19, once again showed dazzling finishing when he fired home from a right angle on 31 minutes. Can then rose highest from a corner and his bullet header put Dortmund 2-0 up two minutes after the break. Reyna and Haaland combined again when they got in behind the defence as the American delayed his pass which the Norwegian hammered into the net on 66 minutes. Winger Felix Passlack claimed his first Bundesliga goal in added time to complete the rout with Haaland providing the final pass. Defending champions Bayern Munich host Hertha Berlin on Sunday out to bounce back from last weekend's shock defeat at Hoffenheim to end their 23-match winning streak. Eintracht Frankfurt top the league table after their 2-1 win over previous leaders Hoffeheim. Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric netted his eighth goal in four games with a superb strike, curled inside the far corner, to give Hoffenheim the lead on 18 minutes. However, Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada turned the game when he tapped home on 54 minutes, then powered through the defence before Bas Dost stabbed the ball over the line on 19 minutes from time. It could have been 3-1 as Frankfurt had a late goal disallowed. Champions League side Moenchenegladbach romped to a 3-1 win at Cologne as Alassane Plea and Stefan Lainer fired home before Lars Stindl added a penalty on 56 minutes. Cologne scored a consolation goal when Elvis Rexhbecaj beat Gladbach keeper Yann Sommer from 20 metres out. Bremen earned a second win in three games when Leonardo Bittencourt's right-footed shot on 27 minutes sealed their 1-0 win at home to new boys Arminia Bielefeld. The hosts survived a late scare as Bielefeld had a goal disallowed just before the whistle. Leverkusen were held to a 1-1 draw at Stuttgart as Patrik Schick's early goal was cancelled out by an equaliser by the hosts' striker Sasa Kalajdzic. On Friday, Union Berlin enjoyed their first win of the season with a 4-0 thumping of Mainz at home as Germany striker Max Kruse scored his first goal for the hosts."
13,19/09/2020,21:15,Haaland and Reyna shine as Dortmund youngsters down Gladbach,Erling Braut Haaland scored twice and 17-year-old Giovanni Reyna shone as youthful Borussia Dortmund swept aside fellow Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-0 on Saturday on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga season.,"After holders Bayern Munich had kicked off the 2020/21 campaign on Friday with a record 8-0 thrashing of Schalke, Dortmund's youngsters also dazzled at home to Gladbach. ""It was a really good start to the season. We have a lot of young guys, it's fun to play with guys near my age,"" said USA Under-17 international Reyna. ""This is an exciting group and we have to keep working."" Haaland converted a second-half penalty, then again showcased his clinical eye for goal by finishing a superb counter as Dortmund attacked from their own goal. Coach Lucien Favre banked on youth by starting two 17-year-olds in Reyna and England Under-21 midfielder Jude Bellingham, who made his league debut, with Sancho and Haaland, both 20, leading Dortmund's attack. Reyna, making just his third league start, paid back the faith by scoring the opening goal and winning the penalty Haaland converted. Reyna drilled home Bellingham's superb pass from a tight ankle on 34 minutes, then had his ankle clipped after a darting run into the area to win the penalty for Haaland. Sancho tried to convince Haaland to let him take the spot-kick, but ""I was confident whoever took it, would score, which is the most important thing"" said Reyna. Haaland then stole the show with a stunning end-to-end sprint to support Sancho's break before crashing home Dortmund's third goal on 78 minutes. The towering Norwegian, the first player in Bundesliga history to score a hat-trick from the bench, now has 18 goals in 20 games for Dortmund since his arrival in January. For the first time since March, some German league clubs were able to welcome back limited numbers of fans, depending on permission from local health authorities. The biggest crowd of the day was in Dortmund, as 9,300 cheered the impressive home win. ""It's amazing to have fans back, they support us so much,"" added Reyna. Having finished runners-up to Bayern for the last two seasons, Dortmund are on a collision course with the European champions who they meet in the German Super Cup showdown on September 30 in Munich. Earlier, Hertha Berlin's new-signing Jhon Cordoba scored on his debut in a 4-1 away romp at Werder Bremen as the ambitious capital city club also threw down an early marker. In front of 8,500 in Bremen, Hertha defender Peter Pekarik and Belgian-born winger Dodi Lukebakio scored quick-fire goals at the end of the first half to leave Werder 2-0 down at the break and the hosts were whistled off the pitch by their own fans. Colombia striker Cordoba, signed from Cologne in mid-week, came on to start the move which Brazil Under-23 forward Matheus Cunha finished as Hertha went 3-0 up with an hour gone. Davie Selke scored Bremen's second-half consolation goal before Cordoba capped his debut by tucking home Hertha's fourth goal on 90 minutes. Just like Bayern, Cologne also had to play behind closed doors due to a rising rate of infection for their 3-2 home defeat to Hoffenheim, for whom Andrej Kramaric scored a hat-trick. The Croatia striker put the visitors ahead after three minutes following a mix up in defence, netted a penalty and smashed home the winning goal in added time after Cologne had launched a late fight back. In the capital, playmaker Michael Gregoritsch and winger Andre Hahn scored late goals as Augsburg beat hosts Union Berlin 3-1 in front of 4,600 fans. Newly-promoted Arminia Bielefeld earned a point with a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on their return to the top flight in front of 6,500. Stuttgart, who also came up, gave Freiburg a scare with late goals by Sasa Kalajdzic and Silas Wamangituka as they fought back in a 3-2 defeat in front of 8,000."
14,10/09/2020,17:28,'Difficult economic times' - Werder Bremen agree second partial pay cut,"Werder Bremen players, officials and backroom staff have again agreed to waive an undisclosed part of their salaries, the cash-strapped Bundesliga club announced Thursday.","Having previously endured a pay cut in March, the Werder squad and club employees have approved a second lowering of salaries, although no details of the amounts or time frame involved were given. ""We're glad that we've been able to reach a resolution before the start of the season,"" said Bremen sports director Frank Baumann, who is also taking a pay cut. ""This is very positive and will also play an important role in the club's talks with banks and lenders. ""Alongside the executive board and the coaching staff, the players are sending an important message."" Bremen, who won the last of four German league titles in 2003/04, avoided relegation by winning a two-legged relegation play-off last season. Alongside Schalke 04, Bremen are one of the biggest German clubs to admit struggling financially because of lost revenue due to the coronavirus pandemic. When the German league suspended matches in March for two months, several top-flight clubs, including Bayern Munich and Bremen, cut salaries to reduce their wage bills. Bremen captain Niklas Moisander said the players accepted another partial pay cut after learning of the club's precarious finances. ""Reaching such a decision requires every player to be onboard"" which ""was not easy,"" admitted the Finland defender. Bremen start their 2020/21 Bundesliga season at home to Hertha Berlin on September 19, the day after holders Bayern Munich kick-off the new league campaign by hosting Schalke. Under head coach Florian Kohfeldt, Bremen have won all seven pre-season friendlies and face fourth-tier side Carl Zeiss Jena on Saturday in the first round of the German Cup."
15,10/07/2020,14:50,Werder Bremen decide to keep coach Kohfeldt after narrow escape,Werder Bremen confirmed Friday that Florian Kohfeldt will remain head coach next season after narrowly avoiding an historic relegation from the Bundesliga in a play-off.,"The club's board confirmed both Kohfeldt, 37, and sports director Frank Baumann keep their roles despite needing away goals in the relegation play-off to preserve Bremen's record as the club with the most season in Germany's top flight. ""After very open, very honest and a very self-critical review of a season in which we did not achieve our goals... the personnel constellation will continue,"" said board chairman Klaus Filbry. Kohfeldt said it had been a ""crap season, happy ending"" after Bremen's 2-2 draw at Heidenheim last Monday in the relegation/promotion play-off, second leg, kept them up after a goalless first leg. Bremen sneaked into the play-off with a 6-1 thrashing on Cologne on the last day of the Bundesliga season with only their second home league win of 2019-20. Having been promoted internally to head coach in October 2017 after predecessor Alexander Nouri was sacked with the team in the relegation places, Kohfeldt pulled Bremen up the table to finish 11th in 2017-18. They managed eighth last season, but 2019-20 was a disaster with dreams of finishing in the top seven and a place in Europe dashed by two wins in their first 12 league games."
16,07/07/2020,15:30,Bremen boss 'sorry' for keeping Pizarro on bench for swansong,"Werder Bremen coach Florian Kohfeldt says he apologised to Claudio Pizarro, 41, after keeping the veteran striker on the bench for his final match of a career which has spanned three decades.","Having made his Bremen debut in 1999, Pizzaro had spells at Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Cologne before returning to Werder in 2018. His biggest success came at Bayern where he won the Bundesliga six times and was in the squad which lifted the 2013 treble of league, cup and Champions League trophies. Having made 18 league appearances - all off the bench - this season for Bremen, he retired after Monday's 2-2 draw in the relegation/promotion play-off at Heidenheim meant Werder stay in the Bundesliga next season. Following the final whistle, Pizarro was hoisted into the air and Kohfeldt, who is four years younger than his striker, went to apologise. ""I was with him after the game and apologised that I couldn't bring him on in his last game,"" said the 37-year-old Kohfeldt. ""The situation simply wasn't right"". Pizarro was clearly delighted simply to have avoided finishing his career with a second relegation having gone down with Cologne in 2018 when they finished last in the Bundesliga. ""He told me that he didn't give a shit (about not coming on) - the main thing is that we stayed up,"" added Kohfeldt with a smile. The Peruvian wrote ""Thanks, lads. Thanks, Werder Bremen - second division, never!"" on Twitter in the early hours of Tuesday. Pizzaro scored 197 goals in 490 Bundesliga games for Bremen, Bayern and Cologne. Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski is the only foreigner to have scored more in Germany's top flight. Pizarro scored at least one goal in 21 consecutive calendar years from 1999 to 2019 and Kohfeldt paid tribute to the evergreen former Peru international. ""We watched a video (of Bremen games) from the last three decades and it's always the same face (Pizarro) that is laughing there,"" said Kohfeldt. ""That just shows the joy he gave the Werder fans, how much importance he has for this club. ""I can't pull my hat lower or bow deeper to Claudio Pizarro and what he did for Werder Bremen, for the Bundesliga. ""And I'm glad that we were able to end this chapter in the Bundesliga."" Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who coached Pizarro at Bayern Munich in 2015/16, was once described by Pizarro as ""the best coach I ever had"" and the Spaniard returned the compliment recently. ""I would have loved to have met him when he was 24, 25 or 26 years old,"" Guardiola said last month. ""He is one of the best finishers and strikers I have ever seen, not just in the box, but he can also drop. ""He was a bit like (France and Real Madrid striker Karim) Benzema in the quality that he has and he is an incredible human being. ""Maybe 41 is the right age to retire and I hope he continues to stay on as a manager because football deserves people like Claudio."" Pizarro has not said what his future holds, except that he has been offered the position as brand ambassador for Bayern Munich. He has made it clear he does not want to become a coach, but wants to spend more time with his wife and three children, who were all born in Germany. In an ARD documentary, Pizarro also said he also wants to spend time on his stud farm in Peru, which is influenced by his time in Germany with his horses named ""Merkel"", ""Oktoberfest"" and ""El Kaiser""."
17,06/07/2020,23:13,Relieved Bremen stay in Bundesliga,"Relieved Werder Bremen sealed their Bundesliga survival for next season on away goals after a dramatic 2-2 draw at second-division Heidenheim in Monday's nerve-racking relegation/promotion play-off, second-leg with the crucial second goal scored in added time.","""I'm just happy and glad that we made it after all that,"" said Bremen coach Florian Kohfeldt as the play-off finished in a 2-2 draw on aggregate. ""We were dead so many times this year, we always came back,"" he added after Bremen had only qualified for the relegation play-off on the last day of the season. ""It's an incredible pressure that is off us all. ""Every criticism was justified, but chapeau to the boys."" Bremen, who won the last of their four German league titles in 2003-04, preserve their record of the most seasons spent in the Bundesliga by any club while Heidenheim remain in the second tier. ""We had a great chance, we are mega disappointed,"" said Heidenheim coach Frank Schmidt, whose side blew their chance of playing in the Bundesliga after a goalless draw at Bremen in last Thursday's first-leg. ""We may not have lost in either game, but you feel like a loser. ""It is brutal for us now, we will need a few days to recover."" After Heidenheim conceded an own goal within just three minutes, their striker Tim Kleindienst equalised on 85 minutes to keep the hosts' hopes alive. However, Bremen's survival was confirmed four minutes into added time. Replacement forward Fin Bartels beat the defence and set up Swedish defender Ludwig Augustinsson to fire home his first goal of the season and his team's crucial second. In the dying stages, Bremen defender Theodor Gebre Selassie then conceded a penalty when he fouled Heidenheim midfielder Tobias Mohr in the box. Kleindienst fired home the resulting penalty in the eighth minute of added time, but it was too late. Bremen made a flying start when Heidenheim centre-back Norman Theuerkauf gifted his former club an own goal after just three minutes. With ten minutes gone, a long-range shot by Bremen forward Milot Rashica had to be tipped over the crossbar by the Heidenheim goalkeeper. It was 1-0 at the break, but Heidenheim flew out of the blocks in the second half and had Bremen under pressure before forcing the equaliser. With clock ticking down, Heidenheim drew level on 85 minutes when midfielder Tobias Mohr clattered the crossbar and Kleindienst tapped home the rebound before both teams scored in the dramatic closing stages. Fans are not allowed in German grounds since the league restarted in mid-May after a two-months hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, there were curious scenes midway through the second-half when a group of young people appeared briefly in the main stand before quickly being ushered away. Heidenheim, who finished third in the second division, had been bidding for their first Bundesliga season, while Bremen, who finished third from bottom in Germany's top flight, preserve their status."
18,02/07/2020,23:17,Bremen's survival bid goes to the wire after goalless first leg,Werder Bremen were held to a 0-0 draw at home to second-division side Heidenheim in the Bundesliga promotion/relegation play-off first leg on Thursday as the former German champions fight to stay up.,"Bremen captain Niklas Moisander is suspended for the second leg on Monday after being sent off for a second yellow card three minutes from the final whistle for a clumsy sliding tackle. ""That wasn't a good performance for us, but there weren't many chances for either side,"" said Bremen head coach Florian Kohfeldt. ""It's half-time in the play-off, we didn't allow them an away goal, so it's all about Monday now."" Heidenheim wasted a golden chance to sneak a winner two minutes into added time when defender Timo Beermann headed agonisingly wide. Bremen, who won the last of their four German league titles in 2003-04, have spent more seasons than any other team in the Bundesliga. They were relegated to the second tier for the 1980-81 season, the only time in 57 years they were not in the top-flight. Heidenheim, based in south-west Germany, are seeking to reach the top division for the first time and are 90 minutes from potentially joining promoted duo Arminia Bielefeld and Stuttgart in the Bundesliga next season. Bremen snatched their place in the play-off with a stunning 6-1 thrashing at home to Cologne last Saturday on the final day of the Bundesliga season, but they could not repeat the performance. The home side dominated possession in the first half at the Weser Stadion but could not break down Heidenheim's disciplined defence. At the other end, Heidenheim's Argentinian forward Kevin Sessa tested Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka twice in the first 45 minutes. A thunderstorm over the north-west German coast meant the second half was played in a deluge. Bremen's Japanese striker Yuya Osako headed wide of the post 11 minutes from time. A low long-range strike from substitute forward Fin Bartels forced Heidenheim goalkeeper Kevin Mueller into a solid late save before Beermann headed wide at the other end in the dying stages. ""I congratulated them for a very disciplined performance,"" said Heidenheim head coach Frank Schmidt, who kept his team in a huddle after the final whistle. ""We didn't really allow them a clear chance all game and we are strong at home,"" he added, looking ahead to next week's return fixture. Schmidt, who took charge in 2007 when Heidenheim were in Germany's fifth tier, is the longest serving coach in German professional football and has led them to three promotions. They came close to a German Cup upset last season when it took a late Robert Lewandowski penalty to seal Bayern Munich's 5-4 win over Heidenheim at the Allianz Arena in the quarter-finals."
19,01/07/2020,13:21,Promotion play-off has minnows Heidenheim dreaming of Bundesliga football,"Werder Bremen are treating the Bundesliga relegation/promotion play-off ""as a gift"" in their fight to stay up, but for spirited underdogs Heidenheim, Thursday's first-leg behind closed doors is a chance to ""believe in the unbelievable"".","Last Sunday, FC Heidenheim, from a small town of 50,000 inhabitants in south-west Germany, finished above fallen giants Hamburg, who were chasing a return to the top-flight following their 2018 relegation, to claim third place in the second tier and qualify for the play-off. The first leg is in Bremen on Thursday with the return leg next Monday at Heidenheim, who hope to join Arminia Bielefeld and Stuttgart in claiming promotion to the Bundesliga. The play-off is the highest Heidenheim have ever been in Germany's league pyramid. ""For most people, this is the chance in a lifetime. We can create something extraordinary. I believe in the unbelievable,"" said head coach Frank Schmidt. The 46-year-old took over at Heidenheim on an interim basis in 2007 and has been head coach ever since. He has taken them from the fifth division to the verge of the Bundesliga. Under Schmidt, Heidenheim won the 2013-14 third division title on points difference from RB Leipzig, who are now one of Germany's top clubs and into the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Schmidt says there will be scenes of ""utter madness"" if their promotion is confirmed next Monday. The Heidenheim coach says he likes to ""let the mosquitoes fly backwards"" when he celebrates, wildly pumping his fists in the air in a manner reminiscent of Liverpool's German coach Jurgen Klopp. ""But I am not a dreamer,"" he insists as ""the miracle"" would require ""an incredible amount of work"" and ""a lot of passion"" to beat Bremen. Heidenheim are thinking big, even if their squad budget of 35 million euros is dwarfed compared by the 55 million euros of Bremen. ""We are no longer little 'FCH' and we aren't a village club,"" said Heidenheim's CEO Holger Sanwald recently. However, the odds are against them. Since the relegation play-off was reintroduced in 2009, the second-league team has only won three of the eleven play-offs. The most recent success was FC Union Berlin, who came up last season via the play-off and sent Stuttgart down. Bremen coach Florian Kohfeldt is relieved to have two more chances of Bundesliga survival. His side sneaked into 16th place - third from bottom of the table - with a shock 6-1 home win over Cologne last Saturday. ""We've been through many lows, so these two games are a gift to us,"" Kohfeldt said Wednesday. ""Heidenheim can do things that could be dangerous for us, but I don't have the feeling that anyone here is taking things too lightly."" As Bremen sports director Frank Baumann admitted, ""it's basically a better feeling to have the decision in our own hands again""."

Florian Kohfeldt's Werder will face second-tier opponents in either Heidenheim or possibly neighbours, rivals and fellow fallen giants Hamburg in the play-off first leg on Thursday. Bremen have spent more seasons than any other team in the Bundesliga, having only spent one term in the second tier, in 1980-81. A burst of goals from Osako, Milot Rashica and Niclas Fuellkrug -- all in the space of eight minutes -- had Werder 3-0 up at the break against Cologne at the Weserstadion. Former Everton midfielder Davy Klaassen then fired home a rebound just after the break before Osako, facing his old side, added his second and USA international Josh Sargent completed the rout. Dominick Drexler pulled a goal back for Cologne. Werder, the four-time Bundesliga champions, also needed a favour from Berlin and got one as Union beat Fortuna 3-0 with goals from Nigerian duo Anthony Ujah and Suleiman Abdullahi either side of veteran midfielder Christian Gentner's effort. Bremen will find out their play-off opponents on Sunday, with Heidenheim currently in the play-off place ahead of the final round of matches in the second division. At Wolfsburg, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski scored a penalty for his 34th league goal of the season, finishing as the top scorer for the fifth time. Kingsley Coman, Michael Cuisance and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet as Bayern, champions for the eighth straight season, finished 13 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Mueller set up Coman for Bayern's opening goal to finish the campaign with a league record 21 assists, and his goal that rounded out the win was also Bayern's 100th league goal this season -- one short of the Bundesliga record. Wolfsburg captain Josuha Guilavogui was sent off for a second yellow card after fouling Cuisance, leading to Lewandowski's penalty. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach and RB Leipzig secured qualification for next season's Champions League after 2-1 wins over Hertha Berlin and Augsburg respectively, as fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen missed out by two points despite beating Mainz 1-0. Dortmund, who had already wrapped up second place, crashed to a 4-0 home defeat by Hoffenheim, for whom Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric scored all four goals, including one penalty. That result allowed Hoffenheim to leapfrog Wolfsburg and take sixth place, although both sides will go into the Europa League next season along with Leverkusen.

Both must overtake the team above them to do it. ""We owe it to everyone in the club to fight until the very last moment, as long as it is still mathematically possible,"" said Bremen head coach Florian Kohfeldt. To have any chance of staying up, second-from-bottom Bremen must win at home against Cologne and hope Union Berlin beat Fortuna Duesseldorf in the capital. If Duesseldorf draw, Bremen, who are winless in their last 14 home league games, will need to win by four goals against Cologne to climb to 16th and give themselves the hope of a two-legged relegation/promotion playoff against the side who finish third in the second division. In a blow to Bremen, Milot Rashica, the club's top scorer with seven goals this season, is doubtful with an ankle injury. Duesseldorf and Bremen are fighting to avoid joining bottom side Paderborn, who are already relegated. No other club -- not even Bayern Munich, who have already won the title before Saturday's game at Wolfsburg -- has spent longer in the Bundesliga than Bremen. If they are to survive, the club from northern Germany must stop history repeating itself. By coincidence, it was a 5-0 home defeat to Saturday's opponents Cologne in May 1980 which sealed their only previous relegation. Until the season before last, Bremen's arch-rival Hamburg was the longest-serving Bundesliga club. If Hamburg are to return, they need to win on Sunday and hope third-placed Heidenheim do not win. Hamburg, relegated in 2018 for the first time in their history, blew their chances of automatic promotion last Sunday when they leaked two late goals in a 2-1 loss at Heidenheim, who leapfrogged into third place. Fourth-placed Hamburg must beat mid-table Sandhausen and hope Heidenheim fail to win at Bielefeld, who are already promoted as champions. Should Hamburg come third in the second tier and Bremen manage 16th in the Bundesliga, there would be a heated northern German derby in the two-legged promotion/relegation play-off. ""I would rather see Hamburg play Duesseldorf in the play-offs - I wouldn't want to face Bremen,"" former Hamburg legend Uwe Seeler told Sport Bild. Bremen have won the 'Nordderby' 47 times to their rivals' 38 victories with 36 draws. After 10 years at Bayer Leverkusen, home-grown in-demand forward Kai Havertz, 21, could play his last game for the club at home to Mainz on Saturday. Real Madrid, Chelsea, Manchester United and Bayern Munich are all reportedly interested in the attacking midfielder. His Leverkusen contract runs until 2022, with no exit clause, and the rising Germany star has said he will decide his future at the ""end of the season"". A win could lift Peter Bosz's Leverkusen to fourth and into the Champions League places, providing Moenchengladbach lose at home to Hertha Berlin. Havertz's decision could be influenced by whether or not Leverkusen play Champions League football next season. 28 - the league points Bremen have from 33 league games 101 - the league record number of goals Bayern scored in 1971/72. Munich have scored 96 before Saturday's game at Wolfsburg 33 - Robert Lewandowski's league goals for Bayern - a season best for him - yet he's still short of Gerd Mueller's all-time Bundesliga record of 40 in 1971/72 Saturday's fixtures (all times 1330 GMT) Borussia Dortmund v Hoffenheim, Bayer Leverkusen v Mainz, Borussia Moenchengladbach v Hertha Berlin, VfL Wolfsburg v Bayern Munich, Eintracht Frankfort v Paderborn, Werder Bremen v Cologne, Freiburg v Schalke 04, Augsburg v RB Leipzig, Union Berlin v Fortuna Duesseldorf."

Bremen are second-bottom and in danger of losing their status as the club with the most years spent in Germany's top flight. They sit one point behind Fortuna Duesseldorf, who occupy the relegation play-off spot, but six behind 15th-placed Mainz after their surprise win at Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday. Four-time champions Bremen have been in the Bundesliga every season bar one since its introduction in 1963. They were relegated in 1980, but came straight back up. Bremen visit Mainz in one of nine games at 1330 GMT on Saturday and host Cologne on the final day of the season on June 27. ""We have two 'finals', which we must win to stay up,"" said midfielder Maximilian Eggestein. Werder's American midfielder Josh Sargent said: ""No one wants to let the team or the city down."" Bottom side Paderborn have already been relegated. Duesseldorf host Augsburg on Saturday and visit Union Berlin on the final day, while Mainz can secure safety by beating Bremen before their last match at Champions League-chasing Bayer Leverkusen. Mainz coach Achim Beierlorzer has billed the game as a ""relegation final"". Meanwhile, second-placed Borussia Dortmund are looking to bounce back from Wednesday's shock defeat by Mainz at RB Leipzig, who are third but yet to secure a Champions League spot. Leipzig striker Timo Werner, who has scored 32 goals in all competitions this season, has confirmed he is moving to Chelsea from July 1, but can play in Leipzig's last two Bundesliga games of the campaign. Werner scored in Leipzig's 2-2 draw with Duesseldorf on Wednesday, but they threw away a two-goal lead and still need another win to secure Champions League qualification. ""Now we have to deliver on Saturday,"" said coach Julian Nagelsmann, whose side would also leapfrog Dortmund into second with victory. ""Coming second in the league doesn't mean anything. It's about getting into the Champions League and we've got enough to do there."" There will be no coronation for Bayern after Saturday's final home game of the season against Freiburg. The league said they must wait to receive the Bundesliga trophy until after their final match, next weekend at Wolfsburg, due to coronavirus restrictions. Bayern are without the suspended Alphonso Davies, who was sent off in midweek, and Lucas Hernandez is expected to take over at left-back as the Bavarians chase a 15th straight win all competitions. The Bremen striker is 42 in October, four years younger than coach Florian Kohfeldt, but has shaken off a thigh injury and could play a role at Mainz. As he did in Tuesday's 1-0 home loss to Bayern, Pizarro could come off the bench and add to his 488 Bundesliga appearances, with 197 goals. ""I am proud that they call me a legend,"" said Pizarro, who won the Bundesliga six times with former club Bayern and the German Cup on six occasions, five with Bayern and once, in 2008/09, with Bremen. Pizarro also has the distinction of scoring in 21 consecutive calendar years during spells in Europe with Bremen, Chelsea, Bayern and Cologne, but is yet to find the net in 2020. 14: Matches without a Bundesliga win for Schalke.

24,16/06/2020,22:58,Bayern clinch eighth straight Bundesliga title with Bremen win,Robert Lewandowski said Bayern Munich had proved they are the best club in Germany after securing their eighth straight Bundesliga title on Tuesday as the Poland striker's first-half volley saw them claim a 1-0 win at Werder Bremen.,"Bayern were confirmed German champions for the 30th time in the club's proud history to maintain their iron-grip on the Bundesliga shield in recent years. ""We have showed that we are the best team in Germany,"" said Lewandowski. Lewandowski struck two minutes before the break with a brilliant chest and low strike, but Bayern had to endure a nervy final 11 minutes after teenage left-back Alphonso Davies was sent off for a second yellow card. At the end of a first 45 minutes dominated by Bremen's dogged defending and pouring rain, Bayern broke through when centre-back Jerome Boateng chipped over the top for Lewandowski to score. It was the Poland striker's 31st league goal of the season, a career best, keeping him on course to be named the league's top scorer for the fifth time. Head coach Hansi Flick landed the Bundesliga title in his first season in charge having stepped in when Niko Kovac was sacked last November. Even the coronavirus lockdown could not stop Bayern's momentum, with the champions winning eight consecutive games in all competitions since the resumption of German football last month. Flick, assistant coach when Germany won the 2014 World Cup, could land the treble as Bayern face Bayer Leverkusen in the German Cup final on July 4 and hold a 3-0 first-leg lead over Chelsea in the Champions League last 16. ""This is Bayern Munich, the goals are always high,"" said Flick after club president Hainer Herbert had said the treble is the goal this season. ""We have now reached our first big goal, the cup is now the next goal, then the Champions League, but you can't plan for that."" The home defeat means Bremen, who are three points from guaranteed safety with two games left, badly need a result at fellow strugglers Mainz this Saturday or against Cologne at home on the final day of the season. This was Bayern's 13th straight win in Bremen, but Florian Kohfeldt's hosts worked tirelessly. Having given Bayern the lead, Lewandowski went chasing a second and had the ball in the net in the 54th minute but was flagged offside. Canada left-back Davies showed a lightning pair of heels by clocking 36.51km/h, which will be a Bundesliga record if the speed is confirmed, before his late dismissal. Having been shown a first-half yellow card for a foul on Leonardo Bittencourt, Davies was booked again for blocking the run of Milos Veljkovic. Bremen piled on the pressure in the final 10 minutes, with Boateng doing excellently to prevent a late cross from reaching Josh Sargent. Kohfeldt threw on strikers Niclas Fuellkrug and 41-year-old Claudio Pizarro, against his former club. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer pulled off a stunning finger-tip save in the 90th minute to deny Japan forward Yuya Osako, with Pizarro sliding in searching for a tap-in, as Bayern held on. The result means club stalwart Thomas Mueller now equals the league record of former Bayern great Franck Ribery with his ninth Bundesliga title."
25,15/06/2020,03:30,'Seal the deal': Flick urges Bayern to secure title,"Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick wants his side to ""seal the deal"" and wrap up an eighth consecutive Bundesliga title on Tuesday with victory at relegation-threatened Werder Bremen.","Top scorer Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller, one shy of the record for assists in a single season, are both available again after missing Bayern's 2-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach due to suspension. Victory at Bremen, where Bayern have won all 12 games over the last decade, will clinch a record-extending 30th league title, and the first leg of a potential treble in Flick's debut season in charge. ""We want to finish the job on Tuesday. That is our goal. We have an excellent run and want to continue our winning streak,"" said Flick, who stepped in when Niko Kovac was sacked last November. ""The target is to win again in Bremen. We want to just seal the deal."" Bayern have won their last 10 league games and another victory on Tuesday would leave them an unassailable 10 points clear before second-placed Borussia Dortmund, who have three matches left, host strugglers Mainz on Wednesday. ""It's our plan to bring it (the trophy) back home,"" said midfielder Leon Goretzka. Lewandowski, the league's leading scorer with 30 goals this term, netted twice while Mueller, who is sitting on 20 assists, also got on the scoresheet when Bayern thrashed Bremen 6-1 when the sides met in December. Poland star Lewandowski has struck 45 goals in all competitions this campaign and needs one more to establish a new Bundesliga personal best, having also reached the 30-goal plateau in 2015-16 and 2016-17. Despite laboured displays in their last two games, including a 2-1 semi-final win over Frankfurt in the German Cup, Bayern have a legitimate shot at landing a second treble in seven years. First, Bayern, who are also well within reach of the Champions League quarter-finals, must take care of a Bremen side fighting for Bundesliga survival. Bremen have taken 10 points from a possible 18 recently, boosting their hopes with a 5-1 rout of bottom side Paderborn on Saturday, but head coach Florian Kohfeldt played down any talk of an upset. ""There's no reason to go into this with any kind of euphoria. We haven't won anything yet and we're still in a relegation zone,"" said the 37-year-old Kohfeldt, who has lost all five games against Bayern. The Portugal international has struck a rich vein of form since the season's resumption, with a return of six goals in seven appearances -- more than any other player in the league. The 24-year-old striker is rebuilding his young career while on loan in Germany, after struggling with AC Milan following a big-money move from Porto in 2017. He has scored 10 times in 22 Bundesliga appearances with Eintracht, and came off the bench to net twice and grab an assist in Saturday's 4-1 win at Hertha Berlin. 17 - yellow cards received this season by Paderborn's Klaus Gjasula, the most in a single Bundesliga campaign. 19 - longest winning run in the German top-flight, a record set by Bayern under Pep Guardiola in 2013-14. 106 - away wins in the Bundesliga this term, more than in any other previous year.

26,07/06/2020,20:20,"Werder slip towards drop, Union eye safety as teams take knee for Floyd","Werder Bremen were staring at relegation from the Bundesliga on Sunday after a 1-0 home defeat to Wolfsburg, while Union Berlin edged towards safety on a day that featured a renewed show of solidarity with the global protests sparked by the death of George Floyd.","Wout Weghorst headed home the decisive goal for Wolfsburg eight minutes before the end to push his team back up to sixth and into the Europa League spots. The Dutch international's 12th league goal of the season came just seconds after Xaver Schlager crashed a shot off the bar and leaves Werder, the team with the most seasons in the Bundesliga, facing the drop for the first time since 1980. ""It is very disappointing, but everything is still possible. We will give everything until the end,"" said Werder captain Niklas Moisander to DAZN. With four matches left, Florian Kohfeldt's side are second-from-bottom, six points from safety and three from the relegation playoff place following back-to-back home defeats. Werder are the league's lowest scorers with 30 goals and have won just once at home all season, losing 11 times. They travel to bottom side Paderborn next weekend in a match that could be decisive for their survival, with league leaders Bayern Munich the following weekend and relegation rivals Mainz, who are just outside the drop zone and won 2-0 at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday, three days later. The match began after both starting elevens gathered round the centre circle at the Weser Stadium before dropping to one knee, echoing a gesture made by Borussia Dortmund and Hertha Berlin players and Mainz midfielder Pierre Kunde Malong on Saturday. Union Berlin and Schalke players then did the same before their 1-1 draw in the German capital. Favourites to go down in their first ever Bundesliga season, Union are 14th on 32 points, seven ahead of Werder who occupy the final automatic relegation place, and four away from the playoff spot. However their Nigerian striker Anthony Ujah failed in his attempt to score and take the knee himself, as he had promised he would do on Saturday. Ujah did set up Robert Andrich's neat 11th-minute opener. Union are level on points with Augsburg, who snatched a late draw at home to Cologne thanks to Philipp Max's 88th-minute equaliser, which came just three minutes after Anthony Modeste had fired the away side into the lead. Cologne are 12th on 35 points after a draw which also saw Florian Niederlechner miss a first-half penalty for Augsburg. Schalke, who grabbed a point at Union thanks to a fierce Jonjoe Kenny strike in the 28th minute, have failed to win in 12 league games but are 10th and are seven points from the European places. ""It's a tough situation we're in but it's a good step to come away and get a point at a difficult place to come,"" said English goalscorer Kenny. With protests against police brutality and for racial equality taking place around the world on Sunday, the Bundesliga has become a stage for tributes to Floyd, a black American man who died last month at the hands of police in Minneapolis. On Saturday, Dortmund players also wore messages on their T-shirts during their warm-up in honour of Floyd. Jadon Sancho and Achraf Hakimi wore the messages ""no justice, no peace"", while midfielders Axel Witsel and Emre Can's T-shirts displayed the words ""black"", ""white"", ""yellow"" and ""red"" crossed out, with the word ""human"" below. Prior to their 4-2 win at Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, Bayern Munich players warmed up in T-shirts bearing both the Black Lives Matter hashtag and the slogan of the club's official ""Reds Against Racism"" campaign."
27,30/05/2020,21:10,Lewandowski hits brace as Bayern Munich go 10 points clear,Bayern Munich opened a 10-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 5-0 drubbing of relegation-threatened Fortuna Dusseldorf behind closed doors with the league's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski scoring twice.,"Duesseldorf defender Mathias Joergensen scored an early own goal before Benjamin Pavard, Lewandowski (2) and Alphonso Davies hit the target. With five games left, Bayern, who have won their last eight league games, are comfortably on course for an eighth straight league title. However, second-placed Borussia Dortmund could trim their lead on Sunday at bottom side Paderborn. Several records fell as Lewandowski now has 43 goals in all competitions, a season's best for the Poland striker with games in hand. Also head coach Hansi Flick claimed his 22nd win in his first 25 games, bettering the start made by Pep Guardiola when he took charge in 2013. ""Statistics and records don't interest me, what's important is to have a successful season,"" said Flick, in his first season since replacing Niko Kovac in November. ""At Bayern Munich, you are expected to win. I am very happy, we were very aggressive and didn't give them any chances."" Lewandowski, who had never previously scored in six games against Duesseldorf, made amends with goals either side of half-time. Fortuna, who were unbeaten in their three games since the league resumed after a two-month coronavirus-enforced hiatus, were humbled at the Allianz Arena where they last poached a 3-3 draw in November 2018. They fell behind on 15 minutes when Joergensen turned the ball into his own net after Pavard mishit his shot. Right-back Pavard then grabbed the second with a powerful header on 29 minutes before Lewandowski made it 3-0 just before the break after being presented with a tap-in by Thomas Mueller. Duesseldorf were floored with two goals in as many minutes as Lewandowski profited again with another poacher's goal after Serge Gnabry's good work. Davies then scored the game's best goal. After some high pressing, the Canadian teen won the ball in the Duesseldorf area, barged past a succession of defenders and fired home to make it 5-0 on 52 minutes. Werder Bremen boosted their survival hopes with a 1-0 win at Schalke, who are winless in 11 games and continue to plummet. Midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt scored a first-half winner. ""This is a very, very important away win,"" said Bremen coach Florian Kohfeldt. ""We have taken seven points from the last three games, but if you look at the table, we are still behind."" Bremen have spent more seasons in the Bundesliga than any other club, but currently sit second from bottom. However, Saturday's victory leaves them just three points from guaranteed safety with six games left. They are two points behind Duesseldorf in 16th, which carries a relegation play-off at the end of the season. Werder could climb out of the relegation places for the first time since December on Wednesday if they beat Eintracht Frankfurt at home. Bittencourt hit a stunning strike from just outside the box which beat Schalke's Bayern-bound goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel on 32 minutes. Schalke succumbed to their fourth straight defeat, piling pressure on head coach David Wagner. In the same game, Schalke's American midfielder Weston McKennie wore a 'Justice for George' armband as part of the growing protests over the death of an unarmed black man during a police arrest in the United States. ""To be able to use my platform to bring attention to a problem that has been going on too long feels good!!!,"" tweeted 21-year-old McKennie. ""We have to stand up for what we believe in and I believe that it is time that we are heard."" George Floyd died in Minneapolis in an arrest by a police officer who pinned him to the ground for several minutes by kneeling on his neck. Hertha remain unbeaten with three wins and a draw since Bruno Labbadia took charge during the lockdown after their 2-0 win at home to Augsburg thanks for goals by Javairo Dilrosun and Krzysztof Piatek. Having routed Leverkusen 4-1 away on Tuesday, Wolfsburg crashed to a 2-1 defeat at home to 10-man Eintracht Frankfurt. Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada scored the winner 10 minutes from time while Frankfurt had replacement midfielder Lucas Torro sent off in the dying stages for a second yellow card. Frankfurt took the lead when striker Andre Silva converted a penalty on 27 minutes, but Wolfsburg equalised when right-back Kevin Mbabu headed home on 58 minutes. Hoffenheim are seventh after their 1-0 win at Mainz thanks to Ihlas Bebou who darted into the area, swept past two defenders, and fired home on 43 minutes. On Friday, Leverkusen went third when Germany midfielder Kai Havertz became the first player in Bundesliga history to score 35 goals before his 21st birthday to seal a 1-0 win at Freiburg."

McKennie's USA team-mate Jozy Altidore, who plays for FC Toronto, saluted the Schalke player. ""Salute lil bro,"" tweeted Altidore. McKennie is the latest American sports star to add his voice to the protests after US tennis player Coco Gauff on Friday posted ""Am I next?"" on a TikTok video on her Twitter feed. McKennie grew up in Texas, but spent part of his childhood in Germany and joined Schalke as a junior from Dallas Academy in 2016. He has made 19 appearances for the United States national team since 2017."

Bremen's glum home defeat completed the opening round of league matches as the Bundesliga became the first top European league to restart during the COVID-19 pandemic with rigid hygiene measures and fans locked out. ""There is still hope. This is not yet a KO blow for us,"" said Kohfeldt, who has nine games left to keep his side up. However, four-time German champions Bremen, who last won the league in 2003-04, are firmly on the ropes. After fellow former giants Hamburg were already relegated last season, north Germany neighbours Bremen are second from bottom, nine points from safety and five from the relegation play-off place. They are now winless in their last 10 home games -- a club record in the Bundesliga -- and on course to be relegated for the first time since 1979-80. Bremen have a game in hand, against mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt on June 3. However, they will need a much improved performance to take any points from their next two opponents, Freiburg and Moenchengladbach, who are both in the top seven. The Bremen defence could not handle Leverkusen's attack with midfielders Mitchell Weiser and Kerem Demirbay also scoring goals under little pressure. ""We were not good enough to take points,"" admitted captain and defender Niklas Moisander, with the 59 goals conceded by Bremen the worst in the league."

Attacking midfielder Havertz, reportedly a transfer target for some of Europe's biggest clubs including Liverpool and Barcelona, was the star of the show at an empty Weserstadion. He has scored 12 goals in all competitions this season, having netted 20 times last term. It was Leverkusen's 10th win in 11 games, but their first since winning 3-1 at Rangers in the Europa League last-16 first leg on March 12. After a slow start to the game in an eery atmosphere similar to the weekend's matches, with all games being played behind closed doors, the encounter burst into life with three goals in five minutes. The 20-year-old Havertz nodded Leverkusen into a 28th-minute lead, before Bremen right-back Theodor Gebre Selassie levelled on the half-hour mark. But Havertz restored Leverkusen's advantage three minutes later with another header, from Kerem Demirbay's free-kick. Peter Bosz's side wrapped up a comfortable victory with second-half goals from Mitchell Weiser and Demirbay. The heavy defeat leaves Bremen stuck in the drop zone, five points adrift off the relegation play-off spot and nine from safety, albeit with a game in hand. Bremen have spent only one season, the 1980-81 campaign, outside the top flight since the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963."

Like all top European leagues the German top flight is losing income from broadcasting, sponsorships and ticket sales during the COVID-19 pandemic, with matches in Germany suspended until at least April 2. Bayern has a massive wage bill which reached 336 million euros (364 million dollars) last year, almost half of club turnover. Players at Borussia Moenchengladbach were the first in the Bundesliga to propose a pay cut, followed by others at Werder Bremen and Schalke 04. Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen players are in talks over pay cut proposals with management. At Dortmund -- second in the Bundesliga -- coach Lucien Favre has made a personal offer to take a pay cut while players are negotiating a 20 percent salary reduction if the season does not restart or a 10 percent cut if play resumes behind closed doors, when clubs will at least earn income from TV rights."

Marcus Ingvartsen gave the visitors a 39th-minute lead, arriving at the back post to meet Marius Buelter's cross and power a header into the bottom corner. But Union, who were Cup runners-up to Schalke as a third-tier side in 2001, were dealt a massive blow 19 minutes from time as defender Christopher Lenz was dismissed for a second yellow card. Leverkusen wasted little time in making Lenz pay, as Karim Bellarabi equalised just a minute later, drilling a low effort into the bottom corner after being played in on goal by Kai Havertz. The hosts completed the comeback as Chilean international Charles Aranguiz headed home Kerem Demirbay's 86th-minute corner before Moussa Diaby added gloss to the scoreline in injury time. Later Wednesday, Andre Silva and Daichi Kamada scored as Eintracht Frankfurt made the semi-finals with a 2-0 home win over Werder Bremen. Portuguese striker Silva scored the opener deep into first-half injury time from the penalty spot. Japanese star Kamada tucked away the second goal on the hour when he volleyed home a cross from Filip Kostic. However, Kostic will miss the semi-finals after being red-carded for a crunching foul on Omer Toprak.

Germany striker Timo Werner, defender Marcel Halstenberg, new signing Angelino and playmaker Emil Forsberg added second-half goals as Leipzig built on their 1-0 mid-week Champions League win at Tottenham with another impressive away display. Leipzig sit just behind Bayern who squeezed past bottom side Paderborn on Friday when Robert Lewandowski netted twice in a 3-2 victory. Sabitzer gave Leipzig a spectacular lead by smashing a long-range shot past goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel. An hour later, Werner claimed his 21st league goal by rifling into the top corner past Nuebel, who will join Bayern for 2020/21. It turned into a rout when Halstenberg headed Leipzig's third goal on 68 minutes, then Angelino, on loan from Manchester City, beat two defenders for their fourth on 81 minutes. In the dying stages, Leipzig winger Christopher Nkunku produced his fourth assist to tee-up Forsberg, on for Werner, to fire home. Earlier, Haaland, 19, scored his 12th goal in eight games for Dortmund at Bremen to keep Lucien Favre's side third in the table, four points behind Bayern. Haaland, who scored twice in Tuesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg win over Paris Saint-Germain, also netted 28 goals for Salzburg before joining Dortmund for 20 million euros ($22 million) in December. Dortmund ground out victory after showing some early nerves in Bremen where they crashed to a 3-2 German Cup defeat earlier this month.

Hertha were brought crashing back down to earth after Alexander Nouri won his first game in charge following Jurgen Klinsmann's shock resignation last weekend at Paderborn. The home side defended woefully and were 2-0 down inside 22 minutes as Jhon Cordoba scored an early double. The Colombian striker exploited a four-on-two situation for his first goal and easily escaped his marker to head in the second. Midfielder Florian Kanz added two goals of his own before Mark Uth curled home a free-kick 20 minutes from time as Hertha capitulated.

Union's hot form has been mirrored by Andersson's, with the 28-year-old scoring five in his last four Bundesliga games. Cologne started stronger, dominating possession and forcing two fine saves out of Rafal Gikiewicz, including one from Birger Verstraete's superbly taken free-kick in the 29th minute. However Andersson drew first blood for the hosts four minutes later, heading in from a corner to score his seventh of the season. He added the second four minutes after the break thanks to goal-line technology, which ruled that his finish past Timo Horn crossed the line despite Sebastiaan Bornauw's efforts to clear the ball. Cologne were promoted alongside Union but have only claimed one point from their past six matches and are now bottom of the Bundesliga, four points from safety, after Paderborn snatched a last-gasp 1-0 win at Werder Bremen. Sven Michel's 90th minute winner gave Paderborn -- also promoted last season -- just their second win of the season and lifts them above Cologne into 17th place despite being level on eight points. In a dour, rain-soaked encounter, the home side looked better early on, with Werder attackers Leonardo Bittencourt and Milot Rashica troubling the visiters. Both teams appeared content to settle for a point as the match wore on, before Michel struck his dramatic decisive goal. The celebrations were muted as the goal was initially ruled out for offside against Streli Mamba, who provided the assist, before a VAR check saw the decision overturned and Paderborn handed the win. Bremen's sixth defeat in 14 natches heaped pressure on young coach Florian Kohfeldt, whose side are just two points above the relegation zone."
37,10/11/2019,16:29,New-dad Herrmann helps keep Gladbach four clear in German league,Borussia Moenchengladbach maintained their four-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga Sunday as new-dad Patrick Herrmann scored twice in their emphatic 3-1 home win over Werder Bremen.,"RB Leipzig, who won at Hertha Berlin, and defending champions Bayern Munich, who routed Dortmund 4-0 at the Allianz Arena, had both trimmed Gladbach's lead to just a point with their wins on Saturday. However, goals by Ramy Bensebaini and Herrmann's double sealed their win to restore Gladbach's four-point lead at the top on Sunday. Gladbach finished with ten men after Bensebaini was sent off late on for a second yellow card before Bremen midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt netted a late consolation goal deep into added time. However, it was a weekend to remember for Herrmann, whose wife gave birth to their first child on Friday. ""Before the match, I hadn't noticed that the birth had given me a big boost,"" said Herrmann, whose wife Sandra gave birth to their son Leonard. ""I'm going to pick them up from the hospital afterwards."" Hosts Gladbach took the lead at Borussia Park with two goals inside 107 seconds. Midfielder Laszlo Benes whipped in a free-kick and left-back Bensebaini out-jumped the Bremen defence to power home his header on 20 minutes. The second followed almost immediately from a counter-attack when French striker Marcus Thuram drew Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka to present Herrmann with a simple tap-in and an empty net. Yuya Osako looked to have halved the lead with 28 minutes gone when Bremen's Japan forward finished off a flowing move. However, the video assistant referee spotted a foul by team-mate Milot Rashica on Denis Zakaria in the build-up and the goal was disallowed. At the start of the second half, home captain Yann Sommer pulled off two good saves to deny Rashica, and then Germany squad member Maximilian Eggestein at the start of the second-half. The Swiss shot-stopper then saved a penalty attempt by Bremen captain Davy Klaassen on 54 minutes. Herrmann made it 3-0 when he dribbled at Bremen defender Marco Friedl, who backed off and paid the price when the Gladbach winger fired home on the hour mark. With time almost up, Bensebaini picked up a second yellow card for a foul on Leon Bittencourt having also been booked for giving away the penalty Klaassen failed to convert. Then Bittencourt grabbed Bremen's late consolation goal. The home win means Gladbach will have been top for a month by the time they play their next game at newly-promoted Union Berlin in two weeks with Leipzig second and Bayern in third place. Bremen, who have one win in their last nine games, drop to 14th and are two points from the relegation places. Later, mid-table Bayer Leverkusen backed up their mid-week Champions League win over Atletico Madrid with a 2-0 victory at Wolfsburg with goals by Germany winger Karim Bellarabi and Brazilian sub Paulinho. Having been second in the table in mid October, Wolfsburg are now tenth in the league after four straight defeats in all competitions. After three Champions League defeats, Leverkusen breathed life into their slim European hopes by shocking Atletico 2-1, which Peter Bosz's team backed up by out-muscling Wolfsburg. Bellarabi put Leverkusen ahead on 25 minutes by powering into the area and fired home after evading two tackles, Brazilian midfielder Paulinho then came on to add a second goal six minutes into added time."
38,27/09/2019,17:48,Dortmund back under-fire captain Reus after TV outburst,Borussia Dortmund bosses have given their backing to under-fire club captain Marco Reus following his outburst on live television over points dropped in the Bundesliga title race.,"""You can write what you want. We have a clear position. Marco is our captain and will remain so -- there is no reason to change anything,"" director of sport Michael Zorc told reporters before Saturday's home game against Werder Bremen. Reus was fuming when Dortmund conceded a late own goal in Sunday's 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt, leaving them third in the table and three points behind leaders RB Leipzig, drawing fresh questions about the team's mental strength. ""Don't give me your mentality shit now. Every week, the same crap, that's what gets on my nerves,"" an angry Reus told a Sky reporter. An editorial in German daily Bild argued the 30-year-old is the wrong man to lead Dortmund, while some fans called for him to step down. However, Germany stars Julian Brandt and Julian Weigl took to social media to show support for their club captain. ""We have a healthy hierarchy with a lot of experience,"" added Zorc in a nod to Belgium midfielder Axel Witsel and 2014 World Cup winning defender Mats Hummels. Head coach Lucien Favre said Reus ""does his job very, very well"". ""You can get upset that we lost two points, but we have to look forward now,"" added the Swiss coach. Dortmund need a win over Bremen to stave off further questions having already dropped five league points, including three from a shock 3-1 defeat at promoted Union Berlin. However, Zorc sees no cause for concern. ""I don't see us being in the relegation places,"" he said, tongue-in-cheek. ""When I look at the coverage of the last few days, you'd think we are at the end of the season"" having played poorly. ""We have to beat Bremen, then it's two difficult away games,"" against Slavia Prague in the Champions League on Wednesday, having held Barcelona to a goalless draw in their first game, and a tricky league clash at Freiburg four days later. Against Bremen, Dortmund will be without left-back Nico Schulz, who has a foot injury, while Favre said defender Mats Hummels might sit out, without specifying why. ""It's not an injury. We'll see."""
39,20/12/2018,16:04,Bundesliga's top two clash in battle of the Borussias,"Dortmund coach Lucien Favre has warned that Moenchengladbach are ""very dangerous"" as he prepares to meet his former club in a mouth-watering clash between the Bundesliga's top two teams on Friday.","The Black and Yellow's lead at the top was cut to just six points by a shock defeat to Fortuna Duesseldorf in midweek, and second-placed Gladbach will be looking to shorten it even further in the battle of the Borussias - the Borussen derby, this weekend. That clash presents third-place Bayern Munich with a chance to gain ground on Saturday evening when their coach Niko Kovac also faces a previous employer in high-flying Eintracht Frankfurt. At the other end of the table, struggling heavyweights Stuttgart and Schalke go head to head, while Werder Bremen are fighting off accusations of drone espionage. Here are five things to look out for in the Bundesliga this weekend. After suffering their first defeat of the season on Tuesday, Borussia Dortmund are hoping to restore their nine-point lead at the top of the table when they host title rivals Gladbach on Friday. The first versus second clash will also see Lucien Favre face his former club for the first time since resigning as Gladbach coach back in 2015. ""Gladbach are a very good team, they are compact and they get forward quickly,"" warned Favre this week. Both teams are missing key defenders, with Abdou Diallo and Manuel Akanji out for Dortmund, and Nico Elvedi a doubt for Gladbach. Bayern coach Niko Kovac will also be reunited with his former colleagues this weekend as the champions head to Eintracht Frankfurt for another crucial top-six showdown. It is the second time that Kovac has returned to Frankfurt since joining Bayern in the summer. The first came back in August, when Bayern romped to a 5-0 win in the German Supercup Having snatched a late win over RB Leipzig in midweek, Bayern are hoping for a similar result on Saturday evening to keep the heat on Dortmund and Gladbach. Kovac will have to do without in-form winger Serge Gnabry, who picked up a thigh injury against Leipzig. Kingsley Coman is also a doubt, while Arjen Robben remains sidelined until next year. While Bayern are running low on attacking options, Frankfurt can boast one of the Bundesliga's most potent goalscorers. After grabbing a third double of the season against Mainz in midweek, Serbian striker Luka Jovic is now the Bundesliga's joint top scorer with 12 goals in 14 games. Schalke head to Stuttgart in a full-blown crisis on Saturday, after being booed by their own fans in midweek. A 2-1 defeat at home to Leverkusen was Schalke's fourth game in a row without a win, and left them with just 15 points from 16 games, their worst tally at this stage of a season in 25 years. Defeat to Stuttgart could see last year's runners up slip back into the bottom three, but the club's bosses have insisted coach Domenico Tedesco still has their full backing. ""I find it difficult to question a coach who, just four months ago, we were all celebrating,"" said sporting director Christian Heidel. Werder Bremen's trip to RB Leipzig on Saturday looks set to be overshadowed by a spying scandal involving a drone. Bremen were accused of using a flying object to spy on their opponents' training session ahead of their clash with Hoffenheim, and the incident is now the subject of a police investigation and an internal club inquiry. It is illegal to fly drones directly above groups of people without a permit in Germany, but Bremen's sporting director Frank Baumann shrugged off accusations of foul play. ""Creative methods from analysts are normal, so we are very relaxed,"" he said."
40,15/12/2018,21:23,Dortmund edge Bremen to stay unbeaten and increase lead,Paco Alcacer and Marco Reus continued their hot scoring form to propel Borussia Dortmund to a 2-1 home victory over Werder Bremen that extended their lead at the top of the Bundesliga.,"The win makes Dortmund 'Herbstmeister', or winter champions, the unofficial award given to the team on top of the Bundesliga table at the season's halfway point. Dortmund could have gone 1-0 up in the seventh minute after Alcacer chipped the goalkeeper only for Davy Klaassen to intervene just before the ball crossed the line. Remarkably, it was Alcacer's first shot on target to be saved since his arrival in Dortmund. Dortmund fans didn't have to wait long to see Alcacer get on the scoresheet however, with the Spaniard heading a Reus free kick past Bremen keeper Jiri Pavlenka in the 19th minute. It was his 11th goal of the season, most in the Bundesliga. Reus is tied for second. He hit his 10th when he doubled the Dortmund lead 10 minutes later. He converted an expert assist from Jadon Sancho by skidding a low shot inside the left post. Bremen fought back 10 minutes from halftime, with Max Kruse's shot from outside of the box gliding over the outstretched arms of Dortmund keeper Roman Burki. Earlier, Bayern Munich continued their recent run of form, easing to a 4-0 win away at Hannover 96. The Bavarians led early after Joshua Kimmich hit a second-minute volley to convert an awkward-looking flick from Thomas Mueller. Mueller had a frustrating night in front of goal, missing several chances in his 300th Bundesliga game for the club. Bayern doubled their lead in the 29th minute when David Alaba rocketed a strike into the top of the goal which threatened to tear the net from the woodwork. Interviewed after the match, Alaba said nonchalantly ""yeah, I struck it pretty well."" Kimmich turned provider for the last two goals. In the 53rd minute, he played a low cross for Serge Gnabry who weaved through traffic before toe-poking home from close range. Ten minutes later, Kimmich floated a perfectly-weighted cross into the path of Robert Lewandowski who headed his 10th goal of the season. Hanover sit dead last with 10 points from 15 games. ""We can say today was a top match,"" Mueller said. Pirmin Schwegler said Bayern's win was a warning to the rest of the league that the real Bayern are back. ""The Lamborghini was full of gas today,"" said the Hanover midfielder. Elsewhere, Borussia Moenchengladbach, who started the day in second drew 0-0 at wasteful Hoffenheim. The home team dominated throughout, racking up 22 shots to four for the visitors, but were unable to convert. Schalke's Bundesliga struggles continued, held 1-1 at Augsburg. The visitors thought they had snared the three points in the dying stages after Breel Embolo netted, but the effort ruled out for offside. Mario Gomez secured a valuable win for relegation-challenged Stuttgart who won 2-1 at home to Hertha Berlin. Hertha took the lead in the 38th minute through Max Mittelstadt, before Gomez stretched out a leg to tap it into the bottom left corner in the 64th minute. Gomez added a second just ten minutes later, powering a header into goal after an expert cross from Christian Gentner. Fortuna Duesseldorf improved their chances of avoiding the drop with a 2-0 home win over Freiburg thanks to two goals from Kaan Ayhan."
41,01/12/2018,20:41,Bayern up to third with first league win for a month,"Bayern Munich earned their first Bundesliga win for a month as Serge Gnabry scored twice in Saturday's 2-1 win at Werder Bremen, but the defending champions remained nine points behind leaders Borussia Dortmund.","Bayern's victory lifted them two places in the table to third, but they will drop back to fifth if Eintracht Frankfurt earn a fifth straight win at home to Wolfsburg on Sunday and RB Leipzig beat second-placed Moenchengladbach. Bayern built on their 5-1 midweek thrashing of Benfica in the Champions League, but still lag well behind Dortmund, who also won 2-0 at home against Freiburg. ""We know about the situation in the table - every game is important to get the three points and reduce the gap in the table,"" said Bayern goal-scorer Gnabry. ""The victories ensures a good mood and gives us confidence for our next game (against Nuremberg next Saturday). ""We didn't give much away - that gives us confidence."" The last time Bayern were so far behind in the table was in 2010/11, when Dortmund won the title, and their bid for a seventh straight Bundesliga crown is in danger after only their third win in their last nine league games. Gnabry, who started for Arjen Robben, put Bayern ahead on 20 minutes in Bremen after Joshua Kimmich's chip into the area shortly after the visitors had a penalty appeal turned down. Thomas Mueller then fired wide with the goal at his mercy, but Bayern's defensive frailties returned to haunt them as Bremen equalised 14 minutes later. Centre-back Jerome Boateng was out-leapt by Japan forward Yuya Osako after a pin-point accurate cross as Bremen drew level after midfielder Nuri Sahin had gone close. It was 1-1 at the break, but Bayern grabbed the winner five minutes into the second period when Mueller delayed his pass into the box for Gnabry to deflect the ball into the net. Bremen finished with 10 men when Niklas Moisander was sent off just before the final whistle for a second yellow card. However, there was more good news for Bayern as winger Kingsley Coman came on for his first appearance since tearing ankle ligaments on the opening day of the season in August. Likewise, Thiago Alcantara played the last 10 minutes after a month out with injury. In Dortmund, Paco Alcacer continued his phenomenal scoring run by netting his 10th goal of the season to become the league's top scorer. The Spaniard also equalled the Bundesliga record for most goals by a substitute in a season -- just 13 matches into the 2018/19 campaign -- with his ninth goal off the bench in his eighth league game. The ex-Barcelona forward has so far averaged a goal for Dortmund every 28 minutes. Dortmund went ahead when England teenager Jadon Sancho was brought down and Marco Reus hit his penalty attempt into the middle of the goal five minutes before half-time. Alcacer came on in the 70th minute and tapped home a minute into added time after brilliant play by Sancho and Lukasz Piszczek. ""It was logical that this would be a tough game for us, as Freiburg picked up a point (against Bayern) in Munich,"" said Dortmund coach Lucien Favre. ""They were very organised and compact, making it hard for us to find the holes, but luckily we were patient."" Hertha Berlin picked up their first win since stunning Bayern in September with a 2-0 win at Hanover. Berlin's captain Vedad Ibisevic heading home in the second-half after centre-back Jordan Torunarigha put them ahead in the first-half. Stuttgart moved off bottom place with a 1-0 win over mid-table Augsburg after striker Anastasios Donis scored their first-half winner. In the evening's game, Schalke, who qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League in midweek, moved up three places to 11th with a 1-1 draw at Hoffenheim. Andre Kramaric's penalty for Hoffenheim in the second half was cancelled out by a spot-kcik from Schalke's Nabil Bentaleb 17 minutes from time."
42,17/02/2018,20:44,Last-gasp Lewandowski penalty rescues Bayern at Wolfsburg,Robert Lewandowski converted a 91st-minute penalty to rescue Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich with a 2-1 win at Wolfsburg on Saturday which took their winning streak to 13 and extended their advantage at the top of the table to 21 points.,"With Bayern hosting Besiktas in the last 16, first leg of the Champions League on Tuesday, they rested several stars and were almost made to pay. Wolfsburg striker Daniel Didavi gave the hosts an early lead while Bayern winger Arjen Robben had a second-half penalty saved. However, Sandro Wagner headed Bayern level in the 64th minute before substitute Lewandowski hit the winning penalty in injury time. The win stretched Bayern's runaway lead to 21 points as they steam towards a sixth straight title. ""This will to win games, even though it does not seem to be exciting at the top (of the table), makes it fun. This team is just awesome,"" said Bayern captain Thomas Mueller. Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes named a weakened team with David Alaba, Jerome Boateng, Mats Hummels, Joshua Kimmich, Mueller and Lewandowski starting on the bench. Wolfsburg profited from Bayern's slow start after only eight minutes when Yunus Malli's cross was headed home by Didavi. Bayern winger Franck Ribery was then booked when the video referee spotted he had swatted Renato Steffen in the face in a challenge for the ball. It was 1-0 at the break, but Bayern were awarded a penalty when Steffen barged over Corentin Tolisso in the area on 53 minutes. Steffen was booked for his furious protest, but Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels palmed Robben's spot-kick onto the post. Bayern drew level when Robben's cross was met in the middle by Wagner -- Lewandowski's back-up -- to head home on 64 minutes. Heynckes responded by bringing on Mueller, Alaba and Lewandowski in the final half an hour. When Germany Under-19 international Gian-Luca Itter pulled Robben back in the area, the referee pointed to the spot. Casteels got a glove to the ball, but Lewandowski claimed his 20th league goal this season with the last-gasp penalty. RB Leipzig are at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga's first Monday night kick-off, which allowed Bayer Leverkusen to climb to second with a 2-1 win at Hamburg. Leon Bailey continued his stellar season by rounding Hamburg's goalkeeper Christian Mathenia on 40 minutes. It was the 20-year-old Jamaican's ninth league goal this season. Leverkusen's 18-year-old striker Kai Havertz doubled their lead after the break, finishing a move Bailey started. Hamburg forward Andre Hahn came off the bench to claim a consolation goal. Schalke climbed to fifth with a 2-1 win at home to Hoffenheim, whose captain Kevin Vogt gave away the winning goal with a howler of an error. With Schalke 1-0 up in Gelsenkirchen, Vogt's lazy pass across his goal was intercepted by Breel Embolo. With Hoffenheim's goalkeeper out of position the Swiss striker tapped into an empty net on 28 minutes, before Andrej Kramaric headed a consolation goal for the visitors. The result leaves just a point separating second-placed Leverkusen from Schalke in fifth. Freiburg captain Nils Petersen converted a first-half penalty in their 1-0 win at home to Werder Bremen in persistent falling snow. The win ended Freiburg's three-match run without a victory while Bremen stay just above the relegation places. Bottom side Cologne remain nine points from safety as they drew 1-1 at home to Hanover. Japan striker Yuya Osako gave Cologne an early lead before Hanover forward Niclas Fuellkrug equalised with his 10th league goal of the season. In the dying stages, 39-year-old Claudio Pizarro came off the Cologne bench and had the ball in the net, but his header was ruled offside. On Sunday, Borussia Dortmund can go second with a win at Borussia Moenchengladbach as Michy Batshuayi looks to add to his five goals in three games."
43,11/02/2018,20:44,"Kainz brace boosts Bremen survival bid, Ginczek gives Stuttgart hope","Florian Kainz netted two superb goals in Werder Bremen's 3-1 Bundesliga win at home to Wolfsburg on Sunday, helping ease his side's relegation worries.","Stuttgart also boosted their chances of Bundesliga survival with a 1-0 victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach. Werder finished the weekend three points above the relegation zone in 15th with Stuttgart a point and a place above that. Swedish defender Ludwig Augustinsson headed Bremen into an early lead before Austrian international Kainz curled a long-range shot inside the far post on 40 minutes at Bremen's Weser Stadion. Wolfsburg captain Paul Verhaegh gave the visitors hope by converting a penalty early in the second half. However, Bremen sealed the win after midfielder Maximilian Eggestein won possession and striker Max Kruse sent Kainz in behind the defence, the Austrian slotting an ice-cool finish past ex-Bremen goalkeeper Koen Casteels with 18 minutes left. The win leaves Bremen unbeaten in their last seven homes games in all competitions, while Wolfsburg are 13th, but only four points from danger. Earlier, Stuttgart got their first victory under new coach Tayfun Korkut as striker Daniel Ginczek netted the only goal of the game. Korkut, 43, a German-born former Turkey international, was brought in as head coach a fortnight ago to stop Stuttgart's slide after predecessor Hannes Wolf was sacked following a run of seven defeats in eight league games. After overseeing Stuttgart's 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg last weekend, Korkut got off to a winning start at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena. Just five minutes in, veteran Germany striker Mario Gomez threaded a pass between two defenders for Ginczek to sprint onto and cooly slot home his fourth league goal of the season. Gladbach had their chances as Josip Drmic, Brazil forward Raffael and Germany striker Lars Stindl all went agonisingly close for the visitors, who have now suffered three straight league defeats. This was only Stuttgart's fifth league win since October. Erratic Moenchengladbach drop to tenth despite being the only team other than Hoffenheim to beat runaway leaders Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga this season. On Saturday, Bayern's Robert Lewandowski scored for the 11th straight home league match, equalling the Bundesliga record, with Thomas Mueller also netting in a 2-1 win over Schalke that left Munich 18 points clear."
44,21/01/2018,17:38,"Lewandowski, Mueller star as Bayern go 16 points clear",Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller both netted twice as Bayern Munich went 16 points clear in the Bundesliga on Sunday with a 4-2 home romp against Werder Bremen.,"This was a polished display from Bayern's forward pair as the hosts came from behind at the Allianz Arena and hit top gear in the second half. Bremen took a shock first-half lead when midfielder Jerome Gondorf scored his first goal for the club. However, Bayern went into the break level after Mueller equalised before Lewandowski struck with the first of his two second-half headers. Bayern defender Niklas Suele turned the ball into his own net to make it 2-2 with 15 minutes left, but Lewandowski restored the lead barely a minute later. He scored with a towering header to claim his 17th league goal in 18 games this season and leave him as the league's top-scorer, four clear of Borussia Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Mueller converted a superb chip over the Bremen defence by James Rodriguez to claim Bayern's fourth goal. Bayern have won 17 of 18 games since head coach Jupp Heynckes returned in October. The hosts were troubled when Bremen took a deserved lead on 25 minutes to stun the Munich crowd in freezing temperatures. Werder's Germany striker Max Kruse slid a pass through the defence and midfielder Gondorf slotted through the legs of Bayern goalkeeper Sven Ulreich. The ball rolled into the net, despite the efforts of Bayern right-back Joshua Kimmich to clear off the line. Bremen grew in confidence, but Bayern drew level with a superb equaliser by Mueller just before the break. Jerome Boateng's pin-point long pass found Mueller's chest and the Germany star slammed the ball home to make it 1-1 four minutes before the break. Bremen's brave display meant Bayern only took the lead for the first time with an hour gone. Rodriguez, who has recaptured the form which saw him finish top-scorer at the last World Cup, fired in a cross which Lewandowski headed home. The Polish hot-shot stole a march on his marker Thomas Delaney. Suele was left red-faced when the ball clipped his shoulder and rolled past Ulreich on 75 minutes. However, Lewandowski put Bayern back ahead by leaping to smash home Mueller's cross a minute later as Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka fumbled the header. Lewandowski now has 23 goals in 27 games in all competitions. The win leaves Bayern 16 points clear of the densely packed chasing pursuers with only one point separating second-placed Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfurt, who are seventh."
45,29/10/2017,20:28,Bremen boss under pressure after Augsburg thumping,There were calls for Werder Bremen coach Alexander Nouri to be sacked after Sunday's 3-0 home drubbing against Augsburg left them winless in their first ten Bundesliga games.,"Bremen remain second from bottom with just five points after Austria international Michael Gregoritsch netted twice for Augsburg at Werder's Weser Stadion amidst cries of 'Nouri out!' after the final whistle. Bremen qualified for the Champions League as recently as 2010, but have struggled to stay in Germany's top flight in recent seasons. Nouri, 38, has been in charge since September 2016, but is in danger of becoming the third Bundesliga coach sacked this season. Andries Jonker was fired by Wolfsburg in September before Carlo Ancelotti was shown the door by league leaders Bayern Munich, who beat RB Leipzig 2-0 at home on Saturday to top the table under his successor Jupp Heynckes. In Bremen, attacking midfielder Gregoritsch headed the opening goal on 40 minutes, then Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason converted a penalty as Augsburg went into the break 2-0 up. ""The goals before half-time took the wind out of our sails,"" said Bremen defender Niklas Moisander. ""We have to stick together - the performance was embarrassing."" Gregoritsch grabbed his second on 61 minutes with some clinical finishing after Rani Khedira -- brother of Germany star Sami -- started a counter attack. With a perfectly-timed run into the box perfect, Gregoritsch fired home to put the game beyond Werder. ""You could say that was the perfect afternoon for us,"" beamed the 23-year-old Gregoritsch as Augsburg enjoyed their first win in five league games to go ninth. ""We scored at the right times."" Later, Turkey defender Caglar Soyuncu was sent off in controversial fashion just 12 minutes into Freiburg's 3-0 defeat at Stuttgart. Soyuncu, who was the last defender, accidentally handled the ball while jostling with Stuttgart striker Daniel Ginczek. With Stuttgart fans howling in protest, the ref stopped the game and - after a minute's delay - showed Soyuncu a red card, on advice from the video assistant referee. The decision enraged the Freiburg bench, especially coach Christian Streich. To add insult to injury, Ginczek gave Stuttgart the lead on 38 minutes. French defender Benjamin Pavard made it 2-0 with a header just before half-time before replacement striker Simon Terodde netted Stuttgart's late third. ""I talked to the referee at half-time, according to him it was a clear goal chance, which I didn't think much of,"" fumed Freiburg's manager Jochen Saier. ""After a 50-second interruption of the game - I say: 'Congratulations, Cologne',"" he added sarcastically, referring to the Cologne office where VAR decisions are made in the Bundesliga. The defeat leaves Freiburg just above the relegation places while Stuttgart are 12th."
46,10/09/2017,20:02,German female ref makes history as Leckie nets again,Germany's Bibiana Steinhaus made history on Sunday as the first female referee to officiate a match in a top European league by taking charge of Hertha Berlin's 1-1 draw with Werder Bremen.,"Steinhaus became the first woman to referee a top-tier match in the German, English, French, Italian or Spanish leagues when she oversaw the Bundesliga encounter in Berlin. The 38-year-old had built up a wealth of experience by refereeing 80 second-division games since 2007 and was the fourth official on numerous occasions in the Bundesliga, but this was her refereeing debut in the top flight. ""I'll be delighted when normality returns as of tomorrow,"" said Steinhaus after a busy week amidst intense media attention. ""The crucial thing for us is not to be the focus after 90 minutes, which is what we achieved and we're happy"" she added, speaking on behalf of her refereeing team. To mark the occasion, Hertha offered half-price tickets to female supporters who wanted to see Steinhaus in charge. She kept tight control at the Olympic Stadium and fulfilled her pre-match wish that her performance would not attract headlines for the wrong reasons. Stainhaus got a thumbs up from the president of the German Football Association (DFB). ""She was under unbelievable pressure, yet was poised for all the important situations and made the right decisions, that was a confident display,"" enthused DFB boss Reinhard Grindel. ""You could see that she has unbelievable experience."" Steinhaus smartly allowed play to continue when Australia's Mathew Leckie scored for the hosts after 38 minutes despite a foul on Hertha's Vladimir Darida in the build-up. Leckie now has three goals in as many league games this season after his arrival from Ingolstadt. ""I can only praise Bibiana Steinhaus, especially for the scenes around the first goal, when she let the advantage play on,"" said Berlin coach Pal Dardai. ""That speaks for her experience. ""Much respect - she let a lot of things go, even though it was a physically-intensive game. I am very happy."" Steinhaus then turned down Hertha midfielder Valentin Stocker's appeal for a penalty on 76 minutes, which replays showed was the right decision but one that earned her whistles from the disgruntled home crowd. Bremen earned a point in Berlin, their first of the campaign, when captain Thomas Delaney smashed the ball home on 59 minutes after forcing his way through the Hertha defence. Steinhaus' performance was also met with approval from Bremen coach Alexander Nouri, whose side remain in the bottom three. ""As I said before the game, the sex of the referee doesn't matter, only the performance and it was okay today,"" said the Werder boss. Her partner, Englishman Howard Webb, the referee for the 2010 World Cup final, was in the German capital to watch Steinhaus take charge. Named on the official list of Bundesliga referees for 2017/18, Steinhaus sat out the first two rounds of German league matches before making her top-tier debut on Sunday. Steinhaus has been refereeing since 2007 and officiated the women's Champions League final this year as well as the women's 2012 Olympic Games final in London. Schalke scored twice in the space of a minute after the break in their 3-1 victory at home to Stuttgart. Ex-Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Nabil Bentaleb converted a penalty after just four minutes, but Congo midfielder Chadrac Akolo equalised for Stuttgart with his first goal for the club before half-time. Schalke immediately regained the lead after the interval when defender Naldo headed home -- on his birthday -- and striker Guido Burgstaller fired in their third before Naldo cleared a Stuttgart shot off the line. The result left Schalke fifth, ahead of defending champions Bayern Munich, who are sixth after Saturday's shock 2-0 defeat at Hoffenheim, while leaders Borussia Dortmund were held to a goalless draw at Freiburg."

Hertha are offering up to 500 ""Bibi-Steinhaus-tickets"", only available to women, at half-price. ""We want to offer all women the chance to experience this historic moment,"" said a statement on the Hertha website. Steinhaus has been refereeing since 2007 and earned her right to whistle in Germany's top flight after officiating the women's Champions League final this year and the 2012 women's Olympic tournament final in London. The police officer has already proven she can handle Bundesliga stars. As an assistant referee, she shrugged off an attempted hug by ex-Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola during a pitchside exchange in 2014. Last month, she bantered with Franck Ribery after the French winger cheekily untied her shoelaces while preparing for a free-kick when she officiated a German Cup first-round match. ""For me and my referee colleagues, the fact that I am a woman hasn't been an issue for a long time,"" Steinhaus said on the Hertha website. ""But we probably all need to accept and deal with the fact that it will continue to be considered a big deal in the media for now."" Steinhaus insists she has earned the chance to referee in Germany's top tier on merit, but accepts she is now a role model. ""I'm a Bundesliga referee because my performances have been good enough, not because I'm a woman,"" she said ""That's a big difference. ""If, because of that, I am considered a role model for young girls or a pioneer for equality, then that makes me even happier. ""I have a lot of experience now, which is an advantage in many situations. I have different ways of dealing with and reacting to certain situations in the game now. ""On top of that, I have also overseen many games as a fourth official, in order to take in the pace of the Bundesliga."" Both Bremen and Berlin coaches welcomed Steinhaus' debut. ""She has earned it through very good performances, at the end of the day that is the main principle, whether you are a man or a woman,"" said Bremen coach Alexander Nouri. Berlin coach Pal Dardai added: ""If someone refs so well, it doesn't matter if she is a man or a woman. She has already reffed in the second league and error-free, I believe, which is wonderful."""
48,26/08/2017,17:48,Bayern thankful to late Lewandowski double,Late goals in quick succession by Robert Lewandowski gave defending Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich their second straight win with a 2-0 victory at Werder Bremen on Saturday.,"Bremen's last win over Bayern was in 2006, but the hosts held their star-studded opponents until the 72nd minute when Lewandowski first struck. The Poland hot-shot audaciously flicked Kingsley Coman's low cross into the net with his heel before doubling the damage by firing through the legs of defender Robert Bauer and Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka on 75 minutes. Thomas Mueller's decoy run opened up the Bremen defence for Lewandowski, who seized the chance for a third goal in two league games. ""He is certainly the best striker in the Bundesliga and one of the best in the world,"" enthused Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic. ""He is simply our little firecracker."" Lewandowski added: ""Werder played very defensively which didn't make things easy and there wasn't much room for us. We had to be patient and take our chances."" There was more good news for Bayern as Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer made his first appearance this season after a fractured foot. Later, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored in Borussia Dortmund's 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin to resume his battle with Lewandowski to be Germany's top scorer. Aubameyang netted after just 15 minutes from a Nuri Sahin cross before the Turkey midfielder grabbed Dortmund's second when he blasted home from the edge of the area. Gabon's hot-shot striker Aubameyang has now scored in each of his last eight games in all competitions dating back to last season. The home victory puts Dortmund top of the fledgling table on goal difference ahead of Bayern. Like Dortmund and Bayern, Hamburg have also won their opening two games after a 3-1 victory at Cologne on Friday. Elsewhere, Wolfsburg enjoyed a 1-0 victory at Eintracht Frankfurt with Daniel Didavi scoring their first-half winner. Frankfurt's Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng was denied a penalty after being fouled in the area, with the video assistant referee ruling he was offside. After losing their Champions League play-off at Liverpool on Wednesday, Hoffenheim fought back twice to claim a 2-2 draw at Bayer Leverkusen. A 4-2 defeat at Anfield means Hoffenheim will play in the Europa League group stage this season. They fell behind at Leverkusen after Brazilian left-back Wendell put the hosts ahead with a penalty on 33 minutes at the BayArena. Hoffenheim equalised when striker Andrej Kramaric fired home just after the restart, but the scores were level for only two minutes. Germany winger Karim Bellarabi slotted home from 12 metres to put Leverkusen 2-1 ahead before Kerem Demirbay's cross was met by Mark Uth, whose shot went in off the underside of the crossbar on 70 minutes. Borussia Moenchengladbach conceded a goal after just 35 seconds in their 2-2 draw at Augsburg. The game had barely kicked off when Alfred Finnbogason slotted home for Augsburg but goals by Denis Zakaria and Oscar Wendt made it 2-1 to Gladbach at the break. However, Augsburg's new Venezuelan signing Sergio Cordova, 20, hit an 89th-minute leveller, his first goal for his new German club. VfB Stuttgart's Germany centre-back Holger Badstuber scored his first goal in the Bundesliga since December 2009 to seal a 1-0 win at home to Mainz before Simon Terodde slammed a penalty against the post for the hosts."
49,03/07/2017,13:12,West Brom sign China's Zhang and loan him out,Chinese international striker Zhang Yuning signed for English Premier League side West Brom on Monday and was promptly loaned to Bundesliga outfit Werder Bremen for two years.,"The 20-year-old -- who has been capped nine times at senior level -- is according to the English club an investment for the long-term future. ""The Baggies (West Brom's nickname) have signed one of the nation's brightest young football prospects, Zhang Yuning, in a 'development project' that they hope could one day see him make a Premier League breakthrough,"" read a statement on the club website. Zhang's signing is subject to international clearance."
50,20/05/2017,17:57,Aubameyang brace fires Dortmund into Champions League,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice in Borussia Dortmund's 4-3 win over Werder Bremen on Saturday to finish as the Bundesliga's top-scorer and seal his side's direct Champions League place on a dramatic final day of the season.,"Aubameyang finished with 31 goals, one more than Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski, who failed to score in the champions' 4-1 home win over Freiburg. There was drama at the bottom of the table as Hamburg guaranteed their survival with an 88th-minute goal to seal a 2-1 win over Wolfsburg. Two minutes after coming on, Luca Waldschmidt's header, the day after his 21st birthday, sealed Hamburg's win which lifted them to 14th and dropped Wolfsburg to 16th. With Darmstadt and Ingolstadt already relegated, the 2009 German champions, now face a two-legged relegation play-off to stay up. In Munich, Bayern were handed the Bundesliga trophy for the fifth season in a row, extending the record for most wins, and finished with a 15-point margin. Bayern farewelled Philipp Lahm and Xabi Alonso, both World Cup winners, who are retiring after glorious careers. It was the eighth time Lahm has won the Bundesliga, his fifth as captain, putting him equal with Bayern legends Oliver Kahn, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mehmet Scholl. Arjen Robben got the party started in Munich by giving the hosts the lead after just four minutes when he slotted home Alonso's superb diagonal pass. Bayern doubled their lead when Arturo Vidal's curling shot beat the Freiburg goalkeeper on 73 minutes. Ex-Bayern striker Nils Petersen came on to claim Freiburg's consolation on 76 minutes and set a new record of 19 Bundesliga goals off the bench. Franck Ribery and Joshua Kimmich scored injury-time goals to seal Bayern's win. There was drama in Dortmund's seven-goal thriller as Marco Reus and Aubameyang both converted second-half penalties to seal Borussia's comeback win. Dortmund defender Marc Bartra made his first appearance since fracturing his right wrist in the April 11 bomb attack on the Borussia team bus. Werder took the lead when Zlatko Junuzovic stabbed home from close range, but Reus equalised with half an hour gone. Aubameyang scored his 30th league goal -- arguably his best this season -- with a superb volley from a deft chip to Ousmane Dembele over the Bremen defence on 42 minutes. However, less than a minute into the second half, Fin Bartels slammed home after a great run from Max Kruse to make the score 2-2. Despite his midweek snub for the Confederations Cup, Kruse showed Germany coach Joachim Loew what he is missing by chipping home Bremen's third goal on 68 minutes. But Reus slotted home a 75th-minute penalty to equalise before Aubameyang drilled home Dortmund's second spot kick to take the Golden Cannon as the Bundesliga's top scorer. The win means Dortmund finish third while Hoffenheim, who were held to a goalless draw at home to Augsburg, end up fourth to secure a Champions League play-off place. Second-placed RB Leipzig finished their first season in Germany's top-flight with a 2-2 draw against Eintracht Frankfurt with goals by Marcel Sabitzer and Yussuf Poulsen. Emil Forsberg set up Poulsen for RB's second to claim his 22nd assist of the season. It broke Kevin de Bruyne's record of 21 set in the 2014/15 season at Wolfsburg before he left to join Manchester City."
51,18/03/2017,18:57,Leipzig collapse again with Bayern out of sight,Second-placed RB Leipzig crashed 3-0 at Werder Bremen on Saturday to suffer a shock second consecutive Bundesliga defeat which could see Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern Munich extend their runaway lead.,"The Bavarian giants started the weekend 10 points clear in their seemingly unstoppable march to a fifth straight German league title, which will become 13 points if they win at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday. Having begun their first Bundesliga season with a record 13-match unbeaten run, Leipzig's title challenge has collapsed following four defeats in their last seven games, taking a meagre seven points. ""We started well, but then you concede your first goal with their first shot,"" complained Leipzig's coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""We can't rely upon the momentum, that rub of luck, like we could in the first half of the season,"" he added. After losing 1-0 at home to Wolfsburg last weekend, Leipzig folded again in Bremen as Werder's Austria international Zlatko Junuzovic scored their first goal and set up their second. The dead-ball expert crashed home a curling, thunderbolt goal from outside the area on 34 minutes, then provided the free-kick which saw relegation-threatened Bremen double their lead. Junuzovic spotted Florian Grillitsch unmarked on the edge of the area and the attacking midfielder beat Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi on 59 minutes. Leipzig's humiliation was complete as their defence capitulated when Bremen's Fin Bartels led a counterattack and Florian Kainz tapped home on 90 minutes. All three Bremen goals were scored by Austrians -- an extra-bitter pill for RB, who are sponsored by Austria's energy drinks giant Red Bull. Leipzig are now just three points ahead of third-placed Borussia Dortmund after Dortmund's lacklustre 1-0 home win over Ingolstadt on Friday. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the league's top scorer, hit the winner. Anthony Modeste claimed a hat-trick as Cologne broke into the top six with a 4-2 win over Hertha Berlin. The Frenchman needed less than 30 minutes to claim his second hat-trick of the season after also netting three against Hamburg last October. Japan striker Yuya Osako gave Cologne an early lead, then set up Modeste's first goal on 35 minutes. His second followed two minutes later as the Frenchman showed some ice-cool finishing to make it 3-0 to the hosts. Hertha's top scorer Vedad Ibisevic pulled a goal back on 50 minutes when he converted a penalty after Cologne's goalkeeper Timo Horn fouled Berlin midfielder Niklas Stark in the area. Modeste wrapped up his hat-trick by finishing off a superb Cologne counter on 63 minutes, then Hertha's US international John Brooks headed home to make it 4-2 with 20 minutes left. Fresh from their mid-week Champions League exit at Atletico Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen suffered a 1-0 defeat at Hoffenheim thanks to Sandro Wagner's second-half goal for the hosts. Mario Gomez scored Wolfsburg's winner for the second week running when he slotted home on the stroke of half time to seal a 1-0 victory over bottom side Ingolstadt. Mid-table Augsburg were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Freiburg. Greek defender Konstantinos Stafylidis equalised for Augsburg in the first half after Freiburg's Florian Niederlechner had converted a penalty."
52,08/03/2017,19:33,Bremen captain Fritz to miss rest of season,Werder Bremen were dealt a blow Wednesday in their battle to avoid relegation from the Bundesliga as club captain Clemens Fritz was ruled out injured for the rest of the season.,"The 36-year-old ex-Germany international has undergone surgery on his right ankle after being injured in Saturday's 2-0 win over Darmstadt. Fritz, a defensive midfielder who made the last of his 22 appearances for Germany in 2008, is out of contract in June and the injury could end his career. ""On the advice of the doctors and in close consultation with our medical department, Clemens decided to undergo surgery,"" said Bremen's director of sport Frank Baumann on the club website. ""He will no longer be available to us this season."" Bremen are 14th in Germany's top flight, two points from the bottom three, and the 2003/04 German champions have battled relegation in recent seasons. ""We have always emphasised that Clemens can be an important pillar in this team for the coming season and we will be able to talk about it and tackle the topic in peace,"" added Baumann. ""The most important thing now is that he recovers as quickly as possible."" Fritz has been at Bremen since 2006, making 368 appearances, and was part of the team which won the German Cup in 2009."
53,05/02/2017,17:45,Bobadilla's late winner breaks Bremen hearts,Burly striker Raul Bobadilla broke Werder Bremen's hearts on Sunday with a 94th-minute winner to seal Augsburg's 3-2 comeback win and lift the Bavarians up the German league table.,"The powerfully-built Paraguay international chested down a long ball from midfielder Koo Ja-Cheol and slammed his shot into the Bremen goal as Augsburg fought back with two goals in the final fifteen minutes. Relegation-threatened Bremen had been heading for a valuable 2-1 win after Germany striker Max Kruse had converted a second-half penalty for Werder. But South Korea's Koo put Augsburg level for the second time when the attacking midfielder fired home Paul Verhaegh's pass from close range to make it 2-2 with 11 minutes to go before Bobadilla struck. The first-half had finished 1-1 after Augsburg midfielder Jonathan Schmid scored to cancel out Theodor Gebre Selassie's early goal for Bremen. The result in Bavaria leaves Bremen 15th, only out of the bottom three on goal difference, while Augsburg climb three places to 10th. It was another tough result for battling Bremen, who went down fighting in last Saturday's 2-1 home defeat to leaders Bayern Munich having lost by the same scoreline to Borussia Dortmund the week before. Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern finish the weekend four points clear at the top of the league despite a disappointing display in Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to mid-table Schalke. Robert Lewandowski's early goal for Bayern at Munich's Allianz Arena was cancelled out by a free-kick from Schalke's Brazil defender Naldo. Bayern's cause was later helped when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted his 17th Bundesliga goal of the season in Borussia Dortmund's 1-0 win over second-placed RB Leipzig, who had been hit by flu. Aubameyang remains two goals ahead of Bayern hot-shot Robert Lewandowski in the race to be the German league's top scorer thanks to his superb first-half winner. The Gabon striker headed home after teenage French winger Ousmane Dembele ghosted past two RB defenders down the right wing and crossed for Aubameyang to head home unmarked on 35 minutes. Leipzig struggled without top-scorer Timo Werner, midfielder Diego Demme and striker Marcel Sabitzer, who all have flu, while playmaker Emil Forsberg was suspended. The result lifted Dortmund from seventh to third, eight points behind Leipzig."
54,12/01/2017,17:02,Germany's Kruse escapes injury after car crash,Germany international Max Kruse admitted he was lucky to have walked away from a car crash having reported for training hours after wrecking the vehicle he was driving on Thursday.,"The accident happened at 0400 local time (0300 GMT) in north Germany, but Kruse still reported punctually for training at 1000 with struggling German league club Werder Bremen. ""On my day off, I was with my family in Hamburg and drove back through the night,"" the striker explained in a video posted on his Facebook account. ""I left the road, due to ice, and slipped a bit into the railings. My car is a write off, but I'm fine, so there is no need to worry. ""I'll be able to play at the weekend. ""There will be a lot written about this, so I wanted to clarify things so there are no misunderstandings."" The 28-year-old won the last of his 14 caps for Germany in October 2015 and his Bremen team, who are fourth from bottom of the table, host Borussia Dortmund in their first Bundesliga game of 2017 on January 21. Kruse left no doubts he will be fit for Saturday's friendly at second-division leaders Eintracht Braunschweig and Sunday's final warm-up match at home to fourth-division Oldenburg."
55,15/11/2016,16:33,Gnabry to Bayern rumours infuriate Bremen boss,Werder Bremen have hit out at constant speculation linking Serge Gnabry with Bayern Munich after his hat-trick on his Germany debut made the forward red-hot property.,"The 21-year-old joined Bremen from Arsenal for a bargain five million euros ($5.3m) in August after signing a four-year deal and has made an immediate impact for club and country. He won silver with Germany at the Rio Olympics, has scored four goals in nine league games for strugglers Bremen and capped his senior debut at San Marino last Friday with three goals. He was the first German to score a hat-trick on his international debut in 40 years and was set to make his second appearance for the world champions in Tuesday's friendly against Italy in Milan. But Frank Baumann, Bremen director of sport, says he is annoyed by persistent rumours -- which the club has repeatedly denied -- that Gnabry's contract has a release clause allowing him to join Bayern. Baumann has even been compelled to quash rumours of a transfer in January's winter break to Bayern, who have a tradition of snapping up talented homegrown players. ""You have to ask yourself why these rumours remain in circulation,"" Baumann told website spox.de. ""They appeared the day before the signing, were then repeatedly denied by us and are still discussed to this day. ""That's a pity because we made our position clear. I can't explain why these rumours still keep appearing."" Bremen are third from bottom of the German league with Bayern top. When Gnabry signed for Bremen, there were rumours that Bayern had paid the transfer fee and would then loan him back to their fellow German club. ""There aren't any agreements with other clubs. Serge Gnabry is our player. We have bought him,"" insisted Baumann at the time. So swift has been Gnabry's rise to the Germany squad that he admitted he thought it was a hoax when the call came from head coach Joachim Loew. ""The coach called me up but I had to think about it for a bit whether it was true or not,"" he told German media company RND. ""There are so many hoax calls from radio shows and I really did not want to be a victim of that."""
56,23/10/2016,17:48,Keita propels unbeaten RB Leipzig past Bremen,Guinea international Naby Keita scored twice as Bundesliga newcomers RB Leipzig defeated Werder Bremen 3-1 on Sunday to climb up to second place in Germany.,"Keita capped off a superb solo run to put Leipzig in front just before half-time, and the midfielder struck again on 74 minutes when he powered home a cross from former Bremen striker Davie Selke. Serge Gnabry gave the visitors hope as he cut the deficit in half almost immediately, but Germany Under-21 international Selke, who left Werder for Leipzig in July 2015, sealed the win deep into stoppage time. Ralph Hasenhuettl's Leipzig extended their unbeaten start to their maiden campaign in the German top flight as they pulled to within two points of leaders Bayern Munich. Werder, who lost their first four matches this term, dropped to 15th in the table after seeing a three-game unbeaten run snapped. Schalke collected just their second win after a dreadful start to the campaign as they eased past Mainz 3-0 in Gelsenkirchen. Algerian midfielder Nabil Bentaleb, on loan from Tottenham Hotspur, scored either side of a Max Meyer strike to fuel the Royal Blues' continued resurgence. Reigning champions Bayern defeated Borussia Moenchengladbach 2-0 on Saturday with goals from Arturo Vidal and Douglas Costa to return to winning ways after back-to-back draws in the league. Borussia Dortmund twice fought back from two goals behind to salvage a 3-3 draw at lowly Ingolstadt after 18-year-old US international Christian Pulisic popped up with an equaliser at the death. Hoffenheim, like Bayern and Leipzig, also remain undefeated following an impressive 3-0 victory away to Bayer Leverkusen."
57,16/10/2016,19:32,Bremen's teenage refugee delights at 'dream' first goal,"Werder Bremen striker Ousman Manneh admitted it was ""a dream come true"" to score his first Bundesliga goal, just two years after the teenage refugee fled Gambia.","The 19-year-old netted Bremen's winner in Saturday's 2-1 shock victory over Bayer Leverkusen to cap his fairytale rise having only been plucked from Bremen's reserves at the start of the season. ""I can't believe this. One of my biggest dreams has come true. Is this real or am I dreaming?,"" the teenager asked reporters after scoring Bremen's 59th-minute winner at Werder's Weser Stadion. ""This is the greatest moment of my life. ""It's hard to describe my feelings. I've been so proud to be the first Gambian to play four (Bundesliga) games, and now I'm proud to be the first one to score."" ""I always wanted to play football, of course, to do that in front of 40,000 fans at the Weser Stadion,"" he added with a grin. Having left his family behind and set out for Europe in early 2014, Manneh ended up as an asylum seeker in Germany and settled in a home for refugees in Bremen, where he started playing football. He scored 15 goals for the youth team of local club Blumenthaler SV and although Bundesliga clubs Schalke, Wolfsburg and Hamburg tried to sign him, he opted to stay in Bremen and joined Werder's reserves in March 2015. ""I like the city and have found friends here who could help me. Why would I want to leave?"" he asked rhetorically. He only made his debut in Germany's top flight less than four weeks ago and kissed the stadium turf, struggling to hold back the tears, after scoring against Leverkusen. He happily posed for pictures with fans afer the final whistle as he lapped up his moment of glory. Having made his debut against Mainz on September 21, he set up a goal against Darmstadt a fortnight ago and then scored the winner against Bayer, who host Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday in the Champions League. ""'Ous' has never been gifted anything, but instead he's worked hard the last few years and shown a constant development,"" said Werder's caretaker coach Alexander Nouri. Both the teenager and Nouri are reluctant to give any details of Manneh's flight from Gambia which landed him in the Hanseatic city. ""It is a profound, touching story,"" was all Nouri would offer. His fairytale rise is down to Nouri, who brought the striker with him when he was promoted from the reserve team to replace Viktor Skripnik, who was sacked in mid September. ""I really have to thank coach Nouri for believing in me and giving me the opportunity to play on the big stage,"" added Mennah. He made his German league debut in Nouri's first game and has played in all four matches since when Bremen have taken seven points with two wins and a draw to leave the relegation places behind. But he says more is to come. ""Last year I didn't score any goals as I was working on different aspects of my game,"" said Mennah. ""Now I need to work on improving my efficiency. ""Even after a game like that, my manager will come to me and say that I shouldn't be satisfied. It encourages me to keep going."" His team-mates are full of praise for Mennah's work ethic. ""He's very diligent and eager to learn,"" said attacking midfielder Zlatko Junuzovic, who set up his winner against Leverkusen. ""He's a down-to-earth and positive person, always in a good mood. We are all really happy for him and he deserves to have scored this goal."" Bremen skipper Clemens Fritz says Mennah's hard work is paying off. ""His progression in the last two years is not a coincidence,"" said the ex-Germany international."
58,02/10/2016,14:58,Bremen give caretaker coach Nouri until May,Werder Bremen have given caretaker coach Alexander Nouri a full-time contract until the end of the season with the 37-year-old charged with keeping them in Germany's top flight.,"Having been in charge of the club's under-23 side, Nouri was appointed head coach of the senior team a fortnight ago when Viktor Skripnik was sacked with Bremen bottom of the table after four straight defeats. But Nouri has been rewarded after picking up a win and a draw from his three games in charge to steer the club up to 15th -- just above the relegation places. ""He has shown in recent weeks that he can connect with the team and done an excellent job,"" said Bremen's director of sport Frank Baumann. ""We have come to the decision that he should get the opportunity to continue the work he started."" But Nouri is far from assured of remaining in charge beyond next summer. ""We have never made a secret of the fact that in our requirements for the job description, experience plays an important role,"" added Baumann. ""We knew Alexander Nouri and his team would do a very good job, but we can't give any guarantees."" Nouri has certainly produced decent results from his three games in charge. Bremen were winning until two goals in the final five minutes consigned them to a 2-1 defeat at Mainz in his opening game, three days after Skripnik was sacked. Werder then beat Wolfsburg 2-1 last weekend before drawing 2-2 at Darmstadt on Saturday. ""It is a big challenge, but we will succeed together,"" Nouri said in Sunday's press conference. ""It's been great fun so far and I am looking forward to the task."" Bremen's Senegal defender Lamine Sane and Germany Under-21 winger Serge Gnabry, with his second since joining from Arsenal, netted the goals in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Darmstadt, for whom Antonio-Mirko Colak scored twice. ""We're performing better as a unit. We have benefited a lot from the new coach,"" said Gnabry."
59,31/08/2016,22:15,"Arsenal's Gnabry joins Bremen, Hamburg sign Santos","Arsenal's German winger Serge Gnabry joined Werder Bremen on Wednesday in a bid to get more first-team football, while Hamburg signed Brazil defender Douglas Santos before the Bundesliga's transfer window closed.","Gnabry, who won silver at the Rio Olympics when Germany lost the football final to Brazil, completed a medical before posing with his new Bremen shirt at his unveiling. ""It was important for me to come to a club who could give me the prospect of regular matches,"" said Gnabry, who made three Champions League appearances for Arsenal and just 11 Premier League appearances since his senior debut in 2012. ""The bosses at Bremen worked very hard for me and I am sure we can make things happen here."" No details of the length of the contract have been announced, but the transfer is expected to cost Bremen between five and six million euros ($5.5m-$6.6m). The Germany Under-21 forward has been brought in as cover for striker Max Kruse, who is out for the foreseeable future with a knee injury. Gnabry, who played all six matches for Germany in Rio, joined the Gunners in 2011 after coming through the junior ranks at VfB Stuttgart, the city where he was born. He was unable to earn a regular starting spot at Arsenal and spent last season on loan at West Bromwich Albion. Bremen badly need a boost after a 6-0 drubbing at defending champions Bayern Munich last Friday, on the opening weekend of the new Bundesliga season. The hammering came less than a week after their shock German Cup defeat at third-division Sportfreunde Lotte. Meanwhile, shortly before the transfer window in Germany closed at 6pm (1600 GMT), Bremen's north German rivals Hamburg bought 22-year-old left-back Santos for a reported 10 million euros from Brazilian first division club Atletico Mineiro. Hamburg will be the Brazilian's third European club after spells at Spain's Granada and Italy's Udinese. Santos was a gold medallist in Rio, when the Selecao beat Germany on penalties. ""We are very happy that, just before the closing of the transfer window, we could strengthen our defence by signing such a talented player as Douglas Santos,"" said Hamburg chairman Dietmar Beiersdorfer."
60,27/08/2016,18:58,Bayern's opening Bremen rout concerns Bundesliga boss,"Reinhard Rauball, president of the German Football League (DFL), admits Bayern Munich's trashing of Werder Bremen to kick-off the 2016/17 season was not a good advertisement for the Bundesliga.","""Bayern played some very good football, but I was shocked by the how little resistance Werder Bremen offered,"" Rauball told German radio on Saturday. Robert Lewandowski netted a hat-trick on Friday at Munich's Allianz Arena as defending champions Bayern routed hapless Werder 6-0, battering the Bremen goal with 24 shots. At the other end, Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer had just four saves to make for the hosts as the Bremen defence collapsed. Bayern's domination of the Bundesliga title for the last four seasons shows no signs of weakening as Carlo Ancelotti has replaced Pep Guardiola as head coach. The game was televised live in 210 countries, but despite the flurry of goals, Rauball says the match did little to sell Germany's top flight overseas. ""No one can argue that the match was on a knife edge, but I hope the millions of viewers were pleased with the goals and can take that as some compensation."" Bayern also trounced Hamburg 5-0 in the opening game of the 2015/16 season, leaving Rauball pondering how the DFL can make the season opener in Germany's top flight less of a one-sided affair. Traditionally, the defending German champions kick-off the new season at home, but Rauball was left wondering whether to tinker with the format. But he said he would not consider letting Bayern and Borussia Dortmund, Germany's top two teams in recent years, meet in the first league game of next season. ""Already during (Friday's) match, I was left thinking: who comes into question for next season's opening match?,"" admitted Rauball after the start of the 54th Bundesliga season. ""But you don't play the highlight of the season, like when the top team plays the second best, as the opening match. No other league would do that."""
61,26/08/2016,22:38,Lewandowski hat-trick as Bayern rout Bremen in season opener,Robert Lewandowski claimed a hat-trick as defending champions Bayern Munich brushed Werder Bremen aside with a 6-0 win in Friday's opening match of the new German league season.,"Lewandowski, the Bundesliga's top-scorer last season with 30 goals, could have finished with five as Bayern ran riot. After Xabi Alonso scored the first goal of the 2016/17 campaign at Munich's Allianz Arena, Lewandowski netted either side of the break before captain Philipp Lahm added a fourth. It was no more than shooting practice for Bayern by the time Franck Ribery fired home, with Lewandowski then converting a penalty to claim his third and Munich's sixth. Having also hammered Hamburg 5-0 in last season's opening game, this was another emphatic win as Bayern look to win a fifth Bundesliga title in a row. It finished 2-0 at the break, but it could have been at least double that as Lewandowski and then Thomas Mueller both hit the woodwork in the opening 45 minutes. Bayern won last season's German league title by 10 points, making history with a fourth straight Bundesliga title. They picked up under new coach Carlo Ancelotti where they left off under Pep Guardiola, who left in May to coach Manchester City, with long periods of possession. Bayern's win came with Germany defenders Jerome Boateng and Holger Badstuber, plus Dutch winger Arjen Robben all recovering from injury. New signing Renato Sanches from Benfica, a Euro 2016 winner with Portugal, started on the bench. Germany defender Mats Hummels, their other new arrival from Borussia Dortmund, partnered Javi Martinez at centre-back. The defending champions needed just nine minutes to take a spectacular lead. Alonso's volley from just outside the area found the top right-hand corner and flew past Bremen goalkeeper Felix Wiedwald. The hosts doubled their lead just four minutes later. Ribery's long-range pass down the left put Lewandowski in behind the defence and the Poland hot-shot tucked his shot past Wiedwald from the tightest of angles. He could have claimed a first-half hat-trick. Muller's long-range shot slammed off the post, then Lewandowski hit the crossbar and had a shot saved before the break. The pair combined for Bayern's third goal, which arrived just 39 seconds into the second-half. Mueller's curling cross was met at the far post by Lewandowski for his second on 46 minutes. Bremen's last win over Bayern in Munich was back in 2008 and they were barely in it as Bavarians enjoyed around 70 percent possession. Lahm grabbed Bayern's second when he converted Mueller's final pass before Ribery blasted home their fifth with the Frenchman unmarked in the area. Rafinha came on for Lahm and when the Brazil defender was fouled in the area, Lewandowski drilled home the resulting penalty on 77 minutes. It was his second hat-trick in exactly a week after he netted three in Bayern's 5-0 romp at Carl Zeiss Jena in the first round of the German Cup last Friday."

Lotte midfielder Andre Dej struck though in the 54th minute, and the home side held on for a famous victory over the six-time winners. There were no other major shocks, but plenty of top-flight teams still struggled elsewhere on Sunday. Bayer Leverkusen were given a scare, but edged to a 2-1 win at fifth-division SC Hauenstein thanks to goals from Javier Hernandez and Karim Bellarabi. Eintracht Frankfurt could only scrape past Magdeburg on penalties after being held to a 1-1 draw, while Mainz also progressed on spot-kicks at fourth-tier outfit Unterhaching after blowing a 3-1 lead in the 90th minute to draw 3-3. Ingolstadt were held to a 0-0 stalemate at Erzgebirge Aue but came on top 8-7 in a marathon shoot-out, while Salomon Kalou scored the winning spot-kick as Hertha Berlin edged out third-division side Regensburg on penalties after a 1-1 draw.

Pizarro only helped Bremen avoid relegation with a last-gasp 1-0 win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. It was Pizarro's header which led to Papy Djilobodji's dramatic 88th-minute winner against Frankfurt which kept Bremen up Pizarro will turn 38 in October and has said his ambition is to play for Peru at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. ""I feel good and am pleased that I am able to play another season for this special club,"" the Peru international told Werder.tv. ""It's been a difficult, but really great year for me.""

Djilobodji stabbed home Bremen's crucial goal just before the final whistle at Werder's Weser Stadion to spark the host side's celebrations. The crucial three points catapulted Bremen up from 16th in the table to 13th and safety. Their last-gasp defeat means Frankfurt finish 16th and now face a two-legged relegation play-off against Nuremberg, who finish second in Germany's second division. The first leg will be held in Frankfurt on Thursday with the return leg on May 23 in Nuremberg. Elsewhere VfB Stuttgart, the 2007 German league champions, were relegated, joining Hanover in the second division next season, after their 3-1 defeat at Wolfsburg. Stuttgart's Australia goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak pulled off a string of saves, but it was not enough to deny Wolfsburg. Andre Schuerrle boosted his chances of making Germany's Euro 2016 squad on Tuesday with two goals as Wolfsburg caught Stuttgart on the counter-attack. Stuttgart forward Daniel Didavi sparked a late fight back with a 78th-minute goal as his side finished 17th - second from bottom to be relegated alongside bottom side Hanover 96. After 40 years in Germany's top flight, Stuttgart will find themselves in the second tier for the first time since the 1976/77 season."

He has already apologised to De Blasis for making the gesture. But just three days before Bremen's crucial home match against fellow relegation candidates Eintracht Frankfurt, it has emerged the on-loan Chelsea player is being investigated by public prosecutors. ""We're investigating a Werder player for threatening behaviour,"" senior public prosecutor Frank Passade told German daily Bild. Djilobodji has played 13 of Bremen's 16 league games in the second half of the season since joining Werder from Stamford Bridge in January. He has scored one goal and created another, while picking up six yellow cards in Germany's top flight. Bremen's director of sport Thomas Eichin says the club will deal with the legal implications after their final game of the season against Frankfurt on Saturday. Bremen are 16th in the league table, which would mean a two-legged relegation play-off against the team which finishes third in the second division, while Frankfurt are just a point above them."

Bremen took an early lead when Bartel netted after just 10 minutes, but Stuttgart's Daniel Didavi slotted home from ten metres out just before the half hour mark. Stuttgart's Italian defender Federico Barba headed into his own net on 33 minutes, then Werder midfielder Levin Oztunali made it 3-1 by netting just before the break. Barba made amends for his earlier error on 53 minutes when he fired home between the legs of Bremen defender Jannik Vestergaard to leave Stuttgart 3-2 behind. But Werder made sure of the win when the 37-year-old Pizarro netted his 14th league goal of the season by firing home from 15 metres out on 64 minutes. Bremen claimed two goals in the final ten minutes as Bartels grabbed his second on 80 minutes, then Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah came on for Pizarro and scored four minutes later. Bremen now play Cologne away on Saturday before hosting Eintracht Frankfurt at home on the final day of the season on May 14. Stuttgart, the 2007 German champions, are home to seventh-placed Mainz on Saturday, then play Wolfsburg away in their bid to stay up."
70,30/04/2016,18:35,Bayern made to wait for historic fourth title in row,Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich must wait to have their historic fourth consecutive Bundesliga title confirmed after being held to a 1-1 draw at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday.,"The champagne had to be put back on ice at the Allianz Arena after Thomas Mueller's first-half header for Bayern was cancelled out by Andre Hahn's superb second-half strike for Gladbach. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund romped to a 5-1 win at home against Wolfsburg to trim Bayern's lead at the top to five points with two games left. Bayern are away to mid-table Ingolstadt next Saturday, then host relegated Hanover on the final day of the season in a fortnight. The draw with Gladbach comes three days before Tuesday's crunch Champions League home semi-final against Atletico Madrid with Bayern having lost the first leg 1-0 away last Wednesday. ""Of course, we had wanted to win today, for our fans and for ourselves,"" said Guardiola. ""We need just a point now, a draw, or a win to secure the title. ""But now there's time to concentrate on Atletico Madrid, it will be a different game on Tuesday. We must play better."" Bayern were punished for sitting back after Mueller's sixth-minute headed opener. Gladbach, one of only two clubs to beat Bayern in the German league this season, hit back when Hahn slotted home on 72 minutes having gone close just moments before. A superb pass from Lars Stindl put Hahn in behind the Bayern defence and he wrong-footed Medhi Benatia before firing his shot past Manuel Neuer. There was some good news for Bayern as Jerome Boateng played his first game since January. The Germany defender is now in line to face Diego Simeone's Atletico with a place in the Champions League final on May 28 at stake. In Dortmund, Borussia hammered Wolfsburg with Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa scoring their first and creating their second before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang came off the bench to score twice. The Gabon striker now has 25 league goals this season, leaving him two short of Bayern's Robert Lewandowski. Dortmund took the lead when Henrikh Mkhitaryan's bullet pass was deflected home by Kagawa, who then set up Ramos to leave Dortmund 2-0 up inside nine minutes. Marco Reus grabbed their third by chipping home with an hour gone. Aubameyang replaced Ramos on 69 minutes and scored his first just eight minutes later when Mkhitaryan's pass found him unmarked to header home, then netted a second header just a minute later before Wolfsburg's Andre Schuerrle scored a consolation. At the other end of the table, Hanover 96's relegation was confirmed by their 3-1 defeat to Schalke. Eintracht Frankfurt boosted their survival hopes with a 2-1 win at Darmstadt to go 16th, which carries a two-legged promotion/relegation play-off at the end of the season. But 17th-placed Werder Bremen can push Frankfurt back down the table if they beat VfB Stuttgart, who are 15th, at home on Monday in a crunch relegation battle. Mid-table Hamburg played out a goalless draw at home to Mainz, who stay seventh and on course for a Europa League place. Hoffenheim looked to have escaped relegation under 28-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann, the youngest in the Bundesliga's history, and they are four points from the drop zone, after their 2-1 win at home to Ingolstadt."
71,23/04/2016,17:51,Bayern made to wait for historic fourth straight title,Bayern Munich must wait another week to claim an historic fourth consecutive Bundesliga title although Saturday's 2-0 win at Hertha Berlin left them seven points clear with three games left.,"Bayern could have had the league wrapped up in the capital had second-placed Dortmund not won 3-0 at VfB Stuttgart. That result means Pep Guardiola's Bavarians will secure the title if they beat Borussia Moechengladbach at home next Saturday regardless of other results. No other team has even won four consecutive league titles in Germany's top flight. Bayern took the lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium when Mario Goetze's pass found Vidal in space. The Chile midfielder drilled home his shot from 22 metres, which took a deflection on it's way past Berlin goalkeeper Thomas Kraft on 48 minutes. Brazil winger Douglas Costa doubled Bayern's lead with a breath-taking strike from the right flank which looped over the Hertha goalkeeper on 79 minutes. But this was a far from polished performance from Bayern, ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, first-leg, at Atletico Madrid. They managed just six shots on goal, compared to Hertha's nine, despite the hosts being restricted to just 26 percent possession. Dortmund, who will face the Bavarians in the German Cup final on May 21, made Bayern wait a little longer to have their title win confirmed with a comprehensive win at Stuttgart. Borussia were 2-0 up at the break after Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa netted early on, then 17-year-old Christian Pulisic scored for the second week running. Just before half-time he tapped home after Henrikh Mkhitaryan's shot from outside the area was blocked by Stuttgart's Poland goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton. Mkhitaryan made it 3-0 when he fired home after Kagawa's cross to striker Adrian Ramos, in for the injured Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, was blocked by Tyton on 56 minutes. Wolfsburg's miserable league form continues as they are now six Bundesliga games without a win after crashing 2-0 at home to Augsburg. Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason, on loan from Olympiakos, scored his sixth league goal in ten games, with a minute gone, then set up Turkey international Halil Altintop on 57 minutes. The defeat sees Wolfsburg drop to tenth in the table while Augsburg are now five points clear of the relegation places. Cologne are up to ninth after backing up their 3-2 comeback win over Mainz with a 4-1 thumping of Darmstadt as French striker Anthony Modeste and winger Marcel Risse both scored twice. Hanover have only a mathematical chance of avoiding relegation after Japan internationals Hiroki Sakai and Hiroshi Kiyotake scored in their 2-2 draw with 10-man Ingolstadt. Ingolstadt played for 70 minutes with ten men after French defender Romain Bregerie was sent off for hauling down Hanover midfielder Felix Klaus. Alfredo Morales and Moritz Hartmann had hosts Ingolstadt 2-0 up with only 25 minutes gone. Defender Sakai fired home on 58 minutes before midfielder Kiyotake made sure Hanover claimed a point with the equaliser eight minutes from time. On Friday, Pierre-Michel Lasogga struck twice as Hamburg eased their Bundesliga relegation fears with a 2-1 victory at home to Werder Bremen, who remain stuck in the bottom three."

Having ended a 666-minute Bundesliga goal drought dating back to November, Lasogga added a second on 32 minutes when he headed in Matthias Ostrzolek's left-wing cross. Claudio Pizarro won a second-half penalty for Werder after he was fouled by Johan Djourou, but the veteran Peru striker's tame spot-kick was saved by Jaroslav Drobny. Substitute Anthony Ujah gave Bremen a lifeline on 65 minutes after forcing home the ball at the second attempt, but Hamburg held on to move six points clear of the relegation places."
73,19/04/2016,22:29,Mueller double puts Bayern in German Cup final,Bayern Munich took a step towards winning the treble as Thomas Mueller netted twice in Tuesday's 2-0 semi-final win over Werder Bremen to reach the German Cup final.,"Mueller now has 31 goals in all competitions, four in the Cup, as the 26-year-old headed home in the first half, then converted a penalty after a cynical dive from Arturo Vidal. Bayern secured their passage to their 21st final -- on May 21 at Berlin's Olympic Stadium -- as they starved Bremen of the ball with 70 percent possession. Nevertheless, the match-winner was far from pleased with Bayern's performance. ""The most important thing was going through, but we made too many mistakes and it wasn't a pleasant game for us,"" said Mueller. ""We have played better, but it's a nice feeling to be in the final."" The Bavarian giants will face either Borussia Dortmund or Hertha Berlin, who meet in Wednesday's other semi, having already lifted the trophy a record 17 times. It keeps Bayern on course for a repeat of their 2013 treble in what is Pep Guardiola's third and final year of his Munich contract before coaching Manchester City next season. Bayern face a busy few weeks. They play Atletico Madrid away in a week's time in the Champions League semi-final with the return leg in Munich on May 3. They are at Hertha in Berlin on Saturday, with a seven point lead in the Bundesliga and four games left, as they bid to become the first club to win four consecutive Bundesliga titles. This was the clash of Germany's two best cup teams with Bayern and Bremen having won the trophy 23 times between them. In the last 13 years, Bayern have won the Cup seven times. Guardiola named a near full-strength team in front of a crowd of 75,000 although Vidal, Douglas Costa and Thiago Alcantara were on the bench. The hosts needed just half an hour to take the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena when Mueller was left unmarked in the middle of the area to head home Xabi Alonso's corner. But Bremen wasted one of only two first-half chances with 40 minutes gone. Bayern's Manuel Neuer mistimed his clearance straight to Sambou Yatabare, but the Mali midfielder failed with his attempt to lob the Germany goalkeeper. Neuer had to pick the ball out of the Bayern net early in the second half when Bayern defender David Alaba lobbed his own goalkeeper, but the referee whistled for a foul by Fin Bartel. Vidal replaced France winger Kingsley Coman on 67 minutes and the Chile international helped win Bayern a penalty just three minutes later. Bremen defender Janek Sternberg tackled the box-to-box midfielder and Vidal went down in the area, but replays showed he dived without there being any contact. Nevertheless, referee Tobias Stielder pointed to the spot and Mueller drilled home the penalty. Bremen can now concentrate on surviving the relegation battle as they remain in the Bundesliga's bottom three, two points from safety, ahead of Friday's north German derby at Hamburg."

Adler misses out after being sent off for bringing down Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa in last Sunday's 3-0 defeat at second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Coach Bruno Labbadia is waiting on the fitness of striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga, midfielder Albin Ekdal and forward Nicolai Mueller. ""Pierre-Michel has a ligament problem in his knee, with Albin and Nicolai it's muscular, so we'll have to see what comes out of that,"" explained Labbadia. Lasogga had to be replaced after 34 minutes against Dortmund, while Mueller and Ekdal both went off in the second half. Hamburg have won only three of their last ten games, but Bremen are two points from safety having enjoyed a 3-2 win over Champions League quarter-finalists Wolfsburg last Saturday."
75,18/04/2016,14:28,Guardiola insists Bayern focused on Bremen cup semi-final,Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola says their Champions League semi-final must be the last thing on his players' minds when they face Werder Bremen in the German Cup last four on Tuesday.,"Bremen earned their passage to the semi-final clash at Munich's Allianz Arena by beating Bayer Leverkusen 3-1 in the quarter-finals, having also seen off Borussia Moenchengladbach and Cologne. Bayern are chasing a repeat of their 2013 treble and face Atletico Madrid away in the Champions League semi-final, first leg on April 27. With a seven-point lead, and four league games left including Saturday's match at Hertha Berlin, Guardiola's side are poised to make history by becoming the first club to win four straight Bundesliga titles. But Guardiola says his players must blend everything else out against Bremen to book their place in the May 21 final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. ""We can only think of Werder, if we think about Atletico, then Bremen will reach the final, not us,"" said the Spaniard, who is in his third and final season in Munich before leaving to coach Manchester City. ""It's going to be difficult. It's a cup match and anything can happen. ""You can be the better team and still lose, so: 'Look Out!' ""If we think we're already through, then it won't happen. Bayer Leverkusen were the favourites against Bremen and look what happened. ""I am sure Bremen can beat Bayern, so I am not thinking about Atletico and Hertha."" With Borussia Dortmund and Hertha Berlin meeting in Wednesday's other semi-final, Guardiola was dismissive when asked if he would rather face Dortmund in the final. ""I just want to reach the final. What would the Hertha Berlin think when I wished to face Dortmund?"" Bayern routed Bremen 5-0 in the league last month, but the underdogs have nothing to lose. ""You can achieve anything, that's the crucial thing. If we don't have faith, then we won't be able to draw on the power needed. We go to Munich to believe,"" said captain Clemens Fritz. ""We should all look forward to the game and head to Munich with courage. Anything is possible in one game."" Bremen have their top-scorer Claudio Pizarro back from injury. The 37-year-old has scored 15 goals in 27 games this season and Guardiola rates the Peru international, who he coached at Bayern until this season, as 'one of the best strikers' he has worked with. ""The lads like Fritz and Pizarro have enough experience,"" said Bremen coach Viktor Skripnik. ""Everyone knows how difficult it is to reach a final, so we'll have to try everything."""

They host Bremen, who are fighting for survival in Germany's top flight, at the Allianz Arena for a place in the May 21 final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. ""Now comes the important phase of the season,"" said Bayern hot-shot Lewandowski, the Bundesliga's top-scorer with 27 goals this season -- 38 in all competitions. ""We simply have to win after we bowed out against Borussia Dortmund at the same stage. We want to go to Berlin."" Bayern, who have won the German Cup a record 17 times, lost at home to Dortmund on penalties in last season's semi-finals. Borussia are away to Hertha Berlin in the other semi-final on Wednesday. On Saturday, Lewandowski scored twice within 12 minutes in Bayern's 3-0 league win over Schalke 04 having previously gone 390 minutes, and four games, without scoring. Now the Poland hot-shot has turned his sights on Bremen, who are third from bottom in the Bundesliga. ""I'm really pleased,"" he said after refinding his scoring touch. ""I hope I will shoot a few more goals in the coming weeks."" Unusually for him, Lewandowski was on the bench for Bayern's 2-2 draw at Benfica last Wednesday which confirmed their 3-2 aggregate quarter-final win in Europe. ""You can't give hundred percent in every game when you play a game every three days,"" he said. ""Sometimes it's good to stop and then really go for it when you play again."" Dortmund are at Berlin 24 hours later in their semi-final looking to exorcise the bitter disappointment of their of last-gasp 4-3 Europa League defeat at Liverpool. Having bowed out of Europe at the last eight stage, Borussia want to reach this year's German Cup final having lost 3-1 to Wolfsburg in the 2015 edition. Like Lewandowski, Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel said the goal is now to make sure his side beat Hertha to return to Berlin's Olympic Stadium for the final. The Borussia boss rested his stars Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Marco Reus in Sunday's 3-0 league win over Hamburg. He started 17-year-old Felix Passlack at left-back and goal-scorer Christian Pulisic, already a US international who only turns 18 in September on the left wing. ""We had a few changes and initially found it hard work,"" said Tuchel as Colombia striker Adrian Ramos netted twice. ""We're happy with the 3-0 win and now we're looking forward to the German Cup semi-final. The task is clear: we want to reach the final."" Hertha crashed to a 2-1 league defeat at Hoffenheim on Saturday, hardly the ideal preparation as they attempt to reach the German Cup final for the first time since 1993. Hertha coach Pal Dardai lives within a stone's throw of the Olympic Stadium and is desperate to lead his team out for the cup final having always attended as a fan. ""The defeat was a wake-up call for us,"" said Dardai. ""We conceded two goals from dead-ball situations and we have to be very careful that the same thing doesn't happen against Dortmund at home."""
77,09/04/2016,18:49,Bayern win Benfica warm up to go eight points clear,Bayern Munich warmed up for Wednesday's crucial Champions League quarter-final at Benfica with a 3-1 win at Stuttgart on Saturday to maintain their iron-grip on the Bundesliga title race with five games left.,"An own goal from Stuttgart defender Georg Niedermeier and a second-half David Alaba strike put Pep Guardiola's Bayern 2-0 up. Daniel Didavi pulled a goal back for Stuttgart with an hour gone as he recovered from stumbling in the area to chip home while lying on the floor before Brazil winger Douglas Costa blasted in Bayern's late third. The win gave Bayern three more points in their quest to become the first club to win four successive German league titles ahead of their return leg in Benfica with Bayern holding a 1-0 lead. ""Now we need three more (league) wins and a draw in order to create something that no team in Germany has ever managed,"" said Guardiola. Bayern's head coach made five changes from the side which beat Benfica in Munich last Tuesday, but Thomas Mueller came on with only 25 minutes gone to replace Arturo Vidal. The Chilean picked up a rash yellow card for a foul on Didavi and came off as Guardiola looked to boost his midfield. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund at arch-rivals Schalke on Sunday in the Ruhr Valley derby, Bayern took their chance to go eight points clear. But having won their preceding three games by 1-0 margins, this was another laboured display from the Bavarians at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena. ""We had a lot of problems, we attacked well, but we were a bit too lazy and gave away free-kicks and corners,"" added Guardiola. ""We made life complicated for ourselves, but after taking the lead we improved, espcially in the second half, attacking better and the strikers moved more."" Bayern took the lead when Franck Ribery's cross clipped Niedermeier's boot on the way into the Stuttgart net on 31 minutes and the visitors extended their lead when Alaba fired inside the near post on 52 minutes. Mid-table Stuttgart got back in the game when attacking midfielder Didavi, who will play for Wolfsburg next season, managed to lob Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. The goal came despite Didavi being flat on the turf, when the ball fell into his path after a mistimed clearance by Munich striker Robert Lewandowski. In the final ten minutes, Bayern's Thiago hit the crossbar before Costa smashed in their third goal from the edge of the area. Borussia Moenchengladbach stay fourth despite their 1-0 defeat at Ingolstadt. At the bottom, Hoffenheim, coached by 28-year-old Julian Nagelsmann, the youngest ever coach in Germany's top flight, are now three points clear of the relegation places after their 2-0 win at second from bottom Eintracht Frankfurt. Midfielder Nadiem Amiri, who netted just a minute after coming off the bench, and forward Mark Uth scored their second-half goals. Under Nagelsmann, Hoffenheim have now taken 17 points in their last nine games to climb out of the bottom three to 14th. Augsburg escaped the bottom three, and dropped opponents Werder Bremen into the relegation places, with a 2-1 win in north Germany as South Korea defender Hong Jeong-Ho scored their dramatic 87th-minute winner. Mid-table Darmstadt enjoyed a 2-1 win at Hamburg while on Friday Hertha Berlin were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bottom side Hanover."
78,23/03/2016,19:17,Djilobodji has ban for cut-throat gesture reduced,Werder Bremen defender Papy Djilobodji had his three-match ban reduced to two by the German FA on Wednesday after he made a throat-slitting gesture in a Bundesliga game with Mainz.,"On Tuesday, the German FA banned and fined Djilobodji 15,000 euros ($16,757) for unsportsmanlike conduct after pulling his index finger across his throat in the direction of Mainz winger Pablo de Blasis last Saturday. Bremen successfully appealed the decision, arguing that the Senegal international had simply made a bad decision. They desperately need the on-loan Chelsea player to play as many matches as possible in their fight to avoid relegation. ""Papy Djilobodji's ban hits us hard and, of course, represents a blatant competitive disadvantage in the relegation battle,"" explained Werder's CEO Thomas Eichin. ""On top of that, we have to, and want to, protect our player, who has been downright criminalised in public, because of an ill-considered gesture which was certainly unfortunate."" The 27-year-old Djilobodji is set to miss Bremen's trip to Borussia Dortmund after the international break, plus their home match against Augsburg. He is also banned for a further match at Wolfsburg after picking up his fifth yellow card against Mainz, but should return to face Hamburg away at the end of April."
79,22/03/2016,23:55,Djilobodji banned for cut-throat gesture,Werder Bremen defender Papy Djilobodji received a three-match man from the German FA on Tuesday after making a throat-slitting gesture during Saturday's 1-1 draw with Mainz in the Bundesliga.,"Referee Manuel Graefe missed the incident, but German football officials reviewed the matter after Djilobodji pulled his index finger across his throat in the direction of Mainz winger Pablo de Blasis. The Senegal international, who joined on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season in January, is set to miss Bremen's trip to Borussia Dortmund after the international break as well as home games against Augsburg and Wolfsburg. On top of being accused of unsportsmanlike conduct, the 27-year-old also faces a further one-game suspension after picking up his fifth yellow card against Mainz. In November 2009, St Pauli forward Deniz Naki made a similar gesture to Hansa Rostock fans during a German league match and received a three-match ban from the DFB. However, Werder have appealed the decision in a bid to free up Djilobodji as they battle to avoid relegation, with Viktor Skripnik's side just one point above the drop zone with seven games left to play. ""We maintain that the ruling of a three-match ban is unjustifiable. Above all, we believe that, under the circumstances, the severity and the wrongdoing in this case was lesser than that of the Deniz Naki case,"" said Bremen chief executive Thomas Eichin."
80,20/03/2016,15:04,German FA investigate Djilobodji's cut-throat gesture,"The German FA (DFB) said Sunday they are investigating Werder Bremen defender Papy Djilobodji, on loan from Chelsea, for making a throat-cutting gesture at an opponent during a Bundesliga match.","Referee Manuel Graefe missed the incident, but the German FA are looking into the matter after Djilobodji pulled his index finger across his throat in the direction of Mainz winger Pablo de Balsis during the 1-1 draw in Bremen on Saturday. In January, the Senegal international signed on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season. He could now be banned for their next league game at Borussia Dortmund on April 2 with Bremen battling to avoid relegation. In November 2009, St Pauli forward Deniz Naki made a similar gesture to Hansa Rostock fans during a German league match and received a three-match ban by the DFB. Werder coach Viktor Skripnik says Djilobodji has ""a temper"" and expects there to be consequences for his gesture, adding: ""I'll accept whatever comes"". Bremen's director of sport Thomas Eichin says he will speak to the player. ""I'll have a serious talk to him about it and he won't do it again in the future,"" Eichin told Sky. In the same match, Werder's veteran striker Claudio Pizarro, 37, equalled the club's goal-scoring record after netting for the 101st time in the Bremen shirt, converting a penalty after Julian Baumgartlinger had given Mainz a first-half lead. Pizarro's contract expires at the end of the season, but the Peru hot-shot is set to be offered a contract extension by the man whose record he equalled. ""He's also an important person to have in the dressing room and I would be happy if he'd play another year with us, I think the prospects are good,"" said Werder's chairman Marcus Bode, who had set the record of 101 Werder Bremen goals."
81,12/03/2016,20:52,"Muller, Thiago double act sees Bayern blitz Bremen",Thomas Mueller and Thiago Alcantara both netted twice as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich warmed up for their crunch Champions League clash at home to Juventus by blitzing Werder Bremen 5-0 on Saturday.,"With second-placed Borussia Dortmund playing Mainz on Sunday, Pep Guardiola's Bayern took the chance to reopen an eight-point gap. ""People think it's easy to win 5-0, but every game is like a final for us to stay ahead of Dortmund,"" said Guardiola, who rested Dutch star Arjen Robben from the match-day squad. Bayern host Juventus in Europe on Wednesday having drawn their last 16, first-leg 2-2 in Turin after throwing away a two-goal lead. Bremen arrived in Munich buoyed by back-to-back wins over Bayer Leverkusen and bottom side Hanover, but missing three key players. Veteran striker Claudio Pizarro was out with a groin injury while captain Clemens Fritz and dead-ball expert Zlatko Junuzovic were suspended. It took Bayern just nine minutes to take the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena. Kingsley Coman's cross was met by Thiago for his first league goal since February 2014 after a horror run of injuries. Mueller made it 2-0 when he fired Coman's cross home at close-range on 31 minutes. Bremen goalkeeper Felix Wiedwald then blocked Franck Ribery's fierce shot on 66 minutes, but Mueller fired in the rebound. He now has 19 league goals and is third only to Lewandowski (24) and Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (22) in Germany's top flight. Guardiola gave Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze his first league start since October, but it was his replacement Lewandowski who came off the bench to hit Bayern's fourth. Mueller made way for Lewandowski and the Poland striker wasted little time hitting his 34th Bayern goal of the season on 86 minutes. On 90 minutes, Coman produced his third assist of the game as Thiago fired home at the near post to complete the rout. Earlier, Wolfsburg suffered a Champions League hangover with a 1-0 defeat at relegation-threatened Hoffenheim. Wolfsburg reached the last eight in Europe for the first time in the club's history as Tuesday's 1-0 win at home to Gent sealed a 4-2 win on aggregate in the last 16. But Dieter Hecking's side were stunned by second-from-bottom Hoffenheim as Andrej Kramaric, on loan from Leicester City, scored after just three minutes. It could have been more as Kevin Volland had a second-half penalty saved. The defeat leaves Wolfsburg outside the top six while Hoffenheim remain two points from safety. Hoffenheim's win pushed bottom side Hanover 96 closer to relegation as they suffered a 2-0 defeat at home to Cologne with Leonardo Bittencourt scoring both goals. Eintracht Frankfurt's new coach Niko Kovac suffered a 3-0 defeat on his Bundesliga debut at Borussia Moenchengladbach to stay in the relegation places. Kovac, who coached Croatia to the 2014 World Cup and took over after Armin Veh was sacked last Sunday, made four changes to the starting line-up, but his team are winless in eight games. Gladbach's Lars Stindl, Raffael and Mahmoud Dahoud scored the goals as Gladbach climbed to fourth. A foul on South Korea midfielder Ja-Cheol Koo in the dying stages of Augsburg's 2-2 draw at Darmstadt led to his side converting a penalty to take a crucial point. Things remain tight in the relegation battle with three points now separating five teams. Australia striker Mathew Leckie scored only his second goal of the season as he headed home from close range in mid-table Ingolstadt's 3-3 draw at home to Stuttgart. On Friday, Hertha Berlin cemented third place in the table with a 2-0 win over nearest rivals Schalke thanks to goals from Niklas Stark and Vedad Ibisevic."
82,11/03/2016,17:35,Guardiola still 'giving 100%' to Bayern despite move,"Pep Guardiola insisted on Friday that he was ""giving 100% to Bayern Munich until the last day"", after again having his commitment questioned following a mysterious meeting with Manchester City's sporting director in Amsterdam on Monday.","The Spaniard will leave Munich at the end of the season to join up with City, and is aiming to exit Bavaria on a high note by helping Bayern become the first team to win four consecutive Bundesliga titles. ""All who know me know that for the last three years I have concentrated fully and dedicated my work to Bayern from my first day here until the last,"" the 45-year-old said. Guardiola met City director Txiki Begiristain in the Netherlands, but Bayern chairman and legendary former player Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told German daily Bild that ""it is up to him what he does with his day off"". According to Bild, Guardiola also met the agent of Borussia Dortmund's German international midfielder Ilkay Gundogan to discuss the possibility of a future move to Man City. Bayern, who are five points clear of Dortmund at the top of the Bundesliga table, host Werder Bremen on Saturday."
83,11/03/2016,17:03,Pizarro misses Bayern trip with groin injury,"Claudio Pizarro will miss out on a return to the Allianz Arena on Saturday, after the veteran Werder Bremen striker suffered a groin injury ahead of their match against Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich.","""This is obviously a bad shock,"" lamented Bremen coach Viktor Skrypnyk, with his side still in relegation danger despite consecutive 4-1 victories over Bayer Leverkusen and bottom club Hanover 96. The 37-year-old Pizarro is their top scorer this season with 13 goals, and his injury blow comes after hitting a rich vein of form with 10 goals since the winter break. The Peruvian is in his fourth spell at the Weserstadion, and played for Bayern from 2001-2007 and from 2012-15, scoring 125 goals for the Bavarian giants. He left Pep Guardiola's side on a free transfer last summer, but now his highly-anticipated return has failed to materialise. Bayern manager Guardiola had said in the build-up to the game that Pizarro was ""one of the best centre-forwards I have seen and coached in my career"". Pizarro first moved to Germany in 1999 and is the highest foreign goalscorer in Bundesliga history, having netted 187 times in 405 outings."

85,10/03/2016,01:45,Veteran Pizarro fired up for Bayern return,Evergreen Claudio Pizarro is relishing his return to Bayern Munich on Saturday as the 37-year-old can not stop scoring in Germany's top flight.,"The Peru striker is out of contract at Werder Bremen in June, but is enjoying the Indian summer of his career and is Werder's top scorer this season. He has netted 11 league goals this season, scoring five times in his last three games, including a hat-trick in Werder's shock 4-1 thrashing of Bayer Leverkusen last week. Pizarro had two separate stints at Bayern from 2001-2007 and then 2012-2015. He left at the end of last term, returning to Bremen for the fourth time, after Bayern boss Pep Guardiola deemed him surplus to requirements. ""Of course it will be a special game for me against former colleagues at the Allianz Arena,"" he said. ""I hope we can beat Bayern and, best of all, with a goal from me."" With his 38th birthday approaching in October, Pizarro is to Germany's top flight what Ryan Giggs was to England's Premier League. The Welshman retired in 2014, aged 40, having played nearly 700 games for Manchester United, scoring over 100 goals. Pizarro holds the German league records for the most goals (187) and games (405) and has no thoughts of retiring. He even wants to play at the 2018 World Cup in Russia with Peru. While Bayern want to become the first club to win four straight Bundesliga titles, Bremen are just focusing on staying up, as they remain only three points from the relegation play-off place. ""It is important that we look positively ahead, rather than downwards,"" he added. ""It's crucial that we pick up points from game-to-game. ""We're on a good run now and if we keep it up, I am confident we won't slide back towards the bottom."" Bremen have shot up to 13th in the table with back-to-back wins, while Bayern's lead is now five points after defeat to Mainz was followed by a crucial draw with Dortmund. Pizarro's nine goals in the second half of the season means he has scored more times than even Bayern's star striker Robert Lewandowski. ""We're slowly getting used to Claudio scoring in every game, without wanting to, of course, put him under too much pressure,"" said Bremen captain Clemens Fritz. If he needed any extra incentive, his 100 goals for Werder leaves him just one short of the club's record of 101, held by current board member Marco Bode. ""We have nine games left, he'll do it,"" said Bode. ""Perhaps he'll even manage it in Munich."" Bayern's stars certainly know what to expect from the goal-scoring Peruvian when Saturday comes. ""I'm not surprised by him, he's always had these qualities,"" said Bayern winger Arjen Robben on the subject of Pizarro. ""He is a very, very good player and it's a shame that he is playing against us."" And Bayern wing-back Rafinha knows he has his work cut out to contain Pizarro. ""We played together, trained together and virtually lived together, he is experienced and he is still a nuisance on the pitch,"" said the Brazilian. ""It's good and I hope he plays on for a few more years."""
86,05/03/2016,17:51,Wolfsburg warm-up for Gent with Gladbach win,Wolfsburg warmed up for their Champions League clash at home to Gent with a 2-1 Bundesliga win over Borussia Moenchengladach on Saturday as Germany midfielder Julian Draxler scored again.,"The win moved Wolfsburg up to seventh ahead of the visit of Gent on Tuesday, with the Germans leading 3-2 from the last 16, first leg tie in Belgium. Later on Saturday, second-placed Borussia Dortmund host leaders Bayern Munich in a mouth-watering clash. Draxler, who also netted in Wolfsburg's 4-0 drubbing of bottom side Hanover 96 on Tuesday, opened the scoring at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena. The attacking midfielder claimed his fourth goal in his last four games when he crashed home Andre Schuerrle's final pass with 15 minutes gone. His Germany team-mate Max Kruse added a second just two minutes later as the hosts raced into a 2-0 lead. Gladbach, who dropped to fifth, pulled a goal back when Brazilian striker Raffael claimed his 12th goal of the season on 23 minutes. Bayer Leverkusen came back from 3-0 down to avoid a fourth straight league defeat in their 3-3 draw at Augsburg. Augsburg's South Korea striker Koo Ja-Cheol scored his first hat-trick in Germany's top flight to put the hosts 3-0 up mid-way through the second-half. Koo, playing his sixth season in Germany after spells at Wolfsburg and Mainz, wrapped up his hat-trick inside the hour. Leverkusen fought back with goals by Karim Bellarabi and an own goal from Augsburg's Dutch defender Paul Verhaegh on 80 minutes. In the dying stages, defender Jeffrey Gouweleeuw used his hands to block a shot which saw the referee point straight to the penalty spot. Augsburg were denied a first win over Leverkusen at the tenth attempt when Hakan Calhanoglu converted the 92nd-minute spot kick as Gouweleeuw was sent off. Leverkusen's suspended coach Roger Schmidt was in Spain to watch Villarreal ahead of their Europa League last 16, first leg trip on Thursday. Having shocked Leverkusen 4-1 on Wednesday when Claudio Pizarro scored a hat-trick, Werder Bremen pulled further away from the relegation zone with a 4-1 thrashing at home to bottom side Hanover 96. The 37-year-old Pizarro claimed his fourth goal in two games, and his 11th league goal of the season, when he flicked the ball over his shoulder, beating three defenders, and rifled home on 26 minutes. He then provided an assist as Czech international Gebre Selassie added Bremen's third on 56 minutes. Stuttgart are now up to mid-table after their 5-1 thrashing of second-from-bottom Hoffenheim as defender Georg Niedermeier netted twice. Hoffenheim, under coach Julian Nagelsmann, 28, the youngest coach in Bundesliga history, remain four points from safety with nine games left. Schalke are fourth after their 3-1 win at Cologne thanks to goals from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Max Meyer and Argentina striker Franco di Santo who scored straight after coming off the bench."
87,04/03/2016,02:10,Dortmund out to trim Bayern's lead in showdown,Germany's top two clubs go head to head on Saturday with hosts Borussia Dortmund out to ignite the Bundesliga title race by further trimming the lead of Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich.,"Bayern seemed to be running away with a fourth straight league title, and enjoyed an eight-point lead over second-placed Dortmund, until Mainz slammed on the brakes with a shock 2-1 win at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday. It was only Bayern's second league defeat of the season. Dortmund's 2-0 win at Darmstadt the same night meant Bayern's lead was cut to five points and adds spice to an already mouth-watering clash at Borussia's Signal Iduna Park, but the Bavarians remain favourites. When the sides met last October, Bayern dealt Dortmund a 5-1 thrashing in Munich. Bayern have won four of the last five league meetings including victories in both of their last two visits to Dortmund. Dortmund's single Bundesliga victory over Bayern in the last four years was a 3-0 thumping in Munich in April 2014 when Guardiola's side had already won the league title with a record seven games to spare. But for the first time in his three seasons at Bayern, Guardiola has a league rival breathing down his neck. ""This Borussia Dortmund team is completely different to the last three years,"" said the Spaniard after losing to Mainz. ""We will have to fight until the last game and the last second."" The Dortmund camp has sniffed weakness in their rivals. ""Let's not beat about the bush -- we want to cut the gap to two points,"" said Dortmund captain Mats Hummels. ""Saturday's going to be a brilliant game, we'll be really up for it."" Guardiola has a longer injury list than Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, who is only missing centre-back Sokratis from his first-choice line-up. Injuries to Jerome Boateng, Javi Martinez and Holger Badstuber have forced Guardiola to convert left-back David Alaba into a centre-back alongside Mehdi Benatia. But Guardiola has an embarrassment of riches in midfield with Franck Ribery back from injury and Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze unable to get a game. Whether he plays or not, Goetze, like fellow ex-Borussia star Robert Lewandowski, can expect a another hostile reception from home fans on his return to Dortmund. A sub-plot to the showdown sees the league's top three scorers shooting it out in Dortmund. Bayern's Lewandowski tops the list with 23 goals in his 23 games while Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is just one behind with 22. Munich's Thomas Mueller has also scored a highly respectable 17 league goals. Between them, Mueller and Lewandowski have 40 league goals. They are just 14 short of the league record partnership of 54 set by Wolfsburg pair Edin Dzeko and Grafite in 2009. ""You sometimes get games (like the Mainz defeat), but it will be different in Dortmund,"" promised Lewandowski ominously. There will be a relegation battle royale when Werder Bremen, who stunned Bayer Leverkusen 4-1 on Wednesday thanks to veteran Claudio Pizarro's hat-trick, host bottom side Hanover 96. Bremen remain just one place above the bottom three while Hanover, who have playmaker Hiroshi Kiyotake back from injury, are seven points from safety and desperately need to win. Second-bottom Hoffenheim will be looking to build on their 2-1 win over Augsburg when they travel to Stuttgart, who are winless in their last three games after a surge which carried them up to mid-table. Fixtures (all times 1430 GMT unless stated)"
88,02/03/2016,22:42,Bayern lose perfect home record to give Dortmund hope,"Bayern Munich suffered a shock 2-1 defeat to Mainz on Wednesday, losing their 100 percent home record this season, as their lead in the Bundesliga was trimmed to five points.","The result shakes up the title race ahead of Saturday's crunch clash when Pep Guardiola's Bayern play at second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba came off the bench to seal only Mainz's second victory in Munich with the winner on 86 minutes to finish off a counter-attack. ""We had our chances and then let them counter-attack. We shouldn't have allowed that to happen,"" fumed Bayern's goal-scorer Arjen Robben. Mainz took a shock lead at the Allianz Arena when Spanish winger Jairo fired home in the first-half with the Bayern defence well beaten. Robben pulled a goal back for the Bavarians on 64 minutes. Despite Mainz managing only 22 percent of possession, Cordoba grabbed the late winner and was mobbed by his team-mates. ""We knew how we could win here with a strong defensive display and a good counter-attack,"" said Mainz coach Martin Schmidt, who praised his side's 'outstanding display'. ""It feels really good."" Dortmund's 2-0 win at Darmstadt on Wednesday cut Bayern's lead from eight points to five as another Colombia striker, Adrian Ramos, and defender Erik Durm netted. ""We and Bayern both know that things can now be a bit tight. We want to win the thing,"" said Dortmund's Germany defender Durm. Hertha Berlin cemented third place, but remain 15 points adrift of Dortmund, with a 2-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the capital. Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou and Mitchell Weiser scored to keep Hertha on course for a first return to the Champions League since 2000. At the other end of the table, Werder Bremen climbed out of the relegation places with a shock 4-1 win at Bayer Leverkusen as veteran Claudio Pizarro claimed a hat-trick. The 37-year-old Peru international showed why he is the Bundesliga's top scoring foreigner by needing just under half an hour to wrap up his hat-trick which included a penalty. Having knocked Leverkusen out of the German Cup in the quarter-finals last month, Bremen again humbled Bayer. Roger Schmidt's Leverkusen has now lost four of their last five games in all competitions and drop to seventh in the league. Elsewhere Schalke climbed to sixth with a 3-2 comeback win at home to Hamburg while Borussia Moenchengladbach remain fourth after their 4-0 thrashing at home to Stuttgart. Second-from-bottom Hoffenheim boosted their survival chances with a 2-1 win over Augsburg. On Tuesday, Germany winger Andre Schuerrle claimed the first Bundesliga hat-trick of his career as Wolfsburg routed bottom side Hanover 96 4-0 away. March 1 is a lucky day for Schuerrle who also scored a hat-trick for ex-club Chelsea against Fulham in the Premier League exactly two years ago. His performance will boost his standing at Wolfsburg and in this one game he has scored more goals than in his previous 33 matches for the Champions League side. He needed just 26 minutes to score three goals before Germany team-mate Julian Draxler added Wolfsburg's fourth at Hanover's HDI Arena. The win leaves Wolfsburg eighth while Hanover are bottom, four points from their nearest rival and seven points from safety. The German FA (DFB) is expected to fine both clubs after one of the flares fired from the away fan block hit the Hanover bench before kick-off, but no-one was hurt. Elsewhere, French striker Anthony Modeste rescued a point for Cologne in their 1-1 draw at Ingolstadt after forward Lukas Hinterseer had given the hosts the lead."
89,13/02/2016,17:48,Mkhitaryan seals Dortmund win to trim Bayern lead,Henrikh Mkhitaryan's superb second-half goal sealed Borussia Dortmund's 1-0 win over Hanover 96 on Saturday to trim Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the Bundesliga to five points.,"Dortmund were without injured star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who missed his first league match of the season having netted 20 goals in as many league games. In his absence, Mkhitaryan showed superb individual skill for the winner at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park. With Marcel Schmelzer screaming up in support on his left, Mkhitaryan cut back inside and curled his right-footed shot around Hanover's Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler on 57 minutes. With Pep Guardiola's Bayern at Augsburg on Sunday, Dortmund remain second while Hanover are rooted to the bottom, seven points from safety. Wolfsburg warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League, last 16, first-leg at Ghent with a 2-0 win at home to Ingolstadt to pick up their first victory since knocking Manchester United out of Europe in December. Dieter Hecking's Wolfsburg won for the first time in six games but stay eighth after first-half goals goals by Germany midfielder Julian Draxler and defender Robin Knoche. Bayer Leverkusen moved up from seventh to third as they bounced back from their shock German Cup exit at the hands of Werder Bremen in mid-week with a 2-1 comeback win at Darmstadt. On a heavy pitch, Sandro Wagner stabbed the ball home to give Darmstadt an early lead, despite Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno catching him around the throat with his forearm. Leverkusen drew level when Darmstadt defender Aytac Sulu headed into his own net on 62 minutes. The visitors then took the lead with a sweeping move which went the length of the pitch. From a Darmstadt corner, junior Julian Brandt started the move he finished by tapping home Kevin Kampl's final pass for the winner on 77 minutes. VfB Stuttgart's impressive form continued as they picked up their fifth-straight league win to go ninth with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin. A long-range strike from Ivory Coast defensive midfielder Serey Die and a second-half goal from left-wing Filip Kostic sealed the hosts' win. Hertha suffered their first defeat in nine games since losing 2-0 at Bayern in November to drop to fourth. The youngest manager in Bundesliga history made his debut when Julian Nagelsmann, 28, was on Hoffenheim's bench for their 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen in the basement battle. Nagelsmann took over after predecessor Huub Stevens resigned on Wednesday due to heart problems. Despite Hoffenheim taking the lead on 10 minutes through Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric, Werder hit back three minutes later as former Chelsea defender Papy Djilobodji scored his first Bremen goal. The result leaves both teams in the relegation places."

Aubameyang has now scored in each of Dortmund's last seven German Cup games, dating back to the start of last season, having also netted in Dortmund's 3-1 Cup final defeat to Wolfsburg last May. ""Auba knows how to take his chances and he works hard on his finishing every day,"" said Reus. ""It's fun to play alongside him."" Dortmund are in the semi-finals for the third season in a row while spirited Stuttgart had their five-match winning streak, dating back to mid-December, ended. Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich will attempt to join Dortmund in the last four when they play VfL Bochum on Wednesday while minnows Heidenheim host Hertha Berlin. Dortmund took the lead at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena when Reus fired home off the crossbar with just five minutes gone. Stuttgart fought back and levelled when Lukas Rupp's shot deflected off Mkhitaryan and into the Dortmund net on 21 minutes to the home fans' delight. The visitors regained the lead when Reus set up Aubameyang for his 30th in all competitions, on 31 minutes as Stuttgart failed to cope with Dortmund's pace. With time running out, Aubameyang broke clear and pulled Stuttgart goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak off his line to allow Mkhitaryan a simple tap-in on 89 minutes. Earlier, veteran Claudio Pizarro helped seal Werder Bremen's 3-1 quarter-final win at ten-man Bayer Leverkusen by playing a key role in their shock victory. There was a strong Latin American flavour at Leverkusen's BayArena as Bremen booked their place in April's semi-finals. Mexico's Javier Hernandez put Leverkusen ahead, then Bremen's Argentinian centre-back Santiago Garcia levelled before Brazilian defender Wendell was sent off for Bayer just before the half-time break. After Wendall's dismissal, Peru's 37-year-old striker Pizarro scored Bremen's second by converting the resulting penalty, then set up their third. ""We did very well defensively and we reacted as a unit after conceding a goal,"" beamed Pizarro. ""Now we get to go further in the Cup."" Leverkusen took the lead when ex-Manchester United forward Hernandez continued his record of scoring in each round of the cup. It was his 22nd goal for Bayer this season in all competitions. After Stefan Kiessling was up-ended by Bremen's Spanish defender Alejandro Galvez in the area, 'Chicharito' rifled home the resulting penalty in the 22nd minute. The lead lasted nine minutes as Bremen's Argentinian centre-back Santiago Garcia put Werder level by hitting the bottom left-hand corner of Leverkusen's net to make it 1-1. Disaster struck for the hosts when Wendell was shown a straight red for hauling down Bartels, who was through on goal, just before the break The 37-year-old Pizarro, who last weekend became the first foreign player to make 400 Bundesliga appearances, hit his eighth goal of the season. Pizarro then played a big part in Bremen's third as his shot was saved by Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno, but Florian Grillitsch tapped home the rebound on 82 minutes."

92,04/02/2016,13:47,Gladbach out to beat Bremen with the 'ketchup effect',Borussia Moenchengladbach hope a home win over Werder Bremen on Friday will give them the necessary 'ketchup effect' to turn results around after the bitter taste of successive Bundesliga defeats.,"Gladbach started the year fourth in the table, but January defeats at home to Borussia Dortmund and away to Mainz saw Andre Schubert's side drop to sixth and in danger of slipping out of the European places. They were bottom of the table when Schubert took over in September after five straight defeats, but rocketed up the table by going unbeaten in Schubert's first 10 league games from mid-September to December. ""Our recent games have gone very differently to how things went in the first half of the season,"" admitted sports director Max Eberl, with Gladbach having won just one of their last six games since their stunning 3-1 home win against leaders Bayern Munich in early December. Gladbach lost 1-0 away to Mainz in Germany's top flight last Friday after wasting a string of chances while the hosts scored on a rare foray into the Borussia half. ""If we're being honest, we have to talk about having had 'a false start',"" goalkeeper Yann Sommer said about Gladbach's two defeats at the start of 2016. Norwegian defender Havard Nordtveit used an unusual phrase to explain that if Gladbach put in the same effort against Bremen as they did at Mainz, they stand a good chance of getting back to winning ways. ""If we again work hard, then we'll have the 'ketchup effect' against Bremen,"" he said. ""That's when everything all comes out at once. ""I am sure we will take the three points from the game against Bremen."" Viktor Skripnik's Bremen are third from bottom, but have shown plenty of fight in the relegation battle. Werder returned from the winter break by beating Schalke 3-1 away, then fought back with two late goals from Peru veteran Claudio Pizarro to earn a 3-3 draw at home to third-placed Hertha Berlin last Saturday. And Bremen have nothing to fear having already beaten Gladbach 2-1 at home last August in the league, then enjoying a dramatic 4-3 win at Borussia Park in the last 16 of the German Cup in December. ""They will certainly respect us, as we have beaten them twice this season already,"" said Bremen midfielder Fin Bartels. ""Let's see if we can't present something new there."""
93,03/02/2016,12:41,Pizzaro ditches pizzas to reach league milestone,"Veteran Claudio Pizarro, 37, says ditching treats like chocolate and pizzas helped put him on the verge of becoming the first foreigner to reach the milestone of 400 Bundesliga games.","The evergreen Peru striker could reach the mark when strugglers Werder Bremen play at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday. In a bid to extend his career, Pizarro started working last August with Italian nutritionist Giuliano Poser, who also advises Barcelona's superstar Lionel Messi. Foods such as sugar, pasta and white bread are now taboo, which has left former Chelsea and Bayern Munich forward Pizarro in top form despite his advancing years. He scored both of his side's late goals last Saturday as Bremen's came back from 3-1 down to draw 3-3 at home to Hertha Berlin -- and promptly rewarded himself with a rare taste of chocolate. ""I miss chocolate so much,"" he admitted, but says his new diet has given him more energy. ""I feel better and have lost two or three kilos."" His tally of 399 appearances and 181 goals is already a Bundesliga record for a foreigner and he hopes to reach the 400 mark at Gladbach's Borussia Park. ""Of course, this is very special for me. It's not something you experience every day,"" said Pizarro. The Peruvian only has a contact with Bremen until the end of the season, but he has no plans to retire and his dream is to represent his country at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Bremen's sports director Thomas Eichin plans to talk to Pizarro about a possible extension, but for now the priority is staying in Germany's top flight with Werder third from bottom and currently in the relegation places. For now potatoes, tomatoes and cow's milk are also off the menu as Pizarro looks to stay as fit as possible to help keep Bremen up. ""If I want to still play, that's how it has to be,"" he says. Despite having been used mainly off the bench, as back-up for Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah, Pizarro has already scored five goals in 16 games this season and has helped develop his team-mates. ""I can still learn a lot from him,"" said Ujah."

""Sambou is tall, powerful, dynamic and courageous, but like any new player he will need time to adjust,"" said Bremen's director of sport Thomas Eichin. ""He is a player both the coach and I wanted to sign. He was number one on our list and we are pleased the transfer has come off."" Bremen, who are third from bottom, host third-placed Hertha Berlin in Germany's top flight on Saturday, which comes too soon for Yatabare to feature. Tremmel, 37, was born in Munich and boasts 125 Bundesliga appearances with SpVgg Unterhaching (in 2000/01), Hannover 96, Hertha Berlin and Energie Cottbus. He has been brought in as cover for first-choice shot-stopper Felix Wiedwald, with reserve goalkeepers Michael Zetterer and Raphael Wolf struggling with injuries. ""We needed to reinforce in goal,"" explained Eichin. ""Gerhard Tremmel is a goalkeeper with a huge amount of experience who will support our young goalkeepers and Felix Wiedwald."" Meanwhile, Bremen has sent Germany star Toni Kroos' brother Felix, who made eight league appearances this season, on loan to Berlin-based FC Union, who are mid-table in the second division. The Bundesliga's winter transfer window closes at 1800 local time (1700 GMT) on February 1."
95,24/01/2016,20:00,"Wolfsburg, Schalke crash to shock defeats",Eintracht Frankfurt captain Alexander Meier hit a hat-trick as Champions League side Wolfsburg lost 3-2 away while Schalke also crashed as Sunday yielded two shock Bundesliga defeats.,"Wolfsburg, who face Ghent in the last 16 of the Champions League, are seventh, outside next season's European places, after the Frankfurt defeat. Schalke are sixth after losing 3-1 at home to relegation-threatened Werder Bremen. After Wolfsburg's Germany winger Andre Schuerrle hit a late equaliser in Frankfurt, Wolves were heading for a 2-2 draw before Meier struck a late dramatic winner. Wolfsburg took an early lead when centre-back Dante slotted home on 25 minutes, but Meier, last season's top scorer in Germany's top flight, took advantage of poor Wolfsburg defending. He equalised on 66 minutes, then put his side ahead on 73 minutes before Schuerrle levelled six minutes later. But Meier produced his third goal, from just his third shot, three minutes into added time as Wolfsburg were punished for woeful defending. The result left Wolfsburg seventh, with Eintracht 14th, and means Wolves are winless in their three games since beating Manchester United in their final Champions League group game. Another German league shock then followed in Gelsenkirchen when Schalke crashed despite taking a fourth-minute lead through Cameroon defender Joel Matip from a corner. Bremen remain in the bottom three despite picking up only their fifth win of the season with goals by captain Clemens Fritz, former Bayern and Chelsea striker Claudio Pizarro and Nigeria's Anthony Ujah. Veterans ruled at the Veltins Arena as Fritz, 35, equalised, then turned provider by setting up the 37-year-old Pizarro for his 178th German league goal in his 397th Bundesliga match on 54 minutes. And Fritz again provided the final pass for Ujah to hit Bremen's third, and his eighth of the season, just a minute from time. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund consolidated second place with a convincing 3-1 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach to trim Bayern Munich's runaway lead. Goals by Dortmund's Marco Reus, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Ilkay Gundogan, with a consolation from Gladbach's Raffael, sealed the win. It left Dortmund both eight points behind Bayern and eight points ahead of third-placed Hertha Berlin, who were held to a goalless draw at home to Augsburg in the capital. It was only Gladbach's second league defeat since Andre Schubert took charge last September with the team bottom of the table. They stay fourth. On Friday, Bayern kicked-off the second half of the season with a 2-1 win at Hamburg thanks to Robert Lewandowski's two goals. At the other end of the table on Saturday, veteran Portugal striker Hugo Almeida marked his debut for relegation-threatened Hanover 96 with a goal. But he was unable to prevent their 2-1 defeat at home to Darmstadt as Sandro Wagner scored both of the visitors' goals. The defeat left Hanover bottom as ex-Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf took charge of his first game since replacing Michael Frontzeck over the winter break. Darmstadt are 12th. Stuttgart left the relegation places with a 3-1 win at Cologne as Jurgen Kramny picked up his second straight win having been given the head coach role full-time. Bayer Leverkusen stay fifth after their 1-1 draw at Hoffenheim as Jiloan Hamad's goal for the hosts was cancelled out by Leverkusen captain Omer Toprak's late strike. Ingolstadt, who are in their first season in Germany's top flight, earned a 1-0 win at home to Mainz through a Moritz Hartmann penalty to go tenth."
96,13/12/2015,19:49,Aubameyang strikes as Dortmund rout Frankfurt,Borussia Dortmund set a new club record in routing ten-man Eintracht Frankfurt 4-1 on Sunday as the Bundesliga's top-scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored his 18th goal in 16 games.,"Second-placed Dortmund's victory gave them a club record seventh win and one draw at home, their best start to a season, as Thomas Tuchel's side came from behind to floor strugglers Frankfurt. Eintracht took the lead when captain Alexander Meier finished off a counter-attack on seven minutes before Henrikh Mkhitaryan equalised for Dortmund on 24 minutes. Frankfurt were reduced to ten-men when midfielder Slobodan Medojevic was sent off for fouling Gonzalo Castro in the area on 44 minutes, but Aubameyang drove the resulting penalty wide as it finished 1-1 at the break. Aubameyang made amends for his earlier miss by converting Shinji Kagawa's pass on 57 minutes while Dortmund captain Mats Hummels made it 3-1 with a long-range strike just four minutes later. Shortly before the final whistle, Adrian Ramos grabbed Dortmund's fourth just minutes after coming off the bench to seal the victory which left Dortmund five points short of leaders Bayern Munich. Aubameyang is on course to break Gerd Mueller's record of 40 Bundesliga goals in a single season. At the same stage of the 1971/72 season, Mueller had scored 17 goals for Bayern Munich. Earlier, Brazilian winger Caiuby hit a late winner as struggling Augsburg shocked Schalke 2-1. Hosts Augsburg took the lead when Dominik Kohr's strike from outside the area cannoned off Hong Jeong-Ho to wrong-foot Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann on 34 minutes. It was centre-back Hong's first Bundesliga goal in his third season with Augsburg and Sead Kolasinac equalised before Caiuby fired home at the far post in the 92nd minute to give Augsburg their first home league win since September and lift them up to 13th. Schalke drop to eighth with just one league win in their last seven games to put pressure on coach Andre Breitenreiter. On Saturday, Robert Lewandowski and Philipp Lahm netted as leaders Bayern Munich laboured to a 2-0 win against Ingolstadt to get back on track after last week's shock defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Gladbach crashed to their first defeat in 11 league games under coach Andre Schubert in a 5-0 hammering at Bayer Leverkusen, for whom Javier Hernandez claimed a hat-trick. 'Chicharito' needed just 13 second-half minutes to score his three goals with ex-Germany striker Stefan Kiessling also scoring either side of half-time for Leverkusen, who are sixth after only their second win in their last nine games. Gladbach are fifth. Hertha Berlin took the chance to leapfrog Gladbach into third when they romped to a 4-0 win at Darmstadt as Bosnia striker Vedad Ibisevic scored twice, Marvin Plattenhardt hit a free-kick and Salomon Kalou netted a fourth. Fresh from Tuesday's Champions League win over Manchester United, which confirmed their place in the last 16 as group winners, fourth-placed Wolfsburg laboured to a 1-1 draw at home to Hamburg. Werder Bremen continue to hover just above the relegation places after a 1-1 draw at home to Cologne as Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah had a first-half penalty saved for the hosts. Hoffenheim enjoyed their first win since September when Jonathan Schmid's first-half goal sealed their 1-0 win at home to Hanover 96 which lifted them to 17th. Stuttgart are bottom again after their goalless draw at Mainz on Friday."
97,28/11/2015,17:54,Bayern extend Hertha's 38-year wait,Bayern Munich went 11 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin who have now gone 38 years without a win at the German giants.,"With second-placed Borussia Dortmund hosting VfB Stuttgart on Sunday, Bayern took the chance to extend their lead with first-half goals by Germany forward Thomas Mueller and France Under-21 winger Kingsley Coman. Bayern show no signs of loosening their iron-grip on the Bundesliga title as they picked up their 13th win from 14 league games to give them 40 from a possible 42 points. This was the first time in eight home games that Bayern failed to score at least four goals. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola experimented with the starting line-up by pushing Germany centre-back Jerome Boateng into a midfield role, which led to their second goal. They took the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena when Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal's cross found Medhi Benatia, whose shot was heading wide, but Mueller was on hand to head home on 34 minutes. Bayern doubled their lead on 41 minutes when Boateng lobbed the ball into Javi Martinez, whose pass found Coman and the French winger did the rest to make it 2-0 at the break. Hertha, who last won in Munich in 1977, are in fifth place after Borussia Moechengladbach leap-frogged them into fourth with a 3-3 draw at Hoffenheim. Gladbach's head coach Andre Schubert preserved his nine-game unbeaten record in the lead since taking charge two months ago. Borussia took an early lead thanks to USA international Fabian Johnson, who then scored their equaliser to rescue a point. Hoffenheim, chasing their first win since September, took a 3-1 lead just after the break thanks to goals by Steven Zuber, Eugen Polanski and Nadiem Amiri. But Swiss striker Josip Drmic pulled it back to 3-2 for Gladbach before Johnson claimed his second with a superb shot three minutes from time. Hamburg are up to sixth after their 3-1 win at Werder Bremen in the north German derby. Hamburg raced into an early 2-0 lead as Croatia midfielder Ivo Ilicevic scored on their opening attack, then striker Michael Gregoritsch doubled their lead on 26 minutes. Nigeria's Anthony Ujah pulled a goal back for Werder on 62 minutes, then Germany forward Nicolai Mueller made it 3-1 to Hamburg on 68 minutes when Ilicevic's final pass put him in behind the hosts' defence. Hanover eased the pressure on coach Michael Frontzeck with a 4-0 thumping at home to Ingolstadt which lifted them up to 14th and pulled them away from the relegation zone. Japan striker Yoshinori Muto scored his seventh goal of the season in Mainz's 2-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. His forward partner Yunus Malli added their second to claim his eighth while Frankfurt had captain Alex Meier sent off for a second yellow card."

The Germans still have every chance of qualifying for the knock-out stages and consolidated third in the German league table by hammering Bremen. There was a minute's silence at all Bundesliga grounds this weekend -- the players also wore black armbands -- out of respect for the victims of the Paris terror attacks. Stuttgart's 4-0 thumping at home to Augsburg was delayed by 15 minutes due to the tightened security checks at stadiums across the country. There were no such problems at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena as Bremen gifted their hosts the opener when defender Alejandro Galvez slid the ball into his own net on 11 minutes. Kruse put Wolfsburg 2-0 up at the break by heading home a free-kick then Portugal international Vierinha scored from the right wing on 56 minutes. The floodgates opened when French defensive midfielder, on for the injured Brazil star Luiz Gustavo, stabbed home his shot on 67 minutes. Kruse then set up Netherlands striker Bas Dost on 78 minutes before completing the scoring three minutes from time by converting a cross from Germany team-mate Andre Schuerrle to leave him with five league goals for the season. The result leaves Wolfsburg five points behind second-placed Borussia Dortmund who lost 3-1 at Hamburg on Friday night, while leaders Bayern Munich play at Schalke on Saturday evening. Ex-Manchester United star Javier Hernandez now has 12 goals for Bayer Leverkusen in all competitions after scoring twice in their 3-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Christmas came early for 'Chicharito' in Frankfurt when Eintracht centre-back David Abraham allowed a cross to roll between his legs and the grateful Hernandez stabbed home on 11 minutes. The Mexico striker doubled his tally on 39 minutes when a Hakan Calhanoglu pass split the Frankfurt defence. Hernandez did the rest, but it finished 2-1 at the break when Serbian midfielder Slobodan Medojevic slammed in a powerful header on the stroke of half-time. Calhanoglu made sure of the three points by scoring Leverkusen's third on 72 minutes. Augsburg climbed off the bottom of the table with an emphatic 4-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. Woeful defending by the hosts allowed Augsburg to race into an early 2-0 lead with both goals by midfielder Alexander Esswein. Defender Jan-Ingwer Callsen-Bracker grabbed a third before former South Korea captain Koo Ja-Cheol scored Augsburg's fourth when he hit the top right-hand corner from 10 metres out on 54 minutes. The Rhine derby finished goalless as Mainz drew at Cologne as the hosts abandoned plans to play in a special-edition carnival-themed shirt out of respect for those who died in Paris."
99,31/10/2015,18:00,Dortmund trim Bayern's lead with win at Bremen,Second-placed Borussia Dortmund closed the gap behind German league leaders Bayern Munich to five points on Saturday as Marco Reus netted twice in their 3-1 win at Werder Bremen.,"Reus fired in the opening and third goals, but Borussia should have won by more as Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang squandered three clear chances. Right winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan capped a superb display with Dortmund's second having provided the final pass for both of Reus' goals. After Bayern were held to a goalless draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday, Dortmund took the chance to trim the Bavarian giants' lead. They have now scored 18 goals in their last four games and a staggering 64 in 20 games this season under new coach Thomas Tuchel. Dortmund opened the scoring after nine minutes when Mkhitaryan fired in a cross, Aubameyang let the ball roll to Reus, who fired home at the far post. Bremen levelled when Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah tapped home on 32 minutes after Matthias Ginter cleared off the line. A superb cross off the offside of the boot from Mats Hummels found Mkhitaryan at the far post just before the break to head home on 44 minutes. Reus added a third after Mkhitaryan's final pass split the defence as the defeat left Bremen 14th in the table. Borussia Moenchengladbach earned their sixth straight victory to go fourth with a 4-1 win at Hertha Berlin having been bottom in September with five defeats. Gladbach blitzed Hertha with two goals in as many first-half minutes at Berlin's Olympic Stadium from left-back Oscar Wendt, plus a solo effort from Brazil striker Raffael. Gladbach grabbed a third when Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka drilled home a penalty on 55 minutes after Ivory Coast winger Ibrahima Traore was fouled in the area. Alexander Baumjohann converted a late penalty for Hertha after being fouled before Havard Nordtveit grabbed Gladbach's fourth in added time. The result boosts Gladbach ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match at home to 2015 finalists Juventus while Hertha drop to sixth. Gladbach are now just two points behind Schalke, who needed a late Leroy Sane equaliser in their 1-1 draw at home to Ingolstadt after the Bavarian visitors took a shock first-half lead. Bochum-born Cameroon internationals Joel and Marvin Matip faced each other for the first time with Joel at centre-back for Schalke while Marvin captained Ingolstadt. Huub Stevens picked up a point in his first game as coach of Hoffenheim in their goalless draw at Cologne. Caretaker coach Stevens has been tasked with keeping second-from-bottom Hoffenheim in order for 28-year-old Julian Nagelsmann to make history next season as the Bundesliga's youngest head coach. Japan striker Yoshinori Muto claimed a hat-trick to rescue a dramatic point for mid-table Mainz in their 3-3 draw at bottom side Augsburg. Having given Mainz a 2-0 lead before Augsburg roared back with three unanswered goals, Muto saved his best for last with a 93rd-minute strike."
100,17/10/2015,18:19,Relentless Bayern make it record nine in a row,Bayern Munich became the first team to win their opening nine games of a Bundesliga season on Saturday as a first-half Thomas Mueller strike proved enough for Pep Guardiola's side to beat Werder Bremen 1-0.,"Mueller stole in front of Alejandro Galvez to control a Thiago Alcantara cross at the near post and stab past Felix Wiedwald for the only goal of the game, his ninth of the season, at the Weserstadion as Bayern made more Bundesliga history. That was despite in-form Robert Lewandowski, having netted 15 times in his previous six games for club and country, for once failing to score. However, the Pole felt he should have had a penalty in the second half after being taken out by Wiedwald when through on goal, and Mueller's solitary strike sufficed to condemn Bremen to a club record-equalling fifth consecutive defeat. The win, their 999th in the Bundesliga, set Bayern up nicely for their trip to face Arsenal in the Champions League in midweek and saw them once again move seven points clear at the top of the table from nearest challengers Borussia Dortmund, who won 2-0 at Mainz on Friday. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel returned to face his former club and saw Marco Reus put the visitors in front in the first half. The Germany star then had a second-half penalty saved but Henrikh Mkhitaryan made sure of the three points late on as Borussia bounced back from their 5-1 hiding at the hands of Bayern in their last outing to register a first win in five. Germany striker Max Kruse scored his first career hat-trick as Wolfsburg climbed up to fourth with a dramatic 4-2 win at home to Hoffenheim at the Volkswagen Arena. Dieter Hecking was taking charge of a Bundesliga game for the 300th time and saw his side open the scoring with just 41 seconds played when Julian Draxler squared for Kruse to score. Draxler then crossed for Bas Dost to head in the second goal inside seven minutes but Hoffenheim fought back, Jeremy Toljan reducing the deficit before Jonathan Schmid converted at the second attempt to level matters on 54 minutes. But Kruse, who came off the bench to score the winner for Germany against Georgia in Euro 2016 qualifying last weekend, put the Wolves back in front from a Luiz Gustavo assist just after the hour mark and then completed his hat-trick late on. Schalke 04 are third, just a point behind their Ruhr rivals Dortmund, after Max Meyer struck a stoppage-time winner to see off Hertha Berlin 2-1. Benedikt Hoewedes had earlier headed the Royal Blues in front but Salomon Kalou's 73rd-minute header looked set to earn Hertha a share of the spoils. Meanwhile, Bayer Leverkusen were held to a 0-0 draw at Hamburg and promoted Darmstadt's good start to life in the top half continued with a 2-0 victory at Augsburg. Sandro Wagner and Peter Niemeyer both netted in the first half as Darmstadt climbed into the top half of the table and left Augsburg, who are in this season's Europa League, third from bottom. Eintracht Frankfurt host Borussia Moenchengladbach in Saturday's late game before Cologne entertain Hanover 96 and Ingolstadt go to bottom club VfB Stuttgart on Sunday."

Hertha should have equalised before the break as striker Vedad Ibisevic headed onto the post, then fired over the bar. But they finally drew level on 82 minutes when substitute Alexander Baumjohann chested the ball through to Darida and the ex-Freiburg attacking midfielder slammed his shot past Frankfurt goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky. The point leaves Hertha sixth and Frankfurt 10th in the table. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund hosting Darmstadt on Sunday evening, defending champions Bayern Munich took the chance to go five points clear on Saturday with a 3-0 win at Mainz as Robert Lewandowski's goal haul continued. The Poland hot-shot took his tally to 101 Bundesliga goals and has now scored 10 goals in just six league games this season. Having sent German league records tumbling last Tuesday with five goals in just nine minutes after coming the bench in the 5-1 rout of Wolfsburg, the 27-year-old claimed two more against Mainz before Bayern host Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League on Tuesday. Lewandowski marked his 100th Bundesliga goal by heading Kingsley Coman's cross inside the far post on 51 minutes and pulled up his shirt to reveal a T-Shirt which stated: ""100"". ""The T-Shirt was my idea, I didn't know if I'd score today, but you always have to think positively, which is why I had it made,"" he told reporters. An Arturo Vidal pass then put Lewandowski in behind the defence to round the goalkeeper for his 101st on 63 minutes. France Under-21 winger Coman grabbed Bayern's third five minutes later with a simple tap in from a Douglas Costa cross. Schalke remain third after Germany Under-21 attacking midfielder Leroy Sane scored for his third game in succession to seal Saturday's 1-0 win at Hamburg with a superb strike on the hour. Bayer Leverkusen, who play European champions Barcelona away on Tuesday, romped to a 3-0 win at Werder Bremen with goals by Swiss forward Admir Mehmedi, winger Kevin Kampl and Germany Under-21 talent Julian Brandt. Wolfsburg, who play Manchester United at Old Trafford on Wednesday in the Champions League, dropped more points in a 1-1 draw at home to bottom side Hanover to stay fourth. Bas Dost's header was cancelled out by Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake's superb volley on 57 minutes to leave Wolves fourth in the table. Borussia Moenchengladbach, who host Manchester City on Wednesday, picked up their second win since Lucien Favre's shock resignation last Sunday with a 3-1 victory at VfB Stuttgart. The goals came from Granit Xhaka, a Christian Gentner own-goal and Raffel's late effort afer Daniel Ginczek slotted a 40th-minute penalty for Stuttgart. Hoffenheim climbed to 15th with a 3-1 win at Augsburg as Germany international Kevin Volland scored twice, including a second-half penalty."

The 29-year-old Lukimya hung his head in shame, but coach Viktor Skripnik says the Congo defender will keep his place at Darmstadt. ""'Luki' has put in some good performances, especially this season, and we have confidence in him,"" said Skripnik on Monday. The Ingolstadt defeat was only the second Bremen have suffered this season after back-to-back wins over Moenchengladbach and Hoffenheim. Lukimya, a Democratic Republic of Congo international, played his part in history as Ingolstadt's victory meant they are the first team in Germany's top flight to win all of their first three away games in their debut season. Austrian free-kick specialist Zlatko Junuzovic is expected to return to the Bremen squad for the Darmstadt game after recovering from a cold. Bremen will be without midfielders Ulisses Garcia, who has a broken toe, and Philipp Bargfrede, who is suspended after being sent off just before the final whistle against Ingolstadt."
103,13/09/2015,18:06,Werder leave it late to down Hoffenheim,Werder Bremen scored two goals in injury time to earn a 3-1 win at Hoffenheim on Sunday.,"Austria international Zlatko Junuzovic had given Werder the lead in the last minute of the first half before scoring the clinching third three minutes into injury time at the end of the game. Second-half substitute Eduardo Vargas had equalised for Hoffenheim on 49 minutes but Nigerian forward Anthony Ujah put the visitors back in front two minutes into time added on, converting a pass from 37-year-old Claudio Pizzaro. The win moved Bremen provisionally up to fifth spot ahead of Mainz's trip to Schalke 04 later on Sunday. Mainz are a point behind Bremen while Schalke are well back with just three points on their account. Hoffenheim remain 15th after their defeat having picked up a single point this season. Borussia Dortmund are top on goal difference after beating Hanover 4-2 on Saturday. Champions Bayern Munich are level on points with Dortmund --- both have won all four matches so far -- after a controversial late penalty from Thomas Mueller helped thm beat Augsburg 2-1 in the Bavarian derby. Borussia Moenchengladbach's disastrous start to the season -- just a few months after securing third place last season and a spot in the Champions League group stages for this campaign -- continued with a 3-0 defeat at home to Hamburg on Friday night."

The city of Munich has been particularly affected by the refugee crisis after local police reported that more than 100 migrants arrived in an hour on Wednesday in the Bavarian capital. For their next home match against Augsburg on September 12, Bayern players will walk out hand-in-hand with both a German and a refugee child as a mark of support for the integration of refugees. ""We at FC Bayern consider it our socio-political responsibility to help displaced and needy children, women and men, by supporting and assisting them in Germany,"" Bayern's chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wrote on the club's website. So far this year, German police have recorded over 125,000 illegal entries, more than double last year's total of about 57,000, with many coming from war-torn Syria as well as from Eritrea, Afghanistan, Kosovo and Serbia. The influx has sparked a wave of attacks on asylum-seekers and violent protests against foreigners. Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Germany will have ""no tolerance"" for ""shameful and vile"" violence against refugees. Germany's World Cup-winning footballers have condemned xenophobic attacks and led calls to help the refugees. The German Football Association (DFB) has produced a video in which a group of star players appear holding up signs condemning violence and calling for ""respect"", ""help"", ""integration"" and ""fairplay"" towards any refugee arriving in Germany. In Germany's football community, Bayern are not alone in offering help to those seeking refuge in Germany, with Europe's biggest economy this year expecting a record 800,000 asylum applications, more than any other EU country. Bayern's Bundesliga rivals Schalke invited 100 refugees to their opening home game of the season and have founded the ""Kumpel-Kiste"" (""mate's box"") initiative where clothes and toys can be sent to refugees. Schalke have released a video showing club legend Gerald Asamoah, the first African-born footballer to play for Germany, talking about the importance of understanding what the refugees are going through. In the video for the programme ""Stand Up"", Asamoah appears with the Schalke team and says the insults players hear from the terraces during a 90-minute match are nothing compared to what many refugees are experiencing on a daily basis in Germany as they wait to receive asylum. ""Ask yourself: Why are we doing this. If everyone shows some civil courage, if we talk about the issue and say, 'This isn't right!' then we can achieve so much. We have to take a stand. That means we must stand up!"" Schalke's bitter rivals Borussia Dortmund, who invited 220 refugees to a Europa League game, responded by saying ""separated by colours, united by this"". Other Bundesliga clubs have also got involved including Werder Bremen founded a ""Stay on the Ball"" project to help refugees in the region, while both Hannover and Hoffenheim have delivered kits and shoes to help."

The shared point means Hertha missed out on what would have been a club record of two straight wins from their opening matches of the new season to follow on from their 1-0 away win at Augsburg. Bremen take their first league point of the new season after last Saturday's 3-0 drubbing at home to Schalke."

The 36-year-old striker was in the Peru squad for Friday's Copa America third-place play-off against Paraguay on Friday and says he will focus on finding employment once the tournament is over. ""That would be ideal (to stay in Germany),"" he told the Munich-based Sueddeutsche Zeitung. ""I have already had a few offers, but I have waited until the last minute, because I really wanted to stay with FC Bayern. ""I don't know what will happen now, I have been totally focused on the Copa America and as soon as it's over, I'll analyse my options and come to a decision. ""I have three sons who are born in Germany and have grown up there. ""They are 15, 13 and nine and I want to offer them the best chance of some stability, because they have already moved a few times,"" added Pizarro, who also spent a year on a loan spell at Chelsea in the 2007/08 season. ""I simply like Munich. It's a wonderful city and everything is close by, such as the lakes and the mountains."" Last season, Pizarro failed to score in his 13 league appearances having netted an impressive 10 Bundesliga goals in 17 matches, mainly off the bench, in the 2013/14 season. But Pizarro ruled out an immediate return to his home country, ""because of reasons of security. If that wasn't the case, I'd go back to Peru without any doubts. ""But I don't want to put my family in an uncomfortable situation. ""It's sad, but that's the way it is and I want to play for a few years more. I feel good still."""
109,23/05/2015,19:43,Injured Meier is Germany's top-scorer,Eintracht Frankfurt forward Alexander Meier finished as the Bundesliga's top-scorer this season on Saturday -- despite missing the last seven games with injury.,"The burly 32-year-old finished with 19 goals in 26 games despite sitting out the last six weeks of the season with a knee injury which required surgery. ""It's something special, it's my first title,"" said Meier. ""I can only thank the team and our fans for helping me to win it. ""I was realistic about my chances of winning it after my operation and thought I'd missed my chance."" Bayern Munich pair Arjen Robben, who spent the last two months of the season on the sidelines, and last season's winner Robert Lewandowski finished joint second with 17 goals each despite playing 21 and 31 games respectively. Lewandowski added to his tally when he converted a first-half penalty in Bayern's 2-0 win over Mainz on Saturday as Pep Guardiola's side were crowned German champions for the 25th time. Borussia Dortmund's Gabon forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang finished joint fourth alongside Wolfsburg's Dutch striker Bas Dost as both scored 16 goals. Aubameyang scored in Dortmund's 3-2 win at home over Werder Bremen as his side finished seventh on Jurgen Klopp's last home game as Borussia coach."

Having scored 10 goals for Cologne this season, Ujah will replace Bremen's Under-20 striker Davie Selke, who has signed for second-division RB Leipzig for next season. ""We have been watching him very intensely for a very long time and have built up a full picture of him,"" said Werder's director of sport Thomas Eichin. ""He is a fast and prolific striker who can continue to develop with us.""

Bremen, who are challenging for a Europa League place for next season, had planned friendlies in the south-east Asian country at the end of May, but say the situation is now too complicated. ""We were very advanced in our planning, but under these conditions there are too many questions which have been raised and there are too many question marks,"" said Werder's Chief Executive Officer Klaus Filbry. ""Internationally, we want to show ourselves at our best, but it won't be possible this time. ""So in this respect, we have changed our plans at short notice."" Bremen say they are now planning three friendlies at the end of May with exact dates and opponents set to be announced."
112,26/04/2015,18:04,"Paderborn blow lead, Bayern wait for title",Paderborn blew a two-goal lead and remain in the Bundesliga's relegation places after their 2-2 draw with Werder Bremen as Bayern Munich's wait to be crowned champions continued Sunday.,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern are 15 points clear with four games remaining after Saturday's 1-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin thanks to Bastian Schweinsteiger's second-half winner. But Munich's champagne must wait on ice until second-placed VfL Wolfsburg play at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday, when a Wolves' defeat or draw would remove all mathematical doubt and confirm Bayern as champions. Paderborn blew their chance of a win which would have seen them escape the bottom three after two goals in as many minutes from Mario Vrancic and midfielder Moritz Stoppelkamp. Bremen went into half-time 2-1 down thanks to a goal from Germany Under-19 striker Davie Selke just on the stroke of the break. Things unravelled for Paderborn as Bremen midfielder Izet Hajrovic equalised on 76 minutes. Just two minutes later the hosts had midfielder Michael Heinloth sent off for a second yellow card. On Saturday, Hamburg boosted their hopes of avoiding an historic relegation with a dramatic 3-2 win over Augsburg to climb off the bottom of the table and up to 16th place. Pierre-Michel Lasogga, who has been capped by Germany, was Hamburg's hero with two goals including the 71st-minute winner. Hamburg are the only team to have never been relegated from Germany's top flight but Bruno Labbadia's side are now only one point from safety after picking up their first win in 10 matches. Hamburg and Paderborn are both a point clear of bottom side Stuttgart, who threw away a two-goal lead and had Czech midfielder Adam Hlousek sent off in a 2-2 draw at home to Freiburg, who are themselves just two points from the drop zone. Schalke's 2-0 defeat to Mainz on Friday and Augsburg's loss in Hamburg left both Hoffenheim and Borussia Dortmund within striking distance of the Europa League places. Dortmund, the 2013 Champions League finalists who are three points from a European place, eased to a 2-0 win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Gabon winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang converted a first-half penalty then set up Japan attacking midfielder Shinji Kagawa's 34th-minute strike, with the win leaving Borussia eighth. Seventh-placed Hoffenheim are two points from a Europa League spot after Sven Schipplock scored their winner in a 2-1 victory over Hanover 96, whose new coach Michael Frontzeck lost his first game in charge. Bayer Leverkusen stay third after their 1-1 draw with Cologne as Julian Brandt's first-half goal was cancelled out by Bard Finne's late equaliser in the Rhine derby. Moenchengladbach can knock Leverkusen from third place -- which carries an automatic Champions League place for next season -- when they host Wolfsburg on Sunday with the rest of the league waiting to see if the result will see Bayern crowned."
113,19/04/2015,17:52,Relegation beckons as Hamburg lose at Bremen,Bottom side Hamburg have just five games left to avoid a historic relegation from the Bundesliga following their 1-0 defeat at Werder Bremen in Sunday's north German derby.,"Bremen's Argentine striker Franco di Santo claimed his 13th goal of the season by netting an 84th-minute penalty just after Hamburg's Swiss midfielder Valon Behrami was sent off for fouling Werder's Zlatko Junuzovic in the area. Hamburg have now lost their last five games and taken just two points in their last nine matches as Bruno Labbadia suffered defeat in his first game since being appointed as Hamburg's fourth coach this season on Wednesday. As the only side to have never been relegated from Germany's top flight, Hamburg are four points from safety having only avoided the drop last season by winning a play-off. Meanwhile leaders Bayern Munich are on the verge of a third Bundesliga title after Saturday's hard-fought 2-0 win at Hoffenheim, but have fresh injury worries for Tuesday's crucial clash against Porto. Bayern face a make-or-break Champions League quarter-final second leg against Porto in Munich having lost 3-1 in Portugal in the first leg, but have eight players injured. Left-back Juan Bernat had to be helped off after a bone-crunching first-half tackle in Hoffenheim, but coach Pep Guardiola said the Spaniard was only taken off as a precaution: ""We didn't want to take any risks"". With second-placed Wolfsburg at home to Schalke on Sunday, Bayern extended their lead to 13 points with five games left. Depending on results elsewhere, next Saturday's clash at home to Hertha Berlin could see Bayern confirmed champions after Sebastian Rode's first-half strike and an own-goal from Hoffenheim captain Andreas Beck gave them three more points. Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund enjoyed a 3-0 victory at home to relegation-threatened Paderborn to climb to eighth in their first game since coach Jurgen Klopp announced he would be leaving at the end of the season. Having won the 2011 and 2012 titles, then finished runners-up to Bayern for the last two years, Klopp will quit Dortmund next month after seven years in charge while ex-Mainz boss Thomas Tuchel was confirmed as his replacement on Sunday. Second-half goals by Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Shinji Kagawa left Dortmund in ninth and just outside the Europa League places. After Borussia Moenchengladbach's goalless draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday, Bayer Leverkusen took Gladbach's place in third, and amongst the automatic Champions League berths, with a 4-0 mauling of Hanover 96. It was Leverkusen's seventh straight league win, a new club record. Centre-backs Omer Toprak and Kyriakos Papadopoulos as well as forwards Julian Brandt and Stefan Kiessling scored to put Leverkusen level with Gladbach on 54 points, but ahead on goal difference. Ausgburg went up to fifth and remain on course for a Europa League with a 2-1 home win over second-from-bottom VfB Stuttgart, thanks to goals by Tobias Werner and Paraguay striker Raul Bobadilla. Mainz are 11th after Japan striker Shinji Okazaki scored twice in their 3-2 win at relegation contenders Freiburg on Saturday. Mid-table Hertha Berlin and Cologne both stay seven points above the relegation places following their goalless draw in the capital."
114,18/04/2015,15:40,Labbadia launches Hamburg's rescue mission,Bruno Labbadia begins his mission to save bottom-side Hamburg from an historic relegation from the Bundesliga in Sunday's north German derby against Werder Bremen with just six league games left.,"The 49-year-old was appointed as Hamburg's fourth coach this season on Wednesday after his predecessor Peter Knaebel was sacked despite being in charge for just two games. After taking just two points from their last eight games, Hamburg are bottom of the Bundesliga and started the weekend four points from safety as the only team in Germany's top flight to have never been relegated. Labbadia, who is in his second stint at Hamburg after being sacked in 2010 despite only nine months in charge, took the team on a three-day training camp to help ""get their heads right"" for the Bremen clash. Labbadia is set to name strikers Pierre-Michel Lasogga and Ivica Olic, plus attacking midfielder Raffael van der Vaart, even though the trio have failed to score in the last five games, but getting three points at Bremen is now crucial. ""We have been very clear with the team in our dealings, I am convinced that everyone wants this,"" said Labbadia. ""We have to be like a fortress in Bremen. ""We've not been talking about what anyone can't do, we have only been talking about our strengths and they are what I am asking for from everyone here."" Labbadia is set to include Swiss midfielder Valon Behrami despite his half-time bust-up with team-mate Johan Djourou during last weekend's 2-0 defeat to VfL Wolfsburg, for which the club fined both players. Djourou is suspended for the Bremen match after being sent off late on against Wolves."
115,12/04/2015,19:41,10-man Stuttgart down Bremen to put Hamburg bottom,Ten-man VfB Stuttgart climbed off the bottom of the Bundesliga on Sunday with a dramatic 3-2 win at home to Werder Bremen thanks to striker Daniel Ginczek's double.,"Bremen looked to have rescued a point when defender Jannik Vestergaard headed them level on 86 minutes, just after Stuttgart winger Martin Harnik was sent off for a second yellow card, having earlier wasted two clear chances. But Ivory Coast winger Serey Die put through a superb pass which Ginczek slotted home with ice-cold finishing to claim Stuttgart's 91st-minute winner. The hosts took the lead when midfielder Christian Gentner volleyed home on 16 minutes, but Werder levelled early in the second half through Germany Under-20 striker Davie Selke. Ginczek headed Stuttgart into a 2-1 lead with 70 minutes gone before claiming his second in the dying stages. Earlier, Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah and Germany's Jonas Hector produced some individual brilliance to seal 10-men Cologne's 3-2 win over Hoffenheim to pull away from the relegation places. Ujah calmy converted Japan international Yuya Osako's defence-splitting pass on 54 minutes after Matthias Lehmann had converted Cologne's first-half penalty. Cologne had Pawel Olkowski sent off for a straight red and Eugen Polanski drilled home Hoffenheim's resulting penalty on 70 minutes. Hector settled the tie with a superb individual goal after dribbling around four defenders on 78 minutes before Modeste scored Hoffenheim's second with a late header. On Saturday, Robert Lewandowski scored twice as injury-hit leaders Bayern Munich romped to a 3-0 league win over Eintracht Frankfurt ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final at Porto. Bayern are now only three wins from claiming a third straight German league title. Lewandowski, the Bundesliga's top-scorer last season, has 16 goals for the season and is third in the current rankings. Frankfurt were missing the league's top scorer with Alexander Meier, who has 19 goals in 26 matches, suffering from a knee injury. Centre-back Medhi Benatia, who has a groin injury, joined flu-victim Bastian Schweinsteiger, plus Jerome Boateng, wingers Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben and left-back David Alaba on Bayern's casualty list. Bayern needed just 15 minutes to take the lead when Lewandowski produced a superb turn and volley, then headed home, with suspicion of offside, on 66 minutes. Thomas Mueller added the third eight minutes from time when he fired home from a seemingly-impossible angle. Second-placed Wolfsburg remain ten points behind Bayern and on course for the Champions League next season after their 2-0 win at 10-men Hamburg, who drop to bottom. Goals either side of half-time by defensive midfielder Josuha Guilavogui and right winger Daniel Caligiuri sealed Wolves' win. Hamburg had Swiss defender Johan Djourou, who brawled with team-mate Valon Behrami in the dressing room at half-time, sent off for a second yellow card in the dying stages. Borussia Moenchengladbach picked up their fourth straight league win with an impressive 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund to stay third in the table. Gladbach's Sweden left-back Oscar Wendt scored after just 29 seconds and Brazilian forward Raffael added their second on 32 minutes. Norway's Havard Nordveit then fired home when left unmarked at the far post for Gladbach with 67 minutes gone before Ilkay Gundogan pulled a late goal back for Dortmund. Bayer Leverkusen stayed fourth with a 3-2 win over Mainz, 24 hours before sacking Bosnia international Emir Spahic, who is being investigated by police for allegedly assaulting a club steward. South Korea striker Son Heung-Min opened the scoring with 15 minutes gone and Stefan Kiessling added a second early in the second-half before Hakan Calhanoglu drilled home a 73rd-minute free-kick. Mainz's South Korea international Koo Ja-Cheol converted two late penalties. Fifth-placed Schalke are now 10 points adrift of a Champions League place for next season after their goalless draw with relegation-threatened Freiburg. Augsburg stay sixth despite their shock 2-1 defeat at Paderborn, who remain in the relegation places."
116,11/04/2015,14:48,Rock-bottom Stuttgart need killer instinct,"Bottom side VfB Stuttgart must show ""a killer instinct"" on Sunday in the battle to avoid their first relegation for 40 years, says their Germany defender Anthony Ruediger.","Stuttgart host mid-table Werder Bremen on Sunday with just one league win in 11 games dating back to mid-December, and are five points from safety with seven games to go. The 2007 German champions are bidding to avoid their first relegation since 1975 but are enduring the worst season in the club's proud history. After four months out with a knee injury, Ruediger, who has five caps for Germany, is ready to help resume his side's battle to stay in Germany's top flight. ""Good isn't enough. We need to run until there is nothing more left. We need to show some balls, we need the killer instinct,"" said the 22-year-old. ""We need more courage and more aggression."" Having been bottom of the table last December, Bremen are up to ninth and just four points from a European place for next season. Following a run of five straight wins up until mid February, Bremen's form has dipped in recent weeks with only six points from a possible 18 in their last six games. Bremen coach Viktor Skripnik lost four kilogrammes (eight pounds) in weight due to stress when they were in the relegation zone and the Ukrainian is more concerned about the ten points his side is from the drop zone, rather than dreaming about playing in Europe next season. ""Mathematically, we are not guaranteed to stay up yet. Three points (in Stuttgart) would be good, then we can talk about other things,"" said Skripnik."
117,20/03/2015,02:30,"Bayern to welcome back Robben, Ribery for Gladbach",Bayern Munich hope to welcome back wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery for Sunday's clash at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach as they look to edge closer to the Bundesliga title.,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern start the weekend 11 points clear and could still break last season's record when they claimed the title with seven games to spare. The Allianz Arena clash sees the runaway leaders host third-placed Gladbach, but Lucien Favre's Borussia are already a staggering 20 points adrift of Guardiola's Bavarians. With 17 league goals in 20 games this season, Robben is battling Frankfurt's Alex Meier to become the Bundesliga's top scorer but the flying Dutchman is battling to overcome a trapped nerve that saw him miss last Saturday's 4-0 rout of Werder Bremen. Robben took part in training this week, as did left winger Franck Ribery, who also sat out the Bremen victory with an ankle injury. However, with Poland striker Robert Lewandowski pillaging six goals in his last five league games and on 13 for the season, the champions would still have plenty of firepower without the pair. Bayern will be without suspended centre-back Medhi Benatia, whose yellow card at Bremen was his fifth of the season, carrying with it an automatic suspension. Bayern captain Philipp Lahm is set for another place on the bench having made his return from injury at Bremen. Gladbach face an uphill task to take points off their hosts with Bayern unbeaten at home this season after 11 wins and a draw. Fresh from their midweek Champions League exit, tenth-placed Borussia Dortmund are hunting their first win in four games when they travel to Hanover 96, who are 13th. Germany defender Marcel Schmelzer is an injury doubt having picked up a knock in their 3-0 last 16 defeat to Juventus, which sealed a 5-1 aggregate defeat, but defensive midfielder Nuri Sahin is definitely out with a leg injury. ""Our main priority is the league now, although that doesn't mean that we don't want to progress in the German Cup,"" said Borussia coach Jurgen Klopp. His side have improved in the league since the turn of the year having started February bottom of the table following a dire set of results. Hanover coach Tayfun Korkut is under pressure as his side have won just one of their last 10 games. Fifth-placed Schalke have a chance to improve their Champions League chances for next season when they host fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday night with just three points separating the teams. ""I think you can describe this game as a 'six-pointer',"" said Schalke coach Roberto di Matteo. ""We're playing at home and are confident of getting a good result."" The 44-year-old is set to keep teenage goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther between the posts with first-choice stopper Ralf Faehrmann working his way back from injury after picking up a cruciate knee ligament strain in January. Both teams exited the Champions League at the last 16 stage with Schalke going out 5-4 to Real Madrid on aggregate despite a stunning 4-3 win in Spain just over ten days ago.

Along with Bayern Munich's Thomas Mueller and Mario Goetze, plus Eintracht Frankfurt's Alexander Meier and Mainz's Shinji Okazaki, ex-Chelsea forward Di Santo has scored six goals this season. In total, the Argentina international has ten goals in 43 top-flight appearances in Germany. ""It's obviously a setback for us,"" said Bremen's caretaker coach Viktor Skripnik. ""Franco had been in great form, but we do have alternative options in the squad who are chomping at the bit to be involved and who have our complete faith."" After Robin Dutt was sacked last month with Werder bottom of the table, Bremen have won their last two league matches under Skripnik to climb up to 16th while Hamburg are second from bottom after losing three of their last four games."
131,12/11/2014,16:54,Ex-Germany star to make pro-wrestling debut,"Former Germany international goalkeeper Tim Wiese is set to make his professional wrestling debut in a WWE event on Saturday, according to a report in the German media.","Wiese retired from professional football in September, at the age of 32, having won the last of his six caps for Germany in 2012, but took up weightlifting after an unsuccessful move from Werder Bremen to Hoffenheim the same year. He was in the Germany squad for the 2010 World Cup and made 194 Bundesliga appearances for Bremen, but played just 10 league matches for Hoffenheim after a disagreement with the club's bosses. Pictures of the dramatically bulked up goalkeeper went viral on the internet in September and daily newspaper Bild claim the 32-year-old will make his debut at the ""WWE Live Event"" in Frankfurt on Saturday. It is unclear whether he will compete in the Frankfurt ring or be part of an exhibition bout. The six foot, three inch Wiese told Bild back in September that he has an offer to compete in the WWE as a professional wrestler and was considering the deal. ""I am not scared,"" he added."
132,25/10/2014,16:17,Bundesliga bottom side Bremen sack coach Dutt,Bundesliga bottom side Werder Bremen on Saturday sacked coach Robin Dutt with his team winless after nine games of the season.,"The 49-year-old, in charge for just over a year, was relieved of his job less than 24 hours after Friday's 1-0 defeat at home to Cologne which left his side with just four points and 23 goals conceded. Dutt's assistants Damir Buric and Marco Langner have also been released. He becomes the third Bundesliga coach to be sacked this season after Mirko Slomka (from Hamburg) and Jens Keller (Schalke 04). The four-time German champions -- though their last title was back in 2004 -- were routed 6-0 at German league leaders Bayern Munich last Saturday with the visitors failing to generate a single shot at goal over 90 minutes. ""We'd like to thank Robin and his team for their work,"" said Bremen's director of sport Thomas Eichin. ""He steered the club through a difficult period with great passion over the last few months. ""However, in light of recent results we believe the team needs a new impulse in order to get out of the present situation."" Bremen's Under-23 coach Viktor Skripnik has been appointed as caretaker coach, with ex-Germany midfielder Torsten Frings as his assistant, while the search for Dutt's successor goes on."
133,18/10/2014,17:48,Leaders Bayern rout Bremen in Roma warm-up,Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich earned their fifth straight victory on Saturday as Spain's Xabi Alonso netted his first Bundesliga goal in their 6-0 rout of Werder Bremen.,"Bayern warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League clash at AS Roma by maintaining their four-point lead at the top of the table, boosting their goal difference to plus 19 as former Germany captain Philipp Lahm and Mario Geotze scored twice. Lahm started the rout when he crashed his shot home from 14 metres out with 20 minutes gone at Munich's Allianz Arena. Alonso, who joined Bayern from Real Madrid in August, netted his first goal for the club when he drove a free-kick under the Bremen wall on 27 minutes. Thomas Mueller put the hosts 3-0 up when he converted a penalty after being dragged down in the area by Bremen's Sebastian Proedl on 43 minutes. And Goetze made it 4-0 at the break when he held off Congo defender Assani Lukimya to bury his shot in the far corner. Lahm and Goetze both added their second goals as the hosts profited from a tiring defence in the final 20 minutes and the result left Bremen bottom of the table. With Hoffenheim at Hamburg on Sunday, Borussia Moenchengladbach went second in the table with a 3-0 win at Hanover 96 as Germany squad member Max Kruse scored twice and Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka netted a free-kick. However, Borussia Dortmund's horror league run continued as they lost 2-1 at Cologne to make it five Bundesliga games without a win, and their third defeat in a row, ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash at Galatasaray. Dortmund's Germany midfielders Ilkay Gundogan -- who had been out for more than a year -- and Marco Reus returned from injury, but were powerless to stop Cologne taking a 1-0 lead as midfielder Kevin Vogt fired home on 40 minutes. Dortmund's Italy striker Ciro Immobile equalised, but Cologne's Simon Zoller netted the hosts' winner on 74 minutes to seal their first win at home against Borussia since 2003. The result sees Dortmund drop to 14th in the table -- just two points above the bottom three -- while Cologne are 10th. Bayer Leverkusen, who host Zenit St Petersburg in the Champions League on Wednesday, threw away a three-goal lead in their 3-3 draw at plucky VfB Stuttgart. A win would have seen Leverkusen go third, but the draw saw them drop to sixth in the table. Leverkusen raced into a 2-0 lead after only nine minutes as South Korea's Son Heung-Min scored twice and could have had a hat-trick on 11 minutes when his lob hit the crossbar. Germany's Karim Bellarabi made it 3-0 just before the break when he converted Son's pass to leave Leverkusen in full control. But Stuttgart battled back as midfielder Timo Werner and left-back Florian Klein scored second-half goals before Martin Harnik headed Stuttgart level on 76 minutes when he was left unmarked at the far post -- by Son. VfL Wolfsburg went third with a 2-1 win at Freiburg as midfielder Daniel Caligiuri scored twice against his old club, while Mainz went fourth after their 2-1 win at home to Augsburg. Ex-Chelsea manager Roberto di Matteo makes his debut as Schalke 04 coach later when the 12th-placed Royal Blues host Hertha Berlin in a mid-table clash."
134,26/09/2014,09:27,Victory needed by both Schalke and Dortmund in derby,Bayern Munich are right where they want to be atop the Bundesliga after five rounds and ahead of a tough showdown against Cologne this weekend while Schalke and Borussia Dortmund both head into the 145th derby needing a victory.,"Munich head to Cologne on Saturday to face a team which had not conceded a goal in their first four games this season until Hanover scored in the midweek round of games. Bayern are happy about where they are, knowing that the weekend/midweek rhythm is just starting with a match-up against CSKA Moscow coming in the Champions League next week. ""I think we can be satisfied after the first five games. We've picked up 11 out of a possible 15 points, three wins and two draws - that's okay,"" said Munich board chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge after the team's 4-0 victory over the previous surprise leaders SC Paderborn. ""Some people expected a bumpy start after the World Cup. We can be very satisfied with the season to date including the Champions League."" Bayern winger Arjen Robben said the win over Paderborn was important but the Cologne game matched that in their bid to stay atop the Bundesliga. ""It was really important for us to win and lay down a marker. That's what we're aiming for, where we want to be and - much more important - we want to stay there,"" said Robben. The top two challengers at the moment - Bayer Leverkusen and Hanover 96 - both have 10 points and play at teams who have not yet won this season in SC Freiburg and VfB Stuttgart respectively. Stuttgart sit second-to-last with two points after failing to hold a 2-0 lead at Dortmund in a 2-2 draw midweek. Stuttgart's troubles - they had scored just one goal going into the Dortmund match - resulted in the sacking of sporting director Fredi Bobic. ""In the end, we probably have to consider ourselves somewhat fortunate to be taking a point. With this performance, we have certainly taken a step in the right direction,"" said Daniel Didavi, who scored both goals against Dortmund. The Yellow-Blacks actually could have beaten Stuttgart but had a shot blocked at the line in stoppage time. In general, though, Dortmund know they cannot give up two goals every game. ""We need more stability in defence. We have already conceded nine goals in five matches which is not just a poor record, it is a very poor record,"" said captain Mats Hummels, who came on in the second half for his first action this season. ""We need to defend better as a team, and all eleven players have to play their part. If you concede two goals in each game, as has already happened four times this season, it's very hard to win."" And Dortmund need to win, having already dropped four points behind Bayern and three behind Leverkusen and Hanover. Schalke come into the match having finally won their first competitive match of the season - a 3-0 beating of Werder Bremen. The Royal Blues have won just one of the last four derbies at home against Dortmund. Manager Jens Keller knows his team will be well served to put together a string of victories to move back up the table. And Dortmund are a perfect opponent for that. ""We don't need to motivate the players for this match. It's the biggest derby in Germany. We are all excited for the match,"" said Keller, whose team has five points in 13th place.

135,13/09/2014,18:17,Ribery scores on return as Bayern go joint top,"Bayern Munich playmaker Franck Ribery scored in his first game this season as the champions moved joint top of the Bundesliga on Saturday, while Shinji Kagawa also enjoyed a goalscoring return as Borussia Dortmund saw off Freiburg.","Mario Goetze put the defending champions ahead in the first half before Ribery came off the bench to seal a routine 2-0 win over VfB Stuttgart at the Allianz Arena. Bayern are now equal on seven points with Bayer Leverkusen who were held 3-3 by Werder Bremen on Friday night and are ahead on goal difference after three games. The Bavarians scored the first goal of the afternoon after 27 minutes when Goetze drove a shot through a crowd of players when a free-kick was only partially cleared. In the second half Ribery, who has been suffering from a recurring knee injury, came on and the French midfielder secured the three points when he slotted under Sven Ullreich with five minutes left. The only down side for Bayern ahead of a Champions League clash with Manchester City in Munich on Wednesday was seeing defender Holger Badstuber hobble off with a thigh injury. Meanwhile, Kagawa made a dream start to his second spell at Borussia Dortmund after getting on the scoresheet in their 3-1 win over Freiburg at Signal Iduna Park. The Japanese midfielder returned to Dortmund from Manchester United last month and his clever pass for Kevin Grosskreutz helped the hosts open the scoring after 34 minutes. Grosskreutz's low cross was swept in by Adrian Ramos for his second goal of the campaign. The same three players were involved when Dortmund stretched their lead four minutes before half-time. This time Ramos found Kagawa, who sidefooted home in what was his 50th Bundesliga game. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a breakaway goal shortly after coming on before Oliver Sorg pulled one back for Freiburg. Dortmund are third on the Bundesliga table a point behind Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern. Elsewhere, Japanese striker Shinji Okazaki scored twice and Sami Allagui also found the net against the team he has just left as Mainz won 3-1 at Hertha Berlin. Okazaki gave the visitors the lead after 36 minutes, finishing on the rebound after home keeper Thomas Kraft twice denied South Korea midfielder Koo Ja-Cheol. Julian Schieber fired a great chance wide for Hertha before Allagui rounded off a lovely team move with twenty minutes left. It was the Tunisian attacker's first game for Mainz since rejoining them on loan from Hertha at the end of August. Ronny's late penalty gave Hertha hope but Okazaki's third league goal of the campaign ensured that Mainz got their first league win of the season. Hoffenheim had to settle for a point after Ivica Olic's deft finish drew visitors Wolfsburg level with a minute remaining. Anthony Modeste scored Hoffenheim's goal in the 1-1 draw, while Wolfsburg's Josuha Guilavogui was sent off late on. Promoted sides Paderborn and Cologne are both still unbeaten after they played out a goalless draw. On Friday, Bayer Leverkusen lost their 100 percent record when they were pegged back in a six-goal thriller against Werder Bremen. Werder's Sebastian Proedl made it 3-3 with only five minutes left as the visitors drew their third game in a row."
136,19/08/2014,02:05,Germany riding crest of wave as Bundesliga begins,The new Bundesliga season gets underway this weekend with German football riding the crest of a wave following the national team's triumph at the World Cup in Brazil last month.,"That thoroughly deserved victory, given to Joachim Loew's side by Mario Goetze's extra-time strike in the final against Argentina, saw a unified Germany crowned as world champions for the first time. But at club level, the Bundesliga has been leading the way for some time. It averaged 3.16 goals per game last season, considerably more than any of its major European counterparts, while average gates were over 42,000, making the German top flight the best attended league anywhere. ""In my opinion, the Bundesliga's the most attractive league in the world,"" Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Lucien Favre told bundesliga.com. ""The hype in Germany is amazing, and now they've won the World Cup so it's not going to tail off in a rush."" Nevertheless, the biggest problem facing the Bundesliga, as ever, is how to counter the dominance of Bayern Munich, who have romped to the title and added the German Cup in each of the last two campaigns. They have seen Toni Kroos and Mario Mandzukic depart and lost Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in last week's SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, but the Bavarians remain favourites. And yet the rest can draw some hope from the very fact this is a Bundesliga season immediately following a World Cup, and that has not tended to help Bayern in the recent past. After Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup, Stuttgart went on to win the Bundesliga, while in 2011 Dortmund pipped Bayern to the title. In 2009, after Germany reached the Euro 2008 final, it was Wolfsburg who were champions. Six members of Pep Guardiola's squad played in the World Cup final, including Goetze, while Dante and Arjen Robben were also involved until the latter stages in Brazil. That is why chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wanted the start of the new season delayed in order to give these players longer to prepare, but that request was unsurprisingly turned down by Bayern's rivals. ""We have to face the fact that the first half of the season will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, who at times had only a skeleton squad in pre-season training. ""We are at least one month behind schedule."" Guardiola has added to his squad with compatriots Juan Bernat from Valencia and Pepe Reina, who will provide competition in goal for Manuel Neuer. But the marquee signing was Robert Lewandowski, a prolific goalscorer for Dortmund in the last four years. However, Dortmund have moved to replace the Pole by signing Italy striker Ciro Immobile from Torino and Colombia's Adrian Ramos from Hertha Berlin. Stability is key at the Signal Iduna Park, where coach Jurgen Klopp, who led Dortmund to back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012 and a Champions League final defeat to Bayern in 2013, is entering his seventh season in charge. ""We want to establish ourselves further at the top of the league and qualify directly for the Champions League,"" said sporting director Michael Zorc modestly. However, Guardiola knows where the danger lies, saying: ""We may have won the last two league titles, but they clinched the previous two. Our great challenge is to keep up our level to keep them at distance."" Beneath them, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg will again be hoping to contend for Champions League qualification at least. Schalke have kept Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Julian Draxler, while Sidney Sam has joined from Leverkusen, and few teams can boast a midfield as strong as Wolfsburg, with Kevin de Bruyne, Luiz Gustavo and France's Josuha Guilavogui. Bayer have signed Swiss striker Josip Drmic from Nuremberg and have a new coach in Roger Schmidt, back in his native country after winning the Austrian title with Salzburg. Hamburg will be hoping for a stable campaign after almost being relegated for the first time in their history last season. There are new coaches at Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, who have reappointed Armin Veh, the architect of their 2007 title triumph, while Cologne are back among the elite and Paderborn are in the Bundesliga for the first time."
137,03/08/2014,23:48,Mourinho blames referee and fitness for Bremen defeat,Chelsea slumped to their first pre-season defeat on Sunday as they were beaten 3-0 by Werder Bremen in Germany to spoil the return of Didier Drogba and the debut of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.,"Ivory Coast legend Drogba made his first appearance for Chelsea since scoring the penalty that won the 2012 Champions League in Munich when he came on as a second-half substitute for summer signing Diego Costa. However, Jose Mourinho's side were already 2-0 down at that point and Drogba's return ended in a tame defeat at the Weserstadion. ""They are the best team we've faced in this period,"" said Mourinho. ""We knew they were in a more advanced stage of pre-season so we were expecting a competitive, intense game."" Blues captain John Terry conceded a soft penalty after 20 minutes when he needlessly blocked the ball with his arm and Dutch winger Eljero Elia stepped up to plant his spot-kick past Belgian 'keeper Courtois, who has joined up with Chelsea after a long-term loan at Atletico Madrid. It got worse for the visitors 17 minutes later when Terry was again implicated as Polish winger Ludovic Obraniak darted past the static centre-half to glance a header past Courtois. ""We came here and the referee thought it was a circus for Bremen fans to have fun and he killed the match,"" Mourinho told the Chelsea website. ""I like their team, they are fast, defend with a lot of players, they are physical. It was the perfect opponent but we didn't play."" Mourinho made several changes at the break, including the introductions of Drogba and Branislav Ivanovic, while Eden Hazard entered the fray in the second half. Bremen won a second penalty in the last minute when Dutch defender Nathan Ake was punished for what appeared to be a fair challenge but it didn't matter to Felix Kroos, who stroked the ball past substitute 'keeper Petr Cech from 12 yards. ""Every duel and free-kick went against us, the penalties, especially the last one, were nonsense. Being aggressive with Ake, an 18-year-old, was disappointing. We wanted to train but the referee didn't let us have a good session,"" added the coach. The Portuguese also said many of his players including Courtois are well short of match fitness and preparation following the World Cup. ""Courtois is the same as the others, two days training and playing today for 45 minutes, he needs to play, we don't have lots of time. It's only two weeks until the start of the season so we gave him and Petr (Cech) 45 minutes each. ""He made a fantastic save from Di Santo, with the other goal he had no chance, but that save was fantastic."" Chelsea, who had previously registered four wins and a draw in pre-season, continue their preparations with a game against Hungarian side Ferencvaros next Sunday. Their opening Premier League game will be away to promoted Burnley on Monday, August 18."
138,27/05/2014,15:58,Football: Germany midfielder Hunt signs for Wolfsburg,"Germany midfielder Aaron Hunt has joined Europa League side VfL Wolfsburg on a three-year deal after 13 years at Werder Bremen, his new club announced on Tuesday.","The 27-year-old, who has three international caps, signed for Werder as a junior and has switched clubs on a free transfer. ""I was with Bremen for a long time, achieved many things with Werder and had some really great years, but this was the time to try something new,"" said Hunt, with Wolfsburg only 150 kilometres (93 miles) south of Bremen. He is set to link up with Belgium midfielder Kevin de Bruyne and Brazil's Luiz Gustavo as Wolves target a return to the Champions League for 2015/2016 after finishing fifth last season in the Bundesliga and just missing out on a place. Hunt, a defensive midfielder, has not been chosen in Joachim Loew's squad for next month's World Cup. He made his last appearance for Germany in May 2013 on a two-match tour of the USA. He becomes the second Germany international to join Wolves after right-back Sebastian Jung switched from Eintracht Frankfurt last week. ""Despite being only 27 and having collected a lot of experience, Aaron is a player who can improve on the high levels he sets for himself,"" said Wolfsburg's team manager Klaus Allofs. Hunt opted for Wolfsburg despite offers from Italy, England, Russia and Turkey and has scored 46 goals for Werder in 215 Bundesliga appearances."
139,27/05/2014,12:04,Football: Veteran Peru hot-shot Pizarro extends Bayern deal,"Veteran Peru hot-shot Claudio Pizarro has extended his Bayern Munich stay by signing a new one year deal with the Bundesliga champions up to June 2015, it was announced Tuesday.","Pizarro, 36 in October, was the Bundesliga champion's most efficient forward last season. He scored 10 league goals and had three assists despite limited appearances as back-up to Pep Guardiola's first-choice striker Mario Mandzukic. The Peru veteran only started six league games, but managed to score four goals off the bench including the winner in Bayern's final Bundesliga match of the season after the Bavarian giants won the title with a record seven games spare. ""Claudio has again proven how dangerous he is in front of goal and how important he is for the team,"" said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge after they won the league and cup double. ""We are really pleased that we can continue to count on him."" Pizarro finished joint fourth amongst Bayern's top scorers last season behind Mandzukic, Thomas Mueller and Arjen Robben, but level with Germany star Mario Goetze. Statistically, Pizarro was Bayern's most efficient player, needing just 53 minutes to either score or provide an assist. With 370 Bundesliga appearances and 176 league goals, the former Chelsea and Werder Bremen forward is the league's top foreign scorer having made his debut in Germany's top-flight in 1999."

141,28/04/2014,14:45,Football: Season over for Leverkusen's Kiessling,Bayer Leverkusen must do without injured striker Stefan Kiessling in their bid to qualify for a place in next season's Champions League after the Germany international tore his left hamstring.,"Kiessling will miss Leverkusen's last two league games of the season with the 'Werkself' holding onto fourth in the league, which carries a Champions League play-off berth, by just a point from VfL Wolfsburg. Bayer crashed out of this season's Champions League with a 6-1 aggregate defeat at the hands of Paris St Germain in the last 16 and fired coach Sami Hyypia earlier this month after a run of defeats in a bid to protect their status in next season's competition. The loss of Kiessling is a blow to their hopes under caretaker coach Sascha Lewandowski with a fortnight left in the season. The 30-year-old suffered the injury in Leverkusen's 2-2 draw at home to second-placed Borussia Dortmund on Saturday and a scan confirmed the worst, meaning he will miss his side's final two matches, at home to Eintracht Frankfurt and away to Werder Bremen. Having made his last international appearance at the 2010 World Cup, Kiessling was the Bundesliga's top-scorer last season with 25 goals in 34 league games and has hit the net 19 times for Bayer this season."
142,28/04/2014,02:15,Football: Bayern counting on home advantage for Real clash,"Bayern Munich plan on making home advantage count in Tuesday's Champions League semi-final, second-leg, against Real Madrid having never lost at home to the Spanish giants.","Madrid arrive in the Bavarian capital holding a 1-0 lead thanks to Karim Benzema's 19th-minute goal in last Wednesday's first leg in Madrid and are looking to avenge their defeat at the same stage to Bayern two years ago. History is on the Germans' side. Bayern have never lost to Real in Munich, with eight victories and one draw, to lead the overall series with 11 victories to Madrid's eight from 21 encounters. The second-leg is finely poised. Real maintained their positive momentum since beating Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final before their first-leg victory over Bayern by romping to a 4-0 win over Osasuna in the Spanish league on Saturday. Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo proved he is fit for the Munich clash after a hamstring injury by scoring twice to leave him on 47 goals for the season. Real coach Carlo Ancelotti rested stars Benzema, who picked up a knee knock in the first leg, and Gareth Bale, who was recovering from flu, at Osasuna. The Italian has insisted both men should be fit to start at the Allianz Arena. ""I am sure that whatever eleven I play will be full of desire and excited to play such a big game,"" said Ancelotti. ""Everyone should be calm because we are going to prepare properly. ""The objective is to score, not to defend, and that is the manner in which we will continue to work."" Ancelotti has never lost to a German team in six encounters from his time as AC Milan manager, but the key to Tuesday's game will be who scores first. Real will be chasing the first goal in Munich which would leave Bayern needing to score at least three times to progress to their fourth Champions League final in five years. Worryingly for coach Pep Guardiola, Bayern have conceded the first goal in seven of their last nine matches since winning the Bundesliga title with a record seven matches to spare last month. A woeful first-half in Saturday's dress rehearsal saw the hosts 2-1 down to Werder Bremen in Munich before Bayern roared back with four second-half goals to claim a comfortable Bundesliga win. But the flattering scoreline failed to mask Bayern's dreadful defending in the first 45 minutes, which Guardiola admitted gave him cause for concern. ""That is the first time that I have been a bit disappointed and sad about the first half -- the fans didn't deserve that,"" said Guardiola. ""We were better in the second half, that's good for the mood ahead of the Madrid match, but it will be a completely different game. ""I trust my team and I hope that we can all manage it together."" Bayern are bidding to become the first side to retain the Champions League trophy and will be the first team since Juventus (1996-98) to reach three consecutive finals if they get past Madrid to reach the final in Lisbon on May 24. In contrast, Real are eager to reach their first Champions League final since winning the title in 2002 having bowed out at the semi-final stage for the last three seasons running. With Ronaldo and Bale both fit, Ancelotti is set to include both in his forward line alongside Benzema with Isco on the bench. Guardiola has some key selection decisions to make after Brazil's Rafinha struggled with the fleet-footed Real attack in Madrid and one option would be to move captain Philipp Lahm to right-back from the defensive midfield. Guardiola must also decide which stars to use in the attacking midfield after Germany pair Thomas Mueller and Mario Goetze both started on the bench in Madrid, with Mueller in particular voicing his discontent."
143,27/04/2014,19:31,Football: Defeat leaves Hamburg deep in relegation mire,Former European champions Hamburg remain in danger of being relegated from the Bundesliga for the first time in their history after losing 3-1 away to Augsburg on Sunday.,"They were three goals down inside 42 minutes as Turkey striker Halil Altintop scored a brace and Andre Hahn added another goal for the hosts, and Heiko Westermann's reply just before the interval proved to be a mere consolation for HSV. Hamburg won the European Cup in 1983 but have not won any major honours since 1987, and now their status as the only club in Germany's top flight never to have been relegated is under serious threat with only two games of the season remaining. Mirko Slomka's side lie 16th in the table, only a point clear of the automatic relegation places and with a home game against reigning European champions Bayern Munich and a tricky trip to Mainz still to come. Should Hamburg remain third from bottom, they will earn a reprieve in the form of a two-legged play-off against the side which finishes third in the second tier for the right to play top-flight football next season. Borussia Dortmund, who drew 2-2 with Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, will finish the season second to Bayern for the second year running after third-placed Schalke lost 1-0 at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday. A first-half strike from winger Patrick Herrmann gave Gladbach the win in Gelsenkirchen which left Schalke in third and seven points adrift of neighbours Dortmund with two games left. On Saturday, Bayern Munich warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League semi-final second leg at home to Real Madrid with a 5-2 come-from-behind win against Werder Bremen. Three days after their 1-0 first-leg loss in Madrid, Bayern fell behind twice against Bremen at the Allianz Arena before scoring four second-half goals without reply. The flattering scoreline failed to mask Bayern's woeful first-half defending, which must sound the alarm bells for coach Pep Guardiola given the danger of conceding an away goal to Real. Bayern have conceded the first goal in seven of their nine matches since winning the Bundesliga title late last month with a record seven matches to spare. Once again the Munich defence was left wanting in the first 45 minutes before the reigning European champions roared back. Bayern blasted Werder 7-0 in Bremen last December, but Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie fired the visitors into a 1-0 lead after 10 minutes at the Allianz Arena. France winger Franck Ribery equalised before Aaron Hunt capitalised on some poor marking for Bremen's second to make it 2-1 at the break. Bayern equalised again when Thomas Mueller headed on Ribery's corner and Claudio Pizarro was on hand to stab home his shot to make it 2-2 on 54 minutes, then the Peru veteran added his second against his old club four minutes later. Bastian Schweinsteiger then powered home a header on 61 minutes before Arjen Robben hit the top corner of the net to make it 5-2 on 74 minutes, less than 60 seconds after coming off the bench. On Saturday night Dortmund drew 2-2 at fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen with all four goals coming in the first 45 minutes. Goals by Lars Bender and Gonzalo Castro for the hosts were cancelled out by a header from Dortmund's Oliver Kirch and a Marco Reus penalty following a clear handball from Bayer defender Roberto Hilbert. VfL Wolfsburg's own hopes of Champions League qualification were dealt a blow when they were held to a 2-2 draw at home by Freiburg to stay fifth.

144,27/04/2014,18:20,Football: Defeat leaves Hamburg deep in relegation mire,Former European champions Hamburg remain in danger of being relegated from the Bundesliga for the first time in their history after losing 3-1 away to Augsburg on Sunday.,"They were three goals down inside 42 minutes as Turkey striker Halil Altintop scored a brace and Andre Hahn added another goal for the hosts, and Heiko Westermann's reply just before the interval proved to be a mere consolation for HSV. Hamburg won the European Cup in 1983 but have not won any major honours since 1987, and now their status as the only club in Germany's top flight never to have been relegated is under serious threat with only two games of the season remaining. Mirko Slomka's side lie 16th in the table, only a point clear of the automatic relegation places and with a home game against reigning European champions Bayern Munich and a tricky trip to Mainz still to come. Should Hamburg remain third from bottom, they will earn a reprieve in the form of a two-legged play-off against the side which finishes third in the second tier for the right to play top-flight football next season. On Saturday, Bayern Munich warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League semi-final second leg at home to Real Madrid with a 5-2 come-from-behind win against Werder Bremen. Three days after their 1-0 first-leg loss in Madrid, Bayern fell behind twice against Bremen at the Allianz Arena before scoring four second-half goals without reply. The flattering scoreline failed to mask Bayern's woeful first-half defending, which must sound the alarm bells for coach Pep Guardiola given the danger of conceding an away goal to Real. Bayern have conceded the first goal in seven of their nine matches since winning the Bundesliga title late last month with a record seven matches to spare. Once again the Munich defence was left wanting in the first 45 minutes before the reigning European champions roared back. Bayern blasted Werder 7-0 in Bremen last December, but Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie fired the visitors into a 1-0 lead after 10 minutes at the Allianz Arena. France winger Franck Ribery equalised before Aaron Hunt capitalised on some poor marking for Bremen's second to make it 2-1 at the break. Bayern equalised again when Thomas Mueller headed on Ribery's corner and Claudio Pizarro was on hand to stab home his shot to make it 2-2 on 54 minutes, then the Peru veteran added his second against his old club four minutes later. Bastian Schweinsteiger then powered home a header on 61 minutes before Arjen Robben hit the top corner of the net to make it 5-2 on 74 minutes, less than 60 seconds after coming off the bench. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund held fourth-placed hosts Bayer Leverkusen to a 2-2 draw with all four goals coming in the first 45 minutes. Goals by Lars Bender and Gonzalo Castro for the hosts were cancelled out by a header from Dortmund's Oliver Kirch and a Marco Reus penalty following a clear handball from Bayer defender Roberto Hilbert. VfL Wolfsburg's own hopes of Champions League qualification were dealt a blow when they were held to a 2-2 draw at home by Freiburg.

The breakthrough came when Mario Goezte found Pizarro and he scored Bayern's first goal in their last three league games. With the Braunschweig defence tiring, Mandzukic grabbed their second three minutes from time as Bayern won their first league match since winning the title nearly four weeks ago with a record seven games to spare. But just as they were in recent consecutive defeats to Augsburg and Borussia Dortmund, Bayern looked lethargic, despite coach Pep Guardiola's pre-match wish for a polished performance to take a ""good feeling"" to Madrid. ""It's not easy for us after winning the German title, but we fought despite a difficult situation"" said Guardiola. ""Braunschweig fought with heart and passion, which didn't make life easy for us.

Likewise, Werder Bremen are set to stay in the Bundesliga as their 3-1 win at home to Hoffenheim lifted them up to 11th and nine points from danger while mid-table Hertha Berlin and Augsburg shared the points in a goalless draw."

Despite enjoying their customary 65 percent possession and fielding a near full-strength team, Bayern needed 76 minutes to breach the Braunschweig defence with the hosts battling to preserve their top-flight status. The breakthrough came when Mario Goezte found Pizarro and he scored Bayern's first goal in their last three league games. With the Braunschweig defence growing tired, Mandzukic grabbed their second three minutes from time as Bayern won their first league match since winning the title nearly four weeks ago with a record seven games to spare. But just as they were in recent consecutive defeats to Augsburg and Borussia Dortmund, Bayern looked lethargic, despite coach Pep Guardiola's pre-match wish for a polished performance to take a ""good feeling"" to Madrid. ""It's not easy for us after winning the German title, but we fought despite a difficult situation"" said Guardiola. ""Braunschweig fought with heart and passion, which didn't make life easy for us. ""We had the game under more control after the break and I'm happy with the win. ""But we won't reach the Champions League final unless we put in a commanding performance against Real Madrid."" Bayern were without Manchester United-target Toni Kroos and Rafinha, who were both suspended, while left-back David Alaba was missing with a cold. Germany goalkeeper Manuer Neuer sat out the trip to Braunschweig as he recovers from a calf injury with reserve shot-stopper Lukas Raeder stepping in for the third time. The victory leaves Bayern on 81 points and 17 points clear of second-placed Dortmund who picked up their fifth straight win. Borussia enjoyed a 4-2 victory at home to ten-man Mainz 05 as coach Jurgen Klopp faced his former side having coached them from 2001-08. Dortmund took the lead after just six minutes through a curious goal when Milos Jojic's strike went in off the upper arm of Borussia's Oliver Kirch, but despite furious protests the goal stood. Japan striker Shinji Okazaki scored twice for Mainz to make it 2-2, his second after pouncing on a terrible back pass from Dortmund's Nuri Sahin. The Japanese international scoring either side of Bayern-bound Robert Lewandowski's strike for Dortmund. Dortmund made sure of the three points, which confirmed their Champions League direct qualification, with goals by defender Lukasz Piszczek and Germany winger Marco Reus, who converted a penalty 12 minutes from time after Mainz had centre-back Niko Bungert sent off for a handball. At the other end of the table, Freiburg are virtually assured of their survival in Germany's top flight as their 4-2 win at home to ten-man Borussia Moenchengladbach left them eight points above the relegation places with three games left.

155,18/04/2014,02:20,Football: Bayern eager for Real Madrid confidence boost,Bayern Munich need a convincing win at Bundesliga bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig on Saturday to dismiss talk of a mini-crisis ahead of their Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid.,"With only two wins in their last six games, Bayern have suffered a dip since winning the Bundesliga nearly a month ago with a record seven games to spare. Bayern booked their place in next month's German Cup final with a 5-1 drubbing of second division Kaiserslautern in Wednesday's semi-final in Munich. But Munich's director of sport Matthias Sammer said while the scoreline was impressive, the performance was lacking spark. Bayern have lost back-to-back league matches, an obvious concern ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, first leg at Real Madrid. ""I had the feeling that we're not really running hot at the moment,"" said Sammer, who questioned Bayern's desire to win the Champions League and German Cup finals. ""For the tasks we are facing, that's not enough. We have to ask ourselves if we still want to win these two titles."" On paper, Bayern's trip to Braunschweig looks straightforward, but the hosts have picked up seven points in their last four games to boost their survival bid. Braunschweig are without injured captain and striker Domi Kumbela, a rich source of goals for them in recent weeks, and are just three points from safety. Bayern will be without right-back Rafinha, who is serving a three-match ban after being sent off in last Saturday's 3-0 league defeat at home to Borussia Dortmund. There is also a question mark over Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer who missed the mid-week game with a calf strain. It remains to be seen whether coach Pep Guardiola rests his squad or looks for some continuity by naming a strong team four days before the trip to Real. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund host Mainz looking to pick up their fifth straight win having booked their German Cup final berth against Bayern on May 17. Dortmund enjoyed a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg in Tuesday's semi-final but both goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller (groin) and striker Robert Lewandowski (thigh) are carrying knocks. Lewandowski scored his 100th goal for Dortmund against Wolfsburg, but his final match in the black and yellow jersey will be against future employers Bayern in the cup final. Seventh-placed Mainz 05 now find themselves in a Europa League spot due to both cup finalists Dortmund and Bayern having qualified directly for next season's Champions League. A few shock results can be expected in the last four weeks of the season with sides desperate for points in the lower half of the table set to surprise those higher up. A good example is Saturday evening's tie when relegation-threatened Hamburg host VfL Wolfsburg, who are just a point off a Champions League berth for next season. Hamburg are the only team in Germany's top-flight to have never been relegated and have just four games left to escape the bottom three. Hamburg coach Mirko Slomka is without centre-back Heiko Westermann who has a groin injury. Wolves are without defensive midfielder Junior Malanda who tore knee ligaments in Tuesday's cup defeat at Dortmund. There will be a similar points battle when Nuremberg host Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday with the visitors eager to hold off Wolves and stay fourth. Second-from-bottom Nuremberg are two points from safety, but have lost their last three games. Likewise, Leverkusen have fragile confidence with only two wins in their last 13 matches despite their fourth place and fired coach Sami Hyypia a fortnight ago.

Hanover were reduced to ten men when midfielder Andre Hoffmann was sent off on 62 minutes for a dangerous foul before Jan Hochscheidt scored the hosts' third just before the final whistle. ""That was an important three points and for our fans it's also an important emotional win,"" said Braunschweig's relieved coach Torsten Lieberknecht whose side face champions Bayern Munich in a fortnight. The result leaves Braunschweig unbeaten in their last three games and just two points from safety, while Hanover are two points from the relegation mire after four straight defeats. Later, mid-table Hoffenheim held Hertha Berlin to a 1-1 draw in the capital as Sami Allagui's early goal was cancelled out by Poland international's Eugen Polanski equaliser with half an hour gone. Hoffenheim's Germany hopeful Kevin Volland was only denied the winning goal on the final whistle when his free-kick was palmed over the bar by Hertha goalkeeper Thomas Kraft. On Saturday, champions Bayern Munich suffered their first league defeat since October 2012 as their record 53-match unbeaten run was ended by a 1-0 defeat at Augsburg. Coach Pep Guardiola paid the price for naming a weakened team for the Bavarian derby with one eye on Wednesday's Champions League return leg at home to Manchester United. The Spaniard made seven changes from the side which drew 1-1 at Manchester United last Tuesday in the quarter-final first leg. Guardiola started with three teenagers in Augsburg, giving Bundesliga debuts to reserve team wing-backs Ylli Sallahi and Mitchell Weiser while Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg was named on the left wing. The gamble backfired when Weiser lost possession to Augsburg's Daniel Baier who fed Sascha Moelders and the  striker blasted his shot past Bayern's goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with 31 minutes gone to claim the winning goal. This was only Bayern's third defeat of the season in all competitions having already been confirmed Bundesliga champions ten days ago with a record seven games to spare. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund earned a morale-boosting 2-1 win at home to VfL Wolfsburg ahead of Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final, second-leg at home to Real Madrid. After Croatia's Ivica Olic gave Wolves an early lead, a Robert Lewandowski header put Dortmund level before Germany winger Marco Reus hit the 77th-minute winner. Borussia face a near-impossible task of overturning a 3-0 defeat from the first leg against Real to reach the Champions League's semi-finals. Schalke 04 are now three points adrift of Dortmund in third as they came from behind to claim a 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen. At the other end of the table, VfB Stuttgart improved their chances of avoiding relegation with a 2-0 win at home to Freiburg to escape the bottom three with goals by Romania's Alexandru Maxim and Austria's Martin Harnik. Nuremberg drop to second from bottom after their 2-0 defeat at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach, who moved up to fourth and into the Champions League places at the expense of Bayer Leverkusen. Leverkusen sacked coach Sami Hyypia on Saturday less than 24 hours after their 2-1 defeat at strugglers Hamburg which left them facing a battle to qualify for next season's Champions League. Hyypia, who took on his first senior coaching role last August, has been replaced by Sascha Lewandowski, the head coach of Leverkusen's junior side, who has five games to rescue their Champions League status."

Having won the title with a record seven games to spare following their 3-1 win at Hertha Berlin ten days ago, Dante admits the European champions have suffered a slight dip. With the title already confirmed, Bayern were held to a 3-3 league draw at home to Hoffenheim last Saturday, then 1-1 at Old Trafford against Manchester United in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday. ""After winning the title in Berlin, things were a bit complicated, but I get the impression that we're back now and we will be at full throttle again,"" said Dante. The Brazilian was suspended for Old Trafford and is itching for his chance against Augsburg ahead of Wednesday's second leg against David Moyes' United. ""We're already champions, but we definitely won't go to Augsburg and give anything away,"" said Dante. ""It's a derby, we have to win for our fans."" Bayern will be without reserve left-back Diego Contento, who has damaged a ligament in his left ankle, meaning first-choice David Alaba is likely to start at Augsburg. Bayern are aiming to become the first team to go through a Bundesliga season unbeaten and are on a record undefeated league run of 53 German league matches, dating back to October 2012. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund host VfL Wolfsburg needing a confidence-boosting win ahead of Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg clash against Real Madrid having lost 3-0 in Spain in the first-leg. Dortmund will welcome back Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, who was suspended for the first leg in Madrid. ""First, we need to get a positive result against Wolfsburg on Saturday, and then we'll mobilise the troops for the return (against Real Madrid),"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. Wolfsburg have won their last two games and are just a point behind fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen, who are in danger of dropping out of the Champions League places completely for next season.

On Saturday, champions Bayern Munich dropped points for only the third time in the Bundesliga this season as they were held 3-3 at home by Hoffenheim. Hoffenheim ended Bayern's record run of 19 consecutive Bundesliga wins, giving the Munich giants a wake-up call ahead of their Champions League quarter-final first leg at Manchester United on Tuesday. Spain midfielder Thiago Alcantara has been ruled out of both quarter-final legs against United with a knee injury and is expected to miss the next six to eight weeks. Bayern leaked three goals in a Bundesliga match for the first time this season after throwing away a 3-1 first-half lead following goals by veteran striker Claudio Pizarro and Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri. Bosnia midfielder Sejad Salihovic curled in a 44th-minute free kick to make it 3-2 at the break after striker Anthony Modeste gave the guests an early lead. Hoffenheim equalised on 75 minutes when Brazilian left winger Roberto Firmino darted on to a through ball and his shot beat both Bayern centre-back Dante and goalkeeper Tom Starke. Despite the draw, Bayern still remain 23 points clear at the top of the table and extended their record unbeaten Bundesliga run to 53 matches. Germany winger Marco Reus netted a hat-trick as second-placed Borussia Dortmund fought back from two goals down to win 3-2 at ten-man Stuttgart. Dortmund, who face Real Madrid away on Wednesday in the Champions League quarter-finals, found themselves 2-0 down after just 20 minutes. Christian Gentner and Martin Harnik took advantage of poor defending to net for the hosts before Reus scored all of the guests' goals. Bayer Leverkusen hold on to fourth place despite drawing 1-1 at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig as Sami Hyypia's side struggle for form with one win in their last 11 games. Braunschweig took a shock lead through defender Ken Reichel just after the break before Stefan Kiessling slotted home a 53rd-minute penalty to spare Bayer's blushes. Fifth-placed VfL Wolfsburg are just a point behind Leverkusen after their 2-1 win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt with Brazil defender Naldo scoring their 89th-minute winner. Freiburg are unbeaten in their last four games as they enjoyed a 3-2 win at home to Nuremberg to move five points clear of the relegation zone. Mainz remain seventh but in the hunt for a European place with a 3-0 win at home to Augsburg while on Friday Schalke 04 were 2-0 winners against Hertha Berlin.

Both winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller have colds while right-back Lukasz Piszczek is struggling with a leg injury.

Second-from-bottom Stuttgart desperately need the three points to escape the relegation places, but Dortmund need a confidence-boosting win ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final at Real Madrid. ""The Real game is still a fair way off and I don't get the feeling that our next Champions League opponents are a topic in the changing room,"" added Klopp. Sami Hyypia's fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen host bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig having picked up their first win in 10 matches with a 3-1 victory at Augsburg on Wednesday.

Bayern's 2-0 win at Mainz 05 on Saturday kept them a massive 23 points clear in the league and they will finally be uncatchable if they win at Hertha having dominated all season. ""There's obviously a great sense of anticipation,"" said Bayern's Austria left-back David Alaba. ""We know that we haven't achieved anything yet, so we'll be going there in a serious mood. ""We want to win the Bundesliga trophy as quickly as possible."" Bayern face an away leg at Manchester United on April 1 in the Champions League's quarter-finals and are eager to get the Bundesliga title wrapped up as quickly as possible to focus on Europe. Bayern are not expected to have too many problems at Berlin's Olympic Stadium with Hertha having lost their last two games and went down 3-0 at Borussia Moechengldabach on Saturday. There are considerable security concerns for Tuesday's Ruhr derby as second-placed Borussia Dortmund host Schalke 04, who are just a point behind in third. Dortmund are on a final warning from the German Football Association (DFB) and tensions are high with third-placed Schalke a point behind their rivals and violence has marred their recent meetings. Around 3,000 police officers are expected to be on duty on Tuesday in one of the biggest police operations for a German football match. Police say they expect around 500 violent fans from both teams while 90 individuals have already been banned. The DFB will be paying close attention having fined Borussia 60,000 euros (US$82,764) and threatened sanctions on Friday after Dortmund fans were involved in incidents at three separate league matches. Rioting broke out at last October's Ruhr derby in Gelsenkirchen at Schalke's Veltins Arena when a group of Dortmund fans stormed into an area of the ground for home fans. The DFB have told Dortmund they will have to play one league game with their famous South Stand empty if there is any more trouble from their fans in the next seven months. Sami Hyypia's fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen are at Augsburg on Wednesday looking for their first win since the start of February having lost eight of their last nine games.

171,21/03/2014,02:36,Football: March madness as Bayern on verge of record triumph,Bayern Munich could be crowned German league champions in record time on Saturday if they win at Mainz 05.,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern hold an enormous 23-point lead and victory would given them the title providing rivals Borussia Dortmund fail to win at Hanover and Schalke do not beat bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig at home. Should Bayern wrap up a 24th German league title at Mainz, they will do so with eight games to spare, breaking their own record of six, set last season. No side has ever been crowned German champions in March and Bayern are bidding to become the first team to go through an entire Bundesliga campaign unbeaten. Mainz, who are on their own five-match unbeaten run, have risen to fifth in the table and are challenging for a Champions League place next season. But the Rhineland club are all too aware of the enormous task facing them against the European champions. ""Perhaps the club who finally break Bayern Munich's unbeaten run should be given an extra cup to mark the achievement. That's what we're trying to win on Saturday,"" said Mainz manager Christian Heidel. Bayern will be at near full strength, while Mainz are waiting on the fitness of Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting who has had a stomach infection. ""We need to be brave and believe in a sensational win against Bayern Munich,"" said Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel. Should Bayern claim the title, any celebrations will be muted with the Bavarian giants in the quarter-finals of the Champions League and determined to defend their title. ""(Any party) wouldn't last long, we still have too many games ahead of us,"" said Bayern's Dutch winger Arjen Robben. ""We have a game every two or three days coming up and the focus is on the Champions League."" Even if Bayern's bid is foiled this weekend, they can still claim the title at Hertha Berlin on Tuesday. ""We will be champions, but exactly when is secondary,"" said Bayern's attacking midfielder Toni Kroos. Dortmund travel to Hanover 96 on Saturday without Germany left-back Marcel Schmelzer, who has a torn muscle in his pelvis, to add to their latest injury woes. The 26-year-old suffered the injury in the later stages of Dortmund's 2-1 defeat at home to Zenit St Petersburg on Wednesday in the last 16 of the Champions League. Dortmund still reached the quarter-finals with a 5-4 win on aggregate having won the first-leg in Russia 4-2 three weeks ago. Schmelzer's misfortune is the latest in a string of ailments to befall Dortmund, who are already without long-term knee injury-victims centre-back Neven Subotic and winger Jakub Blaszczykowski. Despite last Saturday's 2-1 defeat at home to Moenchengladbach, Dortmund are second in the table and are hoping to welcome back Germany winger Marco Reus, who has missed their recent games with a leg injury. Schalke 04 host Braunschweig without captain Benedikt Hoewedes, who has torn his left groin and becomes the ninth Royal Blues' player on the injury list. This is the third injury of the season for the 26-year-old Germany centre-back, who suffered the tear in Tuesday's 3-1 defeat at Real Madrid in the Champions League.

Hamburg's Germany goalkeeper Rene Adler pulled off a stunning save to deny Jose Campana's free-kick after Swiss striker Josip Drmic scored the guests' late consolation goal in added time. With Hamburg desperate to avoid their first relegation from Germany's top flight, Mirko Slomka replaced Bert van Marwijk as coach a month ago and saw his side climb to 14th. ""We've overtaken two teams now, which means nothing other than we now have something to defend -- namely, not being in the relegation places,"" said Slomka. Nuremberg drop to 15th while VfB Stuttgart, who drew 1-1 at Werder Bremen on Saturday under new coach Huub Stevens, find themselves second from bottom. Freiburg moved up to 16th, but stay in the relegation places, with a 4-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday as five points now separate the bottom five teams. At the top of the table, leaders Bayern Munich can be crowned champions next Saturday -- with a record eight games to spare -- as their 2-1 win at home to Bayer Leverkusen left them 23 points clear. The European champions will be confirmed as German champions for the 24th time if they win at Mainz next Saturday and rivals Dortmund and Schalke both draw. Goals by Mario Mandzukic and Bastian Schweinsteiger saw Bayern enjoy their 17th straight league win and extend their record unbeaten Bundesliga run to 50 matches. Former Germany striker Stefan Kiessling gave Leverkusen a consolation goal when he headed home just before the final whistle. The victory capped arguably the most turbulent week in Bayern's history after ex-president Uli Hoeness resigned on Friday, 24 hours after being convicted of tax fraud. He was sentenced to three-and-a-half years by Munich's regional court having defrauded the state of 28.5 million euros ($39.5 million) in unpaid taxes. Leverkusen were the last German team to beat Bayern, back in October 2012, but Sami Hyypia's side offered little resistance as they suffered their seventh defeat in eight matches. They had already dropped to fourth after being knocked from third by Schalke's 2-1 win at Augsburg on Friday when Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored both goals. Bayern's relentless march to the title was helped after second-placed Borussia Dortmund suffered a 2-1 defeat at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach earlier on Saturday. Gladbach earned their first win in ten games to dent Dortmund's confidence ahead of Wednesday's Champions League last 16 clash at home to Zenit St Petersburg when they hold a 4-2 lead from the first leg. Dortmund are now just one point clear of third-placed Schalke ahead of the Ruhr Valley derby on March 25. Swiss coach Lucien Favre extended his Gladbach contract last week until 2017 and his side produced a devastating first-half spell with two goals in nine  minutes at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. Brazilian striker Raffael wrong-footed Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller on 31 minutes, then Max Kruse fired home five minutes before the break. Gladbach midfielder Havard Nordtveit was sent off for a second yellow card for the final 20 minutes and new-signing Milos Jojic pulled one back for Dortmund on 77 minutes. Mainz moved up to fifth with a sensational 4-2 victory at Hoffenheim with Japan's Shinji Okazaki netting their last two goals as the guests scored three times in seven stunning second-half minutes to come from 2-0 down. The win keeps Thomas Tuchel's Mainz in the hunt for a European spot next season and are only three points short of a Champions League berth. Wolfsburg drop to sixth after their 1-1 draw at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig as only three points separate the bottom four clubs including Freiburg, Hamburg and Stuttgart. Hertha's European aspirations suffered a setback as they lost 2-0 at home to Hanover 96 to stay ninth and four points off the top six."

Nuremberg drop to 15th while VfB Stuttgart, who drew 1-1 at Werder Bremen on Saturday under new coach Huub Stevens, find themselves down among the relegation places. At the top of the table, leaders Bayern Munich can be crowned champions next Saturday -- with a record eight games to spare -- as their 2-1 win at home to Bayer Leverkusen left them 23 points clear in the table. The European champions will be confirmed as German champions for the 24th time if they win at Mainz next Saturday and rivals Dortmund and Schalke both draw. Goals by Mario Mandzukic and Bastian Schweinsteiger saw Bayern enjoy their 17th straight league win and extend their record unbeaten Bundesliga run to 50 matches. Former Germany striker Stefan Kiessling gave Leverkusen a consolation goal when he headed home just before the final whistle. The victory capped arguably the most turbulent week in Bayern's history after ex-president Uli Hoeness resigned on Friday, 24 hours after being convicted of tax fraud. He was sentenced to three-and-a-half years by Munich's regional court having defrauded the state of 28.5 million euros ($39.5 million) in unpaid taxes. Leverkusen were the last German team to beat Bayern, back in October 2012, but Sami Hyypia's side offered little resistance as they suffered their seventh defeat in eight matches. They had already dropped to fourth after being knocked from third by Schalke's 2-1 win at Augsburg on Friday when Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored both goals. The victory was a welcome boost for Schalke ahead of Tuesday's trip to Real Madrid where they face the near-impossible task of over-turning their 6-1 home leg defeat. Bayern's relentless march to the title was helped after second-placed Borussia Dortmund suffered a 2-1 defeat at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach earlier on Saturday. Gladbach earned their first win in ten games to dent Dortmund's confidence ahead of Wednesday's Champions League last 16 clash at home to Zenit St Petersburg when they hold a 4-2 lead from the first leg. Dortmund are now just one point clear of third-placed Schalke ahead of the Ruhr Valley derby on March 25. Swiss coach Lucien Favre extended his Gladbach contract last week until 2017 and his side produced a devastating first-half spell with two goals in nine  minutes at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. Brazilian striker Raffael wrong-footed Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller on 31 minutes, then Max Kruse fired home five minutes before the break. Gladbach midfielder Havard Nordtveit was sent off for a second yellow card for the final 20 minutes and new-signing Milos Jojic pulled one back for Dortmund on 77 minutes. Mainz moved up to fifth with a sensational 4-2 victory at Hoffenheim with Japan's Shinji Okazaki netting their last two goals as the guests scored three times in seven stunning second-half minutes to come from 2-0 down. The win keeps Thomas Tuchel's Mainz in the hunt for a European spot next season and are only three points short of a Champions League berth. Wolfsburg drop to sixth after their 1-1 draw at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig as only three points separate the bottom four clubs including Freiburg, Hamburg and Stuttgart. Hertha's European aspirations suffered a setback as they lost 2-0 at home to Hanover 96 to stay ninth and four points off the top six."

""Tax evasion was the mistake of my life,"" Hoeness said in a statement on the Bayern website. ""I want to avert harm to my club. ""Bayern Munich is my life's work and always will be. ""I will stay committed to this great club and its people as long as I live."" Having been the driving force behind the Champions League holders since joining them as an 18-year-old in 1970, Hoeness played a huge part in turning them into a European powerhouse. Bayern have won 21 of their 23 German league titles and all five of their European Cup or Champions League victories with him involved either as a player, club manager or president. Leverkusen have problems of their own and last won on February 7, losing six of their last seven matches.

Guardiola is all too aware that Arsenal claimed a 2-0 win in Munich at the same stage in Europe last season, although Bayern went through on away goals to eventually win the final. ""If we give Arsenal too much possession, we will have big, big problems,"" warned Guardiola. ""If we keep the ball, we'll get into the quarter-finals, if they control it, they'll go through."" Arsenal prepared for their trip to Bavaria with a 4-1 FA Cup quarter-final win over Everton. Gunners manager Arsene Wenger has said the victory, with goals from Mesut Ozil, Mikel Arteta, plus two from Olivier Giroud, put them ""in a good frame of mind psychologically"". But Guardiola is wary as Wolfsburg were still in Saturday's Bundesliga match with 30 minutes left until Bayern ran riot after a below-par first 45 minutes. Germany winger Thomas Mueller and Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic grabbed two goals each as the score leapt from 2-1 after 63 minutes to 6-1 with 80 minutes on the clock. It was a particularly good day for Mandzukic, who came off the bench against his old club for the last 33 minutes to score twice, and give him 16 goals for the season. The 27-year-old has now netted six times in his last five league games to take over from Borussia Dortmund's Robert Lewandowski as the league's top scorer. With second-placed Dortmund playing Freiburg on Sunday, Bayern have opened a record 23-point lead at the top of the table. The win in Wolfsburg was Bayern's 16th Bundesliga victory in a row and bettered their own league record of 15 straight wins in 2005. It extended their record unbeaten league run to 49 matches. It matches Arsenal's Premier League record of 49 games without defeat set in 2004 and is bettered only by AC Milan's record of 58 matches unbeaten from 1991-1993 in Europe's top leagues. Bayern's haul of 72 goals from their first 24 league games broke Werder Bremen's previous record of 70 set in 1985/86 and Bayern have only dropped four points with 22 wins in 24 games."

Ribery, UEFA's best player in Europe last season, has not played for Bayern in more than a month after an operation on his buttocks, but made an appearance for France on Wednesday. ""I felt good, those few minutes against the Netherlands were good to get some match practice back. I'm ready,"" said Ribery after France enjoyed a 2-0 win over the Dutch. Bayern are looking to extend their record unbeaten league run to 49 matches and to claim their 11th consecutive victory. Fifth-placed Wolfsburg were hammered 6-2 at Hoffenheim last Sunday and Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer expects a backlash at the Volkswagen Arena. ""They suffered a setback in Hoffenheim and they will try and show a reaction, so we must have a few answers to that,"" said Sammer. With a 20-point lead, Bayern could even wrap up the Bundesliga title before the end of the month. Coach Pep Guardiola will want a convincing win before Tuesday's Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Arsenal with the hosts leading 2-0 from the first-leg in London. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund head to Freiburg on Sunday with a shortage of strikers. Poland's Robert Lewandowski sat out Wednesday's international against Scotland with a knee strain and Under-23 striker Marvin Ducksch is out for a fortnight with an ankle injury. It leaves Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp with only reserve striker Julian Schieber fit, but Germany winger Marco Reus could be switched to play up front. Bayer Leverkusen coach Sami Hyypia is enduring the first crisis of his career after five straight defeats as they look for a first victory in seven years at Hanover 96 on Saturday. ""My coaching career has not been very long and this is the first time that I'm in such a situation,"" said the 40-year-old ex-Liverpool defender. ""Of course, I have spoken to many people to ask advice on what I could do. ""I want to develop myself and I wouldn't be learning so fast if we weren't in this situation."" Hyypia is hoping to have defensive midfielder Sven Bender back after a dead leg. Schalke 04 are looking to bounce back from successive horror defeats when they host Hoffenheim. The Royal Blues were drubbed 6-1 by Real Madrid in the Champions League, then crashed 5-1 at Bayern last Sunday in the Bundesliga. ""We have to look forward now and give the right response on the pitch against Hoffenheim,"" said coach Jens Keller. Peru winger Jefferson Farfan is doubtful with an inflamed knee while centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos is definitely out after being sent off in Munich. At the other end of the table, VfB Stuttgart coach Thomas Schneider must avoid a ninth straight defeat when his side host bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Schneider came close to being dismissed after Sunday's 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt and another loss would surely mean the 41-year-old being fired, despite having only taken charge in August.

Bayern extended their record unbeaten league run to 48 matches, dating back to October 2012, and earned their 15th straight league victory. ""My son will enjoy having the match ball, my kids are my biggest fans,"" said Dutch winger and father of three Robben. ""We play with so much aggression and tempo, we really put our foot down. ""The title is getting every closer, we played with so much passion, which we need for the big games, especially in the Champions League."" With just three minutes gone, left-back David Alaba netted a free-kick, then Robben scored either side of Mario Mandzukic's header from a superb Alaba cross to make it 4-0 at the break. Schalke were gifted a goal when Jefferson Farfan's corner was turned into his own net by Munich right-back Rafinha, in for captain Philipp Lahm, with 25 minutes left. To compound Schalke's misery, Greece centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos was shown a straight red for bringing down Mandzukic in the area. His foul allowed Robben to wrap up his hat-trick with a 77th-minute penalty. ""You can't get much worse than that,"" fumed Schalke captain Benedikt Hoewedes, who had a miserable 26th birthday. ""That was highly embarassing and we need to apologise to our fans. ""We gave them way too much respect.""

187,28/02/2014,02:15,Football: Schalke head to buoyant Bayern after Real rout,"Fresh from their record European defeat at home to Real Madrid, Schalke 04 face another potential drubbing when they travel to all-conquering Bayern Munich on Saturday.","Schalke were routed 6-1 in Gelsenkirchen on Wednesday as Real's stars ran riot with Karem Benzema, Gareth Bale and Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo each netting two goals. ""We have no choice, but to write off the game,"" said Schalke midfielder Julian Draxler in the wake of the Real debacle. ""We have to get it out of our heads and prepare for Bayern."" Ronaldo finished with ten shots on goal, the same as the entire Schalke team. The Royal Blues now face an equally tough challenge at Bayern, who have won all of their last 14 games and are on a record 47-match unbeaten run. ""They (Bayern) are even better than Real, but we're not just going there to limit the damage,"" said Schalke's director of sport Horst Heldt. Bayern's 4-0 romp at Hanover 96 last Sunday left Pep Guardiola's European champions 19-points clear at the top of the table. If they maintain their lead, their 24th German league title can be confirmed by the end of March at the latest and they have dropped just four points all season. They are on course to become the first Bundesliga side to complete a season unbeaten. In contrast, Schalke's Real debacle was the worst home defeat by a German side in Champions League history and has had a physical effect, as well as battering their confidence. Both centre-back Felipe Santana and central midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng are ruled out with leg injuries. Left-back Sead Kolasinac has a bruised jaw and defensive midfielder Roman Neustaedter has a knee injury. ""It makes no sense to use ailing players, so others will have to get involved,"" said Heldt with a host of changes expected. Bayern are set to welcome back left wing Xherdan Shaqiri while Franck Ribery continues to recover from buttocks surgery. Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger is set to make his second start after back-to-back injuries. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund host Nuremberg on Saturday with concerns at centre-back. Greece defender Sokratis is nursing a foot injury from their 4-2 Champions League last 16, first-leg win at Zenit St Petersburg. Coach Jurgen Klopp is without both his first-choice centre backs. Mats Hummels is on the verge of returning from an ankle knock while Neven Subotic is out for the season with a torn knee ligament. Bayer Leverkusen are second in the table, but low on confidence as they host resurgent Mainz 05 after a horror sequence of seven losses in nine games. Following the shock German Cup defeat at home to second-division Kaiserslautern, Bayer were routed 4-0 at home to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, then crashed 3-1 at Wolfsburg last weekend in the league. ""They have been the worst ten days,"" admitted striker Stefan Kiessling. Leverkusen will be without winger Gonzalo Castro and defender Emir Spahic who are both suspended. Mainz are ninth, but closing in on a top six place after losing just one of their last eight games. There is a relegation battle brewing in the north German derby when strugglers Werder Bremen host Hamburg, who are third from bottom. Hamburg's new coach Mirko Slomka made his debut in last Saturday's shock 3-0 win at home to Borussia Dortmund which broke their run of eight straight defeats. Bremen are winless in their last 11 matches and have just one victory from their last 11 matches. Playing Friday (All times 1430 GMT unless stated) Hertha Berlin v Freiburg (1930)"

191,14/02/2014,02:10,Football: Bayern welcome back Schweinsteiger as Arsenal await,Bayern Munich hope Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger will start against Freiburg in the Bundesliga on Saturday as the holders warm-up for next week's Champions League clash at Arsenal.,"The 29-year-old made his comeback after three months out with an ankle injury, playing the last 25 minutes of Wednesday's 5-0 romp at Hamburg in the German Cup quarter-finals. Schweinsteiger is set to feature at Munich's Allianz Arena as the European champions prepare to face the Gunners away in Wednesday's last 16, first leg, of the Champions League. Coach Pep Guardiola welcomed back his midfield general: ""It's super, super, super news, he has huge experience, but he still needs time."" Such is Bayern's strength in depth that they have continued to pick up wins even without the likes of Schweinsteiger and injured France winger Franck Ribery, who is out until March after an operation on his buttocks. Bayern have won all of their last nine matches, are unbeaten in a record 45 league matches and are 13 points clear in the table. Freiburg coach Christian Streich has suggested some unusual tactics against the league leaders -- to make sure Bayern enjoy themselves. ""Bayern should have fun and they only have that when they play against a good opponent,"" said the eccentric Streich, with his side 15th in the league, just above the relegation places. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund are chasing a second win this week over Eintracht Frankfurt at home. Gabon international winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang headed home Dortmund's second-half winner at Frankfurt in Tuesday's 1-0 cup quarter-final victory. Frankfurt climbed up to 12th in the table with a 3-0 win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig last Saturday as they bounced back from their 5-0 drubbing at Bayern the week before. Dortmund are hoping to have Germany midfielders Marco Reus and Sven Bender back after the pair both suffered thigh injuries in last Saturday's 5-1 win over Werder Bremen. ""We'll have to see, we don't want to take a risk with either of them,"" said coach Jurgen Klopp with both expected to train on Friday. There is still no news on when Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan will return to training after suffering from a virus. Bert van Marwijk is in a precarious position as he takes 17th-placed Hamburg to bottom side Eintracht Frankfurt with huge doubts over his future after a club record of six league defeats. Ex-Bayern, Schalke and Wolfsburg coach Felix Magath has already been widely tipped to replace former Holland coach Van Marwijk, who only took charge in September. Director of sport Oliver Kreuzer said he only has a job guarantee until Saturday, but another defeat could well be the Dutchman's last. Saturday's top clash sees second-side Bayer Leverkusen, who suffered a shock 1-0 cup defeat at home to second-division Kaiserslautern on Wednesday, host fourth-placed Schalke. Schalke were buoyed on Thursday when captain and centre-back Benedikt Hoewedes made a surprise return to training sooner than expected after recovering from a leg injury. ""The healing process has gone very, very well, but he still has a few problems and is still questionable,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. Keller said right back Atsuto Uchida has flown back to Japan and could face an operation for a leg injury, while midfielders Julian Draxler and Roman Neustaedter are both in the squad for Leverkusen.

Centre-back Mats Hummels was out with an ankle knock, while winger Jakub Blaszczykowski and defender Neven Subotic are out for the season with knee injuries. Frankfurt captain Pirmin Schwegler was missing with bruised ribs.

""We didn't use our chances before the break, we tried to inmpose our game on them, but it is difficult to do that against an opponent like that,"" said Eintracht coach Armin Veh. ""Nevertheless, we want to try and get something out of Saturday's match at Dortmund,"" he added referring to Frankfurt's delicate state as they are just four points above the relegation zone. Robert Lewandowski had a battle royal with his marker, Peru's Carlos Zambrano, who at one point left the Poland striker pole-axed on the turf after a sharp elbow to the ribs, which was missed by referee Knut Kircher.

Reports in the German media say the 25-year-old had the tyres stolen from his Porsche Cayenne GTS, which costs around 90,000 euros ($123,000) and was parked outside his Dortmund home, with only bricks left to keep the car off the ground. Lewandowski's car was tipped forward during the suspected prank, badly damaging the front brakes. The high jinx will not be cheap. A brand-new set of winter tyres will cost around 2500 euros for Lewandowski, who is reported to earn up to four million euros at Dortmund and local police confirmed they have received a complaint for the missing tyres. Dortmund fans are suspected of carrying out the attack after the Poland striker fell out with supporters when he announced in January that he would be joining rivals Bayern Munich at the end of the season, ending weeks of speculation. Lewandowski's Dortmund contract expires in June and he leaves for Bayern on a free contract having scored 24 league goals in 31 league games last season, plus 10 in last season's Champions League, as Dortmund lost to Bayern in the Wembley final. This is not the first time Lewandowski has run into trouble with Dortmund fans. Three weeks ago, he was investigated by police after he was alleged to have struck a teenage Dortmund fan who showed him the middle finger.

""That was a game where there was nothing to criticise."" In a double-header, Frankfurt host 2012 German Cup winners Dortmund in the cup on Tuesday, then travel to Borussia's Westfalenstadion on Saturday for a league match. The double injury blow is more bad news for Klopp who lost Germany defender Mats Hummels last week after the centre-back injured his foot in a friendly and will miss the Frankfurt double-header. Klopp is already without both centre-back Neven Subotic and winger Jakub Blaszczykowski for the rest of the season as the pair have torn knee ligament injuries.

""We normally do well against Borussia at home, we lost 2-1 to them earlier this season and drew 3-3 last season, which was a real spectacle,"" said Eintracht midfielder Alexander Maier. ""If we put in our best performance, we make it tough for any team to beat us and we'll try everything to pull off a shock.""

Dortmund doubled the lead at Bremen's Weser Stadion when Arminia's Mkhitaryan scored his first league goal since September when he held off a challenge from Holland's Eljero Elia and blasted his shot into the left-hand corner four minutes from the break. Veteran centre-back Manuel Friedrich then volleyed home just after the break to claim his first Bundesliga goal for two years. Lukasz Piszczek's shot clipped the cross bar on 56 minutes, but Dortmund grabbed their fourth when Mkhitaryan curled in his second after Marco Reus's superb back-heel pass on 62 minutes before Lewandowski added a late fifth. Bremen midfielder Levent Aycicek scored a late consolation on his Bundesliga debut, but there was precious little else for Werder fans to enjoy. This was the 12th time this season Bremen have conceded three or more goals and coach Robin Dutt is under increasing pressure with his side 13th and just three points from the relegation places. In the basement battle, Eintracht Frankfurt moved up to 12th with a 3-0 win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Freiburg were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Hoffenheim while sixth-placed VfL Wolfsburg enjoyed a 3-0 win at home to Mainz 05. On Friday, second-placed Bayer Leverkusen enjoyed a 1-0 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach with South Korea's Son Heung-Min scoring the second-half winner."
204,08/02/2014,17:40,Football: Dominant Bayern extend record runs at Nuremberg,European champions Bayern Munich extended both their unbeaten league records with a 2-0 win at Nuremberg on Saturday as the Bavarian giants remained 13 points clear in the Bundesliga.,"The 39-point gulf between the two teams in the league table was clear as run-away leaders Bayern have now collected 56 of a possible 60 points this season. This was Bayern's 45th unbeaten Bundesliga match, dating back to October 2012, and their 29th unbeaten away game to add to their league records. Nuremberg came into the game in resurgent mood with two previous wins, but the defeat dropped them back into the bottom three. Bayern needed just 17 minutes to take the lead at Nuremberg's Grundig Stadium when Germany star Mario Goetze put David Alaba in space down the flank and the Austria left-back flicked in a cross for Mario Mandzukic to volley home. The Croatia striker then turned provider when he put captain Philipp Lahm in space to fire home on 49 minutes as Bayern counter-attacked. It should have been more when Arjen Robben hit the post ten minutes later, but Bayern were in complete control. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund enjoyed a 5-1 win at Werder Bremen with Poland striker Robert Lewandowski and attacking midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan both scoring twice. Dortmund made their pressing game count when defender Marcel Schmelzer pounced on a mistake on the left and slid his pass in for Lewandowski to hit the top right-hand corner with 26 minutes gone. Dortmund doubled the lead at Bremen's Weser Stadion when Arminia's Mkhitaryan scored his first league goal since September when he held off a challenge from Holland's Eljero Elia and blasted his shot into the left-hand corner four minutes from the break. Veteran centre-back Manuel Friedrich then volleyed home just after the break to claim his first Bundesliga goal for two years since he was at Bayer Leverkusen, but signed by Dortmund last November to ease their injury crisis. Lukasz Piszczek's shot clipped the cross bar on 56 minutes, but Dortmund were not to be denied a fourth when Mkhitaryan curled in his second after Marco Reus's superb back-heel pass on 62 minutes before Lewandowski added a late fifth. Bremen midfielder Levent Aycicek scored a late consolation on his Bundesliga debut, but there was precious little else for Werder fans to enjoy. This was the 12th time this season Bremen have conceded three or more goals and coach Robin Dutt is under increasing pressure with his side 13th and just three points from the relegation places. In the basement battle, Eintracht Frankfurt moved up to 12th with a 3-0 win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Frankfurt took an early lead through midfielder Johannes Flum, but then killed off the game with two goals in as many minutes from attacking midfielder Alexander Maier and striker Stefan Aigner. Freiburg were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Hoffenheim while sixth-placed VfL Wolfsburg enjoyed a 3-0 win at home to Mainz 05. On Friday, second-placed Bayer Leverkusen enjoyed a 1-0 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach with South Korea's Son Heung-Min scoring the second-half winner."
205,07/02/2014,23:02,Football: Son's strike adds to Gladbach's misery,South Korean striker Son Heung-Min hit his eighth Bundesliga goal of the season on Friday to seal Bayer Leverkusen's 1-0 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach as the hosts' slump continued.,"Sami Hyypia-coached Leverkusen tightened their grip on second place in the table to go seven points clear of Borussia Dortmund, who are at Werder Bremen on Sunday. Leverkusen are still 10 points behind leaders Bayern Munich, who are at Nuremberg on Saturday, while Gladbach are now winless in their last five games. Korea's Son hit the winner on 62 minutes with a bullet of a shot off his right foot. A pass from Germany winger Sidney Sam found Son on the edge of the area to hit the top left-hand corner, giving Borussia goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen no chance. ""It was a very important game for us as we came in with only a four-point lead, so we're very happy,"" said Son. ""It was a good pass and I got the ball in a good position, so it gave me space to shoot. ""It's something I often practice in training and I'm delighted it came off. ""We put the work in today and we deserved the three points."" Lucien Favre's Gladbach started 2014 third in the league, but they suffered their three consecutive defeat on Friday which leaves them down in fifth. Their nightmare run at home to Leverkusen, who they have not beaten in Monechengladbach for 25 years, continued. The last time they beat Bayer at home was their 2-0 win on February 22 1989, less then eight months before the Berlin Wall fell. The hosts had their chances with 14 shots on goal, compared to Bayer's 12, and both Germany striker Max Kruse and winger Patrick Herrmann went close. There was an unusual yellow card handed out by referee Florian Meyer when substitute Philipp Wollscheid was booked while on the bench after only nine minutes. The replacement defender threw a spare ball into play and was swiftly shown a yellow card. Leverkusen have a busy programme as they host Schalke 04 next Saturday before Paris Saint Germain visit them in the Champions League's last 16, first round tie on February 18."
206,07/02/2014,02:15,Football: Resurgent Nuremberg out to topple giants Bayern,"Strugglers Nuremberg have hauled themselves out of the Bundesliga's relegation places, but their new-found form faces the acid test on Saturday against runaway league leaders Bayern Munich.","The Franconians became the last team in a major European league to pick up their first win of the season only a fortnight ago with a 4-0 win at home to Hoffenheim. Dutch coach Gertjan Verbeek then steered Nuremberg to a convincing 3-1 win at Hertha Berlin last Sunday and 15th in the table, but halting record-breaking Bayern's 44-match unbeaten league run is an altogether different proposition. ""We're at home, we have a run and we need the points. We'll give it all we have,"" said Nuremberg midfielder Mike Frantz. Swiss striker Josip Drmic has scored four goals in the last two matches and said while Bayern have swept aside all comers, ""we believe we can beat them"". A quick glance at the league table shows Bayern and Nuremberg are poles apart. As league leaders, Bayern are 31 points ahead of Nuremberg and while the Franconians have won just two of their 19 games so far, Pep Guardiola's Bayern have won all bar two of theirs, dropping just four points. ""We have reason to be happy,"" said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm. ""When you have a 13-point lead in the table, like we have, then we're the only ones who can trip ourselves up."" Bayern have an away quarter-final at Hamburg in the German Cup next Wednesday, then host Freiburg in the league before their Champions League last 16, first-leg away match at Arsenal on February 19. Having hammered Eintracht Frankfurt 5-0 at home last Saturday, Bayern will travel to Franconia in no mood to give away points, and anything less than a Munich win would be a shock result. ""The important big games are still to come,"" said winger Arjen Robben. ""We need to stay really relaxed and keep working."" In the pack chasing Bayern, Sami Hyypia's second-placed Bayer Leverkusen are at fifth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday, with the hosts looking for their first home win over the Werkself in 25 years. Successive defeats have seen Gladbach drop from third to fifth, but Leverkusen have also struggled with last Saturday's 2-1 win over Stuttgart breaking a three-match losing streak against opponents in the bottom-half of the table. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund travel to Werder Bremen looking to close the four-point gap behind Leverkusen. Dortmund were dealt some bad news on Wednesday when Germany defender Mats Hummels was ruled out for two weeks with strained ankle ligaments, having only just returned from a two-month break after injuring his heel on the same foot. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp expects to have Greek defender Sokratis available after his wife gave birth to their baby daughter on Wednesday. Klopp said new signing Milos Jojic is set to make his debut soon after the attacking midfielder has impressed in training. Struggling Bremen are 12th and looking for just their sixth league win of the season and their third at home. ""The fans in the stadium should see that we have given our all until the final whistle,"" said Austria midfielder Zlatko Junuzovic. ""We need to run until we puke."" At the other end of the table, there is an important basement battle as bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig are at 14th-placed Eintracht Frankfurt, who are just a point above the relegation play-off spot. Weekend's fixtures Friday (All kick-off times 1430 GMT unless stated) Borussia Moenchengladbach v Bayer Leverkusen (1930)"
207,05/02/2014,16:21,Football: Fresh blow for Dortmund as Hummels injures ankle,Borussia Dortmund have suffered a fresh blow with Germany defender Mats Hummels expected to miss the next fortnight with a new foot injury.,"The 25-year-old hurt his right foot in a friendly 4-3 win over second-division Fortuna Duesseldorf on Tuesday and Dortmund's team doctor Markus Braun has said he is expected to be out for two weeks. The centre-back only made his return in Friday's 2-1 win at Eintracht Braunschweig after two-months out after injuring his right heel against England in a friendly international. A scan on the ankle showed the November injury has fully healed, but the new ligament strain will need a fortnight's rest. With Dortmund third in the table, Hummels will miss Saturday's league match at home to Werder Bremen, plus two matches against Eintracht Frankfurt within four days, first in Tuesday's German Cup quarter-finals, then in the Bundesliga. Hummels' injury is more bad news for Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp with both centre-back Neven Subotic and winger Jakub Blaszczykowski out for the rest of the season with torn knee ligament injuries. The loss of Hummels means Klopp will again be down to his fourth-choice centre-back in either veteran Manuel Friedich or teenager Marian Sarr alongside Greek centre-back Sokratis. There was some good news for Klopp on Tuesday as attacking midfielder Jonas Hofmann scored twice and new-signing Milos Jojic made his debut in the win over Fortuna."

Spain's Thiago Alcantara set a new Bundesliga record with 185 ball contacts as Bayern's midfield dominated. ""They showed from the start who was the boss,"" enthused ex-Bayern president Franz Beckenbauer. ""At the break they could have been three of four-nil ahead."" Germany star Goetze put the hosts ahead when he chested down Mario Mandzukic's cross and slammed his shot inside the far post with only 12 minutes gone. France star Ribery then proved he has recovered from a leg injury when he added Bayern's second just before the break. Likewise, Robben came off the bench and fired home Goetze's final pass to put his leg injury behind him on 67 minutes before Dante headed Bayern's fourth two minutes later. Fittingly, Mandzukic, who was dropped ten days ago for poor training performances, netted their fifth on 89 minutes and was mobbed by his team-mates. ""He has reacted really well and today was a super performance,"" enthused Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer. This was Bayern's 17th win in 19 games and they have conceded just nine league goals. The European champions now face Freiburg, Hamburg and Nuremberg, who are all in the bottom four, before their Champions League last 16, first-leg match at Arsenal on February 19. Earlier, ten-man Nuremberg climbed out of the bottom three for the first time since October with only their second win of the season after Sunday's 3-1 victory at Hertha Berlin to climb to 15th. Nuremberg's Swiss striker Josip Drmic scored twice, including a penalty deep in added time to claim his second brace in as many weeks. There was drama on the stroke of 90 minutes when Nuremberg midfielder Ondrej Petrak was sent off for saving a shot with his hand. Despite furious protests from Hertha, referee Michael Weiner did not award the home team a penalty as Berlin's Ramos had fired from an offside position. On Saturday, second-placed Bayer Leverkusen broke their three-match losing streak with a 2-1 win at home to VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga. Swiss striker Eren Derdiyok headed home Leverkusen's winner six minutes from time. Stuttgart's Moritz Leitner had given the visitors an early lead before Bayer striker Stefan Kiessling equalised in the first half. Schalke 04 moved up to fourth with a 2-1 victory at home to ten-man VfL Wolfsburg with Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng firing home the winner nine minutes from time. The Royal Blues, who have lost just once in nine games, had taken an early lead after a scrappy goal was credited to Brazilian centre-back Felipe Santana as both he and Boateng lunged for the ball. Wolfsburg drew level despite being down to 10 men, after Daniel Caligiuri was sent off for insulting the referee five minutes into the second-half, when teenager Maximilian Arnold fired home on 65 minutes. But Boateng then fired home the winner for his sixth goal of the season to give Schalke their second straight win. Hanover 96's revival under new coach Tayfun Korkut continued as they earned a 3-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach with Senegal's Mame Diouf scoring twice. There was a strong South Korean influence in Mainz's 2-0 win at home to Freiburg as Park Joo-Ho and Koo Ja-Cheol netted to lift Mainz to seventh. Werder Bremen's poor form continues as they suffered a 3-1 defeat at Augsburg with the visitors finishing up with ten men. Hamburg's slump also as they were drubbed 3-0 at Hoffenheim, leaving Bert van Marwijk's side second from bottom as they suffered their fifth straight defeat. On Friday, third-placed Borussia Dortmund picked up their first win in five league games with a 2-1 victory at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig with Gabon winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scoring both goals."

The Bavarian giants face three league games in ten days as they tackle VfB Stuttgart on Wednesday in a postponed fixture, then host Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday February 2. The aim for the Bavarians now is to produce another eye-catching performance to dispirit the chasing pack. ""We must show the competition that there is nothing to pick up in terms of points,"" said Germany forward Thomas Mueller. ""We mustn't show any weak points and give rise to any hope. ""We can't go half-hearted into these games, the supposedly mighty FC Bayern won't be given any favours."" Bayern's thirst for titles is unsatiable at present having added the Club World Cup in December to August's UEFA Super Cup title after last season's treble of European, league and domestic cup titles. But Pep Guardiola's team were given a wake-up call in a friendly last Saturday when hosts Red Bull Salzburg inflicted a 3-0 defeat on Bayern, which set off a few ""alarm bells"", according to Mueller. ""We need to get out of holiday mode,"" said the 24-year-old as the Bundesliga returns after a four-week break. ""Gladbach will want to take something out of this. ""If an opponent is aggressive and doesn't crap their pants, then we can also have a few problems to deal with."" Gladbach usurped Borussia Dortmund from third place in the league with a strong finish to 2013. Borussia Park has uncomfortable memories for Bayern who lost 3-1 there in January 2012, having also gone to Gladbach as league leaders, and they had to fight back from 3-1 down in May before sealing a 4-3 win. ""It will be a hotly-contested game, if we aren't focused, there will be a result like there was in Salzburg,"" said Bayern's ex-Gladbach defender Dante. Dortmund, who are down to fourth place, need to break a three-match losing streak in the league at home when they host Augsburg on Saturday. Bayern, Leverkusen and Hertha Berlin all enjoyed wins at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion towards the end of the year and coach Jurgen Klopp's side enjoyed a 6-1 friendly drubbing of minnows Duisburg on Tuesday. Klopp will still be without the injured trio of midfielder Ilkay Gundogan (back), plus defenders Mats Hummels (ankle) and Neven Subotic (knee). Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen will also want to bounce back from their 1-0 defeat at Werder Bremen in December when they travel to face third-from-bottom Freiburg on Saturday."

His last appearance was in January 2013 and he was then dropped from the squad after a knee injury before being fined by the club last February over an incident at a carnival. Wiese failed to win back his place under coach Markus Gisdol and he has spent the last 12 months training apart from the first team. His contract was due to run until June 2016 and Hoffenheim are reported to have paid Wiese six million euros (US$8.1m) to terminate the deal. ""I will stay in Rauenberg (near Hoffenheim) because my daughter goes to the school there,"" Wiese, who made a reported 3.5 million euros per year, told German daily Bild. ""Whatever comes after that is up in the air, I won't give it much thought in the next few weeks. ""Things didn't go well, but I am enough of a sportsman to wish Hoffenheim all the best. ""I hope the team have a good second half of the season and what has gone before, we can now forget about."" Wiese has a wealth of Bundesliga experience having made 269 German league appearances, the majority of which came during a seven-year spell at Werder Bremen, who have struggled to replace him since he left."

""Kevin De Bruyne has today (Saturday) completed a move to Wolfsburg,"" Chelsea said in a statement. ""The Belgian joins the Bundesliga club having made five starts for Chelsea, with a further four appearances as a substitute."" Chelsea did not reveal the transfer fee, but reports in the German media have suggested that Wolfsburg were prepared to pay around 20 million euros (£16.5 million, $27.1 million) for the Belgium international. Chelsea only paid around £7 million to secure his services, but his stock rose in Germany after he scored 10 goals in 34 appearances during his loan spell at Bremen."

Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen face Werder Bremen away on Saturday with the hosts winless in their last five games. ""It won't be easy for us but we want to make a good impression in our last match before the winter break and take all three points,"" said Bayer coach Sami Hyypia. Leverkusen can set a new club record of 40 points for the first half of the season with a win at Bremen on what will be the final Bundesliga weekend of 2013. But Bayer slumped to a shock defeat at the hands of strugglers Eintracht Frankfurt last weekend and Bremen plan to follow suit. ""Bayer 04 have been in the leading pack for years but we've got a chance in front of our own fans,"" said Bremen midfielder Clemens Fritz. ""Frankfurt showed the way. Football is always capable of springing a surprise."" Werder coach Robin Dutt was so furious after his side's 3-2 defeat at Hertha Berlin last weekend that he sent the squad for a 4am gym session on their return to Bremen. Dutt is waiting on the fitness of captain Aaron Hunt as the veteran midfielder struggles with a calf injury. ""There is a big question mark against him, he would be a big loss,"" said Dutt. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund, who are 12 points behind Bayern and five adrift of Leverkusen, host Hertha Berlin looking for only their second league win in five games. Four points from those five matches has been a poor return and coach Jurgen Klopp is hoping to get some of his stars off the injured list to try to turn things around. Germany left-back Marcel Schmelzer could feature after a calf tear but it is still too early for defensive midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, who has at least trained with the squad this week. The 23-year-old has not played since injuring his back in Germany's friendly draw against Paraguay in August. And Klopp is also without both centre-backs Neven Subotic and Mats Hummels. Yet rather than looking forward to seeing the back of 2013, he remains eager to get their title challenge back on track. ""I'm not ready yet for Christmas,"" he said. ""We have had a great week of training and we could get down to some good work. The team are up for it."" Nuremberg host Schalke 04 on Saturday evening still looking for their first win of the season -- the only team in Europe's major leagues without a victory so far.

224,16/12/2013,10:54,Football: Record-breaking Bayern dominate in 2013,European champions Bayern Munich begin the quest for their first Club World Cup title on Tuesday having dominated German football in 2013 and finished the year unbeaten in the Bundesliga.,"The Bavarian giants' 3-1 win at home to Hamburg on Saturday means they finish with a new record 93 Bundesliga points for a calendar year and were unbeaten in the German league in 2013. The victory also extended the Champions League winners' unbeaten record in the Bundesliga to 41 games, dating back to October 2012. They launch their Club World Cup campaign in Morocco against China's Asian champions Guangzhou Evergrande FC in Tuesday's semi-finals for a place in Saturday's final. ""2013 has been an unbelievable year for FC Bayern, now we fly to Morocco and try to win our next title,"" said coach Pep Guardiola. Despite losing 3-2 at home to Manchester City last Tuesday, Bayern still finished top of their group to progress to the last 16 of the Champions League as they look to defend the title they won at Wembley in May. The Bavarians run to the 2013 final included a 7-0 drubbing of Barcelona on aggregate in the semi-finals as Bayern became the first German side to win the treble of European, league and cup titles under Jupp Heynckes. Under Heynckes, Bayern set 25 Bundesliga records including the most points (91) and fewest goals conceded (18 over the 34 matches) and show no sign on faltering under new boss Guardiola. Having returned from his year-long sabbatical in New York after winning 14 titles in four years at Barcelona, Guardiola took charge of Bayern in June. Midfielders Thiago Alcantara and Mario Goetze were added to their star-studded squad for this season as Guardiola has brought his own version of Barcelona's tiki-taka football to Bavaria. Bayern now enjoy around 75 percent possession in most league games and humbled Werder Bremen 7-0 in north Germany ten days ago. Guardiola picked up his first title with Bayern in August's UEFA Super Cup when Chelsea were beaten in Prague as the Spaniard enjoyed his eighth win in 16 matches against his rival Jose Mourinho, the former Real Madrid manager. The Bavarians extracted penalty shoot-out revenge after Chelsea had beaten them on spot-kicks to lift the 2012 Champions League title at Munich's Allianz Arena. With the holders through to the German Cup quarter-finals and having reached the Champions League's knock-out stage, Bayern are on course to defend all three titles they won last season. Guardiola has yet to have his full squad available with the likes of stars Javi Martinez, Thiago, Goetze, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben having all spent time on the sidelines recovering from injuries. Having beaten Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund 2-1 at Wembley in May's first all-German Champions League final, the Germans are again flying the flag in Europe with another first. After Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke joined Munich in qualifying for the knock-out phase, Germany will have four teams in the Champions League's knock-out stages for the first time in 2014. At international level, Germany have drawn Portugal, Ghana and the United States Group G at Brazil 2014 with the Germans amongst the favourites to claim their fourth World Cup title having finished third in at South Africa 2010. The Germans' attacking prowess is undeniable with the likes of Goezte alongside Arsenal's Mesut Ozil, Bayern's Thomas Mueller and Dortmund's Marco Reus. But their defence, traditionally Germany's strength, has repeatedly come under fire in 2013. A weakened Germany crashed to a 4-3 defeat to the USA, coached by ex-Germany boss Jurgen Klinsmann, in Washington in June, then fought back from 2-0 down for a 3-3 draw at home to lowly Paraguay in August. The Germans rounded up their Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign with a 5-3 win over Sweden in Stockholm to finish with nine wins from ten games, the 4-4 draw with Sweden in Berlin in October 2012 being the only blot."

Bayern bounced back on their return to league duty at the Allianz Arena with goals by Mario Mandzukic and Mario Goetze before Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri added the third deep into added time. Bayern surrendered their 10-match record Champions League winning run to City, but victory over Bert van Marwijk's Hamburg extended their record unbeaten run in the Bundesliga to 41 matches. Despite starting with France winger Franck Ribery and left-back David Alaba on the bench, while captain Philipp Lahm and star midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger are injured, Bayern still started with 10 internationals. Alaba's replacement Diego Contento was the only uncapped player in the Bayern side. Mandzukic put the Bavarians ahead with his tenth goal of the season with 42 minutes gone when he headed home Rafinha's superbly volleyed cross after a long ball from Toni Kroos. Goetze added the second when he hit the top left corner with 52 minutes on the clock before making way for Ribery. Hamburg striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga celebrated his 22nd birthday on Sunday with Hamburg's consolation goal on 87 minutes when he crashed his shot past Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Shaqiri came off the bench to add a third just before the final whistle to get Pep Guardiola's Bayern back to winning ways. Having needed a dramatic late goal to beat Marseille on Wednesday to confirm their Champions League progress, Dortmund had to fight back from two-goals down to draw 2-2 at Hoffenheim to hold onto third place. Striker Sven Schipplock and right-winger Kevin Volland gave Hoffenheim a shock 2-0 lead before Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gave Borussia hope when he hit his ninth goal of the season just before the break. Poland right-back Lukasz Piszczek scored his first goal of the season to equalise when stabbed home a rebound after a curling Nuri Sahin cross. The point was enough for Dortmund to hold onto third place as they sit level on 32 points with fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach, who were held to a goalless draw at Mainz 05. Nuremberg keep the tag of being the only team in a major European league without a win when they drew 3-3 at Hanover 96 as the hosts fought back with three goals in the final half an hour. Senegal striker Mame Diouf scored Hanover's dramatic equaliser in the dying stages, with more than a hint of offside, to leave Nuremberg furious and second from bottom in the table. Eintracht Braunschweig remained bolted to the bottom of the league when they went down 4-1 at Augsburg while on Friday, Werder Bremen crashed to a 3-2 defeat at Hertha Berlin, their fourth in five games."

Now Swiss champions Basel and Schalke meet in Gelsenkirchen with Group E's second qualifying berth on the line. Should Chelsea lose at Stamford Bridge against Steaua Bucharest, the winners in Gelsenkirchen will top the group. Third-placed Schalke must beat Basel to reach the last 16 and failure to reach the Champions League's knock-out phase -- which means prize money worth 3.5 million euros (US4.8m) -- could be the final nail in Keller's coffin. ""It's the most important game of the season for us, not just because it means a lot of money for the club,"" Schalke's Germany midfielder Julian Draxler told magazine Kicker. ""And all of us players want to present ourselves well on the big stage. ""That's why Basel is a very, very important game."" Draxler admitted the players need to produce a convincing performance to help keep Keller in office as their recent showings have only heightened calls for his dismissal. ""We have a responsibility to put our foot on the gas and win,"" said the 20-year-old. ""Anything else is up to the club's management."" Schalke's decision makers -- general manager Horst Heldt and Clemens Toennies, head of the advisory board -- have strongly hinted the axe will fall for Keller should Schalke fail to beat Basel. Potential successors have already been mentioned in the German media with ex-Werder Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf a possible contender to replace Keller, who took charge in December last year. The ex-Stuttgart boss still has supporters in the Schalke squad. ""We need to have some tunnel vision, there can be no distractions,"" said goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann. ""The coach gives us a plan and it's not his fault if we don't stick to it."" Having reached the knock-out phase of the Champions League for the first time two years ago, Basel are eager to repeat the feat and avenge their 1-0 defeat to Schalke in Switzerland at the start of October. The Swiss champions are second in the group and have already shown impressive form on the road this season in Europe. They pulled off a shock 2-1 win over Chelsea in London and are currently top of the Swiss Super League with just one defeat."
227,09/12/2013,15:27,Football: Bayern's Guardiola targets perfect six,Coach Pep Guardiola has demanded holders Bayern Munich finish the Champions League's group phase with the perfect record of six wins by seeing off Manchester City at home on Tuesday.,"Bayern are on a record run of 10 consecutive Champions League victories, but Guardiola wants to finish with 18 points -- something they failed to achieve last season under Jupp Heynckes, despite winning the title. Even with City and Bayern already into the knock-out phase, only a victory at Munich's Allianz Arena and guaranteed top spot in Group D will suffice for the Spaniard. ""We're not yet confirmed as first in the group, but we have the chance to finish with six wins,"" said Guardiola. ""We have a big chance to be first, which would be good for us in the knock-out phase, so that is what we have to aim for."" Guardiola said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm is set to return after a two- week absence following a hamstring injury, while Germany midfielder Mario Goetze should play despite suffering from a thigh knock. Having broken Barcelona's record for consecutive Champions League wins, Guardiola said he is only interested in seeing Bayern finish the group stage campaign with a perfect points haul. ""The records aren't important to me, they are important only for the history of the team, the club and the record books,"" he said. ""18 points for winning all the games means prestige and there is prize money at stake, that is what we must focus on."" Bayern swept aside City 3-1 at the Ethiad Stadium in October -- the only time Manuel Pellegrini's side has lost at home this season. The guests must win 3-0 at the Allianz Arena to wrestle top spot from the defending champions. Munich have won all 18 matches at home since their last defeat, to Arsenal in March, and as a Barcelona player and manager, Guardiola has yet to lose at home to an English side in nine encounters. Moreover, Pellegrini is still seeking his first win over Guardiola, who as Barcelona coach never lost against the Chilean's Villareal, Real Madrid and Malaga teams. Nevertheless, Guardiola will send his side out with victory as the only acceptable outcome. ""Tomorrow (Tuesday) is a dangerous game against dangerous opponents,"" insisted Guardiola. ""They have top players -- the likes of (David) Silva, (Alvaro) Negredo and (Sergio) Aguero who can score two or three goals in as many minutes. ""Last season, Bayern beat Arsenal 3-1 away, but they won 2-0 in Munich and we could have lost first place. ""I expect a very tight game, there won't be much space and we'll have to create chances."" Having won 14 titles in four years at Barcelona, Guardiola gave a glimpse of the perfectionism he demands of his players. Despite Saturday's 7-0 rout at Werder Bremen, which extended Bayern's record unbeaten run to 40 Bundesliga games, Guardiola still found faults. ""We lose the ball too often over 90 minutes. I can't stand losing possession,"" he said. ""A 7-0 win at Bremen is good for the confidence, but they had their chances in the first half. ""We have to keep improving and that's why we are here."""
228,09/12/2013,02:11,Football: City face uphill task to end Bayern's record run,Coach Manuel Pellegrini admits Manchester City face an uphill task to break Bayern Munich's record winning streak in the Champions League in Tuesday's battle for top spot in Group D.,"Bayern are on record runs in both the Bundesliga and Champions League and their 3-1 win at CSKA Moscow a fortnight ago was their tenth straight victory in Europe, breaking Barcelona's previous record. Bayern have turned the Allianz Arena into something of a fortress of late, winning all 18 home matches in all competitions since their last defeat in Munich last March at the hands of Arsenal. Both City and Bayern sides are through to the knock-out stages and all that remains to be settled is who will finish top of the group. The defending champions have won all of their five group games so far, including a dominant 3-1 win last October at City, who are three points behind the German side. Pellegrini's side would need to better that result at the Allianz Arena to knock Pep Guardiola's Munich from top spot. City have already pulled off a landmark achievement by reaching the Champions League's knock-out stages, at the third attempt, with a 4-2 home win over Czech outfit Viktoria Pilsen at home a fortnight ago. ""We have qualified for the next round and this is very good,"" said Pellegrini. ""It would be better to be first in the group, but we have already played against a very strong Bayern Munich team. ""They played better than us (in Manchester) and it will be very difficult to beat them 3-0 at their ground. ""But we will try to do a very good match and we will try to win."" Despite beating CSKA Moscow and Pilsen on the road in Europe this season, City's away record in the Premier League is poor with only two wins in eight away games, including Saturday's 1-1 draw at Southampton. Pellegrini is hoping to have Spanish playmaker David Silva back from injury. The Spanish attacking midfielder has missed City's last five matches due to a calf injury. Germany captain Philipp Lahm could return for Bayern having missed the last few weeks with a hamstring injury, but Bayern are definitely without winger Arjen Robben. The Dutchman is recovering from a deep thigh cut, but the European champions showed no signs of missing Robben, who had scored in each of his four matches before injury struck, when they romped to a 7-0 win at Werder Bremen on Saturday. It was the Bavarian giants' 40th unbeaten Bundesliga match since losing to Bayer Leverkusen in October 2012 and Guardiola said he was 'honoured' by his team's performance. France's Franck Ribery showed he is back at his best after a rib injury with two goals and two assists in an outstanding display. Despite becoming the first German team to win the treble of European, league and cup titles under Jupp Heynckes last season, his successor Guardiola is ensuring Bayern maintain their high standards. ""The coach never lets up,"" said centre-back Jerome Boateng. ""We were focused from the start (in Bremen) and we never let up, results like that happen when you play at such a frenzy."" Bayern face more international competition after the City game as they travel to Morocco to play in the Club World Cup and will want to finish their Champions League group campaign on a high. ""The team is happy, we have a great mentality, but we have to keep playing at that level,"" said Ribery with an eye on the City clash."
229,09/12/2013,02:05,Football: Now-or-never for Champions League last-16 hopefuls,"Holders Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Barcelona are already through to the Champions League round of 16.","Eight other places are up for grabs when the groups end on Tuesday and Wednesday. AFP Sports looks at what's at stake on Tuesday: Group A Manchester United (ENG) v Shakhtar Donetsk (UKR) Smarting from their fifth Premier League defeat of the season, already qualified Manchester United host Shakhtar seeking some much needed European solace. United's second successive home defeat, a 1-0 reverse to Newcastle on Saturday, has taken much of the gloss off their superb 5-0 rout of Borussia Dortmund a fortnight ago, a demolition which sealed their passage to the knockout stages. David Moyes will want a quick and sharp response from his team which he said had lacked sparkle against Newcastle, a loss which left the Premier League titleholders 13 points off leaders Arsenal. A draw is essential to take Group A honours and give United a much needed boost ahead of the crammed Christmas domestic programme. Shakhtar, in buoyant form at home -- they lead their league by five points -- must match Bayer Leverkusen's result to qualify. Victory for the Ukrainians would deprive Moyes' men of top spot. United are boosted by the return of Wayne Rooney, suspended for Saturday's game. Real Sociedad (ESP) v Bayer Leverkusen (GER) Leverkusen will qualify for the last 16 at the expense of Shakhtar as long as they see off winless Real and the Ukrainians lose at Old Trafford. A draw will be enough for Leverkusen if Shakhtar lose thanks to their superior head-to-head. Leverkusen have painful memories of their last trip to Spain, a 7-1 drubbing at Barcelona in the 2011/2012 round of 16 -- their heaviest ever European defeat. Bayer go into the tie on the back of a hard fought 1-0 win over Borussia Dortmund to leave them four points shy of Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich. Group B Galatasaray (TUR) v Juventus (ITA) A draw would be enough to see Juventus through to the knock-out stages, given their better head-to-head record against Copenhagen than Galatasaray's, but even a draw is a tall order in the Istanbul cauldron the Turks call home. It is made even more so by the fact that the Turin club were dealt a severe blow with the news that influential playmaker Andrea Pirlo will miss what is their most important test of the season so far with knee ligament damage, which is expected to sideline him until the New Year -- by which time Juve's Champions League campaign could be a fading memory. FC Copenhagen (DEN)v Real Madrid (ESP) Copenhagen have only pride left to play for as even an unlikely victory over Real would leave them in third place in the group and out of the competition. Real, on the other hand, have cruised through their campaign so far, scoring at will, most recently with the 4-1 drubbing of Galatasaray which, ironically, rekindled rivals Juventus' hopes of progressing. Despite being already qualified, coach Carlo Ancelotti is expected to line out with stars Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo. Group C Benfica (POR) v Paris Saint Germain (FRA) The hosts have more to play for than the visitors, who are already assured of being group winners. Benfica, though, must better the result of Greek side Olympiakos if they are to reach the last-16. Benfica do have a bit of a hold over the French visitors in that they have beaten them in Lisbon on the last two occasions they have played there. Much could depend on what sort of side PSG coach Laurent Blanc selects, whether he opts to rest several first team regulars or throws them all in as they seek to better their overall points haul of 15 -- they presently have 13 -- from last year's group stage. Lisbon is hosting the Champions League final but it is unlikely that Benfica will emulate Bayern Munich in appearing in a final on home turf given their qualification is out of their hands. Olympiakos (GRE) v Anderlecht (BEL) The Greek side should logically seal their place in the knockout stages at home to a Belgian outfit which has garnered just one point from their five games -- albeit a draw with PSG -- and whom the hosts trounced 3-0 in Belgium with Kostas Mitroglou scoring a hat-trick. Coached by former Spanish great Michel, who was part of the Real Madrid team that overturned a 3-0 deficit in a UEFA Cup second round clash in the 1984/85 campaign to win 6-1 in the return leg, Olympiakos are bidding to reach the Last 16 for the first time since 2009/10. Anderlecht will finish bottom of their group for the seventh successive season they have competed in the competition. Group D Bayern Munich (GER) v Manchester City (ENG) Defending champions Bayern, buoyed by a 7-0 demolition of Werder Bremen on Saturday which extended their unbeaten Bundesliga run to 40 matches, are already through to the last-16. They will win the group with a draw or with a defeat that is no bigger than their 3-1 away victory in Manchester in the teams' first game. Bayern have won 14 of their last 16 home Champions League fixtures, most recently a 5-0 success against Victoria Pilsen on matchday three while their 3-1 win at CSKA Moscow a fortnight ago broke Barcelona's record for consecutive wins with their tenth straight victory. City coach Manuel Pellegrini is hoping to have Spanish playmaker David Silva back from injury. The Spanish attacking midfielder has missed City's last five matches due to a calf injury. Germany captain Philipp Lahm could return for Bayern having missed the last few weeks with a hamstring injury, but Bayern are definitely without winger Arjen Robben who has a thigh problem. Viktoria Pilsen (CZE) v CSKA Moscow (RUS) Neither side can make the last-16, leaving a battle to finish third and claim a spot in the Europa League knockout rounds. The Russians will come third with a draw or with a defeat that is not greater than their 3-2 home success against Viktoria. Pilsen have lost both home games so far in Group D without scoring a goal but had won ten of their preceding 11 home fixtures in UEFA competition, including three in a row in this season's qualifying rounds. Before losing at Bayern (3-0) and City (5-2), CSKA were on a run of just two losses in 11 away outings in UEFA competition."

Freiburg squandered a couple of clear chances before Wolfsburg's Germany defender Marcel Schafer came off the bench for Olic to score their third in added time. Freiburg remain third from bottom with a third straight defeat and to make matters worse they had French midfielder Francis Coquelin, on loan from Arsenal, carried off with a suspected broken ankle just after the break. Hertha Berlin stayed seventh and kept hosts Eintracht Braunschweig rooted to the bottom of the table with a 2-0 away win. Colombia striker Adrian Ramos headed Berlin into a first-half lead before 20-year-old midfielder Tolga Cigerci added a late second with his first for the club. On Saturday, France star Franck Ribery produced a commanding display as Bayern Munich extended their record unbeaten Bundesliga run to 40 matches with a 7-0 away romp at Werder Bremen. Ribery boosted his claim for the 2013 world footballer of the year award, which will be announced on January 13, by creating two goals and scoring twice in the rout. Bayern, who last lost in the German league in October 2012, produced their biggest win so far under Pep Guardiola, cutting Bremen's defence to tatters. The victory was short of the Bundesliga's 57-year-old record of 9-0 for an away win and was Werder's heaviest home league defeat. Bremen coach Robin Dutt kept the team on the pitch for a stern lecture as they dropped to 14th after just two wins in their last 10 games. Belgium's Daniel van Buyten, Croatia's Mario Mandzukic plus Germany's Thomas Mueller and Mario Goetze also joined Ribery on the scoresheet after Bremen scored an own goal. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen stayed four points behind Bayern with a hard-fought 1-0 win at third-placed Borussia Dortmund, who now find themselves six points behind Leverusen and ten points behind Munich. South Korea striker Son Heung-Min hit the 18th-minute winner after Leverkusen's attack pounced on a mistake by Dortmund defender Manuel Friedrich for Son to score his fifth goal in his last three games against Borussia. Both sides finished with 10 men in a tense affair. Dortmund lost both defensive midfielders Sven Bender and Nuri Sahin during the match with ankle injuries. Germany's Bender has been ruled out of Wednesday's Champions League game at Marseille with a sprained ankle, while Sahin has a torn ligament and is rated extremely doubtful. ""Miracles happen repeatedly, but it does not look good,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. Fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach drew level on 31 points with Dortmund as they picked up their sixth-straight win with a 2-1 win at home to ten-man Schalke 04. Schalke must beat Swiss champions FC Basel on Wednesday to reach the Champions League's knock-out phase and another defeat could be coach Jens Keller's last having only been in charge since December last year. Eintracht Frankfurt stayed just above the relegation places after losing 2-1 at home to Hoffenheim while Hamburg, who had been steadily climbing the table under ex-Holland manager Bert van Marwijk, slumped to a 1-0 defeat at home to Augsburg. Stuttgart are up to 10th after picking up only their third win in the last 10 games with a 4-2 win at home to Hanover 96."

Stuttgart are up to 10th after picking up only their third win in the last 10 games with a 4-2 win at home to Hanover 96."
236,06/12/2013,18:29,Football: Dortmund out to reclaim second spot from Leverkusen,"Despite the festive season, Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has said his side must not give away any more points when they host Bayer Leverkusen in Saturday's key Bundesliga clash.","Third-placed Dortmund take on second-placed Leverkusen at Borussia's Westfalenstadion with both teams battling to stay in touch with European champions Bayern Munich, who are four points clear of Leverkusen and seven ahead of Dortmund. Dortmund slipped to third last month when they suffered back-to-back league defeats at Wolfsburg and at home to Bayern, having lost their entire back four to injury, but this is their chance to reclaim second. ""There are three league games left this year, we have nothing more to give away and we all want to win,"" said Klopp. ""We have 31 points, which isn't bad, nevertheless we have lost points along the way and that has hurt us."" Should Dortmund win and Bayern win or draw at Werder Bremen, to extend their unbeaten Bundesliga run to a record 40 matches, the Bavarians would open a seven-point gap at the top. Leverkusen, coached by ex-Liverpool defender Sami Hyypia, were thrashed 5-0 at home by Manchester United in the Champions League ten days ago and are eager to restore battered confidence against Borussia Dortmund. ""They have the chance to make amends against us, but we are at home and we have ambitions of reaching a high position in the table,"" said Klopp. ""A win against Leverkusen is always something special."" Hyypia was guarded about his side's chances at Westfalenstadion. ""It is always hard to take something from Dortmund,"" said the ex-Finland star. ""Borussia have shown, over several years, that they are a top team. ""They are simply better and we should be pleased that we are currently in front of them in the table."" Dortmund's main injury concern is Germany midfielder Marco Reus, who is nursing a calf injury."
237,06/12/2013,02:35,Football: Bayern eye 40th match unbeaten milestone,Bayern Munich can reach the milestone of 40 league games unbeaten by extending their Bundesliga record at Werder Bremen on Saturday but they will be without winger Arjen Robben who is out for six weeks.,"A knee injury means the Dutch winger will miss the Bremen trip, Tuesday's final Champions League group match at home to Manchester City plus the Club World Cup in Morocco. Bayern already have injury concerns with captain Philipp Lahm and star midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger both out, but France winger Franck Ribery should be back in Bremen after a rib injury. Robben was left with a cut to the bone on his right knee having been stretchered off after scoring in Wednesday's 2-0 German Cup win at Augsburg which put Bayern in the quarter-finals. After scoring in each of his last four games for Bayern, Robben's injury is a blow, but Pep Guardiola's side show no signs of slowing down in their quest for more silverware. The European champions last lost in the Bundesliga in October 2012 and are already in the last 16 of the Champions League, have booked their quarter-final berth in the German Cup on Wednesday and are four points clear in the league. But the Bavarians are refusing to rest on their laurels with director of sport Matthias Sammer inisting there is plenty more to come. ""We have only been German champions once in the last three years,"" said Sammer. ""There is this stupid debate about how dominant we are, which is superficial and implies we should win games like this, just by turning up."" But Bayern are certainly able to see off most of their Bundesliga rivals without too much effort, as they proved in last Saturday's 2-0 lacklustre win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Bayern are used to around 75 percent possession in league games and Werder coach Robin Dutt said there is no secret to beating the Bavarians. ""The first trick is to run, the second is to run some more and the third is to keep running,"" he quipped. Having dropped to third after losing back-to-back league matches, Dortmund can regain second place by beating Bayer Leverkusen at home in Saturday's key game. The hosts are waiting on the fitness of midfielders Sven Bender, who broke his nose against Napoli, and Nuri Sahin, who has a leg injury. Germany winger Marco Reus, who has a bruised calf, is improving, with a decision to be made after the final training session. ""There will be no excuses on Saturday,"" said Klopp, whose side will also need to win at Marseille on Wednesday to reach the last 16 of the Champions League. ""This is a difficult game for both teams. ""We have now got used to having a few players missing and we have adjusted well."" Schalke are at fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday with coach Jens Keller needing a win having been told his job is only guaranteed until Christmas. Schalke were dumped out of the German Cup with a 3-1 defeat at home to Hoffenheim and must beat Swiss champions FC Basel at home on Wednesday to go through to the last 16 of the Champions League. ""We will be making every effort of be successful and we will see how the situation is after the Nuremberg game (on December 21),"" said Schalke's general manager Horst Heldt.

But Bert van Marwijk's Hamburg brushed off the loss of their skipper to claim their first home win in six attempts. ""It was a hard-fought victory for us with both teams under pressure. Hanover are going through a difficult time while we needed to finally win at home,"" said Van Marwijk. ""We haven't improved much, but we are better organised and we gave fewer balls away."" Hanover's Hungary midfielder Szabolcs Huszti put his side ahead when he hit the top left corner from 16 metres with 28 minutes gone. But the hosts responded with Croatia's Milan Badelj equalising three minutes later before right-wing Maximilian Beister slipped his marker just a minute into the second-half to head home. Beister then turned provider as he found 19-year-old Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu in space and the attacking midfielder fired home for the third six minutes from time. Hanover's Senegal defender Salif Sane was sent off in the dying stages for a second yellow card to compound the guests' misery. It was Hanover's eighth match without a win, their sixth straight away defeat, and saw Mirko Slomka's side drop to 13th in the league. Werder Bremen slumped to 12th and their third defeat in four games, as they went down 3-2, despite a late fight back, at home to seventh-placed Mainz 05, for whom Japan's Shinji Okazaki scored twice. On Saturday, Bayern Munich's Germany star Mario Goetze came off the bench to score the opening goal in the European champions' comprehensive 3-0 win at his ex-club Borussia Dortmund. Goetze, who joined Bayern for 37 million euros (US$50m) in July after 12 years at Dortmund, gave the perfect reply to the chorus of boos he received on his return to Borussia's Westfalenstadion. The 21-year-old smashed home a Thomas Mueller pass on 66 minutes, before the floodgates opened and Arjen Robben and Mueller added late goals in the final five minutes. Bayern capped a commanding performance by beating Dortmund for the first time in seven Bundesliga attempts, dating back to February 2010. It was Munich's first win in Dortmund since September 2009. ""We're happy, we won against the best counter-attacking team in the world,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. Again, Munich ran out winners in a replay of May's Champions League final as Dortmund had been forced to patch together their entire back four after a spate of injuries. But there can be no excuses as Bayern extended their record unbeaten run in the Bundesliga to 38 matches and opened a seven-point lead over Dortmund, who drop to third. Bayer Leverkusen warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Manchester United by going second with a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin. The win came at a cost as Germany winger Sidney Sam was ruled out of the United clash after tearing a thigh muscle four minutes into the game. Sixth-placed Schalke, who are away to Steaua Bucharest in the Champions League on Tuesday and are second in Group E behind Chelsea, drew 3-3 at Eintracht Frankfurt. They raced into a 2-0 lead after only 18 minutes but leaked three goals in 12 disastrous second-half minutes. Germany defender Benedikt Hoewedes saved Schalke's blushes when he hit the top-right hand corner to equalise with just four minutes left. Wolfsburg's four-match winning streak, which has seen them climb to fifth in the league, was ended when they were held to a 1-1 draw at second-from-bottom Nuremberg. Freiburg stay in the relegation places despite their 1-0 win at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, while Augsburg are up to tenth after their 2-0 win at Hoffenheim. On Friday, Borussia Moenchengladbach stayed fourth with a 2-0 win at VfB Stuttgart, their fourth straight win, with goals by Brazil's Raffael and Sweden's Oscar Wendt."
247,21/11/2013,10:44,Football: Dortmund sign Friedrich to ease injury list,Borussia Dortmund have reacted to their long list of injuries ahead of Saturday's Bundesliga showdown with Bayern Munich by signing ex-Germany defender Manuel Friedrich until the end of the season.,"Second-placed Dortmund host Bundesliga leaders Bayern with Pep Guardiola's European champions four-points clear at the top. Borussia were dealt a double injury blow on Wednesday when scans revealed both centre-back Mats Hummels and left-back Marcel Schmelzer returned with injuries from international duty with Germany. Torn ankle ligaments will keep Hummels out until mid January, while a torn calf muscle means a three-week lay-off for Schmelzer. With centre-back Neven Subotic out for six months with torn ligaments and right-back Lukasz Piszczek only just back in training from surgery, Dortmund will face the league leaders without their entire first-choice back four. Having been released by Bayer Leverkusen at the end of last season, centre-back Friedrich, 34, was previously without a club and made the last of his nine appearances for Germany in February 2008. ""We have reacted to the injuries in our defence. Manuel Friedrich has extensive experience and has made a good impression in training,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc with Friedrich having signed a contract until June 2014. Friedrich is set to partner Greece international Sokratis Papastathopoulos at centre-back against Bayern and has also played for Werder Bremen and Mainz in his Bundesliga career, making 247 league appearances and scoring 15 goals. ""I am thrilled to be allowed to run out in the Borussia Dortmund jersey,"" said Friedrich, who had been training with third division Rot-Weiss Oberhausen to stay fit.

The result leaves Frankfurt 15th in the league, just above the relegation places after their fourth straight defeat. Later VfB Stuttgart moved up to eighth after picking up their first win in five games with a 3-1 win at Freiburg, who stay in the bottom three. Stuttgart raced into a 2-0 lead with striker Vedad Ibisevic firing home after nine minutes before 17-year-old forward Timo Werner added a second a minute later. Germany striker Mike Hanke pulled a goal back for Freiburg 12 minutes from time before Werner, a Germany Under-19 international, added his second with a superb finish following a strong run. On Saturday, European champions Bayern Munich set a new record for the longest unbeaten run in Bundesliga history with a 3-0 victory at home to Augsburg. Bayern have now gone 37 league matches since their last defeat, at Bayer Leverkusen in October 2012, breaking Hamburg's previous record of 36 from January, 1983.

Bayern, who have won 31 of their last 37 Bundesliga matches, were without Germany's Bastian Schweinsteiger, who will miss the forthcoming internationals against Italy and England with an ankle injury. It was Bayern's second milestone of the week after they equalled Barcelona's record from the 2002/03 season of nine consecutive Champions League wins with a 1-0 midweek success at Viktoria Pilsen. Breaking records is nothing remarkable for Bayern these days having set or equalled 25 league markers under Guardiola's predecessor Jupp Heynckes last season. Bayern also extended their lead at the top of the table to four points as second-placed Dortmund went down 2-1 at VfL Wolfsburg. It was Dortmund's second defeat of the week after losing 1-0 at home to Arsenal in the Champions League.

Hamburg captain Rafael van der Vaart earned his side a point when he equalised for the third time for the hosts on 67 minutes on Van Marwijk's home debut. Stuttgart spent the last six minutes with 10 men after Germany Under-21 centre-back Antonio Ruediger was shown a straight red for hitting Dutch midfielder Van der Vaart in the ribs. ""We have improved again and are playing football the way I like it,"" said Van Marwijk as Hamburg rallied at 3-2 down after ex-Arsenal defender Johan Djourou conceded a second-half own goal. ""We had a couple of really nice attacks, which pleased me. We had a bit of bad luck with the own goal."" After a draw at Frankfurt and a 5-0 hammering of Nuremberg, the point kept Hamburg 15th, having been in the bottom three when Van Marwijk took over, while Stuttgart are eighth. Wolfsburg moved up to ninth with a 2-1 win at Augsburg with Wolves ex-Bayern Munich midfielder Luiz Gustavo heading the first-half winner. On Saturday, European champions Bayern extended their unbeaten Bundesliga run to 34 games by coming from behind for a 4-1 home win over Mainz to go back to the top. Having last lost in the German league back in October 2012, Bayern are now just two matches short of equalling Hamburg's 30-year-old, 36-match streak. Bayern were punished for a poor first-half in Munich when Mainz striker Shawn Parker fired home after capitalising on a mistake by centre-back Jerome Boateng. But Bayern roared back when Germany midfielder Mario Goetze came off the bench for the second-half and played a key part in the hosts' first three second-half goals. His dream pass through to Arjen Robben allowed the winger to equalise on 50 minutes and two minutes later, Goetze combined with the Dutchman for Germany's Thomas Mueller to fire home to make it 2-1. With Bayern finally making their 80 percent possession pay off, Goetze fired in a cross for Mario Mandzukic to score their third on 69 minutes. And when Bayern vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was fouled in the area, Mueller stepped up to drill home the penalty for his second of the game eight minutes from time. Bayer Leverkusen had briefly gone top on Friday thanks to a controversial 'phantom' goal in their 2-1 win at Hoffenheim. The German Football Federation (DFB) will investigate on Monday while Hoffenheim have called for a replay after Stefan Kiessling's 70th-minute winner came in bizarre circumstances. Replays showed his header only ended in the back of the net after flying through a hole in the side netting. Schalke 04, who host Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday, needed a 91st-minute winner from Roman Neustaedter to seal a 3-2 win at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Dortmund, who are at Arsenal on Tuesday in the Champions League, stayed second with a hard-fought 1-0 win at home to Hanover 96. Germany winger Marco Reus hit the winning penalty after just four minutes when Hanover's Japan defender Hiroki Sakai fouled left-back Erik Durm in the area.

260,20/10/2013,18:46,Football: Hamburg hold Stuttgart in six-goal thriller,Hamburg remain unbeaten in three league games under coach Bert van Marwijk after picking up a point in their thrilling 3-3 draw with 10-man VfB Stuttgart on Sunday.,"Ex-Holland coach Van Marwijk took charge in September after predecessor Thorsten Fink was fired following a disastrous start to the season, including a 6-2 drubbing at Borussia Dortmund. Hamburg captain Rafael van der Vaart earned his side a point when he equalised for the third time for the hosts on 67 minutes. Stuttgart spent the last six minutes with 10 men after centre-back Antonio Ruediger was shown a straight red for hitting Dutch midfielder Van der Vaart in the ribs. ""We have improved again and are playing football the way I like it,"" said Van Marwijk as Hamburg rallied at 3-2 down after ex-Arsenal defender Johan Djourou conceded a second-half own goal. ""We had a couple of really nice attacks, which pleased me. We had a bit of bad luck with the own goal."" After a draw at Frankfurt and a 5-0 hammering of Nuremberg, the point lifts Hamburg up to 14th, having been in the bottom three when Van Marwijk took over, while Stuttgart are eighth. On Saturday, Bayern Munich extended their unbeaten Bundesliga run to 34 games by coming from behind for a 4-1 home win over Mainz to go back to the top. Having last lost in the German league back in October 2012, Bayern are now just two matches short of equalling Hamburg's 30-year-old, 36-match streak. Bayern were punished for a poor first-half in Munich when Mainz striker Shawn Parker fired home after capitalising on a mistake by centre-back Jerome Boateng. But Bayern roared back when Germany midfielder Mario Goetze came off the bench for the second-half and played a key part in the hosts' first three second-half goals. His dream pass through to Arjen Robben allowed the winger to equalise on 50 minutes and two minutes later, Goetze combined with the Dutchman for Germany's Thomas Mueller to fire home to make it 2-1. With Bayern finally making their 80 percent possession pay off, Goetze fired in a cross for Mario Mandzukic to score their third on 69 minutes. And when Bayern vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was fouled in the area, Mueller stepped up to drill home the penalty for his second of the game eight minutes from time. Bayer Leverkusen had briefly gone top on Friday thanks to a controversial 'phantom' goal in their 2-1 win at Hoffenheim. The German Football Federation (DFB) will investigate on Monday while Hoffenheim have called for a replay after Stefan Kiessling's 70th-minute winner came in bizarre circumstances. Replays showed his header only ended in the back of the net after flying through a hole in the side netting. Schalke 04, who host Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday, needed a 91st-minute winner from Roman Neustaedter to seal a 3-2 win at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Dortmund, who are at Arsenal on Tuesday in the Champions League, stayed second with a hard-fought 1-0 win at home to Hanover 96. Germany winger Marco Reus hit the winning penalty after just four minutes when Hanover's Japan defender Hiroki Sakai fouled left-back Erik Durm in the area. Borussia stay second and level on 22 points with third-placed Leverkusen, just a point behind Bayern. Second-from-bottom Freiburg picked up a point with a goalless draw at Werder Bremen, while Eintracht Frankfurt drew 1-1 at home to Nuremberg. Later Sunday, Augsburg are home to Wolfsburg."

""It's great to get the hat-trick, but it's more important that things went so well for the team,"" said Lasogga, who claimed the fastest away hat-trick in Bundesliga history. This was only the second game for Van Marwijk, 61, who coached Holland to the 2010 World Cup final. He replaced Thorsten Fink last month after a disastrous start left Hamburg in the relegation places. The Dutchman has promised to tighten Hamburg's defence, but it was their attack which ran riot at Nuremberg. ""I like attacking football, although tactical discipline belongs to that and we still lose the ball too often, but it's getting better,"" said Van Marwijk, whose reign opened with a draw at Frankfurt last week. ""A 5-0 win doesn't happen every week, but it's important to help the self-confidence come back."" Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart opened the scoring with a superb scissor-kick volley on 17 minutes.

In a high-tempo clash at Leverkusen's BayArena, Germany midfielder Sidney Sam's 31st-minute equaliser for the hosts cancelled out Toni Kroos' opening goal for Bayern. Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno guaranteed a point for his side by denying Franck Ribery twice in as many second-half minutes, then Mario Goetze, while Thomas Mueller had a penalty appeal turned down. But Guardiola was a picture of frustration, brooding on the Bayern bench and drumming his fingers as Bayern enjoyed 27 shots on goal and 78 percent possession, but managed just a single goal. The point was enough to send Bayern top, with Leverkusen third, behind Borussia Dortmund. Fresh from their impressive 3-0 Champions League win over Marseille, Dortmund were set to claim an away point until a disastrous final 10-minute spell, triggered by Mats Hummels' red card. The Germany defender was sent off on 81 minutes after a reckless challenge on 'Gladbach's Norway midfielder Havard Nordtveit in the area. Germany striker Max Kruse netted the resulting penalty, then Brazilian forward Raffael hit their second four minutes from time to see 'Gladbach move up to fourth. Schalke 04 came from behind to claim a 4-1 win over 10-man Augsburg in Gelsenkirchen to move up to eighth. VfB Stuttgart dropped to seventh after their 1-1 draw at home to Werder Bremen while Hoffenheim stayed 10th with a 2-2 draw at Mainz. Eintracht Braunschweig, who have been bottom of the table since last season's promotion, picked up their first win of the season with a shock 2-0 victory at VfL Wolfsburg -- their first Bundesliga victory since 1985.

Since his arrival from AC Milan last month, Kevin-Prince Boateng has helped lift Schalke up to ninth with the Ghana international adding some steel to their attacking midfield. The 26-year-old scored the winner at Mainz last Saturday in a 1-0 victory and hit the second goal in Wednesday's 3-0 Champions League victory over Steaua Bucharest. European champions Bayern will provide an acid test of Schalke's winning streak, but there promises to be fireworks when the Boateng brothers clash. ""He is my brother, but there will be no love lost in the game,"" said Berlin-born Kevin-Prince Boateng. ""I have already told him I would be disappointed if he didn't go at me 100 percent during the game. I will be doing the same."" Bayern have dropped just two points from their first five Bundesliga games and opened the defence of their Champions League title on Tuesday with a 3-0 win at home to CSKA Moscow. Jerome Boateng, 25, has said he will be hoping to leave Gelsenkirchen with three more league points and will not take a backward step against his sibling. ""I'll try and do that without bringing him down, but if there is no other way, I'll do it,"" said the Bayern star. ""He won't run away from me."" Bayern travel to north-west Germany from Bavaria as clear favourites, but Kevin-Prince is defiant. ""For the game in Schalke, anything is possible."" The last time the brothers played each other was the 2010 World Cup group stage match when Germany beat Ghana 1-0 in Johannesburg. ""It's a big thing for us that we can play against each other at such a high level,"" said Kevin-Prince. Bayern will still be without several stars at Schalke. Spain midfielder Javi Martinez missed training on Thursday and Friday for a dental operation, while Germany midfielder Mario Goetze is training after an ankle injury. Both will miss the Schalke game, although vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger should feature having come on in the win over Moscow. Schalke are still without Holland striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who is recovering from a knee injury, with Hungary striker Adam Szalai deputising. League leaders Dortmund head to Nuremberg looking to preserve their 100 percent record, and earn their sixth victory in the process, but centre-back Mats Hummels is rated highly doubtful. The 24-year-old came off with a back injury in the 2-1 defeat at Napoli in Wednesday's Champions League defeat. ""I don't think it'll be ready in time,"" admitted Hummels.

286,16/09/2013,17:44,Football: Hamburg's Fink under fire after Dortmund drubbing,Hamburg coach Thorsten Fink's job is on the line after his chairman lambasted the faltering team's defence on Monday.,"Hamburg were drubbed 6-2 at Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund on Saturday, leading to chairman Carl Edgar Jarchow's astonishing public rebuke of his coach. Jarchow said he expects to see an improvement quickly, or else he and the board may be tempted to act. ""I take the long-term view, but on the board we expect things to be implemented,"" Jarchow told SID, an AFP subsidiary, on Monday. ""In Dortmund, it was a repeat of the debacle against Hoffenheim -- defence is our weak point and these mistakes must be eliminated. ""That is his (Fink's) job."" Hamburg are 15th -- just above the relegation zone -- after five games, but more worryingly they have conceded 15 goals -- 11 of which came in just two games. Having been hammered 5-1 at home by Hoffenheim in mid-August, Fink's defence again collapsed against Dortmund, despite recovering from 2-0 down to equalise just after half-time. With Dortmund's Poland striker Robert Lewandowski and Germany winger Marco Reus, plus new signings Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang running riot, Hamburg's defence leaked four goals in 16 minutes during a second-half horror show. ""We were naive and lost almost every one-on-one,"" fumed Fink after Dortmund peppered the Hamburg goal with more than a dozen shots on target. Hamburg also capitulated 9-2 at Bayern Munich last March and the Hamburg board are running out of patience with Fink, who took charge in October 2011. After the Hoffenheim defeat, Fink gave his players two days off, then threw left-back Dennis Aogo out of the squad before he was sold to Schalke 04, while centre-backs Slobodan Rajkovic and Michael Mancienne were told they have no future at the club. The 4-0 drubbing of Eintracht Braunschweig last month failed to mask Hamburg's defensive frailties and Fink now faces a make-or-break clash against north German neighbours Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga on Saturday. Jarchow left no doubt that defeat in that game could spell the end for Fink. ""One thing is for sure, that is a very important game for everyone,"" said Jarchow. Bremen are just one place above Hamburg in the league and suffered their third consecutive defeat when they went down 3-0 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. ""Everything depends on this game,"" insisted club captain Rafael van der Vaart."

Striker Anthony Modeste gave Hoffenheim the lead just before the break, then provided a superb through ball for Volland to pounce on, turn the defence and hit the bottom right-hand corner. ""It was a great pass from Anthony, things are going well for me, I worked hard in pre-season which gave me confidence,"" said the Germany Under-21 skipper.

""We need to talk about things in the next few days and weeks,"" Hopp has told magazine Sport Bild, but Wiese has said he has no interest in dissolving his Hoffenheim contract. Since being fined by the club in February for an incident at a party to celebrate carnival, Wiese has been exiled from the first team and trains with a separate group. His former club Bremen have said they have no interest in re-signing Wiese, who was part of the Germany squad which finished third at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. ""A discussion about goalkeepers is not up for debate,"" said Bremen's director of sport Thomas Eichin. Having signed for Hoffenheim in May 2012 after nearly 200 Bundesliga appearances for Werder, Wiese has said there is no end in sight to his first-team exile. ""I have no interest in dissolving my contract,"" the 31-year-old said over the weekend. ""I didn't sign a four-year deal to dissolve it after just one. ""No one has spoken to me about it and I haven't had contact with the coach or manager for two months.""

295,05/09/2013,02:25,Football: Germany's Loew focused on attacking Austria,"Germany coach Joachim Loew has promised more attacking football in Friday's World Cup qualifier against Austria in Munich, despite recent defensive frailties.","Loew's Germany are five-points clear at the top of Group C, with Austria second on goal difference, but Austria coach Marcel Koller will be hoping to exploit the Germans' defensive weaknesses of late. Germany suffered a 4-3 defeat away to the USA in June, while Paraguay raced into a 2-0 lead in Kaiserslautern last month before Germany fought back for a 3-3 draw. In both friendlies, the German defence struggled as Loew experimented with his line-up. During the 53-year-old's seven years in charge, Germany have developed into an attacking powerhouse, but on Tuesday defensive midfielder Sami Khedira called for their prowess going forward to be paired with the efficient defending the Germans have always been known for. Although question marks have been raised after recent results, Germany have leaked just seven goals in their six qualifiers so far, while scoring 22 in the process, and Loew has said he wants to see his team continue to push forward. ""I'm not prepared to see us fall back and only push forward on the counter-attack,"" said Loew. ""We are not going to hide in our half of the field and let the opposition attack. ""The team can't only be strong in attack, we have to also do well in defence, but we're not going to be defensive in our overall orientation."" Loew said he expects Austria, for whom 10 members of their squad ply their trade in the Bundesliga, to attack at every opportunity as they need three points to stay in the World Cup qualification hunt. ""This Austria team will be highly motivated, a lot of them play in the Bundesliga and they have matured over the last few years,"" said Loew. ""They have a good pressing game and are quick on the counter-attack, they will be brave and come at us."" Germany won the away match 2-1 in Vienna in September 2012 with Arsenal's new-signing Mesut Ozil scoring the winning penalty, but Austria striker Marko Arnautovic missed a chance to equalise in the dying stages and the Werder Bremen star has said they ""owe"" Germany a defeat. With their rivals Republic of Ireland and Sweden also meeting in Dublin on Friday, a win in Munich would put Germany in pole-position to confirm their qualification ahead of next Tuesday's away trip to minnows Faroe Islands, who are bottom of the group. The winner of each qualifying group is guaranteed a World Cup place while the eight best runners-up of the nine groups go into play-offs. The statistics point to a German win: 1986 was the last time Austria beat Germany, but curiously the hosts have never won a qualification game at Munich's Allianz Arena. Germany are without vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger and Khedira will be partnered by either Borussia Dortmund's Sven Bender or Bayern Munich's Toni Kroos. Having beaten Sweden 2-1 in June, Austrian confidence is high and Bayern Munich left-back David Alaba, who will be in the unusual position of playing with the away team at the Allianz Arena, said they want to shock Germany. ""We want to make life as hard as possible for the Germans,"" he declared. ""We're going there looking to come away with a result. We have no need to be scared."""
296,01/09/2013,20:20,Football: Mkhitaryan fires Dortmund top of Bundesliga,Borussia Dortmund knocked Bayern Munich off top spot in the Bundesliga on Sunday as new signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan scored both goals in their 2-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt.,"The 24-year-old attacking midfielder proved why Dortmund paid Shakhtar Donetsk 27.5 million euros ($36.3m) for him with his first two league goals in only his third Bundesliga appearance. It means Dortmund go into the international break for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers two points clear of European champions Bayern. Mkhitaryan started off by finishing a defence-splitting pass from Poland winger Jakub Blaszczykowski after ten minutes. Frankfurt equalised when Stefan Aigner's bullet-header slammed off the post and Czech striker Vaclav Kadlec rifled home the rebound on 36 minutes for his first Bundesliga goal, having joined from Sparta Prague last month. But Mkhitaryan restored Dortmund's lead with the winner when he dribbled along the edge of the area and unleashed a fearsome shot past Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp. However, the Armenian said Dortmund must improve to keep Bayern in second. ""I feel good in Dortmund and I'm happy with the goals, but I think we need to be much better,"" insisted Mkhitaryan, while Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp described the midfielder as ""a weapon in front of goal with an awesome shooting technique"". The result means Dortmund finish the weekend as the league's only team with a 100 percent record as Bayern, who drew 1-1 with Freiburg on Tuesday, Mainz and Bayer Leverkusen all dropped points. Earlier, VfB Stuttgart romped to a 6-2 Bundesliga win over Hoffenheim with striker Vedad Ibisevic netting a hat-trick after coach Bruno Labbadia was sacked last Monday. Stuttgart picked up their first points of the season after three straight defeats led to Labbadia's dismissal. Caretaker coach Thomas Schneider got off to an emphatic start as Stuttgart's Romanian striker Alexandru Maxim did the damage by scoring two goals and setting up two more, while Bosnia striker Ibisevic claimed a hat-trick. The result lifts Stuttgart out of the bottom three and into 14th and leaves Hoffenheim 11th after their first defeat of the season. On Saturday, Leverkusen blew the chance to go top with a 2-0 defeat at resurgent Schalke 04. Both Germany left-back Dennis Aogo, who has joined Schalke on loan from Hamburg, and Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, who signed a four-year deal after arriving from AC Milan on Friday, started as the Royal Blues picked up their first league win of the season. Schalke went ahead with half an hour gone when a free-kick went in off midfielder Marco Hoeger's right shoulder before Peru forward Jefferson Farfan made sure of the win when he drilled home an 83rd-minute penalty after being hauled down in the area. Mainz 05 also wasted their opportunity to go top as they crashed to a 4-1 defeat at Hanover 96. Mainz took a 12th-minute lead through striker Nicolai Mueller, but Senegal striker Mame Diouf and Poland forward Artur Sobiech put the hosts 2-1 up at the break before Ivory Coast forward Didier Ya Konan and midfielder Edgar Prib increased the lead. Elsewhere, struggling Hamburg picked up their first win of the season after two consecutive defeats with a 4-0 thumping of promoted Eintracht Braunschweig. Dutch international Rafael van der Vaart put Hamburg ahead in the seventh minute on their first attack before Cameroon striker Jacques Zoua doubled the lead on 17 minutes as the hosts counter-attacked at pace. Hamburg made sure of the three points -- and Braunschweig's fourth straight defeat to leave Eintracht bottom of the table -- when 19-year-old Turkish midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu came on for Van der Vaart on 79 minutes to claim a brace, including a stunning free-kick. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach moved up to seventh as they romped to a 4-1 home win over Werder Bremen. Wolfsburg enjoyed a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin with Ivica Olic and Diego on target, while Augsburg picked up their second straight win with a 1-0 success at Nuremberg thanks to a late goal from substitute Kevin Vogt."

Lewandowski celebrated his 101st Bundesliga appearance when he converted Marco Reus's cross from the right in the 55th minute to claim the three points. ""I had a lot of chances and we're happy that we won, but we have to improve our game, 1-0 at home is not enough,"" admitted Lewandowski, who turned 25 on Wednesday.

""In a way it was good that we didn't score earlier, because it would have taken some of the fire out of the players,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""This way, they had their feet on the gas for the whole 90 minutes.

307,23/08/2013,15:15,Football: Dortmund's delight at record sales and profit,"Sensible trading on the transfer market coupled with consistently strong performances on the pitch are the main factors behind Borussia Dortmund's record financial returns, according to CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke.","Dortmund have posted record turnover of 305 million euros revenue (US$407.6m) and 53.3 million euros profit after tax for the 2012/13 fiscal year, up from 215.2m and 34.3m respectively the previous year, despite winning no silverware last season. Dortmund's bumper figures leave them second only in the Bundesliga to German champions Bayern Munich who posted just over 373m euros of turnover for the 2011/12 season having won an unprecedented treble of Champions League, German title and German Cup last season. Despite losing May's Champions League final 2-1 to Bayern at Wembley, Dortmund's sales revenue is up 42 percent on the previous year and Watzke put the boosted figures down to the performances of Jurgen Klopp's team. ""We have been growing very fast and very dynamically for the past few years,"" Watzke said after the figures were released on Thursday. ""The longevity of our sporting development is the most important thing here above all else."" Dortmund finished runner-up in both last season's Champions League and Bundesliga having won the league and cup double in the 2011-12 season, but their progress in Europe last season reaped big returns. Reaching the Wembley final brought in 54 million euros alone, while Dortmund also made twelve million euros revenue from their six Champions League home matches. While their marketing and merchandise sales are also up, any revenue earned on the transfer market was quickly reinvested. The 37 million euros pocketed from the sale of Germany midfielder Mario Goetze to Bayern was spent on attacking midfielders Henrikh Mkhitaryan (27.5m euros) and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (13m). Greece defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos (9.5m) was also signed from Werder Bremen. Having only narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 2005 after borrowing heavily to recruit players and pay their inflated wage bill, Watzke has insisted on a transfer policy that only money earned can be invested in new players."

Defending champions Bayern Munich, Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen, who host Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday, and Mainz 05, who are home to VfL Wolfsburg the same day, are the other three Bundesliga times with 100 percent records. Bremen have won both their matches under new coach Robin Dutt by with 1-0 victories away against promoted Eintracht Braunschweig and home to Augbsurg respectively having flirted with relegation last season. Bremen last lifted some silverware when they won the German Cup in 2009, but Klopp said their is too much talent in the Bremen team to take them lightly at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. ""There is a lot of attacking potential slumbering in this Bremen squad, so we have to be very careful,"" said Klopp with Bremen expected to give Argentinian striker Franco di Santo his debut after signing from Wigan Athletic a week ago. Champions League finalists Dortmund have had just four days to prepare for Bremen's visit since their 2-1 home win over promoted Braunschweig last Sunday. Borussia needed 75 minutes before rising star Jonas Hofmann broke the deadlock with a super strike before Germany's Marco Reus netted a penalty to claim the three points. Klopp expects Bremen to have a similar game plan to Braunchweig to defend hard and hit Dortmund on the break whenever possible. ""Bremen have showed they are very patient, it might be that Bremen will have similar match plan as Braunschweig,"" said the 46-year-old. Dortmund's Australian reserve goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak could be set to play with Roman Weidenfeller suffering from gastroenteritis, while Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan sits out again with a back injury he aggravated on international duty last week. Defending champions Bayern host Nuremberg on Saturday with Germany midfield star Mario Goetze set to make his league debut since joining from Borussia Dortmund for 37 million euros (US$49.5m). ""Obviously it's going to take a little longer before I recover my rhythm and really get back to 100 percent,"" said the 21-year-old Goetze who has not played since tearing his hamstring in April's Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid for Dortmund. France winger Franck Ribery is out with an ankle injury he suffered in last Saturday's 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Javi Martinez, who has yet to lose a league game for Bayern, is in contention for selection again having been left out of the match day squad at Frankfurt after a long flight back from Ecuador after playing for Spain. Hamburg travel to Hertha Berlin on Saturday looking for an improved performance after they were hammered 5-1 at home to Hoffenheim last Saturday. Coach Thorsten Fink was so furious with his team that he gave them two days off, but both midfielder Tomas Rincon and defender Dennis Aogo have been thrown out of the squad for using the time to fly to Mallorca. ""The two days off had been meant to think about what they could do better in future, not to go partying. They couldn't have made a worse decision,"" said Hamburg CEO Carl Jarchow, with the north German team having leaked eight goals in just two games.

The 35-year-old Lazio star has made 128 appearances for Germany and scored 67 goals -- just one short of Germany's record scorer Mueller. The ex-Werder Bremen and Bayern Munich forward has claimed 14 of those goals at three World Cups, leaving him just one behind the competition record of 15 held by Brazil's Ronaldo. Klose could finish the 2014 World Cup with two personal records, but said his priority is winning the world title with the German team. ""The title with the team has top priority,"" he said. ""If I can win the 2014 World Cup in Brazil that would be the greatest for me. Everything else would be secondary."" Klose, who is now in the final year of his Lazio contract, has said he could be prepared to return to the Bundesliga next summer. ""I want to play a good season, play the World Cup and then take it from there,"" he said. ""I am still fit and still feel like playing football, then certainly the Bundesliga is an option.

The 29-year-old, who scored Bayern's winning goal in May's Champions League final against Dortmund, only returned to the starting line-up last season after injury to Toni Kroos, but the he said competition for places is a healthy thing in the Bayern ranks. ""It was our strength last season that we never lost our quality, even when players dropped out with injury,"" Robben told German daily Bild. ""You have to trust yourself and not be afraid of the opposition. ""And with a World Cup at the end of the season, even if you sit out the occasional game, it could be a positive thing at the end of the day."" With 10 full international midfielders in the Bayern squad, Brazil's Luiz Gustavo is on the verge of a move to VfL Wolfsburg according to reports while Munich travel to a Frankfurt side who are licking their wounds just now. While Bayern kicked off the season with a 3-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach last Friday, Eintracht were hammered 6-1 at promoted Hertha Berlin. And they could be forgiven for feeling a sense of trepidation ahead of this weekend's game, given that Bayern have not lost in any of their last 19 away matches in the Bundesliga. Bayern's Spain star Javi Martinez will also be looking to maintain his remarkable Bundesliga record of having yet to lose a German league match after 25 wins and three draws. Champions League finalists Dortmund host promoted Eintracht Braunschweig on Sunday with Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan out for two weeks with a back injury he aggravated playing for his country in Wednesday's 3-3 draw with Paraguay. Dortmund got off to a flying start last weekend when Gabon forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick on his Bundesliga debut in the 4-0 win at Augsburg. And Poland striker Robert Lewandowski is set to make his 100th league appearance having scored 55 goals in Germany's top flight. Having won promotion, Braunschweig went down to a late goal at Werder Bremen last weekend. Their coach Torsten Lieberknecht and Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp were teammates at Mainz between 1995 and 2001, while Lieberknecht's last five games for Mainz came with Klopp as coach. Hertha are flying high after their 6-1 victory at home to Frankfurt which went down as the biggest win on the opening day of the season for any newly-promoted club in Germany's top flight. Having spent last season in Germany's second tier, the club from the capital's result left them as the surprise league leaders after the first week.

Schalke's new-signing Adam Szalai scored the Royal Blues' crucial third goal to share the points with Hamburg while Gabon forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang marked his Dortmund debut with a hat-trick. Mainz's Shinji Okazaki of Japan and Leverkusen's South Korea star Son Heung-Min both also scored on their respective debuts. But there was bad news for Germany coach Joachim Loew as Schalke's teenage midfielder Julian Draxler withdrew from Wednesday's international friendly against Paraguay. The 19-year-old attacking midfielder limped off after only 23 minutes against Hamburg having damaged his left Achilles tendon. ""The injury could quickly get inflamed and turn into a long drawn-out affair, so it makes no sense (for him to play on Wednesday),"" said Schalke team manager Horst Heldt. Schalke took the lead at home to Hamburg when Holland striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar struck after just 84 seconds before compatriot Rafael van der Vaart netted a 12th-minute penalty to level. Striker Maximilian Beister produced a bullet header on 24 minutes to put Hamburg in front before Huntelaar levelled right at the end of the first half. Ex-Dortmund defender Lasse Sobiech then headed the hosts ahead just after half-time before Hungary's Szalai, who joined Schalke from Mainz in the summer, pounced on a mistake by Hamburg goalkeeper Rene Adler on 72 minutes for a share of the points. Okazaki netted in Mainz 05's 3-2 home win over his ex-club VfB Stuttgart -- who he left last month.
