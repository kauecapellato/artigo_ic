0,20/12/2020,17:15,"Volland helps Monaco end losing streak, Rennes move level with Marseille",Germany striker Kevin Volland scored his sixth Ligue 1 goal as Monaco battled to a 1-0 win at bottom club Dijon on Sunday to snap a three-match losing streak.,"Successive defeats by Lille, Marseille and Lens had seen Monaco slip nine points behind previous leaders Lille heading into the weekend. Their win on Sunday moved the seventh-placed principality club within seven points of current leaders Lyon, although Lille and Paris Saint-Germain will both be eyeing top spot when they meet later in the day. Former Bayer Leverkusen forward Volland slotted in the only goal on 15 minutes, with both sides seeing later efforts ruled out by VAR. ""After four straight wins and then three defeats on the bounce, the most important thing was to win,"" said coach Niko Kovac. ""It was not the best Monaco but we showed lots of character and that's the best way to move forward."" Rennes are two points ahead Monaco in fifth after strolling to a 3-0 win at Lorient, who sit second-from-bottom after their 11th defeat of the season. Damien Da Silva opened the scoring with a deflected close-range effort midway through the first half, and Benjamin Bourigeaud doubled the away side's lead with a fine first-time strike with 20 minutes remaining. Martin Terrier completed the scoring six minutes later when he cut in from the left before curling home past Paul Nardi. Rennes are level with Marseille on 28 points, five behind Lyon, although they have played two games more than the team from the south coast. One point ahead of Lorient in 18th place are Nimes, who came away from Saint-Etienne with a 2-2 draw. Elsewhere, Montpellier missed the chance to move into fourth as they were held to a 2-2 draw a"

Mbappe then replaced the Italy international in the latter stages and added a late double of his own as Thomas Tuchel's team -- for whom Neymar was outstanding -- bounced back from their midweek Champions League loss to Manchester United and made it six consecutive Ligue 1 victories. The result allowed PSG to go top of the table, a point clear of Lille, although the northerners can reclaim first place by beating Nice on Sunday. ""The most important thing was to get back to winning ways at home,"" captain Marquinhos told Canal+. ""We know this season is not going to be easy. We are going to have lots of matches, we rotated the team here but we were still competitive on the field."" The reigning champions were missing nine players due to injury or suspension, including Angel di Maria and Marco Verratti, while Mbappe was rested at kick-off ahead of a trip to Turkey to play Istanbul Basaksehir on Wednesday. In a game played behind closed doors in the French capital because of the health crisis, Kean came in and converted a Mitchel Bakker cross to open the scoring in the third minute. Neymar then headed against the post before setting up Kean's second goal midway through the first half. Released on the counter-attack by Julian Draxler, Neymar ran half the length of the field with the ball before leaving Kean with an easy finish. PSG lost Draxler to injury in the second half before Mbappe replaced Kean and ran onto a Neymar pass to make it 3-0 eight minutes from time. In the 88th minute Neymar produced a lovely pass to pick out Pablo Sarabia, who teed up Mbappe to seal the win. Marseille won 1-0 at Lorient earlier with a second-half goal from Argentine defender Leonardo Balerdi moving them up to fourth just behind Rennes, who lost 2-1 to Angers on Friday. Andre Villas-Boas's side host Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday. Lens' home clash with Nantes scheduled for Sunday was called off after they lost the equivalent of a whole team to positive coronavirus tests. In a statement, the French league (LFP) said that ""noting the certain absence of 11 Lens players from a list of 30 because of positive RT-PCR tests...it has decided to postpone the game between Lens and Nantes scheduled for Sunday to a later date"". Lens did not confirm the identity of the players concerned, but local newspaper La Voix du Nord reported that two staff members, including coach Franck Haise, were also positive. ""The health situation takes priority but this changes a lot of things for the league itself,"" said the Nantes coach, Christian Gourcuff, whose squad had already travelled to Lens. ""I think that what we have experienced is going to happen again."" It is not the first time this season a Ligue 1 game has been postponed due to Covid-19. Marseille's meeting with Bordeaux on the opening night of the campaign in August was rescheduled for the same reason. After that, and fearing an avalanche of postponements, the LFP relaxed its health protocol to ensure games could go ahead as long as at least 20 players from a list of 30 on each team tested negative. The Ligue 2 game between Grenoble and Nancy scheduled for Saturday was also postponed after 13 Grenoble players tested positive along with five staff members. Lens and its surrounding region, in far northern France, are currently under a nighttime curfew along with much of the country as part of efforts to reduce the spread of the virus. France has recorded more than one million cases and close to 35,000 deaths from Covid-19."
2,24/10/2020,13:34,Another PSG player tests positive for coronavirus,An unnamed Paris Saint-Germain player has tested positive for Covid-19 and will miss the club's Ligue 1 match against Dijon on Saturday.,"PSG were badly hit by the virus at the start of the current season, when Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, Angel Di Maria and Leandro Paredes all had to self-isolate after a holiday to Ibiza following the team's Champions League final loss to Bayern Munich. The player would also likely miss Wednesday's Champions League game at Istanbul Basaksehir. Thomas Tuchel's men lost their opening group match at home to Manchester United earlier this week."
3,21/09/2020,18:57,Arsenal sign Dijon goalkeeper Runarsson,Arsenal signed Iceland goalkeeper Runar Alex Runarsson from Dijon on Monday to act as back-up for first choice Bernd Leno.,"Runarsson joins the Premier League club for a reported 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) after agreeing a four-year contract. The 25-year-old replaces Emiliano Martinez after the Argentine keeper joined Aston Villa last week. Englishman Matt Macey was on the bench as Arsenal beat West Ham on Saturday. ""We want to create healthy competition for places and we look forward to seeing Alex bring further depth to the goalkeeping position,"" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta told the club's website. Runarsson joined Ligue 1 club Dijon in July 2018 and made 13 appearances in all competitions last season. He started his career with Icelandic outfit KR Reykjavik and went on to join FC Nordsjaelland in Denmark before moving to Dijon. ""We're very pleased to welcome Alex to our squad. We have been monitoring him for some time and from the analysis, he has strong attributes that we look for in a goalkeeper and as a person,"" Arsenal technical director Edu said."

Delcourt said the 26-year-old, who joined Dijon from Olympiacos in January and has been capped four times by Algeria, had been hospitalised and ""put on morphine"" before undergoing surgery. Delcourt did not say if the player was in danger of losing the use of the hand."
5,29/02/2020,22:28,PSG ease past Dijon without banned Neymar,Kylian Mbappe scored twice and grabbed an assist as runaway Ligue 1 leaders Paris Saint-Germain coasted to a 4-0 win over Dijon on Saturday despite the absence of the suspended Neymar.,"Pablo Sarabia struck the opener inside three minutes at the Parc des Princes, as PSG played without Neymar who was serving a one-match ban after his red card in last week's win over Bordeaux. Dijon, who beat PSG 2-1 at home in November, are hovering just above the relegation play-off place but held out for 70 minutes before PSG added a second through Mbappe. The France international then set up Mauro Icardi for a third goal just moments after the Argentine came on as a replacement for Edinson Cavani. Mbappe bagged his second and PSG's fourth in stoppage time as Thomas Tuchel's side preserved their 13-point lead over Marseille at the top of the table. ""It was a good match. We were able to score quickly which settled us down,"" said PSG captain Marquinhos, who admitted his dismay at the decision to scrap the customary pre-match handshakes as part of safety measures related to the coronavirus outbreak. The players also made their way into the ground via a side door, ditching the traditional entrance in front of dozens of supporters. ""We don't like that too much,"" said Marquinhos. ""As a Brazilian, I like contact, the energy of people. We don't like to stay in our corner. But you have to be vigilant to stay healthy."" PSG travel to Lyon on Wednesday for a French Cup semi-final and play Strasbourg next weekend, with the return leg against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on March 11. ""The group absolutely wants to show against Dortmund that it's capable of taking this step forward,"" said Tuchel. ""They're having a very consistent season with lots of wins and strong performances. We can't lose confidence in this team. The players have shown this week they want to play that game, and they did again today."" The hosts were already without Marco Verratti due to suspension and injured skipper Thiago Silva, and lost Angel Di Maria to a thigh problem early in the first half. Tuchel said he was confident Di Maria would make a swift recovery, adding the decision to take him off was one of precaution. By that point PSG were already leading through Sarabia's ninth goal of 2020 -- and PSG's second quickest of the campaign -- after he redirected a mishit shot from Marquinhos. Dijon goalkeeper Alex Runarsson produced a number of saves to keep the visitors in touch, but he was eventually beaten again when Mbappe rounded the Iceland international following a slick ball through from Julian Draxler. Mbappe turned provider when he helped the ball across for Icardi to apply a sharp finish on 74 minutes. He then increased his league-best goals tally to 18 in stoppage time after a scramble in the area. Elsewhere, Rennes moved four points clear of Lille in the race for the third and final Champions League spot with a 2-0 win at bottom club Toulouse. Montpellier climbed to fifth following a 3-0 victory over Strasbourg while Monaco drew 1-1 at home to Reims despite a Wissam Ben Yedder penalty -- his 17th goal of the season. Angers won 1-0 away to Brest while Metz defeated Amiens 1-0 on the road. Marseille strengthened their grip on second place on Friday as Dario Benedetto scored a hat-trick in a 3-2 win at lowly Nimes."
6,28/02/2020,16:53,English youngster Mavididi grasping chance to grow at Dijon,"With his path to the Juventus first team blocked by stiff competition, Stephy Mavididi is finally coming into his own at Dijon, in what is effectively his first full season at the top level.","A late arrival on loan from Juventus at the end of the summer transfer window, the 21-year-old Mavididi, part of a diaspora of young English talents, has developed into a key player for a team scrapping to stay in Ligue 1. While many Dijon fans initially knew little of their August signing, Mavididi has thrust himself into the spotlight with a return of eight goals in 26 matches for the Burgundy club. Born in Derby to Congolese parents, the forward graduated from the Arsenal academy, yet never made a first-team appearance for the Gunners. Following loan spells with Charlton (twice) and Preston in the lower tiers, Mavididi moved to Juventus in August 2018 for 1.5 million euros ($1.65 million). He played just once in Serie A last season -- a 21-minute cameo against SPAL. Having gradually forced his way into Massimiliano Allegri's plans in Turin, a switch of coach and the appointment of Maurizio Sarri prompted Mavididi to look elsewhere for regular game time. ""He essentially played with the 'B' team, which plays in Serie C. Whether at Arsenal or Juve, he faced a lot of strong competition,"" said Sebastien Larcier, in charge of player recruitment at Dijon. ""We had the opportunity to bring him here thanks to the network of (club advisor) Peguy Luyindula, who knows Arsene Wenger and Thierry Henry, and our coach Stephane Jobard, who has contacts at Juventus."" Despite his tender years, Dijon is already Mavididi's fifth club. ""Stephy quickly understood all the interest he had in coming to a Ligue 1 club, to get playing time and the chance to express himself,"" said Jobard. ""I was interested in his speed, his ability to score. ""There's real potential with him which he must make the most of. He needs to improve in the final phase, but he's adapted well to the demands of Ligue 1. ""You mustn't forget he's a foreigner, is young, and needs some time to adjust."" Mavididi's team-mate Nayef Aguerd believes the England youth international has a bright future. ""For a defender, he's the type of forward who's difficult to mark because he's lively, capable of playing deep, and his technique allows him to get rid of his opponent,"" said Aguerd. ""He has genuine potential. He's going to come on a lot,"" added the Morocco international. Up next for Dijon is Saturday's trip to league leaders Paris Saint-Germain, another chance for Mavididi to test himself against France's very best."
7,12/02/2020,23:54,Six-goal PSG into French Cup semi-finals as Lyon knock out Marseille,Paris Saint-Germain cruised into the semi-finals of the French Cup on Wednesday after thumping Dijon 6-1 in a match that saw the French champions benefit again from comical own goals.,"PSG were ahead just 47 seconds after kick off thanks to Wesley Lautoa shanking Mitchel Bakker's low cross into his own net to the bemusement of his teammates. It was the second own goal in a week to be scored for PSG, who also saw Lyon's Fernando Marcal slam a stunning effort past his own goalkeeper at the weekend. However the hosts were level in the 13th minute thanks to a impressive low curling effort from Mounir Chouiar, which squeezed past Kaylor Navas. While the away side were far from full strength, with Angel Di Maria and Mauro Icardi on the bench and Neymar not even in the squad, Thomas Tuchel's team did include Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani, who was making his first start in over a month after nearly moving to Atletico Madrid in January. The Uruguayan was left waiting his 200th goal for the club in the 21st minute when he turned home Thomas Meunier's cross, only for the strike to be ruled out for handball by the Belgian after a VAR check. ""It's not that bad because he can score his 200th goal on Saturday (against Amiens) or Tuesday (against Borussia Dortmund). I can feel he's there,"" said Tuchel. On the match, he added: ""I'm happy because we deserved the victory. It's a huge performance."" Mbappe put PSG ahead a minute before the break, punishing Jhonder Cadiz's miss when clean through seconds before by clinically slotting home a similar chance. Thiago Silva added a third four minutes after the break with a header from a corner before Pablo Sarabia ended Dijon's resistance by pushing home his 11th of the season on the rebound. Senou Coulibaly watched on in horror with five minutes left when Mbappe's cross looped off his thigh over helpless stopper Runar Alex Runarsson, before Sarabia tapped home his second in stoppage time from another Mbappe centre. Later, Lyon coach Rudi Garcia knocked his former side Marseille out as Houssem Aouar scored an 81st minute winner. The winning goal came 10 minutes after Lyon's Moussa Dembele had a penalty -- awarded when Hiroki Sakai handled a shot from Karl Toko Ekambi -- saved by Yohan Pele in the Marseille goal. It was the third time this season that Dembele had missed from the spot for Lyon. On Thursday, fourth division side Epinal -- last 16 conquerers of Lille -- will look to continue their stunning cup run going when they host Saint-Etienne. They will try to succeed where fellow fourth-tier outfit Belfort failed following their 3-0 defeat to holder Rennes on Tuesday."
8,15/02/2019,23:27,Lyon ready for 'game of season' with Barcelona after Guingamp win,"Lyon edged rock-bottom Guingamp 2-1 in Ligue 1 on Friday with a fabulous winner from captain Nabil Fekir, just days ahead of Barcelona's visit for a Champions League clash.","Lyon consolidated third place in Ligue 1 while resting a couple of key players and even taking their foot off the gas with Barcelona in mind. ""It's our game of the year, it'll be a big match, but we often do well in them,"" Lyon president Jean Michel Aulas told French TV. ""Bruno (Genesio the Lyon coach) takes tactical risks and we have surprised (Manchester) City before, and this stadium was built for matches like this,"" he added on their 60,000-capacity home. ""Many of the players had Tuesday on their minds but with Barcelona coming that's normal,"" said Genesio, mastermind of the four points Lyon took off City in the group phase to squeeze into the last-16. ""We have some doubts still about who is playing on Tuesday, but you'll have to wait until Monday to find out,"" Genesio added. Ahead of their Sunday game with Saint Etienne, PSG still lead Ligue 1 on 59 points with Lille second on 49 and Lyon third on 46. Martin Terrier put Lyon ahead after a scramble on 15 minutes before defender Leo Dubois was then overpowered five minutes later by Guingamp's Cameroon midfielder Felix Eboa Eboa, who rushed in for a header at the far post shouldering the defender out of the way to make it 1-1. But then on 35 minutes Fekir controlled the ball on his chest, took a quick touch to set himself up for the shot and curled a fabulous left-foot shot into the top corner from outside the box. Fekir, however, will miss the game against Barcelona through suspension. ""I'll be in the stadium supporting my teammates from the stands and I'll believe in them all the way,"" said French international Fekir. One other worry for Lyon was the loss of lively striker Moussa Dembele, who was replaced late on by Dutch forward Memphis Depay. Earlier Friday, Nimes secured top flight survival with a 2-0 win over Dijon"
9,27/01/2019,23:14,PSG cruise to victory as worries grow over Neymar fitness,Edinson Cavani scored twice as Paris Saint-Germain shook off the loss of Neymar to injury with a 4-1 win over Rennes at the Parc des Princes on Sunday that keeps them unbeaten at the top of Ligue 1.,"The Uruguayan's goals took him to 16 for the season in 14 league appearances and bookended the scoring in the French capital, with Angel Di Maria and Kylian Mbappe also on target for PSG. Mbaye Niang had equalised for Rennes in the first half, but Thomas Tuchel's side eventually ran away with the game after the break and are once again a massive 13 points ahead of Lille at the top of the table, with two matches in hand. Despite that, this encounter was played out in a rather flat atmosphere, with one end of the stadium partially closed as a punishment following incidents during a game late last year. Brazil coach Tite and national team coordinator Edu were in attendance at the start of a European tour to check on the form of some of their key players, but it is unclear what they will have taken from this game. Neymar was missing after suffering a metatarsal injury in a French Cup win over Strasbourg in midweek, with some media reports in France now claiming that the world's most expensive player will definitely miss the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie against Manchester United on February 12. Meanwhile, a lack of alternatives meant Tuchel fielded Marquinhos and Daniel Alves out of position together in midfield. On top of that, skipper Thiago Silva was caught out as Niang flicked Rennes level just before the half-hour, cancelling out Cavani's headed opener from a Di Maria cross. Rennes were arguably the better side in the first half, although Tuchel was raging after Niang escaped with a yellow card for a dangerous challenge on Thilo Kehrer. The referee upheld his decision even after a VAR review. Nevertheless, PSG ran away with the game after the break, going back in front on the hour mark when Silva sent Di Maria through to clip a delightful finish over Tomas Koubek. When Clement Grenier was caught in possession, Julian Draxler released Mbappe to score his 18th league goal of the campaign and make it 3-1. PSG completed the scoring in the 71st minute when Mbappe squared for Cavani to grab his second of the evening, making it 15 goals in three home wins for them in nine days. Earlier, Lyon strengthened their grip on a Champions League position after defender Jason Denayer's headed goal handed them a 1-0 win at Amiens. With their Champions League last-16 first leg against Barcelona looming on the horizon, Lyon remain third in Ligue 1, three points behind second-placed Lille. Lille won 2-1 at Marseille on Friday in a game which was held up for more than half an hour in the second half after a firecracker thrown from the stands exploded next to home player Kevin Strootman. Struggling Monaco slumped to a 2-0 defeat at relegation rivals Dijon on Saturday in their first game since Thierry Henry was sacked as coach. Henry lasted just three months in charge before being replaced by his predecessor Leonardo Jardim, who watched Saturday's game in the stands in Dijon. Monaco remain three points from outright safety."
10,26/01/2019,23:12,Monaco plight persists in wake of Henry exit,"Monaco suffered another damaging defeat as they lost 2-0 at Dijon in Ligue 1 on Saturday, just 24 hours after reappointing former boss Leonardo Jardim to take over from the sacked Thierry Henry.","Former France and Arsenal star Henry was suspended and later axed by Monaco after just two wins in the league since his arrival in October. Jardim, who led Monaco to the French title in 2017, is returning to the club only three months after he was dismissed following a dreadful start to the season. His first game back in charge will be Tuesday's League Cup semi-final against Guingamp, as Henry's former assistant Franck Passi oversaw the trip to fellow strugglers Dijon. The abject nature of this latest defeat further emphasised Monaco's perilous position in the table where they remain second from bottom, a point above last-placed Guingamp. ""We're giving everything but it's not enough,"" said Monaco captain Radamel Falcao. ""Each player has to continue to give more, all of us together. We're all in the same boat. ""We didn't manage to change things with Thierry Henry and now we must carry on with a better spirit and all fight together."" Dijon's Kwon Chang-hoon notched his first league goal since May, having recently returned from an Achilles injury, with a calm finish on 24 minutes after a static Naldo played the South Korean onside. Monaco were reduced to 10 men on the hour when Brazilian Naldo saw red for a clumsy challenge on Julio Tavares, and another defensive lapse allowed Naim Sliti to wrap up what was just Dijon's second league win since August. It was Naldo's second red card in a week after he was also dismissed in the 5-1 loss to Strasbourg last Saturday. ""We had chances just like in the past four of five matches but we always make a mistake that kills us,"" said Passi, who refused to be drawn on his own future. ""We let the other team go ahead and we're chasing after the result and that obviously makes it harder,"" he added. ""These players have the quality. They have what it takes to stay up but they just need for things to click and for it to happen quickly."" Youcef Atal and Allan Saint-Maximin scored for Patrick Vieira's Nice in a 2-0 home win over Nimes, while Kenny Lala fired home a sweet half-volley with practically the final kick to give Strasbourg a 1-0 victory over Bordeaux. Reims climbed into the top half as a 1-0 win at Guingamp stretched their unbeaten run to six matches. On Sunday, leaders Paris Saint-Germain will host Rennes without the injured Neymar. The world's most expensive player limped out of Wednesday's French Cup win over Strasbourg after hurting his foot, an injury similar to the one that ruled him out for more than two months last season. PSG coach Thomas Tuchel has said it is ""still too early"" to assess the seriousness of Neymar's injury, leaving the French giants sweating over his fitness ahead of their Champions League clash with Manchester United next month."
11,10/01/2019,12:27,Dijon appoint Kombouare as new coach,"Dijon have appointed Antoine Kombouare as their new coach following the dismissal of Olivier Dall'Oglio at the end of last year, the struggling Ligue 1 club announced on Thursday.","In a statement, Dijon said that former Paris Saint-Germain coach Kombouare, 55, would take the reins until the end of the season, with the option of another year should he save the club from relegation. After getting off to a flying start this season with three straight victories, Dijon have won just once since -- against bottom club Guingamp -- and languish third from bottom in Ligue 1. Last season Kombouare led Guingamp to 12th place, before being sacked in November with his team bottom of Ligue 1. A league winner as a PSG player in 1994, Kombouare also won the French Cup as manager with the capital club in 2010 and was coach when Qatari investors took over the following year. He was replaced by Carlo Ancelotti in December 2011 with PSG top of the league."
12,09/01/2019,14:20,French game moved in anticipation of more 'yellow vest' protests,"This weekend's French Ligue 1 game between Dijon and Montpellier has been put back by 24 hours as local authorities prepare for more disruptive ""yellow vest"" protests.","The game, originally scheduled for Saturday evening, will now be played on Sunday at 1700 (1600 GMT) following a request from police in the Burgundy city. The move comes after second-placed Lille's trip to Caen in Normandy was brought forward from Saturday to Friday evening. Dijon's home match against champions Paris Saint-Germain was one of a number of Ligue 1 games to be postponed in December as authorities struggled to deal with the protest movement. The revolt, marked by clashes in Paris and other French cities, is now into its eighth week."

PSG coach Thomas Tuchel can also go on holiday relaxed with his club on 47 points, as second-placed Lille, 13 points adrift, lost 2-1 at home to Toulouse. ""I'm very happy because we can see the progress of the team,"" said Tuchel. ""You can feel the energy, it's a good thing to build on next year."" With Neymar away, Angel Di Maria was in the line-up and came closest to making it 2-0, forcing a fine save from Nantes goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu, who then watched the Argentine hit the crossbar from the rebound. Meanwhile, third-placed Lyon drew 1-1 at fourth-placed Montpellier after opening the scoring thanks to their captain Nabil Fekir before a great header from Ruben Aguilar gave the surprise-package southerners a share of the spoils. Henry's Monaco were dreadful and the former Arsenal striker spat on the ground after Nolan Roux of Guingamp made fools of the Monaco defence to make it 2-0. ""I'm not going to have a good holiday,"" bemoaned Henry. ""Now you have to work and make do with what you have. ""It's necessary to work and work. There are still a lot of points to play for and that's the only positive thing about this evening."" Monaco were champions in 2017 but now have 13 points from 18 matches, just two more than Guingamp, and vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said the club needs to dip into the January transfer market. ""Until tonight, I thought we didn't need new players, but we do,"" Vasilyev told Canal+. ""It's difficult to analyse right now as I'm upset like the supporters. I understand the disappointment, it's up to us to act and draw the right conclusions."" Strasbourg paid hommage to the victims of a terror attack that killed five people on December 11 in their first home game since as they won 2-0 against Nice. Meanwhile, Marseille, in sixth, drew 1-1 at Angers and fifth-placed Saint-Etienne beat Dijon 3-0."

Local government officials in Dijon said the fixture against the league champions will be played but no travelling Parisian fans will be allowed into the Stade Gaston Gerard to watch the league leaders on Saturday. Police in the southern city of Marseille have requested that the match between Bordeaux and Marseille also be called off. Six Ligue 1 matches were postponed last weekend because of a weekend of ""yellow vest"" protests in France that descended into violence in Paris and several other cities. The government has also increased security levels following a deadly attack on the Christmas Market in the eastern city of Strasbourg on Tuesday. A spokesman at police headquarters in the region around Marseille said: ""With the yellow vest protests, the emergency plan for attacks and demonstrations planned in Marseille, we will not be able to guarantee security for this match."" The LFP said Saint-Etienne's visit to Nice, scheduled for 8:45pm (1945 GMT) on Friday, could be played on Sunday at 5:00pm. The league said it would reschedule the matches in Caen and Nantes, scene of violent demonstrations last weekend, at a later date. The matches postponed last weekend are due to be played in midweek on January 15 and 16."
15,12/11/2018,00:10,Cavani bags hat-trick as perfect PSG leave Henry's Monaco down and out,Thierry Henry's disastrous start as coach of Monaco continued on Sunday as Edinson Cavani's VAR-assisted hat-trick helped Paris Saint-Germain to an easy 4-0 win in the principality that saw them extend their perfect record in Ligue 1 this season.,"Neymar netted a penalty to complete PSG's victory, as they made it 13 wins from 13 league games under Thomas Tuchel, further stretching their start to the season that is a record in France and in Europe's so-called big five leagues. The result for them came after a week marred by revelations from French investigative website Mediapart that youth scouts at PSG had subjected potential signings to racial profiling over several years. But while they go 13 points clear of second-placed Lille at the Ligue 1 summit, the club who have been their main challengers in recent seasons continued their deeply worrying slump, with Henry again left to look on helplessly from the touchline. Champions in 2017, Monaco are in the relegation zone and five points away from outright safety having failed to win in six matches in all competitions since the Arsenal and France great took charge. They have now gone 16 games without a win altogether, with this result following a 4-0 home reverse against Club Brugge which knocked them out of the Champions League. Monaco are on their worst run in France's top flight in 32 years, at a time when Football Leaks claims about their Financial Fair Play breaches and the arrest of their Russian billionaire owner Dmitry Rybolovlev on corruption charges have cast a further shadow over the club. ""We are playing for survival, nothing else,"" said Henry, who has picked up a squad cursed by injuries. Here he was missing a dozen players due either to injury or suspension at kick-off, while both Belgian international Nacer Chadli and his replacement Jordi Mboula had to come off hurt. ""We lost two more players tonight, so it is starting to become a lot,"" he said, adding: ""I am staying positive because even with all that we managed to create chances against PSG."" The average age of his bench here was under 19, while his starting line-up featured a 17-year-old debutant in defence in Benoit Badiashile. It was little wonder that PSG -- themselves showing six changes following their Champions League draw at Napoli -- found the going so easy. They went ahead in the fourth minute when Neymar drove the ball across goal for Cavani to convert. The goal was initially disallowed before being given by the Video Assistant Referee, and the same thing happened in the 11th minute when Cavani turned the ball in again after the flag was wrongly raised for an offside against Moussa Diaby. In contrast to those two goals, a fine Julian Draxler finish in first-half stoppage time was initially given before being disallowed on review. However, Diaby squared for Cavani to complete his hat-trick in the 54th minute, and Neymar then rolled in a penalty after Kylian Mbappe had been fouled by France teammate Djibril Sidibe. ""I am very satisfied with the result, and with the fact we showed the hunger to win a 13th straight game. That is extraordinary,"" said Tuchel. ""Monaco and Henry are in a very difficult situation with lots of players out injured. This wasn't the night for Monaco to challenge us. They can do that if they have all their players back but not today."" Elsewhere on Sunday, Lucas Ocampos and Adil Rami scored as Marseille bounced back from a run of four straight defeats to beat Dijon 2-0 on an emotional afternoon at the Velodrome. A minute's silence was held before kick-off in memory of the eight people killed when two buildings collapsed in the southern French city on Monday. The result lifted Marseille up to sixth, back to within three points of third-placed Montpellier, who beat them 3-0 last weekend. Bordeaux were held to a goalless draw by Caen, while Rennes drew 1-1 with local rivals Nantes."
16,26/09/2018,23:14,Record-setting PSG make it seven wins in seven,Paris Saint-Germain set a new club record on Wednesday when a 4-1 victory over Reims gave them a seventh win from seven games this season and an eight-point lead in Ligue 1.,"With a perfect 21 points, new coach Thomas Tuchel surpassed the previous best start of 19 points by predecessor Unai Emery last season. The champions can now claim another slice of history on Saturday where a victory over Nice will allow PSG to equal Lille's all-time record of eight wins at the start of a season set back in 1936-1937. Missing the injured Lassana Diarra and suspended Kylian Mbappe, PSG surprisingly fell behind to Reims after just two minutes on Wednesday when Xavier Chavalerin stunned the Parc des Princes. But Edinson Cavani levelled after five minutes and then won the 24th-minute penalty which was converted by Neymar. Uruguay striker Cavani hit the third before half-time to take his season's goal tally to five, the same as Neymar. Thomas Meunier tucked away the fourth in the 55th minute after being set up by young striker Moussa Diaby much to the delight of watching US basketball legend Michael Jordan in town for this week's Ryder Cup. Moussa Dembele scored his first two goals for Lyon in two minutes in Dijon to set his team on course for an 3-0 victory that lifted them into second in Ligue 1. The 22-year old striker, who joined from Celtic on August 31, scored the opener after 17 minutes with a first-time chip over the goalkeeper and two minutes later added a second, acrobatically putting home a rebound. Martin Terrier headed a third in the 35th minute. On a night when six early matches produced six red cards, Lyon played the last 34 minutes with 10 men after Lucas Tousart received a second yellow card. Dijon's Enzo Loiodice followed in the final minute. Lyon are on 13 points from seven games, eight behind PSG. Lille, who started the evening in second, lost 1-0 at Bordeaux. Francois Kamano put the home team ahead after just seven minutes. Lille played the last few minutes with 10 men after Adama Soumaoro received a second yellow card. The other two teams who could have climbed to second, Marseille and Montpellier played games that followed similar patterns until the dying seconds. Montpellier fell behind at Caen to a goal by Saif-Eddine Khaoui after 10 minutes. Andy Delort and Damien Le Tallec resplied and put the visitors ahead and, briefly, second in the league. But Yacine Bammou leveled after 64 minutes. Seven minutes from time, Montpellier's Vitorino Hilton was sent off for a wild sliding tackle. Caen created dangerous chances, but Montpellier held on to draw 2-2. In Marseille, Kenny Lala broke away and put Strasboug ahead after 27 minutes. The home team replied twice just before half time. After Florian Thauvin was sent flying in the 41st minute, Dimitri Payet coolly converted the penalty. Then Morgan Sanson curled a shot inside the post to put Marseille ahead on the stroke of half time. After Jordan Amavi received a straight red in the 52nd minute the 10 men of Marseille held out until the 89th minute when Nuno Da Costa leveled for the visitors. Marseille responded with one last attack, and Valerie Germain met a low cross with a ferocious shot to secure a 3-2 win."
17,20/04/2018,23:13,Five-star Lyon take another step towards Champions League return,Captain Nabil Fekir scored a superb goal as Lyon stayed on course for a return to the Champions League by romping to a 5-2 win at Dijon in Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Memphis Depay, Houssem Aouar, Bertrand Traore and Maxwel Cornet were also on target for the visitors in Burgundy, as a rampant Lyon claimed a sixth consecutive league victory. Bruno Genesio's side -- who missed out on a Champions League place this season -- are now just a point behind second-placed Monaco, who visit Guingamp on Saturday. Crucially, they are also three points ahead of fourth-placed Marseille, who entertain Lille in another Saturday game. Only the top three sides qualify for the Champions League in Ligue 1, and OL looked to be out of the running after a poor run of form in February and into March. However, they have come roaring back on a winning run that has included a dramatic away victory at Marseille and has seen them score 19 goals while taking 18 points from a possible 18. This was the fifth away game this season in which they have scored five times, with Depay setting them on the way when he turned in a cross from fellow former Manchester United man Rafael early on. The Dutchman has now scored 15 Ligue 1 goals this season, with six coming in his last five games. A terrific Naim Sliti strike meant the scores were level at the interval, but Depay helped on another Rafael cross for Aouar to put Lyon ahead again five minutes after the break. French international Fekir, making his first start since returning from a knee injury, then dribbled into the penalty area before finishing neatly into the roof of the net at the end of a counterattack to make it 3-1 in the 53rd minute. Dijon still made a fight of it, with Sliti scoring again to reduce the deficit before the hosts were left furious when Wesley Said went down under a Rafael challenge in the box but no penalty was given. However, substitute Cornet came on to set up former Chelsea forward Traore to side-foot in Lyon's fourth, and Cornet himself completed the scoring with seven minutes left. Elsewhere on Friday, Rennes came from behind to draw 1-1 at derby rivals Nantes in a meeting of two sides fighting for Europa League qualification. Adrien Thomasson put Claudio Ranieri's Nantes in front before the break, but they then had Emiliano Sala sent off just after the restart, and James Lea-Siliki got Rennes' leveller. Rennes are fifth, in a Europa League qualifying slot, while Nantes are two points behind in eighth. Reims secured promotion back to Ligue 1 after a two-year absence, with the former European Cup finalists beating Ajaccio 1-0 to clinch the Ligue 2 title. After winning a fifth Ligue 1 title in six seasons last weekend, champions Paris Saint-Germain are at Bordeaux on Sunday."
18,31/03/2018,19:29,"Ocampos, Payet give Marseille dramatic win at Dijon",Lucas Ocampos and Dimitri Payet struck in the final minutes as Marseille claimed a precious 3-1 win at Dijon in Ligue 1 on Saturday to stay on course for a Champions League place.,"Valere Germain put Marseille in front 10 minutes before half-time, but the visitors then lost goalkeeper Steve Mandanda to injury for the second time in five matches. South Korea international Kwon Chang-Hoon curled in an equaliser for Dijon with a quarter of an hour remaining. But Germain was again involved as Marseille regained the lead on 88 minutes, his near-post header from a corner was bundled in from point-blank range by Argentine Lucas Ocampos. A frenetic finale saw Dijon reduced to 10 men when Cedric Yambere was harshly sent off after conceding a penalty for a foul on Ocampos, although the spot-kick from Payet was saved by Baptiste Reynet. But Payet, overlooked by Didier Deschamps for his latest France squad, atoned deep into stoppage time after winning another penalty, this time converting as Marseille pulled five points clear of fourth-placed Lyon. Marseille go to Germany next week for the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final against RB Leipzig, with top scorer Florian Thauvin once more unlikely to feature as he nurses a hamstring injury. Lyon, who beat Marseille 3-2 ahead of the international break, can reduce the gap on Sunday when they host a relegation-threatened Toulouse side."
19,12/02/2018,19:12,French league investigates racist abuse of Balotelli,"French football authorities told AFP on Monday they are looking into allegations by Nice forward Mario Balotelli that he ""heard monkey chants directed at him"" during a defeat at Dijon on Saturday.","The French League (LFP) told AFP ""the case will be studied on Thursday by the disciplinary commission"" but added that it doesn't have any other evidence at this stage. Balotelli was booked for gesticulating angrily at the crowd in the game on Saturday. He then complained to the referee that he had been subjected to racist abuse. Nice had posted a message on Twitter during the match claiming Balotelli had ""picked up a yellow card after... getting annoyed at fans' racist abuse"". British organisation Kick It Out, which campaigns against discrimination, weighed in with a statement saying it ""was shocked to see Mario Balotelli booked for bringing to the attention of the referee alleged racist chanting directed towards him by Dijon supporters"". Kick It Out said it ""expects a strong response from the French football authorities"". Nice president Jean-Pierre Rivere said Balotelli, whose biological parents are from Ghana, has ""all our support"". ""We deplore the fact that Mario has again had to suffer racist abuse,"" he said. ""It's unforgivable, and let's not forget that it is unfortunately not the first time in our league."" Last season Bastia were hit with a suspended one-point deduction and three-game partial stand closure by the French League over the behaviour of some of their fans. The club cancelled the season ticket of one fan in his 40s while a court in Bastia handed the supporter a two-month suspended prison sentence, a 1,000 euro ($1,227) fine and an 18-month stadium ban. Balotelli was also targeted while playing for both Inter Milan and AC Milan in his homeland. During Euro 2012, UEFA punished the Croatian Football federation and investigated Spain following racist abuse directed at Balotelli by fans. In 2014 British police investigated offensive remarks directed at Balotelli, who has played for both Manchester City and Liverpool, on Twitter. adc-mam/pgr/jde/bc/jc"
20,17/01/2018,23:46,Neymar scores four as Cavani matches Zlatan record,Neymar scored four times while Edinson Cavani equalled Zlatan Ibrahimovic's Paris Saint-Germain all-time goalscoring record as the runaway Ligue 1 leaders thrashed Dijon 8-0 on Wednesday.,"Angel Di Maria struck twice inside the opening quarter-hour at the Parc des Princes before the Argentine provided the cross for Cavani to net his 156th PSG goal. Neymar marked his return from a rib injury with the hosts' fourth just before half-time, and the Brazilian made it a hat-trick with two more second-half strikes as Dijon were mercilessly ripped apart. Kylian Mbappe piled on further misery for the visitors 13 minutes from time before Neymar notched his fourth of the evening from the penalty spot -- denying Cavani the chance to make club history. Argentine Di Maria, who grabbed the winner in Sunday's 1-0 victory at Nantes, needed just four minutes in Paris to put Unai Emery's team ahead with a stunning left-footed strike into the top corner. The former Real Madrid and Manchester United winger added a second when he applied the final touch after Neymar lifted the ball over Dijon goalkeeper Baptiste Reynet following a ball through from Cavani. The Uruguayan then netted his league-best 20th goal of the season by heading a right-wing cross from Di Maria, pulling level with the record Ibrahimovic set across four seasons in the French capital. Neymar made it 4-0 on 42 minutes with a sublime free-kick, with the world's most expensive player pouncing on a miscued clearance to double his tally just before the hour. He then struck a sensational third goal of the night with a run that beat several Dijon defenders and culminated in a crisp low drive from the edge of the area. Neymar released Mbappe as the teenager scored within five minutes of replacing Di Maria, while the Brazilian rounded out a record home win for PSG from the spot after Cavani tumbled to the ground. PSG have yet to drop a point at home this season and lead Lyon by 11 points, with a trip to face Bruno Genesio's men next up for the league leaders at the weekend. Nabil Fekir scored his 15th goal of the campaign as Lyon defeated Guingamp 2-0, with 19-year-old midfielder Houssem Aouar also on target at the Stade du Roudourou. ""Nabil's performance was extraordinary. He's been on a roll since the start of the season. He's at an international level and doing it consistently, which is a good sign for us,"" Genesio said. Claudio Ranieri's Nantes conceded a last-gasp penalty in a 1-1 draw at Toulouse, as Max-Alain Gradel salvaged a point for the hosts by cancelling out a first-half header from Slovenia international Rene Krhin."
21,15/01/2018,17:22,France suspends referee who kicked player,"The referee who kicked a player during a French Ligue 1 game and then sent him off has been suspended ""until further notice"", the French Football Federation (FFF) said on Monday.","Tony Chapron kicked Diego Carlos of Nantes towards the end of Sunday's match against Paris Saint-Germain after being knocked over when the pair collided in a bizarre incident. Chapron then showed the player a second yellow card, although that has now been rescinded, the French league told AFP, freeing him to play in their next game. The referee apologised on Monday, saying Diego Carlos had bumped into him but that his own reaction had been ""clumsy"" and ""inappropriate"". The FFF said its technical committee of referees had decided that Chapron be ""withdrawn... until further notice"". He will be called to appear before the French league's disciplinary commission to explain himself. The sanction means he has been removed from refereeing duties for Wednesday's Ligue 1 game between Angers and Troyes. The FFF statement added that 45-year-old Chapron -- who recently took charge of a game in China -- had reviewed video footage of the incident and ""noted that his fall had been caused accidentally."" Chapron apologised, saying in a statement to AFP on Monday: ""The Nantes player, Diego Carlos, crashed into me. ""At the time of the collision, I felt a sharp pain where I had recently suffered an injury. My unfortunate reaction was to stick my leg out towards the player."" Footage of the incident quickly went viral across the world. Chapron and Diego Carlos were racing to catch up with a breakaway by PSG's Kylian Mbappe as the game, which the visitors won 1-0, moved into stoppage time at the Stade de la Beaujoire. The referee appeared to cut across the Brazilian defender and contact was made, sending both to the floor. As he got up, Chapron kicked the player, catching him on his right foot. He then started to walk away before turning around and brandishing a second yellow card. He also awarded PSG a free-kick. Nantes said they had asked the disciplinary commission of the league (LFP) to meet as a matter of urgency on Monday to rescind the second yellow card and allow Diego Carlos to play in Wednesday's game against Toulouse. ""After reading Tony Chapron's report confirming...that Diego Carlos had not knocked him over deliberately, the commission has decided to withdraw the second yellow card,"" the LFP confirmed to AFP. Nantes president Waldemar Kita, who was seen laughing incredulously after the red card was shown, said he spoke to Chapron at the end of the game. ""He told me that he had never wanted to kick the player and that he had felt himself pushed in the back,"" he told French television. ""It's a joke. I got 20 text messages from across the world telling me this referee is a joke."" Nantes midfielder Valentin Rongier had a good view of the incident and called for the referee to be given a lengthy ban. ""He says he slipped, but I know he kicked him,"" Rongier told Canal+. ""I know it's very difficult to referee but you have to question them from time to time... We do that, we get a 10-match ban."" Chapron has been refereeing in France's top flight since 2004 and has taken charge of more than 400 matches, including the French Cup final in 2014. Earlier this season he was invited to referee in the Chinese Super League, officiating the game between Shanghai Shenhua and Tianjin Teda in October. He recently told a French local television channel that he would retire at the end of this season."
22,05/11/2017,17:16,"Balotelli scores, is sent off in Nice win",Mario Balotelli scored the only goal of the game as Nice beat Dijon 1-0 in Ligue 1 on Sunday but his afternoon was marred when he was sent off late on.,"The Italian striker converted a penalty five minutes from half-time after a foul on Alassane Plea in the area for his sixth league goal of the campaign. He was then sent off for the third time in Ligue 1 since moving to Nice at the start of last season, receiving a straight red card for chopping down Dijon defender Cedric Yambere from behind with a minute left. Balotelli remonstrated with the fourth official as he went off but Nice held on to end a run of four successive league defeats and six consecutive losses in all competitions. They climb back up to 15th, one point and one place above Dijon. Elsewhere on Sunday, Lyon can reclaim third place from Nantes with a win away to Saint-Etienne in the Rhone derby, one of the biggest fixtures in French football. Struggling Lille go to bottom club Metz with rumours swirling that enigmatic Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa could lose his job in the event of another slip-up. Marseille, in fifth, host Caen at the Velodrome in an atmosphere made tense after Patrice Evra was suspended by the club for aiming a karate kick at the head of one of his team's own supporters. Evra was red-carded after the incident, which occurred in the pre-match warm-up before Thursday's Europa League defeat to Vitoria Guimaraes in Portugal. A banner at one end of the ground on Sunday carried the slogan ""This Game is Over"" in English, parodying Evra's favourite slogan of ""I love this game"". Chants also rang out insulting the 36-year-old former Manchester United and Juventus left-back."
23,14/10/2017,20:05,PSG fight to go six clear in France,A Thomas Meunier brace gave Paris Saint-Germain a hard-fought 2-1 win at Dijon in Ligue 1 on Saturday after the hosts thought they'd earned a late draw through Benjamin Jeannot's stunning volley.,"The result gives PSG, whose chairman Nasser al-Khelaifi is under investigation in his capacity as beIN Media chief over the sale of World Cup broadcasting rights, a six-point lead over second-placed Monaco who lost 3-2 at Lyon on Friday. In a packed and raucous stadium, Dijon made a real fight of it as a PSG side deprived of Edinson Cavani, Marco Verratti, Thiago Motta, Thiago Silva and Layvin Kurzawa were given a rough time by the hosts. Angel Di Maria, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe could have scored a hatful and PSG hit the woodwork twice before their go-ahead goal on 70 minutes. Belgian right-back Meunier held his nerve to slot the opening goal past prone Dijon goalkeeper Baptiste Reynet, who had just parried a shot in what was an excellent performance. His teammate Jeannot's goal will be a contender for goal of the season, running at full tilt he fired a left-footed volley with such force in the 87th minute it left PSG keeper Alphonse Areola rooted to the spot. The rapture was short-lived however as Meunier again calmly slotted home as Mbappe put the ball on a platter for him deep into injury time. ""It was a small dose of destiny,"" Meunier told reporters. Meunier has now scored three league goals in his last two appearances, further strengthening his case for inclusion in Wednesday's Champions League tie at Anderlecht. ""We knew it would be tough but we were not expecting to have to fight like that,"" France midfielder Adrien Rabiot told French television after the game. ""For them it was their game of the season and their mentality and team spirit made us use up a great deal of energy."" Swiss prosecutors revealed this week they are probing PSG chairman Khelaifi, who heads the Qatari-owned beIN Media group, and disgraced former FIFA executive Jerome Valcke over the sale of media rights for World Cups from 2018-2030. FIFA said Friday it was also investigating Khelaifi over the media rights issue. On Friday, Nabil Fekir's last-gasp free-kick delivered three crucial points to Lyon as their captain sealed a home win over champions Monaco, who rested Colombian striker Radamel Falcao ahead of their midweek hosting of Besiktas."
