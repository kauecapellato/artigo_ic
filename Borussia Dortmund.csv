0,13/02/2021,17:38,Haaland spares Dortmund blushes,A late equaliser from Erling Braut Haaland spared Borussia Dortmund's blushes on Saturday as they were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Bundesliga rivals Hoffenheim.,"Haaland's 81st minute strike averted a fourth defeat in five Bundesliga games for crisis-hit Dortmund. Yet interim coach Edin Terzic remains under pressure with his side three points adrift of the Champions League places in sixth. England international Jadon Sancho gave Dortmund a perfect start, racing up the left-wing to score his fourth league goal this season on 24 minutes. Yet the lead didn't last long, as Munas Dabbur scuffed a shot past Marwin Hitz to level the scores just seven minutes later. Ihlas Bebou bundled in Hoffenheim's second just after half-time, the ball bouncing off the Togolese and back into the goal as Hitz tried to beat away a dangerous cross from the left wing. Haaland had a goal ruled out for offside in the second half before pouncing on a misplaced pass to snatch a crucial late equaliser. Fellow Champions League hopefuls Bayer Leverkusen also dropped points after they conceded two late goals to draw 2-2 with strugglers Mainz. Lucas Alario tapped in a low Moussa Diaby cross to give Leverkusen the lead on 14 minutes, and Patrik Schick appeared to seal three points with a second on 84 minutes. Yet second-from bottom Mainz were rewarded for a brave performance as late goals from Robert Glatzel and Kevin Stoeger saw them save a point and continue their recent return to form. Elsewhere, Werder Bremen were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Freiburg while Sami Khedira helped rescue a 1-1 draw for Hertha Berlin against boyhood club Stuttgart. Austrian striker Sasa Kalajdzic headed in his ninth goal of the season to give Stuttgart the lead at the end of a scrappy first half. Yet Khedira, who joined Hertha from Juventus in January, came off the bench in the second-half and set up a late equaliser for 17-year-old Luca Netz and save the capital club from a fifth straight defeat."
1,07/02/2021,22:26,Leipzig face in-form Wolfsburg in Cup quarters,"RB Leipzig will face Wolfsburg in the quarter-finals of the German Cup after Sunday's draw, while Borussia Moenchengladbach will host Borussia Dortmund in the other all-Bundesliga tie.","Leipzig are second in Germany's top division while Wolfsburg are third and on a run of five straight wins in league and cup. The other top flight side left in the competition, Werder Bremen, will travel to second-tier Jahn Regensburg as clubs eye a cup that looks much more winnable with Bayern Munich out of the way. Bayern's conquerers at the last-32 stage Holstein Kiel have been rewarded for their penalty shootout win over Darmstadt in the last 16 with a trip to Rot-Weiss Essen, who play in the fourth division. Essen will likely be no pushover however after having knocked out Bayer Leverkusen, Arminia Bielefeld and second division team Fortuna Duesseldorf in previous rounds. Quarter-final draw, matches to be played March 2 and 3: RB Leipzig v Wolfsburg Borussia Moenchengladbach v Borussia Dortmund Jahn Regensburg v Werder Bremen Rot-Weiss Essen v Holstein Kiel"
2,02/02/2021,13:39,Supporters groups dismiss 'dangerous' European Super League plan,"Plans to create a breakaway European Super League for an elite group of the continent's wealthiest clubs have been dismissed as ""unpopular, illegitimate, and dangerous"" by a collective of supporters groups.","""It would destroy the European model of sport, which is based on commonly accepted principles such as sporting merit, promotion and relegation, qualification to European competitions via domestic success, and financial solidarity,"" said a statement released on the initiative of Football Supporters Europe (FSE) and signed by more than 100 groups of supporters of club sides and national teams. ""It would also undermine the economic foundations of European football, concentrating even more wealth and power in the hands of a dozen or so elite clubs,"" the statement added. Among the signatories were Liverpool's Spirit of Shankly Supporters' Union as well as groups from Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid. Documents containing details of the Super League, first reported last month by British newspaper The Times, proposed a 20-club tournament with 15 permanent members, including the English Premier League's 'Big Six', three each from Spain and Italy, two from Germany and one from France. Five other clubs would qualify annually, the report said, but founding members would receive up to 350 million euros ($425m) each just to join the competition. At the same time discussions are still ongoing about the future format of the UEFA Champions League, currently the world's most lucrative and prestigious club competition which is due for reform of some kind from 2024 onwards. ""We recognise that the game is in desperate need of broad reform. ""But proposals to this end must seek to revive the competitive balance in European competitions, protect domestic leagues, promote the interests of fans, and encourage fairer revenue distribution,"" the statement added. ""A European Super League would achieve none of these objectives -- quite the opposite."" Javier Tebas, the president of Spain's La Liga, is one of the leading voices against the project, which he insisted is ""not going to happen"" in an interview with AFP at the weekend. ""The whole system will be against it and it won't just sit on its hands. It's going to fight,"" said Tebas, who also accused FIFA chief Gianni Infantino of supporting the plan, which he says has been driven by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, as well as the American owners of Liverpool, Manchester United and AC Milan."
3,29/01/2021,03:03,Hoffenheim plot new Bayern shock on Munich return,"As the architect of Bayern Munich's single defeat in 2020, Hoffenheim coach Sebastian Hoeness hopes to again down the European champions in the Bundesliga on Saturday when he returns to his former club.","Bayern host mid-table Hoffenheim at the Allianz Arena seeking revenge for September's 4-1 league defeat - their only loss of 2020 in any competition. The shock win over the European champions ""will certainly still be in our heads,"" admitted Hoeness, ""but we want to use this game to annoy Bayern again"". Bayern hold a seven-point lead in the table and are near full-strength with only Corentin Tolisso and Tanguy Nianzou sidelined. After poor results around Christmas, Hoffenheim are back up to 11th thanks to back-to-back 3-0 wins against strugglers Hertha Berlin and Cologne. However, the European champions are a huge test for Hoffenheim on Hoeness' return to Munich, where the 38-year-old coached the reserves last season having previously worked with Bayern's junior teams. A key factor Saturday is the form of Hoffenheim striker Andrej Kramaric, who has scored twice in each of his last two games. Leading the pack chasing Bayern, RB Leipzig host Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday night with both clubs eager to bounce back from defeats. After crashing 3-2 at second-from-bottom Mainz, Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann compared Bayern to Germany's high-speed ICE trains and his team to a regional train, struggling to ""catch up"". In order to get back on track, Leipzig must beat third-placed Leverkusen, who trail them by three points. ""The game has no direct influence on the title race - it's all about qualifying for the Champions League,"" Nagelsmann insisted Thursday. Leipzig welcome back Yussuf Poulsen after a groin injury, but playmaker Emil Forsberg is sidelined by a knee knock. Leverkusen, who crashed at home to Wolfsburg last weekend, are missing midfielders Julian Baumgartlinger, who underwent knee surgery on Monday, and Nadiem Amiri, who is quarantined after testing positive for Covid-19. Having slipped out of the European places to seventh, Dortmund host Augsburg on Saturday chasing a first win in four games. ""We have to correct mistakes from set-pieces,"" said caretaker coach Edin Terzic after Dortmund conceded three goals from deadball situations in a 4-2 defeat at Gladbach. Erling Braut Haaland scored twice in the Gladbach defeat, but Dortmund need him and England winger Jadon Sancho to fire their attack. ""When they (Augsburg) make mistakes, we have to be there - ice-cold,"" added Terzic. Eintracht Frankfurt, who are a point above Dortmund in the table and bouyed by a 5-1 thrashing of Bielefeld, are home on Saturday to Hertha Berlin, where Pal Dardai is back in charge. The 44-year-old replaces Bruno Labbadia, who was sacked following their 4-1 thrashing at home by Werder Bremen. Frankfurt striker Luka Jovic has scored three goals in three appearances off the bench since returning on loan from Real Madrid. Dardai predicts it could be ""5-4 or 6-5"" at Frankfurt, who ""score a lot of goals.... we're going there to score one more"". The Croatia striker scored twice in last September's 4-1 win over Bayern and has also netted two goals in Hoffenheim's recent wins against Hertha and Cologne. He is back in form after contracting Covid-19 on international duty last October which sidelined him for seven games. Kramaric will test Bayern's defence and his four goals in two games, ""speak for themselves,"" said Hoffenheim coach Hoeness. 76 - the minutes Luka Jovic has needed for three goals off the bench having been loaned back to Eintracht Frankfurt after failing to settle at Real. 18 - home league games since Bayern last lost at the Allianz Arena when Leverkusen managed a 2-1 win in November 2019. 1 - the single victory Hoffenheim has managed at the Allianz Arena, poaching a 2-1 win in Munich in October 2019.

4,22/01/2021,22:43,Gladbach end losing streak against Dortmund to climb to fourth,Defender Nico Elvedi netted twice as Moenchengladbach ended their six-year wait to beat Dortmund when their 4-2 home win on Friday lifted the Foals to fourth in the Bundesliga table.,"Two goals by Dortmund striker Erling Braut Haaland were bookended by Elvedi netting from set-pieces in the action-packed opening 32 minutes. Algeria left-back Ramy Bensebaini restored Gladbach's lead early in the second half before substitute Marcus Thuram headed the hosts' fourth. After home wins over league leaders Bayern and second-placed RB Leipzig already this season, Gladbach claimed another big-name Bundesliga scalp. It was also a significant win for their coach Marco Rose, who the German media are tipping to replace caretaker boss Edin Terzic at Dortmund next season. After 12 straight defeats to Dortmund, Gladbach earned their first win over the Black-and-Yellows since April 2016. Since their impressive 3-1 win at RB Leipzig at the start January, Dortmund drop to fifth after failing to win their last three games. In the other direction, Gladbach are up to fourth after taking 13 points from a possible 15 in 2021. They are eight points behind leaders Bayern, who are at bottom side Schalke on Sunday. Breel Embolo came on for Gladbach in the second-half despite police claims, which the Swiss striker denies, that he attended a party in Essen last Saturday that broke Germany's lockdown rules. Dortmund made a lethargic start at Borussia Park and a Gladbach goal inside the opening 60 seconds was ruled out after a lengthy VAR review. However, the hosts took the lead with 11 minutes gone when Lars Stindl's curling free-kick dropped in behind the defence to be headed home by Elvedi. Dortmund roared back with two goals inside six minutes, both created by Sancho for Haaland, who fired home his first from a tight angle on 22 minutes. After Jude Bellingham won the ball back for Dortmund, great footwork by Sancho then again unpicked Gladbach's defence for Haaland to blast his side 2-1 ahead on 28 minutes. However, another Stindl free-kick on 32 minutes could only be parried by Roman Buerki and Elvedi tapped home the rebound from close range to make it 2-2 at the break. Gladbach regained the lead five minutes into the second-half when Bensebaini swung in a shot which curled outside Buerki's grasp. Dortmund conceded their third goal of the night from a set-piece when Thuram headed home a Florian Neuhaus corner 11 minutes from the whistle. It was the France forward's first appearance after suspension for a spitting at an opponent last month."
5,19/01/2021,22:55,Diaby shines to down Dortmund,Moussa Diaby starred with a goal and assist as Bayer Leverkusen went second in the Bundesliga on Tuesday with a 2-1 win over Borussia Dortmund.,"French winger Diaby's early opener was cancelled out by a 67th-minute equaliser from Julian Brandt against his former club. Dortmund were left to regret a host of missed chances when Diaby then set up a superb goal by Leverkusen's 17-year-old midfielder Florian Wirtz for the winner 10 minutes from time. ""The second half was an open exchange of blows but we did well in the end,"" said Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz. The victory was Leverkusen's first in five league games and puts them second on goal difference, level on 32 points with RB Leipzig, who host Union Berlin on Wednesday. Leverkusen are four points behind leaders Bayern Munich, who are away to Augsburg on Wednesday in the Bavarian derby. The away defeat was a fresh blow to Dortmund's title hopes, leaving them seven points adrift of Bayern. ""We are not able to keep up the level needed for 90 minutes,"" complained Brandt. ""A lot can happen in 17 games, but we are far away"" from leaders Bayern in the table. As Dortmund captain Marco Reus put it bluntly, the title race ""did not play a relevant role neither before nor after the game"" for his team. Leverkusen took the lead in the 14th minute when they returned a clearance kick by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki, which was snapped up by Leon Bailey on the halfway line. The Jamaica winger put in a terrific diagonal pass to Diaby who sprinted away from the Dortmund defence and fired past Buerki on 14 minutes. Dortmund equalised midway through the second half when Brandt hit the far bottom corner from 25 yards out. He then squandered another chance moments later. England winger Jadon Sancho also fired wide as both sides had a string of chances. Diaby then did brilliantly to put Wirtz in enough space to steer the winner past Buerki. Wolfsburg are fifth, level with Dortmund on 29 points, after a 2-0 win at Mainz thanks to goals by Polish midfielder Bartosz Bialek and Dutch striker Wout Weghorst. Hertha Berlin have not scored in their last three matches as Hoffenheim earned their first victory in four games this year with a 3-0 win in the capital. Hertha's Polish striker Krzysztof Piatek had his early penalty attempt saved superbly by visiting goalkeeper Oliver Baumann. Sebastian Rudy put Hoffenheim ahead with half an hour played, then Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric added two second-half goals. Earlier, Borussia Moenchengladbach climbed to seventh with a 1-0 home win over Werder Bremen thanks to Nico Elvedi's second-half header. Gladbach dropped Swiss striker Breel Embolo for what head coach Marco Rose described as a ""senseless"" breach of the Bundesliga's hygiene rules. Embolo, 23, was dropped amid allegations he turned up at a private party, reportedly attended by 23 people, on Saturday. The event at a restaurant in Essen was broken up by police with Germany currently in lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. Embolo insists he was instead at a friend's house watching basketball, but his behaviour still violates the league's hygiene rules as players are not allowed to meet people outside their team's bubble during the pandemic. Embolo must now submit two negative tests for Covid-19 before he can train again with the Gladbach squad."
6,13/01/2021,17:31,Lewandowski credits Klopp's role in making him a top striker,Robert Lewandowski has opened up about the role Jurgen Klopp played in his career as the Bayern Munich striker continues to bang in the goals this season for the European champions.,"Lewandowski was voted FIFA's best male player last month, while Klopp won the men's coach award for the second year running after ending Liverpool's 30-year wait to be crowned English league champions in 2019/20. Last season, Lewandowski, 32, helped Bayern sweep the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup titles - finishing as top-scorer in each - with a total of 55 goals from 47 matches in all competitions. The Poland striker has already netted 20 Bundesliga goals this season and in a piece written for The Player's Tribune, Lewandowski puts his success down to Klopp, 53, when he coached him at Borussia Dortmund. ""Jurgen was not only a father figure to me,"" wrote Lewandowski. ""As a coach, he was like the 'bad' teacher, the one who was strict with you. The one who put pressure on you and did everything to get the best out of you."" Klopp plucked Lewandowski from the Polish league as a raw talent in 2010, becoming one of Europe's best strikers by the time he signed for Bayern in 2014, while Klopp left Dortmund the year after to coach Liverpool. ""He was not content to let you be a B student, you know? Jurgen wanted A+ students. He didn't want it for him. He wanted it for you,"" wrote Lewandowski. He has scored 256 goals in the Bundesliga for Bayern and Dortmund, making him the league's top-scoring foreigner. He could soon eclipse Klaus Fischer's tally of 263 goals to become the league's second highest goal-scorer behind only Bayern legend Gerd Mueller. 'The Bomber, as Mueller was known, bagged 365 goals in Germany's top-flight, including 40 in the 1971/72 season, a record which still stands. Lewandowski says apart from Klopp, Bayern's former coaches Jupp Heynckes, Pep Guardiola, Carlo Ancelotti and current boss Hansi Flick also helped him improve. ""Just playing for Bayern is an educational experience really, because the demands are so high, and the club culture is so professional -- you are forced to raise your standards."""
7,10/01/2021,16:57,Dortmund star Witsel faces months out with torn Achilles tendon,"Borussia Dortmund confirmed Sunday that their Belgium midfielder Axel Witsel faces ""months"" on the sidelines with a torn Achilles tendon which threatens to end his season.","The Belgium defensive midfielder had to be helped off in Saturday's 3-1 win at RB Leipzig as Erling Braut Haaland scored twice and England winger Jadon Sancho claimed his second goal in as many Bundesliga games. The win came at a cost as Dortmund say a scan confirmed Witsel, 31, tore his Achilles and will be out ""for the coming months"". The German club made no mention whether Witsel could be fit to play for Belgium at the European championships, which are due to start on June 11. With Dortmund fourth in the Bundesliga table, five points behind Bayern Munich, Witsel's injury is a blow after he started 18 of their 24 games in all competitions this season. Dortmund are through to the knock-out stages of the Champions League and Witsel misses their last 16, first leg clash away to Sevilla on February 17 with the return leg on March 9."
8,09/01/2021,20:33,Haaland hits double as Leipzig miss out on top spot,"Erling Braut Haaland netted twice on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund won 3-1 at RB Leipzig, who missed the chance to take top spot in the Bundesliga from Bayern Munich.","Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho scored his second goal in as many weeks by firing home on 55 minutes after Haaland's cross was deftly flicked into his path by captain Marco Reus. Haaland headed home a Sancho cross with 19 minutes remaining and grabbed his second goal in the 84th minute, before Alexander Sorloth scored a late consolation for Leipzig. The result means Bayern stay two points clear of second-placed Leipzig despite crashing to a 3-2 defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday, while Dortmund are five points behind the European champions in fourth."
9,08/01/2021,02:45,Dortmund hunt win at high-fliers Leipzig to rejoin title race,Borussia Dortmund are hunting a win at second-placed RB Leipzig on Saturday to get back in the Bundesliga title race while elsewhere two German league records could be equalled this weekend.,"At the top of the table, Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick can claim 100 league points in his first 39 games if the league leaders win at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday. Pep Guardiola is the only other Bundesliga coach to have reached the milestone in the same number of games after taking charge of Bayern in 2013. At the other end of the table, bottom side Schalke could equal the league record of 31 games without victory if they lose or draw at home to Hoffenheim. In Saturday night's top match, Dortmund head to Leipzig in the ""role of the hunter"", according to sports director Michael Zorc, chasing an away win to trim the eight-point gap behind leaders Bayern. A late Jadon Sancho goal sealed their 2-0 win at home to Wolfsburg last Sunday, but Dortmund are fourth after defeats to Stuttgart and Union Berlin in December dented their title hopes. Dortmund must break their habit of conceding goals at set pieces which has drawn fierce internal criticism. ""Too often we haven't played grown-up football and our style was bound to see us drop points,"" Dortmund defender Mats Hummels fumed in Sport Bild, harsh criticism caretaker coach Edin Terzic regards as ""legitimate and productive"". Up front, Dortmund striker Erling Braut Haaland needs to finish his chances after the 20-year-old fired a blank last Sunday on his return after a hip injury. Haaland's 16-year-old understudy Youssoufa Moukoko is struggling with a knee injury. Dortmund have lost five of their 14 games this season and Terzic can ill-afford to lose at Leipzig, 10 days before facing third-placed Bayer Leverkusen. ""The whole of January will set the tone for the rest of the Bundesliga season,"" Terzic admits. Leipzig are on a nine-match unbeaten run in the Bundesliga, including a thrilling 3-3 draw at Bayern last month, and their defence has only conceded nine league goals all season. Their head coach Julian Nagelsmann is ""already planning"" the club's first win over Dortmund since 2017, ""because we're brave enough, in a very good mood"" and have home advantage. Nagelsmann is missing several players as Christopher Nkunku aggravated an ankle injury in training, while new signing Dominik Szoboszlai is struggling with a groin problem. The Liverpool loanee has scored five goals in his last seven league games which has helped Union Berlin climb to fifth ahead of Saturday's home game against Wolfsburg. With Germany striker Max Kruse recovering from a knee injury, burly 23-year-old Awoniyi spearheaded Union's attack by setting up team-mate Sheraldo Becker before tapping home to seal a 2-0 win at Werder Bremen last Saturday. The Nigerian international is making an impact at Union after seven loan moves in three different countries since joining Liverpool in 2015 after winning the African Under-20 Championships. 19 - the league goals scored by Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski, who netted twice against Mainz last Sunday. Haaland is his nearest rival on 10 goals. 97 - the league points Flick has accumulated as Bayern Munich head coach in his first 38 games with 31 wins, four draws and three defeats since taking charge in November 2019. 31 - Jadon Sancho's goal against Wolfsburg was his 31st in the Bundeliga. The England winger turns 21 in March and no-one else has scored so many German league goals at such a young age. Fixtures (all times 1430GMT unless stated)"
10,04/01/2021,14:13,Dortmund urge Haaland to follow 'world-class' Lewandowski's example,"Erling Braut Haaland has been urged by Borussia Dortmund's boss to copy the example of Robert Lewandowski, who developed into a world-class striker during his four years at the Bundesliga club.","""Erling, and also his agent Mino Raiola, know what they have in us. I can only advise him to do as Robert Lewandowski did,"" Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke told Monday's edition of Kicker magazine. Dortmund plucked Lewandowski from the Polish league as a raw talent in 2010 and, as Watzke said, gave ""himself the time to mature into a world-class striker at Dortmund"" before joining Bayern Munich in 2014. Lewandowski, 32, helped Bayern win the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup last season, top-scoring in all three competitions, netting 55 goals in the process. He has already netted 22 goals this season, including two in the 5-2 thrashing of Mainz on Saturday, making him the Bundesliga's top-scorer so far in 2020/21 with 19 goals. Haaland, 20, is rapidly following in Lewandowski's footsteps. He has attracted the attention of Europe's top clubs by scoring 33 goals in as many games for Dortmund since his 20-million-euro ($24.6 million) transfer a year ago from Red Bull Salzburg. Haaland, now recovered from a hip injury that sidelined him for seven games, was booked for reacting in frustration after wasting several clear chances in Sunday's 2-0 win at home to Wolfsburg. The tall Norwegian looked short of match fitness before Jadon Sancho ended his goal drought in the league this season after Manuel Akanji's opening header. Haaland reportedly has a 75-million-euro release clause in his Dortmund contract, which expires in 2024, but Watzke says he ""doesn't believe"" the striker will leave at the end of the season. Watzke said he has urged Haaland to develop his game to earn the consistency expected of a world-class player like Lewandowski. ""You don't manage that in one year. Because it's clear that if Erling were to leave us at some point, he would only go to an even bigger club,"" said Watzke. ""And there aren't that many who fit the bill. ""If you go to a club like, just to give an example, Real Madrid, you have to be world class."""
11,03/01/2021,17:52,Sancho ends goal drought,England winger Jadon Sancho scored his first Bundesliga goal this season to seal a 2-0 win for Borussia Dortmund at home against Wolfsburg on Sunday to breathe life back into his side's fading title hopes.,"After crashing to a shock 2-1 defeat at Union Berlin a fortnight ago before the league's two-week winter hiatus, Dortmund saw off a spirited Wolfsburg side who created plenty of chances for Dutch striker Wout Weghorst. Dortmund finally broke the deadlock at Signal Iduna Park when Manuel Akanji's powerful header hit the net on 66 minutes before Sancho broke clear to score their second in added time. Having occasionally struggled this season, the 20-year-old Sancho capped a fine display having also provided the corner from which Akanji scored. ""It wasn't an easy win, but we stayed calm and I'm pleased that Sancho put in such a good corner and the ball went in,"" goal-scorer Akanji told Sky. Dortmund move up to fourth, six points behind leaders RB Leipzig, who went top of the league table after Saturday's 1-0 win at Stuttgart thanks to Dani Olmo's winning goal. European champions Bayern Munich can later restore their two-point lead with a home win against strugglers Mainz. Having missed the previous seven games, Dortmund striker Erling Braut Haaland returned from a hip injury and although short of match fitness, he went close with several chances before coming off with ten minutes left. In the goalless first-half, Wolfsburg were unlucky not to be awarded a penalty after the ball struck the hand of Dortmund midfielder Axel Witsel, but the VAR refused to award a spot kick after a lengthy review. Dortmund finally broke the deadlock 24 minutes from time when Akanji out-leapt the defence to power Sancho's corner past Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels. Having been booked on 80 minutes for kicking the ball away in frustration after a missed chance, Haaland was subbed off shortly after. His replacement Steffen Tigges came within a whisker of claiming Dortmund's second goal when he fired across the Wolfsburg goal. With Wolfsburg pushing hard for the equaliser, Dortmund counter-attacked from their own goalmouth as Sancho broke clear and fired past Casteels in the 91st minute."
12,01/01/2021,03:00,Haaland back in action as Bundesliga returns from mini-break,Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Braut Haaland is expected to make an eagerly awaited return from injury as his side look to battle back into the Bundesliga top four with a win over high-fliers Wolfsburg on Sunday.,"The prolific Norwegian prodigy has missed the last four league games and the last seven in all competitions after picking up a hamstring injury in early December. Yet the 20-year-old returned to team training this week, and Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc confirmed that he would be back in action this weekend. ""Erling's recovery has gone well. We are working on the assumption that he can play against Wolfsburg,"" said Zorc. Haaland's return is timely, with his side in desperate need of a win after a miserable run of form before Christmas saw them drop to fifth in the table, eight points behind leaders Bayern Munich and two behind Sunday's opponents Wolfsburg. Dortmund sacked coach Lucien Favre after they were thrashed by promoted side Stuttgart in mid-December, before suffering a shock away defeat to minnows Union Berlin in their second game under caretaker boss Edin Terzic. Defeat to Wolfsburg would see Dortmund lose four home league games in a row for the first time in 20 years. ""The most important thing is that we start well and end well,"" said Haaland, who has scored 17 goals in 14 games in all competitions this season. In a season squashed by the coronavirus pandemic, many Bundesliga clubs have had just a week off in the shortest winter break in the league's history. Yet after their pre-Christmas cup tie was postponed until January, champions Bayern have had an extra week to recover and are expected to waltz past struggling Mainz on Sunday and defend their two-point lead at the top of the table. Second from bottom and without a win in six games, Mainz parted ways with both their coach and sporting director over Christmas. Huddersfield boss Jan Siewert will take the reins as interim coach against Bayern. There has also been a changing of the guard at bottom club Schalke, where new coach Christian Gross will take charge of his first game away to Hertha Berlin on Saturday. Former Tottenham and Stuttgart coach Gross has been charged with leading Schalke out of danger and ending their miserable winless streak of 29 games. Having not won since last January, the seven-time German champions are now just two games away from equalling Tasmania Berlin's unwanted record of 31 games without a win, set back in 1966. Fresh from his coronation as the world's best goalkeeper, the Bayern stopper is just one game away from equalling Oliver Kahn's club record of 196 Bundesliga clean sheets, a milestone he has been chasing in vain for more than two months. If he fails again to reach Kahn's mark against Mainz, Neuer will have gone nine league games without a clean sheet for only the second time in his Bayern career. 150 - RB Leipzig will celebrate their 150th Bundesliga game when they take on Stuttgart on Saturday. They have won 80 of them so far, more than any other German club at the same milestone. 50 - Weeks since Schalke's last Bundesliga win in January last year. The league's bottom club are just two games away from equalling Tasmania Berlin's unwanted record of 31 games without a win. 10 - Goals Erling Braut Haaland has scored in his eight league games for Borussia Dortmund this season. The Norwegian is set to make his first appearance in a month against Wolfsburg. Fixtures (all times 1430 GMT unless stated)"
13,31/12/2020,02:30,Reyna leads charge of Bundesliga's rising teen stars,The Bundesliga returns this weekend after a two-week break with Borussia Dortmund's American midfielder Giovanni Reyna leading a crop of talented teenagers rapidly becoming household names.,"Reyna, who marked his 18th birthday in November by extending his contract until 2025, scored his first Bundesliga goal on the opening day of this season. He has featured in all of Dortmund's Bundesliga and Champions League games in 2020/21, scoring three league goals - including the equaliser in a 1-1 draw at Frankfurt - and producing six assists. Reyna, an attacking midfielder who can play on either wing, needs a strong performance at home to Wolfsburg on Sunday after Dortmund's shock 2-1 defeat to Union Berlin a fortnight ago. The result left Dortmund fifth in the league, eight points behind leaders Bayern Munich, who host Mainz on Sunday. Against Wolfsburg, Dortmund could welcome back striker Erling Braut Haaland, who scored ten Bundesliga goals in eight games before being sidelined by a hip injury. Having forced his way into the Dortmund first-team, Reyna now wants to emulate Haaland and England winger Jadon Sancho, both 20, by deciding games. ""You see guys like Sancho and Haaland - I want to be at their level,"" Reyna told The Players' Tribune. ""I know I can make that jump this season. I've come out of my shell. I now demand the ball."" The son of former USA captain Claudio Reyna, he joined Dortmund from New York City FC in July 2019. Shortly after his 17th birthday last January, Reyna made his Dortmund debut, then bagged his first senior goal in February with a jaw-dropping strike in a German Cup game at Bremen. He marked his Champions League debut the same month with a brilliant pass to set up Haaland for the winning goal in the last 16, first-leg victory over Paris Saint Germain. However, Reyna's raw talent needs polishing. His defensive work was exposed when Union's Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi got in front of him to head home. Dortmund fielded a youthful side in Berlin where Haaland's understudy Youssoufa Moukoko became the league's youngest goal-scorer at 16 years, 28 days. Down in Bavaria, European champions Bayern Munich are also giving youth a chance. Before this season, double Champions League winners Thomas Mueller and David Alaba, who graduated from Bayern's academy more than a decade ago, were the last first-team players to come up through the club's youth structure. That has all changed with 17-year-olds Jamal Musiala and Bright Arrey-Mbi, plus Angelo Stiller, 19, given game time this season for the European champions by Hansi Flick. As Alphonso Davies proved last season in making the left-back berth his own as a then 19-year-old, Flick cares more about talent than age. ""Finally, we once again have a few players on our (academy) campus who are breaking through,"" said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Of Bayern's trio of teens, Musiala has made the biggest impact. The attacking midfielder, who can also play on the left, became the club's youngest goal-scorer during the 8-0 demolition of Schalke on the opening day of this season. Born in Stuttgart - his mother is German - Musiala moved to London as a child and rose through Chelsea's academy before joining Bayern's youth structure last year. Shortly after earning his first England Under-21 cap in November, Musiala then came off Bayern's bench and scored with a superb strike in the 3-3 draw against RB Leipzig. ""We're very happy about Musiala's development, he's very calm on the ball and the football world can look forward to what will come of this young talent,"" Flick said recently. Musiala also hit the post in Bayern's 2-1 win at Bayer Leverkusen which put them top a week before Christmas. His obvious talent has drawn the attention of Germany team director Oliver Bierhoff, who hopes to persuade Musiala to play for the country of his birth rather than England. ""We're watching him, because of his German FA past and his current performances,"" Bierhoff recently said of Muisala, a rarity having played for Germany Under-16s as well as England's juniors."
14,18/12/2020,23:11,Moukoko becomes youngest Bundesliga scorer as Dortmund flop at Union,Borussia Dortmund's Bundesliga title aspirations suffered a fresh dent on Friday as they crashed to a 2-1 defeat at Union Berlin on the night their striker Youssoufa Moukoko became the league's youngest ever goalscorer.,"After Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi headed Union into the lead early in the second half, Moukoko leapt into the air to celebrate making history when he equalised for Dortmund aged just 16 years and 28 days. Moukoko broke the previous record of Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz, who was 17 years, 34 days when he scored against Bayern Munich in June. However, Moukoko's delight was short-lived as Dortmund again conceded from a set-piece with Union centre-back Marvin Friedrich heading the winner from a corner with 12 minutes left. ""We have now lost two league games through set-pieces -- that's a disaster,"" Dortmund defender Mats Hummels fumed to DAZN, also referring to November's 2-1 shock home defeat to Cologne. ""We're simply beating ourselves up, that can't be allowed to happen."" Saturday's 5-1 thrashing at home to Stuttgart cost head coach Lucien Favre his job, but Dortmund's defensive woes were exposed again by Union, who also beat them 3-1 in eastern Berlin last season. Despite bouncing back in mid-week with a 2-1 win at Werder Bremen under caretaker coach Edin Terzic, Dortmund were again punished for yielding possession easily and sloppy defending. This is Dortmund's fifth defeat this season, leaving them fourth in the table, six points behind Leverkusen who host Bayern Munich in Saturday's top-of-the-table clash. Union, who held European champions Bayern to a 1-1 draw in their previous home game, climb to fifth, just a point behind Dortmund. They deservedly took the lead behind closed doors when Awoniyi slipped his marker Giovanni Reyna and headed past Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki on 57 minutes. ""The fact that an opposing striker was so free is unforgivable,"" Hummels complained after the final whistle. Having previously hit the Union woodwork, Moukoko made history three minutes later when he stabbed home the equaliser, but Friedrich was left alone in the area to head the winning goal in off the post. ""It's great that we win the game through two set-pieces,"" Union captain Christopher Trimmel told ZDF. ""There was a lot of passion, no opponent has it easy against us."" The Bundesliga starts a two-week winter break after this weekend and Dortmund have a tough month ahead in January when they face RB Leipzig, Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Moenchengladbach. However, Moukoko clearly has a bright future after now claiming three records in the last month. ""You have to congratulate the young 16-year-old on his Bundesliga goal, that's something very special,"" Trimmel added graciously. Moukoko also became the Champions League's youngest player ten days ago, coming off the bench in the win at Zenit St Petersburg with Dortmund through to the last 16 where they face Sevilla. He also became the youngest player in Bundesliga history on November 21 -- the day after his 16th birthday."
15,14/12/2020,03:30,Dortmund out to reverse slump after Favre dismissal,"New Borussia Dortmund boss Edin Terzic will make his debut in the dugout when his team travel to Werder Bremen on Tuesday, with the crisis-hit Bundesliga giants looking to pick up their first win in four league games.","After former coach Lucien Favre was sacked on Sunday, Dortmund are looking to bounce back from a humiliating 5-1 defeat to Stuttgart which saw them drop out of the top four and cost the Swiss coach his job. Former Favre assistant Terzic will now take the reins as interim boss until the end of the season, starting with the trip to Bremen. Dortmund have not lost a league game in Bremen since 2014, yet they travel north with just one point from their last three matches and several players out injured including Belgians Thomas Meunier and Thorgan Hazard and star striker Erling Braut Haaland. Terzic is charged with leading Dortmund back into the top four after recent results saw them fall behind the leading pack of Bayer Leverkusen, Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig. ""We can't afford another performance like that,"" said captain Marco Reus after the defeat to Stuttgart. ""We need to make a statement in Bremen."" Leaders Leverkusen, who leapfrogged Bayern with a 4-1 win over Hoffenheim to go top for the first time in six years on Sunday, face local rivals Cologne on Wednesday. Peter Bosz's side have now won three games in a row and are unbeaten this season, but the Dutch coach warned against complacency on Sunday. ""We're top after 11 games. If we are top after 34 games then I will be delighted, but we're not there yet,"" said Bosz. Bayern, who sit just a point behind Leverkusen in second, host the league's only other unbeaten side Wolfsburg on Wednesday. The injury-plagued champions may be without Leon Goretzka, who hobbled off the pitch during a 1-1 draw with Union Berlin on Saturday, but are hoping that defender Niklas Suele will return to the fold. ""Niklas had a painful blow to his thigh, but we are hoping he will be back in action on Wednesday,"" said coach Hansi Flick after Suele missed Saturday's game. Wednesday's game could see Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski, the league's top goalscorer so far this season, chalk up his 250th career goal in the Bundesliga. The Polish star has 249 goals in 331 Bundesliga appearances for Bayern and Dortmund, and is fast approaching the all-time league record of 268 goals held by former Schalke striker Klaus Fischer. The Jamaica winger is in blistering form this season and fired Bayer Leverkusen to the top of the table with two goals in a 4-1 win over Hoffenheim on Sunday. Bailey opened the scoring with a scintillating strike against Hoffenheim before adding another later on to take his season tally to nine goals and six assists in all competitions. The 23-year-old also picked up an assist the last time Leverkusen met Cologne, setting up Sven Bender's opener in a 3-1 win back in June. 249 - Bundesliga goals Robert Lewandowski has scored in 331 appearances for Bayern and Dortmund. The Polish striker would become only the third Bundesliga player to reach the 250 mark if he scores against Wolfsburg. 27 - Games Schalke have now played since their last league win back in January. The league's bottom side are now just four games away from equalling the longest winless streak in Bundesliga history. 4 - Goals Congolese striker Silas Wamangituka has scored in his last two games for seventh-placed Stuttgart, who take on fellow high-fliers Union Berlin on Tuesday."
16,13/12/2020,15:38,Borussia Dortmund sack Favre after worst rout in a decade: club,"Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund said Sunday they have fired head coach Lucien Favre, a day after the team suffered their heaviest home defeat in over a decade.","Swiss coach Favre is to be replaced by his assistant-coach Edin Terzic after Dortmund crashed 5-1 to VfB Stuttgart leaving them fifth in the league five points behind leaders Bayern Munich. ""It is very difficult for us to take this step, but we believe that the current negative development has put our season goals in danger, and we have to take action,"" said Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc. Favre himself had branded ""a disaster"" Saturday's showing, which was the squad's heaviest home defeat since being humbled 5-1 at home to Bayern Munich in 2009. Dortmund have taken just a point in their two league games since star striker Erling Braut Haaland was ruled out until January with a hip injury. Since taking the reins at Dortmund in 2018, Favre has twice led the club to second place in the Bundesliga, but has often been criticised for not managing to launch a serious title challenge. ""We are all grateful to Lucien Favre for his fantastic work in the last two and a half years,"" said club CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. The club confirmed that Favre's assistant Edin Terzic would take the reins ""until the end of the season"", beginning with Dortmund's trip to Werder Bremen on Tuesday. Terzic, 38, previously worked in Dortmund's youth system and was part of Croatian coach Slaven Bilic's staff at both Besiktas and West Ham United."

""Things went mercilessly wrong,"" admitted Dortmund defender Mats Hummels. ""We shot ourselves in the foot every few minutes."" Dortmund have taken just a point in their two league games since star striker Erling Braut Haaland was ruled out until January with a hip injury. Stuttgart's relentless pressing and sloppy Dortmund defending resulted in the visitors scoring four unanswered second-half goals. ""We are not a team that can defend well, that has to be said quite clearly,"" fumed Dortmund captain Marco Reus, while Favre admitted it was ""a disaster"". Wamangituka converted a penalty midway through the first half after Dortmund's Emre Can brought down Mateo Klimowicz. Dortmund equalised just before the break when a superb Raphael Guerreiro long ball picked out Giovanni Reyna, who deftly chipped home. It was 1-1 at the break, but the floodgates opened in the second period as nearly every Dortmund mistake was punished with a Stuttgart goal. Guerreiro lost control of the ball on the edge of his penalty area and Wamangituka claimed his second goal eight minutes after the break. Midfielder Philip Foerster, in for suspended Stuttgart captain Gonzalo Castro, scored with a perfectly timed run into the area with an hour played. Jude Belligham's stray pass was then snapped up by Wamangituka and moved to striker Tanguy Coulibaly, who fired home on 63 minutes. The VAR ruled out a second Reyna goal late on before a mistake by Dortmund's Nico Schulz saw Nicolas Gonzalez claim Stuttgart's fifth goal. The debacle is Dortmund's heaviest home defeat since being humbled 5-1 at home to Bayern Munich in 2009. Fresh from knocking Manchester United out of the Champions League in midweek, RB Leipzig saw off Werder Bremen 2-0 to leapfrog Bayern into top spot in the table. Leipzig captain Marcel Sabitzer converted a penalty and Dani Olmo, who shone in the attacking midfield role, grabbed a first-half goal for the hosts. The victory left Leipzig a point clear of defending champions Bayern, who can regain first place at FC Union later in Berlin. The home win capped a good week for Leipzig, who knocked United out of Europe on Tuesday with a 3-2 victory to reach the last 16 of the Champions League. Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi scored his first goal for Hertha Berlin in their 1-1 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Guendouzi scored just after the break when Gladbach's Denis Zakaria lost possession on the edge of his area. Gladbach, who also reached the last 16 of the Champions League in midweek, fought their way back and equalised through Breel Embolo on 70 minutes. Freiburg ended their nine-match winless run with a 2-0 win over Arminia Bielefeld. Nils Petersen hit the woodwork twice before Vincenzo Grifo converted a late penalty. Then South Korean midfielder Jeong Woo-yeong, on loan from Bayern Munich, scored in added time. Cologne stay just above the relegation places after their 1-0 win at second-from-bottom Mainz."

""That's why we have agreed to the request."" Germany ordered a new round of shutdowns in November and the daily rate of new infections of the coronavirus has been around 20,000 for weeks.

""The news about Mats is good, we will have to see whether he can play,"" Favre said after the 2014 World Cup winner needed to be helped off in Wednesday's 1-1 home draw against Lazio in the Champions League. They want to bounce back with a first win at mid-table Frankfurt since 2013. Favre confirmed striker Erling Braut Haaland will not play again this year after tearing a leg muscle. The 20-year-old had posted on Instagram he had ""good news. I have spoken to my doctor and will be back soon"" but Favre put the brakes on hopes of a quick return. ""He is definitely out until January - which is what the doc said,"" Favre confirmed. Favre left open who will replace Haaland up front against Frankfurt after captain Marco Reus slotted in against Lazio. Youssoufa Moukoko - who last month became the youngest player in Bundesliga history aged 16 years, one day - could make his first start. However, ""we shouldn't forget that he is only just 16 - he is good, but we have other options,"" Favre added. The Swiss boss said Dortmund will be without defender Thomas Meunier and defensive midfielder Thomas Delaney who are both carrying injuries.

However, Dortmund coach Lucien Favre has confirmed the Norway striker ""won't play again until January"" with a torn leg muscle. ""That hurts us, but perhaps he has played a little too much recently,"" Favre added. Haaland missed Wednesday's 1-1 draw at home to Lazio which put Dortmund through to the last 16 of the Champions League. On Thursday, Haaland posted ""great news! Spoke to my doctor and will be back soon"" without giving details. A win at Zenit St Petersburg on Tuesday will confirm Dortmund as Group F winners. Hummels had to be helped off the pitch in clear distress after Lazio goal-scorer Ciro Immobile trod on his ankle late in Wednesday's game. However Dortmund's centre-back said the problem is not serious as first feared. ""I'm just back from hospital. It looks like it's not so bad and could be good again in a few days,"" Hummels posted on Instagram. Dortmund, who are fourth in the Bundesliga, currently have plenty of walking wounded as England midfielder Jude Bellingham, 17, limped off after the Lazio game.

26,02/12/2020,23:24,Dortmund through to last 16 with Lazio draw,Borussia Dortmund reached the last 16 of the Champions League on Wednesday despite Lazio captain Ciro Immobile scoring a second-half penalty against his former club in a 1-1 draw in Germany.,"The result at Signal Iduna Park means leaders Dortmund need a win at Zenit St Petersburg next Tuesday to be sure of progressing as Group F winners. Lazio, who are second and a point behind the Germans, will also go through if they draw at home to Club Brugge the same night. ""We wouldn't have deserved to lose after what we showed in the second half,"" Immobile told Sky. The Italy forward, who failed to make his mark in the Bundesliga after an unhappy 2014/15 season at Dortmund, converted a dubious 67th-minute penalty to cancel out Raphael Guerreiro's goal just before half-time. ""Reaching the round of 16 would be great, we're a step away from something Lazio haven't managed in 20 years,"" said Lazio coach Simone Inzaghi. The draw could have come at a cost for Dortmund as defender Mats Hummels had to be helped off after Immobile trod on his ankle in the dying stages. ""He was in a lot of pain, but he's a strong lad,"" Dortmund captain Marco Reus told Sky. ""I hope he didn't go over on his ankle too badly and can still play on Saturday"" away to Frankfurt in the Bundesliga. Reus said Dortmund ""were too flat in the second half and had too little pressure going forward"". ""It's disappointing to concede in the manner that we did, but we can't have too many complaints with the result,"" Reus added. Even though their star striker Erling Braut Haaland dropped out just before kick-off, Dortmund did enough to reach the knockout stages. Haaland, the top scorer in the Champions League this season with six goals in four games, was sidelined by a leg injury. Dortmund have not said how long he will be out for. ""That really hurts us,"" admitted sports director Michael Zorc. In Haaland's absence, Reus moved further up front and Dortmund deservedly went ahead just before the break. Lazio's veteran goalkeeper Pepe Reina, 38, played out a weak clearance which was snapped up by Dortmund midfielder Thomas Delaney. The Dane moved the ball quickly to Guerreiro, who passed off to teenager Giovanni Reyna and sprinted into the area onto Thorgan Hazard's final pass, which he fired past Reina a minute before half-time. However, Immobile was a constant menace for Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki, who palmed away a fierce shot with an hour gone. Guerreiro made way for Nico Schulz as Dortmund head coach Lucien Favre strengthed his defence, but the substitution soon had repercussions. Schulz had only been on three minutes when he lunged into a clearance in the area and only made contact with Lazio midfielder Sergej Milinkovic-Savic after playing the ball. Nevertheless, Lazio were awarded a penalty which Immobile duly converted. Lazio finished the stronger and only a superb diving save by Burki just before the final whistle pushed Immobile's well-struck effort around the post. Immobile collided with Hummels late on and the 2014 World Cup winner needed assistance in leaving the pitch."
27,01/12/2020,14:08,"Dortmund wait on Can, Meunier out",Borussia Dortmund are without right-back Thomas Meunier for Wednesday's crunch Champions League tie at home to Lazio while a question mark hangs over the fitness of midfielder Emre Can.,"Dortmund top their group, a point ahead of second-placed Lazio, and victory at Signal Iduna Park would guarantee either club a place in the last 16. A draw would also put both clubs through, provided Brugge fail to beat Zenit St Petersburg in the other Group F tie. Since joining from Paris Saint-Germain in July, Meunier, 29, had started all of Dortmund's matches this season, but the Belgium international misses out this time with a calf injury. Dortmund coach Lucien Favre said Tuesday that Portugal winger Raphael Guerreiro should be fit after shaking off a leg knock. However, defensive midfielder Can suffered an ankle injury in Saturday's 2-1 shock defeat to Cologne, ""so we will have to see,"" Favre added. The Germans crashed 3-1 in Rome when the clubs met in October as Lazio striker Ciro Immobile scored and set up another goal for midfielder Jean-Daniel Akpa Akpro against his former club. ""We have corrected a few things really well since then, that game is behind us,"" said Favre. ""We are group leaders and we want to keep it that way,"" he added."
28,01/12/2020,03:15,Immobile tackles past demons on Dortmund return,Ciro Immobile returns to the scene of one of his unhappiest spells as a player when Lazio take on the goal ace's former club Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Wednesday.,"Dortmund were Italy forward Immobile's first club outside of his home country and that disappointing time in the Bundesliga was followed by an similarly unsuccessful six months at Sevilla, before returning to Serie A. Lazio are just one point behind their German hosts who lead Group F with two games to play, and four ahead of third-placed Club Brugge. The Italians are well-positioned to advance to the last 16 in their return to the Champions League after a 13-year absence. Last season's European 'Golden Shoe' winner thanks to his 36 league goals in Italy, Immobile's strikes powered Lazio to a fourth-place finish in Serie A. This campaign he has scored three Champions League goals in two games -- one in a 3-1 win over Dortmund in Rome and twice against Zenit with the same scoreline last time out in the Stadio Olimpico. In between, Immobile missed two games, both 1-1 draws, against Club Brugge and away at Zenit, because of positive coronavirus tests. ""He is important for our football,"" said coach Simone Inzaghi. ""He'll make the fortunes of Lazio, and also those of Italy."" In total, Immobile has seven Champions League goals from 12 appearances between Lazio, Dortmund, Sevilla and Juventus. He was also top scorer in the Europa League in 2017-2018. But despite his record performances with Lazio, the player known as 'King Ciro' to fans, has been criticised for his failure to perform well outside of Italy. An 18 million euro ($22 million) move to Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund in 2014 reaped just three goals in 24 appearances, before a transfer after just one season to Sevilla, who loaned him to Torino. ""I arrived at Dortmund at the wrong time, during a generational change,"" said Immobile. ""There were some difficulties, but I don't want to say anything about this. I know when I deserve praise or criticism."" He returned to Lazio in 2016 for less than 10 million euros, the same year former 'Biancocelesti' forward Inzaghi took over as coach. And the 30-year-old has flourished in a system tailor-made to his strengths, alongside Luis Alberto and Joaquin Correa, and midfielders Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Marco Parolo. Immobile extended his contract with Lazio by two years through 2025, after last season matching Gonzalo Higuain's single-season Italian league record of 36 goals. Immobile also led the Serie A scorers in 2013-14 with 22 goals for Torino and with Lazio in 2017-18 with 29. This season he has scored eight goals in nine games in all competitions. Lazio are ninth in Serie A. If he continues his current pace, the player from Naples is on track to become Lazio's all-time leading scorer. With 133 goals across all competitions, he currently sits second on the Roman club's scoring chart behind Silvio Piola's 159 goals. He has 108 league goals for Lazio to Piola's 143 between 1934 and 1943. The arrival of five-time Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo's at Juventus in 2018, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic joining AC Milan this year has provided a boost. ""Ronaldo's arrival in Italy was an extra stimulus for me,"" said Immobile who scored five more goals that the Portuguese star last season. ""When these great champions arrive, they push you to give more, to understand if you too you can be at that level. ""It happened with Ibra too, I studied him because he is a great champion. I hope to still be like this when I'm Ibra's age."""

Brazil winger Douglas Costa, a second-half replacement for Coman, grabbed Bayern's third goal late on to seal the win which leaves the holders two points clear of RB Leipzig. Dortmund are third, four points behind Bayern, after crashing to a shock 2-1 defeat at home to Cologne, as Leipzig climbed above them thanks to a 2-1 home win over Arminia Bielefeld.

""Every minute, he shows that he wants to be successful."" The 20-year-old showcased his lethal finishing with two goals in Tuesday's 3-0 win over Brugge. He has hit 17 goals in 13 games for Dortmund this season, including netting 10 times in seven Bundesliga games, and continues to shine in the Champions League. He is the first to score 16 goals in his opening 12 European games, breaking the record held by Ruud van Nistelrooy and Roberto Soldado, who both needed 19 games to reach the 15-goal milestone. Having scored eight times in six group stage games for Red Bull Salzburg last season, Haaland has netted another eight in six Champions League games for Dortmund since his January transfer. Not even the likes of Messi or Ronaldo scored so many Champions League goals at the start of their illustrious careers. ""Erling is a fantastic player,"" said England winger Jadon Sancho, who hit the net with a superb free-kick on Tuesday. ""I am happy to play with him - he works hard every day on and off the pitch."" Having also scored four goals in Saturday's 5-2 rout of Hertha Berlin, Haaland's form has taken Dortmund to the verge of the last 16 in Europe. A home win against Lazio next Wednesday will put Dortmund in the Champions League's knock-out stages. With the games coming thick and fast, Dortmund coach Lucien Favre warns that the 1.94m Haaland needs protecting. ""He's still growing, sometimes he has a problem with his knee. If we overdo it, it could work against us afterwards."" Haaland ""always wants to play -- but that's my problem,"" Favre added. Dortmund are one point behind European champions Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga. ""We are achieving good results and playing well, there is a lightness in the way we are playing,"" said former captain and current player licence director Sebastian Kehl. ""We want to have a run up until Christmas. We can achieve a lot,"" Kehl added with Dortmund still facing eight games in the coming four weeks."
31,24/11/2020,23:14,Haaland continues record exploits as Dortmund beat Brugge,Erling Braut Haaland broke yet another Champions League record on Tuesday as he fired Borussia Dortmund a step closer to the knockout stages with two goals in a 3-0 win over Club Brugge.,"Haaland's 18th-minute opener against Brugge saw him reach 15 Champions League goals in fewer games than any other player in the competition's history. The 20-year-old Norwegian hit the milestone in just 12 appearances, smashing the previous record of 19 games held by Ruud van Nistelrooy and Roberto Soldado. Haaland added another in the second half to take his tally to 16, as he and Dortmund annihilated Brugge to defend top spot in Group F and move within touching distance of qualification for the second round. With two games to go, Lucien Favre's side are now five points clear of third place and a point ahead of second-placed Lazio, who beat Zenit Saint Petersburg 3-1 on Tuesday. Dortmund were predictably dominant in the first half, and it took Haaland just 70 seconds to send a shot fizzing past the Brugge post. The Norwegian found the net on 18 minutes, placing a low shot past Simon Mignolet after Jadon Sancho set him up with an elegant through ball. Sancho, who had been dropped to the bench for Dortmund's league win at Hertha Berlin last weekend, was in excellent form upon his return to the starting XI. The 20-year-old Englishman doubled Dortmund's lead on the stroke of half-time, curling a free-kick into the top corner after compatriot Jude Bellingham was fouled on the edge of the box. Haaland put the game beyond reach on the hour mark, gratefully pouncing on an inadvertent assist from Brugge midfielder Ruud Vormer and sweeping the ball in from close range."
32,23/11/2020,14:57,"Phenomenal Haaland, trouble for Barcelona and PSG: European football talking points","Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain look vulnerable after weekend defeats, while Erling Braut Haaland laid down another marker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic keeps on scoring too, and Norwegian club Bodo/Glimt have a record which will take some beating.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: If Barcelona thought keeping Lionel Messi against his will would suffice to make them contenders in La Liga this season, it is not working. The Argentine was a peripheral figure as Ronald Koeman's team produced a mediocre performance and lost 1-0 to Atletico Madrid on Saturday, a result which left them 12th in La Liga, nine points behind Diego Simeone's team in second. They are 12 points behind leaders Real Sociedad, albeit with two games in hand. The Basque club are flying, having equalled a club record of six straight league wins, while Barcelona have won just once, and lost three times, in the same period. Atletico are possibly now the title favourites, unbeaten in 24 league games, and it all points to the Catalans facing a fight just to finish in the top four. All the more so as the injuries are piling up: Against Atletico they saw Gerard Pique go off with a serious knee injury and lost Sergi Roberto to a thigh tear. Both are expected to be out for two months. Erling Braut Haaland keeps on breaking records. On Saturday the Norwegian sensation, aged 20 years and four months, scored four times in the second half in Borussia Dortmund's 5-2 win at Hertha Berlin, becoming the youngest player to net four in one Bundesliga game. Named last week as the winner of the Golden Boy for Europe's best young player, as awarded by Italian sports daily Tuttosport, he has 10 Bundesliga goals for the season and 15 in all competitions. Not to mention six for his country. Haaland's figures have been mindblowing since he burst onto the scene last season with Salzburg, and he has now scored a total of 23 goals in 22 Bundesliga matches following his move to Dortmund in January. That beats the tally of Hamburg legend Uwe Seeler, who scored 20 in his first 22 outings of the first Bundesliga season in 1963/64. Kylian Mbappe, that other young striking phenomenon, has now scored 99 goals for Paris Saint-Germain since signing from Monaco in a 180 million-euro deal ($215m) deal in August 2017. On Friday he grabbed a first-half brace to put PSG 2-0 up away against his old side, but the champions imploded in the second half and ended up losing 3-2, with a late Cesc Fabregas penalty deciding the game. After eight consecutive Ligue 1 wins, PSG's momentum has been stalled and they are now just two points clear of Lille at the top. And their defensive weaknesses may come back to haunt them in a crucial Champions League clash with RB Leipzig this midweek. Presnel Kimpembe is suspended for that match, and Abdou Diallo is in the firing line after his error gifted Monaco the crucial penalty. The jury remains out on last season's Champions League finalists. Will Haaland and Mbappe still be banging in the goals as they approach 40? Zlatan Ibrahimovic is, and AC Milan are on top of Serie A. On Sunday the Swede scored twice before limping off with a thigh strain as the Rossoneri won 3-1 at Napoli to stay two points ahead of Sassuolo at the top, and remain unbeaten. Ibrahimovic is the top scorer in Italy with 10 goals, despite turning 39 last month. Milan coach Stefano Pioli must hope the veteran forward is not missing for too long. The early indications are he will be out for at least 10 days. Milan's other goal-scorer in Naples was Jens Petter Hauge, the winger signed from Bodo/Glimt at the start of the season. Hauge's old club have coped fine since his departure and on Sunday became Norwegian champions for the first time. From the small town of Bodo, just north of the Arctic Circle and a 16-hour drive from Oslo, Bodo/Glimt are the northernmost top-flight champions ever according to sports data experts Gracenote who say they have stolen that particular prize from KA Akureyri, former Icelandic title winners. Bodo/Glimt have won the league with five games to spare and will enter next season's Champions League. bur-as/td <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org>"

Moukoko came on after 85 minutes to replace Erling Braut Haaland, who scored four second-half goals in a stunning display. ""He's only just turned 16, that is amazing,"" Haaland said of Moukoko. ""He has a big career ahead of him."" Moukoko made his Bundesliga debut after dazzling in German youth football with a mind-blowing 47 goals in 25 matches for Dortmund U19s. He could also become the youngest player in Champions League history if he features in the home game against Brugge on Tuesday. He could beat the record held by Nigeria's Celestine Babayaro, who was 16 years, 87 days when he played for Anderlecht in 1994/95."
34,21/11/2020,23:11,Haaland scores four as Dortmund cut Bayern's lead,Erling Braut Haaland netted four goals and Youssoufa Moukoko became the youngest player in Bundesliga history on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund routed Hertha Berlin 5-2 to trim Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the table to just a point.,"It was the first time the 20-year-old Haaland had scored four goals in a game for Dortmund since his January debut, with all of them coming in the second half. ""I drank a Red Bull at half time, I got some wings and everything was good,"" said Haaland. The Norwegian now has 10 goals in seven Bundesliga matches this season to give him a total of 31 goals in 30 games in all competitions for Dortmund. After Matheus Cunha gave Hertha a first-half lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, Dortmund roared back. Haaland equalised when he tapped home an Emre Can pass on 47 minutes. He grabbed his second two minutes later with perfect timing to slip his marker and fire in a Julian Brandt pass. Haaland wrapped up his hat-trick on 62 minutes, just before Raphael Guerreiro stabbed the ball home from close range to make it 4-1. Cunha converted a late penalty, but the night belonged to Haaland who finished a move he started with 10 minutes to play. There was still time for history to be made as Moukoko made a late cameo off the Dortmund bench to replace Haaland. One day after his 16th birthday, Moukoko is the youngest player in Bundesliga history. ""He's only just turned 16 -- that is amazing,"" Haaland said of Moukoko. ""He has a big career ahead of him."" Dortmund's romp in Berlin moved them second in the standings, behind defending champions Bayern who stayed top despite a 1-1 home draw with Werder Bremen. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer produced great stops to twice deny US forward Josh Sargent as Bremen earned their first point at Bayern for a decade. ""We had to invest a lot,"" Neuer told Sky. The 34-year-old bounced back after conceding six goals in Germany's crushing defeat by Spain in midweek with two brilliant first-half saves in quick succession. He used a boot to block a Sargent shot, then lunged across goal to save from Ludwig Augustinsson. In the dying stages, Neuer then stood tall to block a shot by Sargent, who had broken clear. Bayern coach Hansi Flick was far from pleased that Bremen took the lead in his 50th game in charge, saying his team ""have to defend better"". Bremen deservedly went ahead just before half-time when midfielder Maximilian Eggestein finished off a superb attack. ""We conceded a very cheap goal, that's how Bremen's plan worked and they defended very well,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. Kingsley Coman equalised in the 62nd minute at the Allianz Arena by meeting a Leon Goretzka cross at the far post. Bayern forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting fired over with the goal at his mercy five minutes from time. However, Neuer's heroics at the other end preserved the draw. Bayer Leverkusen are third after their 2-1 win at strugglers Arminia Bielefeld thanks to Aleksandar Dragovic's late winner. The victory was a relief for Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, who scored a embarrassing own goal early in the second half. Leverkusen were 1-0 up thanks to a Leon Bailey goal when Hradecky sliced a clearance, which rolled into the empty net behind him. Dragovic stabbed home from close range two minutes from time to spare Hradecky's blushes. RB Leipzig sit fourth after Yussuf Poulsen came off the bench and produced a deft second-half volley in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt after winger Aymen Barkok gave the hosts an early lead. Despite having seven players quarantined with the coronavirus, a depleted Hoffenheim drew 3-3 at home with Stuttgart. Schalke's winless run stretched to 24 league games, dating back to January, after losing 2-0 at home to Wolfsburg. A Daniel Caligiuri equaliser two minutes from time gave 10-man Augsburg a 1-1 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach."

Dortmund put out a video in midweek hinting that Moukoko could feature in Berlin, but on Friday head coach Lucien Favre insisted no decision has been made. ""He's allowed to play with us,"" said Favre as German league rules state players must be 16. ""We'll see if he goes to Berlin with the team, that hasn't been decided yet. ""He's got fantastic potential. ""He's doing very well in (training with) the first team."" Often playing against players four years older than him, Moukoko has scored a jaw-dropping 47 goals with 10 assists in just 25 matches for Dortmund U19s over the last two seasons. On Friday, sports director Michael Zorc asked reporters to play down the hype around Moukoko, but even star striker Erling Braut Haaland is impressed by what he has seen in training. ""I don't want to put any pressure on, but he's the best 15-year-old I've seen in my life,"" Haaland said in the build-up to Moukoko's birthday. The Cameroon-born starlet, who has already played for Germany Under-20s, has plenty of time to become the German league's youngest player. Current holder Nuri Sahin was 16 years, 335 days when he made his league debut for Dortmund in 2005."

Young players in particular have the chance to develop here,"" said Reyna. ""I have already learned a lot and want to learn more in future."" Reyna is keeping youthful company in Dortmund's attack alongside England winger Jadon Sancho, star striker Haaland, both 20, and English midfielder Jude Bellingham, 17. He has already made 22 appearances in the Bundesliga, including creating three goals in a 4-0 win over Freiburg last month. He also scored a goal and set up another for Haaland in the 3-0 win over Moenchengladbach on the opening weekend of the season. ""Gio's development in recent months has been incredible,"" said sports director Michael Zorc. Reyna made his senior international debut last week against Wales, the day before his 18th birthday, he scored his first goal for the States on Monday in a 6-2 away win over Panama. The teenage attacking midfielder has been in the Dortmund squad since January after transferring from New York City FC. ""He was already a very, very good player with a lot of potential at 17,"" said Dortmund coach Lucien Favre. ""If he continues like this, he will be very important for Dortmund in the next few years."""
37,19/11/2020,18:10,Each fanless match costs Dortmund four million euros: CEO,Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Waztke revealed Thursday that each home game held without fans costs the Bundesliga club four million euros ($4.7 million) in lost revenue.,"Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park is the biggest stadium in Germany and can host 81,000 spectators. Fans are currently locked out of all Bundesliga matches as part of government measures to restrict the spread of the coronavirus. Last season's Bundesliga runners-up closed the 2019/20 financial year with a loss of 44 million euros after last season was disrupted by Covid-19. In Thursday's annual general meeting, held online because of the pandemic, Watzke said he fears losses of up to 75 million euros this season. However, the Dortmund boss gave assurances that the club has ""sufficient liquidity to ensure that there is no danger"" to their existence. As well as revealing the scale of lost revenue for each home game, Watzke said salary waivers for their squad and club employees has saved around 11 million euros. Dortmund start the weekend third in the Bundesliga table having lost 3-2 at home to leader Bayern Munich before the international break."
38,19/11/2020,03:10,Wunderkind Moukoko on verge of making history,Teen prodigy Youssoufa Moukoko could become the youngest debutant in Bundesliga history this weekend as Borussia Dortmund hint that the German goal-scoring sensation may make his senior debut.,"Moukoko turns 16 on Friday and if he plays at Hertha Berlin on Saturday evening, he will set a new Bundesliga record having already sent goal records tumbling in German youth football. The Cameroon-born teen has already played for Germany's Under-20 side this season and is relishing the prospect of his Bundesliga debut. ""I read what the media write, but I don't put pressure on myself,"" Moukoko told Dortmund's website in a rare interview during which the club hinted he could feature in Berlin. Even if his league debut only follows in the coming weeks, the confident teen is ""not worried - I know I will make my debut at some point"". Nuri Sahin, whose record is under threat, wants Moukoko to make his Bundesliga debut, because ""the Under-19s is too easy for him"". Sahin, now 32, was 16 years, 335 days when he made his Dortmund debut in 2005, giving Moukoko ample time to break his record. He could also make his Champions League debut this autumn to break the record of Celestine Babayaro, who was 16 years, 87 days when he played for Anderlecht in 1994/95. Moukoko has already trained with Dortmund's first team on the back of his goal-scoring feats for the youth team. Despite often facing opponents four years his senior, the robust 15-year-old is captain of Dortmund's U19 team and has scored 13 goals in just four games so far this season. His stats are part of a mind-blowing total of 47 goals with 10 assists in just 25 matches for Dortmund U19s over two seasons. Dortmund are doing their best to shield him -- all interview requests are denied -- but his name is already well known at the top of German football. ""Youssoufa Moukoko has a talent that you don't come across that often,"" commented Germany coach Joachim Loew. Moukoko already has more than 700,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike. He was born in Yaounde, Cameroon, and moved to Hamburg, his father's home city, in 2014 where he first started playing for St Pauli's junior side. In 2016, he switched to Dortmund's youth academy, where he started breaking goal-scoring records, sparking unfounded doubts over his age. As a 13-year-old at the start of 2017/18, he banged in 40 goals in 28 games for Dortmund Under-17s including the winning goal in the play-off final against Bayern Munich. He topped that with 50 goals in 28 games in 2018/19, including 46 in the league to set a new youth record at Under-17 level. Last season he moved up to Dortmund's Under-19s just before his 15th birthday and dismissed doubts about his ability at the higher level with six goals on his stunning debut in a 9-2 demolition of Wuppertal. He finished 2019/20 with 38 goals in 28 games and talk of a Bundesliga debut soon started. ""We would all do well to watch Youssoufa's developement in a relaxed fashion with a bit of patience,"" said German FA sports director Joti Chatzialexiou optimistically. Yet he is already showing maturity beyond his years. Last month, Moukoko scored a hat-trick as Dortmund's Under-19 side beat Schalke 3-2, but his brilliant display was overshadowed by racist abuse from home supporters in Gelsenkirchen. Schalke apologised to Dortmund and Moukoko, who responded by taking a knee after scoring in his next game to join the 'Black Lives Matter' protest."
39,07/11/2020,21:44,Kimmich injury overshadows Bayern's win at Dortmund,Bayern Munich face an anxious wait to discover the severity of Joshua Kimmich's knee injury which cast a shadow over their 3-2 win at Borussia Dortmund on Saturday which sent them top of the Bundesliga.,"The Germany midfielder, who has been in great form recently, was helped off in obvious distress after twisting his knee in a first-half challenge. ""He'll fly home with us and be examined - it's too early to say the extent of the injury,"" said grim-faced Bayern coach Hansi Flick. Kimmich is also a concern for Germany ahead of the friendly against the Czech Republic on Wednesday before Nations League games against Spain and then Ukraine in the following six days. Bayern earned their fourth straight win over Dortmund as Robert Lewandowski scored his 11th goal in just six league games. After Marco Reus gave Dortmund the lead, David Alaba blasted home a free-kick to make it 1-1 at the break before Lewandowski struck with a superb header early in the second half. Lewandowski, the European player of the year, could have finished with a hat-trick after the VAR ruled out further efforts either side of half-time. Leroy Sane came off the bench to grab Bayern's third ten minutes before the final whistle while Erling Braut Haaland scored Dortmund's late second goal. However, Flick admitted the potential loss of midfield dynamo Kimmich would be a blow for the European champions. ""He's a very important player for us and with his mentality, he isn't someone you can replace like for like,"" said Flick. The Bayern boss was pleased with the win which left his side two points clear of second-placed RB Leipzig. Dortmund are now third, three points behind Munich. ""There were many, many chances to score on both sides,"" enthused Flick. ""In the end we were a little more determined, that's why I think the victory was more than deserved. ""Dortmund were dangerous when we made mistakes, which we must put a stop to."" Dortmund head coach Lucien Favre said it was ""hard to accept"" conceding three goals at home to Bayern. ""All in all, we have to be positive, we did a good job - we had so many chances to score,"" lamented the Swiss. Haaland was annoyed at his own performance after converting one of his four chances. ""I have to score more goals, if we don't put our chances away at this level, then we won't win,"" said the 20-year-old. ""They are the best team in the world, but we have to work harder to take the next step to be as good as them."""
40,07/11/2020,20:35,Lewandowski strikes as Bayern Munich down Dortmund to go top,Robert Lewandowski scored his 11th goal in just his sixth Bundesliga game this season as Bayern Munich went top of the table on Saturday with a 3-2 win at Borussia Dortmund.,"""In the end, we deserved the win and such victories are doubly important for us,"" said midfielder Leon Goretzka as Bayern saw off their rivals. After Marco Reus had put Dortmund ahead, David Alaba blasted home a free-kick to make it 1-1 at half-time behind closed doors at Signal Iduna Park. Lewandowski gave Bayern the lead with a superb header early in the second half before Leroy Sane grabbed the visitors' third. Erling Braut Haaland gave Dortmund hope with a late goal, but was left to regret earlier misses. ""I have to score more goals, if we don't put our chances away at this level, then we won't win,"" said Haaland, who converted one of four shots on goal. ""They are the best team in the world and we have to work harder to take the next step to be as good as them"". The 32-year-old Lewandowski could have finished with a hat-trick against his former club after also having two goals disallowed by the VAR. The win leaves Bayern two points clear of second-placed RB Leipzig with Dortmund third, three points behind Munich. The away win could have come at a cost, however, as Bayern midfielder Joshua Kimmich had to be helped off in clear distress with a first-half knee injury. ""I think his knee got overstretched, it didn't look good,"" admitted Goretzka. After the hosts made a bright start with Haaland firing wide, Lewandowski's effort on 24 minutes was ruled out by the VAR who spotted the Poland star offside in the build up. Dortmund took the lead on 45 minutes when centre-half Mats Hummels sent a superb pass down the left flank for Jadon Sancho. The England winger played Raphael Guerreiro into the area to provide the final pass which Reus fired home. However, Bayern levelled four minutes later. After Dortmund's midfield enforcer Thomas Delaney brought down Serge Gnarby on the edge of the area, Alaba blasted home a superb free-kick to make it 1-1 at the break. Haaland fired wide at the start of the second half, just before Lewandowski powered home his header from a pin-point Lucas Herandez cross to put Bayern 2-1 up on 48 minutes. Bayern had their tails up and Kingsley Coman's shot crashed off the post soon after. Sane looked to have put the game beyond Dortmund when he cut inside, beat two defenders and fired home ten minutes from time. However, Haaland fired home from a tight angle to give Dortmund hope while Reus volleyed wide with the goal at his mercy. Lewandowski had the ball in the Dortmund net once more just before the whistle, only to again be denied by the VAR. Earlier, RB Leipzig were impressive in their 3-0 home win over Freiburg. Defender Ibrahima Konate fired home Leipzig's opener before midfielder Marcel Sabitzer added their second goal with a 70th-minute penalty. Manchester City loanee Angelino claimed the third with a stunning free-kick which curled over the Freiburg wall just before the final whistle. ""We really deserved the win - we were very, very good in the first-half,"" said Leipzig head coach Julian Nagelsmann. Union Berlin climbed to fourth with a 5-0 home thrashing of strugglers Arminia Bielefeld. Former Germany striker Max Kruse helped set up Union's first three goals, then converted a late penalty. Bottom side Mainz were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Schalke, who sit one place above them and have now gone 23 games without a league win dating back to January. After five games without a win, Hertha Berlin roared back with a 3-0 victory in the fog at Augsburg. Forwards Matheus Cunha, Dodi Lukebakio and Krzysztof Piatek, who cost Hertha 24 million euros ($28 million) from AC Milan in January, got on the scoresheet."

The European champions have won all three of the club's most recent meetings, but Dortmund have won two of their last three home games against Bayern. ""Bayern will have respect,"" former Dortmund captain Sebastian Kehl said in the build-up. Lewandowski, 32, has banged in 10 goals in his five league games for Bayern, while Dortmund's Haaland, 20, has scored five times. Ahead of the top-of-the-table clash, Bayern and Dortmund both rested their star strikers last weekend. The pair warmed-up by each scoring two goals for their respective clubs in midweek Champions League away wins. Lewandowski, 32, converted a penalty and added a superb header in a 6-2 thrashing of Salzburg. Not to be outdone, Haaland, 20, also netted twice in Dortmund's 3-0 win at Brugge to become the first player to score 14 goals in his first 11 Champions League games. Bayern have had to deal with off-field distractions, however, caused by David Alaba's contract wrangles. The defender is ""hurt and disappointed"" after Bayern withdrew the offer of a contract extension, which reportedly would have earned Alaba up to 20 million euros ($23.6 million) per season. His contract expires next June and head coach Hansi Flick has said he just wants ""calm in the team before the game against Dortmund"". The big question is whether Dortmund can contain a Bayern side which has scored 44 goals in just 12 games this season. Having reverted to a back four after abandoning a three-man defence, Dortmund have not conceded a goal in their last four games. However, Bayern will be a far bigger test of Dortmund's defensive prowess than Schalke, Zenit St Petersburg, Bielefeld or Brugge. ""We feel very comfortable in the new system,"" said Dortmund centre-back Manuel Akanji. ""We know that we can win against Bayern at home. We have proven that several times."" Midfielder Axel Witsel impressed as a defender alongside Akanji in the win at Brugge. Witsel could start against Bayern at centre-back if Mats Hummels fails to recover from a thigh strain. Before the Bundesliga's heavyweights slug it out in Dortmund, third-place RB Leipzig host Freiburg, who are winless in their last five games. Leipzig want to build on their midweek Champions League win over Paris Saint Germain when the German club's French winger Christopher Nkunku scored against his former club PSG in a 2-1 victory. Plea netted a hat-trick in mid-week as Borussia Moenchengladbach returned to their European glory days of the 70s with a 6-0 win at Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League. The 27-year-old has also been creative in Europe with four assists - setting up both goals for Marcus Thuram, who just received his first France call-up, in Gladbach's 2-2 home draw against Real Madrid. Expect Plea and Thuram to spearhead the visitors' attack at Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday with just a point separating the clubs. 37 - average minutes Lewandowski needs to score a Bundesliga goal this season, while Haaland nets in the league every 77 minutes. 5 - goals Haaland has scored in as many Bundesliga matches in 2020/21.

Not to be outdone, Haaland, 20, also netted twice in Dortmund's 3-0 win at Brugge to become the first player to score 14 goals in his first 11 Champions League games. Bayern have had to deal with off-field distractions, however, caused by David Alaba's contract wrangles. The defender is ""hurt and disappointed"" after Bayern withdrew the offer of a contract extension, which reportedly would have earned Alaba up to 20 million euros ($23.6 million) per season. His contract expires next June and head coach Hansi Flick has said he just wants ""calm in the team before the game against Dortmund"". The big question is whether Dortmund can contain a Bayern side which has scored 44 goals in just 12 games this season. Having reverted to a back four after abandoning a three-man defence, Dortmund have not conceded a goal in their last four games. However, Bayern will be a far bigger test of Dortmund's defensive prowess than Schalke, Zenit St Petersburg, Bielefeld or Brugge. ""We feel very comfortable in the new system,"" said Dortmund centre-back Manuel Akanji. ""We know that we can win against Bayern at home. We have proven that several times."" Midfielder Axel Witsel impressed as a defender alongside Akanji in the win at Brugge. Witsel could start against Bayern at centre-back if Mats Hummels fails to recover from a thigh strain. Before the Bundesliga's heavyweights slug it out in Dortmund, third-place RB Leipzig host Freiburg, who are winless in their last five games. Leipzig want to build on their midweek Champions League win over Paris Saint Germain when the German club's French winger Christopher Nkunku scored against his former club PSG in a 2-1 victory. Plea netted a hat-trick in mid-week as Borussia Moenchengladbach returned to their European glory days of the 70s with a 6-0 win at Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League. The 27-year-old has also been creative in Europe with four assists - setting up both goals for Marcus Thuram, who just received his first France call-up, in Gladbach's 2-2 home draw against Real Madrid. Expect Plea and Thuram to spearhead the visitors' attack at Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday with just a point separating the clubs. 37 - average minutes Lewandowski needs to score a Bundesliga goal this season, while Haaland nets in the league every 77 minutes. 5 - goals Haaland has scored in as many Bundesliga matches in 2020/21. Lewandowski has netted a record ten in his first five games. 18 - goals Haaland has scored in his first 20 Bundesliga games. Lewandowski scored five times in his first 20 league games in 2010/11.

43,04/11/2020,23:12,Borussia's Belgians haunt their homeland,Erling Braut Haaland scored twice as Borussia Dortmund claimed a 3-0 Champions League group stage win over Club Brugge on Wednesday.,"Norwegian striker Haaland took his Champions League season tally to four goals as Belgian internationals Thorgan Hazard, Axel Witsel and Thomas Meunier helped him blast away Brugge in a dominant first half display from Dortmund. Haaland is now the first player ever to score 14 goals in his first 11 Champions League appearances. ""Erling is a goal machine, he always scores one or two. It's a shame he didn't get his hat-trick today,"" Hazard told Sky. The win brings Dortmund back on course to qualify from Group F after suffering an early setback with a 3-1 defeat to Lazio in the opening game. The Bundesliga side now lead the group ahead of the Italians, who were held to a 1-1 draw away to Zenit St Petersburg earlier on Wednesday. Dortmund took their chances clinically in the first half, and were 3-0 up after just half an hour, with a Belgian player involved in all three goals. A surprise pick ahead of England's Jadon Sancho in the starting line-up, Hazard opened the scoring on 14 minutes, sweeping in a curling cross from Thomas Delaney at the far post. ""It's always better to score in Belgium when you're Belgian,"" said Hazard. A few minutes later, Witsel rose highest at a corner to head the ball into the path of Haaland, who doubled the lead from close range. Meunier then set up Haaland for Dortmund's third on 32 minutes, squaring the ball to the Norwegian after Mahmoud Dahoud had carved open the Brugge defence with a scintillating chipped pass. Brugge battled on despite the scoreline, and had several chances to snatch a goal back before half-time. Emmanuel Dennis forced a sharp save from Dortmund keeper Roman Buerki, while Eduard Sobol shaved the post with a long-range shot on 36 minutes. Yet it was Dortmund's night, and Lucien Favre's side saw out the second half comfortably to leapfrog both Brugge and Lazio into top spot. With their Champions League campaign back on course, Dortmund now turn their attention to domestic football with a crucial clash against top-of-the-table rivals Bayern Munich on Saturday."

46,03/11/2020,03:10,Sancho out to silence critics with Dortmund,Borussia Dortmund and England star Jadon Sancho will be out to silence his critics when his side take on Club Brugge in their third Champions League group game on Wednesday.,"While fellow youngsters Erling Braut Haaland and Giovanni Reyna have hogged the headlines in Dortmund this season, 20-year-old winger Sancho has come under fire in recent weeks for an alleged lack of form. The Englishman has picked up just two assists in his first five Bundesliga games this season, compared to five assists and three goals at the same stage last term. Critics suggest that Sancho, who was heavily linked with a move to Manchester United in the summer, has been distracted by speculation over his future. ""Since his departure from Dortmund didn't work out, Sancho has been a shadow of his former self,"" wrote broadcaster NTV on their website last month. ""There was a lot of talk about him leaving, and that can have an influence,"" said coach Lucien Favre last week when asked about Sancho's form. The 20-year-old hit back last Wednesday, however, scoring the crucial opening goal as Dortmund battled to a hard-fought 2-0 win over Zenit Saint-Petersburg. After defeat in their opening game against Lazio, Sancho's performance helped Dortmund to avoid a nightmare start to their European campaign in a group from which they are expected to qualify. The German side are counting on their English star to deliver again as they look to fight their way into the top two of Group F with a win in Bruges. His performance will be all the more important if Dortmund are forced to go without Norwegian sensation Haaland, who missed last weekend's 2-0 victory over Arminia Bielefeld with a knee problem. Haaland and American teenager Reyna have overshadowed Sancho so far this season, picking up 10 goals and eight assists between them in all competitions. Yet despite his quieter start to the campaign, there are signs that Sancho may already be maturing into a more senior role in the dressing room. Now in his fourth Bundesliga season, Sancho has taken fellow Englishman Jude Bellingham under his wing since the 17-year-old joined Dortmund from Birmingham City in July. ""It helps me a lot to get encouragement and praise from (Sancho),"" Bellingham told Kicker magazine last week. ""He is really very important for me, not just because he comes from the same country and speaks the same language. ""Even more important is the fact that he puts his arm around me and the other young players."" That relationship has borne fruit, with Bellingham picking up his first Champions League assist last week, and Dortmund hope that the young English duo can now help steer them towards the knockout stages."
47,31/10/2020,17:38,Bayern Munich sweep past Cologne to go top without Lewandowski,European champions Bayern Munich went top of the Bundesliga on Saturday as Thomas Mueller and Serge Gnabry provided the goals with Robert Lewandowski rested for their 2-1 win at Cologne.,"Bayern coach Hansi Flick opted to leave out Lewandowski, who scored a record 10 goals in the opening five league games, ahead of their midweek Champions League match at Salzburg and a Bundesliga showdown at Dortmund next Saturday. However, RB Leipzig, who are now two points behind in third, can go back to the top of the table if they beat Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday evening. Mueller netted an early penalty and Gnabry finished a counter-attack on the stroke of half-time to leave Bayern 2-0 up at the break. Cologne improved in the second-half and replacement midfielder Dominick Drexler pulled back a late goal. Borussia Dortmund climbed to second in the table without star striker Erling Braut Haaland as defender Mats Hummels scored both goals in a 2-0 win at Arminia Bielefeld."
48,28/10/2020,23:11,"Sancho, Haaland rescue toiling Dortmund","Jadon Sancho and Erling Braut Haaland spared Borussia Dortmund's blushes with late goals on Wednesday, as the German side laboured to a 2-0 victory over Zenit St. Petersburg in the Champions League.","Sancho's 77th-minute spotkick and a stoppage time strike from Haaland decided an otherwise turgid game in Dortmund's favour, giving them the first three points of their Group F campaign. Having slumped to a 3-1 defeat away to Lazio in their opening game last week, the Bundesliga side were under pressure to pick up three points, with sporting director Michael Zorc warning that they could not afford ""another slip"". Yet on a wet Wednesday evening in the west of Germany, Lucien Favre's side toiled without reward against a well-drilled Russian defence. As Zenit sat back, Dortmund were starved of space up front and their attacks repeatedly fizzled out in a tangle of short passes. ""Guys, this is too complicated,"" shouted veteran centre-back Mats Hummels into the empty Signal-Iduna-Park midway through the first half. Sancho orchestrated a couple of half-chances before the break, but neither Marco Reus nor Haaland could squeeze the ball past Mikhail Kerzhakov. Reus struck the post early in the second half, while Kerzhakov palmed away a long-range effort from Dahoud on 66 minutes. The home side were finally rewarded 11 minutes later as Thorgan Hazard was pulled down by Vyacheslav Karavaev. Sancho, who has faced media criticism for his recent performances, made no mistake from 12 yards, coolly slotting the ball into the bottom corner in front of the famous, but now deserted 'Yellow Wall'. Haaland sealed the three points in stoppage time, latching onto a flicked header from Jude Bellingham and drilling the ball underneath Kerzhakov."
49,27/10/2020,18:03,"Sancho's poor form due to Man Utd talk, says Dortmund coach",Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre said Tuesday that the recent transfer speculation linking Jadon Sancho to Manchester United is behind the England winger's dip in form.,"""Every player has slow periods. There was a lot of talk about Jadon during the summer -- something like that can be a factor,"" Favre said ahead of Dortmund's Champions League home game against Zenit Saint Petersburg on Wednesday. Throughout the summer, until the transfer window closed on October 5, the British media speculated that Man United were set to sign Sancho. In late September, Dortmund reportedly rejected United's offer of up to 100 million euros ($117 million). So far in 2020/21, the 20-year-old has struggled to recapture last season's blistering form when he scored 17 goals and created just as many in the Bundesliga. However, Sancho struggled in Dortmund's shock 2-0 league defeat by Augsburg in late September and was then dropped by England for breaching coronavirus protocols on international duty earlier this month. Sancho was also off form in a poor team display when Dortmund lost 3-1 at Lazio last week in the Champions League. However, he produced a superb pass to Erling Braut Haaland, who scored in Saturday's 3-0 league drubbing of Schalke in the Ruhr derby. Favre says Sancho just needs time. ""No player is consistently in top form for an entire year, that's impossible. You have to accept that,"" added the Dortmund boss. Dortmund are looking to get back on track in Group F against Zenit after crashing in Rome. Zenit are also hoping to bounce back from a poor opening 2-1 loss at home to Club Brugge. ""It wasn't a good enough performance against Lazio,"" admitted Dortmund midfielder Thomas Delaney. ""Fortunately, there are still more chances to pick up points. I'm not worried that we won't qualify."""
50,23/10/2020,03:58,"Clasico, Dortmund v Schalke - what to look out for in Europe this weekend","Two of the biggest rivalries in world football will dominate the weekend's action in Europe, with the first Clasico of the season being followed by the Ruhr derby between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke on Saturday.","AFP Sport previews the standout action on the continent this weekend: Barcelona v Real Madrid, Saturday 1400 GMT Once the undisputed greatest fixture in world football, the Clasico has lost much of its lustre. Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar and Andres Iniesta were among the superstars to move on from Real Madrid and Barcelona in recent years, and this year Gareth Bale and Luis Suarez departed too. Lionel Messi would have left as well, had Barcelona let him. Usually there would be 99,000 fans packed into the Camp Nou. This time, because of the coronavirus pandemic, there will be none. The huge global audience will remain, but it's a long time since these teams have been at such a collective low ebb. Barca are struggling to get back on their feet under new coach Ronald Koeman and lost 1-0 at Getafe last weekend. Real won La Liga last season but the last week gives a more accurate picture of where they stand: Zinedine Zidane's team lost 1-0 at home to Cadiz and then went down 3-2 to Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League. Madrid have lost just once in their last seven visits to the Camp Nou though. Borussia Dortmund v Schalke, Saturday 1630 GMT Another great fixture usually played before a huge crowd, only 300 fans will be allowed in to see Dortmund host Schalke, rather than the usual 80,000. These sides are fierce rivals and tensions are running extra high after Dortmund prodigy Youssoufa Moukoko, 15, received alleged death threats and racist abuse from Schalke fans after scoring a hat-trick in last Sunday's 3-2 win in an Under-19 derby. Dortmund, with Erling Braut Haaland leading the line, will be favourites to get the better of a struggling Schalke who lost 4-0 on their last visit in May. Schalke sacked coach David Wagner after their poor start this season followed a long winless run at the end of the last campaign. Manuel Baum has replaced him and got his first point last weekend against Union Berlin. Dortmund's 1-0 victory at Hoffenheim last weekend made it three wins out of four in the Bundesliga this season, but Lucien Favre's side lost 3-1 at Lazio in the Champions League in midweek. Atletico Madrid v Real Betis, Saturday 1900 GMT Atletico are hoping to take advantage of the struggles of Real Madrid and Barcelona to win a first La Liga title since 2014. The signing of Luis Suarez from Barcelona underlined their ambition, but they head into Saturday's home meeting with Betis on the rebound from their joint-worst defeat in Diego Simeone's nine years as coach in Wednesday's 4-0 loss at Bayern Munich. Manuel Pellegrini's Betis have been inconsistent so far but, with the likes of Nabil Fekir, Sergio Canales and the evergreen Joaquin, should not be underestimated. Lyon v Monaco, Sunday 2000 GMT Lyon and Monaco have been Champions League semi-finalists in recent seasons but are not in Europe at all in this campaign, so each is desperate to get back to the promised land. Lyon have started poorly in Ligue 1 with just two wins in seven but have kept hold of star men Memphis Depay and Houssem Aouar. Monaco have been inconsistent too under new coach Niko Kovac but in Wissam Ben Yedder they have one of Europe's most lethal marksmen. AC Milan v Roma, Monday 1945 GMT Milan put their perfect start to the Serie A campaign on the line when they welcome Roma to San Siro on Monday. The Rossoneri have won four out of four so far in the league with Zlatan Ibrahimovic in fine form, but Roma have some useful veterans of their own in attack in Edin Dzeko and Pedro and are also slowly building form."
51,23/10/2020,03:40,'Don't keep your distance' - Dortmund urged to get stuck into derby,Borussia Dortmund have been told to forget about social distancing and get stuck into arch-rivals Schalke in Saturday's derby as they look to challenge RB Leipzig at the top of the Bundesliga.,"Sports director Michael Zorc was fuming as Dortmund crashed to a 3-1 defeat to Lazio in Rome on Tuesday in their opening Champions League game after standing back from too many tackles. Covid-19 has cast a shadow over the Bundesliga this week with Werder Bremen, who host Hoffenheim Sunday, cancelling training Thursday after an unnamed player tested positive. Second-place Bayern Munich will face Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday without Germany winger Serge Gnabry who sat out Wednesday's 4-0 thumping of Atletico Madrid after a positive test for the virus. As Germany recorded record high figures of the coronavirus on Thursday, most league games will be played behind closed doors. Just 300 home fans will be allowed to watch in Dortmund, whose boss Zorc urged his side not to keep their distance when defending against second-from-bottom Schalke. ""We observed the distancing rules when defending"" against Lazio, ""in exemplary fashion. We want to see a reaction,"" said Zorc drily ahead of Saturday's derby. Dortmund are third in the table, level with defending champions Bayern on nine points and just one behind leaders Leipzig. Erling Braut Haaland, who scored Dortmund's consolation goal in Rome, also netted as Schalke crashed to a 4-0 thrashing last May on their previous visit to Dortmund. Zorc wants to see ""fight and emotion"" from the home side. Gelsenkirchen-based Schalke are winless in their last 20 Bundesliga games and would love nothing more than to break their run at neighbours Dortmund. Schalke assistant coach Naldo knows all about getting a result at Signal Iduna Park. The Brazilian's last-gasp header in 2017 capped a stunning fight-back from four goals down as Schalke sealed a 4-4 draw away from home. ""Schalke will have a lot of passion, discipline and commitment - they will want to ruin our game,"" warned Zorc. Tensions are running extra high between the clubs after a racist incident last weekend. Dortmund prodigy Youssoufa Moukoko, 15, received alleged death threats and racist abuse from Schalke fans after scoring a hat-trick in Sunday's 3-2 win in an Under-19 derby in Gelsenkirchen. Schalke have apologised and are investigating the allegations. Dortmund are without centre-back Manuel Akanji, who is recovering from the coronavirus, and winger Thorgan Hazard who has a leg knock. Midfield enforcer Emre Can is available after missing the Lazio defeat with suspension. A left-back by trade, the Spaniard has scored in his last three games for league leaders RB Leipzig since moving up to the left wing. He bagged both superb goals in Tuesday's 2-0 win over Istanbul Basaksehir in the Champions League. The 23-year-old Manchester City loanee is supplying the goals in the absence of Timo Werner, who has joined Chelsea, and has been described as ""dangerous"" in front of goal by Leipzig sports director Markus Kroesche. Leipzig host Hertha Berlin on Saturday with Angelino out to add to his tally of four goals this season. 16 - the goals Schalke has conceded in just four league games so far this season. 22 - the goals Haaland, 20, has scored in 25 games for Dortmund since his transfer from Salzburg. 29 - the goals Bayern have scored in eight games this season including an 8-0 drubbing of Schalke in the opening game Fixtures (all times 1330 GMT unless stated)"
52,20/10/2020,23:27,Immobile's Lazio shock Dortmund on Champions League return,Ciro Immobile scored early against his former club as Lazio marked their return to the Champions League after a 13-year absence with a 3-1 Group F win over Borussia Dortmund.,"Italy's Immobile beat Marwin Hitz in the Dortmund goal after six minutes in Rome, with a deflection off the Germans' keeper responsible for the hosts' second goal. Norway star Erling Braut Haaland pulled a goal back after 71 minutes but Immobile set up Jean-Daniel Akpa-Akpro for the third five minutes later in front of a crowd of 1,000 at the Stadio Olimpico. It was a welcome boost for Simon Inzaghi's side who are now top in a group which also includes Zenit and Club Brugge. ""It was an incredible emotion to bring this club and this shirt back to the Champions League,"" said Immobile, last season's Serie A top scorer with 36 goals. The capital city club have experienced a stuttering start to their league season with just one win in four games, and a 3-0 defeat to Sampdoria last weekend. ""There was an extra flavour and we are satisfied because the match was played to perfection,"" continued Immobile. ""We met a strong team, it was a difficult match but we needed a game like this to give us a psychological boost, after the game against Sampdoria, to be able to have our say among the great in Europe and also in the league."" Immobile and Joaquin Correa started up front with Hitz replacing Roman Buerki in the Dortmund goal and Haaland leading Bundesliga outfit's attack. Luiz Felipe returned for Lazio after a month out with an ankle problem, with Emre Can suspended for the away side. Lazio pounced on their first chance with Thomas Meunier losing the ball to Lucas Leiva who crossed for Correa to serve up Immobile for his fifth Champions League goal and first since playing for Dortmund in December 2014. Thomas Strakosha stuck out his leg to block Raphael Guerreiro in Dortmund's first chance after 21 minutes. But Inzaghi's men doubled their lead after 23 minutes when a Luiz Felipe effort was deflected in off Hitz's head. Haaland revived hopes of a German fightback, only for Luis Alberto to send through for Immobile to lay it on for Akpa Akpro for the third goal."
53,20/10/2020,11:29,Schalke investigate alleged racist abuse of Dortmund youngster,Bundesliga side Schalke said Tuesday they are investigating alleged death threats and racist abuse aimed at Borussia Dortmund's 15-year-old prodigy Youssoufa Moukoko during an Under-19 match.,"""Schalke 04 has evaluated the audio and video material of the match and is now working intensively on identifying the persons responsible,"" the club said in a statement. Cameroon-born Moukoko scored a hat-trick to seal a 3-2 away win over Dortmund's arch rivals in the youth game in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday. In a clip from the German FA's livestream of the game, fans could be heard screaming alleged threats and racist abuse at Moukoko. As each of the 300 tickets for the game were personalised due to coronavirus measures, Schalke hope to find the culprits. ""I am proud to have been born with this skin colour and I'll always be proud,"" Moukoko posted on his Instagram story alongside the ""Black Lives Matter"" hashtag. Dortmund striker Erling Braut Haaland, Bayern Munich centre-back Jerome Boateng and Chelsea defender Antonio Ruediger all supported Moukoko on social media. Schalke sporting director Jochen Schneider contacted Dortmund to apologise to Moukoko. ""What happened must be condemned in the strongest possible terms,"" said Schneider. ""It beggars belief the things that some people in society still think is acceptable."" German FA vice-president Guenter Distelrath, who is responsible for anti-discrimination measures, wants to see action taken against the culprits. ""I would welcome a clear signal,"" he added. ""The insults against Youssoufa Moukoko are intolerable and absolutely unacceptable."" Moukoko has sent scoring records tumbling in German youth football and could claim another landmark if he makes his Bundesliga debut after he turns 16 next month. He has already trained with Dortmund's senior squad. Moukoko could also become the youngest player in Champions League history in late November as Dortmund say they will add his name to their 'B' list for matches."
54,19/10/2020,18:20,Reluctant travellers Dortmund set to play makeshift defence at Lazio,Lucien Favre admitted on Monday that Borussia Dortmund are heading to Rome reluctantly as he looks to deploy a makeshift defence against Lazio in the Champions League.,"Dortmund coach Favre expressed his concerns about travelling to the Italian capital as numbers of coronavirus cases rise across Europe. ""We must be very careful. It's dangerous,"" Swiss Favre said, with the German club to stay in a ""bubble"" during their brief stay in Rome. ""There will be more cases. It's not good to travel. ""We have to be sensible. We have to think about our players."" Lazio warmed up for their first Champions League game in 13 years by losing 3-0 at Sampdoria on Saturday, which left coach Simone Inzaghi fuming with his side in mid-table on 4 points from as many games. Dortmund are third in the Bundesliga with nine points from their opening four games, but needed a late Marco Reus goal to seal a nervy 1-0 win at Hoffenheim. Fears over Covid-19 is not Favre's only concern heading to Rome with Mats Hummels his only fully fit centre-back. Right back Lukasz Piszczek flew with the squad on Monday after suffering an eye injury against Hoffenheim. Swiss defender Manuel Akanji missed Saturday's narrow 1-0 win over Hoffenheim after testing positive for the coronavirus. Dan-Axel Zagadou and Nico Schulz are injured, while Emre Can is suspended after being sent off in their last 16 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain in February. ""A bit of improvisation is needed,"" admitted sports director Michael Zorc. Defensive midfielder Thomas Delaney, who was deployed as an emergency defender at Hoffenheim when Piszczek was injured, is set to again partner Hummels at centre-back. Marco Reus came off the bench to score a late winner at Hoffenheim, but the German club hope Erling Braut Haaland can add to his 21 goals in 24 games for Dortmund in Rome. Dortmund will be facing their former striker Ciro Immobile, 30, who managed just three goals in 24 Bundesliga games for them in 2014/15. However, Immobile has since scored 126 goals in 181 games over the last four years for Lazio, who he joined in 2016, and has been the top-scorer in Serie A three times."
55,18/10/2020,18:21,Dortmund prodigy Moukoko racially abused at Schalke junior game,Borussia Dortmund's 15-year-old star Youssoufa Moukoko was subjected to threats of violence and racist abuse during a local derby between the two clubs' junior sides on Sunday.,"Moukoko scored a hat-trick as Dortmund's under-19 side beat Schalke 3-2, but his brilliant display was overshadowed by racist abuse from spectators in Gelsenkirchen. In a clip from the German FA's livestream of the game, fans can be heard screaming threats and apparently racist comments at Moukoko after his second goal. German media also widely reported racist chants had been aimed at the teenager, who reacted defiantly. ""I am proud to have been born with this skin colour and I always be proud,"" he wrote on his Instagram story alongside the ""Black Lives Matter"" hashtag. Schalke were quick to condemn the abuse, saying that the club would ""take the necessary measures"". ""We can only apologise for the behaviour of some of our fans towards Youssoufa Moukoko at today's U19s match. Derby emotions aside, we completely condemn and oppose such insults,"" the club said on its Twitter account. Moukoko has long been considered one of the most exciting talents in European football. In 2018/19, he scored 50 goals in 28 matches for Dortmund's Under-17 side against much older opponents. Last season, aged 14, he moved up to the under-19 squad and scored 38 goals in 28 matches. The teenager will turn 16 next month, at which point he will be eligible to play in the Bundesliga. He has already been placed on the ""B"" List of Dortmund's Champions League squad, meaning he could yet become the competition's youngest ever debutant. After joining the first team at their summer training camp in August, Moukoko received the highest praise from fellow Dortmund talent Erling Haaland. ""Moukoko is much better than I was at his age,"" Haaland said. ""I have never seen such a good 15-year-old in my life."""
56,17/10/2020,17:59,"Replacements Haaland, Reus combine to send Dortmund second","Substitutes Erling Braut Haaland and Marco Reus fired Borussia Dortmund into second place in the Bundesliga on Saturday, linking up in the second half to seal a 1-0 win at Hoffenheim.","Dortmund, who had already lost one game this season, looked set to drop further points before youngster Haaland and veteran Reus came off the bench in the second half to breathe new life into a blunt performance. Haaland, 20, surged forward on the break to set up Reus with a tap-in and snatch Dortmund's first away victory over Hoffenheim in eight years. Haaland was initially rested after he played three times for Norway in the previous two weeks, prompting criticism of the busy international schedule. Hoffenheim were also without three first team regulars, as Croatia's Andrej Kramaric, Ghana's Kasim Adams and Czech defender Pavel Kaderabek were all sent into quarantine after their return from international duty. The club confirmed on late on Friday that two of three had tested positive for the coronavirus. ""We need to have a conversation about the international schedule. Normally, we are happy to let players go, but these are unusual times,"" Hoffenheim sporting director Alexander Rosen told Sky. Mijat Gacinovic missed a gilt-edged opportunity for Hoffenheim early on, and both Giovanni Reyna and Thomas Meunier came close for Dortmund. Yet it was Reus who landed the decisive blow, slotting Haaland's square pass into the open net to score his first goal since February. Dortmund now sit one point behind league leaders RB Leipzig, who held onto top spot with a 2-0 win against surprise high-fliers Augsburg. Angelino headed Leipzig in front on the stroke of half-time to score his second goal in two games, before Yussuf Poulsen doubled the lead with a sumptuous volley on 66 minutes. Elsewhere, Lucas Alario's first half header sealed a 1-0 win for Bayer Leverkusen and extended second-from-bottom Mainz's miserable run to four defeats in four games. Promoted side Stuttgart continued their good start to the season with a 2-0 win at Hertha Berlin, while Freiburg and Werder Bremen shared the points in an eventful 1-1 draw in the south-west. Marc Oliver Kempf headed in a Daniel Didavi free kick to give Stuttgart an early lead, and Gonzalo Castro fired in the second with a fizzing long-range effort in the second half. Freiburg took the lead early on through Philipp Lienhart and had a second goal ruled out for offside before Bremen's Niclas Fuellkrug levelled the scores from the penalty spot."

The 15-year-old Moukoko, already a prolific scorer in German youth football, is not on the club's 'A' list of players registered for the Champions League competition. However, he will be on their 'B' list, which according to UEFA regulations means a 16-year-old can play, provided he has been at the club for at least two years and Moukoko joined Dortmund in 2016. He will turn 16 four days before Dortmund host Brugge in the group stages on November 24, when he could become the youngest player in Champions League history. The record is currently held by Nigeria's Celestine Babayaro, now 42, who was 16 years, 86 days old when he played for Anderlecht against Steua Bucharest in 1994. He famously lasted just 34 minutes before being sent off, but went on to spend eight years at Chelsea. In 2018/19, the robust youngest scored 50 goals in 28 matches for Dortmund's Under-17 side against much older opponents. Last season, aged 14, he moved up to the U19 squad and scored 38 goals in 28 matches. Last month, the 15-year-old scored a hat-trick in his first Under-19 game and has already trained with Dortmund's senior squad. He also made his debut in September for the German U20 national team. However, Sebastian Kehl, head of Dortmund's player department, told AFP subsidiary SID that the club is keen to dampen the hype around their 'wunderkind'. Making his professional debut would be ""a big step and he is only 15 years old. We must give him the necessary peace and time"" to develop, Kehl added. Dortmund currently have two 17-year-olds in their first team in Giovanni Reyna and England junior international Jude Bellingham."
58,30/09/2020,23:06,Bayern Munich win German Super Cup to lift fifth title in 2020,Bayern Munich claimed their fifth title of the year on Wednesday as a late Joshua Kimmich goal sealed their 3-2 win over Borussia Dortmund to land the German Super Cup.,"Hosts Bayern built a 2-0 lead with first-half goals by Corentin Tolisso and Thomas Mueller, only for Erling Braut Haaland to equalise early in the second half after Julian Brandt pulled a Dortmund goal back just before the break. However, Kimmich settled the matter through sheer determination behind closed doors at the Allianz Arena. His initial shot was saved by Dortmund goalkeeper Marwin Hitz but the rebound clipped Kimmich's boot and looped in for the winning goal eight minutes from time. ""Joshua is a classy player. The way he chipped that ball in,"" said Bayern captain Manuel Neuer in admiration. Having had their record 23-match winning streak ended by a shock defeat at Hoffenheim on Sunday, Bayern bounced back. ""He (Kimmich) has enormous quality, he is in great form,"" said Bayern head coach Hansi Flick whose side have won an eighth-straight Bundesliga title, the German Cup, Champions League and the UEFA Super Cup this year. This is the fourth time in five years Bayern have won the showcase match. Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki and England winger Jadon Sancho missed the flight to Munich with ""a respiratory infection"", the club said, but both tested negative on Monday for Covid-19. Flick made five changes from the side which lost 4-1 at Hoffenheim. Leroy Sane was sidelined by a knee injury, Leon Goretzka rested and Segre Gnabry started on the bench. Canadian left-back Alphonso Davies moved up to the wing and Tolisso started in central midfield. The Frenchman gave Bayern the lead when Robert Lewandowski put in a short cross from the right wing and Tolisso side-footed home on 18 minutes. Mueller grabbed Bayern's second when he headed home after Davies floated in a cross on 32 minutes. Brandt put Dortmund back in the game five minutes before the break when Benjamin Pavard's loose pass was snapped up by Marco Reus and Brandt finished the move. It was 2-1 at the break, but Dortmund defender Thomas Meunier fired a golden chance over the bar early in the second half with just Manuel Neuer to beat. Dortmund drew level when central midfielder Thomas Delaney slid a great pass into Haaland, who showed ice cool finishing to fire past Neuer on 55 minutes. It was the 20-year-old's 19th goal in 22 games for Dortmund. With time running out, Kimmich robbed Delaney of possession near the halfway line and sprinted clear with Lewandowski in support. The pair exchanged passes and although Hitz saved the inital shot, the rebound looped over his head into the Dortmund goal after clipping Kimmich's boot. The Super Cup was the final game for Bundesliga referee Bibiana Steinhaus, 41, the first female to officiate in one of Europe's top leagues, before retirement."

The England international joined Dortmund from Manchester City for a reported £10 million three years ago, but has shone in the Bundesliga to become one of European football's brightest talents. ""The offer was for an initial £73m, rising to up to £91.3m, which fell short of Dortmund's £108m valuation,"" said a Sky report. The German giants have insisted that Sancho will remain in the Bundesliga for another season after United failed to agree a deal by Dortmund's deadline of August 10. Sebastian Kehl, head of Dortmund's player department, said after Sancho scored in a 5-0 German Cup win at Duisburg earlier this month: ""Jadon Sancho will play for Dortmund this season"". Sancho has started Dortmund's opening three games of the campaign, but has not travelled with the squad for Wednesday's clash with Bayern Munich in the German Super Cup due to a ""respiratory infection"", the club said on Tuesday. Dortmund confirmed Sancho has tested negative for coronavirus. The winger scored 20 goals and provided 20 assists in all competitions last season and Dortmund captain Marco Reus is looking forward to him staying for another season. ""We all were happy that he will be with us for one more year because he delivers assists and goals, so we get points,"" Reus told Sky Germany. ""If he gets as big as (Lionel) Messi or (Cristiano) Ronaldo, we will see. He needs time, experience and it will be important how he manages the times when things don't go so well. But he has the confidence and the quality."" United have faced criticism from fans for not spending more in the transfer market as their Premier League rivals have strengthened. Dutch international midfielder Donny Van de Beek, who arrived for £40 million from Ajax, is United's only signing of the window so far. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men have also suffered a poor start to the season, losing 3-1 at home to Crystal Palace and needing a 100th-minute penalty to beat Brighton 3-2 in their opening Premier League games."
60,26/09/2020,21:02,Haaland draws a blank as Dortmund crash at Augsburg,"Borussia Dortmund crashed to a 2-0 defeat at Augsburg on Saturday as Norway striker Erling Braut Haaland failed to rescue the visitors on his return to Bavaria, where he wrote Bundesliga history in January.","With defending champions Bayern Munich at Hoffenheim on Sunday, last season's runners-up Dortmund blew the chance to build on their impressive 3-0 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach last Saturday when Haaland scored twice in an electric display on the opening weekend of the season. The 20-year-old has netted 18 goals in 21 games this year for Dortmund and wrote himself into Bundesliga history in January when he became the first player to score a hat-trick off the bench on his German league debut. Haaland's three goals in 20 minutes sparked a 5-3 fight-back win. However, the Norwegian hot-shot drew a blank on his return to Augsburg's WWK-Arena with just one clear shot on goal as centre-back Felix Uduokhai powered home a header for the hosts from a free-kick on 40 minutes. Augsburg's former Schalke playmaker Daniel Caligiuri added to Dortmund's misery by holding off Thomas Meunier to fire home the hosts' second on 54 minutes. Haaland was booked with a half an hour gone after some pushing and shoving with Augsburg defender Jeffrey Gouweleeuw, who was also shown a yellow card. Dortmund had three times as many shots on goal and dominated with 80 percent possession, which left their Swiss coach Lucian Favre to admit, ""we are very disappointed, it's hard to accept this defeat"". ""We have much to do,"" admitted Favre, with one eye on Wednesday's German Super Cup match against Bayern in Munich. ""We almost completely dominated the game, we started well, but we weren't precise enough and were too hasty in our play. ""Augsburg defended well, we need to be more patient and play more down the flanks."" Schalke coach David Wagner is on the verge of being dismissed with his side now 18 games without a win after slumping to a 3-0 defeat at home by Werder Bremen, whose striker Niclas Fuellkrug claimed a hat-trick. Schalke were hammered 8-0 by Bayern last weekend and Bremen profited from some equally woeful defending. Fuellkrug tapped home his first goal on 22 minutes, was left unmarked to head home a free-kick on 37 minutes, then converted a penalty on the hour before Mark Uth scored Schalke's late consolation goal. There could also be consequences for Schalke centre-back Ozan Kabak who was sent off for a second yellow card late on. Television cameras also caught Kabak spitting at defender Ludwig Augustinsson after a tackle just before the break, which the referee missed. ""I didn't notice it at the time,"" said Augustinsson after watching a post-match replay, ""but it has nothing to do with football or fair play"". Earlier RB Leipzig were held to a 1-1 draw at Bayer Leverkusen as Emil Forsberg's superb opening goal for the Champions League semi-finalists was cancelled out by a long-range effort from Leverkusen's Kerem Demirbay. Leverkusen's new signing Patrik Schick, who spent last season on loan at Leipzig, curled in a superb shot from 16 metres out but his stunning strike was ruled offside with 23 minutes left. Borussia Moenchengladbach had to settle for a point at home to Union Berlin in their 1-1 draw. Marcus Thuram's headed goal for Gladbach on 56 minutes was cancelled out by an equaliser from Union defender Nico Schlotterbeck, 20, making his Bundesliga appearance for the Berlin-based club, with 11 minutes left. History was made in Arminia Bielefeld's 1-0 win at Cologne as Joan Simun Edmundsson, 29 came on to score the winner and become the first Faroe Island player to play and score in the Bundesliga. Newly-promoted Stuttgart romped to a thumping 4-1 win at 10-man Mainz. Sweden forward Robin Quaison scored early on for Mainz, but Congo winger Silas Wamangituka and Daniel Didavi netted for Stuttgart before Mainz had Moussa Niakhate sent off for a second booking. The flood gates opened with goals by replacement Mateo Klimowicz and forward Sasa Kalajdzic in the final ten minutes."
61,24/09/2020,17:33,"Dortmund sign Bynoe-Gittens, 16, from Man City","Borussia Dortmund have recruited their second English teenager in recent months with Jamie Bynoe-Gittens, 16, signing from Manchester City's academy, the Bundesliga club said Thursday.","The England Under-16 winger has signed an undisclosed ""long term"" contract. He is the second English starlet to join the German side recently after Jude Bellingham, 17, signed from Birmingham City for 26 million euros ($30 million). Bynoe-Gittens cites Dortmund's England star Jadon Sancho, 20, who joined the German club when he was 17, as his role model. Having only turned 16 in August, Bynoe-Gittens will initially play for Dortmund's Under-19 side, where ""he can develop in peace"", said sports director Michael Zorc. ""He is a highly talented player, but should be allowed to develop with the juniors,"" added Zorc, aware of comparisons with Sancho, who scored 17 goals in the Bundesliga last season. ""We don't want expectations to be too high right from the start."" Dortmund have invested heavily in youth as two 17-year-olds - Bellingham and attacking midfielder Giovanni Reyna - started Saturday's 3-0 win over Moenchengladbach on the opening weekend of the season. In the club's junior side, Bynoe-Gittens will play alongside precocious striker Youssoufa Moukoko, who hit 34 goals in 20 appearances for Dortmund U19 last season. The 15-year-old is tipped to make his Bundesliga debut when he turns 16 in November, thanks to a change in the league's age-limit rules last season."
62,24/09/2020,15:34,Dortmund 'reserve right' to stop players from Germany duty,Borussia Dortmund's head of player department Sebastian Kehl said on Thursday they could stop their players from featuring for Germany in the Nations League next month due to coronavirus worries.,"Joachim Loew's side travel to Ukraine on October 10, a country which is classed as a Covid-19 red zone due to its high number of cases. ""We're working to find solutions, but we reserve the right to not make the players available, as long as there's no rule allowing the players to play immediately after they return,"" Kehl told specialist magazine Kicker. The publication claimed the managers of champions Bayern Munich and Leipzig hold the same view. Rules in Germany state people returning from risk zones must be placed in quarantine before receiving a virus test result. Ahead of September's international matches FIFA adapted its rules regarding players in areas with high numbers of the virus. Despite the clubs' worries the German Football Association's director Oliver Bierhoff said the visit to the Ukrainian capital would last 36 hours and the team would stay away from the public. ""We will stay there in a bubble."""
63,19/09/2020,21:15,Haaland and Reyna shine as Dortmund youngsters down Gladbach,Erling Braut Haaland scored twice and 17-year-old Giovanni Reyna shone as youthful Borussia Dortmund swept aside fellow Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-0 on Saturday on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga season.,"After holders Bayern Munich had kicked off the 2020/21 campaign on Friday with a record 8-0 thrashing of Schalke, Dortmund's youngsters also dazzled at home to Gladbach. ""It was a really good start to the season. We have a lot of young guys, it's fun to play with guys near my age,"" said USA Under-17 international Reyna. ""This is an exciting group and we have to keep working."" Haaland converted a second-half penalty, then again showcased his clinical eye for goal by finishing a superb counter as Dortmund attacked from their own goal. Coach Lucien Favre banked on youth by starting two 17-year-olds in Reyna and England Under-21 midfielder Jude Bellingham, who made his league debut, with Sancho and Haaland, both 20, leading Dortmund's attack. Reyna, making just his third league start, paid back the faith by scoring the opening goal and winning the penalty Haaland converted. Reyna drilled home Bellingham's superb pass from a tight ankle on 34 minutes, then had his ankle clipped after a darting run into the area to win the penalty for Haaland. Sancho tried to convince Haaland to let him take the spot-kick, but ""I was confident whoever took it, would score, which is the most important thing"" said Reyna. Haaland then stole the show with a stunning end-to-end sprint to support Sancho's break before crashing home Dortmund's third goal on 78 minutes. The towering Norwegian, the first player in Bundesliga history to score a hat-trick from the bench, now has 18 goals in 20 games for Dortmund since his arrival in January. For the first time since March, some German league clubs were able to welcome back limited numbers of fans, depending on permission from local health authorities. The biggest crowd of the day was in Dortmund, as 9,300 cheered the impressive home win. ""It's amazing to have fans back, they support us so much,"" added Reyna. Having finished runners-up to Bayern for the last two seasons, Dortmund are on a collision course with the European champions who they meet in the German Super Cup showdown on September 30 in Munich. Earlier, Hertha Berlin's new-signing Jhon Cordoba scored on his debut in a 4-1 away romp at Werder Bremen as the ambitious capital city club also threw down an early marker. In front of 8,500 in Bremen, Hertha defender Peter Pekarik and Belgian-born winger Dodi Lukebakio scored quick-fire goals at the end of the first half to leave Werder 2-0 down at the break and the hosts were whistled off the pitch by their own fans. Colombia striker Cordoba, signed from Cologne in mid-week, came on to start the move which Brazil Under-23 forward Matheus Cunha finished as Hertha went 3-0 up with an hour gone. Davie Selke scored Bremen's second-half consolation goal before Cordoba capped his debut by tucking home Hertha's fourth goal on 90 minutes. Just like Bayern, Cologne also had to play behind closed doors due to a rising rate of infection for their 3-2 home defeat to Hoffenheim, for whom Andrej Kramaric scored a hat-trick. The Croatia striker put the visitors ahead after three minutes following a mix up in defence, netted a penalty and smashed home the winning goal in added time after Cologne had launched a late fight back. In the capital, playmaker Michael Gregoritsch and winger Andre Hahn scored late goals as Augsburg beat hosts Union Berlin 3-1 in front of 4,600 fans. Newly-promoted Arminia Bielefeld earned a point with a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on their return to the top flight in front of 6,500. Stuttgart, who also came up, gave Freiburg a scare with late goals by Sasa Kalajdzic and Silas Wamangituka as they fought back in a 3-2 defeat in front of 8,000."
64,18/09/2020,03:15,Sancho back for more at Dortmund despite United charm offensive,Jadon Sancho is set to show what Manchester United have so far missed out on when he spearheads Borussia Dortmund's challenge as the new Bundesliga season starts this weekend.,"Dortmund have spent the summer rebuffing interest from United and have insisted again and again they will not sell the England winger. After the 20-year-old netted a penalty in the 5-0 German Cup win at Duisburg on Monday, Sebastian Kehl, head of Dortmund's player department, repeated the club line that ""Jadon Sancho will play for Dortmund this season"". Sancho is likely to partner Norwegian goal-scoring phenomenon Erling Braut Haaland, another 20-year-old, at home against fellow Champions League qualifiers Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday at the start of the new league season. In an effort to protect their prize asset, Dortmund have slapped a price tag of 120 million euros ($144 million) on Sancho, who managed career-best figures of 17 goals and 16 assists last season in the Bundesliga as Dortmund finished second to Bayern Munich. British media spent the summer heavily linking Sancho to United, reporting they were dangling weekly wages of £250,000 on a five-year deal and that the player had already agreed terms to move to Old Trafford. Since securing Champions League qualification in July, United have been eager to sign Sancho, who is high on the wish list of manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Dortmund set a deadline of August 10 for United to meet their asking price. When that passed, the German club pointed to Sancho's contract, which he extended last year until 2023, including an undisclosed pay rise. ""We plan with Jadon. Jadon will play for BVB next season. The decision is final,"" sports director Michael Zorc made clear. However, much can happen before the transfer window closes in England and Germany on October 5. Dortmund must be careful that Sancho does not copy the tactic used by Ousmane Dembele and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who went on strike to force transfers to Barcelona in 2017 and Arsenal in 2018 respectively. Sancho demonstrated why Dortmund stubbornly want to keep him when he netted an early penalty in Monday's thrashing of Duisburg before new teenage signing Jude Bellingham, another Englishman, scored on his debut. He cost 26 million euros ($30 million) from English second-tier side Birmingham City in July and, aged 17 years, 77 days, became the youngest player to score in the German Cup. ""Look away, Manchester United"" was one headline in the British press after eye-catching displays by both Sancho and Bellingham, who the Old Trafford club reportedly also wanted to sign. Dortmund have a youthful look this season. Bellingham looked impressive alongside Axel Witsel in central midfield at Duisburg behind fellow 17-year-old Giovanni Reyna in the attacking midfield role. Reinier, an 18-year-old Brazilian, replaced Sancho to make his debut at the start of his two-year loan from Real Madrid. Sancho's partnership with Haaland, who scored 16 goals in 19 games since joining in January, is crucial if Dortmund are to stop Bayern Munich winning a ninth straight Bundesliga title. ""You can see when he scores goals and dribbles past players it looks so easy,"" Haaland said of Sancho in June. ""I played against him when I was 16 or 17 years old and he was exactly the same - dribbling past players. ""When I played against him, then he was the best player I played against, and now that I get to play with him, it's fantastic."""
65,17/09/2020,03:20,Five new signings to watch in the Bundesliga,The 2020/21 Bundesliga season kicks off on Friday when holders Bayern Munich launch their quest for a ninth straight league title at home to Schalke.,"AFP Sport looks at five new signings to look out for this season: <strong>Leroy Sane</strong> Bayern Munich paid Manchester City 45 million euros ($53 million) to bring Sane back to the Bundesliga and the Germany winger hopes to make his debut on Friday at home to Schalke 04, where he started his career. There is much pressure on the 24-year-old to show the star quality Bayern demand and realise his potential. Sane has a habit of occasionally drifting out of games and Bayern coach Hansi Flick has already challenged him to work on his defence. ""I have big goals with FC Bayern - and I want to show that people can completely rely on me,"" said Sane. <strong>Jude Bellingham</strong> The 17-year-old junior England international became the youngest scorer in the German Cup on Monday following his 26-million-euro transfer from Birmingham City when Duisburg were brushed aside 5-0 in the German Cup. The skilful central midfielder has already impressed his team-mates with his maturity, even though he only turns 18 next June. ""He is only 17, but he plays like a man,"" said Dortmund forward Thorgan Hazard after Bellingham's debut. ""He is a very good player to keep the balance between attack and defence. He can help us a lot."" Expect to see Bellingham link up with England winger Jadon Sancho and 20-year-old Norwegian striker Erling Braut Haaland. <strong>Hee-chan Hwang</strong> The South Korea striker has been signed from sister club Red Bull Salzburg for 15 million euros and has the tough task of replacing Timo Werner, who scored 34 goals last season before joining Chelsea. The 24-year-old is regarded as ""one of the biggest up-and-coming talents in South Korea"" by both Leipzig and Salzburg's former head coach Ralf Rangnick. He already opened his account for Leipzig by scoring and creating another goal in Saturday's 3-0 German Cup win over Nuremberg. Hwang scored just twice in 21 appearances at second division side Hamburg during an injury-hit loan spell in 2018/19. However, he managed 16 goals and 22 assists in 40 matches last season in helping Salzburg win an Austrian league and cup double. He impressed on the Champions League stage last season, scoring three goals and creating five more in the group stage, alongside future Dortmund star Haaland, as Salzburg gave both Liverpool and Napoli a run for their money. <strong>Tahith Chong</strong> Bremen just avoided relegation last season, but have boosted their attack by signing the 20-year-old winger on loan from Manchester United. The promising Netherlands Under-21 international from the Caribbean island of Curacao hit already hit the net for Bremen. ""Helping the team with your own qualities - that's what you want,"" said Chong after scoring on his debut last weekend in a 2-0 German Cup win over Carl Zeiss Jena. Chong followed in the footsteps of Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Marcus Rashford by being named United's Young Player of the Year in 2017/18 and was then voted the best reserve team player the following season. He broke into the United first team under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the second half of 2018/19 and wants regular first-team football at Bremen this term. He hopes to make his Bundesliga debut at home to Hertha Berlin on Saturday. <strong>Reinier</strong> Reinier Jesus Carvalho, 18, has been signed on a two-year loan deal from Real Madrid to bolster Dortmund's attacking midfield options. The Brazil Under-23 international will rival Julian Brandt and US starlet Giovanni Reyna, 17, for the role of deputy to club captain Marco Reus, who is working his way back from injury. Reiner made his Dortmund debut in Monday's thrashing of Duisburg as a second-half replacement for Sancho. ""Reinier's a player who brings enormous talent and can be used in various positions in attack,"" said Dortmund sports director Michael Zorc. ""We've been watching him for more than two years."""
66,14/09/2020,22:52,Bellingham scores on Dortmund bow in German Cup win,Seventeen-year-old Jude Bellingham scored on his debut for Borussia Dortmund in a 5-0 victory over third division Duisburg in the first round of the German Cup on Monday.,"Bellingham, who joined from Birmingham City in July, needed just 30 minutes to open his Dortmund account as he doubled the Bundesliga team's lead after a penalty from Jadon Sancho. Thorgan Hazard blasted in a free-kick to make it 3-0 when Duisburg defender Dominic Volkmer was sent off for bringing down Erling Haaland. England Under-21 international Bellingham was withdrawn at half-time before fellow teenager Gio Reyna added a fourth for Dortmund from another set-piece. Club captain Marco Reus made his first appearance since February following injury, netting within seconds of his introduction on the hour to cap the rout.

Media in the United Kingdom reported last week that United were close to signing the starlet. Reports of a switch to United became rife over the weekend after Sancho was spotted at a party in London before returning to Dortmund. In an interview last week, Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke ruled out a transfer of Sancho once their week-long camp in Switzerland started Monday."

Sancho is valued at around 120 million euros ($142 million) and Dortmund have said they have yet to receive an offer for their talented forward who joined in 2017 from Manchester City's academy. ""So far, there has been no contact between Borussia Dortmund and Manchester United in terms of Sancho,"" chief executive Watzke told Munich-based newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung. ""Not even indirectly or through so-called middlemen. ""There has never been an offer for Jadon, but there is a certain sum from us as to what should at least be paid,"" Watzke added, referring to the 120 million euros price tag.

""I expect Jadon to go to training camp on Monday (at Bad Ragaz, Switzerland) and play with us for the coming season,"" added Zorc. However, the transfer window in both Germany and England does not close until October 5, a date extended due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The German club posted a video on social media with first-team players singing the Beatles hit ""Hey Jude"". Midfielder Bellingham has long been linked with a move to Dortmund, having impressed at Birmingham over the last 12 months. A product of the club's own academy, he became Birmingham's youngest ever first-team debutant last August, and has since made three appearances for England Under-17s. His displays for the Midlands club also attracted the attention of Manchester United, who reportedly tried to sign him in January.

It was Schuerrle's extra-time cross in the 2014 World Cup final which Mario Goetze volleyed home to seal Germany's 1-0 win over Argentina. Schuerrle said Brazil 2014 was ""the best time of my life"" and saw being with the German national team as a safe haven. ""It was an escape from the rut that you have at your club every day,"" said Schuerrle. However, he admits he ""fell into a deep hole"" playing under Jose Mourinho during his two years at Stamford Bridge from 2013 until 2015. ""I didn't want to play football any more. I was completely finished,"" Schuerrle revealed. He returned to the Bundesliga in 2015 with Wolfsburg and a year later joined Dortmund for 30 million euros ($34 million), but it was not a successful move. After failing to win a first-team place and picking up injuries, Schuerrle was loaned out to Spartak Moscow last season after spending the 2018/19 season at Fulham. As far back as 2015 at Wolfsburg he had thoughts of ""throwing everything away"" and again came close to retiring at Dortmund when twice sidelined by injury in 2017. ""The social expectation is that you can't really stop until in your mid-30s,"" he added. The German media often refered to Schuerrle as a ""discarded world champion"", which hit him hard. ""There were things that I took very much to heart. You're either a fool or a hero. There is nothing in between,"" added Schuerrle, who made 57 appearances and scored 22 goals for Germany. He says he will take his time to decide on his future career and admits ""all the money I have earned is a huge relief""."

However, even though Dortmund gave him permission to play for PSG in the Champions League quarter-finals next month in Lisbon, Meunier claims the French club showed no interest. The 28-year-old slammed PSG's Brazilian sporting director Leonardo in an interview with German press agency DPA. ""Leonardo never attempted an agreement with Dortmund, let alone with me,"" said Meunier. ""Leonardo had contact with Dortmund, but was not interested in a possible loan fee up to the end of August."" He said he was particularly annoyed by comments Leonardo made in the French press. ""He told the press in France that I had refused to extend the (PSG) contract (into August), but that's not true -- I want to make that clear."" Meunier said he was told by PSG via a letter to stay away from club premises during the four-month coronavirus lockdown in France. He played for PSG in their last 16 first-leg 2-1 defeat in Dortmund in February, but was suspended for the return game which the French champions won 2-0 to progress to a quarter-final tie against Atalanta on August 12."

""We told him, 'If you want to play in the Champions League, it's OK for us',"" Watzke told Sport1. ""The quarter-finals of the Champions League is a hell of a level of football. ""If he wishes, we will have to negotiate the details with Paris. He is still thinking and we will try to resolve this matter with Paris."" PSG beat Dortmund 3-2 on aggregate in the last 16 to reach the quarter-finals before the coronavirus lockdown, with the Champions League set to be concluded with a 'final eight' tournament in Lisbon in August. The Ligue 1 champions also have French Cup and French League Cup finals to play at the end of July. Meunier originally opted not to extend his PSG contract by a few weeks in order to join Dortmund, who finished a distant second in the Bundesliga this term behind Bayern Munich."
74,27/06/2020,20:33,Dortmund unable to keep loan star Hakimi,"Morocco international Achraf Hakimi will leave Borussia Dortmund this summer after two years on loan from Real Madrid, the Bundesliga club's sporting director Michael Zorc said Saturday.","Hakimi, 21, has drawn reported interest from Inter Milan and could be sold for around 40 million euros ($45 million) after an impressive past season with Dortmund. He scored five goals and provided 10 assists in the Bundesliga while displaying his versatility at both right and left-back as well as in a more advanced position. Zorc, who was initially hopeful of retaining Hakimi, said the asking price for the Madrid-born player had risen again. ""We don't want to go there, we can't"" keep him, said a rueful Zorc."

Florian Kohfeldt's Werder will face second-tier opponents in either Heidenheim or possibly neighbours, rivals and fellow fallen giants Hamburg in the play-off first leg on Thursday. Bremen have spent more seasons than any other team in the Bundesliga, having only spent one term in the second tier, in 1980-81. A burst of goals from Osako, Milot Rashica and Niclas Fuellkrug -- all in the space of eight minutes -- had Werder 3-0 up at the break against Cologne at the Weserstadion. Former Everton midfielder Davy Klaassen then fired home a rebound just after the break before Osako, facing his old side, added his second and USA international Josh Sargent completed the rout. Dominick Drexler pulled a goal back for Cologne. Werder, the four-time Bundesliga champions, also needed a favour from Berlin and got one as Union beat Fortuna 3-0 with goals from Nigerian duo Anthony Ujah and Suleiman Abdullahi either side of veteran midfielder Christian Gentner's effort. Bremen will find out their play-off opponents on Sunday, with Heidenheim currently in the play-off place ahead of the final round of matches in the second division. At Wolfsburg, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski scored a penalty for his 34th league goal of the season, finishing as the top scorer for the fifth time. Kingsley Coman, Michael Cuisance and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet as Bayern, champions for the eighth straight season, finished 13 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Mueller set up Coman for Bayern's opening goal to finish the campaign with a league record 21 assists, and his goal that rounded out the win was also Bayern's 100th league goal this season -- one short of the Bundesliga record. Wolfsburg captain Josuha Guilavogui was sent off for a second yellow card after fouling Cuisance, leading to Lewandowski's penalty. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach and RB Leipzig secured qualification for next season's Champions League after 2-1 wins over Hertha Berlin and Augsburg respectively, as fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen missed out by two points despite beating Mainz 1-0. Dortmund, who had already wrapped up second place, crashed to a 4-0 home defeat by Hoffenheim, for whom Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric scored all four goals, including one penalty. That result allowed Hoffenheim to leapfrog Wolfsburg and take sixth place, although both sides will go into the Europa League next season along with Leverkusen. Before kick-off in Dortmund, Mario Goetze, whose winning goal sealed Germany's victory in the 2014 World Cup final, was given a send-off by the club. He will leave this summer with his contract having expired, but the 28-year-old attacking midfielder has not announced his future club. Elsewhere, Timo Werner signed off with a brace in RB Leipzig's 2-1 win at Augsburg in what was his final appearance for the club before moving to Chelsea. Schalke's disastrous second half of the season was completed with a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Freiburg as they finished the season 12th, having been third in December. Eintracht Frankfurt beat bottom side Paderborn 3-2 in Saturday's other game."

Haaland, 19, has scored 16 goals in 17 games for Dortmund since joining from RB Salzburg at the start of the year. He has netted 44 times in 39 matches this season across spells with both clubs. Dortmund defender Mats Hummels has insisted next season's goal is to finish ""one place higher"" than second behind Bayern in the league, with Haaland expressing a similar thirst for silverware. ""I want to achieve something with BVB (Dortmund), not just be second all the time, but win titles if I can,"" Haaland told the Funke Media Group, ahead of Saturday's final league game at home to Hoffenheim. ""We should set ourselves goals, we want to attack."" Bayern were last denied the Bundesliga title in 2011 and 2012 when Jurgen Klopp steered Dortmund to consecutive league crowns. Haaland's goals have attracted the attention of Europe's top clubs, but he hopes to see out his Dortmund contract -- which runs until 2024 -- providing his hunger for titles is sated. ""I don't think too much about the future, I live in the present. That's why I decided to join BVB (Dortmund) this winter with full conviction,"" he said.

""His experience will do us a lot of good."" The 28-year-old right back will link up with Belgian national team-mates Axel Witsel and Thorgan Hazard under Swiss head coach Lucien Favre. After four years in France, Meunier says he is looking for a new challenge with Dortmund, who have finished runners-up in the Bundesliga for the last two seasons. ""Borussia Dortmund plays exactly the kind of football I want to play: exciting, authentic and natural,"" said Meunier in a statement. ""I'm ambitious and I want to win titles with Dortmund just like I did with Brugge and Paris,"" he added having won three French League titles with PSG and the 2015/16 Belgian league. The transfer means that Meunier will not feature for PSG in the Champions League quarter-finals when the competition resumes this August in Lisbon. He faced Dortmund when PSG lost the first-leg clash 2-1 away in the last 16, but the French club went through after winning the return leg 2-0 in Paris, for which Meunier was suspended. Dortmund are reportedly also on the verge of signing England Under-17 prospect Jude Bellingham from Birmingham City."

We want to go on the attack,"" Zorc said ahead of Dortmund's final game this season at home to Hoffenheim on Saturday. There is a year left on Favre's contract, but there has been speculation he may leave as his Dortmund side has finished second to Bayern for the last two league seasons. Last season, under Favre, Dortmund led by as many as nine points and topped the table as late as April before finishing runners up by two points. This season they will again finish second, but trail Bayern by ten points going into this weekend's final round of matches. Bayern have won their last 15 matches, including a 1-0 victory at Dortmund at the end of May which effectively decided the league. Hansi Flick's Bayern have 79 points before their final match at Wolfsburg on Saturday, after which they will be crowned league champions for the eighth season running. ""If Bayern Munich have over 80 points, it would be hard for us, and any other team in Germany, to finish ahead of them,"" Zorc admitted. A former central midfielder who made 468 appearances for Dortmund during his career, the 57-year-old Zorc extended his contract as sports director on Wednesday until 2022. He did rule out extending Favre's contract past next year. ""We have a great relationship of trust internally and will have the talks in due course,"" Zorc added when asked about extending Favre's deal."

Bundesliga rules stipulate that players must limit contact outside their club, meaning Goetze will miss Dortmund's last league match of the season against Hoffenheim on Saturday. Goetze, who scored the winner for Germany in the 2014 World Cup final, does not have enough time to return two negative tests for the virus, which would have allowed him to be in the squad. But Dortmund say Goetze will still get an official send-off on Saturday after 219 appearances in two separate spells for Dortmund, who he helped win the 2011 and 2012 Bundesliga titles. His final game for the club was a brief substitute appearance in last month's 1-0 home defeat by newly-crowned champions Bayern Munich, which effectively ended the title race. Goetze has failed to hold down a first-team place at either ex-club Bayern Munich or Dortmund, who he rejoined in 2016, since his moment of World Cup glory in Brazil. He has played the full 90 minutes just once this season. It is still unclear where Goetze will play next season, with Spain or Italy touted in the German media as the most likely destinations."

Last Saturday, Erling Braut Haaland scored twice in a 2-0 win at RB Leipzig, which confirmed Dortmund's second place. In post-match interviews, Hummels, who spent three years at Bayern before returning to Dortmund in 2019, insisted ""we want to finish one place higher next season"". Bayern stalwart Mueller, 30, who has won the Bundesliga title nine times in his career, said the champions relished hearing how they can expect another fight for the title with Dortmund next season. ""Absolutely. Dortmund have a squad that can be dangerous to us,"" Mueller told magazine Sport Bild. ""The competition in the past two years can be rated much higher than usual. ""I can understand Mats's comments,"" added Mueller who was in the same Germany team as Hummels which won the 2014 World Cup title. ""At FC Bayern, we want a competitor who stands up and says: 'Hey, by the way, we also want to become German champions'."" Dortmund were the last team to deny Bayern the title, which they managed the feat under Jurgen Klopp in 2011 and 2012, but since then the Bundesliga shield has exclusively gone to Munich. Mueller could not resist teasing Dortmund, where leaders Bayern claimed a key 1-0 win at the end of May which allowed them to open a seven-point lead to effectively decide the title race. ""What makes it so special, after a 1-0 win in Dortmund, is that we can really, really enjoy it,"" added Mueller. The attacking midfielder, who has made 529 appearances for the club since his debut in 2008/09, hopes Bayern extend their domination for the rest of his time in Munich. ""I can only talk about the next three years. This is how long my contract runs for,"" he added. ""I will do everything possible to make it happen. ""I have to say, from a neutral point of view, one does miss the fiercely contested title races, won in the last minute. ""But I'm not responsible for making it exciting."""

They say that Dortmund have fended off interest from Tottenham, Arsenal, Napoli and Valencia for the 28-year-old, who will be a free agent at the end of the month. The move would mean Meunier not taking part in the rest of PSG's Champions League campaign, which is due to resume in August at the 'Final Eight' tournament to be held in Lisbon. Meunier's prospects of a starting place at Dortmund will be helped by Achraf Hakimi's expected return to Real Madrid when his two-year loan deal ends at the end of the season. Dortmund are also reportedly close to signing exciting teenage midfielder Bellingham for 22 million euros ($25 million) from English Championship side Birmingham. After the success of Jadon Sancho, who broke into the England team in 2018 on the back of his Dortmund performances, Bellingham, who turns 17 next Monday, is set to be the latest Englishman to follow in his footsteps. Bellingham's displays for Birmingham also attracted the attention of Manchester United, who reportedly tried to sign him in January."

Instead, Dortmund, which has club offices in Shanghai and Singapore, intends to offer Asian fans the chance to meet the players online and watch live streamed training sessions held in Germany. Dortmund also plans to hold a series of events at venues across Asia, providing local restrictions due to COVID-19 are met. The 2020/21 Bundesliga is due to begin mid September and with Dortmund knocked out of the Champions League, which will resume in August, the German club wants to use the time to prepare for next season and link up online with 30 fan clubs across south-east Asia. In a statement, Dortmund's manager director Carsten Cramer said that after the original tour was cancelled, ""many fans and partners"" in Asia had approached them about an alternative. ""This gave rise to the idea of Dortmund, in close cooperation with our offices in Singapore and Shanghai, being sent digitally to Asia,"" he added. Fans in China will be able to live-stream a training session with Chinese commentary and an on-site reporter who will quiz players in an online meet-and-greet."

""I told Jonny before the game to believe in this chance. He's a very hard-working guy, his heart is in the right place, but he has had to be patient this season,"" Mainz coach Achim Beierlorzer told Sky. The goal sparked a season-saving performance for Mainz, who later doubled the lead through a Jean-Philippe Mateta penalty to put clear daylight between themselves and the drop zone. ""These three points are worth double. It's not over yet but we took a huge step in the right direction,"" Mainz defender Jean-Paul Boetius said. With Champions League qualification secured and Bayern already crowned champions, second-placed Dortmund had little to play for, and they barely threatened the visitors' goal as the clock ticked down. With two games still to play, Mainz now have a five-point lead over the bottom three after Fortuna Duesseldorf snatched a late 2-2 draw at RB Leipzig Two curling strikes from Kevin Kampl and Timo Werner appeared to have condemned Duesseldorf to the bottom three, but late goals from Steven Skrzybski and Andre Hoffmann saw Uwe Roesler's side rescue a crucial point late on. They remain third from bottom in the relegation play-off place, just a single point above Werder Bremen in the race to avoid automatic relegation. Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen broke back into the top four with a 3-1 win over local rivals Cologne. Sven Bender turned in a low corner from Leon Bailey at the near post to give Leverkusen an early lead, and talisman Havertz added a second shortly before half-time. Sebastiaan Bornauw's second-half header gave Cologne brief hope, but it was extinguished late on by a fine individual goal from Moussa Diaby. The race for the Champions League remains finely poised, with just a single point separating Leverkusen and fifth placed Borussia Moenchengladbach ahead of the final two games. Earlier, a 2-1 defeat away to Eintracht Frankfurt saw David Wagner's Schalke side extend their winless streak to 14 games. A new club record as of last weekend, the dismal run has seen Schalke plummet from the top four to mid-table. Goals either side of half time from Andre Silva and David Abraham saw a dominant Frankfurt take a comfortable two-goal lead, before US international Weston McKennie headed Schalke back into the game on the hour mark. While Schalke continue to sink, Frankfurt are hoping to make a late charge for European qualification. They now sit four points behind the coveted seventh spot. ""Our aim has to be to pick up six points and hope that the two teams ahead of us slip up,"" Frankfurt midfielder Sebastian Rode told broadcaster DAZN. Yet it is Hoffenheim who now look the favourites to claim the final Europa League spot, after they fought to a 3-1 win over Augsburg on Wednesday. A quickfire brace from Munas Dabbur and a late prod from Ihlas Bebou were enough to take the three points from Augsburg, who were given brief hope by Ruben Vargas' second-half header."

Bayern Munich lead second-placed Dortmund by seven points with three games to play, and victory at Werder Bremen on Tuesday would secure an eighth consecutive Bundesliga title. Norway international Haaland has scored 11 goals in 12 league games since arriving from Salzburg in January, but he has been struggling with a knee injury of late. With a top-four finish guaranteed, Favre said Haaland is unlikely to start at home to relegation-threatened Mainz on Wednesday. ""He is 19. It's normal that he is sometimes tired,"" Favre said in Monday's press conference. ""He's still growing up, has been injured two or three times since he's been here. ""We have to be careful and dose out what he does. Otherwise it will be dangerous."" Just as he did in Duesseldorf, Julian Brandt is set to start up front instead of Haaland against Mainz. ""We have a plan with him (Haaland),"" explained Favre. ""It is impossible for many players to play three games in one week,"" the Swiss added, with Dortmund also facing third-placed RB Leipzig away this Saturday. ""We need him. I like his mentality, he always wants to play, he always wants to win. ""Of course he still has to develop and has so much potential."""

""It's a bit of a lucky thing that we were able to walk away with the win today,"" admitted Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki. The result leaves second-placed Dortmund four points behind leaders Bayern, who host fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach later Saturday. Haaland, 19, came on with half an hour left and was involved in the build-up when Raphael Guerreiro had a 65th-minute goal disallowed after the VAR spotted the Portuguese international had played the ball with his upper arm. However, with time almost up, Haaland leapt to flick his header into the Fortuna net for his 14th goal for Dortmund in 15 games since joining from Red Bull Salzburg in January. Dortmund had endured a nervous final 10 minutes before Haaland struck as Duesseldorf substitute Steven Skrzybski twice hit the post and fired wide. ""I am not often speechless, but today I am,"" said Duesseldorf coach Uwe Roesler. ""We played very well and ran almost nine kilometres more. ""We didn't allow them much - except for the goal."" Duesseldorf's defeat boosted second-from-bottom Werder Bremen, who are now level with Fortuna on 28 points following their 5-1 thumping of bottom side Paderborn. With Bundesliga matches played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus pandemic, home advantage again counted for little with four victories going to the away team in the afternoon's five games. Bremen responded to back-to-back home defeats with an emphatic away victory in pouring rain as Davy Klaassen netted either side of a goal by Japanese forward Yuya Osako to make it 3-0 at half-time. It could have been 4-0 as Bremen forward Milot Rashica had a penalty saved. Midfielder Maximilian Eggestein made it 4-0 with an hour gone before Paderborn's Moroccan-born substitute Abdelhamid Sabiri scored their consolation goal. Just 15 minutes after coming on for his first appearance for nine months after tearing knee ligaments, Bremen striker Niclas Fuellkrug capped a fairytale return when he slotted home the fifth goal on 90 minutes. ""I could feel the team is able to withstand the pressure,"" said their coach Florian Kohfeldt, who praised Bremen for keeping cool despite Rashica's early saved penalty. With three games left to stay up, Bremen host Bayern on Tuesday, then Mainz, who are also fighting to survive, and mid-table Cologne. Ten-man Hertha Berlin were thumped 4-1 at home by Eintracht Frankfurt after their Belgium defender Dedryck Boyata was sent off on the stroke of half-time for bringing down Bas Dost, who was through on goal. Krzysztof Piatek gave Hertha an early lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, but Frankfurt roared back with unanswered goals by Dost, two from Portuguese forward Andre Silva and French defender Evan Ndicka. Freiburg came from two goals down to earn a 2-2 draw at Wolfsburg in a game dominated by VAR. Wolfsburg raced into a 2-0 lead inside 30 minutes when Dutch striker Wout Weghorst finished off a sweeping move, then converted a penalty. Weghorst also had his head heavily bandaged after an accidental kick in the face. Wolfsburg had two goals by Daniel Ginczek ruled out by the VAR and it finished 2-1 at half-time as Freiburg pulled a goal back through midfielder Lucas Hoefler. Hungarian Roland Sallai equalised just after the break. After picking up just two points in their previous five games since the Bundesliga restart in mid-May, FC Union got their fist win since February with a 2-1 win at Cologne. Goals by defender Marvin Friedrich and midfielder Christian Gentner sealed the victory which pulled Union up to 13th, seven points from the bottom three."

Dortmund players also donned T-shirts with slogans against racism and police brutality during their pre-match warm-up. Elsewhere on Saturday, Bayern Munich players wore black armbands with the message ""Black Lives Matter"", while Mainz striker Pierre Kunde Malong took a knee after scoring in his side's 2-0 win over Frankfurt."

The German league (DFL) said in a statement: ""The players from Borussia Dortmund had obviously violated general hygiene and infection protection standards at home hairdressing appointments and in particular the medical-organisational concept of the DFL task force. ""There is no question that professional footballers also have to have their hair cut. However, this currently has to be done in accordance with the medical-organisational concept."" The German football federation (DFB) decided on Wednesday it would not fine Sancho for lifting his Dortmund shirt to reveal a t-shirt bearing the message ""Justice For George Floyd"" during the win against Paderborn last weekend. The death of Floyd, a black American, as a white policemen kneeled on his neck in Minneapolis has sparked days of protests in cities across the United States and in other countries. The Bundesliga became the first of the major European football leagues to resume on May 17, following the coronavirus shutdown. Players and coaches must follow strict health guidelines, including regular testing and only remaining with family members or teammates in between matches."

""Yesterday, we were all disappointed, but my words in the interview directly after the game seem to have been misunderstood in many cases,"" with several German media outlets speculating about his future. Favre's attitude was very different to his crestfallen demeanour immediately after Tuesday's 1-0 home loss to Bayern, thanks to Joshua Kimmich's deft chip just before half-time. The defeat came on the back of a 4-0 drubbing at the hands of Bayern last November at Munich's Allianz Arena. On Tuesday night, Favre gave a rueful grin when asked if the latest defeat proved he does not have what it takes to lead Dortmund to break Bayern's monopoly on the German league. ""That's been said here for months,"" Favre had said. ""I know how these things go and I will talk about it in a few weeks. ""I'm staying calm and I trust in myself."" On Wednesday, Dortmund sports director Michael Zorc told broadcaster Sport1 that the club's senior bosses ""are certainly not having a debate"" about whether Favre should stay. Zorc conceded that Favre ""must have expressed himself in a misleading fashion immediately after the match"", but insisted the ambiguities had now been explained ""very clearly"". For the second season running under Favre, 62, second-placed Dortmund find themselves wanting at the tail end of the campaign with Bayern now firmly on course for an eighth straight league title. According to German daily Bild on Wednesday, Dortmund's bosses made contact ""in the past few months"" with Niko Kovac, who was sacked by Bayern in November, as a possible successor to Favre. After Favre hinted that he may leave, Germany and Bayern legend and Sky pundit Lothar Matthaeus commented ""as soon as I heard that, I thought 'Favre will leave and Kovac will come'."" On Wednesday, Favre responded by telling Bild he found Matthaeus' suggestion ""incredible and not acceptable for me"". ""I am happy in Dortmund, I have a contract until 2021 and I definitely want to be on the bench next season,"" Favre added. Bild also say that RB Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann is Dortmund's ideal candidate, but the 32-year-old is under contract until 2023. Favre has, however, all but waved the white flag on bridging the gap in the table, even though Bayern must still face Borussia Moenchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen, who have already both beaten them this season. ""It's going to be difficult - seven points (to make up) in six games, that is brutally hard,"" said Favre after Tuesday's defeat to Bayern. The Swiss fell offside with Dortmund fans last season when he conceded the 2018-19 title race was ""over"" after a 4-2 home loss to Schalke left them three points behind Bayern with three games left."
90,26/05/2020,22:12,"Flick's delight as Bayern take ""big step"" towards title","Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick said they took ""a big step"" towards an eighth straight Bundesliga title on Tuesday as their 1-0 win at Borussia Dortmund opened a seven-point lead with six games left.","Midfielder Joshua Kimmich settled an edgy affair with a deft chip over home goalkeeper Roman Buerki just before half-time at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park stadium behind closed doors. ""It was an important win, we took a big step forward,"" said Flick, who only stepped into the head coach role when Niko Kovac was sacked in November. Flick was assistant when Germany won the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but the 55-year-old is on the verge of his first club title as a head coach. ""Will I win my first coaching title? I'm not a man who reads too much into the future,"" said Flick bashfully. ""I'm very happy with the team's performance, they were focused, attentive, bold."" Match-winner Kimmich revealed that his chip over Buerki was the product of pre-match analysis. ""We knew that Buerki always stands well in front of his goal,"" said the Germany international. ""It's the best goal of my career and a very important one. ""Everyone knew how important those three points were, and now we have a comfortable lead. ""It's going to be mentally difficult for Dortmund, although we still have to confirm things in the next few games too."" Bayern must still clear two tricky hurdles in the coming weeks, against Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Moenchengladbach who have already beaten the Bavarians in the league this season. Dortmund captain Mats Hummels acknowledged they have to win all their remaining matches and hope Bayern slip up. ""We now have to try and win the six remaining games, but from now on, Bayern have their fate in their own hands, whether they win or lose,"" admitted Hummels, who left Bayern last June. Dortmund coach Lucien Favre fended off questions about whether he is the reason why his side is on the verge of falling short in the title race for the second successive season. Under Favre, Dortmund squandered a nine-point lead in 2018/19 as Bayern finished up winning the league with a cushion of two points. Dortmund striker Erling Braut Haaland had a shot cleared off the line in the opening minute, but the teenager could not add to his ten goals in as many games and limped off twenty minutes from time. ""Over 90 minutes we did really well, but we should have done more with the ball,"" said Favre. ""There was a lack of precision and a little more movement. ""We had too few shots on goal. ""Of course, everyone knows that we miss the fans,"" Favre added as Dortmund missed the chance to turn up the heat on the Bavarians without the backing of their huge support."
91,26/05/2020,20:59,Bayern Munich down Dortmund to close on Bundesliga title,"Bayern Munich took a huge step towards an eighth straight German Bundesliga on Tuesday as a sublime Joshua Kimmich chip gave them a 1-0 win at nearest rivals Borussia Dortmund, moving them seven points clear at the top with just six games left.","Kimmich's brilliant goal came just before half-time in this encounter played behind closed doors at the Signal Iduna Park, as Dortmund missed the chance to turn up the heat in the title race without the backing of their huge support. Bayern had already won 4-0 when the teams met in Munich in November and they kept up their excellent recent record in the 'Klassiker', even if this was a much tighter contest. Dortmund's star teenage striker, Erling Braut Haaland, who had scored ten goals in as many league games, failed to make an impact against Bayern's watertight defence before going off injured in the second half. Jerome Boateng and David Alaba gave him no room, while Kimmich and Leon Goretzka in midfield made sure passes intended for him rarely met their mark. The Norwegian limped off with 20 minutes left after a heavy tackle from Boateng. The result means that 11 of the 19 games played since the Bundesliga returned behind closed doors following the coronavirus shutdown have been won by the away team. Things might have been different, with Haaland coming close inside the first minute with an audacious attempt through the legs of Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer which was cleared off the line by Boateng. At the other end, Lukasz Piszczek cleared a Serge Gnabry shot away from in front of the line, while moments later Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki denied Kingsley Coman. Bayern were in control, and Kimmich grabbed what proved to be the winner two minutes before half-time when he spotted Buerki off his line and chipped in from 20 yards. It was the Germany international's third league goal from outside the box this season. In an attempt to turn the game around, Dortmund coach Lucien Favre brought on midfield enforcer Emre Can at the start of the second half and added the pace of Jadon Sancho on the wing. The home side had a shout for a penalty just before the hour mark when a Haaland shot was deflected wide by the arm of Boateng, but nothing was given. Shortly after, Haaland limped off to be replaced by 17-year-old Giovanni Reyna. In a last throw of the dice, Favre brought on 2014 World Cup winner Mario Goetze, who is out of contract next month and set to leave, in the dying stages in the vain hope of grabbing an equaliser. With time running out, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski hit the post. The league's top scorer then had a strong appeal for a late penalty waved away after a push in the area by Dortmund defender Manuel Akanji. But the roars of celebration at the end came from the Bayern bench and echoed around the near-empty stadium."
92,25/05/2020,17:50,Young pretender Haaland takes on master Lewandowski for first time,One of world football's fastest-rising young stars goes head-to-head with one of its most accomplished goalscorers on Tuesday as Erling Braut Haaland and Robert Lewandowski face off for the first time.,"Borussia Dortmund host Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich in a top-of-the-table clash which will see 19-year-old Haaland and the man 12 years his senior both try to maintain remarkable runs of form. Both players have scored exactly 41 goals in 35 matches in all competitions this season, although Haaland only joined Dortmund in January from Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg. Bayern coach Hansi Flick, whose side are four points clear of Dortmund, believes close comparisons between the two are premature, but acknowledged Haaland's obvious ability. ""Haaland is in his first season... Robert has been evolving for several years at the top level,"" he said. ""But Haaland has huge talent."" Before the Champions League was suspended in March due to the coronavirus, Haaland was second only to Lewandowski in the competition's goalscoring charts, one behind the Pole's tally of 11. Lewandowski's haul included four goals in just 14 second-half minutes during a 6-0 group-stage rout of Red Star Belgrade last November, bringing back memories of his astonishing five goals in nine minutes against Wolfsburg in 2015. Haaland scored eight goals for Salzburg in the group stage and two for Dortmund in their last-16 defeat by Paris Saint-Germain. Lewandowski has netted 27 goals in 25 Bundesliga matches and is on track to be crowned the league's top-scorer for the fifth time in 10 seasons. Haaland has netted 10 league goals in as many games but his ratio -- a goal every 69 minutes -- is even better than Lewandowski's 82 minutes. Both Haaland and Lewandowski are discreet about their lives off the pitch and appear happier to let their goalscoring feats speak for themselves. ""He's one of those guys who's really into training,"" Dortmund defender Mats Hummels said of Haaland, who has a habit of giving short answers in interviews. ""I like the way he approaches work at his age,"" Hummels added. Lewandowski is known for preferring to spend time in the gym rather than on the red carpet. ""In his head, he thinks about the right food, sleep and training: 24 hours a day,"" former Bayern coach Pep Guardiola said. ""He is always there, never injured, because he focuses on these things."" That focus perhaps allows the pair to be so ruthless in front of goal. In January, Haaland became the first player to score a hat-trick as a substitute on their Bundesliga debut, and was also the third-youngest player, behind Wayne Rooney and Raul, to score a Champions League treble, aged 19 years and 58 days, last September. Lewandowski is also remembered for some jaw-dropping individual performances among a career built on consistent goalscoring. He set multiple records with his remarkable burst against Wolfsburg five years ago and also scored four goals when a Dortmund player in the 2013 Champions League semi-final first leg against Real Madrid. Like Haaland, Lewandowski's first major European club was Dortmund, who he joined as a raw 20-year-old in 2010 from Polish side Lech Poznan for a fee of 4.5 million euros ($4.9 million). He also wasted little time in breaking into the side and helped Dortmund win the 2011 and 2012 Bundesliga titles under Jurgen Klopp. He memorably scored a hat-trick against future employers Bayern in a 5-2 German Cup final thrashing in 2012. Haaland has taken to life in Dortmund even more quickly than Lewandowski, though, scoring 13 goals in his first 13 games for the club, including the first goal of the resumed season in a 4-0 win against Schalke. In contrast, Lewandowski could only manage nine goals in 43 appearances in his debut season in 2010/11. The teenager has plenty still to do to emulate his older counterpart, though, as the Bayern star has since scored 326 club goals across the following nine campaigns. But Lewandowski himself thinks Haaland could keep up his incredible form. ""Haaland has huge potential, but also time,"" he said. ""If he works hard, he can become a better player and reach the top level."" cpb-ryj/jc/gj <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org>"
93,25/05/2020,11:53,Hummels '99 percent' ready for Dortmund's showdown with Bayern,Second-placed Borussia Dortmund are set to include chief defender Mats Hummels for Tuesday's Bundesliga showdown at home to league leaders Bayern Munich behind closed doors with stars Jadon Sancho and Axel Witsel also poised to return.,"""With Mats, it's okay. We have to look at the short term, but he is 99 percent there,"" said Dortmund coach Lucien Favre in Monday's press conference. Centre-back Hummels limped out of Saturday's 2-0 win at Wolfsburg after 45 minutes with an aggravated Achilles tendon, but is poised to marshall Dortmund's defence against his former club Bayern. In the two matches since the league resumed after a two-month hiatus, Dortmund have not conceded a goal after hammering Schalke 4-0 and winning 2-0 at Wolfsburg. Bayern hold a four-point lead at the top of the table and are eager to again assert their domination over Dortmund, who they trounced 4-0 when the sides met last November in Munich. Favre said both Belgium midfield enforcer Axel Witsel and England winger Jadon Sancho could also feature after working their way back to fitness. Witsel has shaken off a muscular injury, while Sancho proved his fitness after a calf injury by setting up a goal for Achraf Hakimi in his 25 minutes off the bench at Wolfsburg. ""Axel has trained with the ball again - he could be in the squad,"" said Favre. Sancho ""is slowly getting back to his old level, has trained well. I don't see any problem. We'll see,"" added Favre. Bayern are on course for an eighth straight league title and warmed up for their visit to Dortmund brushing aside Eintracht Frankfurt 5-2 at home on Saturday. The visitors managed to rattle the Bavarian giants with two second-half goals from corners to make it 3-2 before the hosts pulled away again. ""Bayern can concede two goals from corners - that can happen to any team, so it's not really relevant for me,"" insisted Favre when asked if Frankfurt had exposed a weakness. Dortmund have won their last two home games against Bayern - a 3-2 league win in November 2018 and a 2-0 victory in the Super Cup last August. However, Dortmund's 82,000-capacity Signal Iduna Park stadium will be devoid of fans due to hygiene measures to counter the coronavirus. In the first two rounds of Bundesliga matches since it became the first top European league to restart, 10 of the first 18 matches have been won by the away team. ""We have to believe in ourselves, we can't make simple mistakes in possession of the ball,"" said Dortmund sports director Michael Zorc. ""We also have to endure the phases when Bayern dominate. ""We can always score goals and beat them,"" he added, with Norwegian striker Erling Braut Haaland, 19, on 10 goals in 10 league games since joining in January."

""For us this is a very decisive week,"" insisted Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. ""We've clearly set ourselves the goal of three victories this week and taking a giant step forward"" towards the league title. Bayern warmed-up by beating Eintracht Frankfurt 5-2 at the weekend and also host relegation-threatened Fortuna Duesseldorf this Saturday. Since the Bundesliga resumed ten days ago, behind locked doors due to the coronavirus, home advantage has counted for little with 10 of the 18 games played won by the away team. Bayern and Dortmund are among only three clubs -- the other being Hertha Berlin who thrashed neighbours FC Union 4-0 on Friday -- to have won at home since the restart. Hansi Flick's Bayern are eager to continue the trend and again assert their dominance over Dortmund, who they routed 4-0 in Munich last November. ""We're looking forward to Tuesday - I hope that we can show what makes us strong and leave Dortmund's stadium with a smile,"" added Mueller. Signal Iduna Park would normally be packed with 82,000 fans for a visit of Bayern, but the terraces will remain empty on Tuesday. ""It will still be a hard day's work,"" Mueller added. ""We're marching, Dortmund is marching."" Dortmund winger Raphael Guerreiro is in form with three goals in his last two games and was on the scoresheet in Saturday's 2-0 win at Wolfsburg. The Portugal star also netted twice in the 4-0 rout of arch rivals Schalke the previous weekend in the Ruhr derby. Dortmund are waiting on the fitness of key defender Mats Hummels, who injured his Achilles' tendon at Wolfsburg. In the Bayern camp, midfielder Thiago Alcantara has a groin strain while centre-back Jerome Boateng picked up a leg knock on Saturday. Having beaten Bayern 2-0 at home in the pre-season Super Cup match last August and 3-2 in the league in November 2018, Dortmund are eager to again send the Bavarians home disappointed. ""I hope we can get the next victory,"" said Dortmund's Swiss centre-back Manuel Akanji. ""Since I've been here, we've always lost to Bayern away, but won at home. I want to keep this series going."" Tuesday's showdown will also pit the league's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski, 31, who has scored 27 goals in 25 games for Bayern, against his former club. For the hosts, Norwegian sensation Erling Braut Haaland, 19, has scored ten goals in as many league games since joining Dortmund in January from Salzburg. Haaland and Lewandowski have exactly the same record - 41 goals from 35 games in all competitions this season. England winger Jadon Sancho came off the bench to set up Achrif Hakimi for the second goal in Wolfsburg. Dortmund coach Lucien Favre has hinted the 20-year-old could start against Bayern. On Wednesday, third-placed RB Leipzig host Hertha Berlin in the day's key game. Germany striker Timo Werner warmed up with a hat-trick in Sunday's 5-0 thumping of Mainz. He had also scored a hat-trick in an 8-0 mauling of Mainz last November."

""Mats has a problem with his Achilles tendon and we hope he can play on Tuesday,"" said Dortmund sports director Michael Zorc. ""He has had the problem for a while."" Hummels was treated at Dortmund's training ground on Sunday and if he is not fit, Emre Can, who replaced Hummels in Wolfsburg, will deputise against Bayern. In the Munich squad, there are question marks over midfielder Thiago Alcantara and defender Jerome Boateng. Alcantara sat out Saturday's 5-2 thrashing of Eintracht Frankfurt in Munich with a groin strain,. Boateng came off late in the second-half with a muscular knock.

On Tuesday, Dortmund host defending champions Bayern -- who host Eintracht Frankfurt later on Saturday -- in a showdown behind closed doors. This was the second weekend of the Bundesliga's restart, following a two-month hiatus, as the first top European league to resume during the coronavirus pandemic. A minute's silence was held before kick-off in the afternoon's four matches to remember the victims of COVID-19, which has so far claimed 8,216 lives in Germany. In Wolfsburg, Portugal winger Guerreiro, who netted twice in last week's 4-0 derby thrashing of Schalke, scored his third goal in two games to open the scoring in the 32nd minute. Erling Braut Haaland, who had scored 10 goals in nine league games since joining in January from Red Bull Salzburg, mistimed his attempt to meet the cross, but Guerreiro was on hand to tap home. With the players calls echoing around the near-empty stadium, Dortmund had a let off early in the second-half when Wolfsburg winger Renato Steffen clipped the crossbar. England winger Jadon Sancho helped sealed the win when he dribbled at the Wolfsburg defence, then laid a pass off to Hakimi, who fired home 12 minutes from time. In the final minutes, Wolfsburg had replacement Felix Klaus sent off for fouling Hakimi. Bayer Leverkusen built on Monday's drubbing of Werder Bremen by moving up to third place with a 3-1 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach, who dropped to fourth. With the terraces at Borussia Park decked with 13,000 cardboard cut-outs of home fans, Leverkusen's rising star Kai Havertz, who also scored twice in the 4-1 rout of Bremen, again netted twice. Playing up front as a striker, the 20-year-old Germany winger darted onto Karim Bellarabi's pass into the area and fired home with seven minutes played. French forward Marcus Thuram levelled with his eighth league goal of the season for Gladbach just after the break. Havertz netted a penalty soon after when the video assistant referee spotted a foul on Bellarabi in the area, before Sven Bender unwittingly sealed the win with his shoulder nine minutes from time. Second-from-bottom Werder Bremen gained a valuable win in the relegation fight with a 1-0 win at Freiburg to claim their first victory in eight league games. Midfielder Leon Bittencourt hit the winner in the 19th minute when his long-range shot flew hit the far corner. In the action-packed dying stages, Bremen had defender Philipp Bargfrede sent off for a second yellow card and Freiburg had a goal ruled offside. The result leaves Bremen two points from 16th -- which carries a relegation play-off at the end of the season -- but six points from 15th, which guarantees safety. Bottom side Paderborn are now nine points from safety with seven games left after their 1-1 draw at home to Hoffenheim. On Friday, Hertha Berlin drubbed neighbours Union Berlin 4-0 at the Olympic Stadium in the capital's derby. Hertha's new coach Bruno Labbadia celebrated a second win in as many games to lift his team up to 10th."
98,23/05/2020,17:17,World Cup winner Goetze to part ways with Dortmund,"Borussia Dortmund sports director Michael Zorc confirmed Saturday that Mario Goetze, who scored the winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final, will leave at the end of the season.","""We will stop working together with Mario Goetze in the summer,"" Zorc told Sky before Saturday's Bundesliga game away to Wolfsburg. ""It is a joint decision after a constructive conversation. Mario is a really good guy."" The decision caps a frustrating season for the 27-year-old attacker, who has made only five league starts this term. Goetze wrote himself into German football folklore by volleying home a cross during extra time in the 2014 World Cup final to seal a 1-0 win over Argentina at Rio de Janeiro's Maracana stadium. Six years on, Goetze has struggled to replicate the displays that once prompted former German FA technical director Matthias Sammer to describe him as ""one of the best talents we've ever had"". Having come through the academy, Goetze helped Dortmund win the league and cup double in 2011 and 2012 before he left for Bayern Munich in 2013. However, he failed to hold down a first-team place in Munich and returned to Dortmund in 2016. The following year he was then sidelined for several months by a debilitating metabolic disorder. Goetze made his 200th appearance for Dortmund on the opening day of this season, but he has featured sparingly since the arrival of Erling Braut Haaland in January. On Friday, Dortmund coach Lucien Favre admitted it would be ""difficult"" for Goetze to win a place, while Germany legend Lothar Matthaeus last month urged him to quit the Bundesliga to reboot his career. ""Today, his way of playing football is no longer in demand,"" Matthaeus wrote in a column for Sky. ""Above all, he lacks the speed to keep up with the football that Dortmund and many other top clubs play. ""It's quite possible that Italy would be a suitable league for him,"" added Matthaeus."

Because Can and Witsel both need treatment to muscle strains, they have had to leave the team's quarantine 'bubble' so cannot play on Saturday. Known as the Ruhr derby, Dortmund v Schalke is a key fixture as German football blazes a trail for Europe's top leagues by resuming two months after it was halted, but without spectators. It will be the first major European league to resume after the outbreak of the pandemic, which has so far claimed around 7,500 lives in Germany. As the Bundesliga restarts Dortmund are second in the table, four points behind Bayern Munich and a single point ahead of third placed RB Leipzig. Witsel and German central midfielder Can, who spent four years at Liverpool and recently joined Dortmund on loan from Juventus, both picked up injuries in training after the long lay-off. Dortmund have played two training matches without the injured pair as they prepare for the first Ruhr derby in its 95-year history without a crowd. ""We are used to playing at home in front of 82,000,"" Dortmund coach Lucien Favre told the Bild daily. ""To prepare mentally now to play without being cheered and without being pushed by the atmosphere is an extreme challenge."""

""If we don't play for the next few months, the whole Bundesliga will go under. It will no longer exist in the form we have known it."" The league ground to a halt in Germany on March 13 due to the virus outbreak, with defending champions Bayern Munich four points clear of second-placed Dortmund in the table. Last week, the German Football League (DFL) signalled that it is ready to resume from May 9, albeit behind closed doors and with players tested regularly for the virus. The DFL still needs permission from German Chancellor Merkel and the leaders of the states, who are due to meet on Thursday. Some leading scientists and health advisors have been highly critical of the Bundesliga's plans to resume amid the pandemic. Germany has recorded almost 6,000 coronavirus deaths. Watzke insists clubs are not looking for ""special"" treatment. ""We just want to pursue our profession,"" he said. Germany's top clubs want the league to be finished by June 30 to free up an instalment of television money worth around 300 million euros ($325 million). Magazine Kicker claims 13 of the 36 clubs in the top two leagues are on the verge of insolvency. Both Werder Bremen and Schalke 04 have admitted their finances have been badly affected by the crisis. Former Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness believes holding games behind closed doors -- known as 'ghost games' in German -- is the only viable alternative. ""In principle, I consider ghost games to be questionable, but in view of the economic situation facing some clubs, they are vital,"" Hoeness told Kicker. Hoeness also backed calls for pay-per-view broadcasters Sky and DAZN to allow the nine remaining rounds of Bundesliga games to be screened on free television to help boost morale in football-mad Germany. With so many teams struggling financially, there are also calls for the league to adopt a salary cap. Fortuna Duesseldorf's CEO Thomas Roettgermann wants salaries capped because player wages are ""a large part of the expenses and you are in a never-ending rat race"" with other clubs. ""It would be possible to calculate a salary cap based on the total turnover of the respective club,"" he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. ""All clubs, indeed all over Europe, are currently prepared to talk about this topic,"" Roettgermann added. Augsburg's managing director Michael Stroell also wants a financial rethink. ""Everyone must have realised in the past months that 'higher, faster, further' is not always the right way, and, especially in times of crisis, is enormously dangerous,"" Stroell told local paper the Augsburger Allgemeine."

Dortmund said they had transformed the north stand of the 81,000-capacity stadium -- the one opposite the famous ""Yellow Wall"" -- into a treatment centre in collaboration with a local medical association. The centre will provide check-ups, issue prescription medicines and even offer initial treatment for those diagnosed with COVID-19. It will be available only to those who are showing symptoms of the disease, and will be open daily from 12 noon to 4.00 pm. ""In this way, possible chains of infection can also be broken by avoiding contact to other patients, doctors and staff in the individual doctor's surgeries,"" the club said. ""It's obviously strange at first to go to a football stadium when you have fever and breathing difficulties, but we actually do have optimal conditions here,"" said Dirk Spelmeyer, chairman of the local Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (KVWL). He added that the stadium would relieve pressure on the other specialised coronavirus treatment centre in the north of the city. The Signal-Iduna-Park is the second major European stadium to be used in the fight against the virus, after Spanish giants Real Madrid offered their Santiago Bernabeu -- another 81,000-seater -- to store medical equipment."

Like all top European leagues the German top flight is losing income from broadcasting, sponsorships and ticket sales during the COVID-19 pandemic, with matches in Germany suspended until at least April 2. Bayern has a massive wage bill which reached 336 million euros (364 million dollars) last year, almost half of club turnover. Players at Borussia Moenchengladbach were the first in the Bundesliga to propose a pay cut, followed by others at Werder Bremen and Schalke 04. Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen players are in talks over pay cut proposals with management. At Dortmund -- second in the Bundesliga -- coach Lucien Favre has made a personal offer to take a pay cut while players are negotiating a 20 percent salary reduction if the season does not restart or a 10 percent cut if play resumes behind closed doors, when clubs will at least earn income from TV rights."

Fans were urged to click on the places they bought their beer, fries, sausages and other match day staples and offer a donation to keep the businesses afloat. All told fans donated 73,611 euros with Dortmund's marketing director Carsen Cramer saying they were ""touched"" by the generosity.

Bayern, meanwhile, said in a statement that coach Hansi Flick and sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic had decided ""there would be no training on Tuesday"". The club added that they would ""discuss further measures"" in the course of the day. Other Bundesliga clubs also announced that they had suspended training. Mid-table Cologne, who like Dortmund are based in North-Rhine Westphalia, the western region of Germany worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak, said they would not train until March 27 at the earliest. Meanwhile, staff and players at Hertha Berlin entered a 14-day quarantine after the club announced one of their players had tested positive for the virus."
107,11/03/2020,22:57,Neymar sets PSG on way to Champions League quarters,Paris Saint-Germain shrugged off having to play in an empty stadium as Neymar set the French club on their way to a 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday that took them into the Champions League quarter-finals 3-2 on aggregate.,"PSG came into the game at the Parc des Princes needing to overturn a 2-1 defeat in the first leg of their last-16 tie in Germany, but Neymar's 28th-minute header put them ahead on the night in the second leg amid a surreal atmosphere, as banned supporters gathered outside the ground instead. Juan Bernat then deflected in a Pablo Sarabia assist to make it 2-0 and PSG -- for whom Kylian Mbappe was only fit enough to appear as a substitute -- go through to the quarter-finals for the first time since 2016. The victory breaks a run of three straight exits in the first knockout round of the competition, at the hands of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United. Indeed Dortmund are just the fourth team PSG have defeated in a Champions League knockout tie since the Qatari takeover in 2011, following wins against Valencia, Bayer Leverkusen and Chelsea, the latter on two occasions. However, their opponents were disappointing, with Erling Braut Haaland never looking like repeating his first-leg heroics when he netted twice. They finished the game with 10 men as Emre Can was sent off late on. This was one of several Champions League matches this week and next being played out in an empty stadium after authorities banned fans from attending due to the coronavirus outbreak. However, PSG fans still congregated in significant numbers outside the stadium despite the French government banning all gatherings of more than 1,000 people. Those supporters brandished flares as the team bus arrived before the game and sang and set off fireworks throughout the match. Mbappe was only named among the substitutes after struggling with illness and even undergoing a test for coronavirus in the build-up to the game. The France striker missed two training sessions this week with a sore throat and a fever. His test for COVID-19 came up negative. His absence from the starting line-up was just the latest blow for coach Thomas Tuchel, who was also without the suspended Marco Verratti and injured centre-back Thiago Silva. That meant Edinson Cavani and Pablo Sarabia started through the middle of the attack, while Argentine international Leandro Paredes was selected in midfield. Cavani was denied the opener in the 25th minute when Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki stretched out a leg to tip his shot around the post. The opening goal followed soon after, with Angel Di Maria swinging in a corner from the right and Neymar stealing in front of his marker to stoop and head in from close range. The PSG supporters outside the ground responded to the Brazilian's second goal in the tie by exploding more fireworks in celebration. Jadon Sancho and Thorgan Hazard tried their luck from outside the area for Dortmund but PSG scored again in first-half stoppage time. This time Di Maria laid the ball out to Sarabia on the right side of the box, and his low driven ball was diverted into the far corner by Bernat. Di Maria nearly scored another in the second half from a free-kick before Mbappe came on with just under half an hour remaining. Dortmund were only one goal away from forcing extra time but rarely troubled Keylor Navas in the home goal and Can saw a straight red card with a minute left for throwing Neymar to the ground. The Brazilian was also booked following that incident along with Di Maria, now watching from the dugout and who will miss the quarter-final first leg as a result."
108,10/03/2020,12:38,"PSG's Mbappe sick, doubtful for Dortmund crunch match",Paris Saint-Germain are sweating on the fitness of star striker Kylian Mbappe who has picked up a throat infection ahead of Wednesday's Champions League last-16 second leg against Borussia Dortmund.,"The French World Cup star missed team training Monday and Tuesday and was reported to have a sore throat, with his club needing to overturn a 2-1 deficit from the first leg in Germany three weeks ago. Mbappe has scored six goals in his past three PSG matches, including a hat-trick in the 5-1 French Cup semi-final win over Lyon last week. ""We're trying to see if he can train a bit tonight (Tuesday). We have to wait and decide tomorrow morning,"" coach Thomas Tuchel told PSG TV. Spanish international Pablo Sarabia is a possible replacement should Mbappe miss the game. PSG lost 2-1 to an Erling Haaland-inspired Dortmund before a crowd of 80,000 in Germany last month, but the return leg will be played at an empty Parc des Princes due to the coronavirus outbreak. ""We're a team that likes to attack, and we're going to attack. We're going to try and score as many goals as possible,"" said Tuchel. ""But if the final score is 1-0 to us, I would be perfectly happy."" PSG's game away to Strasbourg at the weekend was postponed due to the extent of the virus outbreak in the Alsace region of eastern France. ""It was a shame (not to play). It continues to be a bit strange,"" said Tuchel. ""In a match like this one, it's super important (to have fans) to create a special atmosphere, and to put pressure on our opponents. ""With the coronavirus news and Kylian Mbappe, that gives us lots of things to think about,"" he added. ""But it's a football match, we have to adapt. I'm confident in the fact we'll be able to do it."" Tuchel also said a decision on the fitness of captain Thiago Silva would be made on Wednesday. The Brazilian defender hasn't played since injuring his thigh against Bordeaux on February 23. ah-yk-ff/jed/dmc-mw/cw"
109,10/03/2020,03:08,"PSG under pressure against Dortmund to keep Mbappe, Neymar project on track","Nothing ever seems to go to plan in the Champions League for Paris Saint-Germain, whose bid to avoid yet another exit in the first knockout round against Borussia Dortmund will be played out before an empty stadium on Wednesday.","After Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and co. lost 2-1 to an Erling Haaland-inspired Dortmund before a crowd of 80,000 in Germany last month, PSG discovered on Monday the second leg of their last-16 tie must be played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus outbreak. Estimates put the financial hit to Qatar-owned PSG of playing the game without the presence of nearly 50,000 fans at the Parc des Princes in the region of six million euros ($6.9 million), while the president of the club's Ultras fans group has called on supporters to gather outside the stadium instead. However, it is still possible the strange atmosphere will work in the home team's favour, removing some of the immense pressure on them. Agitated supporters are restless at the thought of their team -- despite all the Qatari investment -- going out of the Champions League in the last 16 for the fourth year running. Following the first-leg defeat, one banner targeted captain Thiago Silva and their two superstar forwards, asking: ""Silva, Mbappe, Neymar, afraid of winning? Show some balls."" While PSG's record in France, where they are on course for a seventh Ligue 1 title in eight seasons, is excellent, it is also almost irrelevant. This is a club that begs to be judged on its performance in Europe. They are the fifth-richest club in the world in the most recent Deloitte Football Money League, with 636 million euros in revenue last season, behind only Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Bayern Munich. However, they have fallen at this hurdle in each of the last three seasons, often in farcical fashion. In 2017 there was the capitulation in Barcelona, a 6-1 defeat following a 4-0 first-leg win. They then spent over 400 million euros to make Neymar and Mbappe the two most expensive signings in the world, but the Brazilian missed the second leg of the 2018 defeat by Madrid due to injury and then sat out both legs of an improbable exit to Manchester United last year. In eight years since the Qatari takeover, PSG have beaten just three teams in Champions League knockout ties: Valencia, Bayer Leverkusen and Chelsea (twice). In a recent interview with Canal Plus, sporting director Leonardo tried to take pressure off Thomas Tuchel's team before the Dortmund tie. ""It's not life or death. If we lose we will try again next year,"" he insisted. ""We need to stop all the negativity. We have a fantastic team and fantastic players."" Nevertheless, it is worth pondering how what is essentially a vanity project can continue to be credible if PSG keep on losing the games that really matter. The need to beat Dortmund is therefore critical, even in these mitigating circumstances, and the futures of both Neymar and Mbappe, forever linked to Real Madrid, could depend on it. If they do reach a first quarter-final since 2016, the weight off their shoulders will be huge and might well be replaced by a realisation that winning the trophy for the first time is a real possibility. Coach Tuchel is under contract until 2021 but, just like Unai Emery and Laurent Blanc before him, it is hard to see how he would survive another disappointing European showing. Tuchel is also under pressure after a decision to radically change his team's formation for the first leg backfired badly. He needs a big performance from Neymar, who wanted to leave last summer rather than stick around for a third season in Paris but was poor in Dortmund. Tuchel also needs Mbappe, scorer of 30 goals this season, to deliver on the night. ""He struggled against Dortmund. His reaction since then has been astounding, in every training session. He is decisive and he is in great form,"" Tuchel said recently, and he will hope that form continues at an eerily empty stadium on Wednesday."
110,19/02/2020,15:05,Fingers pointed at Tuchel as Neymar and PSG face fight to avoid new European fiasco,Paris Saint-Germain travelled to Borussia Dortmund desperate to finally make their mark on the Champions League knockout stage but left on the receiving end of a defeat which threatens to derail yet another European campaign.,"The aftermath saw an unhappy Neymar pointing the finger of blame at his own club with coach Thomas Tuchel clearly in the firing line. The world's most expensive player scored a potentially precious away goal for the French club, but a brace by the exceptional Erling Braut Haaland gave Dortmund a 2-1 win to take to Paris for the return leg of their last-16 tie on March 11. The danger is that a familiar story is unfurling for PSG, who had gone three and a half months unbeaten before their trip to Germany. Far too strong for their domestic rivals, but unable to cope with the step up in intensity at the business end of the Champions League. Humiliated by second-leg comebacks at this stage by Manchester United last year and Barcelona in 2017, beaten by Real Madrid in 2018, it is four years since the Qatar-owned club won a Champions League knockout tie. Sporting director Leonardo recently tried to remove some of the pressure going into the Dortmund tie when he said: ""This is not life or death, it's a game of football."" However, another exit at this stage would be immensely damaging for the PSG project. Would Kylian Mbappe and Neymar, the two most expensive players in world football, really stick around for another crack at the competition? Despite his goal, Neymar looked off the pace in Dortmund, short of match sharpness having missed his team's previous four games with a rib problem which he insisted was not serious. PSG's desire to wrap the Brazilian in cotton wool for the last fortnight was understandable, after he missed the United tie 12 months ago with a foot injury and the second leg against Madrid in 2018 because of a similar problem. But it proved detrimental, according to the player himself. ""The club decide, so sadly I had to respect their decision. But that ended up being bad for me and my teammates,"" he told Brazilian media after the game. ""I was genuinely injured, I had a fissure in a rib. But it was nothing that should have prevented me from playing. ""They postponed my return again, and then postponed it again and again. ""I understand the club's fear, because I missed the last 16 in each of the last two years. I respect the decisions, but it can't be that way, because it is the player who ends up suffering. ""It was very difficult to play a game of that intensity, for 90 minutes without stopping. If I were in a better condition physically then I definitely would have played better."" While Neymar appeared to point the finger at the club's medical staff as well as Tuchel, others were more directly critical of the coach. After months of committing to a 4-4-2 formation which gave more room to fit in his many attacking stars but made them potentially more vulnerable at the back, Tuchel switched to a 3-4-3 in Dortmund, mirroring the opposition. Sports daily L'Equipe called it ""a tactical choice that had not been worked on and did not work out"". Tuchel ""lost his bet"", the paper added. ""It is nothing to do with the tactical set-up, it is up to us to show the desire,"" insisted Presnel Kimpembe, a member of that back three. Kimpembe's brother was rather less generous -- he launched a foul-mouthed tirade against Tuchel in a video posted on Instagram that went viral in France, although he did then claim it was ""a joke"". Nobody of a PSG persuasion will be in the mood for laughing if they go out in the second leg, but the rest of Europe possibly will be, at their expense."
111,19/02/2020,14:09,Dortmund have psychological edge over PSG - Watzke,Borussia Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke believes the German club have a psychological advantage over Paris Saint-Germain after Erling Braut Haaland's goals sealed a 2-1 win over the French club in the Champions League on Tuesday.,"The Norwegian teenager struck twice in Tuesday's last 16, first leg at the Signal Iduna Park to steal the limelight from Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and the other stars in the PSG ranks. Neymar looked to be lacking full match fitness after two weeks out with a rib problem, yet he still produced a precious away goal to give PSG a lifeline for the return leg on March 11. However, Watzke says the Bundesliga side hold a mental edge as the French champions are desperate to avoid exiting in the last 16 for the fourth straight season. ""They have that Manchester United trauma,"" he said referring to PSG's exit last season when they beat United 2-0 away at Old Trafford in the first leg only to be dumped out on away goals after a 3-1 defeat at the Parc de Princes. ""For them, the world will collapse if they go out. I think we have the psychological advantage now."" They also have Haaland, who has now scored 11 goals in his first seven games for Dortmund since joining from Salzburg in January. The 19-year-old also became the Champions League's joint top-scorer this season with 10 goals, after also netting eight times in the group stage for the Austrians before his transfer last month. As media across Europe duly noted, he appeared to be born to play at the highest level of continental football. ""Haaland already looks more comfortable at this level than Paris Saint-Germain,"" noted The Independent in the UK. The striker's imposing physical presence and ability to read the game with an attacker's instinct was considered a deadly combination. ""The immense talent of the immense Haaland can be frightening, as he looked like Marco van Basten after swallowing LeBron James for breakfast,"" said French sports daily L'Equipe. In Spain, sports daily Marca said how ""the giant Haaland has put PSG on the ropes"" with the Parisians now under immense pressure to deliver at home next month. Even PSG coach Thomas Tuchel could not help being impressed with Haaland's finishing. ""He is an animal,"" said Tuchel, the former Dortmund coach. ""He has this physical presence, an uncanny energy and speed. His first was a poacher's finish, the other was a beautiful goal."""
112,19/02/2020,00:37,"PSG still 'dangerous', warns record-breaker Haaland",Teenage record-breaker Erling Braut Haaland warned Borussia Dortmund still have it all to do to reach the Champions League quarter-finals even after his two goals sank Neymar's Paris Saint-Germain.,"Haaland netted either side of a Neymar equaliser on Tuesday as the Brazilian superstar scored on his return from injury as the French champions crashed to a 2-1 defeat at Dortmund in the last 16, first leg, tie. ""We want to go through, it's going to be a hard game,"" Haaland said of the return leg in Paris on March 11, ""but we are a good team. ""The result is quite a dangerous one, as Paris has a very strong team and can still go through in the return leg."" Haaland's team-mate Emre Can, who alongside Axel Witsel worked tirelessly in Dortmund's midfield to contain Neymar and France striker Kylian Mbappe, said the home side's defence had been key. ""It was a big statement from the team how we defended today. We know it's not over -- it's just half-time,"" said Can, whose permanent transfer from Juventus was confirmed Tuesday. However, the night belonged Haaland who has 11 goals in his first seven games for Dortmund and warned there is more to come. ""I feel like I still can do a lot better,"" said Haaland. ""I have to work hard to improve to play better at this level."" Having also scored eight goals for Salzburg in the group stages before his 20 million-euro ($22 million) transfer to Dortmund, Haaland made Champions League history on Tuesday. His tally of 10 goals in his first seven Champions League matches is now a new record in the competition and makes him the joint top-scorer alongside Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski. The teenage goal-machine has so far scored 39 times in 29 games this season for Salzburg and Dortmund. The 19-year-old had already sent records tumbling since arriving in Dortmund last month when he became the first player to score a hat-trick off the bench on his Bundesliga debut. His incredible strike for his second goal on Tuesday overshadowed Neymar's return from a rib injury with PSG desperate to break their last 16 jinx having exited at this stage in the competition in each of the last three seasons. Paris defender Marquinhos said Neymar's away goal could prove crucial in the home leg. ""We weren't intense enough with or without the ball and did a lot of things badly, however the goal we got is important for the second leg,"" he said. The presence of the world's most expensive player was a major boost for his team, after Neymar missed last season's surprise last-16 loss to Manchester United with a foot injury. He also sat out the second leg of their defeat by Real Madrid at the same stage in 2018. PSG's German coach Thomas Tuchel admitted Neymar's lack of match fitness had been a factor in the away defeat, but said his team still has time to find their form. ""Neymar hadn't played for a fortnight, but he is very important for Kylian (Mbappe), there is harmony between them and if Neymar lacks rhythm, it's immediately noticeable,"" said Tuchel. ""We didn't have enough possession, we made too many easy mistakes, we weren't smart enough and we lost the ball too early. ""It's difficult, but it's 2-1 and we still have a few games left to get back into the rhythm."" His counterpart Lucien Favre echoed Haaland's insistence that the result gives Dortmund only a slender advantage with PSG's passionate home fans set to get behind their team in the return leg. ""Of course it's a dangerous result, but we played well in both defence and attack,"" said Dortmund's Swiss coach. ""However, as things stand it's 2-1 to us."""
113,19/02/2020,00:13,Phenomenon Haaland outshines PSG superstars to confirm arrival on biggest stage,The two most expensive players in the world were unable to outshine the prolific Erling Braut Haaland as the Norwegian sensation continued his remarkable rise by scoring both goals in Borussia Dortmund's 2-1 defeat of Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday.,"When Kylian Mbappe teed up Neymar to cancel out Haaland's opener in the second half of their Champions League last 16, first leg at the Signal Iduna Park, it looked like PSG would leave Germany with the upper hand in the tie. But then, in the 77th minute, Haaland latched onto a pass from substitute Giovanni Reyna and sent a thumping left-foot shot rising high into the net from the edge of the penalty area to give Dortmund the advantage heading into the return leg in Paris on March 11. Perhaps PSG's 402 million-euro ($434 million) attacking duo will still make the difference in the return, and give the French club a place in the quarter-finals for the first time in four years. But Dortmund deserved their victory on the night in a tie which only really began to live up to its billing in the second half, coming to life when Haaland pounced to score the opening goal from close range on 69 minutes after Thiago Silva blocked a Raphael Guerreiro shot. If that was a typical poacher's finish, the winning goal was a demonstration of sheer brute force from the 1.94m tall, 19-year-old who now has 10 goals in seven Champions League games this season. ""I feel like I still can do a lot better. I have to play better at this level, have to work hard to improve,"" Haaland told UEFA.com after being named man of the match. ""The result is quite a dangerous one, as Paris has a very strong team and can still go through in the return leg."" Meanwhile, Dortmund players were full of praise for their team-mate, who came to prominence by scoring nine times for Norway in one game at last year's Under-20 World Cup. ""He still has huge room for improvement but he is on the road to becoming a truly great player,"" Axel Witsel told French broadcaster RMC Sport. Emre Can told BT Sport: ""Of course he's a great footballer. He's also a great guy. He's a little bit crazy I think, funny and hopefully he will continue like that."" Haaland's eight goals in the group stage were not enough for Salzburg to qualify for the last 16, but they helped him earn his 20 million-euro move to Dortmund in the winter window. After 28 goals in 22 games altogether for Salzburg, that fee already looked like a bargain, but his statistics have been even more jaw-dropping since he became part of Lucien Favre's side. Scorer of a hat-trick off the bench against Augsburg on his debut, the Leeds-born player now has 11 goals in just seven outings for his new club. It is a phenomenal record, and his presence -- along with that of Jadon Sancho -- helped persuade PSG coach Thomas Tuchel to abandon the 4-4-2 formation he had settled on in recent months in order to play with three central defenders. Haaland still managed to be the star of the show despite coming directly up against Silva, Marquinhos and Presnel Kimpembe. At the other end, Neymar and Mbappe were kept quiet for most of the night, as was Angel Di Maria. For 21-year-old Mbappe, the risk must be that Haaland is threatening to make him yesterday's news. Mbappe's tally of 19 goals in the Champions League is a record for a player before his 21st birthday. Haaland is already into double figures and will not be 21 until July next year. Mbappe was seven months younger than Haaland is now when he made it to double figures, but the latter's current strike rate is frightening. PSG will have to find a way to keep him quiet in the return leg if the Qatar-owned club are to avoid yet another deeply disappointing exit in the last 16."

""When we take the lead, we have to be a little dirtier,"" said the midfielder, who joined last month from Juventus. ""That's something the team has to learn, defensively we all have to be better together. ""It was definitely a setback, but anything can still happen."" Dortmund were 3-2 up going into the final 10 minutes thanks to goals by Mats Hummels, Can and Raphael Guerreiro. However after Kevin Volland netted two first-half goals for Leverkusen, substitute Leon Bailey swept home to make it 3-3 on 81 minutes before playing a part in Lars Bender's headed winner. There was just 82 seconds between Leverkusen's final two goals as the Dortmund defence was caught napping. It was the first time new striker Erling Braut Haaland had failed to score for his new club after hitting eight goals in his first four games, and the teenage sensation cut a dejected figure as he trudged off. Dortmund will finish the weekend six points behind Bayern Munich if the champions beat second-placed RB Leipzig at home on Sunday. ""That hurts,"" said Dortmund's sporting director Michael Zorc. ""It's very disappointing because we played well until the 80th minute. ""We're conceding too many goals, we're not in a better position (in the league) and we have these (defensive) problems."" Dortmund head coach Lucien Favre could not hide his frustration. The Swiss broke off a post-match TV interview when asked about the table situation, ""stop taking about it"". Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz enjoyed some sweet revenge over his former club having been sacked by Dortmund after just six months in charge in 2017. ""I just told the boys they did really well and never gave up,"" said the Dutchman, who recently signed a contract extension until June 2022. sid-ryj/td <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org>"

The defeat for Dortmund, which leaves them third on 39 points, was also the first time teenager prodigy Erling Braut Haaland failed to score after hitting eight goals in his first four games for his new club. Leverkusen are now fifth, two points off the Champions League places. Dortmund could finish the weekend six points behind Bayern Munich if the defending champions beat second-placed RB Leipzig at home on Sunday, after conceding for the 32nd time this season. ""We have problems, we're conceding too many goals,"" fumed Dortmund's Swiss coach Lucien Favre. ""We have to control the situations better and play smarter."" The goals flew at the BayArena with three disallowed efforts on top of the two Kevin Volland also scored for Leverkusen. Volland put Leverkusen ahead on 20 minutes by firing home with his second touch, but Hummels equalised almost immediately by heading home a corner. Emre Can put Dortmund 2-1 up with a rifled finish in the 33rd minute before German Volland levelled just before the break. Dortmund took the lead again in the 65th minute when Achraf Hakimi started a move which released left-back Raphael Guerreiro, who drove his shot home. The scene was set for Bailey, who had a goal disallowed soon after coming on, but was not to be denied. After asweeping home a goal of his own on 81 minutes, he back-heeled to Dutch midfielder Daley Sinkgraven who crossed for Bender to nod in the winner. Earlier, Sweden striker Robin Quaison hit a hat-trick as Mainz beat Hertha Berlin 3-1 in the capital to push Jurgen Klinsmann's side towards the relegation zone. Hertha have just one win in their five games in all competitions in 2020 under ex-Germany and USA head coach Klinsmann, who took charge in November. Hertha's only consolation was an own goal by Mainz defender Jeffrey Bruma just before Berlin midfielder Marius Wolf was sent off for a second yellow card soon before the final whistle. Having also been drubbed 4-0 by leaders Bayern Munich in January, Hertha are now 14th in the table, six points from the bottom three. Sixth-placed Schalke fell further behind in the title race after a 1-1 home draw with bottom side Paderborn. Schalke are now seven points behind the leaders before Bayern play on Sunday. Werder Bremen are now deep in relegation trouble after a 2-0 home defeat to promoted Union Berlin. Second-half goals by Union winger Marius Buelter did the damage, combined with Mainz's win at Hertha Berlin, to leave Bremen second-from bottom and four points from safety. Bremen's cause was not helped as Fortuna Duesseldorf moved above them by drawing 1-1 at 10-man Wolfsburg. Winger Mathias Zimmermann gave Duesseldorf the lead and Wolfsburg had defender Marin Pongracic sent off just after the interval for elbowing Alfredo Morales at a free-kick.

Alcacer, who like Reus has scored five league goals so far this season, is also out due to the persistent calf injury which has sidelined him since September 28. However, Sancho, 19, has been included after being dropped for Saturday's game after returning late from England duty. Burki is also back after limping out of the second-half of the Gladbach win with a knee injury. The Germans top Group F ahead of Barcelona on goal difference after holding the Spanish giants to a goalless draw in Dortmund in their opening game and then winning 2-0 at bottom side Slavia Prague. Inter, third in the table, drew at home to Slavia and lost 2-1 to Barca a fortnight ago at the Camp Nou in their two previous games."
117,22/10/2019,02:25,'Gentle giant' Lukaku thriving at Inter Milan after Man United flop,"Italian coach Antonio Conte has made his ""gentle giant"" Romelu Lukaku the focus of Inter Milan's attack this season where the striker has found his scoring touch again after leaving Manchester United.","The Belgian got off the mark in his first league match against Lecce and has since scored five goals in eight Serie A games since departing Old Trafford under a cloud last summer. The 26-year-old scored a brace last weekend against Sassuolo to keep Inter second in Serie A, one point behind defending champions Juventus, after eight games. It followed his double as Belgium sealed their Euro 2020 ticket, extending his national all-time record to 51 goals in 83 appearances. Conte's side host Group F leaders Borussia Dortmund in their third Champions League game on Wednesday having been held 1-1 to Slavia Prague and losing 2-1 to Barcelona, with Lukaku missing the trip to Spain with a thigh injury. Inter gambled big by investing around 80 million euros ($89 million) in Lukaku to restore the pairing he composed under the Red Devils' jersey with Alexis Sanchez. Chilean Sanchez made just four appearances for Inter before being ruled out for three months with an ankle injury. But Lukaku has still impressed with a rich vein of form alongside Argentine Lautaro Martinez, who also scored a double at the weekend against Sassuolo. ""We're working with Romelu to get to know one another better,"" said Martinez. ""We're looking to improve our understanding to help Inter to win."" The Belgian's high energy levels and sharp play are in contrast to United where he spent two seasons, scoring 42 goals in 96 appearances, but just 15 last season. He was never far from fan criticism, over his weight and professionalism, as he fell down the pecking order once Ole Gunnar Solskjaer replaced Jose Mourinho. Hopes had been high that Lukaku could spearhead a new era for United when he joined from Everton for £75 million ($91 million) in 2017, but he left Manchester having failed to win a trophy. ""At the end, I thought it was better for me to move on and try different things,"" said Lukaku, who took the number nine jersey of former Inter captain Mauro Icardi, who fell out of favour and moved to Paris Saint-Germain. Conte had been a long-time admirer of Lukaku, who started his career at Anderlect, and tried to sign him for Chelsea before the Belgian's move from Everton to United. ""Lukaku entered the Inter world in the best of ways, with great humility, he's a good giant, a giant with a smile,"" said Conte, who is trying to break Juventus's stranglehold in Italy and win Inter's first title since their treble under Mourinho in 2010. Despite being targetted by racist chants during a league game in Cagliari, Lukaku has no regrets about choosing Italy, and above all Conte. ""Between him and I there is a very strong relationship. I'm happy. At the age of 26, I want a coach like this, who helps me every day and gives me motivation,"" said Lukaku. ""He's the best manager in the world."" His move to Italy was also eased by the presence of his brother Jordan Lukaku, 25, who has played as a defender for Lazio since 2016. Former Inter Milan star Samuel Eto'o has praised Lukaku for how he has adapted. ""We played together at Everton, he was already big and strong even though he is like a baby, but he is very intelligent and on the issue of racism, he said important things,"" said the Cameroonian. ""Some players think they are stars and others feel like normal people, he's in the second category, and you'll see how many goals he's going to score."" Ex-United teammate Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who won three Serie A titles with Inter Milan, added: ""Lukaku has this mad hunger to prove himself to the world and I'm sure he will do well at Inter too."" United may be missing Lukaku's goals as they languish in 13th place in the Premier League having scored 10 in nine games."
118,19/10/2019,22:33,"Dortmund beat Bundesliga leaders Gladbach, Bayern held by Augsburg","Borussia Dortmund beat top-of-the-table Borussia Moenchengladbach 1-0 to jump to fourth in the Bundesliga on Saturday, level with Bayern Munich who earlier dropped points in a 2-2 draw at Augsburg.","The top of the Bundesliga grew even more congested with the top nine separated by just two points. Of the eight who have played so far this weekend, only Eintracht Frankfurt and Dortmund have won. Gladbach remained top, ahead of Wolfsburg, who drew 1-1 at RB Leipzig, on goal difference. Both have 16 points from eight games. Bayern, Dortmund and Leipzig are all one point behind. Then come four teams on 14 points, including Freiburg, who could have gone top but lost 2-0 at Union Berlin, and Bayer Leverkusen, who could also have taken over first, but lost at Frankfurt on Friday. Schalke have a chance to seize top spot when they visit Hoffenheim on Sunday. In Dortmund, Thorgan Hazard's first-half strike for the home team against his former club was ruled out by VAR for a tight offside call. Hazard then found a sprinting Marco Reus with a perfect through ball in the 58th minute. Reus slotted home for the only goal of the game. Even though another Dortmund strike was erased by VAR in the 85th minute, the home team finished the game hanging on, adopting a back-five and even a back-six in added time to end a run of three successive draws. Dortmund started without 19-year-old attacker Jadon Sancho who was dropped for ""disciplinary reasons"". ""Jadon is a great kid, but he is still very young,"" Dortmund director of football Michael Zorc told German television before kick-off. ""The decision was not easy, but there was no other choice. The suspension is only active for today."" German media reported Sancho had returned late from England duty. Reigning champions Bayern, meanwhile, slipped up for the second league match in succession, having lost 2-1 at home to Hoffenheim before the international break. Augsburg grabbed a rapid lead -- just as they had in the corresponding fixture last year -- when Marco Richter found the net with a sweetly-struck volley just 30 seconds after kick-off, the fastest goal of the season so far. Bayern replied as Robert Lewandowski stretched his scoring streak to eight games in the 14th minute from a Serge Gnabry cross. After a host of missed chances, former Arsenal winger Gnabry then put Bayern 2-1 ahead after 49 minutes. But a strong run in injury time by Sergio Cordova set up Alfred Finnbogason, who finished past Manuel Neuer to earn a point for Augsburg, and put another early dent in Bayern's title defence. Thomas Mueller missed two chances after coming on as a late substitute after a week of controversy over the fact he has not started a game since September. Timo Werner scored his first goal in five games for Leipzig in a tight tussle against Wolfsburg at the Red Bull Arena. It was not enough. Wolfsburg scored a late equaliser when Dutch striker Wout Weghorst finished a William cross to keep the race at the top close. Wolfsburg are the only unbeaten team in the division. At the Weserstadion, Werder Bremen opened the scoring at home against Hertha Berlin as Josh Sargent's strike took a deflection on its way into the net in the seventh minute. Dodi Lukebakio hit back in the 70th minute for Hertha to secure a 1-1 draw. He beat three defenders, including Theodor Gebre Selassie twice, in a mazy run from the wing. Union Berlin claimed just the second win of their debut top-flight season by beating Freiburg at a bouncing Stadion an der Alten Foersterei."
119,18/10/2019,03:01,Kovac tells Bayern to dig in after Hoffenheim slump,Niko Kovac says Bayern Munich need to prove their shock defeat to Hoffenheim was only a Champions League hangover in their bid to reclaim top spot in the Bundesliga Saturday.,"Bayern followed up their 7-2 thrashing of Tottenham in the Champions League by crashing to a 2-1 loss in the Bundesliga a fortnight ago when mid-table Hoffenheim earned their first win at the Allianz Arena. In the process, Moenchengladbach topped the table and Bayern dropped to third with five other teams all within two points of first place. Now Kovac wants a win this weekend at Augsburg, where Bayern conceded a first-minute Leon Goretzka own-goal and needed two Kingsley Coman goals to earn a 3-2 win in February. ""There are teams all over Europe who have problems in their league after Champions League games,"" said Kovac on Thursday. ""Hoffenheim were better than their place in the table (12th) suggested - the same goes for Augsburg (14th). ""We know that is a hard place to win, we were a goal down after 10 seconds there last season. ""I expect a game in which we will have to hang in there and make the most of our opportunities."" Fresh from scoring a hat-trick for Poland, and helping them qualify for the Euro 2020 finals, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski can equal the league record by scoring at Augsburg to continue his run of a goal in each of the first eight games. The 31-year-old is in blistering form with 15 goals, including 11 in the Bundesliga, so far in 11 matches in all competitions. Kovac said Germany winger Serge Gnabry, who had a leg knock, and French defender Lucas Hernandez (knee) were both ""ready to play"". Things are so tight in the top half of the table that seventh-placed Bayer Leverkusen could move into first place by beating Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday night. ""It's striking that the league is divided into two parts,"" acknowledged Kovac. ""Many of the top teams play in Europe, but I think that Leipzig, Dortmund and Leverkusen will stay at the top for a long time."" Despite Kovac's confidence in Bayern's rivals Dortmund, Lucien Favre's team must end their run of three consecutive 2-2 league draws -- in which they have thrown away the lead on each occasion -- at home to current leaders Gladbach on Saturday. On Thursday, Dortmund extended the contract of Euro 2016 winner Raphael Guerreiro until 2023, but Favre says it is still ""too early"" for striker Paco Alcacer, who has an Achilles tendon injury. Favre says Dortmund must improve ""five to ten percent"" to beat Gladbach and close the four-point gap behind the leaders. The 2014 World Cup winner has started Bayern's last six games on the bench -- ""a trend that doesn't make (him) happy"" -- with Kovac preferring Philippe Coutinho in the attacking midfielder role behind Lewandowski. Mueller could start at Augsburg after Coutinho endured a mammoth round-trip to Singapore, on duty with Brazil, for internationals against Senegal and Nigeria. On Thursday, Kovac admitted he ""made a mistake"" by saying the 30-year-old Mueller, who has made 495 appearances for Bayern and helped them win eight Bundesliga title, will only be called upon off the bench ""in case of emergencies"" and held clear-the-air talks. 1.57 - the number of goals Lewandowski has scored on average per Bundesliga game this season. 52 - his projected goal tally for 34 matches in the 2019/20 season if he maintains his present average. It would beat the record of 40 Gerd Mueller set in 1971/72. 88 &amp; 90 - the minutes in which Dortmund have conceded own-goals in two of their last three matches - all of which ended in 2-2 draws.

They are just three points behind leaders Bayern Munich in a tightly-packed top half, with five teams just a point behind the defending champions. Bayern host mid-table Hoffenheim on Saturday hunting a fifth straight win, boosted by Tuesday's stunning 7-2 away romp at Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League. Dortmund need a win at third-placed Freiburg on Saturday to stay in touch. Having won 2-0 at Slavia Prague on Wednesday in the Champions League, a second victory in four days would put Dortmund's Bundesliga campaign back on track. Goalkeeper Roman Burki has said the team must 'man up' and get ruthless in Freiburg, a notoriously hard place to pick up three points. ""We aren't playing like men. The killer instinct up front is missing,"" he raved after the draw with Bremen on Sunday. With Mats Hummels restored to the team after a back injury, Dortmund's defence should be tighter at Freiburg. Reus reacted angrily when a Sky reporter recently asked if the team had a mentality problem and midfielder Axel Witsel batted off a similar question after the Bremen draw. ""Oh man, don't ask me that -- mentality isn't the problem,"" insisted the Belgium star, but doubts still linger. Chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke agreed with Burki that Dortmund must get ruthless, even at the expense of their attack-minded football, to grind out wins. ""I believe that we must stop being in love with our own football - instead, we should be in love with winning,"" Watzke told Munich-based daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. ""That's what it's all about."" Watzke says Dortmund's ultimate goal must be to end Bayern's run of seven straight league titles, ""we're trying everything"". In order to usurp the Bavarians, Dortmund must mimic the relentless ruthlessness of Juventus, who have been Italian champions 35 times, says Watzke. ""We should learn to defend our goal again with teeth and claws,"" he said. ""They (Juventus) are extremely focused on the result. ""We need a bit more of that, so we don't just define ourselves through beautiful football, but also through tough defensive individual work."" After scoring twice on Wednesday as Serge Gnabry hit four goals in Bayern's 7-2 drubbing of Spurs, Robert Lewandowski has 14 goals in 10 games in all competitions. The Pole, 31, is in the form of his career, especially in the Bundesliga where he has 10 goals from the first six games - double that of closest rivals Leipzig's Timo Werner and Dortmund striker Paco Alcacer. If he scores against Hoffenheim at the Allianz Arena on Saturday, Lewandowski will have netted in each of the first seven league games this season. That would leave him just one short of the record, when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored in each of the first eight games of 2015-16 for Dortmund. 212 - the number of goals Lewandowski has scored in 296 Bundesliga games for both Bayern and ex-club Dortmund. 17- the goals Bayern have scored in their last four games, six of which were claimed by Lewandowski. 6 - the assists (2) and goals (4) Amine Harit has in Schalke's last three games. Expect the Royal Blues' playmaker to cause Cologne a few problems on Saturday."

The Morocco international burst through onto Julian Brandt's pass in the 35th minute and charged towards the goal, skipping past Petr Sevcik and goalkeeper Ondrej Kolar before rifling home the opener. The pair combined again in the final minute with another rapid counter, the Germany midfielder this time slipping Hakimi in down the left and the 20-year-old -- on loan from Real Madrid -- slotting a neat left-foot finish that made sure of the win. ""Hakimi sat on his motorbike and raced away from everybody,"" said Slavia defender Ondrej Kudela. ""Those counter-attacks were lethal, but we made mistakes we cannot make at this level. We had our chances, but wasted them."" Dortmund, who came into the game on the back of three straight draws in all competitions and a lowly eighth place in the Bundesliga, had to ride their luck before Hakimi sealed the points. Lukas Masopust had already fluffed a one-on-one with Roman Burki in the first half when Stanislav Tecl missed a golden opportunity to equalise when clean through seven minutes after the break, slapping his shot into the side netting with the goal at his mercy. Sevcik then nearly made up for his earlier shoddy defending with a powerful shot that fizzed just wide with 19 minutes remaining. Meanwhile in Group E Napoli slipped up with a goalless draw at Genk which came after the Serie A side struck the woodwork three times and striker Arkadiusz Milik missed several chances to win the match. Carlo Ancelotti's side could have been ahead as early as the 15th minute when Jose Callejon struck the post before Milik then clipped the bar on the rebound. Off-form Milik then hit the bar again with a header 10 minutes later and Callejon missed a glaring opportunity just before the hour mark when he uncharacteristically shot wide from close range when found at the far post. They were almost made to pay for their profligacy when Ianis Hagi -- son of former Barcelona and Romania attacker Gheorghe -- blazed over when presented with a golden opportunity to snatch all three points. ""We knew this game could be tough. We should have simply been more clinical, that's all I have to say about the team's performance,"" said Ancelotti. Napoli stay top of the group on four points with defending champions Liverpool facing Salzburg later Wednesday."
122,01/10/2019,17:48,Dortmund expect Sancho to leave for Premier League,"Borussia Dortmund expect to lose England winger Jadon Sancho to a Premier League club with both Manchester United and Manchester City reportedly tracking the teenager, director of sport Michael Zorc has admitted.","After turning down a new Manchester City contract to join Dortmund in August 2017, Sancho, still only 19, made his England debut last October on the back of stunning performances for the German club. Sancho has scored 18 goals with 29 assists in 64 games for Dortmund who will expect around 100 million euros ($109 million, £89.2 million) for him, having paid £8 million for him after he signed a five-year deal until June 2022. Sancho has made a great start to this season with four goals and six assists in nine games and Dortmund have reportedly doubled his salary to six million euros per year. Many fans, however, do not expect the club to hold onto the fleet-footed winger for much longer and Zorc agrees that ""the really top clubs"" are ""not blind"". ""You don't have to be a prophet to say that Jadon will certainly not be playing here for another five years,"" he said ahead of Wednesday's Champions League match at Slavia Prague. Sancho had yet to turn 18 when he made his first Bundesliga start in January 2018 -- a chance he most likely would not have had so young in England. ""But he knows very well that he took a positive step in his development at Borussia Dortmund,"" added Zorc. ""I doubt that this would be possible with top English clubs. ""We trust players from an early age and are not afraid to let them play. He (Sancho) acknowledges that."""

We have a clear position. Marco is our captain and will remain so -- there is no reason to change anything,"" director of sport Michael Zorc told reporters before Saturday's home game against Werder Bremen. Reus was fuming when Dortmund conceded a late own goal in Sunday's 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt, leaving them third in the table and three points behind leaders RB Leipzig, drawing fresh questions about the team's mental strength. ""Don't give me your mentality shit now. Every week, the same crap, that's what gets on my nerves,"" an angry Reus told a Sky reporter. An editorial in German daily Bild argued the 30-year-old is the wrong man to lead Dortmund, while some fans called for him to step down. However, Germany stars Julian Brandt and Julian Weigl took to social media to show support for their club captain. ""We have a healthy hierarchy with a lot of experience,"" added Zorc in a nod to Belgium midfielder Axel Witsel and 2014 World Cup winning defender Mats Hummels. Head coach Lucien Favre said Reus ""does his job very, very well"". ""You can get upset that we lost two points, but we have to look forward now,"" added the Swiss coach. Dortmund need a win over Bremen to stave off further questions having already dropped five league points, including three from a shock 3-1 defeat at promoted Union Berlin. However, Zorc sees no cause for concern. ""I don't see us being in the relegation places,"" he said, tongue-in-cheek. ""When I look at the coverage of the last few days, you'd think we are at the end of the season"" having played poorly. ""We have to beat Bremen, then it's two difficult away games,"" against Slavia Prague in the Champions League on Wednesday, having held Barcelona to a goalless draw in their first game, and a tricky league clash at Freiburg four days later. Against Bremen, Dortmund will be without left-back Nico Schulz, who has a foot injury, while Favre said defender Mats Hummels might sit out, without specifying why. ""It's not an injury. We'll see."""

The draw left Dortmund third, three points behind Leipzig and one adrift of defending champions Bayern Munich, who thrashed Cologne 4-0 on Saturday. Unbeaten Leipzig won 3-0 at Werder Bremen. In Frankfurt, goals by Belgium midfielder Axel Witsel and England winger Jadon Sancho either side of an Andre Silva equaliser left Dortmund 2-1 up with full-time approaching before Delaney's costly own goal. Dortmund captain Reus could not hide his frustration. ""We are not seeing the thing through,"" the Germany international told Sky, bristling when asked if his team had a ""mentality problem"". ""Stop asking about this mentality shit -- it's crap and it's the same questions every week."" Dortmund head coach Lucien Favre kept the same starting line-up which drew 0-0 at home to Barcelona in the Champions League in midweek. Germany head coach Joachim Loew was in the stands amid calls from both German legend Lothar Matthaeus and Favre that Mats Hummels should be recalled to the national squad. Hummels, deemed to be past his prime by Loew last March, was outstanding against Barcelona and marshalled the back four in Frankfurt before being replaced on the hour due to a back injury. His experience was badly missed in the dying stages. Dortmund made a bright start when Witsel picked out the bottom corner with 11 minutes gone, but a lapse in concentration let Frankfurt back in just before the break as Silva levelled. Witsel added an assist to his earlier goal as he latched onto the rebound after Raphael Guerreiro's free-kick was saved by Kevin Trapp, teeing up Sancho to tap in his third league goal of the season on 66 minutes. Sancho made way for Germany winger Julian Brandt soon after with Eintracht already pushing for an equaliser before Kamada's volley was diverted in by Delaney. Earlier, French under-21 striker Marcus Thuram came off the bench to score twice in Borussia Moenchengladbach's 2-1 win over Fortuna Duesseldorf. Hosts Gladbach crashed to a shock 4-0 defeat at home by Austrian side Wolfsberg in the Europa League on Thursday and were heading towards a second loss in four days at Borussia Park before Thuram intervened. Ghana defender Kasim Adams gave Duesseldorf a first-half lead, but Thuram turned the game by converting a cross seven minutes after coming on and then tapping home the late winner from a goalmouth scramble. They were Thuram's first Bundesliga goals in only his fifth game since signing from French second-division club Guingamp in July for nine million euros ($9.9m). Gladbach's third win in five games kept them three points back of Leipzig as one of five teams level on 10 points. Fortuna dropped to 12th."

The 22-year-old turned the game after coming on with 67 minutes played for fellow Frenchman Alassane Plea, converting a cross seven minutes after his substitution, then tapped home the winner following a goal-mouth scramble three minutes from time. There were hints of off-side in the build-up to his second goal and Gladbach had a nervous wait while the video assistant referee checked, but Thuram was mobbed by his team-mates when his winner was confirmed. They were Thuram's first Bundesliga goals in only his fifth game since signing from French second-division club Guingamp in July for nine million euros ($9.9m). The home fans' relief at the final whistle was understandable after Fortuna took the lead with only seven minutes gone when a header by Ghana defender Kasim Adams stood after goal-line technology confirmed the ball crossed the line having deflected off the crossbar. Thuram's goals gave Gladbach their third win in five games, lifting them from fifth to eighth in the table, while Fortuna have now lost three of their opening games to drop to 12th. Later Borussia Dortmund can claim second in the table, knocking defending champions Bayern Munich down to third in the process, if they win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Bayern jumped from fourth to second on Saturday with a 4-0 thrashing of Cologne thanks to playmaker Philippe Coutinho's first Bundesliga goal and two from striker Robert Lewandowski. RB Leipzig will finish the weekend in top spot after their 3-0 win at Werder Bremen on Saturday thanks to a Willi Orban header, a superb Marcel Sabitzer free-kick and a late third by substitute Marcelo Saracchi."
126,20/09/2019,19:53,Dortmund boss joins calls for Germany to bring back Hummels,"Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre has waded into the debate about whether Mats Hummels should be recalled by Germany, insisting the in-form centre-back should be included for their upcoming internationals.","In the wake of a disastrous 2018 World Cup campaign in Russia, when the defending champions failed to get out of their group, Joachim Loew booted Hummels, Jerome Boateng and Thomas Mueller out of the Germany set up in March. Hummels left Bayern Munich in June to resurrect his career at former club Dortmund, with whom he won the 2011 and 2012 Bundesliga titles, bringing much-needed stability and experience to their defence. He underlined his impressive form by helping Dortmund to a 4-0 thrashing of Bayer Leverkusen last Saturday in the Bundesliga, then a Champions League goalless draw at home to Barcelona on Tuesday. ""After his last two games, it would be deserved -- without discussion,"" said Favre on Friday. ""It's not up for us to decide, but the way Mats is playing now, it's clear to me."" Dortmund are at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday and the 30-year-old Hummels is expected to again lead the back four having played every minute of Borussia's last six games. Germany's defence was torn open by the Netherlands in last month's 4-2 home defeat in a Euro 2020 qualifier and Bayern great Lothar Matthaeus also believes Hummels' experience is an asset Loew can ill-afford to ignore. ""When he plays like that, he's one of the best central defenders in Germany,"" said Sky pundit Matthaeus, Germany's captain when they won the World Cup in 1990, after the draw with Barcelona. If it had been up to the 58-year-old, Hummels ""wouldn't have been left out"" of the Germany squad ""at all"". Germany host Argentina in a friendly in Dortmund on October 9 before qualifiers against Estonia, Belarus and Northern Ireland later this autumn with the Germans chasing top spot in their group. Hummels is not waiting for a call from Loew, telling magazine Sport Bild this week: ""I try to think about it as little as possible. If it comes, it comes. ""I was always proud to play for Germany and nothing has changed."" Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc agrees with Favre and Matthaeus. ""When we signed Hummels, I already said he is the best German central defender, that was before the season had even started,"" said Zorc. ""I say it now and I think I'll say it again in 2020. ""But at the end of the day, it's up to the national coach to decide. The ball is in his court, not ours."""
127,17/09/2019,23:01,Messi returns as fearless Dortmund frustrate Barcelona,Lionel Messi returned from injury to make an innocuous first appearance of the season as Barcelona were held to a 0-0 draw away at Borussia Dortmund in their Champions League opener on Tuesday.,"Messi, who has missed the start of the season with a calf injury, came off the bench in a game which Barcelona were lucky not to lose after Dortmund captain Marco Reus missed a penalty and several chances in the second half. Lucien Favre's side delivered on their pre-match promise to play fearlessly against five-time European champions Barcelona, probing the visitors from the wings and repeatedly finding gaps in the back line. Both sides had chances in a game of cat and mouse in the first half, but it was Dortmund who looked the more likely to score. Reus was denied at point-blank range by goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Jadon Sancho fired the ball over the crossbar shortly before half-time. The hosts continued to turn the screw after the break, and were rewarded with a penalty when Nelson Semedo tripped Sancho in the box. Yet Ter Stegen denied Reus again from 12 yards, diving low to his left to beat away his Germany team mate's spot-kick. The Barcelona keeper has now saved four of the six penalties he has faced in the Champions League, and was called upon to stop Reus yet again later in the half as Dortmund continued to dominate. A luckless Reus also fired another good chance well high, while substitute Julian Brandt thundered a long-range effort against the crossbar. Messi had begun his 30-minute cameo by that point, having come on around the hour mark for Ansu Fati, the 16-year-old prodigy freshly crowned as Barcelona's youngest ever Champions League debutant. Yet the Argentine remained as blunt as his team mates in a Barcelona attack stifled by the impeccable defending of Dortmund elder statesmen Mats Hummels and Axel Witsel. He nonetheless had a chance to score the winner with the last kick of the game, but was denied by a desperate block from Thomas Delaney. The draw leaves the two teams joint bottom of Group F after one game, after Inter Milan and Slavia Prague played out a 1-1 draw earlier on Tuesday."
128,16/09/2019,20:47,Messi comeback possible as Barcelona launch Champions League charge,Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde said Monday that Lionel Messi could make his comeback against Borussia Dortmund as the Catalan giants launch a fresh assault on the Champions League title in Germany on Tuesday evening.,"Messi, who has missed the beginning of the season with a calf injury, was named in Barcelona's squad for Tuesday's Champions League opener, though it remains unclear whether the Argentinian will play. ""We will decide tomorrow. For the last week we have been unsure whether he will be able to play, but he has trained two or three times and made a good impression. We will see,"" said Valverde at a press conference on Monday. The Barcelona coach refused to say whether 16-year-old Ansu Fati, who became the club's youngest ever goalscorer earlier this month, would break another record by becoming the youngest ever Champions League debutant on Tuesday. ""If he plays, then it will not be because of the record,"" said the coach. Valverde said that his team were looking to put the past behind them after their dramatic semi-final defeat to eventual winners Liverpool in last season's Champions League. ""If you have one bad day, you can be knocked out of this competition. We lost just one match last season, but it was a decisive match,"" he said, adding that Barcelona wanted to go further this year than they had in the past two seasons. Yet Marc Ter Stegen, Barcelona's German keeper, who played under current Dortmund coach Lucien Favre at Borussia Moenchengladbach earlier in his career, warned that Dortmund would provide a tough first test. ""Lucien Favre is one of the best coaches I have ever worked under, and he will have thought of a way to hurt us,"" said the German. ""It is always difficult to come here, and we always struggled here with 'Gladbach, but we will try to win and get a good start to the competition."" ""It is a spectacular stadium and the supporters are always crazy, but we will try not to be influenced by that."" Barcelona have conceded six goals in four games this season and are yet to win away from home. ""We are conceding a lot of goals at the moment, we have to accept that and try to improve,"" Ter Stegen ""Some of the mistakes we are making are easy to correct."""
129,16/09/2019,15:10,Reus plots Dortmund path past Barcelona,"Borussia Dortmund captain Marco Reus insisted Monday that his team could beat Barcelona regardless of whether Lionel Messi plays or not, but feared however that Dortmund would 'have to suffer' when the two sides meet in the Champions League on Tuesday.","Messi is a doubt for Tuesday's game amid ongoing struggles with a calf injury, but Reus suggested Dortmund could win if they play to their own strengths instead of obsessing over the opponent. ""We have to concentrate on ourselves. We have a good team, we are at home, and we can win the game,"" said Reus at a press conference on Monday. ""It will of course be a tough game tomorrow, and we are going to have to suffer a lot,"" he said. Tuesday's Champions League opener is a baptism of fire for Dortmund as they look to qualify from a fiercely difficult group which pits them against Barcelona, Inter Milan and Slavia Prague. Yet Reus said his side were confident they could make a perfect start by beating Barcelona on Tuesday. ""It is important to start well in the group. We are confident enough to say that we can win the game,"" he said. ""We want to test ourselves against the best clubs. We have to be bold, push forward and try to score goals."" Both sides come into the game on the back of impressive results against top-four rivals in their domestic leagues at the weekend, as Dortmund thrashed Bayer Leverkusen 4-0, and Barcelona beat Valencia 5-2. The injured Messi watched that win from the stands, meaning he is still waiting to make his first appearance for Barcelona this season. The 32-year-old has been named in the squad for Tuesday's game, but is expected to make a cameo appearance at most in Dortmund. Reus said he hoped that Messi would be on the pitch on Tuesday evening. ""I would be happy if he played. They are better with him because he has abilities which nobody else has,"" said the Dortmund captain. Dortmund coach Lucien Favre said that it made little difference to his preparations whether Messi would play or not. ""They are good with or without him. They play 4-3-3,"" said the Swiss. ""They were very good against Valencia, when they had a 16-year-old playing in Ansu Fati."" ""They can play football, but they are also good on the counter-attack. We will have to be on our game for 95 minutes tomorrow, and be ready for everything."""
130,14/09/2019,17:38,Alcacer on target again as Dortmund outclass Leverkusen,Spanish striker Paco Alcacer continued his perfect scoring record this season as Borussia Dortmund returned to winning ways with a 4-0 victory over top-four rivals Bayern Leverkusen on Saturday.,"Dortmund were under pressure after a shock defeat to minnows Union Berlin in their last game, but goals from Alcacer, Marco Reus and Raphael Guerreiro secured a much-needed three points for Lucien Favre's side. Alcacer has now scored seven goals in six games in all competitions since the beginning of the season. Dortmund were denied by a brilliant double save from goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky early on before Alcacer gave them the lead just before the half-hour mark. Shaking off his marker and beating the offside trap by a whisker, the in-form Spaniard met an Achraf Hakimi cross on the volley to beat Hradecky from close range. Leverkusen looked the more dangerous side after the break, but Dortmund were more ruthless, and Marco Reus turned in Jadon Sancho's cross to double the lead on 50 minutes. Sancho set up Raphael Guerreiro for Dortmund's third seven minutes from time, before Reus added a fourth in injury time. Elsewhere, Borussia Moenchengladbach ran out 1-0 winners against Cologne in the Rhine derby. Gladbach took the lead on 14 minutes after French striker Alassane Plea swept in a loose ball on the counter-attack, and Cologne spurned a late flurry of chances as the visitors notched up a second win of the season. Augsburg ended their early-season blues with a smash-and-grab 2-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt. Marco Richter opened the scoring against the run of play on 36 minutes, before a brilliant curling strike from Florian Niederlechner doubled Augsburg's lead. Goncalo Paciencia's second-half strike was not enough for Frankfurt, who face Arsenal in the Europa League next Thursday, In Berlin, Werder Bremen did what Dortmund had failed to do two weeks earlier by beating Union 2-1. Bremen's Davy Klaassen and Union's Sebastian Andersson converted early penalties in an even first half. Klaassen then missed a second penalty just after the break, but Niclas Fuellkrug headed in the winner moments later from the resulting corner. Union's capital city neighbours Hertha Berlin continued their disastrous start to the season with a 2-1 defeat away to Mainz. A late goal from Liverpool loanee Marko Grujic cancelled out a first-half tap-in from Robin Quaison, and appeared to save Hertha a point. Yet Jeremiah St Juste's dramatic winner ended a three-game losing run for the hosts, and left Hertha bottom of the table with just one point from four games."
131,02/09/2019,19:43,'It has to stop': England's Sancho fears racism will ruin football,England star Jadon Sancho fears players will lose their love of football unless racist abuse is stamped out.,"Inter Milan striker Romelu Lukaku was the latest victim on Sunday when the former Manchester United player was subjected to monkey chants before taking a penalty at Cagliari. Sancho's England team-mate Marcus Rashford, Manchester United's Paul Pogba and Chelsea duo Tammy Abraham and Kurt Zouma have all endured abuse on social media since the start of the season. A number of England's black players were also the targets of racist taunting during a Euro 2020 qualifier in Montenegro in March. Borussia Dortmund winger Sancho -- an unused substitute for England that night -- is appalled. ""It just has to stop. No player wants to play football and have abuse like that,"" Sancho told reporters after arriving for England duty on Monday. ""It puts the confidence down in players and the love of the sport will go very soon if it doesn't stop. I think everyone should be happy and do what they are doing without receiving racist abuse."" Anti-racism campaigners Kick It Out and the Professional Footballers' Association had separate meetings with Twitter last week, while Manchester United and Chelsea plan to meet the social media platform to discuss racist abuse. Sancho, 19, does not believe the problem is restricted to the internet and he called on fans to show more respect. ""I don't think it's social media. Some fans are just really passionate and obviously they just say what they want to say,"" Sancho said. ""I just feel they need to slow it down at bit - we're still only human. ""Because we play football people might think we are just famous and ignorant to that, but we just love the sport and just want to play football. It is hard to see things like this because it feels like, 'Why should we play football?' ""I felt that Romelu Lukaku handled it very well by not reacting and just carrying on playing."""
132,31/08/2019,21:06,Union Berlin upset Dortmund,"Union Berlin pulled off perhaps the biggest victory in their turbulent history, defeating Borussia Dortmund 3-1 at the Stadion An der Alten Foersterei on Saturday.","Dortmund came into the match heavily favoured to win and reclaim their place on top of the table but struggled to match Berlin's enthusiasm in sweltering conditions in the German capital. Union were 1-0 in the 22nd minute, with Marius Buelter scoring the side's first ever top-flight goal at home. Buelter latched onto a Berlin corner which had been struck low and fast, hammering the ball into the bottom right of the net. The goal stung Dortmund into action, who equalised just two minutes later through Paco Alcacer. Dortmund coasted through the remainder of the first half, dominating possession and territory as they went in search of what seemed like an inevitable second. It was Union who would score next, however, with Buelter grabbing a second by pouncing on a desperate clearance from Dortmund keeper Roman Buerki. Sebastian Andersson added another in the 75th minute to put the home side 3-1 up and seal their first ever win in the top division. Union manager Urs Fischer said he was proud of his side's performance -- and planned on letting them savour the victory. ""We knew that it would be a really difficult 90 minutes -- when you want to take points off (Dortmund) you have to work hard and try everything. And we did it,"" Fischer said. ""I think there might be a beer or two tonight -- we'll see if we get around to completing the video analysis tonight or not."" Dortmund captain Marco Reus said the entire team was to blame for the loss. ""We had plenty of opportunities but the last pass seemed to fail us every time,"" he said. ""We simply didn't put in enough tonight."" Earlier on Saturday, Bayern Munich new boy Ivan Perisic bagged his first goal for the Bundesliga champions as they romped to a 6-1 win over a hapless Mainz at the Allianz Arena. Robert Lewandowski scored his sixth of the season in just three games, while Benjamin Pavard, David Alaba, Kingsley Coman and Alphonso Davies also found the net. In Freiburg, Cologne's Ellyes Skhiri scored the winner in second-half injury time to secure the visitors a 2-1 victory. Freiburg took the lead in the 40th minute through an own goal by Rafael Czichos, before Cologne fan favourite Anthony Modeste equalised in the 52nd minute. Schalke picked up their first win of the season over a disappointing Hertha Berlin at Gelsenkirchen's Veltins Arena. Hertha scored own goals either side of half-time through Niklas Stark and Karim Rekik. English defender Jonjoe Kenny added a third in the 86th minute to make it 3-0 -- the first goal by a Schalke player this season -- to put the game beyond doubt. Wolfsburg and Paderborn fought out a 1-1 draw at the Volkswagen Arena. Newly-promoted Paderborn went ahead through Cauly Souza in the 12th minute, before Josip Brekalo equalised in the 56th minute. At the BayArena, visitors Hoffenheim ended Bayer Leverkusen's 100 percent start to the season as the sides fought out a 0-0 draw. The visitors had to endure a six-minute spell of injury time but held firm against a luckless Leverkusen attack."

""The 26 year-old is now set for several weeks on the sidelines. Get well soon, Thorgan!"" Hazard, who arrived from Munchengladbach during the summer, is likely to miss Dortmund's next two Bundesliga matches at least, against Union Berlin and Bayer Leverkusen. He will probably also miss Belgium's two Euro qualifiers against San Marino and Scotland next month."
134,23/08/2019,04:30,New signings in the spotlight as Bayern look to reboot,New loan signings Ivan Perisic and Philippe Coutinho both hope to make their Bundesliga debuts as champions Bayern Munich attempt to reboot a rocky start to the season at Schalke on Saturday.,"Perisic and Coutinho, both of whom arrived in Munich on loan this month, will be in the squad for the first time as Bayern look to pick up their first win of the new season against David Wagner's Schalke. Coutinho, 27, has been the talk of Germany since Bayern announced his arrival on a one-year loan deal from Barcelona last week. Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic said the Brazilian would provide ""a touch of the spectacular"", and hopes the former Liverpool player can sprinkle some much-needed stardust on the German top-flight. ""Coutinho is an absolutely world-class player. We should all be happy that he is in the Bundesliga,"" former Bayern and Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann told Sky. Bayern announced record engagement figures on their social media accounts following Coutinho's arrival on Monday, but fans may have to wait to see the Brazilian star in action. Coach Niko Kovac confirmed on Thursday Coutinho was not yet fit enough to play the full 90 minutes, and would start on the bench against Schalke. ""I know a lot of people want us to play him straight away, but everything needs to be right,"" said Kovac. The Croatian coach said his compatriot Perisic had better chances of making a first start for Bayern on Sunday. ""Ivan is an option, also for the starting eleven. He is at a higher level of fitness than Philippe,"" said Kovac. Perisic, 30, joined Bayern on a one-year loan from Inter Milan earlier this month, but was forced to sit out the season opener against Hertha Berlin due to a suspension carried over from Serie A. That game confirmed a bumpy start to the new season for Bayern, as they were held to a 2-2 draw and immediately slipped two points behind title rivals Dortmund, who had beaten them in the German Supercup two weeks previously. Under pressure to pick up three points in Gelsenkirchen on Saturday, Kovac warned his side would have to fight against a new-look Schalke led by former Huddersfield boss Wagner. ""It's the first home game for the new coach so they will be motivated,"" said Kovac. ""Huddersfield were one of the teams we used to study. We can expect good defending, good transitions and aggression this weekend."" Bayern will be without the injured Leon Goretzka, while Jerome Boateng and Jann-Fiete Arp are absent due to illness. Dortmund, meanwhile, will welcome back first-choice goalkeeper Roman Buerki when they travel to promoted side Cologne on Friday evening. Buerki, who missed the first three competitive games of the season with an ankle injury, returns to a team still buzzing from their 5-1 mauling of Augsburg in last week's league opener. Yet coach Lucien Favre warned Cologne would be a tougher nut to crack, saying that Friday's opponents would be ""more ready than Augsburg were."" Two of Germany's representatives in European competitions will meet on Sunday as RB Leipzig host Eintracht Frankfurt, while last year's fourth-placed team Bayer Leverkusen hope to build on their opening day win when they visit Fortuna Duesseldorf on Saturday.

135,17/08/2019,17:39,Sancho scores as Dortmund run riot against Augsburg,"Jadon Sancho helped Borussia Dortmund to a 5-1 win over Augsburg in their first game of the new Bundesliga season on Saturday, scoring in the second half to pick up his second goal of the new campaign.","England international Sancho, who claimed his first of the term in Dortmund's Supercup victory over Bayern Munich two weeks ago, found the net just after half-time as Dortmund ran riot to go top of the table. Having thrown away a nine-point lead and narrowly missed out on the title last season, Dortmund had promised another attack on Bayern's hegemony in 2019/20. They were given an early boost when the champions dropped two points against Hertha Berlin in Friday's season opener, before romping to victory in front of their own fans on Saturday. Florian Niederlechner's first-minute opener for Augsburg left Dortmund stunned, but it took the hosts all of two minutes to draw level, as Paco Alcacer gratefully pounced on a mistake from Augsburg keeper Tomas Koubek. Koubek was at fault once again when Sancho put Dortmund ahead after the break, flapping at a low cross before the Englishman smashed the ball in at the far post. The Czech keeper then crowned a miserable Bundesliga debut as he dropped the ball at the feet of Marco Reus to gift Dortmund a third goal. A curling long-range strike from Alcacer and a debut goal for new signing Julian Brandt completed the rout for Dortmund. Elsewhere, Former Dortmund boss Peter Bosz watched his Bayer Leverkusen side stumble their way to a 3-2 victory over promoted minnows Paderborn. Leon Bailey deflected in Kevin Volland's long-range shot to give Leverkusen the lead on 10 minutes, but underdogs Paderborn responded almost immediately through Sven Michel. A nonchalant chip from Kai Havertz quickly restored the lead, but Streli Mamba prodded Paderborn level from a goalmouth scramble just a few minutes later. Kevin Volland slotted home the winner 20 minutes from time to give Leverkusen a hard-earned winning start. Werder Bremen, widely tipped as dark horses in this year's race for Europe, got their season off to the worst possible start with a 3-1 home defeat to Fortuna Duesseldorf. Bremen's Johannes Eggestein cancelled out Rouwen Hennings' first-half opener just after the break, but goals from Kenan Karaman and Kaan Ayhan ensured a perfect afternoon for Duesseldorf. A sweetly timed volley from Maximilian Arnold and a simple finish for Wout Weghorst saw Wolfsburg edge a 2-1 win over promoted side Cologne, while late goals from Lucas Hoeler, Jonathan Schmid and Luca Waldschmidt snatched a 3-0 win for Freiburg over Mainz."
136,15/08/2019,16:21,Dortmund eye Bundesliga title bid amid Bayern transfer trouble,"As the Bundesliga gets back under way this weekend, Borussia Dortmund are preparing to launch an all-out attack on Bayern Munich's seven-year hegemony, and this time they mean it.","Having missed out on the league title by a whisker last year, Dortmund hope that a flurry of new signings and some newfound swagger will be enough for them to finally dethrone Bayern this season. ""We are going into the new season with the intention of challenging for the title -- no ifs, no buts,"" said Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke back in June. With captain Marco Reus and coach Lucien Favre having made similar comments since, Dortmund appear more confident of winning the title than at any point since their last triumph in 2012. Bayern have dominated the league since then, winning seven successive titles and securing a domestic double last season despite falling nine points behind Dortmund in December. Yet as they prepare to launch their title defence against Hertha Berlin on Friday evening, it is Bayern who appear to be struggling, while Dortmund have a spring in their step. Lucien Favre's side have bolstered their ranks with a string of exciting new signings, including Nico Schulz, Thorgan Hazard and Julian Brandt. Perhaps most excitingly of all, they have also lured former captain and 2014 World Cup winner Mats Hummels back from Bayern for a fee of 38 million Euros ($42.4m). In a team which buckled defensively in key games during last year's title race, many Hummels experience and quiet leadership as the missing piece of the jigsaw for Dortmund. Hummels himself has said that he wants to bring some of Bayern's title-deciding mettle to Dortmund. ""You have to recognise that Bayern are not the worst when it comes to a winning mentality. As different as the two clubs are, I want to bring that attitude over to Dortmund,"" he told Kicker magazine this week. While Dortmund approach the new season with optimism, Bayern are still trying to shake off their summertime blues. Following the departures of senior players such as Hummels, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, Bayern have spent the last few months under growing pressure to announce major signings. Though they secured the services of French World Cup winners Benjamin Pavard and Lucas Hernandez earlier this year, their interest in Manchester City winger Leroy Sane and RB Leipzig forward Timo Werner has so far come to nothing. The lack of movement has frustrated senior players, and at the beginning of August, star striker Robert Lewandowski publicly demanded the club make three more signings. The arrival of Croatian winger Ivan Perisic on loan from Inter Milan this week has eased the pressure a little, but coach Niko Kovac said this week that his squad ""still has to strengthen"". Despite defying his critics and securing the double last season, Kovac is still viewed with scepticism in some quarters, and has faced criticism for reverting to a 4-3-3 system in pre-season. Bayern struggled in that formation at the beginning of last season, before a switch to 4-2-3-1 saw results improve. Yet they switched back to 4-3-3 in the German Supercup earlier this month, and limped to a 2-0 defeat to an explosive Dortmund side. ""We made the same mistakes as last year, and I hope they don't happen again,"" moaned Lewandowski after the defeat. Dortmund, meanwhile, hope that the Supercup litmus test will set the tone for the entire season. The real work begins on Saturday, with their opening fixture at home to Augsburg. From then on, there can be no ifs and no buts. This time, Dortmund mean it."

Grosskreutz, a World Cup winner in 2014 and two-time Bundesliga winner with Dortmund, denied his old team early on with a goalline clearance. The underdogs then gave Dortmund a scare at the other end shortly before half-time. English striker Osayamen Osawe skewed a shot wide after pouncing on a mistake by Mats Hummels, who was making his first appearance for Dortmund since returning from Bayern Munich in June. Unfazed, Dortmund took the lead just after half-time, Reus flicking in Manuel Akanji's long ball as the Uerdingen defence came fully undone for the first time. With 20 minutes to play, Alcacer put the game beyond reach with a brilliant direct free-kick. Elsewhere on Friday, Nikola Dovedan's 87th-minute winner fired second-tier Nuremberg to a 1-0 victory over third-division Ingolstadt. Reigning league and cup champions Bayern travel to Energie Cottbus for their first-round tie on Monday."
138,09/08/2019,18:24,Kagawa makes shock switch to Real Zaragoza,Former Manchester United midfielder Shinji Kagawa completed a surprise move from Borussia Dortmund to Spanish second-tier side Real Zaragoza on Friday.,"The 30-year-old has signed a two-year contract with Zaragoza who finished 15th in the Segunda Division last season and have not played in the top flight since 2013. Kagawa has won two Bundesliga titles, one Premier League title, two German Cups and an Asian Cup with Japan, for whom he has played at two World Cups and made 97 appearances. He joined Dortmund nine years ago as a 20-year-old and his electric performances under coach Jurgen Klopp earned him a switch to United and the Premier League in 2012. The Japanese midfielder returned to Dortmund two years later but after a difficult spell in England, he struggled to rediscover his best form and joined Besiktas in January on a six-month loan deal. Kagawa will be presented next week at La Romareda and could make his debut when Zaragoza begin their season at home to Tenerife on August 17. A Zaragoza statement read: ""Real Zaragoza and Borussia Dortmund have reached an agreement for the transfer of footballer Shinji Kagawa, who joins the Zaragoza team with a contract for the next two seasons."" Dortmund wrote on Twitter: ""After 7 amazing seasons in Dortmund, we say goodbye. Forever a Black and Yellow legend."""
139,03/08/2019,23:37,Super Sancho shines as Dortmund deny Bayern fourth straight Super Cup,England forward Jadon Sancho scored a goal and set-up another as Borussia Dortmund beat Bayern Munich 2-0 on Saturday to deny the German league and cup champions a fourth straight Super Cup title.,"Sancho, 19, fed Spain forward Paco Alcacer for Dortmund's opener just after the break before clinching the victory and his side's first trophy since 2017 with a clinical finish within the final half an hour of play. ""We absolutely wanted to win this match, it was very difficult,"" said Dortmund coach Lucien Favre. ""Bayern were very strong and had a lot of possession but we defended well and stayed very compact. ""We knew that we had to go on the counter-attack and we did that very well."" Bayern, who pipped Favre's side to the Bundesliga title last season and lifted the German Cup, were without World Cup winning left-back and new signing Lucas Hernandez due to a knee problem. Dortmund's big name summer arrivals of winger Thorgen Hazard and Julian Brandt, as well as defender Mats Hummels, returning the club after three seasons in Bavaria, were also ruled out due to injuries. Bayern captain Manuel Neuer said errors proved costly. ""We gave Dortmund the match by making too many mistakes,"" Neuer said. ""We made the mistakes all on our own, we gave them possession and that's why we conceded the goals."" The home side, who finished second in the league last season, had a good early chance. Portugal winger Raphael Guerreiro broke down the left flank and cut-back to find captain Marco Reus inside the penalty box. Reus's effort was then well saved by Neuer after less than a minute of play. Neuer was in the action once again after a quarter of an hour as he rushed out of his box to close down Alcacer 30 metres from goal. Alcacer beat Neuer to the ball but his shot dribbled past the goal. Bayern's best opportunity of the first half fell to Kingsley Coman 10 minutes later. He found himself unmarked in the box but his toe-poke shot was saved by Marwin Hitz low to the right. Bayern's inability to make the most of the ball in first 45 minutes came back to bite them almost immediately after the break. Sancho attacked down the left drawing four Bayern defenders with quick step-overs. The teenager fed striker Alcacer at the edge of the box who beat Neuer with a low shot for a 1-0 lead on 48 minutes. Dortmund's lead was doubled with 22 minutes to go from a clinical counter-attack. Sancho was free once again on the right wing, he burst into the box beyond Bayern's back-four and nutmegged the experienced Neuer to make it 2-0. Influential Sancho left the field with 10 minutes to play after seeming to be hurt following an off-the-field challenge by Joshua Kimmich. Bayern coach Niko Kovac brought on Portugal midfielder Renato Sanches and France World Cup winner Benjamin Pavard late-on but they were unable to find the goals to retain the title and the early-season bragging rights. Bayern start the defence of their league title by hosting Hertha Berlin on Friday August 16 and Dortmund play Augsburg a day later."
140,02/08/2019,03:15,Bayern renew battle with Dortmund amid Sane chase,Bayern Munich resume their power struggle with Borussia Dortmund on Saturday for the German Super Cup with the Bavarians chasing Manchester City star Leroy Sane to reinforce their squad.,"The blockbuster Bundesliga curtain-raiser in Dortmund once more pits Germany's top clubs together after Bayern held off a spirited Dortmund challenge to land a seventh straight league title on the final day of last season. ""This is the first title that is important to us,"" said Bayern star Thomas Mueller a fortnight before the new Bundesliga season starts. ""The game has a certain explosiveness. We want to show that we are ready -- we'll put our all into it."" As defender Niklas Suele put it, Bayern ""want to give a sign"" they remain the team to beat in Germany. Dortmund have recruited hard, signing wingers Thorgan Hazard and Julian Brandt -- the latter currently sidelined by injury -- and luring Mats Hummels back from Bayern to beef up the defence. And while Bayern added French world champions Lucas Hernandez and Benjamin Pavard, City winger Sane is the marquee player they crave. According to reports, Bayern have tabled a bid of around 90 million euros ($85 million) -- which would be a club record. They have even reportedly pushed taking the official team photo back to September in the hope the 23-year-old will have joined by then. Head coach Niko Kovac initially declared ""I assume we'll get him"" last weekend, but Bayern have dramatically dialled back. Kovac phoned his City counterpart Pep Guardiola to apologise for recruiting Sane aggressively following criticism from Bayern's senior figures. ""We're all well advised to not talk about players still under contract,"" said sports director Hasan Salihamidzic while chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge also criticised Kovac's bold statement. On Wednesday, Kovac insisted ""what I said was true"" as he still believes in the deal with the transfer window to close in a month's time. Exactly who will line up for Bayern at Dortmund is unclear. Bayern fielded mainly reserve team players in Wednesday's defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the final of their pre-season tournament. Frenchman Kingsley Coman, who suffered a recurrence of a serious ankle injury last season, ""only"" bruised his knee against Spurs, Bayern confirmed. Fellow winger Serge Gnabry is also doubtful with a leg knock, but Kovac indicated both players ""will be back soon"". It will be interesting to see if Jerome Boateng features after coming off the bench against Spurs and missing the crucial penalty in the shoot-out. Bayern are keen to sell the 2014 World Cup winner, but the club's desire to move the 30-year-old on has irritated the squad. ""We've been going round in circles for weeks,"" moaned Mueller. ""This guy Jerome Boateng does us good,"" he added in his team-mate's defence. This will be Dortmund's first key test after winning six pre-season friendlies -- including a 3-2 victory over Champions League holders Liverpool last month on their US tour. They posted a 4-1 win over St Gallen on Tuesday in their Swiss training camp with captain Marco Reus scoring their fourth. ""The Super Cup is very important for us all - to start the season well and show fans what we have planned,"" said Reus. ""However, it's clear neither us nor Bayern are at 100 percent yet."""
141,31/07/2019,19:49,Former World Cup winner Schuerrle heads to Moscow,"Former World Cup winner Andre Schuerrle moved from Borussia Dortmund to Spartak Moscow on a season-long loan deal on Wednesday, the Russian club announced.","The 28-year-old winger, part of Germany's victorious 2014 World Cup squad, spent last season on loan at Fulham but returned to Dortmund following the London club's relegation from the Premier League. Before that, he featured for Chelsea from 2013-2015 after moving for 22 million euros from Bayer Leverkusen. He has also been involved in two other big-money deals -- moving from Chelsea to Wolfsburg for 32 million euros in February 2015 and from Wolfsburg to Dortmund for 30 million euros in July 2016. Schuerrle, who was instrumental in creating the winning goal on Germany's 1-0 win over Argentina in the 2014 World Cup final, endured a disappointing spell at Dortmund, scoring eight goals in 51 games. He has a record of 22 goals in 57 games with Germany but missed out on selection for the 2018 World Cup in Russia."
142,20/07/2019,05:49,Dortmund sink Liverpool in US tour opener,Danish internationals Thomas Delaney and Jacob Bruun Larsen scored second half goals as Borussia Dortmund handed Liverpool a 3-2 defeat in the opening game of the Premier League giants pre-season US tour on Friday.,"In sweltering heat at Notre Dame Stadium in South Bend, Indiana, Bundesliga side Dortmund punished a rusty defensive display from the European champions, who were missing several star players. Brazilian internationals Roberto Firmino and Alisson were both absent for the Reds following their Copa America campaign along with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane, both missing due to the African Cup of Nations. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp opted for a youthful starting line-up against his former club before making 10 changes in the second half. ""It was a very difficult game for both teams,"" Klopp said afterwards. ""I saw a lot of good things, and a lot of good individual performances, but obviously not enough. ""We're obviously not anywhere near where we want to be,"" he added, referring to the goals his team conceded. Dortmund took the lead after only three minutes when Paco Alcacer capitalised on some hesitant defending from Liverpool defender Nathaniel Clyne to rifle home from close range. Liverpool soon began to carve out openings of their own however, and the lively Ryan Kent and Harry Wilson always looked threatening. Kent almost equalised in the 10th minute after a driving run by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Oxlade-Chamberlain's pass to the back post was perfectly weighted but Kent's shot was blocked after a superb diving save from Dortmund goalkeeper Martin Hitz. Hitz needed to be alert soon afterwards, when a fine through ball by James Milner released Wilson. Wilson latched onto the pass and shot for goal, but Hitz had read the danger, advancing off his line to save. Liverpool finally drew level with a cleverly worked goal in the 35th minute. Again, Kent and Wilson were involved. Fabinho's pass into the area was brilliantly dummied by Kent into the path of Wilson, who calmly stroked home the finish. But despite the bright opening 45 minutes, Liverpool were soon trailing again early in the second half as Dortmund once more seized on sloppy defensive play to score two quick goals. Delaney, one of nine Dortmund changes made at half-time, made it 2-1 in the 53rd minute after Liverpool's defence were caught square. Six minutes later Bruun Larsen fired Dortmund into a 3-1 lead after burying Marius Wolf's cutback into the bottom corner. That goal was the cue for Klopp to make wholesale substitutions of his own, removing all 10 outfield players on the one hour mark. A Rhian Brewster penalty in the 75th minute after Ben Woodburn was brought down cut Dortmund's lead to a single goal. But Liverpool were unable to find an equaliser in the closing stages. Liverpool face Spanish side Sevilla on Sunday at Boston's Fenway Park baseball stadium in the second game of their three-match US tour."
143,19/07/2019,01:13,Klopp committed to Liverpool,Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said Thursday he expects to remain at Anfield for at least three more years as the Premier League giants prepare to kick off their pre-season tour to North America.,"Klopp, who successfully guided Liverpool to a sixth Champions League crown last month, was taken aback when asked to comment on reports suggesting he may leave the club when his current contract expires in 2022. ""Wow! I don't think a lot of people get asked that question three years before the contract is expiring,"" Klopp said. ""We will see. Why should we think about this? At least three years - that's the answer. At least three years."" ESPN reported last month that Klopp was pondering a sabbatical when his Liverpool contract ends. Agent Mark Kosicke meanwhile has hinted that Klopp may be interested in taking over as coach of the German national team. Klopp however was solely focused on preparations for the coming season on Thursday as the Reds begin a three-game US tour that starts on Friday against Borussia Dortmund in South Bend, Indiana. ""I'm excited about having the first proper test,"" said Klopp, who added that he is not overly concerned by results during the tour. ""So far, so good but there is a lot of work to do,"" said Klopp. ""We played at a specific level last year which should be the basis for what we expect from ourselves for next season. ""It's not about results, it's about performance and there is still space for improvement and that's what we are working on. We know that."" Liverpool's preparations have been disrupted by the international football calendar. Goalkeeper Alisson and forward Roberto Firmino will only join the squad later in the pre-season following their Copa America campaign with Brazil, while striker Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane are also absent due to African Cup of Nations commitments with Egypt and Senegal. ""It's a slightly different situation to last year; players coming back late, we had a shorter holiday than pretty much all the other teams because the Champions League final was three weeks after the season ended,"" he said. ""So that's the situation but we knew that, we planned that. It still makes it a bit more difficult than in other pre-seasons maybe, but that's all. Klopp meanwhile said Liverpool were girding themselves for another daunting title chase with Manchester City, who pipped them to the Premier League crown on the final day of the season. However Klopp said he expected other teams to improve. ""It would be great if we could be around Man City again because that's the only possibility to have to pass them because it is already clear they are the big favourite again,"" Klopp said. ""All the teams will start again: there is no duel with City and Liverpool and all the rest are watching us. That's not how the Premier League is, all of these games are so difficult to play. ""What we did last year, we were really rock solid in all; we were difficult to play, difficult to outplay, in general we always created chances, we were strong in a lot of departments, didn't get nervous in difficult situations in a game, could increase pressure in different situations on the other teams."""
144,18/05/2019,04:30,Five historic last-day Bundesliga title battles,"The Bundesliga title race has gone down to the wire this year, with Bayern Munich just two points ahead of Borussia Dortmund going into the final round of games on Saturday.","Bayern need just a point to seal a seventh straight league crown, but after the twists and turns of recent weeks, Dortmund are hoping to spring one final surprise. It is the first time in ten years that the title race has been decided on the last weekend, as Bayern have dominated the last decade. Yet the Bundesliga has had its fair share of final day drama over the years. Bayern will be crowned German champions for the 29th time if they win on Saturday, but ahead of the final day in 1971, both they and Borussia Moenchengladbach were targeting only a second ever Bundesliga title. Much like this year, Bayern topped the table going into the last day, but Franz Beckenbauer and company succumbed to a shock 2-0 defeat to mid-table Duisburg. Gladbach, meanwhile, beat Frankfurt 4-1 thanks to a brace from future Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes, and became the first team to defend the Bundesliga title. Even if they don't win the title, Dortmund will be hoping to avoid a repeat of the last day in 1978 when they face Gladbach on Saturday. On that day, Gladbach thrashed Dortmund 12-0 as they attempted to overcome a huge goal difference deficit to local rivals and league leaders Cologne. Even that wasn't enough, as Cologne won 5-0 at St. Pauli and took the title by a margin of three goals. In one of the closest title races of all time, three teams were level on points going into the final day in 1992. Eintracht Frankfurt threw away their chance with 2-1 defeat away to Hansa Rostock, while Dortmund were on course to edge it as they led Duisburg 1-0 with five minutes to go. Guido Buchwald's late header in Leverkusen, however, gave Stuttgart a 2-1 victory and the title on goal difference. Bayer Leverkusen came close to a first Bundesliga title themselves eight years later, but lost out to Bayern in the cruellest of circumstances. Three points up and needing only a draw at mid-table Unterhaching, Leverkusen went behind early on thanks to an own-goal from Michael Ballack. They eventually lost 2-0, and Ballack cried his eyes out as Bayern won 3-1 in Bremen to snatch the title from Leverkusen. Few final days have been as emotional as 2001, when Schalke celebrated the title for four minutes, only to have it wrenched away from them by an indirect free-kick. Schalke, who had not won the title since 1958, needed Bayern to lose in Hamburg and to win against Unterhaching in the last ever game at their old Parkstadion. Sergej Barbarez put Hamburg 1-0 up in the 89th minute, and having won 5-3 themselves, Schalke fans stormed the pitch believing they had been crowned champions. Yet minutes later, Patrik Andersson smashed in after an indirect free-kick with the last kick of the game to draw Bayern level, keep the title in Munich and break thousands of Schalke hearts."
145,17/05/2019,16:12,'A lot of unrest' - Leipzig coach Rangnick hoping Bayern lose title,RB Leipzig coach Ralf Rangnick has said that his team will benefit if Bayern Munich surrender the Bundesliga title to Borussia Dortmund on Saturday.,"Bayern go into the final round of games two points ahead of Dortmund, and hope to wrap up a seventh straight title before they face Leipzig in the German Cup final in Berlin next weekend. ""If Bayern were to lose out on the title from the good position they are in, then it would lead to a lot of unrest,"" Rangnick told AFP subsidiary SID on Friday. ""In terms of preparation for the cup final, that certainly wouldn't be an advantage for them."" Bayern will be crowned champions unless they lose at home to Frankfurt and Dortmund beat Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday. Leipzig, meanwhile, hope to ruin Bayern's domestic double hopes and secure the first major trophy of their 10-year history in Berlin on May 25."
146,17/05/2019,02:10,"Favre, Kovac face old friends as Bundesliga finale grips Germany",Bayern Munich coach Niko Kovac and his Borussia Dortmund counterpart Lucien Favre both face a trip down memory lane on Saturday as the Bundesliga braces itself for the most nail-biting season finale in years.,"Both Kovac and Favre will face their former clubs on a much-anticipated final day, as the title race goes down to the last weekend of the season for the first time since 2010. Bayern currently sit two points ahead of Dortmund, and can claim a seventh straight league crown if they avoid defeat at home by Kovac's old club Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. Dortmund, meanwhile, travel to Favre's old hunting ground at Borussia Moenchengladbach, knowing that they can only be crowned champions if they win and Bayern lose. ""We need to focus on our game,"" said Favre on Thursday, adding that Dortmund needed to be prepared for all eventualities against Gladbach, whom he coached between 2011 and 2015. ""They play well on the counter-attack, but they can also press high up the pitch, and they need to win too,"" he said. There is more than the title at stake on Saturday, with both Gladbach and Frankfurt still in the running for Champions League qualification. Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc joked on Thursday that he would not send Frankfurt a crate of beer if they beat Bayern. ""They have something to play for, so they don't need any extra motivation,"" he said. Zorc admitted that Bayern were in ""pole position"", but confirmed that the club were making plans for a potential title celebration in the Dortmund town centre. ""We are hugely looking forward to the game, and the excitement will rise when we are on the way to the stadium, those are nice moments,"" he said. Bayern coach Kovac said on Thursday that he was proud to be on the verge of the title, having trailed Dortmund by nine points in December. ""In winter, we just hoped we would have any chance at all on the final day, and now we are in the comfortable situation of having it in our own hands,"" he said. The Croatian said he was expecting an emotional afternoon on Saturday, when his old club Frankfurt come to Munich. Bayern have not won the title in front of their own fans since 2000, and are preparing to bid farewell to club icons Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery. ""There hasn't been a situation like this in Munich for a while, and we want to bring the fans with us on Saturday,"" he said. Kovac, who steered Frankfurt away from relegation in 2016 before leading them to glory in the German Cup last season, said that the pressure to win the title was nothing compared to a relegation fight. ""When you are fighting for your existence, that is something different,"" he said. Yet the under-fire coach knows that Saturday's meeting with his Frankfurt past could yet define his Bayern future. Rumours that Kovac is on the verge of the sack have increased in the build-up to the Frankfurt game, but the Croatian was philosophical on Thursday. ""I like the job but I am also independent. I have always been a fighter and have never given up,"" he said. With Saturday's title decider and next weekend's German Cup final against RB Leipzig, Kovac has two chances to win silverware in the next week, and is determined to take both of them. ""We must win trophies,"" he said."
147,16/05/2019,13:39,'Everything is possible' - Dortmund boss Favre,"Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre says ""everything is possible"" as his side prepare to make one desperate final bid for the Bundesliga title against Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday.","Dortmund are two points behind league leaders Bayern Munich ahead of the last day of the season, and can only be crowned champions on Saturday if they beat Gladbach and Bayern lose at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Gladbach and Frankfurt also have much to play for, with both clubs still in the race for Champions League qualification. ""The league is exciting until the end this year, and that is good for the Bundesliga,"" said Favre at the pre-match press conference on Thursday. ""Everything is possible but I don't want to talk about (our title chances). We have to concentrate on our game."" Sporting director Michael Zorc said that Dortmund were proud to have kept the title race alive until the last day, but admitted that his team had only an outside chance of snatching the title. ""We know that Bayern are in pole position,"" he said."
148,11/05/2019,18:02,Dortmund take title race to wire as Bayern held,Bayern Munich missed the chance to wrap up a seventh successive Bundesliga title as they were held to a goalless draw at RB Leipzig on Saturday and rivals Borussia Dortmund edged a nervy 3-2 win over Fortuna Duesseldorf.,"Chelsea-bound US international Christian Pulisic found the net in his final home game for Dortmund, helping them to battle back to within two points of league leaders Bayern ahead of the final round of games next weekend. Bayern can now secure the title with a win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt next Saturday, while Dortmund must win at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Dortmund, who looked dead and buried after slipping four points behind last week, enjoyed the rub of the green as they stumbled to victory over Duesseldorf. Pulisic, who will join Chelsea next season, bid an emotional farewell to the Dortmund fans before the game and then opened the scoring on 41 minutes. A howler from stand-in goalkeeper Marwin Hitz allowed Oliver Fink to equalise, but Thomas Delaney restored the lead for Dortmund. Hitz then gave away a penalty with a foul on Dodi Lukebakio, but the Belgian dragged the ball wide from 12 yards. Mario Goetze appeared to seal the win for Dortmund on 90 minutes, but Dawid Kownacki pulled one back for Duesseldorf minutes later to make it a nerve-jangling finish for the hosts. In Leipzig, Leon Goretzka's stylish scissor-kick sent Bayern into ecstasy after half-time, but the goal was ruled out by VAR. Serge Gnabry hit the bar later in the second half, but Bayern could not force the winner. At the other end of the table, Nuremberg and Hanover were finally relegated as Stuttgart secured the relegation play-off place with a 3-0 win over Wolfsburg. Hanover went down fighting as goals from Waldemar Anton, Ihlas Bebou and Walace saw them beat Freiburg 3-0. Yet Anastasios Donis, Gonzalo Castro and Daniel Didavi were on the mark for Stuttgart to condemn Hanover and Nuremberg to the drop. Nuremberg, meanwhile, suffered a 4-0 defeat to Borussia Moenchengladbach thanks to an own-goal from Lukas Muehl and strikes from Thorgan Hazard, Denis Zakaria and former Nuremberg man Josip Drmic. The thumping win sees Gladbach go fourth overnight, leapfrogging both Eintracht Frankfurt and Bayer Leverkusen, who were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Schalke, Guido Burgstaller cancelling out Kai Havertz's opener. Frankfurt have the chance to break back into the top four with a win over Mainz on Sunday. Werder Bremen also kept their European hopes alive with a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim, and Hertha Berlin snatched a late 4-3 victory away to Augsburg. Johannes Eggestein's first-half goal condemned RB Leipzig-bound coach Julian Nagelsmann to defeat in his last home game in charge of Hoffenheim. Andre Hahn and Michael Gregoritsch put Augsburg ahead three times but goals from Marvin Plattenhardt and Marko Grujic kept Hertha in the game before a late brace from Salomon Kalou secured three points."
149,03/05/2019,15:13,'Everything is possible' - Favre revives Dortmund title hopes,Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre has said that his side's Bundesliga title hopes are now alive and well despite declaring them dead last weekend.,"The Swiss coach said that the title race was over last Saturday, after his side's 4-2 derby defeat to Schalke gave title rivals Bayern Munich the chance to pull four points clear at the top of the table. Yet Bayern were then held to a surprise draw away to relegation strugglers Nuremberg the following day, keeping them just two points ahead of Dortmund with three games to go. Ahead of his side's difficult trip to Werder Bremen on Saturday, Favre said that Bayern's slip had given his team new hope. ""Everyone thought it was over, but we didn't think Bayern would draw in Nuremberg. Now everything is possible,"" he said on Friday. ""The players see the table and they saw the Bayern result, which changes everything."" ""They know that it is possible (to win the title), and we have been working on this conviction all week."" Dortmund remain under pressure to deliver against Bremen on Saturday evening, however. With Bayern playing bottom club Hanover at home earlier in the day, Favre's side can expect to be five points behind the league leaders and in need of a win by the time they kick off against Bremen. If they beat Bremen, the title race looks set to go down to the wire, with Bayern facing two tough games against RB Leipzig and Eintracht Frankfurt on the last two days of the season. Dortmund have an only slightly easier run-in, with games against Fortuna Duesseldorf and Borussia Moenchengladbach."
150,03/05/2019,03:15,Robben and Ribery hope to return for nervy title run-in,Bayern Munich coach Niko Kovac has said that veteran wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery will be on hand to help his side hold their nerve in the last weeks of a tense Bundesliga title race.,"League leaders Bayern, who host bottom club Hanover on Saturday, currently sit two points ahead of rivals Borussia Dortmund with three games to go. Kovac said on Thursday that the title race would be a ""question of nerves"", and said that he hoped to be able to count on the experience of club legends Robben, 35, and Ribery, 36. The long-serving Dutch and French superstars are both expected to leave the club at the end of the season, though there had been fears that injury problems would deny both men a fitting send-off. Robben has been out of action since November with thigh and calf problems, while Ribery has missed the last two weeks with muscle injuries. Yet Kovac said that both players were ""doing well"" and he expects them to play a role in the Bundesliga run-in and German Cup final later this month. ""I am very positive that the two of them will contest these four games alongside us,"" he said. ""We won't throw everything over board in order to give someone a send-off, but we want to see that they get a few minutes on the pitch."" The departure of Robben and Ribery after 10 and 12 years respectively is just one element of a major generational shift expected at Bayern this summer. The Munich giants have already completed the signings of young French defenders Benjamin Pavard and Lucas Hernandez, and reports in the German press this week suggested that senior players Mats Hummels and Thomas Mueller are considering a move away. For now, though, Kovac is focused on crowning his first season in charge with a league and cup double. ""The runner-up is always just the first of the losers, only winning counts,"" he said. ""I hope that we can wrap up the title before the last day of the season."" Bayern missed the chance to go four points clear of Dortmund when they were held to a draw at relegation-threatened Nuremberg last Sunday, and Kovac urged his team to bounce back against Hanover. ""The team knows that they missed a big opportunity against Nuremberg, but they are only human,"" he said. ""We need to be better this weekend."" A win over Hanover would pile the pressure on Dortmund, who face a tough trip to Werder Bremen on Saturday. Dortmund coach Lucien Favre declared the title race was over after his side's derby defeat to Schalke last weekend, and now faces the next two games without captain Marco Reus, who was suspended for his red-card challenge on Schalke's Suat Serdar. Favre is expected to play Paco Alcacer and Mario Goetze up front in Reus' absence, as Dortmund look to at least keep within two points of Bayern. Club CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke rubbished Favre's claim that the title was already lost this week, saying that Dortmund would fight until the bitter end. ""We will do everything we can to try and catch them,"" Watzke told AFP subsidiary SID on Monday. ""It has been a long time since the league leader has had only a two-point lead with three games to go, and that is good for the Bundesliga."" Elsewhere, both Hanover and Nuremberg could be relegated this weekend if they lose to Bayern and Wolfsburg respectively, and Stuttgart beat Hertha Berlin."
151,02/05/2019,13:23,'Whether we win the league or not' - Favre given job guarantee,"Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre will remain in his job next season regardless of whether or not Dortmund win the Bundesliga title this month, the club's sporting director Michael Zorc has said.","""We will definitely go into the new season with Lucien Favre, whether we win the league or not,"" Zorc told Kicker magazine on Thursday. Dortmund are two points behind Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga title race with three games to go, having held a nine-point lead over their rivals back in December. After recent humiliating defeats to both Bayern and local rivals Schalke, many had questioned whether Favre had what it took to lead Dortmund to their first title since 2012. Bild, the German tabloid, asserted that Favre should leave if he didn't win the league. Yet Zorc insisted that Favre had the full backing of the club, and even said he was confident that the Swiss coach would extend his current contract beyond 2020. ""We have a very good relationship of trust, and we will hold contract talks,"" said the Dortmund sporting director. The club hierarchy rebuked Favre after he declared the title race over following defeat to Schalke last weekend. ""We will never give up hope and we will fight to the end, that is part of our DNA,"" Dortmund players' director Sebastian Kehl told Kicker on Thursday. Dortmund face a tough trip to Werder Bremen this Saturday, before playing Fortuna Duesseldorf and Borussia Moenchengladbach in their last two games. League leaders Bayern, meanwhile, host bottom club Hanover on Saturday, before clashes with top four sides RB Leipzig and Eintracht Frankfurt."

Dortmund will travel to Werder Bremen and host Fortuna Duesseldorf without Reus in the next two weeks, as they look to make up a two-point gap between themselves and league leaders Bayern Munich. The Dortmund captain was given a straight red card for a studs-up challenge on Suat Serdar during Dortmund's shock 4-2 loss to local rivals Schalke. Reus' team mate Marius Wolf, who was also sent off on Saturday for a similar challenge on Serdar, will be suspended until the end of the season. The DFB said that they had handed a more severe ban to Wolf because, unlike Reus, he had not had ""no chance of reaching the ball with his tackle"". After Dortmund's defeat to Schalke, Bayern missed the chance to go four points clear when they were held to a draw at Nuremberg on Sunday."

Ahead of Saturday's derby with Schalke, Dortmund CEO Watzke claimed that ""70 percent of Germans"" wanted his club to win the title, and that hardly anybody would turn up to celebrate if Bayern were crowned champions. ""When they celebrate in the (Munich central square) Marienplatz, there will be about 3000 people and maybe 1500 tourists there."" ""In Dortmund, the title celebration is another thing entirely."" Watzke's side promptly lost 4-2 to rivals Schalke, giving Bayern the chance to pull four points clear on Sunday, and Bayern sporting director Salihamidzic couldn't resist a sarcastic response. ""Maybe we will invite Mr Watzke to our title celebration, then he will see that there are many thousands of people there,"" he told Sky on Sunday. Yet Salihamidzic was also forced to eat his words after Bayern were held to a 1-1 draw by strugglers Nuremberg. Bayern are now two points ahead of Dortmund with three games to go, and still have to face top four sides RB Leipzig and Eintracht Frankfurt. Dortmund coach Lucien Favre declared the title race over after Saturday's crushing derby defeat, but Watzke contradicted him on Sunday. ""We will only give up when we have no mathematical chance anymore, we owe that to the fans,"" he told kicker magazine."

""I have reached a personal agreement with Dortmund,"" said Hazard in a video interview published by VTM on Saturday. ""I have said before that I want to take the next step in my career. I want to experience something new."" ""It is up to the clubs, there are talks between Gladbach and Dortmund. It will take time."" Various German outlets, including kicker magazine and Bild newspaper, reported in April that Hazard was on the brink of a move to Dortmund after five years at Gladbach. Hazard joined the Bundesliga club on loan from Chelsea in 2014, and completed a permanent move the following year. His current contract expires at the end of next season, meaning Gladbach risk losing him on a free transfer if they do not sell him this year. Gladbach sporting director Max Eber has previously ruled out allowing Hazard to leave for no fee."

League leaders Bayern can now pull four points clear at the top with three games to go with a win at relegation-threatened Nuremberg on Sunday. Asked on Sky Germany whether the title race was over, Dortmund coach Favre said: ""yes, of course"". Dortmund took the lead in style on 14 minutes, Jadon Sancho setting up Mario Goetze with a splendid chip over Schalke's back line. However Schalke drew level just two minutes later, Daniel Caligiuri converting a contested penalty after a handball decision against Julian Weigl. Favre railed against the decision, saying that new regulations on handball were ""the biggest scandal in football"". ""Football is making itself a laughing stock,"" said the usually reserved Swiss. ""What do they want players to do, cut their arms off?"" ""The people who invented these rules, I don't know how they look at themselves in the mirror."" Two minutes later the visitors sent the Signal-Iduna-Park into shock as Salif Sane rose at a corner to put Schalke ahead. Double disaster struck for Dortmund on the hour mark when captain Marco Reus was sent off for a studs-up challenge on Suat Serdar and Caligiuri curled the resulting free-kick into the top corner. Marius Wolf then became the second Dortmund player sent off, once again for a reckless challenge on Serdar. Axel Witsel pulled one back for Dortmund with five minutes remaining, but their hopes were crushed a moment later when Breel Embolo fired in Schalke's fourth. Elsewhere, RB Leipzig secured Champions League qualification with a 2-1 win over Freiburg, while fourth-place Eintracht Frankfurt were held to a 0-0 draw by Hertha Berlin. Freiburg's Vicenzo Grifo became the first opposing player to score in Leipzig since February, cheekily converting a free-kick before goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi was ready. Yet goals from Timo Werner and Emil Forsberg gave Leipzig a sixth straight win. Werder Bremen's hopes of qualifying for Europe suffered a blow as they lost 4-1 at Fortuna Duesseldorf. They are five points off the Europa league places after a defeat in which Benito Raman put the hosts ahead after just 55 seconds, and Kenan Karaman doubled the lead on 23 minutes. A Max Kruse penalty restored hope for Werder, but second half goals from Rouwen Hennings and Markus Suttner sealed the home win. At the other end of the table, Henrik Weydandt fired bottom club Hanover to a 1-0 win over Mainz that means they still could escape relegation."

Yet Belgian veteran Witsel, 30, admitted that he and others such as Marco Reus and Marcel Schmelzer have made sure that the 19-year-old does not get too big for his boots. ""There was a time when he didn't really take care to turn up to training on time,"" Witsel told Bild newspaper on Saturday. ""We had to have words with him."" Witsel also lavished praise on Sancho, saying that he was a ""special"" player, and that his attitude had improved during the season. ""He seems to have listened to us, because he has got much better,"" said the Belgian international. ""Jadon has enormous quality, and he can always make the difference with his tricks and his dribbling."" Witsel compared Sancho to his Belgium teammate Eden Hazard, and said that the English youngster had the potential to become a global star. The well-travelled 30-year-old, who has brought some much-needed stability to Dortmund's midfield since joining from Chinese club Tianjin Tianhai at the beginning of the season, also insisted that his team can still win the Bundesliga title. Dortmund currently sit a point behind league leaders Bayern Munich with four games to play, the first of which is Saturday's derby at home to Schalke. ""Everything is possible. We have a tough run-in, but so do Bayern. Right now, we are not looking beyond the derby,"" said Witsel."

While Dortmund need a win to keep the heat on league leaders Bayern Munich in the title race, Schalke could all but secure Bundesliga survival with victory in the derby. Just 35 kilometres separates the two teams geographically, but they are worlds apart in footballing terms this season, with Dortmund in second and Schalke in 15th. Yet Danish midfielder Delaney has warned that the table means nothing on derby day. ""The derby has a life of its own, so where we are in the table doesn't mean anything,"" he said on Thursday. On form alone, Dortmund are clear favourites. Schalke have won only once away from home this season - against bottom club Hanover - while Dortmund are yet to lose at home. While Delaney and co. wrapped up a confidence-boosting 4-0 win in Freiburg last week, Schalke were thrashed 5-2 by Hoffenheim. Nonetheless, the Dane is expecting an ""intense"" game. ""It probably won't be the most attractive game. I don't think we are going to win 9-2,"" he said. Dortmund coach Lucien Favre has said that there is no extra pressure on Dortmund in the derby. ""The pressure is always there. We want to win this important game,"" he said on Thursday. Favre's opposite number Huub Stevens, meanwhile, claimed that both sides were feeling the heat. ""We can't pretend otherwise: they are playing for the title, and we are fighting for something else,"" the veteran Dutch coach said on Thursday. ""We are both under pressure, but they have positive pressure."" Schalke are six points clear of the bottom three and could effectively guarantee survival with a win against Dortmund. Yet Stevens' preparations for the derby have been overshadowed by disciplinary issues. The interim coach has banished Nabil Bentaleb to the reserve team for the second time this season after the Algerian midfielder missed a pre-training German lesson on Wednesday. ""I'm sorry for Nabil, but I did what I had to do. The team is still the most important thing,"" said the coach. Stevens, who was charged with guiding Schalke to safety when he took over from Domenico Tedesco last month, also suggested that there were fundamental problems with the team. ""I cannot talk about everything honestly,"" he said. ""Maybe I will be able to one day, either internally or publically. I don't know."" Despite Schalke's woes this season, there is little schadenfreude from their old rivals, and Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc said this week that he hopes Schalke stay up. ""We think it is good if this rivalry can continue in the top flight,"" he said. Dortmund themselves remain focused on the title race, in which they remain just a single point behind leaders Bayern. Hopes that Bayern will slip up may have to be put on ice for at least a week or two. The reigning champions travel to second-from-bottom Nuremberg on Sunday before hosting crisis-ridden Hanover the following weekend. Bayern are also in ferocious form, having scored 18 goals in their last five games. ""It isn't in our hands, we just have to try to win all our games,"" said Delaney on Thursday. ""Bayern are doing everything right at the moment."""
159,25/04/2019,02:33,Bayern target Nuebel in spotlight ahead of Ruhr derby,"Schalke goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel was a bench-warmer at the start of the season, but ahead of this weekend's derby in Dortmund, he looks set to walk in the footsteps of Manuel Neuer.","Nuebel, 22, has been one of the few players to have shone in a dreadful year for Schalke. His performances between the posts have kept relegation at arm's length and reportedly piqued the interest of Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich. With Schalke now just one place above the bottom three, Nuebel hopes to restore some lost pride for his current club when they take on old rivals Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. Nuebel, who joined Schalke from Paderborn at the age of 18, began the season playing second fiddle to more experienced goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann. Runners-up last year, Schalke slumped into a relegation fight this season. When Faehrmann fell out of favour, Nuebel grabbed his chance by the horns. Promoted to number one in January by then Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco, Nuebel earned plaudits for his performances, even as Tedesco's reign began to implode. Amid a growing chorus of boos from the terraces in Gelsenkirchen, he has been one of the few players to receive recognition from the fans. After a 3-0 defeat to Mainz in February, Schalke fans taunted the players, chanting: ""Apart from Nuebel, you can all go"". His form has also earned him comparisons with Bayern's superstar keeper, with Bild newspaper nicknaming Nuebel ""mini-Neuer"". Neuer too was the standout player in a forgettable season for Schalke back in 2011, just before the Germany number one moved to Munich. Speculation is now rife that Nuebel may follow the same path. ""Alex is allowed to think about a move, contracts are not one-sided,"" Nuebel's agent Stefan Backs told Sport1 earlier this month. ""If Schalke get a big transfer fee for Alex, like they did with Neuer, then it will be a good bit of business."" With Nuebel's current contract set to expire in 2020, Schalke may have to sell him at the end of this season if they are not to lose him on a free transfer. Nuebel himself has reportedly put off any contract discussions until after the Under-21 European Championships in June, but he has been peppered with contradictory advice of late. Last Sunday, former Bayern and Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann urged the young keeper to join Bayern. ""Even a year training next to Manuel Neuer is better than being first choice keeper at Schalke,"" he said. Bayern's number two Sven Ulreich, on the other hand, said that a move to Bayern would ""make no sense"" for Nuebel. ""I don't think that, at 22 years old, he will want to be Manuel's number two. If he comes, he will want to play,"" Ulreich told SportBild magazine on Wednesday. At Schalke, at least, Nuebel is guaranteed game time, having held on to his number one spot even after Tedesco was replaced by interim coach Huub Stevens. ""It is always difficult when a coach leaves, and I have had four coaches in four years at Schalke,"" Nuebel told WAZ newspaper last month. ""The exciting thing about this club is that you get ups and downs."" Nuebel has certainly had that at Schalke. Having watched from the bench as the club recorded their highest league finish in eight years last season, he is now the hero of this season's horror show. With a six-point lead over third-from-bottom Stuttgart, a win over Dortmund in the derby could see Schalke all but secure survival on Saturday. If they do so, it will be down in no small part to their 22-year-old goalkeeper."
160,21/04/2019,20:33,Dortmund keep heat on Bayern with Freiburg win,Captain Marco Reus played through pain to inspire Borussia Dortmund to a 4-0 win over Freiburg on Sunday and keep them on the heels of Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich.,"Reus took a knock to his knee in a heavy challenge from Freiburg's Janik Haberer in the second half, but fired Dortmund to victory with a goal and two assists to keep them a point behind Bayern. After a heavy defeat to Bayern two weeks ago and a nervy win over Mainz last Sunday, Reus insisted the display showed that his team were back to their best and ready to take the fight to Bayern in the title race. ""The last few weeks didn't quite go as we had hoped, but it was important that we stuck together in the difficult moments,"" the Dortmund captain told Sky. ""We still believe we can be champions and we want to keep the pressure on Bayern until the very end."" Dortmund needed three points on Sunday after Bayern beat Werder Bremen 1-0 on Saturday. Far from buckling in a nail-biting title race, Dortmund delivered one of their most confident recent performances. A silky move in the box saw Dortmund take the lead after 12 minutes, with Raphael Guerreiro and Marco Reus linking to provide Jadon Sancho with a tap-in. Guerreiro, returning to action after two weeks out injured, then set up Reus for Dortmund's second eight minutes after half-time. Lucien Favre's side survived a handful of Freiburg chances before a brutal counter-attack saw Reus set up Mario Goetze to make it 3-0. Paco Alcacer completed a perfect afternoon for Dortmund, converting a late penalty after a Pascal Stenzel handball. Dortmund face local rivals Schalke in the Ruhr derby next Saturday, before Bayern travel to take on Nuremberg the following day. Elsewhere on Sunday, Hanover slipped further towards relegation despite holding Hertha Berlin to a 0-0 draw away from home. Davie Selke and Ondrej Duda both missed golden opportunities to win the game for Hertha, who nonetheless broke a five-game losing streak. Waldemar Anton and Florent Muslija came close for Hanover, but Thomas Doll's side remain rooted to the bottom of the table, six points adrift of the relegation play-off place. ""A point is too little. We could have got more from the game today because Hertha were not at their best,"" said Hanover coach Doll, who nonetheless praised his team's mentality. ""The lads are showing on the pitch that they want to fight, and we have managed to create a good atmosphere around the team. The fans aren't booing us."""

The game also sparked some soul-searching within the Dortmund ranks, with captain Marco Reus saying that the team would have to play ""beyond their limits"" if they were to win the title. ""Everyone is saying we were bad in the second half, but that is an exaggeration,"" an animated Favre told reporters on Thursday. ""We had three clear chances in the second half, and we only played badly in the last 10 minutes."" Title hopefuls Dortmund face Freiburg on Sunday, in the first of several potential banana skins between now and the end of the season. Freiburg are a notoriously hard team to visit, and have already had an impact on the title race by holding Bayern to a draw at home earlier this month. Dortmund's defence remains ravaged by injury ahead of Sunday's match. Full-backs Lukasz Piszczek and Achraf Hakimi are still sidelined, while Favre confirmed on Thursday that centre-back Dan-Axel Zagadou has picked up a knock to his knee. With rivals Bayern playing a day before, Dortmund will know before kick-off on Sunday whether they have the chance to regain top spot. The reigning champions host Werder Bremen on Saturday, just three days before meeting them again in the German Cup semi-final. Ahead of the Bremen double bill, coach Niko Kovac has warned his side not to get ahead of themselves. ""It is an unusual situation (to be facing the same team twice in a row), but we have to concentrate on the first game,"" he said. ""Bremen are a strong opponent who are in very good form."" Bremen are in good shape: they remain unbeaten in 2019, in a run stretching back 14 games in all competitions and are sniffing around the European places. Their recent record against the league leaders makes for sobering reading however. Bremen have not beaten Bayern in 11 years, and have lost all of their last 18 games against them. Eight of those defeats were by three goals or more. Yet coach Florian Kohfeldt believes his Bremen side have what it takes to break the Bayern curse. ""Bayern are the strongest team in Germany at the moment, but we also have our weapons and we can do them some damager,"" said Kohfeldt on Thursday. ""Our philosophy remains the same: we want to win wherever we go."" Bayern may be without both Mats Hummels and James Rodriguez. Hummels has been working to recover from a thigh strain, while Rodriguez picked up a muscle injury during Thursday's training session."

163,13/04/2019,20:50,Sancho and Buerki send Dortmund top with nerve-jangling win over Mainz,Jadon Sancho's first-half brace and Roman Buerki's goalkeeping heroics helped pile the pressure back onto Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga title race as Borussia Dortmund survived a late scare to secure a 2-1 win over Mainz on Saturday.,"Dortmund were left licking their wounds after a 5-0 humiliation in Munich last weekend saw them slip a point behind Bayern, but they showed both steel and style on Saturday to secure three points and go top of the table overnight. Two early goals from England international Sancho appeared to put Dortmund on course for an easy victory, but they were forced to weather a second-half onslaught from Mainz. ""We knew we needed to make a statement today. The first half was fine, but I can't explain why we stopped playing football in the second half,"" Dortmund captain Marco Reus told Sky. ""It is a question of mentality. We have a lot of young players, and we need to stay relaxed and keep having fun."" Reus, Sancho and co will now go to bed as league leaders, with Bayern needing a win at Fortuna Duesseldorf on Sunday to regain their grip on top spot. Dortmund took the lead with an inch-perfect move on 17 minutes. Mario Goetze's bending cross found Sancho, who didn't even break his stride as he thumped the ball past Florian Mueller from close range. Sancho doubled the lead shortly afterwards with the help of a deflection from Moussa Niakhate. Yet a familiar fragility crept into Dortmund's defending as the game wore on, and they were forced to rely on the determined brilliance of Buerki. The Dortmund keeper kept Mainz at bay for much of the second half, before Robin Quaison pulled a goal back for Mainz six minutes from time. Buerki then kept out the equaliser with an incredible triple save at a corner a few minutes later. ""It's nice to help your team win, but we played too fearfully after they scored,"" Buerki told Sky. Earlier on Saturday, a 1-0 win over crisis club Hanover kept Borussia Moenchengladbach in the race for Champions League football. Having dropped out of the top four earlier this month, Gladbach picked up only their second win in nine games against bottom-of-the-table Hanover. ""It was really important for us to finally win a game again today. It will do us a lot of good,"" said Gladbach midfielder Christoph Kramer. Brazilian striker Raffael grabbed the winner just after half-time, flicking a loose ball over the head of Hanover keeper Michael Esser. Gladbach now sit in fifth, a point behind Eintracht Frankfurt, who play Augsburg on Sunday. Elsewhere, RB Leipzig strengthened their grip on third with a comfortable win over Wolfsburg. Kevin Kampl curled in the opener on 16 minutes, before Timo Werner headed in a second to notch his third goal in four games. Defeat is a setback for Wolfsburg, whose fellow European hopefuls Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen both won on Saturday. Bremen snuck into a Europa League place thanks to a 2-1 win over Freiburg. Late headers from in-form Dutch midfielder Davy Klaassen and Theodor Gebre Selassie sealed the three points for the home side, despite Luca Waldschmidt's even later consolation goal for Freiburg. Leverkusen, meanwhile, battled to a 1-0 victory over relegation-threatened Stuttgart thanks to a Kai Havertz penalty. The win puts Leverkusen seventh, in the centre of a thrilling race for Europe. A single point separates Bremen in sixth from ninth-placed Hoffenheim, who play Hertha Berlin on Sunday."

""Our aim is to finish first, and we have nothing to fear,"" said Buerki on Thursday. The Dortmund keeper rubbished the idea that, after their humiliation at the hands of Bayern, Dortmund did not deserve to win the title. ""I don't give a damn what other people say. The team who are top at the end of the season will deserve to be there,"" he said. ""We need to remember that we are only a point behind,"" said Buerki on Thursday. ""We need to win every game and hope that Bayern slip up."" Buerki pointed out that Bayern have dropped points against weaker opposition this season, and said that there was still much to play for in the last six games of the season. ""Nobody expected Bayern to drop two points against Freiburg (both last month and in November), and that can happen against other teams,"" he said. ""It can happen to us, and it can also happen to Bayern."" However Dortmund do not just have their wounded pride to contend with ahead of the clash with Mainz. They also have a growing injury crisis. Veteran full-back Lukasz Piszceck has been ruled out with a foot injury, while Jadon Sancho, Dan-Axel Zagadou, Raphael Guerreiro and Christian Pulisic all missed team training on Thursday. Spanish striker Paco Alcacer, however, is set to return to action after missing out on the defeat to Bayern. Bayern coach Niko Kovac, meanwhile, might have expected some job security after masterminding the 5-0 win over Dortmund. Instead, he has been subjected to further speculation about his future. On Sunday, Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told Sky Sports that Kovac had ""no guarantee"" of staying in his job. Club president Uli Hoeness rebuked Rummenigge in an interview with kicker, saying that ""you can't work with someone if you constantly undermine them"". Yet Rummenigge is apparently not the only Kovac-sceptic at Bayern. On Thursday, ESPN reported that a ""senior player"" had moaned about Kovac's coaching style and compared him unfavourably to former Bayern boss Carlo Ancelotti, who was sacked after a player revolt. Kovac also had to deal with a training ground bust-up between Robert Lewandowski and Kingsley Coman on Thursday, but he has remained typically relaxed ahead of Sunday's game. He pointed to the fact that Bayern twice built six-match winning runs either side of Christmas. If they can do so again in the last six games of the season, they will be crowned champions, and Kovac intends to start against Duesseldorf on Sunday. ""Why shouldn't we have another run of victories?"" he was quoted as saying in kicker on Thursday. ""Against Dortmund, everything clicked: the mental, the physical and the tactical side of things."" ""If we play like that again on Sunday, then we will win."" Elsewhere, Schalke can pull further away from the relegation fight when they face fellow strugglers Nuremberg on Friday, while RB Leipzig look to cement their place in the top four with a win over Wolfsburg."

166,07/04/2019,14:45,'We still want to win the league' - Dortmund CEO,Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has said that his team are still hoping to win the Bundesliga title after their 5-0 humiliation at the hands of Bayern Munich on Saturday.,"Bayern reclaimed top spot with their emphatic victory on Saturday, but they remain only a point ahead of Dortmund with six games to go. ""Of course we want to win the league,"" said Watzke during a Sky Sports chat show appearance with his Bayern counterpart Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. ""In a few days, Bayern will notice that they only got three points for their win, and we will realise that we are only a point behind them."" Watzke admitted Dortmund were now underdogs, but insisted that his team could bounce back and keep the pressure on the Bavarians. ""Bayern are obviously favourites, but I don't think that both teams are going to win all of their last six games,"" he said. ""Our team has enormous potential, and it will be part of the learning curve to put this victory behind us."" ""The players need to enjoy playing again and have fun, because yesterday was not fun."" Watzke said that the fact that his team were still in the race at all at this stage was ""a great success"". ""This is only the third time in a decade that we have a title race in the Bundesliga,"" he said. ""If we have to congratulate Bayern on the last day of the season, then we will do so."" Bayern chief executive Rummenigge, meanwhile, said he was now confident that his team would claim a seventh successive Bundesliga title. ""We will win the league,"" he declared. ""We have big goals, and we are in a promising position in both domestic competitions, so our aim is to win the double,"" he said. ""There were definitely weeks which didn't go so well for us this season. In the last six games, we need to play as we did yesterday."""
167,06/04/2019,21:53,'Catastrophic': Dortmund inquest after Bayern 5-0 humiliation,"Borussia Dortmund captain Marco Reus said his team need to take a long, hard look at themselves after their ""catastrophic"" 5-0 defeat to Bundesliga title rivals Bayern Munich on Saturday.","""We played catastrophically and I don't have any explanation for it,"" Reus told Sky. ""We can't turn up and play like that, Bayern are not a joke team. We need to be ruthless when we analyse our performance."" Hapless defending and poor build-up play saw Dortmund humiliated in a remarkable first half, as Bayern outplayed them all over the pitch and reclaimed top spot in the Bundesliga. ""We didn't leave Dortmund any space to breathe,"" said Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Dortmund coach Lucien Favre said that his team had been ""taught a lesson"", and admitted that his decision to play Reus up front instead of Mario Goetze had backfired. Despite the thumping defeat, Dortmund are still just one point behind Bayern in the title race, and Favre said that his team must put a traumatic evening in Munich behind them. ""We have to concentrate on the next games. If we play like we did today, it will be hard to stay in the title race,"" he added. ""We have to play football instead of just saying that we want to win."" With six games to go, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski warned that there was still ""difficult path ahead"" if Bayern were to win a seventh consecutive league title. ""If we win all our games, then we will do it, but it will be difficult. We have to show on the pitch that we want to be champions,"" said Lewandowski who scored twice against his former club on Saturday, taking his Bundelsiga career total to 200. Bayern arguably have the harder run-in. They face a tough away trip to third-placed Leipzig before hosting fourth-placed Eintracht Frankfurt on the last day of the season. Yet coach Niko Kovac was optimistic, saying that his team had stuck it their critics with Saturday's performance. ""It makes me particularly happy because there was a lot of harsh criticism directed at my team,"" he said."
168,06/04/2019,21:15,Lewandowski scores 200th Bundesliga goal against old club Dortmund,Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski became only the fifth player in history to score 200 Bundesliga goals during Saturday's emphatic 5-0 win over his former club Borussia Dortmund.,"Lewandowski marked the milestone in style, chipping Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki and volleying into the open net to score Bayern's second goal of the evening and reach his own double century. He added another in the 89th minute, taking his tally to 201. ""I never thought I would score so many goals in the Bundesliga,"" the Polish striker told Sky. ""I still remember my first one very well."" Lewandowski's first Bundesliga goal came for Dortmund against Schalke back in 2010. His brace on Saturday means he is now the fifth most prolific player in German league history. He is just 19 goals off former Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes, who is third in the all-time list. ""I'm not too far away from Jupp's mark,"" he told Sky with a grin."
169,05/03/2019,23:42,'Job done' - Pochettino hails Tottenham's European progress,Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino congratulated his side for withstanding an early Borussia Dortmund bombardment to beat the Bundesliga leaders 1-0 on Tuesday and seal a 4-0 Champions League last-16 aggregate win.,"Harry Kane's goal early in the second half confirmed Spurs' place in the last eight for the first time in Pochettino's five-year reign, but only after series of Hugo Lloris saves before the break denied Dortmund a way back into the tie. ""It was fantastic. Job done, we are in the quarter-finals,"" said Pochettino. ""I think it is a very important victory tonight. In the first half we suffered a little, but football is about suffering together and we fully deserved to go to the quarter-finals. ""Hugo was great. We conceded more chances than we expected but that is football. This type of games when you beat them 3-0 in the first leg is very difficult. They have nothing to lose."" Kane's 14th goal in just 17 Champions League appearances also made him the club's all-time top scorer in European competition. After crashing out at the group stage two years ago and in the last 16 to Juventus last season, Kane is hopeful of going even deeper in the competition. ""It's always difficult in these type of games, you don't know whether to defend or attack. This man (Lloris) made some great saves and in the second half we took our chance like we needed,"" said the England captain. ""We've got to build on it, each year in the Champions League we've progressed and who knows this year. We will keep on building and keep on going till the end."""
170,05/03/2019,23:30,Kane fires Spurs into quarter-finals,Harry Kane fired Tottenham Hotspur into the Champions League quarter-finals as his winning goal at Borussia Dortmund in Tuesday's return leg sealed a 1-0 victory to wrap up a 4-0 aggregate success.,"On Monday, Spurs coach Mauricio Pochettino had demanded they ""finish the job"" after beating the Bundesliga leaders 3-0 in the first leg at Wembley. His Spurs side delivered, soaking up everything Dortmund threw at them in a one-sided first half before Kane's goal just after the break killed off the hosts' spirited challenge. ""It's always difficult in these type of games, you don't know whether to defend or attack,"" said Kane, who singled out Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris for praise after a string of key saves. ""They had a few moments. In that first half we needed everyone, defenders blocking it, Hugo saving it, that's what Champions League is about - you need everybody."" This is the first time Tottenham are in the last eight of the Champions League since 2010/11 when they bowed out 5-0 on aggregate to Real Madrid. Needing to score at least three goals, Dortmund packed their line-up with forwards as Mario Goetze, Marco Reus and Paco Alcacer - who have scored 30 goals between them - all started together for the first time this season. Dortmund flew out of the traps, pounding the Spurs defence with 10 attempts in the first half alone, restricting the Londoners to a single Son Heung-min effort, and enjoying 70 percent possession. ""We have showed that we have the quality, we can build on the first-half performance, but we need to score goals,"" said Dortmund captain Reus. The Germans harassed Spurs at every opportunity and had two clear chances in the opening 25 minutes as Alcacer fired just over, while Lloris snaffled a stinging Reus shot at the second attempt. Tottenham's first real chance came with half an hour gone when Son got in behind his marker Marius Wolf and fired wide with the goal at his mercy. Lloris then pulled off two saves at point-blank range before palming Goetze's shot over the bar shortly before the break. Having defended doggedly, Spurs took the lead when Kane scored with his first chance and only his team's second of the game. His run split the hosts' centre-backs, as he latched onto Moussa Sissoko's pass and curled his shot past Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki. The video assistant referee confirmed Kane was on-side and his goal on 49 minutes subdued the crowd at Signal Iduna Park who had hoped for a miracle. With the tempo having dropped, Spurs' Pochettino brought on Eric Dier, back from injury, to beef up the midfield in place of Harry Winks for the final 35 minutes. Spurs seemed content to absorb Dortmund's attacks while countering on the few opportunities they had. In a bid to boost flagging confidence, Dortmund head coach Lucien Favre brought on Chelsea-bound Christian Pulisic and Danish forward Jacob Bruun Larsen for the final half an hour. With Reus tiring, unsurprisingly after four weeks out with a thigh injury, Thomas Delaney came on for the Dortmund skipper with 17 minutes left. Sissoko attempted to win a late penalty and Kane put the ball into Dortmund's net but was flagged for offside as the game petered out and home fans started slipping away. While Spurs go marching into the last eight, Dortmund can focus on trying to prevent Bayern Munich winning a seventh straight Bundesliga title with just goal difference currently separating the sides."
171,04/03/2019,20:33,'It's impossible' - Spurs boss fumes over Dortmund's 'unfair' advantage,Mauricio Pochettino has appealed to the FA and Premier League to help English clubs in the Champions League after complaining about Tottenham Hotspur's limited recuperation time before facing Borussia Dortmund.,"Spurs play Dortmund away in Germany on Tuesday in their last 16, return leg after thumping the Germans 3-0 in the first leg at Wembley. However, Pochettino, 47, is far from happy with having a day less to prepare for the last 16 tie at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park. Spurs had a bruising 1-1 draw at home to Arsenal in Saturday's North London derby, while Dortmund lost 2-1 at Augsburg on Friday night in the Bundesliga. ""They played Friday, we played Saturday,"" said Spurs coach Pochettino. ""It's not fair to play with a massive disadvantage. ""We need help from the FA and the Premier League - for us it's impossible. ""We played (a Premier League game) on a Sunday before the first leg, which was on a Wednesday, when Dortmund played Saturday. ""Now we played Saturday, Dortmund played Friday. ""I don't know if the FA or the Premier League are to blame or television, who wanted us to play live Saturday or Sunday."" Pochettino pointed to the example of Stade Rennes, who postponed a French league game at the weekend to prepare for Thursday's Europa League, last 16 tie at home to Arsenal. ""Looked what happened to Rennes, they had a game cancelled the weekend game to held prepare to play Arsenal,"" said Pochettino. ""In Europe, the people are more sensitive to helping their clubs prepare for Europe, that's my point. ""I want us to have the same amount preparation time as our opponents. ""We need to change it in the future to help English clubs be stronger in the competition."" Spurs last reached the Champions League's quarter-finals in 2011 - losing 4-0 at Real Madrid and beaten 1-0 at home - and Pochettino knows this is a golden chance for Spurs. Harry Kane is expected to lead Spurs' attack while Pochettino said Harry Winks and Eric Dier could feature after injuries. The Argentinian repeatedly said Spurs must 'forget' their heavy first-leg win at Wembley and finish the job by seeing off a Dortmund team who have one win in seven games. Son Heung-min and Kane scored at Dortmund when Spurs won 2-1 in the group stages in 2017/18 and Pochettino wants another convincing away win. ""It's a great opportunity to go to the next round, but we need a good performance - it's going to difficult,"" said Pochettino. ""The 3-0 at Wembley is not important. ""We need to forget the first leg, be very professional and win the game. ""We need to start at a very good level, be aggressive, fight from the beginning, high tempo. ""We know Dortmund are a good team, they deserve to be there and they are going to start aggressive and try to push us deeper - we need to be just as aggressive."""
172,04/03/2019,14:39,Reus urges Dortmund to write history against Spurs,Marco Reus has called on Borussia Dortmund to write history on Tuesday as the Bundesliga leaders attempt to turn around their Champions League tie at home to Tottenham Hotspur.,"After losing 3-0 to Spurs at Wembley in the first leg of the last 16, Dortmund face a monumental task against Mauricio Pochettino's team at Signal Iduna Park in the return fixture. Only three clubs, Barcelona, Roma and Deportivo La Coruna, have ever managed to progress in the Champions League knock-out phases after losing the first leg by three goals or more. ""I think there have already been some games in the stadium where history has been written - we can do it,"" said Reus, Dortmund's top-scorer and captain who missed the first leg with injury. ""But we need a top performance and have to score at the right moment."" Dortmund will be at near full strength, with only wing-back Lukasz Piszczek sidelined by injury Spurs were the last team to win a Champions League game at Dortmund, in November 2017, when Son Heung-min and Harry Kane scored in a 2-1 group stage victory. After Reus' defiant words, Dortmund head coach Lucien Favre offered a more modest perspective. ""We know that it's going to be difficult, but you never know,"" said Favre. Signal Iduna Park has seen some big nights in Europe, most recently when Atletico Madrid were routed 4-0 in the group stage last October. And no Borussia fan could forget Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, now at Bayern Munich, scoring all of Dortmund's goals when Real Madrid were routed 4-1 in the semi-finals in 2013. However, the home side must bounce back from a dreadful run of results to have any chance of overhauling Spurs. Having crashed to a shock 2-1 defeat at strugglers Augsburg in the Bundesliga on Friday, Dortmund have just one win in seven games. After four weeks out with a thigh injury, Reus says he is ready, and could even play the full 120 minutes if they force extra time. ""I feel good, it was clear I wouldn't play the 90 minutes against Augsburg,"" said Reus, who managed 66 minutes in Friday's defeat. ""But we'll see how tomorrow goes, I am ready - ready to go for the 120 minutes."" Having been nine points ahead of Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga in December, Dortmund's lead has eroded and Bayern drew level on 54 points at the weekend. Dortmund only top the table on goal difference, but a win over Spurs -- regardless of whether the Germans progress -- would be a huge boost to confidence. ""We are very dissatisfied with the current results,"" said Reus. ""We have to show more of our mentality and then we'll get out (of the current low) again."""
173,01/03/2019,22:41,Ji for two as Dortmund crash at Augsburg,South Korea striker Ji Dong-won netted twice against his former club Borussia Dortmund as the league leaders suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at Augsburg on Friday to stumble again in the Bundesliga title race.,"Defending champions Bayern Munich, who are second, will draw level with Dortmund on 54 points if they win at third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday. The result is a blow for Dortmund as they try to overturn a 3-0 defeat on Tuesday when they host Tottenham Hotspur in the return leg of their Champions League last 16 tie. Dortmund now have just one win in their last seven matches in all competitions. They have also dropped nine points in their last five league games. Both Augsburg goals were a result of mistakes by inexperienced Dortmund defenders Dan-Axel Zagadou, 19, and Achraf Hakimi, 20. Having also scored against Bayern a fortnight ago, Ji gave Augsburg the first-half lead, then hit a superb second to chip inside the post home 22 minutes from time. Paco Alcacer scored Dortmund's consolation goal nine minutes from time, but victory left Augsburg now five points clear of the relegation battle in 15th place. This was only Dortmund's second league defeat this season, but is another significant set-back after being held to a goalless draw at bottom side Nuremberg ten days ago. Once again, Dortmund struggled against relegation-threatened opposition as Augsburg gave the perfect response after three straight defeats and last weekend's 5-1 thrashing by Freiburg. Dortmund's top-scorer and playmaker Marco Reus returned after four weeks out with a thigh injury. Augsburg were forced into an early substitution when defender Konstantinos Stafylidis limped off injured after just 17 minutes. Just as they did a fortnight ago, when mighty Bayern Munich had to twice come from behind to win 3-2 at the WWK Arena, Augsburg took a surprise early lead. When Andre Hahn fired in a cross, Zagadou slipped and despite the best efforts of three Dortmund defenders, Ji curled home his shot for the opening goal on 24 minutes. At the other end, defensive midfielder Thomas Delaney shot over the bar and centre-back Manuel Akanji headed wide. Then Dortmund midfielder Jacob Bruun Larson fired direct at Augsburg goalkeeper Gregor Kobel at point-blank range as the hosts went into the break 1-0 up. Heavy rain blighted the second-half, but Ji showed lightning reactions for his second goal. When Hakimi put in a lazy pass, Ji pounced and sprinted clear before chipping the ball inside the far post to delight the home crowd. The 27-year-old has now scored four goals in seven games against his old Dortmund. With Reus off, his replacement Alcacer gave Dortmund hope on 81 minutes when he tapped home Mario Goetze's final pass, but it was too little, too late."
174,28/02/2019,01:24,Dortmund eager to learn from Bayern slip-up at Augsburg,Lucien Favre says his Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund must learn from Bayern Munich's stumble against Friday's opponents Augsburg to stay ahead in the tense title race.,"With just under a third of the season left, recent poor results have slashed Dortmund's lead from nine to just three points before Friday's trip south to Augsburg, where Bayern came perilously close to a shock defeat a fortnight ago. The defending champions leaked two goals from crosses, including a weak own-goal by Leon Goretzka 13 seconds into the Bavarian derby, and needed two Kingsley Coman goals to draw level before David Alaba scored the winner in a 3-2 victory. Dortmund had their own close shave at home to Augsburg last October in a seven-goal thriller after replacement Paco Alcacer claimed a hat-trick by drilling home a stunning 96th-minute free-kick to seal a dramatic 4-3 win. Augsburg sit just above the relegation places, but their winger Philipp Max still found lots of space on the flanks against Bayern and Favre, Dortmund's head coach, expects a few more surprises from Manuel Baum's side. ""Augsburg played very well the last time we faced them, they change their tactics regularly,"" said Favre on Wednesday. ""Against Bayern, they played some high risk football and caused a few problems. Augsburg have a lot of goal chances in every game."" This will be Dortmund's final chance to tune up before next Tuesday's all-or-nothing Champions League clash at home to Tottenham Hotspur with the Germans needing to overturn a 3-0 deficit after being thumped in the last 16, first leg tie at Wembley. Dortmund hope to welcome back Marco Reus, their captain and chief goal-scorer, at Augsburg after missing nearly four weeks with a thigh strain, during which his side went five games without a win, but Lukasz Piszczek is out with a foot injury. Last Sunday's 3-2 victory at Bayer Leverkusen, when stand-in skipper Mario Goetze and England winger Jadon Sancho supplied key goals, ended Dortmund's slump. ""It was important to win again,"" explained the Swiss coach. ""Leverkusen played very well, but we're always learning and everyone was a part of that."" On Saturday, Bayern, who have won ten of their last 11 league games, have a tricky away trip to faltering Borussia Moenchengladbach, who inflicted a stunning 3-0 defeat on the Bavarian giants at the Allianz Arena when the sides met in October. Dieter Hecking's Gladbach sit third, but stumbled in recent weeks by crashing to 3-0 defeats against Hertha Berlin and Wolfsburg either side of a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt. Bayern hope to have a host of stars fit after missing the start of the week with illness. Both goalkeepers Manuel Neuer and Sven Ulreich were absent on Monday with flu while forwards Franck Ribery and Robert Lewandowski sat out Tuesday's session with upset stomachs.

They also need a win at Augsburg on Friday in the Bundesliga title race as they only hold a three-point lead over defending champions Bayern Munich. ""He will probably be involved, but we have to wait and then ask the doctor,"" Dortmund head coach Lucien Favre said on Wednesday. ""He's back in team training, today (Wednesday) was his second session, but whether he will be back in the (matchday) squad, I can't yet say."" Reus, who has scored 13 goals in 19 league games this season, has been sidelined for nearly four weeks by a thigh injury. During his absence, Dortmund failed to win in three games, only breaking the run with a 3-2 victory against Bayer Leverkusen last Sunday when England winger Jadon Sancho starred. Dortmund will be without wing back Lukasz Piszczek, who has a foot problem, at Augsburg, but US midfielder Christian Pulisic is expected to be fit again after recovering from a leg injury. Favre says he is grateful for a three-day break before Dortmund take on Spurs. ""The schedule is OK, the three days in between are of course important, but we are just concentrating on the next game,"" said the Swiss. Dortmund will have learnt from Bayern's experience after Niko Kovac's star-studded side came from behind twice to seal a 3-2 win at Augsburg -- also on a Friday -- a fortnight ago. Favre also said that Spanish striker Paco Alcacer could feature again after making his comeback from a shoulder injury at Leverkusen. Bayern are at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday looking to avenge a shock 3-0 defeat at Munich's Allianz Arena when the sides met last October, but Favre insists his side will only worry about themselves. ""We want to stay true to our philosophy, one game at a time -- full concentration on the next game - that's the most important match,"" added Favre."
176,25/02/2019,12:11,Dortmund's Reus returns to training after injury,Borussia Dortmund captain Marco Reus returned to training with the Bundesliga leaders on Monday after a three-week absence with a thigh injury.,"The 29-year-old is expected to be back in action for Dortmund's game against Augsburg on Friday. Coach Lucien Favre will be delighted to have his team's leading goalscorer back for the return leg of the Champions League last-16 tie against Tottenham on March 5, although Dortmund need to overturn a 3-0 first-leg deficit to progress. Reus, who has scored 17 goals in all competitions this season, was badly missed by Dortmund as they endured a five-match winless run. But they returned to winning ways on Sunday as Jadon Sancho scored in a 3-2 victory over Bayer Leverkusen which sent them three points clear of defending champions Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga."
177,24/02/2019,20:53,Dortmund withstand late Leverkusen fightback to go three points clear,Jadon Sancho scored as Borussia Dortmund beat a spirited Bayer Leverkusen 3-2 at Signal Iduna Park on Sunday to restore their three-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga table.,"The home side endured a nervous end to the game but held out for a huge win after three straight league draws. ""It's a really good feeling to be back in top spot,"" said Dortmund defender Manuel Akanji. ""It wasn't an easy game, but we did it well. It shows that we've got our self-confidence back."" Leverkusen started the game on fire, highlighting why they have been the Bundesliga's form team since the winter break. A goal for the visitors looked inevitable until Dortmund's French defender Dan-Axel Zagadou opened the scoring against the run of play in the 30th minute. A shell-shocked Bayer managed to hit back just seven minutes later, with Kevin Volland shooting through the legs of Dortmund midfielder Axel Witsel with a low shot from the edge of the penalty box. Their respite was minimal however, with Dortmund retaking the lead just over a minute later through teenage sensation Sancho. The England international met a lofted cross from Abdou Diallo with a well-struck volley. The goal woke Dortmund -- and their home crowd -- from their slumber, with the league leaders seemingly finding the form that had seen them open up a six-point lead at the top going into the winter break. They peppered the Leverkusen goal before and after the break, with Mario Goetze making the most of a Leverkusen defensive error on the hour mark to put the home side 3-1 ahead with his fourth goal of the campaign. Dortmund continued to attack but failed to tighten up at the back, learning little from their recent 3-3 draws against Hoffenheim and Werder Bremen. Leverkusen hit back as Jonathan Tah headed home a Julian Brandt free-kick in the 75th minute, setting up a tense final stanza. The home side held firm to grab the three points but serious defensive questions remain for coach Lucien Favre's side, who have now conceded 11 goals in their past five games in all competitions. Earlier in the day, Eintracht Frankfurt's attack was on song as the visitors ran out 3-0 victors over a struggling Hanover 96 at the HDI Arena. Luka Jovic scored his 15th goal of the season while Ante Rebic added his eighth of the campaign to lift Frankfurt up to sixth on the table. Frankfurt now sit in the Europa League places and are well in the hunt for a Champions League berth. Serbian Jovic is now two goals clear of Bayern's Robert Lewandowski and Dortmund's Marco Reus at the top of the goalscoring charts."
178,18/02/2019,22:45,Dortmund drop more points at bottom side Nuremberg,Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund dropped more points in the title race on Monday when they were held to a goalless draw at bottom side Nuremberg.,"Dortmund are now just three points ahead of second-placed Bayern Munich, the defending champions who won 3-2 at Augsburg on Friday, with their lead slashed from nine points after drawing their last three league games. ""That was definitely too little from us, we have to pick up points again,"" said forward Mario Goetze. ""They didn't make it easy for us by standing deep, but we must improve."" Even without injured playmaker Marco Reus, plus defenders Lukasz Piszczek and Manuel Akanji, this was another below-par display from the league leaders. Nuremberg were hammered 7-0 at Dortmund last September, but this was a vastly improved display from the hosts and the draw was celebrated like a win on the home bench. It was their first game under caretaker coaches Marek Mintal and Boris Schommers after both head coach Michael Knoeller and director of sport Andreas Borneman were sacked last week. The hosts deserve tremendous credit for battling as their captain Hanno Behrens twice went close to giving his side a shock lead, but his first-half headers went over. Nuremberg's goalkeeper Christian Mathenia, who made four saves in the first half from Goetze alone, repeatedly thwarted the visitors' attack, but Nuremberg's winless streak in the league has now been stretched out to 16 games. ""No one gave us a chance going into this game which makes me even prouder that we picked up a point,"" said Mathenia. Having crashed 3-0 at Tottenham Hotspur last week in the Champions League last 16, first-leg, Lucien Favre's Dortmund again failed to score and are now winless in their last five games in all competitions. The first-half was twice halted to clear black tennis balls, thrown onto the pitch by fans in protest over the unpopular Monday night kick-off times in the Bundesliga which will be abolished for the 2021/22 season."
179,16/02/2019,19:58,Favre urges Dortmund to bounce back at bottom side Nuremberg,Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre is urging the injury-hit Bundesliga leaders to quickly recover from their Champions League mauling at Tottenham Hotspur with another big win over bottom side Nuremberg on Monday.,"Nuremberg were thrashed 7-0 at Signal Iduna Park when the sides last met in September and Dortmund could do with another thumping win to restore flagging confidence. Dortmund are winless in their last four games in all competitions after going down 3-0 at Wembley against Spurs on Wednesday, leaving them with a mountain to climb in their Champions League last 16, return leg at home on March 5. Favre is desperate for his team to rediscover some form to restore their five-point lead over second-placed Bayern Munich, who beat Augsburg 3-2 on Friday. ""We need to keep playing the way we have done, but with more patience,"" said Favre on Saturday. ""We're getting goal chances, we're creating them well, but we need to stop conceding. ""We have to correct that."" Dortmund will be missing several key players on Monday with Marco Reus, who missed the Spurs defeat, still sidelined along with defenders Lukasz Piszczek and Manuel Akanji. However, striker Paco Alcacer and defender Julian Weigl should be back. Director of sport Michael Zorc insists Bayern's win at Augsburg, which has pegged Dortmund's lead back to just two points, ""plays no role for us"". The league leaders, who conceded three late goals last Saturday in a 3-3 home draw with Hoffenheim, need to put their week to forget behind them. ""We also made mistakes in the first half of the season - it's just now we are being punished for each one,"" said Zorc. ""We aren't getting much luck at the moment, but we won't be changing everything around. ""The senses have been sharpened, we will do everything to get back to winning ways."" This will be Nuremberg's first game since sacking both sports director Andreas Bornemann and head coach Michael Koellner on Tuesday following a run of 15 league games without a win. Caretaker coaches Marek Mintal and Boris Schommers will be on the Nuremberg bench."
180,15/02/2019,13:47,Star barber's Wembley visit doesn't cut it for Dortmund chiefs,A group of Borussia Dortmund stars have been slammed in the media and criticised by club bosses after inviting a celebrity barber to the team hotel on the eve of their Champions League mauling by Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley.,"Bundesliga leaders Dortmund face a mountain to climb in the return on March 5 after an error-strewn second-half display saw them lose 3-0 to Tottenham in the last 16, first leg in London on Wednesday. In the wake of the defeat, stars Axel Witsel, Raphael Guerreiro, Dan-Axel Zagadou, Abdou Diallo and Jacob Bruun Larsen have been sharply criticised for inviting celebrity barber, London-based Sheldon Edwards, to the team hotel in Wembley to cut their hair. Edwards has flown to Dortmund in the past to cut the squad's hair and the Londoner has also given a trim to athletics legend Usain Bolt, plus several Premier League stars such as Manchester City trio Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Jesus and Benjamin Mendy. ""Today we have another generation of players who are preparing (for matches) differently from how I did,"" said sporting director Michael Zorc, who made more than 500 appearances for Dortmund as a midfielder and played for Germany in the 1990s. ""That said, it shouldn't have happened and it won't happen again."" According to reports, the club was not aware of the barber's visit to the team hotel so close to an important match. ""These millionaire footballers should have their heads washed by the club bosses,"" fumed Germany's top-selling daily Bild. ""Such aloof behaviour puts their fans off as much as a defeat on the pitch."" Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke played down the mini scandal, but admitted the club will speak to the players involved. ""Of course, a haircut has no effect on the performance of the team,"" said Watzke. ""The reasons for the defeat lay in the sporting arena and we have to analyse them directly. ""The fact that the defeat leads to a visit from a hairdresser being viewed more critically by the media is clear. ""That's why Michael Zorc and Sebastian Kehl (team manager) will be working on the topic with the appropriate players."" The squad's professionalism was criticised in the German media before the team even flew from Dortmund after their plane was delayed because Jadon Sancho and Diallo forgot their passports and Omer Toprak lost his boarding pass. As Bild points out, Dortmund's barber scandal is the latest in a line of recent ill-advised indiscretions involving wealthy Bundesliga footballers. After Germany crashed out of the 2018 World Cup in the group phase, it emerged the internet had to be switched off at the team hotel at nights to prevent the squad playing computer games into the small hours. Last month, Bayern Munich star Franck Ribery was ""heavily fined"" by the defending Bundesliga champions for a foul-mouthed response to critics after he posted a picture on social media eating a gold-plated steak."
181,14/02/2019,13:12,Leaking leaders Dortmund must improve after Wembley battering,Borussia Dortmund are in danger of losing the Bundesliga title race and crashing out of Europe with goalkeeper Roman Burki demanding improvements in defence after their Champions League battering at Wembley.,"""I don't think we are defending at the moment with all our might,"" fumed Dortmund keeper Burki. ""It's always the same situations, crosses, corners or free-kicks, where we are just not ready to knock the ball away."" For the third game in a row, Dortmund leaked three goals in Wednesday's 3-0 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League last 16, first leg tie leaving Mauricio Pochettino's Londoners with one foot in the quarter-finals. ""Dortmund's first crisis: more than just a dent,"" wrote German magazine Kicker. Dortmund had no answers as Spurs' South Korea striker Son Heung-min slipped his marker to volley home immediately after the break as the Germans lost possession in their own half. ""A goal a minute after the start of the second half is a gift,"" said Dortmund coach Lucien Favre. ""We should not have even tried to play the ball there, because the opponent was already starting to press."" In a catastrophic final ten minutes, Spurs took full advantage of more sloppy Dortmund defending by scoring twice. As Germany's top-selling daily Bild put it, ""Tottenham sank Dortmund. The quarter-finals are almost gone after the first leg"" while magazine Spiegel opted for ""Thrown off track with force"". Burly Belgian defender Jan Vertonghen swept in Spurs' second goal when he got in behind Dortmund's defence to tap home. Spurs' replacement striker Fernando Llorente then left Dortmund with a mountain to climb in the return at Signal Iduna Park on March 5 by heading home untroubled from a corner. Without injured playmaker Marco Reus organising their game, Dortmund are especially fallible late on from set-pieces. The Wembley rout had echoes of last week's 3-3 draw after extra time at home to Werder Bremen which saw Dortmund dumped out of the German Cup after losing on penalties. Worse followed last Saturday where Jadon Sancho hit the post with the hosts 3-0 up on 70 minutes only for Hoffenheim to fight back for a 3-3 draw in the league. ""We have been conceding goals from standard situations for weeks now,"" said Burki. ""We are just not holding out and have to defend more rigorously. It starts in training. ""We must improve."" Dortmund hold a five-point lead in the Bundesliga, but with defending champions Bayern Munich snapping at their heels, the next few weeks are crucial to their hopes of a first league title since 2012. They face bottom side Nuremberg next away on Monday, but Dortmund's match against Bayern in Munich on April 6 has all the ingredients of a title showdown. ""Whenever we meet a robust team, we have difficulties because we don't stand up to them - we have to improve that,"" moaned Burki."
182,13/02/2019,23:16,Four things we learned from Spurs vs BVB,"No Harry Kane, no Dele Alli, and still no problem for Tottenham Hotspur as three second-half goals handed them a commanding 3-0 Champions League last 16, first-leg lead over Borussia Dortmund.","Son Heung-min again led the way in Kane's absence by opening the scoring before Jan Vertonghen and Fernando Llorente also struck in the final seven minutes to put Mauricio Pochettino's men on the brink of reaching the last eight. Here, AFP Sport looks at four things we learned from a famous night for the hosts at Wembley: Kane and Alli's injuries coincided with Son's departure to the Asian Cup. In two games without all three, Tottenham's bids for domestic cup success ended for another year in defeats against Chelsea and Crystal Palace. Since Son's return, the South Korean has scored in all four games to maintain an unlikely title challenge with Premier League victories over Watford, Newcastle United and Leicester City, and now help his side claim a priceless first-leg lead. Despite the accumulated fatigue of representing his country in three international tournaments in the past eight months, Son's energy levels -- compared to a battery recently by Pochettino -- show no signs of running low. He now has 11 goals in as many games for his club. Spurs' Champions League campaign looked all but over after just three games of the group stage following defeats against Inter Milan and Barcelona and a 2-2 draw away at PSV Eindhoven. High-profile mistakes from Hugo Lloris cost his side dear, particularly for the opening goal in Barca's 4-2 win at Wembley and when the French captain was sent off for a rash challenge with Spurs leading 2-1 in Eindhoven. As the heavy legs of Pochettino's men struggled to get going before half-time, though, Lloris stood tall to bravely block Christian Pulisic's powerful effort from a narrow angle and then get an outstretched arm to Dan-Axel Zagadou's header just before the break. Those saves proved vital as Spurs took control in the second period and kept a clean sheet to put them in pole position to reach the last eight. The rising star of English football was playing for the Germans at Wembley as Jadon Sancho returned to his native London with a burgeoning reputation built on a fantastic season for the Bundesliga leaders. Sancho showed flashes of his lightning speed and trickery before the break, but Dortmund failed to make the most of their first-half supremacy without the injured Marco Reus and Paco Alcacer. Dortmund's two top scorers have combined for 30 goals this season and may be back to provide their firepower for the second leg on March 5, but the mountain already looks too big to climb for Lucien Favre's men. Tottenham were not just devoid of some of their most potent attacking threats, but both left-backs Ben Davies and Danny Rose due to injury. Pochettino tinkered to switch to a back three with centre-back Vertonghen forced to cope with the pace of Sancho as a left wing-back. But the Belgian turned the tie Spurs' way going forward with a brilliant cross for Son to volley home the opener and then got just his second goal of the season by ghosting in at the back post to meet Serge Aurier's cross perfectly and make it 2-0."
183,13/02/2019,23:08,Son shines as Spurs power surge rocks Dortmund,Tottenham took a huge step towards reaching the Champions League quarter-finals as Son Heung-min inspired their 3-0 win over Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 first leg on Wednesday.,"Mauricio Pochettino's side had been under the cosh as Dortmund dominated the first half at Wembley, but Hugo Lloris kept them level with a series of fine saves. That set the stage for a sublime second half from Tottenham, who were sparked into life by a fine finish from South Korea forward Son. Son's fourth goal in his last four appearances took him to 16 for the season, but none have been as priceless as this one. Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen capped his own powerful performance when he swept in their second goal in the closing stages and substitute Fernando Llorente's late third put the seal on a remarkable result. Although Tottenham still have to survive the second leg at Signal Iduna Park on March 5, they have a golden opportunity to reach the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since 2011. It was an especially impressive success for Pochettino given he was without the injured Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Danny Rose and Ben Davies. Pochettino devised a clever game-plan that eventually frustrated Dortmund and secured Tottenham's first ever Champions League knockout-round win at home. With Rose and Davies sidelined, Pochettino deployed centre-back Vertonghen out of position at left wing-back and switched to a three-man defence that stifled the Bundesliga leaders. Pochettino had insisted Tottenham would be able to ignore the draining effects of a gruelling schedule which he felt left them at a ""massive disadvantage"". And his passionate talk of seeing the ""energy"" in his players' eyes as they looked forward to a big Champions League night proved prescient as they worked tirelessly to leave Dortmund helpless to stem the tide. Lucas Moura gave Tottenham an early spark when he latched onto Davinson Sanchez's header and smashed a volley just wide from the edge of the area. Juan Foyth gifted Dortmund their first sight of goal when he dwelt on the ball too long and was alertly dispossessed by Christian Pulisic. But Lloris spared Foyth's blushes as he blocked Pulisic's shot at the near post. Dortmund's rapier attacks were led by Jadon Sancho, who left Manchester City to join Dortmund in 2017 without ever playing for the Premier League team. Just two years later, the 18-year-old winger made his first appearance back on home soil now established as an England international rated as one of Europe's hottest prospects. Sancho hit top gear on several occasions in a mesmerising first-half display, leaving two Tottenham midfielders for dead and linking with Pulisic, whose shot was blocked at the last minute. It took Tottenham over half an hour before they finally forced 'keeper Roman Burki into action after Son wriggled through the visitors' defence. Lloris made a superb save to deny Dortmund on the stroke of half-time as Dan-Axel Zagadou met Sancho's cross with a header that the Tottenham captain clawed out at full stretch. Despite being pushed back for much of the first half, Tottenham had refused to surrender and their perseverance was rewarded in the 47th minute. When Vertonghen swung over a cross from the left, Dortmund's defence were out of position for the first time all night and Son timed his run perfectly behind Zagadou to caress a fine volley past Burki. Suddenly, Tottenham had all the momentum and Vertonghen rampaged forward to fire over. Dortmund had no answers to Tottenham's high-tempo pressing and it was Vertonghen who was the hosts' unlikely hero in the 83rd minute as he volleyed home from Serge Aurier's cross. Tottenham were rampant and Llorente completed a memorable night when he glanced a close-range header past Burki from Christian Eriksen's corner three minutes later."
184,12/02/2019,16:11,Sancho's rise no surprise to Spurs boss Pochettino,"Jadon Sancho's sparkling displays for Borussia Dortmund are not a surprise to Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino, who has had him marked down as a ""massive prospect"" for the past few years.","The 18-year-old winger's form for the German league leaders has earned him England caps and he will be a danger man against Spurs when the two sides meet in their Champions League last-16 first leg at Wembley on Wednesday. Pochettino told the eve-of-match press conference that Sancho had been on his radar for a while before he started making headlines. ""He doesn't surprise me,"" said Pochettino. ""We knew very well that he was capable of doing what he's doing now, with game time. ""We were talking in the last few years that he was a massive prospect."" Sancho, whose trip home did not get off to the best of starts as he forgot his passport, is not Pochettino's main concern for the game. The 46-year-old will be without England stars Harry Kane and Dele Alli, who despite good progress following ankle and hamstring injuries, did not train on Tuesday. Also a non-starter is left-back Danny Rose, who suffered a shin injury during Sunday's win over Leicester City. ""It's impossible for him (Rose) to start from the beginning, we need to assess in the morning (Wednesday) whether he will be on the bench,"" said Pochettino. He will, though, have both England midfielder Eric Dier and Argentine striker Erik Lamela in contention for places."
185,12/02/2019,12:53,Missing Reus a blow for injury-hit Dortmund against Spurs - Matthaeus,"With top-scorer and chief playmaker Marco Reus out injured Borussia Dortmund will face Tottenham Hotspur without their best player, says Germany legend Lothar Matthaeus, ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash.","Reus has scored 17 goals and created 11 more for the Bundesliga leaders this season, but is absent for the last 16, first leg against Spurs at Wembley with a thigh strain. ""Now he's also going to be missing for the important game against Tottenham - that won't make it any easier,"" said former Germany captain Matthaeus, now a Sky pundit. ""The third-best team in the Premier League against the best in the Bundesliga - I see the chances as 50/50. ""In Marco Reus, Dortmund are missing their best player."" However, it is not just Reus who will be missing against Spurs. Right-back Lukasz Piszczek is out with a heel injury, stand-in centre-back Julian Weigl has flu and striker Paco Alcacer is sidelined by a shoulder injury. Reus injured his thigh last Tuesday while drilling home a direct free-kick against Werder Bremen, but Dortmund lost on penalties as the German Cup tie finished 3-3 after extra time. Spurs are also without big names of their own as England forwards Harry Kane and Delle Alli are injured. Matthaeus says Dortmund's 3-3 draw at home to Hoffenheim on Saturday showed how much they miss Reus' influence and organisation. In his absence, Jadon Sancho, 18, already a full England international, has taken over playmaking duties and was outstanding in scoring a goal, setting up two more and hitting the post against Hoffenheim before Dortmund leaked three late goals. ""He (Reus) is the one who instills respect until the very end and has a controlling hand on the whole Dortmund game,"" added Matthaeus. ""They have also won games without him and were 3-0 ahead on Saturday."" Matthaeus says Saturday's draw will have given hope to defending champions Bayern Munich, who closed the gap in the Bundesliga table to five points behind Dortmund with a 3-1 home win against Schalke on Saturday. ""The points Dortmund lost will have given Bayern a push, they'd have been inspired."""
186,12/02/2019,03:01,Dortmund's English teen Sancho relishing homecoming,Jadon Sancho has been bombarded by ticket requests from family and friends for his London return on Wednesday when Borussia Dortmund face Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley in the Champions League.,"The 18-year-old England winger says he has requested ""about 30 tickets"" from his German club for the plum last 16, first leg tie in his home city. ""Everyone was messaging me saying, 'I need a ticket! It's big. I'll be playing in front of my family, which is something I've always wanted to do since I was a young boy. ""It's Wembley. I can't wait."" As he has done all season, Sancho shone on Saturday, scoring the opening goal and setting up his side's other two in a 3-3 draw for the Bundesliga leaders at home to Hoffenheim. The match against Spurs on Wembley's hallowed turf is a homecoming for Sancho, one of the stars of an impressive Dortmund team seeking to dethrone Bayern Munich this season. Ahead of the match, he has been exchanging banter with Spurs' 23-year-old midfielder Harry Winks. ""I'm good friends with Harry. Obviously he feels they're going to win. We feel we're going to win,"" said Sancho with a smile. Sancho learned his trade on the streets of Kennington in south London. ""I think it's how we were brought up from the start - it's street football,"" he said. ""Everyone just expresses themselves, you fear no one because you have nothing to lose and you are just being yourself."" Sancho joined Watford's youth set-up aged seven, but left home aged just 11 to board at the club's Harefield Academy when travelling across London became an issue. His performances attracted Premier League giants Manchester City in March 2015. He caught the eye of City manager Pep Guardiola with 12 goals, creating four more, in 14 games for City's Under-18 Premier League team in 2016/17. However, Sancho was dropped from the senior squad in July 2017 after refusing to sign a new contract due to a lack of assurances over playing time. Dortmund stepped in and Sancho signed a five-year deal. He is clear about why he joined the Bundesliga giants. ""It was about the youngsters here getting opportunities,"" he added after starting 14 of 21 league games this season. ""I couldn't thank them more."" He admits struggling to learn German and being so far from home can be tough. ""It hasn't been easy. I've had to work for this,"" he said. ""German will be always kind of hard to me and you learn new things every day, but I am getting the basics right. ""I know what the manager is saying in training sessions, which makes it easier. ""I think me being so comfortable being abroad is due to the fact I've always been away from home since I was young. ""The first couple of years were very tough and then as I got older, people started to tell me 'it's either this or going back home.' ""I always loved football, so chose the hard option. I'm just happy that's it's all working out."" But Sancho has not forgotten his tough south London roots. ""I know what it is like growing up in that area. ""I don't want to go into details, but it's not nice, especially when you have people around you doing bad things. ""I hope I can give a positive message for the kids in south London - don't do those bad things. ""You don't have to be footballers. You could focus on your school work. ""Education is the most important thing and I am lucky enough that I had the opportunity to go to Harefield. ""I wanted to stay at home and travel, but the people around me told me what was best. ""I listened to them and I am happy that I am where I am, here today."" Out of sight does not mean Sancho is out of mind for England manager Gareth Southgate. ""Last time I spoke to Gareth was when I left, but (England assistant coach) Steve Holland came over recently and told me what the plan was with the Nations League coming up,"" said Sancho. Having made his England debut in October as a substitute in the goalless draw against Croatia, he'll no doubt soon be swapping Dortmund's yellow and black for the white of the Three Lions."
187,11/02/2019,14:45,Lloris warns Spurs they must up their game against Dortmund,Hugo Lloris has warned that Tottenham must improve if they are to have any chance against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Wednesday after a patchy display against Leicester.,"The 31-year-old French goalkeeper -- who captained his country to World Cup glory last year -- kept out Jamie Vardy's second-half penalty and made a number of other important saves as Spurs won 3-1 at Wembley to remain on the fringes of the Premier League title race. Although the scoreline suggests an easy win for Mauricio Pochettino's men, who are in third place in the Premier League, five points behind Manchester City and Liverpool, Leicester looked dangerous and had 20 shots at goal. ""Leicester played in a fantastic way and I think we won the game thanks to our spirit and character,"" said Spurs captain Lloris ahead of the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie on Wednesday. ""Without that, we could not win this game. I think we need to improve the team performance. We won but against a bigger side we couldn't have won that type of game. It's up to us."" Spurs beat Borussia Dortmund twice in last season's group stage but the German league leaders are a different proposition this campaign five points ahead of Bayern Munich at the top of the table. ""They play fantastic football,"" Lloris said. ""They have so many fantastic players and I'm not surprised they're top of the league in Germany. ""The manager is very good with a great idea of football. It's going to be very, very difficult. We need to obviously improve the team performance, compared to today (Sunday), and we need the stadium to push, to help us. ""In some days it's difficult to deal with Wembley but hopefully in this big game we'll receive this help from the crowd."""
188,10/02/2019,01:30,English academies have left Germany behind - Dortmund boss Zorc,"Premier League academies have left their German rivals far behind, according to Borussia Dortmund boss Michael Zorc, with Bundesliga clubs now scouting British talent in the hope of unearthing future stars.","Bundesliga leaders Dortmund play Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday at Wembley in an intriguing Champions League last 16 tie with Jadon Sancho, 18, a regular in the German side following his successful move from Manchester City in August 2017. Dortmund's domestic rivals are attempting to develop a Sancho of their own. Welsh winger Rabbi Matondo, 18, joined Schalke last month and England youth internationals Reiss Nelson, 19, and Emile Rowe-Smith, 18, have both quit Arsenal for loan spells at Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig respectively. Even Bayern Munich are following the trend by attempting to lure England Under-19 forward Callum Hudson-Odoi from Chelsea. Zorc says it is becoming harder to discover talent in Germany, leaving Bundesliga clubs looking overseas and scouring the academies of Premier League clubs. ""As a German club, we would favour, of course, identifying and signing German talent or developing them in our academy,"" said Dortmund's sports director. ""But when it gets to absolutely top talents, it's more and more difficult to find them in Germany, to be honest."" For a while, Germany's best youngsters often headed to England, attracted by big salaries in the Premier League, which enjoys a higher global profile. Leroy Sane, still only 23, was the last German starlet to make the grade when he left Schalke for Manchester City in August 2016. Since then, the trend has reversed with British youngsters, no longer content to sit on the bench of Premier League clubs, trying their luck in the Bundesliga. ""Go back say five to ten years, there was a time that English clubs were keen to sign German players,"" said Zorc. ""But in the meantime, we have the feeling that the education and development of youth players in the English academies is quite good, to be honest. ""The teams don't only spend much money on transfers or salaries, but also on infrastructure. ""When you see these youth academies - for example Man City - you can't compare it with the German standard, it's much higher. ""And also it seems to me that it's something like a business model, because even if they don't succeed in their own teams, they sell them for higher prices. ""I just read a figure of Man City - I think they've sold young players for more than 150 million within the last three to five years. ""You can see it also in results. You know the English teams are reaching Under-17, Under-19 (finals) compared to the German ones. ""It seems to me that they overtook us."" Will Brexit, Britain's decision to leave the European Union, have an impact on teenagers moving to Germany? ""I don't know,"" said Zorc. ""Nobody knows. ""When you watch what has happened in the last six months, there are a lot of German clubs who are looking at England."" Only four of the current squad - captain Marco Reus, Mario Goetze, Jacob Bruun Larsen and Marcel Schmelzer - are products of Dortmund's academy. The number is lower at Bayern Munich where Thomas Mueller and Austria's David Alaba are the only first-team regulars to have graduated from the academy. Zorc says they recruited Sancho by offering him a clear chance to play first-team football and the English teen has seized the opportunity with eight goals and 13 assists in 28 games this season. He scored once, played a key role in two more goals and hit the post in Saturday's 3-3 draw at home to Hoffenheim. There is a clear emphasis on youth as regulars Sancho, Chelsea-bound Christian Pulisic, Dan-Axel Zagadou and Larsen are all under 21. ""I think the most important thing is not to make promises you can't keep,"" said Zorc. ""We don't say 'you are going to play, definitely', we say 'there will be opportunities'. ""We have a clear structure, but you can often look at our team sheet and see how many young players play each Saturday - not just in cup games, but big matches, including the Champions League."""

Sancho opened the scoring, set up two goals and hit the post as the hosts dazzled over 70 minutes at Signal Iduna Park. However, with the leaders cruising at 3-0 up thanks to goals by Sancho, Mario Goetze and Raphael Guerreiro, Hoffenheim came off the ropes with Algeria forward Ishak Belfodil netting twice. Despite the draw, Dortmund are eight points clear at the top of the table. The result will give Mauricio Pochettino food for thought before his Tottenham team host Dortmund on Wednesday at Wembley in the Champions League, last 16, first leg. In the absence of top-scorer and playmaker Marco Reus, sidelined with a thigh injury, Sancho stepped up with one of his best performances since joining Dortmund from Manchester City in August 2017. The 18-year-old looked to have scored a fortuitous opener when the ball bounced off him and into Hoffenheim's net with 11 minutes gone, but the video assistant referee spotted the ball had hit his upper arm. Undeterred, Sancho scored on 32 minutes, taking a return pass from Lukasz Piszczek and fired home from a tight angle. He helped double Dortmund's lead two minutes before the break when Axel Witsel found him with a long-range pass and although Sancho's shot was parried, Goetze tapped in the rebound. The pair combined for Dortmund's third, Goetze sprinting after Sancho's audacious backheel to square for Guerreiro to make it 3-0 on 67 minutes. However, just after Sancho then hit the post, Hoffenheim fought back, Belfodil tapped home his first goal from a cross by Pavel Kaderabek. The Czech midfielder made it 2-0 with a bullet header eight minutes from time. Belfodil completed the comeback and claimed a point for Hoffenheim when he launched himself at a free-kick and his header beat goalkeper Roman Burki on 87 minutes. Elsewhere, Borussia Moenchengladbach slipped to third after losing 3-0 at home by Hertha Berlin as Salomon Kalou, playmaker Ondrej Duda and Davie Selke scored. In the basement battle, Hanover climbed off the bottom with a 2-0 home win at Nuremberg, who took their place as last in the table, with former Germany striker Nicolai Mueller scoring both goals. Fourth-placed RB Leipzig were held to a goalless draw at home by Eintracht Frankfurt, who are just one place behind them.

Reus has scored 17 goals, setting up 11 more this season in all competitions, and director of sport Michael Zorc says ""we will decide at the start of the week"" whether he can face Spurs. The 29-year-old injured his thigh after scoring in Tuesday's German Cup defeat at home to Werder Bremen. Illness has also taken a toll with head coach Lucien Favre, who has the flu, unlikely to be on the bench against Hoffenheim as Dortmund start the weekend with a seven-point lead in the table. Zorc says he hopes either first-choice goalkeeper Roman Burki or his back-up Marwin Hitz will be fit to face Hoffenheim. The pair missed the home defeat to Bremen with illness, leaving reserve team keeper Eric Oelschlaegel to make his Dortmund debut. ""We have good reason to hope that both goalkeepers will be fit to play,"" said Zorc."
192,08/02/2019,01:00,"From Southwark to Bundesliga star, the rise of Jadon Sancho","Despite becoming a full England international and Borussia Dortmund star at just 18, Jadon Sancho insists his seamless transition after a groundbreaking move to the Bundesliga leaders has not come easy.","Dortmund hold a seven-point lead in Germany and Bayern Munich's six-year domination of the Bundesliga is under serious threat with Sancho in the thick of things. The south London-born forward has netted seven goals this season, creating 12 more, in all competitions and has forged a potent partnership with Germany star Marco Reus for Dortmund. Sancho's bold decision in August 2017 - when he was just 17 - to leave Manchester City has paved the way for a flurry of British youngsters to head to Germany, looking for more game time rather than being stuck on the bench at their Premier League clubs. England Under-21 star Reiss Nelson, 19, has scored six goals at Hoffenheim on loan from Arsenal, Welsh winger Rabbi Matondo, 18, joined Schalke last month from Man City and Emile Smith-Rowe, 18, has swapped Arsenal for a loan spell at RB Leipzig. ""I feel like young players are looking to go away now, because they are seeing my success, but it's not easy,"" Sancho told AFP. ""People think that because I am doing so well, but everyone's journey is different. ""Mine was just to come out here and to work on me. ""I couldn't speak for other young players, but they are probably giving it a thought now."" He shares a flat with his father and is struggling to learn German, but this Saturday Sancho hopes to see another friendly face, his close friend Nelson, when Dortmund host Hoffenheim. The teenagers first met playing in the same under-11 team at the 2011 Southwark Youth Games in London. ""We go way back,"" said Sancho. ""It will be very nice to stand on the pitch with him on Saturday. ""I hope we get that opportunity, it will be a nice memory for our families, coming from the same area and hopefully being proud of us."" But who speaks the best German? ""He would say him, I would say me,"" laughed Sancho. He raised eyebrows when he quit Premier League giants City, unhappy with his prospects, and jumped at the chance to prove himself at Dortmund. The move paid off as he made his full England debut last October. ""I felt at the time I needed something different,"" he explained. ""Borussia Dortmund were the club I chose, I thought this will be my new home and I'll work very hard to prove myself."" Even the mighty Bayern failed to handle him and Reus in their November showdown as the latter scored twice in Dortmund's famous 3-2 home victory. Sancho played his part in Dortmund's winning goal, tracking back to dispossess Franck Ribery and start the move that ended in Paco Alcacer finding the net. He describes Dortmund team-mates like Reus, Mario Goetze and Belgium midfielder Axel Witsel as ""role models"" who help him ""improve every day"". His meteoric rise does not appear to have gone to his head, shaking hands with reporters and photographers before the interview in a refreshing display of manners in modern football. Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc admits the teenager's consistency caught him by surprise. ""I haven't been surprised by his performances, but with how fast he managed to get to this senior level, because before that he only played for youth teams. ""Also the stability of his performances, he played nearly every game for us last autumn, always at a high level, but he could still play in our under-19 team - that is unbelievable for me."" Dortmund face Tottenham Hotspur away in next Wednesday's Champions League last 16 first leg and Sancho is relishing returning to London with his German club. Playing in front of his family and friends in his home city is ""something I've always wanted to do since I was a young boy,"" the teenager said."
193,23/12/2018,21:25,Can leaders Dortmund halt Bayern's Bundesliga domination?,"Despite finishing the first half of the season six points behind leaders Borussia Dortmund, defending champions Bayern Munich are confident of securing a seventh straight Bundesliga title next May.","""That's what we are all assuming in Munich,"" said Bayern coach Niko Kovac on Saturday, as the Bundesliga breaks for winter until January 18. Their 3-0 victory at Eintracht Frankfurt this weekend was Bayern's fifth consecutive league win, moving them up to second, but Dortmund are eyeing a first Bundesliga title for seven years. Here are five things we have learned from the first half of the Bundesliga season: Kovac, 47, has been in office for six months but has already survived a crisis after Bayern dropped to sixth in October after consecutive defeats by Hertha Berlin and Borussia Moenchengladbach. The losses fuelled reports stars Thomas Mueller, Arjen Robben, Mats Hummels and Franck Ribery were unhappy with Kovac. After a 3-2 reverse at Dortmund in November, Bayern were held to an embarrassing 3-3 draw at home to strugglers Fortuna Duesseldorf and Kovac was threatened with unemployment until a 5-1 drubbing of Benfica in the Champions League lifted the pressure. ""One must not forget we lost six points to three teams in the lower tier,"" said chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge referring to Bayern's disappointing draws with Freiburg, Augsburg and Duesseldorf over the last few months. ""There were discussions with Niko and some players -- now Niko and his team are at one again."" For the first time since 2012, Bayern are not top going into the winter break and Dortmund have the potential to end the Bavarians' stranglehold on the Bundesliga trophy. ""But we have only eaten half the cake,"" insisted Dortmund captain Marco Reus, scorer of 11 goals this season with seven assists. Alongside the injury-prone Reus, Paco Alcacer has been outstanding with 12 goals in as many league games. The 25-year-old was initially signed on loan from Barcelona, but after scoring in each of his first five games, Dortmund signed him permanently and he scored the winner against Bayern in November. However, it will be a huge test for Dortmund to deny Bayern for five more months with pundit Matthias Sammer warning that Lucien Favre's team are still ""in the development phase"". English teenager Jadon Sancho has so far been the best youngster in Germany's top flight. The 18-year-old has been involved in all of Dortmund's last nine goals in open play, scoring twice and providing three assists, while delivering the penultimate pass leading to the goal on another four occasions. The ex-Manchester City winger is not the only English export dazzling in Germany. Nineteen-year-old Reiss Nelson has scored six goals for Hoffenheim on loan from Arsenal, seizing his chance after finding opportunities limited in the Premier League. Borussia Moenchengladbach go into the winter break third -- which surprises even head coach Dieter Hecking. ""To be where we are with 33 points is obviously sensational,"" said Hecking after Friday's 2-1 defeat at Dortmund. Forwards Alassane Plea and Thorgan Hazard, with nine goals each, are at the heart of Gladbach's success, while a robust defence has led to a perfect record of eight home league wins. Gladbach romped to a 3-0 victory at Bayern in October, but then showed frailties at the back in a 3-1 defeat at Freiburg and a shock 5-1 drubbing at home to Leverkusen in the German Cup. RB Leipzig are fourth, on course for a Champions League return after a season's absence, with Timo Werner playing a key role. The 22-year-old was lethal in front of goal in Saturday's 3-2 win at home to Werder Bremen, pouncing on a terrible backpass before rounding the goalkeeper to clinically slot home his chance. It bumped his league goals tally to 11 in 2018/19 to prove he is back to his best after Germany's dismal World Cup performance. As part of Germany's new-look attack alongside Manchester City's Leroy Sane and Bayern's Serge Gnabry, Werner will be a key factor when the Euro 2020 qualifiers start in March."

Dortmund have yet to confirm Burki's withdrawal, but in his absence Marwin Hitz, 31, who is also a goalkeeper with the Switzerland national team, would step in. So far this season, Hitz has only played in the German Cup, second round win at home to second division Union Berlin ten days ago, when a late penalty settled a 3-2 win in extra time. Third-placed Bayern, who have won the Bundesliga for each of the last six seasons, arrive in Dortmund four points behind the league leaders before kick-off (1730 GMT) in the mouth-watering German league showdown."
195,09/11/2018,02:31,Make-or-break? Kovac in firing line as Bayern tackle Dortmund,Bayern Munich are embracing the role of underdogs for Saturday's Bundesliga showdown at leaders Borussia Dortmund with captain Manuel Neuer admitting all is not well with the defending champions.,"Bayern have won 10 of their last 19 games against Dortmund, including a 6-0 thrashing of the current league leaders last March when Robert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick against his former club in Munich. Six months later, third-placed Bayern trail Dortmund by four points in the table and struggling for form under coach Niko Kovac. In the wake of a 2-0 defeat at Hertha Berlin and a 3-0 upset at home to Moenchengladbach -- with Bayern out-played in both league games -- the Bavarian giants have laboured to beat even limited teams in recent weeks. ""We are not the 'Super-Bayern' that everyone knows and aren't setting off fireworks with our performances,"" admitted Neuer after Wednesday's laboured 2-0 win over AEK on Wednesday in the Champions League. Even Bayern president Uli Hoeness sees the Bavarians as ""underdogs"" at Dortmund, a notion the hosts reject. ""We've heard what has been said, but we don't care -- we are just enjoying the situation,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc on Thursday. ""It doesn't make much sense to compare (Dortmund with Bayern) -- they have won the last six Bundesliga titles."" On paper, there is little cause for concern from Bayern's perspective. They trail Dortmund by only four points and on the verge of the Champions League knock-out stages, topping their group with 10 points. Yet frustrating recent performances tell a different story with rumours of unrest in the dressing room. Senior players Thomas Mueller, Mats Hummels, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery are reportedly not behind Kovac -- a toxic situation for any head coach at Bayern. Ex-Bayern and Germany legend Lothar Matthaeus believes Saturday's match can make -- or break -- Kovac's tenure. ""A victory there and all Bayern fans would conjure up a smile again,"" said Matthaeus, 57, who sees a ""great chance"" for Bayern to ""reassert themselves and silence a few critical voices"". However, defeat would leave Bayern seven points behind Dortmund -- a near-unthinkable situation for Hoeness -- with Matthaeus warning Kovac is effectively ""not allowed to lose with his team in Dortmund"". Thomas Mueller expects an electric atmosphere at Dortmund in front of an 81,000 sell-out crowd. ""We will have to torture ourselves a bit,"" said the Germany midfielder. ""Dortmund are in a phase and playing refreshing football going forward. ""We have to keep up and not let the gap grow."" The goals could flow with Dortmund striker Paco Alcacer scoring seven goals in his first four league games on loan from Barcelona. Likewise, Lewandowski has scored 12 goals in his 15 games against Dortmund, who he left on a free transfer in 2014. Both teams are waiting on key players. Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki picked up a knock in Tuesday's 2-0 defeat at Atletico Madrid in the Champions League. Bayern winger Arjen Robben trained individually on Thursday as he recovers from a knee injury. Bayern will head north determined to claim a third straight win at Dortmund after last November's 3-1 away league win and penalty shoot-out victory in the pre-season German Super Cup in August 2017. ""We are four points behind and of course we want to be top -- we will come back, you can all be sure of that,"" warned Mueller. Fixtures (all times 1430 GMT unless stated)"
196,08/11/2018,18:52,Witsel ready to lead Dortmund's young charges against Bayern,"With his 30th birthday looming, youthful Borussia Dortmund's elder statesman Axel Witsel wants to lead the Bundesliga pace-setters to a rare home win over defending champions Bayern Munich in Saturday's top-of-the-table showdown.","The midfielder has been a revelation at Dortmund since joining for 20 million euros ($22.8m) from Chinese side Tianjin Quanjian after his impressive performances at the World Cup helped Belgium finish third. Witsel is relishing his first appearance in 'Der Klassiker', with third-placed Munich trailing Dortmund by four points. ""Yes, I am a leader,"" Witsel, who turns 30 in January, told reporters on Thursday. The Dortmund team is packed with rising stars like 18-year-old England winger Jadon Sancho, full-back Achraf Hakimi and US winger Christian Pulisic, both 20, and Witsel enjoys having to keep up with players a decade his junior. ""We have a group that is really young, with players from 18 to 25 years old, so it's up to us 'oldies' to guide them in the good times and also when things don't go so well,"" added Witsel. Witsel has not just been Dortmund's midfield enforcer as he often is for his national team. He has weighed in with three goals, including the winner in the German Cup first round at Greuther Fuerth and the first in Dortmund's 4-0 thumping of Atletico Madrid in the Champions League two weeks ago, before they lost the return match 2-0 away on Tuesday. ""(Coach Lucien Favre) deserves a lot of credit for the game we are playing at the moment,"" said Witsel. ""I do not have the same role as in the national team, where I have to stay back and control things. ""I like both roles. In the national team I feel great, but here it's a lot of fun to push forward from time to time. ""But I'm not a 10 (behind the striker), I'm still an 'eight', a box-to-box player."" Dortmund are the only team yet to lose in Germany's top flight this year and with Bayern third after defeats to Hertha Berlin and Borussia Moenchengladbach, Witsel sees a great chance for the hosts. ""They have not been good for a few weeks, so it's up to us to take advantage,"" said Witsel. ""But it's not going to be an easy match. Bayern can wake up for games like this, so it will be up to us to pay attention."" With two thirds of the season still to go, Witsel says no one in the Dortmund squad is yet daring to dream of a first league title since 2012 despite their unbeaten start. ""The goal is to qualify for the Champions League next year, so we are in a favourable position, but no-one in the dressing is talking about winning the championship,"" he insisted. A crowd of over 80,000 is expected and Witsel is looking forward to playing Dortmund's biggest league home game of the season in front of Signal Iduna Park's famous 'Yellow Wall' -- the south stand which holds almost 25,000 baying fans. ""This is my first (home game against Bayern) and I can't wait to see how it feels in terms of atmosphere,"" Witsel said on Thursday. ""Although every time we play at home there is a mad atmosphere, I think against Bayern it will be a little more."""
197,08/11/2018,16:18,Dortmund brush off 'favourites' tag from Bayern ahead of showdown,Borussia Dortmund have brushed off suggestions from Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness that the Bundesliga leaders are favourites for Saturday's showdown as mind games started between Germany's top two clubs.,"Lucien Favre's Dortmund have a four-point lead over defending champions Bayern ahead of the match at Signal Iduna Park, leaving Hoeness to insist: ""we're the outsiders"". But even though Dortmund are the only team in Germany's top flight still unbeaten this season and are closing in on a club record run without defeat from the start of a season, their director of sport Michael Zorc rejected the idea that Bayern can be considered underdogs. ""For the first time in a long time, we face FB Bayern as leaders in the table, but that doesn't mean much. The favourite doesn't get an extra goal,"" said Zorc in Thursday's press conference. ""We have heard what has been said, but we don't care -- we are just enjoying the situation. ""It doesn't make much sense to compare (Dortmund with Bayern), they have won the last six Bundesliga titles."" Dortmund go into the weekend's clash having been second best all over the pitch in their 2-0 away defeat at Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday. ""We have good reasons to go into the game with confidence, but of course we have to play better than we did at Atletico,"" added Zorc. Favre is waiting on the fitness of goalkeeper Roman Buerki and defender Abdou Diallo, who are both carrying knocks, but should have the rest of his squad fit. If they avoid defeat to Bayern, Dortmund will equal their club record start of 11 league games unbeaten established in 2002/03, but Favre says his youthful side still has much to learn. ""We have made progress, but there is still a lot to do, especially tactically,"" said Favre. ""We have a lot of plans, but we have a lot of young players and they still need time."""
198,07/11/2018,13:06,Dortmund must bounce back against Bayern - Goetze,Mario Goetze says German league leaders Borussia Dortmund must put their first defeat of the season behind them and bounce back in Saturday's crunch Bundesliga showdown at home against Bayern Munich.,"Atletico Madrid avenged their 4-0 drubbing at Dortmund from a fortnight ago with a 2-0 home victory on Tuesday in the group stages of the Champions League as the Germans suffered their first loss of the 2018/19 season. Dortmund lead the Bundesliga and have a four-point lead over defending champions Bayern Munich who they host this weekend. ""Losing is a new situation, but we knew it would be a very intense week with Atletico and Bayern - now we have to bounce back,"" said Goezte, who replaced striker Paco Alcacer for the last 15 minutes in Madrid. Goalkeeper Roman Buerki, who has only been beaten 10 times in as many league games this season, said the defeat may have done Dortmund some good. ""Perhaps it's not so bad, that we have come back down to earth after a few weeks when everything was going so well,"" said Buerki. Club captain Marco Reus, who has been in great form this season with nine goals and seven assists in 16 games, brushed the defeat off. ""We were not so fresh, Atletico closed down the space, which was very difficult for us, we only found a few ways through,"" said Reus. ""It was the first defeat, but life goes on."" The defeat in Madrid leaves both Dortmund and Atletico neck-and-neck on nine points in Group A with two matches left. However, their focus now is on this weekend's Bundesliga showdown as Dortmund look to prove their status as Germany's top side and make amends for their heavy defeat to the Bavarians the last time they met. Bayern thrashed Dortmund 6-0 in Munich in March, as Robert Lewandowski netted a hat-trick against his former club."
199,06/11/2018,23:14,Atletico gain sweet revenge by cruising past Dortmund,Atletico Madrid avenged their Borussia Dortmund drubbing from a fortnight ago and revived hopes of going through top of Champions League Group A by beating the German side 2-0 at the Wanda Metropolitano on Tuesday.,"Dortmund handed Atletico their heaviest defeat under Diego Simeone with a 4-0 victory 13 days ago but this contest was almost a mirror image, the hosts in control from start to finish. Saul Niguez and Antoine Griezmann scored a goal in each half to complete a win that puts Atleti five points clear of third-place Club Brugge with two games to play, and on the brink of the Champions League knock-out stage. First place is also back in sight, with Atletico and Dortmund each on nine points, even if Simeone's side have the slightly tougher task of playing Brugge away in their final fixture. ""We wanted to get one back on them after the first game,"" Saul said. ""It was tough to take and it might have gone the other way two weeks ago. Tonight was a bit of revenge for us."" After losing in Germany, Atleti were also held at struggling Leganes in La Liga on Saturday and this result, without the injured Diego Costa, Diego Godin and Koke, will do wonders for morale. The only set-back was defender Jose Gimenez being forced off at half-time with what the club confirmed was a thigh strain. ""The team responded,"" Simeone said. ""We played as a team and when everyone buys into that, you have your identity. You can feel what you do together and today the boys showed that."" Dortmund, who sit top of the Bundesliga, host Bayern Munich on Saturday and they lacked the same verve they showed two weeks ago. ""They dominated us today,"" Dortmund coach Lucien Favre said, before brushing off the suggestion this could hang over them against Bayern. ""It's just a defeat. It can happen."" England's Jadon Sancho was handed his fourth consecutive start for the visitors, his longest run in the side this season. After a bright start, the youngster faded and was replaced late in the second half. The first 30 minutes was a battle for the pace of the game, with Atletico trying to keep it fast and frenetic while Dortmund aimed to kill momentum at every opportunity. Angel Correa twice went close but otherwise Atleti's authority came to little in the way of chances until the 32nd minute. Saul began the move by playing left to Filipe Luis and finished it too, sliding the ball goalward where Manuel Akanji lashed it into his own net. In between, Filipe's pass had been brilliantly dummied by Correa. Their resistance broken, Dortmund lost their way and were hanging on at the end of the half. Thomas Partey's drive grazed the crossbar and soon after Saul skewed wide when left open at the back post. Simeone was convinced they deserved a penalty when Griezmann's effort was parried and the incoming Saul was taken out by Lukasz Piszczek. Dortmund's best chance came early in the second half when Paco Alcacer nipped in after a Francisco Montero slip. Alcacer fired across goal but with such force that Raphael Guerreiro, five yards out, hardly saw the ball as it flew off his head and over the bar. Atletico waited for their moment on the counter-attack and when it came in the 80th minute, they pounced. One pass out of defence found Gelson Martins, who helped it forward to Partey. He played inside to Griezmann, who muscled through and poked the ball past Roman Burki. Simeone turned, his fist pumping. Dortmund's hopes of a comeback were dashed and Atletico were back in with a realistic chance of topping the group."
200,05/11/2018,02:30,Wobbling Atletico aiming for bounce back against Dortmund,Atletico Madrid's underwhelming start to the season might have been overshadowed by the crisis enveloping city rivals Real but there will be no place to hide against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday.,"A fortnight ago Dortmund dealt Diego Simeone's side a 4-0 drubbing, Atletico's heaviest defeat since the coach took charge 392 matches ago, while on Saturday they were held to a 1-1 draw by lowly Leganes, 18th in La Liga and with six defeats already to their name. This was supposed to be Atletico's year, primed for a title challenge by some impressive signings in the summer and eyeing a run at the Champions League, pumped by the prospect of a final inside their own Wanda Metropolitano in June. Their failings against Dortmund and Leganes were more striking because they were caused by weaknesses in defence, their strong point under Simeone. Dortmund pounced on Atletico to hit three in 10 minutes at the Signal Iduna Park, while on Saturday Leganes equalised thanks to lax marking at a free-kick. Atletico are cast in Simeone's image and have rarely been easy on the eye during his tenure. After scoring from a nine-pass move against Huesca last month, the coach said: ""I liked it because it ended with a goal."" Their backline in recent years has been the hardest to breach in Europe. ""Nobody has the perfect way of playing,"" Simeone said last week. ""It is about a pursuit of winning."" Weaker defending has placed greater demand on the attack but Antoine Griezmann's partnership with Diego Costa, so effective last season, appears to have lost its spark. Costa has one goal all season and is yet to get off the mark in La Liga. After turning 30 last month, it is tempting to wonder if the Spaniard's best days are now behind him. Simeone remains loyal to Costa as he shares his best qualities -- grit, determination, an unrelenting will to win -- with his striker. They also define Atletico at their best. ""He is an extraordinary player and very important to us,"" Simeone said last month. ""Not least because of what he contributes to the atmosphere in the dressing room."" The rest of the team have not stepped in to fill the gap. Griezmann has five goals in 14, a decent return, but some way off the numbers needed. Thomas Lemar, the club's most exciting signing in the summer, has only two, and his unmistakeable talent has so far only been seen in fits and starts. The overall sense is Atletico are under-delivering on expectations. Some have even suggested the message of Simeone, into his eighth year in charge, might have lost its punch. More likely, perhaps, is that they simply over-achieved before. ""The biggest plus of Simeone is he knows how to convince his players of his ideas,"" former Barcelona midfielder Xavi Hernandez told Catalunya Radio on Saturday. ""He believes it is the only way to compete with Barca and Real Madrid. And his players believe it as well."" Five wins from 11 games is hardly the form of champions but Atletico still have all to play for thanks to their stumbling rivals. They sit third in the table, only four points adrift of leaders Barcelona and three ahead of Real. In the Champions League, victory over Dortmund this week could seal qualification with two games to spare and put them level on points with the Bundesliga leaders. Beating the Germans to top spot may be out of reach given their scintillating form at home and abroad but as Real Madrid . Real's success, though, particularly in Europe, has come from a knack of casting off what has gone before and peaking when it matters most. Atletico need to take a leaf out of their rival's book."
201,04/11/2018,17:05,Record-breaking Dortmund head to Madrid to start 'awesome' week,Thomas Delaney says record-breaking Borussia Dortmund are relishing their chance to claim a place in the Champions League knockout phase at Atletico Madrid and tighten their grip on top spot in the Bundesliga in their showdown with Bayern Munich next weekend.,"""It's going to be an awesome week - we're in good form and looking forward to it,"" said Denmark midfielder Delaney, who set up club captain Marco Reus for their winning goal in Saturday's hard-earned 1-0 win at Wolfsburg. It was Dortmund's 15th straight match without defeat in all competitions under head coach Lucien Favre, bettering the previous record of Thomas Tuchel, who led Dortmund to 14 games without defeat three years ago. ""I didn't know about that,"" admitted Favre when asked about the new club record, ahead of a week in which he faces his biggest challenges since he took charge in July. The Germans travel to Atletico's Wanda Metropolitano stadium for Tuesday's Champions League rematch having thrashed Diego Simeone's side 4-0 in Dortmund a fortnight ago. Another win over the Spaniards will guarantee Dortmund a place in the last 16 of the Champions League. Then comes Saturday's crunch visit defending Bundesliga champions Bayern, who trail leaders Dortmund by four points and again flattered to deceive in their 1-1 draw at home to Freiburg on Saturday. A win at the weekend would put clear daylight between Dortmund and Bayern, who are chasing a seventh straight Bundesliga title. ""Bayern's result (on Saturday) will certainly help put them under even more pressure,"" said retired former Dortmund captain Sebastian Kehl, looking past Atletico and towards next weekend. However, Dortmund's focus is firmly on Madrid. ""They (Atletico) will go into the game with a lot of fighting spirit and try to avenge the 4-0 result,"" added Kehl. Favre admitted that Dortmund ""found it very difficult to find holes"" in Wolfsburg's defence and that ""there was danger until the end"". The gritty win at Wolfsburg also comes after they needed a Reus penalty -- in the last second of extra-time -- to snatch a 3-2 win over second division Union Berlin in the German Cup last Wednesday. Nevertheless, Dortmund will fly to Madrid with high on confidence as they chase a win to put them in the knock-out stages of the Champions League. English teenager Jadon Sancho has scored five goals and made eight assists this season, impressing with his displays from the left wing. Reus is injury-free and in great form, having been involved in 16 goals in 15 games this season, scoring nine and setting up seven more. ""I have always said that when I am healthy, I can help the team,"" said the fleet-footed Reus, who was sidelined between May last year and January with torn knee ligaments. On top of that, striker Paco Alcacer is back from a thigh injury having scored an incredible eight goals in just six games since joining on loan from Barcelona."
202,02/11/2018,03:00,Stuttering Bayern look to capitalise on Dortmund injury crisis,Arjen Robben has admitted that Bayern Munich are some way from their best form as they head into what he says is a must-win game for the Bundesliga champions at Freiburg on Saturday.,"The Dutch winger said that he and his team mates needed to be ""self-critical"" as they bid to return to the top of the Bundesliga this weekend. Bayern are two points behind leaders Borussia Dortmund, who have been plunged into an injury crisis ahead of a tricky trip to Wolfsburg, and have the chance ot overtake Dortmund ahead of their face-to-face next week. Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen are looking to continue their explosive return to form against Hoffenheim, while Stuttgart coach Markus Weinzierl is hoping to shake off comparisons with the Bundesliga's worst ever team. Here are five things to look out for in the Bundesliga this weekend. Bayern Munich may have won their last four games, but both coach Niko Kovac and his players know that they need to improve when they host Freiburg on Saturday. ""We're not playing our best football at the moment,"" Arjen Robben told Amazon Music this week, after watching his teammates labour to a 2-1 cup win over fourth tier side SV Roedinghausen. ""We need to win against Freiburg, maybe we can take another step forward and gain confidence before we play Dortmund the week after."" Kovac will have to do without in-form midfield maestro Thiago, who tore an ankle ligament against Roedinghausen. Leaders Borussia Dortmund, meanwhile, are facing a defensive crisis as they look to keep Bayern at bay with a win in Wolfsburg. With Manuel Akanji, Lukasz Piszczek and Marcel Schmelzer all out injured, things went from bad to worse when Abdou Diallo limped off the field early in Dortmund's 3-2 cup win over Union Berlin on Wednesday. Raphael Guerreiro is set to take Diallo's place in defence, while up front, Mario Goetze has also been ruled out with bronchitis. Julian Brandt has said that he and his Bayer Leverkusen team mates have gone from boys to men in the space of a few days. In full-blown crisis this time last week, Leverkusen look a side transformed as they prepare to host Hoffenheim, having chalked up a 6-2 win over Werder Bremen and a 5-0 thrashing of Borussia Moenchengladbach in the last few days. ""We couldn't have even dreamed of this a week ago,"" said Brandt. ""At the beginning of the season, we were playing like children, we were naive. Now, the little kiddies have grown up."" Leverkusen face a Hoffenheim side reeling from a cup exit to Red Bull Leipzig in midweek and with one eye on a crucial Champions League clash with Lyon on Wednesday. Fresh from their cup win over Hoffenheim, RB Leipzig will be hoping to extend their unbeaten run to ten games when they head to top six rivals Hertha Berlin this week. Leipzig's last defeat came against Red Bull Salzburg back in September, and they have not lost in the league since the opening day. Yet Leipzig face a tough Hertha side who are level on points with them and are unbeaten at home this season. ""I think we have a big chance to win this game,"" said Hertha coach Pal Dardai. New coach Markus Weinzierl will be hoping to reboot his two-week-old reign at Stuttgart with a win against Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday. Weinzierl began life at Stuttgart with two 4-0 defeats, the worst start any Bundesliga coach has made since 1966, when Tasmania Berlin lost their first two games under Heinz-Ludwig Schmidt, 4-0 and 5-0. Tasmania went on to become the worst team in Bundesliga history, losing 28 games and conceding 108 goals on their way to relegation. For Weinzierl and Stuttgart, the only way is up.

203,29/10/2018,14:33,Five things we learnt in the Bundesliga,Bayern Munich's away win at Mainz lifted them up to second in the Bundesliga table as their five closest rivals all failed to pick up three points at the weekend.,"English teenager Jadon Sancho continues to shine for leaders Borussia Dortmund with two goals in their 2-2 draw at home to Hertha Berlin. <strong>Here are five things we learnt about the Bundesliga this weekend:</strong> ""Thiago or nothing!"" was Pep Guardiola's single demand at the start of his three-year reign as Bayern's head coach in 2013 and sure enough, Thiago Alcantara was signed for 25 million euros ($28.5m) from Barcelona. Thiago's well-timed slide into the penalty area on Saturday saw the midfielder score to seal Bayern's crucial 2-1 win at Mainz. It was his first goal of the season and the win moved Bayern up to second in the table and halved Dortmund's lead to two points. It was a far from polished display and after Leon Goretzka gave Bayern a first-half lead, sloppy defending allowed Mainz to equalise before Thiago's winner. ""We are making life hard for ourselves, especially when we concede a goal just after the break,"" admitted right-back Joshua Kimmich. ""We certainly didn't set off any fireworks with that performance."" However, sparks are expected to fly when Bayern play Dortmund away in a fortnight. Dortmund threw away two points on Saturday, and the chance for a seventh straight win, when Hertha Berlin forward Salomon Kalou converted a 91st-minute penalty to seal a 2-2 draw. Dortmund lived dangerously in the final ten minutes as Berlin pair Davie Selkie and Kalou both had clear chances before the spot-kick in added time. ""We were naive in the last ten minutes,"" admitted Dortmund captain Marco Reus. Sancho, 18, was again outstanding. In nine league games, he has played a hand in 11 goals, scoring four and setting up seven more. The English teenager took over the scoring duties from injured Paco Alcacer, Dortmund's striker who has hit seven goals in four league games. Having beaten Bayern in Berlin and earned a draw at Dortmund on Saturday, Hertha are sixth in the table and punching above their weight under head coach Pal Dardai. However, their fans let the club down at Dortmund when 200 'Ultras' went on the rampage in the away block, where fighting with police resulted in 45 casualties. ""This is a day which damages football and our club,"" said Hertha manager Michael Preetz. Hertha are working with police to identify those responsible and the German Football Association (DFB) are investigating. Freiburg striker Lucas Hoeler scored a freak goal from 45 metres in Friday's shock 3-1 win over third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach - which he admitted practising. When Gladbach goalkeeper Yann Sommer made a late clearance kick to the right of his own box, the ball fell to Hoeler near the halfway line and the 24-year-old fired into an empty net. Hoeler revealed he had practised shooting from distance at former club Sandhausen. ""As a bit of a joke, the coach used to let us practise shooting with dropped kicks from the halfway line after training,"" said Hoeler. ""I knew I had to control the ball and fire it straight in or Sommer would have had time to get back. ""I worried that he might stop it, so I was delighted it went in."" Bayer Leverkusen's 6-2 thumping of Werder Bremen on Sunday probably saved head coach Heiko Herrlich from the sack. ""I hope the result will perk us up,"" Herrlich said after his team's first league win for a month pulled them away from the bottom three. ""Whether this game consolidated my position? I am the wrong person to ask."" Leverkusen's fleet-footed forwards Kevin Volland, Karim Bellarabi, Kai Havertz and Julian Brandt, who each scored, were all outstanding. A German Cup second-round match at Moenchengladbach on Wednesday and a home league clash against Hoffenheim on Saturday will show whether the romp in Bremen was a fluke - and whether Herrlich's job is truly safe."
204,27/10/2018,20:51,"Hertha draw 'feels like a defeat', says Dortmund's Goetze","Germany midfielder Mario Goetze admitted Borussia Dortmund's 2-2 draw at home to Hertha Berlin on Saturday felt ""like a defeat"" after the Bundesliga leaders conceded a stoppage-time equaliser.","English teenager Jadon Sancho netted either side of half-time as Dortmund were heading for a seventh straight win in all competitions until Salomon Kalou converted a 91st-minute penalty to share the points at Signal Iduna Park. ""If you look at the way the game went, it definitely feels like a defeat. It feels like we lost the two points,"" admitted Goetze, whose superb final pass set up Sancho for Dortmund's opening goal on 27 minutes. ""Of course, we didn't finish the chances we had in the second half. ""We work as a team, but for the first time it didn't work and we weren't efficient with our chances."" Dortmund were punished for living dangerously late on when defender Dan-Axel Zagadou brought down Hertha forward Davie Selke in the area for the spot-kick which Kalou converted. ""We had planned something special, but the bravery was missing to see it through,"" said Hertha coach Pal Dardai. ""The first 20 minutes weren't okay,"" he added. ""But things were better after we conceded the first goal. ""We invested a lot and definitely wanted the point, so you can say it was deserved."" With Bayern Munich now just two points behind in second place, Dortmund's next home league match -- against Munich in a fortnight -- is shaping up to be a top-of-the-table showdown. Meanwhile in Mainz, goals by Leon Goretzka and Thiago Alcantara sealed Bayern's 2-1 win at Mainz which lifted them from fourth in the table. Bayern have won three games in seven days since ending a four-match winless streak last Saturday. Head coach Niko Kovac welcomed the three points, but he was unhappy with how Bayern leaked a goal by Jean-Paul Boetius three minutes into the second half. ""I was angry that we did not do what we discussed during the half-time break,"" said Kovac. ""We wanted to make our mark immediately and not let anything happen. ""Then we were asleep for the cross, that annoyed me, because we put ourselves in trouble. ""The fact that the team managed to get the second goal pleased me."" Bayern forward Thomas Mueller, who started on the right wing after two games on the bench, admitted there is still room for improvement. ""We had clearly more chances, but at the end it was only 2-1 and we can live with that,"" said Mueller, who replaced the suspended Arjen Robben in the starting line-up. ""We aren't flying through the league and our games and we aren't in a position to be able to complain about wins."""
205,24/10/2018,23:30,Dortmund thrash Atletico as Sancho scores first Champions League goal,"Borussia Dortmund stunned Atletico Madrid with a 4-0 thrashing on Wednesday to move to the verge of the Champions League knockout stage, as English teenager Jadon Sancho scored his first goal in the competition.","It was the heaviest Champions League defeat ever suffered by Diego Simeone in seven years as Atletico head coach and put Dortmund top of Group A after both teams had previously beaten Club Brugge and Monaco. Axel Witsel gave Dortmund the lead at Signal Iduna Park when his first-half shot took a wicked deflection, before Raphael Guerreiro, who scored twice in the second half, and 18-year-old Sancho came off the bench to grab the other goals. Dortmund were without in-form Spanish striker Paco Alcacer, who has scored seven times in just four Bundesliga games, with a leg injury, while Diego Costa returned to partner Antoine Griezmann up front for Atletico. This was a typically tense European affair, played at a frantic pace between two strong teams eager to focus on attacking football with neither defence allowing many clear chances. With 35 minutes gone, Dortmund lost midfielder Thomas Delaney with a foot injury and the Dane was replaced by Mahmoud Dahoud, who played a hand in the opening goal. After a determined run by US midfielder Christian Pulisic, 20, Dahoud carried on the move, before the ball eventually fell to Witsel, whose shot took a big deflection before finding the net. Atletico boss Simeone brought on a fresh pair of legs in midfield for the second half, taking off Thomas Partey and bringing on Rodri. The visitors showed how dangerous they can be by driving forward with real purpose and midfielder Saul Niguez crashed a shot off the woodwork on 53 minutes with Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki well beaten. Borussia were living dangerously, but a good spell midway through the second half, with Witsel in the thick of things, turned the game the hosts' way. Achraf Hakimi on loan from Real Madrid, got in the way of a Marco Reus run into the area, but the 19-year-old soon made amends by laying on the second goal with 17 minutes to go. The left-back got in behind his man and fired in a low cross that Reus missed, but Guerreiro stabbed past Oblak. At the other end, Burki only denied Atletico winger Angel Correa, on for Niguez, with the help of the post. Dortmund sealed the win when Hakimi did the damage again, charging into the area and teeing up Sancho to tap home their third goal on 83 minutes. And it turned into a rout when Guerreiro snapped up a loose pass from Felipe Luis and fired past Oblak with a minute remaining."
206,23/10/2018,14:39,Facing Atletico is like 'toothache' for Dortmund goal-ace Alcacer,Goal machine Paco Alcacer says playing against Atletico Madrid feels like 'toothache' -- and he hopes to extract maximum revenge for past suffering when Borussia Dortmund meet them in Wednesday's Champions League clash.,"The 26-year-old, on loan from Barcelona, has needed just 109 minutes to score seven Bundesliga goals this season -- the best goal-rate in the league's history, which included a deft chip in Saturday's 4-0 drubbing of Stuttgart to keep Dortmund top of the table. In total, Alcacer has netted 11 goals in his last seven games for club and country, but now has Atletico in his sights for the Group A showdown with both teams having won their first two games. ""A toothache to play against Atletico? Well, yes, totally,"" Alcacer told Spanish newspaper Marca, having lost six of his nine games against Atletico for either former clubs Getafe or Valencia. He never faced them while with Barcelona. ""They are a team that concede very few goals and they leave few spaces, while they're always very aware of everything. ""For a striker, it's frustrating."" However, his form has been anything but 'frustrating' since arriving in Dortmund in August after two unhappy seasons at Barcelona, where his path to the first-team was blocked by Luiz Suarez. Alcacer's goal exploits quickly wrote him into Dortmund's footballing folklore. ""The freedom is playing, having minutes and enjoying the profession. I didn't have the minutes at Barcelona and now I am having them, things are going well,"" he added. However, each goal he scores also carries a tragic reminder. When he scored at Stuttgart on Saturday, he raised his arms to celebrate, as does after each goal, and looked to the heavens with the words ""Always in my mind, Papa"" tattooed on his left bicep. Alcacer was still a teenager when his world was turned upside down on the first game of the 2011/12 season. His father Francisco died of a heart-attack while leaving the stadium after watching his son play in a friendly for former club Valencia against Roma. His father would no doubt be proud of what his son has achieved in just a few weeks at Dortmund, who have told Barcelona they want to sign him permanently, with his value estimated at around 30 million euros ($34.4m). Alcacer endeared himself to Dortmund fans by scoring on his debut off the bench against Eintracht Frankfurt in mid September. In his next game, he added two more, again as a sub, against Leverkusen. Then followed a stunning hat-trick in just 31 minutes as a second-half replacement against Augsburg on October 6, which included a stunning 96th-minute winner by banging in a superb free-kick just before the final whistle to seal a 4-3 comeback win. ""We had hoped that he would fit, but we hadn't dared hope that he would score like that,"" admitted Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc. On top of his Bundesliga goals, Alcacer also scored in the 3-0 win at home to Monaco at the start of the month, then claimed three goals in two games last week on his return to the Spain team after a two year hiatus. Now comes Atletico, led by their French goal-king Antoine Griezmann, and Alcacer could well be the source of an uncomfortable night for the Spanish team at Signal Iduna Park. ""It's clear that Atletico are a great team and a great club, a top club. But we need to make things difficult for them and go from there,"" said Alcacer."
207,22/10/2018,03:37,"Loud and clear: English teen stars Sancho, Nelson shine in Germany","They may be struggling with the language, but when it comes to playing football in Germany, English teenagers Jadon Sancho and Reiss Nelson are making themselves perfectly understood.","The 18-year-olds have both seized their chances in the Bundesliga and are expected to play key roles in the Champions League this week. Sancho joined Borussia Dortmund in August 2017, rejecting a contract extension at Manchester City, while Nelson is on loan at Hoffenheim from Arsenal. Both admit playing in a foreign country presents particular challenges, not least the German language. Sancho conducts his interviews in English but admits he's ""working on my German"" while Nelson has the advantage of having a German father. ""I've settled in well and I'm enjoying it. My dad is German too, from near Munich, so I knew what to expect and I'm learning the language with an app --it's going well,"" explained Nelson. He has plenty of family support in his new surroundings -- his mother, sister and brother all temporarily moved to Germany to help him settle in. ""Sinsheim is a little village where everyone loves football,"" he told the Daily Mail recently. Fresh from winning his first cap for England, Sancho opened the scoring for German league leaders Dortmund in Saturday's 4-0 thrashing of Stuttgart. Sancho should keep his place against Atletico Madrid for Wednesday's Group A showdown in the Champions League, but was quick to acknowledge the first-team opportunities Dortmund give him. ""Honestly, them giving me opportunities at such a young age, I just have to thank the club and all my family that have been behind me from the start,"" Sancho told Sky. ""I am really happy to be part of this team and just have to keep working hard in training."" Sancho has dazzled with six assists and two goals in the Bundesliga, forging a potent partnership with Germany star Marco Reus. Not to be outdone, Nelson netted with a volley, then claimed a superb second goal from a tight angle in Hoffenheim's 3-1 win at Nuremberg on Saturday. His performance suggests he will also play against Lyon on Tuesday. His Bundesliga brace capped a brilliant week for Nelson, who also scored with a free-kick for England Under-21s against Scotland after netting as a sub in a 7-0 thrashing of Andorra. The first-team exposure Sancho and Nelson are enjoying is payback for the gamble they took on the Bundesliga. Sancho recently extended his Dortmund contract until 2022, which has no release clause. ""It's going to be a big game for us,"" said Sancho before the Atletico clash with both Dortmund and Madrid having won their first two games. ""We'll give it our best."" Nelson and Sancho are just the latest English imports to German football after Ademola Lookman, 21, spent last season at RB Leipzig and Reece Oxford, 19, was at Borussia Moenchengladbach. In previous generations, the likes of Kevin Keegan, Owen Hargreaves, Mark Hughes, Paul Lambert and Tony Woodcock all enjoyed successful spells for British players in Germany. Nelson has four goals in four Bundesliga appearances having signed a five-year deal with Arsenal before heading on loan to Hoffenheim. ""A loan wasn't always my first option, but when I heard the Bundesliga and Hoffenheim was an option for me and working with the manager (Julian Nagelsmann) there, it was something I wanted to do,"" Nelson told The FA's website. ""Julian's a great manager and he's got belief in young players so it's a good place for me to go and play. ""It was hard to leave my boyhood club Arsenal, but I know I have to put that on hold and go and play abroad to get some experience in Germany."" Nelson's arrival in Sinsheim coincided with the end of Germany winger Serge Gnabry's loan from Bayern Munich. ""What he (Nelson) brings with his tempo and his one-on-one ability, we didn't have so much of that in the squad,"" said Nagelsmann. ""Reiss is a player whose qualities can be compared to those of Serge Gnabry, but just not so well developed."" Nelson arrived in Hoffenheim with glowing references. Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown says Nelson has ""the sort of touches you often see or associate with a Neymar or a real top player"". After Sancho made the step up to the senior English team, Nelson hopes to follow as England manager Gareth Southgate is clearly keeping an eye on Germany. ""Gareth has made it clear that the pathway is there so if you're young and you're good, he'll give you a chance,"" said Nelson. ""I'm trying to get in there and do my magic."" ryj-dj/jc <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org>"
208,06/10/2018,18:01,Alcacer hat-trick keeps Dortmund top after seven-goal thriller,Substitute Paco Alcacer claimed a stunning hat-trick as his superb 96th-minute free-kick kept Borussia Dortmund top of the Bundesliga after a dramatic 4-3 win over Augsburg on Saturday.,"Having already scored two late goals off the bench in last Saturday's 4-2 comeback victory at Bayer Leverkusen, and netted again in the 3-0 Champions League win over Monaco on Wednesday, the 25-year-old Alcacer, on loan from Barcelona, again proved deadly off the bench. In front of 81,365 fans at Signal Iduna Park, Dortmund slipped 1-0 down after Alfred Finnbogason's first-half goal. But Alcacer equalised in the 62nd minute, just three minutes after coming on, with the Spain international smashing home a cross by teenage winger Jadon Sancho, who was called up by England on Thursday for the first time. Philipp Max restored Augsburg's lead by taking advantage of some poor Dortmund defending, only for Alcacer to claim his second equaliser on 80 minutes when he fired in off the post. Dortmund led for the first time on 84 minutes when midfielder Mario Goetze, another second-half replacement, latched onto a great through ball and fired home on his first Bundesliga appearance this season. The game swung again as Augsburg equalised when Michael Gregoritsch headed home a Max cross to make it 3-3 with just three minutes left. However, the stage was set for Alcacer to seal the three points after Augsburg's Sergio Cordova gave away a free-kick. The stunning win means Niko Kovac's Bayern Munich, who trail Dortmund by four points down in fourth, cannot regain top spot even if they later beat Borussia Moenchengladbach at the Allianz Arena. Elsewhere, Hertha Berlin missed the chance to claim second from Werder Bremen, who won 2-0 at Wolfsburg on Friday, as they were held to a goalless draw at Mainz. Hertha captain Vedad Ibisevic missed a great chance when he hit the Mainz woodwork with a first-half chance. After losing their first five games, Schalke continue their rise up the table with a 2-0 win at Fortuna Duesseldorf. US international Weston McKennie who scored in their 1-0 Champions League win at Lokomotiv Moscow in midweek, and Guido Burgstaller grabbed Schalke's goals to put them 14th. US striker Bobby Wood scored with two perfectly-timed headers as Hanover 96 picked up their first win of the season with a 3-1 home win against Stuttgart. Wood gave Hanover the lead when he guided a header inside the far post after 30 minutes. The 25-year-old added a second just before the break with another bullet header, expertly guided past Stuttgart's goalkeeper. Former Germany striker Mario Gomez, with a bandaged head after a first-half clash, scored Stuttgart's consolation goal soon after the break before Hanover's Togo striker Ihlas Bebou added their third in the 91st minute."
209,04/10/2018,00:21,"Messi, Barcelona outgun Spurs as Neymar bags hat-trick","Lionel Messi struck twice as Barcelona inflicted more Champions League pain on Tottenham with a 4-2 win at Wembley on Wednesday, while Neymar hit a brilliant hat-trick in Paris Saint-Germain's 6-1 rout of Red Star Belgrade.","Philippe Coutinho scored after just two minutes for Barcelona, who arrived in London winless in three La Liga matches, with Ivan Rakitic drilling in a magnificent second. Messi, who had earlier twice hit the post, then got on the scoresheet in between goals from Harry Kane and Erik Lamela, before the Argentina superstar grabbed his second late on to seal victory. ""After a few bad results it was important to do well today. Our response was very good,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde. Barca head Group B on six points alongside Inter Milan, but Mauricio Pochettino's side face a vital double-header against PSV Eindhoven after failing to collect a point from their opening two matches. The Tottenham boss admitted Spurs had few answers for Messi as his team was left with an uphill struggle to reach the knockout stages. ""He's a fantastic player,"" said Pochettino. ""His average performance is this type of game. He's always above everything."" Inter, the last Italian club to win the Champions League in 2010, again recovered from a goal down to beat PSV 2-1 in the Netherlands. A cracking Pablo Rosario strike put PSV ahead, but Inter levelled through Radja Nainggolan moments after visiting goalkeeper Samir Handanovic somehow escaped a red card for handling outside his area. Mauro Icardi, whose late goal stunned Spurs a fortnight ago, was the hero again for Luciano Spalletti's men as he pounced on hesitant defending to net the winner on the hour. PSG rebounded from their 3-2 defeat by Liverpool with an attacking masterclass against 1991 European Cup winners Red Star at the Parc des Princes. Neymar curled in a sublime free-kick to open the scoring on 20 minutes, quickly doubling his tally before Edinson Cavani, Angel di Maria and Kylian Mbappe also found the target. Former Germany international Marko Marin popped up with a consolation for Red Star, with Neymar completing his hat-trick from another stunning free-kick. ""I really liked the effort made by the whole team, but Neymar was sensational,"" said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel. ""He is one of the best players in Europe and that is very, very important for us."" Carlo Ancelotti's Napoli top Group C on four points after Lorenzo Insigne delivered a 90th-minute winner at home to Liverpool, who are level on three alongside PSG. Dries Mertens hit the bar for Napoli late on, but there was still time for Insigne to nick all three points at the death as he slid to poke in a cross from Jose Callejon. ""Tonight we showed this group won't just be hard for Napoli, but for everyone involved,"" said Ancelotti. ""It means a lot to us to have won against the finalists from last year."" Antoine Griezmann scored two goals to lift Atletico Madrid, last season's Europa League winners, to a 3-1 victory over Club Brugge in Spain. Arnaut Groeneveld cancelled out Griezmann's opener with a thunderous strike from the left wing, but the France international restored Atletico's lead before Koke made the points safe in stoppage time. ""I said it last season and I'll say it again -- Griezmann is the best player in the world,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone. Borussia Dortmund lead Atletico at the top of Group A on goal difference following their 3-0 defeat of a struggling Monaco outfit. Jacob Bruun Larsen broke the deadlock in Germany shortly after his introduction as a half-time substitute, with Paco Alcacer finding the net just minutes after smacking a penalty against the bar. Marco Reus fired in a third from a Bruun Larsen cross, leaving Dortmund and Atletico on six points apiece ahead of their upcoming home-and-away meetings. In Group D, American international midfielder Weston McKennie hit an 88th-minute winner as struggling Schalke edged Lokomotiv Moscow 1-0. Porto are joint-top with Schalke following a 1-0 win over Galatasaray courtesy of Moussa Marega's second-half goal in Portugal."
210,03/10/2018,23:41,Alcacer scores again as Dortmund ease past Monaco,Paco Alcacer continued his excellent start to life at Borussia Dortmund as the Bundesliga side saw off Monaco 3-0 on Wednesday to claim a second straight Champions League win.,"Half-time substitute Jacob-Bruun Larsen gave Dortmund the lead at Signal Iduna Park, less than six minutes into his Champions League debut. On-loan Barcelona striker Alcacer secured the points in the 72nd minute shortly after missing a penalty, before Larsen teed up Marco Reus to score his sixth goal of the season late on. Dortmund top the early Group A standings from Atletico Madrid on goal difference, after the Spanish side's 3-1 victory over Club Brugge at the Wanda Metropolitano. ""Overall, it was well deserved, the second half was much better than the first,"" Dortmund coach Lucien Favre told German television. ""We were better at pressing and winning the ball, which gave us confidence."" Leonardo Jardim's Monaco slip to the foot of the table as their miserable start to the season continued -- the principality side have also won just one of their first eight league games of the campaign and sit in the Ligue 1 relegation play-off place. It was the first match between Dortmund and Monaco since their Champions League quarter-final 18 months ago, when the Germans' team bus was the target of a bombing on the way to the first leg at Signal Iduna Park. ""I thought I was done with this story,"" said Dortmund 'keeper Roman Buerki. ""But on the bus tonight, I was relieved when we passed the place (where the attack happened)."" The best chance of the first half fell to the hosts just seconds before the interval, but Diego Benaglio was quick to dive to his right and turn Marius Wolf's low shot past the post. But Monaco goalkeeper Benaglio was injured in making the save, and had to be replaced by Danijel Subasic. Favre threw on Dane Larsen at half-time in place of Wolf, and the decision paid off in the 51st minute. English teenager Jadon Sancho was the creator, showing great vision to slip a perfect pass into the path of Danish youngster Larsen, who took a touch and drilled home. The Bundesliga outfit were gifted an opportunity to double their advantage with 21 minutes to play as Reus tumbled to the ground under a clumsy tackle by centre-back Kamil Glik. Alcacer, making his full debut for Dortmund, contrived to rattle the crossbar, though, as he attempted to lash the spot-kick down the middle. But the Spanish international quickly made up for the miss, skipping clear of goalkeeper Subasic and firing into the net to score his fourth goal for the club in just three appearances. And the 20-year-old Larsen did well to get free down the left-hand side in injury-time, and crossed low for Reus to slot into the corner at the back post."
211,02/10/2018,18:32,"With shades of Neymar, English teen Sancho becomes 'weapon' for Dortmund","Jadon Sancho hopes his reputation for being a ""weapon"" off the bench for Borussia Dortmund will win the England Under-19 international a starting berth against Monaco in the Champions League on Wednesday.","The 18-year-old wants a place in Lucien Favre's line-up after once more proving his worth on Saturday, when he helped seal a 4-2 comeback Bundesliga win at Bayer Leverkusen with two devastating assists. He set up Marco Reus for the equaliser at the BayArena a minute after coming on, then sent Paco Alcacer away on a counter-attack for the second of the Spaniard's two late goals as Dortmund went top of the table. He has appeared as a substitute in each of Dortmund's six Bundesliga outings this season, but he did start in their opening Champions League game, when they won 1-0 at Club Brugge to get off to the perfect start in Group A. Sancho now craves a regular starting berth after providing six assists as well as one goal in the Bundesliga, although he admits he is at his best running at tiring defences as a substitute. ""I just had a bit more energy,"" the junior England international, who joined last year from Manchester City, told Bundesliga.com of his stunning display at Leverkusen. ""The rest were a bit tired and I came on to help. The coach keeps rotating so that's how strong this team is. ""Obviously, I don't want to be a sub, but if I keep on working hard, hopefully I can get in the starting team."" Having seen what the English teenager can do, Dortmund announced on Tuesday that Sancho has signed a two-year extension to his contract, until 2022. His tally of six Bundesliga assists makes him the top goal provider in all of Europe's top five leagues so far this season. Sancho was still just 17 when he opted to try his luck in the Bundesliga after being omitted from City's pre-season tour in July 2017, and Pep Guardiola's loss has been Dortmund's gain. ""I'm very glad that I decided to move to Dortmund, because everything turned out to be true: this city lives football like no other, and young players here are given game time,"" said Sancho. His potential is huge. Dan Micciche, Sancho's former England Under-16 coach, compared the left winger to a young version of Brazil superstar Neymar. ""He could be our Neymar-type player -- in terms of being unpredictable,"" Micciche told The Guardian last month. ""He's flamboyant, entertaining to watch, but like Neymar he's effective with it."" Sancho is getting game time in a bumper Dortmund squad where even Mario Goetze, whose goal won the 2014 World Cup final for Germany, is struggling to be picked. Favre is carefully easing the slightly-built Sancho into the physically demanding Bundesliga, where he has yet to play more than 32 minutes of any one league game this season. Likewise, Dortmund are shielding him off the pitch and rarely grant reporters interviews with the English teenager. Nevertheless, Sancho is certainly making his chances count. He created a goal for Germany midfielder Julian Weigl and scored one himself in just 16 minutes off the bench in the 7-0 thumping of Nuremberg last Wednesday. Sancho also set captain Marco Reus up for his late goal in the 4-1 win over RB Leipzig in Dortmund's opening game of the season, and the young winger said he is learning plenty from the Germany star. ""We just have that special connection,"" said Sancho. ""He reads me, I read him, and he teaches me a lot of things, like to be mature on the ball. ""At first I wasn't mature but he told me to be calm and just play my game, and that helped me a lot. ""Obviously, he's a great player and I'm so happy I'm playing with him."" The feeling is mutual. ""When our opponents ease off a little and Jadon comes into the game, he's a weapon for us every single time,"" Reus said after the thrashing of Nuremberg. ""We're happy to have him up our sleeve and he always gives us a boost."""
212,29/09/2018,21:17,Dortmund go top as Alcacer brace seals stunning fight-back,New signing Paco Alcacer came off the bench to score two late goals and seal Borussia Dortmund's stunning 4-2 win as they fought back from two goals down at Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday to knock Bayern Munich from top spot in the Bundesliga.,"Alcacer, on loan from Barcelona until June, came on after 63 minutes with his team 2-0 down, but tucked away goals on 85 and 94 minutes to cap the fight back after Dortmund had drawn level. After Bayern crashed to a shock 2-0 defeat at Hertha Berlin on Friday, Dortmund left it late to top the table in dramatic style and build on their 7-0 rout of Nuremberg on Wednesday. Leverkusen went ahead at their BayArena after just nine minutes when midfielder Mitchell Weiser hit the net with a spectacular shot from outside the area -- reminiscent of Benjamin Pavard's goal of the 2018 World Cup for France. Burly defender Jonathan Tah doubled Leverkusen's lead by tapping home six minutes from the break. Dortmund drew level with two goals in four minutes. Danish midfielder Jacob Bruun Larsen, 20, drilled home the first on 64 minutes. England junior international Jadon Sancho came off the Dortmund bench and a minute later provided the final pass for Dortmund captain Marco Reus to smash home a second on 68 minutes. Dortmund went ahead for the first time on 85 minutes when Alcacer lunged to guide a cross by defender Achraf Hakimi, on loan from Real Madrid, into the Leverkusen net. Alcacer completed the Roy of the Rovers-style finish on 94 minutes. He tapped into an empty net after Dortmund attacked from their own box with Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky well out of his own penalty area as the hosts pushed for an unlikely late equaliser. Dortmund are the only unbeaten team in Germany's top flight after Werder Bremen earlier blew the chance to knock Bayern from top spot by losing 2-1 at Stuttgart, even though the host's goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler conceded a howler of an own goal. Bremen made a bad start when Greece striker Anastasios Donis dribbled through the visitors' defence and chipped into an open net on 19 minutes. Then Bremen had key defender Milos Veljkovic sent off eight minutes from half time for pulling back Daniel Didavi, his second foul on the Stuttgart striker. But then Zieler's blunder gave Werder an equaliser. The 29-year-old, a 2014 World Cup winner, took his eye off the ball when defender Borna Sosa aimed a throw-in his way and, after he got a faint touch, watched in horror as the ball rolled into his net on 68 minutes. Gonzalo Castro restored Stuttgart's lead 15 minutes from time. Bremen had chances as midfielder Maximilian Eggestein and veteran striker Claudio Pizarro, who turns 40 on Wednesday and made his 450th Bundesliga appearance, hit the post. Elsewhere, Julian Nagelsmann's Hoffenheim, who host Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday, suffered a 2-1 home defeat to RB Leipzig, who Nagelsmann will coach next season. Denmark forward Yussuf Poulsen scored both of Leipzig's goals before Andrej Kramaric netted a late Hoffenheim penalty. Borussia Moenchengladbach went fourth despite being held to a 2-2 draw at Wolfsburg, where they have not won for 15 years, as goals by Gladbach's Alassane Plea and Thorgan Hazard were cancelled out by Wolfsburg's Renato Steffen and Wout Weghorst. Schalke, last season's runners up, climbed off the bottom of the table with a 1-0 win at Mainz when Austria midfielder Alessandro Schoepf headed the only goal after only 11 minutes. The home win eases the pressure on head coach Domenico Tedesco as Schalke ended their run of five straight defeats to lift them to 17th, but they can drop down again if Hanover win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday. Nuremberg won the battle of the teams promoted last season when they romped to a 3-0 win over Fortuna Duesseldorf thanks to goals by Hanno Behrens, Mikael Ishak and Federico Palacios."

Jacob Bruun Larsen's stylish finish gave Dortmund the lead early on, the Danish striker latching onto Christian Pulisic's through ball and lofting the ball over Fabian Bredlow in the Nuremberg goal. With Dortmund in complete control, Marco Reus doubled the lead on 32 minutes, as his long range effort was deflected past a helpless Bredlow. Hakimi's moment came just after half-time, as he rounded off a Dortmund counter attack by blasting the ball into the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Reus added another a few minutes later, and Manuel Akanji picked up his first ever Bundesliga goal before substitutes Jadon Sancho and Julian Weigl completed the rout. ""We put pressure on them from the very first minute, did our job at the back and took our chances,"" Akanji told the official club TV channel. ""It was a great feeling to score my first goal for the club."" Borussia Moenchengladbach, meanwhile, are among those chasing Dortmund after they battled to a 3-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt to go fourth. Gladbach forced several saves from Kevin Trapp in the first half before Alassane Plea finally broke through in the 56th minute, the Frenchman rifling the ball in from a tight angle to grab his sixth goal in all competitions. Thorgan Hazard doubled the lead with a sweetly struck finish ten minutes later, and though Ante Rebic's goal gave Frankfurt a flicker of hope, it was extinguished by Nico Elvedi's 85th minute header. Elsewhere, RB Leipzig battled to a 2-0 win over Stuttgart, while Wolfsburg were held to a goalless draw in Mainz. Captain Willi Orban put Leipzig in front on the stroke of half-time, tapping in the rebound after Kevin Kampl had forced a save from Ron-Robert Zieler. Timo Werner had a goal ruled out by VAR in the second half before Jean Kevin Augustin whipped in Leipzig's second to seal the win. Wolfsburg failed to take advantage of a comedy of defensive errors from Mainz. Twice gifted possession in the first half, Josip Brekalo first struck the post on 23 minutes, and then fired the ball straight at Mainz goalkeeper Florian Mueller. Earlier, two goals from Kevin Volland saw Bayer Leverkusen continue their recovery with a 2-1 win at Fortuna Duesseldorf. After a breaking the deadlock with a tap-in after half-time, Volland nodded in Kai Havertz's elegant cross to double the lead, and Rouwen Hennings late penalty was not enough to prevent a second win in a row for Leverkusen."

It was a huge slice of good fortune but one that ended Dortmund's 10-match winless streak in the Champions League. ""In the end we won, but there is definitely room for improvement,"" admitted Dortmund captain Marco Reus. ""We have to keep working hard to play better. ""Currently, we are not playing the kind of football we want to, but we are winning and we'll take that."" While Pulisic spared Dortmund's blushes in Belgium on his 100th appearance for the club, it was a bad night for Mario Goetze. The struggling Germany international made a rare start after being an unused substitute in the first three Bundesliga this season, but endured a frustrating hour in an attacking midfield role. Goetze is a pale shadow of the player who hit the winner in the 2014 World Cup final and was hauled off midway through the second half after making little impact. Having been left out of Germany's World Cup squad for Russia, the 26-year-old is a long way from the player who helped Dortmund win back-to-back Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012. However, Dortmund were delighted to win away after failing to win any of their six group stage games last season. This was their first win in Europe since reaching the quarter-finals in 2016/17, but they will need to improve at home to Monaco in their second Group A game in a fortnight. Thanks mainly to their goalkeeper Roman Burki, Dortmund were lucky to go into the break with the score goalless as Brugge, last season's Belgian league champions, wasted clear chances. Dortmund skipper Reus came to the rescue by deflecting a shot by Brugge striker Jelle Vossen after 20 minutes. Dortmund were more aggressive after the break as head coach Lucien Favre brought on Shinji Kagawa with an hour gone, finally losing patience with Goetze. Pulisic, who came on for England youth international Jadon Sancho, eventually broke the deadlock after he was thrown on for the final 20 minutes. The all-action American gave away a free-kick before popping up with the winner to get Dortmund off to a victorious start in Europe."

Along with Schalke and RB Leipzig, Leverkusen are one of several big teams who are hoping to bounce back from a disastrous start to the campaign. Elsewhere, Barcelona loanee Paco Alcacer is set to make his Borussia Dortmund debut against Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday, while Saturday will see the Bundesliga's oldest and youngest coaches go head to head in Duesseldorf. Here are five things to look out for in this weekend's Bundesliga action: Amid rumours of a move away from Munich and an early World Cup exit with Poland, it had been a turbulent summer for Robert Lewandowski. Yet Bayern's star striker is now back to his best, having scored in both Bundesliga games so far this season. He will be looking to continue that run when his side host Bayer Leverkusen, in what will be his 200th appearance for the Bavarian giants. Leverkusen, meanwhile, are hoping to avoid their worst ever start to a Bundesliga season after they lost their opening two games. ""Bayern are the best in the business but we have to go there and seek out chances,"" under pressure Leverkusen coach Heiko Herrlich told SID, an AFP subsidiary. Paco Alcacer is hoping to make his first appearance for Borussia Dortmund this weekend after arriving on loan from Barcelona. Dortmund hope that the former Valencia hitman can be the solution to their problems in the centre-forward position, and fans may see him in action for the first time in Friday's clash with Eintracht Frankfurt. ""Paco links up with team-mates well and is very skillful in front of goal,"" said Dortmund coach Lucien Favre. Dortmund will be without USA international Christian Pulisic, who is still struggling with a muscular issue. Schalke kick off their Champions League campaign next week, having finished second under precocious young coach Domenico Tedesco last season. Yet after two defeats from two this term, Tedesco is now under huge pressure ahead of Saturday's headline clash with Borussia Moenchengladbach. ""I'm not naive, and I'm not going to rest on my laurels and expect only to be given credit for last season,"" the Schalke coach told SportBild this week. RB Leipzig have also made a wobbly start to their Bundesliga campaign, and coach Ralf Rangnick will be hoping that his ""wheel of misfortune"" can turn his team's luck around. Leipzig have picked up just one point from their opening two games, and host a well-disciplined Hanover side on Saturday. As Bild revealed this week, Leipzig players no longer receive fines for indiscretions, but instead have to spin the wheel of misfortune. The wheel can land on any of 12 different punishments, ranging from groundskeeping duties and shifts in the club fan shop to being forced to wear a ballerina's tutu in training. The Bundesliga's oldest coach will meet its youngest when Fortuna Duesseldorf host Hoffenheim on Saturday. Friedhelm Funkel, 64, is hoping to avoid relegation with Duesseldorf this year, while 31-year-old Julian Nagelsmann will lead Hoffenheim into the Champions League next week. ""Thankfully, it's going to be eleven players against eleven players on Saturday,"" Funkel joked. ""If I had to play one-on-one against Julian, I wouldn't stand a chance!"" Fixtures (all times GMT)"
217,31/08/2018,22:46,Dortmund held on way to first scoreless draw of Bundesliga season,Borussia Dortmund twice hit the woodwork but couldn't find a winner on Friday as they were forced to share the points with Hanover 96 in the first goalless Bundesliga draw of the season.,"After an opening 25 minutes largely contested in midfield, Maximilian Philipp had the ball in the net, only for it to be correctly ruled out after Marius Wolf was spotted offside. Towards the end of an even first half, Dortmund burst into life. Marco Reus saw an effort headed for the far corner pushed wide by Hanover goalkeeper Michael Esser's outstretched toe, and less than a minute later, Reus rattled the bar after a superb pass by Mahmoud Dahoud. ""I had to score one of them,"" Marco Reus told Eurosport afterwards. ""I can only apologise to my teammates."" Although Hanover's only attack of note ended with teenage winger Linton Maina's shot being blocked, the home side had been strong defensively. In the second half, more of the same followed as Dortmund were kept at bay by a disciplined and well positioned Hanover side. Maximilian Philipp nearly found an opening when he sent a header goalwards, but the forward was left disappointed when his header clipped the post and hurt after clashing heads with Hanover captain Waldemar Anton in the process. Anton nearly turned hero at the other end as well, having been found in the box from a corner, but he flashed his effort narrowly wide. American striker Bobby Wood, making his Bundesliga debut for Hanover, stumbled before he could get his shot away. For Dortmund, the result was in stark contrast to the storming 4-1 win over RB Leipzig on the opening weekend and Lucien Favre's side will be hoping to fare better when they host Eintracht Frankfurt after the international break."
218,31/08/2018,17:25,Record-breaker Sahin quits Dortmund for Werder Bremen,"Bundesliga record-breaker Nuri Sahin signed for Werder Bremen on Friday, just before the transfer window closed in Germany, after being frustrated by a lack of chances this season at Borussia Dortmund.","Sahin, who turns 30 on Wednesday, won the 2010-11 Bundesliga title with Dortmund and has reportedly signed a two-year deal with Bremen for an undisclosed sum. He made 274 appearances for Borussia, scoring 26 goals with 49 assists in 11 seasons, having joined Dortmund as a schoolboy in 2001. In 2005, Sahin became the youngest player to make his Bundesliga debut, aged just 16 years, 334 days, a record that still stands. ""We are glad that we were able to convince a player of this quality to come to Werder,"" said sports director Frank Baumann. The midfielder was not in the plans of new head coach Lucien Favre, who left him out for Sunday's 4-1 home win over RB Leipzig, and Sahin was released with a year left on his Dortmund contract. With 51 international appearances for Turkey, Sahin comes with a wealth of experience having also had spells at Liverpool and Real Madrid, who he joined from Dortmund in 2011 before returning to Borussia in 2014. ""I don't think there is much to say about the qualities of Nuri, he has experienced almost everything in the Bundesliga, won the German league, and played for Real Madrid and Liverpool,"" said Bremen head coach Florian Kohfeldt. ""He has the potential to take us even further and allows us more options."" Sahin's arrival in Bremen is too late for him to be included for Saturday's away game at Eintracht Frankfurt. Bremen, who drew 1-1 with Hanover 96 in their opening game of the 2018/19 Bundesliga season, have aspirations to finish in the European places in May. They signed Dutch midfielder Davy Klaassen from Everton for a reported club record of 14 million euros ($16.3m) last month."
219,20/05/2018,12:09,Coach Favre to quit Nice amid Dortmund rumours,"French coach Lucien Favre said he is leaving Ligue 1 club Nice after his side lost their final match of the season at Lyon on Saturday, amid speculation of a move to Borussia Dortmund.","German media have been reporting in recent weeks that the 60-year-old is set to return to the Bundesliga with Dortmund, having previously taken Borussia Moenchengladbach to the Champions League during a four-year spell in charge from 2011. ""It was necessary to work to stabilise Nice in the top eight (in France), in 2013 the club was 17th,"" he said. ""I will leave Nice and France. But I cannot say any more."" Favre, who also worked in Germany with Hertha Berlin from 2007-2009, led Nice to a third-placed finish last season, although they lost in the Champions League playoff round to Napoli last August. But this term a poor start to their league campaign proved costly, as Saturday's 3-2 loss at Lyon ensured they finished eighth and missed out on European football altogether."
220,19/05/2018,19:59,Hitz signs for Dortmund,Goalkeeper Marwin Hitz joined Borussia Dortmund on a free transfer on Saturday having made himself unavailable for the World Cup finals with Switzerland.,"Hitz was out of contract at Augsburg and will rival fellow Swiss Roman Buerki to play in goal for Dortmund, who qualified for the Champions League by finishing fourth in the Bundesliga. ""I wanted to experience something different,"" said Hitz, who has signed a contract until 2021. ""I'm looking forward to the challenge of playing at such a big club and especially the Champions League games."" Hitz will replace retired veteran Roman Weidenfeller, a 2014 World Cup winner with Germany, while Burki started 33 of Dortmund's 34 Bundesliga games this season. On Friday, the Swiss FA announced Hitz, 30, had made himself unavailable to coach Vladimir Petkovic for the World Cup finals in Russia, without giving any reasons. Having made more than 150 Bundesliga appearances for Augsburg and VfL Wolfsburg, Hitz had been expected to travel to Russia alongside Buerki and Borussia Moenchengladbach's Swiss keeper Yann Sommer. The Swiss open their World Cup campaign against Brazil in Rostov on June 17 and will also face Serbia and Costa Rica in Group E."
221,12/05/2018,19:03,Stoeger steps down as Dortmund coach,"Peter Stoeger announced Saturday he was stepping down as Borussia Dortmund coach, after leading the Bundesliga club to a Champions League place.","""That was my last competitive game in charge of Dortmund,"" Stoeger told the media after his side's 3-1 defeat to Hoffenheim on Saturday. The decision, he continued, had been made ""some time ago"", together with the club hierarchy. ""A new impulse with a new coach will be good for the club,"" said Stoeger. Stoeger took over from Peter Bosz last December, and was tasked with guiding Dortmund to a top-four finish and a place in the Champions League. He completed the task on Saturday, as Dortmund finished fourth despite defeat to Hoffenheim. OGC Nice manager and former Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Lucien Favre is the favourite to succeed Stoeger."
222,04/05/2018,02:10,Hamburg adopt knock-out mentality for survival fight,"Midfielder Lewis Holtby says Hamburg must treat Saturday's match at Eintracht Frankfurt as ""a cup semi-final"" if they want to avoid a historic first relegation from the Bundesliga.","Second-bottom Hamburg are five points from safety with two league games left -- at Eintracht Frankfurt and then at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach -- as they bid to avoid slipping out of the top flight for the first time. But they sit just two points behind Wolfsburg, who occupy 16th place, which provides the solace of a relegation play-off against the team who finish third in the second tier. Holtby says, from a Hamburg perspective, those remaining games against clubs fighting for European places next season are effectively knock-out matches. ""This is our 'semi-final',"" said Holtby, who has scored four goals in Hamburg's last five games to breathe life into their survival hopes. ""We aren't dead yet. I believe 100 percent that we can rescue things."" Hamburg are the only club to have played in every season since the Bundesliga was established in 1963 -- when even mighty Bayern Munich were still a second-division club. A seven-point gap at the start of April has been slashed by wins over fellow strugglers Freiburg, 1-0 at home a fortnight ago, and Wolfsburg, 3-1 away last Saturday. Three wins in their last four games have given belief to Hamburg's players and fans alike, but they need Wolfsburg to drop more points. Moreover, they are facing a Frankfurt side eager to bounce back from a 4-1 mauling at champions Bayern Munich, which followed a 3-0 home defeat by Hertha Berlin. ""We have not achieved anything yet, if we want to get over the line, then we need further victories,"" said Christian Titz, Hamburg's third coach since January. Hamburg have fallen on hard times in recent seasons, needing to win the relegation play-off in both 2013/14 and 2014/15 to stay up. This season has been a disaster. Hamburg were second from bottom with 15 points from 19 games when Markus Gisdol was sacked as head coach in late January. Former player Bernd Hollerbach took over, but was soon dismissed after failing to win any of his seven games, admitting ""we need a miracle"". Titz was promoted from the reserves and the 47-year-old has coaxed three wins from his six games to turn the corner. ""We are playing a totally different style of football, the coach has his own ideas and sticks to them,"" enthused midfielder Aaron Hunt. Hamburg need Wolfsburg to slip up either this Saturday at RB Leipzig, who are winless in their last five games and fighting to keep a Europa League place, or at home to Cologne, who are already relegated. Having already had their relegation confirmed last weekend, bottom side Cologne host champions Bayern Munich, who are licking their wounds after their agonising Champions League exit in midweek. Bayern, who sealed a sixth straight league title last month, hold a massive 24-point lead in the table. Coach Jupp Heynckes is sure to rotate after they drew 2-2 at Real Madrid on Wednesday to lose their Champions League semi-final 4-3 on aggregate. Saturday's fixtures (all 1330 GMT) Borussia Dortmund v Mainz, RB Leipzig v Wolfsburg, Cologne v Bayern Munich, Werder Bremen v Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Moenchengladbach v Freiburg, Eintracht Frankfurt v Hamburg, Augsburg v Schalke, Hanover 96 v Hertha Berlin, Stuttgart v Hoffenheim"
223,18/04/2018,15:46,Germany's Ginter mulled quitting football after bomb attack,World Cup winner Matthias Ginter told a German court on Wednesday that he considered quitting football in the wake of last year's bomb attack on the Borussia Dortmund team bus.,"""We are always exposed to a great risk,"" said Ginter, clearly still carrying the effects of the April 11, 2017 attack. ""I have also thought about whether it is still worthwhile to take this risk again and again. ""Nothing is 100 percent secure, that's why I did not want to give up something which is fun."" Ginter, 24, was testifying in the trial of German-Russian Sergei Wenergold, who has admitted to detonating explosions in an elaborate bid to make a fortune on the stock market. He wanted to cash in on so-called put options, essentially bets on a falling share price. The 28-year-old electrical technician faces 28 counts of attempted murder as well as setting off explosions and causing serious bodily harm. A tearful Ginter broke down in court in Dortmund while testifying. He was describing the moment the blasts hit the team bus on the way to their Champions League quarter-final, first leg at home to Monaco. The attack left his then team-mate Marc Bartra, who now plays for Real Betis, with a fractured wrist. ""Shortly before we left for the match, I was talking to Marc Bartra,"" Ginter told the court. ""He knew the left-back from Monaco and gave me some tips. ""I sat in the left rear (of the bus). Then there was a loud bang."" Ginter stopped abruptly to cover his face as he sobbed and needed several minutes to compose himself. ""Everyone was lying on the floor (of the bus). Splinters flew in. There was smoke inside. Marc cried out. We did not know what was going to happen next,"" he said. The triple blast last April 11 shattered the team bus's windows, with a police officer also suffering inner ear damage. Prosecutors say the three fragmentation bombs each contained up to a kilogramme (2.2 pounds) of a hydrogen peroxide mixture and around 65 cigarette-sized metal bolts. One of them ended up lodged in Bartra's headrest. Despite the traumatic experience, the home Champions League clash was played the day after the attack. A shell-shocked Dortmund team, clearly still struggling to process the dramatic events, lost the home leg 3-2 and then 3-1 away to Monaco the following week. Ginter revealed tears of relief were shed in the Dortmund dressing room following the home defeat, less than 24 hours after the attack. ""We cried in the dressing room and were glad it was over,"" he admitted. Ginter, who now plays for Borussia Moenchengladbach and won the 2014 World Cup with Germany, says he is still traumatised. ""When there is a loud bang at big events, I always eye people with backpacks,"" he said, ""While walking, I look for slow-moving trucks and I prefer to change to the other side of the street."""
224,16/04/2018,17:15,Batshuayi could miss World Cup after ankle injury,Borussia Dortmund striker Michy Batshuayi is set to miss the rest of the season -- and possibly the World Cup -- after injuring his ankle during a defeat by Schalke at the weekend.,"""Well, it's not good news for now, my season is probably over and I won't be able to pay Dortmund back for their confidence,"" Batshuayi, who joined the Bundesliga club on loan from Chelsea in January, wrote on Twitter. ""Wishing my teammates the best for the final days."" Batshuayi injured his left ankle late in Dortmund's 2-0 defeat at Schalke on Sunday and left the stadium in Gelsenkirchen on crutches. Dortmund, who have four league games left, put out a statement on Monday saying Batshuayi is ""probably"" out for the rest of the season. However, the club added he could ""possibly"" still play for Belgium at the World Cup in Russia which runs from June 14 to July 15. If Sunday's defeat proves to be his last Dortmund game, then it is a sad exit for Batshuayi who is on loan until June. The 24-year-old scored nine goals in 14 games, including seven in the Bundesliga, after arriving at Dortmund as a replacement for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. His injury would leave Dortmund short of an experienced goalscorer. Despite their defeat at Schalke, Dortmund are fourth in the table -- which carries a Champions League place for next season -- and have a four-point cushion over RB Leipzig."
225,13/04/2018,02:07,Dortmund out to settle score in derby duel at Schalke,Borussia Dortmund head to neighbours Schalke for Sunday's high-profile Bundesliga clash still smarting after their arch rivals came from four-goals down last time in the 'Ruhr derby of the century'.,"""We are really up for it, especially when you remember the home game,"" said Dortmund's sports director Michael Zorc before the 174th derby in Gelsenkirchen. Dortmund are still sore after Schalke scored four unanswered second-half goals in a frenetic 4-4 draw at Borussia's Signal Iduna Park last November. Brazil defender Naldo dramatically equalised with a 94th-minute header just before the final whistle to cap a remarkable fight back. ""If the game had gone on a minute longer, we would have probably conceded the next goal,"" admitted goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller after Dortmund's defence collapsed. ""I was glad when the referee whistled, it was a relief for us. I came off feeling ashamed."" The match was dubbed the 'Ruhr derby of the century' because no team had ever previously came from 4-0 down in the fixture's 92-year history. Bragging rights aside, key Bundesliga points are up for grabs in Sunday's derby. Bayern Munich, the confirmed champions, are 20 points clear of Schalke in the table, but Dortmund are a point behind in third. They can leap-frog the Royal Blues into second place with a win in Gelsenkirchen. Schalke took second-place from Dortmund just over a month ago and tensions are running high between the clubs. Only 36 kilometres (22 miles) separate them and police in Gelsenkirchen are on high alert with no love lost in one of European football's fiercest derbies. ""This isn't just a game like any other -- you can feel the tension,"" said Schalke striker Guido Burgstaller. For Dortmund, the goal is simple, ""if we win, we move past Schalke"" said midfielder Nuri Sahin. The top game on Saturday sees Bayern host Borussia Moenchengladbach at the Allianz Arena with one eye on next Tuesday's German Cup semi-final at Leverkusen. Having reached the Champions League semi-finals in mid-week, Bayern are now the only European team left still in contention for the treble this season. Head coach Jupp Heynckes is likely to rotate his squad against Gladbach. Bayern are waiting to see how Javi Martinez recovers from a bruised his knee. James Rodriguez also hurt his thigh in Wednesday's draw at home to Sevillla which put Bayern into the last four in Europe. Behind Bayern, Schalke have the second best defence in the league, conceding 33 goals to Munich's 21. The Royal Blues' back four will be tested by Michy Batshuayi, who has scored seven goals in nine league games since joining Dortmund on loan from Chelsea. Borussia hope to have Marco Reus running their attack with the Germany star having scored six goals in 12 games against Schalke. The Royal Blues are smarting from last weekend's shock 3-2 defeat at Hamburg, who moved off the bottom of the table with their first league win since November. Dortmund have had the better of recent derbies and have not lost any of their last five clashes with Schalke, but the last three encounters were draws. Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco described it as 'hell' being 4-0 down at Dortmund and wants no repeat at home. ""I still get goosebumps when I think about it,"" said Burgstaller, who scored Schalke's first goal in the fight back. ""We definitely don't want to be 4-0 down again at half-time.""

226,08/04/2018,20:00,Dortmund rout Stuttgart to close on second-placed Schalke,"Christian Pulisic's goal kick-started Borussia Dortmund in a 3-0 victory over Stuttgart on Sunday, ahead of next week's mouth-watering derby at Schalke.","Dortmund's home win leaves them just one point behind arch-rivals Schalke, who are second in the Bundesliga table despite Saturday's shock 3-2 defeat at Hamburg, ahead of next Sunday's Ruhr derby in Gelsenkirchen. Pulisic, a fully-fledged US international at just 19, gave Dortmund the lead against mid-table Stuttgart at a sun-soaked Signal Iduna Park. His cross dipped over Stuttgart goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler to crash in off the post on 38 minutes. ""I actually wanted to hit the far post -- which I sort of did -- it wasn't so wrong in the end,"" joked Pulisic. His fortuitous effort was the highlight of a below-par performance from Peter Stoeger's Dortmund who were lucky to lead at the break. It was a totally different story after half-time as the hosts took the game by the scruff of the neck. Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi, on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season, made it 2-0 just three minutes into the second half as Dortmund flew out of the blocks. Batshuayi delicately flicked the ball into the path of Nuri Sahin, who returned the pass to the Belgian in the box for a simple tap-in from close range to leave Stuttgart on the ropes. Dortmund finished the visitors off when Pulisic headed back to Maximilian Philipp, whose first effort was parried by Zieler, but the winger tucked home the rebound with an hour played. It was Philipp's first goal since November, when he also scored in a 2-1 defeat at Stuttgart. Batshuayi, who has now scored seven goals in nine league games since arriving in January, could have added another soon after when he fired wide. Stuttgart striker Mario Gomez threatened the Dortmund goal when he clipped the crossbar five minutes before the final whistle. Dortmund's win sets them up nicely for the derby. They want to avenge their 4-4 draw at home to Schalke, who scored four goals without reply, last November. A win in Gelsenkirchen would boost Dortmund's goals for the rest of the season. ""We want to qualify for the Champions League and if possible finish second,"" said Sahin. Later, Eintracht Frankfurt moved up into the Champions League places for next season as they went fourth with a 1-1 draw at home to Hoffenheim. Hoffenheim striker Andrej Kramaric hit the post in the first half and Frankfurt's Marco Russ had an effort saved from close range, but the goals flowed after the break. Just four minutes into the second-half, Marius Wolf played a low ball into the middle and Luka Jovic tapped the ball home to put Frankfurt ahead. The lead lasted just seven minutes as Germany winger Serge Gnabry beat a defender and the pace of his shot gave Frankfurt goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky little chance as Hoffenheim equalised. Frankfurt had the best chance to grab a winner when Jovic's replacement Sebastien Haller hit the crossbar with a header 20 minutes from time. Hoffenheim are seventh, unbeaten in their last six league games, as they sit two points from the European places. On Saturday, Bayern Munich were confirmed as Bundesliga champions for the sixth straight year as their 4-1 win at Augsburg left them 20 points clear with only five games left."
227,31/03/2018,21:18,Bayern crush Dortmund but title party put on hold,"Hat-trick hero Robert Lewandowski put former club Borussia Dortmund to the sword as Bayern Munich rampaged to a 6-0 win on Saturday, but the Bavarians have to wait at least another week to celebrate a sixth successive Bundesliga title.","Lewandowski was lucky not to be ruled offside when he gave Bayern the lead after just five minutes. Franck Ribery was less fortunate a few minutes later, as his goal was correctly ruled out by VAR. Luck had little to do with it, however, as Bayern completely outclassed Dortmund in the first half, strikes from James Rodriguez and Thomas Muller giving them a 3-0 lead before the half-hour mark. In the dying minutes of the half, Ribery twinkle-toed his way through the defence to set up Lewandowski's second, before getting on the scoresheet himself with Bayern's fifth, lofting the ball elegantly over goalkeeper Roman Burki. ""We were totally absent today,"" said Dortmund defender Marcel Schmelzer. ""Bayern just played cat and mouse with us. It was a disgrace, and it can't go on like this."" After a quiet second half, Lewandowski completed his hat-trick three minutes from time, turning in Joshua Kimmich's cross from close range. ""I've been on the end of a 5-1 defeat here before, so I know how much it hurts,"" said Bayern and former Dortmund defender Mats Hummels. Bayern's title celebrations remain on hold after Schalke eased to a 2-0 victory over Freiburg earlier in the day. Daniel Caligiuri put Schalke ahead from the penalty spot on 63 minutes, before Freiburg striker Nils Petersen saw a second yellow card for dissent. With both their striker and their coach Christian Streich sent off, Freiburg capitulated, and Guido Burgstaller secured victory 17 minutes from time. RB Leipzig survived a late scare in Hanover, battling to a 3-2 victory to break back into the top four. Leipzig drew first blood on 16 minutes, as Timo Werner broke down the right flank to provide Emil Forsberg with the easiest of tap-ins. Willi Orban doubled the lead early in the second half, sending a powerful header past Philipp Tschauner. Salif Sane quickly pulled one back for Hanover, before Yussuf Poulsen appeared to secure victory for Leipzig in the 76th minute. Niclas Fuellkrug fired Hanover back into the game with a flying header, and appeared to complete a dramatic comeback when he found the net again minutes later, only to see his equaliser disallowed for offside through VAR. ""The three points are hugely important for us and we are happy that we got the reward for our hard work,"" said Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""But we need to regain stability at the back."" Leipzig leapfrog Bayer Leverkusen into fourth, as the latter were held to a turgid 0-0 draw by Augsburg. At the other end of the table, Hamburg dropped more points as they drew 1-1 in Stuttgart. Lewis Holtby scored his first league goal since August to fire Hamburg into the lead on 18 minutes, but Daniel Ginczek equalised against the run of play for Stuttgart just before half-time. Hamburg remain bottom, a point behind fellow strugglers Cologne, who were subjected to a 6-0 thrashing at Hoffenheim. Serge Gnabry scored two brilliant goals to kick-start the rout. Having danced around several defenders to fire in a net-busting opener in the first half, Gnabry grabbed a second just after half-time, picking out the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Cologne-born forward Mark Uth grabbed a brace, as he and Lukas Rupp scored three goals in the space of 10 minutes. Uth then set up Steven Zuber to prod home Hoffenheim's sixth."
228,31/03/2018,16:12,Injured Vidal misses Bayern's Bundesliga showdown,"Bayern Munich midfielder Arturo Vidal will miss his side's key clash with Borussia Dortmund on Saturday evening, after returning from international duty with a thigh injury.","Vidal, who appeared for Chile in a 0-0 draw with Denmark earlier in the week, faces a fight to regain fitness in time for Bayern's Champions League quarter-final clash with Sevilla on Tuesday. ""He has a very strong contusion and haematoma in his thigh,"" said Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes on Friday. ""The doctors advised me to leave him out of the team."" Bayern are set to reassess Vidal's condition on Sunday. The Bundesliga champions in waiting will also be without Spanish full-back Juan Bernat, who has a light ankle injury, but Heynckes said that all other players are ""fit and ready to play"" on Saturday, with the exception of long term absentees Manuel Neuer and Kingsley Coman. The Bayern coach said he would not let Tuesday's clash with Sevilla inform his selection against Dortmund, saying his team ""absolutely wanted to win"" on Saturday. Bayern could wrap up a sixth consecutive Bundesliga title on Saturday, if they beat Dortmund and Schalke drop points against Freiburg."
229,30/03/2018,01:50,Dortmund out to delay Bayern's title party in Munich,Borussia Dortmund coach Peter Stoeger hopes his side can delay old rivals Bayern Munich's Bundesliga title celebrations when the German giants go head-to-head at the Allianz Arena on Saturday.,"Bayern start the weekend with a massive 17-point lead in the table and victory in Munich would secure a sixth consecutive league title if second-placed Schalke slip up at home to Freiburg. ""Our plan is that they don't celebrate the championship title against us,"" said Stoeger. Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes insists he is ""indifferent"" to when the inevitable triumph is confirmed, although the Bavarians haven't sealed the title at home since 2005. Winger Arjen Robben is set to return after missing the last two games with a trapped nerve. He has scored 11 times in 21 matches against Dortmund, including a late winner in the 2013 Champions League final, and the Dutchman is relishing the prospect. ""I love the big games and in the past, games against Borussia Dortmund were always big,"" he told magazine Kicker. ""It's the chance to show a bit more of what you can do."" Bayern centre-back Jerome Boateng could miss out after bruising his Achilles tendon in Germany's 1-0 defeat by Brazil on Tuesday, while Stoeger said it is doubtful Germany winger Marco Reus, who has struggled with a groin strain, will feature for third-placed Dortmund. However, striker Michy Batshuayi will be looking to continue his excellent run of form after scoring in Belgium's midweek 4-0 win over Saudi Arabia in Brussels. Bayern-Dortmund clashes are billed as Germany's biggest showdown -- 'Der Klassiker' -- but the current gulf between the teams is reflected in the 18-point gap in the table. Even if Bayern win the title this Saturday, it will not break their own previous record, set on March 25, 2014, when Pep Guardiola's side won it with seven games to spare. Dortmund are desperate for points in the race for a top-four finish and a place in next season's Champions League, with the five clubs behind Bayern separated by only six points. Despite an early title win being up for grabs, Heynckes may have one eye on Tuesday's Champions League last-16 first leg at Sevilla. Off the pitch, both clubs are hunting for a possible new coach for next season. The 72-year-old Heynckes, whose contract expires in June, has not publicly stated whether he will stay on as Bayern coach while Stoeger has a contract until the end of the season, which could still be extended. RB Leipzig boss Ralph Hasenhuettl, who is under contract until 2019, has been linked to both clubs, but poured cold water on talk of a move to either Dortmund or Munich. ""I feel well here,"" he said at a press conference in Leipzig on Thursday. ""As far as I know, Dortmund has a coach who is Austrian and the final word has not yet been said in Munich."""
230,27/03/2018,15:50,Dortmund star Reus set to miss Bayern showdown,"Germany winger Marco Reus is set to miss Borussia Dortmund's mouth-watering clash at Bayern Munich on Saturday, which could decide the Bundesliga title this season.","The 28-year-old Reus had been in great form with three goals in five league games since mid-February after nine months sidelined by torn knee ligaments. However, Reus is struggling after playing nine games in a little over a month and, having picked up a groin injury, trained alone this week. ""That's why I don't think he will make it this weekend,"" admitted Dortmund head coach Peter Stoeger, who is unbeaten in his 12 league games since taking charge in December. Reus, who missed the 2014 World Cup with torn ankle ligaments and Euro 2016 with a groin strain, is desperate to play at Russia 2018 in June. He was left out of Germany's friendlies against Spain and Brazil, who play at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on Tuesday, to focus on his club form. Third-placed Dortmund, who are 18 points behind leaders Bayern in the table, want a win at the Allianz Arena to spoil Bayern's title party. If second-placed Schalke fail to beat Freiburg in Gelsenkirchen and Bayern are victorious against Dortmund, the Bavarians will be crowned German league champions for the sixth straight season. Stoeger said Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa is expected to miss the next two weeks with an ankle injury. Ukraine winger Andriy Yarmolenko, who has a foot injury, is only expected to return towards the end of the season."

Having already trained with the team behind closed doors on Thursday, Friday's open session could be seen as a publicity stunt as both Bolt and Dortmund are sponsored by Puma. However, the 31-year-old Bolt insists he is deadly serious about starting a new career - at an age when most footballers are hanging up their boots. Bolt, who retired from athletics last year, admits he lacks the endurance fitness football demands. ""Overall, I'd give myself a seven out of ten,"" he said. ""It was fun, the guys were cool and they were welcoming, but I can tell I was unfit. ""I like to play on the wing, right now I am unfit so I try to stay up top (as a striker)."" As expected, Bolt, the 100m and 200m world record holder, showed phenomenal pace over the turf. He was proud of the header he scored in a practise game, but admits having much to learn. ""I'm tall, so it's one of the things I have practiced over the years,"" he said of his header with sweat pouring down his face. ""I was working hard out there, I wanted to play my best, move and give the guys options."" Dortmund coach Peter Stoeger gave a realistic appraisal of Bolt as a footballer. ""He is talented, but if he wants to make it at the top level, there are still a few things to do,"" said the Austrian. ""It's a big leap from athletics to football. ""He's an unbelievably laid-back guy, an athlete with so much success, but with his feet very much on the ground. ""He had fun and he got some feedback, which was his wish. ""He understands the game, what he's missing is the team work and how to move."" Bolt wants to be invited back to train again -- and maybe even sign -- with Dortmund. ""I hope to come again and hopefully they will welcome me, I can get better and (they'll) sign me -- you never know,"" he said. The Jamaican refused to measure himself against Dortmund's professionals. ""I don't compare myself to them yet. I want to play at the level I know I can, to improve and to learn from them,"" he said. ""This is what they do for a living and I am trying to get into this by watching and learning."" However, he was very clear that he does not want to play lower league football. Bolt dismissed even the suggestion of playing for Dortmund's reserves in Germany's third division to gain experience. ""I wouldn't want to play in a lesser league, I want to play in the top league - this is why I am here,"" he added. ""I would like to work with the team more and improve my skills, get better and try to play in the big league. ""I don't set any standards, I don't know where I am at. ""If it gets to the time where I feel like I am at the level, then the coaches or the club will say 'alright, you know what? You can play at this level or that level' ""Until then, I am just going to working hard and pushing myself."" Bolt, a The Manchester United fan, is already due to play at the club's iconic Old Trafford stadium in a charity football match on June 10. Bolt will line up opposite British pop star Robbie Williams and captain the Soccer Aid World XI in a match to raise funds for the United Nations Children's Fund, Unicef. cpb-ryj/pb/lp <org>MANCHESTER UNITED</org> <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org>"

Star to train with Dortmund on Friday,"Athletics legend Usain Bolt, who has ambitions to start a football career at 31, will train with Borussia Dortmund on Friday, the Bundesliga club confirmed.","""Bolt is coming!"" tweeted the German club on Thursday, while the Jamaican sprint star wrote ""BVB, get ready for Friday #BVBolt #NewLevels @bvb09 @pumafootball"", on his official account. The event could be seen as a publicity stunt as both Bolt and Dortmund are sponsored by Puma. The training is scheduled at 1030 local time (0930 GMT) and will be open to the public, with huge media interest expected. Bolt, who holds the world records for the 100m and 200m, had already announced last January that he would be training with Dortmund during the current international break. ""The invitation was made a year and a half ago,"" Carsten Cramer, Dortmund's director of sales and marketing, told SID, an AFP subsidiary. ""His injury and the Rio Olympics put a stop to that. He's in Europe and that fits quite well with the international break. ""Of course, you have to see this with a bit of a wink, but there are a few outstanding athletes in the world, and if they are interested in Borussia Dortmund, we feel honoured. ""We'd like to be good hosts, we will take care of him so that he gets to know more of Dortmund than just the club."" Since retiring from athletics last year, Bolt has made no secret of his dreams to play football and insists he is serious. ""I do not want to hurry, I'll test myself, so I'll be able to say if I can do this or not, then I'll talk to clubs,"" he said recently at a charity event in Switzerland. ""Right now, I do not want to deal with that until I see how good I am."" The Manchester United fan will also line up opposite British pop star Robbie Williams in a charity football match at Old Trafford on June 10. Bolt, an eight-time Olympic gold medallist, will captain the Soccer Aid World XI in a match to raise funds for the United Nations Children's Fund, Unicef."

234,15/03/2018,23:06,Welbeck double helps Arsenal past Milan,"Danny Welbeck's controversial penalty and a Gianluigi Donnarumma howler helped Arsenal beat AC Milan in the Europa League last 16 on Thursday 5-1 on aggregate, while Borussia Dortmund slumped to a shock exit at the hands of Salzburg.","The 3-1 win on the night eases some of the pressure on Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, although his team's 2-0 first-leg lead looked precarious when Hakan Calhanoglu fired Milan ahead. But Gennaro Gattuso's visitors were left incensed when Welbeck tumbled to the floor under little to no contact from Ricardo Rodriguez, with the spot-kick apparently given by the official on the byline. The forward picked himself up to send Donnarumma the wrong way, and leave the infuriated Milan players demonstrating with the officials. ""When I watch the penalty, I will give you an honest answer (whether Welbeck dived),"" Wenger told BT Sport. ""It was good to see a response from the team at 1-0 down. I don't want to accuse Danny Welbeck of diving before I see it again."" Seven-time European champions Milan piled on the pressure in the second half, only for their hopes to be ended when Donnarumma allowed Granit Xhaka's speculative 71st-minute strike to slip through his grasp and bobble into the net. Welbeck nodded in his second late on as Arsenal reached their first European quarter-final since 2010, after seven consecutive Champions League last-16 defeats. Borussia Dortmund bowed out of the tournament, though, with a tame goalless draw in Austria sealing their fate. After falling to a shock 2-1 loss in the first leg at home, the German giants failed to break down their stubborn opponents, who will play in the last eight of a continental competition for the first time since losing the 1994 UEFA Cup final to Inter Milan. CSKA Moscow stunned last season's semi-finalists Lyon, with a 3-2 victory in France ending the Ligue 1 club's hopes of reaching May's final at their own Groupama Stadium. The Russian away side wiped out Lyon's first-leg one-goal lead before half-time through Aleksandr Golovin, although Maxwel Cornet equalised for Bruno Genesio's hosts. But two goals in five minutes swung the tie in CSKA's favour, as Ahmed Musa struck on the hour mark and Pontus Wernbloom made it 3-2 on aggregate. Mariano Diaz gave Lyon hope, but CSKA held on to progress on away goals. Earlier on Thursday, Fernando Torres scored twice as Atletico Madrid romped to a 5-1 Europa League thrashing of Lokomotiv Moscow in Russia to complete a resounding victory. Diego Simeone's side wrapped up an 8-1 win on aggregate to book a place in Friday's quarter-final draw. Elsewhere, Marseille continued their excellent run with a comfortable 5-2 aggregate victory over Athletic Bilbao to reach a European quarter-final for the first time since the 2011-12 Champions League. ""We have to admit that Marseille were superior in both matches,"" said Bilbao coach Jose Angel Ziganda. ""We weren't able to put doubts in their minds, which is what we wanted to do."" But the match was marred as visiting fans attacked and injured two security guards in the city, just three weeks after an officer died during an unrelated bout of fan violence before Bilbao's tie with Spartak Moscow. A spokesman for the Ertzaintza, the Basque Country's regional police, said a guard was injured in the neck with ""a sharp object"". Lazio joined Rudi Garcia's Marseille in the last eight after a 2-0 win at Dynamo Kiev brushed off the disappointment of last week's home draw. RB Leipzig edged into the quarter-finals as they continued their debut European season with a 3-2 aggregate win over Zenit St Petersburg, despite out-of-form Germany striker Timo Werner missing a late penalty in Russia. Rodrigo Battaglia sent Sporting Lisbon into the quarters for the first time in six years as the Argentinian struck in extra time to see off a spirited Viktoria Plzen in the Czech Republic."
235,15/03/2018,13:42,Batshuayi targets World Cup from Dortmund's 'fab four',Michy Batshuayi is in contention for a World Cup place with Belgium after joining Borussia Dortmund's goal-scoring 'fantastic four' while on loan from Chelsea.,"The 24-year-old came off Dortmund's bench to score twice -- including the 94th-minute winner -- in a last-gasp 3-2 win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt last Sunday. Batshuayi has slotted seamlessly into Dortmund's attack alongside Germany trio Marco Reus, Mario Goetze and Andre Schuerrle which has sparked his flurry of goals. The German media has dubbed the quartet Dortmund's 'Fantastic Four' and Batshuayi is relishing the limelight. ""I've seen some talk about that online and I find it funny,"" Batshuayi told Bundesliga.com. ""It's nice for all concerned, the Dortmund supporters are really pleased with us and we're happy too. ""Things like this fire our motivation to continue playing well and scoring goals. ""Long may it continue."" Batshuayi has hit seven goals in nine games since joining Dortmund in January to replace Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who joined Arsenal. The Belgian wants more when third-placed Borussia host mid-table Hanover 96 on Sunday after scoring five times in his first three games. He failed to hit the net in a frustrating off night three weeks ago in a 1-1 draw at home to Augsburg -- which led to a change of hairstyle. ""The only downside was (the draw) against Augsburg, we're all very disappointed with how that turned out,"" said Batshuayi. ""It was a very tough game both for footballing reasons, we should've played a lot better. ""I already had blond highlights, which meant my hair echoed (Dortmund's) club colours, yellow and black. ""However, since we had a bad match against Augsburg, I got rid of them completely, so now I'm back to just black hair."" Now his goal is a top four finish is the Bundesliga to see Dortmund qualify for the Champions League. Batshuayi's loan deal expires in May and German daily Bild speculate Borussia will need to pay Chelsea 60 million euros ($74m) for him to stay. However after frustrating months on Chelsea's bench as back-up to Alvaro Morata, Batshuayi's goals with Dortmund has put him on the radar of Belgium coach Roberto Martinez. Batshuayi hopes to play for Belgium at the 2018 World Cup to add to his 13 appearances and five goals for 'Les Diables Rouges', who have drawn England in Group G. ""If he keeps scoring like he is, then it'll be tough for Martinez to leave him out,"" said ex-Belgium coach Marc Wilmots. ""He's competing against Wolfsburg's Divock Origi (on loan from Liverpool) for a place. ""He has to remain free of injuries and in peak physical condition to play every three days. ""He didn't play that much at Chelsea so he needs a better rhythm, but his smile of late has really struck me. ""You can see he's taken on this challenge with great delight. ""He's done really well at Dortmund with his goals because things looked rather gloomy at Borussia when he arrived."""
236,09/03/2018,18:10,Reus extends Dortmund contract to 2023,"Germany attacker Marco Reus, who had been attracting interest from Premier League clubs, has extended his contract with Borussia Dortmund until 2023, the Bundesliga club announced on Friday.","The winger's old contract was due to expire in 2019 and the delay in prolonging it had reportedly drawn the attention of Tottenham and Liverpool. ""Since I was a child I have dreamed of playing in the black and yellow for this club,"" said Reus who was born in Dortmund but made his Bundesliga debut with Borussia Moenchengladbach. ""I have worn the Borussia shirt since 2012. I am happy and proud to be able to announce today that I will continue to wear it."" Reus, 28, has undoubted talent but his career has been fragmented by injuries which forced him out of both the last World Cup and Euro 2016. He has strung together a good run of games recently and could be returning to full fitness just in time for this summer's World Cup."
237,09/03/2018,01:50,Bayern prepare for life after Heynckes,"Bayern Munich look to continue their dominance of the Bundesliga with victory over Hamburg this weekend, as they begin to prepare for life after Jupp Heynckes.","The veteran coach, who has led to Bayern to what will almost certainly be a sixth consecutive league title this season, appeared to confirm this week that he will not sign a new deal in the summer. Bayern are 20 points clear at the top of the table and will hope to extend that lead with an eighth consecutive victory over crisis-stricken Hamburg. Among the chasing pack are Borussia Dortmund, who face surprise packages Eintracht Frankfurt in a key clash in the race for Europe. Elsewhere, Leon Bailey is expected to return to action for Bayer Leverkusen, while Schalke sporting director faces an emotional homecoming when his side travel to former club Mainz. Bayern Munich's clash with Hamburg on Saturday looks set to be overshadowed by talk of who will succeed Jupp Heynckes. In an interview with SportBild magazine this week, Heynckes appeared to confirm that he will not stay on as Bayern head coach beyond this summer. ""I will be 73 in the summer, and you never know how much more time you have,"" said Heynckes. While Bayern could have the Bundesliga title wrapped up in a matter of weeks, Hamburg are staring down the barrel of a first relegation in their history. With the club seven points adrift of safety, sporting director Jens Todt and chairman Heribert Bruchhagen were fired this week. Eintracht Frankfurt are looking to muscle in on the Bundesliga's elite as they prepare to face top six rivals Borussia Dortmund. Frankfurt were relegation candidates when coach Niko Kovac took over two years ago, but are now firmly in the race for Champions League qualification ahead of this weekend's clash with Dortmund. ""We have the potential to be a really big club,"" said Frankfurt midfielder Makoto Hasebe this week. Leon Bailey is expected to return to action for Bayer Leverkusen when they host Borussia Monchengladbach. The Jamaican starlet was left on the bench during Leverkusen's win over Wolfsburg last weekend, after struggling with a thigh strain earlier that week. He is set to return to the starting line-up on Saturday, however, as fifth-placed Leverkusen look to break back into the Champions League spots. It will be a painful homecoming for sporting director Christian Heidel when Schalke travel to Mainz. Heidel spent 24 years as Mainz's director of sport before moving to Schalke in 2016. He now returns to face a Mainz side who are struggling to move off the relegation play-off place. ""This will be my most difficult homecoming,"" Heidel told Bild. ""I know what victory for us might mean for Mainz. There will be two hearts beating in my chest on Friday."" Coach Stefan Ruthenbeck has warned his players not to throw in the towel as Cologne move ever closer to relegation. Bottom of the table Cologne travel to Werder Bremen on Monday, as they look to narrow the eight-point gap between themselves and the relegation play-off place. ""Our chances of staying up are obviously getting smaller,"" admitted Ruthenbeck. ""But we still have a chance. Giving up is forbidden."""
238,02/03/2018,13:06,Dortmund hoping Sancho return adds cutting edge,"England Under-19 winger Jadon Sancho could return from injury for Borussia Dortmund at RB Leipzig on Saturday as coach Peter Stoeger looks to add more ""power"" to their game.","Sancho, 17, has been out since damaging ankle ligaments in the 3-2 win at Bundesliga bottom side Cologne in early February. Stoeger hopes to add Sancho and fellow live-wire winger Maximilian Philipp, sidelined since December by a knee injury, to the squad. A decision will be made in the final training session as Stoeger looks to boost his options for Saturday's key league clash. ""We'll see whether or not they are ready for the weekend,"" said Stoeger. Second-placed Dortmund threw away a lead in Monday's 1-1 draw at home to mid-table Augsburg and Stoeger was unhappy with the performance. ""We all wish for power football over 90 minutes, when we put the opponent up against the wall, but we're not managing that,"" he said. ""Our basic idea is to make the game more active, I hope we'll see good quality passes and we have ideas how to improve on last time."" Michy Batshuayi, on loan from Chelsea, has not scored in his last three games, failing to build on his explosive arrival which saw five goals in three matches last month. On the plus side, Germany winger Marco Reus is back after nine months sidelined by a knee injury and scored on his last two league appearances. Leipzig have lost their last three games, including last Sunday's 2-1 shock reversal against Cologne. Despite RB's recent results, Stoeger is bracing himself for a tough night in Leipzig. ""It will be a very different fight to the one against Augsburg, lots of speed and lots of counter-attacks,"" said the Austrian. ""If they get it right, they are very dangerous."" Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl says Germany striker Timo Werner has been on red-hot form in training following a five-game goalless drought in the league. Hasenhuettl had a frank chat with 21-year-old Werner, who failed to manage a single shot after coming on for the final 20 minutes against Cologne. ""From what I have seen in the last two days, he is a lot tidier (in training),"" said Hasenhuettl. ""Just like any striker who hasn't scored for a while, you can see he isn't in the best mood."""
239,28/02/2018,17:36,Germany's civil servants hit back at Dortmund boss Zorc,Germany's civil servants fired back on Wednesday after Borussia Dortmund boss Michael Zorc accused his team of playing like a bunch of bureaucrats.,"""You played like civil servants!"" Zorc told the Dortmund squad which passively threw away the lead in Monday's 1-1 league draw at home to Augsburg. Dortmund striker Michy Batshuayi, on loan from Chelsea, failed to score for the third match in a row as Marco Reus's opening goal was cancelled out by Kevin Danso's equaliser for Augsburg. Zorc, Dortmund's director of sport took umbrage at the performance, but Germany's Civil Servants Union (DBB) were less impressed with his insult.

241,27/02/2018,13:20,Five things we learned from the Bundesliga,"German fans again protested against Monday night football, which is proving unpopular in the Bundesliga, while Bayern Munich extended their lead despite dropping points.","In Saturday's goalless draw in Munich, Hertha Berlin's defence again frustrated Bayern's star-studded attack. Ageing winger Arjen Robben is still fuming about dropping down the pecking order, but that anger drew praise from the man who picks the team, head coach Jupp Heynckes. Here are five things we learned from the latest round of Bundesliga games. Large numbers of Borussia Dortmund's fans boycotted Monday's 1-1 draw against Augsburg, but coach Peter Stoeger refused to blame the result on the protest. Home games are normally 80,000 sell-outs, but only 54,000 fans turned up in Dortmund. The protest was another blow aimed at the German Football League (DFL) who are experimenting with Monday kick-offs this season. Dortmund's south stand, normally packed with 24,500 fans, was half empty leading to an eerie atmosphere. That was after Eintracht Frankfurt fans pelted the pitch with tennis balls in last Monday night's game against RB Leipzig. Dortmund's players commented on the absent fans, but Stoeger refused to use the protest as an excuse. ""Many clubs in Germany would be happy if they had 54,000,"" said Stoeger. ""To say you can only play football well in front of 80,000 would be a cheap, simple excuse."" Robben cuts a frustrated figure at Bayern, but Heynckes has played down talk of a rift. The 34-year-old is out of contract in June and still fuming about starting the rout of Besiktas on the bench last week behind Thomas Mueller. However Heynckes understands where the Dutchman is coming from. ""I was just like him as a player,"" Heynckes, 72, told German daily Bild. ""He would never have had such an awesome career if he hadn't been the character he is. ""I've seen so many young, highly talented players who never learned to work so professionally and practise so passionately. ""That's what Arjen does - he's a role model."" Berlin head coach Pal Dardai knows how to frustrate Bayern. Hertha's 0-0 on Saturday was Berlin's third straight draw against Munich -- the best recent record of any league club against the runaway leaders. ""I have been hunting for the book 'How to beat Bayern', but in the mean time, I found 'How to stay unbeaten' and that's not so bad,"" joked Dardai. A string of saves from Berlin goalkeeper Rune Jarstein and dogged Hertha defence denied Bayern, despite 19 shots on goal, but Munich are still 19 points clear in the table. However, Bayern's recent below-par results against Berlin could be blamed on Champions League hangovers. Saturday's draw came after Munich thrashed Besiktas 5-0 last Tuesday in the last 16, first leg. In October, Bayern threw away a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw in Berlin in the wake of their 3-0 group stage thumping at Paris Saint-Germain. After netting five goals in his first three games at Borussia Dortmund, Michy Batshuayi, on loan from Chelsea, has now failed to score in his last three matches. The Belgian striker produced just one shot on goal against Augsburg and rarely troubled the defence in a below-par display. As the Sky match commentator observed, ""he seems to be living off his reputation from when he first arrived"". Germany winger Marco Reus gave Dortmund an early lead, but Batshuayi failed to spark as Augsburg came back and equalised through 19-year-old defender Kevin Danso. ""That's not what we want to see, we might as well have dismantled the goals,"" moaned Stoeger after Borussia's Batshuayi-led attack stuttered in th second half. Second-from-bottom Hamburg are again facing relegation, but have huge problems on and off the pitch. Their 1-0 defeat at Werder Bremen on Saturday left them eight points from safety. They can expect heavy German FA (DFB) sanctions because the match was halted three times after Hamburg fans fired flares onto the pitch. ""These aren't fans, they're people who want to destroy football,"" fumed Hamburg president Heribert Bruchhagen. Police expect more trouble for Saturday's relegation battle at home to Mainz."
242,26/02/2018,23:26,Fans boycott Monday match as Dortmund held by Augsburg,"Marco Reus continued his fairytale comeback with a goal, but Borussia Dortmund were held to a 1-1 draw by Augsburg while fans protested against Monday football in the Bundesliga.","Sub-zero temperatures at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park did little to lift the match played in an eerie atmosphere, although Peter Stoeger's hosts did extend their unbeaten run to nine league matches. There was near silence from the half-full south stand, which normally holds 24,500, as the club backed the supporters' silent protest. ""We accept and respect that many spectators have stayed at home, we are against a further extension of the matchday and will bring the issue to the German Football League (DFL),"" said stadium announcer Norbert Dickel before kick-off. ""We are only for Monday games if there is a sporting reason."" The scenes in Dortmund came after Eintracht Frankfurt fans pelted the pitch with tennis balls against RB Leipzig last week in the first Monday game. Nevertheless, Germany star Reus had plenty to celebrate after claiming his second goal in only his third Bundesliga appearance since tearing a cruciate knee ligament in last May's German Cup final. But the draw sees Dortmund stay a massive 19 points adrift of runaway leaders Bayern Munich in second place, after the defending champions had also dropped two points against Hertha Berlin on Saturday. ""It's annoying to end up with a draw after starting so well at home,"" bemoaned Dortmund midfielder Mario Goetze. ""We didn't do enough with the ball we had and the performance wasn't what we had imagined. ""We're normally spoiled with the support we get from the south stand and we are looking forward to having that support once more when the stadium is full again."" Dortmund's opening goal on 16 minutes had 'Made in Germany' stamped all over it as three international team-mates combined. A lightening counter-attack from their own goal covered the length of the pitch in a matter of seconds. Goetze, who scored the winner in the 2014 World Cup final, slipped the ball to Andre Schuerrle, who had supplied the key cross in Rio de Janeiro four years ago. Schuerrle's delivery to the far post in Dortmund was cut out by Augsburg's Martin Hinteregger, but Reus, who started the breakaway, continued his run and tapped home the loose ball. Having dominated the first half, Dortmund rode their luck in the second and Augsburg grew in confidence. Michy Batshuayi, on loan from Chelsea, had an off night having scored five goals in his five previous Dortmund games since replacing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. After Brazilian midfielder Caiuby went close on multiple occasions, mid-table Augsburg deservedly drew level on 73 minutes. Kevin Danso escaped his marker at a corner and powered a header at Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki, who could only parry back to the Austria international. Danso needed no second invitation and tucked home his second goal of the season on the rebound from close range. The draw means Dortmund remain unbeaten in the Bundesliga since Stoeger replaced Peter Bosz as head coach in December."

The 24-year-old, on loan from Chelsea, wrote on Twitter on Thursday: ""2018 and still racists monkey noises in the stands... really?!"" UEFA said its Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body would deal with the case on March 22. It's not the first time Atalanta fans have been accused of dishing out racist abuse to an opposition player. In January, the club was hit with a suspended one-match partial stand closure after Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly was subjected to such abuse. Following the Dortmund game, Atalanta president Antonio Percassi had said: ""I'll be honest, I didn't hear them. If they did happen, then I am very sad and absolutely apologise to Batshuayi. This should never happen."" Italian football has long had a problem with racist chanting from supporters. In January, Juventus's France international midfielder Blaise Matuidi was targeted by fans in a match against Cagliari. Both Atalanta and Dortmund have also been charged by UEFA over their fans' setting off fireworks and throwing objects onto the pitch."

Atletico Madrid and French striker Antoine Griezmann were paired with Lokomotiv Moscow, the day after another Spanish-Russian game, between Athletic Bilbao and Spartak Moscow, was marred by violence in which a Spanish policeman died of a heart attack. Bilbao will face 1993 European champions Marseille for the matches on March 8 and 15. Another French side, Lyon, must overcome CSKA Moscow to keep alive their hopes of appearing in the final which will be played at their own stadium on May 16. Lyon were comfortable 4-1 aggregate winners over Villarreal in the round of 32 and former club stalwart Bernard Lacombe welcomed the draw which sees the second leg played in France. ""We qualified well against Villarreal, who are a good club. Obviously it would be fantastic to play in our own stadium (in the final) but there are high-level opponents left in the competition and we have to respect that,"" he told beIN Sports. RB Leipzig, who dropped into the competition after being eliminated from the Champions League, will play Zenit Saint-Petersburg, who won the Europa League in 2008.

Here are five things to look out for in this weekend's Bundesliga action: Jupp Heynckes has worked wonders since returning to Bayern Munich, and on Saturday he looks set to break an incredible club record. Heynckes, who has led Bayern to 23 victories in 24 games since October, could now become the first Bayern coach ever to win 15 games in a row. The 72-year-old watched his side romp to victory over Besiktas in midweek to pick up a 14th consecutive win, equalling a club record set under Pal Csernai back in 1980. Bayern are expected to be without James Rodriguez, who was forced to leave the pitch after 44 minutes against Besiktas with a calf problem. A diagnosis on Wednesday confirmed that the Colombian will be out of action for no more than a few days. More fan protests are expected this Monday when Borussia Dortmund take on Augsburg in the Bundesliga's second Monday night fixture. Last week's inaugural Monday game saw fierce protests from Eintracht Frankfurt fans, who blew whistles and held up banners in protest at the new scheduling. This Monday, both Dortmund and Augsburg fan groups are expected to continue protests. Around 300 Dortmund fan clubs have reportedly signed up to a boycott led by the influential fan group ""Suedtribuene Dortmund"". ""We accept every opinion and every protest, as long as it is carried out peacefully,"" said Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. RB Leipzig will be without star midfielder Naby Keita when they host Cologne on Sunday evening. The Guinean midfielder left the field after just an hour in Leipzig's defeat to Frankfurt on Monday, having pulled his hamstring. Captain Willi Orban is also a doubt after suffering a cut to his knee in a collision with Frankfurt's Sebastien Haller on Monday. Coach Ralph Hasenhuettl, though, claimed that the injuries were not a disaster for his team, as Leipzig look to muscle their way back into the top four this weekend. ""We have enough quality to replace both of them,"" insisted Hasenhuettl. Bruno Labbadia takes charge of Wolfsburg for the first time on Friday evening, as the Wolves travel to Mainz for a crucial bottom of the table clash. Labbadia took charge of the struggling Wolves after Martin Schmidt's sudden resignation earlier this week, and is now tasked with leading the club back to safety. ""We have to use every hour available to us,"" said Labbadia. ""I will demand of my players that they invest everything into this fight."" Relegation threatened Hamburg find themselves in last chance saloon ahead of Saturday's visit to arch rivals Werder Bremen. Hamburg have not won in 10 games, and are now six points from safety as they prepare for a must-win game over fellow strugglers Bremen. ""The derby is coming just at the right time,"" said Hamburg's Aaron Hunt. ""It is a great chance for us to turn things around.""

246,22/02/2018,23:41,Arsenal survive Ostersunds scare as policeman dies in Bilbao clashes,"Arsenal scraped into the last 16 of the Europa League despite a 2-1 second-leg defeat by Ostersunds, but Thursday's action was marred by violent clashes at the match between between Athletic Bilbao and Spartak Moscow which left a police officer dead.","Two quickfire first-half goals gave Swedish minnows Ostersunds hope of a sensational comeback at the Emirates, but Sead Kolasinac's goal just after the interval saw Arsenal hang on for a 4-2 win on aggregate. The north London giants move into Friday's last-16 draw, but Ostersunds will take all the plaudits for a brave display full of quality. ""At 2-0 we thought we had a chance. We played well, won the game but it was just short of the miracle,"" Ostersunds coach Graham Potter told BT Sport. A Basque police officer died as security forces clashed with fans of Russian club Spartak Moscow in Bilbao. ""We can confirm that a Basque policeman died Thursday,"" said a press spokesman for Ertzaintza, the Basque police region. However, he would not comment on reports that the officer died as a result of the violence. ""Five people have been arrested. We do not know if they are all supporters of Spartak, but many of them are Russians."" More than 500 police officers had been deployed for the high-risk return leg of the tie, which Bilbao won 4-3 on aggregate despite a 2-1 loss on the night. Having cruised to a 3-0 victory in the first leg last week, Arsene Wenger's Arsenal appeared complacent and were caught out by the vibrant visitors to the Emirates. Midfielder Hosam Aiesh capped off a slick move for the underdogs to pull one back in the 22nd minute, running onto Saman Ghoddos' through ball and slotting into the corner with the aid of a deflection off Calum Chambers. The hapless Arsenal centre-back was caught out just 69 seconds later as the home fans were left stunned, with winger Ken Sema spinning Chambers and drilling a low finish past Gunners goalkeeper David Ospina. Potter may have been thinking back to his side's missed injury-time penalty in the first-leg 3-0 loss, but they continued to press as Arsenal laboured. The Premier League side made it to half-time with a 3-2 aggregate lead intact, but were booed off the field by their own supporters. Unsurprisingly, Wenger's men were much-improved after the break and left-back Kolasinac capitalised on uncertainty in the Ostersunds defence to hammer home with his weaker right foot. But instead of building on that goal, Arsenal continued to be largely outplayed by their unheralded opposition, with Ghoddos and Curtis Edwards both going close to restoring the two-goal cushion. The Swedes ran out of legs as their continental adventure came to an end with a famous victory, but Arsenal were left facing plenty of questions ahead of Sunday's League Cup final against Manchester City. ""We were nowhere near it and not good enough,"" said Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere. ""We are through and that is all that counts. We will see who we get tomorrow and refocus on the big game on Sunday."" Marcel Schmelzer's late equaliser saw Borussia Dortmund grab a 1-1 draw at Atalanta to edge into the next round. Michy Batshuayi's double had brought Dortmund back from 2-1 down to win last week's home game 3-2, and Schmelzer struck seven minutes from time on Thursday to keep the German side in Europe. Belgian striker Batshuayi accused Atalanta fans of racist abuse after the game, writing on Twitter: ""2018 and still racists monkey noises in the stands... really? hope you have fun watching the rest of @EuropaLeague on TV while we are through... #SayNoToRacism. #GoWatchBlackPanther."" Serie A leaders Napoli gave RB Leipzig a serious fright in Germany, but a 2-0 win was in vain as last week's 3-1 loss proved too much to come back from. Leipzig held on to continue their debut European campaign with Napoli left to focus on defending their one-point lead over Juventus in Italy."
247,18/02/2018,20:44,Pitch battle as Reus ends goal drought in Dortmund win,A brilliant first-half strike saw Marco Reus grab his first Bundesliga goal since May to secure a 1-0 win for Borussia Dortmund at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday in a match played on an atrocious pitch.,"The two teams were forced to play on a highly uneven surface in Moenchengladbach after recent poor weather had badly-affected the pitch at Borussia-Park. There were chances for both Lars Stindl and Raul Bobadilla early on, but the pitch remained the focus of attention, as Andre Schuerrle appeared to slip and hurt himself. Schuerrle recovered to set up Reus as Dortmund took the lead against the run of play on 32 minutes. Picking up a pinpoint long pass from Mario Goetze, Schuerrle squared the ball to Reus, whose dipping shot glanced off the crossbar on its way in. ""I actually wanted to hit it further to the left,"" Reus told Sky. ""But the main thing is that the ball went in. We had to scrap today, and we have a lot of work ahead of us."" Reus has missed most of the current campaign with a cruciate ligament tear, and had not been on the scoresheet for Dortmund since scoring a brace on the final day of last season. Jannik Vestergaard found the net for Gladbach just before half-time, but was judged to be offside by the video assistant referee. Thorgan Hazard should have equalised moments later, darting into the box from the left wing before slicing the ball wide. Gladbach continued to push forward after the break, chances falling to both Denis Zakaria and Matthias Ginter before Sokratis denied Bobadilla with a goal-line clearance on 55 minutes. As the second half wore on, Roman Buerki was forced into a string of saves, denying Stindl, Bobadilla and Nico Elvedi to keep Dortmund ahead. At the other end, Reus saw his fizzing half-volley beaten away by Yann Sommer. Earlier in the day, Mario Gomez's goal was enough to secure a first away win of the season for Stuttgart, and inflict a first home defeat since October on Augsburg. The veteran striker gave Stuttgart the lead just before the half-hour mark. After Erik Thommy's free-kick was blocked by the defensive wall, Gomez pounced on the loose ball and swept it into the bottom corner. Michael Gregoritsch appeared to equalise for Augsburg ten minutes later, but he too was correctly ruled offside after a two-minute long consultation with the video assistant referee. Only a superb save from Marwin Hitz stopped Stuttgart from doubling the lead on 65 minutes, the Augsburg goalkeeper denying Gomez from point blank range. ""We should really have won by three or four goals today,"" Gomez told Sky. ""But we showed amazing character, and we're going in the right direction."" The win lifts Stuttgart four points clear of the bottom three, while Dortmund move into second ahead of RB Leipzig's visit to Eintracht Frankfurt on Monday."
248,17/02/2018,18:37,'Not a good time' - Batshuayi reveals Chelsea frustrations,"Michy Batshuayi has opened up about his frustrating time at Chelsea, claiming he ""did not have a good time"" at the Premier League giants.","The 24-year-old has been on fire since joining Borussia Dortmund on loan in January, hitting five goals in just three games. The Belgian striker threatens to add more goals in Sunday's German league match at Borussia Moenchengladbach, who have lost their last three games without scoring. Batshuayi scored twice on his debut in a 3-2 league win at Cologne, then hit the net again in a 2-0 defeat of Hamburg last weekend. His incredible run continued on Thursday with two more goals in Dortmund's 3-2 home win against Atalanta in the last 16, first leg, in the Europa League. After months on Chelsea's bench behind first-choice Alvaro Morata, Batshuayi is relishing his new role leading Dortmund's attack. ""I did not have a good time at Chelsea, but I'm doing well here and I've been well received by my colleagues and supporters,"" Batshuayi told Belgian network Sporza. ""Sitting on the bench, scoring a goal and then being back on the bench is quite difficult to deal with for an attacker. ""As a young player, you need a lot of playing time to evolve. It's perfect here, and I'm trusted by everyone."" Having sold Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Arsenal, Dortmund need a goal scorer, but Chelsea did not offer a 'to buy' option on Batshuayi's loan deal. He is unconcerned about his future and just wants to keep scoring for Dortmund to help win a place at the World Cup with Belgium. ""I'm not thinking about that (returning to Chelsea),"" said Batshuayi. ""For me, it's important to perform well for Borussia Dortmund in every match. ""I'll deal with the situation as it comes."" Dortmund can go second in the table with a win at Gladbach, but will be without Shinji Kagawa. The Japan midfielder has an ankle injury, but Dortmund captain Marcel Schmelzer could return after a calf injury. ""We'll make a decision whether it makes sense for him after the final training session, he doesn't feel 100 percent fit yet,"" said Dortmund coach Peter Stoeger."
249,13/02/2018,18:24,New deal for Borussia Dortmund CEO Watzke,"Hans-Joachim Watzke, who helped save Borussia Dortmund from bankruptcy in 2005 and put the Bundesliga club on the road to rude financial health, has extended his stay as chief executive until 2022, it was announced Tuesday.","Watzke, 58, has signed a four-year extension alongside Thomas Tress, Dortmund's chief financial officer. ""Borussia Dortmund's sporting and economic success since 2005 is directly linked to the work of Hans-Joachim Watzke and Thomas Tress,"" said club president Reinhard Rauball in a statement. ""They have a tremendous bond of trust that has grown in the past 13 years. ""We want to express this confidence in their abilities and their day-to-day commitment early by extending the contracts."" Alongside Tress and Rauball, Watzke, a trained lawyer, stepped in to help Dortmund secure loans in the face of massive debts in 2005. The trio rescued the club from the brink of bankruptcy after over-spending on players had drained the coffers. Currently, Dortmund are in robust financial health, especially after selling Ousmane Dembele to Barcelona in August for 105 million euros ($124 million) and striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Arsenal for £56 million ($78 million) last month. Transfers aside, the Borussia Dortmund group posted a record return of 405.7 million euros for the 2016/17 season. It was the recruitment in 2008 of coach Jurgen Klopp, orchestrated by Watzke and director of sport Michael Zorc, which sparked Dortmund's recent success. Klopp developed the squad which won 2011 and 2012 Bundesliga titles, famously hammering Bayern Munich 5-2 to win the 2012 German Cup, then reached the 2013 Champions League final. However, Dortmund's fortunes dipped after Klopp left in 2015 and eventually joined Liverpool. Dortmund won the German Cup last season under Klopp's successor Thomas Tuchel, but he was dismissed after a disagreement with Watzke. Tuchel's replacement Peter Bosz lasted only a few months before he was sacked in December after Dortmund failed to win in eight league games and were eliminated from their Champions League group. They are currently third in the Bundesliga table, 19 points behind runaway league leaders Bayern Munich, under Austrian coach Peter Stoeger. One of the challenges facing Watzke is to bring the club's hooligans into line after the German FA (DFB) fined Dortmund 50,000 euros on Tuesday for four incidents of misbehaviour by fans. Dortmund hooligans set off flares, which interrupted the German Cup match at Magdeburg and also affected Bundesliga games against Schalke and Hertha Berlin this season. The fine also includes Borussia fans throwing cups of beer at Schalke's coaching zone and goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann during the 4-4 draw at Dortmund in November."
250,08/02/2018,15:37,German international Reus poised for Dortmund return,"Injury-prone German international winger Marco Reus could make his return after torn cruciate knee ligaments for Borussia Dortmund on Saturday against strugglers Hamburg, just four months out from the World Cup.","Reus, 28, has been sidelined since last May's German Cup final, when Dortmund beat Eintracht Frankfurt in Berlin, and has been working his way back to fitness in recent weeks. He could feature in Saturday's squad but head coach Peter Stoeger says a decision will only be made closer to the Bundesliga game. German daily Bild say Reus had targeted the away game at Borussia Moenchengladbach on February 18 -- but he might feature sooner than planned. ""Marco trained normally over the week, we know he wants to play and he knows that we would like to have him in,"" said Stoeger on Thursday. ""We will make a decision at short notice."" While Dortmund are reluctant to rush the injury-prone Reus back into action, the attacking midfielder is keen to find form and fitness four months out from the World Cup in Russia. A string of injuries have restricted him to 29 international appearances and nine goals for Germany. Injuries have seen him miss the last two major international tournaments. An ankle injury suffered in the final warm-up game ruled the fleet-footed playmaker out of eventual champions Germany's 2014 World Cup in Brazil. He then missed the finals of Euro 2016 with a persistent groin injury."
251,06/02/2018,13:27,Borussia Dortmund CEO threatens squad clean out,Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has threatened to clean out the current squad at the end of the season -- unless results improve.,"""We need a squad adjustment in the summer, things will be clearer after the second half of the season,"" Watzke told Frankfurt-based newspaper FAZ. ""Michael Zorc (Dortmund's director of sport) has the lead on this, he knows my opinion and expectation."" Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi, on loan from Chelsea, scored twice on his debut last Friday when Dortmund won 3-2 at Bundesliga bottom side Cologne to finish the weekend fourth in Germany's top flight. However, Andre Schuerrle's late winner for Dortmund did not disguise another poor team performance after drawing their three previous games. Dortmund are 19 points behind run-away German league leaders Bayern Munich. Borussia remain unbeaten in the league under head coach Peter Stoeger, who took over in December when his predecessor Peter Bosz was sacked after eight league games without a win. The German club dropped down to the Europa League knock-out stages after finishing third in their Champions League group behind Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur. Several of Dortmund's stars, such as Turkey midfielder Nuri Sahin, chief defender Sokratis and goalkeeper Roman Burki, are struggling to produce consistent performances. English teenager Jadon Sancho, 17, currently out with an ankle injury, Swedish striker Alexander Isak, 18 and Germany winger Maximilian Philipp, 23, have all impressed and give hope for Dortmund's future. However, below-par team performances have irked Watzke. ""The team that won the 2011 and 2012 (Bundesliga) titles, weren't as good as today's team, but had the best mentality imaginable,"" said Watzke. Having signed Batshuayi only until the end of the season, Dortmund have no option to buy the 24-year-old and they need a proven goal-scorer after selling Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Arsenal. Dortmund fans are hoping Germany winger Marco Reus, who is recovering from a knee injury, will extend his contract, which expires in June 2019, to avoid later losing him on a free transfer."
252,05/02/2018,12:11,Five things we learned from the Bundesliga weekend,"Michy Batshuayi made a blistering start to life at Borussia Dortmund on Friday, firing the team back into the top four with two goals on his debut.","The Belgian wasn't the only debutant to make an impact, as 20-year-old English forward Ademola Lookman grabbed a late winner in his first game for RB Leipzig. The goal saw Leipzig move up to third in the Bundesliga, drawing level on points with second-place Bayer Leverkusen. Both Leverkusen and Leipzig are now 18 points behind leaders Bayern Munich, whose victory over Mainz on Saturday was overshadowed by speculation over coach Jupp Heynckes' future. Here are five things we learned from this weekend's Bundesliga action. Who needs Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang when you have Michy Batshuayi? Just three days after joining Dortmund on a six-month loan deal, Batshuayi enjoyed an explosive debut, grabbing two goals and an assist to inspire his new team to a 3-2 victory in Cologne. ""The way the game went for him today was like a dream,"" said coach Peter Stoeger of his new striker. Batshuayi, meanwhile, is already dreaming of big goals for his six-month sojourn in Westphalia. ""I want to get into the Champions League with Dortmund,"" he said. ""I want to win every single game."" Bayern Munich's dominance of the Bundesliga continued at the weekend, but there was more attention paid to Jupp Heynckes' future. The 72-year-old's contract runs until June, and he has repeatedly refused to talk about extending it. ""I can imagine that readers, viewers and listeners are bored of this topic,"" he said on Friday. Since coming out of retirement to take over at Bayern in the autumn, Heynckes has led the team to 14 victories in 15 Bundesliga games, so it is little wonder that the club would like him to stay beyond the end of the season. ""If I stood naked in front of him, I might have a small chance of persuading him to stay,"" joked club president Uli Hoeness earlier in the week. Everton loanee Ademola Lookman grabbed the headlines on Saturday, scoring 12 minutes into his RB Leipzig debut to secure a late victory over Borussia Moenchengladbach. The 20-year-old Englishman might, however, want to invest in a pair of new boots. ""He was lucky that I didn't take him off again straight away,"" admitted Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl. ""He was just sliding around in the boots he was wearing. They were the only pair he had brought with him from England, and he didn't want to take them off."" Both goalkeepers were left blushing in Gelsenkirchen as Werder Bremen snatched a late 2-1 win over Schalke. Bremen 'keeper Jiri Pavlenka allowed Yevhen Konoplyanka's shot to slip through his fingers in the first half. His error was overshadowed by the woes of opposite number Ralf Faehrmann, however -- he first fumbled a free-kick to gift Bremen an equaliser, before being nutmegged by Zlatko Junuzovic's late winner. ""Ralf said sorry in the dressing room, and I told him he had nothing to apologise for,"" said Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco. Michael Gregoritsch will have enjoyed watching the Super Bowl on Sunday, having secured three points for Augsburg just hours earlier. The Austrian scored Augsburg's second in a 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt, and celebrated by miming a quarterback's throw. ""I will definitely be watching the Super Bowl later,"" admitted Gregoritsch after the game. ""My four best friends are coming over; I never sleep after a game anyway."""
253,03/02/2018,12:47,A new 'Batman' answers Dortmund's call for a scorer,"With Borussia Dortmund having sold their self-styled ""Batman"" Pierre-Emerick Aubemayang, his replacement Michy Batshuayi, another aspiring ""Caped Crusader"", answered their call for goals on his debut.","""I heard the Batman job was vacant at Borussia Dortmund so I decided to take over,"" Batshuayi, who already liked to call himself ""Batsman"", wrote on Instagram after signing a loan deal until the end of the season from Chelsea on Wednesday. Before leaving for Arsenal, Aubameyang sometimes celebrated scoring for Dortmund by donning masks -- once pulling on a Batman hood in a Bundesliga game. With one Batman gone, Dortmund turned to Batshuayi who responded on Friday night. The 24-year-old scored twice on his debut in a 3-2 Bundesliga victory at bottom side Cologne. The Belgian could have finished with a hat-trick after having a goal ruled offside before the break. After showing clinical finishing for his goals, Batshuayi then turned provider. With time running out and the score locked at 2-2, Batshuayi set up the winning goal and his pass was smashed home by Germany winger Andre Schuerrle. The win lifted Dortmund to second in the Bundesliga ahead of the other weekend games. ""Yes, I am very happy, but the most important thing is the victory,"" he said after barely two days at the club. ""We want to go up as far as possible in the table and, of course, qualify for Champions League."" After a turbulent few weeks, overshadowed by Aubameyang's departure to Arsenal, head coach Peter Stoeger is pleased with his latest recruit. ""He's a good boy,"" the Austrian said of Batshuayi. ""He brings a lot from what we need. ""His debut is what we had hoped for. ""This is what one dreams for after the weeks of discussion and the whole over-riding (Aubameyang) theme, where we have not focused much on sport. ""We got a striker who made a great debut."" However, Batshuayi's goals failed to disguise an erratic team performance as Dortmund's rocky defence twice allowed struggling Cologne to equalise. Dortmund dropped Aubameyang twice in January before selling him to Arsenal for £56 million ($79 million, 63 million euros), the Premier League club's record transfer. Indiscretions like missing a team meeting, training poorly, missing a team meeting and arranging a video shoot on club premises without permission, tarnished his departure after five years at Dortmund. Batshuayi is a direct goal-scoring replacement, but has also behaved poorly in the past, being kicked off Anderlecht and Belgium U21 teams in his youth. Nevertheless, his goals on Friday sealed a marriage of convenience. Dortmund needed a goal-scorer and after weeks on Chelsea's bench, behind first-choice striker Alvaro Morata, Batshuayi has a starting berth and that will help his bid for a place in the Belgium squad at the World Cup. Having also chased Olivier Giroud, before the Frenchman joined Chelsea from Arsenal, Dortmund are happy to have procured Batshuayi, albeit on loan. ""He's a classic 'nine', we needed that,"" said Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. ""We had two in the raffle - Giroud and Batshuayi. ""It worked out with Batshuayi. He has that goal instinct and a great goal-scoring record. ""He had a lot of competition at Chelsea, so it was not easy to prevail there."""
254,02/02/2018,22:43,Batshuayi nets twice on Dortmund debut,Michy Batshuayi scored twice on his Borussia Dortmund debut in Friday's 3-2 Bundesliga win at bottom side Cologne -- just two days after signing on loan from Chelsea.,"Head coach Peter Stoeger, who was sacked by Cologne in December, threw the Belgian striker in at the deep end to replace Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Dortmund sold their top-scorer to Arsenal for £56 million ($79 million, 63 million euros), then signed Batshuayi hours later as cover until May. ""I am very happy, but the most important thing was the win,"" Batshuayi told Eurosport. ""It's my first match, it was always going to be difficult, so I am really happy we got the three points."" Having already scored 12 goals for Chelsea this season, Batshuayi scored 35 minutes into his Bundesliga debut when he fired home a cross. Cologne equalised with an hour gone, but the 24-year-old Batshuayi showed ice-cool finishing to restore the lead less than two minutes later. He could have finished with a hat-trick having put the ball in the net just before the break, but the video assistant referee (VAR) spotted he was offside. Cologne levelled for the second time when Jorge Mere headed home, but Batshuayi provided the final pass for Andre Schuerrle to hit the winner. The win broke Dortmund's run of three draws. It lifts them to second in the table, level on 34 points with Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke who play Saturday, behind leaders Bayern Munich. The defeat ends Cologne's four-match unbeaten run which yielded 10 points to boost survival hopes. Batshuayi grabbed his first goal when Dortmund left-back Jeremy Toljan fired a cross into the box for the Belgian striker to fire home. The pair combined again just before the break when Batshuayi again tapped home, but the goal was ruled offside by the VAR. It was 1-0 at the break, but Cologne drew level on 60 minutes when second-half replacement midfielder Simon Zoller finished off a counter-attack. However, Dortmund replied almost immediately. Christian Pulisic headed down a long ball and Batshuayi robbed Cologne defender Dominique Heintz before firing home from a tight angle. Cologne equalised again on 69 minutes when Mere headed home from a corner. Shuerrle claimed his first league goal for 11 months when Batshuayi spotted the Germany winger free on the right and he smashed home the winner. Swiss centre-back Manuel Akanji, who cost 21.5 million euros ($26.4 million) from Basel last month, made his Dortmund debut in the dying stages off the bench."

Dortmund sold their top scorer to Arsenal on Wednesday after weeks of speculation, then hours later signed Batshuayi as cover for the rest of the season. ""He has a good goal ratio and we want to see what he can do,"" Stoeger said of Batshuayi on Eurosport. ""Of course, it won't be easy for him after just a few training sessions."" Dortmund have drawn their last three games which has seen them drop to sixth in the table. Despite being bottom, Cologne are on a roll and unbeaten in their last four games, taking 10 points, to boost their survival hopes. Dortmund's new Swiss centre-back Manuel Akanji, who cost 21.5 million euros ($26.4 million) from Basel last month, started on the bench. The German club has registered Batshuayi, but not Akanji, for the Europa League. Both players had played for their respective clubs in the Champions League this season and Dortmund could not register both.

256,02/02/2018,19:13,Dortmund opt for Batshuayi over Akanji in Europe,"Borussia Dortmund have opted to register new striker Michy Batshuayi, but not Swiss centre-back Manuel Akanji, for their Europa League squad, according to the list released on Friday by UEFA.","Both Akanji and Batshuayi could make their Bundesliga debuts on Friday at bottom side Cologne. Dortmund head coach Peter Stoeger could only register one of his new recruits for the Europa League after signing Akanji from Basel and Batshuayi from Chelsea. The new recruits had already played in the Champions League this season for their respective clubs, meaning Dortmund could not register both for the Europa League. Belgium striker Batshuayi was signed on loan until the end of the season after Arsenal paid a club record £56 million ($79m, 63m euros) for Dortmund's top-scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Discarding Akanji for their European campaign could be a gamble after already losing two centre-backs in the January transfer window. Ex-Barcelona defender Marc Bartra joined Real Betis and Neven Subotic moved to French league side St Etienne. After finishing third in their Champions League group behind Tottenham Hotspur and Real Madrid, Dortmund face Atalanta in the last 32 of the Europa League. They host the Italians on February 15 with the return leg on February 22."
257,01/02/2018,13:23,Dortmund boss relieved Aubmeyang saga is over,Borussia Dortmund coach Peter Stoeger says now that the Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang transfer saga is finally over his side can refocus on their football as they prepare to face resurgent Cologne on Friday.,"""It became a topic behind which no one could hide,"" Stoeger explained. ""It's good that it's over, because the topic attracted such an incredible amount of attention,"" Stoeger told Bild. Arsenal spent a new club record £56 million ($79.2m, 63.7m euros) on Wednesday to sign the Gabon striker and end weeks of speculation. Stoeger, who took charge in December, dropped Aubameyang for Dortmund's first two Bundesliga matches of 2018, yet has defended the star striker. ""In my time, he was never late (to training),"" said Stoeger. ""He once skipped a team meeting and once trained badly because he obviously wanted to send a signal, but otherwise he behaved properly. ""I can not say that the boys (team) were so upset (by his behaviour)."" Nevertheless, Stoeger is delighted the saga is over -- for all parties concerned. ""If we had sent him to the stands and possibly kept him until summer, the topic would have never been settled and there would have been no winner,"" admitted Stoeger. With Aubameyang gone, Dortmund have signed Belgian striker Michy Batshuayi on loan from Chelsea for the rest of the season. He is unlikely to start at Cologne on Friday, but Stoeger hinted he could feature off the bench. ""He is ready to go and there is no training arrears to make up,"" said the Austrian of Batshuayi. English teenager Jadon Sancho, 17, is set to make his fourth start while Dortmund's new Swiss centre-back Manuel Akanji could make his debut after signing from Basel. Dortmund start the weekend sixth in Germany's top flight after drawing their last three games. Despite their placing at the bottom of the table, resurgent Cologne are on a four-match unbeaten run under Stoeger's successor Stefan Ruthenbeck. Only a late equaliser at home to Augsburg last weekend denied them four straight wins. It is a remarkable turn-around as their first win this season only came on December 16 -- shortly after sacking Stoeger, who joined Dortmund just a week later. Ahead of Friday's match, Cologne's director of sport Armin Veh has criticised Stoeger for his training methods while at the club. ""Having 13 injured players is not a coincidence and I assume that something went wrong in our training management,"" Veh told Cologne-newspaper Express in pinning the club's injury woes on Stoeger. ""As colleagues, we've always got on and as the manager of Cologne, it was my job to analyse the situation and make the right conclusions."""
258,31/01/2018,18:20,Dortmund sign Batshuayi on loan from Chelsea,Borussia Dortmund signed Belgian forward Michy Batshuayi on loan from Chelsea just before the German transfer window closed on Wednesday -- hours after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's departure to Arsenal.,"Having sold Aubameyang to the Gunners, who spent a club record £56 million ($79.2m, 63.7m euros), Dortmund have already secured his replacement, just before the country's transfer deadline of 1800 (1700 GMT). The 24-year-old Batshuayi has been signed until the end of the season to fill Aubameyang's boots having spent the season on Chelsea's bench behind Alvaro Morata. ""Michy is a young, very interesting striker, who has a high quota of goals,"" Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc told the club's website. ""He has proven his exceptional quality at both Chelsea and Olympique Marseille, in the Belgian league and the national team."" Batshuayi has scored 12 goals in 26 appearances for Chelsea in all competitions this season having made just 12 starts for the Blues. He is clear of his aim for the rest of the season. ""The World Cup takes place this summer and in order to reach my big goal, I want to play as much as I can and score many goals."""
259,31/01/2018,14:29,Aubameyang - Gabon's masked maverick striker,"The transfer of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Arsenal will delight Premier League fans, but he left a trail of unrest in his wake at Borussia Dortmund.","Arsenal finally met Dortmund's asking price for the Bundesliga's top scorer last season, when Aubameyang netted 31 goals in 32 German league games. The Gunners confirmed Aubameyang had joined for a new club record, reportedly £56 million ($79.2m, 63.7m euros). However, despite clinical finishing and lethal pace, Aubameyang's Dortmund legacy -- 141 goals in 213 matches in all competitions -- is tainted by the manner of his departure. ""I don't know him any more,"" fumed disgruntled sporting director Michael Zorc when Aubameyang, 28, made it crystal clear he wanted out earlier this month. Dortmund's French-born 'Enfant Terrible' has always been known for outlandish behaviour. Arsenal fans can expect him to don masks or somersault to celebrate goals. However, a warning to Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is that three Dortmund coaches -- current boss Peter Stoeger, plus predecessors Peter Bosz and Thomas Tuchel -- have had to discipline Aubameyang over the last 16 months. It started with minor indiscretions, like shaving the logo of private sponsors Nike into his hair, although Dortmund are backed by Puma. He was dropped by then coach-Tuchel in November 2016 for taking a private jet to Milan, just before a Champions League game, to see family. Then he annoyed Dortmund team-mates by checking his father and brother into the team hotel during a winter training camp in Spain in early January. Matters came to a head when he was kicked out of the squad for their first game of 2018, a goalless draw with Wolfsburg on January 14. Having also been dropped in November by Bosz for arriving late to training, Stoeger again ejected him for missing a team meeting. It left the club red-faced, a day after CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke had described Aubameyang as the ""total professional"" in a Die Welt interview. Andre Schuerrle admitted the squad shook their collective heads at Aubameyang's recent behaviour. ""It creates restlessness, it makes you shake your head,"" said the Germany winger. The most blatant provocation came a fortnight ago, when he was left out for the 1-1 draw at Hertha Berlin after training poorly. At the same time as the game, Aubameyang was playing 5-a-side with friends in Dortmund. He wore a Dortmund shirt bearing the name of Ousmane Dembele -- who forced Borussia to sell him to Barcelona in August by boycotting training. Like Dembele, Aubameyang ultimately made it impossible for Dortmund to keep him. He arrived in 2013 with a glowing reputation after hitting 37 French league goals in two and a half years with Saint-Etienne. Having started in AC Milan's youth academy, Aubameyang first fulfilled his potential at Saint-Etienne after spells at Dijon, Lille and Monaco. The 2012/13 season was Aubameyang's breakthrough year in France as he won the League Cup before joining Dortmund for 13 million euros ($16m) in July 2013. When Robert Lewandowski left for Bayern Munich in 2014, Aubameyang stepped up. He netted 16 league goals in 2014/15, then 25 more in his bumper season of 2015/16 when he netted 39 times in all competitions. Aubameyang has expensive tastes, once wearing crystal-encrusted footwear to warm up for a Rhone derby against Lyon. Masks are also his thing -- especially those of superheroes. He donned a spiderman mask after scoring for Saint-Etienne against Rennes in 2012/13. A batman hood -- with Dortmund team-mate Marco Reus pulling on a Robin mask -- was then donned after netting against Schalke in the Ruhr derby. Aubameyang is fast, once claiming to be quicker than sprint legend Usain Bolt over 30 metres. When Bolt set the 100m world record in 2009, he clocked 3.78 seconds over the first 30 metres in Berlin. ""When I was with the Milan youth teams I ran 30 metres in 3.9sec, that was official, but I've run it in 3.7sec too,"" Aubameyang told German daily Bild."

A France international at all youth levels, Laporte has been frustrated at continually being overlooked by senior team coach Didier Deschamps. Guardiola's January spending might not be over after widespread reports that City are interested in Leicester winger Riyad Mahrez. Mahrez, 26, is reported to have handed in a transfer request as the Algerian tries to force through a move to Eastlands.

According to the newspaper, the 27-year-old Spanish international will be joining on a loan deal with an option to buy. For sports daily Marca, the deal was initially intended to be a loan arrangement but has since evolved into ""a transfer"". AS said ex-Barcelona defender Bartra ""is only a few minor details"" away from becoming a Betis player. On Monday, Bartra was in a German court to testify in the trial of Sergei Wenergold, accused of the April 11, 2017 attack on the Dortmund bus. Bartra, who suffered a fractured wrist, told the court he had had nightmares since the traumatic event, which left him in hospital for five ""terrible"" days. He said the attack had ""changed my life"". Wenergold, a German-Russian, has admitted to remotely setting off three explosions in an elaborate bid to make a fortune on the stock market. Bartra began his career at Barcelona in 2011-12 but after struggling to get playing time alongside Gerard Pique and Javier Mascherano he left for Dortmund in 2016."
263,29/01/2018,14:12,"Dortmund bomb attack 'changed my life,' Bartra tells court","Spanish defender Marc Bartra told a German court Monday of his mortal fear when bombs hit the bus of his Borussia Dortmund football team last year in an attack which he said ""changed my life"".","Bartra, 27, was testifying in the trial of German-Russian man Sergei Wenergold, who has admitted to remotely setting off three explosions in an elaborate bid to make a fortune on the stock market. Bartra, who suffered a fractured wrist in the attack, said he had had nightmares since the traumatic event, which left him in hospital for five ""terrible"" days. ""I still haven't fully got over the attack and continue to suffer,"" the player said in a written statement read at the hearing in Dortmund. ""I suffered mortal fear and was afraid I would never see my family again."" The triple blast last April 11 shattered the team bus's windows, with a police officer also suffering inner ear damage. Prosecutors say the three fragmentation bombs each contained up to a kilogramme (2.2 pounds) of a hydrogen peroxide mixture and around 65 cigarette-sized metal bolts, one of which ended up lodged in Bartra's headrest. They charge that Wenergold had sought to profit from an anticipated plunge in the club's stock market value by cashing in on so-called put options, essentially bets on a falling share price. Bartra recounted that straight after the blasts, he heard a ringing in his ears while the other passengers screamed. ""I feared there would be more attacks,"" he said. ""My arm was bleeding, I was dizzy."" With the help of an interpreter he spoke in the hearing of his nightmares and later the sense of ""panic"" at having to face the attacker in court. ""The attack changed my life,"" he said. ""I'm happy to be alive."" After the bombing, police initially suspected a jihadist attack, but then arrested Wenergold 10 days later. The 28-year-old electrical technician has been charged with 28 counts of attempted murder as well as setting off explosions and causing serious bodily harm. He had allegedly remotely set off the three explosive devices hidden in a hedge as the bus was leaving the team hotel for a Champions League match. He was staying in the same Dortmund hotel as the players, had a view of where the bombs went off and had bought the put options on the team's shares on the day of the attack, prosecutors said. The defendant reportedly drew attention at the hotel, first by insisting on a window room facing the front and then, in the chaos after the blasts, by calmly walking into its restaurant to order a steak. A day after the attack, Dortmund played their postponed game against Monaco and lost, prompting then coach Thomas Tuchel to rail against UEFA for not giving the players time to come to terms with their fear before returning to the pitch. Wenergold faces life in prison if found guilty, although in Germany parole is usually granted after 15 years. sid-fz/mfp/dl <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org>"

He headed over the bar in the first-half with his single effort in a performance so poor that he was even booed by home fans for each of his 19 touches. ""No player is bigger than our club,"" said a banner unfurled by angry Dortmund supporters. Dortmund have reportedly rejected a second bid by Arsenal of 58 million euros ($72m) with the German club thought to be holding out for 70 million euros for their top-scorer. ""We know that Aubameyang wants to leave,"" said Zorc. ""We must not forget that he is already in his fifth year in Dortmund. ""We have made it clear that we are ready to realise a transfer when our wishes are completely fulfilled. Arsenal has made several attempts so far and we have rejected them.""

""I cannot say how it will turn out: either our demands are fulfilled or he stays here until the summer,"" added Zorc. ""This has been communicated to his family and everyone accepts it."" Zorc pointed out Aubameyang was disciplined twice by Dortmund in January -- which means he has fallen offside with the club four times in the last 16 months. He was also dropped in late 2017 for coming late to training and also in November 2016 for jetting to Milan just before a Champions League game. ""We have to look at things soberly -- he had two misconducts in January,"" said Zorc. ""Once he did not show up at an important team meeting and then did not train well before a game in Berlin, so we sanctioned him. ""In the meantime, we have been able to calm the situation. We had talks and now we assume that he is fully focused."" Aubameyang's father, also his agent, is pushing for the switch to Arsenal to replace Alexis Sanchez, but time is running out with the transfer window to close at midnight (2300 GMT) on Wednesday. Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki slammed Dortmund's fans for booing their own team -- especially Aubameyang. ""People came to the stadium to whistle their own team -- they should stay at home,"" fumed Burki. ""That is no support -- these are people who have no idea about football, they probably have nothing better to do."" Zorc rejected Burki's comments and said the fans had the right to boo such a poor performance.

""The most important thing would be to just sit down (with Dortmund) and use clear words - that's how you bring about some peace. ""But we must not forget what a great player he is and how much he has given to Dortmund. ""It's wrong, too, that everyone's piling in on top of him now."" Aubameyang has scored 141 goals in 212 games for Dortmund in all competitions since his arrival in 2013. He fell out with Dortmund after being suspended for the second time this season earlier in the month for turning up late to training. Aubameyang was dropped for Dortmund's last two league games and senior Arsenal figures were in the city last Sunday to negotiate a deal. According to German media reports, Dortmund have rejected Arsenal's improved bid of 58 million euros ($72 million) for the 28-year-old. Dortmund, sixth in Germany's top flight, reportedly want 70 million euros for the Gabon star, who has a Borussia deal until 2021. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger insisted Friday there is no development in the saga. Dortmund head coach Peter Stoeger has even said Aubameyang could return to the team for Saturday's league match against Freiburg. Should a transfer fall through, Aubameyang will have to eat considerable humble pie. He did little to endear himself to the German public after being photographed wearing a Dortmund shirt bearing the name ""Dembele"". Ousmane Dembele boycotted Dortmund training last August to force the club to sell him to Barcelona, where he eventually went for 105 million euros ($124 million). Boateng, who left Schalke under a cloud in December 2015 after being indefinitely suspended the previous May, feels football clubs in general must show players who are boss. ""If someone returns too late from their holidays, then a fine is not the only thing that helps,"" said Boateng. ""You also have to sanction a player differently. ""I think the clubs may have to do more to make it clear that they are the boss."" Boateng knows all about getting on the wrong side of management. He last played for Ghana at the 2014 World Cup, but left the tournament under a dark cloud after a row with then-coach James Kwesi Appiah. But Boateng says being suspended by Schalke taught him a few lessons. ""The suspension at Schalke hurt me the most,"" said Boateng, who has played in the England, Spain, Germany and Italy. ""I was shown what it's like when someone can obstruct your future. ""That's where I got to know the football business: it does not matter who you are, what your name is, what you have achieved.

His father, also his agent, was said to be in London this week to try to push through a transfer to Arsenal. Aubameyang trained hard alongside Dortmund's reserves for an hour on Saturday. His tempo was noticeably higher than it had been having been dropped by Stoeger for Friday's draw after the head coach thought the striker had been distracted in the final session before the Bundesliga match in Berlin. On Friday, while his club was drawing in Berlin, Aubameyang played a kick-about game indoors with his friends in Dortmund. German daily Bild report that he wore a Dortmund shirt bearing the name of Ousmane Dembele, who transferred to Barcelona in August after going on strike to force the German club to sell him for 105 million euros.

""There's a way back into the team for him, but professionalism is part of that, which includes saying you've made a mistake in one situation or another,"" added Zorc."

Dortmund coach Peter Stoeger took the decision to leave out the Gabon international again amid reports he is chasing a move to Premier League side Arsenal, who look set to lose forward Alexis Sanchez to Manchester United. ""There is nothing concrete on the table, only a lot of air,"" Dortmund director of sport Michael Zorc told Eurosport when asked about the Arsenal rumours. ""We're planning with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and there's a way back into the team for him, but professionalism is part of that. ""That includes saying you've made a mistake in one situation or another."" Aubameyang is being disciplined by Dortmund for the third time in 16 months after he missed a team meeting last weekend. Stoeger said the 28-year-old can still win back his place in the team for next weekend's home match against Freiburg. ""If he can help, he can offer himself up again. If he works hard in training, he will be back next week,"" said Stoeger."
272,19/01/2018,13:42,Bayern boss backs Dortmund's stance on Aubameyang,Bayern Munich coach Jupp Heynckes has backed the decision by Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund to drop star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang amid reports he is chasing a move to Arsenal.,"Aubameyang was again omitted from the Dortmund squad for Friday's German league clash at Hertha Berlin having also been suspended by Borussia head coach Peter Stoeger for last Sunday's goalless draw at home to Wolfsburg. The 28-year-old has hit 13 goals in 15 league games this season, scoring 21 times in 23 matches in all competitions. However, he was disciplined for the third time in the last 16 months for failing to attend a team meeting last weekend. His father and agent Pierre is reportedly in London trying to organise a move to Arsenal for the Gabon star, but Heynckes says Dortmund were right to drop their top-scorer. The 72-year-old Bayern boss says he is especially sympathetic after Ousmane Dembele boycotted training at Dortmund last August in a bid to force Borussia to eventually sell him to Barcelona. ""What's going on in Dortmund with Dembele and Aubameyang you have to look at very critically,"" Heynckes said in Munich on Friday. ""I think that any future club should think twice about taking on a player like that and I can honestly say, I would reject such a player. ""It's still a team sport and there is no place for it. ""We have to be careful that fans don't turn their backs on us at some point."" Heynckes said he could not imagine a similar scenario evolving for one of his players at Bayern. ""You have to show a player that you just can't behave like that,"" he added. ""I don't want to say it would never happen at Bayern, but I must honestly say I can't imagine it. ""Players have their responsibilities, they have a big commitment to their club, so it's not enough to just look at the bank balance at the end of the month."" Dortmund are fourth in the table while Bayern start the weekend with a 13-point lead over nearest rivals RB Leipzig before Sunday's home match against Werder Bremen."
273,18/01/2018,15:56,Dortmund deny contact with Arsenal for Aubameyang,Borussia Dortmund said on Thursday they have had no contact with Arsenal amidst reports their star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is chasing a move to the Premier League giants.,"Aubameyang's father and agent Pierre has reportedly been in London this week to negotiate a transfer for the Gabon forward, who was left out of Dortmund's squad for Friday night's trip to Hertha Berlin, according to newspaper Bild. According to German magazine Kicker, Dortmund want 70 million euros ($85.6m) for last season's top-scorer in the German league. Aubameyang has already scored 21 goals in 23 games this season, but was disciplined by the club last Sunday for the third time in 16 months after failing to attend a team meeting. He was dropped for Sunday's goalless draw at home to Wolfsburg and will now miss a second game in a row, fuelling the speculation he will soon be heading to north London. ""It is obvious that he has to put his foot down in training and show up well,"" head coach Peter Stoeger said of Aubameyang earlier on Thursday. ""He can decide for himself, with his attitude, whether he will be considered and I plan on using him, if he works hard."" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger praised Aubameyang's ""strong character"", which did not go down well with Dortmund's sports director Michael Zorc. ""We find it respectless to talk about a player from another club,"" said Zorc, who added that Aubameyang has this week ""trained well and is focused"" on regaining his Dortmund place. ""There has been no contact with Arsenal and we assume Arsene Wenger has enough to do worrying about the performances of his own players."" Aubameyang has a contract at Dortmund until 2021. Swedish teenager Alexander Isak, 18, made only his third German league appearance when he took Aubameyang's place on Sunday, but the team struggled to take their chances."
274,18/01/2018,02:15,All eyes on Aubameyang as Arsenal hover,"All eyes will be on whether Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will return to Borussia Dortmund's starting line-up at Hertha Berlin on Friday, with the star striker reportedly chasing a move to Arsenal.","Dortmund coach Peter Stoeger has told magazine Sport Bild he ""assumes"" Aubameyang, who has scored 21 goals in 23 matches this season, will stay, but ""if he leaves, it will be hard to replace him with that goal quota"". German media reports claim the Gabon hot-shot is chasing a transfer to Arsenal after being disciplined on Sunday, with Dortmund wanting 70 million euros ($85.6m) for last season's Bundesliga top scorer. ""He has trained with the team and is in our plans,"" Stoeger said firmly of Aubameyang with one eye on Berlin. The 28-year-old, who hit 31 league goals last season, was dropped for Sunday's goalless draw at home to Wolfsburg for skipping a team meeting. It was the third time he has been disciplined by Dortmund in the last 16 months, following an unauthorised video shoot on club premises last November and his jetting to Milan before a Champions League game a year before. Stoeger started 18-year-old Alexander Isak against Wolfsburg, but Dortmund's attack missed Aubameyang's finishing as they failed to convert a string of chances. Dortmund's England Under-19 star Jadon Sancho hit the post in the second-half as both sides played out a goalless draw. Dortmund are set to welcome back US international midfielder Christian Pulisic, while new central defender Manuel Akanji could feature against Hertha. The 19-year-old Pulisic has recovered from the shin knock which kept him out of the Wolfsburg match. ""It's looking good for him,"" Stoeger said. ""As things stand, he's an option for the weekend."" Swiss Akanji arrived from FC Basel on Monday, with the 22-year-old centre-back signing a contract which runs until June 2022. Fourth-placed Dortmund are unbeaten in their three league games since Stoeger took over from Peter Bosz last month, while Hertha are down to 11th after crashing to a 1-0 defeat at Stuttgart last weekend.

275,17/01/2018,11:45,Aubameyang chasing Arsenal move,Borussia Dortmund want-away star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is reportedly close to signing for Premier League side Arsenal -- with the German club in turn hoping to recruit Michy Batshuayi from Chelsea.,"German daily Bild says Dortmund want 70 million euros ($85.6m) for Aubameyang, the top scorer in the Bundesliga last season with 31 goals. Bild says Aubameyang's father and agent Pierre is in London discussing a possible transfer with Arsenal with the Gunners reportedly considering selling Chile striker Alexis Sanchez to Manchester United. Bild also claim Dortmund are closely monitoring Belgian forward Batshuayi, who has failed to impress Antonio Conte at Chelsea, starting just two of his 11 Premier League appearances this season. Aubameyang seems determined to force a move from Bundesliga side Dortmund. He was dropped for Sunday's goalless draw at home to Wolfsburg after failing to attend a team meeting -- the third time he has been disciplined by the club in the last two seasons. ""I don't know what is going through his head. I don't know him any more,"" said Dortmund's clearly exasperated director of sport Michael Zorc. ""He used to be always professional, I have never experienced such behavior before and it can not go on like this - it's intolerable."" The Gabon hot-shot has scored 21 goals in 23 games in all competitions this season, but Dortmund's head coach Peter Stoeger, who stepped in last December after Peter Bosz was sacked, has said Aubameyang is currently a disruptive influence in the squad. It remains to be seen whether Stoeger will select Aubameyang for Friday's Bundesliga match away to Hertha Berlin. ""Disappointment is the wrong expression, rather incomprehension, because I can not really understand his behaviour, but I'm not the only one,"" Stoeger told Sport Bild magazine. The Austrian head coach said he is assuming that Aubameyang, who has a contract until 2021, will stay, but if so, the player has bridges to rebuild with the club. ""'Auba' must make it clear to the coach whether or not be is prepared to give everything for Borussia Dortmund,"" echoed Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke."
276,15/01/2018,16:40,Dortmund sign Swiss defender Akanji from Basel,"Borussia Dortmund have signed Manuel Akanji from FC Basel, with the Bundesliga club announcing that the Swiss international defender has signed a deal until June 2022.","Neither club has revealed the fee paid by Dortmund for the player, but German media report that the eight-time German champions paid around 21.5 million euros ($26.4 million). ""Manuel's performances put him on the radar of a number of top European clubs, and we're delighted that he's chosen to join us,"" said Borussia Dortmund's sporting director Michael Zorc on the club's website. ""He has already demonstrated at international and Champions League level that he can play at the highest level in Europe. Nonetheless, we still see him as a defender who has potential for further development."" Akanji, 22, has four international caps for Switzerland and played in all six of Basel's Champions League group games as they qualified for the knockout stages alongside Manchester United, after winning the domestic league and cup double last season. ""The discussions I've had with those responsible at Borussia Dortmund made me feel comfortable. In that respect it was a decision of the heart,"" said Akanji. ""I've always enjoyed the football they play in Dortmund."" Dortmund are currently fourth in the Bundesliga, 15 points behind leaders Bayern Munich and on the heels of Schalke and Leipzig."
277,14/01/2018,18:43,Dortmund drop Aubameyang again for discipline breach,Borussia Dortmund dropped star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang on Sunday for failing to attend a team meeting -- the third time he has been disciplined by the club in two seasons.,"The 28-year-old Gabon forward, who has hit 13 goals in 15 league games this season, was left out of the squad for Sunday's Bundesliga match at home to Wolfsburg, the club said on their Twitter account, for ""disciplinary reasons"". Before kick-off against Wolfsburg, Dortmund coach Peter Stoeger revealed that Aubameyang was kicked out of the squad for missing a team meeting on Saturday. ""He claimed to have forgotten about the meeting, but we all know that was not the case,"" Stoeger told Sky. ""He didn't come and it was an important meeting for team spirit. ""It means he can have his position back next week."" Swedish teenager Alexander Isak started up front instead of Aubameyang in only his third German league appearance, having previously played just 13 minutes of Bundesliga football in his career. ""He (Aubameyang) was a bit surprised, he didn't take it so seriously, but for us, the case was clear,"" added Stoeger. ""If he doesn't want to be here, we will give his position to another guy who will be completely focused. ""We are relatively relaxed. We know he's a very important player, but the boys also know they can win without him and Isak looked good in training in the last two weeks."" This is the second time this season Aubameyang has been dropped by the club for a breach of discipline. He was left out in November for an unauthorised video shoot at the club's training ground and after turning up late for training. And last season he was dropped for flying to Milan to visit family just before a Champions League match. The timing of Aubameyang's latest transgression is especially unfortunate after Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke defended the striker on Saturday in an interview with daily newspaper Die Welt. Aubameyang was the subject of negative headlines in the German media last week for checking his father and brother into the team hotel during a winter training camp in Spain, criticism which Watzke felt was unjustified. ""In all this scrutiny, which is an extravagence as far as I am concerned, we mustn't forget one thing: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is a total professional,"" Watzke told Die Welt."

Akanji, who has made four international appearances, was reportedly also being chased by Premier League giants Man United. Dortmund had reportedly initially offered 15 million euros for Akanji, who cost Basel 700,000 euros from Winterthur just two years ago, but upped their bid after problems in defence so far this season. Dortmund have yet to confirm Akanji's transfer ahead of their first Bundesliga match of 2018 at home to Wolfsburg on Sunday."
279,13/01/2018,17:11,Dortmund boss defends under-fire Aubameyang,"Borussia Dortmund's CEO has defended their under-fire star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has been the target of negative headlines in the German media recently.","Dortmund resume their Bundesliga campaign after the winter break on Sunday at home to Wolfsburg with star striker Aubameyang hoping to add to his tally of 13 goals in 15 league games. He is also just two short of scoring his 100th Bundesliga goal. However, Aubameyang, last season's top scorer in Germany, earned heavy criticism in the German media after being suspended last November by the club for turning up late to training and an unauthorised video shoot. Dortmund captain Marcel Schmelzer recently admitted constant speculation, mostly linked to Chinese clubs, about Aubameyang's future also distracts the squad. Aubameyang further irked the media last week after checking his father and brother into the team hotel during Dortmund's winter training camp in Marbella, Spain, criticism which, Watzke says, was unjustified. ""In all this scrutiny, which is an extravagence as far as I am concerned, we mustn't forget one thing: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is a total professional,"" Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke told German daily Die Welt. ""I don't like the way he is being presented by the German tabloid media, which is getting ever broader and who, incidentally, will miss him when he doesn't play here anymore."" Watzke said France-born Aubameyang's decision to let family members stay in the team hotel was blown out of proportion and it would have been wrong to have asked them to stay elsewhere. ""For someone from a different culture than ours, that would have been a terrible insult - worse than us pedantic Germans could imagine,"" said Watzke. The Dortmund CEO insists Aubameyang's family ""did not bother anyone. It was a storm in a tea cup. Pierre-Emerick is who he is."" As to any transfer speculation about the Gabon hot-shot, ""there is no agreement with anyone whatsoever, I recommend keeping to the facts,"" Watzke added."

The first kicks-off at 2030 local time (1930 GMT) on February 19 when Eintracht Frankfurt host RB Leipzig. Dortmund are at home to Augsburg in the second planned Monday match on February 26 and Borussia fans are opposing the initiative. ""With a heavy heart, but out of conviction, we have decided to stay away from the game against Augsburg and not use our tickets on that day,"" said the coalition ""Suedtribune (south stand) Dortmund"" in a statement released on Friday. ""This decision is in no way directed against the team, but we can not -- and will not -- accept Bundesliga matches on Mondays!"" German fans are always vocal about changes to kick-off times. Bundesliga match days are currently restricted to Friday, Saturday and Sunday kick-offs with the occasional round of mid-week matches. Dortmund fans hope to force German Football League (DFL) bosses into a rethink if the iconic south terrace -- nicknamed 'the Yellow Wall' which holds around 24,000 -- is empty during games. ""For the Bundesliga, which likes to present itself with its atmospheric terraces and sold-out stadiums, Monday games are a declaration of bankruptcy,"" the statement added. ""When matches take place on dates when nobody actually has time to go to the stadium, that reveals the dreadful indifference to the social importance of football and the fans who make the sport what it is."""

Dortmund signed Schuerrle from Wolfsburg for a club-record 30 million euros ($36.4mn) in July 2016, but he has failed to impress in the black and yellow shirt in an injury-ravaged spell. So far in 2017/18, Schuerrle has played four games for a total of 225 minutes. He has only made 19 appearances in the Bundesliga, nine of them in the starting team, yielding two goals and four assists, since joining Dortmund and has suffered a succession of injuries.

Although he is back in training, there is ""no possibility"" of Reus facing mid-table Wolfsburg, according to head coach Peter Stoeger. Likewise captain Marcel Schmelzer is out with a calf injury and midfielder Raphael Guerreiro has an injured thigh. ""Anyone who knows me, knows how impatient I am,"" Reus told German daily Bild. ""But I am back after a bad injury and I have no desire to have anymore problems (by coming back too soon)."" World Cup winner Goetze, 25, is also training again after an ankle injury he suffered last November, but has no guarantee of starting against Wolfsburg. ""He was gone for a long time and a few training sessions don't guarantee that he can play over the 90 minutes,"" said Stoeger. ""Already after a few days in training you could see what you can't take away from him: his qualities. ""But we have to see how physically fit he is."" There is some good news in that nine of the squad, who were struck down with stomach complaints at the start of the week at the winter training camp in Marbella, are back in training. Stars such as Roman Burki, Marc Bartra, Andre Schuerrle, Christian Pulisic and Nuri Sahin were all laid low after reportedly eating contaminated chicken skewers in Spain. ""The lads who had the problem are all back in training and completed the full programme,"" said Stoeger. Dortmund are up to third in the table, 13 points behind leaders Bayern Munich who are at Leverkusen on Friday, after winning their last two league games of 2017 under Stoeger while Wolfsburg are mid-table. Stoeger managed to stop the rot following the dismissal of Peter Bosz, who was sacked after Dortmund went eight league games without a win having held a five-point lead in the table at the end of September."
284,11/01/2018,05:03,Aubameyang deal dead as China champions vow to focus on youth,Chinese champions Guangzhou Evergrande appear to have ended any interest in Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after a public dressing-down by football authorities in the country.,"The club coached by Italian legend Fabio Cannavaro had reportedly won a 72-million-euro tug-of-war with Chinese Super League (CSL) rivals Beijing Guoan for the Gabon hotshot. But on Tuesday, the Chinese Football Association (CFA) warned the two clubs -- without naming them or Aubameyang -- against ""engaging in a bidding war"" and said that its prohibitive 100 percent tax on incoming foreign players would be strictly enforced. CSL champions Evergrande consequently denied that they were pursuing the 28-year-old -- though they too did not name him -- and on Wednesday reiterated that they want to field an all-Chinese team within two years. ""We resolutely refrain from buying foreign players for big money and engaging in any competition for (the services of) foreign players, and we are shifting the focus of our work to cultivating youngsters,"" said the latest Evergrande statement. The club, which won a seventh CSL title on the bounce in October, added that it was striving ""to gradually achieve the goal of an all-Chinese team by 2020 in an attempt to contribute to the stable, healthy and sustainable development of Chinese football."" Beijing Guoan have remained tight-lipped about any attempt to snare Aubameyang, but Chinese media previously reported that Evergrande had trumped the club from the capital with a 20 percent higher offer for the unsettled striker. Any deal now appears dead and the Evergrande statement is firmly in line with the Chinese government's attempts to rein in spending on big-money foreign players in favour of investing in local talent instead. Champions Evergrande ended last season six points ahead of second-placed Shanghai SIPG, which a year ago broke the Asian transfer record when they splashed out 60 million euros on attacking midfielder Oscar from Chelsea."
285,09/01/2018,06:48,Chinese FA warns clubs over Aubameyang 'bidding war',"China's football association (CFA) warned Tuesday that it would punish teams who flout its transfer rules, following reports two clubs are battling to sign striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.","Chinese Super League (CSL) champions Guangzhou Evergrande are reportedly prepared to pay at least 70 million euros for the Borussia Dortmund attacker, trumping an offer by rivals Beijing Guoan. The CFA last year introduced a 100 percent tax on incoming foreign transfers in an effort to encourage Chinese clubs to invest on local youth players, but media reports suggest both clubs are prepared to either incur the penalty or find a way to circumvent it. Evergrande denied they were pursuing Aubameyang -- without explicitly naming him -- but that was not before the CFA made plain its anger. The CFA too did not name the striker but made a clear reference to the 28-year-old and Evergrande and Guoan. ""The news of two clubs suspected of engaging in a bidding war on a transfer has caused social concern,"" it said in a statement, adding that it had asked them to explain. ""In the next step of the investigation, if any violations are found, the Chinese FA will handle this seriously according to law and regulation."" Stressing that the 100 percent surcharge was applicable in the current winter transfer window and in the year ahead, the CFA warned: ""We will watch closely every club's transfer movement in the new season and increase scrutiny. ""The Chinese FA will seriously investigate and will not tolerate any violation or any loophole-exploiting behaviour."" The hard-hitting missive is the latest salvo in the Chinese government's war on ""irrational"" overseas investments -- a word also used in the CFA statement -- as football authorities attempt to rein in CSL clubs who have shelled out record amounts for foreign stars. A year ago, Shanghai SIPG smashed the Asian transfer record to sign Chelsea's attacking midfielder Oscar for 60 million euros. However, with the 100 percent levy in place last summer, Tianjin Quanjian secured French striker Anthony Modeste from Cologne on a two-year loan deal, rather than buying him outright. Dortmund have dismissed the Aubameyang transfer talk as speculation, but Chinese media has been filled for several days with multiple reports that a deal has been reached for him to move to Fabio Cannavaro's Evergrande after the Bundesliga season. Soon after the CFA statement, Evergrande hit out at ""the purely fictitious"" reports and threatened legal action. ""We will, as we always have, strictly follow the FA's regulations on transfers,"" the club said. ""We reserve our legal right to pursue those responsible for the inaccurate reports."""
286,20/12/2017,23:11,Mueller helps Bayern battle past Dortmund,Thomas Mueller scored the decisive goal as Bayern Munich fought to a 2-1 victory over rivals Borussia Dortmund to reach the German Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday.,"Goals from Jerome Boateng and Mueller gave Bayern a comfortable lead before half-time, but Andriy Yarmolenko's second-half header made it a nervy last 15 minutes for Bayern. ""We've stumbled into the quarter-finals,"" said Bayern defender Boateng. ""We played well in the first half, but we should have decided it earlier."" After several gilt-edged chances in the opening minutes, Boateng headed Bayern into the lead on 12 minutes. Niklas Suele guided a James Rodriguez free-kick onto the bar, before Boateng emerged to nod the ball past Roman Buerki. With star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang out injured, it wasn't until the 35th minute that Dortmund created a significant chance. Stand-in front man Yarmolenko found space in the box, only to see his shot cleared off the line by David Alaba. Minutes later, Bayern doubled their lead in style. Played through by Robert Lewandowski on the right wing, Mueller sent an elegant chip over Buerki and into the far corner. Two brilliant saves from Buerki kept Bayern from running riot just after half-time, but Bayern looked ever more comfortable as the game wore on. When Franck Ribery was substituted off on the hour mark, the win appeared to be secure. Bayern were shocked into life on 76 minutes, though, when Yarmolenko pulled a goal back for Dortmund. Shinji Kagawa whipped in a cross, and home goalkeeper Sven Ulreich couldn't deny the Ukrainian at the far post. Dortmund could muster little more than a handful of half-chances as they pushed for the equaliser. Only in injury time did they create a golden opportunity, as Alexander Isak's shot was deflected just inches past the post. ""If we had played the whole game like we did in the last half an hour, we might have taken something away from this game,"" said Dortmund defender Marcel Schmelzer. Elsewhere, Leon Bailey netted the winner as Bayer Leverkusen beat Borussia Moenchengladbach 1-0 to book their place in the quarters. Goalless until the 71st minute, the game burst into life when Bailey broke down the left to pick up Kevin Volland's through ball and fire past Yann Sommer. Werder Bremen also progressed to the last eight by beating Freiburg 3-2. After goals from Ishak Belfodil and Florian Kainz had put Bremen two goals up, Nils Petersen pulled a goal back from the penalty spot. With 20 minutes to play, Philipp Bargfrede swept the ball in for Bremen's third, the referee overruling the linesman's offside flag. A late goal from Yoric Ravet proved too little for Freiburg."

""I'll say it again, I haven't been able to exert much influence here and I have taken a lot of good things from my predecessor,"" the Austrian said. ""You can see in the team that when they haven't won for a long time, it simply does them good to get a win.

Stoeger has a contract until the end of the season and there are reports Hoffenheim's Julian Nagelsmann, voted Germany's coach of the year for 2016, will replace him for next term. Nagelsmann reportedly has a release clause in his contract, which runs until 2021, but has consistently denied any contact with Dortmund. ""The question of whether I asked for a clause is not relevant, because there was no offer and no club made an approach,"" he said. ""I keep stressing that I completely distance myself from these rumours. ""I've never discussed, not even with my advisor, whether or not I want to fulfill my contract. I only focus on my team."""

""It really is a big honor and I just want to thank everyone who voted for me to win US Male Player of the Year,"" Pulisic said in a statement on the US Soccer Federation website. ""It's something that I never could have imagined to be here in this position. I'm thankful for everyone who supported me and I'm excited for the future."" The previous youngest winner of the prize, first awarded in 1984, was Landon Donovan, who was 21 when he won in 2003. In nine appearances for the United States in 2017 Pulisic scored six goals. He delivered the decisive pass in four more, and figured in some form in 13 of the 17 goals scored during matches in which he played. His emergence as a star was a bright spot for the United States team that failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. Those voting for the award included every player capped by the USA in 2017, men's national team and youth national team coaches, Major League Soccer coaches and a select group of former players and media members. On the club front, Pulisic ended his first full season with the Borussia Dortmund first team in 2016-17 by recording three goals in 25 matches across all competitions for the Bundesliga runners-up. He has continued to be a key figure for Dortmund this season."
290,12/12/2017,17:58,Hoffenheim hope to fend off Dortmund over Nagelsmann,"Hoffenheim's backer has assured fans the club will keep star coach Julian Nagelsmann, 30, for at least another 18 months amidst reports Borussia Dortmund want him for 2018/19.","""The club have done their homework, Julian has a binding contract with us until June 30, 2019,"" Hoffenheim's billionaire backer Dietmar Hopp told supporters at the club's annual general meeting on Monday. ""Julian is an exceptional coach. We'll have to clone him sometime, but the clone should be ready by July 1, 2019."" Hopp's joke indirectly confirms reports that Nagelsmann, Germany's coach of the year in 2016, has a buy-out clause, said to be worth five million euros ($5.8m), from 2019. In June, Hoffenheim announced they had extended his contract until June 2021, but he seems increasingly unlikely to see it through. In February 2016, Nagelsmann, then just 29, became the youngest coach in Bundesliga history. He became a star in Germany by pulling Hoffenheim back from the brink of relegation in 2015/16 to then finish fourth in the Bundesliga last season. Reports are rife that Dortmund want Nagelsmann for next season and Bayern Munich are also said to be interested. On Sunday, Dortmund named Peter Stoeger as head coach after Dutchman Peter Bosz was sacked with the team winless in their last eight league games. Stoeger, who has a contract until June, is reportedly seen as an interim appointment before Nagelsmann arrives for next season, but Hopp will fight to keep him. ""The demand for Julian is damned high and increases with every success -- he's just too good,"" Hopp said. ""But we still have a year and a half left, so in the meantime, we want to continue celebrating with him and we want to push the celebrations even more."" Nagelsmann was in the audience listening to Hopp speak, but is clearly annoyed by constant questions over his future. ""Things aren't changing every two days and two days ago, I said that I have had no contact (with Dortmund),"" said Nagelsmann on Sunday after Hoffenheim's 2-0 defeat at Hanover left then sixth in the table."

""Children are very important to me, because they are the future, so I decided to write a children's book about respect, tolerance and open-mindedness."" Goetze read his book to a group of school children at Germany's Football Museum in Dortmund, near where the boot with which he scored the winner in the 2014 World Cup final is on permanent display. The Dortmund star, currently out of action with an ankle injury, claims his book is not autobiographical, but the story centres around ""little Mario"", who dreams of becoming an international. Under the guidance of a former star player, who looks a lot like Germany's head coach Joachim Loew, little Mario learns fame and winning is not everything. Goetze says he will donate any profits from the book to the Munich-based foundation ""Kids to Life"" for disadvantaged children and youths. ""They have set themselves the goal of giving young people a self-determined and fear-free future,"" said Goetze. ""The topic is very important to me and I think this fundraising action fits well with the idea behind the book."""
292,11/12/2017,17:41,Stoeger looks to reboot faltering Dortmund,Peter Stoeger starts his colossal task of arresting Borussia Dortmund's freefall down the Bundesliga table on Tuesday while former employers Cologne face a daunting trip to leaders Bayern Munich.,"Stoeger has had little time to assess Dortmund's problems ahead of his first match in charge, away to strugglers Mainz. ""In this phase, it's about talking to the boys, finding out about problem areas,"" said Stoeger, who has signed a contract until the end of the season. Dortmund are winless in their last eight league games and Stoeger's predecessor Peter Bosz was sacked on Saturday after only 167 days in charge, and following a shock 2-1 home defeat to second-from-bottom Werder Bremen. That capped a disastrous series of results that saw Dortmund drop from top of the league to eighth. Stoeger, who described his appointment as a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity, is now tasked with rebooting Dortmund's failing season that has also seen them eliminated from the Champions League. The Austrian, himself sacked by Cologne only a week ago, has had only Monday's training session to prepare for the trip to Mainz, themselves winless in their last three games and just above the relegation places. Stoeger's immediate concerns are shoring up a leaking defence which has conceded 16 goals in the last six league games, plus coaxing goals from a misfiring attack. On Wednesday, Bayern, who hold an eight-point lead at the top, will look to pick up a 13th win in their 14 games since Jupp Heynckes took charge. Germany defender Mats Hummels is struggling with illness, while goalkeeper Sven Ulreich is recovering from a groin strain that saw him miss Saturday's 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Cologne, 12 points from safety, are chasing a first league win this season after the heartbreak of throwing away a three-goal lead in Sunday's 4-3 defeat at home to Freiburg.

293,10/12/2017,13:08,"Dortmund sack Bosz, Stoeger takes over as head coach","Borussia Dortmund sacked Peter Bosz as head coach on Sunday and replaced him with Austrian Peter Stoeger, who was only fired by Bundesliga bottom side Cologne last weekend.","Dutchman Bosz, 54, was fired after just 167 days in charge as Dortmund's 2-1 defeat at home to Werder Bremen on Saturday left them winless in their last eight league games following a miserable run of results. Bosz was dismissed just hours after the Bremen defeat, when poor defending again led to another dreadful team display, and Stoeger has little time to prepare for their next Bundesliga game at Mainz on Tuesday. Steoger has just three matches left before the winter break, with the Mainz match being followed by a league game at home to Hoffenheim next Saturday and a plum German cup third-round clash at Bayern Munich on December 20. ""We will train together today and tomorrow and the first thing will be to talk about the current problems,"" said Stoeger at Sunday's press conference. ""We want to bring some more empathy back into the group."" Stoeger, who steered Cologne to fifth in the Bundesliga last season before a disastrous winless start to 2017/18, flew straight from Vienna to Germany after being contacted by Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke on Saturday night. The call caught Stoeger by surprise. ""I wasn't planning on this, but the call changed everything,"" said the Austrian. ""You only get a chance like this once in your life and now we have to see if we can make everyone happy."" Dortmund have given Stoeger, 51, a contract until the end of the season a week after he was released by Cologne. ""We will have a talk in the summer, nothing is set in stone in life,"" said Stoeger on his short-term Dortmund deal. ""I don't need a contract until 2020 and it wouldn't have changed anything if I had signed for the next 14 days. ""We have the next six months and then we'll see what happens."" It has been a tough few months for Bosz. Dortmund held a five-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga at the end of September, but since then have sunk to seventh, 13 points behind current leaders Bayern Munich. That drop down the Bundesliga table came following terrible run of results -- including throwing away a four-goal lead to draw 4-4 with local rivals Schalke last month -- that also led to Dortmund failing to qualify from their Champions League group. ""We parted on the best of terms. I would like to thank Peter Bosz,"" said Watzke. ""The most important thing is to pick up a few points now and we'll talk about goals in the winter break."""

Magazine Sport Bild report that the decision to fire Bosz as head coach has already been taken with an announcement due to be made on Sunday. Bosz took over before the start of the season and got off to a great start as Dortmund led the league table by five points at the end of September. But they have taken just three points from three draws in their eight league games since, dropping to seventh -- out of the European places for the first time this season -- following their latest defeat. ""The first half was like nothing I have seen since I arrived at Dortmund,"" Bosz said after the loss to Bremen. ""Obviously, the players have to do their work on the pitch, but I'm the one responsible and it was really bad today."" After exiting the Champions League at the group stage, the Bundesliga defeat at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park appears to be the final straw after Bosz's position had grown increasingly precarious. Before kick-off Bosz scotched rumours that the team influenced the starting line-up, while winger Andre Schuerrle admitted the Dutchman wasn't the only one at fault for the club's dramatic dip in form. ""The coach can't do anything when we fire over the crossbar three metres in front of an empty goal,"" Schuerrle said after midfielder Shinji Kagawa blasted over in the dying stages. ""At the moment, it's a question of mentality."" Bremen went ahead when Germany Under-21 midfielder Maximilian Eggestein rifled home unmarked from the edge of the area on 26 minutes. The hosts got back on level terms on 57 minutes when Kagawa's headed cross was bundled in by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who was grappling with defender Philipp Bargfrede. But Bremen restored their lead eight minutes later through a header from Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie. Dortmund captain Marcel Schmelzer slammed the performance. ""That was impudent, it was crazy,"" fumed the defender. ""For weeks, I have been saying that we have to stop talking and act.

296,07/12/2017,01:50,Zidane struggling to shore up Madrid defence,Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane admitted injuries will force him into patching up a makeshift defence for Saturday's visit of Sevilla after Raphael Varane joined an increasing list of absentees.,"The French international limped off holding his left leg as Madrid edged out Borussia Dortmund 3-2 in a Champions League thriller on Wednesday. However, with the defending champions already having secured their place in the last 16 of the Champions League behind Tottenham Hotspur in Group H, Zidane was more concerned with how Varane's absence could affect a busy end to the year for Real. After Sevilla, Zidane's men jet off to Abu Dhabi for the Club World Cup before hosting Barcelona in the Clasico on December 23. Saturday is the French coach's primary concern, though, with Sergio Ramos, Dani Carvajal and Casemiro all suspended, while Jesus Vallejo is also sidelined by injury leaving Nacho as Real's only fit centre-back. ""With Rafa he has done some damage to himself, but we will see tomorrow when we do the scans as always,"" said Zidane. ""He won't be there Saturday that is for sure. We have to look for solutions."" Real have precious little room for error as they already trail La Liga leaders Barca by eight points. And further forward, Madrid could again be without Gareth Bale due to a calf problem. ""I feel for the injured players, today it is Rafa but that is why we have a squad,"" added Zidane. However, the French coach didn't rule out the possibility that the latest spate of injuries could force the club to reinforce the squad come January. ""We have the possibility (to sign) from January 1 and we will see what happens in these 30 days."" Injuries aside, it was another enjoyable Champions League night for Real as Cristiano Ronaldo set yet another record in the competition. The Portuguese, who is expected to pick up his fifth Ballon d'Or on Thursday, fired a spectacular effort into the top corner to become the first player to ever score in all six group games in the one season. Ronaldo's European form -- he has nine in the Champions League in total -- is in stark contrast to his struggles in La Liga, where he has scored just twice in 10 appearances this season. ""We wanted to end the group phase well with a win. I scored a great goal and got the record as well which is important, so I'm very happy,"" said Ronaldo. Madrid could face the likes of Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City, Manchester United or Liverpool in Monday's last-16 draw. However, Ronaldo believes the 12-time winners are capable of an upturn in form in the new year to carry them to a third straight Champions League title. ""It is obvious that I like playing in this competition a lot, but the most important thing is to be able to get into the next round once more,"" he said. ""Hopefully Real Madrid can win it for a third straight year."""
297,06/12/2017,22:53,Ronaldo breaks new ground as Madrid edge out Dormund,Cristiano Ronaldo became the first player to ever score in all six Champions League group games in one season as Real Madrid edged out a dispirited Borussia Dortmund 3-2 on Wednesday.,"Lucas Vazquez grabbed the winner nine minutes from time for the European champions, who were already guaranteed to go through to the last 16 as runners-up in Group H to Tottenham Hotspur. Ronaldo took his tally to nine goals in six Europan appearances this season with a spectacular long-range effort into the top corner after Borja Mayoral's opener gave Real a 2-0 lead inside 12 minutes. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang continued his excellent record against Madrid with a quickfire double either side of half-time to bring Dortmund level. But despite Vazquez's late strike, the Germans drop into the Europa League with a record low two points thanks to their better goal difference over APOEL Nicosia, who were defeated 3-0 at Spurs. Real were, though, hit by a fresh injury blow as Raphael Varane limped off just before half-time. Zinedine Zidane now faces a defensive crisis ahead of the visit of Sevilla on Saturday with captain Sergio Ramos, right-back Dani Carvajal and holding midfielder Casemiro all suspended. Zidane made six changes from the side that started Saturday's 0-0 draw at Athletic Bilbao, but the hosts still made a flying start. Ronaldo's fine through ball just evaded Isco, but fell perfectly into the path of Mayoral and the 20-year-old kept his cool to chip the onrushing Roman Burki for his first Champions League goal. By contrast, Ronaldo had his 114th in the competition moments later as he lined up a sumptuous strike from 25 yards. However, the warning signs of a Dortmund recovery were in evidence as the first-half wore on as Varane had to make last-ditch challenges to deny Aubameyang and Shinji Kagawa. Aubameyang has spoken openly of his desire to play for Madrid one day and did his case of a dream move no harm with two classy finishes either side of half-time. Once Varane limped off, Aubameyang was left free inside the box to plant a diving header inside the far corner two minutes before half-time. And just four minutes after the break Dortmund were level as Aubameyang dinked a lovely finish over Keylor Navas after his initial effort had been saved by the Madrid goalkeeper. Ronaldo was wrongly denied his second of the night by the offside flag as he prodded home from close range. But moments later Madrid did grab the winner when Vazquez's effort trundled past Burki, who was slow to react as the ball nestled in the bottom corner. Dortmund should still have earned a share of the points, but Kagawa blasted a glorious chance over the bar as the German giants' run without a win in the Champions League or Bundesliga stretched to 11 games."

The best Dortmund can hope for is to hold onto third place in the group to qualify for the Europa League's knock-out rounds -- and could become the first club to ever do so with just two points. With only one win in their last ten games in all competitions, the pressure continues to mount on head coach Bosz. His list of walking wounded is also growing with Mario Goetze, Maximilian Philipp and Gonzalo Castro out for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, Bosz is resisting the temptation to play Reus, who must wait a little longer for his comeback from a knee injury in May. ""It will not be Marco Reus,"" replied Bosz when asked who will provide Dortmund's goals. ""But we need a win -- even at Real Madrid,"" added the Dutchman, whose demeanour suggests he is feeling the strain. Club bosses have said they trust Bosz to turn things around and the goal he has been set is clear -- qualify for the Europa League. ""We want to keep playing in Europe, so a draw would be a cool number for us,"" said CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke before flying to Madrid. ""There are mixed feelings, normally a game like this would be an absolute highlight. ""At the moment, both teams have their problems, we are sixth and Real are fourth,"" Watzke added with a glance at the respective Bundesliga and La Liga tables. Dortmund are still waiting for a win at the Bernabeu after two draws and four defeats on previous visits. However, Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane is expected to rest some of his stars with Real already through."
299,02/12/2017,20:09,"Philipp, Castro add to Dortmund's injury woes",Borussia Dortmund are set to be without midfielders Maximilian Philipp and Gonzalo Castro for the foreseeable future after the pair picked up serious injuries on Saturday.,"Dortmund already have German World Cup winner Mario Goetze sidelined for the next six weeks with damaged ankle ligaments. Peter Bosz's team have plunged from first in the Bundesliga to sixth following a winless run that stretched to seven matches after Saturday's 1-1 draw at 10-man Bayer Leverkusen. Kevin Volland's first-half goal for Leverkusen was cancelled out by a late equaliser from Dortmund winger Andrey Yarmolenko as the visitors struggled to break down Bayer, who had Wendell sent off after 40 minutes. The Brazilian left-back was dismissed after catching Castro flush on the ankle with a dreadful tackle, while Philipp had to be stretchered off after injuring his right knee with just five minutes gone in Leverkusen. ""Of course, it hurts that we are very likely to have two serious injuries,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc. ""Especially with Maximilian Philipp, it does not look good and we suspect a serious knee injury. ""In Gonzalo Castro, it seems to be that he has a torn ligament. Both lads will be out for a long time."" Dortmund last won a Bundesliga game at the end of September. They face Champions League holders Real Madrid away on Wednesday with only a place in the Europa League to play for as they go into the final round of matches third in their group. Despite German media reports linking Hoffenheim coach Julian Nagelsmann to Dortmund, Zorc insisted they are not talking to anyone about replacing Dutchman Bosz. ""No, we want to make the turnaround with Peter Bosz. That is our most urgent task,"" added Zorc."
300,27/11/2017,16:26,Götze injury blow for Dortmund,"Borussia Dortmund's creative midfielder Mario Götze has been sidelined for at least six weeks with ankle ligament damage, the troubled Bundesliga club said on Monday.","Since establishing a five-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga in September Dortmund have not won a league game, and infamously threw away a 4-0 lead over bitter rivals Schalke this weekend. One bright aspect of their season so far had however been the gradual return to form of the man who scored the winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final, the now 25-year-old Götze. ""Bad news everyone: Midfielder @mariogoetze sustained partial ligament tears in his upper and lower ankle in the Bundesliga match against on Saturday,"" the club said on Twitter beneath a photo of the baby-faced former Bayern Munich man clutching his right ankle in agony. Since Götze returned to Dortmund from Bayern he has struggled with a serious and debilitating metabolism disorder he discovered he had in March and from which he only began to recover fully in August. Blessed with lightening instincts and a first touch of rare quality, Götze scored for Dortmund on Saturday and appeared to be recapturing the kind of dazzling form that enabled him to score his astonishing World Cup final goal. Dutch coach Peter Bosz, formerly of Ajax, is rumoured to have a single match to save his job ahead of Saturday's clash at Bayer Leverkusen."
301,26/11/2017,01:55,Derby draw 'hurts' Bosz as Dortmund blow four-goal lead,"Under-fire Borussia Dortmund coach Peter Bosz admitted Saturday's 4-4 draw at home to Schalke ""hurt"", after his side surrendered a four-goal lead to their derby rivals in the Bundesliga.","Dortmund were on course for a thumping win after racing into a 4-0 lead with only 25 minutes gone, but the hosts collapsed in the second half after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was sent off for a second yellow card. After Aubameyang opened the scoring, an own goal by Schalke midfielder Benjamin Stambouli, plus a Mario Goetze header and volley from Raphael Guerreiro gave Dortmund a commanding lead to leave Schalke stunned. But the second half was a totally different story. Guido Burgstaller and Amine Harit clawed goals back for Schalke before the hosts had Aubameyang sent off in the 72nd minute for a second yellow card. Borussia's collapse was completed when Daniel Caligiuri blasted home to make it 4-3 late on before Naldo's late header delighted travelling fans and stunned the hosts as Schalke came back from the dead. ""It's hard because you can only feel disappointment in your body,"" Bosz told Sky, as the draw left Dortmund winless in their last six league games. ""That shouldn't have happened when you play so well and put in a convincing display with a strong performance. ""In the second half we should have scored a fifth goal through Aubameyang, but it shouldn't happen that you are pulled back to 4-4, even with the red card. ""We stopped playing football and didn't use our room."" Bosz said Aubameyang deserved his red card after barging goal-scorer Harit off the ball. ""That shouldn't have happened, he wanted to help, but that was too aggressive, especially as he already had a yellow,"" fumed Bosz. Dortmund finished the game with no forwards after Bosz took off winger Andriy Yarmolenko, Goetze came off injured and Aubameyang was dismissed. Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke and director of sport Michael Zorc have backed Bosz, but each passing week without a win further undermines his position. Dortmund's 2-1 home defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday ended their hopes of reaching the last 16 of the Champions League, but the team are backing their boss, despite being booed off by their own fans. ""The fact is we stand behind the coach, it is clear that there will be discussions out of this and everything will be criticised,"" said midfielder Nuri Sahin. ""The fact that the fans whistled us, which is completely understandable. ""However, if we had won the game, all the talk would be about the tactical genius of our coach. We took Schalke apart in the first half."" The result leaves Schalke third in the table, three points ahead of fifth-placed Dortmund, and protects the Royal Blues' unbeaten run, having now gone eight games without defeat. ""It was a very difficult phase at the start for us, in which Dortmund overran us and they seemed to score from every shot at goal,"" said Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco. In a bid to avert a debacle, Tedesco brought on midfielders Leon Goretzka and 20-year-old Harit on 34 minutes, which turned the tide. ""We had our backs to the wall and we needed a lot of changes,"" said the Schalke coach. ""Our goal was just to win the second half, realistically you don't play for a 4-4 draw, but after we got back to 4-3, we all believed in it. ""Schalke has proven that they have the mentality and the character to be able to offer a spectacle. ""That was a big step in the right direction and is the reason why we're happy."""

It was an unhappy return for Heynckes to Moenchengladbach, where he spent most of his playing career and where his family home is. Gladbach had an early setback when Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer was stretchered off following a nasty clash of heads with team-mate Jannik Vestergaard. A first-half penalty converted by Thorgan Hazard, after a Niklas Suele handball, put Gladbach ahead. They went into the break 2-0 up at Borussia Park when Lars Stindl's pass was converted by Matthias Ginter to the delight of the home fans. Heynckes responded by bringing on Austrian midfielder Marco Friedl, 19, for his Bundesliga debut, winger Kingsley Coman and adding an extra striker alongside Robert Lewandowski in Kwasi Okyere Wriedt. Bayern managed to pull a goal back when Chile international Arturo Vidal fired in a long-range shot on 74 minutes which Yann Sommer got a glove to, but couldn't prevent from rolling into the net. With time almost up, late replacement striker Josip Drmic fired wide as Gladbach held on for the win. It is only Bayern's second league defeat this season, having also lost 2-0 at Hoffenheim in September, but they still hold a three-point lead at the top of the table. Gladbach move up to fourth, level on 24 points with third-placed Schalke, who came from four-goals down to draw at ten-man Dortmund as a dramatic Ruhr derby finished 4-4. Centre-back Naldo completed Schalke's stunning four-goal fightback with a 94th-minute header. The hosts were shell-shocked as Dortmund had raced into a 4-0 lead with 25 minutes gone after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang opened the scoring. An own goal by Schalke midfielder Benjamin Stambouli, a Mario Goetze header and a Raphael Guerreiro volley followed to give Dortmund a commanding lead. However, after Guido Burgstaller and Amine Harit clawed goals back for Schalke, the hosts had Aubameyang sent off in the 72nd minute for a second yellow card. Borussia's collapse was completed when Daniel Caligiuri blasted home to make it 4-3 late on before Naldo's late header delighted the travelling fans and stunned the hosts. Dortmund coach Peter Bosz is under increasing pressure as his fifth-placed side are now winless in their last six league games dating back to late September. ""It's hard, you only feel disappointment,"" said the Dutchman, clearly stunned by his team's collapse. ""When you lead 4-0, that shouldn't have happened. ""After the red card, we didn't play any more football, lost the ball too quickly and didn't use our room, but I don't want to look for excuses."" Elswehere, RB Leipzig remained second after their 2-0 win at home to second-from-bottom Werder Bremen with goals from Liverpool-bound midfielder Naby Keita and Brazilian defender Bernardo. Bayer Leverkusen moved up to sixth with a 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt with Germany forward Kevin Volland scoring the winner. Michael Gregoritsch and Alfred Finnbogason scored for mid-table Augsburg as they came from behind to seal a 2-1 win over ten-man Wolfsburg, who had Maximilian Arnold sent off after only 11 minutes.

303,25/11/2017,20:55,Bayern suffer first defeat under Heynckes,"Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich suffered their first defeat since Jupp Heynckes returned as head coach when they fell to a 2-1 loss at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday, while Borussia Dortmund blew a four-goal lead to draw the Ruhr derby with Schalke.","Before losing at Gladbach, Bayern had won all nine games since Heynckes, 72, took over for his fourth stint at the club in October in the wake of Carlo Ancelotti's dismissal. It was an unhappy return for Heynckes to Moenchengladbach, where he spent most of his playing career and where his family home is. Gladbach had an early setback when Germany midfielder Christoph Kramer was stretchered off following a nasty clash of heads with team-mate Jannik Vestergaard. A first-half penalty converted by Thorgan Hazard, after a Niklas Suele handball, put Gladbach ahead. They went into the break 2-0 up at Borussia Park when Lars Stindl's pass was converted by Matthias Ginter to the delight of the home fans. Heynckes responded by bringing on Austrian midfielder Marco Friedl, 19, for his Bundesliga debut, winger Kingsley Coman and adding an extra striker alongside Robert Lewandowski in Kwasi Okyere Wriedt. Bayern managed to pull a goal back when Chile international Arturo Vidal fired in a long-range shot on 74 minutes which Yann Sommer got a glove to, but couldn't prevent from rolling into the net. With time almost up, late replacement striker Josip Drmic fired wide as Gladbach held on for the win. It is only Bayern's second league defeat this season, having also lost 2-0 at Hoffenheim in September, but they still hold a three-point lead at the top of the table. Gladbach move up to fourth, level on 24 points with third-placed Schalke, who came from four-goals down to draw at ten-man Dortmund as a dramatic Ruhr derby finished 4-4. Centre-back Naldo completed Schalke's stunning four-goal fightback with a 94th-minute header. The hosts were shell-shocked as Dortmund had raced into a 4-0 lead with 25 minutes gone after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang opened the scoring. An own goal by Schalke midfielder Benjamin Stambouli, a Mario Goetze header and a Raphael Guerreiro volley followed to give Dortmund a commanding lead. However, after Guido Burgstaller and Amine Harit clawed goals back for Schalke, the hosts had Aubameyang sent off in the 72nd minute for a second yellow card. Borussia's collapse was completed when Daniel Caligiuri blasted home to make it 4-3 late on before Naldo's late header delighted the travelling fans and stunned the hosts. Dortmund coach Peter Bosz is under increasing pressure as his fifth-placed side are now winless in their last six league games dating back to late September. ""It's hard, you only feel disappointment,"" said the Dutchman, clearly stunned by his team's collapse. ""When you lead 4-0, that shouldn't have happened. ""After the red card, we didn't play any more football, lost the ball too quickly and didn't use our room, but I don't want to look for excuses."" Elswehere, RB Leipzig remained second after their 2-0 win at home to second-from-bottom Werder Bremen with goals from Liverpool-bound midfielder Naby Keita and Brazilian defender Bernardo. Bayer Leverkusen moved up to sixth with a 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt with Germany forward Kevin Volland scoring the winner. Michael Gregoritsch and Alfred Finnbogason scored for mid-table Augsburg as they came from behind to seal a 2-1 win over ten-man Wolfsburg, who had Maximilian Arnold sent off after only 11 minutes. That was Wolfsburg's first defeat under new coach Martin Schmidt since losing to Stuttgart in September."
304,25/11/2017,18:36,Naldo saves Schalke in eight-goal derby thriller,Former Borussia Dortmund player Naldo sealed Schalke's thrilling four-goal fightback against his old club with a 94th-minute header that saw the Ruhr derby finish in a frantic 4-4 draw.,"Brazilian defender Naldo's last gasp header brought Schalke back from the dead against troubled, 10-man local rivals Dortmund after going four down after just 25 minutes to snatch a dramatic Bundesliga point. Schalke, who are unbeaten since September, are third in the table, three points ahead of fourth-placed Dortmund, and five behind leader Bayern Munich, who play later at Borussia Moenchengladbach. The hosts had Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang sent off in the 72nd minute for two yellow cards with the score 4-2 after giving Dortmund an early lead, but Borussia's defence collapsed in the second-half. Aubameyang had broken his five-game goal drought in the 2-1 Champions League defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday The disastrous defeat increases the pressure on head coach Peter Bosz after leaving Dortmund winless in their last six league games. The biggest win in a Ruhr derby -- 10-0 to Schalke in 1940 -- looked under threat when Dortmund raced into a 4-0 lead. Christian Pulisic's cross was flicked on by Nuri Sahin to the far post where Aubameyang slid the ball home on 12 minutes. Dortmund doubled the lead six minutes later when Sahin's free-kick was volleyed into his own net by Schalke midfielder Benjamin Stambouli, who was then beaten for pace on the flank by Aubameyang, before the Gabon international fired in a superb cross for Mario Goetze to head in the third on 20 minutes. Schalke looked dead and buried when Raphael Guerreiro volleyed home Dortmund's fourth with just 25 minutes on the clock. In a bid to avert a debacle, Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco brought on midfielders Leon Goretzka and 20-year-old Amine Harit on 34 minutes, which tightened things in the middle, and after coming to their senses, it was a totally different story for Schalke in the second-half. The away side won their tackles and pulled their first goal back when Stambouli's long floated pass was headed home by striker Guido Bergstaller on 61 minutes. Harit made it 4-2 four minutes later, taking advantage of terrible defending to fire home at close range. Schalke were now attacking in waves, and Aubameyang was given his marching orders on 72 minutes after clattering Harit and being given his second booking. Dortmund were holding on by their fingernails by the time midfielder Daniel Caligiuri buried Schalke's third on 86 minutes in a frantic finale that included seven minutes of stoppage time. Schalke deservedly got their equaliser when Naldo escaped his marker at a corner and powered home his header, sparking wild celebrations among the travelling fans. Tensions boiled over after the leveller and both Sahin and Schalke captain Ralf Faehrmann received yellow cards after the final whistle as both teams got into a shoving match. Elswehere, RB Leipzig remain second after their 2-0 win at home to second-from-bottom Werder Bremen with goals from Liverpool-bound midfielder Naby Keita and Brazilian defender Bernardo. Bayer Leverkusen moved up to sixth with a 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt with Germany forward Kevin Volland scoring the winner. Michael Gregoritsch and Alfred Finnbogason scored for mid-table Augsburg as they came from behind to seal a 2-1 win over ten-man Wolfsburg, who had Maximilian Arnold sent off after only 11 minutes.

305,24/11/2017,01:55,Struggling Dortmund face must-win Ruhr derby,"Crisis-hit Borussia Dortmund will look to get their crumbling season back on the rails when they face arch rivals Schalke 04 in the Bundesliga on Saturday, as coach Peter Bosz fights to keep his job.","Elsewhere, Bayern Munich hope to consolidate their grip on top spot with a win at Borussia Moenchengladbach, while RB Leipzig host Werder Bremen. This weekend, though, all eyes will be on the Ruhr derby, as Dortmund host Schalke. Dortmund have not won a league game since September, and have lost five of their last nine in all competitions, leaving their hopes of challenging for the title in tatters. Having held a five-point lead at the top of the table earlier in the season, Dortmund are now nine points behind leaders Bayern, having slipped down to fifth place. Among those to have overtaken them are local rivals Schalke, who have climbed up to second, adding even more spice to Saturday's derby. While Dortmund have been the dominant force in the Ruhr in recent years, the German media are now cautiously predicting a shift in power towards Schalke. In terms of both points and pride, the derby is a must-win game for Dortmund. ""We have to win on Saturday. We simply have to win,"" said Bosz after Dortmund's defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday. Bosz is under immense pressure to turn things around, his job security dwindling with every defeat. At the beginning of the week, Bild reported that the Dutchman had two games to save himself. Having been knocked out of the Champions League, Saturday's derby may be his last stand. Captain Marcel Schmelzer, however, said that the players, not the coach, were responsible for Dortmund's calamitous defending and ineffective attack. ""We're completely behind Peter Bosz,"" said Schmelzer on Tuesday. ""We as players are responsible. The coach prepares us for every opponent, but we are responsible for what happens on the pitch."" While Dortmund have struggled, Schalke have quietly found form, surging up the standings on the back of a six-game unbeaten run. Schalke's last defeat in a competitive match came back in September and now lead the chasing pack behind Bayern. Victory against Dortmund would see them move six points clear of their local rivals. ""Dortmund's current situation won't play a decisive role,"" goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann told Kicker. ""The derby is always like a cup game, a knockout game. ""It's a lot about how much heart you have, and we have heart."" Faehrmann and his team will be further heartened by the prospective return of midfield star Leon Goretzka. Sidelined for the last four weeks, Goretzka returned to training on Wednesday, and hopes to make his Bundesliga return in the derby. Elsewhere, Bayern look to bounce back from a difficult week when they travel to Moenchengladbach. Despite winning a ninth game in a row under Jupp Heynckes, Wednesday's 2-1 victory over Anderlecht was an unhappy occasion for Bayern, with both Arjen Robben and Thiago Alcantara picking up injuries. The pair join Manuel Neuer, Thomas Muller and Franck Ribery on Bayern's star-studded injury list, leaving Heynckes with limited options against Gladbach. Sebastian Rudy and Corentin Tolisso are both expected to start on Saturday. Fellow title contenders RB Leipzig, meanwhile, will be full of confidence after their 4-1 win in Monaco on Tuesday. Six points behind Bayern, Leipzig will be looking to narrow the gap this weekend, though they too have injury problems, with Marcel Sabitzer having suffered a blow to the shoulder in midweek.

306,21/11/2017,23:22,Spurs down Dortmund to win Group H,Tottenham Hotspur won Champions League Group H after goals from Son Heung-min and Harry Kane brought Spurs back from a goal down to win 2-1 at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday.,"Kane and Son struck in 49th and the 76th minutes to take already-qualified Tottenham to 13 points and the Group H summit, after Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had broken his five-game goal drought to give Dortmund the lead in the 31st minute. Spurs are three points ahead of second-place Real Madrid and are guaranteed to top Group H with a game to spare despite Real's 6-0 drubbing of APOEL in Nicosia. Their win in Germany ends Dortmund's thin hopes of reaching the last 16 and piles pressure on Dortmund's head coach Peter Bosz, whose team are winless in their last five games. Dortmund, third but level on two points with bottom club APOEL, must now hope to hold onto a place in the Europa League knock-out stages, when they face Real away in a fortnight while Spurs host APOEL. Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino made four changes from the side that lost 2-0 to Arsenal at the weekend. England internationals Danny Rose and Harry Winks started alongside South Korea forward Son while Serge Aurier slotted in at right-back. Dortmund boss Bosz brought in French teenager Dan-Axel Zagadou at centre-back, replacing Sokratis, who is out with a rib injury. Aubameyang returned from a club suspension for coming late to training and an unauthorised video shoot. Both teams had half chances in the opening 20 minutes, with Dortmund winger Andriy Yarmolenko firing weakly at Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris before Zagadou snuffed out a cross aimed for Kane, who was bursting into Dortmund's area. Aubameyang broke his drought when he tucked away the first clear chance after Yarmolenko's superb backheel put him in behind the defence. The Gabon hotshot coolly rolled his shot past Lloris on for his first goal since October 14. Only a superb reflex save by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki blocked Kane's volley with half-time approaching, but the England star showed his class when he netted the equaliser four minutes into the second half, pouncing on a mistake after Dortmund right-back Jeremy Toljan lost the ball and tucking his shot past Burki. Spurs' tails were up and they took a deserved lead with 14 minutes left when Dele Alli laid the ball into the path of Son, whose side-footed effort hit the top corner of the net. Only a brave save from Burki denied Tottenham substitute Fernando Llorente from scoring Spurs' third with time almost up."
307,20/11/2017,20:35,Aubameyang to face Spurs as Dortmund lift suspension,Borussia Dortmund have lifted the suspension on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to allow their star striker to face Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League on Tuesday.,"Dortmund's under-fire coach Peter Bosz confirmed Aubameyang is back in the squad after he was suspended for being late to training and for an unauthorised video shoot at the club's training ground. ""Aubameyang will play. I spoke to him after the Stuttgart game and he trained with us today,"" said Bosz in a press conference on Monday. ""We have cleared the matter up and for me it is over."" The Gabon international was left out of Friday's 2-1 defeat at Stuttgart which saw the early season pacesetters drop to fifth in the Bundesliga table. Aubameyang, the Bundesliga's top scorer last season, is in a goal drought. He has 15 goals so far this season but has not scored in his last five appearances, his last goal coming on October 14. Dortmund are currently third in Group H and must beat leaders Spurs, and hope Real Madrid fail to win at APOEL, to keep alive their thin hopes of reaching the last 16. Spurs are already assured of a place in the knockout stages, but a win will see them finish as group winners. ""I see this game as a chance for us because a win is certainly not expected from us,"" admitted Bosz, who desperately needs a win to relieve the pressure with his side in free fall domestically. Another defeat to Spurs is the last thing Borussia need before Saturday's derby at home to Schalke, who are up to second in the Bundesliga. ""There is still a bad feeling after the Stuttgart game and it's important to get out of this situation as a group,"" said Germany midfielder Julian Weigl. ""We have to focus on the strengths we have."""

The Gabon international was left out of Friday's 2-1 defeat at Stuttgart which saw the early season pacesetters drop to fifth in the Bundesliga table. Aubameyang, the Bundesliga's top scorer last season, is in a goal drought. He has not added to his tally of 15 goals so far this season in his last five games, dating back to October 14. Third-placed Dortmund must beat Group H leaders Spurs and hope Real Madrid fail to win at APOEL, also on Tuesday, to keep alive their thin hopes of reaching the last 16. Spurs are already assured of a place in the knock-out stages, but a win will see them finish as group winners."
309,20/11/2017,02:10,Five reasons it has gone wrong for Dortmund,Borussia Dortmund host Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday needing a win to keep alive their slim Champions League hopes after a terrible run of form.,"Spurs visit Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park already sure of a place in the last 16, but victory will see Mauricio Pochettino's side finish top of Group H. Dortmund, who are third on two points, must beat Spurs and hope Real Madrid do not win at APOEL to maintain a chance of reaching the knock-out stage. Peter Bosz's Dortmund held a five-point lead in the Bundesliga at the end of September, but since then they have taken just one from a possible 15 points and are fifth following Friday's 2-1 defeat at Stuttgart. Here are five reasons why it has gone wrong for Dortmund: Bosz took over after Thomas Tuchel was sacked days after winning the German Cup in May for failing to see eye-to-eye with CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. Bosz, who led Ajax to last season's Europa League final defeat by Manchester United, prefers a 4-3-3 formation with striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang playing off wingers Christian Pulisic and Maximilian Philipp. However, poor defending leaves huge holes which centre-backs Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Marc Bartra struggle to fill, while Bosz has stood by goalkeeper Roman Burki despite a string of howlers. ""I prefer to work on the Plan A option,"" Bosz insisted when asked why he does not change tactics during defeats. The Gabon hot-shot is goalless in his last five games. He was suspended for Friday's loss and last scored on October 14. Aubameyang claims to be baffled by his latest suspension and Dortmund are tight-lipped. Magazine Kicker said he was late for training and failed to get permission for a video shoot last Wednesday at Dortmund's training ground. ""Aubameyang is actually an awesome lad, but he has no special rights,"" insisted Watzke. Bad behaviour is becoming a habit of Aubameyang. He was suspended for flying to a party in Milan without permission last season and upset the club by shaving the Nike logo into his hair, even though Dortmund are sponsored by Puma. He then wore a mask for a goal celebration he had donned in a Nike advert. The Dortmund keeper is inconsistent, yet Bosz perseveres with Burki even with veteran Roman Weidenfeller on the bench. In the last seven games, Burki has leaked 16 goals. He was at fault at Stuttgart after a horrendous mix-up with defender Marc Bartra led to Chadrac Akolo scoring Stuttgart's opening goal, and could have done better when Josip Brekalo fired through his legs for the second. Burki's fumble at APOEL last month led to Dortmund drawing 1-1 in the Champions League. Kevin Trapp is touted as a possible replacement for Burki in the January winter break as the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper has lost his starting spot in France. Burki's plight is not helped by playing behind a porous defence, which will invite Spurs striker Harry Kane to attack in midweek. Bosz made changes after Dortmund were routed 4-2 at Hanover 96 last month after being constantly hit on the break, but Sokratis and Bartra are still unconvincing. Sokratis' lack of pace is an issue and Bartra's error against Stuttgart was not his first in recent weeks. ""The individual mistakes have been pulling us up this season,"" said director of sport Michael Zorc. ""The first goal in Stuttgart was almost slapstick."" With every defeat, Bosz's situation grows more precarious. ""We can't talk the negative trend away, we need to ask ourselves why we can't produce the same performance from the first few games,"" said Zorc. Dortmund have been here before. They were second from bottom in December of the 2014/15 season, eventually finishing seventh, when then-coach Jurgen Klopp quit before joining Liverpool. Unlike Bosz, Klopp had credit with Watzke and Zorc after winning two league titles. German daily Bild claim Dortmund have planned crisis talks for mid-December, meaning Bosz has four weeks to turn it around."
310,18/11/2017,13:22,Dire Dortmund results pain boss Bosz,"Borussia Dortmund coach Peter Bosz admitted their third straight defeat in the Bundesliga ""hurts"" as the club's dire form continued ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash against Tottenham Hotspur.","Dortmund are winless in their last five league games, collecting just one point from a possible 15, after losing 2-1 at VfB Stuttgart on Friday. They last won a Bundesliga match in September and could finish the weekend nine points behind leaders Bayern Munich. The defeat in Stuttgart further dented fragile confidence before facing Spurs in Europe and next Saturday's derby showdown against fierce rivals Schalke. To make matters worse, star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was suspended in Stuttgart for ""disciplinary reasons"". Bosz lamented both the performance and ""ridiculous"" opening goal, which Dortmund conceded after just five minutes. ""That hurts a lot. We came here to win and so we are very disappointed,"" fumed Bosz. ""How we conceded the goals was almost ridiculous. ""We played well in the first half, but if you concede goals, then it becomes difficult. ""The players did a really good job after going behind and we tried to play football. ""We have to continue, we will not give up,"" he added with an air of desperation. Without Aubameyang and injured US international midfielder Christian Pulisic, Dortmund were on the back foot after only five minutes. A defensive mix-up between Marc Bartra and goalkeeper Roman Burki allowed Stuttgart midfielder Chadrac Akolo to score the hosts' opener. Maximilian Philipp levelled on the rebound from Andre Schurrle's missed penalty just before the break for Borussia. However, Josip Brekalo's low shot through Burki's legs in the second half sealed Stuttgart's win. After picking up just two points from their first four European matches, Dortmund could be knocked out of the Champions League in the group stage even if they beat Tottenham, should Real Madrid defeat APOEL Nicosia on Tuesday. Bosz took over at the start of the season, but after Dortmund won six of their opening seven league games, their form has nose-dived. The Dutchman is cutting an increasingly frustrated figure, but he retains the backing of Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke, for now. ""The way things are working behind the scenes is outstanding,"" said Watzke. ""He is totally honest, totally calm and relaxed, very analytical. ""You can discuss everything with him. ""He is also decisive but takes all decisions and their consequences without complaining,"" added Watzke in a thinly-veiled dig at Bosz's predecessor Thomas Tuchel. However, Bosz's situation will only become more precarious unless results improve, and Aubameyang's latest indiscretion does nothing to help. Dortmund disciplined the Gabonese striker last year for flying to a party in Milan without permission. He also fell offside with club bosses for shaving the Nike logo into his hair, even though Dortmund are sponsored by Puma. German magazine Kicker claim Aubameyang was suspended for repeatedly coming late to training and for an unauthorised video shoot at Dortmund's training ground on Wednesday. ""The suspension was disciplinary. A group needs some rules and from time to time you have to sharpen your senses,"" said Watzke. ""Aubameyang is actually an awesome lad, but he has no special rights. ""Things must be sanctioned, just like in a family or in a school class - you have to say 'stop there'. ""He is, and remains, our player."""
311,17/11/2017,13:07,Aubameyang baffled by his Dortmund punishment,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang said that he did not understand why his club, Borussia Dortmund, had suspended him for turning up late for training.","Dortmund dropped their star striker from the squad for Friday's Bundesliga match against Stuttgart. Last year, the club suspended Aubameyang for a Champions League match against Sporting Lisbon after he flew to a party in Milan without permission. ""I could understand why I was suspended for Milan because I did not respect the rules, but this time I am truly baffled. I did not want to arrive late,"" he told German newspaper Bild in an interview published on Friday. Bild said the player was suspended because he was 20 minutes late for training. German media have also speculated that he was suspended for again leaving Germany for a night out, this time in Barcelona. ""For disciplinary reasons Aubameyang will not feature in the team for tomorrow's game,"" Dortmund said Thursday on the club's Twitter account. The club made no mention of the nature of Aubameyang's misdemeanour. The Gabonese forward is the club's top marksman with 10 Bundesliga goals so far, but he has failed to score in three league games and two Champions League matches, a barren spell that has coincided with a slump by the club. After three defeats and a draw in the Bundesliga, Dortmund have seen their five-point lead atop the Bundesliga turn into a six-point deficit to bitter rivals Bayern Munich. Borussia are also heading for elimination in the Champions League."

However, Gabon hot-shot Aubameyang has drawn a blank in his last five games having now gone 476 minutes without a goal for Dortmund in all competitions. ""Everybody goes through these phases and the scorer's job is the hardest one on the pitch anyway,"" Lewandowski told German daily Bild on Tuesday. ""When you are on a good run, you score everything, but woe betide when it doesn't work and you hit the crossbar instead of the net. ""Then a lot of things go through your head. ""It's important to clear your head quickly and regain the old looseness, then I'm sure he'll be successful again."" Bayern's Lewandowski scored his 11th goal in as many league matches, one more than Aubameyang, in Saturday's 3-1 win at Dortmund. Aubameyang again failed to hit the net and Dortmund have now dropped 11 points in their last four games to go third after surrendering top spot in the Bundesliga to Bayern. Aubameyang has scored a total of 95 goals in 139 league games for Dortmund in his career and Lewandowski is backing him to break his drought soon. In the space of four weeks, Bayern have gone from trailing Dortmund by five points to holding a six-point lead over Borussia. Poland hot-shot Lewandowski, who has scored 88 goals in 107 league games for Bayern, says Dortmund are not out of the the title race. ""Six points ahead in the Bundesliga mean nothing, I have not written Borussia off,"" said Lewandowski, who played for Dortmund from 2010-14, scoring 74 goals in 131 league games."
314,04/11/2017,20:43,Bayern down Dortmund to open four-point lead,Bayern Munich stamped their authority on the Bundesliga on Saturday by opening a four-point lead as Robert Lewandowski netted an audacious goal in their commanding 3-1 win at Borussia Dortmund.,"Defending champions Bayern stay on course to win the German League for a sixth straight season after dominating the high-tempo showdown at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park. A superb curling strike from Dutch playmaker Arjen Robben on 17 minutes put Bayern head before a cheeky backheel from Lewandowski deflected off a defender on its way to the back of Dortmund's net on 37 minutes. Having missed Bayern's 2-1 win at Celtic on Tuesday in the Champions League with a thigh injury, Lewandowski claimed his 11th league goal in as many games this season and is currently the Bundesliga's top-scorer. Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the top scorer last season in Germany just ahead of Lewandowski, has now failed to score in each of his last five games, but still has 10 goals in 11 league matches. Left-back David Alaba was credited with Bayern's third goal which flew into Dortmund's net just ahead of Lewandowski's outstretched foot on 67 minutes. Defender Marc Barta, who was injured in April's bomb attack on the Dortmund team bus, scored the hosts' consolation goal two minutes from time. The win leaves Bayern unbeaten in their seven games since Jupp Heynckes took charge at the end of September. Third-placed Dortmund have now won just one of their last seven games in all competitions which has seen them surrender a five-point lead over Bayern in the league. They now trail Bayern by six points and are two behind RB Leipzig, who went second earlier with a 2-1 comeback win at home to Hanover 96. Germany striker Timo Werner, 21, who has just recovered from a neck injury, proved his form ahead of the world champions' high-profile friendly matches against England and France in the next 10 days. Werner set up Yussuf Poulsen's equaliser and then netted an 85th-minute winner after the Brazilian Jonathas had given visitors Hanover the lead at Leipzig's Red Bull Arena. The result got Leipzig back to winning ways after last week's back-to-back cup and league losses to Bayern and a 3-1 defeat at Porto in the Champions League. Elsewhere Schalke, who are now undefeated in their last six games in all competitions, climbed to fourth -- level on 20 points with neighbours Dortmund -- with a 1-0 win at Freiburg. Winger Daniel Caligiuri scored the only goal against his old club. Hamburg moved out of the bottom three with a 3-1 win at home to Stuttgart, who had midfielder Dzenis Burnic sent off after just 13 minutes for two yellow cards. Aaron Hunt put Hamburg ahead from a free-kick after a goalkeeping blunder by Ron-Robert Zieler, but Stuttgart levelled just after half-time when Daniel Ginczek converted a penalty. However, Filip Kostic put Hamburg back in front and Germany Under-17 international Jann-Fiete Arp, with his second in two games, sealed the win. Borussia Moenchengladbach dropped to seventh after their 1-1 draw at home to Mainz. Mainz took the lead on 19 minutes through French defender Abdou Diallo, but Gladbach equalised when towering Danish centre-back Jannik Vestergaard headed home midway through the second half. Mid-table Augsburg and Bayer Leverkusen shared the points in a 1-1 draw as Kevin Volland's strike just after the break was quickly cancelled out by Austrian defender Kevin Danso."

Voted Bundesliga Player of the Year in 2011, the Germany-born player made 52 appearances for Turkey and scored two goals. Turkey missed out on making the World Cup when Iceland won their group and Croatia bagged a spot in the play-offs as one of Europe's best runners-up."

Dortmund remain winless in their four Champions League games so far and must beat Tottenham Hotspur and Real Madrid in back-to-back games in order to advance. The draw leaves third-placed Dortmund and bottom side APOEL needing to bridge the five-point gap behind holders Real in order to make the last 16. Dortmund host Group H leaders Tottenham, who reached the last 16 by beating Real 3-1 in London, in three weeks when APOEL are home to Cristiano Ronaldo's Madrid. Dortmund's dire form in the last fortnight continued in what head coach Bosz had billed as a must-win game. This was another sloppy performance in defence while their attack lacked urgency. Star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang failed to score in his fourth match running. Dortmund's 5-0 German Cup, second-round, win at third-division Magdeburg last week is now their only victory in their last six games. This was neither the result nor performance Bosz wanted ahead of Saturday's crunch Bundesliga showdown at home to defending champions Bayern Munich. After creating several good chances in the opening half an hour, Dortmund took the lead when Shinji Kagawa's magic touch released Guerreiro. The left-back timed his run perfectly to get in behind the defence and calmly slot home on 29 minutes. Dortmund should have been further ahead but they were punished when, just as he did in the 1-1 draw in the away leg a fortnight ago, Benin international Pote scored for APOEL. When Dortmund defender Marc Bartra lost the ball near the touchline, the visitors counter-attack quickly. The ball fell to the burly Pote, who turned quickly in the box to power his shot past Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki on 51 minutes to stun the home crowd. The 33-year-old Pote has now scored four of APOEL's last six goals as his purple patch continues. Late on, Aubameyang had a header pushed onto the bar by APOEL goalkeeper Nauzet Perez while at the other end Ghayas Zahid fired over the Dortmund bar."
317,31/10/2017,01:50,Misfiring Dortmund reject crisis talk,"Borussia Dortmund lost their status as Bundesliga leaders and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has stopped scoring, but coach Peter Bosz denies talk of a crisis before Wednesday's Champions League tie against APOEL.","Dortmund face an uphill fight to reach the knockout stages of Europe, as they trail both Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur by six points in Group H after three matches. Defeats by Tottenham and Real, before a draw at APOEL in Nicosia a fortnight ago, have left Dortmund, Champions League finalists in 2013, facing a group-stage exit. All is not well in the Dortmund camp, despite what Bosz says. A 5-0 German Cup victory at third-division Magdeburg last week is Dortmund's only win in their last five games. ""There was no crisis - and there is no crisis - Hanover were just more aggressive than us,"" the Dutchman insisted after Saturday's 4-2 defeat at Hanover 96 saw Bayern Munich replace Dortmund at the top of the Bundesliga. To make matters worse, Aubameyang, the Bundesliga's top scorer last season, is goalless in his last three games despite netting 15 times in all competitions so far this term. Director of sport Michael Zorc said he was left ""speechless"" by the team's sudden dip in form. APOEL will fancy their chances at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park where defeat will end either team's last 16 hopes. The teams drew 1-1 in the first meeting when a blunder by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki saw Mickael Pote give APOEL a shock lead before defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos equalised with a header. On Saturday, Dortmund's shaky defence was brutally exposed by Hanover 96, who mercilessly dismantled the visitors with a series of counter-attacks. For the third league game in a row, Dortmund's 4-1-4-1 system left far too many holes to exploit. ""For the first time, we have bid farewell to top spot in the Bundesliga - that is something which is unacceptable,"" said captain Marcel Schmelzer. ""Our attitude wasn't good enough and we quickly need to find the form which has made us strong."" The German media is blaming Dortmund's struggles on Bosz's system, which the Dutch coach continues to defend. ""The questions about the system are just an alibi. It's about winning our challenges and facing the opponent in a robust way to win the second ball, that is what we are missing at the moment,"" said Zorc. In the space of two weeks, Dortmund have seen a five-point lead evaporate and they now trail Bayern by three points in Germany. Dortmund and Bosz need a win, not just to boost their fading Champions League chances, but to get their entire season back on track."
318,29/10/2017,18:45,Bayern draw holders Dortmund in German Cup,Bayern Munich have been handed another tough German Cup tie after being pitted against Borussia Dortmund in the third-round draw on Sunday.,"Having beaten fellow Bundesliga giants RB Leipzig 5-4 away on penalties when their second-round tie finished 1-1 after extra-time on Wednesday, Bayern have drawn Dortmund in a repeat of last season's semi-final. Bayern face Dortmund away on Saturday in a mouth-watering league clash after the Bavarians knocked Borussia off the top of the Bundesliga this weekend with a 2-0 home win against Leipzig when Dortmund crashed 4-2 at Hanover 96. Dortmund, the German Cup holders, beat Bayern 3-2 at Munich's Allianz Arena in last season's semi-finals on their way to winning the title with a 2-1 victory against Eintracht Frankfurt in May's final. Bayern will host Dortmund in the cup clash at the Allianz Arena on either December 19 or 20 in a repeat of the 2012, 2014 and 2016 finals. Dortmund trounced Bayern 5-2 in 2012 before the Bavarians gained revenge with a 2-0 victory in 2014, also winning two years later when the final was decided by penalties after a goalless draw. The draw has also thrown up four other all-Bundesliga clashes in the third round with Mainz v Stuttgart, Werder Bremen v Freiburg, Borussia Moenchengladbach v Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke v Cologne. German Cup - third-round fixtures Mainz v VfB Stuttgart, Nuremberg v VfL Wolfsburg, Bayern Munich v Borussia Dortmund, Heidenheim v Eintracht Frankfurt, Werder Bremen v Freiburg, Borussia Moenchengladbach v Bayer Leverkusen, Paderborn v Ingolstadt 04, Schalke v Cologne."
319,23/10/2017,14:06,Dortmund bosses hit back at 'sick' criticsm,Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watkze has hit back at 'sick' claims in the German media that the Bundesliga leaders are enduring a 'crisis' after surrendering a five-point lead.,"""When you see how Dortmund's fans celebrated with their team after the games against Leipzig and Frankfurt, it's clear there is a very different mood at the club,"" fumed Watzke. ""I am struggling to understand the way we are being covered. That is sick."" Dortmund's five-point lead at the top of the table evaporated within a week after losing 3-2 to RB Leipzig and throwing away a two-goal lead in Saturday's 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt. German daily Bild claims Dortmund are in 'crisis', with head coach Peter Bosz under pressure for using an attack-minded 4-3-3 formation which often leaves holes in defence. ""The Bosz discussion is schizophrenic!,"" fumed director of sport Michael Zorc in Bild. ""It's ridiculous that our coach should come into question even though we're top of the table."" Holders Dortmund are at third-division Magdeburg on Tuesday in the second round of the German Cup where a convincing win will boost confident. The 'crisis' claims are arguably wide of the mark, but Dortmund are struggling. They are winless in their last three games as their draw at Frankfurt, where they fielded a make-shift defence, came after an error-strewn 1-1 draw at APOEL in the Champions League, which followed the home defeat to Leipzig. Star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has failed to score in his last two games. With just one point in three Champions League games so far, Dortmund are facing an early exit and already trail Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur by six points in Group H. In the Bundesliga, defending champions Bayern Munich are now level on 20 points and second only on goal difference, following their scrappy 1-0 win in Hamburg, while third-placed Leipzig trail Dortmund by just a point. ""Bayern didn't play better against Hamburg than we did against Frankfurt, they just had more luck in their match,"" added Watzke. ""Our games against Leipzig and Frankfurt were spectacular, which is what the spectators want to see. ""It's what drives them into the stadiums. ""In the Bundesliga, there is a lot of tension, yet you'd think from the mood in the media that we are about to be relegated."" Yet the second-half in Frankfurt was ugly viewing for Dortmund fans. Goals by Dortmund midfielders Nuri Sahin and Maximilian Philipp were wiped out in a four minute spell by Frankfurt. Eintracht's French striker Sebastian Haller netted a penalty before Marius Wolf equalised. Frankfurt's midfield, let by Ghana's Kevin-Prince Boateng got the better of their Dortmund counterparts, which meant Dortmund resorted to trying to find Aubameyang with long balls. Germany midfielder Mario Goetze was the best Dortmund player in Frankfurt and Watzke says he saw 'very, very positive signs'. However, only a dominant display at Magdeburg will boost confidence with Dortmund hosting Bayern in a key Bundesliga showdown on November 4."
320,21/10/2017,19:24,Dortmund throw away two-goal lead in Frankfurt draw,Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund threw away a two-goal lead in their 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday after another mistake by goalkeeper Roman Burki triggered the hosts' fightback.,"Dortmund are winless in their last three games after also losing 3-2 at home to RB Leipzig last Saturday in the Bundesliga and drawing 1-1 at Cypriot side APOEL on Tuesday in the Champions League. On Friday, Dortmund's Swiss shot-stopper Burki extended his contract at Dortmund until 2021. It was a vote of confidence by the club after Burki endured sharp criticism for a mistake which allowed APOEL to take a shock lead in the Champions League draw. Before kick-off, sporting director Michael Zorc told Sky that Burki has Dortmund's full backing, but another mistake by their goalkeeper in Frankfurt allowed Eintracht back in the game. Goals by Turkey international Nuri Sahin and winger Maximilian Philipp either side of the break put Dortmund 2-0 up, but Eintracht roared back with two goals in four second-half minutes. French striker Sebastien Haller slotted home a penalty on 64 minutes before midfielder Marius Wolf levelled shortly after. ""That shouldn't happen, if you lead 2-0 you shouldn't allow an open game,"" said Sahin. Dortmund stay top on 20 points, just three ahead of defending champions Bayern Munich, who are at strugglers Hamburg later on Saturday, and one ahead of RB Leipzig, who won 1-0 at home to VfB Stuttgart. Frankfurt's Ante Rebic had a goal disallowed for offside just before Dortmund went in front as Marc Bartra's long-range pass was converted on 19 minutes by Sahin, who sprinted 80 metres to celebrate with Burki. Philipp had made it 2-0 when he fired home Mario Goetze's pass on 57 minutes, but Frankfurt were then handed a route back into the game when Burki brought down Rebic, and Haller fired home the spot-kick. With Dortmund's defence struggling, midfielder Wolf curled home the equaliser on 68 minutes. In pushing to restore the lead, Dortmund gave a Bundesliga debut to 17-year-old ex-Manchester City midfielder Jadon Sancho, who was released by England from the Under-17 World Cup in India. Frankfurt's point could have come at a price as USA wide man Timothy Chandler limped off with a knee injury on 37 minutes. Dortmund coach Peter Bosz defended his decision to bring on defender Dan-Axel Zagadou for Germany midfielder Julian Weigl -- converted to a centre-back to cover for injuries -- just before Frankfurt scored twice. ""We simply weren't really playing at that point, so I took off a defender. We wanted some calm,"" explained the Dutchman. ""We had lots of chances to go 3-0 up -- we just didn't take them."" RB Leipzig, who face Bayern twice next week -- at home on Wednesday in the German Cup, then away next Saturday in the Bundesliga -- followed their midweek Champions League victory over Porto with a narrow win against Stuttgart. Midfielder Marcel Sabitzer netted the winner midway through the first half when his shot looped over Stuttgart's Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler. Meanwhile, Bayer Leverkusen are ninth after a stunning 5-1 romp at Borussia Moenchengladbach. US international Fabian Johnson gave Gladbach a seventh-minute lead after meeting Thorgan Hazard's cross at the far post. However, Leverkusen roared back with five second-half goals, four of which came in a dazzling 21-minute spell, through Sven Bender, Leon Bailey, Julian Brandt, Kevin Volland and Joel Pohjanpalo. Michael Gregoritsch's long-range shot gave Augsburg a first-half lead at home against Hanover 96, but substitute Niclas Fuellkrug scored two second-half goals as the visitors came back to win 2-1."
321,13/10/2017,15:24,Dortmund 'ultras' plan Red Bull protest,"Borussia Dortmund's 'ultras' will stage an ""anti-Red Bull"" march before their game against Leipzig on Saturday, and police aim to avoid the ugly scenes which marred their last meeting in the Ruhr.","In February, Dortmund ultras blocked the Leipzig players' bus on the way to the stadium, and during the game they chanted and waved banners calling for violence. Ten people, including four policemen, were injured as Leipzig fans were attacked. ""Red Bull, get lost - football belongs to us"", read a poster publicising the protest in Dortmund, while the ultras' website urged fans to demonstrate. The Austrian drinks brand is accused by some of using football for the sole purpose of advertising, and is often the target of anger from the Bundesliga's most fanatical supporters. The German Football Association punished Dortmund by ordering the closure of the rowdy ""Yellow Wall"" section for a match, but in Leipzig's following game, fans of Borussia Moenchengladbach unfurled banners in solidarity with Dortmund. This time, police have planned a massive deployment. ""Those who want to challenge or attack our visitors will find us on the way,"" police officer Edzard Freyhoff said. ""Our threshold of intervention will be very low."" Regional police chief Gregor Lange added: ""We have to protect the supporters of Leipzig and Dortmund from violent elements and criminals, who do not deserve to be called fans."" Two groups of supporters issued a joint statement online explaining their position: ""We will never accept a multi-national company to use football to publicise it. ""In the stadium, our motto will be the same as last year: to show that no money in the world can buy fanaticism, fidelity or a culture of supporters."" RB Leipzig, who shot up from the German fifth tier to the Bundesliga in seven years thanks to Red Bull's investments, won over some support from the general public last season by being the only team to challenge Bayern Munich, finishing in second place."
322,30/09/2017,18:14,Dortmund go clear despite Aubameyang penalty howler,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's miserable week continued as he missed a penalty but Borussia Dortmund still ground out a 2-1 win at Augsburg on Saturday to extend their Bundesliga lead.,"Star striker Aubameyang followed on from his poor performance in Tuesday's 3-1 Champions League defeat at home to Real Madrid by firing a weak penalty straight at Augsburg goalkeeper Marwin Hitz 10 minutes from time. Despite last season's Bundesliga top-scorer squandering the chance to kill off the game, Dortmund held on as goals from Andriy Yarmolenko and Japan's Shinji Kagawa either side of Caiuby's equaliser sent Borussia five points clear at the top. It was a controversial penalty awarded by the video assistant referee (VAR) after referee Marco Korb missed a foul by Koo Ja-Cheol, South Korea's ex-captain, on Lukasz Piszczek. That came after the VAR had earlier failed to award Augsburg a penalty when Dortmund's Sokratis clearly tugged at the shirt of Brazil midfielder Caiuby. Dortmund had taken the lead after just four minutes through winger Yarmolenko before Caiuby headed an equaliser. Kagawa scored what proved to be the winner on 23 minutes with a dream goal when he floated a shot over Hitz following good work from Gabon's Aubameyang and Yarmolenko. ""We're happy with the result, but that was the worst performance since I became Dortmund coach,"" said Borussia boss Peter Bosz. ""We didn't play good football, and it was even worse after the break. ""Every team has about two such games like that per season, which they normally lose."" The result left Dortmund five points clear of Hoffenheim, who are at Freiburg on Sunday, and six ahead of defending champions Bayern Munich, who play Hertha Berlin. Former full-back Willy Sagnol will lead Bayern after Carlo Ancelotti was sacked in the wake of Wednesday's 3-0 defeat at Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League. Elsewhere, Belgium's Thorgan Hazard netted a 94th-minute penalty winner, awarded by the VAR, in Borussia Moenchengladbach's 2-1 home victory over Hanover 96. Austria international Martin Harnik equalised for Hanover after Mathias Ginter, a member of Germany's 2014 World Cup-winning squad, stabbed the hosts ahead in the second-half. Hanover, who suffered their first defeat this season, stay fourth while Moenchengladbach climb to sixth. Frenchman Sebastien Haller scored 10-man Eintracht Frankfurt's dramatic 93rd-minute winner to seal a 2-1 victory at home to VfB Stuttgart. Frankfurt had French defender Simon Falette sent off for bringing down striker Simon Terodde when he was through on goal after 65 minutes. Just four minutes earlier, Terodde had equalised with a header after Ante Rebic had given the hosts a first-half lead. Japan international Yoshinori Muto earned Mainz a 1-1 draw at Wolfsburg. Josuha Guilavogui had scored for Wolves, who had France's Paul-Georges Ntep sent off deep into injury time. The north German derby ended in a goalless draw as hosts Hamburg, who were founded 130 years ago, held arch rivals Werder Bremen on their anniversary celebrations."

The result leaves Real top of Group H, just ahead of Tottenham Hotspur, who beat APOEL 3-0 away, with Dortmund third and six points adrift of Spurs, who they also lost 3-1 to in London. Having also netted twice against APOEL, Ronaldo has now scored four goals in just two Champions League games this season. He marked his 400th appearance for Madrid in total with another pair to leave him with 411 goals in the famous white shirt. This is the first time Dortmund have lost at home to Real in seven European games while holders Madrid have now scored in 38 successive Champion League games. Dortmund should have been awarded a penalty with 13 minutes gone when Sergio Ramos cleared Maximilian Philipp's shot off the line and the ball deflected off his hand. Andrey Yarmolenko's initial cross sailed tantalisingly over the head of Borussia's top-scorer Aubameyang in the build up. Real took the lead three minutes later when right-back Daniel Carvajal whipped in a cross and Bale's nonchalant volley sailed over Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki for a stunning goal. With half an hour gone, Dortmund turned the screw with Carvajal having to rescue Real by whipping the ball off Aubameyang's toes with the Gabon striker bearing down on goal. Aubameyang had the ball in the net on 38 minutes, when he spun and fired home Lukasz Piszczek's pass, but the goal was ruled offside as it stayed 1-0 to Real at the break. Real lived dangerously after the break when Mario Goetze tried to find Aubameyang, but centre-back Raphael Varane cleared the danger. The Spanish giants doubled their lead on 49 minutes when Ronaldo met Bale's inch-perfect cross. Dortmund pulled a goal back on 54 minutes when Aubameyang slipped his marker to convert Gonzalo Castro's cross, then hit the side netting as Borussia pushed for the equaliser. With 15 minutes left, Burki had to push Isco's shot around the post as Real kept the pressure. Ronaldo, who was left in acres of space, settled the tie by blasting home Luka Modric's cross on 79 minutes with Madrid's third goal on the break to take the game out of Dortmund's grasp."

Scoring three goals in a 6-1 rout of Borussia Moenchengladbach lifted his Dortmund tally to 132 from 198 games.
326,25/09/2017,01:35,Dortmund out to ruin Ronaldo milestone,Borussia Dortmund will aim to maintain their unbeaten record at home to Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday and spoil Cristiano Ronaldo's 150th European appearance.,"Dortmund and title holders Real meet in the group stage for the second year running. The teams drew both games 2-2 last season as the Germans topped the section before bowing out in the last eight while Real went on to win a record 12th title. Dortmund have won three and drawn three of their meetings at Signal Iduna Park, including their dazzling 4-1 first-leg win in the 2013 Champions League semi-final when Robert Lewandowski scored all four goals. Defending champions Real opened their group campaign with a 3-0 win at home to APOEL while Dortmund suffered a 3-1 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur a fortnight ago. The Germans' main task will be containing four-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo, who has scored 110 goals in European competition but failed to find the net in his last two outings. The Portuguese superstar is among the final three nominees for the Best FIFA Men's Player 2017 award and the winner will be announced on October 23. Dortmund flexed their muscles ahead of the heavyweight showdown with a 6-1 home drubbing of Borussia Moenchengladbach in the German league on Saturday as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted a hat-trick. The Gabon striker has now scored eight goals in six league games. He has forged a partnership -- dubbed 'Philameyang' by the German media -- with left-winger Maximilian Philipp, who has scored four goals in his last three games. ""Things couldn't have gone better,"" beamed Dortmund's World Cup winner Mario Goetze, who is back in form after a metabolic disorder, following the Gladbach win. ""However, we know that it will be a mammoth task against Real on Tuesday."" While Dortmund shone in attack, they struggled at the back against Gladbach, who had half a dozen clear chances to score which went begging. Zinedine Zidane's Real are unlikely to be as forgiving. ""Against Real, mistakes like that will be punished totally differently,"" warned Dortmund director Michael Zorc. Dortmund's big win came with forwards Marco Reus, Andre Schuerrle and Raphael Guerreiro injured while new signing Andriy Yarmolenko, Nuri Sahin and Gonzalo Castro were not used. Real traditionally have a terrible record in Germany with 19 defeats, seven draws and only five wins. However, four of those victories have come in their last seven visits and they enjoyed a 2-1 win at Bayern Munich in last season's quarter-finals. Madrid's run of scoring in 73 successive matches in all competitions ended when they lost 1-0 at home to Real Betis on 20 September. But they rebounded with a 2-1 win at Alaves on Saturday as Dani Ceballos scored his first goals for Madrid on his first competitive start. Zidane is without a left-back as Marcelo (hamstring) and Theo Hernandez (shoulder) are both out, so Nacho is set to fill in. Karim Benzema is missing with a hamstring injury, but Luka Modric and Gareth Bale were both rested at the weekend and Toni Kroos is expected to return after injury."
327,20/09/2017,22:55,Kagawa leads Dortmund 'fire engine' back to Bundesliga top spot,Borussia Dortmund returned to the top of the Bundesliga on Wednesday after easing to a 3-0 victory over Hamburg with Japanese star Shinji Kagawa getting the scoring underway.,"Kagawa gave Dortmund the lead from close range on 25 minutes, and both Christian Pulisic and Andriy Yarmolenko had chances to double the advantage before half-time. With just over an hour played, Yarmolenko surged forward on the counter attack to set up a goal for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The Gabonese striker tapped the ball in from less than a metre in front of goal, scoring his fourth and no doubt easiest goal of the season so far. ""We set off like the fire service on an emergency call at the beginning,"" said Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki. ""It was really important that we got the second goal."" American international Pulisic secured victory in the 80th minute, netting Dortmund's third from inside the penalty area. ""It wasn't an easy game today, because Hamburg put us under pressure,"" Dortmund coach Peter Bosz told Sky Sports. ""Only a good team can win games like this one, and we deserved to win today."" Dortmund, who have yet to concede a goal in five games this season, are now a point clear of Bayern Munich, who remain second after surprise package Hanover failed to win in Freiburg. The promoted side remain unbeaten this season, but were denied the opportunity to leapfrog Bayern by a late Nils Petersen equaliser. After Florian Niederlechner had missed a penalty for Freiburg early in the second half, Martin Harnik gave Hanover the lead in the 66th minute. Petersen's close range effort saved a point for the home side with seven minutes to play. Hanover now drop to fourth after an injury time goal from Mark Uth saw Hoffenheim beat Mainz 3-2 despite trailing 2-0 early in the game. Goals from Danny Latza and Yoshinori Muto put Mainz 2-0 up after just 16 minutes, but Hoffenheim rallied quickly. Nadiem Amiri pulled a goal back on 23 minutes, before a Sandro Wagner header drew them level on the stroke half-time. With just seconds left on the clock, Uth picked up a loose ball behind the back line to complete a brilliant comeback for Hoffenheim, who move into third. At the other end of the table, Cologne are still searching for their first points of the season after suffering a 1-0 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt. A first half penalty from Sebastien Haller was enough to secure three points for Frankfurt. Europa League participants Cologne have now lost all of their first five games, and remain rooted to the bottom of the table. ""We need to shake off the mistakes we made today and start preparing for Sunday's game,"" said Cologne coach Peter Stoeger. Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen's early season woes continued with a 2-1 defeat to Hertha Berlin. Mathew Leckie gave Hertha the lead on 16 minutes, curling the ball brilliantly into the top corner, and Salomon Kalou doubled the lead shortly afterwards. An 84th minute strike from Julian Brandt proved too little too late for Leverkusen."
328,18/09/2017,14:26,Dortmund crush Cologne amidst controversy,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice in a minute as Borussia Dortmund went back atop of the Bundesliga on Sunday after a 5-0 hammering of Cologne, who fumed over a controversial goal.","After losing at Tottenham Hotspur in midweek in the Champions League, Dortmund needed just 111 seconds to take the lead at home. Winger Andrey Yarmolenko fired in a cross which was headed home by fellow new-signing Maximilian Philipp. On the stroke of half-time, Cologne goalkeeper Timo Horn fumbled a cross and defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos tapped home the loose ball to make it 2-0 at the break. There were furious protests from Cologne, as replays showed the whistle went before the goal was scored, but it stood even after the video assistant referee (VAR) checked. ""We will not sign off on the match log and will protest immediately,"" said Cologne's manager Joerg Schmadtke. ""That was clearly a wrong decision which decided the game."" Aubameyang slotted home a penalty after the VAR spotted a hand-ball on 59 minutes and just 58 seconds later the Gabon striker bagged his second from a Lukasz Piszczek's pass. Aubameyang, last season's top scorer in the Bundesliga, now has four goals in as many league games, one behind Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski. Philipp then grabbed his second of the game with a deft chip to cap three Dortmund goals in 10 minutes. In the dying stages, Dortmund coach Peter Bosz gave a Bundesliga debut to Swedish wunderkind Alexander Isak, who turns 18 on Thursday. Cologne's strong protests over the second goal went down badly in the Dortmund camp. ""The only thing which is clear is that Cologne can't take losing,"" said Borussia's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. ""And if you can't take losing, then you turn to bad methods. ""If you do so after losing 5-0, then hats off,"" he added sarcastically. The win leaves Borussia top on goal difference from second-placed Hanover 96 with defending champions Bayern Munich third and just a point behind after Saturday's 4-0 win at home to Mainz when Lewandowski scored twice. Cologne are bottom with four straight defeats while Dortmund have yet to concede a league goal. Hanover were top of the table for 48 hours -- their first time in first place since 1969 -- after Friday's 2-0 win at Hamburg thanks to goals by Martin Harnik and Togo winger Ihlas Bebou. Earlier on Sunday, Hoffenheim missed the chance to go top when they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Hertha Berlin as Sandro Wagner's early goal was cancelled out by Alexander Esswein's second-half equaliser. The result leaves Hoffenheim fourth in the table with Hertha down to 11th and keeps Hanover, who won promotion back to the Bundesliga last season, as unlikely league leaders. Also on Sunday, Germany striker Kevin Volland netted twice as Bayer Leverkusen left the relegation places to go 12th with a 4-0 rout of Freiburg. After taking just a point from their first three league games, Leverkusen flew out of the traps at the BayArena as Volland netted either side of a stunning strike from Chile midfielder Charles Aranguiz. Volland opened the scoring with a superb strike from outside the area, but not to be outdone, Aranguiz showed superb technique by volleying home, then Volland tapped home Lars Bender's cross to make it 3-0 at the break. Freiburg coach Christian Streich reacted for the second-half by bringing on England Under-20 winger Ryan Kent, who went close with a late shot, but the result left the club in the bottom three.

But Cologne's bench were furious after Dortmund defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos scored just before the half-time break in controversial fashion to make it 2-0. In the build-up to the goal, Sokratis pushed Cologne defender Dominique Heintz, who knocked into goalkeeper Timo Horn, which caused him to fumble the ball from which Sokratis scored. The referee Patrick Ittrich allowed the goal to stand after consulting with the VAR. However, replays show the goal was scored after the ref had blown his whistle for the foul, which is against the rules. ""We want a clarification of the legal situation,"" said Cologne's director Joerg Schmadtke after an internal meeting on Monday. ""You can assume that we are protesting, because the rules were broken. ""We can not just pretend that nothing happened."" Despite the heavy scoreline, Cologne say the controversial goal was a key factor in their defeat, but Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke accused them of being 'bad losers'. ""If they want to protest, they should, but that is grotesque, almost ridiculous,"" added Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc."
330,13/09/2017,23:24,Kane downs Dortmund as Spurs end Wembley woe,Harry Kane banished Tottenham Hotspur's Wembley curse as the England striker's double sealed a 3-1 win over Borussia Dortmund in their Champions League opener on Wednesday.,"With White Hart Lane being redeveloped, Tottenham are playing their home matches at the English national stadium this season and that had been bad news for Mauricio Pochettino's side. Already scarred by damaging Wembley defeats in the Champions League and FA Cup semi-finals last term, Tottenham had lost to Chelsea and drawn with Burnley this season, sparking alarmist talk that they were jinxed at the hallowed north London venue. But, after losing eight of their previous 12 matches at Wembley, Kane's predatory finishing ensured Tottenham finally enjoyed a night to remember in their temporary lodgings. Son Heung-Min's first goal of the season put Tottenham ahead early on and, although Andriy Yarmolenko conjured a sublime equaliser, it was the hosts who possessed the killer instinct thanks to Kane's latest heroics. The on-form Kane, who scored twice in Saturday's win at Everton, restored Tottenham's advantage before the interval and wrapped up the victory with his second goal after half-time. Pitted in a tricky group that also includes holders Real Madrid, Tottenham's commanding display secured only their third win in 13 Wembley appearances and gave them an early boost in the battle for a place in the knockout stages. The only blemish for Tottenham was a late sending off for a second bookable offence for Jan Vertonghen, who swung his forearm into Mario Gotze's face. ""It was so important to win, we are so happy. We increased our level in the second half and were very clinical,"" Pochettino said. ""It is more than three points. The team is more mature now. We can learn a lot from this game. Harry Kane was fantastic."" Dortmund arrived in London unbeaten so far this season, but their squad had been ravaged by injuries, with Marco Reus, Raphael Guerreiro, Andre Schurrle and Marcel Schmelzer among the key players sidelined. It took Tottenham just four minutes to expose the fault lines in Dortmund's under-strength line-up as Son scored a fine individual goal. Set free down the left flank, Son drove into the penalty area unchecked by Dortmund's defence and, with goalkeeper Roman Burki failing to guard his near post, the South Korean smashed a powerful strike into the roof of the net. If that seemed like the perfect way for Tottenham to banish their Wembley angst, the positives vibes lasted just seven minutes. When Yarmolenko played a one-two with Shinji Kagawa out on the right wing, there appeared little danger, but the Ukrainian darted onto the return pass and hit a superb curling effort over Hugo Lloris and into the far corner. Yarmolenko's bolt from the blue could have been a hammer blow for Tottenham, but they recovered their composure impressively and regained the lead in the 15th minute. In a carbon copy of Tottenham's first goal, Kane sprinted onto a long ball down the left wing, muscled his way into the area and slammed a perfectly-placed shot past Burki, who once again left his near post fatally exposed. Dortmund hit back with a sustained period of pressure and ended the half frustrated after Christian Pulisic's strike was disallowed for offside. Pochettino's men should have wrapped up the points immediately after the break when Kane and then Son fired over with only Burki to beat from the edge of the area. Those glaring misses almost came back to haunt Spurs when Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang volleyed home at the far post, only to see his strike controversially erased by another offside flag. But Kane ensured Tottenham would finally taste the winning feeling at Wembley as the England forward struck again with a clinical finish in the 60th minute. Christian Eriksen's pass found Kane unmarked 18 yards from goal and he punished Dortmund's sloppy marking by drilling a low strike that deflected past Burki's despairing dive."
331,12/09/2017,15:15,'Heroes' Dortmund out to challenge Spurs,"Borussia Dortmund set out for Wednesday's Champions League tie against Tottenham Hotspur in London hoping their stars will become ""heroes"" in a group containing titleholders Real Madrid.","""This is the hardest group, but also challenging, and in such groups, heroes are made,"" said managing director Hans-Joachim Watzke on Tuesday. Dortmund, Spurs, and Real are joined by Cyprus side APOEL in Group H with Borussia hosting Spanish giants Madrid on September 26. The Germans have a proud Champions League history, reaching the quarter-finals twice in the last four seasons. However they were held to a goalless draw at 10-man Freiburg in the Bundesliga on Saturday when their attack, boasting Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and US wunderkind Christian Pulisic, failed to fire. The Bundesliga leaders have a score to settle at Wembley, Spurs' adopted home stadium, where the Germans lost the 2013 Champions League final to Bundesliga rivals Bayern Munich. ""It's a huge challenge, but I see us as being on the same level as Tottenham,"" said director of sport Michael Zorc. The Champions League still holds a few ghosts for the German club after the dark days of April 11 when a bomb attack on the team bus left defender Marc Bartra needing surgery after three blasts tore into the vehicle. Bartra will miss the match against Spurs with a groin injury while captain Marcel Schmelzer will miss the next seven weeks after tearing ankle ligaments in the draw at Freiburg. With Schmelzer out, Germany's Under-21 international Jeremy Toljan is set to take his place at left-back while new-signing Andriy Yarmolenko could make his first start after coming off the bench in Freiburg. The Germans beat Spurs 3-0 at home and 2-1 away when the teams met in the group stages of the Europa League in 2015/16 as Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino rested many of his first-choice players for the Premier League. ""The current match is not comparable to the games at that time,"" said Zorc, while Dortmund coach Peter Bosz expects ""a very strong opponent"" in London."
332,10/09/2017,17:36,Dortmund captain Schmelzer out of Spurs clash,"Borussia Dortmund captain Marcel Schmelzer will miss Wednesday's Champions League clash against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley with torn ankle ligaments, the German club confirmed.","A scan on Sunday on the left-back's right ankle revealed the injury after Schmelzer was stretchered off with half an hour gone of Saturday's goalless draw at Freiburg. The 29-year-old Germany international is expected to miss the next seven weeks having only returned on Saturday from tearing ligaments in the same ankle last July. Freiburg's Yoric Ravet, who had initially been booked for the tackle, was sent off for the foul on Schmelzer after the video assistant referee spotted the midfielder had gone in studs up. The VAR is being trialled in Germany this season and this was the first time an intervention led to a player being sent off. ""I knew straight away that I wouldn't be able to continue,"" said Schmelzer before the diagnosis. ""I don't blame him (Ravet), he wanted to play the ball, that is legitimate and he apologised in the dressing room."" Dortmund hope Spanish centre-back Marc Bartra, who went off against Freiburg with a groin injury, will be fit to face Spurs in their opening Champions League group match. His club has not ruled him out of the Wembley encounter."
333,17/08/2017,16:43,Goetze set to return after seven months out,Germany's World Cup-winner Mario Goetze is poised to play for the first time in seven months for Borussia Dortmund at Wolfsburg on Saturday to end his illness misery.,"""Mario has taken full part (in training) and it looks good,"" confirmed Dortmund's new coach Peter Bosz on Thursday. Goetze last played on January 29 before being sidelined by a metabolic disorder, which was discovered after a series of below-par performances. The 25-year-old, whose chest and volley sealed Germany's victory in the 2014 World Cup final, played in Dortmund's pre-season games, but missed the German Super Cup defeat to Bayern Munich a fortnight ago with a back injury. At Wolfsburg, Dortmund will be without Barcelona-target Ousmane Dembele, who is suspended after skipping training in a crude bid to force Borussia to sell him. Germany winger Andre Schuerrle is out for the next four weeks with a thigh tear, while Marco Reus (knee), Raphael Guerreiro (recovering from operation) and Julian Weigl (recovering from a broken ankle) are also sidelined. Bosz has replaced Thomas Tuchel as Dortmund's head coach after steering Ajax to the Europa League final in May. The Dutchman says Dortmund's goals are a top-four finish, to qualify directly for the Champions League, and to reach the knock-out stages of this year's competition."
334,17/08/2017,16:36,Dortmund deny Dembele's sale to Barca is 'close',Borussia Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke on Thursday rubbished claims by Barcelona's general manager Pep Segura that the Spanish giants were 'close' to signing the German club's want-away winger Ousmane Dembele.,"""Barcelona have not managed to fulfil their wish to complete Dembele's transfer -- until now, they aren't one millimetre closer,"" Watzke told German magazine Kicker. Watzke's comments referred to Segura's claim on Wednesday that Barcelona are ""close"" to completing a deal for Dembele as well as Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho. Dembele, 20, has a contract until 2021 and was suspended indefinitely by Dortmund last week for skipping training in a personal protest to pressure the German club to sell him to Barcelona. The Frenchman is suspended for Dortmund's opening Bundesliga match against Wolfsburg on Saturday, which is an unwelcome distraction for new Borussia coach Peter Bosz. ""It is not possible to completely blend it out, but I try to focus on the players who are here, which he isn't,"" said Bosz when asked about Dembele. ""I don't know what will happen, we have to be patient for a few more days."" Spanish giants Barcelona want to sign both Dembele and Coutinho as attacking reinforcements after losing Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain. According to Spanish media, Barcelona are offering 80 million euros ($93.5 million, £72.7 million), plus a bonus of 40 million euros, but Dortmund want 150 million euros for Dembele -- 10 times what they paid Rennes in 2016. Dembele's decision to strike has irked his team-mates. He missed Saturday's 4-0 win at minnows Rielasingen-Arlen in the first round of the German Cup when Gabon hot-shot Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick. Dortmund's tough-tackling defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos says Dembele should follow the example of Aubameyang, who has been linked to a big-money move to China but has been told that he is staying. ""Ousmane is a good lad, but he has to recognise that no player is bigger than the team,"" Sokratis told Thursday's edition of magazine Kicker. ""Everyone has to be clear that he must work for the team and fall in line. This also applies to Ousmane -- he can't just do whatever he wants."" ""Ousmane has done no good by going on strike. He should not forget that he still has a long-term contract at Dortmund,"" he added. Sokratis says he hopes Dembele will return to training soon. He remains suspended as Dortmund prepare for their opening game of the new Bundesliga season at Wolfsburg on Saturday. ""At first he has to get in touch with us again and come to training. Then we will see,"" said Sokratis. ""Ousmane has given a lot for us. He is a player who makes the difference and we need players like that. ""But we also need players who don't shut themselves out and who want to be part of our family. Apparently Ousmane doesn't want that."""

Now Dortmund's tough-tackling defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos says Dembele should follow the example of Aubameyang, who has been linked to a big-money move to China but has been told that he is staying. ""Ousmane is a good lad, but he has to recognise that no player is bigger than the team,"" Sokratis told Thursday's edition of magazine Kicker. ""Everyone has to be clear that he must work for the team and fall in line. This also applies to Ousmane -- he can't just do whatever he wants. ""He should take Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as an example. 'Auba' also could imagine leaving, but he behaves professionally in every training session and every game and gives his best.

""We have to help the team with reinforcements and they will be here in the coming days,"" Segura told Catalan TV station Esport3 after Barca lost the second leg of the Super Cup 2-0 at Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu. ""We are discussing the conditions of Coutinho and Dembele...they are close. ""We hope they will be Barca players next season."" Barca's season has been thrown into turmoil by Neymar's world record 222 million euro ($261 million) move to Paris Saint-Germain earlier this month. New Barca coach Ernesto Valverde admitted Neymar's absence has affected the balance of the side. Meanwhile, the Catalans have struggled to close deals for Coutinho and Dembele with Liverpool and Dortmund holding out for fees in excess of 100 million euros in the knowledge of Barca's desperation to land a replacement before the transfer window shuts on August 31. Barca defender Gerard Pique denied reports there is a growing feud between club's players and under-pressure board. However, Pique admitted Barca have plenty of work to do if they are to close they gap on Madrid, who have added to their crowns as European and Spanish champions by winning both the UEFA and Spanish Super Cups in style over the past week. ""We are not in the best moment. Not as a team or as a club,"" said Pique. ""We have to stick together and move forward. ""The season is long and it has just begun. Madrid were superior so we have to live with defeat, congratulate them and improve."" Despite missing the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo, whose five-game ban for pushing a referee after being sent off in the first leg was upheld on appeal before kick-off, Madrid were dominant in the first-half. Marco Asensio's brilliant strike after just four minutes built on Madrid's 3-1 first leg lead and Karim Benzema doubled the hosts' lead on the night just before half-time. Victory also sealed Madrid's seventh trophy of a spectacularly successful spell since Zinedine Zidane took charge just 20 months ago. ""We are delighted with how we played in both games, it is another trophy and you have to congratulate the players because they have been fantastic,"" said Zidane. On top of the absent Ronaldo, the Frenchman also had the luxury of leaving Gareth Bale and Isco on the bench as the gulf between Madrid and Barca's strength in depth was again laid bare. ""I have a spectacular squad,"" added Zidane. ""When you see how Isco played in Barcelona and then I take him out it is a bit harsh, but the players understand how long the season will be and we will need everyone."""

Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke told Funke Media Group on Saturday that nobody in the Dortmund squad had made it clear that they did not want to play. Asked if there was a clear difference in his and Tuchel's version of events, Watzke said: ""Yes, there is. It was too serious a matter for us to make a decision above the heads of everyone. ""It wasn't for nothing in the discussions on Wednesday morning (the day of the rescheduled game) that I made it clear that every player who didn't feel in a position to play had until the afternoon to say so.

Watzke said he was irritated when some players later complained that they had been made to play. Defender Sokratis said he had been made to feel ""like an animal, not a human being"". ""I would take with a pinch of salt the words of players who were in the middle of such a pressure situation and who were physically and mentally completely exhausted after the game,"" said Watzke. Asked about Watzke's latest comments Tuchel, who has one year left on his contract, declined to comment before Saturday's home match against Hoffenheim in a key battle for an automatic Champions League place.

""This is the biggest moment of my career with Dortmund. It's hard to come to Munich and get a win,"" beamed Dembele, 19, who only joined Borussia for the start of the season. The result is a dramatic turn-around for Thomas Tuchel's Dortmund who were hammered 4-1 by runaway leaders Bayern in Munich in the Bundesliga just three weeks ago. ""We came from 2-1 down and still won - that's crazy,"" beamed Tuchel. ""We had completely written off our 4-1 defeat in the league. We played well for 20 minutes and then we let it slip. ""After the break, we kept improving and improving, from the 60th minute we were very good. We certainly had a bit of luck too."" The loss is a disaster for Bayern's coach Carlo Ancelotti following the Bavarian giants' Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Real Madrid. The cup exit in Munich leaves Bayern winless in their last five games following back-to-back losses to Real, plus draws with Mainz and Leverkusen in the league. Ancelotti's Bayern are eight points clear in the Bundesliga with four games left. However, their dreams of repeating last season's league and cup double, under Ancelott's predecessor Pep Guardiola, are over. ""I think it's too early to talk about the season, we're still trying to win the Bundesliga,"" said Ancelotti when asked about the down-turn in fortunes this April. ""We're disappointed, we had our chances to go 3-1 up. ""This is not a good moment, but we have to focus on the Bundesliga."" In a repeat of last year's final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, which Bayern won in a penalty shoot-out, Marco Reus put Dortmund ahead after 19 minutes following a mistake by Munich's Javi Martinez. The Spanish international's lazy back pass was snapped up by Dortmund midfielder Raphael Guerreiro, whose snot hit the post and Reus drilled the rebound. Martinez made amends by equalising with a header nine minutes later before Mats Hummels put Bayern 2-1 ahead at half-time. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang made it 2-2 on 69 minutes when he headed home a superb Dembele cross. That paved the way for the French teenager to hit the winner with a curling left-foot shot to break Bayern's hearts. ""That is a huge disappointment,"" said Bayern's stunned captain Philipp Lahm. ""You could see when it was 2-2 that we really wanted to reach the final. We didn't play well in the first 15 minutes, but then we improved. First, we have to absorb this setback."" Dortmund will play in a fourth consecutive final on May 27, when they face Eintracht Frankfurt, who reached the final on Tuesday with a penalty shoot-out win over Borussia Moenchengladbach."

347,24/04/2017,01:45,Dortmund hope to shatter Bayern's double dream,Thomas Tuchel's Borussia Dortmund hope to add to Bayern Munich's recent woes in Wednesday's crunch German Cup semi-final to end Carlo Ancelotti's bid for the domestic double.,"Both Bayern and Dortmund had their Champions League campaigns ended last week by Real Madrid and Monaco respectively in the quarter-finals, but they meet at the Allianz Arena for a place in Berlin's cup final on May 27. Bayern are runway leaders in the German league and had been hoping for a place in the Champions League's semi-finals before a Cristiano Ronaldo-led Real thwarted their ambitions. As compensation, Ancelotti is hoping to finish his first season as Bayern coach with the league and cup double. However, first Dortmund must be overcome in a repeat of last year's final which Bayern won 4-3 on penalties after a goalless draw in Berlin. ""Now we want to spoil Bayern's season a little bit more,"" quipped Tuchel after Dortmund's 3-2 comeback win at Moechengladbach on Saturday to go third in Germany's top flight. The victory came the day after police arrested a suspect for the April 11 bomb attack on the Dortmund team bus which left defender Marc Bartra needing wrist surgery. ""The victory put the wind in our sails and gives confidence for Wednesday,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc after Raphael Guerreiro's late header sealed the win in Gladbach. ""I'm proud of the character of this team."" While Dortmund picked up a morale-boosting victory, Bayern had to twice come from behind as they laboured to a 2-2 draw at home to relegation-threatened Mainz. ""Of course, the game against Real is still bothering us, even if it shouldn't. We're professionals, but we're also human,"" said Bayern's stand-in captain Thomas Mueller. ""As well as the league title, reaching the Berlin final is our biggest goal, so that means, puff out your chest and show that we deserve to be there!"" However, Bayern are winless in their last four games and picked up their only victory in their last six games, when they romped to a 4-1 win over Dortmund in the league three weeks ago. Bayern's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski scored twice in the thumping home win, but Dortmund have Marco Reus back and the Germany winger has scored in each of his three games after six weeks sidelined by a hamstring injury. Reus is predicting a different type of game when the teams meet again at the Allianz Arena. ""It will be totally different, I see our chance as 50-50. We have a lot of self-confidence in the tank after our win in Gladbach,"" said Reus. Both teams have injury concerns. Bayern are already without Germany's goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who has a foot fracture, for the rest of the season and Sven Ulreich will again deputise. Austria defender David Alaba is doubtful with a knee injury having limped off early in Saturday's draw against Mainz, but Ancelotti hopes to have centre-backs Jerome Boateng (groin) and Mats Hummels (ankle) fit again. Tuchel is hoping defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos overcomes a leg knock, while Turkey midfielder Nuri Sahin is out with suspected torn ankle ligaments. On Tuesday, Borussia Moenchengladbach host Eintracht Frankfurt in the other semi with both teams chasing their first final appearance in more than a decade. German Cup semi-finals (1845 GMT)"
348,22/04/2017,19:34,Bayern sweat on Alaba for Dortmund cup semi,Carlo Ancelotti says Bayern Munich are holding their breath over David Alaba for Wednesday's German Cup semi-final against Borussia Dortmund after the Austria international injured his knee.,"Alaba switched from left-back to central defence, but limped off after just 16 minutes of Bayern's 2-2 draw at home to Mainz on Saturday and Ancelotti is waiting to see the extent of the injury. ""He couldn't continue. He had a small problem in the knee, which we are now checking, but it's not a big problem,"" said Bayern's Italian coach Ancelotti. ""We'll see if he can play on Wednesday."" Bayern are already struggling in defence with Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer sidelined for the rest of the season with a foot fracture. Ancelotti was without injured centre backs Javi Martinez and Jerome Boateng against Mainz, but the pair should be fit to face Dortmund in a repeat of last year's cup final which Bayern won on penalties. Bayern needed a Thiago Alcantara equaliser to seal Saturday's 2-2 draw as they twice came from behind against relegation-threatened Mainz to maintain their 20-match unbeaten record at home in the Bundesliga. Second-placed RB Leipzig can trim Bayern's lead in Germany's top flight to six points if they win at Schalke on Sunday with the Bavarian giants chasing a fifth straight German League title this season. The draw with Mainz capped a week to forget for the Bundesliga league leaders following Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Real Madrid. Dortmund, who also bowed out of the Champions League in midweek after losing their last eight tie at Monaco, also have defensive woes as they look to reach the German Cup final on May 27 at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Their centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos is carrying a leg knock. The Greece international sat out Saturday's Bundesliga match at Borussia Moenchengladbach, but Dortmund has ""ruled out"" him facing Bayern, according to their website."
349,20/04/2017,15:18,Relentless Monaco dream on after reaching semis,"A brilliant Monaco side that has taken Europe by storm will not relent in their bid for glory after beating Borussia Dortmund to reach the Champions League semi-finals, promised coach Leonardo Jardim.","The team from the Mediterranean principality were too good for their German opponents in Wednesday's quarter-final second leg, winning 3-1 at the Stade Louis II to advance 6-3 on aggregate. ""We have won nothing, but we have made history,"" declared Portuguese coach Jardim after the game, as his side extended a run that began in the third qualifying round against Fenerbahce last July, nine months ago. Teenage sensation Kylian Mbappe, skipper Radamel Falcao and substitute Valere Germain got their goals with Marco Reus netting for Dortmund on a memorable night for the hosts. The last team to come through two qualifying rounds to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League was Dynamo Kiev in 1999, although the format was different in those days. Nobody expected Monaco -- conquerors of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in the last round -- to get this far but they have done it playing a superb brand of football that has yielded 141 goals so far this season. Now they are preparing for their first semi-final appearance since 2004 as they join Juventus, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the draw. None of those teams will fancy playing Monaco, who for all Paris Saint-Germain's efforts in recent years will be the first French representative in the last four since Lyon in 2010. ""We have taken France into the semi-finals. We want to go out and enjoy it but all four sides are capable of winning the competition,"" warned Jardim, whose team were visited by Prince Albert in the dressing room afterwards. Monaco are not just fighting for glory in Europe -- they are also top of the French league and in the French Cup semi-finals, but fatigue is their biggest foe now. ""It's not easy to play in Europe and try to win the league. We are the team that has played the most games in Europe, so it's tough,"" added a coach who has been linked to Arsenal in the British media. ""Maybe if we had lost in the last 16 we would be fresher now, but we won't ask our players to change their mentality. We just need to recover well."" A crunch game at Lyon awaits in the league at the weekend as they look to keep going on all fronts. ""If I have to choose, it's normal to prefer to win the Champions League, but maybe our chances of winning it are slimmer than winning the league. We will give everything in both,"" added the coach. For Dortmund, elimination was hard to take but the tie was overshadowed by the bomb attack on their team bus en route to last week's first leg which left Marc Bartra with a broken wrist. Bartra was there to support his teammates in Monaco but it was another difficult night as their bus was delayed in leaving for the ground, held up by police for security reasons. ""It was the worst thing that could happen a week after the attack -- everyone was on the bus ready to go but we were not allowed to,"" said coach Thomas Tuchel. The kick-off was delayed by five minutes but Dortmund's concentration was again affected. ""It's only eight days after the terrible attack so we shouldn't lend too much significance to the team's performance,"" added Tuchel, who was taking charge of Dortmund for the 100th time. ""It was very difficult for the players so I can't be too critical. We felt ready to push for a semi-final place before the tie but things changed dramatically."" Dortmund are fourth in the Bundesliga and Tuchel added: ""Our path does not end here. We will not be favourites next year but we need to qualify first and then be as unpleasant to play against as possible."""
350,20/04/2017,13:28,Dazed Dortmund lacked focus in Monaco - Burki,Roman Burki says Borussia Dortmund lacked focus early in their 3-1 Champions League defeat at Monaco amidst the fall-out from last week's bomb attack on their team bus.,"""We weren't 100 percent ready from the first second, perhaps we were too intent on scoring,"" said Dortmund goalkeeper Burki after Wednesday's defeat with the Germans failing to overturn their 3-2 first-leg defeat. The Germans bowed out leaving Monaco to join Real Madrid, Juventus and Atletico Madrid in Friday's draw for the Champions League's semi-finals after winning their quarter-final 6-3 on aggregate against Dortmund. The Germans were rocked by last week's attack when three explosive blasts hit the team coach on the way to the first-leg match leaving defender Marc Bartra needing surgery for a broken wrist. Police are still hunting the culprits. The home leg was eventually played last Wednesday, but the shell-shocked Borussia players later complained they were traumatised by the events of the previous 24 hours. In Monaco, French police held the Dortmund team bus up by around 15 minutes for security reasons, which German coach Thomas Tuchel said unsettled his players. ""After what happened to us, there is hardly a worse feeling than sitting together again on a bus which isn't moving. It was an oppressive feeling,"" he added. Former Germany international Marcell Jansen said the trauma of last week was plain to see and had hamstrung Dortmund's performance in Monaco. ""The players are still feeling the effects, one can see that clearly,"" said Sky pundit Jansen. ""That wasn't the Dortmund we know. That was a team who wanted to do everything, but just couldn't do it."" Dortmund's plight in Monaco was not helped by Tuchel's decision to play Erik Durm, who has just returned from injury, on the right wing, which proved to be a disaster. The Germany international was dragged off after only 26 minutes as Monaco had attacked freely down his channel and raced into a 2-0 lead through goals by Kylian Mbappe and Radamel Falcao. Germany winger Marco Reus pulled a goal back for Dortmund after the break, but Valere Germain came off the bench to score Monaco's late third to seal the win. ""The early goals unsettled us,"" admitted midfielder Julian Weigl. ""We said at the half-time break that we could still score three in the second-half, but their third goal was a knock-out (punch)."" Tuchel later took responsibility for starting Durm, but the damage was already done. Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc said it will take time for the team to get over the bomb blasts with a German Cup semi-final still to play next week against Bayern Munich. ""The explosion before the first leg won't be processed in just a week or two,"" he said. ""But that doesn't help us, we're still in a three-day rhythm and have to face the challenges."""
351,19/04/2017,22:50,Mbappe helps fire Monaco to Champions League semis,Teenage sensation Kylian Mbappe scored again to set Monaco on their way to a 3-1 second-leg victory over Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday that allowed them to win their Champions League quarter-final 6-3 on aggregate.,"Radamel Falcao also netted for the home side in a whirlwind start at the Stade Louis II, and Dortmund were left with too much to do to save the tie. Their skipper Marco Reus pulled a goal back early in the second half but Valere Germain came off the bench to put the seal on a famous win for a brilliant young Monaco side, who go through to the last four for the first time since 2004. Meanwhile, Dortmund bow out after a tie overshadowed by the bomb attack on the team's bus last week that forced the first leg to be postponed by a day. The Germans lost that match 3-2, their minds elsewhere, but their hopes of turning the tie around in the second leg were not helped when their bus was held up on the way to the Stade Louis II, leading to a five-minute delay to the kick-off. UEFA blamed ""heavy traffic"" for the hold-up but, on their official Twitter account, Dortmund said they had been delayed in leaving their hotel by police for around 20 minutes ""without justification"". While the appearance of Spanish defender Marc Bartra -- who needed surgery for a broken wrist suffered in last week's attack -- at the stadium was a boost to Dortmund, the delay unsettled Thomas Tuchel's side and their hopes of turning the tie around were effectively ended in a terrible opening 20 minutes. The away defence backed off as Benjamin Mendy advanced and when the full-back's powerful left-foot strike stung the palms of goalkeeper Roman Burki, the 18-year-old Mbappe was on hand to convert the rebound. That strike meant Mbappe, who netted twice in the first leg, became the youngest player ever to reach five goals in the Champions League, beating Real Madrid great Raul by 41 days. Nuri Sahin cracked a free-kick off a post at the other end and Monaco survived that scare to increase their lead on 17 minutes at the end of a counter-attack. The rampaging Mendy's initial cross came back to Thomas Lemar and he held up a ball that was headed home by captain Falcao, the prolific Colombian marking his 50th appearance in European competition with his 45th goal. Like in the first leg, Tuchel's decision to start with three at the back had backfired and he changed things up before the half-hour mark, bringing on Ousmane Dembele for Erik Durm and revertng to a four-man defence. Dortmund now needed to score three times without reply just to force extra time but they did not manage to get one back until three minutes after the restart, Dembele tormenting Mendy on the right before his cutback was lashed home first-time by Reus. But it was Monaco who had the best chances to score again after that, with Burki tipping over Almamy Toure's looping header and Falcao squandering a fine chance before substitute Germain made sure of their place in the last four. He had only just come on for Mbappe when he applied a first-time finish to Lemar's square ball with nine minutes to go, allowing Monaco to join Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Juventus in the semi-final draw."
352,19/04/2017,21:12,Tuchel stunned as Dortmund bus delayed in Monaco,"Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel said it ""was very unfortunate"" that his team's bus was delayed on its way to their Champions League quarter-final second leg tie against Monaco on Wednesday.","Just a week after the German team's bus was attacked by explosives en route to the first leg in Dortmund, the kick-off for the return match was delayed by five minutes. ""Let's say that the incident is very unfortunate,"" Tuchel told Sky Germany. ""We didn't know what was going on. This quarter of an hour prevented us from thinking about football when we were well prepared for the match."" Dortmund's ""You'll never walk alone"" anthem, a song notably shared with English club Liverpool, was played at the ground to mark the solidarity between the two clubs in the wake of last week's bus attack. The Dortmund travelling fans situated in a corner of the stadium responded with chants of ""Monaco! Monaco!"" while a section of home supporters held aloft a huge red and white banner emblazoned with the words ""BVB you'll never walk alone"". For the game itself, both Marcel Schmelzer and Ousmane Dembele were left out of the team. Schmelzer and Dembele start on the bench along with Sven Bender as Erik Durm, Raphael Guerreiro and Matthias Ginter all start for the German club, who are looking to overturn a 3-2 first-leg deficit at the Stade Louis II. The changes mean Tuchel could send his side out in a 3-5-2 formation, with Marco Reus -- who missed the first leg -- supporting one-time Monaco player Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in attack. There is no Marc Bartra, the Spanish defender who needed surgery on a broken wrist suffered in the attack on the Dortmund team bus that forced the first leg to be postponed by 24 hours. Monaco are without influential Brazilian midfielder Fabinho, who missed a penalty in the first leg, due to suspension, so Tiemoue Bakayoko and Joao Moutinho partner one another in midfield. Almamy Toure starts at right-back with Djibril Sidibe still recovering from appendicitis, while teenage prodigy Kylian Mbappe plays alongside Radamel Falcao up front. Mbappe scored twice in the first leg, either side of a Bender own goal, to leave Monaco in pole position to reach the semi-finals for the first time in 13 years. Starting line-ups: Monaco (4-4-2): Danijel Subasic; Almamy Toure, Kamil Glik, Jemerson, Benjamin Mendy; Bernardo Silva, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Joao Moutinho, Thomas Lemar; Kylian Mbappe, Radamel Falcao (capt) Coach: Leonardo Jardim (POR) Borussia Dortmund (3-5-2): Roman Burki; Lukasz Piszczek, Sokratis Papastathopoulos, Matthias Ginter; Erik Durm, Julian Weigl, Nuri Sahin, Shinji Kagawa, Raphael Guerreiro; Marco Reus (capt), Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Coach: Thomas Tuchel (GER) Referee: Damir Skomina (SLO)"
353,18/04/2017,14:06,Five reasons why Dortmund can win in Monaco,Borussia Dortmund look to overturn their 3-2 home defeat against Monaco in Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final return leg away to the French League leaders.,"Here are five reasons to believe embattled Dortmund can turn things around at Monaco's Stade Louis II stadium: Marco Reus is back from injury and the Germany winger will give Dortmund a substantial boost. Reus is mentally fresh, having not been on the team bus hit by three explosions last Tuesday, en route to the first-leg, which left Marc Bartra needing wrist surgery and his Dortmund team-mates shell-shocked. The match was eventually replayed on Wednesday, 24 hours after the blast, with Reus left out as he finished recovering from a hamstring injury. Last Saturday, Reus marked his return after six weeks on the sidelines with an audacious backheel after 122 seconds in their 3-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt. Borussia coach Thomas Tuchel played Reus for 45 minutes to build his fitness with one eye on Monaco. ""With Marco on the pitch, all other players have a different attitude and more self-confidence,"" said Tuchel. Reus will be looking to resume his partnership with Dortmund's top-scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang which has yielded 10 Champions League goals this season. Aubameyang, who has score 33 goals this season, will have a point to prove at Monaco, where he spent an unsuccessful loan spell in 2010/11. The Dortmund squad received a timely boost when Bartra left hospital on Saturday. The Spanish defender posted ""proud to be part of this family! #NoWords"" on Instagram alongside a picture of the squad holding aloft his number five shirt when they celebrated after Saturday's win. Dortmund will be playing for their injured team-mate in Monaco. While recovering at home, Bartra received a visit from his ex-Barcelona team-mates Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba on Monday. Busquets knows all about second-leg shock comebacks having played in Barcelona's astonishing 6-1 win over Paris Saint-Germain to win their Last 16 clash 6-5 on aggregate. Dortmund's single goal deficit is dwarfed by the 4-0 first-leg defeat in Paris which Barca managed to overcome. Dortmund defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos was a pillar of strength at the back against Frankfurt, blasting home their second goal from 25 metres out, which he dedicated to 'Bartra and his family'. The burly Greece centre-back made 17 tackles, launched a string of counter-attacks and won 76 percent of his challenges on Saturday. He needs to again be on his game to contain Monaco's attack spear-headed by strikers Kylian Mbappe and captain Radamel Falcao, but said Saturday's win was a morale booster for Wednesday. Monaco's Stade Louis II has a 18,523 capacity, but 3,000 noisy Dortmund supporters are expected to make their presence felt to try and create a home-ground atmosphere for the visiting team. A cordial atmosphere is expected between the supporters after Borussia fans offered beds to stranded Monaco supporters in Dortmund last week under the Twitter hashtag #Bedforawayfans. Dortmund have only lost three of their 12 European away fixtures since the start of the season, but Monaco have won five of their six home Champions League games this season. Dortmund are attempting to become only the third club to have lost the first-leg at home in the Champions League's knock-out phase and still progressed. Ajax managed it in 1995/96 when they came back from a 1-0 defeat in Amsterdam to win 3-0 at Panathinaikos in Athens in the semi-finals. And Inter Milan also did it at Bayern Munich, who won the last 16 first-leg 1-0 in Italy, but lost the return 3-2 in Bavaria. Monaco have won all 12 of their European matches when they were victorious in the first-leg -- and Dortmund want to make it unlucky 13. In Monaco, Slovenia's Damir Skomina will referee and Dortmund have won all three Champions League games when he has been in charge, including their 2-1 group stage win at Sporting Lisbon in October."
354,18/04/2017,03:15,"Bus attack leaves Dortmund fighting blood, sweat and tears battle","Marc Bartra gave blood, other Borussia Dortmund players have nightmares about the bomb attack on their bus and now the German team may need the sweat of Marco Reus to pull off a fairy tale place in the Champions League last four.","The scars left by three bombs that scorched the side of the bus and fired metal shards inside before the quarter-final against Monaco have gone much further than Bartra's fractured wrist. The game was postponed but Dortmund were forced to play 24 hours later. The shock was apparent in the 3-2 defeat that has left the German side facing a stiff challenge in Wednesday's return leg. So far nobody has been caught -- one Islamist suspect was discounted -- and no claim of responsibility has proved convincing. ""I wake up every night,"" Dortmund's Swiss goalkeeper Roman Burki said. ""Without any reason, I am jolted awake in terror. Then I can't get back to sleep and I am just relieved I am at home in my own bed."" Burki recalled the horror of the ""huge bang"" in an interview with Swiss newspaper Der Bund. ""The pressure made all our heads turn to one side. Then there was a long silence and then a cry -- it was Bartra."" Burki says he cannot understand why a football team would be the target of ""a terror attack."" Dortmund are getting help from psychologists. ""We have very good counsellors we can ask for help,"" said the goalkeeper. And the team bounced back with a 3-1 Bundesliga win over Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. But getting over the attack will be a slow process. For Bürki, football is a key part of the therapy. ""I'm happy to have something I can focus on. It is very important to be able to take your mind off things, think less about what has happened."" The team gathered to hold up a Bartra jersey after Saturday's win. Many of them were in tears. ""During the 90 minutes of the game it was easier. But at the end, everything you have kept inside under pressure comes out,"" said captain Marcel Schmelzer. ""Against Frankfurt we showed a lot of joy playing because we are happy to be here. We talk a lot about it to each other. I think it will weld us together as a team,"" the skipper added. German international Sven Bender said the whole team deserved praise for playing against Frankfurt so soon after the near miss that experts said could have been deadly. ""For me, it was even harder than Wednesday, because we had more time to think about the terrible things which have happened,"" he said. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel believes the first game against Monaco should not have gone ahead so soon. But he has had to concentrate on Wednesday's return. Some specialists say the players' shock should start to ""stablise"" after two or three days, according to Tuchel. ""For the players, its easier when they play, than after the whistle when they feel they have to talk"" about their ordeal. The problem is ""how to focus"" on the Monaco game, said the German coach. But Saturday's display indicated Frankfurt could be in the mood for an upset in Monaco. Defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos scored from a screaming 23 metre shot that he labelled ""the most beautiful goal of my career"" and dedicated it to Bartra. And then there was Reus, who scored just 122 seconds into his comeback from six weeks on the sidelines with a hamstring injury. Reus at his best can be a match-winner. The 27-year-old forward has the experience, the playmaking skills and above all, he was not on the ill-fated team bus last Tuesday -- and that could make all the difference."
355,18/04/2017,02:02,"Jardim, Tuchel clash with reputations burgeoning","There is just a year in age between them, neither had a distinguished playing career and both have been linked with moves to the Premier League, so Leonardo Jardim and Thomas Tuchel have plenty in common.","They are two of Europe's most exciting younger coaches, but only one will take his team into the last four of the Champions League as Monaco and Borussia Dortmund meet in their quarter-final second leg on Wednesday. Regardless of what happens at the Stade Louis II -- where Monaco will kick off with a 3-2 lead from the first leg -- Jardim and Tuchel will continue to be linked to jobs at supposedly bigger European clubs in the coming months. English media reports have stated that both are on a potential shortlist of successors to Arsene Wenger, should the Frenchman's long reign at Arsenal finally come to an end. Jardim has also been talked about in Italy in relation to the Juventus job amid suggestions that Massimiliano Allegri could move on. Tuchel's name has come up in speculation about who will replace Luis Enrique at Barcelona. ""I don't know. I am so focused on Monaco that I'm not thinking about my future. I have two more years on my contract and I feel good,"" Jardim, 42, told Portuguese sports daily O Jogo in an interview last month when asked if he was considering moving on. Tuchel, 43, was less expansive when pressed on his own future a couple of months ago, replying: ""I'm on a contract with Dortmund and I'm happy here."" Both are still fighting for a major honour as a coach, but they have each had to prove themselves in their profession without having been players of any note. Born in Venezuela, Jardim grew up on the island of Madeira -- better known as the birthplace of Cristiano Ronaldo -- and he started coaching there with lower-league Camacha in his late 20s. Jardim studied physical education at university in Madeira but he left that career behind to coach on the mainland when the chance arose and he has never looked back. His impressive showing in charge of Sporting Lisbon paved the way for him to succeed Claudio Ranieri at Monaco in 2014 and, after some initial difficulties, he has made them the most spectacular side in Europe this season. Monaco are top of Ligue 1 and in the French Cup semi-finals while still pursuing their European dream, despite selling the likes of James Rodriguez, Anthony Martial, Geoffrey Kondogbia, Yannick Carrasco and Layvin Kurzawa since his appointment. ""I recognise the skill of those who do most with less. I see this change in perception, the tendency to want to see if the coach is able to add value to what is there and not just buy, buy, buy,"" he told O Jogo. A former sports science student with a degree in English, Tuchel's modest playing career was cut short by injury but he soon emerged as a promising coach at Mainz, taking over their first team in 2009. His work there allowed him to succeed Jurgen Klopp at Dortmund in 2015 and the work he has done with a young side, as well as the way in which he dealt with the traumatic events of the past week, mean his reputation keeps growing. ""Though Dortmund have slipped behind Bayern domestically this season, there is patience with Tuchel as he is clearly rejuvenating the team in the very literal sense of the word,"" says German football journalist and commentator Ian Holyman. ""Teenagers Christian Pulisic and Ousmane Dembele, in particular, have been given free rein this season and flourished. ""The incidents that marred the first leg with Monaco mean he is unlikely to be blamed for a quarter-final exit should Dortmund go out, and the fact they put up such valiant resistance in the first leg has only enamoured him further to the Dortmund faithful and football fans Europe-wide."""
356,15/04/2017,18:47,Bartra tributes as rattled Dortmund bounce back,Borussia Dortmund players paid tribute to injured defender Marc Bartra as they beat Eintracht Frankfurt 3-1 on Saturday in their first Bundesliga match since the bomb attack on their team bus.,"Germany winger Marco Reus scored on his return after six weeks out on an emotional afternoon for the club. Sokratis Papastathopoulos and leading scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang were also on target in a home victory which let Thomas Tuchel's side to all but wrap up a top-four finish and boost morale at the end of a traumatic week. ""The players showed incredible character and deserve the best possible compliment,"" said Tuchel. Three bombs containing pieces of metal rocked the Dortmund bus on the way to Tuesday's Champions League home quarter-final match against Monaco and left Spanish international Bartra hospitalised. The first leg was eventually played on Wednesday but Dortmund lost 3-2, their players later admitting they were still shell-shocked by the attack. The team was buoyed before kick-off on Saturday as Bartra was released from hospital following surgery on a broken wrist. The Dortmund squad held his number five shirt aloft as they celebrated in front of their home fans after the final whistle. ""During the 90 minutes it was easier than on Wednesday,"" said captain Marcel Schmelzer. ""We had a goosebump moment in front of our South Stand. We're trying to talk a lot about it (the attack) in order to process it and I hope it will get better quickly."" Reus, back from a hamstring injury, needed just three minutes to open the scoring in front of a sell-out crowd of 81,360 and a heavy police presence at Signal Iduna Park. Frankfurt drew level on 29 minutes when Marco Fabian's speculative shot hit the top-right corner, but Sokratis restored the hosts' advantage before the break with a thunderous effort that barely deviated as it flew past Frankfurt goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky. Aubameyang netted his 26th league goal this season late on to secure the points and make him the division's joint top scorer alongside Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski. Runaway league leaders Bayern later endured a frustrating goalless draw at ten-man Bayer Leverkusen as they desperately missed top-scorer Robert Lewandowski, who was suspended. Leverkusen had Tin Jedvaj sent off for the last 30 minutes, but Bayern could not break down the hosts' defence despite 19 shots on goal -- including having double saves off the line on two separate occasions. Defenders Jedvaj and Omer Toprak cleared shots by David Alaba and Javi Martinez in rapid succession on 32 minutes. Then Thomas Mueller and Arturo Vidal both had shots cleared on 52 minutes just before Jedjav's dismissal for a second yellow. With five minutes to go, Philipp Lahm rolled the ball just wide of the post to sum up Bayern's fortunes. Lewandowski will hopefully recover from a bruised shoulder for Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final return at Real Madrid. The Poland hot-shot missed last Wednesday's 2-1 first-leg defeat with injury. Second-placed RB Leipzig are now eight points behind Bayern after their 4-0 home thrashing of Freiburg. Yussuf Poulsen gave RB an early lead before putting Timo Werner in behind the Freiburg defence to net his 16th league goal this season just before the break. Guinea midfielder Naby Keita scored with a superb shot on 51 minutes before Diego Demme hit their fourth. Leipzig, in their first top-flight campaign, are now guaranteed a top-four finish and a crack at the Champions League next season. Third-placed Hoffenheim also moved a step closer to Champions League qualification after their thrilling 5-3 win at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach. Hungary striker Adam Szalai and midfielder Kerem Demirbay both scored twice in the eight-goal thriller. Relegation-threatened Mainz broke their five-match losing streak with a 1-0 win over Hertha Berlin thanks to Danny Latza's winner to leave them 15th. Augsburg are one place below them, but level on points, after they beat Cologne 2-1 despite finishing with nine men as Koo Ja-Cheol and Alfred Finnbogason were sent off as Paul Verhaegh sealed the hosts' win.

The bombs containing metal pieces detonated minutes after the team bus set off to a Champions League game against Monaco on Tuesday night. Bartra was hurt by flying glass and had to undergo a wrist operation, taking him out of action for four weeks. The 26-year-old said ""the shock of the past few days is diminishing all the time"" and that when he looks at his swollen wrist, what he feels is ""pride"". ""I look at it proud thinking of all the damage they wanted to do to us on Tuesday and it resulted in just that,"" he said, thanking those who are treating him as well as fans, his team-mates and others who have showered him with support. ""I needed to write and get this off my chest and settle it so I can just think about getting back to 100 percent as soon as possible,"" he added. Three days after the attack that injured Bartra and a policeman who suffered trauma from the noise of the blasts, investigators are still scrambling to find possible culprits. The probe suffered a setback on Thursday when the sole suspect in custody was cleared of involvement in the crime. Investigators had zeroed in on two suspects believed to belong to a large jihadist scene in western Germany's Ruhr region, after three identical letters were found at the site of the attack. The letter demanded that Berlin stop its Tornado reconnaissance missions in the international anti-IS coalition and close the US air base at Ramstein, western Germany. But the head of domestic intelligence for the region, Burkhard Freyer, said investigators had not ruled out the extreme-right, the far-left or hooligans of being behind the attack. Germany has been on high alert since a series of jihadist attacks last year, including a deadly Christmas market truck rampage in Berlin. Despite the attack, most Germans still feel safe, according to a poll of 1,000 people a day after the blasts by public broadcaster ARD. Some 82 percent polled said they ""feel rather safe"", said ARD. Likewise, a majority -- 56 percent -- of those surveyed said they felt well protected against terror attacks. Dortmund, who eventually played the delayed match against Monaco a day after the attack, are preparing to host Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on Saturday. The club's manager Thomas Tuchel had hit out at the decision to play the Monaco Champions League game so soon after the assault, saying they were treated as if only a ""beer can"" had been thrown at their bus. bur-hmn/mw BORUSSIA DORTMUND"
358,13/04/2017,18:17,"We must overcome bus attack, says Tuchel","Thomas Tuchel stressed Borussia Dortmund must try to overcome Tuesday's bomb attack on the German team's bus, but admitted it was still ""incredibly difficult"" to speak about the ordeal.","""We must find a way of overcoming that. But we still don't know how that's going to happen,"" the Dortmund coach said Thursday, a day after Tuchel's side lost 3-2 to Monaco in the rescheduled first leg of their Champions League quarter-final. Three explosions rocked the Dortmund team coach as it made its way to Signal Iduna Park ahead of Tuesday's planned kick-off, forcing the match to be postponed until Wednesday. Spanish international defender Marc Bartra underwent emergency surgery for a broken wrist and to remove glass that became planted in his arm after the blasts shattered windows on the team bus. ""Everyone must face up to it in their own may. No one felt it in exactly the same way,"" said Tuchel, with Dortmund offering to provide counselling for the players. ""Some players saw the explosion... there were lots of different feelings and therefore many different ways of handling the trauma."" Tuchel slammed UEFA on Wednesday over the decision to go ahead with the fixture less than 24 hours after the harrowing events. ""I complimented the team, they showed character and lots of courage. Now we need, with time, to find a way to enjoy being on the pitch again... but the best athlete is the one without any worries."" Dortmund's next game is at home to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on Saturday."
359,13/04/2017,17:38,Detained 'Islamist' cleared over Dortmund blasts,German federal prosecutors said Thursday they had cleared the sole suspect in custody for a bomb attack against the Borussia Dortmund football team bus of involvement.,"The announcement marked a setback for investigators, who described the three blasts late Tuesday as a ""terrorist"" act and said they are focusing on suspects in the ""Islamist spectrum"". ""The investigation has not found evidence that the suspect took part,"" the prosecutors office said in a brief statement. It said it was nevertheless seeking an arrest warrant for a 26-year-old Iraqi national, identified only as Abdul Beset A., for alleged ties to the Islamic State group. Investigators had zeroed in on two suspects believed to belong to a large jihadist scene in the Ruhr region, after three identical letters were found at the scene. Only Abdul Beset A. was detained. The letter demanded that Germany stop its Tornado reconnaissance missions in the international anti-IS coalition and close the US air base at Ramstein in western Germany. The daily Bild newspaper said police had placed Abdul Beset A. under surveillance for several months and believed, based on tapped telephone conversations, that he might be hiding explosives in his flat. However a raid on his home Wednesday drew a blank, the report said. Even as the probe appeared to be in its preliminary stages, Dortmund officials criticised the decision to play its postponed Champions League match just 24 hours after the attack, with the perpetrator or perpetrators still at large. State police chief Dieter Schuermann admitted there were no strong leads. ""We are looking for people who are prepared to kill,"" he said, quoted by DPA news agency. The head of domestic intelligence for the region, Burkhard Freyer, said investigators had not ruled out the extreme-right, the far-left or hooligans of being behind the attack. Bild also quoted a security expert, Peter Neumann, raising doubts about an IS link to the letter found at the scene because some of its formulations were atypical for the group. The roadside blasts left Dortmund's Spanish international Marc Bartra and a policeman injured, with the bombs ""containing metal pieces"" detonating minutes after the team bus set off to a planned Champions League game against Monaco. The quarter-final, first leg match was held in Dortmund just a day later in a packed stadium with tight security, with Monaco winning 3-2. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel angrily accused European football federation UEFA of treating the bomb attack as if a ""beer can"" had been thrown and claimed they were informed by text message that they would have to play the game a day later. Germany has been on high alert since a series of jihadist attacks last year, including a deadly Christmas market truck rampage in Berlin. Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday that ""highly varying"" laws for each region under Germany's federalist system were undermining the country's fight against terrorism. She cited differing policies on surveillance as one weakness and called for their harmonisation, in an interview with the Funke media group. ""We know that we are threatened like many other countries and will do everything in our power to ensure security in freedom for our citizens, in close consultation between the federal government and the states,"" she said. Before the match began Wednesday, fans chanted ""Bartra! Bartra!"", in support of the injured defender. Dortmund's chief executive Hans-Joachim Watze vowed that his side would ""play not only for ourselves today. We will play for everyone... we want to show that terror and hate can never determine our actions"". Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, who attended the match, said the ""fascination"" surrounding football drove terrorists to try to disrupt it. ""That's why it's right that we do as much as we can to protect it, and not allow criminals to take the fascination away from us."""

Bartra, 26, underwent emergency surgery for a broken radius bone and to remove glass that became planted in his arm after the blasts shattered windows on the team's bus. On Wednesday he said on Twitter that he was ""doing much better"" but he played no part in Dortmund's 3-2 defeat at home to Monaco in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final."

Guardiola was shocked by the incident in Germany which caused the tie to be postponed for 24 hours and left Dortmund defender Marc Bartra needing surgery to a broken wrist. The German Federal Prosecutor's Office said three letters claiming responsibility found near the site of the attack made Islamic extremists the possible perpetrators. ""It's a bit scary how the world is. It's going a bit crazy,"" Guardiola told reporters on Thursday. ""What's happening in Syria... hopefully the president of the United States, the presidents of Russia and China, can intervene and find a solution, because if not we don't know where we'll end up. ""We have to keep living without fear, but these things can happen. ""I hope Marc has a fantastic recovery. In terms of what happened, it was scary and it was serious, but he lived to tell the tale. ""But we're in a world where we don't know where we'll end up, that's the truth. I don't know where we're heading."" Meanwhile, on footballing matters, Guardiola has confirmed that he currently does not have a first choice goalkeeper and will platoon Claudio Bravo, who turned 34 on Thursday, and Willy Caballero on a game-by-game basis. Bravo has struggled through a disappointing debut season with City having arrived at the club as apparent successor to England international Joe Hart, who was sent on loan to Torino. Back-up Caballero appeared to have displaced Bravo as City's first choice but Guardiola insisted that is not the case. ""Last week I decided for Claudio. Saturday I am going to decide,"" Guardiola said. ""It depends on if the opponent makes a lot of high pressing or not. The way the opponent plays as well. ""What I see in the training session. I have confidence with both. We will see. ""It's my decision. I like both to be involved."" Guardiola also insists that injury-plagued defender Vincent Kompany has a future to play with his club, not least because City's club captain is still under contract next season. The Belgian came through 90 minutes in last week's 2-1 defeat at leaders Chelsea, his first complete game in the league this season, only to miss out on the weekend win over Hull through a minor injury. ""Yes, he has a contract,"" said Guardiola when asked if Kompany figures in his plans for next season. ""He can hopefully play two games a week in the next period, in the future. He can do that. ""But after the game against Chelsea he reacted to that, had problems with the leg, and we didn't want to take a risk.

363,13/04/2017,15:07,Klopp feared for Dortmund stars after bomb blast,Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says he feared for his former Borussia Dortmund players' safety after the bomb attack on their team bus.,"Three explosions went off as the Dortmund team made their way to their Signal Iduna Park stadium for the Champions League quarter-final first leg against Monaco on Tuesday. Klopp spent seven years as the German club's manager, signing many of Dortmund's current players, and as soon as he heard news of the attack he feared the worst. The German tried to contact his old team and was relieved when it emerged there were no fatalities, with Dortmund defender Marc Bartra needing surgery on a wrist injury as a result of the attack. ""Everyone can imagine it was a really difficult moment for me,"" Klopp said on Thursday. ""I don't know how often I have been in that hotel down the years. I know exactly where it is on that road and a lot of my friends were on the bus. ""I tried immediately to get some information. I was really concerned, scared for them (the players), I was scared for everyone. ""I had contact with a few people but I didn't want to bother them with my silly questions so I was waiting like all the rest of the world for more information."" Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel has criticised UEFA, European football's governing body, for disregarding the feelings of his squad by rescheduling the first leg to kick off less than 24 hours after the incident in Germany. Tuchel claims the club were informed of the decision by text message and Bartra was still in hospital while his team-mates were losing the first leg 3-2 to Monaco. Klopp agrees with Tuchel that UEFA underestimated the mental scars inflicted on the Dortmund players by such a traumatic experience. ""It's really, really difficult to find a date in this really tight schedule but I think everyone would have understood if they said they did not want to play it,"" he said. ""I saw it in the faces of my former players after the game and I saw the shock in their eyes and that was really hard. It will obviously take time to deal with it in a proper way. ""I'm pretty sure if some of the people who made the decision (to play the match) afterwards had been on the bus they would not have played the game but when you are not on the bus you cannot really imagine how it was exactly."" The German Federal Prosecutor's Office said three letters claiming responsibility found near the site of the attack made Islamic extremists the possible perpetrators. Security has been increased at Premier League grounds this season in the wake of terrorist attacks at sporting and non-sporting events around Europe, but Klopp said he had no specific concerns about the safety of himself or his players. ""All of us do everything we can do. Obviously there are a few people (terrorists) around who have new ideas and can you be prepared for that?"" he said. ""Am I concerned? No. But in all parts of life we can only give 100 per cent and I'm sure everyone is doing this to give you the best security you can have."""

Abdul Beset A. was detained in connection with the three explosions that rocked the Borussia Dortmund bus late Tuesday, injuring a player and a police officer. Federal prosecutors have called it a ""terrorist"" attack and said they are focusing on suspects in the ""Islamist spectrum"". But in a statement Thursday they acknowledged: ""The investigation has not found evidence that the suspect took part in the attack."" They said, however, that they now believe Abdul Beset A. joined the Islamic State group in Iraq in late 2014 and was the commander of a unit of around 10 fighters. ""The goal of the unit was to prepare kidnappings, abductions, extortion and killings,"" the prosecutors said. He crossed the border into Turkey in March 2015 and continued on in early 2016 to Germany ""where the suspect maintained contact with IS members,"" they added. Abdul Beset A. will appear Thursday before a judge who will decide on prosecutors' application for the arrest warrant."

The fixture was postponed 24 hours after three explosions rocked the Dortmund team coach and left Spain international Marc Bartra with a broken wrist as the Germans made their way to the ground ahead of Tuesday's scheduled kick-off. ""We felt completely passed over, it came down to 'tomorrow, you're playing',"" said Tuchel. ""Ultimately, it was decided in Nyon in Switzerland whether or not to play the next day. It was a somewhat powerless feeling. ""Each player had the right to start with a somewhat queasy feeling."" Police ramped up security in the city as German investigators detained an Islamist suspect following the roadside blast, but Tuchel criticised the call to go ahead with the game. ""We would have liked to have had more time to work through it,"" he added. ""There are players who easily brushed it off, but there are also players who really took it to heart. They are more thoughtful."" Dortmund defiantly vowed not to ""give in to terror"" after Tuesday's harrowing events, but the home side struggled early and fell behind on 19 minutes -- although only after Fabinho missed a rare penalty. Mbappe bundled in the opening goal before Sven Bender, filling in for Bartra in defence, headed into his own net to compound Dortmund's problems. Ousmane Dembele pulled one back for Dortmund on 57 minutes, but Mbappe fired in his second of the game to leave Monaco as favourites to reach the last four despite Shinji Kagawa's late strike. Extra forces were deployed around team hotels and their buses took designated safe routes to the stadium. Dortmund players wore t-shirts bearing a message of support for Bartra prior to kick-off, while goalkeeper Roman Burki warmed up in the defender's number five jersey. The 26-year-old was replaced in the line-up by Bender, while Monaco were without midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko due to suspension, as well full-backs Djibril Sidibe (appendicitis) and Benjamin Mendy (groin). Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang rifled a snap shot just over as the hosts fired an early warning. But Monaco were awarded a penalty when Mbappe was impeded by Sokratis Papastathopoulos, only for Brazilian Fabinho -- who had converted all 16 previous career spot-kicks -- to drag wide of the post. Their anguish lasted just two minutes, although there was a huge element of fortune involved as Monaco took the lead through Mbappe. Bernardo Silva found Thomas Lemar on the edge of the area, with the Frenchman's miscued effort forced in by Mbappe at the far post despite the forward straying offside. Kagawa then scuffed wide from an inviting low cross from Matthias Ginter, and that miss proved increasingly costly when Bender headed Andrea Raggi's delivery into his own net on 35 minutes. Tuchel rolled the dice at half-time by introducing Christian Pulisic and Nuri Sahin in place of the hapless Bender and Schmelzer, and the changes immediately reaped rewards. Pulisic tormented Raggi on the right wing, but it was a cross from Raphael Guerreiro on the left that led to Dembele reviving Dortmund's hopes. Aubameyang acrobatically flicked the ball into the path of Kagawa who squared for Dembele to slide into an empty net just before the hour. Falcao nearly landed a sucker punch as Dortmund pressed for an equaliser, blazing over on the stretch after rounding Burki following a superb pass from Lemar. But Mbappe was less forgiving, intercepting a risky pass from Lukasz Piszczek and sprinting towards the Dortmund goal before finishing coolly past Burki. Kagawa grabbed a lifeline for Dortmund with six minutes left, expertly controlling a Sahin cross and wriggling past Jemerson to slot beyond Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. But after ending Dortmund's 32-game unbeaten run at home, Leonardo Jardim's side will be confident of advancing to the semi-finals next Wednesday, although they will be without the suspended Fabinho."

367,12/04/2017,15:33,'Islamist' held as 'terrorist link' probed for Dortmund blasts,"German investigators on Wednesday detained an Islamist suspect over three explosions that rocked Borussia Dortmund's team bus, prosecutors said, confirming that the probe was examining a possible ""terrorist link"".","The roadside blasts left Dortmund's Spanish international Marc Bartra and a policeman injured, with the bombs ""containing metal pieces"" detonating minutes after the team bus set off to a planned Champions League game against Monaco on Tuesday night. The blast had a radius of more than 100 metres (yards), federal prosecutors said, adding it was lucky the toll was not higher. The match was postponed until Wednesday as security was ratcheted up around Dortmund and in Munich where Bayern Munich will take on Real Madrid. But a defiant Dortmund team vowed it won't ""give in to terror"", with players returning to the pitch for training. Extra forces were deployed around team hotels and their buses will take designated safe routes to the stadiums. Both Dortmund and Monaco fans were also out in force in downtown Dortmund, underlining their support for the players. Federal prosecutor's office spokeswoman Frauke Koehler said the probe was examining a possible ""terrorist link"", after three identical letters were found at the scene. ""An Islamist background appears to be possible,"" she said, noting the letter demanded that Germany withdraw its deployment of Tornado reconnaissance missions in the anti-IS international coalition and close the US air base in the western German town of Ramstein. ""Two suspects from the Islamist spectrum have become the focus of our investigation. Both of their apartments were searched, and one of the two has been detained,"" she added. Local media identified the suspects as a 25-year-old Iraqi and a 28-year-old German. At least one of the two could have been close to the scene at the time of the explosion, they said, quoting unnamed security sources who nevertheless urged caution on linking the individuals to the assault. Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was ""horrified"" by the ""repugnant act"", which Dortmund city's police chief Gregor Lange described as a ""targeted attack"" against the team, also known as BVB. Germany has been on high alert since a series of jihadist attacks last year, including a Christmas market assault in Berlin. Tuesday's explosives detonated minutes after the Dortmund team bus pulled away from the squad's hotel. Bartra underwent surgery on a broken wrist after he was hit by flying glass, Dortmund president Reinhard Rauball said. A policeman, who was on a motorcycle escorting the team bus, suffered trauma from the noise of the blasts, which shattered the bus windows. ""The bus turned on to the main road, when there was a huge noise -- a big explosion,"" Dortmund's Swiss goalkeeper Roman Burki told Swiss media. ""After the bang, we all crouched down in the bus. We did not know if more would come."" Some players hurled themselves to the ground, he said. Underlining the severity of the blast, prosecutors said a piece of metal shrapnel was lodged in the head-rest of a bus seat. As the squad geared up for kick-off at 6:45 pm (1645 GMT), Dortmund's chief executive Hans-Joachim Watze vowed that his side ""will play not only for ourselves today. We will play for everyone... we want to show that terror and hate can never determine our actions"". Monaco's vice president Vadim Vasilyev said ""football must not be taken hostage"", and pledged that the quarter-final would go ahead. In a show of solidarity, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere will also attend the match. The announcement that Tuesday's game was postponed was only made to the stadium packed with stunned fans, including families with young children, about 15 minutes before kick-off. Merkel praised supporters for their ""calm"" behaviour and the host side for their hospitality, after some Dortmund fans took in stranded Monaco supporters for the night. Boris Marchi, 26, who was wearing both the red and yellow scarf of his club Monaco as well as the yellow and black of Dortmund, said he was offered lodgings by a German supporter. ""It was really a beautiful moment, and meeting,"" he told AFP, adding that he was meeting his benefactor for a drink before kick-off. Bild put out a full-page advert in Dortmund's yellow and its BVB 09 logo, with the message: ""You'll never walk alone"". Further south in Munich, where the Bundesliga champions were facing Real Madrid, fans were also defiant. ""They try to scare us and get us to stop going to the stadium, but by going to the match, we show that we're not afraid and that they can't push us around,"" said Melina Peckruhl, who was heading to the match with her father."

370,12/04/2017,08:51,Police hunt suspect of Dortmund bus blast,"German investigators were hunting Wednesday for possible suspects responsible for three explosions that rocked the Borussia Dortmund football team's bus, injuring a player and a policeman.","The assault, described by Dortmund city's police chief as a ""targeted attack"" against the team, shook German football ahead of crucial Champions League ties. Investigations will focus on a letter claiming responsibility for the attack that was found close to the site of the blasts. ""The letter claims responsibility for what happened,"" prosecutor Sandra Luecke said late Tuesday, telling journalists that ""its authenticity is being verified"". German authorities have held off from describing it as a terror attack, saying it is too early to determine a motive. But Germany has been on high alert since a series of jihadist attacks last year, including the Christmas market truck assault in Berlin in December that killed 12 people. The explosives detonated minutes after the Dortmund team bus pulled away from the squad's hotel and headed for their quarter-final, first-leg, tie against Monaco. Spanish international Marc Bartra underwent surgery on a broken wrist after he was hit by flying glass. The injured policeman, who was on a motorcycle and had been escorting the team bus, suffered trauma from the noise of the blasts. Dortmund's quarter-final match will now be played on Wednesday evening, just hours before another Champions League clash in Germany between Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. ""We are assuming that they were a targeted attack against the Dortmund team,"" said the western German city's police chief Gregor Lange, adding however that it did not amount to an organised terror assault. The bus had set off for the Borussia stadium about 10 kilometres (six miles) away when ""three explosive charges detonated"" police said. The explosives, which went off shortly after 7:00 pm (1700 GMT), were hidden in a hedge and were detonated as the bus passed. The blast shattered the bus windows and the vehicle was burned on the right hand side. ""The bus turned onto the main road, when there was a huge noise -- a big explosion,"" Dortmund's Swiss goalkeeper Roman Burki told Swiss media. ""After the bang, we all crouched down in the bus. Anyone who could, threw himself on the floor. ""We did not know if more would come."" Burki said Bartra was ""hit by splinters of broken glass"". Dortmund's press spokesman said the 26-year-old had broken the radius bone in his right wrist. The club said other players were safe and there was no danger inside the Signal Iduna Park stadium. ""The whole team is in a state of shock, you can't get pictures like that out of your head,"" Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said. ""I hope the team will be in a position to be able to compete tomorrow on the pitch. ""In a crisis situation like this, Borussia pulls together."" Germany's best-selling Bild daily quoted anonymous sources saying that investigators were hunting for a likely getaway car used by the attacker. The vehicle had foreign car plates, said the newspaper, which also added that police believed the explosives were a particular type of pipe-bomb. The announcement that the game was postponed was only made to the stunned stadium about 15 minutes before Tuesday's match was due to start. Dortmund's president Reinhard Rauball said he believed the team would be ready for Wednesday's game. ""The players will be able to push this out of their minds and be in a position to put in their usual performances,"" he said. ""The worst thing would be if whoever committed this attack was now able to get to affect them through it."" But ex-Dortmund player Steffen Freund, who won the Champions League with Borussia in 1997, said there would be scars. ""When there has been a direct attack on the team bus, then it's not just forgotten by Wednesday,"" said the 47-year-old. ""Mentally and psychologically that is hard to absorb, it's a lot to deal with."" Dortmund police said security would be tightened at Wednesday's match, with a major deployment of officers to ""ensure that the game is played safely"". Separately, security was also being tightened at the Bayern-Real tie in Munich. Bild said both teams' hotels were under heavy police guard, and the squads' buses driven to a safe location."
371,12/04/2017,00:03,'Badly injured' Bartra has wrist surgery after bus attack,Spain international Marc Bartra underwent wrist surgery on Tuesday after being injured when the Borussia Dortmund team bus was rocked by a series of explosions that forced the postponement of their Champions League match against Monaco.,"Dortmund's press spokesman confirmed the 26-year-old Bartra needed an operation on his right wrist. ""Marc Bartra will be operated on, he has broken the radius (bone) in his right wrist and there are foreign bodies in the arm,"" said Sascha Fligge. ""The Borussia family has shown that we close ranks in difficult times and that's what we also want to do for Marc."" A police spokesman confirmed that Bartra's status had been changed from 'lightly' to 'badly injured'. Fligge said that with Dortmund scheduled to play Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga on Saturday, before next Wednesday's return leg at Monaco, there was no alternative but to reschedule the first leg for Wednesday. The Dortmund spokesman also confirmed the team bus had strengthened glass in its windows, but the force of the blasts still shattered several panes."

Local prosecutors also revealed that a letter has been found close to the site of the blasts, which struck shortly after the team bus drove off from the squad's hotel.

373,11/04/2017,21:35,Explosions wound player on Dortmund team bus,"Three explosions rocked the Borussia Dortmund bus, injuring Spanish international Marc Bartra, as the German team headed for a Champions League game against Monaco on Tuesday, police said.","Bartra was taken to hospital and the quarter-final first-leg match was postponed until Wednesday because of the attack. Other Dortmund players were said to be ""shocked"" but with no injuries. The bus had set off from the team hotel for the Borussia stadium about 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) away when ""three explosive charges detonated,"" said a police spokesman, Gunnar Wortmann. The explosions came shortly after 7.00pm (1700 GMT) on the Wittbraeuckerstrasse road. The bus windows were shattered, police and team officials said. Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke said Bartra, 26, suffered a hand injury and was being treated in hospital. The club said other players were safe and there was no danger inside the Signal Iduna Park stadium. ""There has been an attack with explosives on the team bus,"" said Watzke. ""The whole team is in a state of shock, you can't get pictures like that out of your head. ""I hope the team will be in a position to be able to compete tomorrow on the pitch. ""In a crisis situation like this, Borussia pulls together."" The announcement that the game was postponed until Wednesday was only made to the stunned stadium about 15 minutes before the game was due to start. UEFA said the match will now be played on Wednesday at 18.45 (1645 GMT). Dortmund relayed a copy of its Twitter announcement of the explosions inside the stadium to inform fans of events. The club urged fans in the stadium not to panic. ""We recommend to stay in the stadium and to keep calm to ensure an orderly departure,"" said a Dortmund Twitter statement. Germany has been on a high alert since last December's attack in Berlin, when a Tunisian national hijacked a truck and rammed it into a crowd, killing 12 people. The German national team, which included some Dortmund players, was involved in the November 13, 2015 Paris attacks which left about 130 dead. The German team spent the night at the Stade de France, which was one of the attacks of the Islamist militants. Their match against France had gone ahead despite the attacks by suicide bombers. They flew home the next morning. Four days later, a Germany-Netherlands friendly in Hanover was called off at short notice because of fears of an attack. Bartra's former team Barcelona quickly expressed sympathy to the player and the German club. ""All of our support to @MarcBartra, @BVB and their fans,"" said a Barcelona Twitter statement. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy also wished Bartra ""a speedy recovery,"" on his Twitter account."
374,10/04/2017,20:49,Falcao's return a big boost to Monaco - Jardim,Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim says the return of striker Radamel Falcao following his latest spell on the sidelines is a big boost to Monaco's chances in their Champions League quarter-final against Borussia Dortmund.,"French league leaders Monaco take on Dortmund in the first leg in Germany on Tuesday as they continue their bid to repeat their run to the final in 2004. The 31-year-old Colombian Falcao netted for Monaco in Saturday's 1-0 win at Angers in his first start since the end of February due to fitness issues. It was his 25th goal in 32 games this season in all competitions. The ex-Manchester United and Chelsea forward has hit six Champions League goals so far, including two at Manchester City in the 5-3 defeat in the last 16, first leg. Monaco won that tie on away goals thanks to a 3-1 win in the return at home, setting up the tie against Dortmund. ""Radamel Falcao's return means more quality and experience in our side,"" said Jardim. ""We have noticed the difference (he makes) before in the Champions League."" Falcao is set to partner teenage star Kylian Mbappe, already a full France international at 18, with Valere Germain making way. Monaco have been scoring an average of nearly three goals per game in Ligue 1. However, in Dortmund they will be missing right-back Djibril Sidibe, who was taken to hospital with appendicitis over the weekend. In addition, highly-rated midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko is suspended. ""We know we have a couple of problems with Sidibe and Bakayoko missing, but we must rely on our strength in depth,"" said Jardim. ""It will be a very intense game against a very good side with very good players."" Thomas Tuchel's Dortmund squad contains several members of the side which reached the Champions League final in 2013 before losing to Bayern Munich at Wembley. ""They have more European experience than we do, which is an advantage, and they have a deeper squad,"" added Jardim. ""We will have to play to our strengths and show who we are. But we also have to be wary of their quality when defending. There has to be a balance."" Monaco entered the Champions League in the third qualifying round in July, beating Fenerbahce of Turkey 4-3 on aggregate. ""It is not easy trying to play at full intensity every three days,"" said Jardim. ""I don't know if a team ever went from the third qualifying round to the quarter-finals. We have had the most games of any team so far."""

There are a lot of things we have to deal with,"" said Tuchel ahead of the clash at Dortmund's imposing Signal Iduna Park. The Dortmund boss has a mounting injury list and is rushing to get the likes of Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa, winger Andre Schuerrle, midfielder Julian Weigl and defender Lukasz Piszczek fit. The quartet all sat out Dortmund's 4-1 thumping at Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga on Saturday. ""There will be players coming back, we don't know in what condition they will be in, but we need them with strength, form and energy,"" added Tuchel. At least chief playmaker Marco Reus returned to training on Sunday after a month sidelined by a hamstring injury and could be an option. Even an appearance off the bench would boost the hosts' chances in what is likely to be a high-tempo clash between two teams who like to attack. ""Marco trained yesterday and I'm a fan of taking him along and possibly using him. We'll decide just before kick-off,"" Tuchel told reporters on Monday. Monaco fully deserve their last-eight berth having seen off Pep Guardiola's Manchester City with a stunning 3-1 second-leg win at home to progress on away goals after losing 5-3 in England. The French league leaders -- who score on average nearly three goals a game in Ligue 1 -- have problems of their own with right-back Djibril Sidibe set to miss out after being hospitalised with appendicitis over the weekend. Highly rated defensive midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko is suspended, meaning Joao Moutinho should start in central midfield. Despite their injury woes Dortmund are confident of beating Monaco over two legs to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time in four years, when they lost the 2013 final to Bayern Munich in London. ""We will try to play to our strengths and in all discussions it will be about being as brave as possible,"" added Tuchel. ""It's what makes us strong and we will try to score as many goals as possible. ""If we have the ball, we will attack. It is an advantage that we are at home for the first game because we can go on the offensive."" Dortmund have lost just one of their last 12 home games in Europe and can expect passionate support at Signal Iduna Park. ""The atmosphere here is the stadium is fantastic. The fans will put a lot of pressure on Monaco, which won't be the case for us in the return leg,"" said Dortmund midfielder Raphael Guerreiro. Dortmund top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has hit seven Champions League goals this season in a haul of 32 in all competitions, will be looking to remind Monaco what they missed out on. The French side allowed the Gabon striker to slip through their grasp during a loan spell in 2010/11. Monaco are enjoying a stellar season and their free-flowing attack has so far netted more than 130 goals in all competitions. The only blip was their 4-1 mauling by Paris Saint-Germain in the French League Cup final at the start of April. Monaco squeezed past Angers on Saturday with a 1-0 win as Radamel Falcao scored his 25th goal of the season. He is set to partner rising star Kylian Mbappe, 18, up front. Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim is concerned about the short turnaround in a busy -- and pivotal -- month for his exciting, young side. ""Against Dortmund the problem will not be possession, it will be having only two days to recover before we play in an international competition,"" he said."

377,10/04/2017,01:36,"Talent factories Monaco, Dortmund showcase shooting stars",Youth will be showcased on Tuesday when the talent factories of Borussia Dortmund and Monaco square off in the Champions League quarter-finals.,"Both clubs pride themselves on the business model of recruiting raw, young talent to nurture into superstars. The first-leg quarter-final at Borussia's Signal Park Iduna sees Monaco, whose squad average 25.3 years, shade Dortmund, at 25.6 years, for the youngest of the last eight teams in Europe. Both clubs are packed with rising stars. Dortmund's Christian Pulisic, is a fully-fledged US international who turns 19 in September. In April 2016, the attacking midfielder became the youngest foreigner to score in Bundesliga history. His rise through the US youth national teams was mirrored at Dortmund where he was promoted to the first-team after just 15 academy games. Monaco's forward Kylian Mbappe turns 19 in December and made his France debut last month. He broke Thierry Henry's 21-year-old record in December 2015 when he became Monaco's youngest player, aged 16 years and 347 days, then broke another Henry record two months later by scoring his first goal. Mbappe and Pulisic proved their worth in the Champions League last 16. Mbappe gave his side the lead to help beat Manchester City 3-1 in their stunning second-leg win, as Monaco went through on away goals after a 6-6 draw on aggregate. Likewise, Pulisic scored his first Champions League goal last month in the 4-0 second-leg win over Benfica. His second-half strike opened the floodgates as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang went on to score a hat-trick to progress 4-1 on aggregate. Both Dortmund and Monaco are seeing their recruitment policy bear fruit. Alongside Mbappe, Monaco have defender Djibril Sidibe, 24, defensive midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko and winger Bernardo Silva, both just 22 -- and all four are internationals. Likewise, Dortmund's winger Ousmane Dembele, 19, plays for France, Julian Weigl, 21, is a Germany international, Raphael Guerreiro, 23, won Euro 2016 with Portugal and Emre Mor is nicknamed ""the Turkish Messi"" by his home press. Both club's philosophies were born of financial necessity. Dortmund came back from the brink of bankruptcy in 2005, leaving CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke vowing never to spend heavily to buy in success. Dortmund make their money from the stock exchange, having first been floated in 2000, but spend carefully. On average, Dortmund spend 11.2 million euros ($10.5m) for a new player - a reasonable risk which leaves the door open to a huge increase if sold on. ""This is the only possible way for us,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc. ""Our turnover is about 200 million euros lower than the five or six biggest clubs in Europe and our payroll is around 100 million less."" Monaco are backed by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, who bought a 66.67 percent stake in December 2011. However, UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules led to the club being sanctioned for splashing out for Porto pair Joao Moutinho and James Rodrigeuz, plus Atletico Madrid's Radamel Falcao, in 2013. James was off-loaded to Real Madrid, Falcao went on loan to Manchester United, then Chelsea, and a policy change was implemented. Sidibe joined from Lille in 2016, Bakayoko from Rennes in 2014, Silva was permanently signed in 2015 after a loan spell from Benfica, but each reportedly came for 15 million euros or less. Yet all three are estimated to be worth at least double that. As Monaco's vice-president Vadim Vasilyev puts it: ""We are a selling club. But we do not have to sell if we do not want to."" Dortmund are already used to selling top players for double-digit sums. Before this season, Manchester United swooped for Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Manchester City signed Ilkay Gundogan and Bayern Munich spent 35 million on buying back Mats Hummels having sold him for 4.2m euros in 2009. Dortmund's goal-machine Aubameyang, who has scored 32 times in all competitions this season, could be next having hinted he may leave in June. The Gabon striker has made no secret of his desire to one day play for Real Madrid. Having paid Saint-Etienne 13 million euros for him in 2013, Dortmund can expect to make at least four times that."
378,07/04/2017,02:00,Bundesliga hot-shots face off in Germany's 'Klassiker',Strikers Robert Lewandowski and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang go head-to-head on Saturday when Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich host Borussia Dortmund in Germany's 'Der Klassiker' -- with both teams having one eye on Europe.,"And with Bayern 15 points clear of their rivals the Allianz Arena clash will see the pair continue their personal battle to be the Bundesliga's top scorer. Aubameyang netted Dortmund's final goal in Tuesday's 3-0 win over Hamburg to leave him with 25 goals -- one more than Lewandowski. The Poland forward had a scare in training on Thursday when he was left clutching his right thigh, but later wrote: ""Everything is fine. I will be ready."" on Twitter. ""This competition (with Aubameyang) pushes Robert along,"" said Bayern's left-back David Alaba. ""He wants to improve everyday. He shows that in every training session and in every game."" Dortmund's Aubameyang will want to cap his week to forget with another goal against Bayern. He fell offside with both Dortmund's bosses and team-mates alike last Saturday for wearing a mask in a goal celebration -- made by one of the club sponsors' rivals. Both clubs have an extra incentive to claim a moral-boosting win before next week's key European games. Bayern host Real next Wednesday in a mouth-watering Champions League quarter-final first-leg clash, while Dortmund host Monaco on Tuesday in their home-leg match. ""We want to win the game, to stay in the flow and take a good mood into the game against Real. That is our goal,"" said Alaba. Dortmund are chasing a second win over Carlo Ancelotti's Bayern this season after sealing a 1-0 victory over the Bavarians last November when Aubameyang hit the winner. It was Bayern's only league defeat this season until they stumbled to a 1-0 loss at Hoffenheim on Tuesday. ""We have to learn from the second half (in Hoffenheim), put in a good performance against Dortmund and be ready for the Champions League,"" said Dutch winger Arjen Robben. Despite the loss to Hoffenheim, Ancelotti's Bayern still hold a 10-point lead at the top of the table -- with Dortmund 15 points behind in fourth. The clubs will meet again later this month at the Allianz Arena in the last four of the German Cup in a repeat of last season's final, which Bayern won on penalties. The German media have borrowed and translated Spain's 'El Clasico' tag for Barcelona-Real Madrid matches and applied it to the Bundesliga's clash of the titans. ""It is an important game and something special for us, especially in front of a home crowd,"" added Alaba. Ancelotti rested play-maker Thiago Alcantara, captain Philipp Lahm and winger Franck Ribery against Hoffenheim and all are expected to return to face Dortmund. There is a question mark whether goalkeeper Manuel Neuer (foot) and forward Thomas Mueller (ankle), will be fit to face Dortmund, but Ancelotti says both will play Real. Dortmund winger Marco Reus is back in training following a five-week injury lay-off and is not expected to face Bayern, but captain Marcel Schmelzer has recovered from a knock. Bayern have won four of the last seven league meetings, with two wins for Dortmund and just one draw. The biggest margin in recent years was the 5-1 thrashing Bayern handed Dortmund in October 2015 when Lewandowski netted twice against his former club and Aubameyang netted Borussia's consolation.

379,05/04/2017,15:00,Tuchel defends Aubameyang after mask fiasco,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's recent mask-wearing exploits landed him in hot water with Borussia Dortmund's bosses, but his coach Thomas Tuchel has leapt to the defence of the Gabon hot-shot.","""Such a sensitive human being like Auba is affected when so much is said and written about him -- even if he has himself to blame,"" said Tuchel. ""The goal in this situation, with it's background, was very important for us and Auba."" The goal Tuchel refered to was Aubameyang's 25th in as many league matches which sealed Tuesday's 3-0 win over Hamburg to make him the Bundesliga top-scorer, one ahead of Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski. Tuchel made Aubameyang captain for the night against Hamburg with regular skipper Marcel Schmelzer injured. The striker set up Shinji Kagawa for Dortmund's second, then netted his own goal just before the final whistle with an ice-cold finish after rounding Hamburg's goalkeeper. Being handed the captain's armband was a show of faith after Dortmund's goal machine once again fell offside with Borussia's senior bosses on Saturday -- the ""situation"" and ""background"" Tuchel was referring to. He donned a red-and-orange wrestling mask for his goal celebration in the 1-1 Ruhr derby draw at Schalke. The problem is sportswear giants Puma own a five percent share in Dortmund and Aubameyang wore the same mask in an advert for private sponsor Nike. Puma has called on Dortmund to take action, especially after Aubameyang had the Nike logo shaved into his hair last month -- which had already landed him in trouble with Borussia's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. To make matters worse, Aubameyang picked up a yellow card in Gelsenkirchen for his masked celebration -- his third of the season -- and two more would see him banned for one league match. The flamboyant striker has donned masks in the past to celebrate goals -- a spiderman headpiece in 2014 and a Batman one in 2015. But while the superhero masks can be excused as harmless fun, the Nike one is part of a clear marketing strategy and German daily Bild claims the club will fine Aubameyang at least 50,000 euros ($53,317). His team-mates are also not amused by the off-field disruption the mask caused ahead of next Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final first leg at home to Monaco and Saturday's Bundesliga clash at leaders Bayern Munich. ""We thought within the team that he'd come up with something for the derby, but the way it happened is, of course, stupid. No one had a clue,"" Dortmund captain Marcel Schmelzer told German daily Bild. ""We had already spoken to him, the club will talk to him once more and make it clear internally. Auba is already aware. ""We know what we have in him and he knows what he has with us. ""It's important that we don't lose the 'we' feeling and Auba knows that -- 100 percent,"" Schmelzer added. Dortmund were in grave danger of conceding an equaliser against Hamburg on Tuesday until Aubameyang helped turn the game with an assist for Kagawa on 81 minutes before his injury time goal. ""I'm torn in how to sum up the game,"" said Tuchel. ""We had many clear chances, but also played negligently -- it was a rollercoaster ride."""
380,03/04/2017,15:35,Mask stunt to cost Aubameyang heavy fine - report,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's latest masked goal-celebration is reportedly set to cost him a fine of at least 50,000 euros ($53,317) after again falling offside with his club Borussia Dortmund.","The 27-year-old Gabon hot-shot hit his 24th Bundesliga goal this season in Saturday's 1-1 away draw against Schalke and celebrated by pulling on an black-and-orange wrestling mask. The latest stunt came after he also wore Spiderman and Batman masks to celebrate goals for Dortmund in August 2014 and February 2015 respectively. But what first appeared to be harmless fun in Gelsenkirchen against Schalke soon emerged to have been part of a marketing strategy. According to German daily Bild on Monday, his masked celebration will result in a five-figure fine, because the mask he donned against Schalke is the same one he wore while filming an advert for his private sponsor Nike. The main problem is that rival sportswear brand Puma are shareholders in Borussia Dortmund. Aubameyang is already in trouble with Dortmund's bosses for having the distinctive Nike logo shaved into his head last month. ""It's not on that we are forced in this way to push through the economic interests of Nike. Our partner is Puma,"" Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke told Bild. ""This act is unworthy of a large corporation. A serious (business) relationship is different to that. ""The relationship is currently significantly strained at the moment,"" he added, referring to the club's relations with Nike. According to Bild, Aubameyang will meet with the club's bosses after Tuesday's home league game against Hamburg to be told any similar stunt will lead to a drastically increased fine. Puma, who hold a five percent share in Dortmund, say they hope the club will react. ""We are wondering why our competitor is putting players in such a situation,"" said a spokesman. ""We are convinced Dortmund will draw the right conclusions from the incident."" Aubayemang, who has said he one day wants to play for Real Madrid, has a Dortmund contract until 2020, but he twice hinted at the start of the year that he is considering leaving at the end of the season."
381,01/04/2017,18:50,Masked Aubameyang back in black for goal celebration,Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrated his latest goal against arch-rivals Schalke by again donning a black mask after scoring in Saturday's derby.,"The 27-year-old, who has hinted he may leave Dortmund at the end of the season, netted his 24th goal in as many Bundesliga games this season to put Dortmund 1-0 up on 53 minutes in Gelsenkirchen in the 150th Ruhr derby. The Gabon international was thrown a black-and-orange wrestling-style mask from the sidelines as he ran to celebrate with team-mates after scoring for the fifth time in eight games against Schalke. It was not the first time he has donned an elaborate mask to commemorate hitting the net against the Royal Blues. In February 2015, Dortmund's self-styled 'Batman' wore a caped crusader mask, like that of the fictional superhero, after netting in that year's Ruhr derby. On that occasion Germany winger Marco Reus joined in the fun by wearing a Robin mask as they both scored in a 3-0 home win. Aubameyang's goal on Saturday left him level with Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski in the battle to be this season's top scorer in Germany. Both players have each scored 24 league goals this campaign. However, Dortmund's hopes of an away win to go third in Germany's top flight were dashed when Thilo Kehrer, 20, slotted home his first Bundesliga goal in only his 12th game to the delight of Schalke fans. The hosts were then denied a penalty in the dying stages when the ball struck Dortmund defender Marc Bartra's hands. The decision so incensed Markus Weinzierl that the Schalke coach was sent to the stands as the draw left Dortmund fourth in the table with Schalke ninth."

384,30/03/2017,15:21,Dortmund swoop for 'Gladbach starlet Dahoud,"Syrian-born Mahmoud Dahoud will leave Borussia Moenchengladbach and join Dortmund in a 10-million-euro ($10.7m) deal in the next transfer window, it was reported Thursday.","Dahoud was on the radar of Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain and had just a year left on his current contract. ""Mo Dahoud is extremely talented and just right for our midfield,"" Dortmund sports director Michael Zorc said of the 21-year-old. ""He has already proved he has what it takes at the top level,"" he added. Born in Syria in 1996 Dahoud hails from a Kurdish community and his parents fled their hometown Amuda when he was still a baby. He joined Moenchengladbach in 2010 at 14 and developed into a Germany under-21 international under Lucien Favre, now doing well with a young squad at Nice. Dortmund also have a bevvy of young stars including teenage strikers Ousmane Dembele, Christian Pulisic and Germany's 21-year-old defensive midfielder Julian Weigl."
385,17/03/2017,22:56,Aubameyang nets winner as Dortmund labour,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the Bundesliga's top-scorer, claimed his 23rd goal in as many league games as Borussia Dortmund laboured to a 1-0 home win over strugglers Ingolstadt on Friday.","Aubameyang's first-half winner was his 30th goal in all competitions for Dortmund this season. Borussia remain third in the table, narrowing the gap behind RB Leipzig to three points, but 13 adrift of runaway leaders Bayern Munich. Borussia, who have drawn Monaco in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, were missing a host of stars, but there was no disguising a poor display. Ingolstadt, who enjoyed 14 shots on goal to Dortmund's 10, are second from bottom and seven points from safety, but matched Dortmund and should have been awarded a second-half penalty. ""I was already getting ready to save the penalty,"" admitted Dortmund's goalkeeper Roman Burki after the referee missed his foul on Dario Lezcano on 52 minutes. ""I was glad 'Auba' got his goal, because without it, things would have been even harder for us, but the most important thing was the three points."" Burki had a busy night and admitted Dortmund were tired from their rescheduled German Cup win at minnows Sportfreunde Lotte on Tuesday to reach the semi-finals. With Germany winger Marco Reus injured and 19-year-old Ousmane Dembele suspended, Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel rotated his squad. US teenage international Christian Pulisic, 18, and Japan's Shinji Kagawa filled the attacking midfield roles behind Aubayemang. The Gabon star needed just 14 minutes to add to his goals tally and remain two clear of Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski in the race to be the top scorer this season. Kagawa started the move in midfield and fed Marcel Schmelzer, who provided the cross from the left which Aubameyang rifled home. However, Dortmund lived dangerously in the second half and were far from convincing as Ingolstadt grew in confidence with Australia forward Mathew Leckie leading the attack. Only Burki's close-range save denied Leckie. With 30 minutes to go, Tuchel lost patience with the ineffective Raphael Guerreiro, who won just three of his 10 challenges, and replaced him with Germany's Julian Weigl in the defensive midfield. Leckie could have again rescued a point just before the final whistle, but he skied a chance over the bar."
386,15/03/2017,16:59,'Goetze's season over': Dortmund,Borussia Dortmund admitted on Wednesday the season is over for Germany's fallen star Mario Goetze as the World Cup winner continues his battle against an unspecified metabolism disorder.,"The world appeared to be at the gifted Goetze's feet in 2014 when his extra-time goal won the World Cup final at Rio de Janeiro's iconic Maracana stadium. But his career has gradually gone off the boil since then, culminating in the recent revelation he has metabolism disorder. ""Provided his treatment goes positively, Goetze can start again with performance-orientated training in early summer,"" Dortmund said. ""The overall sporting goal for the player is to be fully operational for the start of next season,"" which starts on Friday August 18 in Germany. The Dortmund website said: ""good news for Mario Goetze: Borussia Dortmund's Germany international speaks positively about the first phase of his treatment,"" but included no direct quotes. Last month, Dortmund, who have reached the Champions League's quarter-finals, revealed tests to see why Goetze had been suffering from repeated injury and a lack of form had shown up 'metabolic disturbances'. Goetze, who has won 62 caps for Germany, was then sent for specialist help and Borussia's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has said it would not be a ""short-term issue"". Last July, Dortmund paid 22 million euros ($23m) to buy Goetze back from Bayern Munich, having been forced to sell him in 2013 for 37 million euros after the Bavarians triggered a release clause. However, poor form and injury meant he has played just six games over the 90 minutes this season and he has been a shadow of the player whO left Dortmund in 2013. Meanwhile, Dortmund announced on Wednesday they have extended the deal of midfielder Gonzalo Castro, 29, until 2020. Castro is the third first-team player Dortmund have locked into a long term contract recently after Julian Weigl (until 2021) and US teenage international Christian Pulisic (2020). The club has also told Germany's bad-boy World Cup winner Kevin Grosskreutz, who hails from Dortmund, he can train with Borussia's reserve team after he was sacked in disgrace by second division VfB Stuttgart. ""If he asks us, our answer will definitely be 'yes'. Kevin will always have a place with us and is part of the Borussia Dortmund family,"" said the club in a statement. Grosskreutz was part of the Germany squad which won the 2014 World Cup, but Stuttgart sacked him after he reportedly took three youth team players with him on a boozy night out, which ended in a brawl. He won the Bundesliga twice during a succesful six-year stint with Dortmund, who he left in 2015, and also played in their 2013 Champions League final defeat to Bayern Munich at Wembley."
387,13/03/2017,02:05,Giantkillers Lotte next up for Dortmund,Borussia Dortmund hope to set up a mouth-watering clash against holders Bayern Munich by ending the run of third-division minnows Sportfreunde Lotte in Tuesday's rescheduled German Cup quarter-final.,"The tie has been moved to Osnabruck's Bremer Bruecke stadium after the original fixture at Lotte's tiny ground had to be postponed because a heavy snowfall before kick-off left the greasy playing surface unplayable. ""I would have prefered an easier opponent, but even against Borussia we have our chance,"" insisted Lotte's coach Ismail Atalan. Lotte have had plenty of giantkilling experience this season, beating Bundesliga sides Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen, plus second-division 1960 Munich, en route to the in previous rounds. Dortmund are currently third in Germany's top flight and into the draw for Friday's draw for the quarter-finals of the Champions League with star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang having scored eight goals in four games. But Dortmund crashed to a 2-1 defeat at Hertha Berlin on Saturday as they suffered from a chronic inability to finish their chances. ""It is another game, another competition and we want to go through, but again this will be played on a heavy ground,"" said Dortmund captain Marcel Schmelzer. Lotte are third in Germany's third division and should Dortmund prevail, they will face holders Bayern in the last four at the end of April in a repeat of last year's final, which the Bavarians won on penalties. Dortmund will be without centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos and will be playing their third game in seven days after the win over Benfica and defeat to Hertha."
388,11/03/2017,14:49,Dortmund boss expects Aubameyang to stay... for now,"Borussia Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke says he expects star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to remain with the Bundesliga giants, for now.","The Gabon hot-shot has hit 28 goals this season, including the hat-trick against Benfica on Wednesday which fired Dortmund into the Champions League's quarter-finals. He has scored seven goals in three games prior to Saturday's league match at Hertha Berlin. The 27-year-old has a contract with Dortmund until 2020, but admitted in January that he is considering leaving in June to take 'the next step' in his career. He has made no secret he wants to eventually join Real Madrid to fulfil a promise he made to his grandfather just before he passed away. ""'Auba' has a contract until 2020. We know what we have in him, but he also knows what he has with us,"" Watzke told German daily Bild. Watzke says Aubameyang knows Dortmund's squad, including Germany's Marco Reus, plus teenagers Ousmane Dembele and Christian Pulisic, has the potential to challenge Bayern Munich's domination of the German league. ""I have not had the feeling on a single day since he has been with us that 'Auba' wants to leave and I believe that he feels that a big team is growing here,"" said Watzke. ""I also see how he gets on well with players like Dembele, Reus or Pulisic and all the others. ""That's why I'm not thinking about it (Aubameyang leaving) at the moment."" But should Dortmund's prized hot-shot put in a transfer request, Watzke says they will not stop him. ""What he have said is that if 'Auba' wants to leave us, we will get together and discuss everything in peace, but, like I said, I do not have the feeling that is the case,"" said Watzke. Should Aubameyang leave in June, Dortmund can command a much higher fee than the 13 million euros ($13.7m) they reportedly paid Saint-Etienne for him in 2013. His current market value is around 65m euros. Having had to watch Robert Lewandowski leave for arch-rivals Bayern in 2014 on a free transfer, Dortmund will not want to make the same mistake twice."
389,10/03/2017,01:50,Five things to look for in the Bundesliga,Eintracht Frankfurt must contend with both illness and a rampant Bayern Munich while Hertha Berlin hope to halt high-flying Borussia Dortmund.,"Here are five things to look out for in the Bundesliga this weekend: Eintracht Frankfurt's squad has been hit by a virus ahead of Saturday's match at leaders Bayern Munich. Bayern have scored 25 goals in six games, notably notching up a 10-2 aggregate win over Arsenal in the last 16 of the Champions League. Germany's Jerome Boateng is set to make his first Bayern appearance after shoulder surgery. Bayern drew 2-2 at sixth-placed Eintracht in October, but Frankfurt coach Niko Kovac has low expectations. ""If I can write the names of 18 fit players on the team sheet, I'll be happy,"" he said. Defenders Michael Hector and Timothy Chandler, plus goal-scoring captain Alex Meier are amongst those affected by a stomach virus. Hertha Berlin host Borussia Dortmund on Saturday with Pal Dardai admitting he abandoned pre-match analysis to watch Barcelona's stunning win over PSG. The Hertha coach saw Dortmund's 4-0 Champions League win over Benfica on Wednesday on television, but switched channels to see the end of Barca's stunning 6-1 comeback win after his three football-mad sons protested. ""In all honesty, I turned over quick when I heard the score -- thank god -- because everyone who saw the Barca game can learn a thousand things,"" said Dardai. Hertha suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at Hamburg last weekend and lost to Dortmund last month in a penalty shoot-out in the the German Cup round of 16. The teams also drew 1-1 in Dortmund last October. Hertha face a busy afternoon trying to contain Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who has hit seven goals in three games, including a hat-trick against Benfica. Tayfun Korkut makes his debut as Bayer Leverkusen coach against Werder Bremen on Friday in a final warm-up before their daunting Champions League clash at Atletico Madrid. Leverkusen replaced Roger Schmidt with ex-Hanover boss Korkut, 42, following their 6-2 mauling by Dortmund. Leverkusen have lost five of their last seven games and are 10th in Germany's top flight, 11 points away from the Champions League places. Next Wednesday, Leverkusen will try to overturn their 4-2 home-leg defeat against Atletico. ""There is no reason to fight fires here,"" said Korkut. ""I feel great willingness in the team, they are very eager, willing and highly motivated."" Leverkusen captain Lars Bender is doubtful, while Bremen skipper Clemens Fritz is out for the rest of the season with an injured ankle. Bremen's ex-Arsenal winger Serge Gnabry is doubtful with a knee injury. Second-placed RB Leipzig hope to have playmaker Naby Keita fit for Saturday's home match against Wolfsburg. The Guinean midfielder injured his foot in last weekend's 2-2 draw at Augsburg, but an MRI scan has revealed only bruising. Leipzig's top scorer Timo Werner, who has 14 goals, could pile more misery on Wolfsburg and new coach Andries Jonker, their third this season. The Dutchman has come in with the 2009 German champions only above the relegation places on goal difference and began his tenure with a 1-1 draw against Mainz. Relegation-threatened Hamburg want to back up last weekend's shock win over Hertha Berlin at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday. Despite taking 21 points from their last 13 league games, including wins over Leverkusen and Leipzig, Hamburg remain in the bottom three. They are fighting to keep their status as the Bundesliga's only ever-present side, having appeared in every top-flight campaign since its inception in 1963-64. ""The blame lies with the first 10 games, when we took only two points,"" explained ex-Germany goalkeeper Rene Adler. Under Dieter Hecking, who took charge in December, Gladbach have posted impressive recent wins over Ingolstadt and Schalke to climb to ninth. Attacking midfielder Lars Stindl has scored four goals in his last five games. Fixtures (all times 1330 GMT unless stated)"
390,09/03/2017,04:49,Tuchel hails Dortmund's 'sensational' Aubameyang,Thomas Tuchel hailed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 'sensational' hat-trick after Borussia Dortmund's 4-0 romp at home to Benfica saw the Germans steamroll their way into the Champions League quarter-finals.,"Aubameyang has now scored seven times in his last three games and has seven Champions League goals in as many matches this season. The result saw Dortmund win 4-1 on aggregate after their 1-0 defeat in Lisbon last month. ""It was a sensational performance,"" enthused Dortmund coach Tuchel. ""I love goals like his first one, because they need such good timing and Auba is always where he needs to be."" Aubameyang's first Champions League hat-trick was redemption after his night to forget in the first leg, when he missed four clear chances including a second-half penalty. ""We saw the real Aubameyang tonight as opposed to the first leg when I think his brother played,"" quipped Tuchel. ""That was the perfect time for 'Auba' to get his hat-trick. ""For a goal-scorer, there is nothing more important than to score and he has a nose for goal."" Aubameyang is on 28 goals for the season as Dortmund reached the last eight in Europe for the first time since 2014. Aubameyang took the man-of-the-match award, but US international Christian Pulisic, who only turns 19 in September, was outstanding. The teenager set up Aubameyang's opening goal with just four minutes gone, then netted the crucial second on 59 minutes to put Dortmund ahead in the tie and Aubameyang added the third two minutes later ""Christian is a very self-confident person and he can draw on his potential on moments like tonight,"" added Tuchel. ""Along with the rest of the team, he put in an exceptional second-half performance."" Having cancelled out Kostas Mitroglou's first-leg goal early on, Tuchel admitted Dortmund ""lost our way after 25 minutes, but the second half was a top performance. ""If I say that I expected this result it would mean that we have a lack of respect for Benfica. ""Benfica are a great, proud club and we have huge respect for them but we played two great games and I think we deserved to go through."" The defeat ensured more German pain for Benfica, who have now lost 15 times in 23 European games away to Bundesliga clubs. ""We played well up until the point when the opponent scored two goals in quick succession,"" said Benfica coach Rui Vitoria. ""We didn't start well, conceding after only four minutes, but then we found our way. ""We had a few goal chances in the second half, but we didn't use them and we didn't react once they got their quick goals ""We can't say everything was bad, the result was bad, but we played well in places and had our chances. ""We did all we could to reach the next round, we fought, but it wasn't enough and of course, we're sad after the result."" Tuchel said he had no preference who his side plays in the last eight. However, he admitted the euphoria of their victory turned into disbelief in the dressing room as the Dortmund squad watched the closing stages of Barcelona's stunning 6-1 win over Paris St Germain. ""We watched the last two minutes of the (Barcelona-PSG) game, we thought we were the sensational news of the round, but that clearly wasn't to be,"" Tuchel said with a smile."
391,08/03/2017,22:49,Aubameyang hat-trick fires Dortmund into quarters,A hat-trick by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Christian Pulisic's dazzling display fired Borussia Dortmund into the Champions League quarter-finals with a 4-0 thrashing of Benfica on Wednesday.,"The result saw Dortmund win the round-of-16 tie 4-1 on aggregate after Aubameyang's early goal cancelled out Borussia's 1-0 defeat in Lisbon last month. The Gabon hot-shot has now scored seven times in his last three games and has seven Champions League goals in as many matches this season. He is on 28 goals for the season as Dortmund reached the last eight in Europe for the first time since 2013/14. But it fell to US international Pulisic, who only turns 19 in September, to net the Germans' crucial second on 59 minutes, which put Dortmund ahead for the first time on aggregate. Pulisic, in for injured Germany winger Marco Reus, claimed his first Champions League goal and set up Aubameyang's opening goal in an impressive all-round display. After Kostas Mitroglou sealed Benfica's 1-0 first-leg victory, Dortmund took just four minutes to cancel out the advantage. Ousmane Dembele's corner was flicked on by Pulisic to Aubameyang, who headed home at the far post to delight the sell-out Signal Iduna Park crowd. It was redemption for the Gabon striker, who had a night to forget in the first leg, missing four clear chances including a penalty in Lisbon. After a strong start from the hosts, Benfica clawed their way back with captain Luisao heading straight at Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki from a free-kick midway through the half. Dembele showed his youth, needlessly picking up a booking from English referee Martin Atkinson late in the first half for bitterly complaining after conceding a free-kick with a push on Andreas Samaris. Benfica grew in confidence as the half wore on and Dortmund's defence wobbled, but it finished 1-0 at the break. Dortmund had a big let-off soon after when Lukasz Piszczek failed with a clearance, which Franco Cervi snapped up on the edge of the box, but his shot was blocked. Aubameyang then squandered three golden chances at close range before Pulisic finally got the breakthrough. The US starlet chipped his shot over the advancing Ederson on 59 minutes after Piszczek's superb pass into the area. Aubameyang grabbed his second just two minutes later when he stabbed home Marcel Schmelzer's pass. He hit his third goal of the night on 85 minutes when Erik Durm's run and cross from the right handed him a simple tap-in."

However, Benfica's record on German soil is poor with 14 defeats in 22 European games and just two victories. Rui Vitoria's Benfica has won their last seven games in all competitions, including the first leg when Borussia's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had a night to forget -- missing four chances including a penalty. Dortmund were dealt a pre-match blow on Saturday when Germany winger Marco Reus tore his left hamstring in their 6-2 rout of Leverkusen as Aubameyang netted twice to stretch his league goals tally this season to 21. Despite the goal-fest against Leverkusen, defensive lynchpin Sokratis insists Dortmund ""have to play 300 percent better"" and use their home advantage to reach the quarter-finals. ""It would be very bad if we didn't make it,"" admitted the Greece international as victory would earn Dortmund 10 million euros ($10.5M), which includes a 6.5m euros premium from UEFA, for reaching the last eight. Dortmund are confident of progressing. ""I think we are the favourites for tomorrow,"" said midfielder Gonzalo Castro. ""We were clearly the better team in the away leg, we just didn't score. ""We can't concede a goal, or it will make our task even harder, but I think we're ready."" Benfica's in-form forward Mitroglou, who grew up in Germany, can rival Aubameyang having scored 18 goals in his last 17 games. ""Of course, we are preparing to face Mitroglou, but it would not do them justice if we focus on just one player,"" said Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel. ""In the last 16, you face the best and Mitroglou is part of that. ""We need a top performance, but must also be effective. ""The fact Aubameyang has now scored again is very important for his self-confidence and tomorrow would be a good time to continue his run."" Benfica's Brazilian midfielder Filipe Augusto has shaken off an ankle injury, while Dortmund are missing midfielders Sven Bender, Sebastian Rode, Mario Goetze and Reus. Tuchel revealed Portugal midfielder Raphael Guerreiro is doubtful having suffered a hardening in his thigh and missed training on Tuesday. With play-maker Reus sidelined, the pressure falls on teenage winger Ousmane Dembele and Aubameyang to provide the goals, but defender Marc Bartra says patience is required. ""It's going to be difficult, we must remain patient and calm,"" said the ex-Barcelona centre-back. ""We have to stand up well at the back, the goals will come."" Benfica boss Vitoria says his side will be ""playing for their lives"" at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park and it's famous South Stand, nicknamed the 'Gelbe Wand' (Yellow wall), which holds 25,000 home fans. Dortmund fans will look to one of the club's famous nights, on December 4, 1963, when they swept Benfica aside 5-0 at home, winning the European Champions' Cup first-round tie 6-2 on aggregate, despite having lost the first-leg 2-1 in Portugal. For added motivation, according to German daily Bild, Dortmund's club bosses have earmarked 100,000 euros per player as an extra bonus."

Dortmund fans will look to one of the club's famous nights, on December 4, 1963, when they swept Benfica aside 5-0 at home, winning the European Champions' Cup first-round tie 6-2 on aggregate, despite having lost the first-leg 2-1 in Portugal. For added motivation, according to German daily Bild, Dortmund's club bosses have earmarked 100,000 euros per player as an extra bonus."
394,07/03/2017,02:15,The rise of Dortmund's 'wunderkind' Dembele,"With Germany winger Marco Reus injured, French 'wunderkind' Ousmane Dembele will look to shine as Borussia Dortmund bid to overturn a first leg deficit against Benfica in the Champions League.","Dortmund host Benfica at their Westfalenstadion home in the last 16 second-leg on Wednesday looking to overturn a 1-0 defeat in Portugal three weeks ago. But the bitter news Dortmund were dreading was confirmed on Sunday -- club captain Reus tore his hamstring in their 6-2 rout of Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday and is out until April. The loss of Reus is a significant blow, but Dembele was on fire against Leverkusen and is enjoying a stellar first season in Dortmund. The 19-year-old France winger has justified the 15 million euros ($15.9m) Borussia paid Rennes for him by scoring six league goals and providing eight assists this season. ""I'm enjoying myself, but I can do better,"" said the gangly Dembele. The teenager showcased his dazzling skills with the opening goal on Saturday, turning Leverkusen's Tin Jedvaj inside out firing home on six minutes. He then earned the corner that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang converted to make it 2-0 with just 26 minutes gone. The French teenager has been attracting 'Wunderkind' headlines with Dortmund since July when he ghosted past Manchester United's Luke Shaw and Marco Rojo before scoring an outrageous solo goal in Dortmund's 4-1 win on a pre-season tour of China. ""I'm not a phenomenon, I'm just trying to be decisive for my team-mates, there are a lot of talented young people in football,"" Dembele modestly told AFP in a roundtable interview. Off the pitch, Dembele's introduction to Germany's top tier has been eased by fellow French-speaker Aubameyang, whom he regards as ""a brother"". The league's top-scorer has benefited from Dembele's pin-point crosses this season on his way to netting 21 goals in as many matches. Dortmund have been careful to shield their rising star. His transition to the Ruhr Valley has been helped by close friend Moustapha Diatta, 18, a neighbour from his home town of Evreux in Normandy who plays for Dortmund's reserves. Dembele says he came to Dortmund to learn his trade. He has ironed out the early season chinks, no longer ""stupidly losing the ball"", as he puts it, and improving his finishing, which he demonstrated against Leverkusen. But as German magazine Kicker observed: ""We can excuse a few lost balls when he attracts so many spectators to their seats."" Dembele says he is revelling in the talent around him, including the likes of Portugal international Raphael Guerreiro and German Julian Weigl, not to mention Aubameyang, known as 'PEA'. ""Guerreiro and Weigl look for me between the lines, 'PEA' makes good calls and we combine well with Reus,"" said Dembele with obvious delight. Dembele also won respect from Kicker, who dubbed him ""a fighter"" by cooly nailing Dortmund's opening spot-kick in a penalty shoot-out win over Hertha Berlin in the German Cup last month, despite suffering from cramp. Bayern Munich are again running away with the Bundesliga but Dortmund, the 2013 Champions League finalists, have their eyes on other prizes. They are bidding to reach the quarter-finals in Europe for the first time in three years and are through to the last eight of the German Cup. It leaves Dembele brimming with expectation in first season in Germany ""to win something -- at least one trophy""."
395,06/03/2017,01:45,"Barca seek miracle as Bayern, Real eye quarters",Barcelona striker Neymar vowed his side will throw everything at Paris Saint-Germain in their bid to overturn a four-goal deficit in the Champions League last 16 this week.,"PSG fired a significant warning of intent throughout Europe with a 4-0 rout of Barca in the French capital three weeks ago and will aim to complete the job in the return leg at the Camp Nou on Wednesday. But the Catalan giants go into the game buoyed by thumping 6-1 and 5-0 wins in their past two league matches and haven't given up hope of staging an unprecedented comeback. No side has lost 4-0 away from home in Europe and gone through in a two-legged tie, but with Barca's prolific front three of Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez they cannot be entirely discounted. ""Against PSG we will run and fight and then we will see what happens,"" said Neymar. ""It's really important that our spirit is on the way up and our confidence too. I see us on the up and with confidence. On Wednesday we are going to play really well."" Barca knocked PSG out at the quarter-final stage in both 2012-13 and 2014-15, but the reigning French champions have the upper hand this time and January signing Julian Draxler is confident of reaching the last eight for the fifth year in succession. ""Many teams have lost 5-0 at the Camp Nou, we know that anything is possible,"" Draxler told PSG's club website. ""But deep down I'm convinced we'll qualify for the quarter-finals. ""I think it will be important to attack and not just think about defending."" Bayern Munich have one foot in the next round after thrashing Arsenal 5-1 at the Allianz Arena and look set to eliminate the Gunners in the last 16 for the third time in the past five seasons. ""We have a big advantage, but Arsenal are dangerous, so we have to go full throttle to win,"" said Spain international Javi Martinez, who netted his first goal of the season in Saturday's 3-0 victory at Cologne. Philipp Lahm will miss the game through suspension, but the Bayern skipper said his team-mates would aim to extinguish any lingering hopes Arsene Wenger's men have right from kick-off in London. ""We have to be highly focused and, most importantly, show Arsenal in the first quarter-hour they can forget the next round,"" Lahm said ahead of Tuesday's clash, with the Premier League side staring at a seventh straight last-16 exit. Holders Real Madrid head to Napoli as clear favourites after a 3-1 win in the Spanish capital, but such an advantage has not always proved a guarantee of success for the record 11-time champions. Real have held a similar lead on eight previous occasions in European competition but only progressed half of the time, providing Napoli with reason to dream they can pull off a shock. ""We believe in it. We know we can score two goals at the San Paolo. We also know it will be quite a job for our defenders,"" Senegalese centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly told AFP following Saturday's 2-1 win at Roma in Serie A. Borussia Dortmund trail 1-0 ahead of the visit of Benfica to Signal Iduna Park on Wednesday. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang missed a penalty as Kostas Mitroglou's second-half strike in Lisbon last month gave the Portuguese outfit the edge in their tie. But the Gabonese striker netted his 20th and 21st goals of the Bundesliga season in Saturday's 6-2 drubbing of Bayer Leverkusen to move back in front of Bayern marksman Robert Lewandowski at the top of the scoring charts. However, the victory came at a cost with Germany international Marco Reus ruled out for four weeks after tearing his hamstring. ""It's sad news, he (Reus) has been playing very consistently for weeks and at a high level,"" said Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel. ""It's an enormous loss which tarnishes the win."""

""The duration of the bans has been determined mainly by the age of the people, but also according to their past behaviour,"" Hendrik Grosse Lefert, chief security officer for the DFB, said. The minimum nationwide stadium ban handed out was four months for the gang, who were found with flares, helmets and combat sport gloves. Dortmund were punished following the Leipzig incidents with the closure of its South Stand, which holds 24,000 spectators, for the next match."

The German Football Association (DFB) has advised third-division Lotte to find another stadium because of the poor state of the pitch at their modest 10,000-capacity ground, according to media reports. ""You have to think whether or not it could all happen again here,"" said Watzke of the saturated playing surface. ""It can all go wrong again in two weeks and at some point we will have other games to play."" Dortmund face a busy few weeks with the cup tie now coming three days before and after a German league game. Watzke said the referee took the correct decision to postpone Tuesday's game. ""It wasn't possible, the pitch had no grip. It would have been dangerous to play on it,"" he said. Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc agreed. ""You couldn't stand on the pitch, you slipped, there was the risk of injury and the risk of colliding with an opponent because you couldn't stop,"" he said. The draw for the cup semi-finals will be made on Wednesday, after holders Bayern Munich host Schalke, when ""Dortmund or Lotte"" will go into the pot.

Watzke is worried that the pitch could agin prove unplayable, presenting Dortmund with a potential fixture headache, and he wants the replay to take place on a higher-quality pitch. Third division Lotte have a modest 10,000 capacity Stadium where Tuesday's heavy snowfall left the playing surface saturated. The referee called off the match an hour before kick-off, because he could not guarantee the players' safety on the greasy surface. ""You have to think whether or not it could all happen again here,"" said Watzke. ""It can all go wrong again in two weeks. And at some point we will have other games to play."" The most likely alternative date for the game to be replayed is Tuesday March 14, three days before Dortmund have a German league game and after they host Benfica in the Champions League's last 16 next Wednesday.

399,28/02/2017,14:24,No short-term fix for Goetze - Dortmund boss,Borussia Dortmund said Tuesday they do not expect Mario Goetze to return anytime soon as Germany's World Cup winner battles with a unspecified metabolism disorder.,"""This will not be a short-term issue,"" Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke told SID, an AFP subsidiary. Dortmund announced on Monday that medical tests to see why Goetze had been suffering from repeated injury and a lack of form had revealed 'metabolic disturbances'. The exact disorder has not been revealed and the club has asked for their star to have privacy as he struggles to regain his health. ""We wish to know, in the special interest concerning Mario Goetze, that the privacy of this young person will be respected and observed,"" Dortmund's press spokesman Sascha Fligge told SID. The 24-year-old became Germany's hero when he scored in extra-time of the 2014 World Cup final to seal a 1-0 win over Argentina and Franz Beckenbauer once described him as 'Germany's (Lionel) Messi'. Last July, Dortmund paid 22 million euros ($23m) to buy Goetze back from Bayern, having been forced to sell him in 2013 for 37 million euros after the Bavarians triggered a release clause. However, poor form and injury meant he has played just six games over the 90 minutes this season, which had drawn heavy recent criticism. Ex-Germany captain Lothar Matthaeus suggested last week that Goetze should ""move to China"" if he keeps failing to win a first-team place at Dortmund, but has softened his stance since illness was revealed. ""The good thing is that one now knows the cause and can treat it,"" said Matthaeus. ""Against this background, one has to, of course, evaluate his performances differently than without this knowledge."" Goetze was outstanding in the 2011/12 season when Dortmund won the German league and cup double. His performances in the attacking midfield role then helped Dortmund reach the 2013 Champions League final, but he missed the 2-1 defeat to Bayern at Wembley with injury. He then endured three difficult years at Bayern, failing to hold down a first-team place and was often left on the bench by coach Pep Guardiola, until returning to Dortmund this season. Critics questioned whether he was mentally strong enough to cope with life at star-studded Bayern and said he had returned to Dortmund as a shadow of the player he once was. So there is some relief at Borussia that an illness has been diagnosed. ""We are glad that we now know the reasons for Mario's complaints,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc."
400,28/02/2017,01:34,Illness caps Goetze's fall from hero to zero,Mario Goetze had the nation at his feet when Germany's hero netted the winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final.,"Fast-forward nearly three years and Monday's news that the Borussia Dortmund star is sidelined indefinitely by a metabolism disorder is the latest blow to affect the attacking midfielder since the Brazil triumph. Among the Dortmund games he will miss is the Champions League round-of-16, second-leg clash at home to Benfica on March 8, having lost the first match 1-0 in Portugal. ""I am in the process of getting treatment and I will do everything I can to get back into training as quickly as possible,"" Goetze told the club website on Monday. But there has been an air of frustration around the 24-year-old for weeks. Goetze has scored just two goals in 16 appearances for Dortmund in all competitions after returning to his hometown club for this season. It has been a poor return on the 22 million euros ($23m) it cost to buy him back from Bayern, who forced Dortmund to sell him for 37 million euros in 2013 when the Bavarians triggered a release clause in his contract. Goetze failed to hold down a first-team place at star-studded Bayern in three seasons under Pep Guardiola, who preferred the silky skills of Thiago Alcantara to Goetze's industry around the edge of the box. A telephone call with Guardiola's replacement Carlo Ancelotti towards the end of last season was enough to convince Goetze his future lay in Dortmund, but his return has not been a happy one. He has featured in only 11 Bundesliga matches this season, played the full 90 minutes just four times and spent six games entirely on the bench. Goetze has not played at all this month after picking up a leg injury. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel dropped him for Dortmund's home Bundesliga win over second-placed RB Leipzig at the start of February because of poor form. There has been external criticism, most noticeably from Lothar Matthaeus, who captained Germany to the Italy 1990 title. The 55-year-old believes Goetze is running out of options and needs to adapt. ""Quite honestly, even if it sounds a little nasty, if he does not sort it out at Dortmund, he has to go to China, because he certainly won't want to make less money,"" Matthaeus told magazine Sport Bild last week. ""He can't go to (Dortmund's arch rivals) Schalke, he wouldn't fit at Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Moenchengladbach can't afford him. ""Top clubs from abroad no longer have him on their list. ""He has to change, that is clear. ""He doesn't have the speed, which is everything in football today. ""Players like Xabi Alonso can perhaps compensate for that, but not an attacking player like Goetze."" Dortmund, who are third in Germany's top flight, have given no date for his return and are protective of Goetze, who came up through the junior ranks. ""I am quite certain that some people still have to apologise to Goetze. Even if they are a big name,"" said Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke in relation to Matthaeus' comments. There is some relief around the club that there is a medical reason to explain the Germany star's loss of form. ""We are glad to know the reasons for Mario's complaints and we are convinced that after recovering he will give us extra quality with his exceptional abilities,"" said Dortmund's director of sports Michael Zorc. ""Mario gets the full backing and maximum support from all of us at Borussia Dortmund on his way back."" But Goetze is a long way from his dazzling form in 2011 and 2012 when he helped Dortmund win the German league titles at Bayern's expense. In a Dortmund midfield boasting talent like Germany's Marco Reus, teenager Ousmane Dembele and Raphael Guerreiro, who Tuchel has heaped praise on, Goetze faces an uphill battle to once again hold down a first-team place."
401,27/02/2017,17:34,Metabolism disorder sidelines Goetze indefinitely,"Borussia Dortmund will be without Mario Goetze for the forseeable future after a medical check revealed a metabolism disorder, the latest set-back for Germany's World Cup hero.","""I am in the process of getting treatment and I will do everything I can to get back into training as quickly as possible to help my team achieve our common goals,"" Goetze told the club website on Monday. The 24-year-old scored in extra-time of the 2014 World Cup final to seal a 1-0 win over Argentina. But this season he has endured a difficult return to Dortmund, struggling with form and injuries, following three unhappy years at Bayern Munich spent mainly on the bench. It cost Dortmund 22 million euros ($23m) to buy Goetze back from Bayern, having been forced to sell him in 2013 for 37 million euros when the Bavarians triggered a release clause in his contract.

402,17/02/2017,19:34,Teenage sensation Dembele loving life in Dortmund,"Everything has happened very fast for Ousmane Dembele, still just 19 but starring for Borussia Dortmund and dreaming of making the France squad for the next World Cup.","""I'm loving it, but I can do better,"" Dembele admitted to AFP of his first season in the German Bundesliga following a move from Rennes last year. He was a sensation in his homeland after breaking into the Rennes first team, and 12 goals in 26 games later he had chosen to join Dortmund where he has quickly become indispensable. Four goals and eight assists from 19 Bundesliga games make him the perfect support act for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang up front for Dortmund, who play in front of 80,000 crowds at their spectacular Signal-Iduna Park. ""I am not some phenomenon. I just try to be decisive for my teammates. Young kids with talent, there are loads of them in football,"" says a modest Dembele, who moved to Germany for 15 million euros ($15.9m, £12.8m). Dembele talks about the intensity demanded even in training sessions by Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, about the tactical demands placed on him. Tuchel ""asks us to constantly press the opposition as soon as we lose the ball. He is very close to the players, laughs a lot with us. But when things are not going well, he can get angry."" And things have not always gone swimmingly this season -- Dortmund's hoped-for title push has not materialised and they began the weekend in fourth place, 15 points behind leaders Bayern Munich. On Tuesday, meanwhile, Dembele played as Dortmund lost 1-0 to Benfica in Portugal in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. Far from his mother, brothers and sisters, who had followed him from Normandy to Rennes, Dembele does have his uncle and ""best friend"" Moustapha Diatta for support in Germany. Diatta was his neighbour growing up in Evreux and now plays for Dortmund's reserve team. But Dembele's success in settling in Germany also owes much to the advice he says he gets from his attacking mentors, Marco Reus and Aubameyang, who he calls ""a brother"". He admits to relishing playing in Tuchel's Dortmund side but adds: ""I can do better. I need to keep working hard."" Dembele, who does not turn 20 until May, says he must improve his finishing and ""stop stupidly losing the ball."" But German football magazine Kicker stuck up for the youngster last week, saying: ""One can be excused for losing the ball from time to time when one is so often capable of getting fans out of their seats."" Dembele has complained of the often bruising treatment reserved for him from defenders but the experience he has gained this year has forced him to grow up quickly. Already capped three times by France, Dembele has his sights set on a place in Didier Deschamps' squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. ""If we qualify, I will do everything to be there,"" he said."

It was one of four clear chances spurned by Aubameyang, the Bundesliga's top scorer with 17 goals. ""I missed out on some fitness work (with Dortmund) because of the Africa Cup and I have to admit, I am a bit tired,"" Aubameyang told German daily Bild. Benfica goalkeeper Ederson saved Aubameyang's 58th-minute penalty and Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel replaced the misfiring forward four minutes later. ""I am very sad and disappointed. It was a black day for me,"" added Aubameyang. ""I was bad. I can only apologise."" Aubameyang has only scored one goal in five games since returning from the Cup of Nations last month after Gabon's group-stage exit. Tuchel says he took Aubameyang off because of his body language after his penalty blunder. ""'Auba' has been physically behind since returning from the Africa Cup,"" explained Tuchel. ""After the missed penalty, I didn't get the feeling anymore from his body language that he was in a position to score. ""He is a part of the team and I can't imagine that he had a problem with my decision,"" Tuchel added. And Aubameyang admitted it was right that he was taken off. ""Of course, I had to score the goal,"" he said. ""That the coach took me off is completely in order and understandable."" Aubameyang has made no secret of his desire to one day move on from Dortmund, but club bosses last month told him to stop talking about leaving. He gave two interviews in January where he hinted at a June exit. Despite losing in Portugal, Dortmund battered the Benfica goal with 14 shots compared to the hosts' five. Aubameyang twice fired over the bar with only Ederson to beat, hit his penalty straight at the goalkeeper and also failed to convert a cross from Raphael Guerreiro from two yards out with the goal gaping. Benfica's Greek striker Kostas Mitroglou scored the only goal of the game but Tuchel remains positive about the return leg on March 8. ""We didn't just play well, we played exceptionally well,"" said Tuchel. ""We didn't pay attention for three minutes, when we went off the boil, and we conceded with their only shot on goal in the second half. ""That's football, when you play so well, yet still walk off as losers. ""But for days like that there is always the return leg. Shit happens."""

Goalkeeper Ederson saved Aubameyang's 58th-minute penalty and Tuchel replaced the mis-firing forward four minutes later. Having been on fire up to the winter break, the striker has struggled in recent weeks since Gabon's group stage exit last month at the Cup of Nations. Aubameyang, who has made no secret of his desire to one day play for Real Madrid, was last month told by Dortmund bosses to stop talking about leaving after two interviews where he hinted at a June exit.

407,14/02/2017,23:32,Benfica sneak win as Aubameyang fluffs Dortmund's lines,Benfica pulled off a classic smash and grab job as they beat Borussia Dortmund 1-0 in their Champions League last 16 first leg on Tuesday.,"Greek striker Kostas Mitroglou scored the only goal of the game, prodding home from close range at the second attempt just after half time after Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki stopped his initial effort. Benfica goalkeeper Ederson, who has relegated former Brazil first choice shot-stopper Julio Cesar to the bench this season, was the star of the show making a slew of crucial saves. But Dortmund will have many regrets after a wasteful performance, in particular from striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who had a torrid evening, missing three gilt-edged opportunities. ""It was a great team effort from us tonight,"" Benfica's Victor Lindelof said. ""A victory like this is always good for our confidence."" Dortmund had the first clear chance of the night on 10 minutes as French youngster Ousmane Dembele slipped Aubameyang in on goal, but the Gabon striker lifted his shot not only over Ederson but also the bar. Dortmund were well on top in the early stages but poor control cost Raphael Guerreiro and Erik Durm when well placed to shoot. The visitors then fashioned a chance with Guerreiro picking out Dembele 10 yards from goal but reported Manchester United target Victor Lindelof bravely threw himself in front of the shot to deflect the ball behind for a corner. Dortmund should have gone in front on 38 minutes when Benfica centre-back Ljubomir Fejsa dallied allowing Guerreiro to cross from the byline. But with Ederson stranded, Aubameyang was inches away from converting the ball into an empty net from two yards out. Moments later, Ederson was a relieved man to see Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli wave away Dortmund protests after the goalkeeper clattered into Dembele on the edge of his box. Having produced nothing in the first half, Benfica went in front three minutes into the second after Mitroglou was left unmarked two yards out to poke home Luisao's header from a Pizzi corner. Thereafter, the one-way traffic continued heading towards the home goal was relentless. Ederson saved a point-blank effort from Dembele inside the six yard box before Aubameyang lifted a carbon copy of his first half chance again just over the bar. Ederson made smart stops to deny Marco Reus and then Lukasz Piszczek before Dortmund were given a lifeline when Fejsa handled a cross from Marc Bartra. But Aubameyang's miserable night continued with a woeful penalty stroked nonchalantly down the middle that the static Ederson merely punched clear. Aubameyang was put out of his misery a few minutes later as coach Thomas Turchel replaced him with Andre Schuerrle just past the hour mark. Dortmund continued to press but Reus hooked a volley wide before Ederson showed lightening reactions to save one-handed from a Christian Pulisic volley that took a wicked deflection. ""We had some good chances but things didn't work out,"" said Schuerrle. ""We still have the second leg to come."""
408,13/02/2017,21:48,Wounded Dortmund strive for Benfica remedy,Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel hopes the return of the Champions League will provide the jolt his inconsistent side need ahead of Tuesday's visit to Benfica in the first leg of their last-16 tie.,"The Germans tormented opposing defences and finished above European champions Real Madrid in Group F after setting a new group-stage goals record, but they have failed to reproduce their best form domestically. Dortmund, who won their lone Champions League title in 1997, fell an alarming 15 points behind Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich following Saturday's shock 2-1 loss at bottom side Darmstadt. ""I want Dortmund to show their best side against Benfica,"" Tuchel told reporters in the Portuguese capital on Monday. ""Of course we didn't expect to lose against Darmstadt. After this disappointment, tomorrow (Tuesday) we'll have to regain our confidence and believe we can get a good result in Lisbon."" Dortmund fielded three teenagers at Darmstadt, with 18-year-old Dzenis Burnic making his German league debut in the absence of injured defensive duo Marcel Schmelzer and Lukasz Piszczek. However, the pair are fit to return against Benfica while Ousmane Dembele could also start after coming off the bench at the weekend. Mario Goetze is not part of the squad though after struggling for both form and fitness recently. Tuchel predicted Tuesday's clash in Lisbon would elicit a strong response from his players but brushed off any suggestions Dortmund were the favourites to progress. ""In the last 16 of the Champions League there is never a favourite,"" he said. ""We will be playing against a complete side; one that is very quick and likes to attack and has a very strong Jonas-Mitroglou pairing that works well together."" Greece striker Kostas Mitroglou scored twice as Benfica eased past Arouca 3-0 on Friday to remain one point clear of Porto at the top of the Portuguese league. Tuesday's fixture at the Estadio da Luz will be the first meeting between Benfica and Dortmund since the first round of the 1963/64 European Cup, a tie the German club won 6-2 on aggregate. Benfica, European champions in 1961 and 1962, advanced with the fewest points (eight) of any team to this season's knockout phase and are looking to reach the quarter-finals for the third time in six years. Dortmund's record-breaking 21-goal haul in the group stage was founded largely on thumping 6-0 and 8-4 wins over Poland's Legia Warsaw, while they triumphed 2-1 over Sporting in Lisbon in October. Veteran Brazilian forward Jonas, who scored 32 times in Portugal last season, could make his first appearance in Europe this season after missing the group stage with an ankle injury. The 32-year-old has netted eight goals in all competitions since his return from a four-month lay-off in mid-December, but Benfica coach Rui Vitoria admitted on Monday he was unsure whether the striker would play. ""Jonas is in the squad but he's at the limit and will have his difficulties trying to make the game. We will test him tomorrow and see where we are. If he recovers, he's in; if not, someone else plays,"" said Vitoria. Defender Luisao, who turned 36 on the eve of the match, is poised to make his 500th appearance for Benfica on Tuesday. ""I'm proud to be the coach of a player like him. A player of his age who reaches 500 matches after 14 years at the same club, that doesn't happen often in modern football. ""If we win it would a good present for him, but also for the club. If he scores a goal, that would be the cherry on top of the cake."" The second leg in Germany is scheduled for March 8."

Dortmund had until noon (1100 GMT) on Monday to accept the punishment handed out by the German Football Association (DFB) last Friday to close the stand and fine the club 100,000 euros ($106,379). ""After weighing up the arguments, Borussia Dortmund has decided to accept the DFB's penalty and the drastic punishment of closing the entire south stand for the Wolfsburg match,"" said Borussia in a statement. ""We are also currently preparing measures and sanctions against the perpetrators as a consequence of the incidents and will present the results in the coming weeks."" The heavy sanction has been handed out after hooligans threw stones and bottles at visiting RB Leipzig fans, including families with children, before a Bundesliga match on February 4. Police made 28 arrests, four officers were injured and 10 Leipzig supporters were hospitalised for treatment due to the violence before kick-off. During the game, some 60 banners bearing anti-RB Leipzig slogans, many of which were offensive, were held up by Dortmund fans in the south stand. Dortmund bosses have apologised to their RB Leipzig counterparts."
410,13/02/2017,12:05,Goetze left out of Dortmund squad for Benfica,"Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze has been left out of Borussia Dortmund's squad for Tuesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg, clash against Benfica.","The 24-year-old has fallen out of favour with coach Thomas Tuchel after a string of below-par performances and is struggling with a leg injury, which kept him out of Saturday's shock 2-1 defeat at Bundesliga bottom side Darmstadt. ""For him, the game in Lisbon came a bit too soon,"" Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc told BVB.de. Injury and loss of form mean Goetze, who scored the winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final, has played just 24 minutes of football so far in 2017. Dortmund have been boosted with the return of both captain Marcel Schmelzer and Lukasz Piszczek, who missed the Darmstadt defeat with injury. Wingers Ousmane Dembele and Marco Reus have both shaken off knocks picked up in Darmstadt. Tuesday's fixture at the Estadio da Luz will be the first meeting between Benfica and Dortmund since the first round of the 1963/64 European Cup, a tie the German club won 6-2 on aggregate. The second leg in Germany is scheduled for March 8."

Dortmund, who won their lone Champions League title in 1997, fell an alarming 15 points behind Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich following Saturday's shock 2-1 loss at bottom side Darmstadt. ""I never got the feeling we really got going,"" Tuchel said after Dortmund saw their nine-match unbeaten run snapped, albeit a series that included just three victories. ""We were simply a long way below our limit and we have to admit they (Darmstadt) deserved to win."" Dortmund fielded three teenagers at Darmstadt, with 18-year-old Dzenis Burnic making his German league debut in the absence of injured defensive duo Marcel Schmelzer and Lukasz Piszczek. But Tuchel predicted Tuesday's clash in Lisbon would elicit a strong response from his players, with Ousmane Dembele, Andre Schuerrle and Shinji Kagawa all in contention to return to the starting line-up after coming off the bench at the weekend. ""In all honesty, we come into our own when it's a 50-50 game,"" said Tuchel, his thoughts echoed by goalkeeper Roman Buerki. ""On Tuesday, we play against a different opponent with a different way of playing,"" the Swiss international added. Greece striker Kostas Mitroglou scored twice as Benfica eased past Arouca 3-0 on Friday to remain one point clear of Porto at the top of the Portuguese league. Tuesday's fixture at the Estadio da Luz will be the first meeting between Benfica and Dortmund since the first round of the 1963/64 European Cup, a tie the German club won 6-2 on aggregate.

The 32-year-old has netted eight goals in all competitions since his return from a four-month lay-off in mid-December. Mexico international Raul Jimenez made his first appearance of the new year last weekend, coming off the bench against Arouca following injury, and warned of the challenge facing the hosts. ""It is going to be difficult as any Champions League match. We have to be at our best,"" said Jimenez, while Peru international Andre Carrillo was confident Benfica's home support would provide a considerable boost to Rui Vitoria's side. The second leg in Germany is scheduled for March 8."
412,09/02/2017,18:48,Dortmund apologise to Leipzig over fans' violence,Borussia Dortmund's CEO and president met their RB Leipzig counterparts on Thursday to apologise for last weekend's violent attacks by hooligans as police say they have started prosecuting the culprits.,"Dortmund police have reportedly started criminal proceedings in 32 cases after violent attacks broke out before last Saturday's German league match when hooligans set upon Leipzig fans, including women and children. During the attacks, four police officers and 10 visiting fans were injured, but the levels of hatred aimed at RB and their fans have shocked Germany's football community. Around 60 banners, many bearing insulting slogans aimed at Leipzig, were displayed by Dortmund fans inside the stadium. Dortmund captain Marcel Schmelzer condemned the violence in a video message to fans at their stadium before Wednesday's German Cup win over Hertha Berlin. Now CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke and president Reinhard Rauball have apologised in person. ""They stressed that no sporting or emotional rivalry justified either the verbal slurs and banners personally attacking Leipzig club officials or the violence towards RB Leipzig fans,"" read a joint statement from the clubs. ""Rauball and Watzke assured RB executives that Borussia Dortmund began investigating the incidents and identifying culprits immediately after the game and have co-operated very closely with police. ""They will, of course, keep RB updated of any developments and will bring together those responsible for the safety of spectators in order to establish how the situation could have escalated as it did. ""Representatives from both clubs agree that the goal must be to find a solution which ensures the events of last Saturday are not repeated in the future."" Dortmund can expect to be heavily punished when the German Football Association complete their investigation. Borussia are already on probation after fans rioted following their German Cup final defeat to Bayern Munich on penalties last May in Berlin and were fined 75,000 euros ($80,000). RB Leipzig were founded in 2009 by energy drinks giants Red Bull and reached the Bundesliga for the first time this season, but are widely unpopular because of their perceived commercialisation of German football. Watzke had been one of RB's most outspoken critics, having said Leipzig ""play football to perform for cans of drink"". Germany's coach Joachim Loew led the voices condemning Watzke's comments, which the World Cup winner said escalated the situation in Dortmund."
413,09/02/2017,12:05,Dortmund boss slams Sokratis for 'unnecessary' red,Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel has slammed key defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos for his 'unnecessary' sending-off before their 3-2 German Cup penalty shoot-out win over Hertha Berlin.,"Greece international Sokratis was shown two yellow cards in quick succession for repeatedly complaining to referee Deniz Aytekin when a free-kick was awarded against him. He was sent off in 119th minute, seconds before the final whistle brought the match to a close at 1-1 after extra time. Dortmund went on to win the shoot out. ""A double yellow for complaining -- there are few more unnecessary yellow-red cards than that,"" fumed Tuchel. As it turned out, Salomon Kalou's miss for Hertha in the penalty shoot-out put Dortmund in the quarter-finals to spare Sokratis' blushes -- not that he would have been called up to take a spot kick. ""'Papa' wasn't on the list of penalty takers -- we had done everything so that he didn't have to take one,"" added Tuchel. The decision to leave Sokratis off the list of penalty-takers was no doubt inspired by his miss in May's German Cup final when Bayern beat Dortmund 4-3 in a penalty shoot-out after a goalless draw in Berlin. Centre-back Sokratis is now suspended for Dortmund's cup quarter-final at Sportfreunde Lotte at the end of the month. The third division giant-killers have beaten Werder Bremen, Bayer Leverkusen and 1860 Munich on the way to the last eight. Dortmund were made to work for Wednesday's third-round win over Berlin as they equalised through Germany winger Marco Reus after Kalou's volley gave Hertha an half-time lead. Four Dortmund players finished the 120 minutes with knocks, including winger Ousmane Dembele, who had to be stretchered off with what Tuchel described as 'full-body cramp'. But the French teenager came back on to finish the match and converted Borussia's first penalty in the shoot-out. ""That was commendable,"" added Tuchel."
414,08/02/2017,15:33,Dortmund barbs fuelled brutal fan attacks - Loew,"Germany coach Joachim Loew has joined the criticism of Borussia Dortmund's CEO after the club's hooligans attacked RB Leipzig fans, including women and children, before last weekend's bitter Bundesliga game.","Police made 28 arrests on Saturday after some of the 8,000 visiting RB Leipzig fans were attacked with stones and bottles outside Dortmund's stadium. Hooliganism is nothing new in German football, but the violence meted out to RB Leipzig supporters, which included young families, was a fresh low and shocked Germany. Around 400 hardcore Dortmund ""Ultras"" turned violent before the 1-0 win over Leipzig, injuring four police officers and 10 visiting fans. Dortmund police chief Edzard Freyhoff said: ""I have never seen such hate-filled expressions in any previous operations. I was shocked."" RB Leipzig were founded in 2009 by energy drinks giants Red Bull and reached the Bundesliga for the first time this season. But they are widely unpopular because of their perceived commercialisation of German football. Borussia's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke is one of RB's most outspoken critics and has said Leipzig ""play football to perform for cans of drink"". In a thinly veiled attack on Watzke, Germany's World Cup winning coach Loew said such comments escalated the situation in Dortmund. ""One can be more cautious and careful with their expressions before such a game,"" Loew said. ""I won't name names, but 'can club' and so on certainly does not bring the tension down, more the opposite."" Loew said Dortmund's hooligans must be punished. ""They must be taken out of circulation. It can't be that families can no longer come to stadiums,"" added Loew. German daily Bild has interviewed several RB Leipzig fans who were attacked in Dortmund. Uwe Eckert, 50, described how a Dortmund fan pulled his Leipzig scarf from behind, then broke his nose, while his 10-year-old grandson watched in tears. ""I reported it to police. At the hospital, they wanted to keep me in, but I just wanted to get out of Dortmund,"" Eckert added. A 21-year-old student identified only as Jessica described being spat at, then hit by flying stones and bottles. ""A member of our fan club was attacked from nowhere by a Borussia fan and had his nose broken,"" she said. Joerg Radek, the deputy chairman of Germany's Police Union (GdP), echoed Loew's sentiments. ""Obviously there were signals from the Dortmund side before the game which contributed to an atmosphere which favoured the escalation of violence,"" Radek told Dortmund newspaper Ruhr Nachrichten. Watzke says the club is working with police to identify those fans responsible and Germany's Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told Bild that the violent fans should be locked up. ""Whoever throws stones and drinks crates at police, and doesn't hold back against families and children, is in truth not a football fan and doesn't belong in a stadium, but should be locked up,"" he said. Dortmund can expect to be heavily punished by the German Football Association. They are already on probation after fans rioted following their German Cup final defeat to Bayern Munich on penalties last May in Berlin and were fined 75,000 euros ($80,000)."
415,07/02/2017,17:41,Dortmund's Tuchel plays down Goetze tension,"Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel has insisted he has no problem with Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze, who has been left out of Wednesday's German Cup tie against Hertha Berlin.","The attacking midfielder was kept on the bench for Saturday's 1-0 win over RB Leipzig and will miss the round of 16 clash at home to Hertha with a leg injury, according to Tuchel. ""There is no quarrelling, no animosity,"" said Tuchel on Tuesday, adding he is convinced the Germany star will yet ""prove his class"" this season. But Tuchel admitted Goezte's lack of form is why he has played the full 90 minutes only four times this season in the league, scoring just one Bundesliga goal. ""Others have more confidence and a better (goal) ratio, that's the reason why,"" explained Tuchel. The 24-year-old Goetze has struggled since returning at the start of the season after three years at Bayern Munich, where he also failed to hold down a first-team place under Pep Guardiola. Gonzalo Castro is set to feature in Dortmund's midfield in Goetze's absence. Tuchel also said goalkeeper Roman Buerki will play to pick up match practice after injury. Security in Dortmund will be in the spotlight after hooligans attacked visiting fans, including women and children, with stones and bottles before Saturday's 1-0 league win over RB Leipzig, which shocked Germany. Around 60 banners with anti-RB Leipzig slogans -- some highly offensive -- appeared on the south terrace at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park during the match. ""I saw the banners on the terrace, but didn't read them,"" said Tuchel. ""I know people who were standing on that terrace who are not at all violent and there shouldn't be a blanket condemnation for all."" But Tuchel condemned any violence. ""It must be possible to go to the ground with children and family. ""We distance ourselves from the violence, that goes without saying."""
416,07/02/2017,15:36,'Sick' attacks on Leipzig fans shock Germany,"An RB Leipzig fan has described how hooligans in Dortmund attacked their group, which included children, with stones and bottles and levels of hatred towards the Red Bull-backed club which have shocked German football.","Hooliganism is nothing new in German football, but Saturday's violence meted out to RB Leipzig supporters, including young families, was a brutal fresh low. Some of the terrified 8,000 RB Leipzig supporters, who saw their team lose 1-0 in front of 81,360 at Dortmund's intimidating Signal Iduna Park stadium, were attacked en route to the game. ""On the way to the Borussia stadium, the (rival) fans weren't separated,"" RB Leipzig fan Lars H. told German daily Bild. ""They threw eggs, cans, bottles and stones at us, flags and scarves were torn away. ""Our children were pushed and attacked, we had to get them to the sides. There were several people injured, some with lacerations. ""In eight years of being a fan I've never experienced anything as bad as in Dortmund."" Hatred from rival fans is something RasenBallsport Leipzig, founded by Red Bull in 2009, has had to deal with on the path to Germany's top tier. Following four promotions in seven years they are perceived as a threat to all things good about German football because of the obvious commercialism they represent. RasenBallsport -- GrassBallsport -- is a fabricated German word to get around the ban on Bundesliga clubs bearing a sponsor's name. The Bundesliga's ""50+1"" rule stops clubs being run by a single rich investor and its members must have a controlling share, except RB Leipzig has just 17 members -- who are all essentially Red Bull employees. At the start of the season, Borussia's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke was one of RB's most outspoken critics, saying Leipzig ""play football to perform for cans of drink"". The head of a severed bull was thrown into the playing area when Leipzig lost a German Cup match at Dynamo Dresden in August. And home fans in Cologne staged a sit-down protest which blocked the RB team bus and meant the kick-off for a league game was delayed in September. But Dortmund was something else. During the Bundesliga match, Leipzig players had laser lights shone into their faces from the terraces and there were around 60 banners in the stadium with anti-Red Bull slogans. One of the most offensive read: ""Burn-out, Ralle: go hang yourself"", referring to Ralf Rangnick, RB's director of sport who resigned from Schalke in 2011 with exhaustion. ""That's sick,"" said Borussia Moenchengladbach's director Max Eberl. ""What happened there (in Dortmund) and what we have all seen, is a disaster for football."" Eberl's Gladbach host RB in 10 days and he says ""the framework of good decency must be maintained"" so that visiting fans can watch the game without fear. In a video message, Dortmund boss Watzke said the club will do ""everything in our power"" to catch the culprits and two fans responsible for the banners have been identified, reported Bild. Police chiefs have criticised Dortmund for allowing the banners into the stadium. And Watzke's sharp ""performing cans"" comment last year could have fuelled the violence from Dortmund's ""Ultras"" (hooligans), according to a fan expert. ""The neuralgic at this point is whether one, as head of a club, the team, the trainer or the CEO, still pours oil on the fire, knowing that their own fan culture can't deal with it,"" Professor Harald Lange told Cologne-based newspaper Koelner Stadtanzeiger. According to Munich-based newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Dortmund's hooligans were prevented by police from attacking the Leipzig team bus and then aimed their frustrated aggression at visiting fans. Dortmund can expect to be heavily punished by the German Football Association (DFB). The club's senior figures are hoping there will be no further violence for Wednesday's German Cup third-round game at home to Hertha Berlin. Dortmund are already on probation having been fined 75,000 euros ($80,000) after their fans rioted following May's German Cup final when Dortmund lost on penalties to Bayern Munich."

He will bring a wealth of Champions League experience to Dortmund, who are third in the Bundesliga after Saturday's 1-0 over second-placed RB Leipzig. ""Toprak is a strong defender with international experience and great leadership qualities,"" Dortmund's sporting director Michael Zorc said. Toprak has made 181 appearances in Germany's top flight, for both Leverkusen and ex-club Freiburg, scoring five goals."

""To put it plainly, anyone who expresses his opinion not by arguments, but by raw violence and clumsy insults, can not -- and will not -- be allowed to be part of this club."" Dortmund can also expect to face tough sanctions with the German Football Association (DFB) set to investigate the violence. A crowd of 81,360 saw Dortmund's 1-0 home win over second-placed RB Leipzig on Saturday, but there were ugly scenes outside Borussia's Signal Iduna Park stadium before kick-off when some of the 8,500 visiting fans were targeted. ""In the build-up to the match, in the Strobelallee area (outside the ground), RB Leipzig supporters were bombarded with stones and cans from Borussia Dortmund fans,"" police said in a statement. RB Leipzig were unable to tell SID, an AFP subsidiary, how many of their fans were hurt, but German daily Bild claimed at least 10 visiting supporters were hospitalised. After a group of around 500 hardcore 'Ultra' Dortmund fans went on the rampage, police weighed in with pepper spray and batons. Arrests were made for offences including assault, grievous bodily harm, breach of the peace, insulting behaviour and resisting arrest. ""All in all, there was extreme aggressiveness and violence from Dortmund supporters, which was directed against any person recognised as a Leipzig fan, regardless of whether they were small children, women or families,"" added Dortmund police. ""In connection with this, four officers and a police dog were injured."" Leizpig, who are in their first season in Germany's top flight, slammed the attacks as ""unacceptable"". ""The attacks of Dortmund fans against opposing spectators and the police, plus insults and offences against women and children, are not acceptable and are embarrassing for the whole of football in Germany,"" said RB Leipzig in a statement. ""The fact that people were confronted with violence at a football match is unacceptable. ""We expect from Mr Watzke and Mr Rauball that these scenes, which were committed by several perpetrators, will be fully explained in the interests of the entire Bundesliga. ""We are glad that, according to our information, the injured RB Leipzig fans were able to return home."" RB Leipzig, who are backed by energy drinks giant Red Bull, are unpopular amongst German fans for the commercialism the club is perceived to represent, but Dortmund fans were particularly unwelcoming. There were several offensive banners in the Dortmund stadium aimed at RB, including ""Burnout Ralph, go hang yourself!"" after Leipzig's sports director Ralf Rangnick resigned from Schalke in 2011 with burnout."
419,04/02/2017,20:38,Aubameyang strike helps Bayern extend lead,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted his 17th Bundesliga goal of the season Saturday as Borussia Dortmund's 1-0 win over flu-hit RB Leipzig left Bayern Munich four points clear at the top.,"Aubameyang remains two goals ahead of Bayern hot-shot Robert Lewandowski in the race to be the German league's top scorer thanks to his superb first-half winner. The Gabon striker headed home after teenage French winger Ousmane Dembele ghosted past two RB defenders down the right wing and crossed for Aubameyang to head home unmarked on 35 minutes. Leipzig made Dortmund work for the win as Germany winger Marco Reus squandered two of Dortmund's four clear second-half chances. ""We won the game, that's what counts,"" a relieved Reus told Sky. ""We put up a good fight, it was a very aggressive game and the win is okay."" There was drama in added time as Leipzig sub Federico Palacios Martinez, making his Bundesliga debut, put the ball in Dortmund's net, but was flagged for a marginal offside. Leipzig struggled without top-scorer Timo Werner, midfielder Diego Demme and striker Marcel Sabitzer, who all have flu, while playmaker Emil Forsberg was suspended. The result lifted Dortmund from seventh to third, eight points behind Leipzig, who are four adrift of Bayern after Carlo Ancelotti's Bavarians had earlier drawn 1-1 with Schalke in Munich. Lewandowski's deft chip gave Bayern an early lead at the Allianz Arena before Schalke defender Naldo drilled home a free-kick on 13 minutes to level. Captain Philipp Lahm made his 500th appearance for Bayern, who had to work for their point. ""It was a tough game because Schalke played well,"" said Ancelotti. ""We started well, but were not so compact and our lines between the midfield and defence were too far apart from one another. ""We could only increase the pressure slightly at the end, but it was not enough."" Bayern made a bright start by taking the lead after nine minutes. Arturo Vidal threaded a pass to Lewandowski and the Poland striker lifted his shot over Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann. But Schalke kept their composure and equalised four minutes later when Naldo hammered a free-kick past Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. It completed the scoring, but both sides squandered clear first-half chances as Schalke striker Guido Burgstaller hit the crossbar, just like Lewandowski did at the other end. This was a tight, bruising encounter as Schalke fought hard for the point which left them 11th. ""Our plan would have worked out 100 percent if we'd won, but we can be very happy and can live with the point,"" said a delighted Schalke coach, Markus Weinzierl. Hoffenheim, the last team in a top European league to lose their unbeaten record last weekend, are fourth after their 4-0 hammering of Mainz at home. Midfield playmaker Sebastian Rudy's long pass was chested down by striker Mark Uth, who drilled home his shot with five minutes gone to put Hoffenheim 1-0 up. Midfielder Marco Terrazzino headed their second nine minutes from time with replacement striker Adam Szalai then scoring two goals off the bench against his old club. Hertha moved up to fifth with a 1-0 win at home to strugglers Ingolstadt as Japan midfielder Genki Haraguchi scored the winner after just a minute at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Cologne are sixth following their 1-0 win at Wolfsburg thanks to Anthony Modeste's second-half penalty, having been fouled by Wolves goalkeeper Diego Benaglio in the area. Borussia Moenchengladbach picked up their second straight win with a 3-0 victory at home to Freiburg courtesy of goals from captain Lars Stindl, striker Raffael and winger Patrick Herrmann to go tenth."

Tuchel's opposite number Ralph Hasenhuettl will be on the Leipzig bench despite missing Wednesday training with a fever. Tensions will be high at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park when fourth-placed Borussia host Leipzig, who are having a stellar first season in Germany's top flight, sitting second behind Bayern Munich. Leipzig chairman Oliver Mintzlaff upped the ante in the build-up saying he is ""not sad"" Tuchel turned them down in 2015. Adding more spice, Dortmund's hardcore ""Ultra"" supporters are planning protests during the match against the perceived commercialism RB Leipzig represent -- the club is backed by energy drinks giant Red Bull. Tuchel is under a spotlight following RB's shock 1-0 win over Dortmund last September in Leipzig and with his side stuttering as of late. ""It's already a game which has a certain burden of pressure,"" said Tuchel, believing that expectations are markedly higher at Dortmund. ""We have set ourselves the goal of reaching the Champions League (a top-four place), which is a distraction Leipzig don't have and which makes them completely free. ""They can take everything as a bonus."" Tuchel added: ""They are completely free to ride the wave and always be underdogs, which creates a mood that can carry you."" When Tuchel took over as Dortmund coach in the 2015/16 season he was hailed as one of Germany's rising star coaches -- a homegrown answer to Pep Guardiola. But Dortmund's defence has been found wanting this season, especially in drawing four of their last five league games and are 11 points behind Leipzig. Tuchel admits he has been annoyed by comments from star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. At the start of the week, Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc told the Gabon captain to watch his words in interviews after repeatedly saying he may quit to take his career ""to the next level"". ""Such statements like that don't help, of course,"" said Tuchel. ""You can certainly argue whether one has to do it publicly during the phase in which we now find ourselves.

""Timo is already feeling better, but it makes no sense (to play him) for the weekend,"" said Hasenhuettl. ""We can't replace him like for like, but one thing we have done really well this season is to find solutions, not complain, when things don't go our way."" With Werner out, Germany under-21 striker Davie Selke or captain Dominik Kaiser are set to step into his place. Hasenhuettl, 49, was also laid up in bed at the start of the week with the flu virus, but will be fit to take his place on the bench in Dortmund. ""The strong fever has finally gone, but I'll keep my distance from the boys -- the danger of passing it on stops at two metres,"" he said. Scottish winger Oliver Burke is back in training after also suffering from the virus, but Leipzig will again be without Sweden playmaker Emil Forsberg, who will miss the last game of his three-match ban."
422,02/02/2017,15:20,Aubameyang told to cut out Dortmund exit talk,Borussia Dortmund have ordered star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to button it after repeatedly saying that he may leave at the end of the season.,"""We spoke briefly and I advised him to give less interviews about the summer and to concentrate on the hunt for a Champions League place,"" Dortmund director of sport Michael Zorc told local newspaper WAZ. ""He understood."" Aubameyang, the Bundesliga's top scorer this season with 16 goals in 16 games, angered Zorc after giving two interviews recently when he openly admitted that he is considering leaving in June. The Gabon striker has a Dortmund contract until 2020, but has made it clear he wants to eventually play for Real Madrid to keep a promise he made to his grandfather just before he died. Late last month, the 27-year-old told sports daily Fussball Bild that he may leave Dortmund in June, but insisted he would never join German rivals Bayern Munich. Then this week he told French radio station RMC that he is pondering a transfer ""to reach the next level"" in his career. Despite stern words with Aubameyang, Zorc made it clear the club's relationship with their star striker has not been affected. ""We have a very, very good relationship, but we had to set a marker, inside and out, that the focus now has to be on the sport,"" said Zorc. Dortmund, who are fourth in the table, host second-placed RB Leipzig on Saturday in a key Bundesliga clash having lost 1-0 at the Bundesliga new boys in September. Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl was dismissive when asked if Aubameyang's talk of leaving would unsettle Dortmund. ""It would only be an advantage if he didn't play,"" said Hasenhuettl drily. ""I don't know many clubs who are more powerful than Borussia Dortmund, so I don't know what the next step (for Aubameyang) should be, but everyone has to decide for himself."" Dortmund are home to Bundesliga rivals Hertha Berlin next Wednesday in the third round of the German Cup and play Benfica away in the Champions League on February 14."

The club confirmed both Werner and Hasenhuettl missed training on Wednesday. ""Timo has had a great run. It would be a huge pity if he can't help us in Dortmund,"" Leipzig defender Willi Orban told Bild.

Hasenhuettl is expected to be on the Leipzig bench in Dortmund, but magazine Kicker say Leipzig's medical staff are 'very sceptical' Werner will be fit enough to travel to Dortmund."

425,01/02/2017,12:31,Aubameyang again hints at Dortmund exit,Star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has again talked about leaving Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season -- with the Spanish league his most likely destination.,"Last month Aubameyang, the Bundesliga's top scorer this season with 16 goals in 16 games, told sports daily Fussball Bild he could leave Dortmund in June, but insisted he would never join German rivals Bayern Munich. The Gabon hot-shot has repeatedly said he wants to eventually join Real Madrid to fulfil a promise he made to his grandfather shortly before he died. Aubameyang has a Dortmund contract until 2020, but the 27-year-old is pondering joining a new club in June ""to reach the next level"". ""A transfer? That is the question I am asking myself at the moment and I have no answer,"" Aubameyang told French radio station RMC. ""I am thinking intensively about a transfer in the coming summer. But I always ask myself the question: if I want to reach the next level, do I have to go? Is it worth it or not? ""Everyone tells me about England, but that is not the league which excites me the most. I prefer the Spanish league. ""Real Madrid has been a big deal lately, but there is not only Real there."" Having been born in Laval, France, and joined Dortmund from Saint-Etienne, Aubameyang said returning to the French league would not be his ""first option"" and is also ""unimaginable"". Dortmund boss Hans-Joachim Watzke told magazine Sport Bild that they expect to eventually lose Aubameyang. ""It would be best if he would play here for a few more years,"" said Watzke. ""There is no evidence that he is planning a farewell."" Meanwhile, Premier League side Arsenal are reportedly willing to pay 60 million euros ($65m) for Dortmund's Germany winger Marco Reus, according to Bild. The 27-year-old has a Dortmund contract until 2019, but a move to London could see him earn up to 13 million euros, while he currently pockets nine million, claims the German daily."
426,29/01/2017,20:02,Shaky Dortmund leak late equaliser,Borussia Dortmund conceded a late goal in Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's low-key Bundesliga return on Sunday in a 1-1 draw at Mainz which cost them third place in the table.,"Aubameyang, the German league's top scorer with 16 goals, was back in Dortmund's starting line-up following Gabon's group-stage exit from the Africa Cup of Nations, but he had just two shots on goal in Mainz. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel had lamented their shaky defence after last Saturday's scrappy 2-1 win at Werder Bremen and they again looked unstable at the back. This was Dortmund's fourth draw in their last five league games. ""If you don't want to defend consistently, then something like that can happen,"" said Dortmund's frustrated captain Marcel Schmelzer. ""We thought we were a step further on, so it is bitter to have let a win slip out of our hands."" Last season's runners up are now fourth -- fourteen points adrift of leaders Bayern Munich, who won 2-1 at Werder Bremen on Saturday thanks to goals by Arjen Robben and David Alaba. Borussia took the lead with just three minutes gone in Mainz. Midfielder Jean-Philippe Gbamin lost possession, which Dortmund's Germany winger Andre Schuerrle snapped up to provide the final pass for Marco Reus to rifle home. Mainz's Japan striker Yoshinori Muto had the ball in the net on 15 minutes, but the goal was ruled offside. The hosts snatched a point seven minutes from time when midfielder Danny Latza was left unmarked to head home a cross at the far post as Mainz pushed for the winner in the frantic final stages. Earlier, midfielder Janik Haberer and ex-Bayern Munich striker Nils Petersen netted for Freiburg in Sunday's shock 2-1 win over Bundesliga high-fliers Hertha Berlin. ""It's unpleasant to play against us,"" said Petersen. ""We defended well and we have the quality up front to use our few chances. ""We're all pulling in the right direction -- big compliment to the team."" Having pushed league leaders Bayern all the way in last weekend's 2-1 home defeat at the Schwarzwald Stadion, hosts Freiburg earned a deserved win on Sunday to climb to eighth in Germany's top flight. Haberer, who had given Freiburg a shock lead against Bayern before Robert Lewandowski netted twice, put the hosts ahead against Hertha when he drilled home Vincenzo Grifo's pass across goal on 39 minutes. Freiburg sealed the win when super sub Petersen netted his sixth goal of the season, all of which have come as a replacement, on 87 minutes when he finished off a move started by his own goalkeeper and beat three defenders. Less than a minute later, Hertha pulled a goal back when ex-Dortmund striker Julian Schieber rifled home. The defeat, Hertha's sixth of the season, leaves Pal Dardai's Berlin sixth in the table. ""We played okay for an away game, but we had no clear chances, just mistakes in their defence,"" said Dardai, whose team has now suffered two straight defeats after their 3-1 loss at Leverkusen. ""We have to improve that."" On Saturday, second-placed RB Leipzig ended 10-man Hoffenheim's unbeaten run this season with a 2-1 comeback win to stay just three points adrift of Carlo Ancelotti's star-studded Bavarians. Hoffenheim were the last undefeated team left in Europe's top leagues before Marcel Sabitzer's 77th-minute winner dealt the visitors their first loss of the campaign after striker Sandro Wagner's dismissal. Meanwhile, Werder confirmed Sunday that a fan died of natural causes in their Weser Stadion ground immediately after Saturday's defeat to Bayern Munich. The man, from East Frisia in north-east Germany, had received emergency treatment for upper body pains and nausea shortly before the final whistle. After an investigation by police, death by natural causes was confirmed. ""The news has very much affected us all,"" said Werder's president Hubertus Hess-Grunewald."

He which lifted the 2012 German Cup after Dortmund's 5-2 win over Bayern Munich in the final, but then lost the 2013 Champions League final against the Bavarians. But Subotic has fallen out of favour with Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, who took over for 2015/16, and having been blighted by injury, his loan deal lasts until June. ""I have a smile on my face and I am really looking forward to the new challenge at a new club,"" said the Serbia international before training with Cologne. ""I am very grateful for the fantastic years at Borussia Dortmund. ""As an ambitious professional, my focus from today on is 100 percent on FC Cologne. ""I want to play in the Bundesliga again and that's what drives me on."" A rib injury, which needed an operation, scuppered Subotic's plans to join Middlesborough before the start of the season at the last minute. He then suffered a knee injury, which restricted him to just two reserve team games for Dortmund this season. Dortmund are currently fourth in the Bundesliga table, Cologne are seventh, and the clubs will meet in Dortmund in June in the league. Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc says Subotic has only been sent on loan ""to get a high level of match practice"" while Borussia's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke says they will welcome him back. ""Neven's degree of identification with Borussia Dortmund is really exceptional in professional football today,"" said Watzke.

""Moreover, it is a very valuable offer for a player who turned 31 years last Sunday.""

The German Football Association (DFB) took a dim view of the foul and their disciplinary court has added two more matches to the automatic one-match ban for a red card. Werder, who are fifteenth and battling relegation, will not appeal the punishment. Drobny will sit out Saturday's visit of league leaders Bayern Munich, next weekend's away match at Augsburg and the home game against Borussia Moenchengladbach on February 11.

Having watched Isak train on Wednesday for the first time with the Dortmund squad, Tuchel was full of praise for the teenager, who has a contract until June 2019. ""It's a perfect transfer which gives the club incredible long-term planning security, which makes 100 percent sense for Borussia Dortmund,"" said Tuchel. Isak has been signed as a back-up for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the Bundesliga's top scorer, who has hinted he may leave at the end of the season. But according to magazine Sport Bild, the first Tuchel knew of Isak's signing was on Saturday, shortly before Swedish daily Aftonbladet reported the deal was about to happen. ""Everything was decided very quickly. The information flow was very rapid,"" Tuchel told reporters after training on Wednesday. ""It is very normal with potential transfers of this nature that the coach only has a role late on."" Tuchel said he had no idea about the prodigy when he first heard the name. ""I did not know the player, but it's not possible that I should know of all 16 and 17-year-olds, because it was a potential transfer, in that regard the scouting department and sports director Michael Zorc do a lot of work, of course."" Tuchel says he was also only involved 'late on' in the signings of forwards Ousmane Dembele and Emre Mor before the start of the season. Dortmund has also bolstered their credentials for unearthing young stars by extending the contract of American 18-year-old Christian Pulisic, considered another football wonderkid, until 2020. Earlier this month, Isak became Sweden's youngest international goalscorer at 17 years and 113 days and had been linked to Real, but joined the Bundesliga club after an apparent change of heart. The striker scored 10 goals in his debut season at AIK in 2016. His talent was acknowledged last September when AIK team-mate Chinedu Obasi said: ""He can become the new Zlatan Ibrahimovic"" after Isak scored twice in a 3-0 derby win against Djurgardens."

Meanwhile French winger Ousmane Dembele (hip) and Greece defender Sokratis (ankle) are still doubtful after picking up strains at Dortmund's training camp in Spain. Now Turkey midfielder Mor and Rode are also out with knocks. Germany forward and former Chelsea man Andre Schuerrle, who struggled with injury and a lack of form in the first half of the season, is set to replace Aubameyang at strugglers Bremen. ""We must control their counter-attack,"" said Tuchel with Bremen's Germany winger Serge Gnabry always dangerous on the break.

Sixth-placed Dortmund drew all of their last three league games of 2016 and are 12 points behind German league leaders Bayern Munich while Bremen are just above the relegation places. Borussia's bosses are unhappy with Bender's injury, the result of a rough tackle by a Paderborn player, which Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc described as 'brutal'.

Tuchel has yet to have his full squad fit this season and regularly had to contend with a lengthy injury list in the first half of the season. As it was, Mario Goetze, Reus (both with back injuries), Sven Bender (foot), Nuri Sahin (fitness) and Sebastian Rode (ankle) were ruled out of the Liege win. ""I'm often left biting the edge of the table. Our desire was to have all our players here, but the reality was we had four youth team players on the pitch,"" Tuchel fumed after beating Liege. The Dortmund boss says injuries have meant his plans are being ""constantly thrown back"". Dembele, 19, picked up a hip injury on Tuesday and faces a race against time to face Bremen, as does Greece defender Sokratis, who picked up an ankle injury against Liege. ""It would be presumptuous to say 'it's all going to be fine'. It's often the same players who have problems to train intensively at a high level, which is definitely a problem,"" added Tuchel. Reus is a good example. The Germany winger, who only returned from a groin injury in November's 8-4 thrashing of Legia Warsaw, had been ""fit and stable like never before"" then suddenly complained of back pains ""out of nowhere"", said Tuchel. Reus had been a possible replacement for Schmelzer as Dortmund's captain, but the latest knock ruled him out of being handed the skipper's armband. ""Marcel Schmelzer is, and remains, our captain, I spoke to them both (Reus and Schmelzer) and we were of the unanimous opinion that 'Schmelle' is a top captain and will continue to be,"" said Tuchel."
439,12/01/2017,14:16,Tuchel puts pressure on Dortmund's Germany stars,Thomas Tuchel has set the bar high for Borussia Dortmund in 2017 and put pressure on the club's Germany stars Mario Goetze and Andre Schuerrle.,"Three straight draws in their final league games of 2016 left Dortmund sixth in the table, 11 points behind leaders Bayern Munich, but three from third place, with the Bundesliga to resume on January 20. Now Tuchel has set the goal of reaching the German Cup final in Berlin (on May 27), the Champions League final in Cardiff (June 3) and a third-placed finish in Germany's top flight for the rest of 2016/17. ""Berlin, Cardiff and third place -- then I wouldn't stop smiling,"" Tuchel told Sky Sports at Dortmund's training camp in Marbella. Dortmund's head coach pointed the finger directly at under-performing stars Schuerrle and Goetze, who cost Dortmund a total of 52 million euros ($55.4m) at the start of the season from Wolfsburg and Bayern respectively. It was Schuerrle's cross which Goetze converted for Germany's winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final, but the pair have so far underperformed at Dortmund. ""They must continue to work as hard as they have done so far and I am convinced the reins will come off, which has to happen for them to reach the next level,"" added Tuchel. ""Both are very ambitious and focused, they are aware there is still room for improvement."" Goetze, either a winger or attacking midfielder, has scored only two goals in his fifteen games since returning after three years at Bayern. Injury has restricted Schuerrle, normally a winger, to two full appearances in 12 games in all competitions, providing two goals and three assists. He looked impressive in the striker role and scored in Dortmund's 4-1 win over PSV Eindhoven in a friendly last weekend in Gibraltar. With Dortmund's star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang on Cup of Nations duty with Gabon, Schuerrle is a candidate up front for Dortmund's first Bundesliga game of the year at Werder Bremen on January 21. Dortmund, who finished ahead of holders Real Madrid in their group, face Benfica in the last 16 of the Champions League with the away leg on February 14 and the return on March 8."

The 27-year-old was shown a second yellow card by referee Benjamin Brand on 41 minutes after a clash with Nadiem Amiri. But Tuchel insisted that Reus ""didn't do anything"". ""It's absurd, I don't understand it,"" fumed Tuchel of Reus's subsequent one-match ban. ""It's as if you were in the department store and the store detective said you stole something. ""The video footage shows you didn't take anything, but then you're chucked into the clink anyway for a week!"" There was some good news for Tuchel with French winger Ousmane Dembele fit to face Augsburg despite having been stretchered off against Hoffenheim with what turned out to be a bruised thigh. ""It looks like he can play tomorrow,"" said Tuchel. Gonzalo Castro and Erik Durm should return after knocks, but Portugal midfielder Raphael Guerreiro is still out with a thigh injury. ""He is not able to play, it's not possible for him to train with the team, we hope that it will be possible at the start of training on January 3,"" said Tuchel."
441,17/12/2016,14:39,Dortmund boss slams ref after draw at Hoffenheim,Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has slammed the referee who sent off their Germany international winger Marco Reus in the 2-2 draw at Hoffenheim.,"Hoffenheim remain the only unbeaten team in Germany's top flight this season after Friday night's stalemate. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang earned a point for the visitors just after the break with his 16th league goal of the season. But Dortmund played the entire second half with 10 men after Reus's dismissal and Watzke was furious with the performance of referee Benjamin Brand. The official missed Sandro Wagner's push on Sven Bender to make it 2-1 to the hosts on 20 minutes at a sold-out Rhein Neckar Arena, before Aubameyang struck the leveller. And Brand missed a pull by Nadiem Amiri on Reus, who then earned a second yellow -- and subsequent red -- on 41 minutes having already been booked early on. ""I'm happy (with the result), but still annoyed by these unbelievable incorrect decisions in the first half, that is clear,"" Watzke told Sky. ""Everyone saw the push (from Wagner) and the referee was five metres away. That's crazy! It's incomprehensible."" There was however some good news for Dortmund, who had Ousmane Dembele stretchered off, but the French winger only has a bruised thigh. ""It was a hard game and to get a draw with 10 men was more than deserved,"" said Dortmund captain Marcel Schmelzer. Hoffenheim had their chance to win the game when Wagner fired against the post in the second half. The draw left Hoffenheim third and Dortmund fifth before the weekend's other matches. Dortmund earned a point despite injuries to first-choice goalkeeper Roman Burki, defenders Sokratis, Lukasz Piszczek and Erik Durm, plus midfielders Raphael Guerreiro, Gonzalo Castro, Sebastian Rode and Nuri Sahin."
442,14/12/2016,17:03,Germany 'keeper hit with speeding ban,Borussia Dortmund's Germany goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller has been banned from driving for three months after being caught speeding at 171 kilometres (106 miles) per hour.,"A district court in Siegen, near Cologne, confirmed the 36-year-old, who has made five appearances for Germany and was part of the 2014 World Cup squad, was banned after being caught speeding in a 100km/h zone in August. After being caught by a speed camera, Weidenfeller initially contested the ban, which would have meant a court appearance, but opted to accept the decision and has also been fined 600 euros ($639). Having lost his place in goal for Dortmund at the start of the season, Weidenfeller was reinstated by Borussia coach Thomas Tuchel last month after first-choice Roman Burki suffered a hand injury."
443,14/12/2016,16:30,Hoffenheim's Nagelsmann out to down ex-mentor Tuchel,"Julian Nagelsmann wants to get one over his ex-mentor Thomas Tuchel, who helped start his coaching career, when Hoffenheim host Borussia Dortmund in a key Bundesliga clash on Friday.","Alongside Real Madrid, Hoffenheim are the only other club still unbeaten in Europe's main leagues and are fourth in Germany's top flight, but just a point ahead of six-placed Dortmund. There's plenty at stake at Sinsheim's Rhein Neckar Arena where a win will lift either team to third behind leaders Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig, who both have 33 points. At 29, Nagelsmann is the youngest coach in the Bundesliga's history. He took charge in February, helping Hoffenheim avoid relegation by finishing 15th last season, but this campaign they are the only team yet to taste defeat in their first 14 German league games. They even took a shock lead at Bayern last month before earning a 1-1 draw at the Allianz Arena. A knee injury cut short his career at the age of 20, but Nagelsmann learnt the coaching trade under Tuchel, who mentored him while working with Augsburg's youth teams, and he hopes to get one over his former mentor. ""His work is, of course, exceptionally good,"" said Nagelsmann. ""But I pay next to no attention to what he does, because I don't know his work in detail and we also have a few good ideas. ""There's never been a game where beforehand I've thought that I'd settle for a draw. ""That's the same this time around. ""Of course, it's great that we're still unbeaten, but the desire to stay unbeaten is always there, because we always want to win."" Tuchel's Dortmund have been erratic of late. They lost 2-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt in late November, before hammering Borussia Moenchengladbach 4-1 and drawing 2-2 at Real Madrid, but then needed a 90th-minute Marco Reus goal to draw 1-1 at Cologne last Saturday. Raphael Guerreiro, Mario Goetze and Shinji Kagawa are all set to return for Dortmund after knocks. Portugal international Guerreiro has been absent with a leg injury since the 5-2 win against Hamburg on November 5. Nagelsmann is waiting on the fitness of Kerem Demirbay, Kevin Vogt and Germany international Sebastian Rudy. Tuchel's Dortmund is buoyed by Reus, who has been superb since his return from injury three weeks ago, with four goals and six assists in his five games back, alongside Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the league's top scorer. ""It should be a really good game, Dortmund will try to dictate the pace,"" said Nagelsmann. ""Their attack is really quick - that's one of Dortmund's strengths - and we'll need to keep it in check."""
444,07/12/2016,23:12,Dortmund claim record for group stages goals,Borussia Dortmund set a new record of 21 goals in the group stages of the Champions League in Wednesday's 2-2 draw at Real Madrid.,"Karim Benzema's double put Madrid 2-0 up before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Marco Reus netted for Dortmund. The point was enough to see the Germans finish top of the group ahead of Real. Their double in Madrid means Dortmund better the 20 goals Manchester United (1998/99), Barcelona (2011/12) and Real Madrid (2013/14) had previously scored in the group stages. Dortmund also helped set the record for the highest amount of goals in a single Champions League game when they routed Legia Warsaw 8-4 two weeks ago. Aubameyang is Dortmund's top scorer in Europe this season with four goals. Having scored their magic 21st two minutes from time, Reus credited his goal to Aubameyang, who put in a superb cross for the Germany winger to sprint onto. ""'Auba' was world-class with his pass and I was happy to get on the end of it -- the goal was 99 percent him and one from me,"" said Reus."

446,07/12/2016,22:53,"Dortmund strike late, beat Madrid to top spot",Marco Reus's dramatic equaliser two minutes from time ensured Borussia Dortmund beat holders Real Madrid to top spot in Champions League Group F with a pulsating 2-2 draw on Wednesday.,"With both sides already qualified, a double from Karim Benzema looked to have Real well set to leapfrog Dortmund and secure a home tie in the second leg of their last-16 tie. However, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang reduced the arrears before substitute Reus slid in to turn Aubameyang's dangerous low cross high into the net. A point does at least ensure Madrid match a club record 34 games unbeaten in all competitions, while Los Blancos are now also ensured of avoiding the likes of Bayern Munich, Manchester City or Paris Saint-Germain in Monday's draw. Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane kept his promise to go for victory despite the possibility of an easier draw by remaining in second with Casemiro and James Rodriguez coming into the side in only two changes from Saturday's Clasico. However, Dortmund were well worthy of a point having created a huge number of chances in an end-to-end encounter. Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller was busy early on as he parried a Benzema drive before denying Rodriguez twice in quick succession. Benzema wasn't to be denied on 28 minutes when he bundled home Dani Carvajal's low cross at the back post. Real only went in ahead at the break, though, thanks to a mixture of good goalkeeping from Keylor Navas and wayward finishing from the visitors. American wonder kid Christian Pulisic wasted a great chance when his weak effort was placed too close to Navas before the Costa Rica international produced a brilliant stop to turn Andre Schuerrle's free-kick behind. Another dangerous break moments later saw Gonzalo Castro burst through on goal, but he tried to square for Aubameyang and overhit his pass. Dortmund were even more profligate at the start of the second period as Ousmane Dembele and Castro fluffed their lines from point-blank range. Benzema should have got his second of the night when Weidenfeller produced a brilliant save to parry the Frenchman's volley. However, Benzema only had seconds to stew on that miss as moments later he bulleted home a header from Rodriguez's inch-perfect cross. Just when Madrid looked in control, Dortmund finally took one of their chances when captain Marcel Schmelzer's run wasn't tracked and his low cross was gratefully tapped home by Aubameyang for his 19th goal in as many games this season. Cristiano Ronaldo's week had been dominated by unwanted headlines off the field surrounding allegations he stored millions of euros from image rights in tax havens. And there wasn't much for the Portuguese to shout about as he was held scoreless for a fourth straight Champions League game by more Weidenfeller heroics to turn a rising drive headed for the top corner behind. Ronaldo then seemed in disbelief as he struck the base of the post with just Weidenfeller to beat. And that miss proved costly as Aubameyang stormed past Sergio Ramos and produced the perfect cross for Reus to slide home the equaliser."
447,06/12/2016,14:49,"""Lucky"" Zidane determined to win group",Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane insists the European champions aren't prepared to settle for second place behind Borussia Dortmund in Champions League Group F despite the potential for an easier last 16 tie.,"Madrid need to beat the German giants at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday to secure top spot and the second leg of their last 16 clash at home. However, given Real can't face Barcelona or Atletico Madrid even if they do finish second, as clubs from the same country are kept apart, winning the group could prove more dangerous with Bayern Munich or Pep Guardiola's Manchester City potential opponents. ""We're only thinking about winning. We're not going to look at or think about other things,"" said the Frenchman, who led Madrid to their 11th European Cup in his first season in charge in May. ""We want to finish top of the group."" Real extended an unbeaten run stretching back to April to 33 games thanks to Sergio Ramos's stoppage time equaliser at Barcelona in El Clasico on Saturday to maintain a six-point lead over Barca at the top of La Liga. Indeed, Real remain on course for five trophies this season having already pocketed the European Super Cup and with the Club World Cup to come in Japan later this month. ""You have to highlight the side's work rate,"" added Zidane. ""Each player is very professional, they all work very hard, they are experienced but still hungry. They've won a lot but they still want to win more and more."" However, despite the stellar start to his coaching career in line with his feats as one of the greatest players of his generation, Zidane remains humble enough to admit luck has been on his side during a rollercoaster ride in 2016. ""It's true I'm lucky. I do what I love everyday. I have the luck to be at this great club,"" he added. ""But it is not just luck, it is the hard work and passion for what I do that helps. I love football."" Madrid received a double injury boost as Alvaro Morata and Toni Kroos returned to training on Tuesday leaving just Gareth Bale as Zidane's only absentee. By contrast, Dortmund suffered a double blow as Mario Goetze didn't travel to the Spanish capital, whilst Marco Reus is doubtful due to a cold. Reus missed the 2-2 draw with Madrid back in September, but has been a consistent thorn in Real's side in six previous meetings since 2012. Dortmund's top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will also be out to impress. The African Player of the Year has never hidden his desire to one day sign for Real and fulfil a promise he made to his Spanish grandfather before he passed away two years ago. ""In any moment he can make the difference,"" said Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel. ""I believe it is normal he wants to play for Real Madrid at some point. I think all the best players want to play with the best teams in the world and Real Madrid are without doubt one of the best. ""Tomorrow there is always pressure to play in the Bernabeu and to play for first in the group. Auba likes pressure, he needs that pressure."" And Tuchel believes the benefit from beating Madrid to top spot in the group will come from the confidence in deposing the European champions rather than an easier tie in the last 16. ""The confidence of winning or drawing here at this level, this atmosphere, that is the value of winning group,"" he added. ""It is not an advantage for the next round from my point of view."""
448,06/12/2016,12:15,Goetze misses Real clash with knee injury,Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze has been ruled out Borussia Dortmund's Champions League clash at Real Madrid on Wednesday with a knee injury.,"Borussia has confirmed the 24-year-old will miss the match at the Bernabeu, because of a light knee injury, with leaders Dortmund holding a two-point advantage over Real. The winner of the clash in Madrid will qualify top of Group F with both teams already through to the last 16. Dortmund jetted to Madrid just one shy of the 20-goal record three teams -- Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona -- have previously tallied in the Champions League group stages. Two of those, United, in 1998/99, and Real, who achieved 'La Decima' -- a tenth European crown -- in 2013/14, went on to win that season's European title. Dortmund has said Goetze should be fit for their Bundesliga clash this weekend against Cologne."
449,06/12/2016,01:50,Dortmund's hot-shots eye goal record at Real,"Borussia Dortmund can set a new Champions League goal record at Real Madrid on Wednesday if the likes of Marco Reus, Ousmane Dembele or Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang score at the Bernabeu.","Dortmund arrive in Madrid just one shy of the 20-goal record three teams -- Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona -- have previously tallied in the Champions League group stages. Two of those, United, in 1998/99, and Real, who achieved 'La Decima' -- a tenth European crown -- in 2013/14, went on to win that season's European title. Thomas Tuchel's leaders Dortmund hold a two-point advantage over Real in Group F and the winner of Wednesday's clash in Madrid will qualify top of the table. Star-studded Real, spearheaded by Cristiano Ronaldo, present a formidable challenge at home, but Dortmund are in buoyant mood. It finished 2-2 when the teams met in Dortmund last September as Andre Schuerrle's late goal rescued the hosts after Ronaldo and Raphael Varane scored for Real and Aubameyang had netted for Borussia. But Dortmund were boosted a fortnight ago by the return of Germany winger Marco Reus after six months out with the adductor injury that saw him miss Euro 2016. The 27-year-old grabbed two goals, with a third later credited as an own goal, and set up two more when Dortmund trounced Legia Warsaw 8-4 at home a fortnight ago in a record score for a Champions League match. Reus also weighed in with three assists, and had a goal disallowed, in Dortmund's 4-1 thrashing of Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday. ""The injury, which meant a six-month break, has made him more mature,"" said Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel. ""Now Marco is back and it's fantastic the way he has returned."" Against Gladbach, Aubameyang also netted twice -- to make him the Bundesliga's top scorer with 15 goals -- and Dembele also got on the scoresheet in what Tuchel described as ""a complete performance from us"". ""In my opinion Ousmane Dembele had one of his best matches in a Dortmund shirt,"" added Tuchel. Reus is currently a joy to watch, from the way he casually robbed Gladbach defender Nico Elvedi of possession to his audacious backheel which set up Aubameyang for his second goal as Dortmund warmed up for Madrid. ""The pass was crazy, but that's just Marco Reus. You know what he's like,"" said Aubameyang. ""I am very happy that he is back. He is one of the best players we have."" Dortmund's current tally of 19 Champions League goals is boosted by their results against Legia. They romped to a 6-0 away win in Warsaw when six different players scored before the record 8-4 win at home. Dembele has been a revelation in his first season with Dortmund since joining from French side Rennes. The precociously talented winger announced his arrival with a superb goal in Dortmund's 4-1 drubbing of Manchester United on a pre-season tour of China and has produced ten assists and four goals in all competitions. Aubameyang has taken the 19-year-old Dembele under his wing, helping the teenager with his finishing, but also his defending, which had been an issue. Dembele has been guilty of giving away possession too easily, especially in Dortmund's 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt a week ago, but Tuchel says the young Frenchman was ""the difference"" in the win over Gladbach. ""He played one of his best games, because he carefully passed in situations when it was not appropriate to dribble,"" noted Tuchel. ""He defended very attentively and made the difference in certain situations."""
450,26/11/2016,18:05,Dortmund crash to defeat at Frankfurt,"Borussia Dortmund were brought crashing to earth on Saturday following their record Champions League win with a 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt, who went third in the Bundesliga.","It was a first defeat in 10 games for Dortmund and came hot on the heels of their 8-4 romp on Tuesday at home to Legia Warsaw -- a record score for a Champions League game. Hungary international Szabolcs Huszti had given the home side the lead only for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to equalise, but Haris Seferovic grabbed the winner for Frankfurt. Unbeaten in six Bundesliga games, Eintracht go level on points with reigning champions Bayern Munich, who play Bayer Leverkusen later. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel started just three of the side which began against Legia and again Dortmund were guilty of poor defending as Frankfurt scored both their goals from restarts. Frankfurt coach Niko Kovac said he was 'proud' of his team, but urged Eintracht fans not to get carried away, while Tuchel slammed his team. ""Frankfurt deserved the win, there were too many areas in our game which were lacking,"" fumed Tuchel. ""Technically, tactically, mentally and in our willingness we weren't up to it. ""The whole season is a series of ups and downs, which is unsatisfactory. ""Our performance today didn't earn a point."" After a goalless first-half at Frankfurt's Commerzbank Arena in front of a crowd of 51,500, Eintracht took the lead just 16 seconds after the break as Huszti converted a Timothy Chandler cross from close range. Tuchel responded by making three changes with just over half an hour to go, bringing on Germany star Marco Reus, France winger Ousmane Dembele and tough-tackling midfielder Sebastian Rode. The move initially paid off. Aubameyang headed home Dembele's ball on 77 minutes, but from the restart, Frankfurt attacked and Dortmund allowed Swiss striker Haris Seferovic to slot his shot past goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller. Dembele hit the crossbar in added time with Frankfurt's Finland goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky beaten. The result saw Frankfurt replace Dortmund in third and broke Borussia's run of four straight wins. It was Dortmund's first defeat since losing to Bayer Leverkusen on October 1. Fresh from their Champions League draw at home to Manchester City on Wednesday, Borussia Moenchengladbach were held to another 1-1 stalemate at Borussia Park, against Hoffenheim, to leave them winless in seven league games. Gladbach took the lead when Syrian-born Mahmoud Dahoud belted his shot into the far corner on 25 minutes. But Hoffenheim levelled through Nadiem Amiri on 53 minutes to preserve their unbeaten record this season. Wolfsburg are just two points above the relegation spots after their 1-1 draw with Ingolstadt. Anthony Jung's first-half goal for Ingolstadt was cancelled out by Daniel Caligiuri's equaliser. Wolfsburg goalkeeper Diego Benaglio saved a first-half penalty attempt by Moritz Hartmann with the match goalless. In a thrilling north German derby between the league's bottom two teams, Hamburg were held to a 2-2 draw at home to neighbours Werder Bremen, with all the goals coming in the first half. Austrian international Michael Gregoritsch scored both of Hamburg's goals either side of a Fin Bartels strike before Bremen's Serge Gnabry, who marked his senior Germany debut earlier this month with a hat-trick, made it 2-2. In the afternoon's other game Cologne, who are fourth, were held to a 0-0 draw at home by Augsburg. Later on Saturday, second-placed Bayern host Leverkusen hoping to bridge the six-point gap unbeaten leaders RB Leipzig opened on Friday with a 4-1 win at Freiburg."
451,22/11/2016,23:09,Comeback king Reus hits hat-trick in record haul,Germany winger Marco Reus claimed a hat-trick on his comeback as Borussia Dortmund hammered Legia Warsaw 8-4 on Tuesday in a record Champions League result which yielded seven first-half goals.,"It was the first time a Champions League game has had a 5-2 half-time scoreline since Monaco ended up beating Deportivo de La Coruna 8-3 in November 2003. The 12-goal haul in Dortmund bettered the record set in the Monaco-Deportivo game of 11 goals for a Champions League game. With Dortmund already through to the last 16, the huge win keeps them top of Group F, two points clear of Real Madrid. But despite the record rout, Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel has some defensive problems to iron out. ""It was a great game for the spectators, but we shouldn't have leaked those four,"" said Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, in for injured Roman Burki, who has a fractured hand. ""We have to defend better, this is the Champions League and you have to present yourself better than that."" Dortmund's Shinji Kagawa and Legia's Aleksandar Prijovic both finished with two goals each thanks to some poor defending by both teams. Reus, who captained Dortmund, made his return after 185 days out with an adductor injury which ruled him out of June's European championships. It was his first match since Dortmund lost the German Cup final to Bayern Munich on penalties in Berlin on May 21. Tuchel made nine changes to his starting line up after admitting his side looked tired mentally and physically from Saturday's 1-0 win over Bayern Munich. Only defenders Marc Bartra and Matthias Ginter kept their places in Dortmund's starting line-up. The match got off to an explosive start. Legia took an early lead when Prijovic was given too much space in the area to chip his shot home and stun the Dortmund crowd on 10 minutes. But Borussia roared back with five goals in 16 minutes. Their first three goals came in 198 seconds when Kagawa headed home on 17 minutes, then slotted a second just a minute later. To compound Warsaw's problems a clearance punch from goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak clattered off Nuri Sahin's chest and into the Legia goal to make it 3-1 on 20 minutes. Prijovic pulled another goal back for Warsaw on 26 minutes, and could have claimed a hat-trick when his chip hit the crossbar moments later. Dortmund's French winger Ousmane Dembele made it 4-2 when he beat several defenders to fire home on 29 minutes. He then helped Kagawa set up Reus for his first on 32 minutes. Dembele then weighed in with his third assist of the night with a superb cross to allow Reus to claim his second and Dortmund's sixth on 52 minutes. Warsaw midfielder Michal Kucharczyk pulled a third goal back for Legia on 57 minutes before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang came off the bench to hit the post for Dortmund. Dortmund defender Felix Passlack then scored his first Champions League goal before Hungary striker Nemanja Nikolic netted Warsaw's fourth in the final ten minutes. Reus wrapped up his hat-trick in the 93rd-minute when he converted Aubameyang's final pass at point-blank range."
452,21/11/2016,12:36,Broken hand sidelines Dortmund's Burki for Legia,Borussia Dortmund have been dealt a blow ahead of Tuesday's Champions League home match against Legia Warsaw with a broken hand ruling goalkeeper Roman Burki out until January.,"The 26-year-old first-choice shot stopper suffered the injury in Saturday's 1-0 win over Bayern Munich in Germany's 'Der Klassiker', but played the 90 minutes and the injury was only diagnosed on Sunday. Burki requires surgery which will sideline him until after the January winter break. In Burki's absence, ex-Germany veteran Roman Weidenfeller, 36, will take over in Dortmund's goal with Thomas Tuchel's side top of Group F, two points ahead of Real Madrid. Dortmund are already guaranteed a place in the last 16 of the Champions League and are hoping to have Germany winger Marco Reus back against Legia. The 27-year-old has yet to play this season after an adductor injury and his planned comeback against Bayern was delayed. ""I had problems with my heel last Wednesday after training,"" he told magazine Kicker. ""If everything goes really well, I hope to be there on Tuesday and I'll be glad when I can get back on the pitch. Dortmund can be confirmed as group winners if they beat Legia -- who Borussia hammered 6-0 in Warsaw last September -- and Real fail to win away at Sporting Lisbon, also on Tuesday night. Dortmund are unbeaten in their last eight games in all competitions despite an horrific injury list with midfielder Sven Bender and defender Neven Subotic both long-term absentees. Marcel Schmelzer, who had been out for four weeks with a groin injury, and Erik Durm, sidelined since May with a knee injury, only returned for Saturday's win over Bayern. Legia will be consigned to bottom place in the group if they fail to defeat Dortmund and Sporting win against Madrid. The Polish title holders earned their first point in the group by holding Real to a 3-3 draw in Warsaw three weeks ago."

Last season, Leicester were the shock winners of the English Premier League and Tuchel says record-breaking Leipzig can do the same in Germany. ""Last year we had the phenomenon of Leicester City in England. Leipzig can go on exactly the same path,"" said Tuchel. ""I'm convinced of that when I see them."" Leipzig set a new record of 11 games unbeaten for a club at the start of their first Bundesliga season with a 3-2 win at Bayer Leverkusen on Friday. The result left them three points clear of second-placed Bayern, who lost 1-0 at Tuchel's Dortmund on Saturday. ""It's nice for the league, it's what everyone wanted -- but not us,"" snapped Bayern's captain Philipp Lahm after Bayern's 1-0 defeat at Dortmund in Germany's 'Der Klassiker'. Aubameyang's goal settled a bad-tempered clash as Dortmund claimed their first home league win over Bayern since 2012. Bayern are finally spluttering having won a record four consecutive German league titles since 2012/13. For the first time since September 2015, Bayern are off top spot as new coach Carlo Ancelotti tasted defeat for the first time in 11 German league games. To compare, his predecessor Pep Guardiola lost his first league games on his 29th match during his debut Bundesliga season in 2013/14. ""Bayern are missing the fitness, the joy and the authority in their play,"" observed Sky expert and ex-Germany captain Lothar Matthaeus. ""A lot of things which made them strong last season are missing now."" Aubameyang has celebrated scoring Dortmund goals with somersaults and by donning a Batman outfit in the past, but he dropped to the turf for three push-ups after scoring the winning goal against Bayern. ""It was for my mate Gradur. He's a famous rapper from France, who was in the stadium,"" explained Aubameyang as the artist has performed push-ups in his music videos. Gradur -- full name Wanani Gradi Mariadi -- is a star in France where his debut album 'L'homme au bob' went to Number One. Leipzig is roughly 300kms from the coast, but RB's head coach Ralph Hasenhuettl is comparing the new Bundesliga leaders to icebergs -- the real danger is their potential lying under the surface. Only around ten percent of an iceberg is above the waterline and Hasenhuettl used the image in a motivation video before Friday's 3-2 win at Leverkusen to inspire his side to sink their opponents. ""We tried to show the team their true potential is like an iceberg before the match,"" said the Austrian, whose side is unbeaten in their first 11 Bundesliga games -- a record for a newly-promoted team. ""Much of the potential that we have is not yet on display. ""We had an incredibly good attitude and we're hard to beat,"" he added with Leipzig to play second-placed Bayern in Munich on December 20. Guardiola's Manchester City are Borussia Moenchengladbach's next opponents on Wednesday with Andre Schubert's 'Foals' dropping fast down the league table. Gladbach's 2-1 defeat at home to Cologne on Saturday left them 11th and winless in their last six league games dating to the end of September. The Champions League home match against City is a daunting prospect given Manchester's 3-1 home win over Barcelona three weeks ago and head coach Schubert is under pressure. ""Now comes the question about the coach,"" Gladbach's director of sport Max Eberl fumed to Sky after the Cologne defeat before even asked about Schubert. ""For me, that's absurd. Today a team lost who had deserved to win."" A heavy defeat to City will do little for Schubert's future with Hoffenheim, Dortmund and Barcelona, away, their forthcoming opponents."
454,21/11/2016,02:01,Spotlight on Ronaldo for European homecoming,worldfootball looks ahead to Tuesday's Champions League action as Cristiano Ronaldo goes back to first club Sporting Lisbon and Tottenham Hotspur face a crunch trip to Monaco (kick-offs 1945 GMT unless stated):,"<strong>Group E</strong> At Moscow (1700 GMT) CSKA Moscow (RUS) v Bayer Leverkusen (GER) Morale is on the floor in Moscow with CSKA bottom of Group E before Leverkusen's visit. The defending Russian champions this week saw their midfielder Roman Eremenko hit with a two-year ban for cocaine use after a positive test following the reverse fixture between the teams in September. Eremenko's goal in that match gave CSKA a 2-2 draw after being two goals down. The Muscovites registered their first win in five league games at the weekend and must win this game to keep alive their hopes of reaching the last 16. Leverkusen can progress by avoiding defeat, provided Tottenham Hotspur lose away to Monaco. The Germans are unbeaten in the section, following up three draws by beating Tottenham at Wembley last time out. However, they are struggling in mid-table in the Bundesliga having lost at home to RB Leipzig at the weekend. At Monaco Monaco (FRA) v Tottenham Hotspur (ENG) Tottenham travel to the Mediterranean principality boosted by claiming a first win in eight matches at the weekend, when they beat West Ham United 3-2 after a dramatic late fightback in the Premier League. Mauricio Pochettino's side are in real trouble in the Champions League having lost at home to Monaco and Bayer Leverkusen. They will be eliminated if they fail to win at the Stade Louis II and Leverkusen better their result when they face CSKA Moscow in Russia. Monaco need only draw the game to be sure of a place in the last 16. They will secure first place if they win and Leverkusen drop points. Leonardo Jardim's side are the leading scorers in Europe's big five leagues, averaging three goals a game in Ligue 1, including a 3-0 win at Lorient on Friday. Leading their attack is a revitalised Radamel Falcao, with the Colombian having netted nine times in all competitions this season. The teams drew 1-1 here in the Europa League last season. Toby Alderweireld and Ben Davies are on the sidelines for Spurs and Erik Lamela, who scored at the Stade Louis II last season, is also doubtful. <strong>Group F</strong> At Dortmund, Germany Borussia Dortmund (GER) v Legia Warsaw (POL) Dortmund, the 1997 winners and 2013 runners-up, are already certain to progress to the last 16 having amassed 10 points from their first four matches. Thomas Tuchel's side are now looking to secure top spot and a win at home to already-eliminated Legia will guarantee them first place, as long as Real Madrid drop points at Sporting Lisbon. At the very least, a win will ensure the Bundesliga club go to Madrid next month in a position to clinch the group. Dortmund are fresh from beating Bayern Munich 1-0 in ""Der Klassiker"" at the weekend thanks to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 12th Bundesliga goal of the season. The Gabon star was also on target as Dortmund won 6-0 away to Legia in their group opener in September. Legia, who remain in with a chance of finishing third and going into the Europa League, have improved since a poor start to the campaign. The Poles have won five of their last six games, the exception being a 3-3 draw at home to Real Madrid. At Lisbon Sporting Lisbon (POR) v Real Madrid (ESP) Cristiano Ronaldo takes on his first professional club Sporting as a champion of Europe with Real and Portugal and is widely expected to pick up his fourth Ballon d'Or. He will doubtless receive a hero's welcome on his return to the Estadio Jose Alvalade. Ronaldo's hat-trick this weekend, his 39th for Real, delivered a 3-0 away win at Atletico Madrid despite the visitors missing six key players in captain Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Casemiro, Toni Kroos, Alvaro Morata and Karim Benzema. Champions League holders Real won the reverse fixture 2-1 and are unbeaten in 29 games in all competitions. All Zinedine Zidane's men need here is a point to secure passage to the next round, but with Dortmund top of the group by two points Real will want to hunt them down as a point of pride -- and to earn an easier draw in the next round. Sporting are on an upturn and scoring regularly and are still in with a chance of the Europa League. <strong>Group G</strong> At Leicester, England Leicester City (ENG) v Club Brugge (BEL) English champions Leicester top Group G with 10 points and have yet to concede a goal. Conversely, Brugge are yet to notch up a single point. A draw for the hosts would mean they progress to the next stage with a game to spare. Domestically, the unlikely Premier League champions have struggled to reproduce the form that delivered the title to the King Power Stadium and sit just two points above the relegation zone after a 2-1 weekend defeat to Watford. Claudio Ranieri's men however, including Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, who are on the Ballon d'Or list, are a different proposition in their maiden Champions League campaign. It even looks as if Ranieri is prioritising Europe over the Premier League. At Copenhagen FC Copenhagen (DEN) v Porto (POR) Copenhagen bagged a 1-1 draw away to second-placed Porto in September and are fighting for Champions League survival in this game, in which a win for the Portuguese would see them qualify. But Porto are misfiring with only two wins in their past five outings in all competitions while Stale Solbakken's charges are unbeaten in their five games at home in Europe this season. Porto go into the clash with the depressing effect of having lost a penalty shoot-out to Chaves in the Portuguese Cup at the weekend, while the hosts powered to yet another win in the league. A win for the Danes would see them leap-frog their opponents in the group. Has the makings of a classic. <strong>Group H</strong> At Seville, Spain Sevilla (ESP) v Juventus (ITA) This is arguably the match of the round with Sevilla top on 10 points and visitors Juve second on eight with a tight 0-0 draw in Italy in the reverse fixture. Sevilla are flying high in Spain after they produced a stunning fightback from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at Deportivo la Coruna. Argentine coach Jorge Sampaoli's version of Sevilla is thrilling fans after transforming the Europa League champions into a free-thinking outfit. Italian champions Juventus go into the showdown on the back of a 3-0 Serie A win over Pescara. ""It's an important game for us because we have to win one of our last two games to go through,"" coach Massimiliano Allegri said. Juve may have to do it the hard way with several defenders carrying knocks, but the forward line of Mario Mandzukic and Gonzalo Higuain is a frightening prospect for Sevilla. At Zagreb Dinamo Zagreb (CRO) v Lyon (FRA) Dinamo cannot qualify for the next round after a miserable Champions League campaign that has seen them fail to earn a point or even score a goal in four matches. They still have the consolation of the Europa League just about alive, but must win this game for starters. Lyon, with four points from four games, are only slightly better off and need a victory in Zagreb and for Juventus to fail to win to live another day. Lyon are fourth in Ligue 1 in France and their form has picked up in domestic competition after a slow start. Bafetimbi Gomis -- now at rivals Marseille -- scored four, including an eight-minute hat-trick, when Lyon won 7-1 in Zagreb in the 2011/12 group stage."
455,19/11/2016,21:11,Dortmund stun Bayern to leave RB Leipzig top,"Borussia Dortmund stunned champions and arch-rivals Bayern Munich 1-0 on Saturday in a bad-tempered clash in ""Der Klassiker"" to leave RB Leipzig the shock Bundesliga leaders.","Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang prodded in on 11 minutes at a frenzied Signal Iduna Park to propel Dortmund up to third on 21 points, three points behind Bayern, for whom this was a first defeat of the league season. RB Leipzig are top, unbeaten and three points clear of the mighty Bayern, after a thrilling 3-2 win at Bayer Leverkusen on Friday signalled another milestone in their fast rise to the top of German football. Aubameyang scored the only goal of the game -- he should have gone on to grab at least two more -- poking in the ball from close range after ex-Bayern man Mario Goetze's cross. The striker celebrated with three push-ups and the home side were on the attack again moments later, the Bayern rearguard creaking as the fans at the intimidating 81,000 arena ratcheted up the volume once more. The game had simmered to this point, but it threatened to boil over as the half wore on, with Dortmund conceding a series of free-kicks and referee Tobias Stieler struggling to keep a lid on it. Stieler had a word with Thomas Tuchel after the Dortmund coach protested one challenge and Marc Bartra was booked for a bad challenge on Bayern's Thomas Mueller. Soon after Bartra was penalised again for tugging down Robert Lewandowski and was fortunate that Stieler decided to keep his cards in his pocket. The momentum was now with Carlo Ancelotti's men and Bayern piled on the pressure, Thiago Alcantara just failing to properly connect with a flying scissor kick five minutes before half-time. Aubameyang should have put the home side 2-0 up soon after the restart, but he headed feebly over, and then Goetze got away with only a yellow card for a nasty challenge on Franck Ribery that left the Frenchman in agony on the turf. The visitors were a whisker from equalising around the hour mark when Xabi Alonso let fly from distance, the ball crashing off the crossbar. On 71 minutes Aubameyang should have sealed the game for Dortmund, but he shot straight at Manuel Neuer after a Bayern lapse at the back. Ribery was in the thick of it again in the dying minutes and was booked when the two sides clashed once more, the referee's assistants running onto the pitch to help restore order. Polish predator Lewandowski should have levelled the score at the death but he inexplicably headed wide when clear and unmarked. On Friday, Bundesliga newcomers RB Leipzig stretched their unbeaten run to a record 11 games as defender Willi Orban delivered the winning goal nine minutes from time at Bayer Leverkusen. Kevin Kampl fired Leverkusen into an early lead at the BayArena but Julian Baumgartlinger's own goal drew Leipzig level almost immediately. Germany international Julian Brandt made it 2-1 to the hosts just before half-time, but the turning point came when Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi saved a 54th-minute penalty from Hakan Calhanoglu. Emil Forsberg equalised for Leipzig following an impressive solo run on 67 minutes before Orban's late winner sent the Bundesliga upstarts three points clear of Bayern Munich. Cologne sit fourth, level on points with Dortmund, after Anthony Modeste struck his league-leading 12th goal in a 2-1 away win at Borussia Moenchengladbach."
456,18/11/2016,02:30,Bayern under pressure for 'biggest challenge',Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich face a stern challenge to their place at the top of the table this weekend when Carlo Ancelotti's Bavarian giants play Borussia Dortmund away on Saturday.,"Bayern could be knocked from top spot even before kick-off if second-placed RB Leipzig pick up a point at Bayer Leverkusen on Friday night to extend their unbeaten record to 11 matches. But all eyes will be on Dortmund, where the German league's top two strikers -- Borussia's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Bayern's Robert Lewandowski -- will go head-to-head. Fifth-placed Dortmund are six points behind Bayern in what promises to be a battle royal and between them, Aubameyang and Lewandowski have scored 18 league goals. ""It's not just the fans who look forward to this game, but the players as well,"" said Bayern's Germany forward Thomas Mueller. ""It's the best game of the year, because it's the hardest to win. ""It's the biggest challenge."" The battle of Germany's top two teams has been dubbed 'Der Klassiker' by the German media in recent years, but Dortmund's last league win over Bayern -- home or away -- was more than two years ago. Nevertheless, hosts Dortmund are eager for their first win over the Bavarians at Signal Iduna Park since April 2012. Both sides have stars with a point to prove against their former club. Bayern's Germany defender Mats Hummels can expect to face a cacophony of whistles and jeers every time the ex-Dortmund captain touches the ball. ""If we lose then lots of teams, including Dortmund, will be very close behind us (in the table),"" said Hummels. Mario Goetze, who spent the last three seasons in Munich, will lead Dortmund's attack while defensive midfielder Sebastian Rode is hoping for a start against ex-club Bayern. Dortmund winger Marco Reus could make his first start of the season after a groin injury while Bayern have had both defender Jerome Boateng and winger Franck Ribery back in training after knocks. Dutch winger Arjen Robben has been given the all clear after complaining of a sore thigh in the Netherlands' 3-1 win over Luxembourg on Sunday in a World Cup qualifier. But Bayern are waiting to hear if Arturo Vidal is fit after the Chile midfielder played in a mid-week World Cup qualifier while carrying an injury -- despite requests not to do so from Bayern's chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. ""Best not to ask,"" Vidal told reporters after hurting his thigh during Chile's 3-1 win over Uruguay, having also returned from international duty in October with an ankle injury. Elsewhere, third-placed Hoffenheim, under Julian Nagelsmann, the youngest coach in Bundesliga history at 29, are at home to bottom side Hamburg on Sunday. Hoffenheim are unbeaten this season and have caused opponents all manner of problems with a solid 3-5-2 formation. They held Bayern to a 1-1 draw last time out while Hamburg have yet to win a game this season. Borussia Moenchengladbach have failed to win any of their last five games and they face Cologne on Saturday in the Rhineland derby. Coach Andre Schubert is under pressure and his side needs a confidence-boosting win for next Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Manchester City with Gladbach clinging on to third place in Group C.

""It's not a joke, it's not a marketing stunt,"" the club's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke told Germany's Kicker online on Sunday. ""It has been decided for some time,"" he said, adding that the idea had been mentioned by sportswear maker Puma, a corporate partner of both the team and Bolt. ""Puma boss Bjoern Gulden, who is also a member of our supervisory board, told me weeks ago that Usain had asked if he could train with us,"" Watzke said. ""I said sure, no problem at all ... We're happy, it's an honour for us."" No date had been set yet for when Bolt would join the training, Watzke said. He dismissed the idea of Bolt actually joining the team as a professional footballer, telling Kicker that ""this is something we don't need to talk about"". Bolt has often stated his dream of playing football, preferably for Manchester United, and he told The Guardian again that joining the Premier League powerhouse indeed ""would be epic""."
458,11/11/2016,16:45,Legia fans barred from Dortmund trip,UEFA ruled on Friday that Legia Warsaw fans will not be allowed to attend their upcoming Champions League match away to Borussia Dortmund on November 22 after Polish supporters clashed with police in Madrid last month.,"Legia had already been forced to host Real Madrid behind closed doors for the return meeting in Warsaw on November 2 due to previous crowd disturbances during September's 6-0 thrashing at home to Dortmund. Thirteen Legia fans were then held following clashes with police outside the Santiago Bernabeu stadium as Real won 5-1 on October 18. As a result, UEFA has banned Legia from selling tickets to the club's away supporters for their next European match and hit them with another fine of 80,000 euros ($87,000). The Polish team could face a further two-game punishment for any recurring trouble, with the additional sanction deferred for a probationary period of one year. Legia are bottom of Group F with just one point from four matches."
459,07/11/2016,16:23,Aubameyang is a bit like Ronaldo - Watzke,"Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang enjoys the limelight just as much as football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, according to his club's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke.","""He's the sort of player who enjoys being in the spotlight a bit. There are players like that. He's a bit like Cristiano Ronaldo, but 'Auba' can handle it,"" Watzke told German daily Bild. The Gabon hot-shot put a crazy six days behind him by scoring four goals in Saturday's 5-2 drubbing of Hamburg away which broke the club's four-match winless streak in Germany's top flight. His goal-haul came after coach Thomas Tuchel threw him out of Dortmund's squad for Wednesday's Champions League win over Sporting Lisbon for flying with his friends to Milan on a private jet last Monday for a shopping trip. Having apologised to his team-mates and coach for his unauthorised jaunt, Aubameyang redeemed himself in Hamburg and his 11 league goals makes him the Bundesliga's joint top scorer this season. ""The reaction from 'Auba' was awesome, but was also to have been expected,"" said Watzke. ""We noticed that (his remorse) straight away during our conversations."" The rout of Hamburg left Dortmund fifth in the table and set the club up for their next Bundesliga game at home to leaders Bayern Munich a week on Saturday following the international break. ""It's a good opportunity for us to get back (up the table),"" said Watzke as Dortmund lag six points behind Bayern in the league table. ""We have to make sure we are ready for this game."" But Watzke ruled out any repeat of the Milan trip for Aubameyang, even if it did yield four goals in his next game. ""No, he's flying to play for his national team and his action is not intended to be repeated,"" said Watzke dryly with Gabon to face Mali away in a 2018 World Cup qualifier on Saturday."
460,05/11/2016,18:34,"Aubameyang hits four, Hoffenheim hold Bayern","Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted four goals on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund routed bottom side Hamburg 5-2 away, while Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich drew 1-1 at home with Hoffenheim.","The result at Munich's Allianz Arena means second-placed RB Leipzig can draw level on 24 points with Bayern if they win at home to mid-table Mainz on Sunday. It was a fine result for Hoffenheim, who remain unbeaten this season under their 29-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann. But the day belonged to Aubameyang, who redeemed himself for a reported midweek indiscretion with four clinically taken goals as Dortmund won for the first time in five league games to go fifth. According to German media, Aubameyang had been suspended by coach Thomas Tuchel for Wednesday's 1-0 Champions League win at home to Sporting Lisbon after he had jetted to Milan with friends on Monday. But all seems to have been forgiven in Hamburg as the Gabon striker celebrated his first goal with Tuchel amidst plenty of smiles. 'Auba' needed just 27 minutes to score his first three goals and hit his fourth after the break. ""I made a mistake and I had to apologise. I have already said 'sorry' to the team and the coach,"" Aubameyang told Sky. ""I needed to render my services to the whole team and the coach, who I get on very well with."" He netted Dortmund's first with just four minutes gone. Borussia's pressing then forced Hamburg captain Johan Djourou into a mistake, and Turkish teenager Emre Mor pounced to present Aubameyang with a simple tap-in on 23 minutes. The hat-trick came four minutes later. A clearance from Hamburg goalkeeper Rene Adler was returned with interest by Marc Bartra, who put Aubameyang away for his third. It was 4-0 three minutes after the break when Christian Pulisic pounced on a loose ball and fed Aubameyang, who drilled a superb shot into the bottom-left corner. Hamburg pulled two goals back through Nicolai Mueller, who netted their first goal in 717 Bundesliga minutes dating back to September 10, but Ousmane Dembele came off the bench to net Dortmund's fifth late on. This was a woeful Hamburg display and not what Germany legend Uwe Seeler wished for on his 80th birthday as he watched his ex-club's eighth defeat in 10 league games. In Munich, Bayern were denied a sixth straight win by third-placed Hoffenheim, who preserve their unbeaten record this season. Hoffenheim's Kerem Demirbay beautifully timed his arrival in the box to smash Nadiem Amiri's pass into the top-left corner on 16 minutes, but the lead did not last. When Douglas Costa fired in a cross, Hoffenheim midfielder Steven Zuber deflected the ball between his own goalkeeper's legs for an own goal on 34 minutes with Bayern's Robert Lewandowski waiting at the far post. Bayern, who were playing in jerseys made from recycled rubbish from the sea, saw their luck desert them as they fished for the winning goal. Both Mats Hummels and Thomas Mueller hit the woodwork in the last five minutes. Having beaten Tottenham Hotspur away in the Champions League in midweek, Bayer Leverkusen enjoyed a 3-1 win over Darmstadt with goals by Hakan Calhanoglu, Julian Brandt and Charles Aranguiz. Wolfsburg shot up out of the relegation places to 13th with a 3-0 win in pouring rain at ten-man Freiburg as Germany striker Mario Gomez scored twice while Ricardo Rodriguez converted a late penalty. It was Wolfsburg's first win since the opening day of the season. On Friday, fourth-placed Hertha Berlin won 3-0 at home to jaded Borussia Moenchengladbach as Salomon Kalou scored a hat-trick for his first goals since April. The Ivory Coast forward welcomed his first goals since losing his father in August, two weeks before his aunt also passed away. ""It's a relief with all the difficult situations I've had to deal with,"" he said."
461,02/11/2016,21:23,Dortmund suspend Aubameyang for Sporting clash,"Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday suspended star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for their Champions League game against Sporting Lisbon ""for internal reasons"".","""The coach has taken the decision and it is absolutely correct,"" Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke told Sky. The 27-year-old Aubameyang, who has scored 10 goals already this season, is suspended until Thursday and was left out of the squad against Sporting. Colombia striker Adrian Ramos took the Gabon captain's place up front in a 4-1-4-1 formation with a win to put Dortmund in the last 16. ""We completely accept there will be speculation, but internal means internal,"" added Tuchel in refusing to give more details. Aubameyang has a Dortmund contract until June 2020, but the suspension will alert Europe's top clubs, especially Real Madrid. The Gabon striker has made no secret of his desire to play for the Spanish giants having promised his now deceased grandfather he would one day play for Real."
462,01/11/2016,12:26,Struggling Dortmund target last 16,Borussia Dortmund are looking to hold top spot in Group F with a win over Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday to put them in the Champions League's knock-out stages.,"Dortmund enjoyed a 2-1 win at Sporting a fortnight ago with goals by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and midfielder Julian Weigl, his first for the club, to leave them top of the group on goal difference from defending champions Real Madrid. Dortmund will book a last 16 place with victory at their Signal Iduna Park against third-placed Sporting, who are four points behind both Borussia and second-placed Real Madrid. Dortmund's final group match at Real on December 7 is likely to settle who will win the group, but for now the focus is on Sporting. ""We need to put the whole package on the pitch,"" said Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel. ""Anything else would be light-hearted and unprofessional. I'm counting on Sporting showing their best side."" However, Jorge Jesus-coached Sporting have a miserable record in Germany. They have have never won in Germany with one draw and 11 defeats, while Dortmund have a 100 percent home record against Portuguese sides in Europe with four wins in four games. But Tuchel's Dortmund have struggled of late. They are winless in their last four Bundesliga match, dating back to late September, and were held to a goalless league draw at home by rivals Schalke on Saturday in the Ruhr derby. ""It feels very tough, as if you were to fight very hard for every little thing,"" fumed Tuchel. Their only wins in October were at Sporting and last week's penalty shoot-out victory over second division Union Berlin in the second round of the German Cup. World Cup-winner Mario Goetze has said recent results have left a bad feeling. ""We have to reward ourselves better,"" he added. The reason for their dip in form has been a horrific run of injuries. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (calf), Marc Bartra (groin) and Christian Pulisic (ill) missed the penalty shoot-out win over Union last Wednesday, but were involved in Saturday's goalless draw with Schalke. Aubameyang and Pulisic played in the Ruhr derby while Bartra was an unused substitute. Club captain Marcel Schmelzer has been out since October 14 with a groin injury, while Andre Schuerrle and Raphael Guerreiro both made substitute appearances on Saturday after injury spells. Sven Bender (ankle), Marco Reus (groin), Neven Subotic (ribs) and Erik Durm (knee) are all long-term absentees. Reus is back in full training, but will not feature against Sporting. Director of sport Michael Zorc says the priority is to beat Sporting to put them in the knock-out stages so they can concentrate on their league form ahead of Saturday's away league match at bottom side Hamburg. ""We definitely want to underline our good position with a victory, because we need to focus on the league afterwards,"" said Zorc."
463,27/10/2016,00:21,"Bayern march on in cup, Dortmund need penalties",Holders Bayern Munich reached the third round of the German Cup with a 3-1 win over Augsburg on Wednesday while second-division Union Berlin took injury-hit Borussia Dortmund to penalties.,"Goals by Philipp Lahm, Julian Green and David Alaba sealed Bayern's win at the Allianz Arena, while Borussia, last season's finalists, endured nervous moments before beating Union 3-0 in a shoot-out after it finished 1-1 in Dortmund. In Munich, Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti rested a host of stars for Saturday's away Bundesliga clash -- also against Augsburg -- and next Tuesday's Champions League clash at PSV Eindhoven. Alaba, Holger Badstuber, Arjen Robben, Arturo Vidal, Xabi Alonso and Robert Lewandowski were all on the bench while US striker Green made a rare start. Bastuber came on for the last ten minutes for his first appearance in nearly nine months after injury. ""In the first galf we controlled the game, but we weren't so good after the break,"" admitted Ancelotti. ""I'm very pleased that Holger is back, he worked hard for it."" Bayern went ahead with two minutes gone when Thomas Mueller fed Lahm and the Bayern captain drilled home his shot. Mueller then floated in the cross which Green headed home to make it 2-0 on 41 minutes. Bayern defender Mats Hummels conceded a penalty on Augsburg midfielder Gojko Kacar, but Manuel Neuer came to the rescue when Germany's goalkeeper saved Koo Ja-Cheol's spot kick on 49 minutes. Augsburg pulled a goal back on the counter attack when Ji Dong-Won cut in and blasted his shot home from a tight angle on 69 minutes. But Alaba came on with five minutes to go and rifled home Bayern's third in the 94th minute to settle the result. Dortmund, missing a host of injured stars like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Marco Reus, went through after a scare. Dortmund took the lead thanks to a first-half own goal from ex-Dortmund defender Michael Parensen, but Union striker Steven Skrzybski levelled with nine minutes left Goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller was Dortmund's hero with two saves in the shoot-out, while Ousmane Dembele, Matthias Ginter and Mario Goetze netted their spot-kicks. Schalke scrapped into the third round with a nervy 3-2 win over second-division Nuremberg. Ukraine winger Yevhen Konoplyanka scored twice as the Royal Blues raced into a 3-0 half-time lead. But Ghana defender Abdul Rahman Baba, on loan from Chelsea netted an own goal, then Tobias Kempe converted a penalty for Nuremberg to set up a tense final 20 minutes. Cologne beat Hoffenheim 2-1 as Anthony Modeste, the Bundesliga's top scorer, netted a 91st-winner in extra time as Hoffenheim suffered their first defeat of the season. There were several upsets elsewhere. Bundesliga club Darmstadt were humbled 1-0 by fourth division Astoria Walldorf while second division Greuther Fuerth sealed a 2-1 win over top-tier side Mainz. In total, seven top German league clubs exited at the second-round stage. On Tuesday, Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen lost on penalties to third-division Sportfreunde Lotte which leaves head coach Roger Schmidt under pressure. Freiburg were beaten by second-division Sandhausen and Eintracht Frankfurt beat Ingolstadt on penalties in an all-Bundesliga clash."
464,25/10/2016,16:54,Aubameyang deepens Dortmund injury crisis,"Borussia Dortmund's injury crisis has deepened with attackers Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Ousmane Dembele and Christian Pulisic the latest stars ruled out.","Dortmund host second-division Union Berlin on Wednesday in the second-round of the German Cup, but are set to be without Dembele and Pulisic, who are ill, while hot-shot striker Aubameyang has a calf injury. ""It's very questionable whether they can participate,"" said coach Thomas Tuchel after the trio failed to train on Tuesday. The three have added to Dortmund's woes with Andre Schuerrle, Raphael Guerrerio, Marcel Schmelzer, Sven Bender, Erik Durm, Neven Subotic and Marco Reus all either out injured or returning from injury. ""We are working from day to day and there are always players who might need a break, but that is not an option at the moment, said Tuchel. Tuchel says his drastic personnel problems have lowered his expectations with Borussia to host Union, then Schalke in the Ruhr derby on Saturday night before playing Sporting Lisbon next Tuesday in the Champions League. ""The standards we set ourselves have fallen. We lack the playfulness, the quality and a lot of experience,"" admitted Tuchel. Draws with Hertha Berlin and Ingolstadt, plus defeat against Bayer Leverkusen, mean Dortmund are winless in their last three league games. Union will not give Dortmund, who lost this year's cup final to Bayern Munich on penalties, an easy ride and the Berlin-based team are second in Germany's second tier. ""We back ourselves to win the game, that's our basic requirement,"" added Tuchel."
465,28/09/2016,02:10,Third straight Real draw frustrates Zidane in Dortmund,Zinedine Zidane admitted he was frustrated at Real Madrid's third straight draw after Andre Schuerrle's late equaliser ensured a 2-2 stalemate at Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday.,"Real's serene run since Zidane took charge in January has hit a minor slump in the past week as Real dropped points against Villarreal and Las Palmas to snap a 16-game winning streak in La Liga. The defending European champions were heading towards a first win in Dortmund at the sixth attempt in the Group F contest thanks to goals by Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane. But Schuerrle struck with three minutes left as Dortmund came back for a second time after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was credited with the goal which cancelled out Ronaldo's early effort. ""The shame is it is three games in a row now which we have drawn,"" said Real coach Zidane. ""The players played a geat match, the result is a difficult one to accept, because we deserved a bit more, but it's not a bad result. ""I think in the first half we suffered a bit, because they pressed a lot and we knew it is a difficult place to come and play against a good team. ""I am very proud of the game we played, but when you concede three minutes from the end it hurts, especially given the effort the players put in."" Germany winger Schuerrle came off the bench to rescue Dortmund's unbeaten record against Real at their Signal Iduna Park stadium. ""We started very well and found enough space for our game, but in the last third, we took the wrong decisions,"" said the winger. ""If you come back twice against Real Madrid, that's a nice feeling. That will help the team to grow together."" The 25-year-old finished with a heavily-strapped right knee and hopes to be fit for Saturday's match against fellow Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga. His coach said Dortmund did well to come back twice. ""It felt good to have twice been behind, but still not to have lost, but we could have done better,"" said Thomas Tuchel. ""We lost control of the game in the second half, but we showed some good morale and reacted well after their second goal."" Madrid took the lead when Ronaldo netted his 95th Champions League goal early on. Aubameyang was credited with the equaliser just before the break as Keylor Navas fisted out a Raphael Guerreiro free-kick only for the ball to rebound back towards goal off Varane. But the French international defender enjoyed second-half redemption when he stabbed home on 68 minutes before Dortmund levelled in the dying stages. ""All in all, we can live with the result, but it's never nice to concede a late goal,"" said Real's Germany midfielder Toni Kroos. ""It's a bit annoying, but a draw is a fair result overall. ""They were very strong and controlled the ball in the first half. ""They pressed us early and we didn't see enough of the ball in the first 45 minutes to our taste, which we were able to correct."" James Rodriguez, who along with Gareth Bale helped to set up Ronaldo's opener, said the draw will act as a confidence boost. ""We leave here with very good sensations, which is different to the last two games,"" said the Colombia playmaker. ""They always press a lot, it is a very difficult place to come and the fair result would have been for us to win. ""We've drawn in the last two La Liga games. We have another game on Sunday and we need to bounce back,"" he added ahead of their Spanish league match at home to Eibar on Sunday. Real's next Group F outing is at home to Legia Warsaw next month, while Dortmund visit Sporting, who beat the Polish champions 2-0 on Tuesday."

467,27/09/2016,23:07,Schuerrle strikes late as Dortmund deny Real,Andre Schuerrle rescued Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday with an 87th-minute equaliser to seal a 2-2 draw with Real Madrid and deny the Spaniards a rare Champions League win in Germany.,"Real were minutes from a first win in Dortmund in six attempts, and the result means the Spanish giants have won only four times in 30 away games against German clubs. Madrid took the lead when Cristiano Ronaldo netted his 95th Champions League goal early on. Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was credited with the equaliser just before the break after a deflection off Raphael Varane. But the French international enjoyed second-half redemption when he stabbed home on 68 minutes before Dortmund levelled in the dying stages. Ronaldo had been left fuming after being substituted by Real coach Zinedine Zidane for the final 20 minutes of Saturday's 2-2 draw at Las Palmas in La Liga. And the superstar chose to celebrate his goal at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park with his Portugal team-mates Fabio Coentrao and Pepe, who were on the Real bench, with Zidane in the background. Dortmund dominated the opening quarter of an hour before Ronaldo's opener and both goalkeepers were tested in the first five minutes. Matthias Ginter gave away a free-kick just outside the area and Ronaldo's powerful shot was blocked by Dortmund shot-stopper Roman Burki. At the other end, Gonzalo Castro's well-struck shot tested Costa Rica goalkeeper Keylor Navas, who was making his first appearance of the season after injury. Ronaldo was lucky that the referee failed to spot his clear handball from an Aubameyang free-kick shortly after, and teenage French winger Ousmane Dembele then fired over. But Real took the lead when Ronaldo finished off a sweeping move. Luka Modric and Karim Benzema combined to get the ball out of their own half. When the ball was played into the Dortmund area, James Rodriguez fed Gareth Bale who played the ball back between his legs for Ronaldo to sweep his shot home on 17 minutes. At the other end, Aubameyang clipped the bar and was pulled up for offside on 29 minutes before a bullet header from defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos was too close to Navas. But Dortmund kept up the pressure and drew level on 43 minutes when Navas opted to punch out a Raphael Guerreiro free-kick. The ball rebounded into the net off the unfortunate Varane with Aubameyang in close proximity, although the Gabon striker was officially given the goal. The equaliser was lucky, but it was no more than Dortmund deserved. Just before the half-time whistle, Ronaldo's header hit the back of the Dortmund net, but the flag went up for offside. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel introduced Schuerrle for Germany's World Cup-winner Mario Goetze on 58 minutes in what proved to be an inspired switch. Real took the lead a second time when Varane followed in to score after a Benzema attempt had struck the post and the bar. But Dortmund were not done, and when Aubameyang's attempt at an overhead kick distracted Danilo, the ball brushed off his chest and into Schuerrle's path as the Germany winger fired home the equaliser."
468,26/09/2016,19:12,Tuchel relishing Dortmund's Real showdown,Thomas Tuchel is relishing the prospect of Borussia Dortmund's showdown with Cristiano Ronaldo-led Real Madrid in Tuesday's Champions League group stage clash.,"Dortmund have never lost at home to Real, who have won just four times in 29 away games against German clubs. The hosts' Signal Iduna Park stadium has particularly bad memories for Madrid, who have lost their last three visits to the Bundesliga giants. Real won their first Group F game with a 2-1 comeback win against Sporting Lisbon, while Dortmund romped to a 6-0 victory at Legia Warsaw. But Tuchel says none of that will count against the defending European champions with Ronaldo just three away from being the first player to score 100 goals in Europe. ""Cristiano is one of the best footballers in the world,"" said Tuchel. ""He's an incredible winner, who can help his team at every stage of the game."" Ronaldo was furious to have been subbed in Saturday's 2-2 Spanish league draw with Las Palmas. Draws with Villarreal and Gran Canaria's Las Palmas ended Real 16-game winning streak in the Spanish league, but Tuchel reads nothing into that. ""We are preparing to face the best Real Madrid and Cristiano Ronaldo in top form,"" said the Dortmund coach. ""Their quality is exceptional. ""Players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema or Alvaro Morata are very dangerous. ""We'll need our utmost attention and solidarity, plus a lot of hard work. ""It's the Champions League, it brings out the best in players on evenings like this."" Tuchel said his stars Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Marc Bartra, Andre Schuerrle and Adrian Ramos are all fit after sustaining knocks. Real's midfielder Casemiro will be missing with injury and Tuchel says it will be a blow to Zinedine Zidane's team. ""He is a very important, very strong in the tackle and he's a strong runner, who Real will of course miss,"" said Tuchel. Borussia have scored 20 goals in winning their last four games. Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki says it will be a dream come true to face Real's BBC attack - Benzema, Bale and Cristiano (Ronaldo). ""This is like a childhood dream. Everyone dreams of playing against Real in their career,"" said Burki. ""We go out there with our heads held high, we're in great shape."""
469,26/09/2016,11:54,Disgruntled Ronaldo eyes more records at Dortmund,Disgruntled Cristiano Ronaldo could make more Champions League history on Tuesday as his Real Madrid side look to end their losing streak at Borussia Dortmund.,"A hat-trick for Ronaldo in Dortmund, who was left fuming after being substituted on Saturday, would see him become the first player to score 100 European goals. Real coach Zinedine Zidane subbed Ronaldo for the final 20 minutes of Saturday's 2-2 Spanish league draw at Las Palmas. The Portuguese superstar failed to look Zidane in the eye as he came off, but his coach brushed off the sideline snub. ""Not only Ronaldo gets upset when he is substituted,"" said the Frenchman. ""We have to live with the discussions. ""I'm not stupid, he's not stupid. ""We have travelled here with just one goal and we're thinking only about the game."" Ronaldo's free-kick equaliser in Real's 2-1 comeback win against Sporting Lisbon in their first Group F, the same night Dortmund won 6-0 at Legia Warsaw, left him on 97 goals in European club competition. His main rival in the race to 100 goals is Barcelona's star Lionel Messi, who has 89. But Borussia want to maintain their unbeaten home record against Real, who have won just four times in 29 away games against German clubs. Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park stadium has particularly bad memories for Madrid, who have lost their last three visits to the Bundesliga giants. Their 2-0 defeat at Dortmund in the 2014 quarter-finals came a year after their 4-1 thumping in the 2013 semi-finals when Robert Lewandowski scored all four goals for Borussia. They also lost a group stage game 2-1 at Dortmund in 2012. Real's serene run since Zidane took charge in January has hit a slump in the past week. The European champions dropped points against Villarreal and Las Palmas to snap a 16-game winning streak in the Spanish league. ""I'm not worried. We can certainly play better, but sometimes such games are also good, such results sometimes shake you awake,"" said Zidane. Confidence is high in the Dortmund camp. After their shock 1-0 defeat at newly-promoted RB Leipzig a fortnight ago in the Bundesliga, Dortmund have netted 20 goals in the four games since. They are second only to Bayern Munich in Germany's top flight. ""We are preparing to face the best Real Madrid and Cristiano Ronaldo in top form,"" said coach Thomas Tuchel. ""We'll need our utmost attention and solidarity, plus a lot of hard work. ""It's the Champions League, it brings out the best in players on evenings like this."" Tuchel said his stars Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Marc Bartra, Andre Schuerrle and Adrian Ramos are all fit after sustaining knocks. Goetze is expected to partner Raphael Guerreiro in Dortmund's attacking midfield. French teenager Ousmane Dembele and Germany's Andre Schuerrle are set to play on the wings to feed crosses into Aubameyang and Co. Germany midfielder Julian Weigl will play as the lone defensive midfielder in front of the back four. For Madrid, Ronaldo will start alongside Gareth Bale in the star-studded Real attack. Karim Benzema is expected to beat out Alvaro Morata for the number nine role after coming off the bench to score Real's second against Las Palmas. However, the visitors will be without Brazilian duo Marcelo and Casemiro through injury. Casemiro's absence means ex-Bayern midfielder Toni Kroos will be forced to operate as the holding midfielder on his return to Germany."
470,20/09/2016,22:26,Dortmund rout Wolfsburg to go top in Germany,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck twice on Tuesday as Borussia Dortmund romped to another big win with a 5-1 victory at VfL Wolfsburg to temporarily top the German league table.,"Having hammered both Legia Warsaw and Darmstadt 6-0 in their previous matches, Thomas Tuchel's Dortmund handed out another drubbing with Gonzalo Castro setting up two of their goals. The thrashing leaves Dortmund top on goals scored, with nine points from a possible 12, a status they will lose on Wednesday when Bayern Munich host Hertha Berlin. The only teams still with 100 percent records meet at Munich's Allianz Arena with Hertha chasing their first league win in Bavaria since 1977. It was another bad night for Wolfsburg, who have won only once in four games so far, and new signing Mario Gomez. The Germany striker has yet to score since joining from Fiorentina and was repeatedly denied by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki. Dortmund needed just four minutes to take the lead at the Volkswagen Arena when centre-back Marc Bartra threaded his pass through the Wolfsburg defence. Portugal midfielder Raphael Guerreiro sprinted onto the perfect pass and drilled his shot inside the near post. Dortmund doubled their lead on 17 minutes when Aubameyang looped his shot over Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels. But Wolfsburg dragged their way back into the match. Burki blocked left-back Ricardo Rodriguez's powerfully struck free-kick with half-time approaching and then Wolfsburg deservedly pulled a goal back just after the break. Moments after Gomez was again denied by Burki's point-blank save, Daniel Didavi met Paul Seguin's superb cross and drilled his shot just inside the near post on 53 minutes. But Dortmund hit their third five minutes later when Castro pulled two defenders out of position to allow winger Ousmane Dembele a simple tap-in. Castro then sprinted into the area and squared to Aubameyang, who slid his shot inside the far post on 62 minutes, before Lukasz Piszczek added Dortmund's fifth with a powerful header. Eintracht Frankfurt moved up to fourth with their third win from four games as defender David Abraham and Bastian Oczipka netted in their 2-0 victory at Ingolstadt. Newly promoted Freiburg inflicted a third straight defeat on Hamburg, who are third from bottom, as ex-Bayern Munich striker Nils Petersen scored the second-half winner. Hoffenheim picked up a fourth draw after their 1-1 with Darmstadt when Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric's goal was cancelled out by Darmstadt's Denys Oliinyk in the 92nd minute. On Wednesday, unbeaten RB Leipzig host Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach. Schalke 04 are desperate for points at home to Cologne after three straight defeats to leave them second from bottom. Bottom side Werder Bremen host Mainz having sacked coach Viktor Skripnik on Sunday after three straight defeats."
471,19/09/2016,18:07,Dortmund juggernaut to tackle goal-shy Wolfsburg,Free-scoring Borussia Dortmund head to Wolfsburg for Tuesday's Bundesliga clash looking to continue an impressive scoring streak that has seen them bag 12 goals in two matches.,"In contrast, Germany striker Mario Gomez is desperate to break his Wolves' duck after failing to score in his first two appearances for the club. Wolfsburg host Dortmund at the Volkswagen Arena having finished goalless in their last two games, a problem Borussia do not have after demolishing Legia Warsaw and Darmstadt by the same 6-0 scoreline in their last two matches. Gomez, who netted two goals for Germany in June's European championships, will be looking to take a leaf out of Dortmund's book having failed to score in his two league appearances since joining Wolfsburg for seven million euros ($7.8m) from Fiorentina in August to great fanfare. The 31-year-old missed a handful of chances in Saturday's goalless draw at Hoffenheim, leaving his new team on five points from a possible nine this season. ""I'm sorry for the team that I haven't scored,"" said Gomez, the Turkish league's top-scorer last season with 26 goals on loan at Besiktas. ""It was one of those days when the (Hoffenheim) goalkeeper saved everything. ""It's clear that I have to score at least once, but the goals will come and the next game is a good chance for that. Borussia Dortmund haven't won the game yet."" Both teams are in the top half of the table with Dortmund a point above Wolves on six points. Last time out, Dortmund blitzed Darmstadt despite leaving stars Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Mario Goetze out of their starting line-up. And head coach Thomas Tuchel has a selection headache with half a dozen highly-talented youngsters all vying for starting places against Wolfsburg. Amongst them is USA international Christian Pulisic, who scored against Darmstadt, only turned 18 on Sunday after making his Champions League debut in Warsaw. ""You can finally drive a car in Germany!"", said USA coach Jurgen Klinsmann in a video message to the attacking midfielder. ""We proud of you in the USA -- shoot a few more goals!"" Pulisic is typical of the talent Tuchel is nurturing. Both French rising star Ousmane Dembele, 18, and Portugal international Raphael Guerreiro, 22, are impressing on the left flank. Turkey international Emre Mor, 19, scored his first Bundesliga goal against Darmstadt. Right-back Felix Passlack only turned 18 in May and defensive midfielder Julian Weigl is a full Germany international -- at just 21. Tuchel, who has seen 10 different players score in their last two matches, may need his talented squad as Borussia have a busy week coming up with three games in seven days, including Friday's visit of Freiburg before hosting Real Madrid in the Champions League group stages Tuesday next week. But a strong bench and more rotation does not necessarily mean more league points, according to Tuchel. ""That would be too simple a calculation,"" he said. ""We shouldn't hanker after the 78 points we achieved (in the German league) last season."""
472,27/08/2016,18:08,Aubameyang nets twice as Dortmund win opener,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has resumed his duel with Robert Lewandowski to be the Bundesliga's top scorer by netting twice in Borussia Dortmund's 2-1 win over Mainz on the opening weekend of the new season.,"Aubameyang scored 25 German league goals last season, finishing second to Bayern Munich striker Lewandowski's 30 in the scorers' charts, and the duo look set to lead the way again in 2016/17. Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in Bayern's 6-0 rout of Werder Bremen on Friday and his Dortmund rival Aubameyang opened his account less than 24 hours later. The Gabon star headed in a 17th-minute opener and then added a late penalty before Japan striker Yoshinori Muto pulled one back at the death for the visitors. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel was without Marco Reus, who was watching on in the stands as he recovers from a groin injury, but he started with three summer signings in his line-up. He gave Bundesliga debuts to Spanish centre-back Marc Bartra, signed from Barcelona, and 19-year-old French winger Ousmane Dembele, brought in from Rennes, while ex-Bayern midfielder Sebastian Rode also started. Aubameyang was unmarked at the far post to head in the opener from a cross from the left by Germany winger Andre Schuerrle. He then doubled his tally on 89 minutes when Schuerrle was brought down in the area and the Gabon star converted the resulting penalty, before Muto set up a nervous ending with a header in the 92nd minute. ""As far as I know my team, I can only think that they wanted to show everything they can do, which made things a bit nervous and not too tidy in our structure and the way we found space,"" said Tuchel. ""Things were a bit tough, so it was a very laborious victory."" Bayern's rout of Bremen is cause for concern in Germany with German Football League (DFL) president Reinhard Rauball admitting the opening fixture of the season on Friday will have done little to sell the Bundesliga overseas. ""Bayern played some very good football, but I was shocked by how little resistance Werder Bremen offered,"" Rauball told German radio. ""No one can argue that the match was on a knife-edge, but I hope the millions of viewers were pleased with the goals and can take that as some compensation."" Elsewhere, VfL Wolfsburg also got off to a winning start on Saturday with a 2-0 victory at Augsburg. Star off-season signing, Germany striker Mario Gomez -- the Bundesliga's top scorer over the last decade -- was not included in the starting line-up as he regains his fitness after injury at Euro 2016. But his new team-mates picked up three points without him. Wolves took the lead when Dutch striker Bas Dost fired across the face of goal and new signing Daniel Didavi lashed home a shot from the edge of the area on 35 minutes. Swiss international left-back Ricardo Rodriguez then drove in a low free-kick on 89 minutes. Cologne enjoyed a 2-0 win at Darmstadt as Marcel Risse and Anthony Modeste both netted for the hosts. Hamburg were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Ingolstadt as US international Bobby Wood's fine opening goal for the hosts was cancelled out by a late finish from Austria international Lukas Hinterseer. Schalke 04 opened their season with a 1-0 defeat at 10-man Eintracht Frankfurt as captain Alex Meier scored the first-half winner. There was plenty of second-half drama as Meier had a penalty saved before the hosts were reduced to 10 men when their Jamaica international centre-back Michael Hector was sent off for hauling down Schalke's Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who was through on goal. Later Borussia Moenchengladbach beat Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 at home in a battle of two of Germany's Champions League representatives. Andre Hahn scored for Gladbach just before the half-time whistle, only for Finland's Joel Pohjanpalo to equalise on his debut on 79 minutes, before Lars Stindl hit the winner five minutes from time."
473,25/08/2016,03:24,New-look Dortmund resume Bayern pursuit,Last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund resume the chase to knock Bayern Munich from the top of the German league having made eight new signings -- and losing a trio of stars.,"Dortmund start their campaign at home to coach Thomas Tuchel's ex-club Mainz on Saturday. But things looked bleak when captain Mats Hummels, then midfielder Ilkay Gundogan and Henrikh Mkhitaryan announced, one after the other, that they were leaving during the close season. But no other German club was as busy in the transfer market, with Dortmund quickly re-investing the 89.5 million euros ($100m) they made in selling Hummels to Bayern, Gundogan to Manchester City and Mkhitaryan to Manchester United. Bayern claimed a fourth straight German league title last season, finishing ten points clear of Dortmund, whose points haul of 78 would have given them the title in 49 of the 53 Bundesliga seasons to date. Ottmar Hitzfeld, who coached both Bayern and Dortmund during his career, expects Tuchel's Borussia to give the Bavarians a run for their money again this season. Both Bayern and Dortmund have qualified directly for the Champions League this season. ""I hope that Bayern won't single-handedly win the title,"" Hitzfeld told German radio. ""I am convinced: Dortmund will be serious competitors, they are chasing Bayern and have made very wise transfers."" The new signings include Germany forwards Andre Schuerrle and Mario Goetze, back at Dortmund after three years at Bayern where the World Cup winner was either blighted by injury or left on the bench by ex-Munich coach Pep Guardiola. ""I certainly didn't have easy year at Bayern. I want to play as many matches as possible here, to get the most out of myself, and help the team,"" said Goetze on his Dortmund return. Having won the 2011 and 2012 Bundesliga titles with Dortmund, Goetze will be back in the black and yellow shirt with a point to prove. ""I believe the problem actually was that he wanted to work with Pep Guardiola more than go to the club (Bayern Munich) itself,"" Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke told Sport1 when asked about Goetze's Bayern sojourn. Likewise, Schuerrle failed to win regular-starting places at either Chelsea, then Wolfsburg, for whom he scored nine goals in 14 league games at the end of last season. Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc said both Schuerrle and Goetze have the same task. ""At the end of the day, it's all about one thing for both of them: performances, performances, performances,"" Zorc told magazine Kicker. ""Neither Mario nor Andre have had top years, both aren't on an easy path and it's clear their performances will be in focus."" Barcelona centre-back Marc Bartra and left-back Raphael Guerrerio, who won the Euro 2016 title with Portugal, will bolster the defence, while tough-tackling midfielder Sebastian Rode has been recruited from Bayern. French teenager Ousmane Dembele is an exciting prospect on the wing, as is Turkey international Emre Mor, who is also still only 19. Spain Under-19 international Mikel Merino has also been bought from Osasuna. At the helm last season, Tuchel was a resounding success as head coach after replacing Jurgen Klopp. He overhauled the way Dortmund train, such as making defenders hold tennis balls in their hands during drills to break the habit of clutching an attacker's shirt. Meanwhile, Dortmund's attack yielded 82 league goals last season, two more than even Bayern. Central to this season's title challenge will be Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who scored 25 goals in 2015-16. Dortmund can expect near-fanatical support from the famous south terrace, which holds more than 20,000 home fans, and for the first time, Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park enjoyed an average attendance of over 80,000 for Bundesliga games last season. Their second league game, at RB Leipzig in a fortnight, means one of Germany's most traditional clubs will be the first to visit the fledgling outfit, heavily sponsored by energy drink manufacturer Red Bull, in Bundesliga history."
474,24/08/2016,12:46,Dortmund beat Bayern to sign Dembele - CEO,"Borussia Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke claims they beat Bayern Munich to sign French starlet Ousmane Dembele, but admits it will be harder to halt the Bavarians bid for a fifth straight German league title.","The new German league season starts on Friday with Bayern, under new head coach Carlo Ancelotti, hosting Werder Bremen at Munich's Allianz Arena while Dortmund start their Bundesliga season on Saturday at home to Mainz. Winger Dembele was voted France's Young Player of the Year last season and Dortmund paid Stade Rennes 15 million euros ($16.9m) in the off season, beating Bayern to the 19-year-old's signature. ""At that moment, we were quicker (than Bayern), but I don't know how deep their interest was,"" Watzke told Sport1. ""We got to him early and discovered him before he had played in the (French) league. ""He is an exceptional talent, but there is more to it than that, he has to learn the language and assimilate."" The France Under-21 international only made his French league debut for Rennes last season, but he announced himself with a superb goal for Dortmund in their 4-1 win over Manchester United during last month's tour of China. Bayern have won the German league title for each of the last four seasons since Dortmund took the 2011 and 2012 titles. But having signed Dortmund captain Mats Hummels and Portugal midfielder Renato Sanches, the Bavarians are again clear favourites for the 2016/17 league crown with Ancelotti having replaced Pep Guardiola as head coach. ""They (Bayern) have established themselves on the same level as Real Madrid, so it would be rubbish to say we'll attack Bayern,"" said Watzke. ""You can only attack when the opponent has a weak period."" Dortmund have made eight new signings, including Dembele plus Germany forwards Andre Schuerrle and Mario Goetze. Germany's World Cup winner is back in the black and yellow shirt after three frustrating years at Bayern, when the World Cup winner was either injured or left on the bench by ex-Munich coach Pep Guardiola. Watzke says he believes Goetze, who came up through Dortmund's youth academy, went to Bayern for the wrong reasons, especially as Guardiola had wanted to sign Brazil star Neymar, but eventually brought Barcelona's Thiago Alcantara to Munich. ""I believe the problem actually was that he (Goetze) wanted to work with Pep Guardiola more than to the club (Bayern Munich) itself,"" said Watzke. ""Then he realised that Guardiola had wanted to sign Neymar, that was where the misunderstanding lay."""
475,24/08/2016,03:27,Five major transfers to Germany for 2016-17,"Ahead of the start of the 2016-17 Bundesliga season on Friday, AFP Sports takes a look at the five biggest incoming transfers of the close season in Germany:","Barcelona (ESP) to Hamburg, five million euros ($5.6m) Halilovic was 16 when he made his professional debut for Dinamo Zagreb and having been billed as Croatia's 'next big thing', he was snapped up by Barcelona in May 2014. The attacking midfielder scored four goals in 29 matches for Barcelona B over the course of the 2014-15 campaign, but made just one Copa del Rey appearance for the first team. On loan at Sporting Gijon, his injection of class meant he made 36 appearances in 2015-16, netting three goals and five assists to earn the the nickname 'Guajlilovic', a play on 'El Guaje' (the Kid). The 20-year-old missed out on a place in Croatia's Euro 2016 squad, but scored his first goal for Hamburg in their 1-0 win at Zwickau on Monday in the German Cup -- eight minutes after coming off the bench. ""That I scored with my first chance is really great. I hope that more goals will follow,"" he said after his debut in the Cup's first round. Rennes (FRA) to Borussia Dortmund, a reported 15 million euros The 18-year-old winger joined Rennes as a 13-year-old in 2010 and only made his French league debut last November, but is already one of France's brightest talents. He has said his dream is to play for Barcelona and last season he scored 12 goals in 26 French league games, including a hat-trick in the derby against Nantes last March. Dembele was named France's Young Player of the Year for 2015-16 and can play on either wing. He announced himself for Dortmund with a stunning goal in a 4-1 win against Manchester United on their tour of China last month. ""Dembele uses both his feet and has great dribbling skills. He can do anything,"" said Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel. Benfica (POR) to Bayern Munich, 35 million euros The 19-year-old defensive midfielder is already a European champion having helped Portugal win the Euro 2016 title. Despite standing a modest 1.76m, he has plenty of pace and power and has completed a meteoric rise in the past 12 months. He netted his first goal for Benfica last December, then made his Portugal debut in a 2-1 defeat to Bulgaria in March. At 18 years and 328 days, he broke Cristiano Ronaldo's record as the youngest player to appear in a European Championship final and picked up the award for the Young Player of the tournament. Having signed for Bayern in May, his future employers were pleased to have tied him down to a five-year deal before his breakthrough in France. ""He has extraordinary talents. Bayern would not have been able to afford him had we tried to sign him after the Euros,"" said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Fiorentina (ITA) to VfL Wolfsburg, reportedly seven million euros After three years spent abroad, the Bundesliga's most prolific striker in the last ten years is back in Germany. Since the 2006-07 season, Gomez has scored 132 goals in 197 German league games making him the Bundesliga's top scorer over the last decade. Gomez has adapted his game and proved he can create chances as well as finish them when his crisp cross led to Mesut Ozil's goal in the quarter-finals of Euro 2016. He won the 2007 Bundesliga title with Stuttgart before signing for Bayern Munich for a then-record 30 million euros in 2009 and was the league's top scorer with 28 goals in 2010-11. He lost his place in the 2012-13 season, when Bayern won the treble, and a move to Fiorentina backfired, as he scored just seven times in two seasons in Italy and was left out of Germany's triumphant 2014 World Cup squad. But a reinvigorating loan spell at Besiktas saw him finish as the Turkish league's top scorer last season with 26 goals in 33 appearances. His aim for the 2016-17 season is to get Wolfsburg back in the Champions League. ""The team and I both share the same hunger to be successful,"" he said. Barcelona (ESP) to Borussia Dortmund for eight million euros Bartra made his Barcelona debut under Pep Guardiola in February 2010 and has won the Champions League twice, the Spanish league title five times and the Club World Cup. But having made just 59 appearances in seven seasons at Barcelona, his best spell the 2013-14 campaign when he played 20 times in Spain's top flight, he found himself relegated to third or fourth-choice centre-back under Luis Enrique. His quest for regular first-team football has brought him to Germany and with Carles Puyol as his agent, he has a Spanish legend in his corner. Bartra has plenty of pace and is known for his smooth passing. He is good in the air and can also play at right-back, providing Thomas Tuchel with plenty of options."
476,23/08/2016,12:50,Germany's Schuerrle suffers KO on Dortmund start,"Germany winger Andre Schuerrle has revealed how he was first poleaxed, then needed stitches for a chin wound having scored on his first competitive start for Borussia Dortmund.","Schuerrle, whose cross saw Mario Goetze score the winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final, started his first game for Borussia on Monday in a 3-0 German Cup first-round win at Eintracht Trier, following his 30 million euro ($34 million) transfer from Wolfsburg. After Japan winger Shinji Kagawa netted twice at Trier, Schuerrle volleyed home Borussia's third goal against the fourth-division minnows, only to be later floored by a collision with Trier's goalkeeper Chris Keilmann in the 53rd minute. Dortmund's medical staff used oxygen to revive him and he had four metal tacks inserted for a chin wound, while still on the pitch, before being taken off. ""It's a cut, I was tacked four times. I was a bit dizzy, so it was also good that I was taken off,"" Schuerrle told German broadcaster ARD. ""I have never experienced anything like that before. I was my first competitive match (for Dortmund) and first of all I was knocked out, then I could hardly walk."" Schuerrle soon saw the funny side and shared a joke with Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel on the sidelines. ""I told him: we saved him from a third accident. We relieved him (from further danger),"" joked Tuchel. Schuerrle hopes to be fit when Dortmund, last season's Bundesliga runners-up, play their first German league game of the new season on Saturday at home to Mainz with a sell-out crowd of 80,000 expected."
477,16/08/2016,12:10,Germany star Reus finally passes driving test,Germany winger Marco Reus -- who was fined half a million euros in 2014 after it emerged he had been driving for years without a licence -- has finally passed his test.,"The 27-year-old sat out June's European championships with a groin injury as Germany lost to France in the semi-finals, but used his time in the off-season to swot up on his skills behind the wheel and prepare for the theory test. ""Yes, it's true that I've passed my driving test. I am pleased that this chapter is now closed,"" the Borussia Dortmund star told German daily Bild. Reus, who has won 29 caps for Germany, passed his theory and practical parts of the test on Monday and picked up his brand-new licence on the way to training on Tuesday. Reus hit the headlines in November 2014 when it emerged he had been driving for years without a valid licence. Due to his high salary, he was fined 540,000 euros ($607,859) by the district court in Dortmund after he had submitted a fake Dutch driving licence when routinely stopped by police. ""I had unfortunately decided to take this path (driving without a licence) and to this day I can't even understand myself why I did that,"" he said in 2014, after also missing the last World Cup with injury. Having sat out Borussia's 2-0 defeat at home to Bayern Munich in the German Super Cup on Sunday, Reus is expected to return to Dortmund training soon, but is set to miss their opening German league match at home to Mainz on August 27. Dortmund are back in the Champions League this season after a year's absence after finishing second to Bayern in the Bundesliga last season."
478,14/08/2016,22:35,Bayern clinch Super Cup on Ancelotti debut,Carlo Ancelotti claimed his first title as Bayern Munich coach on Sunday as a 2-0 victory at Borussia Dortmund gave last season's double winners the German Super Cup.,"The 57-year-old has succeeded Pep Guardiola, who won seven titles in three years as Bayern coach, and Ancelotti made a flying start on his first competitive match with Munich. This was the 18th title of the Italian's coaching career after stints at Juventus, AC Milan, Chelsea, Paris St-Germain and Real Madrid. Ancelotti has broken Bayern's run of four straight defeats to claim their first German Super Cup title since 2012 -- a trophy Guardiola never won with Munich. After Vidal's opening goal, early in the second-half, Thomas Mueller, who failed to score for Germany at last month's European championships, grabbed the second. With less than a fortnight to go until Bayern open the new Bundesliga season at home to Werder Bremen on August 26, Munich will be chasing a fifth straight crown. This was the eighth time Bayern and Dortmund have met in a final in the last four years. Bayern have now won four of the showdowns, including May's German Cup final, which Munich won on penalties to sign off Guardiola's three-years with the league and cup double. There was plenty of added spice before kick-off at the sold-out Signal Iduna Park in front of 81,360 fans. Ex-Dortmund captain Mats Hummels made his first return in the Bayern shirt since his 35 million euros ($39m) transfer back to Munich. Likewise, Dortmund's new signings Ousmane Dembele, the 19-year-old French wonder winger from Stade Rennes, made his competitive debut along with ex-Barcelona centre-back Marc Bartra. But Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goezte spent the game on Dortmund's bench after rejoining Borussia following three frustrating years at Bayern. Both Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel and Ancelotti opted for a 4-1-4-1 formation. Tuchel used Dembele and Colombia's Adrian Ramos as wingers while Ancelotti opted for Franck Ribery on the left and Thomas Mueller on Bayern's right. There were five yellow cards in the first 45 minutes in a highly-charged opening half. Dortmund dominated the early stages with both Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Dembele going close on two occasions each, keeping Bayern's Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer busy. Bayern's best chance came on 38 minutes when Javi Martinez's superb cross allowed Vidal a bullet header, but Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki got his glove to the ball. But the live-wire Chile international was not to be denied after the break. Robert Lewandowski's pass found Vidal in space and although his first shot from outside the box was blocked, he drilled home the rebound on 58 minutes. Mueller made the result safe when Hummels rose highest at a corner and his Germany team-mate was on hand to tap his shot past Burki on 79 minutes."
479,13/08/2016,02:30,"Bayern, Dortmund in Super Cup showdown",Borussia Dortmund host champions Bayern Munich for the German Super Cup on Sunday with Mats Hummels and Mario Goetze set to be scrutinised following high-profile returns to each rival team.,"The showdown between German league and cup champions Bayern and last season's runners-up Dortmund, who finished second to the Bavarians in both competitions, has plenty of added spice a fortnight before the start of the Bundesliga season. Germany centre-back Hummels, Dortmund's captain last season, can expect an uncomfortable return to Borussia's sold-out Signal Iduna Park having signed a five-year deal in May to rejoin Bayern, the club he left in 2008. ""There will certainly be some people who won't give me a warm welcome,"" admits Hummels. ""It's understandable, but I will always cherish my time there, even if I am booed there for the next 15 times in a row."" Hummels expects ""very loud background noise"" and failed to help matters by admitting he moved to Bayern to join ""one of the three best teams in the world"" -- something Dortmund can not claim to be. But Bayern striker Thomas Mueller says Dortmund fans should not whistle Hummels, who helped the team to the 2011 and 2012 league titles, making 225 league appearances. ""Mats doesn't give the impression that he's scared and whether he is welcomed or jeered won't influence us,"" said Mueller. ""Any boos would be ridiculous, as far as I am concerned. Mats was a leading figure in a lot of success for Dortmund, they could show a bit of gratitude."" Likewise, Goetze will have a point to prove in his first competitive game back in the black and yellow Dortmund shirt after three frustrating seasons at Bayern, spent mainly on the bench or injured. ""When the interest from Borussia Dortmund came, I quickly decided to return,"" said Germany's World Cup-winner, a product of the Dortmund academy. ""Now begins a new chapter for me. I really want to play my best football again and to reply to each and every critic with my performances."" Dortmund have won the Super Cup five times, Bayern on four occasions, and Mueller says the Bavarians are eager to get their hands on the trophy after defeats on their last three attempts. Borussia will return to the Champions League this season after a year's absence and have splashed out a reported 109.8 million euros ($122.6m) on eight new signings. Having sold Hummels to Bayern, Ilkay Gundogan to Manchester City and Henrikh Mkhitaryan to Manchester United, Dortmund spent big. They have recruited Goetze, Germany winger Andre Schuerrle, Barcelona defender Marc Bartra, Portugal defender Raphael Guerreiro and exciting teenage French winger Ousmane Dembele amongst others. Dortmund lost their last pre-season friendly 1-0 to Athletico Bilbao in Switzerland on Tuesday. The defeat prompted coach Thomas Tuchel to ask fans ""not to expect too much from Sunday"", but the hosts will want to win their third German Super Cup title in four years. Bayern will not be at full strength, missing injured stars Jerome Boateng, new-signing Renato Sanches and Arjen Robben as Carlo Ancelotti bids for his first trophy since succeeding Pep Guardiola as head coach. ""This is a title we haven't won for three years and it's always special against Borussia Dortmund, for us and the fans,"" said Mueller. ""This is about prestige."""
480,11/08/2016,17:56,Mueller eager to end Bayern's Super Cup drought,Thomas Mueller says Bayern Munich are desperate to end their German Super Cup drought against Borussia Dortmund on Sunday after three years without getting their hands on the trophy.,"The German champions have lost the last three Super Cup showdowns, when the best two teams in Germany go head-to-head, and they face last season's Bundesliga runners-up Dortmund at Borussia's sold-out Signal Iduna Park stadium. Mueller scored what proved to be the winner when Bayern last won the title at Munich's Allianz Arena in August 2012 with a 2-1 win over Dortmund. Since then, Bayern have lost their last three attempts to win the trophy, losing 4-2 at Dortmund in 2013, 2-0 to Dortmund again in 2014 and lost a penalty shoot-out at Wolfsburg last year after it finished 1-1 after extra time. With Carlo Ancelotti succeeding Pep Guardiola as head coach, Bayern will be missing injured stars Jerome Boateng, new-signing Renato Sanches and Arjen Robben, but Mueller is relishing the clash. ""We never go into any game saying 'we don't care': this is about a title and prestige, even if the Super Cup, directly at the start of a season, doesn't have the same worth as a league or cup title,"" said Mueller in Thursday's press conference. ""This is a title we haven't won for three years and it's always special against Borussia Dortmund, for us and the fans. ""It's more fun that just playing a meaningless friendly."" After four weeks of holidays since the semi-finals of Euro 2016, Mueller says he has no concerns about his goal drought in France, when he failed to score in six matches at the European championships. ""These things happen sometimes in sport,"" said the 26-year-old, who scored 20 Bundesliga goals last season and 32 in all competitions. ""From my perspective, I gave everything, so of course I am not happy about the way the summer went, but it's not going to throw me off the rails. ""I am very relaxed and am really looking forward to the season."""
481,10/08/2016,13:31,Dortmund suffer Bilbao defeat in Bayern warm-up,Borussia Dortmund boss Thomas Tuchel admitted there was 'room for improvement' after his team lost 1-0 to Athletic Bilbao in their German Super Cup warm-up before facing Bayern Munich.,"Bundesliga champions Bayern, under new head coach Carlo Ancelotti, are Dortmund's next opponents at Signal Iduna Park on Sunday for the German Super Cup in the traditional pre-season opener. But Tuchel's experimental 4-1-4-1 formation failed to break the Bilbao defence, despite fielding an attack boasting Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Japan's Shinji Kagawa, plus new signings, Germany forwards Mario Goetze and Andre Schuerrle. ""There is a lot of room for improvement, when we analyse the game, we'd do well not to expect too much for Sunday,"" admitted Tuchel after Tuesday's defeat in St Gallen, Switzerland. ""We were very tired and didn't manage to put into effect the things we have planned. ""I have the feeling that although we want to, we are not in a position to put in a top performance after an intense training camp. ""There is no question we can do better."" Dortmund put out a statement after the Bilbao defeat to say Germany winger Marco Reus is on course to return to training in mid-August from the groin injury which ruled him out of Euro 2016. Tuchel had said that timeframe was ""impossible"" and that he would be ""extremely surprised"" if Reus can train again in the coming weeks, but Borussia's medical staff and director of sport Michael Zorc have confirmed the winger is expected back soon. After the Super cup showdown, Dortmund play fourth division side Eintracht Trier in the first round of the German Cup on August 22. That will be their last match before the new Bundesliga starts when they host Mainz on August 27 and have qualified directly for this season's Champions League after a year's absence."
482,07/08/2016,16:26,Hummels set for Dortmund jeers on Bayern Bundesliga bow,Mats Hummels expects to run a gauntlet of boos and whistles next Sunday on his first game back in the Bayern Munich shirt -- away to his ex-club Borussia Dortmund.,"The 27-year-old Germany defender, a product of the Bayern academy, signed for Dortmund in 2008, but has rejoined the Munich giants after eight years at their Bundesliga rivals. Now his first competitive appearance back in the Bayern shirt will be at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park stadium on August 14 for the German Super Cup. Having made his Germany debut, won the 2014 World Cup and back-to-back Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012 as a Dortmund player, Hummels returned to Bayern in a deal worth 35 million euros ($38.8m). Shortly after, Hummels made his final appearance for Dortmund last May against Bayern when Borussia lost the German Cup final on penalties in Berlin. And he expects a few boos and whistles from home fans in Dortmund. ""There are a few people who won't receive me well, but I am looking forward to returning,"" he admitted. ""And if the next 15 games I'm booed mercilessly, it won't change my attitude and it won't affect my performance. ""The boos from the Dortmund fans will come but it won't change my appreciation (of the club). The game will be very special for me. ""The decision to move took a lot of strength and gave me a headache for a few weeks. It was a long and difficult process. ""Dortmund and Bayern are the only clubs I've played for, but Bayern are one of the top three teams in the world and have the chance to win everything every year. ""In the end, that was the decisive factor."" Dortmund has finished second to Bayern in three of the last four seasons with Munich bidding for a fifth straight German league title this year with Carlo Ancelotti taking charge. Also in the German Super Cup, Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze will be lining up for Dortmund again after three frustrating years at Bayern under Pep Guardiola. The 24-year-old has moved in the opposite direction to Hummels by signing a four-year contract for Borussia."
483,01/08/2016,17:09,"Blaszczykowski joins Wolfsburg, scare for Guilavogui","Poland's Jakub Blaszczykowski became the sixth new signing for Bundesliga side Wolfsburg on Monday, whose French midfielder Josuha Guilavogui had a brush with a serious neck injury.","The French midfielder fractured a vertebrae after a collision in the second half of a 2-1 friendly defeat at Sporting Lisbon on Saturday night and a scan revealed the extent of the injury. The 25-year-old was able to travel with the German club back to Wolfsburg on Sunday wearing a neck brace and will undergo treatment. There is no prognosis of when the defensive midfielder will be able to play again, ahead of Wolfsburg's first league game of the season at Augsburg on August 27. ""The doctors say I have a blessing in disguise, no one was to blame, it was just an unfortunate situation,"" said Guilavogui. ""Now I hope the healing process goes well and I can recover as quickly as possible."" As Guilavogui starts his recovery, Blaszczykowski, 30, has become Wolfsburg's sixth summer signing after joining from Borussia Dortmund. He joins forwards Borja Mayoral, Daniel Didavi, Josip Brekalo, midfielder Yannick Gerhardt and centre-back Jeffrey Bruma in moving to Wolfsburg. According to SID, an AFP subsidiary, the transfer is worth four million euros ($4.5m) for the winger who has signed a two-year deal, after picking up Bundesliga winner's medals with in 2011 and 2012, the year Dortmund won the league and cup double. ""Jakub Blaszczykowski is a player that can do any team good, because he is a prime example of determination, willingness and passion, who always identifies with his clubs 100 percent,"" said Wolfsburg director of sport Klaus Allofs. Blaszczykowski, who spent last season on loan at Fiorentina, will replace Germany forward Andre Schuerrle, who has joined his former club Dortmund."
484,01/08/2016,15:49,'Let's go' - Goezte returns to Dortmund,Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze relished his return to Borussia Dortmund's pre-season training on Monday for the first time after three barren years at Bayern Munich.,"Alongside fellow new signings Andre Schuerrle and Raphael Guerreiro, Goetze was put through his paces with a series of fitness tests at Bochum University by Borussia's backroom staff. The trio joined a group of six players returning from their holidays after international duty including Poland's Lukasz Piszczek, Julian Weigl and South Korean Park Joo-Ho. ""Finally, let's go,"" wrote Goezte on his Twitter account under a picture of the Germany star on a treadmill. His first training session with the full Dortmund squad takes place on Wednesday with Borussia to host his former club Bayern for the German Super Cup on August 14. Goezte left Dortmund for arch-rivals Bayern at the end of the 2012/13 season and lived up to his billing as a rising Germany star by volleying home Schuerrle's cross in extra-time for the winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final against Argentina. But he has endured three unproductive years at Bayern, mainly spent on the bench or injured, having failed to impress coach Pep Guardiola or hold down a first-team place, despite collecting three back-to-back Bundesliga winner's medals. Having paid 37 million euros ($41.31m) for Goetze in 2013, Bayern sold him back to Dortmund for 26 million last month and the 24-year-old has plenty to prove again in the black and yellow shirt. Likewise, Schuerrle needs some good performances after 18 months at Wolfsburg, having failed to impress on his return from an unsuccessful spell at Chelsea, and has been signed by Dortmund for around 30 million euros. ""At the end of the day, it's primarily about one thing for both of them: performance, performance, performance,"" Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc told Kicker magazine. ""Neither Mario nor Andre have had top years behind them and they have not taken the easy path. ""For them, it's clear that they will be scrutinised in the public eye."" Having come up through Dortmund's academy, only to turn his back to join Bayern, Goetze could encounter some hostility from Dortmund's fans, at least initially. ""If some people feel compelled to boo him, they should do it,"" Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said on the subject of Goetze's return, with their first game of the league season at home to Mainz on August 27. ""We have a democracy. But I'll react like an allergy when someone is personally insulted. ""That doesn't do anyone any good."" Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel says his goal is to see Goetze 'laugh again' with good performances, after scowling his way through the last few months in Munich. Tuchel has also added Portugal left-back Guerreiro, midfielder Sebastian Rode, former Barcelona defender Marc Bartra and exciting teenage striker Ousmane Dembele. Schuerrle is a direct replacement for Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who has left to join Manchester United, as Dortmund try to end Bayern's four-year stranglehold on the Bundesliga title with Carlo Ancelotti now in charge of the Munich giants."

""Today you don't have time to rest. I don't know if we are going to kill our players but the schedule is the schedule. We start in two weeks. But I saw what I wanted to see [tonight] - we are aggressive and we want the ball."" City won - and finally got the workout Guardiola had craved - thanks to a 6-5 penalty shootout win over Dortmund, after the game ended one apiece. Guardiola admitted City were still a work in progress with just two pre-season games completed so far. ""I don't want to complain but I would like to have more time,"" said Guardiola. ""But we have to adapt. Today we played one of the best teams in Europe - they are so strong. There are many things to improve."" A tap-in from Sergio Aguero for City on 79 minutes was cancelled out after Christian Pulisic fired one home for Dortmund, through a crowded box, with six minutes of added time gone. City keeper Angus Gunn was the hero of penalties with three saves, including the one sealing their victory when he palmed away Mikel Merino's attempt. It was a lively enough affair in front of a crowd of around 32,000 at the Shenzhen Universiade Stadium and saw both managers draw deep on their substitutes benches as time wore on. Robbed of the chance for a derby against rivals Manchester United by rain and a ropey pitch on Monday, City's Spanish manager had been desperate to get some game time into his squad before their tour of China was over. On Thursday the weather gods were kinder, with temperatures dropping slightly. He gave Oleksandr Zinchenko, Tosin Adarabioyo and Kelechi Iheanacho starts and the chance to impress their new boss, while Guardiola's opposite number Thomas Tuchel continued to blood his new recruits also as he had in their 4-1 win over Manchester United in the tournament's opening match in Shanghai last Friday. Teenagers Ousmane Dembele (19) and Emre Mor (18) both started, alongside Marc Bartra, Dortmund's off-season capture from Barcelona. In all there were six new faces from the starting XI against United as Tuchel looked to put miles into legs. But the goals came late and Tuchel could be excused if he thought life was unfair, given the chances his side had been presented with, and the opportunity - missed - to complete a double over both shades of Manchester."

The two European heavyweights might be in China, half a world away from where they usually ply their trade, but that has not stopped the transfer rumour mill from grinding away back home. Reports stemming from Europe of a host of players coming in and out of both clubs have been mostly dismissed by officials, who are trying instead to focus players' attention on preparations ahead of domestic seasons that kick off next month. Tuchel was responding to reports from Germany -- which have been denied -- that Dortmund's 27-year-old Gambonese star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang might soon be on his way out. Media have suggested he could be heading to Manchester City or Real Madrid. ""Right now he is our player, he stays our player,"" said Tuchel. ""He is a huge personality for us."" Fresh from a breakout season of 39 goals in all competitions for Dortmund, Aubameyang scored against Manchester United in his club's 4-1 win in Shanghai last Friday. He has since flown back to Germany to spend time with his wife before she gives birth. Aubameyang said he was misquoted in a report saying he had a desire to leave Dortmund and opt for Spanish giants Real. ""There is no deal with Madrid. The only thing I said is that I promised my grandad I would play there some day, nothing more,"" he told the BeIN Sports network. Dortmund, last season's Bundesliga runners up, have also been linked to Liverpool star Moussa Sissoko, though those reports have not been confirmed. Manchester City has said they have no official response to reports they are about to push their off-season spending spree over the 100 million British pound ($130 million) mark. Everton's John Stones is the latest player reported to be ""on the verge"" of joining the Sky Blues before the English Premier League season kicks off next month. Others apparently in the mix include German winger Leroy Sane, Colombian forward Marlos Moreno and 19-year-old Brazilian striker Gabriel Jesus. Tuchel is hoping some time away from home might help his players keep level heads despite all the off-season madness floating around. ""If you stand in front of a hotel, like we did in Shanghai, and you meet a guy who tells you he travelled 26 hours just to come there to stand there for 24 hours in front of our hotel, it changes something in you,"" said Tuchel. ""It keeps your feet on the ground."""

The only thing I said is that I promised my grandad I would play there some day, nothing more,"" he told the BeIN Sports network. Dortmund, last season's Bundesliga runners up, have also been linked to Liverpool star Moussa Sissoko, though those reports have not been confirmed. Manchester City has said they have no official response to reports they are about to push their off-season spending spree over the 100 million British pound ($130 million) mark. Everton's John Stones is the latest player reported to be ""on the verge"" of joining the Sky Blues before the English Premier League season kicks off next month. Others apparently in the mix include German winger Leroy Sane, Colombian forward Marlos Moreno and 19-year-old Brazilian striker Gabriel Jesus. Tuchel is hoping some time away from home might help his players keep level heads despite all the off-season madness floating around. ""If you stand in front of a hotel, like we did in Shanghai, and you meet a guy who tells you he travelled 26 hours just to come there to stand there for 24 hours in front of our hotel, it changes something in you,"" said Tuchel. ""It keeps your feet on the ground."""
488,27/07/2016,18:28,Aubameyang targets titles with Dortmund,"Star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is targeting titles next season with Borussia Dortmund, who have spent 117 million euros ($128.5m) in making eight new signings, to break Bayern Munich's stranglehold in Germany.","Aubameyang, 27, has been linked to a bumper move to Pep Guardiola-led Manchester City, but poured more cold water on any speculation by saying he wants to win titles with Dortmund, where he has a contract until 2020. Bayern have won the Bundesliga title for the last four seasons in succession and face Dortmund for the German Super Cup title on August 14. Borussia, who finished second in Germany's top flight last season, have sold defender Mats Hummels to rivals Bayern Munich, while Ilkay Gundogan and Henrikh Mkhitaryan have joined Manchester City and United respectively. But Dortmund has signed Germany attacking midfielders Andre Schuerrle from Wolfsburg and Mario Goetze, who is back after three years with Bayern, as part of eight new additions. ""I want to win titles this season with Goetze and Schuerrle in the team,"" Aubameyang told magazine Sports Bild. ""Their transfers are spectacular, they will do us good and our potential is enormous. ""Our goal must be to win at least one title,"" added Africa's Footballer of the Year. The Gabon striker scored 39 goals in all competitions last season as Dortmund scored 82 times in Germany's top flight, two more than champions Bayern. Alongside World Cup winners Goetze and Schuerrle, Dortmund has added Marc Bartra from Barcelona, Sebastian Rode from Bayern, Emre Mor from Denmark's Nordsjaelland, Ousmane Dembele from Stade Rennes, Mikel Merino from Osasuna and Raphael Guerrerio from FC Orient. ""We have signed a lot of young players, but these are all guys with huge talent,"" said Aubameyang. ""The Dortmund way is the right way to win titles,"" added the striker."
489,26/07/2016,13:33,Dortmund dismiss City's Aubameyang interest,"Borussia Dortmund have dismissed reports Pep Guardiola's Manchester City are poised to offer at least £58 million (70m euros, $77m) for star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.","According to British media, City are in advanced talks with the Gabon international, who scored 39 goals for Dortmund in all competitions last season as they finished runners-up to Bayern Munich in Germany's top flight. ""All these rumours have already followed us this summer,"" Dortmund team manager Michael Zorc told German daily Bild. ""We can only repeat, as always, that he has a contract with us until 2020 and feels good at Borussia Dortmund -- as it should remain."" The 27-year-old though has made clear his wish to join Real Madrid, should he quit the Bundesliga. ""Dortmund is a fantastic club which has been decisive for my career,"" Aubameyang told German broadcaster ZDF. ""My Spanish grandfather always said that he wanted me to play in Spain one day and if that happens, it will be for Real Madrid. ""Before his death two years ago, I promised him that I would one day run out for Real and I am working hard to achieve that goal."" While Aubameyang insists he enjoys playing for Dortmund, he would ""immediately say yes"" to Real. Dortmund have lost a host of stars since last season with Henrikh Mkhitaryan joining Manchester United, Ilkay Gundogan leaving for City and Mats Hummels has left for Bundesliga rivals Bayern. But Dortmund have strengthened their squad with Germany midfielders Mario Goetze, who is back after three years in Munich, and Wolfsburg's Andre Schuerrle, plus Barcelona defender Marc Bartra. They have also added teenage talent Ousmane Dembele, 19, for 15 million euros from Stade Rennes and Turkey international Emre Mor, 18, for seven million euros from Nordsjaelland. ""Of course, we have an awful lot of quality in our attack, perhaps more than last year,"" added Zorc, after Dortmund netted 82 German league goals last season -- two more than champions Bayern."
490,25/07/2016,18:36,Dortmund out to break 'monsters' Bayern's hold,Borussia Dortmund defender Sokratis believes it's high time Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich were knocked from the top of the German league after four years with an iron grip on the title.,"Bayern have won the Bundesliga title for a record four consecutive seasons, but it is all change in Munich for 2016/17 with Carlo Ancelotti replacing Pep Guardiola as head coach while director of sport Matthias Sammer has resigned on health grounds. Dortmund, the last team other than Bayern to win the German league title, were Bundesliga champions back in 2011 and 2012, and have finished runners-up to the Bavarians in three of the last four seasons. Dortmund host Bayern in the German Super Cup on August 14 in the official season opener, but Sokratis says they want more titles than just that this season. ""Without Bayern, these monsters in the sporting sense, we would have long since been league or cup champions,"" Sokratis Papastathopoulos, who is known by his first name in Germany, told magazine Kicker. ""I am about to start my sixth season in the Bundesliga and have yet to win a title apart from the Super Cup. ""That annoys me. It's time to win a title."" The new league season in Germany begins on Friday August 26 when Bayern host Werder Bremen while Dortmund are home to Mainz the following day. Ancelotti has taken his squad on a three-match tour of the United States where they will face European giants AC Milan, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, albeit minus their Germany stars, still resting after the European Championship. While Bayern have boosted their squad by signing Dortmund defender Mats Hummels and midfielder Renato Sanches from Benfica, Borussia have also been busy in the transfer market. They have signed Germany internationals Mario Goetze, who returns to Dortmund after three years with Bayern, and Andre Schuerrle from Wolfsburg. Without either of their new recruits, Dortmund romped to a 4-1 win over Manchester United last Friday in Shanghai on their tour of China. New United manager Jose Mourinho compared Borussia to a ""Formula One"" racer while said his squad were like a less powerful ""Formula Three"" car. Coach Thomas Tuchel had already added Portugal defender Raphael Guerreiro and ex-Barcelona centre-back Marc Bartra. Dortmund have also invested in the future, signing French teenage forward Ousmane Dembele, who scored a superb individual goal against United, and 19-year-old Turkey international Emre Mor."
491,22/07/2016,17:51,Mourinho's United stunned 4-1 by Dortmund in China,New Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho saw his side get off to a poor start on their tour of China when they lost 4-1 to Borussia Dortmund on Friday.,"Temperatures of 35 Celsius (95 Farenheit) at the 8:00 pm kick-off time in Shanghai meant the International Champions Cup match was largely played at a pedestrian pace with frequent breaks to take on water. Mourinho did not include Wayne Rooney, opting to give his captain more time to get fit after only joining the squad earlier in the week after Euro 2016. Dortmund enjoyed the better of the early skirmishes and when they took the lead in the 19th minute the United defence had only themselves to blame. A long-range Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang free-kick was parried by inexperienced 23-year-old goalkeeper Sam Johnstone as it dipped in front of him. The reserve gloveman was forced into a quick double save by Ousmane Dembele's follow-up but Gonzalo Castro scrambled home at the third attempt from six yards. United's woe deepened when Aubameyang, who bagged 25 goals in 46 matches last season, doubled Dortmund's advantage from the penalty spot in the 35th minute after Antonio Valencia handled Castro's cross. Dortmund, playing the fifth match of their pre-season campaign, were much sharper than United who had just the single outing against Wigan before boarding the plane to China. ""I think after 10 minutes you could tell who started training one match and 10 days ago and who has had one month and four games,"" Mourinho told reporters after the match. ""This was Formula One against Formula Three, they are much sharper."" United's only chance of the first half fell to Jesse Lingard on the break, but his weak right-foot effort was easily snaffled by goalkeeper Roman Wiedenfeller. The second-half exploded into life in the 57th minute. Frenchman Dembele scored the goal of the night as the summer signing from Rennes turned Marcos Rojo inside-out before burying a right-foot shot into the corner for Dortmund's third. Two minutes later new midfielder signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan scored his first goal for United -- against his old employers -- when he slotted into an empty net after being set up unselfishly by Juan Mata. Mkhitaryan, who could have scored a couple more, shone brightest for Mourinho's undercooked side as the North Rhine-Westphalian giants sealed an emphatic win in spectacular style when Castro smashed home a stunner four minutes from time. ""It's been 10 days of work. People are really tired,"" said Mourinho. ""High quality opposition and the reality is we have six players still in Europe plus Rooney and (Chris Smalling) who are only training. ""That is eight not involved. Some others are not going to stay in the squad and it will be different than it is at the moment."" United wrap up their tour against Manchester City in Beijing on Monday."
492,22/07/2016,15:45,Dortmund sign Schurrle from Wolfsburg,"Borussia Dortmund have signed Germany international winger Andre Schurrle from Wolfsburg on a five-year deal, the two Bundesliga clubs announced on Friday.","Reports in Germany indicate Dortmund will pay around 30 million euros ($33 million) for the World Cup winner, which would make Schurrle the club's record signing. ""He has already amassed considerable international experience. His quality will be of great value for our team,"" said Dortmund's sporting director Michael Zorc. Schurrle, 25, has played 55 times for his country and becomes Dortmund's second major signing in as many days after Mario Goetze returned to his former club on Thursday following a frustrating three-year spell at Bayern Munich. Schurrle, who has scored 48 goals in 174 Bundesliga games, spent the past 18 months at Wolfsburg after he joined them from Chelsea in February 2014 for 32 million euros. He is Dortmund's eighth signing this close season as Thomas Tuchel looks to reinforce his side following the departures of Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Ilkay Gundogan and Mats Hummels."
493,21/07/2016,14:06,Goetze heads back to Dortmund,"Germany's World Cup winning goalscorer Mario Goetze has returned to Borussia Dortmund after a frustrating three seasons with Bayern Munich, the clubs announced Thursday.","The 24-year-old has never established himself with the German champions. The clubs did not give a transfer fee but Bild newspaper said Dortmund paid between 22 and 25 million euros ($24-27.5 million). That would mean Bayern have booked a loss of about 13 million euros on the price they paid for Goetze. Bayern president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge called the deal ""a good solution for all sides"". Goetze scored the winning goal in Germany's World Cup final triumph over Argentina in 2014. But under Pep Guardiola, he was often on the Bayern substitutes' bench. He was also often among the replacements for Germany at Euro 2016. Bayern's new coach Carlo Ancelotti had hinted in recent weeks that he has told Goetze to find a new club. Dortmund fans repeatedly jeered Goetze when he appeared for Bayern against his old team. The player said he now has ""a different view"" of his decision to move. ""I want to try to convince everyone with my performances, especially those who are welcoming me with open arms,"" he said. In recent weeks, Dortmund have lost defender Mats Hummels to Bayern, midfielder Henrich Mchitarjan to Manchester United and defender Ilkay Gundogan to Manchester City."
494,06/07/2016,16:56,Manchester United complete Mkhitaryan deal,"Manchester United have signed Henrikh Mkhitaryan from Borussia Dortmund, the Premier League giants announced on Wednesday.","Mkhitaryan, 27, has penned a four-year deal with United with the option to extend the contract for a further year, the club announced in a statement. ""I am very proud to join Manchester United, this move is a dream come true for me,"" Mkhitaryan told United's website after joining for a fee worth a reported £26 million ($34 million, 30 million euros). ""I am excited to play for a club with such an illustrious history and hope to be part of it for a long time,"" the Armenia playmaker added. ""I am thankful for the trust the club and Jose Mourinho have put in me. ""Finally, I believe playing for such a great club honours my father's memory, and the inspiration and drive he gave to me when I was young."" Mkhitaryan, whose father Hamlet was also a footballer, scored 41 goals in 140 appearances for Dortmund after joining them from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013. He is Armenia's most successful player and has scored a record 19 goals in 59 appearances for his country. Mkhitaryan is United's third pre-season signing and follows both Ivory Coast defender Eric Bailly and star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Old Trafford. ""Henrikh is a very talented footballer who has been in such prolific form for both his club and his country,"" said United manager Mourinho. ""He is a real team player with great skill, vision and also has a good eye for goal. I am delighted he has chosen to sign for United,"" the Portuguese added. ""I believe he will make an impact on the team very quickly as his style of play is suited to the Premier League. We are all looking forward to working with him."" United finished fifth in the Premier League last season, 15 points behind shock champions Leicester City, and failed to qualify for the Champions League. That prompted the club to sack Dutch manager Louis van Gaal and replace him with former Chelsea boss Mourinho."
495,02/07/2016,14:07,Mkhitaryan completes Man Utd move,"Armenian international Henrikh Mkhitaryan became Jose Mourinho's third signing of the close season for Manchester United on Saturday, the midfielder's German club Borussia Dortmund announced.","However, whilst Dortmund announced he was leaving it is believed he has yet to pass a medical and agree personal terms with United. The 27-year-old, who would join Ivory Coast defender Eric Bailly and veteran Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic as new faces at United, was given a curt farewell by Dortmund after ending his three-year stay in a deal worth around 42 million euros ($46.8 million). Dortmund chairman Hans-Joachim Watzke said he and the club were put in an unenviable position as Mkhitaryan had just a year left on his contract. ""Manchester made us an enormous offer. If we had rejected it, the player could have left for free in 2017,"" said Watzke. The official club statement did not mention the player by name as he followed German World Cup-winning defender and club captain Mats Hummels and midfielder Ilkay Gundogan in leaving the club this summer -- the former to arch-rivals Bayern Munich and the latter to join former Bayern coach Pep Guardiola at English side Manchester City. Dortmund fans have got used to the draining of their star names with the likes of Polish striker Robert Lewandowski and Mario Goetze leaving for Bayern among other big name departures in years gone by. ""After intensive discussions BVB have complied with the wishes of the Armenian national team player to join Manchester United,"" read the statement. Mkhitaryan, who cost Dortmund $33 million when they signed him from Ukrainian outfit Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, had a stellar season last term, scoring 23 goals and creating another 32 in all competitions, as Borussia finished runners-up to Bayern in Germany's top flight. But his agent confirmed at the beginning of last month they rejected Dortmund's attempts to extend his contract."
496,08/06/2016,03:20,Teenager Mor excites Turkey ahead of Euro 2016,"Emre Mor is just 18, has lived all his life in Denmark and only received Turkish citizenship this year after receiving authorisation from his jailed father.","Yet the fleet-footed winger, unknown to most Turkish football fans at the start of 2016, has in just weeks become one of the great hopes for Turkey at the European Championship finals. Mor's reputation grew again Tuesday when Borussia Dortmund signed him from Danish side Nordsjaelland. The teenager said he was ""very honoured and happy to be part of the Dortmund family and to play in one of the biggest clubs in the world."" The integration into the national side of Mor, who despite his Turkish parentage is far from fluent in the language, is a potent sign of the Turkey's increasing success in tapping the talents of the diaspora. Many in Turkey wistfully dream of a world-beating fantasy national side including Mesut Ozil of Arsenal and Ilkay Gundogan, newly signed with Manchester City, who both slipped through the net and play for Germany. But with the likes of Mor and Mannheim-born star Hakan Calhanoglu turning out for the Milli Takim, the trend is starting to turn. Mor, who had played for FC Nordsjaelland since 2015, appeared for Denmark's youth side but switched his allegiance this year following intervention by Turkey coach Fatih Terim. He made a single appearance for Turkey under 21s before making his full debut in a friendly against Montenegro, thrilling Turkish fans with quicksilver runs down the wing and virtuoso passing. Terim rewarded the youngster with a place in the Euro 2016 squad for France. ""The reason that Emre is here is that he is a player who is out of the ordinary,"" said Terim. He acknowledged there had been ""struggles behind the scenes"" over the change of citizenship. ""It was a difficult process but I think it was worth it."" Mor, a fan of social media, burst with national pride on Instagram over his debut. ""This is a special day and a unforgettable day for me. I love my country."" His name grew with the interest from across Europe, including Liverpool. Before Dortmund won the contest, Turkish fans had argued between themselves over which Istanbul club he should join and even his mum intervened to say he was a Galatasaray fan. ""We have never seen something like this before,"" said former Turkish international turned pundit Hakan Unsal. Inevitably reactions from Denmark, where Mor learnt his trade and played for Lyngby BK from 2006-2015, have been less enthusiastic. ""It is unfortunate that we lose such a player, because Denmark is a small country,"" Denmark coach Age Hareide admitted. ""We can't do very much about it. It is very much about the player's own feelings,"" he told Danish news agency Ritzau. Mor himself countered the feeling that he let down the country of his birth. ""Some will accept me for the person I am, some won't... ""Some accept my decision of choosing, to play for the Turkish national team, some don't,"" he wrote on Instagram, using the hashtag #hatersgonnahate. The road to international football has not always been easy for Mor, who grew up in Bronshoj, a working class area on the outskirts of Copenhagen. His father is serving a four-month jail sentence in Denmark for a driving offence and had to sign off on the papers for the citizenship from his cell. The player suffered a serious injury in 2013 while a plan to join French outfit Saint Etienne did not work out and his temperament has caused concern. Per Holm, Denmark's under-16 coach said Mor's temper and lack of patience could at one point have cost him his career. ""I think Lyngby at one point concluded that they were not quite able to handle him and that he had to go somewhere else if he were to be saved as a player,"" he told football magazine Tipsbladet in March. nsb-sjw/tw <org>GALATASARAY SPORTIF</org>"

Mor said on Instagram that he was ""very honoured and happy to be part of the Dortmund family and to play in one of the biggest clubs in the world."" The winger has lived all his life in Denmark and only received Turkish citizenship earlier this year, following intervention by Turkey coach Fatih Terim. ""It's great that we can attract talents with Emre's qualities to our academies, and then bring them on to the biggest clubs in Europe,"" FC Nordsjaelland sporting director Carsten Jensen said. ""This agreement will stand as the best in the club's history, and is obviously unique, because otherwise we would not have chosen to sell him before the European Championship finals."". The clubs agreed not to disclose the fee for Mor. Dortmund have made a flurry of signings in recent weeks, with Mor becoming the fifth new recruit over the summer."

Rode arrives at Dortmund after they swooped for France Under-21 winger Ousmane Dembele, Marc Bartra from Barcelona and Mikel Merino from Spanish side Osasuna. ""Since my childhood I have been a fan of Dortmund,"" Rode said. Dortmund, who were distant runners-up to Bayern in the season just gone, have lost two Germany stars after Mats Hummels' departure to Bayern was followed by Gundogan joining City for a reported £21m euros."

The club confirmed the transfer on their website. Dortmund have actioned a release clause in Bartra's Barca contract allowing him to leave for just eight million euros ($9m) having reportedly sold Hummels, 27, to Bayern Munich for 35 million. The 25-year-old Bartra is part of Spain's Euro 2016 squad and completed the medical check in Dortmund in the past few days. Bartra came through the ranks at the Camp Nou and was handed his top-team debut by Pep Guardiola in 2010, winning five Spanish league titles and the Champions League twice. With Argentina international Javier Mascherano, France's Jeremy Mathieu and Spain star Gerard Pique ahead of him in the pecking order at Barca, Bartra wants a fresh challenge. He found first-team football hard to come by under Luis Enrique in the season just finished as Barcelona won the double of La Liga and Copa del Rey. Bartra is Dortmund's second signing of the off-season after France Under-21 winger Ousmane Dembele, 18, from Rennes. Borussia have already sold two Germany stars in the off-season after Hummels' departure to Bayern was followed by Ilkay Gundogan joining Manchester City for a reported £21m euros."

The Catalan daily Sport said the 25-year-old Bartra, who is in Spain's Euro 2016 squad, will sign a five-year deal with the Bundesliga side. Bartra came through the ranks at the Camp Nou and was handed his top-team debut by Pep Guardiola in 2010. However, he found first-team football hard to come by under Luis Enrique in the season just finished as Barcelona won the double of La Liga and Copa del Rey.

With Gundogan gone, Dortmund must now turn their attention on getting Reus fit again and settle the future of Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Reus was cut from Germany's Euro 2016 squad on Tuesday -- the same day as his 27th birthday -- with an badly inflamed groin injury, which head coach Joachim Loew described as a ""massive health problem"". German media reports suggest he could be out for up to four months and has been seeking specialist treatment in the Netherlands. ""For Marco, this is all very bitter news,"" Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc told German daily Bild. ""Especially with his history before the 2014 World Cup (an ankle injury ruled him out) and we hope he will be completely healthy again."" But having seen captain Mats Hummels sign for Bayern ten days ago, Dortmund must ensure Mkhitaryan is not their third big-name star to leave in the off season. The Armenian international has had a stellar season, scoring 23 goals and creating another 32 in all competitions, as Borussia finished second only to Bayern in Germany's top flight. But his agent confirmed on Wednesday they have rejected Dortmund's attempts to extend his contract, which expires in June 2017, with both Arsenal and Chelsea eager to sign him. With Rode also set to join, Dortmund have already boosted their midfield options next season by signing France Under-21 winger Ousmane Dembele, 18, from Rennes."

Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke refused to comment on the situation with Mkhitaryan. The Armenian international has had a stellar season at Dortmund, scoring 23 goals and creating another 32 in all competitions, as Borussia finished second only to Bayern in Germany's top flight. The 27-year-old netted a hat-trick for Armenia on Sunday in their 7-1 victory over Guatemala, and had a hand in six of their goals, with their next international on Thursday against El Salvador. According to reports, Raiola wants a double exit clause put into Mkhitaryan's contract that he may leave if current coach Thomas Tuchel leaves or if there is an offer from a top club. Dortmund are in danger of having their squad picked apart. Top-scoring Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who hit 39 goals for the club last season, has reportedly told his national team coach Jorge Costa he will join another club for next season. Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City are all reportedly interested."

Both clubs had confirmed the deal on May 10, when Bayern splashed out a reported 73 million euros in one day by signing Hummels and Portugal teenager Renato Sanches from Benfica. Dortmund have made a fortune on the deal having originally paid Bayern four million euros for the World Cup winner back in 2008. ""We are pleased to welcome Mats back at Bayern,"" said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge in a statement. ""With his signing, we have not only a defender of world-class standing, but also a player who is not afraid to take responsibility and, moreover, comes from our academy."" Hummels is the third big-name Borussia player to leave for Bayern in the last three years after Mario Goetze (2013) and Robert Lewandowski (2014). Hummels had already completed his medical at Bayern, but held off on signing the deal in Munich until after Saturday's German Cup final when Bayern beat Dortmund 4-3 on penalties. ""The departure from Dortmund was, of course, very difficult for me, like in 2008 when I made my way in the other direction,"" he said. ""Now I'm just happy about everything that awaits me at Bayern."" After Dortmund lost their third German Cup final appearance in a row last Saturday, Hummels explained why he had waited so long to sign the Bayern deal. ""I did not want to fly to Munich again, shortly before the game against Munich. That just didn't feel good,"" he said."
505,20/05/2016,13:32,Gundogan set for several months out after knee operation,"Midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has undergone a successful knee operation, his club Borussia Dortmund announced Friday, with the German international expected to be out of action for several months.","The 25-year-old, who will miss this summer's European championships in France, dislocated his knee cap in training with Dortmund earlier this month. His current Borussia contract expires in June 2017, but he has been linked to a transfer to Manchester City to work with their incoming manager Pep Guardiola, after Gundogan's agent met City's director of sport Txiki Begiristain."
506,20/05/2016,02:15,Dortmund out to ruin Pep's final Bayern game,Borussia Dortmund aim to ruin Bayern Munich's plans to farewell Pep Guardiola with a seventh title in three years when Germany's top teams meet in Saturday's crunch German Cup final.,"Victory over their main rivals at Berlin's Olympic Stadium would give Bayern the league and cup double before Guardiola leaves for Manchester City next season. After Bayern lifted the Bundesliga title last weekend, for a record fourth season in succession, Dortmund now want the cup to compensate. ""We will do everything to win,"" promised Guardiola, who admits it will be tough against ""the best Borussia (team) in history"". Borussia finished 10 points behind Bayern in the league and want to avoid losing their third straight German Cup final. Dortmund controversially lost the 2014 final 2-0 to Bayern, after extra time, and were beaten 3-1 by Wolfsburg in last year's final. As midfielder Sven Bender put it, Dortmund has ""no desire to lose for a third time in succession in Berlin"". Bayern's captain Philipp Lahm says Guardiola has not only improved the quality of Bayern's football, but helped develop each member of the star-studded squad. Now Lahm says the squad must raise their game to win one last title before Carlo Ancelotti takes over as head coach next season. ""We have to improve, we weren't so impressive in our last few games,"" said Lahm. ""We are up for Berlin and we want the double to show that we have had a very good season."" There is plenty of spice in the Olympic Stadium showdown with a sell-out crowd of 74,322 expected. ""This is actually the best final that one can imagine in Germany,"" enthused World Cup-winning coach Joachim Loew. Mats Hummels will be playing his final game before becoming the third Borussia Dortmund star to join Bayern in the last three years, after Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski. The Dortmund captain expects a difficult afternoon: ""It's a strange feeling. Every mistake I make will be endlessly dissected."" The German league's top three strikers will be also be shooting it out. Top-scorer Lewandowski, the first foreigner to score 30 Bundesliga goals in a single season, will partner Bayern's Thomas Mueller, who netted 20 league goals. But Dortmund's Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who hit the net 25 times in the Bundesliga, has predicted he will score twice in the final. ""We don't see ourselves in the favourites' role, it is a final against a team who were up with us right until the end of the Bundesliga season,"" said Lahm. ""We know what's coming our way and that Dortmund will be a tough nut to crack."" In Germany, there is a tradition of the winning team toasting their victory with a 'beer shower', throwing over-sized glasses of beer over each other after the final whistle. But the German FA (DFB) has banned the celebrations, partly because the teams are sponsored by rival beer manufacturers, neither of which is a sponsor of the governing body. Dortmund thrashed Bayern 5-2 in the 2012 German Cup final and Bayern's star Franck Ribery wants no repeat of the debacle four years ago to risk dampening their party spirit. ""In 2012, we were second three times (in the Champions League final, the Bundesliga and German Cup final), that was a disaster for my holiday,"" joked the French winger. ""In 2013, we won the treble and that was a super holiday. ""We have a great chance and we should use it, as you never know what will happen next season."" Dortmund lost the 2014 final 2-0 in extra-time after they had been denied a goal -- headed by Hummels of all people -- in normal time and the Ruhr Valley club has clearly not forgotten. ""The last few finals against Bayern were decided by wrong decisions,"" said director of sport Michael Zorc. Bayern will be without injured winger Arjen Robben. Centre-back Javi Martínez is struggling with an ankle injury, while Xabi Alonso should be fit after recovering from bruised ribs. Dortmund are missing defensive midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, who is recovering from a dislocated knee, but winger Marco Reus should play after getting over a cold."

""That doesn't mean I will never take a penalty again."" Mueller was left with his head in his hands at the Allianz Arena after his first-half penalty attempt was crucially saved by Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak on May 3 with his side 1-0 up. Antoine Griezmann went on to score Atletico's important away goal in Munich, as Bayern exited the last four in Europe for the third year running, losing on away goals despite a 2-1 second-leg win. The German Cup final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium will see Germany's top teams go head-to-head and Mueller expects Dortmund to come out all guns blazing. ""They will certainly be waiting with the knives between their teeth for us,"" said Mueller. Dortmund took just one point from their last two league games after a 1-0 defeat at relegation-threatened Eintracht Frankfurt and a 2-2 draw at home to Cologne. But Mueller says recent form will count for nothing come kick-off in Berlin. ""It doesn't matter what came before, nothing is given away in a final,"" he said. The final will be Pep Guardiola's last game as Bayern coach after three years in charge, before he takes over at Manchester City next season. After winning a record fourth straight Bundesliga title, the Bavarian giants want to bid farewell to the Spaniard with the double. Dortmund captain Mats Hummels will play his final game in the black-and-yellow jersey before joining Bayern next season. ""I know this situation,"" said Bayern's Lewandowski, who himself left Dortmund for Munich two years ago. ""Even if you are mentally strong, it is still not easy. He will give 100 percent, that is for sure. ""I know Mats and he will show that he's still a Borussia Dortmund player and a professional. ""But it won't be easy for Borussia Dortmund."""

509,13/05/2016,02:10,Champions Bayern only set to get stronger,Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich will lift the Bundesliga trophy for an historic fourth consecutive time on Saturday -- with their rivals predicting they will get even stronger next season under Carlo Ancelotti.,"Bayern's home match against Hanover 96, who are already relegated, will be Guardiola's last at the Allianz Arena before he takes over at Manchester City next season. It promises to be a festive occasion in Munich and Guardiola will be a prime candidate for the traditional 'beer shower' when the Bayern squad are presented with over-sized glasses of beer to start the party after the final whistle. Under Guardiola, Bayern have dominated Germany's top flight over the last three seasons by starving their opponents of possession. His successor Ancelotti will inherit a star-studded squad which will be further boosted by new signings Germany defender Mats Hummels and 18-year-old Benfica midfielder Renato Sanches. Bayern splashed out a reported 73 million euros ($83 million) to sign the pair on Tuesday from Borussia Dortmund and Benfica respectively as they sent out a clear statement to their rivals both in Germany and across Europe. ""One should never be resigned, but it's clear that with their new signings and with the team they already have, Bayern have taken a few more steps ahead of all the teams in the Bundesliga,"" said Wolfsburg's Germany winger Andre Schuerrle. Another victory over Hanover will give Bayern 28 wins from their 34 games this season. Guardiola has won 81 of his 101 top-flight fixtures in Germany giving him the highest winning percentage of any coach to have worked in the Bundesliga. Midfielder Arturo Vidal will win his fifth consecutive league title after four with Juventus and now one with Bayern. Meanwhile, it could well be Mario Goetze's final home game having been told by Ancelotti to seek a transfer out of Munich, according to reports. Relegated Hanover last beat Bayern in the Bundesliga four years ago and this will be their last chance for at least another season. Some 7,000 Hanover fans are expected to travel to Munich for the game despite their fate having been sealed. ""We'll try to take something from Munich,"" said Hanover coach Daniel Stendel, whose side will be without injured Japan internationals Hiroshi Kiyotake and Hiroki Sakai. Their Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler has already said he will leave at the end of the season. Hummels will play his final home game for runners-up Dortmund when they host Cologne. The Germany centre-back was booed during their previous home match and he can expect more of the same at Signal Iduna Park. Dortmund have already started spending the reported 38 million euros they will receive for Hummels by signing France's young player of the year Ousmane Dembele from Rennes on Thursday. The 18-year-old is reported to cost 15 million euros and Liverpool were also chasing his signature. Dortmund will finish as the best ever second-placed side regardless of whether they add to their 77 points. One of three big-name clubs will be relegated on Saturday night with Werder Bremen, Eintracht Frankfurt and VfB Stuttgart battling to avoid joining Hanover in the second tier. Three points separate the three with Stuttgart, the 2007 champions, currently in the relegation zone. Werder, the 2004 champions, are two points above them in the relegation play-off position and entertain Frankfurt, who are another point better off. Stuttgart, who have an inferior goal difference to the two sides above them, have not won in eight but must win at Wolfsburg to stand any chance. However, the best they can hope for is climbing into 16th and setting up a two-legged play-off against Nuremberg, who will finish third in the second tier. Bremen know a win will keep them up but Frankfurt, who have won their last three games, need just a point to avoid the drop."
510,12/05/2016,16:34,Dortmund sign rising French star Dembele,"Borussia Dortmund signed France's young player of the year Ousmane Dembele from Rennes on Thursday, the German club fighting off strong English Premier League interest in the teenage forward.","Dortmund called the 18-year-old ""one of Europe's most sought after talents"" in a statement announcing the transfer on a five-year contract. The Bundesliga side did not give a figure for the deal, but German media said the fee was in the region of 15 million euros (£11.8m, $17.1m). British media had earlier reported that Liverpool were ready to offer £28 million for the France under-21 international, who was voted Ligue 1's young player of the year last weekend. Dembele, born in Normandy, has been a revelation for Rennes this season, scoring 12 goals and and five assists since making his debut in November. ""Ousmane can play nearly every position in attack,"" Dortmund's sporting director Michael Zorc told the club's website. ""He is strong one-on-one, he can play with both feet, he is good at nutmegging and dribbling, and he is fast and dangerous in front of goal."" Dortmund have been tracking the young talent for a long time. ""BVB showed a lot of interest in me right from an early stage and they have always kept close contact with me - this really impressed me,"" said Dembele, who came close to leaving Rennes last summer before making a single top-team appearance. ""I can hardly wait to play in the Bundesliga in front of more than 80 000 spectators in the Signal Iduna Park and to walk onto the pitch in the Champions League with my new team-mates,"" he added. News of his signing emerged 48 hours after Bayern Munich prised away Dortmund's captain, Germany centre-back Mats Hummels."
511,11/05/2016,13:26,"Go or stay long-term, Dortmund tell City target Gundogan",Borussia Dortmund have told injury-hit Manchester City target Ilkay Gundogan to either leave at the end of the season or sign a long-term contract extension.,"After Bayern Munich announced on Tuesday they have signed Borussia's captain Mats Hummels on a five-year deal, Dortmund are looking to keep hold of their other stars as they plan for next season when Borussia will be back in the Champions League. Midfielders Gundogan and Henrikh Mkhitaryan have been linked to Premier League clubs with City and Chelsea respectively reported to be interested. Gundogan's agent met with City's director of sport Txiki Begiristain in Amsterdam in March and reports in the German media say the deal is set to be finalised at the end of the season. But the situation has been complicated after Gundogan, who has a year left on his current Dortmund contract, dislocated his knee in training last week. The injury has ruled him out of next month's European championships in France with Germany and no date has been given as to when he can play again. ""I have spoken to him, he's very down after another serious injury. He knows we'll stand by him,"" Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke told local newspaper the Ruhr Nachrichten. ""There are two options, which we have discussed with Ilkay for a while. ""Either he leaves or he stays and extends his contract, but it must be long-term."" Gundogan is injury prone and missed most of the 2013-14 season, including Germany's World Cup triumph, with a persistent back injury. In recent seasons, he has only signed year-long extensions, but Borussia now want a longer commitment while Watzke says discussions with Mkhitaryan are still ongoing. Meanwhile, Hummels will play his final league game for Dortmund at home to Cologne on Saturday and Watzke says the farewell will have to be handled sensitively. The Germany centre-back was booed and jeered during Dortmund's previous home game after news first broke that he would join Bayern for next season. Hummels has become the latest Borussia star, after Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski, to join Bayern, but Watzke hopes there will be no more negativity from the Dortmund fans. ""I hope and wish that it'll be the case,"" said Watzke. ""I'd be happy if the whole club showed how big we are, there is no reason for bitterness, we respect his decision, also when it's a pity."""
512,11/05/2016,02:11,Bayern luring of Hummels set to weaken rivals Dortmund,Bayern Munich's dual signings of Renato Sanches and Mats Hummels on Tuesday managed to simultaneously strengthen their Champions League challenge while potentially weakening Borussia Dortmund for next season's Bundesliga campaign.,"Eleven days before Bayern face Dortmund in the German Cup final in Berlin, the Bavarian giants announced they have signed Germany centre-back Hummels from the only club to challenge them domestically this season. The 27-year-old is the third big-name Bayern hasve lured from Dortmund in three years after Mario Goetze in 2013 and Robert Lewandowski in 2014. Dortmund were already battling to keep defensive midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, linked to Manchester City, and Chelsea-target Henrikh Mkhitaryan, while striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is being courted by Europe's top clubs. Now they have lost their captain. The Dortmund defence will cope without Hummels, but he is just one more name who has walked out in the direction of Munich. Less than 40 minutes after Bayern announced they had signed teenage talent Sanches from Benfica for 35 million, the Hummels deal was confirmed after weeks of speculation. The double signings show Bayern's intent to win the Champions League for the sixth time. The Bavarians are smarting from last week's defeat to Atletico Madrid, their third straight exit to Spanish opposition at the semi-final stage in Europe. Hummels hastily left the Dortmund training ground 20 minutes after his transfer was announced. ""After eight-and-a-half years here, it was not an easy decision to make,"" he said in a statement on the club's website. ""I was always proud to wear the Borussia Dortmund shirt and be part of this exceptional team. ""Before I return to my hometown, we all have the big goal of bringing the German Cup trophy to Dortmund. ""For that I will give my all."" Having grown up in Munich and come up through Bayern's youth academy, Hummels is simply returning to the club he left Dortmund for, on loan, in 2008. The 4.2m euros ($4.7m) Dortmund later paid for him in 2009 is dwarfed by the 38 million Bayern will reportedly pay to sign him back. It's a similar fee to the 37 million Goetze cost three years ago before Lewandowski left on a free transfer. Hummels returns as a World Cup winner. He won the 2011 Bundesliga title, then the 2012 German league and cup double with Dortmund before losing 2-1 in the 2013 Champions League final -- to Bayern. Had they waited 12 months, Bayern would have signed Hummels on a free transfer. He will partner Jerome Boateng at centre-back in front of Manuel Neuer in the core of the Germany defence which won the 2014 World Cup. But after being jeered ten days ago by home fans in Dortmund's 5-1 routing of Wolfsburg, Hummels can expect to run another gauntlet at Borussia's Signal Iduna Park in his last home game against Cologne this Saturday. CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has asked Dortmund fans to show respect. ""We wish, both for him and Borussia Dortmund, that during his final weeks in the black and yellow shirt, he will get the recognition he deserves and leaves with the German Cup in Dortmund's hands,"" said Watzke optimistically. Hummels wants to sign off his eight-and-a-half years by seeing Dortmund win the German Cup at the expense of his future employers. His immediate family live in Munich, his wife also grew up there, and Hummels says his desire to re-join Bayern is partly motivated by wanting to go home. The unspoken other part is his improved chances of winning more titles. Hummels' departure is a bitter pill for Dortmund fans to swallow after he critisised both Goetze and Lewandowski when they left for Bayern. ""This has surprised everyone. From a sporting perspective, there are few to no reasons to leave us,"" Hummels told Sport Bild in 2013 after Mario Goetze left for Bayern. Having been on the losing side with Dortmund in the 2013 final, Lewandowski was open in his wanting to join Bayern in the hope of lifting the Champions League. During Lewandowski's final season with Borussia, Hummels told Die Welt in 2014: ""I have never measured myself in titles. It's about playing football for me, I don't have to say, if I've never win the Champions League I won't be happy. ""I don't have to be in the best team in the world to have a shot at a title. ""I would take one title at Borussia Dortmund over six with another club."" Despite 290 appearances in the Dortmund shirt, Hummels would be naive to expect a fond farewell on Saturday on his final home appearance. There promises to be a din from Borussia's die-hard fans in the south stand when the inevitable whistling starts."
513,10/05/2016,12:49,"Bayern sign Hummels, teenage talent Sanches","Bayern Munich has signed Germany defender Mats Hummels, his club Borussia Dortmund confirmed on Tuesday, while the Bavarian giants have announced the transfer of teenager Renato Sanches from Benfica.","Centre-back Hummels, 27, is the third Dortmund star to join Bayern in three years after midfielder Mario Goetze left to join the Munich giants in 2013, followed by striker Robert Lewandowski in 2014. ""For the coming 2016/17 season, the Borussia Dortmund player Mats Julian Hummels will transfer to FC Bayern Munich,"" said Dortmund in a terse statement. ""Both clubs have now reached an agreement in principle and the formal completion of the transfer, and the usual medical examination of the player, should be completed in the coming days."" Reports in the German media say Bayern have paid up to 38 million euros (US$43.26m) for Hummels, who had a year left on his Dortmund contract. Having left Bayern in 2009 for Dortmund, Hummels is returning to the Bavarian giants having won the German league title twice with Dortmund (in 2011 and 2012) and the German Cup (2012) before helping Germany win the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Bayern also announced on Tuesday the signing of teenage Portugal international Sanches from Benfica on a five-year contract, having beaten Manchester United to sign the teenager. The Bavarian giants say they paid 35 million euros (US$39.81m), plus possible bonuses, for the defensive midfielder, who was first capped by Portugal earlier this year having only made his debut for Benfica in the Portuguese league last October."

His current Borussia contract expires in June 2017, but he has been linked to a transfer to Manchester to work with their incoming manager Pep Guardiola, after Gundogan's agent met City's director of sport Txiki Begiristain in Amsterdam in March. But Gundogan's latest injury has now cast doubts over a possible switch. ""Ilkay is currently still in shock (after getting injured). How things go with him, we will have to wait and see,"" Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc told German daily Bild. Gundogan has been capped 16 times by Germany, but already missed his country's triumph at the 2014 World Cup because of a long-term back injury. According to Bild, a year's extension to his Dortmund contract is out of the question, meaning Gundogan may have to sign a long-term deal with Borussia if a possible transfer falls through. ""An injury would be the worst reason to extend a contract,"" admitted Dortmund's coach Thomas Tuchel. Gundogan has put in a series of strong performances this season for Dortmund this, who will finish second behind Bayern Munich in the German league and face Guardiola's Bavarians in the German Cup final on May 21 in Berlin."

But Benatia, 29, is unimpressed by the prospect of having to battle wih Hummels for one of the centre-back berths at Bayern and has criticised the Bavarian giants. ""Bayern are negotiating with Hummels. If I should go, then I'll go,"" Benatia told Sky Italia, ahead of Tuesday's home Champions League semi-final, return leg against Atletico Madrid. ""But first of all I want to finish the season well, we can still win the treble. ""I wouldn't do what the club has done, which is to talk about transfers before a Champions League semi-final."" Benatia came off the bench in Bayern's 1-0 defeat to Atletico in the first leg in Madrid last Wednesday and has not earned a spot in Pep Guardiola's first-choice team at Bayern. His potential future employers could be Roma, who sold him to Bayern in 2014. ""I'd definitely go back. Everyone knows that Rome is a special place for me,"" he added. ""So many people from there remain in my heart. ""If I should leave Bayern, Roma would be a possibility.""

The 27-year-old centre-back told Dortmund on Thursday that he wants to leave at the end of the season, with a year left on his contract, to join Bayern. Hummels was booed for each of the 125 touches of the ball at Borussia's Signal Iduna Park stadium in their 5-1 win over Wolfsburg. But Watzke says anyone who booed him has no right to call themselves a Borussia Dortmund fan. ""Mats is a great kid,"" Watzke told broadcaster WDR2. ""Anyone who insulted him has already gambled away the right to belong to us, because that is not Borussia Dortmund's way."" Watzke praised the ""90 or 95 percent"" of the fans who had neither booed nor whistled Hummels. The Dortmund captain said he knew where the boos came from. ""It wasn't from fans. It was only some 300, who didn't particularly love me before this happened and used their chance on the stage,"" said Hummels. ""I saw where it came from."" A potential row between Germany's top two teams was quickly de-escalated by Watzke and Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge after ex-Munich president Uli Hoeness had implied Hummels approached Bayern first. ""Perhaps Uli misunderstood,"" said Rummenigge. ""Bayern Munich knocked on the door, not Mats Hummels. ""Mats didn't go on the offensive and approached us, we asked if he could imagine transferring."" Hummels gave an angry rebuff of Hoeness' comment in the mixed zone after the match. ""I didn't offer myself to anyone, that's the biggest load of nonsense I ever heard,"" fumed the Germany defender. Rummenigge said he hopes Dortmund will agree on a price for their defender, who joined Borussia from the Bavarian giants in 2008, before the two clubs meet in the German Cup final on May 21 in Berlin. Borussia are already bracing themselves to lose midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, who is expected to leave at the end of the season to join Manchester City."

Second-placed Borussia Dortmund romped to a 5-1 win at home against Wolfsburg to trim Bayern's lead at the top to five points with two games left. Bayern are away to mid-table Ingolstadt next Saturday, then host relegated Hanover on the final day of the season in a fortnight. The draw with Gladbach comes three days before Tuesday's crunch Champions League home semi-final against Atletico Madrid with Bayern having lost the first leg 1-0 away last Wednesday. ""Of course, we had wanted to win today, for our fans and for ourselves,"" said Guardiola. ""We need just a point now, a draw, or a win to secure the title. ""But now there's time to concentrate on Atletico Madrid, it will be a different game on Tuesday. We must play better."" Bayern were punished for sitting back after Mueller's sixth-minute headed opener. Gladbach, one of only two clubs to beat Bayern in the German league this season, hit back when Hahn slotted home on 72 minutes having gone close just moments before. A superb pass from Lars Stindl put Hahn in behind the Bayern defence and he wrong-footed Medhi Benatia before firing his shot past Manuel Neuer. There was some good news for Bayern as Jerome Boateng played his first game since January. The Germany defender is now in line to face Diego Simeone's Atletico with a place in the Champions League final on May 28 at stake. In Dortmund, Borussia hammered Wolfsburg with Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa scoring their first and creating their second before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang came off the bench to score twice. The Gabon striker now has 25 league goals this season, leaving him two short of Bayern's Robert Lewandowski. Dortmund took the lead when Henrikh Mkhitaryan's bullet pass was deflected home by Kagawa, who then set up Ramos to leave Dortmund 2-0 up inside nine minutes. Marco Reus grabbed their third by chipping home with an hour gone. Aubameyang replaced Ramos on 69 minutes and scored his first just eight minutes later when Mkhitaryan's pass found him unmarked to header home, then netted a second header just a minute later before Wolfsburg's Andre Schuerrle scored a consolation. At the other end of the table, Hanover 96's relegation was confirmed by their 3-1 defeat to Schalke. Eintracht Frankfurt boosted their survival hopes with a 2-1 win at Darmstadt to go 16th, which carries a two-legged promotion/relegation play-off at the end of the season. But 17th-placed Werder Bremen can push Frankfurt back down the table if they beat VfB Stuttgart, who are 15th, at home on Monday in a crunch relegation battle. Mid-table Hamburg played out a goalless draw at home to Mainz, who stay seventh and on course for a Europa League place. Hoffenheim looked to have escaped relegation under 28-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann, the youngest in the Bundesliga's history, and they are four points from the drop zone, after their 2-1 win at home to Ingolstadt."

Dortmund added that there was no release clause in Hummels' contract, ""nor for any other player."" Hummels is under contract at the Signal Iduna Park until June 2017, but Dortmund did open the door to a move for the 27-year-old provided Bayern make ""an offer worthy of the player's exceptional value"". ""Up until now, Bayern have not made such an offer,"" Dortmund added. Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said earlier this week that the Bundesliga leaders were in negotiations with Hummels. However, he added: ""You have to respect his current contract in view of our proper relationship with Borussia Dortmund, we have to be considerate."" Hummels, a World Cup winner with Germany in 2014, started his career at Bayern but he moved to Dortmund on loan in 2008 before making the move permanent the following year. Should he sign for Bayern for next season, Hummels would be the third big-name Dortmund star to quit Borussia for Munich in the last three years after Mario Goetze in 2013 and Robert Lewandowski in 2014."
520,26/04/2016,15:48,Bayern confirm negotiations with Hummels,German league leaders Bayern Munich on Tuesday confirmed they are negotiating with Borussia Dortmund's Germany defender and club captain Mats Hummels.,"Should he sign for Bayern for next season, Hummels would be the third big-name Dortmund star to quit Borussia for Munich in the last three years after midfielder Mario Goetze in 2013 and striker Robert Lewandowski in 2014. Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has already said he expects Hummels to join Bayern for next season, even though his Borussia contract runs until June 2017. ""Basically, I can confirm what Mr Watzke has said; Mats is dealing with Bayern,"" chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said as the Munich club jetted off for Wednesday's Champions League semi-final first leg at Atletico Madrid. ""But every transfer is a three-way business, so we have to wait calmly. ""You have to respect his current contract in view of our proper relationship with Borussia Dortmund, we have to be considerate."" Dortmund, who will likely finish second behind Bayern in the Bundesliga, will be back in the Champions League next season, but Hummels, along with midfielders Ilkay Gundogan and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, is one of three stars out of contract next season. Borussia want to extend all three contracts, but Gundogan is almost certain to join Manchester City to work with current Bayern coach Pep Guardiola next season. Gundogan's agent met City's director of sport Txiki Begiristain in Amsterdam last month, while reports in the UK media claim a five-year contract has already been signed. Mkhitaryan has been linked to Chelsea, although he is the one most likely to stay. Hummels joined Dortmund from Bayern in 2008 and Watzke is realistic about whether he will stay. ""I believe that if he (Hummels) goes, it will be in the direction of Munich,"" said Watzke. ""He still has unfinished business with the club (Bayern Munich). His father, his mother and his brother all live in Munich. ""His girlfriend comes from Munich, he's from Munich too -- so a whole lot of components have already come together."" Watzke says he can understand Hummels' deliberations. ""We have to accept when someone like Mats, who has already played for Borussia Dortmund for eight years, is 27 and would come to think: 'Am I going to play for Borussia Dortmund for my entire career, or will I do something else?'"" said Watzke. However, the Borussia boss told Munich-based newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung he would ""fight for Mat, like I have never before fought for a player"". Watzke said Bayern would have to ""dig really deep in their pockets"" to sign Hummels, who has a market value of 32 million euros ($36.1 million). One Bayern star Watzke would like to see playing in the Black and Yellow shirt again is Germany's World Cup winner Goetze, who left in 2013 for 37 million euros, but has failed to make an impact in Munich. ""He came up through the youth teams with us and he is highly regarded -- also by me personally,"" said Watzke. ""If he came on the market and we received a signal that he was interested to come back to us, we'd discuss it."""
521,26/04/2016,12:14,Dortmund CEO expects Hummels to join Bayern,Borussia Dortmund boss Hans-Joachim Watzke says he expects Germany defender Mats Hummels will join Bayern Munich next season.,"Watzke is battling to keep Hummels at Borussia and the club captain is one of three stars -- alongside Ilkay Gundogan and Henrikh Mkhitaryan -- who are all out of contract in June 2017. Gundogan is almost certain to join Manchester City next season. His agent met City's director of sport Txiki Begiristain in Amsterdam last month, while reports in the UK media claim a five-year contract has already been signed. Hummels has admitted he is weighing up an offer, most likely from Bayern, while Mkhitaryan has been linked to Chelsea, although he is the one most likely to stay. Watzke says he expects to lose some -- but not all three -- of his stars. ""I don't believe that we will have all contracts extended and that all three will play here next year,"" Watzke told Sky. ""But it is completely out of the question that all three won't play for Borussia Dortmund next season."" Hummels joined Dortmund from Bayern in 2008 after failing to break into the Bavarians' first team. Having already lost Robert Lewandowski to Bayern Munich on a free transfer in 2014, after Mario Goetze had left for the Bavarians in 2013, Dortmund are eager to avoid seeing Hummels follow suit, but Watzke is realistic. ""I believe that if he (Hummels) goes, it will be in the direction of Munich,"" said Watzke. ""He still has unfinished business with the club (Bayern Munich). His father, his mother and his brother all live in Munich. ""His girlfriend comes from Munich, he's from Munich too -- so a whole lot of components have already come together.""

522,25/04/2016,21:30,Schmelzer extends Dortmund stay until 2021,Germany international Marcel Schmelzer has signed a five-year contract extension to keep him at Borussia Dortmund until 2021.,"The 28-year-old has made 195 appearances for Dortmund in Germany's top flight, including 23 Bundesliga matches this season with Borussia second behind Bayern Munich. The left-back was part of the team which won the 2011 Bundesliga, the 2012 league and cup double, then reached the 2013 Champions League final. ""This is a team full of character and this club is totally unique. I'm delighted to be able to be a part of things in the future here,"" he told the club's website. ""My family and I have felt at home here for years. Dortmund is my sporting home and always will be."" Schmelzer's signature is a boost to Borussia who are hoping stars Mats Hummels, Ilkay Gundogan and Henrik Mkhitaryan will all sign contract extensions before the end of the season. Schmelzer, who won the last of his 16 caps for Germany in 2013, is one of Dortmund's longest-serving players, having made his debut back in August 2008."
523,24/04/2016,13:27,"Dortmund will cope if Hummels goes, says CEO",Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke says the club will cope if captain and Germany star Mats Hummels opts to leave in the summer.,"""We have always found solutions and we will find solutions again,"" said Watzke after reports that Hummels is the latest Borussia star to be offered a contract at rivals Bayern Munich. ""It doesn't matter what a player decides to do, we have shown in the last five years that we can replace everyone."" The 27-year-old has a year left on his Dortmund contract, but last week Hummels' father refused to rule out a return to Bayern, from whom he joined Borussia in 2008. Hummels could follow Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze, who left Borussia for Bayern in 2013, and striker Robert Lewandowski, who quit in 2014, on what is becoming a well-worn path from Dortmund to Munich. But Borussia hope to keep hold of Hummels. ""We are having confidential discussions with Mats,"" Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc told Sky before Saturday's 3-0 league win at VfB Stuttgart. ""But we don't want to comment further on this subject, because nothing has yet been decided."" Dortmund are seven points behind Bayern with three games left and Germany's top two teams will meet in the German Cup final on May 21. Hummels, just as he did at the same stage of last season, has openly admitted he is considering his options having been linked to the likes of Bayern, Barcelona and Manchester United. ""It is a very difficult decision. When I make it at some point, then everyone will understand why it is so difficult for me,"" he said on the subject. ""It has been costing me about half an hour of sleep per night before I drift off, because the issue is so close to my heart."""
524,23/04/2016,17:51,Bayern made to wait for historic fourth straight title,Bayern Munich must wait another week to claim an historic fourth consecutive Bundesliga title although Saturday's 2-0 win at Hertha Berlin left them seven points clear with three games left.,"Bayern could have had the league wrapped up in the capital had second-placed Dortmund not won 3-0 at VfB Stuttgart. That result means Pep Guardiola's Bavarians will secure the title if they beat Borussia Moechengladbach at home next Saturday regardless of other results. No other team has even won four consecutive league titles in Germany's top flight. Bayern took the lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium when Mario Goetze's pass found Vidal in space. The Chile midfielder drilled home his shot from 22 metres, which took a deflection on it's way past Berlin goalkeeper Thomas Kraft on 48 minutes. Brazil winger Douglas Costa doubled Bayern's lead with a breath-taking strike from the right flank which looped over the Hertha goalkeeper on 79 minutes. But this was a far from polished performance from Bayern, ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, first-leg, at Atletico Madrid. They managed just six shots on goal, compared to Hertha's nine, despite the hosts being restricted to just 26 percent possession. Dortmund, who will face the Bavarians in the German Cup final on May 21, made Bayern wait a little longer to have their title win confirmed with a comprehensive win at Stuttgart. Borussia were 2-0 up at the break after Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa netted early on, then 17-year-old Christian Pulisic scored for the second week running. Just before half-time he tapped home after Henrikh Mkhitaryan's shot from outside the area was blocked by Stuttgart's Poland goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton. Mkhitaryan made it 3-0 when he fired home after Kagawa's cross to striker Adrian Ramos, in for the injured Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, was blocked by Tyton on 56 minutes. Wolfsburg's miserable league form continues as they are now six Bundesliga games without a win after crashing 2-0 at home to Augsburg. Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason, on loan from Olympiakos, scored his sixth league goal in ten games, with a minute gone, then set up Turkey international Halil Altintop on 57 minutes. The defeat sees Wolfsburg drop to tenth in the table while Augsburg are now five points clear of the relegation places. Cologne are up to ninth after backing up their 3-2 comeback win over Mainz with a 4-1 thumping of Darmstadt as French striker Anthony Modeste and winger Marcel Risse both scored twice. Hanover have only a mathematical chance of avoiding relegation after Japan internationals Hiroki Sakai and Hiroshi Kiyotake scored in their 2-2 draw with 10-man Ingolstadt. Ingolstadt played for 70 minutes with ten men after French defender Romain Bregerie was sent off for hauling down Hanover midfielder Felix Klaus. Alfredo Morales and Moritz Hartmann had hosts Ingolstadt 2-0 up with only 25 minutes gone. Defender Sakai fired home on 58 minutes before midfielder Kiyotake made sure Hanover claimed a point with the equaliser eight minutes from time. On Friday, Pierre-Michel Lasogga struck twice as Hamburg eased their Bundesliga relegation fears with a 2-1 victory at home to Werder Bremen, who remain stuck in the bottom three."
525,20/04/2016,22:55,Dortmund down Hertha to face Bayern in cup final,Borussia Dortmund will face Bayern Munich in the German Cup final on May 21 after their comprehensive 3-0 semi-final win at Hertha Berlin on Wednesday.,"A first-half goal by Gonzalo Castro, plus late second-half strikes from wingers Marco Reus and Henrikh Mkhitaryan sealed Dortmund's deserved win at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. The victory sends Thomas Tuchel's Dortmund team back to the same Cup final venue in a month's time. ""I am very happy with the manner and vein of the victory,"" said Tuchel as his side exorcised the bitter disappointment of last Thursday's 4-3 Europa League defeat at Liverpool. ""I need to pay the team a really fat compliment. We deserved the win."" Munich's 2-0 win over Werder Bremen on Tuesday means that Germany's top two teams will meet again when Dortmund play Bayern in a repeat of the 2012 and 2014 Cup finals. ""The joy at reaching the final is huge. That will again be an interesting game,"" said Dortmund's goal-scorer Reus ahead of their showdown with Bayern. Dortmund were dealt a blow before kick-off as top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang dropped out with a foot injury. Tuchel had said the Gabon international, who has scored 37 goals in all competitions, had the all clear to play despite breaking off the last five minutes of Monday's training session. But the knock flared up an old injury Aubameyang picked up in their quarter-final win over Stuttgart in February. His place against Hertha went to Colombia striker Adrian Ramos, who scored twice in Sunday's 3-0 league win over Hamburg. Aubameyang had netted in each of Dortmund's last seven German Cup games dating back to the start of last season. Dortmund took the lead when Mkhitaryan won the ball on the right, Shinji Kagawa fired in the cross and Castro was unmarked on the edge of the area to blast home on 21 minutes. It was a weak start from Hertha who seemed overawed by the occasion at their sold out 76,233 stadium as Dortmund dominated the early stages. Borussia then scored two goals in the final 15 minutes to deny Hertha their dream of a first Cup final appearance at their own ground since 1993. Nearly 23 years ago, their reserve team made a shock run to the final when they lost to Bayer Leverkusen. It remains the only time a reserve team has managed the feat in Germany and it is 37 since year since Hertha's first team last reached the final. ""We had a chance today and my team played to their limits,"" said Hertha coach Pal Dardai. ""At the end of the day, you have to say Dortmund were too quick for us, you could feel something was missing."" A slip by Hertha's US defender John Anthony Brooks on 75 minutes allowed Reus the space in the area to fire home Kagawa's final pass. Dortmund then completed the rout when Mkhitaryan finished off a good counter-attack with Reus again popping up to provide the final pass with the Hertha defence in tatters. Dortmund will hope for a repeat of their impressive 5-2 win over Bayern in the 2012 final when striker Robert Lewandowski netted a hat-trick against his future employers. Munich then claimed revenge two years ago with a 2-0 extra-time win in the 2014 final."
526,19/04/2016,14:51,Aubameyang fit as Dortmund hunt Anfield cure in Berlin,Borussia Dortmund's Thomas Tuchel says Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will be fit for Wednesday's German Cup semi-final at Hertha Berlin as they look to heal the hurt of their Europa League exit at Liverpool.,"Aubameyang has scored 37 goals in all competitions for Dortmund this season, but limped out of Monday's training with a toe injury, sparking concerns about his fitness. ""Aubameyang took a hit to his toe in training, which was very painful, but it shouldn't be an issue for Wednesday,"" assured Tuchel, Dortmund's head coach. Aubameyang is on an incredible goal-scoring run in the German Cup, having scored in each of Dortmund's last seven cup games -- including their 3-1 defeat to Wolfsburg in the 2015 final -- dating back to the start of last season. With Bayern Munich meeting Werder Bremen in Tuesday's other semi-final, Dortmund are determined to reach the German Cup final to exorcise the heartache of their dramatic European quarterfinal exit at Anfield. ""The set up is similar to how it was in Liverpool: it's a knock-out game, an away match, we'll be meeting a euphoric opponent, who are full of confidence from the great support of their home fans,"" said Tuchel. Tuchel admits Dortmund are still processing last Thursday's 4-3 defeat at Liverpool having thrown away a 3-1 lead. ""It would be hypocritical to say that we will have been working on the Liverpool result until tomorrow -- there is no medicine for that,"" said Tuchel. ""We are finding things out about ourselves and that's okay. We're on the right path to dealing with it. ""Of course, after such a defeat as that, you feel bitter, but it's not the end of the world. ""It hasn't been an issue in our concrete preparations for tomorrow."" Asides from Anfield, there has also been the off-field distraction of media reports that, with a year left on his Dortmund contract, Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has agreed a five-year deal to join Manchester City for next season. Having lost last year's cup final, Dortmund are eager to beat Berlin to stay in the hunt for a title as they trail Pep Guardiola's Bayern in the German league and are currently seven points adrift with four games left. Dortmund make the 500km (310 miles) trek to Germany's capital hoping to again head west for the final in a month's time. Hertha are bidding to reach the final for the first time since 1993 and with a capacity crowd of 76,233 expected, their coach Pal Dardai says 'the whole city and all the players' are up for this match. ""I expect a team from Hertha with a lot of confidence, who will defend high up the pitch,"" said Tuchel. ""They are brave in their build-up play and from week to week they are improving their possession. ""Our goal is to be in the final and win it. ""Whether this is a lesson, to learn from the Liverpool game, to play more physically, I would like to differentiate. ""It's not as though things started to unravel after the first goal in Liverpool. ""The lesson of the past few weeks after the international break is very simple: We have to play better."

Dortmund-based newspaper the Ruhr Nachrichten posted a video on Twitter of Aubameyang limping out of training, but the club later said he should be fit to play in Berlin. Aubameyang is on an incredible goal-scoring run in the German Cup, having scored in each of his last seven cup games dating back to the start of last season. He has netted in each of Dortmund's three cup matches so far this season and also scored in the 2015 final defeat to Wolfsburg, when Borussia lost 3-1 in Berlin.

Now the Poland hot-shot has turned his sights on Bremen, who are third from bottom in the Bundesliga. ""I'm really pleased,"" he said after refinding his scoring touch. ""I hope I will shoot a few more goals in the coming weeks."" Unusually for him, Lewandowski was on the bench for Bayern's 2-2 draw at Benfica last Wednesday which confirmed their 3-2 aggregate quarter-final win in Europe.

Dortmund are at Berlin 24 hours later in their semi-final looking to exorcise the bitter disappointment of their of last-gasp 4-3 Europa League defeat at Liverpool. Having bowed out of Europe at the last eight stage, Borussia want to reach this year's German Cup final having lost 3-1 to Wolfsburg in the 2015 edition. Like Lewandowski, Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel said the goal is now to make sure his side beat Hertha to return to Berlin's Olympic Stadium for the final. The Borussia boss rested his stars Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Marco Reus in Sunday's 3-0 league win over Hamburg. He started 17-year-old Felix Passlack at left-back and goal-scorer Christian Pulisic, already a US international who only turns 18 in September on the left wing.

""We're happy with the 3-0 win and now we're looking forward to the German Cup semi-final. The task is clear: we want to reach the final."" Hertha crashed to a 2-1 league defeat at Hoffenheim on Saturday, hardly the ideal preparation as they attempt to reach the German Cup final for the first time since 1993. Hertha coach Pal Dardai lives within a stone's throw of the Olympic Stadium and is desperate to lead his team out for the cup final having always attended as a fan.

""It's nice when you learn about something like this in this manner,"" he added with sarcasm. ""We don't comment on transfer rumours."" Bild reported that Gundogan has already signed a City contract until June 2021. The Sun say the deal will be announced at the end of the season with Gundogan, who has one year left on his Dortmund contract, set to cost City between 30-37 million euros $34-42 million). On March 7, Bayern Munich coach Guardiola, who will take over at the Etihad Stadium next season, met City's director of sport Txiki Begiristain in Amsterdam.

Pulisic only turns 18 in September, but having played his first German league game in January, the left winger made his senior international debut for the USA in March. He has now scored his first Bundesliga goal on only his third start after being promoted from the Under-17 side by head coach Thomas Tuchel in the winter break. Dortmund look to have uncovered another star just as they seem set to lose one. Reports on Sunday in both the German and UK media suggest defensive midfielder Ilkay Gundogan is set to join Manchester City for the start of next season. But Dortmund stayed in the hunt for the German league title as Colombia striker Adrian Ramos scored twice at Signal Iduna Park. Hamburg were reduced to ten men early in the second half when goalkeeper Rene Adler was shown a straight red after bringing down Shinji Kagawa. After a great pass from Dortmund captain Mats Hummels, Pulisic gave Dortmund the lead with a strike which beat Adler at the near post on 38 minutes. ""It's an amazing feeling to get my first goal. Mats put in a great pass to set me up,"" said Pulisic. ""It's hard to put into words what it felt like to score."" Ramos then made it 2-0 when he also put in a superb strike across the face of the Hamburg goal on 44 minutes. Hamburg had Adler sent off on 52 minutes and Ramos added his second on 86 minutes when Japan's Kagawa put in the final pass. Dortmund now have the chance to book their place in the German Cup final when they play Hertha Berlin away in the semi-final on Wednesday. ""We were all very sad (after the Liverpool defeat), but the coach told us we have to go on and now we'll have to wait and see what happens in Berlin,"" added Pulisic. Dortmund's win trims Bayern's lead to seven points with only four games left after Pep Guardiola's side beat Schalke 3-0 at home on Saturday. Poland hot-shot Robert Lewandowski netted twice in Munich to leave him as the league's top scorer with 27 Bundesliga goals this season. Later on Sunday, Cologne came from 2-0 down to pull off a stunning 3-2 win at Mainz. The hosts would have climbed to fifth and closing on a Europa League place for next season after goals by striker Jhon Cordoba and defender Leon Balogun. But Cologne roared back at Mainz's Coface Arena with goals from Marcel Risse and Milos Jojic before French striker Anthony Modeste netted the dramatic winner in the dying stages. The win moves Cologne up to 10th while Mainz remain sixth."

Dortmund are licking the wounds from Thursday's dramatic European exit as they let a 3-1 second-leg lead at Anfield slip to a 4-3 quarter-final defeat as Dejan Lovren's 91st-minute winner sealed Liverpool's 5-4 victory on aggregate. The last-gasp defeat has taken a heavy toll as Dortmund prepare to host Hamburg and keep the pressure on Bundesliga leaders Bayern, who started the weekend with a seven-point lead. ""We had a realistic chance of winning the title, it was there for the taking,"" said Dortmund captain Mats Hummels. ""That's a huge disappointment for everyone in Dortmund. I believed that we'd win the thing."" Hummels then gave a clue to where Dortmund went wrong on Merseyside: ""We thought we were through."" Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said the disappointment ""sits deep and will go even deeper"" while club president Reinhard Rauball said he envied a colleague who had gone to bed with Borussia 3-1 ahead in Liverpool. ""At least he had a good night's sleep, unlike me,"" said Rauball. ""That is the worst defeat in my time with Borussia Dortmund, worse than at Wembley against Bayern (in the 2013 Champions League final)."" Dortmund have the chance to redeem their Europa League defeat when they play Hertha Berlin next Wednesday in the German Cup semi-finals. But Tuchel says his side must focus on beating mid-table Hamburg, who have proved to be their bogey team of late. Dortmund are winless in their last four league games against Hamburg and lost 3-1 away to Bruno Labbadia's side last November. Hamburg also sneaked a 1-0 win at Dortmund on their last visit to the Signal Iduna Park in October 2014. Hamburg have won just three of their last ten league games, but Tuchel is taking nothing fro granted. ""On Sunday, we won't be playing to get ready for Wednesday, we'll be playing for tomorrow and the 81,000 fans watching,"" said Tuchel. ""I rate Hamburg as very efficient and very passionate and it's obvious that we will need a good performance on Sunday."""
533,15/04/2016,11:18,Dortmund told to act like champions after Europa exit,Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel has told his side to behave like champions despite the bitter disappointment of their last-gasp Europa League quarter-final exit at the hands of Liverpool.,"Dortmund threw away a 2-0 lead at Anfield, after early goals by Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, in Thursday's Europa League quarter-final, second-leg, as Dejan Lovren's 91st-minute winner sealed Liverpool's 4-3 victory. Liverpool's manager Jurgen Klopp, Tuchel's predecessor at Dortmund, helped inspire the Reds' dramatic comeback by evoking the spirit of the 2005 Champions League final when Liverpool came from 3-0 down to beat AC Milan on penalties. But Dortmund are licking their wounds having led 3-1, 4-2 on aggregate, with half an hour remaining before goals by Philippe Coutinho, then Mamadou Sakho, put Liverpool level only for Lovren's dramatic winner to break Borussian hearts. ""We wanted to win like champions, now we must at least lose like champions -- and pick ourselves up,"" said Tuchel after Lovren's heart-stopping stoppage-time header. ""We don't need any sympathy or a pat on the back."" While Liverpool prepare for their European semi-final, Dortmund have only a Bundesliga match at home to Hamburg on Sunday to console themselves before next Wednesday's German Cup semi-final at Hertha Berlin' Olympic Stadium. Should they beat Hertha, Bayern Munich are potential opponents in the May 21 final as they face Werder Bremen in the other semi-final at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday. ""No later than next Wednesday, we have to transform the disappointment into energy and defiance in order to achieve our next major goal,"" said Tuchel. Germany winger Marco Reus, whose strike on 57 minutes had put Dortmund 3-1 up at Anfield, admitted his side threw the game away. ""We stopped both defending and attacking well in the second half,"" fumed Reus. ""Of course, we shouldn't have given the game away like that -- it is extremely disappointing. ""We all have to ask ourselves, how we could let a game like that run through our fingers."""
534,15/04/2016,03:08,Klopp evokes Istanbul in Liverpool comeback,Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp revealed he had evoked the spirit of the club's famous Champions League fightback in Istanbul to inspire his team to Europa League victory over Borussia Dortmund.,"Two-nil down at half-time in Thursday's quarter-final second leg, and 3-1 behind on aggregate, Klopp reminded his players of the memorable night in May 2005 when former captain Steven Gerrard inspired his team-mates to come back from 3-0 down and overcome AC Milan in a penalty shoot-out. Divock Origi immediately reduced the arrears and although Marco Reus then struck back for Dortmund, goals from Philippe Coutinho and Mamadou Sakho teed up a storming Anfield finale that saw Dejan Lovren head home a stoppage-time winner to complete an extraordinary 5-4 aggregate win. ""It was a good atmosphere in half-time, honestly, because I was satisfied with the game; not with the goals, but with the game in general,"" Klopp said after the victory over his former club. ""I told the lads I was not there, but a few Liverpool players who are a little bit older and work as experts for television, they were 3-0 down at half-time and won a Champions League final. ""Even when it's not really likely, it's for sure possible and we should try it. When we scored, everybody could see it -- something happened in the stadium. You could hear it, you could feel it and you could smell it."" Dortmund's third goal on the night, brilliantly set up by Mats Hummels and scored by Reus in the 57th minute, momentarily looked to have taken the wind out of Liverpool's sails, but Klopp said that his side's response revealed their depth of character. ""That's the moment in football and in life where you have to show character,"" said the German, who succeeded Brendan Rodgers last October. ""That's what the lads did. That was pretty cool to watch. Of course to come back in a game like this against this highest quality opponent and win, you need a little bit of luck. ""But I think everybody who saw the game has to say it's deserved."" Liverpool will learn their last-four opponents in Friday's draw and while Klopp warned that there was still a long way to go in the competition, which his club have previously won three times, he said that his side had established a benchmark for future performances. ""We will 100 percent get a real strong opponent in the semi-final. And we have to be there again, everybody,"" he said. ""But for tonight (Thursday), it was brilliant, outstanding, wonderful, emotional. Everything. I will not forget it because it's special. Now we have to carry on and do things like this more often."" Thomas Tuchel, who succeeded Klopp at Dortmund, was still struggling to make sense of what had happened in his post-match press conference. ""If you expect an explanation, I probably have to disappoint you because an explanation would mean that things are logical or tactical or at least in moments you see where a game goes to the other side,"" he said. ""None of this happened. We had a great reaction on the first goal of Liverpool and we scored a third one. ""With the equaliser it was an atmosphere where everybody, except our supporters, believed it was meant to be."" With Dortmund's Bundesliga hopes fading after they fell seven points behind Bayern Munich, Tuchel urged his players to clear their heads in time for their German Cup semi-final against Hertha Berlin on April 20. ""We have to turn disappointment into energy and grit in our approach,"" said the 42-year-old, who had seen his team go 2-0 up inside nine minutes through Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. ""In Berlin the target is to reach the final, so we shouldn't be too afraid of where we are now. Our task is to deal with the disappointment as quickly as possible."""
535,14/04/2016,23:11,Last-gasp Lovren sinks Dortmund in Europa thriller,Dejan Lovren scored a heart-stopping stoppage-time header as Liverpool completed an astonishing comeback to beat Borussia Dortmund 4-3 on Thursday and reach the Europa League semi-finals.,"Held 1-1 in last week's first leg at the Westfalenstadion, Dortmund scored twice in nine minutes through Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to take a firm grip on the tie. After Divock Origi had given Liverpool a foothold, Marco Reus struck again for the visitors, but goals from Philippe Coutinho and Mamadou Sakho levelled the tie before Lovren headed home in the 91st minute to give former Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp the biggest win of his Anfield tenure. Liverpool's stirring rally, which unfurled amid an electrifying Anfield atmosphere, took them into a continental semi-final for the first time since 2010 and kept Klopp on course to end his first season at the club with a trophy. His successor at Dortmund, Thomas Tuchel, could only look on in disbelief at the final whistle as the 5-4 aggregate scoreline condemned his side to defeat, four days on from a 2-2 draw with Schalke that left his men seven points adrift of leaders Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga. Kick-off was preceded by a rousing communal rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone', the two clubs' anthem, and a solemnly observed minute's silence to mark the 27th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster. But any sense of sentimentality quickly vanished as Dortmund turned the tie on its head in the early stages. An early Aubameyang effort that curled wide gave Klopp's side a warning and when the ball next found its way into the hosts' box, after a Liverpool attack broke down high on the left flank, there was no reprieve. Gonzalo Castro's flighted cross picked out Aubameyang and although his close-range volley was alertly parried by Simon Mignolet, Mkhitaryan tucked in the rebound. Sakho had played both Dortmund attackers onside and he was also at fault for the second goal as Aubameyang ran in behind him to collect Reus's delicately threaded pass and slam a shot into the top-right corner. Klopp had been bold in his team selection, bringing in Roberto Firmino for the injured Jordan Henderson, and while it left Liverpool light in central midfield, after the early shock had subsided they began to make chances. Origi, preferred up front to Daniel Sturridge, had a shot blocked and flicked a half-volley wide, Alberto Moreno miscued a volley, Adam Lallana produced an embarrassing air-kick and Firmino steered a header wide, while Coutinho saw a drilled effort deflect behind. Liverpool needed an early goal in the second half and they got it in the 48th minute, Emre Can exchanging passes with first James Milner and then Firmino before releasing Origi to prod his fourth goal in three games past Roman Weidenfeller. No sooner had the hosts closed in than Dortmund accelerated again, Mats Hummels taking Liverpool right-back Nathaniel Clyne out of the game with an exquisite pass and Reus nervelessly beating Mignolet. Coutinho reduced the arrears again with a low strike into the bottom-right corner before Sakho atoned for his earlier misdemeanours by bludgeoning a header into the net from Coutinho's corner. It set up a breathless climax that culminated in Croatian centre-back Lovren climbing at the back post to nod in Milner's cross from the right and set the seal on an unforgettable Anfield night."
536,13/04/2016,02:20,Dortmund blueprint serves Klopp in Liverpool rebuild,It was perhaps inevitable that Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool would produce their most Borussia Dortmund-like performance at the home of his former club.,"In last week's Europa League quarter-final first leg at the Westfalenstadion, Klopp watched his Liverpool players press and harry like the Dortmund team he steered to the highest echelon of the European game. If historical precedents are to be believed, the 1-1 final score gives Liverpool a 74 percent chance of progressing, and the nature of their display revealed the extent to which Klopp's methods have taken hold. ""I'm pretty sure a lot of people thought we would lose 2-0, 3-0 or 4-0,"" said Klopp, whose side tackle Dortmund at Anfield in Thursday's return leg. ""But at some moments we had Dortmund, and around our goal we were brilliant."" The sight of Klopp on the touchline -- squawking at his players, pumping his fist in celebration of Divock Origi's first-half goal -- will have been immediately familiar to Dortmund's fans, who granted him a touching send-off at the final whistle. So too the tactics employed by his team, whose aggressive, front-foot approach prevented the home side from settling into any kind of rhythm and whose counter-attacks kept the Dortmund rearguard on constant alert. While Dortmund have become more of a possession-based team under Klopp's successor, Thomas Tuchel -- the legacy of the new status his seven-year tenure left them with -- Liverpool are exhibiting the same underdog mentality upon which he built his success in the Ruhr valley. Speaking earlier this season, former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson said the team's best performances were ""reminiscent of Borussia Dortmund at their best under Jurgen Klopp"". Klopp readily bestowed trust upon the players he inherited at Dortmund, with seven of the 18 players he called up for his first game, a 3-2 win at Bayer Leverkusen in August 2008, featuring in the squad that faced Bayern Munich in the Champions League final five years later. He seems similarly determined to extract every ounce of quality from the Liverpool players at his disposal. The occasionally maligned centre-back pairing of Mamadou Sakho and Dejan Lovren performed with sturdy resolve in the first leg, while Origi is flourishing after a difficult start to his time at the club. ""He always believed in me and he believes in the group also,"" said the 20-year-old Belgian striker, who followed up his goal at Dortmund with a brace in Sunday's 4-1 defeat of Stoke City. ""The fact that I'm on the pitch gives me confidence and I just try to play my game and enjoy it."" Hard-working players like Adam Lallana, Emre Can and James Milner have also earned Klopp's trust and are striving to show that they can become to him what hardy perennials like Mats Hummels, Marcel Schmelzer and Jakub Blaszczykowski were at Dortmund. Milner, captain in the absence of the injured Jordan Henderson, is relishing the challenge of playing teams like Dortmund and Tottenham Hotspur, held 1-1 at Anfield recently, who play with a similar high-tempo approach. ""It's nice to keep getting the games,"" Milner said of Liverpool's busy schedule. ""They have been high-intensity games as well -- Dortmund and Spurs play at a high tempo. ""That's good for us as it keeps us at that intensity we want to play at. We know if we play at that intensity, that's when we have our best matches."" If Dortmund are to prove themselves worthy favourites for the trophy, Tuchel must find a way to withstand the red tide when the teams resume hostilities on Thursday. Dortmund's supporters will know exactly what is coming their way."
537,13/04/2016,02:15,Anfield return holds no fear for Dortmund,Borussia Dortmund have no qualms about coping with an electric Anfield atmosphere on Thursday when the German giants take on Liverpool in the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final.,"Divock Origi's away goal, later cancelled out by a Mats Hummels header in a 1-1 draw in Dortmund, put Liverpool in a favourable position as Jurgen Klopp made an emotional return to his former club. However, Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel is confident his side can reach the last four despite Liverpool's imposing home record against German opposition with the Reds unbeaten in 15 matches. ""We can score away goals too, and we can score more than one,"" said Tuchel, whose team effectively surrendered any hopes of chasing down Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga after twice conceding the lead in Sunday's 2-2 draw at Ruhr Valley rivals Schalke. ""We are not frightened. We have been to a lot of places and scored and won,"" he added, with Dortmund unbeaten in 18 games since the turn of the year. Liverpool midfielder James Milner though is counting on the Anfield faithful to spur on the home side as they continue their quest for a 12th European trophy, three of which have come in this competition. ""Any player wants to play in the big games and the best atmospheres. European nights at Anfield are definitely right up there with anywhere on the planet,"" Milner told the club's official website. ""That's going to be massively important for us no matter what happens. Even if the worst happens and they get an early goal, (the fans) can roar us on to get back into the game. ""We managed to nullify their fans - which is a great atmosphere as well - and got a good result. Hopefully we can use our atmosphere."" Liverpool will likely be without captain Jordan Henderson for the rest of the season after the England international injured his knee during the first leg at the Westfalenstadion. Sevilla can move a step closer towards a third successive title when they host La Liga rivals Athletic Bilbao, with the holders leading 2-1 from the first leg. Veteran striker Aritz Aduriz headed Athletic in front with his competition-leading ninth goal at San Mames, but goals from Timothee Kolodziejczak and Vicente Iborra put Sevilla in control after their first away win in Europe this season. Four-time champions Sevilla are on a record run of 11 straight home victories in the Europa League, while Unai Emery's men beat Athletic 2-0 when the sides met in the league in January. Cedric Bakambu continued his excellent debut season with Villarreal, scoring both goals in a 2-1 win at home to Sparta Prague last week. The Democratic Republic of Congo striker struck again in Sunday's 2-0 victory over to Getafe to keep Villarreal on course for next season's Champions League and the Spaniards will look to him once more to fire them into the semi-finals in the Czech Republic. Shakhtar Donetsk, the 2009 UEFA Cup champions, are in the driving seat in their tie against 2011 runners-up Braga after a 2-1 victory in Portugal. However, the Ukrainian outfit suffered a costly blow to their domestic title hopes at the weekend after conceding an injury-time equaliser in a 3-3 draw at Stal Dniprodzerzhynsk to fall five points behind leaders Dynamo Kiev.

538,10/04/2016,17:39,Dortmund's draw at Schalke puts Bayern on verge of title,"Shinji Kagawa's superb chip was not enough to prevent Borussia Dortmund drawing 2-2 at Schalke on Sunday, edging Bayern Munich towards a historic fourth straight Bundesliga title.","The draw in Gelsenkirchen leaves Pep Guardiola's Bayern seven points clear of second-placed Dortmund with five games left. The Bavarians are hoping to become the first club to win the Bundesliga title four years in a row. ""It is very likely that Bayern will be champions,"" conceded Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel. The Borussia boss gambled by resting star forwards Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Marco Reus and Henrikh Mkhitaryan from his starting line-up, but was pleased with the point. Borussia play Liverpool away on Thursday in the Europa League quarter-final return leg at Anfield, after the first match ended in a 1-1 draw. The game at Schalke's Veltins-Arena burst into life after a goalless first half when Japan midfielder Kagawa put Dortmund ahead with a perfectly-timed chip over Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann on 49 minutes. Schalke equalised two minutes later when German junior international Leroy Sane, who has been linked with Manchester City, smashed home his shot. Sloppy defending allowed Dortmund to go back in front when Schalke's Roman Neustaedter was out-jumped by Matthias Ginter from a free-kick and the defender headed home on 56 minutes. There was plenty of bite in the derby between the neighbouring clubs, who are only 50kms apart. Dortmund defender Sokratis brought down Klaas-Jan Huntelaar in the area on 66 minutes and the Dutch striker nailed the spot kick. Denmark midfielder Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg, on loan to Schalke from Bayern, was lucky to escape with only a yellow card when he hacked down Mkhitaryan in the 71st minute. Schalke replacement Max Meyer had the chance to win the game in added time but he fired over the bar with the goal at his mercy. Dortund's 68 points from 29 league games is a club record for this stage of the season, although Bayern have 75 while the draw leaves Schalke seventh, just outside the European places. In 49 of the last 52 Bundesliga seasons, Dortmund's tally would have been enough to win the title outright with a month still left. Bayern are bidding to repeat their 2013 treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup titles in Guardiola's swansong before taking over as Manchester City manager. The Bavarians play Benfica away in the Champions League quarter-final return leg on Wednesday, holding a slender 1-0 lead from the first match in Munich. Mexico striker Javier Hernandez scored his 16th league goal of the season in Bayer Leverkusen's 2-0 win at Cologne in the Rhine derby. The victory lifted Leverkusen to fourth and into the Champions League places for next season. After junior Germany international Julian Brandt put Leverkusen ahead, 'Chicharito' slotted home from close range just before the break. There was a bad-tempered end during the seven minutes of added time as Cologne's Leonardo Bittencourt was sent off for bringing down Swiss striker Admir Mehmedi. In the heated exchanges immediately after, Leverkusen's Brazil defender Wendell was shown a second yellow card, and subsequent red, for grabbing a Cologne player by the throat. Bayern and Dortmund have already qualified from the Bundesliga for next season's Champions League. But Hertha Berlin, Leverkusen, Borussia Moenchengladbach, Mainz and Schalke are all fighting for third place, which carries a direct place, while fourth carries a play-off place."
539,09/04/2016,18:49,Bayern win Benfica warm up to go eight points clear,Bayern Munich warmed up for Wednesday's crucial Champions League quarter-final at Benfica with a 3-1 win at Stuttgart on Saturday to maintain their iron-grip on the Bundesliga title race with five games left.,"An own goal from Stuttgart defender Georg Niedermeier and a second-half David Alaba strike put Pep Guardiola's Bayern 2-0 up. Daniel Didavi pulled a goal back for Stuttgart with an hour gone as he recovered from stumbling in the area to chip home while lying on the floor before Brazil winger Douglas Costa blasted in Bayern's late third. The win gave Bayern three more points in their quest to become the first club to win four successive German league titles ahead of their return leg in Benfica with Bayern holding a 1-0 lead. ""Now we need three more (league) wins and a draw in order to create something that no team in Germany has ever managed,"" said Guardiola. Bayern's head coach made five changes from the side which beat Benfica in Munich last Tuesday, but Thomas Mueller came on with only 25 minutes gone to replace Arturo Vidal. The Chilean picked up a rash yellow card for a foul on Didavi and came off as Guardiola looked to boost his midfield. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund at arch-rivals Schalke on Sunday in the Ruhr Valley derby, Bayern took their chance to go eight points clear. But having won their preceding three games by 1-0 margins, this was another laboured display from the Bavarians at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena. ""We had a lot of problems, we attacked well, but we were a bit too lazy and gave away free-kicks and corners,"" added Guardiola. ""We made life complicated for ourselves, but after taking the lead we improved, espcially in the second half, attacking better and the strikers moved more."" Bayern took the lead when Franck Ribery's cross clipped Niedermeier's boot on the way into the Stuttgart net on 31 minutes and the visitors extended their lead when Alaba fired inside the near post on 52 minutes. Mid-table Stuttgart got back in the game when attacking midfielder Didavi, who will play for Wolfsburg next season, managed to lob Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. The goal came despite Didavi being flat on the turf, when the ball fell into his path after a mistimed clearance by Munich striker Robert Lewandowski. In the final ten minutes, Bayern's Thiago hit the crossbar before Costa smashed in their third goal from the edge of the area. Borussia Moenchengladbach stay fourth despite their 1-0 defeat at Ingolstadt. At the bottom, Hoffenheim, coached by 28-year-old Julian Nagelsmann, the youngest ever coach in Germany's top flight, are now three points clear of the relegation places after their 2-0 win at second from bottom Eintracht Frankfurt. Midfielder Nadiem Amiri, who netted just a minute after coming off the bench, and forward Mark Uth scored their second-half goals. Under Nagelsmann, Hoffenheim have now taken 17 points in their last nine games to climb out of the bottom three to 14th. Augsburg escaped the bottom three, and dropped opponents Werder Bremen into the relegation places, with a 2-1 win in north Germany as South Korea defender Hong Jeong-Ho scored their dramatic 87th-minute winner. Mid-table Darmstadt enjoyed a 2-1 win at Hamburg while on Friday Hertha Berlin were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bottom side Hanover."
540,08/04/2016,02:45,Borussia boss warns Bayern ahead of Stuttgart derby,Borussia Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has warned Bayern Munich that his team is ready to pounce in the Bundesliga title race should Pep Guardiola's leaders slip up at Stuttgart on Saturday.,"With only six games left, the Bavarian giants are five points clear of second-placed Dortmund but face a tricky tie at Stuttgart in the south Germany derby. Guardiola's side has shown signs of fatigue in recent weeks. They laboured to a 1-0 win over Benfica in the Champions League on Tuesday on the back of a workmanlike 1-0 victory over relegation-threatened Eintracht Frankfurt in the league. ""Bayern have to go to Stuttgart and that won't be a friendly game,"" said Watzke, indulging in some mind games certain to annoy Bayern's bosses. ""Bayern need to make sure they give nothing more away this season, otherwise we will certainly be there (to take advantage)."" Likewise, Dortmund must keep winning to stand any chance of a first league title since 2012 and they are at arch-rivals Schalke on Sunday in the Ruhr Valley derby. Bayern are bidding to come the first German club to win four straight Bundesliga titles, having won the league at a canter for the last three seasons. But Watzke is pleased that Dortmund still have even a remote chance of breaking the Bavarians' monopoly. ""At this stage of the season in recent years, it's all been decided. At least now we are forcing Bayern into keep producing top performances,"" he added, with Dortmund seeking to keep the pressure up until the final league weekend on May 14. In Stuttgart, Bayern will be without Dutch winger Arjen Robben, who has not played since mid-March because of a groin injury. ""I am working on my return, but there is no schedule,"" he told magazine Kicker. And France winger Kingsley Coman struggled in Wednesday's training session after a leg knock. Stuttgart will be without Ivory Coast midfielder Serey Die, who will miss the rest of the season with a torn groin. Guardiola is set to rotate his squad to keep his stars fresh for Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal, second leg, at Benfica as the Bavarians take their slender 1-0 lead to Portugal. After he sat out Thursday's 1-1 draw at home to Liverpool with a foot injury, Dortmund's Ilkay Gundogan is doubtful for Sunday's derby against Schalke. Roman Buerki is set to return as goalkeeper having sat out their European matches. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel will want to rest some of his stars before the Europa League quarter-final return leg at Anfield next Thursday. After a fresh shoulder injury, Schalke will be without midfielder Leon Goretzka, leaving Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg to take his place for the Royal Blues. On Friday, third-placed Hertha Berlin have a good chance of securing a confidence-boosting win over Hanover 96 to ease the pain of last Sunday's thumping 5-0 defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Fresh from their stunning 2-0 win over Real Madrid at home on Tuesday in the Champions League, Wolfsburg host Mainz on Saturday night looking to bring their European form to Germany's top flight. Dieter Hecking's Wolfsburg are winless in their last three league matches, but will want to rest their top performers ahead of next Tuesday's crucial return leg at the Bernebau. But sixth placed Mainz are no push-overs and they are the only team to have won at Bayern's Allianz Arena this season when they poached a 2-1 victory last month.

541,08/04/2016,01:45,Klopp looks forward to Dortmund 'spice' night at Anfield,Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool's 1-1 draw at his ex-club Borussia Dortmund had spiced up their Europa League quarter-final and predicts Anfield will light up for next Thursday's return leg.,"Klopp's Reds grabbed a precious away goal when Liverpool striker Divock Origi netted in the first half before Dortmund captain Mats Hummels equalised with a bullet header. ""Now there's a real bit of spice in the tie, Anfield will be on fire, but we haven't got the feeling we're through,"" said Klopp, who produced his trademark pumped-fist sideline celebration when Origi scored. ""Dortmund is a pretty good side and everyone could see that, but we had our moments and we could have won the game. ""I'm fairly sure a lot of people thought we would lose two, three or four-nil, but at some moments we had Dortmund under pressure and around our goal we were brilliant."" ""Things could have gone worse and all in all it was good a good result from our perspective. Around the time we went 1-0 up, we really showed what we can do."" On his much-hyped return to Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park stadium, Klopp received a warm welcome having walked away last May after seven years as Borussia coach. During his reign, Dortmund won the 2011 Bundesliga title, the club's first league and cup double in 2012 and reached the 2013 Champions League final. His name received a loud cheer from the home fans when it was read out before kick-off and he hugged Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke on the halfway line during the warm-up. ""It was nice. A lot of people had talked about me coming back, but when I came onto the pitch it was respectful applause and that's nice,"" he added. ""That's how it should be."" But Dortmund were left to rue their missed opportunities as Marco Reus and then Henrikh Mkhitaryan failed to convert clear first-half chances. ""We didn't play that well. The goal we conceded was a bit too easy. In the end, the draw was a fair result,"" said Hummels. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel said his side had not played the carefree football he had hoped for. ""Perhaps we gave them a few too many instructions before the game. We seemed too preoccupied,"" said Tuchel. ""I had hoped we'd play with a few more smiles on a few lips."" Klopp's Liverpool will start next Thursday's return leg at Anfield as favourites to reach the semi-finals. ""We'll lay out a plan for the Liverpool game to turn the result in our favour,"" said Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who pulled off a great second-half save to deny Philippe Coutinho. ""It was clear to us that it wouldn't be an easy game and so it proved, we didn't start well."" Liverpool deserved to take something from the away leg and left-winger James Milner put in a strong display as a marauding menace to the Dortmund midfield. ""We came here to get the win and we did well today,"" said Liverpool's Germany defender Emre Can. ""A 1-1 draw is a good result, but the chance of going through is still only 50-50. ""It is very difficult to play against Dortmund, but we repeatedly made headway in their defence."""
542,07/04/2016,23:23,"Klopp's Liverpool hold Dortmund, champions Sevilla win",Liverpool claimed an excellent 1-1 draw with Borussia Dortmund in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final on Thursday as Jurgen Klopp made an emotional return to the Westfalenstadion.,"The game marked Klopp's first coming together with his former club since his departure last summer and subsequent appointment by Liverpool back in October. He saw Divock Origi put the Premier League side in front in the 36th minute before Mats Hummels equalised for the hosts three minutes into the second half. However, that away goal means Liverpool have the upper hand ahead of next Thursday's second leg at Anfield and Klopp will be confident his side can progress to the last four after an encouraging display in Germany. ""Dortmund's a pretty good side. Everybody could see that but we had our moments and we could have won the game,"" Klopp told BT Sport. A rousing rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone' -- the Liverpool hymn that is also a Dortmund anthem -- preceded kick-off as Klopp took in the scene at the stadium where he is still idolised after a highly successful seven years as coach. ""It was respectful, nice and how it should be,"" Klopp said of his welcome. But perhaps the emotion of the occasion got to the Bundesliga team because they were unable to repeat their superb performance in tearing Tottenham Hotspur apart in the last round. Their 36-goal leading scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was subdued and they were denied an opener when Mamadou Sakho bravely blocked a Henrikh Mkhitaryan shot. Dejan Lovren should have done better than head straight at Roman Weidenfeller at the other end but Origi put the visitors in front when he held off his marker and slotted low past the 'keeper after latching onto a Jordan Henderson flick. Weidenfeller prevented Origi from scoring again just before the interval and Dortmund drew level shortly after the restart, captain Hummels rising above Adam Lallana to head in a Mkhitaryan cross. Weidenfeller saved well from Philippe Coutinho and the final scoreline means the tie remains up for grabs, even if Liverpool have the edge. Meanwhile, holders Sevilla remain on course to win the trophy for the third season running after coming from behind to win 2-1 away to Spanish rivals Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of their tie. Sevilla have not won away from home all season in La Liga and, after a goalless first half in which Aritz Aduriz hit the post for the hosts, they went behind in the 48th minute. Iker Muniain crossed and the evergreen Aduriz headed in his 32nd goal of a remarkable campaign. But as the rain lashed down in the Basque Country, Sevilla silenced San Mames when Ever Banega pounced on a short headed back-pass by Muniain and set up Timothee Kolodziejczak to score. Kevin Gameiro then set up substitute Vicente Iborra to give Sevilla the win seven minutes from time and leave beaten 2012 finalists Athletic up against it ahead of the return leg. One Spanish side is guaranteed to make the last four and Villarreal hope to be there too after beating Sparta Prague of the Czech Republic 2-1 at El Madrigal. Cedric Bakambu got both goals for the hosts, charging down a clearance by goalkeeper David Bicik for the early opener and then scoring the winner in the second half after Jakub Brabec had headed Sparta's equaliser. Meanwhile Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk, the 2009 UEFA Cup winners, are in the driving seat in their tie against Braga after a 2-1 victory in Portugal. Yaroslav Rakitskiy fired Shakhtar ahead on the stroke of half-time and Facundo Ferreyra increased their lead before Wilson Eduardo grabbed a potentially vital goal for 2011 runners-up Braga late on."
543,07/04/2016,22:50,Klopp unable to walk alone on Dortmund return,"Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp received a rapturous, emotional welcome on his return to Borussia Dortmund on Thursday, the occasion marked by a spine-tingling rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone'.","Around 65,000 fans of both teams filled the air in the Westfalenstadion with the stirring hymn marking a fitting return for Klopp who spent seven seasons at the Bundesliga club before leaving for Anfield last year. A smiling Klopp warmly greeted his former players as they prepared for the Europa League quarter-final, first leg clash. 'Kloppo' also smilingly saluted the Yellow Wall of Dortmund fans, banked high behind the goal on the famous south terrace. ""It's a very special moment. I can't be unmoved by it,"" the 48-year-old coach told Sky of a club where he was in charge from 2008 to 2015. However, he admitted it was strange walking into the visitors dressing room rather than the home side's. ""I didn't know what they looked like,"" he smiled although he had been there before -- back in his days as coach of fellow Bundesliga team Mainz, where he worked between 2001 and 2008. ""I only had to remind myself when I came in right, instead of left for the dressing room,"" he told BT Sport. Once 'You'll Never Walk Alone' -- performed movingly inside the cavernous arena -- was completed, the track-suited Klopp embraced his successor Thomas Tuchel as a huge group of photographers camped in front of the dug-out. The return of Klopp to Dortmund for the first time has dominated sports news in Germany all week. It even rivalled Wolfsburg's stunning 2-0 win over Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday on television bulletins and websites. ""All the stories around, maybe the media created it a little bit but not a Dortmund player or manager or Liverpool player or manager,"" Klopp added to BT Sport. ""For the team it is not a big difference, the team only has to think about what it has to do in the game. Dortmund are pretty good, that's the truth, but they are beatable. The most difficult thing is they are full, full, full of confidence."""
544,03/04/2016,14:00,All eyes on Liverpool for Dortmund's 'Jurgen Klopp derby',"Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel says his team's confidence is sky-high for Thursday's Europa League quarter-final, first-leg, at home to Liverpool in what has been dubbed the 'Jurgen Klopp derby'.","The Liverpool manager enjoyed seven stellar years at Signal Iduna Park and can expect a warm welcomed in Dortmund, ahead of the return leg at Anfield on April 17. Klopp steered Dortmund to the Bundesliga title in 2011, the league and cup double in 2012 and the 2013 Champions League final, but walked away at the end of last season when they finished seventh in Germany's top flight. Tuchel, his successor, has given Dortmund fresh impetus and they are second only to Bayern Munich in Germany this season. Winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan is enjoying a stellar season alongside Germany star Marco Reus and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who has scored 23 league goals, to form a trio which has netted 43 times in the Bundesliga. But it was super subs Shinji Kagawa and Adrian Ramos who netted late goals in Dortmund's 3-2 fight-back win over Werder Bremen on Saturday as they warmed up for Liverpool. The win, which secured Dortmund's place in the Champions League next season, was down to their 'diligence and attitude', according to Tuchel, while Klopp dubbed Borussia's gritty team 'monsters of mentality' during his reign. ""To come from behind and stay calm showed a great reaction from the team,"" said Tuchel. ""It's an extra quality to have someone like Ramos who can come on, but it is a testament to all the players how intensive our training sessions are. ""My players are setting the standard in terms of attitude and diligence. ""Due to the number and type of our victories this season (36 wins in 46 games in all competitions), the team has developed a great confidence. ""I didn't get the feeling that the Liverpool game was a factor, but from now on we'll be concerning ourselves with the 'Reds'."" Tuchel had his three first-choice centre-backs missing against Bremen with Neven Subotic injured, Sokratis ill and Mats Hummels rested. Nevertheless, Aubameyang opened the scoring in the second-half before Kagawa put them level and Ramos headed the late winner after Bremen had gone 2-1 up on 74 minutes thanks to an own goal from Gonzalo Castro and a neat strike from Zlatko Junuzovic. While Tuchel was not talking about Klopp's return, Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke certainly was and he says his friendship with the Liverpool manager will be put aside until the final whistle. ""We will be clear opponents on Thursday, there is no need for mucking around in a friendship,"" Watzke told broadcaster ZDF. ""My concern is that he will bring the (home) fans to his side and create a atmosphere like you get in a friendly."""
545,02/04/2016,21:04,Dortmund chief pours cold water on Goetze rumours,Borussia Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke has scotched rumours Bayern Munich's unhappy Germany forward Mario Goetze could return to the 2013 Champions League finalists at the end of the season.,"The 23-year-old Goetze made a rare start in Germany's 4-1 thumping of Italy on Tuesday at Munich's Allianz Arena then played in Bayern's 1-0 home win over Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. But the World Cup winner has now started just six of Bayern's league games this season. He is struggling for match time under Bayern coach Pep Guardiola after a four-month absence with a groin injury. Goetze has been linked to Liverpool, and a reunion with his ex-Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, or a return to Borussia's Signal Iduna Park, but Watzke ruled out the latter - for now. ""Mario is a player at Bayern. He's there until 2017 and I have heard from neither him nor his club that either want to end the cooperation,"" Watzke told magazine Sportbild. ""It would be completely disrespectful if we talked about a player who is under contract at Bayern. ""This isn't a topic for us at the moment."" But Watzke foresaw that Goetze would be linked to Dortmund, who he left in 2013 for 37 million euros ($41.8m), given the Germany star's lengthy spells on Bayern's bench. ""It's been clear to me for a while, that this topic would eventually come out,"" Watzke told daily newspaper Die Welt. Germany's head coach Joachim Loew has advised Goetze to talk to Bayern Munich's incoming coach Carlo Ancelotti, who will replace Manchester City-bound Guardiola, about his future in Munich. Goetze has said he just wants to play and repeatedly brushed off questions about his future. He played a large part in Bayern's goal against Frankfurt on Saturday at the Allianz Arena with a superb run through the heart of the Eintracht defence on 20 minutes. His shot was blocked, but Franck Ribery volleyed home the rebound. Goetze was taken off on 85 minutes, but earned praise from Guardiola. ""I'm satisfied with his performance. It is not easy when a player doesn't play so often, but we need him for the remaining weeks of the season,"" said Guardiola. But reports from Munich suggest Goetze has doubts over his future with the Bavarian giants having failed to nail down a place in the starting team after three years under Guardiola."
546,01/04/2016,02:30,Bayern feel Dortmund's pressure in title race,Bayern Munich midfielder Sebastian Rode says Pep Guardiola's side can ill afford any slip-ups in the Bundesliga title race against his former club Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday.,"Bayern host relegation-threatened Frankfurt and Rode insists the Bavarians have not given a second's thought to playing Benfica at home four days later in the Champions League quarter-final, first leg. Bayern are five points ahead of Borussia Dortmund with seven games left, but second-from-bottom Frankfurt are desperate for points. ""We have Dortmund breathing down our necks and there has not been one second to think about Benfica,"" said Rode, who joined Bayern from Frankfurt in 2014. ""First of all we have to take care of things against Eintracht Frankfurt."" Rode may well face his former club as Guardiola looks to rest some of his midfield stars ahead of their European match. Bayern were held to a goalless draw at Frankfurt in October and a similar result could be enough to take Niko Kovac's side out of the bottom three. Bayern have not conceded against Frankfurt in their last seven meetings. No Bundesliga team have ever gone eight straight games without conceding to the same opponents. It remains to be seen whether Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is fit after he missed Germany's 4-1 thumping of Italy on Tuesday with an upset stomach. Second-placed Dortmund on Sunday host Werder Bremen, who have picked up eight points from their last five games to move out of the relegation zone. Thomas Tuchel's Dortmund are unbeaten in their 15 competitive games in 2016, winning 13 and drawing two. Gabonese striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has not scored in his last three league outings, but did score three goals over the two legs of the Europa League last-16 clash with Tottenham Hotspur. He is looking to add to his tally of 22 Bundesliga goals this season as he battles with Bayern's Robert Lewandowski, who has netted 25 times, to be the league's top scorer. Dortmund want a win in their final game before ex-coach Jurgen Klopp brings his Liverpool team to Signal Iduna Park for their Europa League quarter-final, first leg. Wolfsburg, who host Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-final, first leg on Wednesday, face a tricky tie at Bayer Leverkusen on Friday. Leverkusen have won their last two games, while Wolfsburg have lost to strugglers Hoffenheim and needed a late goal to draw with Darmstadt, since beating Gent in the last 16 of the Champions League to set up their high-profile clash with Real. A win for either club would help their European ambitions for next season. Both clubs are chasing a Champions League place for next season, with Leverkusen two points behind fourth-placed Schalke, and last season's runners-up Wolfsburg four points further adrift in eighth. Leverkusen's Chile international Charles Aranguiz could make his debut having missed all of the season so far after tearing his Achilles tendon last August, shortly after signing from Brazilian club Internacional. Third-placed Hertha Berlin, who are on the verge of a first appearance in the Champions League since 1999/2000, face a tough trip to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday. Hertha are four points clear of the chasing pack having won four of their last five games, with strikers Salomon Kalou and Vedad Ibisevic having claimed 21 league goals between them this term. Gladbach's form of late has been erratic with two wins and two defeats. They are six points behind the Berliners and their hopes of a second straight appearance in the Champions League may well be decided by this fixture.

547,30/03/2016,19:25,Dortmund tie 'incredibly difficult' - Klopp,"Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is more worried about former club Borussia Dortmund's on-pitch threat than any mixed emotions he will feel when facing them, he said on Wednesday.","Klopp will go up against Dortmund in a two-legged Europa League quarter-final beginning next week, having left the club at the end of last season following a richly successful seven-year spell. It promises to be a unique occasion for the 48-year-old German, but with Dortmund currently second in the Bundesliga and Liverpool ninth in the Premier League, he is not thinking about sentiment. ""It's not going to be an inner battle between my old and my new love,"" Klopp said, in comments published on the Liverpool website. ""It won't be a problem for me. Before I joined BVB, I had a good relationship with (former club) Mainz. ""We are all aware how incredibly difficult this draw is for us. The way Dortmund plays commands enormous respect. But on a good day and when (we) put our plan into action, we have a chance. ""We always had a relatively good plan against teams who play football well. We will not rest anyone."" Dortmund crushed Liverpool's domestic rivals Tottenham Hotspur 5-1 on aggregate in the last 16, while Klopp's side overcame arch rivals Manchester United 3-1. Liverpool travel to Dortmund for the first leg of the quarter-final on April 7, with the return leg taking place at Anfield a week later."

""Our goal was to get Christian Pulisic some minutes,"" US coach Jurgen Klinsmann was quoted on the Bundesliga.com website. ""Even in his limited minutes you could see the talent he has."" Pulisic, who will only turn 18 in September, has made four appearances for Dortmund in Germany's top flight including his January debut. He is now no longer eligible to represent Croatia, where his grandfather was born, after his USA debut. ""Truly blessed to make my USMNT debut! Great win for the team!"" Pulisic wrote on his Twitter account. The USA are second in Group C of their World Cup qualifying group, three points behind Trinidad and Tobago with two games left to play, at home to St Vincent and the Grenadines and away to the group leaders."

Goetze, whose goal sealed Germany's win in the 2014 World Cup final, has failed to hold down a first-team place at Bayern in the last three years. He has made just eight league appearance in an injury-ravaged campaign under Guardiola this season. Even though his groin injury, which kept him out from October until February, has healed, Bayern boss Guardiola has left him out for key Bundesliga and Champions League games, fuelling speculation of Goetze's return to Dortmund. But Loew said Goetze remains very much part of his plans for Euro 2016, from June 10-July 10, as the Germany squad prepares for Saturday's home friendlies against England in Berlin, and against Italy in Munich four days later. ""I can understand the situation at Bayern, to an extent, from afar,"" said Loew on Wednesday. ""Mario has long been injured this season and there have been very, very important matches. ""I've noticed in training that, in regards to his fitness and form, Mario isn't yet where he was before his injury. ""You can see he's lacking match practice, but I will definitely count on him for the European championships. ""It's always worth it to support Mario, because he can do things which other players can't do."" Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has refused to comment on Bild's claim Borussia want their former play-maker back. ""From our perspective, there is nothing to say,"" he told SID, an AFP subsidiary. ""I have absolutely no desire to be part of the speculation."" Goetze has said his sole desire is to be playing again and hopes to speak to Bayern's in-coming coach Carlo Ancelotti, who will replace Guardiola next season, about his future."

551,21/03/2016,13:02,Hungary coach Storck extends deal to 2018,"Hungary's German coach Bernd Storck has extended his contract until 2018 after steering the team into Euro 2016, the Magyars' first qualification for a major tournament in 30 years, the Hungarian football association (MLSZ) said Monday.","Previously, the MLSZ had said Storck, 53, the third of three coaches during the Euro 2016 qualification campaign, would remain until the end of the tournament which takes place in France from June 10 to July 10. But MLSZ president Sandor Csanyi told a press conference that with ""stability and order achieved, the FA has decided before the European Championship to extend Storck's contract to June 30, 2018."" ""The World Cup qualifiers start in September, this is also why we decided that Mr Storck should stay, as if another coach was appointed, there would be no time for getting to know the team,"" Csanyi added. Storck took over as coach in mid-2015 after his predecessor Pal Dardai cut short his contract to work exclusively for Bundesliga side Hertha Berlin. The ex-Kazakhstan coach and player for Borussia Dortmund in the 1980s previously won plaudits for taking Hungary to the last 16 at the FIFA U20 World Cup last June. The contract of Storck's assistant, former German international and World Cup winner Andreas Moller, has also been extended. Hungary's last qualification for a major international tournament was for the 1986 World Cup."
552,20/03/2016,19:31,Ramos helps seal Dortmund comeback win,Second-placed Borussia Dortmund trimmed Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the Bundesliga to five points on Sunday with a superb 3-1 comeback win at Augsburg.,"Dortmund's Adrian Ramos, in for striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who sat out after the death of his grandfather, played a big part in turning the game Borussia's way in the second-half. Augsburg took an shock lead at their WKK Arena when Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason slotted home Brazilian winger Caiuby's cross on 16 minutes. But Dortmund winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan dragged his side back into the game with an equaliser just before the half-time whistle after superb passing from Marco Reus and Nuri Sahin. Ramos then came into his own, showing great skill in chesting down Mats Hummels' long ball for replacement Gonzalo Castro to fire home on 69 minutes. The Colombia international then netted on 75 minutes to give Dortmund the three points that keep them in touch with Pep Guardiola's Bayern. The defeat leaves Augsburg just above the relegation places on goal difference. Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen rejoined the fight for a Champions League qualifying berth with a 2-0 win at VfB Stuttgart that saw them break back into the top six. Goals by Julian Brandt and Karim Bellarabi handed Leverkusen a win that put them level on points with fifth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach and two points behind Schalke, who sit in the fourth place that offers a spot in next season's Champions League play-offs. Germany Under-21 star Brandt gave the vistors the lead at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena on 11 minutes when he finished off a flowing attack. Bellarabi celebrated his call-up to the Germany squad for the forthcoming internationals against England and Italy by adding Leverkusen's second on 49 minutes. Brandt, 19, could have claimed his second of the game, but his shot hit the post when he got away from the Stuttgart defence with an hour gone. On Saturday, Robert Lewandowski's 25th league goal of the season gave leaders Bayern Munich a 1-0 win at Cologne. Hertha Berlin remain on course to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1999/2000 after a 2-1 victory over Ingolstadt in the capital kept them four points clear of Schalke in third. Wolfsburg, who will face Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals next month, needed a last-minute Andre Schuerrle equaliser to grab a 1-1 draw at home to Darmstadt as they stay eighth. In the battle to avoid relegation, Hoffenheim claimed a precious 3-1 win at Hamburg, while Eintracht Frankfurt beat Hanover 96 1-0 to leave their opponents 10 points adrift at the bottom."
553,19/03/2016,02:05,Klopp eyes special finale to debut season,Jurgen Klopp has targeted a special end to his first season in charge of Liverpool as the Reds head to Southampton on Sunday in buoyant mood.,"March has been an excellent month for Klopp's side, who have responded positively since ending February with a League Cup final defeat on penalties against Manchester City. Premier League wins over City and Crystal Palace have been accompanied by the sweet sensation of a Europa League last 16 victory over bitter rivals Manchester United. It means Klopp has a European quarter-final against his former club Borussia Dortmund to look forward to in April, but first comes the task of finishing this month unbeaten. Liverpool's last trip to Southampton brought arguably their best away performance of the season, with a 6-1 victory in the League Cup quarter-finals in December. Since then, Klopp's side have struggled for consistency, but they have won their last three league matches, scoring 11 goals and conceding just once in the process. It means that they go into the weekend in eighth place, seven points from the fourth and final Champions League qualification spot. ""Could we do something special this season? The only thing I can say is that I hope so,"" Klopp said. ""We have not always been perfect over the last few weeks, but we have been more than OK. We have to carry on in this way. ""If we collect enough points, then we have to see what will happen. For now, there is only Southampton to think about, and then we have a two-week international break."" The creative spark of Philippe Coutinho attracted plenty of attention after his excellent run and finish brought the away goal that effectively took Liverpool past United in the Europa League on Thursday. However, Dejan Lovren also deserved credit for a solid and commanding display in central defence. Lovren has not always convinced since his move from Southampton to Liverpool in 2014, but appears to be growing in confidence under Klopp's management. ""What can I say about Dejan Lovren? I heard about before I came here, and I saw in his eyes when I came here, that he was not in the best situation,"" Klopp said. ""Sometimes for players, that's the good thing with a complete change -- that you can start really new, and that's what he did. ""Now everybody can see what he is capable of. Dejan is in a good way."" Left-back Alberto Moreno will be assessed before Sunday's match, having missed the 1-1 Europa League draw at Old Trafford with a hamstring injury sustained during training the previous evening. Southampton's need for victory is just as great as Liverpool's with Ronald Koeman's side positioned one place above Klopp's with only goal difference separating the two teams. Victory at Stoke last time out ended a run of three successive defeats and Koeman is in no doubt his side need a repeat of they are to maintain their hopes of qualifying for next season's Europa League. ""We knew our situation before the Stoke City game. It was a must-win game and I think the same is for this weekend, because we know the position in the table,"" Koeman said. ""We know the points and if we're still fighting for Europe I think we have to win. ""We spoke to the players about the schedule and this is the last one before the international break and, of course, if you get a win against Liverpool that makes a big step forward."" Jose Fonte and Victor Wanyama return to the Southampton squad after suspension, but striker Jay Rodriguez will remain with the club's under-21 side while he continues to recover from a foot injury."
554,18/03/2016,14:04,Back to Dortmund for Klopp as Liverpool draw Borussia,Jurgen Klopp will head back to Dortmund for the Europa League quarter-finals after his Liverpool side were drawn with former club Borussia on Friday.,"Three-time champions Liverpool, who previously won the competition in 1973, 1976 and 2001, will travel to Dortmund for the first leg of the quarter on April 7. Their last Europa victory in 2001 ironically came at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. Klopp, who left Germany in July 2015, led Dortmund to the 2013 Champions League final, one of the highlights of his seven years in charge of the Bundesliga club alongside a domestic double in 2012. ""It is very exciting to see Kloppo again,"" said Dortmund defender Neven Subotic. ""I trained with him for nine years and he has done very well there - he has changed the team - and I'm obviously excited to play against his new team. It's definitely going to be nice to see him again."" Four-time winners Sevilla, seeking a third Europa League title in three years, face a Spanish derby against Athletic Bilbao, the clubs placed fifth and sixth in La Liga meeting for the first time in Europe. ""I'm not happy with the draw because we wanted to avoid a Spanish side,"" said Sevilla technical director Monchi. ""We're going to play a real in-form side. We will have to fight all the way to progress. Both sides are fighting for the same thing in the league and the tie will be decided by little details."" The draw was rounded off with 2009 champions Shakhtar Donetsk to face Sporting Praga of Portugal while Villarreal are to take on Sparta Prague, the latter two clubs having never played each other before. ""We have avoided the Spanish sides, which is something we wanted to do,"" admitted Villarreal official Marcos Senna. ""We have to admit we're happy with the draw. We have played against two very strong sides (Napoli and Bayer Leverkusen) to get here. There're no easy opponents and the fact our opponents have got to this stage shows their strength."""
555,14/03/2016,12:50,German FA boss touched by reaction to fan's death,German FA interim president Reinhard Rauball admits being touched by the compassion shown by football fans in Dortmund after a fan died during a Bundesliga match on Sunday.,"Borussia Dortmund's 2-0 home win over Mainz at their Signal Iduna Park stadium was overshadowed after a 79-year-old collapsed with a suspected heart attack in the south stand and died, despite efforts to revive him, during the first-half. In a separate emergency, a 55-year-old also collapsed, but was revived on the way to hospital. The game was played afterwards in near silence as fans in the sold-out 81,000 crowd showed their respect. ""In the name of Borussia Dortmund, I particularly want to thank all the spectators for the sensitivity they showed,"" wrote Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke on the club's home page. After the final whistle, the Dortmund team gathered in front of the club's iconic south stand as the home fans sang an emotional rendition of the club's anthem ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" in a spontaneous gesture of respect. ""The news circulated quickly via WhatsApp and social media and the news reached the whole stadium, including those from Mainz,"" said Rauball, who is also Dortmund's club president. ""I have never experienced something like that before, where the fans have show such dignity, their humanity and marked their grief. It was unspeakably beautiful. ""I'm happy to criticise the fans when they cross the line, but on this occasion they deserve a compliment in the highest terms. ""The honour they showed, with such a feeling for what is appropriate, could not have been expressed better."" Rauball says the eery atmosphere in the stadium reminded him of what it was like in the Stade de France after the Paris terror attacks of last November 13 following Germany's international friendly. ""Moments like that bring those memories back up,"" he said. Dortmund defender Mats Hummels, who spent the night in the Stade de France stadium with the rest of the Germany squad last November, also made the comparison. ""There were parallels with Paris. Everything was quiet, but also troubled,"" said Hummels. ""We knew something had happened, but didn't know what. It was quite strange. ""It was a very good reaction from the public for the fans to start singing this song."" Dortmund midfielder Nuri Sahin added: ""I had goosebumps. I've never experienced anything like that before."" Coach Thomas Tuchel said his squads' thoughts after the game were with the man's family. ""We see it everyday: there are far more important things (in life) than a football match."""

A second fan also collapsed, but was revived on the way to hospital. Reus scored on 30 minutes, but it meant the second-half was played in a subdued atmosphere as the news circulated. Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa netted Dortmund's second on 73 minutes in almost complete silence. ""On the pitch, we had no idea what was going on and were initially irritated by the silence,"" said Reus. ""Straight after the game, our coach (Thomas Tuchel) came to us and explained what had happened. ""It obviously put a shadow over the game and complement to the fans for the way they behaved."" Once the news sank in after the final whistle, the Dortmund team gathered as the home fans sang an emotional rendition of the club's anthem ""You'll Never Walk Alone"". ""I have never experienced something like that where the supporters were united in expressing their grief and respect,"" German FA interim president Reinhard Rauball told Sky. ""I also take my hat off to Mainz for the way they gave their support."" Dortmund's victory leaves them second, five points behind Bayern Munich. Earlier, ten-man Bayer Leverkusen had an own-goal to thank for ending their four-match winless streak in the Bundesliga in a 1-0 victory over Hamburg. Hamburg's Sweden midfielder Albin Ekdal slid the ball into his own net after 18 minutes at the BayArena to hand Leverkusen victory. Leverkusen had Croatia right-back Tin Jedvaj sent off in the dying stages after being shown two yellow cards in quick succession for time wasting, then mocking referee Christian Dingert. On Saturday, Thomas Mueller and Thiago Alcantara netted twice as leaders Bayern warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League last 16 clash at home to Juventus with a 5-0 win over Werder Bremen. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund playing Mainz on Sunday, Pep Guardiola's team took the chance to reopen an eight-point gap at the top. It took Bayern just nine minutes to take the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena as Thiago scored his first league goal since February 2014. Robert Lewandowski, the league's top scorer with 24 goals, came off the bench to claim Bayern's fourth as Bremen were routed. Wolfsburg suffered a Champions League hangover with a 1-0 defeat at relegation-threatened Hoffenheim. Wolfsburg reached the last eight in Europe for the first time in the club's history as Tuesday's 1-0 win at home to Gent sealed a 4-2 win on aggregate in the last 16. But Dieter Hecking's side were stunned by second-from-bottom Hoffenheim as Andrej Kramaric, on loan from Leicester City, scored after just three minutes. It could have been more as Kevin Volland had a second-half penalty saved. The defeat leaves Wolfsburg four points outside the top six while Hoffenheim remain three points from safety. Hoffenheim's win pushed bottom side Hanover 96 closer to relegation as they suffered a 2-0 defeat at home to Cologne with Leonardo Bittencourt scoring both goals. Eintracht Frankfurt's new coach Niko Kovac suffered a 3-0 defeat on his Bundesliga debut at Borussia Moenchengladbach to stay in the relegation places. Gladbach's Lars Stindl, Raffael and Mahmoud Dahoud scored the goals as Gladbach climbed to fourth. A foul on South Korea midfielder Koo Ja-Cheol in the dying stages of Augsburg's 2-2 draw at Darmstadt led to his side converting a penalty to take a crucial point. Augsburg are deep in the relegation battle as one of three teams on 27 points and just above the relegation places. Australia striker Mathew Leckie scored only his second goal of the season as he headed home from close range in mid-table Ingolstadt's 3-3 draw at home to Stuttgart. On Friday, Hertha Berlin cemented third place in the table with a 2-0 win over nearest rivals Schalke thanks to goals from Niklas Stark and Vedad Ibisevic."
557,12/03/2016,16:43,"Dortmund's Bender out, Sokratis in as Spurs loom","Borussia Dortmund are missing Sven Bender, but welcome back centre-back Sokratis, for Sunday's tricky Bundesliga clash against Mainz with one eye on their Europa League clash at Tottenham Hotspur.","Germany winger Marco Reus netted twice as Dortmund thumped Spurs 3-0 at their Signal Iduna Park stadium last Thursday in the last 16, first leg clash to leave Borussia on the verge of the quarter-finals. With the second leg at White Hart Lane beckoning on Thursday, Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel is unlikely to rotate his squad against Mainz to keep his stars fresh for London. ""I haven't given much thought to rotation. We were very fresh against Tottenham,"" said Tuchel in Saturday's press conference. First up, Dortmund have a tricky tie at home to Mainz, who are the only team to have won at Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena this season, when they poached a 2-1 win over Pep Guardiola's German league leaders a fortnight ago. Defensive midfielder Bender, who partnered Mats Hummels at centre-back against Spurs, is ruled out with a leg injury, but Greek central defender Sokratis is back following a few weeks out with a groin injury. Tuchel hopes to have Bender back for the return leg against Spurs. Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan is also struggling to be fit for Mainz after suffering a foot injury against Spurs and Tuchel said they will make a decision before kick-off. Tuchel, 42, spent five years coaching Mainz up until 2014 and Dortmund won 2-0 in October on his first return to the Coface Arena last October. Under current coach Martin Schmidt, Mainz are challenging for a Champions League place next season and are having one of the best seasons in the club's history."
558,10/03/2016,21:12,Dortmund outclass Tottenham in Europa League,"Brilliant Borussia Dortmund have one foot in the quarter-finals of the Europa League after sweeping aside Tottenham Hotspur with a 3-0 win in their last 16, first leg on Thursday.","Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang put the Bundesliga side ahead in the first half and Marco Reus netted twice in the second half at the Signal Iduna Park to leave Spurs with a mountain to climb in next week's return in north London. This was a clash between the second-placed team in Germany and the second-placed side in the Premier League, although Tottenham's chances of competing evenly with their formidable opponents were not helped by coach Mauricio Pochettino's decision to rotate his squad. For his 100th game in charge, Pochettino made seven changes to the team that drew 2-2 with Arsenal last weekend as Harry Kane, Kyle Walker, Erik Lamela and Mousa Dembele were left on the bench and Dele Alli was suspended. Teenager Joshua Onomah was among those handed a start against a Dortmund side near full strength, although Ilkay Gundogan was missing with a foot injury. Thomas Tuchel's side are five points adrift of Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga, the same distance that separates Spurs from Leicester City at the top of the Premier League. But Dortmund showed the greater desire to keep progressing in Europe, with Aubameyang following in to score after Hugo Lloris blocked a fine Henrikh Mkhitaryan volley early on only for the offside flag to cut short the celebrations. However, the rapid Gabon international forward did get the breakthrough on the half-hour mark, rising above Ben Davies to head home a Marcel Schmelzer cross from the left. Tottenham were simply never at the races, and Gonzalo Castro hit the post from a tight angle in the 51st minute after Aubameyang had lifted the ball over Lloris. Dortmund struck again on the hour mark, substitute Neven Subotic heading on a Castro cross for Germany star Reus to lash home on the volley at the back post. And they appeared to have the tie sewn up as Reus scored his second of the evening with 20 minutes remaining, stroking past Lloris from close range after superb build-up play involving Aubameyang and Castro. Elsewhere, holders Sevilla drew 0-0 away to Basel in Switzerland and ended the game with 10 men following the late sending-off of midfielder Steven N'Zonzi. Shakhtar Donetsk, UEFA Cup winners in 2009, are in a strong position after beating Anderlecht 3-1 in Ukraine. Taison and Olexandr Kucher struck in the first period for Shakhtar and Eduardo added a third late on after Frank Acheampong pulled one back for the Belgians. Fenerbahce have the edge against Portuguese side Braga following a 1-0 win in Istanbul given to them by a late Mehmet Topal goal. Later, old foes Liverpool and Manchester United meet at Anfield in the first ever encounter of the clubs in European competition. Athletic Bilbao and Valencia clash in an all-Spanish tie, while Villarreal host Bayer Leverkusen and Lazio visit the Czech capital to take on Sparta Prague."
559,10/03/2016,11:09,Tuchel 'not convinced' City-target Gundogan will stay,Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday he is not convinced Germany's Ilkay Gundogan will stay amidst reports Pep Guardiola's future employers Manchester City are set to swoop.,"The 25-year-old has a contract with Dortmund until June 2017 and German media report that Gundogan's agent, his uncle Ilhan, met with City's director of sport Txiki Begiristain in Amsterdam earlier this week. Gundogan has been a key factor in Dortmund's impressive form this season with Tuchel's team second only to Bayern Munich in Germany's top flight. But the defensive midfielder is reported to be on the list of players Guardiola wants when he takes over as City boss next season following three years with Bayern. ""I'm not disappointed, but I can't understand the fuss,"" said Tuchel. ""We are also planning our squad and taking care of things early, that's just part of the everyday business. ""I am not convinced he'll stay -- and I can only be otherwise when he signs. ""I have not seen the pictures (of Gundogan's uncle and Begiristain together), but it doesn't affect my mood either way. ""I am sure Ilkay knows exactly what he has at this club, in terms of what development can take place for him here and what leadership role he can play. ""It's pointless to list everything. Ilkay knows our assets very well."" Gundogan joined Dortmund from Nuremberg in 2011. Borussia can be forgiven for expecting some loyalty from him after they extended his contract in April 2014 even though he missed virtually the entire 2013/14 season with a back injury."

We'll be tested at the highest level,"" said Tuchel in a press conference. Dortmund host Mauricio Pochettino's Spurs at the Signal Iduna Park in one of the plum ties of the round. Borussia are second only to Bayern Munich in Germany, while Tottenham are vying with Leicester City, Arsenal and Manchester City for the Premier League title in England. ""The tempo in England has gone up again this season. It will be fast, it will be intensive,"" added Tuchel ahead of the sold-out clash. ""We are looking forward to this match because of the tradition both clubs have."" Dortmund have turned their stadium into something of a fortress this season in both the Bundesliga and Europe with 15 wins, two draws and a single defeat. Their attacking trio of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marco Reus have scored 67 goals between them this season in all competitions. They will be up against the English league's toughest defence, which has leaked only 24 goals this season. Dortmund's veteran goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller is tasked with containing the Spurs attack and ensuring the likes of Erik Lamela or Harry Kane do not grab a key away goal ahead of the return leg at White Hart Lane a week later on March 17."
561,05/03/2016,20:36,Bayern stay five clear after Dortmund stalemate,Bayern Munich remain five points clear of nearest Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund after a goalless draw between Germany's top two sides on Saturday.,"Bayern's shock 2-1 defeat on Wednesday to Mainz -- their first loss at home this season -- meant Pep Guardiola's Bayern came to second-placed Dortmund with their lead trimmed from eight points. Despite the lack of goals, the game lived up to its billing as the clash of the teams which have dominated the German league this season. There was no quarter asked or given in a high-quality match in the electric atmosphere of Dortmund's Signal Park Arena in front of 81,359 fans. ""It could have been 2-2 at end of the first half. I think we had the better of the chances overall, but the draw is fair,"" said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm. ""We are five points clear with nine games left, so there is still a long way to go."" Both sides had clear chances as Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki managed to block a Douglas Costa shot with the Bayern man through on goal in the first half. After the break, Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang tested Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer while Arjen Robben fired over the bar. On 64 minutes, Arturo Vidal's shot was palmed onto the bar by Buerki, the ball bounced away and the chance went begging. Soon after Vidal freed Robben, who fired over as the sides shared a point. The result offers their rivals hope as Bayern have now taken just one point from their last two games. Wolfsburg warmed up for their Champions League clash at home to Gent with a 2-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladach. The win moved Wolfsburg up to seventh ahead of the visit of Gent on Tuesday, with the Germans leading 3-2 from the last 16, first leg tie. Julian Draxler claimed his fourth goal in his last four games when he crashed home Andre Schuerrle's final pass with 15 minutes gone. His Germany team-mate Max Kruse added a second just two minutes later as the hosts raced into a 2-0 lead. Gladbach, who dropped to fifth, pulled a goal back when Brazilian striker Raffael claimed his 12th goal of the season on 23 minutes. Bayer Leverkusen came back from 3-0 down to avoid a fourth straight league defeat in a 3-3 draw at Augsburg. Augsburg's South Korea striker Koo Ja-Cheol scored his first hat-trick in Germany's top flight to put the hosts 3-0 up mid-way through the second-half. But Leverkusen, who play Villarreal in the last 16, first-leg, of the Europa League on Thursday, fought back. Karim Bellarabi scored and an own goal from Augsburg's Dutch defender Paul Verhaegh made it 2-0 on 80 minutes. In the dying stages, defender Jeffrey Gouweleeuw used his hands to block a shot and Hakan Calhanoglu converted the 92nd-minute spot kick as Gouweleeuw was sent off. Having shocked Leverkusen 4-1 on Wednesday when Claudio Pizarro scored a hat-trick, Werder Bremen pulled further away from the relegation zone with a 4-1 thrashing of bottom side Hanover 96. The 37-year-old Pizarro claimed his fourth goal in two games, and his 11th league of the season, when he flicked the ball over his shoulder, beating three defenders, and rifled home on 26 minutes. He then provided an assist as Czech international Gebre Selassie added Bremen's third on 56 minutes to leave Werder three points from the relegation spots. Stuttgart are now up to mid-table after their 5-1 thrashing of second-from-bottom Hoffenheim as defender Georg Niedermeier netted twice. Hoffenheim, under coach Julian Nagelsmann, 28, the youngest coach in Bundesliga history, remain four points from safety with nine games left. Schalke are fourth after their 3-1 win at Cologne thanks to goals from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Max Meyer and Argentina striker Franco di Santo who scored straight after coming off the bench."

Later on Saturday, second-placed Borussia Dortmund host leaders Bayern Munich in a mouth-watering clash. Draxler, who also netted in Wolfsburg's 4-0 drubbing of bottom side Hanover 96 on Tuesday, opened the scoring at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena. The attacking midfielder claimed his fourth goal in his last four games when he crashed home Andre Schuerrle's final pass with 15 minutes gone. His Germany team-mate Max Kruse added a second just two minutes later as the hosts raced into a 2-0 lead. Gladbach, who dropped to fifth, pulled a goal back when Brazilian striker Raffael claimed his 12th goal of the season on 23 minutes. Bayer Leverkusen came back from 3-0 down to avoid a fourth straight league defeat in their 3-3 draw at Augsburg. Augsburg's South Korea striker Koo Ja-Cheol scored his first hat-trick in Germany's top flight to put the hosts 3-0 up mid-way through the second-half. Koo, playing his sixth season in Germany after spells at Wolfsburg and Mainz, wrapped up his hat-trick inside the hour. Leverkusen fought back with goals by Karim Bellarabi and an own goal from Augsburg's Dutch defender Paul Verhaegh on 80 minutes. In the dying stages, defender Jeffrey Gouweleeuw used his hands to block a shot which saw the referee point straight to the penalty spot. Augsburg were denied a first win over Leverkusen at the tenth attempt when Hakan Calhanoglu converted the 92nd-minute spot kick as Gouweleeuw was sent off. Leverkusen's suspended coach Roger Schmidt was in Spain to watch Villarreal ahead of their Europa League last 16, first leg trip on Thursday. Having shocked Leverkusen 4-1 on Wednesday when Claudio Pizarro scored a hat-trick, Werder Bremen pulled further away from the relegation zone with a 4-1 thrashing at home to bottom side Hanover 96. The 37-year-old Pizarro claimed his fourth goal in two games, and his 11th league goal of the season, when he flicked the ball over his shoulder, beating three defenders, and rifled home on 26 minutes.

563,04/03/2016,02:10,Dortmund out to trim Bayern's lead in showdown,Germany's top two clubs go head to head on Saturday with hosts Borussia Dortmund out to ignite the Bundesliga title race by further trimming the lead of Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich.,"Bayern seemed to be running away with a fourth straight league title, and enjoyed an eight-point lead over second-placed Dortmund, until Mainz slammed on the brakes with a shock 2-1 win at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday. It was only Bayern's second league defeat of the season. Dortmund's 2-0 win at Darmstadt the same night meant Bayern's lead was cut to five points and adds spice to an already mouth-watering clash at Borussia's Signal Iduna Park, but the Bavarians remain favourites. When the sides met last October, Bayern dealt Dortmund a 5-1 thrashing in Munich. Bayern have won four of the last five league meetings including victories in both of their last two visits to Dortmund. Dortmund's single Bundesliga victory over Bayern in the last four years was a 3-0 thumping in Munich in April 2014 when Guardiola's side had already won the league title with a record seven games to spare. But for the first time in his three seasons at Bayern, Guardiola has a league rival breathing down his neck. ""This Borussia Dortmund team is completely different to the last three years,"" said the Spaniard after losing to Mainz. ""We will have to fight until the last game and the last second."" The Dortmund camp has sniffed weakness in their rivals. ""Let's not beat about the bush -- we want to cut the gap to two points,"" said Dortmund captain Mats Hummels. ""Saturday's going to be a brilliant game, we'll be really up for it."" Guardiola has a longer injury list than Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, who is only missing centre-back Sokratis from his first-choice line-up. Injuries to Jerome Boateng, Javi Martinez and Holger Badstuber have forced Guardiola to convert left-back David Alaba into a centre-back alongside Mehdi Benatia. But Guardiola has an embarrassment of riches in midfield with Franck Ribery back from injury and Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze unable to get a game. Whether he plays or not, Goetze, like fellow ex-Borussia star Robert Lewandowski, can expect a another hostile reception from home fans on his return to Dortmund. A sub-plot to the showdown sees the league's top three scorers shooting it out in Dortmund. Bayern's Lewandowski tops the list with 23 goals in his 23 games while Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is just one behind with 22. Munich's Thomas Mueller has also scored a highly respectable 17 league goals. Between them, Mueller and Lewandowski have 40 league goals. They are just 14 short of the league record partnership of 54 set by Wolfsburg pair Edin Dzeko and Grafite in 2009. ""You sometimes get games (like the Mainz defeat), but it will be different in Dortmund,"" promised Lewandowski ominously. There will be a relegation battle royale when Werder Bremen, who stunned Bayer Leverkusen 4-1 on Wednesday thanks to veteran Claudio Pizarro's hat-trick, host bottom side Hanover 96. Bremen remain just one place above the bottom three while Hanover, who have playmaker Hiroshi Kiyotake back from injury, are seven points from safety and desperately need to win. Second-bottom Hoffenheim will be looking to build on their 2-1 win over Augsburg when they travel to Stuttgart, who are winless in their last three games after a surge which carried them up to mid-table.

Dortmund host Bayern in a top-of-the-table clash in three days and Guardiola admitted his side has a fight on their hands. An unthinkable second straight league defeat for Bayern would leave Dortmund trailing by just two points with nine games left in Germany's top flight. But the Spaniard said Bayern simply were not good enough against Mainz as they failed to convert their mind-blowing 78 percent ball possession into victory. ""Our performance wasn't good enough, but I am not sad,"" said Guardiola, who is in his final season in Munich before coaching Manchester City next season. Bayern have won the league at a canter for the last three years, setting a record in 2014 when they secured the title with seven games left. But Guardiola says those days are gone. ""No other team has won the Bundesliga four times in a row,"" he said. ""This Borussia Dortmund team is completely different to the last three years and we will have to fight until the last game. ""We have to think of the next game and today was a clear signal that it won't be easy. ""We must fight until the last second."" Mainz sealed only their second ever win in Munich when Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba came off the bench to hit the 86th-minute winner. ""We had our chances and then let them counter-attack. We shouldn't have allowed that to happen,"" fumed Bayern's goal-scorer Arjen Robben. Mainz took a shock lead at the Allianz Arena when Spanish winger Jairo fired home in the first-half with the Bayern defence well beaten. Robben pulled a goal back for the Bavarians on 64 minutes before Cordoba netted only to be mobbed by his team-mates. ""We knew how we could win here with a strong defensive display and a good counter-attack,"" said Mainz coach Martin Schmidt, who praised his side's 'outstanding display'. ""It feels really good."" Dortmund's 2-0 win at Darmstadt on Wednesday cut Bayern's lead from eight points to five as another Colombia striker, Adrian Ramos, and defender Erik Durm netted. ""We and Bayern both know that things can now be a bit tight. We want to win the thing,"" said Dortmund's Germany defender Durm."

Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba came off the bench to seal only Mainz's second victory in Munich with the winner on 86 minutes to finish off a counter-attack. ""We had our chances and then let them counter-attack. We shouldn't have allowed that to happen,"" fumed Bayern's goal-scorer Arjen Robben. Mainz took a shock lead at the Allianz Arena when Spanish winger Jairo fired home in the first-half with the Bayern defence well beaten. Robben pulled a goal back for the Bavarians on 64 minutes. Despite Mainz managing only 22 percent of possession, Cordoba grabbed the late winner and was mobbed by his team-mates. ""We knew how we could win here with a strong defensive display and a good counter-attack,"" said Mainz coach Martin Schmidt, who praised his side's 'outstanding display'. ""It feels really good."" Dortmund's 2-0 win at Darmstadt on Wednesday cut Bayern's lead from eight points to five as another Colombia striker, Adrian Ramos, and defender Erik Durm netted. ""We and Bayern both know that things can now be a bit tight. We want to win the thing,"" said Dortmund's Germany defender Durm. Hertha Berlin cemented third place, but remain 15 points adrift of Dortmund, with a 2-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the capital. Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou and Mitchell Weiser scored to keep Hertha on course for a first return to the Champions League since 2000. At the other end of the table, Werder Bremen climbed out of the relegation places with a shock 4-1 win at Bayer Leverkusen as veteran Claudio Pizarro claimed a hat-trick. The 37-year-old Peru international showed why he is the Bundesliga's top scoring foreigner by needing just under half an hour to wrap up his hat-trick which included a penalty. Having knocked Leverkusen out of the German Cup in the quarter-finals last month, Bremen again humbled Bayer. Roger Schmidt's Leverkusen has now lost four of their last five games in all competitions and drop to seventh in the league. Elsewhere Schalke climbed to sixth with a 3-2 comeback win at home to Hamburg while Borussia Moenchengladbach remain fourth after their 4-0 thrashing at home to Stuttgart. Second-from-bottom Hoffenheim boosted their survival chances with a 2-1 win over Augsburg. On Tuesday, Germany winger Andre Schuerrle claimed the first Bundesliga hat-trick of his career as Wolfsburg routed bottom side Hanover 96 4-0 away. March 1 is a lucky day for Schuerrle who also scored a hat-trick for ex-club Chelsea against Fulham in the Premier League exactly two years ago. His performance will boost his standing at Wolfsburg and in this one game he has scored more goals than in his previous 33 matches for the Champions League side. He needed just 26 minutes to score three goals before Germany team-mate Julian Draxler added Wolfsburg's fourth at Hanover's HDI Arena. The win leaves Wolfsburg eighth while Hanover are bottom, four points from their nearest rival and seven points from safety. The German FA (DFB) is expected to fine both clubs after one of the flares fired from the away fan block hit the Hanover bench before kick-off, but no-one was hurt. Elsewhere, French striker Anthony Modeste rescued a point for Cologne in their 1-1 draw at Ingolstadt after forward Lukas Hinterseer had given the hosts the lead."
566,01/03/2016,15:49,Guardiola dismisses Dortmund talk before Mainz,"Bayern Munich could move closer to an historic fourth straight German league title if they win at nearest-rivals Borussia Dortmund in four days, but Pep Guardiola says, for now, it's all about Mainz on Wednesday.","Bayern hold an eight point lead in the table and victory at Dortmund on Saturday would be a significant step becoming the first team to win four straight German league titles. Bayern won 2-0 at Champions League side Wolfsburg last Saturday and now a mouth-watering showdown beckons in Dortmund. Before that however Guardiola insists he is focused on playing resurgent Mainz at Munich's Allianz Arena. ""Everyone is talking about Wolfsburg and Borussia Dortmund, but we are playing against Mainz, who are fifth in the table. ""They are a strong and dynamic team."" The Martin Schmidt-coached Mainz proved just how strong they are in beating Bayer Leverkusen 3-1 at home on Sunday with goal-scoring midfielder Yunus Malli netting twice to leave them fifth and challenging for a Champions League place next season. But Bayern want to secure the league title as soon as possible to allow them to focus on Europe. They set the Bundesliga record for the earliest title win two years ago by wrapping things up with seven games left at the end of March 2014, holding a 22-point gap over second-placed Dortmund at the time. Two years on, Dortmund are making life much harder under coach Thomas Tuchel and Guardiola knows he can ill afford to be distracted by the Champions League or German Cup in his final few months in Munich before coaching Manchester City next season. Tuchel says it is obvious Bayern are eager to win at Dortmund to leave Borussia with only a mathematical chance of winning the title. ""It should be noted that Bayern want to decide things early,"" said Tuchel, ahead of their game on Wednesday's at Darmstadt, who are just above the relegation places. ""Perhaps it's the best outcome (for Bayern) if the eight point gap remains."" Injuries have robbed Guardiola of defenders with centre-backs Jerome Boateng, Javi Martinez and Holger Badstuber sidelined. But in attack, he has all his players fit and is struggling to find a place for Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze, who is back from injury. ""He still needs more time and I have seven forwards fit,"" said Guardiola. ""We still have three months left and we need all our players in order to reach our goals. ""Mario is very professional and is important for us."" After ex-Bayern president Uli Hoeness was released from prison after serving 21 months for tax evasion on Monday, Guardiola was tight-lipped on whether he has already spoken to him. ""That's private,"" Guardiola snapped. ""We are happy for him, for Susi (Hoeness' wife) and his family."""
567,28/02/2016,19:49,Aubameyang seals Dortmund's late fightback win,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted again as Borussia Dortmund scored three goals in the final ten minutes for a dramatic 3-1 comeback win over ten-man Hoffenheim on Sunday in the Bundesliga.,"Hoffenheim captain Sebastian Rudy gave his side the lead in Dortmund before being sent off and the hosts were just ten minutes from their first home defeat of the season. The game turned when Rudy was shown a straight red card -- on his 26th birthday -- for bringing down Aubameyang, who was through on goal, on 58 minutes. Winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan spared Dortmund's blushes with an 80th-minute equaliser before substitute Adrian Ramos headed Lukasz Piszczek's cross home on 85 minutes. Mkhitaryan then laid on the third when he sprinted clear, drew Hoffenheim keeper Oliver Baumann and passed for Aubameyang to tap home in the second minute of stoppage time. It was the 22nd goal of the season for the Gabon striker, who is one behind the league's top scorer, Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski. The win allows second-placed Borussia to trim Bayern's lead at the top of the table to eight points before next Saturday's top of the table clash against Pep Guardiola's Bavarians in Dortmund. Hoffenheim remain second from bottom and four points from safety. Borussia Moenchengladbach went fourth after a fightback earned a 2-2 draw at Augsburg. Brazilian striker Raffael had sent Gladbach into a half-time lead before the game exploded into life with three goals in five second-half minutes. Despite their midweek Europa League exit at the hands of Liverpool, Augsburg, who are 13th, roared back with two goals in quick succession. Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason thumped a header home on 50 minutes, his first goal since joining from Olympiakos, before Brazil winger Caiuby slotted neatly home just three minutes later. Gladbach's American winger Fabian Johnson gave the perfect response as he smashed home his shot on 55 minutes to make it 2-2. The visitors should have won as Sweden's Oscar Wendt fired wide late on while only a Marwin Hitz save denied Borussia captain Granit Xhaka. Mainz warmed up for Wednesday's league game at Bayern by moving up to fifth with a 3-1 win at home to Bayer Leverkusen. Mainz's Yunus Malli and Jhon Cordoba netted first half goals, then Malli netted a second-half penalty, before Javier Hernandez pulled a goal back. On Saturday, Bayern continued their seemingly unstoppable march to an historic fourth consecutive league title with a 2-0 win at Wolfsburg. Guardiola's outfit now have 62 points out of a possible 69, their tally exactly double that of Wolfsburg, who are eighth. A tight struggle was settled by second-half goals from Kingsley Coman and Lewandowski, who netted his 33rd goal in all competitions. Elsewhere, bottom side Hanover gained ground in the relegation battle with a shock 2-1 win at Stuttgart after an eight-match losing streak. Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake capped his first start since November after injury by setting up both goals for defender Christian Schulz. It means just four points separate the bottom three sides, but Hanover remain five points from safety. Hamburg drew 1-1 at home to Ingolstadt while Werder Bremen are deep in the relegation battle despite their 2-2 draw at home to Darmstadt. On Friday, Hertha Berlin strengthened their grip on third place with a 1-0 victory at Cologne as Vedad Ibisevic scored the winner to break their run of six games without a win."
568,28/02/2016,02:10,Dortmund's US teen living German league dream,"He won't turn 18 until September, but Christian Pulisic is living the German league dream having been propelled from youth team football to a starting place with Borussia Dortmund.","The 17-year-old capped a lightning rise through Dortmund's ranks this season by starting on the left wing in their 1-0 win at Bayer Leverkusen last Sunday. After three appearances off the bench, he played the first 45 minutes before making way for Germany winger Marco Reus having made his Bundesliga debut in January. Reus is expected to start Sunday's home match against second-from-bottom Hoffenheim with Pulisic on the bench at Borussia's Signal Iduna Park, but the teenager is content to soak up the experience of life at one of Germany's top sides. ""It's been an amazing experience just to train with these guys every day. Then to go out and play in front of fans and live that moment was amazing,"" he said of his start against Leverkusen. ""It was an amazing feeling to hear I was starting, it's such an honour, especially at such a young age. ""It was great to get the experience. I was pretty cool before the game, obviously right before the start you're nervous. ""It was good that I had had a few minutes before (as a substitute) and I was ready for this."" The teenager from Pennsylvania is already on the radar of US national coach Jurgen Klinsmann ahead of this June's Copa America Centenario hosted by the USA. After representing the USA at Under-15 and Under-17 level, he was snapped up by Dortmund in January 2015 and won last season's U-17s German title before joining up with the club's U-19 team. His breakthrough came when he was invited to train with the senior Dortmund squad during the January winter break. He impressed head coach Thomas Tuchel so much that he made his Bundesliga debut as a 68th-minute substitute in the 2-0 win over Ingolstadt 04 on January 30. ""It's a pleasure to have him around, with his cheeky smile and his humility,"" said Tuchel. ""He seems shy, but he fights for everything."" At the tender age of 17 years and 133 days, he is the eighth youngest player to feature in Germany's top flight. Klinsmann, who is not afraid of promoting young talent, is excited by Pulisic's rise and wants to keep an eye on the talented teenager. ""He has a tremendous amount of talent, there is no doubt about it,"" said the ex-Germany striker. ""But we're just monitoring him right now and see him getting minutes with Dortmund is exciting for us. We'll take it one day at a time."""

Germany winger Marco Reus is expected to face Hoffenheim despite a groin strain. Hoffenheim are second from bottom, but Julian Nagelsmann, the youngest ever Bundesliga coach at just 28, stopped the rot last week with a 3-2 win at home to Mainz. ""I'm expecting a tactical and very flexible opponent,"" said Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel as his side looked to brush off the effects of their away match in Portugal.

572,24/02/2016,11:47,"Leverkusen's Schmidt hit with five-match ban, fine","Bayer Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt was on Wednesday banned from the bench for five league games and fined 20,000 euros ($22,031) after refusing a referee's order to leave the touchline during a Bundesliga match.","The German Football Association (DFB) has taken a hard line with Schmidt, who is banned for the next three league games, against Mainz, Werder Bremen and Augsburg, with a further two games suspended until June 30 2017. Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller has also been fined 10,000 euros after describing the referee's decision to send Schmidt to the stands as 'completely unnecessary' during a post-match rant. Schmidt became engaged in an angry exchange with referee Felix Zwayer following Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 64th-minute goal at the BayArena last Sunday that gave Borussia Dortmund a 1-0 victory over Leverkusen in Germany's top flight. Schmidt was ordered to the stands, but refused to leave the technical area, demanding an explanation for Zwayer's decision and the referee reacted by stopping play and walking off the pitch with his assistants. The match eventually restarted nine minutes later when Schmidt accepted the referee's decision and the 48-year-old later admitted he was wrong to have lost his temper. The DFB has specified that Schmidt must have no contact with his players, directly or indirectly, from half an hour before each game until 30 minutes after the final whistle.

The 48-year-old Schmidt was furious that Dortmund were allowed to take a free kick in the build up to Aubameyang's 64th-minute winner and stood his ground. The controversy was triggered when Leverkusen striker Stefan Kiessling pushed over Dortmund's Sven Bender in the Borussia half. Zwayer awarded a free kick, which Matthias Ginter quickly took. The move swept down field and Germany defender Erik Durm's pass pulled the Leverkusen defence to create space for Aubameyang to hit the winner. The Leverkusen team, with Kiessling and Schmidt at the forefront, furiously protested that the game should have been stopped for the free-kick to be taken. When Schmidt refused Zwayer's demand that he went to the stands, the Berlin official marched the teams off until the Bayer coach took a seat in the grandstands. It was the first time in Bundesliga history that a game has been stopped under such circumstances. When play resumed, Leverkusen's star striker Javier Hernandez wasted a golden chance in added time to equalise by firing over the bar with the goal at his mercy. Dortmund's controversial victory leaves them eight ponts behind runaway league leaders Bayern Munich who beat Darmstadt 3-1 at home on Saturday. Thomas Mueller netted twice to dig Bayern out of trouble in their last match before their Champions League clash at Juventus before Robert Lewandowski added their third goal. Against the run of play, Pep Guardiola's Bayern went behind when Darmstadt's Munich-born striker Sandro Wagner headed home midway through the first half. It was only the fifth time this season Bayern had gone behind. But using their 81 percent possession to fire in a total of 36 shots on goal to Darmstadt's six, Guardiola's side roared back to claim their 19th win in 22 league games this season. Bayern were back level four minutes into the second half when Mueller slammed his shot into the right-hand corner. He added a superb second -- his 17th league goal of the season -- by chesting down Arturo Vidal's cross and hitting a bicycle kick into Darmstadt's net on 71 minutes. Lewandowski added the third on 84 minutes when he converted Franck Ribery's low cross after the Frenchman came off the bench for only his third appearance of the season. It was Lewandowski's 22nd goal of the season in 21 league games to leave him as the league's top scorer. Elsewhere, fresh from their 3-2 Champions League win at Gent in midweek, Wolfsburg picked up a point in the capital with a 1-1 draw at Hertha Berlin. Wolves took the lead at the Olympic Stadium when Marcel Schaefer converted Vieirinha's cross on 53 minutes, but Salomon Kalou on the hour mark. Julian Nagelsmann, the Bundesliga's youngest ever coach at 28, steered Hoffenheim to only their third win of the season on just his second match in charge with a 3-2 victory at home to Mainz. Hoffenheim remain 17th, but are now only three points from safety after Werder Bremen, who are 16th, lost 2-0 at Ingolstadt. Cologne fans protested about the price of away tickets at Borussia Moenchengladbach as the hosts sealed a 1-0 win thanks to Mahmoud Dahoud's first-half goal."

Dortmund have won 15 of their 21 games so far in Germany's top flight and defensive midfielder Gundogan, who has a contract until 2017, is in superb form. But according to Spanish newspaper Sport, Gundogan has broken off negotiations with Barcelona and told the Catalan giants he expects to join City next season to play under Guardiola, who leaves Bayern at the end of the season. Sport say the 25-year-old Gundogan has already told Dortmund that he will not be extending his contract. ""Really? We should know about that, shouldn't we? Truth is, we don't know anything about that,"" replied Borussia Dortmund's official account on Twitter to Sport's claims. Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel says they are working hard to keep Gundogan, who is back to his best after missing most of the 2013/14 season with a back injury. ""We are fighting to keep him and I believe it's not the case that there isn't a chance he'll stay,"" said Tuchel. ""The importance of Ilkay in this form is undisputed, but one can imagine that the interest from other clubs is very high."" Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke says he expects to be able to announce a decision on Gundogan soon. Meanwhile, French newspaper L'Equipe claims Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who is under contract at Dortmund until 2020, is destined to play for Real Madrid -- due to a promise he made to his grandfather. 'Auba' has scored 30 goals this season, 20 of which have come in the Bundesliga, and is rivalling Bayern's Robert Lewandowski as the league's top scorer. ""In 2014, just before the death of my grandfather, who was born in Avila 100 kilometres from Madrid, I gave him the promise to play one day for Real,"" Aubameyang told L'Equipe.

Since that Champions League group game, Bayern have won all five of their home games in all competitions without conceding a single goal and hold an eight-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Guardiola's team are in no mood to give Darmstadt any hope of a first win in Munich in their final match before their Champions League last 16, first-leg clash at Juventus next Tuesday. Especially as Darmstadt have picked up 17 of their 24 points this season away from home. ""They will play very deep and very compact,"" said Bayern midfielder Xabi Alonso. ""We will have to be patient and it'll be important to get the first goal. ""It's all about Darmstadt for now, we want to keep our eight-point lead. Only afterwards will we think about Juventus."" With 21 goals to his credit, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski has scored almost as many goals as the 22 the entire Darmstadt team has managed. The visitors' cause is not helped by a raft of suspensions. Peter Niemeyer, Jerome Gondorf, Aytac Sulu, Marcel Heller and Konstantin Rausch are all banned after each picked up yellow cards in last Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Bayer Leverkusen. ""We have registered that. However, I believe that no one wants to miss this chance to play in front of an audience of millions,"" said Darmstadt coach Dirk Schuster confidently. Guardiola hopes to have centre-backs Medhi Benatia and Serdar Tasci fit as he was unable to play a single central defender in last weekend's win at Augsburg after Holger Badstuber fractured an ankle. Dortmund will be looking to make it nine games undefeated at Leverkusen on Sunday. Thomas Tuchel's Dortmund are in impressive form as last Saturday's 1-0 win over bottom side Hanover 96 left them 13 points clear of third-placed Bayer. Having sat out the Hanover win, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will be looking to add to his 20 goals in as many league games to rival Lewandowski. The last time Leverkusen beat Dortmund at the BayArena was in May 2007, but Roger Schmidt's men have picked up 14 of a possible 18 points and are undefeated in their last six games. Leverkusen will again be without striker Javier Hernandez after the Mexican tore a buttock muscle in their German Cup defeat to Werder Bremen 10 days ago. Cologne fans plan a protest before kick-off of Saturday's match at Borussia Moenchengladbach over the restricted number of away fans allowed. Gladbach will be without centre-back Martin Stranzl, who tore his right calf in training on Wednesday as they look to bounce back from Sunday's shock defeat to Hamburg.

In his absence, Mkhitaryan showed superb individual skill for the winner at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park. With Marcel Schmelzer screaming up in support on his left, Mkhitaryan cut back inside and curled his right-footed shot around Hanover's Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler on 57 minutes. With Pep Guardiola's Bayern at Augsburg on Sunday, Dortmund remain second while Hanover are rooted to the bottom, seven points from safety. Wolfsburg warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League, last 16, first-leg at Ghent with a 2-0 win at home to Ingolstadt to pick up their first victory since knocking Manchester United out of Europe in December. Dieter Hecking's Wolfsburg won for the first time in six games but stay eighth after first-half goals goals by Germany midfielder Julian Draxler and defender Robin Knoche. Bayer Leverkusen moved up from seventh to third as they bounced back from their shock German Cup exit at the hands of Werder Bremen in mid-week with a 2-1 comeback win at Darmstadt. On a heavy pitch, Sandro Wagner stabbed the ball home to give Darmstadt an early lead, despite Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno catching him around the throat with his forearm. Leverkusen drew level when Darmstadt defender Aytac Sulu headed into his own net on 62 minutes. The visitors then took the lead with a sweeping move which went the length of the pitch. From a Darmstadt corner, junior Julian Brandt started the move he finished by tapping home Kevin Kampl's final pass for the winner on 77 minutes. VfB Stuttgart's impressive form continued as they picked up their fifth-straight league win to go ninth with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin. A long-range strike from Ivory Coast defensive midfielder Serey Die and a second-half goal from left-wing Filip Kostic sealed the hosts' win. Hertha suffered their first defeat in nine games since losing 2-0 at Bayern in November to drop to fourth. The youngest manager in Bundesliga history made his debut when Julian Nagelsmann, 28, was on Hoffenheim's bench for their 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen in the basement battle. Nagelsmann took over after predecessor Huub Stevens resigned on Wednesday due to heart problems. Despite Hoffenheim taking the lead on 10 minutes through Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric, Werder hit back three minutes later as former Chelsea defender Papy Djilobodji scored his first Bremen goal.

Hanover lie bottom of the table, seven points from safety, and have mustered only 19 goals in the league all season, while 'Auba' has netted 20 times in as many Bundesliga games for Dortmund. The 26-year-old netted his 30th goal in 31 games in all competitions on Tuesday when Dortmund reached the German Cup semi-finals with a 3-1 win at Stuttgart. To compound Hanover's problems, they will be without Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake, their top scorer with three goals, who has a foot injury. Hanover have lost all of their last six league games while Dortmund are unbeaten in their nine home league games this season with eight wins and a draw. Second-placed Dortmund are looking to bounce back from last Saturday's goalless draw at Hertha Berlin and know how important their African striker is. ""For us, it is extremely important that he's a goal threat up front and that he scores,"" said Dortmund's Germany winger Marco Reus, who has scored nine goals in 15 league games. ""Auba knows that if he gets the chance in front of goal, he has to score and he works hard every day in training to score as many goals as possible."" With an eight-point lead over Dortmund at the top of the table, Bayern Munich are at Augsburg in the Bavarian derby on Sunday, fresh from Wednesday's 3-0 Cup quarter-final win at 10-man VfL Bochum. Franck Ribery and Mario Goetze could feature as they work their way back to fitness after a leg and groin injury respectively. Augsburg, who are just above the relegation places, host Liverpool in the Europa League next Thursday and have won just one of their last five games. But their trainer Markus Weinzierl is the only coach to have beaten Pep Guardiola's Bayern twice in the league. Augsburg shocked the Bavarians in each of the last two seasons, albeit after the league title had already been decided. Wolfsburg, who are winless in their last seven league games and play Belgian side Gent next Wednesday in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie, are at home to Ingolstadt. Dieter Hecking's Wolves have picked up just one of a possible nine points in the second half of the season so far. They will be without striker Bas Dost, who has a foot injury, and forward Maximilian Arnold, who is out with a knee problem. Fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen are at Darmstadt without injured Mexico striker Javier Hernandez, who tore a buttock muscle on Tuesday in their Cup defeat to Werder Bremen. Meanwhile, Hoffenheim are at Bremen on Saturday in a key relegation battle with both sides in the bottom three. Hoffenheim have won just twice all season and are currently second from bottom, five points adrift of Bremen, who lie in the relegation play-off position. The Sinsheim-based club will be playing their first match under their new coach Julian Nagelsmann, who at 28 becomes the youngest coach in Bundesliga history. He replaces the 62-year-old Huub Stevens, who resigned on Wednesday, walking away from football with an acute abnormal heart rhythm that requires surgery. Bremen are buoyed by reaching the German Cup semi-finals after winning 3-1 at Leverkusen on Tuesday and striker Anthony Ujah has scored in each of his three games against Hoffenheim.

After boycotting the first 20 rows of the away section, Dortmund fans then threw the brightly-coloured balls onto the pitch midway through the first-half which Borussia players, led by captain Mats Hummels, had to pick up as the game was briefly halted. ""Football must be affordable!"" read one banner in the away section as the cheapest ticket for Tuesday's match was 38.50 euros, plus booking fee, while the most expensive were more than 70 euros. ""We wanted to try and put a good face on the matter, but at the same time show that it was not on,"" said Marc Quambusch, the initiative's spokesman. The fans carried out the protest with Dortmund's blessing. ""It's the case that VfB Stuttgart raised the prices for tickets by 25 percent, with prices around 70 euros,"" said Dortmund's press officer Sascha Fligge in the pre-match press conference. ""The fans are very critical of this and we support them."" Stuttgart said they had put prices up for away fans after Dortmund had done exactly the same thing for a Bundesliga match between the clubs at Borussia's Signal Iduna Stadium. Ticket prices are an issue in England's Premier League after 10,000 fans walked out of Liverpool's 2-2 draw at home to Sunderland last Saturday over the £77 ($112, 99 euros) it will cost for the most expensive match ticket at Anfield next season.

Aubameyang has now scored in each of Dortmund's last seven German Cup games, dating back to the start of last season, having also netted in Dortmund's 3-1 Cup final defeat to Wolfsburg last May. ""Auba knows how to take his chances and he works hard on his finishing every day,"" said Reus. ""It's fun to play alongside him."" Dortmund are in the semi-finals for the third season in a row while spirited Stuttgart had their five-match winning streak, dating back to mid-December, ended. Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich will attempt to join Dortmund in the last four when they play VfL Bochum on Wednesday while minnows Heidenheim host Hertha Berlin. Dortmund took the lead at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena when Reus fired home off the crossbar with just five minutes gone. Stuttgart fought back and levelled when Lukas Rupp's shot deflected off Mkhitaryan and into the Dortmund net on 21 minutes to the home fans' delight. The visitors regained the lead when Reus set up Aubameyang for his 30th in all competitions, on 31 minutes as Stuttgart failed to cope with Dortmund's pace. With time running out, Aubameyang broke clear and pulled Stuttgart goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak off his line to allow Mkhitaryan a simple tap-in on 89 minutes. Earlier, veteran Claudio Pizarro helped seal Werder Bremen's 3-1 quarter-final win at ten-man Bayer Leverkusen by playing a key role in their shock victory. There was a strong Latin American flavour at Leverkusen's BayArena as Bremen booked their place in April's semi-finals. Mexico's Javier Hernandez put Leverkusen ahead, then Bremen's Argentinian centre-back Santiago Garcia levelled before Brazilian defender Wendell was sent off for Bayer just before the half-time break. After Wendall's dismissal, Peru's 37-year-old striker Pizarro scored Bremen's second by converting the resulting penalty, then set up their third. ""We did very well defensively and we reacted as a unit after conceding a goal,"" beamed Pizarro. ""Now we get to go further in the Cup."" Leverkusen took the lead when ex-Manchester United forward Hernandez continued his record of scoring in each round of the cup. It was his 22nd goal for Bayer this season in all competitions. After Stefan Kiessling was up-ended by Bremen's Spanish defender Alejandro Galvez in the area, 'Chicharito' rifled home the resulting penalty in the 22nd minute. The lead lasted nine minutes as Bremen's Argentinian centre-back Santiago Garcia put Werder level by hitting the bottom left-hand corner of Leverkusen's net to make it 1-1. Disaster struck for the hosts when Wendell was shown a straight red for hauling down Bartels, who was through on goal, just before the break The 37-year-old Pizarro, who last weekend became the first foreign player to make 400 Bundesliga appearances, hit his eighth goal of the season. Pizarro then played a big part in Bremen's third as his shot was saved by Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno, but Florian Grillitsch tapped home the rebound on 82 minutes."

""For me personally, it's a special feeling to run out against Dortmund,"" Grosskreutz said having made 178 league appearances for Borussia, whom he left in September. ""It was my club and I'm looking forward to seeing my friends again,"" he said before adding ""but we won't be friends on the pitch"". ""I'm from there and really looking forward to the game. ""We'll put everything in so that we can pull off a surprise. We want to reach the next round. ""Dortmund have a world-class team, it's not for no reason that they're second (in the Bundesliga), but we believe in our chances."" According to Borussia's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke, Grosskreutz ""embodied"" what the club is about, even if he courted controversy during his six years as a Dortmund player by urinating in a Berlin hotel's foyer and throwing a kebab at a fan in Cologne during separate late-night incidents. The 27-year-old was part of Germany's World Cup squad, but didn't play a single minute of Brazil 2014 and will be up against former Borussia team-mates he only waved goodbye to a few months ago. The right-back will be tasked with ensuring Dortmund's Germany star Marco Reus has a quiet game on the left wing and that striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang fails to add to his tally of 29 goals in all competitions this season. Grosskreutz has been a revelation since signing for Stuttgart in January, helping his new club to three wins in as many games, after an unhappy three-month stint at Galatasaray when he did not play a competitive game. Having been a Dortmund regular under Jurgen Klopp, Grosskreutz left at the start of the current season due to a lack of opportunities under new coach Thomas Tuchel. ""There won't be much time for a chat, but there are no personal reservations,"" said Tuchel. Grosskreutz switched to Istanbul's Galatasaray in late August, but a problem with the paperwork before the transfer window closed meant he could not play in competitive games for the Turkish club for the rest of 2015. Homesickness kicked in and Grosskreutz seized the chance to return to the Bundesliga with Stuttgart in January. ""I was made to feel super welcome in the team and feel really well in the city and in the stadium,"" he said. ""In the league, it is all about staying up and we aren't talking about anything else, but of course we want to try and take something out of Tuesday."" He is not Stuttgart's only ex-Dortmund player looking forward to playing last season's German Cup finalists. Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak is set to make his first start for Stuttgart having been plagued with injury since his transfer before the start of the season. Resurgent Stuttgart will test high-flying Dortmund, having won all of their last five matches since needing extra-time to beat Eintracht Braunschweig 3-2 in the third round of the German Cup last December. League wins over Wolfsburg, Cologne, Hamburg and Eintracht Frankfurt have catapulted 2007 German league champions Stuttgart from the relegation places to 12th in the Bundesliga table."
581,06/02/2016,20:11,Tuchel amused as Mourinho sees Dortmund draw,"Jose Mourinho made an appearance in Germany's capital on Saturday to watch Hertha Berlin's Bundesliga home match against high-flying Borussia Dortmund, to the amusement of the visitors' coach Thomas Tuchel.","Mourinho was invited to the match at Berlin's Olympic Stadium by Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke as hosts Hertha held Borussia to an uninspiring goalless draw. The visit came just 24 hours after reports Mourinho's representatives held talks with Manchester United about replacing Louis van Gaal as manager of the Premier League club. The 53-year-old Mourinho has been linked with the Old Trafford post since being sacked by Chelsea in December and Tuchel showed some comic timing when asked about Mourinho's visit. Tuchel has only been Dortmund's head coach since the start of the season with his predecessor Jurgen Klopp now in charge of Liverpool. ""I did not know (about the invite) and it's really not okay,"" said Tuchel with mock indignation in the post-match press conference in reference to Mourinho. After a short pause for effect, he continued: ""The truth is: I knew about it (before hand) and, of course, it's completely ok. ""But if he replaces me next week, then it's not okay again,"" he added with a broad grin. Dortmund are second in Germany's top flight behind Bayern Munich with Tuchel's side ten points clear of third-placed Hertha."
582,08/01/2016,11:48,Africa star Aubameyang staying at Dortmund,Star Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang rejected English Premier League overtures as he celebrated winning the African player of the year award.,"The Gabonese, who is the leading Bundesliga scorer this season, was reduced to tears after stopping Yaya Toure getting a fifth straight title on Thursday night. ""I am staying at Dortmund,"" the 26-year-old Aubameyang, who has been linked with an $85 million move to Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool, said after accepting the prize at a gala in Abuja. ""I am so happy. I am not someone who usually cries but it is quite an emotional moment. ""When you are standing alongside players like Yaya Toure or Andre Ayew there is pride in winning such a trophy ahead of them because they are great players and I obviously admire them a lot."" The first player from Gabon to win the title said he hope to get a second award next year with his rich run of form. ""I will really have to work a lot. Obviously I think I have the skills and the talent to make it again next year but it will require lots of work and many sacrifices as well."" Aubameyang, who has scored 18 goals in 17 Bundesliga games this season, earned 143 points in a poll of African coaches, seven more than Manchester City's Toure. Ghana and Swansea City striker Andre Ayew was third on 112 points. ""I am disappointed but that won't take anything from anybody,"" said Toure, the Ivory Coast captain. ""I am sure Andre is also disappointed after what he did last year. ""This is not the time to complain. We will all go back and continue to work hard."" Aubameyang dedicated his title to his country and Gabon's President Ali Bongo Ondimba was among the first to congratulate him. ""His genius is a major asset for the Panthers in preparation for the next African Cup of Nations,"" said Bongo. Gabon will host the next next African championship in 2017. ""We have good players and a good national team in Gabon,"" declared Aubameyang. Frenchman Herve Renard, who led the Ivory Coast to the 2015 African Cup of Nations, was named Coach of the Year. This was his second such award after the 47-year-old also led Zambia to upset favourites Ivory Coast to lift a first-ever Nations Cup trophy in 2012. ""You never win alone so I would like to congratulate my staff,"" said Renard. ""I would like to congratulate the Ivory Coast Federation because they believed in me and I dedicate this trophy to all the people around the world from Ivory Coast because it was an amazing victory for us, after 23 years they were waiting this trophy."" Compatriot Bruno Metsu has also clinched two Coach of the Year Awards when he was in charge of Senegal in 2001 and 2002. Ivory Coast were named Team of the Year. Other award winners included Cameroon's Gaell Enganamouit (Women's Player of the Year), TP Mazembe (Club of the Year), Nigeria Under-23 midfielder Oghenekaro Etebo (Most Promising Talent) and Nigeria's Under-17 star Victor Osimhen (Youth Player of the Year). Charles Kumi Gyamfi (Ghana) and Samuel Mbappe Leppe (Cameroon) were recognised as African Legends."
583,07/01/2016,23:42,Aubameyang dethrones Toure as African Player of Year,Gabon and Borussia Dortmund star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang on Thursday upstaged favourite Yaya Toure to win a first African Player of the Year Award.,"In a vote of coaches and technical directors of Confederation of African Football (CAF) member-nations, Aubameyang tallied 143 points ahead of Manchester City and Ivory Coast star Toure, who scored 136 points and was bidding for a fifth successive award. Swansea City and Ghana striker Andre Ayew was third on 112 points. It was sweet revenge for Aubameyang after he lost the 2014 prize to Toure who scooped the prestigious individual accolade in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The 26-year-old Gabon skipper was in outstanding form for German Bundesliga club Dortmund in the year under review. He has also had his best start to a season since arriving from Saint-Etienne in 2013, scoring 18 goals in 17 Bundesliga games and 27 in all competitions. That kind of form has seen him linked with a winter transfer window move away from the Bundesliga with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United all linked with him. Frenchman Herve Renard, who led the Ivory Coast to the 2015 African Cup of Nations, was named Coach of the Year. This was his second such award after the 47-year-old also led Zambia to upset favourites Ivory Coast to lift a first-ever Nations Cup trophy in 2012. Compatriot Bruno Metsu has also clinched two Coach of the Year Awards when he was in charge of Senegal in 2001 and 2002. Ivory Coast were named Team of the Year.

Charles Kumi Gyamfi (Ghana) and Samuel Mbappe Leppe (Cameroon) were recognised as African Legends. Gabon president Ali Bongo Ondimba paid tribute to Aubameyang who will be key to the country's hopes of lifting the African Cup of Nations on home soil in 2017. ""The epitome of commitment and success at the highest level, this exceptional Gabonese demonstrated dazzling intuition and an attack of unparalleled velocity,"" said the Gabon president in a statement. ""His genius is a major asset for the Panthers in preparation for the next African Cup of Nations"
584,07/01/2016,16:04,United end Januzaj's Borussia loan deal,"Manchester United have ended Adnan Januzaj's season-long loan deal with Borussia Dortmund early, the Premier League side announced on Thursday.","The 20-year-old Belgium international returns to Old Trafford having barely played in the Bundesliga with both clubs agreeing it was in the player's best interests to end the arrangement. A United statement read: ""Borussia Dortmund has agreed to cancel the loan agreement for Adnan Januzaj. Adnan will rejoin the first-team squad immediately. ""He has returned to Manchester in order to clarify the details."" Januzaj is understood to have stayed in Manchester over Christmas and was in the directors' box for United's home game against Chelsea on December 28. United have until 1700GMT on Friday to register him for Saturday's FA Cup third-round tie against Sheffield United, although Louis van Gaal may decide to ease the forward back into the first team set-up after a couple of games for the under-21 side instead. Januzaj has not played since Dortmund's 1-0 defeat to PAOK Salonika on December 10. He started only three matches - all in the Europa league - his Bundesliga appearances all coming from off the bench. United will not be able to loan the Belgian out again as he has already played for the Red Devils this year and FIFA rules state players are not allowed to play for more than two clubs per season. Van Gaal had warned Januzaj last year he was taking a risk by joining Dortmund, rather than a lower-profile club where he would have been guaranteed to play more. ""In a club like Borussia Dortmund, all the players there are also of a certain level and I said in advance 'that's a big risk for you because you have to compete with other players of a higher level' and that is not so easy,"" the United manager said in November."
585,05/01/2016,14:07,Top scorer Aubameyang fuels transfer talk,Bundesliga leading scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has fuelled speculation he is set to leave Borussia Dortmund after missing the club's return to training following the winter break on Tuesday.,"A club spokesman said the Gabon international was absent ""for personal reasons"" although reports have linked the 26-year-old with Premier League clubs Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United. ""We all hope he'll (Aubameyang) stay,"" said teammate Matthias Ginter after the first training session in January for a Dortmund side who are second in the Bundesliga, eight points behind leaders Bayern Munich. ""He's very important, on the pitch and off, for what he contributes to the group atmosphere."" Aubameyang has had his best start to a season since arriving from Saint-Etienne in 2013, scoring 18 goals in 17 Bundesliga games and 27 in all competitions. Ginter expressed the same hope regarding midfielder Ilkay Gündogan, reportedly a target for Serie A giants Juventus. ""We would be delighted if they stayed as long as possible with us. I hope they will extend their contracts."" Aubameyang is under contract with Dortmund until 2020 and Gündogan until 2017. Dortmund leave on Thursday for a winter training camp in Dubai, before returning to league action at Borussia Moenchengladbach on January 23."

Werder Bremen are at Bayer Leverkusen in an all-Bundesliga clash for the last place in the semi-finals on April 19 and 20. The final will take place at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 21."

It continues the Gabon captain's amazing scoring run as Aubameyang is currently on course to beat Gerd Mueller's record of 40 Bundesliga goals in the 1971/72 season. At the same stage, more than four decades ago, Mueller had 17 goals, one less than Aubameyang, who has also scored twice in the cup and hit seven in the Europa League. ""I don't know where his limit is and I don't think he knows himself,"" Dortmund's director of sport Michel Zorc told German daily die Welt. ""The most important thing for Pierre-Emerick is to stick to what he's doing, because now the adulation is coming his way from all corners."" Dortmund grabbed their second when Henrik Mkhitaryan's shot went in off the boot of Augsburg defender Ragnar Klavan on 66 minutes in the third-round clash. Bundesliga high-fliers Hertha Berlin had no problems seeing off second-division Nuremberg with a 2-0 away success. Bundesliga bottom side Stuttgart needed extra-time to book their place in the last eight with a 3-2 win over second division Eintracht Braunschweig. Bochum join Heidenheim as the only other second division side in the last eight draw after their 2-0 win at 1860 Munich. In Tuesday's cup ties, a thunderbolt of a volley from Spain international Xabi Alonso booked Bayern Munich's place in the quarter-finals after a 1-0 win over Darmstadt. Having knocked out holders Wolfsburg in the previous round, Pep Guardiola's remain the team to beat in the cup. Werder Bremen went through at Borussia Moenchengladbach as they claimed a shock 4-3 win over the hosts to progress. Javier Hernandez claimed his 16th goal in just 13 games for Bayer Leverkusen when he scored in their 3-1 win at fourth division Unterhaching. The minnows had dispatched top-tier side Ingolstadt and second division RB Leipzig en route to the last 16 and had even stunned Leverkusen by taking an early lead."
588,15/12/2015,12:15,Dortmund's Reus out until 2016 through injury,High-flying Borussia Dortmund must do without Marco Reus for the rest of 2015 as the Germany winger has a groin injury.,"Reus limped off just before half-time in Sunday's 4-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt and although an MRI scan has revealed there is no tear, he will miss Wednesday's German Cup third-round tie at Augsburg and Saturday's league match at Cologne. It's the third time this calendar year that the 26-year-old has been out with a groin injury having missed a couple of weeks of the season back in April and again in November. ""It's a real shame as he was injury-free and in really good shape,"" lamented Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel. Dortmund are second only to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga this season and have set a club record of seven wins and a draw from their eight home games and have been beaten just twice in Germany's top flight. Their tally of 38 points would be enough to put them top of the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. Meanwhile Reus's team-mate Neven Subotic has said he will use the last two games of the year to 'attack' and show Tuchel that he deserves a place in the starting side. The Serbia international is expected to start against Augsburg for a place in the German Cup's quarter-finals. Subotic, who was part of the title-winning sides in 2011 and 2012, has made just two league starts this season under Tuchel, who prefers Greece international Sokratis and Mats Hummels as his centre-back pairing."

It's more than David verses Goliath. I can't really think of a comparison of how big the miracle will need to be if we are to progress,"" said Darmstadt coach Dirk Schuster ahead. ""Our chances, in terms of percentages, are in the single digits, but we travel to Munich with hope and without fear."" The omens are not good for Darmstadt ahead of their third-round clash at Munich's Allianz Arena. They were hammered 4-0 at home by Hertha Berlin last Saturday in the Bundesliga, while Bayern are unbeaten at home this season and beat Darmstadt 3-0 away in September in the Bundesliga. Having knocked holders Wolfsburg out in the second round, German league leaders Bayern are eager to book their place in the last eight as they look to repeat their 2013 treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup titles. But Schuster would love to see his side ruin the Bavarian giants' plans to go into the winter break, which starts Sunday, with a presence in all three competitions. ""Being knocked out by Darmstadt wouldn't be such a nice thing to have under the Christmas tree,"" added Schuster. Bayern have a few injuries to contend with and will be without Arjen Robben and David Alaba, while Franck Ribery is sidelined again after just 15 minutes of his comeback from nearly nine months out with an ankle knock. In other key third-round matches, Borussia Moenchengladbach are at home to Bremen on Tuesday while on Wednesday, 2012 cup winners Borussia Dortmund are at Augsburg, with both teams also in the Europa League's knock-out stages. Dortmund are second only to Bayern in Germany's top flight, but their captain Mats Hummels said they can take nothing for granted against Bavaria's Augsburg, who are unbeaten in their last four matches, but were thrashed 5-1 by Dortmund in the Bundesliga last October. ""Augsburg are in very good condition now having had big problems at the start of the season,"" said Hummels. ""They are always a hard team to beat, we have had good results there in the previous years, which we always had to work hard for. ""I assume we'll have to do the same again."""
590,13/12/2015,19:49,Aubameyang strikes as Dortmund rout Frankfurt,Borussia Dortmund set a new club record in routing ten-man Eintracht Frankfurt 4-1 on Sunday as the Bundesliga's top-scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored his 18th goal in 16 games.,"Second-placed Dortmund's victory gave them a club record seventh win and one draw at home, their best start to a season, as Thomas Tuchel's side came from behind to floor strugglers Frankfurt. Eintracht took the lead when captain Alexander Meier finished off a counter-attack on seven minutes before Henrikh Mkhitaryan equalised for Dortmund on 24 minutes. Frankfurt were reduced to ten-men when midfielder Slobodan Medojevic was sent off for fouling Gonzalo Castro in the area on 44 minutes, but Aubameyang drove the resulting penalty wide as it finished 1-1 at the break. Aubameyang made amends for his earlier miss by converting Shinji Kagawa's pass on 57 minutes while Dortmund captain Mats Hummels made it 3-1 with a long-range strike just four minutes later. Shortly before the final whistle, Adrian Ramos grabbed Dortmund's fourth just minutes after coming off the bench to seal the victory which left Dortmund five points short of leaders Bayern Munich. Aubameyang is on course to break Gerd Mueller's record of 40 Bundesliga goals in a single season. At the same stage of the 1971/72 season, Mueller had scored 17 goals for Bayern Munich. Earlier, Brazilian winger Caiuby hit a late winner as struggling Augsburg shocked Schalke 2-1. Hosts Augsburg took the lead when Dominik Kohr's strike from outside the area cannoned off Hong Jeong-Ho to wrong-foot Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann on 34 minutes. It was centre-back Hong's first Bundesliga goal in his third season with Augsburg and Sead Kolasinac equalised before Caiuby fired home at the far post in the 92nd minute to give Augsburg their first home league win since September and lift them up to 13th. Schalke drop to eighth with just one league win in their last seven games to put pressure on coach Andre Breitenreiter. On Saturday, Robert Lewandowski and Philipp Lahm netted as leaders Bayern Munich laboured to a 2-0 win against Ingolstadt to get back on track after last week's shock defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Gladbach crashed to their first defeat in 11 league games under coach Andre Schubert in a 5-0 hammering at Bayer Leverkusen, for whom Javier Hernandez claimed a hat-trick. 'Chicharito' needed just 13 second-half minutes to score his three goals with ex-Germany striker Stefan Kiessling also scoring either side of half-time for Leverkusen, who are sixth after only their second win in their last nine games. Gladbach are fifth. Hertha Berlin took the chance to leapfrog Gladbach into third when they romped to a 4-0 win at Darmstadt as Bosnia striker Vedad Ibisevic scored twice, Marvin Plattenhardt hit a free-kick and Salomon Kalou netted a fourth. Fresh from Tuesday's Champions League win over Manchester United, which confirmed their place in the last 16 as group winners, fourth-placed Wolfsburg laboured to a 1-1 draw at home to Hamburg. Werder Bremen continue to hover just above the relegation places after a 1-1 draw at home to Cologne as Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah had a first-half penalty saved for the hosts. Hoffenheim enjoyed their first win since September when Jonathan Schmid's first-half goal sealed their 1-0 win at home to Hanover 96 which lifted them to 17th. Stuttgart are bottom again after their goalless draw at Mainz on Friday."

Now the Borussia boss is determined not to give away more points when second-placed Dortmund return to Bundesliga action at their Signal Iduna Park stadium as they try and close the five-point gap behind leaders Bayern against mid-table Eintracht. ""We took a calculated risk against Saloniki by not playing our first team to make sure we are fit for the final three games of the year,"" said Tuchel. ""The situation will be very different againt Frankfurt now. It's going to be a pressure-cooker environment."" Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the German league's top-scorer, plus winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan and defender Soktaris are expected to return to the Dortmund team. Against PAOK, Tuchel gave a debut to 19-year-old midfielder Pascal Stenzel, while Belgium international Adnan Januzaj, who is on loan from Manchester United, made a rare appearance on the wing. Borussia face Augsburg away on Wednesday in the third round of the German Cup before playing Cologne away next Saturday in the final Bundesliga game before the winter break."
592,05/12/2015,21:28,Kagawa rescues Dortmund to trim Bayern's lead,"Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa came off the bench to secure Borussia Dortmund's dramatic 2-1 win at Wolfsburg on Saturday, which trimmed Bayern Munich's Bundesliga lead to five points.","Kagawa netted on 93 minutes with virtually the last kick of the game, just moments after Wolfsburg defender Ricardo Rodriguez had converted a penalty on the stroke of 90 minutes which cancelled out Marco Reus' first-half goal. It was Japan midfielder Kagawa's fourth goal of the season as Dortmund lived up to their 'Monsters of Mentality' nickname by fighting until the whistle. Kagawa came on for Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan on 55 minutes and converted Henrikh Mkhitaryan's final pass for Dortmund's winner. ""It was a great goal which decided the game,"" said Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel. Tuchel was sent to the stands in the game's final moments for kicking out at an advertising hoarding at the Volkswagen Arena following a heated exchange of words with the Wolfsburg bench. ""I was very disappointed that we conceded the penalty, then we scored and I kicked the banner out of a mixture of joy and frustration, said Tuchel. ""I had the feeling after the penalty that we calmly played football just as we had done in the first 35 minutes. ""It's amazing that despite everything we managed to win, but I found it over the top that I was sent to the stands."" Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking said they shot themselves in the foot by giving the ball away straight from kick off following the Rodriguez penalty. ""After the kick-off we gave the ball away and you will be punished, even if you have put in a big effort,"" said the Wolfsburg coach. ""At the start of the game, we made an unspeakable amount of errors and we gave the first goal away. ""It took us until the first half an hour to get the game under control."" Wolfsburg must now prepare for their crunch Champions League game at home to Manchester United on Tuesday. ""We must win the game to progress, so we have to get back to business and prepare for what is a huge game for us,"" said Hecking as his side look to keep their dreams alive of reaching the knock-out stages."

""I definitely want to win the award this year and I try to score in every game."" The 26-year-old has already scored 17 goals in 14 league games this season for Dortmund and the Gabon captain is among the 37 players nominated for the African award. Having hit 25 goals in all competitions this season, he is amongst the favourites to succeed current holder Yaya Toure of Manchester City and the Ivory Coast. Having scored 13, then 16 goals in his first two seasons with Dortmund, Aubameyang has already bettered both tallies this campaign with less than half a season played and scored twice on Sunday in a 4-1 win against Stuttgart. Having made a bet with Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel that he would score 20 goals this season, Aubameyang is just short of winning the wager with his side having scored 40 league goals and second only to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga. ""Three more goals and we can make a new bet,"" said Aubameyang with Dortmund facing three more league games -- against Wolfsburg, Eintracht Frankfurt and Cologne before the winter break."
594,30/11/2015,16:45,Dortmund's Hummels hits back at media criticism,Borussia Dortmund captain Mats Hummels has hit back at criticism from the German media as the World Cup winner struggles for form -- and says Bayern Munich's success is not helping his club's cause.,"Hummels found himself on the bench for second-placed Dortmund on Sunday in their 4-1 win at home to VfB Stuttgart, coming on for the last 10 minutes, after his mistakes led to Borussia conceding goals in their previous two games. The 26-year-old has a contract until 2017 and has again been linked with a multi-million euros move to Manchester United at the end of the season. Hummels says the German media are bored with watching leaders Bayern runaway with this season's Bundesliga title, which means they turned their attention to nearest rivals Dortmund -- and him personally. ""Because it's hard to perhaps find anything negative to say about Bayern, perhaps they are looking at the next biggest team and personalities in football,"" Hummels told German daily Bild. ""Inevitably, you land at Borussia Dortmund and people like Marco Reus, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang or me."" TV pundits have been quick to criticise Hummels, who has failed to capture the superb form he showed in Brazil which helped Germany win the 2014 World Cup. He admitted returning from Brazil overweight last season and has failed to impress this campaign, particularly in the last fortnight. He scored an own-goal in Dortmund's shock 3-1 league defeat at Hamburg 10 days ago, then gave away a penalty in their 1-0 Europa League defeat at Russia's FK Krasnodar last Thursday. ""I definitely feel under-valued and honestly see my performances as being better than you read in most of the media,"" Hummels complained to magazine Kicker. ""I don't know anyone who is more self-critical than me. ""I watch all our games again at home and I know when I have made a mistake and when I haven't. ""I have always addressed any mistakes I have made and will keep doing so. ""It's nothing I duck away from."" Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel insists Hummels was not dropped for the Stuttgart game, but simply started the defender on the bench to rest him, as he has done for other Dortmund stars throughout the season. Borussia's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has said Hummels is not always easy to deal with, something the defender has no problem with. ""I'm a bit more direct, sometimes cynical and sarcastic, that's why I find it perfectly fine that Hans-Joachim Watzke doesn't consider me to be low-maintenance,"" said Hummels. Hummels also scoffed at suggestions there is a problem between him and Tuchel. ""We have no problems with each other, we discuss things openly and we will continue to do so,"" he added."
595,29/11/2015,17:50,Aubameyang nets twice as Dortmund see off Stuttgart,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice on Sunday as second-placed Borussia Dortmund dropped captain Mats Hummels and returned to winning ways with a 4-1 win at home to VfB Stuttgart.,"Gabon striker Aubameyang cemented his status as the Bundesliga's top scorer with his 16th and 17th league goals in 14 games this season after Gonzalo Castro had headed Borussia into an early lead. Daniel Didavi pulled a goal back for strugglers Stuttgart with half-time approaching. But a Georg Niedermeier own-goal left the visitors 3-1 down before Aubameyang grabbed their superb fourth goal and his second to inflict a third straight defeat on Stuttgart. Hummels dominated the pre-match talk, because, despite his status as a World Cup winner with Germany, he found himself on the bench at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park in the wake of poor performances. He scored an own goal in Dortmund's shock 3-1 defeat at Hamburg ten days ago in the Bundesliga, then conceded the penalty which sealed their 1-0 defeat on Thursday at Russia's FK Krasnodar in the Europa League group stages. The 26-year-old came on for the final 10 minutes against Stuttgart for Germany winger Marco Reus with Dortmund 3-1 up. Stuttgart's caretaker coach Jurgen Kramny got off to a losing start after replacing Alexander Zorniger in the wake of last weekend's 4-0 thumping at home to Augsburg and the defeat kept his side third from bottom. Dortmund trimmed Bayern Munich's lead to eight points after the runaway league leaders ground out a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin thanks to goals by Germany forward Thomas Mueller and France Under-21 winger Kingsley Coman on Saturday. Bayern show no signs of loosening their iron grip on the Bundesliga title. They picked up their 13th win from 14 league games to give them 40 from a possible 42 points and this was the first time in eight home games that Bayern failed to score at least four goals. Like Aubameyang, Mueller, who has 13 goals, has already equalled his tally for the whole of last season with less than half the campaign gone. Hertha, who last won in Munich in 1977, are in fifth place after Borussia Moechengladbach leap-frogged them into fourth with a 3-3 draw at Hoffenheim. Gladbach's head coach Andre Schubert preserved his nine-game unbeaten record since taking charge two months ago as USA international Fabian Johnson scored Borussia's late equaliser. Hamburg are up to sixth after their 3-1 win at Werder Bremen in the north German derby. Hamburg raced into an early 2-0 lead as Croatia midfielder Ivo Ilicevic scored on their opening attack, then striker Michael Gregoritsch doubled their lead on 26 minutes. Nigeria's Anthony Ujah pulled a goal back for Werder on 62 minutes, then Germany forward Nicolai Mueller made it 3-1 to Hamburg on 68 minutes when Ilicevic's final pass put him in behind the hosts' defence. Hanover eased the pressure on coach Michael Frontzeck with a 4-0 thumping at home to Ingolstadt which lifted them up to 14th and pulled them away from the relegation zone. Japan striker Yoshinori Muto scored his seventh goal of the season in Mainz's 2-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. His forward partner Yunus Malli added their second to claim his eighth while Frankfurt had captain Alex Meier sent off for a second yellow card."
596,28/11/2015,17:54,Bayern extend Hertha's 38-year wait,Bayern Munich went 11 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin who have now gone 38 years without a win at the German giants.,"With second-placed Borussia Dortmund hosting VfB Stuttgart on Sunday, Bayern took the chance to extend their lead with first-half goals by Germany forward Thomas Mueller and France Under-21 winger Kingsley Coman. Bayern show no signs of loosening their iron-grip on the Bundesliga title as they picked up their 13th win from 14 league games to give them 40 from a possible 42 points. This was the first time in eight home games that Bayern failed to score at least four goals. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola experimented with the starting line-up by pushing Germany centre-back Jerome Boateng into a midfield role, which led to their second goal. They took the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena when Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal's cross found Medhi Benatia, whose shot was heading wide, but Mueller was on hand to head home on 34 minutes. Bayern doubled their lead on 41 minutes when Boateng lobbed the ball into Javi Martinez, whose pass found Coman and the French winger did the rest to make it 2-0 at the break. Hertha, who last won in Munich in 1977, are in fifth place after Borussia Moechengladbach leap-frogged them into fourth with a 3-3 draw at Hoffenheim. Gladbach's head coach Andre Schubert preserved his nine-game unbeaten record in the lead since taking charge two months ago. Borussia took an early lead thanks to USA international Fabian Johnson, who then scored their equaliser to rescue a point. Hoffenheim, chasing their first win since September, took a 3-1 lead just after the break thanks to goals by Steven Zuber, Eugen Polanski and Nadiem Amiri. But Swiss striker Josip Drmic pulled it back to 3-2 for Gladbach before Johnson claimed his second with a superb shot three minutes from time. Hamburg are up to sixth after their 3-1 win at Werder Bremen in the north German derby. Hamburg raced into an early 2-0 lead as Croatia midfielder Ivo Ilicevic scored on their opening attack, then striker Michael Gregoritsch doubled their lead on 26 minutes. Nigeria's Anthony Ujah pulled a goal back for Werder on 62 minutes, then Germany forward Nicolai Mueller made it 3-1 to Hamburg on 68 minutes when Ilicevic's final pass put him in behind the hosts' defence. Hanover eased the pressure on coach Michael Frontzeck with a 4-0 thumping at home to Ingolstadt which lifted them up to 14th and pulled them away from the relegation zone. Japan striker Yoshinori Muto scored his seventh goal of the season in Mainz's 2-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. His forward partner Yunus Malli added their second to claim his eighth while Frankfurt had captain Alex Meier sent off for a second yellow card."
597,28/11/2015,15:14,Dortmund's dynamic duo set to face Stuttgart,Second-placed Borussia Dortmund are set to include fleet-footed forwards Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Marco Reus for Sunday's Bundesliga clash against strugglers Stuttgart.,"Dortmund's dynamic duo, who donned Batman and Robin costumes for a goal celebration in last February's derby win over Schalke, have scored 22 goals between them this season. Striker Aubameyang started the weekend as the league's top scorer with 15 goals from 13 games. ""Things look good with Marco and Auba, so I assume they can play,"" Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel said in Saturday's press conference. The pair were left out of Dortmund's 1-0 Europa League defeat at Russia's FK Krasnodar on Thursday which left them second in Group C, a defeat Tuchel described as ""unnecessary"". Hosts Dortmund are looking to get back to winning ways against Stuttgart after their 3-1 defeat at Hamburg 10 days ago in their last Bundesliga outing. Dortmund are eight points behind Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich and will be favourites at the Signal Iduna Park against a Stuttgart side currently third from bottom. They sacked coach Alexander Zorniger after last Saturday's 4-0 drubbing at home to fellow strugglers Augsburg. Caretaker coach Jurgen Kramny, a former coaching colleague of Tuchel's at both Stuttgart and Mainz, will be on the away bench in Dortmund."
598,21/11/2015,17:53,Wolfsburg warm-up for Moscow by hammering Bremen,Germany striker Max Kruse netted twice in Wolfsburg's 6-0 rout of Werder Bremen in the German league on Saturday to warm-up for Wednesday's key Champions League clash in Moscow.,"In Europe, Wolfsburg are third in Group B, but just a point behind leaders Manchester United ahead of their penultimate group game at bottom side CSKA Moscow in the Russian capital on Wednesday. The Germans still have every chance of qualifying for the knock-out stages and consolidated third in the German league table by hammering Bremen. There was a minute's silence at all Bundesliga grounds this weekend -- the players also wore black armbands -- out of respect for the victims of the Paris terror attacks. Stuttgart's 4-0 thumping at home to Augsburg was delayed by 15 minutes due to the tightened security checks at stadiums across the country. There were no such problems at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena as Bremen gifted their hosts the opener when defender Alejandro Galvez slid the ball into his own net on 11 minutes. Kruse put Wolfsburg 2-0 up at the break by heading home a free-kick then Portugal international Vierinha scored from the right wing on 56 minutes. The floodgates opened when French defensive midfielder, on for the injured Brazil star Luiz Gustavo, stabbed home his shot on 67 minutes. Kruse then set up Netherlands striker Bas Dost on 78 minutes before completing the scoring three minutes from time by converting a cross from Germany team-mate Andre Schuerrle to leave him with five league goals for the season. The result leaves Wolfsburg five points behind second-placed Borussia Dortmund who lost 3-1 at Hamburg on Friday night, while leaders Bayern Munich play at Schalke on Saturday evening. Ex-Manchester United star Javier Hernandez now has 12 goals for Bayer Leverkusen in all competitions after scoring twice in their 3-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Christmas came early for 'Chicharito' in Frankfurt when Eintracht centre-back David Abraham allowed a cross to roll between his legs and the grateful Hernandez stabbed home on 11 minutes. The Mexico striker doubled his tally on 39 minutes when a Hakan Calhanoglu pass split the Frankfurt defence. Hernandez did the rest, but it finished 2-1 at the break when Serbian midfielder Slobodan Medojevic slammed in a powerful header on the stroke of half-time. Calhanoglu made sure of the three points by scoring Leverkusen's third on 72 minutes. Augsburg climbed off the bottom of the table with an emphatic 4-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. Woeful defending by the hosts allowed Augsburg to race into an early 2-0 lead with both goals by midfielder Alexander Esswein. Defender Jan-Ingwer Callsen-Bracker grabbed a third before former South Korea captain Koo Ja-Cheol scored Augsburg's fourth when he hit the top right-hand corner from 10 metres out on 54 minutes. The Rhine derby finished goalless as Mainz drew at Cologne as the hosts abandoned plans to play in a special-edition carnival-themed shirt out of respect for those who died in Paris."
599,21/11/2015,11:34,Tuchel slams Dortmund's 'dramatic' drop in form,Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel admits his side showed a 'dramatic' drop in performance in a shock 3-1 defeat at Hamburg on Friday that dented their Bundesliga title chances.,"Goals from Pierre-Michel Lasogga, Lewis Holtby and a Mats Hummel own-goal put hosts Hamburg 3-0 up before Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted a late consolation for Dortmund, his 15th goal in 13 league games. The win saw Hamburg move up to eighth, but defeat leaves second-placed Dortmund facing the prospect of finishing the weekend eight points behind leaders Bayern Munich if they beat Schalke on Saturday. The start of Friday's game was delayed for safety reasons, adding to the tension just three days after a bomb scare caused Germany's friendly with the Netherlands in Hanover to be postponed and a week after the Paris terror attacks. Tuchel slammed his side for a poor first-half display which left them 2-0 down at the break. ""Especially in the first half, the difference between our usual standards, how we perform as a team, and reality was dramatic,"" fumed Tuchel. ""We deserved to be punished for it. ""I have no explanation for it, but it was obvious from the first minute that we lacked the necessary body language and attitude. ""It wasn't the performance we imagined and we also didn't see it coming. ""It was far too little to achieve a good result in the Bundesliga. ""There was no indication beforehand. We were very diligent and worked hard in the international break. ""Even during the final training session today (Friday) or during the team meeting, there was no hint of such a performance. ""The lesson is simple: with that body language, with that sort of performance and with so little attention being paid, you're never going to get anything (out of a game)."" Meanwhile, Hamburg coach Bruno Labbadia praised his side's performance. ""Beating Dortmund is never easy. Given the quality of their side we weren't sure of the victory, even at 3-0 up,"" he added. Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki said the performance was his team's ""worst"" of the season, surpassing their 5-1 rout at Bayern's Allianz Arena at the start of October. Defeat in Hamburg ended their seven-match winning streak and defender Marcel Schmelzer said lessons must be learnt. ""We played very badly in the first half and couldn't implement what we had planned,"" said Schmelzer. ""We didn't move enough in front of their goal and we made individual mistakes. ""It's not enough in the Bundesliga if you don't put in 100 percent and now we need to go away and scrutinise ourselves and calmly analyse what happened."""
600,20/11/2015,23:36,Hamburg stun Dortmund on tense night in Germany,Hamburg dented Borussia Dortmund's title hopes with a 3-1 win on Friday in a Bundesliga clash which started 15 minutes late due to heightened security measures following the Paris terror attacks.,"Goals from Pierre-Michel Lasogga, Lewis Holtby and a Mats Hummel own goal sealed the three points for Hamburg who moved up to eighth in the table while defeat left Dortmund facing the prospect of slipping eight points behind leaders Bayern Munich by the end of the weekend. Hamburg coach Bruno Labbadia was delighted with his team's performance. ""We didn't let them come too far forward and we stayed true to our tactics. It is never easy against Dortmund, they are a great side,"" he said. Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki said the performance was his team's worst of the campaign. ""We just weren't as aggressive as them. That's the worst game we have played this year -- we will have to see where to improve,"" said the keeper. ""We had won seven matches in a row before this game, so all we can do is go back and try and make it better."" The start of Friday's game was delayed for safety reasons, adding to the tension just three days after a bomb scare caused Germany's friendly with the Netherlands in Hanover to be postponed. Heavy traffic outside Hamburg's Volksparkstadion, as well as tightened security checks being carried out in the aftermath of last Friday's Paris attacks which killed 130 people, caused the 1930GMT kick-off to be put back. The German team had experienced first-hand the events in Paris when suicide bombers blew themselves up outside the Stade de France where the world champions were playing France. With a giant French tricolour flying outside the stadium on Friday, fans and VIPs -- including German legend Uwe Seeler -- were patted down by security guards. Both sides, wearing black armbands, and 57,000 fans then observed a minute's silence before the kick-off to remember the Paris victims. On an emotional night, a minute of applause followed for former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt who died last week at the age of 96 and was a Hamburg native. On the pitch, Hamburg were ahead after 19 minutes against their fellow former European champions. Ivo Ilicevic was brought down by Dortmund's Swiss goalkeeper Roman Burki who was booked for his troubles. Up stepped Lasogga to fire the penalty into the corner for his sixth goal of the campaign. At the other end, prolific Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who went into the game as the Bundesliga's joint-leading scorer with 14 goals, was having a low key night as were his teammates. By half-time, Hamburg were 2-0 ahead when Nicolai Mueller broke away from his markers before finding Holtby who scored past Burki in the left-hand corner. Aubameyang missed the target early in the second half with a chip with the outside of his boot although Marco Reus, in space, was screaming for a pull-back. Dortmund skipper Hummels did put the ball in the net in the 55th minute with a fine, close-range header. Sadly for his team, it was an own-goal as Hummels misdirected a Hamburg corner past a stunned Burki. Hamburg keeper Rene Adler was then called into action to deny Aubameyang from close range and was then quick to smartly dive to his left to keep out a fierce free-kick from Ilkay Guendogan. Aubameyang pulled a goal back three minutes from time and had another ruled out for offside but Hamburg were worthy winners on the night."
601,18/11/2015,21:27,Dortmund's Christmas tree gets a Schalke flag,The towering Christmas tree in Dortmund's city centre has become a good-natured battle ground between rival football fans after a Schalke flag was spotted flying from the 45-metre giant.,"Just 35 kilometres (21 miles) separates Borussia Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park stadium from Schalke's Veltins Arena in the Ruhr Valley and there is an intense rivalry between the neighbouring clubs. Borussia won the Ruhr derby 3-2 at home a fortnight ago, but Schalke fans had the last laugh by flying their team's blue and white flag from the huge Christmas tree in the centre of Dortmund last weekend. Anyone supporting Gelsenkirchen-based Schalke in Dortmund can expect trouble and the scaffolding company responsible for ensuring the 40,000kg (40 tonnes) tree stands safely has been told to pay a tongue-in-cheek fine to charity. ""I have informed the scaffolding company that I expect a penalty of 500 euros $532),"" the tree's organiser Hans-Peter Arens told local newspaper WAZ. The scaffolding firm responsible is based in Dortmund, but a large number of their employees hail from Bottrop, near Gelsenkirchen, -- deep in the heartland of Schalke fans. A Dortmund supporter in the team of scaffolders restored order on Monday by flying a yellow and black Borussia flag from the tree and Arens said there will be no fine on this occasion. ""I can hardly hand out a fine when there is a Borussia Dortmund flag hanging from the tree,"" he quipped."

605,08/11/2015,18:56,'Batman returns' as Aubameyang seals derby win,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck again as Batman on Sunday when he revealed a Caped Crusader themed T-shirt after scoring Borussia Dortmund's winner in their 3-2 derby victory over Schalke.,"The Gabon international slotted what proved to be the winning goal on 48 minutes in the Bundesliga, then received a yellow card after pulling off his playing shirt in celebration to reveal a T-shirt bearing the text 'Do you remember?' under the Batman logo. It was referring to the Batman mask and cape outfit Aubameyang donned in last February's derby victory when he also scored in a 3-0 win over Schalke, when Germany winger Marco Reus wore a Robin mask to play the role of his sidekick. ""I am just happy that we won this tough game,"" said Aubameyang, who wore Batman-themed basketball boots in the pre-match pitch inspection and explained why he wore the yellow T-shirt bearing the Batman logo. ""It was to remember the show we had last season with Marco. I dedicate my goal to him,"" added Aubameyang after Reus missed Sunday's match with a groin injury. Aubameyang is a self-confessed fan of the comic book crime-fighting hero, often wears hats brandishing the famous emblem and even had the Batman logo shaved into his scalp in the 2013/14 season by his French hairdresser. Having been ticked off by former Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp for wearing the Batman cape back in February, Aubameyang revealed he had not sought permission on this occasion from current Borussia boss Thomas Tuchel. ""I didn't tell him, because he would have told me not to do it,"" admitted Aubameyang, who has scored 14 league goals this season and is the Bundesliga's joint top-scorer alongside Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski. However, the club clearly approved of Sunday's superhero celebration as they changed the profile picture on the official Borussia Dortmund Twitter feed to the Batman logo, as they did on their Facebook page under the text 'Batman returns'."
606,08/11/2015,17:36,Aubameyang strikes again as Dortmund edge tense derby,Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubamenyang claimed his 14th Bundesliga goal of the season as Borussia Dortmund edged past arch-rivals Schalke to win a tense Ruhr derby 3-2 on Sunday.,"Aubameyang joined Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski as the league's top scorer by netting Dortmund's third after Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa and Germany defender Matthias Ginter had netted at Borussia's Signal Iduna Park stadium. Schalke are now winless in their last six matches, but the Royal Blues fought to the end as Netherlands striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored goals in each half following mistakes in the Dortmund defence. ""There was no need for it to have been so tense at the end,"" admitted Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel as his side enjoyed their seventh-straight win in all competitions. ""We had so many high-quality chances that we could have made it 4-1, but I had the feeling that the players didn't want to make any mistakes, which made us tense."" The result leaves second-placed Dortmund five points behind Bundesliga leaders Bayern, and eight points clear of third-placed Wolfsburg, while Schalke stay fifth. After Kagawa gave Dortmund a 30th-minute lead with a rare header, Huntelaar equalised three minutes later after Borussia captain Mats Hummels gave the ball away. The hosts then netted twice as Ginter was left unmarked at a corner on 43 minutes as it finished 2-1 at the break. Aubameyang then slotted what proved to be the winning goal after a superb final pass from Gonzalo Castro, who started on the left wing in place of injured Germany star Marco Reus. Aubameyang received a yellow card after pulling off his shirt in celebration to reveal a T-shirt bearing the text 'Do you remember?' under the Batman logo, having donned a ""Caped Crusader"" outfit in the derby last February when he also scored in a 3-0 win over Schalke. But Huntelaar grabbed his second when Dortmund centre-back Sokratis tried to back-heel a cross, but the ball landed at the feet of the Dutch player who slotted home on 71 minutes. Schalke's Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg hit the post with ten minutes to go, then cleared a Dortmund shot off the line in the dying stages. Aubameyang is again the league's joint top-scorer alongside Lewandowski, who netted his 14th league goal in Bayern's 4-0 win over VfB Stuttgart on Saturday. The Bavarian giants' star-studded attack ran riot with Arjen Robben, Douglas Costa and Thomas Mueller also getting on the scoresheet as defeat pushed Stuttgart back into the bottom three. Bayern have turned the Allianz Arena into a fortress by scoring 28 goals in their last six home games, conceding just three, and have now claimed 34 points from 36 and are the only unbeaten team in Germany's top flight. Augsburg remain bottom of the league after their 2-1 defeat at home to Werder Bremen on Sunday when Peru veteran Claudio Pizarro, 37, scored his first goal since his return from Bayern. Midfielder Fin Bartels doubled the visitors lead on 69 minutes before Augsburg defender Paul Verhaegh netted a late penalty as Bremen moved up to 14th. Wolfsburg, last season's runners-up, are 13 points adrift of Bayern after crashing to a 2-0 defeat at Mainz on Saturday as Pablo de Blasis and Yunus Mali scored. Wolfsburg also had Germany midfielder Julian Draxler sent off early on. Fellow Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen were also beaten as they suffered a 2-1 defeat at home to neighbours Cologne in the Rhine derby as defender Dominic Maroh scored the visitors goals while Javier Hernandez scored for the sixth match running. His Leverkusen team was reduced to 10 men when defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos was shown a red card. Hoffenheim remain second from bottom after their goalless draw with Eintracht Frankfurt while Hamburg drew 1-1 at Darmstadt as Pierre-Michel Lasogga's first-half penalty was cancelled out by Marcel Heller's equaliser for hosts Darmstadt. Borussia Moenchengladbach had their six-match winning streak under caretaker coach Andre Schubert ended by a goalless draw at home to Ingolstadt. On Friday, Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou grabbed a hat-trick to steer Hertha Berlin to a 3-1 win at Hanover and into the top four."
607,07/11/2015,13:48,Dortmund without injured Reus for derby clash,Borussia Dortmund's goal-machine shows no sign of slowing for Sunday's crunch Bundesliga derby clash against Schalke 04 -- even without injured Germany winger Marco Reus.,"Dortmund have scored 68 goals in 21 games so far this season under new coach Thomas Tuchel, but will be without groin-strain victim Reus for the home derby against Schalke. Reus picked up the injury while scoring Dortmund's opening goal in Thursday's 4-0 rout of Armenia's FK Qabala in the Europa League and his place on Dortmund's left wing is set to go to Jonas Hofmann or Gonzalo Castro. Even after Reus went off, Dortmund still managed to score three more goals through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan. ""We still have a wide number of players who are dangerous,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc as only leaders Bayern Munich have scored more goals in the Bundesliga. ""That's what makes a good team."" While Dortmund have had no trouble finding the net, Schalke have struggled in front of goal and only netted 14 goals in 11 games this season. That's just one more than Borussia's Gabon striker Aubameyang has managed on his own in Germany's top flight this season in a total tally of 21 goals in all competitons. ""It's a really important game for Dortmund fans... you can lose all your matches, but the derby is the one they want you to win,"" said Aubameyang. ""I'm sure we'll win, because we're at home and the team is playing well."" Borussia are second in the table and have won their last six games, while Schalke are down to fifth and winless in their last five, but form counts for little in a derby, according to Royal Blues midfielder Leon Goretzka. ""You shouldn't pay too much attention to what the current table says before a derby,"" he said after their 1-1 draw on Thursday at Sparta Prague in the Europa League. ""Even if we're 18th and Dortmund are first, you can still win."" Dortmund trounced Schalke 3-0 when the teams last met at Borussia's Signal Iduna Park stadium in February as the hosts fired in 31 shots on goal, while the Royal Blues set a league record low of just three in reply. ""We have a little something to make up,"" admitted Schalke's goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann. Schalke's top scorer is teenage rising star Leroy Sane, who has netted four times in 11 games and his eye-catching displays have led to the 19-year-old being called up to Germany's senior squad for forthcoming internationals against France and the Netherlands."
608,31/10/2015,18:00,Dortmund trim Bayern's lead with win at Bremen,Second-placed Borussia Dortmund closed the gap behind German league leaders Bayern Munich to five points on Saturday as Marco Reus netted twice in their 3-1 win at Werder Bremen.,"Reus fired in the opening and third goals, but Borussia should have won by more as Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang squandered three clear chances. Right winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan capped a superb display with Dortmund's second having provided the final pass for both of Reus' goals. After Bayern were held to a goalless draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday, Dortmund took the chance to trim the Bavarian giants' lead. They have now scored 18 goals in their last four games and a staggering 64 in 20 games this season under new coach Thomas Tuchel. Dortmund opened the scoring after nine minutes when Mkhitaryan fired in a cross, Aubameyang let the ball roll to Reus, who fired home at the far post. Bremen levelled when Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah tapped home on 32 minutes after Matthias Ginter cleared off the line. A superb cross off the offside of the boot from Mats Hummels found Mkhitaryan at the far post just before the break to head home on 44 minutes. Reus added a third after Mkhitaryan's final pass split the defence as the defeat left Bremen 14th in the table. Borussia Moenchengladbach earned their sixth straight victory to go fourth with a 4-1 win at Hertha Berlin having been bottom in September with five defeats. Gladbach blitzed Hertha with two goals in as many first-half minutes at Berlin's Olympic Stadium from left-back Oscar Wendt, plus a solo effort from Brazil striker Raffael. Gladbach grabbed a third when Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka drilled home a penalty on 55 minutes after Ivory Coast winger Ibrahima Traore was fouled in the area. Alexander Baumjohann converted a late penalty for Hertha after being fouled before Havard Nordtveit grabbed Gladbach's fourth in added time. The result boosts Gladbach ahead of Tuesday's Champions League match at home to 2015 finalists Juventus while Hertha drop to sixth. Gladbach are now just two points behind Schalke, who needed a late Leroy Sane equaliser in their 1-1 draw at home to Ingolstadt after the Bavarian visitors took a shock first-half lead. Bochum-born Cameroon internationals Joel and Marvin Matip faced each other for the first time with Joel at centre-back for Schalke while Marvin captained Ingolstadt. Huub Stevens picked up a point in his first game as coach of Hoffenheim in their goalless draw at Cologne. Caretaker coach Stevens has been tasked with keeping second-from-bottom Hoffenheim in order for 28-year-old Julian Nagelsmann to make history next season as the Bundesliga's youngest head coach. Japan striker Yoshinori Muto claimed a hat-trick to rescue a dramatic point for mid-table Mainz in their 3-3 draw at bottom side Augsburg. Having given Mainz a 2-0 lead before Augsburg roared back with three unanswered goals, Muto saved his best for last with a 93rd-minute strike."
609,28/10/2015,22:23,Dortmund run riot in seven-goal thrashing,Borussia Dortmund ran riot on Wednesday as they demolished second division Paderborn 7-1 to book their place in the third round of the German Cup.,"With top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang on the bench, right-winger Gonzalo Castro was Paderborn's main tormentor with two goals and two assists in Dortmund's biggest win of the season so far. Paderborn took a shock lead through ex-Wolfsburg striker Srdjan Lakic after 21 minutes, but it lasted just four minutes as Thomas Tuchel's team let the goals fly. Colombia striker Adrian Ramos slotted home the hosts' first, then set up Castro before Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa netted just before the half-time whistle to make it 3-1 at the break. Dortmund's Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan then netted a penalty before Castro claimed their fifth. Henrikh Mkhitaryan set up Lukasz Piszczek for a tap in, then slammed home the seventh himself just before the final whistle. This was the first defeat Paderborn's new coach, ex-Germany international Stefan Effenberg, has suffered in his three games since taking charge. ""We're happy with the amount of goals and chances we created,"" said Dortmund coach Tuchel. ""The manner of the win was also pleasing and perhaps the early goal we conceded gave us the necessary sharpness and concentration."" It was the highest score of the second-round cup matches, with Bayern Munich knocking out holders Wolfsburg with a 3-1 away win on Tuesday. Dortmund, who thrashed Augsburg 5-1 on Sunday, have now scored 61 goals this season in just 19 games and are second in the Bundesliga behind runaway leaders Bayern. The draw for the third round, to be played in December, will be made on Sunday."
610,27/10/2015,15:23,'Tiger' Effenberg out to bite Dortmund in cup clash,"Just two weeks into his first coaching job at second division Paderborn, ex-Germany international Stefan Effenberg is eyeing a German Cup giant-killing at Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday.","The 47-year-old, nicknamed 'the Tiger', has had an immediate impact with two league wins to haul Paderborn away from the relegation places, but faces a big test after high-flying Dortmund hammered Bundesliga bottom side Augsburg 5-1 on Sunday. Nevertheless, Effenberg is not phased by taking his team to Dortmund following wins over lowly Eintracht Braunschweig and Union Berlin in Germany's second tier. ""Dortmund is a very good team, but it is our mission to win there,"" said Effenberg, who won the last of his 35 caps in 1998, ahead of the German Cup second-round clash at Borussia's Westfalenstadion. ""We'll be ready. We also have weapons and we will use them."" Under new coach Thomas Tuchel, Dortmund have lost just once this season with forwards Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Marco Reus having already scored 29 goals between them in all competitions. Borussia are second only to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga. ""We will approach the game respectfully,"" said Tuchel. ""It is our job to see everything runs on the expected track."" But Effenberg is backing his midfielders Moritz Stoppelkamp and Suleyman Koc to deal with Dortmund's fleet-footed attack and test the hosts' defence. ""Stoppelkamp and Koc are currently in good shape,"" said Effenberg dryly. The pick of the round sees holders Wolfsburg host Bayern on Tuesday, while Schalke host Borussia Moenchengladbach on Wednesday just three days after the teams last met. Gladbach beat Schalke 3-1 at home last Sunday in the Bundesliga and the visitors finished with 10 men at Borussia Park after defensive midfielder Johannes Geis was shown a straight red card. His horror tackle earned him a five-match ban, including the cup match, and left Gladbach's Andre Hahn with a fractured leg and torn cruciate knee ligament. The Borussia midfielder will not play again this season."
611,26/10/2015,16:15,Greek defender Papastathopoulos extends Dortmund deal,"Greek international defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos has extended his contract with Borussia Dortmund until 2019, the Bundesliga club announced on Monday.","The 27-year-old, who normally operates in central defence and joined the eight-time German champions in 2013 from Werder Bremen, is a regular starter in Thomas Tuchel's side who are currently second and seven points behind leaders Bayern Munich. The Greek international began his career at AEK Athens in 2005 before moving to Serie A and spells with Genoa and AC Milan, with whom he won the Italian title in 2011. He played in all four of Greece's World Cup matches in 2014, and scored a late equaliser against Costa Rica in a 1-1 draw in the last 16 before the team were eventually eliminated 5-3 on penalties."
612,25/10/2015,17:51,Aubameyang hits hat-trick as Dortmund down Augsburg,Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted a hat-trick on Sunday as Borussia Dortmund ran riot in a 5-1 home win over Augsburg to stay second in the Bundesliga.,"Dortmund trimmed the gap at the top back to seven points behind run-away leaders Bayern Munich as Aubameyang took his tally to 13 goals in 10 league games to become the league's joint top-scorer alongside Bayern's Robert Lewandowski. This was an emphatic victory for Dortmund, who tore the Augsburg defence to pieces as Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa set up three of the goals. Aubameyang claimed the third hat-trick in his two years at Dortmund. He opened his account by finishing off a superb move for the opener on 18 minutes, started by right-back Matthias Ginter on the flank, as a series of quick passes saw Ilkay Gundogan provide the striker with a simple tap in. Reus doubled the lead on 21 minutes when he fired home a superbly worked cross from Kagawa and the fleet-footed winger claimed his second with Kagawa again providing the final pass. It was 3-0 at the break, but Augsburg striker Raul Bobadilla pulled a goal back when he out-jumped Mats Hummels from a free-kick to head home on 49 minutes. It proved to be no more than a consolation as Aubameyang grabbed his second on 85 minutes, then took advantage of another good Kagawa pass to delay his shot before beating Augsburg goalkeeper Roman Burki on 91 minutes. On Saturday, Arjen Robben netted on his return from injury as Bayern romped to a 4-0 home win against Cologne to claim their 10th straight win this season and 1000th victory in the Bundesliga. Netherlands captain Robben scored in his first match since August after a groin strain while Arturo Vidal, Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet. Wolfsburg stayed fourth with a 1-0 win at Darmstadt as Daniel Caligiuri hit their 78th minute winner. Fresh from their 4-4 draw at home to Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday, Bayer Leverkusen had to come from 2-0 down before beating Stuttgart 4-3 in another thriller. Stuttgart took a 2-0 lead through Martin Harnik and Daniel Didavi before Germany winger Karim Bellarabi made it 2-1 on 57 minutes. Midfielder Lukas Rupp netted for the visitors' to make it 3-1 with an hour played when two goals in two minutes levelled the scores before Swiss striker Admir Mehmedi netted the 89th-minute winner. The victory lifted Leverkusen to sixth while Stuttgart remain in the bottom three. Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah scored twice as Werder Bremen broke their five-match losing streak with a 3-1 win at Mainz where Japan striker Yoshinori Muto scored the hosts' consolation goal in the 90th minute. The result lifted Bremen out of the relegation zone and up to 14th while Mainz dropped to 13th. Midfielder Marc Stendera was Eintracht Frankfurt's star with both of their second-half goals in a 2-1 comeback victory at Hanover 96, who hang just above the relegation places. Hertha Berlin are fifth after their 1-0 win at Bavarian side Ingolstadt on Saturday night when ex-Bayern Munich midfielder Mitchell Weiser scored the winner after just 11 minutes. Ten-man Hoffenheim are second-from-bottom after their 1-0 defeat to Hamburg on Friday thanks to Pierre-Michel Lasogga's late winner. Hoffenheim's Bosnian defender Ermin Bicakcic was sent off for a second yellow card."
613,22/10/2015,19:27,Aubameyang on fire for Dortmund,Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang fired in a Europa League hat-trick for Borussia Dortmund on Thursday as Tottenham slipped up 2-1 in Anderlecht and new Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp prepared for his Anfield bow.,"Klopp's Liverpool drew with Tottenham last weekend and Spurs got off to a dream start in Brussels. Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen slotted past Silvio Proto on four minutes after a fluffed clearance from Senegal international Serigne Mbodji. But Anderlecht, who lost to the north Londoners in the 1984 UEFA Cup final, were back level before the quarter of an hour when right back Guillaume Gillet volleyed in a corner past Hugo Lloris. The visitors had a goal disallowed on the half hour when Erik Lamela's effort was deemed offside. Anderlecht bagged the points on 75 minutes when substitute Frank Acheampong crossed from the left for in-form Italian Stefano Okaka to charge into the box to slide the ball past Lloris despite one of his boots having fallen off. Anderlecht moved up level with Spurs on four points in Group J topped by Monaco, 1-0 winners over Qarabag. Klopp led Dortmund to two German titles and a Champions League final and the Bundesliga side brushed aside Azerbaijan's FK Qabala 3-1 in Baku. Qabala had not conceded in 450 minutes of European football at the Bakcell Arena until Aubameyang opened the scoring on 31 minutes with a curling 25-metre effort. Seven minutes later he doubled the visitors' advantage from close range, and got his third in the second half when he pounced on a loose ball after keeper Dmytro Bezotosniy produced a fine save to deny substitute Sven Bender. Dodo got a stoppage time consolation goal for Qabala. The win for new boss Thomas Tuchel left Dortmund top of Group C. Italian Serie A leaders Fiorentina came unstuck 2-1 at home to Lech Poznan of Poland to leave them footing Group I. In Rome, Lazio were down to 10-men after six minutes when Mauricio was sent off after a foul on Jorgen Skjelvik. Despite the numerical imbalance Alessandro Matri slotted the ball home to fire the Italians into a first half lead with Felipe Andersen and Antonio Candreva completing a 3-1 defeat of Rosenborg to leave them three points clear in Group G. Sporting Lisbon routed Albanian visitors Skenderbeu 5-1 for their first win in Group H headed by Lokomitiv Moscow, held 1-1 by Besiktas. Among the teams playing later were Klopp's Liverpool, who host Rubin Kazan from Russia. A disappointing 1-1 draw at home to Sion on matchday two left Liverpool with just two points from their first two Group B fixtures, but the Anfield faithful will hope the arrival of Klopp can spark an upturn in fortunes. Rubin, bottom of the group on one point, have also changed their coach since the group stage draw was made as Valeri Chaly took over as caretaker boss from Rinat Bilyaletdinov in September after the Kazan-based side lost six of their first seven league games."
614,16/10/2015,22:57,Dortmund and Tuchel enjoy winning return at Mainz,"Borussia Dortmund got back to winning ways on Friday with a 2-0 victory at Mainz 05, as coach Thomas Tuchel returned to his former club.","It was the first time Tuchel had been back to the Coface Arena since quitting as Mainz boss at the end of the 2013-14 season. German international Marco Reus opened the scoring for Dortmund after 18 minutes, but then missed a penalty just after half-time. Armenian striker Henrik Mkhitaryan made the points safe for the visitors when he converted Dortmund's second goal on 82 minutes as news of the club's former coach Jurgen Klopp dominated European football news in the buildup. Klopp, who led Dortmund to back-to-back German titles in 2011 and 2012, as well as the 2013 Champions League final, takes charge of Liverpool on Saturday in his English debut at Tottenham. With Tuchel very much the new man in favour at Dortmund, Friday's victory ended a poor run of two draws and a 5-1 drubbing at the hands of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena a fortnight ago. Dortmund move within four points of Bayern, having played a game more, while Mainz slip to ninth after their fifth defeat of the campaign. Dortmund's Gabon winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang failed to extend his record run of having scored in all previous eight league games this season. Bayern put their perfect record of eight wins from eight matches on the line away to Werder Bremen in the pick of Saturday's fixtures while Schalke and Hertha Berlin meet in a battle of third and fourth-placed sides."
615,15/10/2015,02:05,Buoyant Bayern eye more goal records in Bremen,Thomas Tuchel is looking to break Borussia Dortmund's winless streak at former club Mainz on Friday while runaway league leaders Bayern Munich aim to send more Bundesliga goal records tumbling in Bremen.,"Bayern's 5-1 drubbing of Dortmund in Munich a fortnight ago opened an ominous seven-point lead at the top of the table as Pep Guardiola's side look to win a fourth straight league title this season. Under new coach Tuchel, Dortmund won their first 11 games in all competitions, including five league victories to top the table, but consecutive draws to Hoffenheim and Darmstadt saw them throw away four points and drop to second before the Munich mauling. Borussia are winless in their last four games and need to beat mid-table Mainz to maintain their second place, with arch rivals Schalke just a point behind. Dortmund have won nine of their 18 meetings against Mainz and enjoyed a 4-2 win at home in February as Tuchel takes his team to the Coface Arena for the first time since quitting at the end of the 2013/14 season. Gabon winger Pierre-Emerick Aubamenyang will be out to extend his phenomenal league record run of having scored in all eight league games so far this season. Bayern head to Bremen's Weserstadion on Saturday looking for their 12th straight win this season having won 4-0 and 7-0 on their last two visits. The Bavarian giants have won all of the last nine games against Werder with 39 goals scored and just six conceded. Bremen have lost their last four games while Bayern are in goal-scoring form as Robert Lewandowski has netted 12 times in seven games and Thomas Mueller has scored eight goals in as many leagues games. The pair have scored 20 of Bayern's 28 goals so far and Mueller says the league record of 101 goals scored by Munich legends Gerd Mueller, Uli Hoeness and Co. back in the 1971/72 season could be under threat. ""It is theoretically possible, that we could score over a 100 goals with this team,"" Mueller told Munich-based newspaper TZ. ""We won't be defined by it and we're not going out just focused on scoring goals, but we have fun playing football and are keen on success."" Bayern are set to be without winger Kingsley Coman after the France Under-21 winger returned from international duty with a thigh strain. Guardiola is set to welcome back defender Holger Badstuber and winger Arjen Robben, who have both returned to training after lengthy injury lay-offs. ""This season is the best we have played since Pep Guardiola arrived,"" said midfielder Javi Martinez. ""We're playing unbelievably well, we are solid in every aspect, but we have to continue like that. ""We have to do exactly the same in the remaining matches. ""It won't bring us anything if we're good now and then let it go late in the season."" There will be an interesting battle to stay up near the top of the table on Saturday when Schalke, in third, host fourth-placed Hertha Berlin who are unbeaten in their last three games and just two points behind their rivals. Schalke won six games on the trot before crashing to a 3-0 defeat last time out while Hertha romped to a 3-0 win at home to Hamburg as striker Vedad Ibisevic netted twice to leave him with four goals in five games this season.

The 48-year-old has a contract to manage the Merseyside giants until June 2018 and will take charge of his first Premier League game against Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. Asked if he had already secured commitments in funding for the winter transfer window, Klopp said that was a subject ""that does not interest me at all"". ""We are now in October and I still don't know how many games there are until winter. But there are a few, and we will first look at our own people,"" said Klopp, who started his first training with his new club Monday.

All the best at The Kop, Jurgen Klopp! All the best @LFC!,"" the Bundesliga club said in a tweet. The short message is inspired by the lyrics of The Beatles' ""A Day in the Life"" -- it starts with the line: ""I read in the news today, of boy"" -- and came with a photo montage of Klopp running across the street like the cover of the Liverpool band's iconic Abbey Road. The effort sparked an equally musical response from FC Liverpool: ""Danke, @BVB! You'll Never Walk Alone."" Former Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said Klopp is a perfect fit for Liverpool and that he had arrived at the Premier League club at the right time. ""It will definitely be a long term project for him. He can really build on it and get a lot from it. With his emotional character and enthusiasm, he is a 100 percent good fit for Liverpool,"" Hitzfeld told Sky Sport News. Hitzfeld added that Klopp would strengthen Liverpool as he would have a say in transfers. Newspaper Die Welt warned Klopp, however, that he was ""playing with his reputation"" in accepting the job, noting the expectations placed on him by fans to revive the club that is languishing in 10th place. But transforming Liverpool would require ""time and patience"". ""One can only hope that Klopp will be able to get results efficiently in the high-speed Premier League environment. Otherwise he could quickly squander his excellent reputation,"" warned Die Welt."

Jeff Schlupp, a Ghana team-mate of Ayew, Nigerian Idion Ighalo, Senegalese Sadio Mane and Congolese Yannick Bolasie were the other Premier League marksmen"
619,04/10/2015,21:41,Bayern's Dortmund thrashing warns rivals: Mueller,Thomas Mueller said Bayern Munich's 5-1 trashing of second-placed Borussia Dortmund sent a signal to their German rivals that they will not release their iron grip on the Bundesliga.,"It seems foolish to suggest the German league title race is over with October barely begun, but Bayern's seven-point lead already has an ominous look having won the title by 10, 19 and 25 points respectively in each of the last three seasons. Pep Guardiola's side are on course to win an unprecedented fourth consecutive Bundesliga title and Dortmund were powerless to prevent their 15-game unbeaten run being ended in emphatic fashion at Munich's Allianz Arena on Sunday. With just under a quarter of the league season gone, Bayern are in a commanding position in Germany's top flight having thrashed both last season's runners-up Wolfsburg and current deputies Dortmund by the same heavy scoreline. Third-placed Schalke had earlier slipped to a 3-0 home defeat to Cologne, suggesting they cannot mount a realistic challenge to Bayern over the season. Bayern's Robert Lewandowski scored a brace, taking his tally to 12 in his last four games, after Mueller's double included a first-half penalty before Mario Goetze grabbed Bayern's fifth to compound his former club's misery. ""It was a big win -- seven points clear and the manner of the victory: that was a signal,"" said Mueller. ""But we have to keep going and keep collecting points after the international break. ""No one is giving us anything, but the mentality of our players is incredible. The hunger is very much there."" The manner of the win was underlined by the passing quality of Bayern's Germany centre-back Jerome Boateng, who supplied pin-point accurate long balls for Mueller's first and Lewandowski's goal. Head coach Pep Guardiola was delighted as his side picked up their eighth straight league win of the season and their record of 28 goals scored, four against means they have had the best ever start to a Bundesliga season. ""I have to congratulate the players, not just for today, but for the last few months,"" said Guardiola. ""We're happy because we won against one of the best sides in Europe. ""We struggled in the first 15 minutes, but our third goal made the difference. ""We scored the first goal despite having very few chances early on, those long balls from Boateng were exceptional."" Despite the emphatic manner of the victory, Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge is demanding no over-confidence: ""We must not be arrogant. Our slogan is: keep calm and carry on."" Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel insisted his side had played into Bayern's hands by failing to defend against Boateng's long balls. ""We made life far too easy for Bayern. The opening goal was the worst to concede,"" he said. ""A long ball from 40 metres -- that shouldn't happen, and it was the same for the third, because you have to close the gap quicker. ""We also gave away a cheap penalty. ""We have to work harder in training now and reset -- that's sorely needed."" After Dormtund dominated the opening 20 minutes, Bayern stepped up a gear when Mueller controlled Boateng's long pass to beat Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki on 26 minutes. Dortmund conceded a penalty when Henrikh Mkhitaryan fouled Thiago in the area and Mueller drilled home the spot-kick on 35 minutes to double the hosts' lead. The visitors fought back on 36 minutes when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang swept home Gonzalo Castro's superb cross, but it was all Bayern from then on. Lewandowski made it 3-1 on 46 minutes when he finished off his half-chance after another superb long ball from Boateng. The floodgates opened when Lewandowski slotted home Goetze's great cross on 58 minutes, then the latter hit the back of the net from 12 yards out on 66 minutes. Tuchel gave a straight answer when asked if any in Germany's top tier can currently rival the Bavarians: ""No, of course not, they are just too good playing like this."""

Mario Goetze grabbed Bayern's fifth to compound his former club's misery. Lewandowski sent Bundelsiga records tumbling by scoring five in just nine minutes in the 5-1 thrashing of Wolfsburg less than a fortnight ago. The 27-year-old has scored in all of Bayern's three games since, including a Champions League hat-trick in the 5-0 rout of Dinamo Zagreb. Lewandowski is the Bundelsiga's top scorer with 12 goals in just seven games, but Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is just behind him with 10 in eight. Dortmund suffered their first defeat in 15 games under new coach Thomas Tuchel and the gap between the chasing pack and Bayern already looks ominous, even at this early stage of the season, with Pep Guardiola's Bavarians hunting an unprecedented fourth straight league title. Dortmund dominated the opening 20 minutes, but Bayern stepped up a gear when Mueller controlled Jerome Boateng's long ball and beat Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki on 26 minutes. Dortmund conceded a penalty when Heinrikh Mkhitaryan fouled Thiago in the area and Muller drilled the penalty on 35 minutes to double the hosts' lead. The visitors fought back on 36 minutes when Aubameyang swept home Gonzalo Castro's superb cross, but it was all Bayern from then on. Lewandowski made it 3-1 on 46 minutes when he finished off his half-chance after another superb long ball from Boateng. The floodgates opened when Lewandowski slotted home Goetze's great cross on 58 minutes, then Goetze then hit the back of the net from 12 metres out on 66 minutes. Bayern have now beaten both last season's runners-up Wolfsburg and Dortmund, their nearest rivals in the league table, by the same heavy scoreline in recent weeks and Guardiola's side again looked peerless in Germany. Earlier, third-placed Schalke crashed to their first defeat in seven games with a 3-0 loss at home to Cologne, who took their chance to climb to fifth. Cologne's French striker Anthony Modeste claimed his sixth goal in eight matches before the visitors ran riot in the final ten minutes. Cologne doubled their lead at Gelsenkirchen's Veltins Arena when defensive midfielder Yannick Gerhardt netted on 79 minutes, before Simon Voller drilled home a shot, just a minute after coming on, on 84 minutes. On Saturday, Borussia Moenchengladbach continued their rise up the table as they bounced back from their midweek Champions League defeat against Manchester City with a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg. Norway midfielder Haavard Nordtvelt and French-born Guinean winger Ibrahima Traore did the damage to leave Gladbach now 13th while Wolfsburg dropped to ninth. It was Gladbach's third straight league win under caretaker coach Andre Schubert following Lucien Favre's sudden resignation. Hertha Berlin's impressive season continued as they climbed to fourth with a 3-0 home win over Hamburg as Salomon Kalou gave the hosts a first-half lead, then Vedad Ibisevic netted twice in as many minutes. Hoffenheim and VfB Stuttgart remain in the bottom four after their 2-2 draw. Germany international winger Kevin Volland scored both goals for hosts Hoffenheim while bottom side Stuttgart rescued a point as Pirmin Schwegler scored a 90th-minute equaliser. Hanover won their first match of the season as they defeated Werder Bremen 1-0 thanks to the only goal on 56 minutes through French-born Senegalese international Salif Sane. Bavaria's Ingolstadt, who are in their debut Bundesliga season, defeated Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0 with late goals from Pascal Gross and Stefan Lex to take sixth spot. On Friday, Mainz evened their record at four wins and four defeats in a thrilling 3-2 victory at promoted Darmstadt. Mainz are in touch of the top six while Darmstadt suffered only their second defeat of the eight-game season and lie 10th."

Aubameyang has scored in each of Dortmund's seven games this season, a Bundesliga record, while Lewandowski has netted a mind-blowing ten goals in his last three games. The Poland hot-shot sent league records tumbling by grabbing five goals in just nine second-half minutes last week when he came off the bench to almost singe-handedly thrash Wolfsburg in a 5-1 defeat. He then passed the mark for 100 Bundesliga goals with two more in Bayern's 3-0 win at Mainz last Saturday and claimed a hat-trick in Tuesday's 5-0 win against Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League. ""He's on an amazing run and he's had an unbelievable week,"" said Bayern's captain Philipp Lahm, who half-joked that he expects a hat-trick from Lewandowski in every match. ""A striker like Lewandowski doesn't need any encouragement."" The Poland striker has already claimed 17 goals for both club and country this season and threatens to score more in Sunday's Bayern-Dortmund clash, which the German media dub 'Der Klassiker'. The goal-ace has earned the nickname 'Lewangoalski' in Germany and his attitude lends to the moniker 'Mr. Nimmersatt' -- 'Mr Never Satisfied'. ""You must always want to score more goals, always play better. You can never just think that you have achieved enough,"" he said after Bayern needed just 28 minutes to take a 4-0 lead at home to Zagreb -- a new Champions League record. Not to be outdone, Aubameya took his tally to nine goals from seven league games -- while Lewandowski has ten from his six games -- in the 2-2 draw against Darmstadt last Sunday and is eyeing more against Bayern. When asked whether he can overtake Lewandowski in the Bundesliga scoring chart this season, Aubameyang chuckled: ""That will be difficult, my friend"". Apart from Bayern's Thomas Mueller, who has scored a perfectly respectable six goals in seven matches, Gabon's Aubameyang seems the only one capable of denying Lewandowski this season's Golden Cannon. The 26-year-old struck a brace - his second of the campaign - against Darmstadt to continue his own remarkable run of form. ""Scoring goals does me good,"" said Aubameyang, who was rested for Dortmund's Europa League game at PAOK Saloniki on Thursday. ""As a striker, it's my job to score and I'm very happy about that."" Of all the big name forwards to have played in the Bundesliga, including Lewandowski, no other player has scored in each of the seven games at the start of a German league season. The next club record on Aubameyang's horizon is held by Lewandowski himself. The Polish forward scored in 12 successive league matches for Dortmund in the 2012/13 season. Aubameyang is currently on nine, stretching back to last season, and at the current rate, the 26-year-old will surpass the 20-goal target he set himself for this season. He famously donned a Batman mask after scoring against rivals Schalke, last February, while Marco Reus wore a Robin mask after Dortmund's dynamic duo both scored in the 3-0 home win. And Dortmund will need all their heroes to be on form at the Allianz Arena."

He's in the final phase of his recovery process, but I don't know if he will be able to play on Sunday,"" Guardiola said at Friday's press conference. Robben, 31, is working his way back from a groin injury sustained in the Netherlands' 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifying loss to Iceland on September 3. Guardiola said midfielder Arturo Vidal will be available though with the Chilean having fully recovered from a knee problem that kept him out of Tuesday's 5-0 demolition of Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League group stage. The Spaniard added that full-back Juan Bernat had also overcome a knock that forced him off at half-time in midweek. Bayern go into Sunday's showdown against Dortmund at the Allianz Arena with a four-point advantage over Thomas Tuchel's side after recording seven straight wins to start the season."

He backed up his spectacular five goals in just nine minutes for Bayern against Wolfsburg last week with two more in a 3-0 win at Mainz last Saturday in the Bundesliga. He then bagged a hat-trick in the 5-0 win at home to Dinamo Zagreb on Tuesday in the Champions League. Bayern top the Bundesliga table with seven wins from seven to lead second-placed Dortmund by four points after Thomas Tuchel's team drew their last two league matches against Hoffenheim and Darmstadt.

The Bavarians won both league meetings last season, but Dortmund took both the German Cup semi-final in Munich last April on penalties and the 2014 German Super Cup title against Bayern. Dortmund still have their work cut out in their bid to halt Munich's seemingly relentless march to an historic fourth straight Bundesliga title, which no team has done before.

Dortmund won the Bundesliga title in 2011 and 2012, but ever since Bayern have dominated the German league, winning at a canter for the last three seasons running. Under new coach Thomas Tuchel, Dortmund are unbeaten with five league wins, but have drawn their last two games and Watzke rejects the notion that they are ""hunting"" Bayern. ""We never saw ourselves as, don't see ourselves as, and aren't Bayern hunters,"" Watzke told German daily Bild as Dortmund finished seventh last season. ""We see ourselves as challengers of teams who finished ahead of us last season in the league. ""We want to get back into the Champions League. ""Those are the goals we have set and nothing has changed."" Sunday's mouth-watering match is billed here as Germany's ""Klassiker"", but Watzke insists Dortmund can not match Bayern's bumper, star-studded squad over the 34 matches of a Bundesliga season. ""Of course, we have a chance to beat Bayern in selective matches, there's no question about that, but over the course of 34 games currently no one in Germany -- and probably no one in Europe -- could deny this unbelievable quality,"" said Watzke. With less than a quarter of the season gone, Bayern, on 21 points, are pulling away from their main rivals Dortmund (17) and Schalke (16) with Wolfsburg and Bayer Leverkusen already well behind on 12. The term ""Bayern hunters"" has become a label the German media is keen to tag on any team who get the closest to Bayern in the table -- and it is clearly something Dortmund are unwilling to accept. Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking and sports director Klaus Allofs had to repeatedly brush off the tag throughout last season when their side finished second to Bayern in the league and won the German Cup."

Bayern have won all seven of their league games so far this season, while unbeaten Dortmund have dropped points by drawing their last two matches.

""We need to keep an eye on the load put on the players,"" said Tuchel as Dortmund will have played 14 games in 65 days by the time they play Bayern. The likes of new signings Gonzalo Castro, South Korea's Park Joo-Ho and Belgian rising star Adnan Januzaj are set to make the starting line-up as Dortmund hunt their second straight win in their Europa League group."

He was refering to Dortmund stars Ilkay Gundogan, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Mats Hummels, who are all out of contract at the end of the 2016/17 season and the club is set to offer extension deals this season. Dortmund are in rude health with a turnover of 276 million euros ($309m) for the 2014/15 season, when they briefly flirted with the relegation places, and banked 54 million in profit. Dortmund led the Bundesliga up until the start of last week, but dropped four points with draws at Hoffenheim last Wednesday and at home to Darmstadt on Sunday which left them second to Bayern Munich, who they play away on Sunday. The team could only manage a seventh place finish last season under Jurgen Klopp, and having only qualified for the Europa League via the play-offs, Dortmund need to finish in the top three to be guaranteed a Champions League spot next season. Watzke insists they will not sell players to balance the books, but a repeat failure to reach the Champions League will have direct consequences. ""In this case, re-establishing a team budget of 87 million euros would make little sense,"" insisted Watzke."

""It felt more like a defeat,"" admitted Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel. Dortmund captain Mats Hummels could barely disguise his frustration at more points dropped before the Allianz Arena clash this coming Sunday. ""You can't put it into words. The positioning for the last free-kick against us was extremely annoying,"" Hummels fumed after Darmstadt captain Aytac Sulu equalised in the 90th minute. ""He shot from 13, 14 metres out and wasn't marked. That's no way to defend. It was pure luck from Darmstadt, they were dead. ""The annoying thing is that we once again failed to open up a seven-point gap on fourth. ""We've had two great chances in a row to do that, and we've messed up twice. ""That's what annoys us the most, because it's about finishing in the top three -- ideally as comfortably and as quickly as possible."" Dortmund now face Greece's PAOK away in the Europa League on Thursday before heading to Munich. ""Without doubt they're two tough matches, but we've played some terrific matches in Munich in recent years,"" said Hummels. ""Sometimes we've won, other times we've lost. ""I don't think there's an obvious trend. It'll definitely be a good game, but first we want to take the next step towards the next round of the Europa League, then we'll be focusing on the Bundesliga again on Friday."" Bayern host Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League on Tuesday and will have two extra days to recover. The Bayern-Dortmund match will see the league's top two scorers go head-to-head.

Lewandowski is relishing the clash against his old club, who he left in 2014. ""It will be a very important game for us,"" Lewandowski told German daily Bild. ""We'll have to put our foot to the floor from the first to the last minute, because Dortmund are playing really, really well.""

Bayern are the only team in Germany's top flight to have won all seven league games so far. Pep Guardiola's leaders are looking to become the first team to win four consecutive Bundesliga titles. After Marcel Heller gave Darmstadt a shock lead, Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang looked to have sealed the hosts' comeback win with two second-half goals to maintain his record run having scored in each of Dortmund's first seven Bundesliga games. With nine goals, Aubameyang is just one behind Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski. But Darmstadt captain Aytac Sulu rescued a point by stabbing home from a free-kick just before the final whistle as the Dortmund defence failed to react in time. ""Our problems came from the final free-kick, there were four or five players just standing around and that was no way to defend against a simple set-piece like that,"" fumed Dortmund captain Mats Hummels. Earlier, midfielder Vladimir Darida rescued a point for Hertha Berlin with the late equaliser in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt after captain Alexander Meier gave the hosts the lead midway through the first half. The point leaves Hertha sixth and Frankfurt 10th in the table. On Saturday, Bayern took the chance to extend their lead with a 3-0 win at Mainz as Lewandowski's goal haul continued. Having sent German league records tumbling last Tuesday with five goals in just nine minutes after coming off the bench in the 5-1 rout of Wolfsburg, the 27-year-old claimed two more against Mainz. Lewandowski scored his 100th Bundesliga goal by heading Kingsley Coman's cross inside the far post on 51 minutes and pulled up his jersey to reveal a T-Shirt which stated: ""100"". ""The T-Shirt was my idea, I didn't know if I'd score today, but you always have to think positively, which is why I had it made,"" he told reporters. An Arturo Vidal pass then put Lewandowski in behind the defence to round the goalkeeper for his 101st on 63 minutes. France Under-21 winger Coman grabbed Bayern's third five minutes later with a simple tap in from a Douglas Costa cross. Bayern's next date is hosting Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League on Tuesday.

The goals came from Granit Xhaka, a Christian Gentner own-goal and Raffel's late effort afer Daniel Ginczek slotted a 40th-minute penalty for Stuttgart. Hoffenheim climbed to 15th with a 3-1 win at Augsburg as Germany international Kevin Volland scored twice, including a second-half penalty."

Hertha should have equalised before the break as striker Vedad Ibisevic headed onto the post, then fired over the bar. But they finally drew level on 82 minutes when substitute Alexander Baumjohann chested the ball through to Darida and the ex-Freiburg attacking midfielder slammed his shot past Frankfurt goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky. The point leaves Hertha sixth and Frankfurt 10th in the table. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund hosting Darmstadt on Sunday evening, defending champions Bayern Munich took the chance to go five points clear on Saturday with a 3-0 win at Mainz as Robert Lewandowski's goal haul continued. The Poland hot-shot took his tally to 101 Bundesliga goals and has now scored 10 goals in just six league games this season.

The 26-year-old was handed the hefty fine last December when it emerged he had been driving without a valid licence since 2011 after being stopped for speeding in March 2014 and handed over a fake Dutch driving licence to German police. Reus was then immediately subjected to a second investigation after eye-witnesses claimed to have seen him continuing to drive, but those questioned were unable to give exact details of where and when, prosecutors said in a statement.

Dortmund had their 11-match winning run ended as they failed to match the Bavarians' six straight wins, giving Pep Guardiola's side a psychological advantage for the Dortmund-Bayern clash in Munich on Sunday week. Second-placed Dortmund found themselves 1-0 down at Hoffenheim when Germany international Sebastian Rudy netted just before the break. But Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel brought on defensive midfielder Ilkay Gundogan and Henrikh Mkhitaryan and the equaliser followed soon after. Midfielder Gonzalo Castro chested down Mats Hummels pass and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang stabbed home his seventh goal in six league games on 55 minutes. It was the perfect time to score just moments after Hoffenheim's Chile international Eduardo Vargas had hit the post after beating Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Buerki, but Borussia could not force a winner. Ex-Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez scored his first goal in the Bundesliga with the winner for his new club Bayer Leverkusen to seal their 1-0 win over Mainz. It ended his side's three-match losing streak in the German league. Having already scored for Leverkusen in the Champions League, 'Chicharito' produced a superb solo effort with a darting run before showing clinical finishing on 69 minutes. The Mexican made way for Stefan Kiessling soon afterwards, but ex-Dortmund midfielder Kevin Kampl hit the post as Leverkusen came within a whisker of a second in the final ten minutes. Schalke are third after Cameroon centre-back Joel Matip headed home from a corner, then Leroy Sane scored late on, his second in as games, to seal their 2-0 home victory against Eintracht Frankfurt, fortheir third consecutive win. Borussia Moenchengladbach climbed off the bottom of the league with their first win after five straight defeats with a 4-2 victory over Augsburg under caretaker coach Andre Schubert, following Lucien Favre's shock resignation. 'Gladbach, who host Manchester City next Wednesday in the Champions League, raced into 4-0 lead after just 21 minutes with goals by Fabian Johnson, Lars Stindl, Granit Xhaka and teenager Mahmoud Dahoud, who scored his first goal for the club on only his seventh appearance. Augsburg hit back when Paul Verhaegh converted two second-half penalties, but 'Gladbach held on and are now 16th. Hanover went bottom after their 2-1 defeat at home to Stuttgart, which leaves coach Michael Frontzeck under pressure with just one point from their opening six games, while Stuttgart are second from bottom."

The two teams clash at Bayern's Allianz Arena on October 4 in a mouth-watering showdown with Munich bidding to become the first team to win an unprecedented fourth straight league title this season. Under new coach Thomas Tuchel, Dortmund have scored an average of more than three goals per game thus far and want a sixth straight league win -- their 12th overall this season -- at Hoffenheim to keep the pressure on Bayern. ""We need to just focus on ourselves, we mustn't let up and not let anything from outside influence us,"" said Tuchel, who replaced Jurgen Klopp. ""We noticed early on which players already have a lot of self-confidence and which need to develope it. ""There is real competition for places in the team. People want to take their chance to be on the stage and take responsibility."" Dortmund's 3-0 home win against Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday was another positive step in proving their pedigree as genuine rivals to Bayern, who have won the Bundesliga at a canter for the last three years. Last season, Dortmund flirted with relegation before finishing seventh and struggled to replace Robert Lewandowski after their main source of goals left for Bayern. This season, Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has bagged six goals in five games with right-wing Henrikh Mkhitaryan scoring three. A total of eight players have netted league goals so far, meaning Borussia have also got more unpredictable. Aubameyang's tally matches that of Bayern's Thomas Mueller and the pair are the league's current top scorers. Hoffenheim are winless this season after four defeats and one draw which has left them just above the relegation places having been humbled 3-1 at Mainz on Friday."

Early form suggests there will be a title-race in Germany this season after Bayern won the Bundesliga for each of the last three years at a canter. Dortmund took the lead when right winger Jonas Hofmann profited from a mistake by Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno to slot into an empty net on 19 minutes. Leverkusen should have been awarded a penalty when Mexico striker Javier Hernandez was pushed in the area by Dortmund left-back Marcel Schmelzer on 53 minutes but referee Deniz Aytekin waved on play. The hosts doubled their lead when left-winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan's pass put Shinji Kagawa in behind the defence to slot past Leno on 58 minutes. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted Dortmund's third and his six of the season to match Bayern's Thomas Mueller's tally as the league's joint top scorer. Augsburg picked up their first win of the season with a 2-0 victory at Hanover 96 thanks to goals by right-winger Alexander Esswein and Dutch defender Paul Verhaegh. Earlier, Schalke's Leroy Sane underlined his status as one of Germany's rising junior stars with his club's second-half winner to seal their 1-0 victory at VfB Stuttgart to leave the Royal Blues fourth. On Saturday, Bayern, who are bidding to become the first team to win the German league four times in succession, went top of the table for 24 hours with a 3-0 win at Darmstadt for their fifth straight league win. Arturo Vidal, Kingsley Coman and Sebastian Rode claimed their first goals of the season with Munich's star forward Robert Lewandowski injured and Thomas Mueller on the bench. Gladbach's disastrous start to the season continued as they lost 1-0 at neighbours Cologne, thanks to Anthony Modeste's second-half winner, in the Rhineland derby to stay bottom of the table with five defeats from five. The victory left Cologne fifth while Gladbach, who lost their opening Champions League group stage match 3-0 at Seville on Tuesday, remain rooted to the foot of the table and Lucien Favre resigned on Sunday night. Wolfsburg, who face Bayern away on Tuesday, celebrated their 70th birthday with a 2-0 home win over Hertha Berlin as Dutch striker Bas Dost netted twice to lift his side up to third. After coming off the bench on 71 minutes, Dost netted the opener five minutes later, then drilled home a penalty on 89 minutes after a foul on Germany international Julian Draxler. But Dost was later slammed by his coach Dieter Hecking for behaving 'like someone had taken his toys away' in training having been subbed off in Wolfsburg's Champions League win at home to CSKA Moscow last Tuesday. Ingolstadt made history as the first Bundesliga team to win all three of their home games in their debut season in Germany's top flight after Moritz Hartmann drilled home a 93rd-minute penalty which put the Bavarians fifth with a 1-0 win at Werder Bremen. Bremen were reduced to ten men five minutes into injury time when midfielder Philipp Bargfrede was sent off for fouling Ingolstsadt's USA international Alfredo Morales. Hamburg were held to a goalless draw at home to Eintracht Frankfurt while Mainz are seventh after Friday's 3-0 win at home to Hoffenheim when midfielder Yunus Malli claimed a hat-trick."
636,19/09/2015,13:19,Tuchel mulls Park dilemma on Dortmund's record run,Borussia Dortmund host Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga on Sunday on a 10-match winning streak but with the form of South Korea's Park Joo-ho giving coach Thomas Tuchel a selection headache.,"Dortmund's run includes winning all four Bundesliga matches so far this season with Tuchel's new team enjoying the best start to a campaign in the club's history. They start the weekend on top of the Bundesliga on goal difference from champions Bayern Munich and fresh from beating Russian side FC Krasnodar 2-1 in their opening Europa League group game on Thursday. Dortmund came from behind to win that game thanks to a dramatic headed winner in the 93rd minute by Park, who was outstanding on his debut for the club. ""He scored a super important goal for us and was already suffering from cramp when he made his way into the area for the winning goal -- that testifies to a good fighting heart,"" enthused Tuchel. Park followed Tuchel's path in joining from Mainz last month, but despite his match-winning form, the South Korean is not guaranteed to start against Leverkusen as he waits to make his Bundesliga debut for Dortmund. The return of Germany winger Marco Reus after a toe injury threatens to relegate Park to the bench, while Marcel Schmelzer, whose place Park could take at left-back, is in great form, but even he is in awe of the South Korean. ""It's getting scary. Everything he tries comes off, perhaps he should start playing the lottery..."" quipped Schmelzer. All joking aside, Leverkusen present a significant test of Dortmund's mettle despite starting the weekend 13th in the table. Borussia's Westfalenstadion is an 80,359-capacity sell-out and a victory would back up talk of Dortmund giving Bayern a genuine challenge for the title. ""We are favourites and a win over Leverkusen would be important as it would leave them nine points behind us,"" said midfielder Gonzalo Castro, who joined Dortmund from Leverkusen in the summer. Leverkusen, who responded after back-to-back league defeats to Bayern and Darmstadt with a 4-1 win over BATE of Belarus in the Champions League on Wednesday, are waiting on the fitness of captain Lars Bender after he suffered a badly bruised knee in that victory."
637,18/09/2015,02:30,"True test for Dortmund, Bayern venture to Darmstadt","Borussia Dortmund face the first real test of their mettle as Bundesliga leaders on Sunday when they host Bayer Leverkusen, while Bayern Munich face a tricky tie at Darmstadt.","After the disappointment of last season's seventh-place finish Dortmund are back at the top of the table, ahead of rivals Bayern on goal difference, following four straight wins under new coach Thomas Tuchel. Dortmund left it late to beat FC Krasnodar in their opening game of the Europa League group stage on Thursday and full-back Marcel Schmelzer is eager for their winning run to continue this weekend. ""We have unfinished business, not just against Leverkusen but in general (after last season),"" Schmelzer, whose side were beaten 2-0 at home by Leverkusen last term, told the Bundesliga's official website. ""We're on the right track at the moment, though: we're focussed, working hard and desperately want to succeed. ""We know it's difficult to maintain the high level we're playing at, however, and so we want to make sure we keep a comfortable cushion over our rivals and remain in the Champions League places for as long as possible."" Pep Guardiola's star-studded Bayern squad will receive a warm welcome at Darmstadt's antiquated Merck Stadion on Saturday with the hosts looking for another upset win having stunned Bayer Leverkusen 1-0 last week at the BayArena. Fresh from Wednesday's impressive 3-0 Champions League win at Olympiakos, Bayern turn their attention to beating Darmstadt to claim top spot in the table before Dortmund play 24 hours later. Darmstadt are back in the Bundesliga after a 33-year absence and have never beaten Bayern in four previous meetings, the last of which was back in 1982. Germany's World Cup winner Mario Goetze is set for another afternoon on Bayern's bench having been left out of the starting line-up in Greece, only to score as a substitute. Bayern have the express intention of becoming the first team to win four-straight Bundesliga titles and despite winning all four games so far, they find themselves trailing Dortmund. ""It's great for the Bundesliga, but it's a bit unsettling to have such an aggressive pursuer. In fact, at the moment we're the ones doing the chasing,"" said Bayern striker Thomas Mueller, the league's top scorer with six goals in four games. Guardiola has got off to the best start in any of his three years in Germany, but knows there is no guarantee of success in what is set to be a particularly competitive season. ""No team has ever won the Bundesliga four times in a row,"" he explained after Bayern's comeback win over Augsburg last Saturday. ""That's because achieving that is really difficult. Bayer Leverkusen lost at home to Darmstadt and VfL Wolfsburg could only get a draw in Ingolstadt."" The Darmstadt fixture sees the start of Bayern's run of five matches in 13 days. The tally includes three key home matches against last season's league runners-up VfL Wolfsburg, a Champions League clash with Dinamo Zagreb, then Dortmund on October 4, which is warming up to be a battle royal. ""I can't imagine it's been much fun for Dortmund to have been behind us in the last three seasons so of course, they're going to want to attack again,"" said Mueller. Bottom side Borussia Moenchengladbach are at Cologne on Saturday looking for their first win of the season after a disastrous four straight league defeats having been beaten 3-0 at Sevilla on Tuesday in their opening Champions League match.

Dortmund, meanwhile, find themselves in this season's Europa League after finishing seventh in the Bundesliga in Jurgen Klopp's final campaign in charge and losing to Wolfsburg in the German Cup final. Under new coach Thomas Tuchel, Dortmund have won their opening four Bundesliga games and top the table from Bayern on goal difference. Dortmund host Russia's FC Krasnodar on Thursday in their opening Europa League Group C match, but Rummenigge says Borussia's absence will be felt in the Champions League, especially after Bayern and Dortmund contested the 2013 final. ""They actually belong there. Dortmund has always been a good guarantor for German football,"" said Rummenigge before Bayern jetted off to Athens. ""They have always progressed and collected valuable points. ""Dortmund has done well up until now -- and will continue to do so."" Rummenigge said he hopes the four German clubs in this season's Champions League -- Bayern, Borussia Moenchengladbach, Wolfsburg and Bayer Leverkusen -- will ""carry the German flag quite so well. We need the points"". With third-placed England hard on Germany's tail in UEFA's club co-efficient rankings behind leaders Spain, Rummenigge says German clubs need to do well in Europe to keep ahead of their Premier League rivals. Rummenigge also says he expects French winger Franck Ribery to play again in 2015, despite the France international having been blighted by a right ankle injury which has kept him sidelined since March. ""I think it will be the case that he will definitely be darting around again in 2015,"" added Rummenigge, although Bayern have given no date for Ribery's return. ""He will make a comeback, that is crucial."""
639,14/09/2015,14:02,Fans title chants fire up Dortmund: Aubameyang,"Borussia Dortmund fans have voiced their hopes of winning this season's German league title, which Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang says is music to the Bundesliga leaders' ears.","""Only Borussia Dortmund will be German champions!"" sang their fans after Saturday's 4-2 win at Hanover 96 when Aubameyang converted two penalties to leave him with five league goals in four Bundesliga matches. Aubameyang has scored nine goals in all competitions this season to help Borussia top the German league table ahead of arch-rivals Bayern Munich. ""It's a good motivation for us, when the fans sing that,"" Aubameyang told German daily Bild. ""They may have a few dreams on the quiet..."" Under new head coach Thomas Tuchel, Dortmund have enjoyed the best start to a season in the club's history with nine straight wins. Having won the 2011 and 2012 German league titles, Dortmund played second fiddle to Bayern Munich in 2013 and 2014 before a disastrous start to last season ultimately saw them finish seventh. Dortmund face a big test of their mettle as title contenders on Saturday when they host Bayer Leverkusen, but Borussia's director of sport Michel Zorc says Dortmund are ""challenging for top spot"" in Germany. ""Bayern are still top favourites, we will see our thing through,"" Zorc told German broadcaster Sport1. And Dortmund's form has even provoked a response from Bayern, who are second in the table on goal difference and both teams have won all four of their league matches thus far. ""They want to attack us again, which is nice for the league and makes things a bit more unrelaxed for us,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller, the Bundesliga's top scorer with six goals in four matches. ""They are very greedy and you can see they are on the up, so we have to brace ourselves accordingly."" After Saturday's Leverkusen match, Dortmund's next big test will be when they play Bayern away on October 4 as the Bavarian giants beat Borussia both home and away in the league last season."
640,11/09/2015,02:20,Dortmund aim to continue Tuchel revival,Thomas Tuchel's arrival at Borussia Dortmund following the departure of Juergen Klopp has revitalised the Westphalian club after a very underwhelming 2014-15 campaign.,"Dortmund are the league's early pacesetters, above Bayern Munich on goal difference, after thumping wins over Borussia Moenchengladbach, newcomers Ingolstadt and Hertha Berlin with a trip to lowly Hanover awaiting them on Saturday. However, Marco Reus, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Lukasz Piszczek all returned prematurely from international duty due to injury with their status for the weekend up in the air. Bayern outclassed Bayer Leverkusen, one of Germany's four Champions League representative, last time out to maintain their perfect start this term and have a Bavarian derby against Augsburg to contend with on Saturday. Pep Guardiola will be without Arjen Robben for a month though after the Dutchman picked up a groin strain during his country's shock 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifying defeat at home to Iceland. Augsburg have beaten Bayern twice in their last three meetings, albeit when Guardiola's men had already wrapped up the title, but Bayern skipper Philipp Lahm is keen to set the record straight. ""We're the home team, and we want the next three points,"" Lahm said, in quotes published on the Bundesliga's official website. ""We've started the season well and we want to carry on this way."" Borussia Moenchengladbach will look to belatedly breathe life into their Bundesliga campaign on Friday when they take on Hamburg ahead of next week's first foray into the Champions League group stage. Three straight defeats to start the season, including a heavy 4-0 reverse at Dortmund in their season opener, have left Lucien Favre's Gladbach rock bottom and desperate for a morale boost going into next Tuesday's Group D clash away to Sevilla. The Foals, who sealed a return to Europe's elite after a near 40-year absence by virtue of last season's third-place finish, are expected to welcome back captain Martin Stranzl with the Austrian defender having missed the last six months through injury. ""We have to make sure we produce good results so that we can get our confidence back again,"" Stranzl, who has seen his team-mates leak eight goals already this term in his absence, told the club's official website. ""We need to do this as quickly as possible, so that any negative thoughts aren't allowed to linger. ""After the game against Hamburg, we've got a lot of mid-week games and there won't be much time to rest. For that reason, a win at this stage would be very important,"" added the veteran centre-half. Hamburg, the Bundesliga's only ever-present club, have narrowly escaped relegation twice the past two seasons after coming through a play-off. Bruno Labbadia's men again find themselves in the bottom half, a 3-2 victory over fellow strugglers Stuttgart representing their lone three points so far. Julian Draxler and Dante are in line to make their Wolfsburg debuts as last season's runners-up visit Ingolstadt, who have just one point fewer than Dieter Hecking's men after two wins in their first three outings. Leverkusen will try to bounce back from their first loss as promoted Darmstadt, who have drawn their opening three games, make the trip to the BayArena.

The players will each walk out hand-in-hand with refugee children from the nearby Hamburg Exhibition centre complex. Several clubs in Germany's top flight have already set up initiatives to help the refugees arriving in the country. Bayern Munich have pledged a million euros (US$1.1m) and offered to set up a coaching camp, offering food and German lessons to children of refugees in the Bavarian capital."
642,03/09/2015,17:50,Bundesliga clubs reach out to Germany's refugees,German Bundesliga club Bayern Munich on Thursday announced it will donate one million euros (US$1.1m) to projects supporting some of the refugees pouring into Germany amidst the ongoing Europe-wide crisis.,"The club is working with Munich authorities to set up 'training camps' for children to receive German lessons, meals and football kits. The city of Munich has been particularly affected by the refugee crisis after local police reported that more than 100 migrants arrived in an hour on Wednesday in the Bavarian capital. For their next home match against Augsburg on September 12, Bayern players will walk out hand-in-hand with both a German and a refugee child as a mark of support for the integration of refugees. ""We at FC Bayern consider it our socio-political responsibility to help displaced and needy children, women and men, by supporting and assisting them in Germany,"" Bayern's chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wrote on the club's website. So far this year, German police have recorded over 125,000 illegal entries, more than double last year's total of about 57,000, with many coming from war-torn Syria as well as from Eritrea, Afghanistan, Kosovo and Serbia. The influx has sparked a wave of attacks on asylum-seekers and violent protests against foreigners. Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Germany will have ""no tolerance"" for ""shameful and vile"" violence against refugees. Germany's World Cup-winning footballers have condemned xenophobic attacks and led calls to help the refugees. The German Football Association (DFB) has produced a video in which a group of star players appear holding up signs condemning violence and calling for ""respect"", ""help"", ""integration"" and ""fairplay"" towards any refugee arriving in Germany. In Germany's football community, Bayern are not alone in offering help to those seeking refuge in Germany, with Europe's biggest economy this year expecting a record 800,000 asylum applications, more than any other EU country. Bayern's Bundesliga rivals Schalke invited 100 refugees to their opening home game of the season and have founded the ""Kumpel-Kiste"" (""mate's box"") initiative where clothes and toys can be sent to refugees. Schalke have released a video showing club legend Gerald Asamoah, the first African-born footballer to play for Germany, talking about the importance of understanding what the refugees are going through. In the video for the programme ""Stand Up"", Asamoah appears with the Schalke team and says the insults players hear from the terraces during a 90-minute match are nothing compared to what many refugees are experiencing on a daily basis in Germany as they wait to receive asylum. ""Ask yourself: Why are we doing this. If everyone shows some civil courage, if we talk about the issue and say, 'This isn't right!' then we can achieve so much. We have to take a stand. That means we must stand up!"" Schalke's bitter rivals Borussia Dortmund, who invited 220 refugees to a Europa League game, responded by saying ""separated by colours, united by this"". Other Bundesliga clubs have also got involved including Werder Bremen founded a ""Stay on the Ball"" project to help refugees in the region, while both Hannover and Hoffenheim have delivered kits and shoes to help."

Galatasaray's appeal against FIFA's decision was turned down on Wednesday and Dortmund have nevertheless agreed to release the midfielder from his contract, which was valid until 2018. Grosskreutz can now only officially sign for Galatasaray when the next transfer window opens on January 1 and until then he can only play in friendly matches and train with the Turkish giants, which both teams have confirmed. Despite his ineligibility, Grosskreutz says he will move to Istanbul next week to get used to his new club after six years and 176 league appearances for Dortmund. A member of the team which lost the 2013 Champions League final to Bayern Munich, Grosskreutz was a passionate Borussia fan before he played for the team in 2009 and has a tattoo of the Dortmund skyline on his right calf. He thanked the Borussia fans for ""six wonderful years"" of support and explained that he had to leave Dortmund due to a lack of game time under new coach Thomas Tuchel. ""Everyone knows that I am a footballer through and through and I need to play in matches, and receive trust, like I need the air to breath,"" he wrote on his Instagram account. ""FIFA has NOT recognised my eligibility, but nevertheless next week I will embark for Istanbul and get used to it. I'll only have the chance to prove myself in training."" Grosskreutz will link up with fellow 2014 World Cup-winner Lukas Podolski at Galatasaray and he is the second member of Dortmund's 2013 Champions League side to leave the club before the transfer window closed.

Dortmund are top on goal difference from Bayern, who romped to a 3-0 home win over Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday. Borussia saw off Hertha at their Westfalenstadion with goals from captain Mats Hummels, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Adrian Ramos. Pitchside temperatures of 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 Fahrenheit), meant the game was frequently interrupted for water breaks as Dortmund continued their red-hot form when Hummels powered home a Shinji Kagawa cross on 27 minutes. Aubamenyang then claimed his seventh goal in eight games after right-back Matthias Ginter combined with Kagawa to set up a simple tap-in on 51 minutes. Ex-Chelsea striker Salomon Kalou pulled a goal back for Hertha on 78 minutes before Colombia striker Adrian Ramos came off the bench to score Borussia's third on 93 minutes, but it looked like the ball had run out of play in the build-up. Later on Sunday, Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach have the chance to climb up from second-from-bottom at Werder Bremen. Wolfsburg are third after beating Schalke 3-0 at home on Friday without attacking midfield star Kevin de Bruyne, who completed his transfer to Manchester City on Sunday. On Saturday, Bayern impressed in their win over Leverkusen as Mueller scored twice, to leave him with five goals in his opening three league matches, before new Netherlands captain Arjen Robben netted a late penalty. Cologne's impressive start continued as they finish the weekend fourth after a 2-1 comeback win at home to Hamburg in controversial fashion. After ex-Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Lewis Holtby put Hamburg ahead early in the second half, Cologne levelled through Philipp Hosiner on 76 minutes, but the game turned on a dubious red card and penalty. Hamburg's ex-Bosnia captain Emir Spahic was sent off on 79 minutes for the slightest of touches on Cologne striker Anthony Modeste, who drilled home the resulting penalty to the fury of the visitors' bench. Japan striker Yoshinori Muto warmed up for his country's World Cup qualifier against Cambodia in Saitama on Thursday with his first two Bundesliga goals in Mainz's 3-0 win over Hanover. Centre-forward Yunus Malli claimed Mainz's third by finishing off a sweeping counter-attack just after the break as Mainz moved up to fifth. Socceroos forward Mathew Leckie also scored his first goal in Germany's top flight in Ingolstadt's 1-0 win at Bavarian rivals Augsburg. The 24-year-old left winger, who has won 25 caps for Australia, curled a superb shot inside the left-hand post, which gave Augsburg goalkeeper Marwin Hitz no chance on 63 minutes. Ten-man Stuttgart are bottom after a 4-1 defeat at home to Eintracht Frankfurt as Poland goalkeeper Przemyslaw Tyton was sent off for the hosts.

""We hope this does not happen. Henrikh is a super important player for us with his brilliant performances in recent weeks,"" Dortmund spokesman Sascha Fligge told German broadcaster Sport1.

""I knew we'd go top of the table after we went 3-0 up, but what especially pleased me was the performance,"" said Tuchel. ""I'm proud that the team kept the performance up for 90 minutes and never waned. ""I'd hoped in the half-time break that they would be rewarded for playing well."" Dogged Ingolstadt defending meant Dortmund only went ahead when right-back Ginter fired home Henrikh Mkhitaryan's final pass on 55 minutes. Germany winger Reus doubled the lead by converting a penalty on the hour after left-back Marcel Schmelzer was fouled. Kagawa added the third with a superb shot off his left foot after beating two defenders on 84 minutes before Aubameyang claimed his sixth goal in six games in stoppage time. Later Borussia Moenchengladbach, who will discover their Champions League group stage opponents on Thursday, dropped to bottom of the table on goal difference after losing 2-1 to Mainz. Leaky defence let them down again having lost 4-0 to Dortmund last Saturday. Gladbach cancelled out Jairo Samperio's first-half goal when Germany winger Patrick Herrmann equalised just after the break only for right-winger Christian Clemens to score Mainz's 79th-minute winner to leave Gladbach without a point. On Saturday, Bayern needed a 90th-minute Robert Lewandowski goal to earn a dramatic 2-1 win at Hoffenheim after conceding the joint fastest goal in German league history and had Jerome Boateng sent off. The Poland striker sealed the champions' comeback after Hoffenheim's Germany Under-21 striker Kevin Volland had opened the scoring with just nine seconds gone at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena. Bayern equalised when Thomas Mueller jabbed home a rebound shot on 40 minutes as Hoffenheim wasted the chance for an historic first win over Bayern at the 15th attempt when Eugen Polanski blasted his penalty attempt off the post after Boateng was sent off for a handball on 72 minutes. Bayern claimed the dramatic winner when Brazil winger Costa fired in a superb cross and Lewandowski drilled home his shot. Bayer Leverkusen are third after a 1-0 win at Hanover saw them join Bayern and Dortmund as the league's only teams with two wins. Dead-ball specialist Hakan Calhanoglu's 18th-minute free-kick sealed the win to give Leverkusen a boost before Wednesday's Champions League play-off qualifier, second-leg, at home to Lazio, who they trail 1-0 after the first leg. Belgian attacking midfielder Kevin de Bruyne started what could be his last match for last season's runners-up VfL Wolfsburg in a 1-1 draw with Cologne. The 24-year-old, despite having said earlier in the week he would be staying with Wolfsburg for this season, is reported to have agreed terms with Manchester City and will earn £200,000 (275,632 euros, $313,890) a week in the Premier League, if his present club accept City's improved offer of £55 million. Hosts Cologne took the lead when striker Simon Zoller lobbed goalkeeper Koen Casteels on the half hour mark, but sixth-placed Wolfsburg equalised when ex-Arsenal and Juventus striker Nicklas Bendtner tapped home a Daniel Caliguri cross at the far post on 83 minutes. Schalke, who routed Bremen 3-0 on the opening weekend of the season, are fourth after their 1-1 draw at newly-promoted Darmstadt. Konstantin Rausch's 18th-minute goal was cancelled out by Schalke's Germany international Julian Draxler, who has been linked to a move to Italian champions Juventus, on 47 minutes. Hamburg moved up to ninth with a 3-2 win at home to ten-man VfB Stuttgart as their ex-Arsenal defender Johan Djourou scored the 89th-minute winner after Stuttgart right-back Florian Klein was sent off for a second booking in as many minutes. Hertha Berlin had briefly led the table on Friday night after their 1-1 draw at home to Werder Bremen when Valentin Stocker's goal was cancelled out by Anthony Ujah's equaliser."
650,22/08/2015,14:27,Dortmund under pressure to avoid another Odds shock,Borussia Dortmund bosses want no repeat of their mid-week first-half debacle at Odds when they chase a sixth-straight win of the season at Bundesliga new-boys Ingolstadt on Sunday.,"Dortmund found themselves 3-0 down after just 22 minutes of Thursday's Europa League qualifier first-leg at Norway's Odds BK before a superb fight-back saw them snatch a late 4-3 win. Under their new coach Thomas Tuchel, Dortmund has won their opening first five games of the season, including a 4-0 hammering of Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach last Saturday in the Bundesliga. Tuchel wants Dortmund to reproduce their fighting spirit from Odds to pick up three league points in Bavaria, but Dortmund's bosses do not want a repeat of the Norwegian experience. Borussia's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has promised ""that won't be an all too common experience"" in future, while director of sport Michael Zorc insisted: ""we can't just write off the first-half (at Odds). That was a shock."" Bavaria's Ingolstadt celebrated their Bundesliga debut with a 1-0 at Mainz last Saturday and Tuchel expects the hosts to relish their underdog roll. ""They deserved to be promoted and the fact they got a win at Mainz and have kept the same team which came up last season shows they have confidence in their team,"" said Tuchel. ""We expect an intense game and Ingolstadt will try with all their might to take advantage of their role as outsiders."" Tuchel has troubles at wing-back with both left-back options Lukasz Piszczek and Erik Durm struggling with injuries, while new-signing Gonzalo Castro struggled at right-back at Odds before being replaced at half-time. ""Gonzalo Castro had his troubles on Thursday, but he suffered a bit for the result after he was replaced. He's still an option for the position on Sunday,"" added Tuchel."
651,21/08/2015,14:27,Dortmund post healthy returns despite poor season,Borussia Dortmund posted a net profit of 5.5 million (US$6.2m) euros for the 2014/15 season on Friday despite a low key campaign.,"Champions League finalists in 2013 they were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by Juventus last season. On the home front, they were bottom of the German league table in February, eventually finishing seventh and outside the places for European football's top domestic competition. Despite that Dortmund have still seen a 13 percent increase in sales to 276 million euros (up from 260.7 the previous year) with an operating profit of 55.6 million with a net income of 5.5, down from the previous year's figure of 12 million euros. The figures were announced at a press conference on Friday after their stunning 4-3 comeback on Thursday at Norway's Odds BK in their Europa League first-leg play-off. ""Against the backdrop of being knocked out of the Champions League early, finishing seventh in the German league and from the associated loss in TV revenue and performance-based premiums of our sponsors, we are extremely satisfied with this result,"" said Dortmund's financial director Thomas Tress. Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said the club's goal is to ""invest everything we make into our football in the future"", but repeated his pledge to never go back into debt having helped save the club from the brink of bankruptcy in 2005. Borussia have won all five of their competitive matches so far this season under head coach Thomas Tuchel."
652,21/08/2015,11:45,"Epic comeback pleases, worries Dortmund's Hummels","Mats Hummels admitted Borussia Dortmund's stunning 4-3 fightback win at Norway's Odds BK in the Europa League had started ""like a bad film"" after they leaked three early goals.","Dortmund left themselves with a mountain to climb at Odds' Skagerrak-Arena as the Norwegians raced into a 3-0 lead after just 22 minutes of Thursday's Europa League qualification play-off. In Skien, two hours south of Oslo, the hosts looked on course to claim a famous win after goals from Jone Samuelsen, Fredrik Nordkvelle and a direct free-kick from Espen Ruud by the midway point in the first half. But Dortmund roared back with a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang brace either side of a Shinji Kagawa strike to make it 3-3 with 15 minutes remaining before Heinrikh Mkhitaryan headed home the 84th minute winner for his seventh goal in four games. ""The end result outweighed the irritation that we didn't score a fifth or sixth goal,"" said Dortmund's captain Hummels as his side conceded their first goal after just 14 seconds, but hit the crossbar twice in the opening 30 minutes. ""It was a catastrophe of a start -- like something out of a bad film. ""We were lucky in the second-half that we could get it back to 3-3. ""It was good for morale that we fought back, but you should never go into a match with sleepiness like that."" The result means Dortmund have now won all five of their competitive matches under new coach Thomas Tuchel. His predecessor Jurgen Klopp once described the team as ""monsters of mentality"" after they fought back from a goal down away to Mainz in 2011 in the Bundesliga and the current Borussia side showed a similar fighting spirit. Their director of sport Michael Zorc described the opening half an hour in Norway as ""a bad nightmare"" and Tuchel admitted he was shocked by how badly his defence fell apart early on. ""It was the last thing we wanted. We were unprepared for the start,"" said the 41-year-old Tuchel. ""I was shocked by how easy it was for them. The Norwegians scored three goals from three chances, then it was a long way back for us. ""In the end, we showed some good morale and could have scored more."" Dortmund are now in a good position for the home leg against Odds next Thursday with the winners going through to the Europa League group stages. Having thrashed Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach 4-0 on the opening weekend of the new Bundesliga season, Dortmund are at newly-promoted Ingolstadt on Sunday."
653,15/08/2015,20:23,Dortmund run-riot to open Tuchel era,Borussia Dortmund threw down the gauntlet to defending champions Bayern Munich on Saturday with a 4-0 drubbing of Borussia Moenchengladbach on the opening weekend of the new Bundesliga season.,"After Jurgen Klopp resigned last season, Dortmund's new coach Thomas Tuchel began his tenure in emphatic style with left winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan scoring twice as Marco Reus and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang also netted. Bayern began their quest for an historic fourth successive title when they routed Hamburg 5-0 at home on Friday, but 2012 German champions Dortmund suggested Pep Guardiola's Bavarians may not have it all their own way this season by hammering Gladbach, who finished third last season. Dortmund took the lead after just 15 minutes when Germany winger Reus hammered home Shinji Kawaga's pass, while Aubameyang added their second when he headed home Marcel Schmelzer's pin-point cross six minutes later. To the delight of the home supporters in the 81,359-strong crowd, Dortmund made it 3-0 at half-time when Mkhitaryan slotted home on 33 minutes after Aubameyang had torn the Gladbach defence to pieces. The Armenia international added Dortmund's fourth and his second on 50 minutes when he drilled home Reus' final pass with Aubameyang also waiting to score. It could have been five as Kagawa, who was outstanding in the attacking midfield, hammered his shot just wide of the post soon after. Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen warmed up for their Champions League play-off clash at Lazio on Tuesday with a 2-1 comeback win against Hoffenheim. Leverkusen face Lazio away on Tuesday, with the return on August 26, for a place in the Champions League group stage and 19-year-old Julian Brandt came off the bench to score their winner at home to Hoffenheim. Newly-promoted Ingolstadt celebrated their debut in Germany's top flight with a 1-0 win at Mainz as Austria international Lukas Hinterseer scored their second-half winner. Fellow new boys Darmstadt finished their first game in the Bundesliga for 33 years with a 2-2 draw against Hanover in an action-packed match. Schalke picked up their first win under new coach Andre Breitenreiter with a 3-0 victory at Werder Bremen. The hosts conceded an unlucky first-half own goal when Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie beat Schalke striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar to the ball, but his clearance looped over Werder goalkeeper Felix Wiedwald and into his own net. Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting converted a pass from his international team-mate Joel Matip on 68 minutes before Huntelaar finished off a superb counter-attack on 85 minutes by 19-year-old substitute Leroy Sane, who had just come on. Meanwhile, Paraguay striker Raul Bobadilla penned a contract extension at Augsburg until 2018 only to be sent off just 45 minutes into the new Bundesliga season on Saturday in his team's 1-0 defeat at home to Hertha Berlin. Last season's runners-up Wolfsburg are at home to Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday, while Stuttgart are at home to Cologne."
654,14/08/2015,17:32,Dortmund coach Tuchel drops Weidenfeller,Thomas Tuchel has made his mark as Borussia Dortmund's new coach by dropping Germany goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller for Swiss stopper Roman Burki for their opening Bundesliga clash against Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday.,"After Jurgen Klopp's resignation last season following seven successful years as Dortmund coach -- which yielded two Bundesliga titles, the 2012 German Cup and two domestic Super Cups -- ex-Mainz boss Tuchel takes charge of his first league match on Saturday. Dropping Weidenfeller, a non-playing member of Germany's 2014 World Cup squad, is a big statement with the 34-year-old a firm fans' favourite and ten years older than Burki, who was snapped up from relegated Freiburg. ""Roman Burki will play in goal against Moenchengladbach,"" confirmed 41-year-old Tuchel. But Tuchel suggested that Weidenfeller would be offered game time in cup competitions. ""The decision has only been taken for the Bundesliga. ""And given how Roman Weidenfeller has presented himself in attitude and performance during the pre-season, I would like him to also play in competitive matches,"" insisted Tuchel. Weidenfeller will be used when Dortmund play against Norwegian side Odds BK in a two-legged play-off for a Europa League place later this month. Having finished seventh in the league last season and subsequently missing out on a Champions League place, Dortmund are eager to rediscover their form from two years ago when they reached the Champions League final and finished as runners-up to Bayern in the league. They open their 2015/16 campaign in front of a sold-out Signal Iduna Park, with the match a poignant one for Dortmund winger Marco Reus who will face his former club. ""I think it's a great way to start,"" he told German football magazine Kicker having signed for Dortmund in 2012 from 'Gladbach, who finished third last season. ""Not only because it's against my former club, but because against Moenchengladbach we can immediately show what level we are at."" Under Tuchel, who's renowned for altering formations during matches, Dortmund have won ten of their 11 pre-season matches, as they move forward into the post-Klopp era. Gladbach, who will compete in the Champions League group stages this season for the first time since reaching the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1977/78, are expected to go well again this season after last year's third-placed finish."
655,06/08/2015,23:38,"West Ham and Sampdoria crash, Saints, Dortmund through","West Ham manager Slaven Bilic's decision to put out a young, largely inexperienced side for the second leg of their Europa League third qualifying round tie at Astra Giurgiu backfired when the Romanians ran out 2-1 winners on Thursday.","The Hammers, who had let slip a two-goal lead and conceded a last-gasp equaliser in the first leg last week, went out 4-3 on aggregate. It had all started so well as a goal from debutant Manuel Lanzini inside three minutes put them ahead. But two quick goals in three minutes from skipper Constantin Budescu, after 33 and 36 minutes, put the Romanians in the driving seat. Bilic defended his decision to rest a host of first-choice players ahead of their Premier League opener against Arsenal on Sunday. ""It is a good experience for a few of the youngsters but some of the guys who played tonight showed us they are going to be very useful,"" said Bilic. ""We have a big season ahead of us which starts on Sunday and we are going to be good in the Premier League. I am very confident about that."" Borussia Dortmund, who were Champions League runners-up in 2013, eased into Friday's play-off draw with a 5-0 mauling of Wolfsberg of Austria for a 6-0 aggregate. Henrikh Mkhitaryan grabbed the headlines with a hat-trick in 13 second-half minutes. Southampton were already 3-0 up in their tie against Vitesse Arnhem from the first leg and cruised through 5-0 on aggregate after Graziano Pelle's low shot after four minutes killed the tie off as a contest and Senegalese striker Sadio Mane added the final flourish a minute from the end. The result was slightly tainted by news that Dutch police made 53 arrests in Arnhem before the game. But for once it was not just English supporters who were rounded up, as reports suggested that 50 of those detained in the city's bar district, where opposing fans had apparently been drinking together peacefully, were Dutch and only three of them English. Walter Zenga's Sampdoria were also losers against Vojvodina of Serbia despite winning their second leg 2-0. But their shock 4-0 defeat on home turf last week proved too great a deficit to recover. Aberdeen were held 1-1 by Kazakh side Kairat Almaty and went out 3-2 on aggregate. Gerard Gohou opened the scoring after 59 minutes for the visitors and although Kenny McLean levelled on the night, the Dons could not find the second goal that would have seen them take the tie into extra-time. Athletic Bilbao did just enough to reach the play-offs by holding Inter Baku of Azerbaijan 0-0. Having done the hard part in the home leg last week, they moved into Friday's draw 2-0 on aggregate. Rubin Kazan of Russia came into their second leg against seasoned European campaigners Sturm Graz 3-2 up from the away leg and survived a brief scare when Josip Tadic put the Austrians ahead on the night. But it was left to captain Oleg Kuzmin to steady the ship five minutes from the end with an equaliser which left it 1-1 to send Kazan through 4-3 on aggregate."
656,27/07/2015,16:16,"German clubs are scared of Bayern, says Hummels","Most German clubs are afraid of playing against Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich -- and it needs to stop, says Borussia Dortmund star Mats Hummels says.","Bavarian giants Bayern kick off the new season on August 14 at home to Hamburg and are bidding to become the first team to win four straight league titles, having won last season's Bundesliga with four games left. But Hummels said most German teams make the Bavarians' life easier by showing them too much respect -- both on and off the pitch. ""In Germany, too many clubs behave with an element of fear against Bayern, both verbally and on the pitch,"" the Germany defender and World Cup winner told magazine Kicker. ""They would do well to cut that out. You often get the feeling that many other teams have already written off their matches against Bayern before the game even starts."" Hummels says too many teams simply opt for damage limitation against Pep Guardiola's Bayern. The point was proved when Paderborn coach Andre Breitenreiter said ""Many thanks for the experience!"" in the direction of the Munich bench after his side's 6-0 defeat last season. Dortmund finished seventh in the league after a disastrous start to the season which left them bottom in February, leading to coach Jurgen Klopp's resignation at the end of the campaign. Having won the 2011 and 2012 Bundesliga titles with Dortmund under Klopp, Hummels will play under new Borussia coach Thomas Tuchel when their season opens at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach on August 15. Dortmund face a two-leg play-off against Austrian side Wolfsburg to qualify for the Europa League next season, but Hummels says their focus is on the Bundesliga. ""The fact we want to -- and need to -- reach the (Europa League) group stages is beyond question,"" he said. ""But for us players, it's clear that what counts is places one to three (in the league), with fourth place as a bare minimum. That's what we're working for."""
657,12/07/2015,17:23,Dortmund loan misfit Immobile to Sevilla,Borussia Dortmund have sent Italy striker Ciro Immobile on loan to Europa League champions Sevilla following just one season in Germany after he failed to break into the first team.,"The 25-year-old, who was brought in to replace Robert Lewandowski, is set to sign a one-year deal to join the Spanish league side after starting just nine league games for Dortmund last season since his transfer from Torino in 2014. He failed to make his mark on the 2013 Champions League finalists having been the Serie A top scorer with 22 goals in 33 appearances in his final season in Italy. He scored just three goals in 23 league appearances, most of which were off the bench. Immobile scored four goals in six Champions League games for Dortmund last season and according to media reports, the German club will receive an initial payment of three million euros ($3.3m) for the player who cost them 18 million. New Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel is said to have no plans for Immobile in his team and the Italian did not help his cause by oversleeping for a team public relations appointment on their recent Asia tour. Seville confirmed the transfer on their website and said Immobile will undergo a medical in Spain on Monday."

""When the big clubs, and Manchester United is one of the biggest clubs in the world, is interested in you, it's an honour and it's a kind of an acceptance of what you play... so it's a good thing,"" he said during Dortmund's Asian tour. ""There's always been rumours for the last years about almost every one of our players but I decided not to make a move this year and that's the only thing I can say about that,"" he added. Hummels, 26, lifted the World Cup in Brazil last year and would be a welcome addition for United as manager Louis van Gaal looks to shore up his defence. Team-mate Ilkay Gundogan also rebuffed recent United advances and he spoke of his close bond with Japan's Shinji Kagawa, who is back at Dortmund after an unhappy spell at Old Trafford. ""I used to live with Shinji, when I came to Borussia Dortmund, in the same building so for us it was very easy (to get along) because sometimes we drove together to training and also back,"" said the central midfielder. ""We just started to use one car because it was better for both. After training sessions, we went to dinner or anything and that's how we become really good friends,"" Gundogan said. Dortmund have also been to Japan on their tour and they will play in Malaysia on Thursday under new coach Thomas Tuchel, who replaced the influential Jurgen Klopp. ""You see some small differences in training and what he wants us to do with the ball, especially with the way he talks, the way he analyses our games and shows us videos. Of course it's really different,"" said Hummels."

Having won six caps for Australia, Langerak completed his transfer to Stuttgart on Monday and jumped straight into training at his new club's pre-season camp in Austria. ""Stuttgart was always a tough opponent, who always fought hard against Dortmund. The team has quality and I am proud to be part of this team,"" Langerak told the Stuttgarter Nachrichten. ""I am aware that I need to work hard in pre-season so that I can play. ""When things get going again, we want to start our season well, then we'll see what's possible."" Stuttgart face Cologne in their opening match when the new season begins in August. He will be fighting with Poland international Przemyslaw Tyton and Germany Under-20 goalkeeper Odisseas Vlachodimos for the Number One shirt at Stuttgart, who only narrowly avoided relegation last season to finish 14th in the table, while Dortmund were seventh. ""For goalkeepers, it is quit normal that they have to compete with one or two good rivals and we all have to fight for a regular place,"" said Langerak. ""I expected this situation and I am looking forward to the challenge."""

However, according to German media that deal fell through over Gundogan's wage demands. ""I am happy that the way has been cleared for me to continue to play for Borussia Dortmund,"" said Gundogan on the website. ""I am going to immediately concentrate fulltime on getting ready for next season, as in August we want to be primed to go straight on the attack.""

Langerak joined Borussia in 2010 from Melbourne but never really held down a regular number one spot and had to be satisfied with an understudy role to Roman Weidenfeller.

""After seven intensive and emotional years, I think it makes sense to process the countless memories, so that my coaching team and I can start our next job fresh and motivated,"" said Klopp on Monday after a meeting with his agent Marc Kosicke. But with no specification as to how long the break will last, Klopp is sure to end his self-imposed sabbatical as soon as the right job offer comes along.

His farewell party in East Berlin went on until just before 0500 local time (0300 GMT) on Sunday and amongst his parting gifts were Dortmund season tickets for his family. Klopp has given no hint of his future, but given his impressive pedigree the 47-year-old is unlikely to be away from football for long with several English side reported to be interested. ""This is here and now my hardest moment,"" Klopp told around 2,000 guests at his party. ""The pain of saying goodbye is building slowly and it really hurts. ""I have tried to express my thanks to each player, because it has been to me an extraordinary pleasure, a great honour to work with them and I find it hard to let go. ""The disappointment from the defeat is huge, but it was a fitting final. ""Both teams really went for it, but those three goals in 16 minutes decided the game, they were silly goals to concede at the end of the day, but congratulations to Wolfsburg. ""I know life goes on."" Dortmund were left to rue their wasted opportunities as Marco Reus fired over the bar in the first-half with his side leading 1-0 and Borussia were denied a clear late penalty. The defeat means Dortmund must now go through the qualifying rounds for the Europa League having missed the chance to claim a direct entry had they won the final. Dortmund's defeat now means arch-rivals Schalke qualify directly for the Europa League because of their sixth-place finish in the Bundesliga. Dortmund fans chanted Klopp's name after the final whistle, but he said it was little comfort after the defeat. ""It was a great thing to hear, but was little consolation after the defeat,"" he said. ""We've grown together over the years, but it wasn't any comfort. ""When you have wanted something so badly, and then not achieved it, you need a moment to gather yourself.

Klopp baulked when asked if he imagined himself as Schalke coach next season to replace Roberto di Matteo, who resigned last week, but Eintracht Frankfurt are eager for him to replace recently-departed Thomas Schaaf. ""In all honesty, Jurgen Klopp fits better at Eintracht Frankfurt than Schalke 04 -- there is more scope to develop raw talent,"" Frankfurt chairman Heribert Bruchhagen told Sport1. ""The number of candidates is a prime number."" And Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking said Klopp's farewell is more of a 'see you soon'. ""Too much was made of this being Klopp's final game in the build-up,"" said Hecking, who won the first title of his career at 50. ""We'll see him coaching somewhere else soon, I'm sure, and I looked forward to seeing him around again."""

He will replace former captain Sebastian Kehl, who is retiring, and Ilkay Gundogan, who is expected to leave Borussia after turning down a contract extension.

669,23/05/2015,19:12,Dortmund claim Europa place on Klopp's home bow,Borussia Dortmund earned the chance of a Europa League place next season with a 3-2 win over Werder Bremen as coach Jurgen Klopp signed off his final home game.,"Dortmund finish seventh to go into the qualifiers for the Europa League, but can claim a direct place in the group stages if they beat Wolfsburg in next Saturday's German Cup final in Berlin in Klopp's final match as Borussia boss. Klopp walks away after seven years in charge having won the 2011 and 2012 German league titles, plus steering Dortmund to the 2013 Champions League final, and will be replaced next season by ex-Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel. The 47-year-old can now sign off with the cup title he craves if they beat Wolfsburg in the Berlin cup final next Saturday. ""It was a great game, we had a good system and options galore, but I have no complaints, seventh place is the best we could have hoped for,"" said Klopp, whose side were bottom of the table in February. ""It was an outstanding display, but the game summed up our season: we started really well, but lost out way and made things hard for ourselves."" A five-minute long, pre-recorded video message from Klopp to Dortmund fans was screened at the Westfalenstadion after the final whistle and Klopp explained why. ""I learnt my lesson the last time I tried to give a prepared speech seven years ago when I left Mainz and could barely get the words out,"" he said. ""I didn't want to make the same mistake again. It was pure emotion out there."" Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa profited from a superb pass by Ilkay Gundogan to score Dortmund's first on 15 minutes. Gabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored the hosts second to claim his 16th for the season, just two minutes later before Bremen pulled a goal back through midfielder Levin Oztunali on 26 minutes. But Dortmund made sure of the win when Henrikh Mkhitaryan controlled Kagawa's high pass to lob Bremen goalkeeper Koen Casteels to make it 3-1 just before the break. Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie scored Bremen's late second to set up a tense finale as Borussia held on. Klopp was treated to a standing ovation after the final whistle, as was former Dortmund captain and Germany international Sebastian Kehl, 35, who will retire at the end of the season."
670,22/05/2015,14:38,Klopp set for emotional farewell in Dortmund,Jurgen Klopp admits he may not be able to contain his emotions for his last home league game as Borussia Dortmund coach when he hosts Werder Bremen on Saturday.,"""There will be a special atmosphere and I don't know what will be going on inside me after the final if we win,"" admitted the 47-year-old. Klopp's final game in charge is the German Cup final on May 30 against VfL Wolfsburg at Berlin's Olympic Stadium having announced in April that he will leave at the end of the season. But emotions promise to run high at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion when the vast majority of the sold-out 80,667-strong crowd farewell their hero. Dortmund can finish in the top six with three points, providing Borussia Moechengladbach beat Augsburg, which would give them a Europa League berth under Klopp's replacement Thomas Tuchel. But likewise, a win for Bremen could put them in the Europa League next season, providing Wolfsburg beat Dortmund in the cup final the week after. ""Both teams have a huge chance and for us, the Europa League has been the most we could achieve for months,"" said Klopp. ""We don't feel any pressure, we just see a great opportunity."" It is also the last home game of ex-Germany international and former Dortmund captain Sebastian Kehl before retiring. ""It's the last league game of the season and the last home match of Sebastian Kehl, who has played an incredibly important role for the club in recent years,"" said Klopp. ""The question is: what role will nostalgia play compared to the here and now? ""I hope that we will manage to put on a really good 'Dortmund' display and run a real full-throttle event."" In their six completed seasons under Klopp, Dortmund have never finished lower than sixth with the team currently seventh. They won the 2011 and 2012 German league titles, then finished second to Bayern Munich for the last two years having lost to them in the 2013 Champions League final. Having finished sixth in his first season in 2008/09, Klopp's side can complete the circle by finishing in the same position this term. Klopp admits it is a far cry from February when they were bottom of the table. ""It's something I couldn't even dream of back then,"" he admitted. ""That was when I thought things could be really tight for us (to avoid relegation). ""You can't imagine how grateful I am to be in this situation where we don't have to experience the raging relegation battle first hand. ""For the last four or five weeks we have been able to change our perspective and busy ourselves with a bigger goal."" Klopp says his task on Saturday will be to blend out any distractions until after the final whistle. ""Of course I'm going to miss the passionate support from the south stand,"" he said. ""But my task is to not allow myself to go into this game with too much nostalgia."" Klopp insists he will only think about his future plans at the end of the season. He has been linked to several English clubs and Germany coach Joachim Loew does not expect him to be unemployed for long. ""I have great respect for his decision,"" said Loew. ""He has continued to put 100 percent into the service of the club, the team and its players. ""That's what he's all about, he's a trainer who gives his heart and soul. ""And for me, it's clear that we will see him again soon."""
671,22/05/2015,02:22,Klopp aims for Europe on his Dortmund home bow,Jurgen Klopp plans to bow out of his last Bundesliga home game as Borussia Dortmund coach with a win over Werder Bremen on Saturday to help their Europa League bid.,"After two German league titles and a Champions League final appearance in the last seven years, Klopp leads out Borussia for the last time at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion and wants a top performance. ""I hope that we will manage to put on a really good 'Dortmund' display and run a real full-throttle event"", enthused Klopp, who will be replaced by Thomas Tuchel next season. The 47-year-old's final game as Dortmund coach will be at Berlin's Olympic Stadium in the German Cup final against Wolfsburg on May 30, but he wants to beat Bremen in a bid to finish sixth. Both eighth-placed Bremen and Dortmund, who are seventh, need three points - and hope Borussia Moenchengladbach beat Augsburg - to finish sixth to guarantee a Europa League place next season. As an added incentive, Dortmund have never finished lower than sixth under Klopp after winning the 2011 and 2012 German league titles, then having finished second to champions Bayern Munich in the last two seasons. With former Germany international Sebastian Kehl also playing his final home game before retiring, it promises to be an emotional afternoon. Veteran Roman Weidenfeller, who has recovered from injury is expected to replace Australia international Mitchell Langerak in goal. And Dortmund captain Mats Hummels, who is reported to have turned down an approach from Manchester United, will return after sitting out last Saturday's defeat at Wolfsburg with a bruised foot. Either way, a top sixth finish would be an impressive achievement for either Bremen or Dortmund, who were bottom of the table in December and February respectively. Bayern will be crowned German league champions for the 25th time regardless of the result of their home match against Mainz. Pep Guardiola's side are looking to finish in style after losing five of their last six matches. They were knocked out of both the Champions League and German Cup semi-finals in a horror four-week period since winning the title with four games to spare. But Guardiola has still won five titles in two years in Munich. One of the tightest relegation battles in Bundesliga history will unfold with the bottom six teams all fighting to avoid the dreaded drop. The bottom two sides, currently Paderborn and Hamburg, will be relegated automatically while the 16th-placed team faces a play-off with the third-best team in the second division. Bottom side Paderborn can finish no higher than 16th, which would offer them a survival chance in the play-off. They host Stuttgart, who are two places higher in the table, while the team sandwiched between them, Hamburg, are at home to fifth-placed Schalke. Hamburg, the only side in Germany's top flight never to have been relegated, will be without their ex-Germany midfielder Marcell Jansen, who has a thigh injury. ""We have to get a result, it's the only thing we can influence,"" said Hamburg coach Bruno Labbadia. Hanover are at home to Freiburg, who enjoyed a shock 2-1 win over Bayern last Saturday, with both sides locked on 34 points, just one above the relegation places. ""In such extreme situations, the characters come out,"" said Freiburg coach Christian Streich. ""You can see how great the pressure is, some can't handle it."" Hertha Berlin could drop from 13th into the relegation mire and 16th with a defeat at Hoffenheim which would threaten their third relegation in five years. ""We're not going to bunker down in front of our box, we have an aggressive midfield pressing and we want to use that,"" said Hertha coach Pal Dardai.

""Dortmund have got in touch about Castro and it looks like he is going to transfer,"" confirmed Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller. With Dortmund's Sebastian Kehl retiring at the end of the season and Ilkay Gundogan having refused to sign a contract extension, Borussia's in-coming coach Thomas Tuchel needs a defensive midfielder for next season. As well as Castro, Dortmund are also negotiating with Mainz's Johannes Geis. ""I don't want to blame myself later for not having taken on a new challenge,"" said Castro, who won the last of his five caps for Germany in 2007 and joined Bayer in 1999. Meanwhile, Leverkusen, who are set to finish fourth in the Bundesliga which means a play-off to qualify for the Champions League, has extended Schmidt's contract until 2019. Schmidt's deal had been due to expire in June 2016, but he has convinced Bayer's bosses by steering the team to the knock-out phase of the Champions League where they lost to Atletico Madrid on penalties in the last 16. ""We're at the start of a development and have a young team with huge potential and a great team spirit,"" said the 48-year-old Schmidt. ""Along with my coaching team, I am looking forward to furthering this development in the coming years."""

""It was fair enough that Mats gave it some thought, but I have always pointed out that he is firmly part of our plans,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc. Zorc said he had met with Hummels and his father Hermann, who is also his agent, in which there was a ""clear consensus"" that he would stay with Dortmund. Hummels fuelled speculation that he was considering a move to United in recent weeks by repeatedly admitting he was weighing up his options. Reports in the UK media suggested Louis van Gaal's United had offered 40 million euros ($44.6m) for Hummels. But the Germany star will now play a central role in the plans of future Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, who will replace current boss Jurgen Klopp next season. A bruised foot meant Hummels sat out last Saturday's 2-1 league defeat at VfL Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga, a dress rehearsal for the German Cup final on May 30. He should be fit for Saturday's final home match against Werder Bremen with Dortmund needing a win, and for other results to go their way, in their bid for a Europa League place next season. Hummels, a World Cup winner, came to Dortmund in 2008 on loan basis from Bayern Munich before signing a full contract and has made 194 league appearances scoring 17 goals."

His final home game at Borussia's Westfalenstadion is on Saturday with Dortmund hoping to claim a Europa League place with a win over Werder Bremen, providing results elsewhere go their way, to finish in the top six. Despite having started February at the bottom of the table, Dortmund are currently seventh and just three points from sixth place and a Europa League spot. With coach Jurgen Klopp also set for his final home game after six years in charge, it promises to be an emotional afternoon in Dortmund. Kehl's final game in the famous black-and-yellow shirt will be the following Saturday at Berlin's Olympic Stadium in the German Cup final against Wolfsburg. ""You couldn't have scripted it better that things would have taken such a turn,"" said Kehl, who won the last of his 31 caps in 2006 and made appearances at two World Cups. ""We have the chance in our two final matches to turn a scatty season into something positive."" After 13 years at the top of German football, including the league titles of 2002, 2011 and 2012, Kehl says now is the time to quit, but says ""a life of freedom will certainly be a change"". ""I can well imagine staying in sport, but I'm not going to throw myself straight into something new,"" he added."
675,20/05/2015,11:51,Reus refuses to press GBH charges after foul,"Germany winger Marco Reus has refused to press charges of grievous bodily harm against a defender for a foul during a German Cup match, despite a two-month long police investigation.","Reus lasted just 24 minutes of Dortmund's 2-0 third-round win over third-division Dynamo Dresden and was left with a knee injury after being fouled off-the-ball by Dresden defender Dennis Erdmann. Having investigated Erdmann for what was seen as a malicious, rather than sporting challenge, Dresden police have confirmed they have closed the matter. ""We've closed the case because the affected player has not made a complaint,"" a spokesman for the Dresden Prosecutor's Office told SID, an AFP subsidiary. Reus advisor Dirk Hebel told German daily Bild that the German international was sent a form by Dresden police asking if he wanted to press charges, but declined. ""He didn't want the player to be prosecuted,"" explained Hebel after his client was left with a bruised knee from the incident. Having missed Germany's World Cup win last July with an ankle injury, Reus has endured an injury-ravaged season and to add insult to injury, Erdmann had mocked the Dortmund star after he was helped off in Dresden. ""I used to play in the regional league and when you'd get a knock like that, you'd give it a rub and play on. I don't think it's like that in the Bundesliga,"" said Erdmann after the match. Reus has himself been in trouble with police this season after being fined 540,000 euros ($600,374) last December for driving without a licence since 2011. Dortmund will play VfL Wolfsburg at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 30 in the German Cup final and hope to have Reus fit."

Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid are also watching his Dortmund teammate Gundogan who refused to sign a new deal. Second-place Wolfsburg could struggle to hold onto Belgian international de Bruyne who has been heavily linked to a return to the English Premier League with Manchester United or Manchester City. He could also tempt Bayern Munich as they rebuild after failing to reach the Champions League final. Wolfsburg and seventh-place Dortmund dispute the German Cup final in Berlin on May 30 but both have unfinished Bundesliga business first. Reus took part in team training on Thursday having missed Saturday's win over Hertha Berlin with a groin injury and could play a part in Borussia's push for a European berth next season at Wolves. Dortmund, who will also lose coach Jurgen Klopp at the end of the season, have risen 11 places since the winter break and a win would be an enormous boost in efforts to claim a Europa League spot. They are currently two points off sixth place Schalke. Klopp stressed how Wolfsburg have won only three points more than Dortmund since the winter break. ""The difference between the two sides isn't as great as it was in the first half of the season,"" said Klopp who insisted the German Cup clash would be ""a completely different contest"". Wolfsburg are also desperate for a win to stay ahead of Borussia Moenchengladbach in the battle for second place in the Bundesliga. And they have not lost a game at home yet this season. Marcel Schafer, Luiz Gustavo and Ivan Perisic are being treated for ""slight knocks"" but manager Dieter Hecking said ""our aim is to end the season unbeaten in our own stadium."" Third place Borussia Monchengladbach, just two points behind Wolfsburg, go to Werder Bremen looking for their first win there in 28 years. Still smarting from their Champions League semi-final exit to Barcelona, champions Bayern Munich are at Freiburg with Pep Guardiola's side now just playing for pride. Their 25th German league title is already won. Freiburg are only out of the relegation places on goal difference and would relish the chance of a rare win over the Bavarian giants however. Guardiola is already reportedly planning to rebuild his squad for September. ""We want to fight back next season. We'll start from the beginning again,"" he said after the Barcelona game. With Dortmund breathing down their neck, Schalke host relegation-threatened Paderborn having shaken up their squad after one win in eight games by releasing Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng and Germany winger Sidney Sam. Royal Blues bosses are furious after last Sunday's embarrassing 2-0 defeat at Cologne and are desperate to the defeats which threaten their place in Europe next season. There will also be a battle royal at the bottom of the table as two former Bundesliga giants slug it out when bottom side Stuttgart host Hamburg, also in the danger zone, with just two points separating the bottom sides which also including Paderborn, Freiburg and Hanover."

""Therefore this will be an historic game and the first time in a competitive match where the technology has been used here,"" said DFB general secretary Helmut Sandrock. The top clubs in Germany's first two divisions voted last December in favour of bringing it in in time for next season. Last year's Cup final was won 2-0 by Bayern Munich in extra time against Dortmund, but only after officials failed to spot that a header from Borussia defender Mats Hummels had crossed the line during the 90 minutes. ""The technology can only improve things,"" said Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. ""That was a clear goal -- if it had counted, we would have won the final."""

But in two seasons with the Bavarian giants Goetze has failed to win a regular place in the starting line-up under Pep Guardiola and there have been rumours of a return to Dortmund, which the club have now dismissed. ""That's totally unrealistic,"" Borussia CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke told local newspaper WAZ. ""Look at the salary levels of Bayern and Dortmund at a glance and you'll have your answer."" Having been linked to both Manchester United and Bayern, Gundogan will not extend his contract which expires in June 2016 and Dortmund expect to sell him this summer rather than lose him on a free transfer. ""Our talks came to the conclusion that he won't extend his contract and will leave in the summer,"" said Dortmund's sporting director Michael Zorc. ""But that depends on what offers land on my table and until now we have received no offers for Gundogan."" Signed by Dortmund from Nuremberg in 2011, Gundogan was part of the team which won the 2012 Bundesliga and German Cup double, but missed virtually the whole of last season with a back injury. After seven years in charge, coach Jurgen Klopp will leave Dortmund at the end of the season and will be replaced by ex-Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel. Klopp insists he has ""no list of clubs interested nor contacts to anyone"" and will make a decision on his future only after the current season concludes when Dortmund face Wolfsburg in the German Cup final on May 30. Dortmund plan a week-long Asia tour in the summer when Tuchel will take the 2013 Champions League runners-up to Singapore, Malaysia and Japanese capital Tokyo with their first game in Bahru, Malaysia on July 9.

""I think that it's crazy Bayern now try to put the blame on the referee,"" Kehl said. ""They've done it quite often when getting defeated by us."" ""I have some advice for Kehl: when you're trailing by more than 35 points (in the Bundesliga), you should shut up,"" said Guardiola, a finger in front of his mouth, in Friday's press conference. ""Now we have time to practise since we're already champions,"" added the Catalan who saw his team win its third straight Bundesliga last weekend. But their hope of winning the treble were ended on Tuesday after losing 2-0 to Jurgen Klopp's men on penalties after their German Cup semi-final finished 1-1 after extra time. Before Dortmund equalised after 75 minutes, referee Peter Gagelmann denied Bayern a clear penalty when Borussia left back Marcel Schmelzer blocked a Thomas Muller move with his arm. ""We played against 12 man today,"" Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge later complained. Guardiola also told Kehl he was always respectful with his opponents: ""I never make fun of anyone, even when I win,"" he explained."

German daily Bild report Langerak sent Lewandowski a text message to apologise and says he hopes the Poland striker will be able to face Barcelona in the Champions League's semi-final next Wednesday. ""Robert and I are friends and of course I am sorry for what happened,"" said Australia international Langerak, who was outstanding against Bayern. ""I hope he can play as soon as possible. ""Anyone who knows me knows it wasn't intentional and that I wanted to clear the ball."" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge is hopeful Lewandowski will play with a mask at Barcelona's Camp Nou.

Gagelmann, 46, from Bremen admitted he missed a clear handball in the area by Dortmund defender Marcel Schmelzer on 55 minutes. Bayern were leading 1-0 at the time thanks to Robert Lewandowski's first-half goal. After Gagelmann waved away Bayern's furious demands for a penalty at the Allianz Arena, Borussia equalised on 75 minutes through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to make it 1-1 and take the game to extra-time. Neither side managed to add to the score and Bayern then failed to convert all four spot kicks as Dortmund won 2-0 on penalties. But Gagelmann has admitted he was wrong not to award Bayern a second-half penalty for Schmelzer's handball. ""I have to say that it was the wrong decision not to blow the whistle for the foul,"" he said. ""I am very sorry, it's really annoying."" Gagelmann declined to comment on the 117th-minute collision between Dortmund's goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak and Robert Lewandowski in the area. Contact was made as Borussia's shot-stopper went to punch the ball away, but the Bayern striker was left concussed with a broken cheekbone and nose. Bayern's cup final defeat ends their hopes of repeating their 2013 feat of winning the European, league and cup titles, having clinched the Bundesliga title with four matches to spare at the weekend.

Borussia knocked out Bayern with a 2-0 win in the penalty shoot-out after Tuesday's semi-final finished 1-1 after extra-time in Munich. The Berlin final will be Klopp's final appearance as Dortmund's head coach after seven successful years. They won the 2011 and 2012 league titles, before finishing runners-up to Bayern for the last two years, and reached the 2013 Champions League final. It will be the third time in four years that Dortmund have reached the cup final under Klopp having routed Bayern 5-2 in the 2012 final before losing 2-0 to the Bavarians last year after extra-time. ""We want to bring the cup back to Dortmund,"" said Klopp, after Bayern missed all four of their spot-kicks in the Munich shoot-out. ""I wanted to go back to Berlin again, it's something I had been thinking about, but you don't need to talk about me at the moment."" When he announced he was leaving a fortnight ago, Klopp said he wanted one last title and another trip on an open-air bus along the Borsigplatz in Dortmund's city centre to celebrate with their fans. ""That would be a wonderful, but deserved send-off,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc in the direction of his coach. While the Dortmund squad sported ""Berlin, here we come"" T-shirts after their Allianz Arena triumph, Klopp singled out Borussia's Australia goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak for praise. ""In games like that you need big moments and an exceptional performance in goal. He was superb,"" said Klopp, as Lagerak stepped in to replace injured first-choice Roman Weidenfeller. The 26-year-old Socceroo was described by Dortmund's veteran midfielder Sebastian Kehl as ""our hero"". ""Who would have thought last December that we'd reach the final,"" added Kehl after Dortmund finished 2014 in the Bundesliga's relegation places and dropped to bottom in February after a dire series of results. With four games left, the 2013 Champions League finalists could finish in the German league's top six to qualify for the Europa League next season. They have four league games before the Berlin final against at Hoffenheim, who are also challenging for Europe, mid-table Hertha Berlin, second-placed VfL Wolfsburg and Werder Bremen.

Lewandowski, Bayern's top scorer with 22 goals, finished the match as a dazed figure following a collision with Langerak late in extra time. The former Dortmund striker was taken to hospital and is doubtful for next Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, first-leg, at Barcelona. ""I hope Robert is OK, he's a good friend of mine and it was an accident,"" said Langerak, who is Australia's reserve goalkeeper behind Matt Ryan. Langerak is set to feature in the final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 30 against either Wolfsburg or minnows Arminia Bielefeld who meet in Wednesday's other semi-final. ""I have never experienced a night like this before, it's hard to find the words,"" said the former Melbourne Victory goalkeeper who joined Dortmund in 2010. Langerak was booked for time-wasting just before Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer hit the crossbar with Bayern's fourth penalty to send Dortmund to the final. ""I wanted to leave the goalmouth open for as long as possible to increase the pressure,"" he explained. ""Sometimes it works and today was our day. ""The coach spoke to me before the shootout, but I know what to do in that situation. Penalties are my thing."""

Klopp wants to bow out with one last title and only holders Bayern stand in the way of a German Cup final appearance on May 30 at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. In Wednesday's other semi, third division leaders and cup giant-killers Arminia Bielefeld host VfL Wolfsburg. Having already beaten Bundesliga side Hertha Berlin, Werder Bremen and Moenchengladbach en route to the semis, Bielefeld are one game away a first cup final appearance. But Dortmund-Bayern is the key tie with Pep Guardiola's Bavarians bidding to repeat their 2013 treble having already captured the league title on Sunday for the 25th time. Bayern had planned to present Klopp with a bouquet before kick-off after his side won the 2011 and 2012 German league titles before finishing as runners-up to Bayern for the last two seasons. But the 47-year-old is more interested in giving Bayern a proverbial black eye than picking up floral tribute. ""It's a very nice gesture, but on Tuesday we'll be spoiling for a fight and we don't want to weaken ourselves with flowers,"" said Klopp. Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has spoken to Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and the presentation will now be done after the game. ""We are in the decisive phase of the season -- and not in farewell (for Klopp) mode,"" said Watzke. Rummenigge explained his reason for the flowers as he was presented with a bouquet in 1984 on his final appearance at Dortmund before his transfer from Bayern to Inter Milan. ""I have no problem with that and can understand where they are coming from,"" said the Bayern boss. ""I respect that he (Klopp) doesn't want to break the fighting spirit with flowers.""

The Munich showdown will be a repeat of both the 2012 and 2014 German Cup finals in Berlin when Dortmund routed Bayern 5-2 three years ago, when Langerak came off the bench early on after a Weidenfeller injury. Pep Guardiola's Bayern took revenge with a 2-0 extra-time victory in Berlin last year as they won the league and cup double. With six caps for the Socceroos as Mat Ryan's understudy, the 26-year-old Langerak has played in six Bundesliga matches, four German Cup games and a single Champions League match this season. He briefly replaced Weidenfeller as Dortmund's first choice goalkeeper just before Christmas. After Dortmund started February bottom of the Bundesliga table following a disastrous set of results, the 2011 and 2012 German champions have climbed up to eighth after their win over Frankfurt. They are just three points from the Europa League places for next season. With Weidenfeller out for the next two weeks, Langerak will also play in Dortmund's next two league matches against fellow European candidates Hoffenheim and mid-table Hertha Berlin in the coming weeks."

If he is not quite ready for Saturday it would be great to have him there on Tuesday."" Reus has missed Dortmund's last three outings with an adductor problem. Earlier this week it was revealed that he is being investigated by police for another motoring offence, despite being fined 540,000 euros ($576,371) last year for driving without a licence."

After Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp announced last Wednesday that he would leave at the end of the season, Hummels is set to be the next big name star to leave the 2013 Champions League finalists, according to the magazine. German daily Bild claim United's offer is too low for Borussia, but Dortmund could be persuaded to part with their captain for 40 million euros. Hummels joined Dortmund from rivals Bayern Munich in 2007 on a loan deal before Borussia paid 4.2 million euros for him two years later. The 26-year-old was part of the Dortmund squad which won the 2011 and 2012 German league titles before finishing runners-up to Bayern for the last two years, and was first-choice during the World Cup campaign scoring two goals for Germany at Brazil 2014."

The fleet-footed Reus, who is nicknamed 'Rolls Reus', had produced a fake Dutch driving licence when he was stopped for speeding in Dortmund in March 2014. Now the Borussia Dortmund star, who missed last year's World Cup with an ankle injury on the eve of the tournament, is again in trouble with police for a fresh driving violation. ""On December 19, 2014, a new investigation has been initiated,"" a spokeswomen for Dortmund's public prosecution service told SID, an AFP subsidiary, without giving details. The new investigation is reported to have had some ""input from the public"". The Germany star could be heavily fined and disqualified from applying for a drivers licence if it emerges again that he has been driving without a permit.

693,18/04/2015,14:40,Dortmund poised to name Klopp's successor,"Borussia Dortmund hope to name Jurgen Klopp's successor as head coach in the coming week, while hot favourite Thomas Tuchel made a rare appearance at Friday's Bundesliga clash in Frankfurt.","Tuchel, 41, earned his reputation as one of Germany's top coaches after five years at Mainz, but left in May 2014 after failing to agree terms. He made an unexpected showing on Friday to watch Eintracht Frankfurt's goalless draw against third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach in the German league. Having recently turned down the chance to coach relegation-threatened Hamburg and second division RB Leipzig, Tuchel is widely tipped to replace Klopp, who announced on Wednesday that he is leaving at the end of the season. Klopp's departure after eight years in charge was a shock for Dortmund after the 47-year-old steered them to the 2011 and 2012 German titles and the 2013 Champions League final before they finished as Bundesliga's runners-up for the last two years. ""The answer shouldn't take forever, I think next week we will be able to present a decent solution,"" Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said ahead of tenth-placed Borussia's Bundesliga clash against Paderborn on Saturday. ""I don't know who the coach will be and I wouldn't say so if I did. ""It will definitely not be a second division coach and will be German-speaking."" Gladbach's Swiss coach Lucien Favre ruled himself out of the running for the Dortmund job on Friday in a Sky Sports interview following his side's draw. ""I can only say that I won't be Borussia Dortmund coach next season,"" said the 57-year-old."
694,15/04/2015,17:17,Dortmund weigh options as Klopp bows out,Jurgen Klopp will walk away from Borussia Dortmund next month as one of the most successful coaches in the club's history -- and highly-regarded Thomas Tuchel widely tipped to take over.,"It took Klopp three attempts to get the words out no Dortmund fan wanted to hear in Wednesday's press conference. The 47-year-old confirmed he is leaving after two Bundesliga titles, a Champions League final appearance and the first league and cup double in Borussia's history during his seven years in charge. ""This is the right time for a change at Borussia Dortmund,"" said an emotional Klopp. ""A big head has to roll -- and it's mine."" Having been granted an early release from his contract, which ran until 2018, Klopp's last home match will be against Werder Bremen on May 23. ""It took me a while before I could even say the words,"" admitted Klopp, flanked by ashen-faced Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke and equally glum director of sport Michael Zorc. ""I wasn't sure until I couldn't answer the question whether I was still the perfect coach for Borussia Dortmund with a clear 'yes'. ""The change will be good for everyone. The club was great when I came and it's still great."" He admits he has ""one last dream"" of beating Bayern Munich in the German Cup semi-final on April 28 to bow out in style at the Berlin final on May 30. According to both German daily Bild and book-makers Bwin Tuchel, one of Germany's rising star coaches, is favourite to succeed Klopp, but Watzke says 'certainty over speed' is the priority in finding the right man. A quick glance at the table, where Dortmund are tenth, shows how far Klopp's side has slumped since winning back-to-back league titles in 2011 and 2012, then finishing as runners-up to Bayern for the last two years. Borussia were a mid-table side when Klopp arrived in 2008 before briefly usurping Bayern as Germany's top club in 2012, which was confirmed when the Bavarians were humbled 5-2 in that May's German Cup final. Following defeat to Bayern in the 2013 Champions League final, Dortmund finished second in the league in 2013 and 2014 until this season's drop off. Key injuries and a loss of form from their World Cup winners led to dire results which saw Dortmund drop to 17th in December and then last place in February. Their Champions League exit after home and away defeats to Juventus in the last-16 signalled how far they were from their incredible 4-1 rout of Real Madrid in Duortmund during the 2013 semi-finals en route to facing Bayern at Wembley. The charismatic Klopp, known for his trademark sideline-leaps of celebration after Dortmund goals, was suddenly a forelorn figure this season as his team lost repeatedly and their counter-pressing system failed to work. ""But you can be sure that after all this great success and this incredibly good co-operation, you will always have the eternal gratitude of Borussia Dortmund,"" said an emotional Watzke before hugging Klopp. As to his future, Klopp insists there has been no contact with any club. ""I'm not tired, I have not planned anything in the background, there will be no sabbatical, unless I am forced to take one, nothing is planned or calculated."" The timing of his announcement is simply to allow Dortmund to plan their future without him. ""I chose this time to announce it, because in the last few years, some player decisions were made late and there was no time to react,"" he added in reference to Mario Goetze's shock departure to Bayern in April 2013. German book-makers Bwin have Premier League clubs Manchester City, then Arsenal, as his most likely future employers, especially as Klopp speaks good English. ""Jurgen Klopp has a good reputation in England,"" said ex-Liverpool and Germany midfielder Dietmar Hamann. ""I think he would fit in well at Manchester City and they will certainly have talked about him."""
695,15/04/2015,13:39,Klopp to leave Dortmund at end of season,Borussia Dortmund announced Wednesday that Jurgen Klopp will quit as head coach at the end of the season after seven years in charge and two German league titles.,"The 47-year-old had a contract until 2018, but asked to be released early after a poor series of league results left Dortmund bottom of the table in February before climbing to their current position of tenth. Klopp was the first coach in Borussia's history to win the german double of domestic league and cup titles. He steered Dortmund to the 2013 Champions League final, when they lost at Wembley to Bundesliga rivals Bayern Munich, having won the 2011 and 2012 German league titles."
696,11/04/2015,17:41,Lewandowski double helps Bayern brush off injury woes,Robert Lewandowski scored twice as injury-hit Bayern Munich romped to a 3-0 league win over Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday to warm-up for their Champions League quarter-final at Porto.,"With second-placed Wolfsburg at Hamburg on Saturday night, league leaders Bayern took the chance to go thirteen points clear. Lewandowski, the Bundesliga's top scorer last season, added to his tally to leave him with 16 goals for the season and third in the current rankings. Frankfurt were missing the league's top scorer with Alexander Meier, who has 19 goals in 26 matches, out with a knee injury. Coach Pep Guardiola has described Bayern's injury situation ahead of Wednesday's first-leg at FC Porto as 'very critical' with only 14 players fit to face Frankfurt. ""I've never known anything like it in my career,"" rued the Spaniard before the win. Centre-back Medhi Benatia, who has a groin injury, joined flu-victim Bastian Schweinsteiger, plus wingers Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben and left-back David Alaba as just some of the stars on Bayern's casualty list. Guardiola made Bundesliga history by naming four Spain internationals in his starting line-up in Pepe Reina, Xabi Alonso, Thiago Alcantara and Juan Bernat. Despite their woes, Bayern needed just 15 minutes to take the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena when Lewandowski produced a world-class turn and volley. The Poland star made sure of the three points when he headed home, with suspicion of offside, on 66 minutes. Mueller added the third eight minutes from time when he fired home a seemingly-impossible angle. Third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach picked up their fourth straight league win with an impressive 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund. Tenth-placed Dortmund went behind after just 29 seconds as Patrick Herrmann's shot was blocked by Borussia's Roman Weidenfeller, but Sweden left-back Oscar Wendt slammed home the parry. Brazilian forward Raffel addded their second on 32 minutes after a strong run by Herrmann before Norway's Havard Nordveit fired home when left unmarked at the far post with 67 minutes gone before Ilkay Gundogan pulled a late goal back for Dortmund. Bayer Leverkusen enjoyed a 3-2 win over Mainz as they consider terminating the contract of Bosnia international Emir Spahic, who is being investigated by police for allegedly assaulting a club steward. South Korea striker Son Heung-Min opened the scoring with 15 minutes gone and Stefan Kiessling added a second early in the second-half. Dead-ball specialist Hakan Calhanoglu added their third when he drilled homehis 73rd-minute free-kick, but Mainz pulled a goal back when South Korea international Koo Ja-Cheol converted two late penalties. The win leaves Leverkusen fourth in the battle for one of the Bundesliga's three automatic Champions League places for next season. Fifth-placed Schalke are now 10 points adrift of a Champions League place for next season after their goalless draw with relegation-threatened Freiburg. Augsburg stay sixth in the league despite their shock 2-1 defeat at Paderborn, who picked up their first win since February to climb up to 16th. It left Hamburg second-from-bottom as they bid to avoid a first relegation from Germany's top tier."
697,08/04/2015,13:17,Dortmund set to lose next star as Hummels mulls future,Borussia Dortmund are facing the prospect of losing a star player for the third year running with Germany defender Mats Hummels waxing lyrical about a possible transfer abroad.,"Barcelona, Chelsea and Manchester United are reported to be interested in signing the 26-year-old, who has a market-value of around 35 million euros (£25.5m, US37.9m), on the back of outstanding performances at last year's World Cup. Having seen stars Mario Goetze, then Robert Lewandowski leave for Bayern Munich in recent seasons, Dortmund could sell Hummels to the highest bidder as his current contract runs until 2017. The centre-back's future is a hot topic in the German media, especially after he reportedly told Bild: ""it's Man Utd or no-one"" should he leave Dortmund. ""You know what I am like: I just say what is going around in my head,"" he told Sky Sports after Dortmund's 1-0 home defeat to Bayern on Saturday. ""That doesn't mean that I am leaving, it just means I'm considering things. ""There's no particular tendency one way or the other. ""It's just thoughts going through my mind and it's nothing that those in charge here don't already know. ""It will all become clearer in the coming weeks."" Dortmund insist Hummels will not be leaving anytime soon. ""We are planning further with him,"" Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc told German magazine Kicker. ""We will have another talk with Mats to see how we can go about working together further."" As Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke bluntly put it: ""The decision as to where Mats plays next season is, of course, only down to Borussia Dortmund"". Having joined Dortmund from Bayern in 2007 after one league appearance for the Bavarian giants, Hummels has blossomed under Borussia's charismatic coach Jurgen Klopp, who saw enough promise to thrust the then 19-year-old into his starting line-up. Under Klopp, Dortmund improved year-on-year until briefly usurping Bayern as Germany's top team by winning the 2011 Bundesliga title. They then claimed a first domestic double in the club's history by hammering Munich 5-2 in the 2012 German Cup final, as well as winning the league. ""I have a set-up here that I will probably find nowhere else,"" Hummels gushed in 2012 when he extended his contract, but Dortmund's fortunes have been in steady decline ever since. In April 2013, Borussia announced that Goetze had actioned a release clause in his contract to join Bayern for 37 million euros. To rub salt in Dortmund's wounds, Bayern then beat Dortmund 2-1 at Wembley in the 2013 Champions League final that May. After Lewandowski declined a contract extension, Bayern announced in January 2014 the hot-shot had signed a five-year deal to join them on a free transfer before the start of the current season. Hummels was outstanding in Brazil with two World Cup goals, but he struggled on his return to Dortmund. He made his first start in the 2-1 derby defeat at Schalke at the end of September, just as Dortmund's league form nose-dived. ""In the Bundesliga, everything that can go wrong is going wrong,"" Hummels said in October after their 1-0 home defeat to Hanover started the slide which left them bottom of the table in February. Dortmund were sent crashing out of the Champions League last month after comprehensive home and away defeats to Juventus in the last 16. Germany's pundits are backing Hummels' potential move to Old Trafford -- but for different reasons. ""At 26, Mats Hummels is the right age for a transfer to England. I could understand that,"" wrote Germany's former captain and coach Franz Beckenbauer. But Dietmar Hamann had a different take on Hummels' situation. ""After the way Hummels has played this season, perhaps the club won't be so sad if he goes for a high transfer fee,"" the ex-Germany and Liverpool midfielder told Sky Sports. ""If things continue as they are, then his transfer value will be halved or quartered."""
698,07/04/2015,23:19,Kehl thunderbolt puts Dortmund into Cup semis,Veteran midfielder Sebastian Kehl rolled back the years to score Borussia Dortmund's extra-time winner to seal a dramatic 3-2 victory over Hoffenheim in Tuesday's German Cup quarter-final.,"The 35-year-old Kehl scored his first German Cup goal when his fierce drive from outside the area put Dortmund in the semi-finals for the third time in four years. Kehl's speculative half-volley flew perfectly off his boot and into the Hoffenheim net on 107 minutes to the delight of home fans at Borussia's Westfalenstadion. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp showed his delight at Kehl's winning goal as he doffed his cap on the sidelines in the direction of the ex-Germany international. Dortmund had taken an early lead but Neven Subotic's goal was almost immediately cancelled out by Hoffenheim's Kevin Volland. Brazil international Roberto Firmino put Hoffenheim 2-1 up at half-time before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalised midway through the second-half. It stay 2-2 at the end of normal time. With holders Bayern Munich at Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday and third-division Arminia Bielefeld hoping for an upset against Borussia Moenchengladbach in the other last eight ties, Dortmund join VfL Wolfsburg in the draw for the semi-finals. Dortmund, who last won the German Cup in 2012, went ahead after centre-back Subotic smashed his shot in off the post with 19 minutes gone. The lead lasted just 102 seconds as winger Sebastian Rudy floated in a deep corner which found attacking midfielder Volland unmarked at the edge of the area to slam his shot home. The hosts then found themselves 2-1 behind after 28 minutes when Subotic stumbled in possession only to see Brazil striker Firmino dart onto the loose ball and chip Dortmund goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak. Borussia, who were missing captain Mats Hummels with a thigh injury, equalised when right-back Erik Durm put in a great cross and Aubameyang beat Hoffenheim centre-back Tobias Strobl to the ball to head home on 57 minutes. Both sides had their chances late on as Aubameyang and Subotic fired wide while Eugen Polanski forced Langerak into a diving save and Firmino drilled his shot just past the post. At the end of normal time, Dortmund's Jakub Blaszczykowski forced Hoffenheim goalkeeper Oliver Baumann into a diving save. Kehl's winner settled the matter in extra-time, but Hoffenheim captain Andreas Beck could have made it 3-3 when he headed over the bar with the 120 minutes up. Earlier, Wolfsburg took a step towards their first silverware since winning the 2009 Bundesliga title when a Ricardo Rodriguez penalty sealed their 1-0 quarter-final win at home to Freiburg."

Borussia's 1-0 league defeat at home to Bayern on Saturday left them tenth in the table and effectively ended their hopes of a fifth year in the Champions League next season. Jurgen Klopp's side are now 15 points from qualifying with a top four finish following a dire set of results earlier in the season which left them bottom of the Bundesliga in February. But the 2012 German Cup winners could yet claim a Europa League berth, either by winning this year's final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium or a top six finish in the Bundesliga table. ""The cup game is now very important for us. Going to Berlin is still a major goal for the season,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc. ""And although it is still far away, it is of course a way to get back into international competition."" Dortmund have to rediscover their scoring touch at home after failing to claim a single goal in any of their last three games at Borussia's Westfalenstadion in all competitions. ""We can give ourselves a big boost for the rest of the season with a good result and performance against Hoffenheim,"" said Germany midfielder Sven Bender. But Dortmund will need to improve on their Bayern defeat which left captain Mats Hummels ruing their ""inefficiency"" after failing to convert their 15 chances as Bayern's ex-Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowski headed the winner against his former club. Holders Bayern have fresh injury woes for the key tie of the round in Leverkusen with Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger the latest on their casualty list. An injury to his left ankle saw Germany's captain hobbled out of Saturday's 1-0 win at Dortmund. Bayern are already missing a trio of injured stars in David Alaba, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery. But Pep Guardiola's Bavarian giants welcomed back Spain midfielder Thiago Alcantara for the last 20 minutes in Dortmund after a year out with injury.

702,04/04/2015,20:39,Lewandowski seals Bayern win at Dortmund,Robert Lewandowski scored against his ex-club Borussia Dortmund on Saturday to seal Bayern Munich's 1-0 win which keeps them on course for a third Bundesliga title.,"Lewandowski's first-half header clinched Bayern's win which left them ten points clear at the top of the table with seven games left. In recent years, the tie has been dubbed Germany's 'Der Klassiker', but the defeat leaves last season's runners-up Dortmund tenth, but now 15 points from a Champions League place after poor results this season. Their victory merely underlines Bayern's domination in Germany and came without injured stars David Alaba, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery. The visitors took the lead when Thomas Mueller's shot rebounded off Roman Weidenfeller's foot and the Dortmund goalkeeper was powerless to prevent Lewandowski heading home on 36 minutes. Dortmund's best period was mid-way through the second half when Marco Reus fired wide as his side suffered their first league defeat since the start of February. Bayern's Spain midfielder Thiago Alcantara came on for his first appearance since March 2014 following back-to-back knee injuries, but Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger limped off with an ankle knock with 58 minutes gone. Munich's World Cup-winner Mario Goetze came on for the last ten minutes against his former club to a symphony of whistles at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. Earlier, Borussia Moenchengladbach and Bayer Leverkusen posted big wins as the battle for third-place intensified. The Bundesliga's top three qualify automatically for the Champions League. With seven games now left, third-placed Gladbach enjoyed an impressive 4-1 come-back win at Hoffenheim which keeps them two-points clear of Leverkusen, who posted a 4-0 win at home to over hapless Hamburg. Hosts Hoffenheim took the lead at home to Gladbach when forward Sven Schipplock enjoyed a simple tap-in on 17 minutes, but Gladbach proved their mettle with three goals in ten first-half minutes. First Germany striker Max Kruse drilled home a penalty, then Patrick Herrmann added a second before Brazilian striker Raffael scored on 36 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Herrmann then claimed his tenth goal of the season when he netted after a quick thrown on from Kruse with 51 minutes gone. Fourth-placed Leverkusen also underlined their Champions League pedigree by putting Hamburg to the sword. With the team third from bottom and on course for a first relegation from Germany's top flight, Hamburg sacked Joe Zinnbauer ten days ago, but his successor Peter Knaebel could only watch as his team was thrashed. Midfielder Gonzalo Castro gave Leverkusen the lead at the BayArena by firing into an empty net after Germany winger Karim Bellarabi had pulled the Hamburg defence apart with only seven minutes gone. A diving header from Leverkusen striker Stefan Kiessling just before half-time gave Roger Schmidt's Bayer a 2-0 half-time lead before Kiessling added their third after a goal-mouth scramble with the Hamburg defence pulled to pieces on 56 minutes. Just seven minutes later, Leverkusen added their fourth when Kiessling's pass found Bellarabi to lay the ball off for Castro, who hit the top corner and claimed his second of the game. Leverkusen host Bayern in the German Cup quarter-final on Wednesday. Second-placed Wolfsburg remain seven points clear of Gladbach with a 3-1 win at home to bottom VfB Stuttgart. Swiss midfielder Ricardo Rodriguez converted a penalty and a free-kick either side of half-time before ex-Chelsea winger Andre Schuerrle came off the bench to add their third. Freiburg find themselves three-points clear of the relegation zone after their 1-0 win at home to Cologne while Hanover dropped to just above the bottom three with a 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt. Hanover's Ivory Coast striker Didier Ya Konan rescued his team with a late equaliser, his first for the north German club since his six month sojourn at Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad Jeddah."

704,03/04/2015,02:20,Injury-hit Bayern head to resurgent Dortmund,Injury-hit Bayern Munich head to resurgent Borussia Dortmund on Saturday shorn of their top stars and with the hosts out to prove there is still life in Germany's 'Der Klassiker'.,"The Bundesliga has been won twice each by Dortmund and Bayern over the last four years and the media here has dubbed their meetings 'Der Klassiker' -- Germany's answer to Spain's 'El Clasico' between Barcelona and Real Madrid. But a glance at the Bundesliga table highlights Dortmund's dramatic fall from grace this season with Jurgen Klopp's side currently tenth having started February bottom of the table after a disastrous run of results. In contrast, Bayern are ten points clear in the league table and heading towards a third straight league title. But Pep Guardiola's Bavarians will be missing injured key stars Arjen Robben, David Alaba and Franck Ribery at the Signal Iduna Park. Defender Holger Badstuber is struggling with a hip injury, but veteran striker Claudio Pizarro is set to return from a leg injury. Bayern lost for the third time this season last time out going down 2-0 in Munich to Borussia Moenchengladbach, a fortnight ago. There is, however, no talk of an upset from the Dortmund camp. ""At the moment it's certainly not a top-of-the-table clash when you look at the table,"" admitted Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc. ""But it will still grab the attention of millions of fans across Germany."" With Germany winger Marco Reus in superb form for both club and country alongside top-scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Dortmund have the attack to cause Bayern problems. ""We have generally never given up on a home game in advance,"" said Klopp, who will be without Germany squad members Kevin Grosskreutz and Erik Durm. ""I would suggest we don't talk much and instead try to put in a good performance. ""We're not at the same level as Bayern and, unless I am mistaken, we never have been, but we have never considered ourselves to have no chance and that also goes for now."" With five wins and two draws in their last seven league games, Dortmund have pulled away from the Bundesliga's relegation zone. They are free to focus on their domestic form following their Champions League exit to Juventus in the last 16. Even missing Ribery, Alaba and Robben, Klopp expects Bayern to be dangerous. ""We still have to reckon with some top quality from Bayern, those boys can all play football,"" he said. ""But the fact is, Bayern will have to make a few changes without their three fastest players, which is what we have to be concerned about. ""You have to prepare yourself for how the opposition will line-up against you."" Without Robben, Bayern's top scorer this season with 17 goals in 21 games, Guardiola will be missing some pace on the flanks, especially on the left without wing-back Alaba and winger Ribery. ""It's bad news,"" said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm. ""They are really important for us. We mustn't complain, we need to look forward. ""We've got a big squad and have to compensate for losses like this."" Fixtures (all times 1330 GMT unless stated)"
705,31/03/2015,16:45,"It's Man Utd or no-one, says Hummels",Manchester United-target Mats Hummels has said if he ever transfers abroad it will only be to the Red Devils after telling Borussia Dortmund he is weighing up his future options.,"Borussia's captain, 26, has a Dortmund contract until 2017, but has long been courted by United, whose current manager Louis van Gaal is looking for a defensive leader with the English giants poised to table a bid, according to UK media reports. Germany centre-back Hummels told Monday's edition of German magazine Kicker that he ""often thinks about moving abroad"", but gave Tuesday's edition of German daily Bild a far stronger indication of his Manchester thoughts. ""If I was to transfer abroad at some stage, then it would only be to Manchester United,"" Hummels is reported to have said. Hummels agent, his father Hermann, is a friend of United boss Van Gaal from when they both worked at Bayern Munich, where Hummels senior was youth team co-ordinator until 2012, while Van Gaal was head coach from 2009 until 2011. Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke says the World Cup-winner has informed them he is weighing up his options. ""Mats had a conversation with (director of sport) Michael Zorc and myself two weeks ago, when he informed us that he is thinking about his future,"" said Watzke. ""That is completely legitimate. ""He has a contract until 2017 and we haven't received an offer, therefore we're pretty relaxed."" Dortmund have endured a poor season by their own high standards as the 2011 and 2012 German champions found themselves bottom of the table in February and are now up to mid-table in the Bundesliga."

""I have had a few conversations recently, which were very relevant for me to get a general overview, but I haven't made a decision about my future."" The 26-year-old Germany international has a Dortmund contract until 2017. But the World Cup-winner has long been courted by United, whose coach Louis van Gaal is seeking a defensive leader with the Premier League giants reported to be willing to meet Dortmund's 35 million euro (US$37.9m) price tag. ""I often think that I definitely want to move abroad, but then there are other days where I say I don't need it,"" added Hummels. ""Basically, I think a foreign move would be good both for both personal and footballing developement, so it could well transpire that I'd someday like to move abroad. ""It's definitely not the case that I am saying I will definitely go. ""When there is a decision from me in which direction things are heading, I'll talk about it openly. ""I'm not a fan of those who claim they are staying, but behind the scenes have already secretly settled the matter."" Dortmund host defending German champions Bayern Munich on Saturday and have moved up to mid-table in the Bundesliga after a disastrous set of results left them bottom of the league at the start of February. They have a 12-point gap to bridge if they are to qualify for the Champions League next season and are 31 points behind current leaders Bayern."
707,21/03/2015,20:18,Dortmund's Aubameyang eyes Europa League spot,Gabon winger Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang says Borussia Dortmund must target a European place for next season after their 3-2 Bundesliga win at ten-man Hanover 96 on Saturday.,"Dortmund picked up their first victory in four games after goalless draws with Cologne and Hamburg before Wednesday's 3-0 defeat at home to Juventus saw them bow out of the Champions League with a 5-1 aggregate defeat in the last 16. Aubameyang, Borussia's top scorer this season, netted twice to leave him with 12 goals in 25 league games and Germany winger Marco Reus created two, but Dortmund again showed defensive short-comings. The three points left Dortmund tenth in the league, just three points from a top six place, which carries a Europa League berth for next season, and 12 away from the top three which would mean an automatic Champions League place for the fifth season in succession. ""We're only a few points from sixth place now,"" Aubameyang told Sky Sports. ""We should be looking in the direction of a Europa League place now and we should stay optimistic."" Dortmund, the 2013 Champions League finalists, made life hard for themselves in Hanover as Aubameyang's opening goal was cancelled out by Lars Stindl's weak shot to equalise for the hosts. The home side were reduced to ten men when ex-Dortmund midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt was sent off for a second yellow card on 55 minutes. Aubameyang added his second and Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa scored his first Bundesliga goal since September to make it 3-1. But Borussia endured a nervous final ten minutes after Stindl curled in his second of the game to make it 3-2 on 82 minutes. ""We started well, but completely gave away the equaliser,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, whose side were bottom of the table at the start of February. ""We did really well after the second yellow card and anyone who looks at the table sees how important the win was.""

Dortmund bounced back from their 3-0 defeat at home to Juventus on Wednesday, which sealed a 5-1 aggregate defeat in the last 16, and two goalless draws in the Bundesliga as Gabon international Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice to leave him with 12 goals in 25 league games. Dortmund took the lead in Hanover after Germany winger Marco Reus's no-look pass split the defence and allowed Aubameyang to bury his shot in the 19th minute. The lead lasted just 12 minutes as ex-Dortmund midfielder Leon Bittencourt stole possession on the halfway line, and sprinted to the edge of the area where he fed Lars Stindl whose weak shot beat the Borussia defence. Dortmund rode their luck when captain Mats Hummels headed off the line early in the second half from Spanish striker Joselu just before the hosts were reduced to ten men. Bittencourt was sent off on 55 minutes for a foul on Dortmund veteran Sebastian Kehl just six minutes after fouling Jakub Blaszczykowski. Dortmund made the numerical advantage count almost immediately as Reus again provided the final pass for Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa to score their second on 57 minutes for his first league goal since September. Kagawa then set up Aubameyang for his second goal with a cross which saw the Gabon forward head home on 61 minutes. Hanover set up a nervous last ten minute when Stindl beat Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller to make it 3-2 with 82 minutes gone, but the win leaves Borussia tenth with Hanover 14th. Bremen stay ninth after being held to a 1-1 draw at mid-table Cologne as a first-half goal by Germany Under-29 striker Davie Selke for the visitors was cancelled out by an 88th-minute penalty from Cologne midfielder Matthias Lehmann. Freiburg climbed out of the bottom three with a 2-0 win at home to Augsburg thanks to second-half goals from Jonathan Schmid and Nils Petersen. Paderborn stay second-from-bottom after their goalless draw at home to ten-man Hoffenheim, who had Bosnia defender Ermin Bicakcic sent off for a second yellow card. VfB Stuttgart remain rooted to the foot of the table despite their 3-1 comeback win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. After Frankfurt midfielder Haris Seferovic gave his side a second-half lead Stuttgart striker Daniel Ginczek cancelled out the advantage by scoring twice in as many minutes. Romania midfielder Alexandru Maxim then added Stuttgart's third to seal their first home win since September. The result means just two points separate the bottom four teams of Stuttgart, Freiburg, Paderborn and Hamburg in Germany's top flight."
710,20/03/2015,02:30,"Bayern to welcome back Robben, Ribery for Gladbach",Bayern Munich hope to welcome back wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery for Sunday's clash at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach as they look to edge closer to the Bundesliga title.,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern start the weekend 11 points clear and could still break last season's record when they claimed the title with seven games to spare. The Allianz Arena clash sees the runaway leaders host third-placed Gladbach, but Lucien Favre's Borussia are already a staggering 20 points adrift of Guardiola's Bavarians. With 17 league goals in 20 games this season, Robben is battling Frankfurt's Alex Meier to become the Bundesliga's top scorer but the flying Dutchman is battling to overcome a trapped nerve that saw him miss last Saturday's 4-0 rout of Werder Bremen. Robben took part in training this week, as did left winger Franck Ribery, who also sat out the Bremen victory with an ankle injury. However, with Poland striker Robert Lewandowski pillaging six goals in his last five league games and on 13 for the season, the champions would still have plenty of firepower without the pair. Bayern will be without suspended centre-back Medhi Benatia, whose yellow card at Bremen was his fifth of the season, carrying with it an automatic suspension. Bayern captain Philipp Lahm is set for another place on the bench having made his return from injury at Bremen. Gladbach face an uphill task to take points off their hosts with Bayern unbeaten at home this season after 11 wins and a draw. Fresh from their midweek Champions League exit, tenth-placed Borussia Dortmund are hunting their first win in four games when they travel to Hanover 96, who are 13th. Germany defender Marcel Schmelzer is an injury doubt having picked up a knock in their 3-0 last 16 defeat to Juventus, which sealed a 5-1 aggregate defeat, but defensive midfielder Nuri Sahin is definitely out with a leg injury. ""Our main priority is the league now, although that doesn't mean that we don't want to progress in the German Cup,"" said Borussia coach Jurgen Klopp. His side have improved in the league since the turn of the year having started February bottom of the table following a dire set of results. Hanover coach Tayfun Korkut is under pressure as his side have won just one of their last 10 games. Fifth-placed Schalke have a chance to improve their Champions League chances for next season when they host fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday night with just three points separating the teams. ""I think you can describe this game as a 'six-pointer',"" said Schalke coach Roberto di Matteo. ""We're playing at home and are confident of getting a good result."" The 44-year-old is set to keep teenage goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther between the posts with first-choice stopper Ralf Faehrmann working his way back from injury after picking up a cruciate knee ligament strain in January. Both teams exited the Champions League at the last 16 stage with Schalke going out 5-4 to Real Madrid on aggregate despite a stunning 4-3 win in Spain just over ten days ago. Bayer are still licking their wounds after bowing out on a penalty shoot-out at Atletico Madrid on Tuesday despite winning the first leg in Leverkusen.

711,19/03/2015,02:30,Hummels vows Dortmund will rise again,Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels insists his side would soon return to the Champions League after exiting Europe with an emphatic 3-0 defeat at home to Juventus.,"A brace from Carlos Tevez and an Alvaro Morata tap-in at Dortmund on Wednesday put Juve into the quarter-finals and sealed a 5-1 win on aggregate in the last 16 tie. Tevez blasted home a third-minute thunderbolt when he was left unmarked on the edge of the area which gave Dortmund a mountain to climb virtually from the kick-off. With Dortmund currently 10th in the league, they also face an uphill battle to finish in the top four and qualify for next season's Champions League, but Hummels says Borussia will be back. ""It would be a shame if this is our last Champions League for a while, but we have shown in the past that Borussia Dortmund always comes back and hopefully that will apply to the Champions League too,"" said the 26-year-old. ""We were okay in the first half, but we gave away too many balls and we gave away the result, as much as it hurts, it has to be accepted. ""The early goal we conceded was a shock. You can't deny that. For almost the entire match we failed to create any noteworthy chances."" Hummels gestured to home fans to stop booing and jeering after the final whistle which the Germany defender said his side did not deserve having won their group ahead of Arsenal. A dire set of results saw Dortmund go bottom of the Bundesliga at the start of February, but Hummels defended their European record after reaching the knock-out stages for the last three seasons. ""I can understand the fans whistling when we have played so badly in the Bundesliga, but we have always done well in the Champions League and I felt that was uncalled for,"" he said."

Tevez weighed in goals either side of Morata's second-half effort. Just as he had done in Turin, the 31-year-old Tevez gave his side an early lead with a breath-taking strike to catch out the Dortmund defence. The Argentinian then beat Dortmund's off-side trap with 20 minutes left to give Morata a simple tap-in to put the Old Lady in the last eight. Tevez added his second and Juve's third nine minutes later when he took Arturo Vidal's pass and fired home to break Borussia hearts. Massimiliano Allegri's Juventus simply had too much experience for a Dortmund side struggling with confidence issues after a dire start to their Bundesliga season which had left them bottom of the table in February. Juventus also maintained their impressive record at Dortmund with their fourth straight win at Borussia's Westfalenstadion to go into Friday's draw. Dortmund, the 2013 finalists, join Schalke and Bayer Leverkusen in exiting the Champions League at the last 16 phase leaving Bayern Munich as Germany's sole representative in the quarter-finals. Dortmund's task became that much harder with just three minutes gone when Tevez launched a fierce strike off his right foot unmarked from 30 metres out. It powered past goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller and left Dortmund needing to score at least twice. With 15 minutes gone, defender Stephan Lichtsteiner forced Weidenfeller into another save as the Italian league leaders kept up the early pressure. Allegri was forced into an early change on 27 minutes when defensive midfielder Paul Pogba came off clutching his hamstring made way for Italy's Andrea Barzagli. Dortmund chased the game and dominated possession, but Juve stood deep frustrating the hosts' constant attacks as it remained 1-0 at the break. Borussia boss Jurgen Klopp brought on Oliver Kirch for injured left-back Marcel Schmelzer at the start of the second half. Only a good save from Weidenfeller on 50 minutes stopped Juve going 2-0 up when Tevez charged through the Dortmund defence, but the Borussia goalkeeper blocked Morata's shot. Just six minutes later Weidenfeller denied Morata again as the Spanish forward threatened to add to his first-leg winning goal. It finally came on 70 minutes when Tevez sprinted onto a ball over the Dortmund defence, drew Weidenfeller and unselfishly squared for Morata. Tevez put the result beyond doubt when he added his sixth Champions League goal of the campaign 11 minutes from time with another strike which gave Weidenfeller no chance."

""Both of them will return at the end of the season, that's how things stand,"" Zorc told German magazine Sport Bild. Zorc also believes Dortmund are moving closer to extending the contract of Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, whose contract expires in June 2016. ""Let me put it in sober terms, I believe that both for him and us a contract extension would make sense,"" Zorc told German daily Bild. The club are hoping Gundogan will follow the lead of Germany team-mate Marco Reus who extended his Borussia stay until 2019 by signing a new deal last month. Dortmund are tenth in the Bundesliga and host Italian champions Juventus on Wednesday in the last 16 of the Champions League, looking to overturn a 2-1 defeat from the first leg in Turin last month."

The 47-year-old Allegri says his side's hopes of reaching the quarter-finals hinge on containing Reus and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who have been in rich goal-scoring form in recent weeks. ""It will be a great game and I honestly can't see it ending 0-0. I think we'll need to score at least once to go through,"" said Allegri, who will be without injured playmaker Andrea Pirlo. ""In the first leg we didn't allow them a shot on goal, Dortmund only scored from our mistake. ""Dortmund have plenty of pace in their ranks. We must put in a good technical performance and strike their weak areas."" Allegri admits he is pondering a possible 4-3-1-2 line-up or a 3-5-2 formation which would see Patrice Evra, Paul Pogba, Claudio Marchisio, Arturo Vidal and Stephan Lichtsteiner crowd the midfield. Juventus received a boost on Saturday when defender Andrea Barzagli made his first start, in the league win against Palermo, after a long injury lay-off. ""I still have some doubts over the starting team and need to decide whether we play three or four at the back,"" said Allegri. Juve's veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon says he is relishing the chance to play at Dortmund's 80,000-capacity Westfalenstadion stadium. ""The fans here? It's fervent from start to finish. It can be a real boost for the hosts but can also motivate the visitors,"" said the 37-year-old. ""It's always a pleasure to come back to the Westfalenstadion. Matches here are never trivial."""
715,17/03/2015,02:11,Klopp confident Dortmund can end Juventus home jinx,Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp is confident his side can reach the Champions League quarter-finals and in the process record their first ever home win over Italian opponents Juventus on Wednesday.,"Dortmund, who beat Juventus to secure their sole Champions League trophy in 1997 in Munich, trail 2-1 after the first leg but Klopp is upbeat about them avoiding the fates of their predecessors on the three previous occasions they have hosted the Italian champions and lost. Klopp's side have taken 14 points from a possible 18 in the league recently, but have been held to goalless draws in both of their last two games, latterly Saturday's home match with Cologne. ""One should not see this result too negatively,"" said Klopp. ""The only good thing from the Cologne result was that we saw what didn't work. ""We can do better, we have already shown that. ""The aim remains to reach the Champions League's quarter-finals and the boys can do it."" Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri is waiting on his playmaker Andrea Pirlo, who is rated as doubtful with a calf injury, which forced him off in the first-half of the first leg clash. Allegri is set to use a 3-5-2 formation with Patrice Evra, Paul Pogba, Claudio Marchisio, Arturo Vidal and Stephan Lichtsteiner in defence. Juventus received a boost on Saturday when defender Andrea Barzagli made his first start, in the win against Palermo, after a long injury lay-off. Juventus are looking to reach the quarter-finals for only the second time since 2006, exiting at the last eight stage in the 2012/2013 campaign at the hands of Bayern Munich, who went on to beat Dortmund in the final. But Juve have a strong record over two legs against German opposition and have won 12 of their 15 European matches with three defeats. They will look to the experience of Argentinian striker Carlos Tevez to get them across the line. The Argentinian scored three of Juventus' seven goals in the group stage. Similarly Klopp will need his attacking duo of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Marco Reus, who scored Dortmund's goal in Turin, firing on all cylinders. Aubameyang has scored five goals in his last seven matches, while Reus has shown superb form since recovering from two ankle injuries before Christmas. Robert Lewandowski's departure for Bayern Munich last season left some big shoes to fill in the striking department at Dortmund. While he has failed to make a mark in the Bundesliga, Italy striker Ciro Immobile has been a different player in the Champions League, scoring four times in five group stage matches. Borussia defender Matthias Ginter is doubtful with a thigh injury, while defensive midfielder Nuri Sahin faces a race against time to shake off a groin problem."
716,14/03/2015,17:51,Bayern cap perfect week with Bremen bashing,Bayern Munich put the finishing touches on a perfect week's work as they defeated Werder Bremen 4-0 on Saturday to extend their lead at the top of the Bundesliga to 14 points.,"Pep Guardiola's side made it three wins in seven days, scoring 14 goals and conceding just one, as they not only padded their lead in the domestic flight but also qualified for the Champions League quarter-finals. German international striker Thomas Mueller grabbed his fourth goal of the week with a left foot shot past Raphael Wolf to put the champions 1-0 in front on 24 minutes at the Weser-Stadion. Austrian defender David Alaba then scored his second league goal of the season to cushion the advantage. Polish international Robert Lewandowski added the gloss with two late goals to round out the scoring. While Bremen, who came into the weekend five points behind the European places, toiled bravely they were unable to breach the goalline of Pepe Reina, who was standing in for first-choice 'keeper Manuel Neuer. The absence of Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, who picked up knocks during the 7-0 rout of Shakhtar Donetsk in teh Champions League on Wednesday, had little effect as Bayern picked up their 20th victory in 25 league outings against just one defeat. Elsewhere, Eintracht Frankfurt consolidated their place in the upper half of the table with a routine 4-0 win over third-from-bottom Paderborn. Alexander Meier got the home side on track with a goal after 27 minutes before Marc Stendera, Stefan Aigner and Nelson Haedo Valdez also got on the scoresheet in a feisty afternoon encounter that featured eight yellow cards. Mainz picked up a crucial 2-0 victory over Augsburg, thanks to a dinstinctive Asian flavour, as they eased their relegation fears. Shinji Okazaki added to his record as the highest Japanese scorer in Bundesliga history, with the opener on 32 minutes, before former South Korea captain Koo Ja-cheol guaranteed the points in the final minute. Hertha Berlin missed the chance for three valuable points as they were deprived victory in the final minute by a Joel Matip equaliser for Schalke. A see-saw match finished 2-2 in the capital. Eugen Polankski struck either side of half-time for Hoffenheim as they boosted their European ambitions for next season with a 3-0 home win over 10-man Hamburg. Jaroslav Drobny conceded the penalty that led to a straight red card and Polanski's opener before the 28-year-old Polish midfielder helped seal the win with his second eight minutes from time. Sebastian Rudy added a third to the delight of the home fans in the dying minutes. On Friday, Bayer Leverkusen cantered to a 4-0 win over Stuttgart and climbed to third place ahead of idle Borussia Moenchengladbach. In the final match on Saturday, resurgent Borussia Dortmund are at home to Cologne, ahead of their Champions League tie against Juventus on Wednesday, while on Sunday, Europa League hopefuls Wolfsburg await second-from-bottom Freiburg. Finally, Moenchengladbach host Hanover in the ultimate match of the weekend."
717,13/03/2015,02:23,Allegri set to rest stars as Borussia test looms,Juventus visit Palermo on Saturday looking to reinforce their sizeable Serie A lead but with one eye firmly on booking their ticket for the Champions League quarter-finals.,"A late strike by Paul Pogba secured a hard-fought victory for the Italian champions over Sassuolo last week and helped Juventus stretch their lead on Roma to 11 points as Rudi Garcia's men remain stuck in a rut of consecutive draws. With one hand seemingly on their fourth consecutive scudetto, the focus now for Massimiano Allegri's side is on reaching the last eight in Europe's premier club competition. Juve meet Borussia Dortmund at the BVB Stadion next week looking to build on their 2-1 first leg last 16 victory in Turin as they bid to reach the last eight for the first time in two years. Although Palermo are a tough nut to crack at home -- their only defeat was a resounding 4-0 reverse to Lazio last September -- Allegri is expected to keep some legs fresh for Wednesday. Argentinian striker Carlos Tevez has rarely been left on the bench but Fernando Llorente and Alvaro Morata are both in fine fettle and Frenchman Kingsley Coman is back in the frame after an injury knock last week. Although Pogba will miss out through suspension, Juve's defence has been given a boost by the return of Andrea Barzagli following an eight-month injury lay-off. Barzagli made a cameo appearance in last week's win over Sassuolo and is hoping to work his way back in time for the trip to Dortmund: ""We have to be positive, there's everything to play for and we're going there (Dortmund) with a small advantage."" Last week's stalemate at Chievo was Roma's eighth draw in nine league games and Sampdoria, 2-0 winners over Cagliari last week when Samuel Eto'o hit his maiden goal for the club, will have no fear at the Stadio Olimpico. The contrast at both clubs could not be any more stark. Coachi Sinisa Mihajlovic is on a high having buried the hatchet with Eto'o after a difficult start to their rapport, while Garcia is trying to rebuild confidence amid his side's remarkable dip in form. ""I don't like to single anyone out but I'm happy with Eto'o because he's on his way back,"" said Mihajlovic. ""He's been a great player and he's someone who can always make a difference."" Garcia is under scrutiny, with fans now fearing being overtaken by city rivals Lazio as well as Napoli -- both of whom sit just four points adrift of Roma. ""It wouldn't be hard for us to play better than we did last Sunday,"" Garcia said ironically on Wednesday, a day ahead of a 1-1 Europa League last 16 first leg draw at Fiorentina. Lazio detractors claim their resurgence is down to their absence from European competition, but while a credible theory Stefano Pioli's men are still playing arguably the best football in Serie A. The Biancocelesti ripped an evidently fatigued Fiorentina apart in a 4-0 win last week that highlighted the threat of wide men Antonio Candreva and Felipe Anderson -- as well as Lazio's aims for a second-place finish. With the league's second best attack (47 goals) and third-best defence (27), Lazio travel to Torino in confidence on Sunday hoping to hand the Granata their second setback of the week following Thursday's 2-0 Europa League defeat at Zenit. Napoli, without a league win in two games, should be brimming with confidence when they travel to Verona on Sunday days after a 3-1 Europa League win to Dynamo Moscow thanks to a Gonzalo Higuain hat-trick. Inter Milan and city rivals AC Milan, meanwhile, continue their respective bids to close the gap to the European qualification places. Inter host struggling Cesena three days after a 3-1 defeat to Europa League last 16 opponents Wolfsburg while Milan travel to Fiorentina looking for only their third away win of the season."
718,04/03/2015,20:15,Reus' injury scare leaves Dortmund's Klopp fuming,"Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus is set to be fit for their forthcoming Champions League clash against Juventus, but his German Cup injury scare still left coach Jurgen Klopp fuming.","The 25-year-old Reus, who has already had two long lay-offs with ankle injuries this season, had to be helped off after only 25 minutes of Dortmund's 2-0 third-round win at Dynamo Dresden on Tuesday. An examination revealed Reus has suffered no more than a bruised knee following a tackle from Dresden's Dennis Erdmann and is set to face Juventus on March 18 in the last 16 clash with Borussia having lost the first leg 2-1 in Turin. But Dortmund coach Kloppp admitted he was annoyed with his medical staff immediately after Reus went down with his star player lying prostrate on the pitch. ""I looked so angry because everybody looked at me like he had a broken leg. I am a simple person and if everyone looks at me like his leg is broken, then I believe that,"" he told Sky Sports. ""I hope next time they will inform me sooner when it is just a bruise."" And the Reus injury has sparked a war of words between Dresden and Dortmund after Erdmann suggested the Germany star had exaggerated his injury. ""He (Reus) ran into my knee. I used to play in the regional league and when you'd get a knock, you'd give it a rub and play on. I don't think it's like that in the Bundesliga business,"" said the defender. But Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc slammed Erdmann for his comments. ""His statements are an outrage. He kicked him (Reus) off the pitch even though the ball was nowhere near him,"" said Zorc. ""Such things shouldn't happen on a football pitch, not even in regional football."" Dortmund's Italy striker Ciro Immobile, who scored both Dortmund's goals, had a marked face after the win which Borussia's director of sport insists came from an early tussle with Erdmann. ""There are matches where the fight is in the foreground. I have nothing against healthy, hard competition, but we need to make sure our creative players are better protected,"" said Zorc."
719,03/03/2015,22:48,Immobile eases Dortmund into cup quarters,Borussia Dortmund eased to a 2-0 victory at third-division Dynamo Dresden on Tuesday to book their place in the German Cup quarter-finals thank to Ciro Immobile's second-half goals.,"The Italy striker pounced on a mistake by Dresden captain Michael Hefele to give Dortmund a 50th-minute lead and lit up a dull third-round tie to put the 2012 cup winners into the last eight. Immobile then added Dortmund's second when he fired home a superb cross from Poland winger Jakub Blaszczykowski on 90 minutes. ""These are tough games, in which the opponents fight until they fall, in a great atmosphere,"" said Immobile. ""It was important for me to score and help the side try and get to the Berlin final."" Having failed to make his mark in the Bundesliga this season since joining from Turin, Immobile is turning into Dortmund's European and Cup king having netted four goals in six Champions League games with three in two Cup matches. With the win coming on the back of four straight Bundesliga wins, the only bad news for Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp was the injury to Germany winger Marco Reus, who had to be helped off in the first-half. This was a more peaceful affair after rioting blighted the 2011 cup meeting between the two sides in Dortmund before Dresden were thrown out of the competition all together last season due to more trouble at Hanover 96 in October 2013. Holders Bayern Munich host second division strugglers Eintracht Braunschweig on Wednesday while fellow Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen needed extra-time at home to claim a 2-0 win over second-division Kiessling. After a goalless first 90 minutes, Bayer pulled ahead when Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu curled home a free-kick in the 102nd minute before Germany striker Stefan Kiessling added their second in the 114th minute. Bundesliga side Hofffenheim enjoyed a 2-0 win at second-division VfR Aalen from Baden-Wuerttemberg. In the round's only all-Bundesliga tie, Freiburg ran out 2-1 winners at home to Cologne as Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah's own goal gave the hosts an early lead before Czech midfielder Vladimir Darida added a second on 19 minutes. Darida had a 65th-minute penalty shot saved which would have sealed the game before Brazil striker Deyverson scored his first goal for Cologne a minute from time to give the visitors some consolation."
720,03/03/2015,15:38,Champions League spot doesn't interest Klopp,Jurgen Klopp says he has little interest in Champions League qualification for next season as he fights to keep Dortmund in the Bundesliga.,"Having started February bottom of the German league table, four straight wins have catapulted the 2013 Champions League finalists Dortmund up to tenth in the table. They are just six points from a Champions League place for next season, but Klopp is more concerned about the five-point gap which keeps them away from the bottom three. ""As things stand, we have absolutely nothing to do with the international places, they really don't interest me,"" said Klopp. ""We need to focus on the essentials (staying in the Bundesliga)."" Dortmund beat Schalke 3-0 on Saturday to win the Ruhr Valley derby at home, which had a double advantage. ""We have killed two birds with one stone, we have managed to get 28 important points and won the derby,"" he said. Klopp's side can strengthen their league position in the coming weeks with an away match at strugglers Hamburg before they host Cologne. Despite their Bundesliga struggles Dortmund cruised through the Champions League group phase and host Italians Juventus in the last 16, second-leg clash, in a fortnight after losing the first-leg 2-1 in Italy."
721,28/02/2015,20:34,Dortmund's dynamic duo happy to slay Schalke,Dynamic goal-scoring duo Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Marco Reus celebrated Borussia Dortmund's 3-0 win over Schalke 04 in 'Batman' style to continue their side's rise up the table.,"Hosts Dortmund hammered the visitors defence as Reus and Aubameyang contributed half of their side's 31 shots on goal, compared to Schalke's meagre three chances. It was Dortmund's biggest derby win since 1998. Borussia got the breakthrough when Aubameyang -- who had compared winning the derby to 'an orgasm' -- pounced on a mistake in the visitors' defence to roll the ball home on 78 minutes. The 25-year-old celebrated by donning a 'Batman' hat, playing up to his 'caped crusader' nickname, with Reus wearing a 'Robin' mask as his side-kick. Henrikh Mkhitaryan made it 2-0 when he netted 108 seconds after Aubameyang before Reus robbed Schalke goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther to claim their third on 86 minutes. ""If you didn't know who Batman and Robin before, you do now,"" joked Aubameyang. It emerged Aubameyang's translator Massimo Mariotti had hidden the costumes behind the Schalke goal. Reus looked slightly sheepish when asked who had the idea. ""In the first half of the season we didn't have so much fun and we came up with it a few days ago while we were eating together,"" said the Germany winger. ""That was the game of the year, you can't have a better feeling during the season."" The victory lifts Dortmund to tenth in the table after picking up their fourth consecutive league win having started February bottom of the table. A big part of Dortmund's revival has been down to both Aubameyang, who has scored five goals in his last four league games, and Reus' prowess in front of goal. Dortmund-born Reus has scored in all five matches, including the 2-1 Champions League defeat at Juventus on Tuesday, since announcing he has extended his Borussia contract until 2019. But he balked when asked about Dortmund's challenge for a European place as they now find themselves eight points from a Champions League place for next season. ""Four weeks ago we were standing here talking about the relegation battle,"" said Reus. ""We'll take this one game at a time, at the moment things look good but we have tough games ahead and there is still a long way to go."" Delighted Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp singled out attacking midfielder Mkhitaryan for praise. ""That was a fantastic afternoon for us. We worked hard for a deserved result,"" said Klopp. ""The best celebration was for Mkhitaryan. ""Everyone wanted to jump on top of him when he scored, he had an unbelievable game. ""That was the best game he has played so far for Borussia Dortmund."" But Klopp was keen to point out that his team is still only five points from the relegation battle despite their up-turn in fortunes. ""We're only five points away, nothing has really changed,"" said Klopp. ""But we are on a good path and we'll continue on it."" Schalke coach Roberto Di Matteo apologised for his side's poor performance. ""It is a very difficult day for all of us,"" said the ex-Chelsea boss after losing his first derby since taking charge in October. ""We want to apologise to our fans for a poor display, we had planned things differently. ""We did well for the first 10 minutes, then we couldn't get the game under control."""

After wasted a string of chances, Dortmund got the breakthrough when Aubameyang -- who had compared winning the derby to 'an orgasm' in midweek -- pounced on a mistake in the visitors' defence to roll the ball home on 78 minutes. It was his fifth goal in as many league games and the 25-year-old celebrated by donning a 'Batman' hat, playing up to his 'caped crusader' nickname. His team-mate Marco Reus wore a 'Robin' mask to play his side-kick. ""If you didn't know who Batman and Robin were before, you do now,"" joked Aubameyang. It emerged Aubameyang's translator Massimo Mariotti had hidden the costumes behind the Schalke goal. Henrikh Mkhitaryan made it 2-0 just over a minute after Aubameyang's goal when he slid home Ilkay Gundogan's cross to claim his first goal of the season. Reus, who had crashed a shot against the crossbar, fired wide and had a shot blocked in the first half, finally got on the scoresheet by poaching Borussia's third on 86 minutes to score for the fifth match running in all competitions. Schalke's 19-year-old goalkeeper Timon Wellenreuther paused too long over a back-pass and Reus simply tapped the ball into the empty net behind the despairing teenager. ""That was the game of the year, you can't have a better feeling during the season,"" said Reus. The defeat drops Schalke, who were missing several stars with injury, to fifth while neighbours Dortmund are now just eight points adrift of a Champions League place for next season. ""That was a fantastic afternoon for us. We worked hard for a deserved result,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""That was a perfect game from my team from the first to the last minute."" Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen built on their shock Champions League win over Atletico Madrid on Wednesday with a 1-0 win at home to strugglers Freiburg to go fourth. Veteran midfielder Simon Rolfes, who will retire at the end of the season, grabbed a first-half winner to give Leverkusen their first league win in four games. Augsburg dropped to sixth after their 1-0 defeat at Hertha Berlin as ex-Chelsea striker Salomon Kalou scored a late winner at the Olympic Stadium to claim his sixth goal of the season. Stuttgart stay bottom after their 1-1 draw at Hanover 96 while Hoffenheim are just two points short of the European places for next season after their 2-0 win at home to Mainz. On Friday, Bayern Munich celebrated their 115th birthday with a 4-1 win over Cologne to go 11 points clear before second-placed Wolfsburg go to resurgent Werder Bremen on Sunday. Arjen Robben netted his 17th goal in 19 league matches this season with a crisp header with 20 minutes left to remain the league's top scorer. Earlier, captain Bastian Schweinsteiger gave hosts Bayern an early lead at the Allianz Arena before Franck Ribery added a second inside 10 minutes. Cologne fought back when Nigeria international Anthony Ujah scored right on the stroke of half-time but Bayern roared back as Robben then Poland striker Robert Lewandowski extended their lead."

""When you see the blue and white shirts, you now it's going to be a red-hot battle until you drop. Losing is forbidden,"" Dortmund-born Reus, who last week extended his Borussia contract until 2019, told Bundesliga.de. ""It's a derby you always look forward to, especially when you're playing at home. ""For the city, the club and the fans, it's extremely important to give everything to have to get the win."" Dortmund face the Royal Blues of Schalke at their 80,000-capacity Westfalenstadion ground with the hosts looking to avenge their 2-1 defeat in Gelsenkirchen last September. Three straight league wins have seen Dortmund climb to 12th from bottom of the Bundesliga while Schalke are fourth in the table. Borussia's top-scorer Aubameyang raised eye-brows earlier this week by insisting winning the derby had an erotic factor. ""I love games like this. Derby wins - even if it sounds strange - are almost like an orgasm. In all honesty, it is a similar feeling,"" the fleet-footed winger who has scored four goals in his last four games told magazine Sport Bild. Schalke hope to include Klaas-Jan Huntelaar for Saturday after the Dutch striker returned to training on Monday having bruised his shin in last week's 2-0 Champions League defeat against Real Madrid. Dortmund will definitely be without defender Lukasz Piszczek for the next six weeks after the left-back tore ankle ligaments in Borussia's 2-1 defeat at Juventus on Tuesday. Greece centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos faces a race against time with a groin injury, but both defender Neven Subotic and winger Kevin Kampla are set to return after recovering from an upset stomach."
725,25/02/2015,18:28,Derby wins are like an 'orgasm' for Aubameyang,Borussia Dortmund host arch-rivals and neighbours Schalke 04 on Saturday with Gabon winger Pierre Emerick Aubameyang insisting winning the Ruhr Valley derby is like an 'orgasm'.,"The showdown at Dortmund's sold-out 80,000 capacity Westfalenstadion is Germany's top derby and a victory will put the winning team's fans in seventh heaven, but Aubameyang took the comparison a step further. ""I love games like this. Derby wins - even if it sounds strange - are almost like an orgasm. In all honesty, it is a similar feeling,"" the fleet-footed winger told magazine Sport Bild. Having won their last three German league matches to climb from last place to 12th in the table, Aubameyang is particularly relishing the chance to continue the climb by taking fourth-placed Schalke's scalp. ""Our first concern is staying up, but we can collect some more self-confidence with a derby win,"" said Dortmund's top-scorer, who has hit four goals in his last three games. ""We can also give our fans, who stood behind us in the miserable first-half of the season, something back."" Schalke are set to welcome back Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar from suspension while Dortmund are chasing revenge for their 2-1 defeat in Gelsenkirchen last September.

726,25/02/2015,02:10,Juve face intense return in Dortmund: Morata,"Juventus will have to be at their best if they are to overcome Borussia Dortmund in the second leg of their Champions League last 16 tie to qualify for the quarter-finals, Alvaro Morata said Tuesday.","Spanish striker Morata hit his maiden Champions League goal for the Italian champions to seal a 2-1 first leg win in a thrilling encounter in Turin, where Dortmund winger Marco Reus took advantage of a defensive howler to level five minutes after Carlos Tevez's 13th minute opener. Juventus, who lost Andrea Pirlo to a suspected hamstring injury, were much improved in the second half as Dortmund's first-half efforts at keeping a rein on Juve's creative midfielders began to tell. Yet Massimiliano Allegri's side went on to spurn several chances to extend their advantage after the restart, leaving Dortmund -- beaten finalists two years ago -- with a solid chance of progressing to the last eight. The sides meet at the BVB Stadion on March 18 and Morata admitted: ""It will be an intense atmosphere, we will have to be at our best but we'll be going there with qualification on our minds."" Former Real Madrid striker Morata added: ""It's the best game I've played since I've been at Juventus, we did well. But it was a difficult game, Dortmund are a srong side despite the fact they're having some difficulties in the league."" Allegri had warned of the threat of Dortmund's potent counter-attack, but it was from such a move that Tevez broke the deadlock when he bundled the rebound from Morata's drive across goal past outstretched 'keeper Roman Weidenfeller. Juventus looked to be in their stride but their joy was ended minutes later following a howler by Giorgio Chiellini. The central defender slipped on the edge of the area, missed the ball completely and clattered into Leonardo Bonucci, allowing Reus to waltz in and collect before picking his spot against a rooted Gianluigi Buffon. The reality of Dortmund's away-goal leveller appeared to take hold. While Juve looked out of sorts for long spells in the opening half, Borussia moved the ball around with ease, albeit without really threatening Buffon. Allegri admitted: ""We definitely struggled a little in the first half, when they closed down a lot of our passes."" On 33 minutes midfielder Nuri Sahin had time to unleash a long-range effort that swerved late before Buffon parried with both hands, but Juve took the lead against the run of play just before the interval. Tevez collected a long ball from his own half and set up Paul Pogba on the left for the Frenchman to deliver a low cross which Morata glanced inside Weidenfeller's far post with the inside of his boot. Juve resumed in positive fashion but spurned several clear chances to put the result beyond doubt. After ballooning over from 10 yards out, Tevez edged closer when he fired a low drive amid a rabble of players which crept inches wide of the upright. Dortmund saw a rare chance go amiss when Immobile fired a yard over Buffon's crossbar from 20 metres. Tevez was sent through on the right to force Weidenfeller into action and from the corner Chiellini was allowed to rise above Aubameyang to fire a powerful header just over. Five minutes from full time Roberto Pereyra, who had replaced Pirlo on 37 minutes, missed a great chance when he was sent through by Tevez only for his angled low drive to sneaked just past the far post. It was a game of two halves for the Bundesliga strugglers, and left coach Jurgen Klopp visibly frustrated. Asked if he was angry, he said: ""Yes... it was a fair result and Juventus deserved the win. ""Particularly in the second half Juventus created a lot of chances that they didn't put away and we didn't create the chances we should have. ""They were good at closing us down and not allowing us to play our kind of game. On the goals we conceded, it was down to errors of positioning. ""These are problems we have to rectify but nothing has been lost. There's still everything to play for at Dortmund."
727,24/02/2015,23:01,"Tevez, Morata strike as Juve battle past Dortmund",Carlos Tevez and Alvaro Morata struck for Juventus as the Italian champions secured a 2-1 Champions League last 16 first leg win over Borussia Dortmund in Turin on Tuesday.,"However, Massimiliano Allegri's hosts were left lamenting a host of missed chances and conceding an away goal that could prove costly heading towards the decisive second leg on March 18. Juventus coach Allegri had warned of the threat of Dortmund's potent counter-attack, but it was from such a move that Tevez broke the deadlock on 13 minutes. The ball was fed out to Morata, who controlled well before launching a run down the left flank and firing in a shot which 'keeper Roman Weidenfeller pushed into the path of Tevez for the Argentinian to bundle over from a yard out. Juventus looked to be in their stride but the hosts' joy was ended minutes later following a howler by Giorgio Chiellini. The central defender slipped on the edge of the area, missed the ball completely and clattered into Leonardo Bonucci. Marco Reus waltzed in to collect and had enough time to pick his spot against a rooted Gianluigi Buffon before levelling on 18 minutes. Juventus tried to hit back, Tevez cutting back for Morata at the byeline only for the Spaniard's header to spin wide of Weidenfeller's upright. But the reality of Dortmund's away-goal leveller appeared to take hold. Juve looked out of sorts for long spells in the opening half as Borussia moved the ball around with ease, albeit without capitalising. On 33 minutes midfielder Nuri Sahin had time to unleash a long-range effort that swerved late before Buffon parried with both hands. Pogba looked far from his sparkling best and to make matters worse, Juve lost influential midfielder Andrea Pirlo on 37 minutes after he pulled up with a suspected hamstring strain. Yet Juve took the lead against the run of play just before the interval. Tevez collected a long ball from his own half and set up Pogba on the left for the Frenchman to deliver a low cross which Morata glanced inside Weidenfeller's far post with the inside of his boot. Juve resumed in positive fashion but spurned several clear chances to put the result beyond doubt. Bonucci narrowly failed to make contact with a corner swung in from the left after it bounced off Weidenfeller, while at the other end former Torino striker Ciro Immobile saw his angled drive held by Buffon as the visitors enjoyed possession. Juve spurned a great chance just before the hour when Dortmund skipper Mats Hummels lost possession to Tevez in midfield but Pogba wasted the opportunity in the area after collecting Morata's long ball from the right. A probing cross by Stephan Lichsteiner was then headed on by Morata into path of Tevez, who ballooned over from 10 yards out. The Argentinian edged closer when he fired a low drive amid a rabble of players on the edge of the area which crept inches wide of the upright. Dortmund saw a rare chance go amiss when Immobile fired a yard over Buffon's crossbar from 20 metres. He was replaced moments later by Jakub Blaszczykowski, prompting a tactical switch which saw Aubameyang move into the striker's role. But Juve continued to dominate. Tevez was sent through on the right to force Weidenfeller into action and from the corner Chiellini was allowed to rise above Aubameyang to fire a powerful header just over. Five minutes from full time Roberto Pereyra, who had replaced Pirlo, missed a great chance when he was sent through by Tevez only for his angled low drive to sneaked just past the far post."

730,23/02/2015,13:44,Reus factor lifts Dortmund for Juventus clash,"Marco Reus' decision to commit to Borussia Dortmund was a catalyst to reviving the Bundesliga strugglers' form ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash at Juventus, according to defender Neven Subotic.","Serie A leaders Juventus are clear favourites for the last 16, first-leg clash, but Borussia are buoyed by three straight league wins since Germany star Reus signed a contract extension on February 10 to keep him in Dortmund until 2019. Despite qualifying for the Champions League's last 16 as group winners ahead of Arsenal, a dire series of results in the first half of the season left Dortmund bottom of Germany's Bundesliga at the start of the month. News of Reus' signature ended weeks of speculation that another top player was poised to quit Dortmund and he has scored in each of Borussia's last three league wins to lift them to mid-table. After stars Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski quit Dortmund for rivals Bayern Munich in recent years, Borussia's ability to hold onto a prize asset has boosted the squad, says Subotic. ""Everyone was very happy with his decision. I know I was, because he is a very special player,"" Subotic told AFP. ""It has given us a lift. We saw that in our win against Mainz when he produced a wonderful pass off the outside of his boot to (Pierre-Emerick) Aubameyang to score. ""It's always tough to see our best players go, which is what has happened in recent years. ""It's a big step for the club to be able to keep players like him."" After weeks of struggling for either league points or goals, Dortmund's attack has finally clicked with Reus, ex-Manchester United midfielder Shinji Kagawa and Aubameyang in impressive form. But Subotic admits it is hard to find a reason for the upturn in domestic fortunes. ""I can't really tell you what has changed, we have always tried to do the same things,"" he said. ""What really helped was that we had the winter break in January, when we could train as a team for a fortnight. ""Everyone got on the same page in terms of tactics and meant we can now play the football we want to. ""Before that, everyone was trying hard and running a lot, but more often running the wrong way and not doing the right thing. ""We had a lot of heart, but not much head, now we have both which makes the difference."" Alongside Reus, Aubameyang has played a key role in reviving Borrusia's form with four goals and two assists in his last three games. Subotic says the fleet-footed Gabon forward could become a rich-source of goals, after 18 months in Dortmund, to replace Lewandowski, who netted 74 times during four years for Borussia, but spent most of his first season on the bench. ""Because our football is a little different, it takes time to find a new player and to bed them in, especially if they come from a different country or have a different system,"" explained Subotic. ""Take Lewandowski, he's a perfect example of that. ""In his first year, he didn't do so much, but in the second year he hit form, once he knew what was expected of him and how to do it. ""Aubameyang's a very special player, his running ability makes him very hard to catch. ""I wouldn't want to defend against him, and I am sure the other defenders feel the same way. ""He has that speed which only a few are born with and is very hard to defend against. ""He has progressed while he's been here and we hope he stays."" Having pulled clear of the German league's relegation places Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp says his side can now focus to the Champions League with clear heads. ""This is a totally different competition,"" Klopp told BVB.de. ""It will take a while before the situation in the Bundesliga changes much, so the pressure remains high there. ""The Champions League is something different. ""Juventus are multiple-time Italian champions and we aren't going there as favourites, but we want a good result out of the game. ""The Bundesliga is our priority, but these games don't come along very often and no-one has to worry about whether it will disturb our concentration for the next league match."""
731,23/02/2015,02:12,"Juve wary of Dortmund, but confident","Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini has warned over the counter-attacking threat of Borussia Dortmund, but believes the Italians' Champions League ambitions will shine through in their last 16 clash in Turin on Tuesday.","Juventus underlined their status as Serie A champions in-waiting once again at the weekend after taking their lead over stuttering title challengers Roma to nine points. Yet in Europe's premier club competition, the two-time winners have yet to prove their worth: Juve crashed out at the group stages last season having been ousted by eventual champions Bayern Munich in the 2013 quarter-finals. Juventus and Dortmund have some history in the competition: in 1997 the Germans famously beat the Italians, then defending champions, 3-1 in Munich and the clubs met several times before then. Jurgen Klopp's men are only now fighting their way back from a torrid start to the Bundesliga season, having secured a third consecutive win, away to VfB Stuttgart on Friday, to move further away from the relegation zone. But while Chiellini warned of the threat posed by the Germans, he believes Juventus's ambition to make the final stages of the competition will come to the fore. ""Dortmund have some good players, a few who played well at the start of the season are coming back from injury, but over two legs anything can happen,"" Chiellini said to Rai television. ""We can't afford to gift them opportunities to launch counter-attacks, because they have players who excel when you give them space - although that tactic can be very risky. ""At the start of the (German league) season, they conceded a lot of goals from open play. ""We have a lot of respect (for them) but we really want to win this game, progress and keep our European dream alive: we really feel stronger than in recent seasons."" Dortmund may have flirted with the relegation zone earlier this season, but the Germans -- currently 12th at 30 points behind Bundesliga pacesetters Bayern Munich -- can be unpredictable when it comes to high-octane European meetings. As they struggled to keep pace on the domestic front, Klopp steered his men to the top of Champions League Group D, scoring 14 goals and conceding just one defeat, to set up a last-16 clash with Juventus. Borussia have now scored 10 goals in their last three league wins, but Juve are unbeaten at home all season and suffered their only defeat, away to Genoa, in October. Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri, for one, is pleased at how his side are coming through a ""key"" stage of the season. ""This is a key period in the season, but we're coming through it nicely,"" Allegri said after Friday's 2-1 win over Atalanta, in which a trademark Andrea Pirlo free kick secured the points for the Turin giants. ""It's satisfying to win these kind of games because it keeps your feet on the ground. For Tuesday's game we're in great form. I'm not worried about the Champions League, in fact we're full of confidence."" Allegri is expected to deploy a 4-3-1-2 formation with Pirlo flanked by Paul Pogba and Claudio Marchisio, with Arturo Vidal playing just behind a front pair composed of Carlos Tevez and either Fernando Llorente or Alvaro Morata. Allegri had doubts over Vidal, who sat out Friday's win over Atalanta because of a left hamstring niggle but the Chilean is now set to start having been put through his paces at the weekend."
732,21/02/2015,11:52,"Bring on Dortmund, says Juve coach Allegri","Juventus are brimming with confidence ahead of taking their first step towards a possible Champions League last eight spot when they host Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday, coach Massimiliano Allegri said.","Juve warmed up for their last 16 first leg against the Bundesliga side with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Atalanta in Turin on Friday when Andrea Pirlo hit the winner on the stroke of half-time. It left Juve 10 points clear of Roma, who visit Verona on Sunday, and means they will hold at least a seven-point lead ahead of their meeting in Rome next week. Despite being held to two draws in two of their three previous league games, Juve remain firm favourites for a fourth consecutive scudetto, and Allegri says there will be no fear ahead of Tuesday's clash in Turin. ""This is a key period in the season, but we're coming through it nicely. It's satisfying to win these kind of games because it keeps your feet on the ground,"" he said. ""For Tuesday's game we're in great form. I'm not worried about the Champions League, in fact we're full of confidence."" Dortmund visit Juventus Stadium looking to set aside mediocre league form to end Juve's 40-game unbeaten streak at home in all competitions. In the Bundesliga, they moved further away from the danger zone thanks to a 3-2 win away to VfB Stuttgart on Friday but overall it has been a far from successful season for Jurgen Klopp's men. If the Germans are to capitalise on any of Juve's weaknesses, they could do so by focusing on defence and trying to hit the Italians on the counter-attack and at setpieces. The latter two aspects remain Juve's Achilles' heel: Atalanta got off the mark on Friday when Guilio Migliaccio rose to head Urby Emanuelson's corner past Gianluigi Buffon in the Juve goal. Juve hung on for the win after Pirlo netted six minutes after Fernando Llorente had levelled for the hosts, but Allegri admitted it was a far from easy three points. ""It was a difficult game, Atalanta defended well and we left ourselves exposed to a few counter-attacks. We conceded from a corner, as we did against Milan (two weeks ago) and I wasn't happy about that at all,"" he said. ""Before the game I'd warned about the danger of Migliaccio. When the ball is in the air he usually gets his head on the end of it. And that's what happened in the end. ""It goes to show there are few easy games. You can't always win 3-0, but it was a key win because it's a delicate moment in the championship."""
733,19/02/2015,02:30,Dortmund seek Bundesliga boost ahead of Juventus,Borussia Dortmund defender Neven Subotic believes that a win in the Bundesliga against Vfb Stuttgart on Friday will provide the perfect boost ahead of their Champions League showdown with Juventus.,"Dortmund play the first leg of their last 16 tie against the Italian league leaders in Turin on Tuesday. Before travelling to Italy though, Juergen Klopp's side face a crucial German league match away to bottom of the table VfB Stuttgart. Back-to-back wins over Freiburg and Mainz - coupled with key midfielder Marco Reus's decision to sign a new contract - have lifted the mood at Dortmund. The club is still only one point above the relegation zone, however, and Subotic knows that they cannot afford to look ahead to a glamorous European tie just yet. ""We're excited about the Juventus game - we're thinking about Stuttgart,"" Subotic told AFP. ""The best thing we can do is play well against Stuttgart to get some confidence before we go into Europe."" Subotic scored his first goal of the season in last week's 4-2 home win against his former club, Mainz, a result that saw Dortmund climb one place to 15th in the 18-team standings. Dortmund came from 2-0 down to draw against Stuttgart the last time the sides met in September. Although the home team have failed to win any of their last five matches, Subotic is not expecting an easy time on Friday. ""It's a tough game,"" the 26-year-old said. ""Stuttgart have always been a hard opponent, no matter where they are in the table, regardless of where they are, or where we are in the table. ""They have a good team and I don't think anyone expected them to be last place. It is a surprise to everyone: they have good players, a great stadium and a rich tradition. ""But we know the situation can happen to anybody and just because you are last place doesn't mean you're a bad team. We were in last place ourselves until just a little while ago, so we respect their situation."" In contrast to their domestic form, Dortmund have excelled in Europe this season and topped their group ahead of Arsenal, Anderlecht and Galatasaray. Next week promises to be a big one for the club. After playing Juventus on Tuesday, they host arch rivals Schalke in the Revierderby on Saturday. However, Subotic insists that Dortmund are focused solely on picking up another three points against Stuttgart. ""We know they can be a firework, we have to watch out, be patient and not rush things,"" the Serbian international said. ""We have to watch them on the counter-attack, stay focused and not make any stupid errors."""

Replacement striker Srdjan Lakic levelled just a minute after coming on and his 72nd-minute header was followed up when Alban Meha found the back of the net with a free-kick on 79 minutes. It was Paderborn's first win since the start of November and saw them climb from 17th before kick-off to 12th. Earlier, Freiburg had briefly escaped the bottom three with a 2-0 win at Hertha Berlin in Sunday's basement battle. The defeat dampened Pal Dardai's debut in charge of Hertha after the Hungarian national team coach took charge when Jos Lukukay was sacked earlier this month. But Paderborn's victory pushed Freiburg back to 16th and in the relegation places with Hertha second from bottom on a bumper weekend of goals in the German league. There were 38 goals in the German league's nine games as leaders Bayern Munich enjoyed an 8-0 rout of Hamburg while Wolfsburg won a 5-4 thriller at Bayer Leverkusen. On Saturday, Bayern claimed the biggest Bundesliga win for 30 years to warm up for Tuesday's Champions League clash at to Shakhtar Donetsk by hammering Hamburg in Munich. Stars Arjen Robben, Thomas Mueller and Mario Goetze all netted twice as Bayern ran riot at Munich's Allianz Arena ahead of Tuesday's last-16, first-leg clash against Shakhtar in Lviv. This was Bayern's biggest league win since routing Kickers Offenbach 9-0 in March 1984 and it was the league's highest score since Borussia Moenchengladbach crushed Eintracht Braunschweig 10-0 in October the same year. It was Hamburg's heaviest ever league defeat. Just over two years after their 9-2 drubbing at Munich's Allianz Arena, Hamburg were again made to suffer having also been beaten 3-1, 5-0 and 6-0 on their last four visits to Bavaria. Second-placed Wolfsburg had Bas Dost to thank for their 5-4 win at Leverkusen as the towering Dutch striker claimed four goals while Bayer's Son Heung-Min scored a hat-trick, yet still lost. Having gone 3-0 up, Wolfsburg survived a spirited fight-back as Son claimed a hat-trick in just ten second-half minutes. Leverkusen finished with 10 men after Bosnia defender Emir Spahic was sent off late on for a second yellow card before Dost hit his fourth goal in the 93rd minute to secure a dramatic victory. The result leaves Wolfsburg both eight points ahead of third-placed Gladbach and as many behind leaders Bayern. Moenchengladbach claimed a 1-0 win at Cologne as Swiss midfielder c headed their 91st-minute winner. Two home fans were arrested after a 30-strong group invaded the pitch after the final whistle.

Werder Bremen's remarkable run continues with a 3-2 win at Augsburg for their fifth straight victory which has taken them from 18th to eighth and the verge of a European place. VfB Stuttgart stayed bottom of the table after their 2-1 defeat at Hoffenheim, thanks to Sebastian Rudy's 93rd-minute winner.

On Tuesday, Germany winger Reus ended weeks of speculation that he was set to quit at the end of the season by announcing he had signed a new contract until 2019. The Mainz victory capped a red-letter week for Borussia, who had climbed off the bottom of the table with a 3-0 at Freiburg last Saturday. Neven Subotic, Nuri Sahin, Reus and Aubemayang scored in the goal-fest against Mainz as Dortmund moved up from 16th to 14th in the table. The manner of the win is an added bonus as Borussia both rediscovered their ability to score goals and secured back-to-back victories for the first time this season. Despite falling behind to Elkin Soto's first-minute goal, Dortmund equalised through Subotic's 50th-minute header before Reus put them 2-1 up with a superb strike just after the break. Yunus Malli levelled for Mainz just two minutes later, but Dortmund proved their attack is back on form when a curling Reus pass off the side of his boot found Aubemayang who beat the goalkeeper and a defender. Sahin then volleyed home their fourth to cap an impressive display. ""The 4-2 is deserved, because we followed it up with fantastic goals,"" enthused Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, as Borussia climbed up to just behind 13th-placed Mainz. ""It was a six-point game, because the victory meant we were able to catch up with Mainz. ""Now we need to bring more consistency in our performance. The next games will not be easy."" Dortmund are away at both bottom side VfB Stuttgart on Friday, then Italian league leaders Juventus on February 24 in the Champions League last 16, before hosting Schalke 04 in the Ruhr Valley derby four days later. ""The entire season is an extreme challenge for us,"" added Klopp. ""The early goal we conceded was another comedy of errors, even if Soto did finish well, but we reacted immediately and could have scored straight away through Reus and Shinji Kagawa. ""We know we will have chances if we continue to play like that."" It is hard to overstate the importance of Reus' commitment to Borussia as Dortmund worked hard to keep their star forward after seeing Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski leave for Bayern Munich in recent years. ""It was great news for the whole region. Everyone was a bit euphoric today,"" explained Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, as the Mainz victory was the icing on the cake for Dortmund fans."

Mainz took a first-minute lead through a long-range lob by Colombian Elkin Soto. Dortmund responded with two sharp goals 10 minutes into the second half, first Neven Subotic with the equaliser and then Reus grabbing the lead after rounding the goalkeeper. That was short-lived, however, as Yunus Malli drew Mainz level just a minute later. But Dortmund secured the invaluable win with goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Nuri Sahin.

The 25-year-old had been linked to Dortmund's rivals Bayern Munich, as well as Real Madrid and Manchester United, due to a clause in his old contract, which would have allowed him to leave in June for 25 million euros ($28.25m). But Reus has silenced the speculation by putting pen to paper on a new deal with the eight-time German champions which contains no release clause. ""I am very happy with my decision for Borussia Dortmund,"" said Reus. ""Dortmund is my home town and Borussia is simply my club. ""I look forward to a successful future with our team and our fantastic fans behind us. ""There is plenty to do and I want to really get stuck in.""

There is no question about that,"" Watzke told Bild, adding that he is not prepared to answer questions about Klopp's future at the club on a weekly basis. The German daily also reported on Friday that ex-German league coaches Armin Veh and Thomas Tuchel are two candidates poised to step in should Klopp leave the club. Dortmund climbed off the bottom of the league table on Saturday with a 3-0 win at fellow strugglers Freiburg to claim their first victory since the start of December. And Klopp has said he is convinced Dortmund will stay up this season. ""I am absolutely convinced that our mission will succeed -- so accordingly it's not a subject for me,"" he said last Thursday when asked if he was considering resigning. Dortmund face the litmus test of their season in the next fortnight. They host mid-table Mainz on Friday, then fellow strugglers Stuttgart away on February 20 before their Champions League last 16, first-leg clash at Juventus.

Freiburg got off to the worst possible start when midfielder Mike Frantz played a poor back pass which was snapped up by Aubemayang. The fleet-footed winger drew Freiburg goalkeeper Roman Buerki and squared for Reus to tap into an empty net with nine minutes gone. Aubemayang then darted onto Ilkay Gundogan's superb through ball and planted his shot past Buerki on 56 minutes. His second followed on 72 minutes when he fired home after some superb passing from Dortmund's midfield trio of Reus, Shinji Kagawa and Jakob Blaczszykowski. Leaders Bayern Munich continued their march to a third straight title with a 2-0 win at VfB Stuttgart, which saw Huub Stevens' side drop to bottom of the table. ""It was very important to score just before half-time. I'm happy for both myself and the team - it was important to get a win today,"" said Bayern goal-scorer Arjen Robben. Bayern's win was their first in three matches having been thrashed 4-1 at Wolfsburg just over a week ago. Robben scored his second goal in as many games when he fired home from 13 metres out just before the half-time break to give Pep Guardiola's side the lead. Left-back David Alaba then drilled home a superb free-kick from 30 metres out to make it 2-0 with 50 minutes gone. Bayern stay eight points clear of second-placed Wolfsburg who gave Germany winger Andre Schuerrle his debut after he moved from Chelsea in a 3-0 win at home to Hoffenheim. Belgium midfielder Kevin de Bruyne claimed two goals in the impressive display. Schuerrle needed just three minutes to make his mark when his pin-point accurate cross was met by Bas Dost for the Dutch striker to fire home his fourth goal in four games. Schuerrle clattered the crossbar with a shot on 28 minutes, but De Bruyne headed home the rebound. Dost then turned provider for De Bruyne to claim his eighth goal of the season -- his fifth in the last three games -- in what is proving a productive campaign for the 23-year-old. Hertha Berlin bounced back from the sacking of coach Jos Luhukay on Thursday with an impressive display which lifted them out of the bottom three after their 2-0 win at ten-man Mainz 05. With Hungary national team coach Pal Dardai now at the helm, the visitors took the lead when Jens Hegler netted a 35th-minute penalty after former Manchester City goalkeeper Loris Karius was sent off. Hertha doubled their lead on 43 minutes when Roy Beerens slotted home after Valentin Stocker had hit the post to leave Berlin 14th. Hamburg continued their march up the table to go 11th after their second consecutive victory with a 2-1 win at home to Hanover 96. Hanover's Brazilian defender Marcelo gave Hamburg the lead when he turned the ball into his own net after 26 minutes. Ex-Germany midfielder Marcell Jansen added Hamburg's second on 50 minutes before Poland striker Artur Sobiech scored Hanover's consolation with just over 20 minutes left. Hanover are eighth despite being winless in their last four games. Paderborn dropped to just above the relegation spots after their goalless draw at Cologne while Schalke 04 went third on Friday with a 1-0 home win against Borussia Moenchengladbach."
741,06/02/2015,02:16,Guardiola shows strain as Bayern head to Stuttgart,Pep Guardiola is showing signs of feeling the pressure as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich hunt their first win of the year at strugglers VfB Stuttgart on Saturday.,"Bayern have failed to impress so far in 2015 in their two matches since returning from the Bundesliga's winter break with an 11-point lead. Their shock 4-1 thrashing at second-placed Wolfsburg last Friday was followed by a 1-1 draw at home to Schalke on Tuesday after playing for 70 minutes with ten men. The usually calm and composed Bayern coach sprinted 45 metres to remonstrate with the assistant referee after a Robert Lewandowski goal was disallowed in the 66th minute against Schalke. ""It was an emotional thing to do. I just spoke to him. It was very, very nice,"" said Guardiola tongue-in-cheek after the heated confrontation. But despite his brush-off remark, Guardiola needs an impressive display from Bayern to sooth any jarred nerves after the Wolfsburg defeat. Having steamrollered their domestic rivals before Christmas, Bayern were rattled in Wolfsburg and allowed Schalke to equalise, albeit with a numerical disadvantage following Jerome Boateng's dismissal. The Germany defender is banned for the next three games and misses the Stuttgart trip, plus home matches against Hamburg and away to Paderborn Stuttgart present the ideal chance to get back on track as Huub Stevens side are third from bottom after winning just one of their nine home games this season. Arjen Robben headed Bayern into the lead at the Allianz Arena before Schalke equalised and the Dutch star says they can ill afford similar performances as they bid for silverware. ""Of course, we played with ten men for most of the match, but when you let them equalise, conceding a goal like that can be deadly in the Champions League,"" said the 31-year-old. Bayern have two league games before they face Shakhtar Donetsk in the Ukrainian city of Lviv in the Champions League last 16, first-leg clash. Second-placed VfL Wolfsburg are set to give Andre Schuerrle his debut at home to Hoffenheim after signing the Germany winger from Chelsea on Monday to end his 19-month sojourn in London. Wolves needed a late Kevin de Bruyne goal to scrape a point in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday after their shock win over Bayern. China's Zhang Xizhe is waiting for his debut. Hertha Berlin are at Mainz 05 on Saturday with the capital city club second from bottom and with former player Pal Dardai and ex-assistant coach Rainer Widmayer now in charge. On Thursday, ex-coach Jos Luhukay became the fifth Bundesliga coach to be sacked this season after Wednesday's 1-0 loss at home to Bayer Leverkusen meant three defeats in three games. The Berlin club are battling to avoid their third relegation since 2010. Mainz will have striker Shinji Okazaki back in the side for the first time since his return from the Asian Cup where Japan reached the quarter-finals. Ahead of their trip to face Freiburg, Borussia Dortmund's coach Jurgen Klopp has insisted he will not resign with his side bottom of the table as they bid to avoid a first relegation since 1976. Dortmund will be without Kevin Grosskreutz at Freiburg and the Germany midfielder misses the next six weeks with a torn thigh muscle. He joins Ilkay Gundogan, Erik Durm and Lukasz Piszczek on Borussia's injury list. Roberto di Matteo's Schalke 04, who are sixth, have the chance to climb further up the table when they host third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach. ""They are a direct competitor for a Champions League place and if we play as well as we did at Bayern, we will make Friday count,"" said Schalke captain Benedikt Hoewedes. Fixtures (all times GMT)"
742,05/02/2015,10:53,"Dire Dortmund deserve criticism, admits Klopp",Jurgen Klopp admits relegation-threatened Borussia Dortmund deserve to be criticised after their own fans jeered their 11th defeat of the season to stay bottom of the Bundesliga.,"Dortmund slumped again in Wednesday's 1-0 defeat at home to fourth-placed Augsburg, who played the last 20 minutes with ten men. Borussia are desperately low on confidence and have just three league games before their Champions League last 16, first-leg clash at Italian league leaders Juventus. The 2011 and 2012 German champions are facing their first relegation since 1972, but have another chance to claim some badly needed points at fellow strugglers Freiburg on Saturday. Borussia's passionate fans voiced their frustrations with a chorus of whistles after the Augsburg match as veteran goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller and captain Mats Hummels approached the terraces to address their disgruntlement. ""The result hurts, but we can't pretend that we had nothing to do with the outcome,"" admitted Dortmund's head coach Klopp. ""We didn't do anything with our main chances, so there's nothing positive to report. ""After that performance the fans can accuse us of everything, but we will not give up. ""The fact that nerves play a role in a situation like this is beyond question. We need to get a grip. ""We have to give the boys some faith back. ""It's something we have already been working on the whole time, but clearly not enough."" Dortmund's next three opponents are all in the bottom half of the table as they face Freiburg, Mainz and Stuttgart in the next fortnight. Dortmund's trademark free-flowing football, which carried them to the 2013 Champions League final, has all but deserted them as they have scored just 18 goals in 19 league games. Klopp has failed to find an adequate striker since Robert Lewandowski joined Bayern Munich before the start of the season and their goal-supply has dried up. Ciro Immobile and Henrikh Mkhitaryan squandered clear chances to equalise late on against Augsburg. ""Our problem is simply that we are not going ahead in games,"" said captain Mats Hummels. ""We can now expect to fight in the next 15 matches, anything else is a bonus. ""We know that it's over 98 percent about fighting. ""The last two percent are about staying relaxed so that we make the right decisions in front of goal."" Klopp has a contract until June 2018, but is clearly under pressure to turn results around. He has been given a job guarantee by Dortmund CEO Hans-Jaochim Watzke on the back of four successful years which saw Dortmund always finish in the league's top two."

Augsburg took a deserved lead when veteran Turkish international striker Halil Altintop managed to get his pass away despite the attentions of a posse of Dortmund defenders to leave Bobadilla free to fire home his third goal in as many games on 50 minutes. To add to Borussia's woes, Kevin Grosskreutz joined their lengthy walking wounded list by limping off with a thigh injury. Augsburg were reduced to ten men on 64 minutes when defender Christoph Janker was shown a straight red for hauling down Dortmund's Gabon winger Pierre-Emerick Aubemayang. But Jurgen Klopp's 2013 Champions League finalists failed to make the numerical advantage count to suffer their fourth home defeat of the season. Italy striker Ciro Immobile squandered a golden chance in added time when he headed straight at Augsburg goalkeeper Alexander Manninger. Dortmund are two points adrift of second-from-bottom Stuttgart after they drew 0-0 with Cologne. Bayer Leverkusen moved up to fifth thanks to a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin, Stefan Kiessling scored the only goal of the game just after the half-time break at the Olympic Stadium. Hamburg moved up to 13th in the table with their first win in five matches with an emphatic 3-0 victory at home to Paderborn. Their captain and Dutch midfielder Raphael van der Vaart opened the scoring after just two minutes when he converted a penalty as left winger Marcell Jansen was fouled in the area. Former Germany squad member Jansen then made sure of the three points when he fired home on 72 minutes before attacking midfielder Zoltan Stieber added their third in the 91st minute. Hamburg's north German neighbours Werder Bremen continued their eyecatching climb up the table to 11th with their third straight win as they claimed a 2-1 victory at Hoffenheim. Bremen took an early lead when ex-Chelsea striker Franco di Santo scored his third goal in his two matches since a knee injury after just eight minutes. Hoffenheim drew level through a header by defender Ermin Bicakcic, only for Philipp Bargfrede to make it 2-1 when he fired home Di Santo's final pass on 52 minutes. Bayern Munich stayed eight points clear at the top of the table despite playing for 70 minutes with 10 men in their 1-1 draw at home to Schalke 04 on Tuesday. Arjen Robben headed Bayern into a second-half lead before Royal Blues captain Benedikt Hoewedes equalised from a corner five minutes later. Pep Guardiola's defending champions were reduced to ten men when Jerome Boatenng was shown a straight red with only 17 minutes gone for fouling Sidney Sam in the area. Second-placed VfL Wolfsburg missed the chance to close the gap behind Bayern when they needed a late Kevin de Bruyne goal to rescue a point in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt."

Lattek led Bayern Munich to their 1974 European Cup triumph and to three straight German league titles between 1972 until 1974. He then steered Borussia Moenchengladbach to the 1979 UEFA Cup and the German league titles in 1976 and 1977 before taking his Midas touch to Spain where he won the 1982 European Cup Winners' Cup with Barcelona. In total, he won 14 titles at the three clubs and along with Giovanni Trapattoni is the only coach to have won all three major European club titles. ""It is with deep sadness that I learnt of Udo Lattek's death,"" FIFA president Sepp Blatter tweeted. ""A coaching legend has passed away. My condolences to his family."" Wolfgang Niersbach, the president of the German Football Association (DFB), led the tributes from across Germany's football community. ""Udo Lattek was not only the most successful coach in the Bundesliga's history, but an outstanding personality of German football,"" he said. ""In 2012, the DFB honoured him for his life's work, because he had a decisive influence over decades of football.

Fifth-placed Augsburg are enjoying one of the best seasons in the club's history and romped to a 3-1 win over Hoffenheim on Sunday while Dortmund are enduring their worst season for 30 years. Borussia are waiting on the fitness of defender Lukasz Piszczek and midfielder Ilkay Gundogan while new signing Kevin Kampl is set to make his home debut at Borussia's Westfalenstadion. Despite the 14-point lead his team holds over Dortmund in the Bundesliga table, Augsburg coach Markus Weinzierl says they are underdogs. ""We will face an opponent who has a very strong squad and, although it sounds strange to say this with fifth place playing against 18th, they are certainly the favourites,"" said Weinzierl on Tuesday. ""With their fans behind them, Dortmund will do everything to get the three points and climb out of the bottom three. ""The situation is very interesting for us and explosive for Dortmund, because they have to win."" Klopp has said points are Dortmund's priority by insisting ""I can't preach about relegation and in the next breath demand Champagne football"" in the battle to stay up. ""We have to take the next step against Augsburg by using the advantage of playing in our own stadium,"" said Klopp, whose side face Juventus away in the Champions League's last 16, first leg, in three weeks. ""We can't worry about style in times like these, it's about points -- we need results."" Klopp's side was criticised for a lack of eye-catching football at Leverkusen, which the Dortmund boss fails to understand. ""Once we get some confidence back, then some of our footballing elements will return, but you can't please everyone,"" he added."
746,31/01/2015,21:11,"No fizz, but Klopp happy with Dortmund point",Borussia Dortmund Jurgen Klopp says he does not expect 'Champagne football' from his side as they battle to avoid relegation at the bottom of the Bundesliga.,"Dortmund slipped back into last place despite Saturday's goalless draw at fellow Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen. Before kick-off, Freiburg's 4-1 comeback win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt had lifted Christian Streich's side up to 13th had sent Klopp's side bottom for the first time since November. Despite their precarious position, Dortmund are just three points from mid-table ahead of Wednesday's Bundesliga match at Augsburg. ""That was an important point. I am happy, we're within in striking distance,"" said Klopp as Dortmund endure their worst start to a Bundesliga season for 30 years. ""That was a tough game to start the second half of the season and was very intensive football. ""I can't preach that we are in a relegation battle and demand Champagne football."" Borussia failed to break the hosts' defence at Leverkusen's BayArena as Borussia's Italy striker Ciro Immobile squandered several second-half chances. At the other end, Borussia's Germany defender Mats Hummels headed Gonzalo Castro's first-half shot off the line in the hosts' best chance after Castro had earlier shot over the bar. ""We can live with that. This isn't an easy place to come and pick up anything,"" said Dortmund's new signing Kevin Kampl. ""We knew they had an extremely good pressing game, perhaps it wasn't the best football, but the main thing for us is to pick up points -- even if it was just one today."" With just 16 points from 18 games, Klopp has serious problems up front as his attack has netted just 18 goals all season. Klopp's new strikers Immobile and Adrian Ramos have struggled to provide the 22 goals Robert Lewandowski hit in 34 games last season before joining Bayern Munich."

At the other end, Borussia's Germany defender Mats Hummels headed Gonzalo Castro's first-half shot off the line in the hosts' best chance after Castro had earlier shot over the bar. With ten defeats in 18 games, Klopp's side have the worst record in Germany's top flight as they look to avoid dropping out of the Bundesliga for the first time since 1976, while Bayer are fifth. Schalke 04's star striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar will miss Tuesday's Bundesliga clash at leaders Bayern Munich after being sent off in their 1-0 league win over Hanover 96. 'The Hunter', who has claimed seven league goals this season, was shown a straight red for hacking down Hanover's Manuel Schmiedebach five minutes from time. The Dutch international has netted 66 goals in 117 league games at Schalke, but is now suspended for what already looked a difficult league clash at Bayern's Allianz Arena on Tuesday. ""The red card against Klaas-Jan Huntelaar has hurt us,"" admitted Schalke coach Roberto Di Matteo. ""It was a foul and the referee was in a good position. ""Klaas-Jan was trying to win the ball, but didn't succeed and, of course, it's a pity he will be missing now."" The Royal Blues went ahead at the Veltins Arena when midfielder Marco Hoeger slotted his shot past Hanover's Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler with 32 minutes gone. The win lifted Di Matteo's Schalke, who face holders Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League next month, up to fourth in the table. Pep Guardiola's Bayern had their lead cut to eight points on Friday when they suffered a shock 4-1 hammering at second-placed VfL Wolfsburg as the Bundesliga resumed after the winter break. Borussia Moenchengladbach went third in the league on Saturday after Patrick Herrmann netted their second-half goal in a 1-0 win over VfB Stuttgart, who dropped to second from bottom. Herrmann drilled home Branimir Hrgota's swirling cross 20 minutes from time to move Lucien Favre's side up behind leaders Bayern and VfL Wolfsburg. Freiburg's 4-1 win over Frankfurt featured a second-half hat-trick from ex-Bayern striker Nils Petersen, who came off the bench to grab the points for Freiburg and leave Borussia bottom. It was Freiburg's first win since November and it catapulted them up from last place to 13th in the table. Cologne pulled away from the relegation zone and up to tenth with a 2-0 win at strugglers Hamburg, who drop to 15th and just above the bottom three. Cologne picked up their fifth away win, to match Bayern's tally on the road as midfielder Marcel Risse scored both second-half goals. He fired his first through the legs of Hamburg goalkeeper Jaroslav Drobny before burying a final pass from Nigeria's Anthony Ujah 12 minutes from time. Mid-table Mainz romped to a 5-0 win over Paderborn as midfielder Yunus Malli scored twice and set up their third."
748,30/01/2015,02:06,Battling Borussia fighting for Bundesliga survival,Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp admits feeling the pressure as his side resume their fight to stay in Germany's top flight on Saturday at fellow Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen.,"""My mood is very tense, like it would be just before a very difficult exam, but we are in better shape than we were at the start of the season,"" insisted Klopp on Thursday. ""Leverkusen is a very important game, one of 17 very important games now for us, but I have been looking forward to this since the final whistle of our last league match at Bremen."" Just over 18 months after losing the 2013 Champions League final to arch-rivals Bayern Munich, Dortmund are second from bottom and threatened with relegation from the Bundesliga. Their domestic fall from grace has been even more dramatic on the back of a successful European campaign which has seen them reach the Champions League's last 16. Like most teams, Dortmund had expected to drop a league point here or there after five of the squad returned weary from helping Germany lift a fourth World Cup title last July. But Klopp's dejected figure on the sidelines, struggling to accept any one of Dortmund's 10 league defeats, became an all-too common sight. Having won the 2011 and 2012 German league titles, then finished runners-up to Bayern in 2013 and 2014, Dortmund suddenly found themselves at the wrong end of the table this term. Defeats at Mainz, Schalke and Cologne preceded humiliating loses at Hertha Berlin and Werder Bremen in December. ""To finish the first half of the season in 17th was like going on holiday where you sleep on a bed of nails,"" Klopp told German daily Die Welt. Injuries to attacking midfielders Marco Reus and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, especially after Poland striker Robert Lewandowski had left to join Bayern, meant the goals dried up. Klopp had to grapple with a growing injury list and loss of form from key players, but the 47-year-old admits there were pre-season hints to Dortmund's demise. ""It was relatively clear that it would be difficult,"" he said. ""Even during pre-season training we thought: it will be tight to be ready in time. ""We picked up six points from our first three games, which was fine. ""We went to Mainz in late September with the chance of going top, but we ended up losing. ""Then it was quickly down to blow after blow and due to more injuries, we could hardly react or have enough time to train and those players we had fit were soon overloaded. ""But at the same time, you're Borussia Dortmund, you are the runners-up, former champions, former Champions League finalists. ""Wherever we went, people said ""you'll turn it round"", but on the pitch things turned into a riot in a sporting sense. ""It was a downward spiral."" Klopp is the first to admit he made mistakes, for example using players who insisted they were fit to help the cause, when their performances in training suggested otherwise. CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke says their rivals have used Dortmund's plight to pick up points this season while Bayern run away with the title having built up an 11-point lead. ""We've seen many teams, who normally pick up points against Bayern Munich, have simply rolled over against them,"" Watzke told Munich-based newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung. ""Instead, those teams (pick up points) against us. ""We are now the platform for the others to create something special."" Dortmund's goal in recent years has been to challenge Bayern and secure a Champions League berth for the following season, but this campaign is now all about avoiding relegation. That would mean potentially losing stars like Reus, who can leave in June due to a clause in his contract, and Hummels, who has been strongly linked to Manchester United. There is also the financial impact of a season without Champions League football, which would cost Dortmund around 20 million euros in lost revenue after tax. ""To miss out on 20 million would be tough, but would not bring us into financial difficulties,"" insisted Watzke, after the club only narrowly escaped bankruptcy in 2005."

""We know how important the first two or three games will be and if we can win our first couple of games of 2015 then we will realise we can take a big step towards defending our Bundesliga title."" Wolfsburg play their first match since the death of Belgium Under-21 international Junior Malanda earlier this month in a car crash. It remains to be seen whether China midfielder Zhang Xizhe makes his Bundesliga debut for Wolves. Due to their massive lead, Bayern's main rivals have given up hope of catching up with Wolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking rejecting the media's label for his side of 'Bayern Hunters'. Rudi Voeller, third-placed Bayer Leverkusen's director of sport, has insisted there are ""worlds"" between Bayern and the chasing pack. At the other end of the table, last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund look to climb out of the relegation places. After 10 defeats in 17 games, Dortmund are level with bottom side Freiburg on 15 points and the 2013 Champions League finalists are determined to improve their fortunes at Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday. Dortmund welcome back Germany winger Marco Reus and attacking midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan from injury. But they will be without defensive midfielders Sven Bender and Sebastian Kehl after the pair picked up injuries during the winter break training camp in Spain. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has described going into the winter break in 17th place as feeling ""like going on holiday on a bed of nails"". Dortmund boosted their squad over the winter break by signing Slovenian right winger Kevin Kampl from RB Salzburg. Klopp has said his main focus is keeping Dortmund in the Bundesliga, rather than targeting a Champions League place. ""Obviously, we have been viewed harshly, also by our own fans,"" Klopp admitted. ""We have to win back some credit, but we can't just focus on Leverkusen.""

754,28/01/2015,12:50,Klopp convinced Dortmund will avoid relegation,Jurgen Klopp is convinced Borussia Dortmund will avoid relegation despite beginning the second half of the Bundesliga season at Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday second from bottom in the table.,"""We are not naively optimistic and know that the pressure situations won't be any less,"" Dortmund's head coach Klopp told German daily Die Welt. ""But when we look at our situation, we know we can control it."" Despite reaching the Champions League's last 16 as group winners, Dortmund are second from bottom, following the Bundesliga's winter break, after a disastrous ten defeats in 17 league matches due to injuries and a lack of form. ""To finish the first half of the season in 17th place felt like going on holiday on a bed of nails,"" quipped Klopp. The 47-year-old has been given a job guarantee by Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke with his contract set to expire in June 2018 but Klopp is all too aware they must start picking up points. Dortmund are just four points from mid-table and are 12 away from a Champions League place for next season. ""Obviously, we have been viewed harshly, also by our own fans, trust is a delicate flower, which can be quickly lost,"" admitted Klopp. ""We have to win back some credit, but we can't just focus on Leverkusen. ""Our position is clear, we are four points behind the area where we want to be at the end of the season."" Having seen star players Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski quit for Bayern Munich over the last two seasons, Klopp says he is hopeful Germany winger Marco Reus will stay with Dortmund. The 25-year-old has a release clause in his contract means he could leave at the end of the season for 25 million euros (US$23.89m). ""The boys are 100 percent here and I have a positive feeling that the player we are talking about (Reus) will stay a bit longer,"" said Klopp."
755,21/01/2015,12:21,Klopp's priority is keeping Dortmund in Bundesliga,"Jurgen Klopp says his priority for the second half of the season is keeping struggling Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga, not qualifying for next season's Champions League.","Dortmund face Juventus home and away in the last 16 of Europe next month after winning their Champions League group, but a disastrous start to the league season has left them second from bottom in the German league. The 2013 Champions League finalists have qualified for Europe for the last four seasons, but with his team currently 12 points away from the European places and near the foot of the Bundesliga table, Dortmund's head coach Klopp says simply avoiding relegation is his priority. ""I'm currently not interested at all in qualifying for the Champions League next season,"" Klopp told German magazine Sport Bild with Dortmund away to fellow Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen on January 31 in their first league match of 2015. ""As of today, I have no problem with keeping us in the league and spending next year putting in a lot of training."" The loss of star players Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski im the last two seasons has taken their toll on the 2011 and 2012 German champions who have struggled badly for form this season despite finishing as runners-up to Bayern Munich for the last two seasons. With ten defeats in 17 matches, Dortmund have the worst losing record in the Bundesliga and Klopp admits he has made mistakes. ""There have been common misconceptions, such as whether someone is really physically able to help us,"" he admitted. ""When someone plays who isn't 100 percent fit, then he makes mistakes. ""It's the same as if someone is sleep deprived for 72 hours and then has to play in the world chess championships, that simply doesn't work,"" said Klopp, who added he is ""100 percent"" convinced Dortmund will stay up. German media have reported Dortmund's Germany winger Marco Reus will announce his future in March as a release clause in his contract allows him to leave at the end of the season. But Klopp says he does not expect any of his stars to walk out if they fail to qualify for the Champions League. ""If there is a player in our team who wants to leave because of a single year without Champions League football, then I have completely rated him wrongly,"" insisted Klopp."
756,20/01/2015,13:59,Strugglers Dortmund lose Kehl for Juventus,Borussia Dortmund will be without Sebastian Kehl for the next four weeks as they prepare to face Juventus in the Champions League after the experienced midfielder suffered a shoulder injury.,"Kehl will miss Dortmund's last 16 clash at Italian league leaders Juventus on February 24 with the return leg in Dortmund on March 18. Despite qualifying for the last 16 in Europe, Dortmund will resume their Bundesliga campaign next week second from bottom of the table after losing a disastrous 10 of their 17 German league matches in the first half of the season. The 34-year-old Kehl will also miss their opening league match of 2015 at Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday January 31 after the Bundesliga's winter break. Kehl picked up the injury in last Saturday's 1-0 friendly win over Romania's Steaua Bucharest during their Spanish training camp. The set-back adds to Dortmund's woes after Germany squad members Erik Durm and Sven Bender returned from Spain with injuries. Midfielder Kevin Grosskreutz is expected to be available to face both Juventus and Leverkusen despite injuring ankle ligaments against Steaua. According to German daily Bild, Dortmund are interested in signing former Real Madrid midfielder Lassana Diarra, 29, as cover as the Frenchman is currently without a club since being released by Lokomotiv Moscow."

""I'm very pleased with the way the injury has healed, I can do everything I did before it happened,"" Reus, who missed Germany's World Cup triumph last June with an ankle injury, told German broadcaster ARD. ""It's important that I can look ahead, be fit to help the team move up the table,"" said Reus. ""It's important that we now pick up the points to boost our confidence again."" He says he bitterly regrets the scandal he caused in December when it was revealed he had never passed a driving test, despite having driven for years, which led to a record EUR540,000 ($665,000) fine. ""If I could undo this, I would, but I can't and therefore I have to stand up and take it on the chin,"" he said. There was some bad news for Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp as both midfielders Sebastian Kehl and Kevin Grosskreutz picked up injuries against Steaua. Dortmund are away to fellow Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen when the Bundesliga resumes on January 31 and are desperate to pull themselves up from 17th in the table after a disastrous first-half of the season. Despite winning their Champions League group, Borussia lost 10 of their first 17 league matches -- the worst record in Germany's top flight. They face Italian league leaders Juventus away in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 clash on February 24 with the return leg in Dortmund on March 18."
758,13/01/2015,09:01,Aubameyang owes Gabon another shot at glory,Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will in Equatorial Guinea hope to make up for his penalty miss which denied Gabon an historic semi-final appearance at the Africa Cup of Nations three years ago.,"Aubameyang scored three goals as co-hosts Gabon reached the quarter-finals of the 2012 Nations Cup, but he failed to convert his kick in the penalty shoot-out, allowing Mali to reach the last four instead. That run to the quarter-finals matched Gabon's record at the 1996 tournament in South Africa, where they also reached the last eight. Known as 'Aubame' or 'Auba', and the son of former Gabon international Pierre Aubameyang -- led Gabon in their Nations Cup debut in 1994 -- the Dortmund star scored twice and provided four assists as Gabon finished top of Group C of the qualifying tournament for the 2015 Nations Cup ahead of Burkina Faso. The Panthers will again battle Burkina Faso in the first round of Equatorial Guinea 2015 along with the host nation and Congo Brazzaville. In August 2014, Aubemayang made headlines when he celebrated his goal in Dortmund's German Super Cup win against Bayern Munich by pulling on the mask of comic superhero Spiderman. Now he will be counted on to lead his country to glory in Equatorial Guinea after coming so close in 2012. The 25-year-old forward, formerly of Saint-Etienne, has been one of the most consistent African strikers in Europe in recent times and this was underscored by the fact he made the final five nominees for the CAF African Footballer of the Year in the past two years. He was only beaten by Manchester City star Yaya Toure to the continent's biggest individual accolade for 2014. Aubameyang, who started out with the AC Milan youth team, could play either as a central striker or on the wings. He boasts of aerial prowess as well as a blistering burst of speed - he has been timed to run 30 metres in 3.7 seconds. ""He can shield the ball, he's pretty good in the air, he's always in top shape and he can also play with his back to goal,"" remarked Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp of his all-round attacking ace. He featured for France age-group teams but he eventually opted to play for his father's native country and thus made his debut in 2009. He has since gone on to net 14 goals in 38 appearances for Gabon. After a difficult start in the German Bundesliga in 2013, he has flourished at Dortmund to become one of the club's key stars by contributing 18 goals and 8 assists in 49 appearances in all competitions in the past year. After the Nations Cup campaign, he will head back to Germany with the aim of helping transform the fortunes of his club. Champions as recently as 2011 and 2012, they now languish second from bottom in the Bundesliga table after a terrible first half of the season. In the absence of injured talisman Marco Reus, the Gabon skipper has had a key role to play for his club already this season, netting five goals in the league and three in the UEFA Champions League, where they have reached the knockout stage after winning their group ahead of Arsenal."

""It was a bit of a close shave but it's fine,"" Kagawa told Japanese media after sustaining bruising and sitting out the rest of training as a precaution. ""I just landed heavily on my elbow, nothing too serious. It would have been embarrassing to injure myself doing that."" Kagawa will have added incentive to do well at the Asian Cup in Australia after fracturing a metatarsal in the semifinals of the 2011 tournament and missing Japan's victory over the Socceroos in the final in Doha. ""It was a frustrating situation for me four years ago and I want to be able to contribute this time,"" said the former Manchester United player, who failed to make an impact at last year's World Cup where the Blue Samurai flopped badly. ""People expect that of me and if I can play well and we get results it will give me confidence, which is what I need. But the main thing is that the team does well."" Japan, who have lifted the Asian Cup a record four times, are also drawn alongside Jordan and surprise 2007 winners Iraq. However, hosts Australia threw down the gauntlet with a thumping 4-1 win over Kuwait in the tournament opener on Friday. ""I saw a little bit of the match and it certainly whetted my appetite,"" said Kagawa. ""As for Palestine, we haven't seen much videotape of them so it's hard to make any judgements. We just have to stay focused on the task ahead."""

""Kevin Kampl is a versatile attacking midfielder, who we have been observing for some time. His style of play fits in perfectly with our own,"" Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc told the club website. Borussia said that ""both clubs agreed details of the transfer fee shall remain undisclosed"", although the website of German magazine Kicker reported the fee would be in the region of 10 to 12 million euros (£7.8m-9.4m, $12.2m-14.7m). Kampl, who will join his new club in January, was born in Germany but represents Slovenia at international level. He started his career at Bayer Leverkusen and played for several lower-league clubs in Germany before moving to Salzburg in 2012.   News of Kampl's arrival comes as a boost to Dortmund, who are through to the last 16 of the Champions League but lie in the relegation zone in the Bundesliga at the season's halfway stage. Their next game, against Leverkusen, is not until January 31."

""Almost all of our first-choice players were missing at some point in the first half of the season and weren't always 100 percent fit. ""We should manage to get everyone fit during January's winter break, then we can show a different side when we have our best 15 or 16 players. ""We have had the worst half to the season anyone could have imagined. The worry has been considerable for weeks and the way we are playing, we are right down there."" Dortmund were last relegated from Germany's top flight in the 1971/72 season, when they finished the first half of the campaign in 15th compared to their current position of 17th. Despite scoring Dortmund's consolation goal in Bremen, World Cup-winner Hummels was one of several below-par performers and was beaten for pace by Bremen's Davie Selke in the build-up to Werder's second goal. The point bottom side Freiburg earned in Sunday's 2-2 draw with Hanover meant Dortmund finished the weekend joint last. Both Dortmund and Freiburg have a goal difference of minus eight and their points tally of 15 is Borussia's worst at this stage since the 1987/88 season. Dortmund qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League -- where they will face Juventus -- after winning their group ahead of Arsenal, but they have endured the worst start to a Bundesliga season for 27 years. Having finished as runners-up to Bayern for the last two years, this is the first time Dortmund go into the winter break in a direct relegation spot in the club's history. Their 10 defeats and just four points picked up away from home are both top-flight low marks. ""The fact that we look like complete idiots on the pitch, serves us right,"" said coach Jurgen Klopp. ""We played the shittiest first half of the season in our lives."" But Klopp has said he will ensure Dortmund put in a more convincing display when the season resumes at the end of January with a trip to another of Germany's Champions League representatives, Bayer Leverkusen. ""It will be much more difficult to beat us,"" added Klopp. ""We're not that far away from climbing out of trouble. We will be a fierce hunter (of those above us), I can promise that."""
763,21/12/2014,19:47,Freiburg hold Hanover to leave Dortmund joint bottom,Borussia Dortmund went joint bottom of the Bundesliga on Sunday after Hanover 96 scored two late goals to draw 2-2 at Freiburg as Germany's top flight breaks for winter.,"The Bundesliga starts its winter break leaving last season's runners-up Dortmund level on 15 points and a goal difference of minus eight alongside last-placed Freiburg. Goals by striker Mike Frantz and defender Marc-Oliver Kempf had put hosts Freiburg 2-0 up at their Schwarzwald Stadium before Hanover scored twice in the last 10 minutes to claim a point. Midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt struck on 83 minutes before their Spanish star Joselu netted in the third minute of added time to deny Freiburg their first win since the start of November. Earlier on Sunday, Hertha Berlin defender John Brooks gave away his side's first two goals in their 5-0 thrashing at home by Hoffenheim. The USA international turned the ball into his own net on 23 minutes at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, then gave away a penalty three minutes later. Bosnia midfielder Sejad Salihovic drilled home the spot-kick and things went from bad to worse for Hertha. Brooks' team-mate Nico Schulz was unlucky to concede a penalty after nudging Hoffenheim captain Andreas Beck on 39 minutes and Salihovic converted his second spot-kick. Hertha capitulated in the second half as Sven Schipplock added to the hosts' misery when he walked the ball into an empty net on 74 minutes after a Hoffenheim counter-attack. Germany international Sebastian Rudy then came off the Hoffenheim bench to grab their fifth goal. ""It was a black day for us,"" admitted Schulz, while Hertha coach Jos Luhukay said his side had contributed to their own downfall. ""We really helped them, you only have to look at the goals,"" said the Dutchman. This was seventh-placed Hoffenheim's biggest victory in their seven years in Germany's top flight while Hertha, 13th, have now leaked nine goals in their last two games after drawing 4-4 at Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday. On Saturday, Dortmund suffered their 10th defeat from their first 17 games, losing 2-1 at Werder Bremen as teenager Davie Selke scored for the hosts, then set up their second for Fin Bartels. Second-placed Wolfsburg fought back to claim a 2-1 home win against mid-table Cologne which trimmed Bayern Munich's lead at the top back to 11 points. Defender Dominic Maroh gave Cologne a shock lead after just 11 minutes before Dutch striker Bas Dost equalised five minutes later. Brazil defender Naldo then headed the winner from a corner 12 minutes from time. Bayer Leverkusen stay third after coming from behind for a 1-1 draw at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Eintracht captain Alexander Meier, the league's leading scorer, converted a penalty to take him to 13 goals in 16 games this season, before Leverkusen's Karim Bellarabi equalised. Roberto di Matteo's Schalke 04 stay fifth after being held to a goalless draw at home to Hamburg, while Stuttgart remain above the bottom three places after their goalless draw at home to Paderborn. Meanwhile, Augsburg fought back for a 2-1 win at home to fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach to go sixth. On Friday, Bayern broke more league records as Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben scored in their 2-1 comeback win at Mainz after Colombia midfielder Elkin Soto had given the hosts' a shock first-half lead. The Mainz result saw Bayern claim new records for the fewest goals conceded in the first half of a Bundesliga season and their 11-point lead after 17 games is also a new best mark."

Despite scoring Dortmund's consolation goal in Bremen, Germany star Hummels was one of several below-par performers in his team having been beaten for pace by Bremen's goal-scorer Davie Selke in the build-up to Werder's second goal. Dortmund qualified as group winners ahead of Arsenal for the last 16 of the Champions League, where they have drawn Juventus, but have endured the worst start to a Bundesliga season for 27 years.

765,21/12/2014,02:10,Bayern's domination sparks 'boring Bundesliga' debate,"Bayern Munich will start 2015 with a record 11-point lead in the Bundesliga, sparking debate over how to stop Germany's top flight becoming boring.","Pep Guardiola's Bayern have brushed off their domestic rivals with ease and are poised to become the first team to go through a Bundesliga campaign unbeaten on their way to what would be a third consecutive title. They set more records in Friday's 2-1 comeback win at Mainz having conceded just four goals since August and their points lead at the season's halfway stage is also a league best. They have dropped only six points from a possible 51 so far and post heavy wins in Germany's top tier with monotonous regularity. None of the chasing pack of Wolfsburg, Borussia Moenchengladbach, Bayer Leverkusen or Schalke look realistically capable of closing the gap while last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund are languishing in the relegation places. Ex-Germany coach Berti Vogts sparked debate about how to loosen Bayern's iron grip on the German title by suggesting they should receive less of the league's television revenue. Sky currently pay 628 million euros ($768m) to televise Bundesliga games in Germany and the cash is divided up on a percentage basis with the most going to the league winner. ""We have to get to the point where we subsidise the smaller clubs, by a redistribution of the television money, for example,"" suggested Vogts. But the mere suggestion left ex-Bayern midfielder and Germany international Paul Breitner fuming. ""We (Bayern) can't do anything about the inability of the other clubs. And if we have to bleed now, so the money is redistributed, that's just nonsense!"" he snapped. Bayern are one of the world's richest clubs. They recently paid off the loan on their Allianz Arena stadium decades ahead of schedule and posted a record 528.7 million-euro turnover for the 2013/14 season, with a profit of 16.5 million euros. German teams seem to play Bayern in more hope than expectation of claiming league points. ""Bayern Munich are in a different league, I think we can all agree on that,"" said Augsburg coach Markus Weinzierl after Bayern thrashed his team 4-0 at home. And Hoffenheim coach Markus Gisdol reached the same conclusion before his side were duly dispatched 4-0 in Munich. ""Bayern will lose at home sooner or later, but when you lose four, five or six-nil in Munich, that's normal,"" he mused. Having won the 2011 and 2012 German league titles, then finished runners-up to Bayern in the last two seasons, Dortmund now peer up at Guardiola's Munich from near the foot of the table. Having seen his top players playmaker Mario Goetze and striker Robert Lewandowski join Bayern in the last two seasons, Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp said any German football fan looking for a consistently successful team has only one choice. ""Anyone who just wants to be successful has only one avenue to go down: you have to be a Bayern fan,"" said Klopp, tongue-in-cheek. Klopp predicted the current league situation back in April 2013, two months before Guardiola's arrival. Just before Bayern beat Dortmund 2-1 in the 2013 Champions League final, the German media questioned whether the Bundesliga was following the Spanish league, where two clubs, Real Madrid and Barcelona, traditionally dominate. But Klopp accurately predicted the Bundesliga would mirror Scotland, where Celtic have won the last three league titles after rivals Rangers dropped out of the top flight after the club's liquidation in 2012. ""It's nice that people put us in the same boat as Bayern,"" said Klopp in April 2013, with Dortmund second in the table, but trailing Bayern by 20 points. ""But I think from the start of next season, we'll see that the comparison to Spain doesn't fit, it's more like Scotland."" Even the league's top scorer, Eintracht Frankfurt's Alexander Meier, expects the trophy for the most goals this season to eventually end up in Munich. ""I don't look at the top-scorer table and I honestly think the trophy will go to someone from Bayern,"" he said."

Dortmund will finish 2014 back at the bottom if Freiburg score and pick up a point against Hanover 96 on Sunday, when the Bundesliga starts the winter break. But Klopp insists the 2013 Champions League finalists are not yet relegation candidates, despite their precarious position in the table. ""I wouldn't write us off yet,"" head coach Klopp insisted with the Bundesliga to resume at the end of January. ""We have three weeks to prepare ourselves for the second half of the season. We have played the worst first-half of the season of our lives, it's a catastrophe, but life goes on. ""Nothing much worked in the first-half and things only improved a little bit after that. We have tortured ourselves so far, but the season isn't over yet. ""We must, and we will, improve, we have shown a lot of weaknesses in the first half of the season, but we're not as weak as that. ""We need to recharge our batteries and fight back in the new year."" Borussia, who face Juventus in the last 16 of the Champions League in February, fell behind with just three minutes gone when Bremen's 19-year-old striker Davie Selke curled in a superb goal from 15 metres out. Selkie then turned provider by outsprinting Dortmund captain Mats Hummels to put in a great cross which Bremen midfielder Fin Bartels converted on 62 minutes. Hummels pulled a goal back when he headed home unmarked a corner from fellow Germany international Ilkay Gundogan on 69 minutes, but it was no more than a consolation. Having won the 2011 and 2012 German league titles, then finished runners-up to Bayern in the last two seasons, Dortmund now peer up at Pep Guardiola's Munich from near the foot of the table. Bayern are set to finish the weekend at least 11 points clear -- a new league record and Guardiola has said Dortmund's dire league form serves as a warning. ""When I see Dortmund, I always think: 'Okay. Pep, this can happen to us. This is a lesson for me. Bayern can also lose,"" Guardiola told reporters before his side's 2-1 comeback win at Mainz on Friday. ""To prevent this situation we must always try to improve."" Klopp should be able to welcome back key attacking midfielders Marco Reus and Henrikh Mkhitaryan during January's winter break with the pair having missed recent weeks with an ankle and thigh injury respectively."

Dortmund continue to have the most defeats in Germany's top flight at the season's halfway stage with just 15 points from 17 games as Bremen picked up the three points to allow them to climb off the foot of the table. Bremen deservedly claimed only their fourth win of the season. Jurgen Klopp's Borussia, who will face Juventus in the last 16 of the Champions League, fell behind with just three minutes gone when Bremen's 19-year-old striker Davie Selke curled in a superb goal from 15 metres out.

Bayer Leverkusen stay third after coming from behind for a 1-1 draw at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Eintracht captain Alexander Meier converted a penalty to make him the league's top scorer with 13 goals in 16 games before Leverkusen's Germany winger Karim Bellarabi equalised seven minutes from time. Roberto di Matteo's Schalke 04, who have drawn Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, stay fifth in the table after being held to a goalless draw at home to Hamburg in a poor display. There was some good news for Royal Blues fans before kick-off as Netherlands striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar extended his contract until 2017 having scored 66 goals in 116 Bundesliga matches. Stuttgart remain above the bottom three places after their goalless draw at home to Paderborn. Augsburg fought back for a 2-1 win at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach, who took the lead after only two minutes when Max Kruse converted a penalty before midfielder Markus Feulner and striker Raul Bobadilla scored either side of half-time. The result leaves Augsburg sixth while Gladbach drop to fourth. On Friday, Pep Guardiola's Bayern broke more league records as Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben scored in their 2-1 comeback win at Mainz after Colombia midfielder Elkin Soto had given the hosts' a shock first-half lead. The Mainz result saw Bayern claim a new record for the fewest goals conceded in the first-half of the season as their defence have leaked just four goals. At the season's halfway stage, Bayern will finish the weekend at least 11 points ahead, claiming a new record for the league's biggest advantage at the halfway stage, beating their own joint best mark of 10. Bayern have also equalled their own record for the highest goal difference at the halfway point of plus 37, the same they managed in 2012/13, the season they last won the Champions League."
768,19/12/2014,19:25,Dortmund hunt points in Bremen amidst Reus scandal,Borussia Dortmund head to Werder Bremen on Saturday eager to claim points to escape the Bundesliga's bottom three amidst the scandal surrounding Germany winger Marco Reus.,"Reus, who is currently sidelined with an ankle injury, was slapped with a record EUR540,000 ($665,000) fine on Thursday having driven for years without a licence, which was only revealed after he recently gave police a fake Dutch licence when he was stopped. Reus has issued an apology, but it is an unwelcome distraction for Dortmund, who are currently languishing in 16th place in Germany's 18-team top flight despite having qualified for the knockout stage of the Champions League. ""I was also surprised by the news. He took a wrong turn somewhere,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""With stories like this, it was difficult to find a way out, but things will just carry on for us. ""He is a great bloke who has made a mistake."" Dortmund play their final Bundesliga match of 2014 on Saturday against a Bremen side who are bottom of the table and three points could see them climb up as high as 12th, if results elsewhere go their way. Borussia will be without centre-back Neven Subotic, who is suspended after receiving his fifth yellow card of the season in Wednesday's 2-2 draw with Wolfsburg. Alongside Reus, playmaker Henrikh Mkhitaryan is out with a torn thigh while Bremen are without defender Luca Caldirola, who was sent off for a second yellow and subsequent red in their 4-1 hammering by Borussia Moenchengladbach on Wednesday."

Dortmund twice let the lead slip, a piece of sloppy defending five minutes from time ultimately costing them the three points when Wolfsburg' Brazil defender Naldo headed home having been left unmarked at a corner. Despite reaching the last 16 of the Champions League, where they will face Juventus, Dortmund have the worst record in the Bundesliga with nine defeats in their first 16 matches and are 16th in the table. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's early goal for Dortmund was cancelled out by a Kevin de Bruyne free-kick in the first-half. Ciro Immobile restored Dortmund's lead with a stunning strike 14 minutes from time before Naldo rescued a point for Wolves. Ten-man Werder Bremen, who host Dortmund on Saturday, remain rooted to the bottom of the table after their 4-1 defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach, who move up to third. Striker Max Kruse and defender Oscar Wendt put Gladbach 2-0 up at the break before Bremen's dead-ball specialist Zlatko Junuzovic smashed home a second-half free-kick. But Bremen had Luca Caldirola sent off with an hour gone for a second bookable offence before Christoph Kramer and Swedish striker Branimir Hrgota added Gladbach's goals. Bayer Leverkusen drop to fourth on goal difference despite Stefan Kiessling's goal giving them a 1-0 win at Hoffenheim. Eintracht Frankfurt's Alexander Meier rescued his side with two goals in added time to seal a stunning 4-4 draw at home to Hertha Berlin. Hertha were 4-2 up with 90 minutes played before Meier struck to take his tally to a Bundesliga best 12 goals. Schalke are up to fifth after a 2-1 come-back win at Paderborn. On Tuesday, Bayern beat Freiburg 2-0, Netherlands winger Arjen Robben scoring his 100th goal for the German champions. Only a superb display from Freiburg goalkeeper Roman Burki kept the scoreline respectable as Bayern fired in 31 shots on goal -- a Bundesliga record this season. Goals by Robben and Thomas Mueller sealed Bayern's win ahead of their final match of the year at Mainz on Friday. Victory came at a price with defender Mehdi Benatia ruled out with a groin strain. Striker Robert Lewandowski, midfielder Xabi Alonso and Jerome Boateng are all doubts as well having taken knocks during the game."

Dortmund slipped back into the relegation places at the weekend when their 1-0 defeat at fellow strugglers Hertha Berlin left them 16th. Dortmund travel to face Werder Bremen, who are one place below them, on Saturday and Klopp says six points is the only appropriate gift for their fans ahead of the Bundesliga's winter break which starts on Sunday. ""The last two games of 2014 must be a gift to this awesome club and its fans,"" said Klopp. ""The most positive news is that the game (Wednesday's against Wolfsburg) takes place at our Signal Iduna Park stadium."" Klopp is set to bring Germany squad member Kevin Grosskreutz back into the side after he was dropped recently. ""He can show on Wednesday that the break has done him some good,"" said Klopp. Klopp was not too downhearted by their Champions League draw against a side they beat in the 1997 Champions League final. ""We must throw everything we have into the game against Juventus, it's not the easiest opponent, but it could have been worse,"" said Klopp, who guided Dortmund to the 2013 Champions League final."

Dortmund qualified for the Champions League's last 16 as group winners ahead of Arsenal, but their dire domestic form this seaso has seen them win just four of their 15 Bundesliga matches. They are the only team in Germany's top flight to have lost nine matches having started December bottom of the table. Despite Saturday's defeat, Dortmund's fans applauded the squad after the final whistle at Berlin's Olympic Stadium and Klopp led his side to their fans' corner to acknowledge them. ""We need all the support we can get, we hear week after week that we are a great team, but this 'awesome' team also has awesome problems,"" admitted Klopp. ""The first half was the complete opposite of how we wanted to play. ""We weren't determined enough which is completely the wrong path to take in a game like this."" Klopp, who steered Borussia to the 2011 and 2012 Bundesliga titles, has a contract until 2018 and has been told his job is safe, but last season's runners-up were poor in Berlin. ""We're in a relegation battle, we've accepted the situation the way it is,"" admitted Klopp. Dortmund host second-placed Wolfsburg on Wednesday, then are away to fellow strugglers Werder Bremen next Saturday in the last game of the year before the Bundesliga breaks for the winter. ""We now have two games left to dramatically improve our league position in the second half of the season and that is our task,"" said Klopp. There was more bad news in Berlin as Armenia play-maker Henrikh Mkhitaryan came off after 35 minutes and could be ruled out of their last two games. ""He felt a sharp pain, which is not good when you have three games in a week, and it looks like he won't play again this year,"" said Klopp."

775,09/12/2014,22:40,Dortmund top group after Anderlecht draw,Borussia Dortmund finished atop their Champions League Group D on superior goal difference from Arsenal after a 1-1 draw against Anderlecht on Tuesday.,"Former Genoa and Torino striker Ciro Immobile, part of Italy's World Cup squad, struck in the 60th minute for Dortmund. Serbian Aleksandar Mitrovic equalised in the 84th minute for the Belgians in a game dominated by the home side. Dortmund, the 1997 Champions League winners, had already assured their progression to the knock-out round along with second-placed Arsenal who beat win-less Galatasaray 4-1 in Turkey on Tuesday and also finished on 13 points. Anderlecht go on to play in the Europa League in February. Both goalkeepers were called into early action of a first-half in which Dortmund dominated possession. Anderlecht's Silvio Proto was forced into a close-range save from Immobile while Dortmund's Australian 'keeper Mitchell Langerak came racing off his line in the 11th minute to block an effort from Mitrovic after the striker was put through on goal by Dennis Praet. Immobile again tested Proto after a neat one-two with Shinji Kagawa and the goalkeeper fended off an effort from Henrikh Mkhitaryan. As it turned out Sacha Kljestan almost handed the Belgians a surprise lead just before half-time but the American's shot drifted high. Immobile finally broke the deadlock with a well-taken goal, the Italian stepping back inside the defence and blasting past Proto from the edge of the area for his fourth goal of the campaign so far. The 24-year-old Italian kept testing Proto, the Belgian pressed into a smart double save and then pushing away a longer-range volley. With 10 minutes of regulation time to play, Mkhitaryan had a great chance to increase the lead but his curling shot went just over the Anderlecht bar. But a sloppy clearance saw Anthony Vanden Borre swing the ball in from the right flank for Mitrovic to head home from six metres in just their second shot on target."

Indeed, should they suffer what would be a surprise defeat against the Belgian champions at the Signal Iduna Park, Arsenal would be in a position to leapfrog them with a win at Galatasaray. Besnik Hasi's Anderlecht, who lost 3-0 at home to Dortmund in October when Adrian Ramos scored twice, have only pride left to play for as they are certain to finish third and parachute into the knockout stage of the Europa League. Dortmund warmed up for Tuesday's clash with a 1-0 win at home to Hoffenheim on Friday that saw them climb off the bottom of the table in the Bundesliga. Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan scored the only goal in a 1-0 win with a first-half header and veteran Sebastian Kehl called for another workmanlike display against the Belgians to further boost fragile confidence. ""We won't be suffessful for that one if we only play nice football,"" said the 34-year-old. ""We shouldn't leave the path we are on now. We were in the relegation places in the league, we've burst out of them, but now we have to take care. ""We have learnt that just playing nice football in the middle doesn't mean success,"" added Kehl, the former Dortmund skipper who was asked to fire up the side with the pre-match team-talk by current captain Mats Hummels, with Klopp later admitting the speech was delivered in ""unprintable"" language. Hummels will captain Dortmund after returning against Hoffenheim from a five-game absence due to a sprained ankle, while Klopp says he is yet to decide whether Australia goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak will keep his place between the posts after being prefered to Roman Weidenfeller against Hoffenheim. Anderlecht are second in the Belgian Pro League, but slumped to a 4-2 defeat at mid-table Mouscron-Peruwelz on Saturday with Congo defender Chancel Mbemba, who also netted an own goal, and Ivory Coast striker Cyriac scoring their goals."
777,06/12/2014,14:28,Dortmund call-up delights Socceroo Langerak,Australia goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak admits he was delighted to help Borussia Dortmund get off the bottom of the Bundesliga table having been chosen ahead of Germany squad member Roman Weidenfeller.,"The 26-year-old Socceroos shot-stopper made only his 22 appearance for Dortmund in Friday's 1-0 win over Hoffenheim as Ilkay Gundogan's 17th-minute header lifted his side from the bottom to 14th in the Bundesliga table. Despite reaching the Champions League's last 16, dire league form had seen Dortmund plummet to the bottom of the table after eight defeats in 13 games before Friday's victory. Langerak has been used as an understudy since joining Dortmund in 2010 and only previously played when World Cup-winner Weidenfeller had been either injured or rested, but he only found out he was starting on Friday morning. The Australian was given the nod by Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp ""to freshen up"" the side after doing some ""sensational things"" in training and Langerak kept a clean-sheet at Borussia's Westfalenstadion, even if he was surprised to play. ""I always have to be ready for it, but of course I was a bit nervous before the game, but when I'm on the pitch, the nerves are all forgotten and I have to concentrate,"" he said. ""Of course, it helps if the team is playing well, then I don't have that much to do, but of course, I'm very happy."" Langerak is used to late call-ups have replaced the injured Weidenfeller in the first half of the 2012 German Cup final when Dortmund romped to a 5-2 win over Bayern Munich in Berlin. Klopp has refused to say whether Langerak will keep his place for Tuesday's final Champions League group match at home to Anderlecht with Borussia already in the last 16 or next Saturday's league match at Hertha Berlin. ""I wanted the freshness and the fun Mitchell Langerak brings and it was a good decision to put him in goal,"" Klopp said of the ex-Melbourne Victory goalkeeper. ""Who will be in goal for the next game will be a gut decision again."""
778,05/12/2014,23:05,Dortmund down Hoffenheim to escape bottom three,Borussia Dortmund earned a 1-0 win over Hoffenheim on Friday to climb off the foot of the Bundesliga and escape the bottom three.,"Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan scored Dortmund's first-half winner which lifted them to 14th ahead of the weekend's other matches. This was a much more polished performance from Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund, who have already qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League but have been in poor form domestically. The victory offers last season's runners-up some respite after losing seven of their last 10 league games. It was only their fourth win in the league this season, 14 games into the campaign. ""The boys did really well from the beginning, it was a deserved win, but no more than that, it has to continue from here,"" said a relieved Klopp. ""The big thing to take is that we are able to score goals and not concede them,"" he added after Dortmund managed just two goals in their last four games. There was more good news for Borussia as their captain, German international centre-back Mats Hummels, made his return after missing the last five games with a sprained ankle. Hummels marked his return with a key clearing header at the start of the second half. The defeat leaves Hoffenheim still seventh in the table, but Markus Gisdol's side can have no complaints after managing just six shots at goal compared to Dortmund's 19. Klopp sprang a surprise before kick-off when he opted for Australian Mitchell Langerak over Germany's Roman Weidenfeller in goal. The Socceroos shot-stopper has been used as an understudy since joining Dortmund in 2010 and only previously played when World Cup-winner Weidenfeller had been either injured or rested. But with Dortmund having dropped to the bottom of the Bundesliga before kick-off, Klopp opted to give Langerak only his 12th appearance in the German top flight. Weidenfeller was left on the bench along with Japan's ex-Manchester United midfielder Shinji Kagawa. Klopp had described the Hoffenheim clash as 'High Noon' for his team as they looked to bounce back from a dire run of league results and his side were quickest on the draw. Gundogan, who only recently returned from a long-term back injury, scored his first goal since the 2013 Champions League final defeat to Bayern Munich when he headed home Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's cross after just 17 minutes. Gabon winger Aubameyang was unlucky not to get on the scoresheet himself as he had two goals disallowed for marginal offside calls and then hit the post in the second half. Dortmund's win sees Hamburg, who host Mainz on Sunday, drop to the bottom of the table."

But with Dortmund bottom of the Bundesliga after losing eight of their first 13 matches, Klopp opted to give Langerak only his 12th appearance in the German top flight with Weidenfeller left on the bench.

But Klopp says his side must show their mettle and has threatened to make changes against seventh-placed Hoffenheim with Dortmund having claimed only 11 from a possible 39 points. ""Friday is our High Noon. We have to show what we are made of,"" Klopp said in Wednesday's press conference. ""We are trying to find out in training who can withstand this situation and will make our selection accordingly."" With Dortmund already through to the Champions League's last 16, Klopp admits his side's problem comes down to attitude having lost to the likes of Hamburg, Cologne, Hanover 96 and Frankfurt, who Borussia would have comfortably beaten last season. Klopp is hoping to have his options boosted by the possible return of Poland winger Jakub Blaszczykowski and Dortmund captain Mats Hummels from a knee and sprained ankle injury respectively. Klopp has been given a job guarantee by Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke until his contract expires in 2018. The 47-year-old, who led Dortmund to the Bundesliga title in 2011 and 2012, as well as the 2013 Champions League final, has said he is 'responsible' for getting Borussia out of trouble and has vowed not to quit."

Last season's runners-up are suffering their worst ever start to a German league season and the 2013 Champions League finalists are the only team in Germany's top flight to have lost eight of their 13 matches. But when asked if he has thoughts of walking away, Klopp insisted he will stay, despite his side being whistled and booed after the final whistle. ""I can understand journalists have such thoughts, but things aren't heading that way, I am responsible for what is going on here,"" a visibly dejected Klopp, who is under contract until 2018, told Sky. ""If it was only a question of luck and a change of coach would make a difference, you only have to call me and I won't stand in the way. ""But as long as no-one comes to me and says 'we have someone who can do better', I simply can't leave. ""I am not standing in the way, but I simply can't go until there is a better solution. The responsibility is too big."" Having steered Dortmund to back-to-back German league titles in 2011 and 2012, including the club's first league and cup double, Klopp is facing the biggest test of his six-year reign. Frankfurt captain Alexander Meier claimed his eighth goal of the season to become the league's top scorer when he fired home with five minutes gone after team-mate Marco Russ split the Dortmund defence with a long-range pass. Then a poorly mis-timed header back from defender Matthias Ginter on 78 minutes compounded Dortmund's problems as it allowed Swiss striker Haris Seferovic to beat Borussia goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller in a sprint to tap the ball home. Dortmund had already dropped back to the bottom of the table on Saturday after both Werder Bremen and Stuttgart picked up wins. Werder Bremen's 4-0 hammering of Paderborn and VfB Stuttgart's 4-1 win at Freiburg on Friday saw them both leapfrog Dortmund."

The defeat sees Gladbach drop to fifth as Lucien Favre's side suffered their third straight defeat, despite having set a new club record of 18 matches unbeaten at the start of the season. Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund remain at the foot of the table after losing 2-0 at Eintracht Frankfurt as last season's runners-up continue to suffer the worst start to a league season in the club's history.

Werder Bremen's 4-0 hammering of Paderborn and VfB Stuttgart's 4-1 win at Freiburg on Friday saw them both leapfrog Dortmund. Bremen moved up to 14th as caretaker coach Viktor Skripnik picked up his fourth win in five games since taking over from the fired Robin Dutt as Zlatko Junuzovic, Davie Selke, Fin Bartels and Levent Aycicek scored. Pep Guardiola's Bayern maintained their iron grip on the Bundesliga title with a workmanlike 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin on Saturday to recover from their midweek defeat at Manchester City. Arjen Robben's first-half goal in Germany's capital was enough to give Bayern their 10th league win of the season in 13 games. After suffering their first defeat of the season at Manchester in the Champions League on Tuesday, their first loss in 23 games, the defending champions preserved their unbeaten Bundesliga record with a no-frills performance. With six months left of the season, Bayern's march to their third straight Bundesliga title looks virtually unstoppable once again. Both Schalke and Bayer Leverkusen roared back from midweek Champions League defeats by claiming heavy wins to go sixth and third respectively. Schalke responded to their 5-0 Champions League thrashing by Chelsea with a 4-1 hammering of Mainz at home with Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar claiming a hat-trick. Netherlands international Huntelaar fired Schalke into a 2-0 lead after just 25 minutes with two superb goals before Japan striker Shinji Okazaki pulled one back for the visitors. But Schalke made sure of the three points when midfielder Tranquillo Barnetta slotted home on 54 minutes before Huntelaar completed his hat-trick. Bayer Leverkusen put their Champions League defeat at home to Monaco behind them with a 5-1 comeback win at the BayArena against Cologne in the Rhine derby as both Josip Drmic and Karim Bellarabi scored twice. Hakan Calhanoglu added his team's other goal. Hoffenheim went seventh in the table after their seven-goal thriller, a 4-3 win over Hanover 96, who drop to eighth, as Niklas Suele headed what proved to be the home side's winner."
783,27/11/2014,02:00,Proud Wenger hits back at critics,Arsene Wenger celebrated Arsenal's progress to the last 16 of the Champions League by taking a swipe at the critics inside and outside the Emirates Stadium.,"Wenger found himself under siege in the run up to Wednesday's Champions League clash against Borussia Dortmund as a section of Arsenal's fanbase called for his sacking, while Alisher Usmanov, the club's second largest shareholder, went public with some stinging criticism of the Gunners manager. Wenger's club have endured their worst start to a domestic campaign for 30 years and another loss against Dortmund would have jeopardised Arsenal's hopes of qualifying from Group D and further increased the heat on the Frenchman. But Wenger was able to silence the doubters as Yaya Sanogo's first goal for the club was followed by a sublime Alexis Sanchez strike in a dominant 2-0 victory that ensured Arsenal will play in the knock-out stages of Europe's elite club competition for the 15th successive season. With a crucial victory in the bag, Wenger took the opportunity to underline his belief in his players and his lack of respect for those who question his methods. ""I don't try to think about other people. What is important is what we do inside the club. We are united,"" Wenger said. ""This team has a top quality attitude. We showed it in the game. We were determined and committed. ""We were a bit more under pressure because we lost on Saturday when we were a victim of our generous attitude going forward. Tonight we had more urgency to defend when we went 1-0 up. ""When you work in the football club you realise it is not easy to have consistency and I'm very proud of making it to the last 16 again. ""The club deserves a lot of credit as well, but it's not enough because we want more."" Wenger's decision to select inexperienced France Under-21 striker Sanogo instead of Germany international Lukas Podolski could have given the critics more ammunition if he had performed poorly. But he repaid Wenger's faith with a muscular effort that added a little more power than usual to Arsenal's attack. ""Sanogo played well, he protected the ball and won many challenges,"" Wenger said. ""He's a young boy, but he has presence and he's committed and very determined. That is vital up front."" Unfortunately for Wenger, Sanogo came off with a hamstring injury to join a growing injury list that also includes captain Mikel Arteta, who could be sidelined for several weeks with a calf problem suffered against Dortmund, Jack Wilshere, Danny Welbeck, Theo Walcott and Wojciech Szczesny. ""The injury situation is a problem because we have many games and now we have lost two more players,"" Wenger added. Despite the injuries, Wenger said he was likely to field the strongest possible team in the final group match at Galatasaray in a bid to catch leaders Dortmund, who have a two-point advantage heading into their last game against Anderlecht. ""I will try to win the last game because you never know, if Anderlecht win in Dortmund and we don't win we will say we are stupid. It is unlikely though. It is 90 percent we will finish second,"" Wenger added. Although Dortmund had already qualified for the last 16, boss Jurgen Klopp had been hoping for a more positive result as he looks to lift his team out their domestic rut. Dortmund are in terrible form in the Bundesliga and Klopp acknowledged it would take a reliance on hard work to get back on track. ""We will get out of this through work, that always does the trick in life,"" he said. ""We don't have parties between games, we always work on things, but it is a different feeling now, we have to admit that. ""We don't need perfect football, just better results. People don't want to hear it but that's the truth."""
784,26/11/2014,22:45,Arsenal down Dortmund to make last 16,Arsenal qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League for the 15th successive season as Yaya Sanogo's first goal for the club and a gem from Alexis Sanchez clinched a 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday.,"Arsene Wenger's side were desperately in need of a morale-boosting European victory after back-to-back defeats against Swansea and Manchester United left them well adrift in the Premier League title race. Those dispiriting losses prompted a section of Arsenal's support to call for Wenger's sacking, while stinging criticism of the Gunners boss from the club's second-largest shareholder Alisher Usmanov added to the impression of a season spiralling out of control. But Sanogo took less than two minutes to notch his first goal for Arsenal, in his 18th appearances since his free transfer from Auxerre in 2013, and a majestic second-half strike from Sanchez ensured the north Londoners, who had needed a point to go through from Group D, once again advanced to the knock-out stages of Europe's elite club competition. Their spirits lifted by a dominant display at the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal could still snatch top spot from Dortmund with a victory in their final group fixture at Galatasaray on December 9, providing the out-of-form Germans lose against Anderlecht. With Danny Welbeck ruled out with a knee injury and Olivier Giroud ineligible, Wenger gambled on the inexperienced Sanogo as his lone striker instead of Germany international Lukas Podolski. A poor performance would have given the critics more ammunition to attack Wenger, but it proved an inspired move as Sanogo put Arsenal ahead after just 73 seconds. The France Under-21 forward received possession with his back to his marker and showed tremendous confidence to juggle the ball and then flick it into Santi Cazorla's path Sanogo then turned and ran on to Cazorla's pass before guiding a cool finish under Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller. Dortmund held a training session on pitches normally used by part-time players in London's Regent's Park earlier in the day and Jurgen Klopp's team were guilty of some fairly amateurish defending as they allowed Sanogo another sight of goal which the youngster squandered with a hesitant touch. Injuries to Welbeck, Jack Wilshere, Wojciech Szczesny and Theo Walcott had ravaged Wenger's preferred starting line-up. And the Gunners still looked vulnerable on the rare occasions Dortmund attacked with purpose. Henrikh Mkhitaryan should have done better than poke tamely over from a good position and Wenger's team survived a penalty appeal when Kieran Gibbs caught Lukasz Piszczek. Emiliano Martinez, making only his fourth start in goal for Arsenal, had to preserve his side's lead with a good save to keep out Mkhitaryan's drive at the near post after Piszczek got behind Gibbs to nod down a lofted pass. Although Dortmund had already qualified for the last 16 after winning their first four group fixtures, they are in the midst of a terrible run in the Bundesliga and looked bereft of confidence and creativity once those chances were squandered. Sanchez nearly took advantage of their angst when the Arsenal winger was allowed to advance unchecked for a low shot that forced a good stop from Weidenfeller early in the second half. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain went even closer when he hit a dipping half-volley against the crossbar. Yet there was no need for Arsenal to rue those near-misses as Sanchez produced a moment of magic to double the lead and kill off the Germans in the 57th minute. Cazorla started the move with a crisp pass out to Sanchez on the left flank. And, with Dortmund backing off, the Chilean was able to cushion the ball with his first touch and shift it inside with his second before curling a sublime 20-yard effort beyond Weidenfeller for his 13th goal in just 20 appearances for the Gunners."

But Borussia are enduring the worst start to a league season in the club's history after losing seven of their first 12 games following a dire series of domestic results. Their 2-2 draw at Paderborn on Saturday left them 16th in the table and back amongst the relegation places. To compound their problems, Germany winger Marco Reus was ruled out of their next seven matches, until early January 2015, with his sixth ankle injury in the last 12 months. Watzke has demanded hard work from everyone at the club to help pick up points in their remaining Bundesliga games of 2014 against Eintracht Frankfurt, Hoffenheim, Hertha Berlin, Wolfsburg and Werder Bremen. ""Anyone who thinks they are here just to administer football is definitely in the wrong place,"" Dortmund's CEO told the club's Annual General Meeting in Dortmund on Monday. ""When you are 16th in the table, that means blood, sweat and tears. That is our path for the next few weeks."" Dortmund's participation in next season's Champions League is in dire jeopardy unless they finish in the top four of Germany's top flight or win the Champions League final in Berlin on June 6. But Watzke says the club will cope if they miss out on the multi-million dollar payday of competing in the 2015/16 Champions League and are debt free just a decade after being on the brink of bankruptcy. ""Should we not reach the Champions League, that would not be a turning point,"" insisted Watzke. ""There would only be a kink in our growth's momentum if we don't manage it."" Watzke says Dortmund can expect to return figures of 300 million euros ($373m) of turnover, having made 50 million euros profit in the 2012/2013 season from the transfer of Germany star Mario Goetze to Bayern Munich."
786,23/11/2014,14:42,Ankle injury sidelines Dortmund's Reus until 2015,"Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus will miss the rest of 2014, including Wednesday's Champions League clash at Arsenal, after suffering his sixth ankle injury in a year, the club confirmed Sunday.","The 25-year-old was stretchered off after tearing the ligaments in his right ankle following a foul by Paderborn's Marvin Bakalorz, who was later booked, after 66 minutes of Dortmund's 2-2 away draw on Saturday. It is Reus' sixth ankle injury in the last 12 months. Torn ligaments in his left ankle ruled Reus out of Germany's victorious World Cup campaign and he missed seven games after injuring the same ankle in the world champions' 2-1 win over Scotland in a Euro 2016 qualifier in September. ""We wish Marco a speedy recovery, no one can have such bad luck,"" Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said on Sunday. Dortmund have already qualified for the Champions League's knock-out phase with four straight wins before facing the Gunners, but are 15th in the Bundesliga after losing seven of their first 12 league games this season."

Dortmund are top of Group D, five points clear of second-placed Arsenal, and have already booked their place in the Champions League's last 16 with two games to spare before the Emirates Stadium clash."
788,21/11/2014,23:00,Klopp reveals Premier League interest,Borussia Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp has revealed he is keen on managing in the Premier League if he ever leaves Germany.,"Klopp has long been linked with a move to England, with Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal all said to have been keen on the German at various times. The 47-year-old is one of the most highly-regarded coaches in Europe and, with Dortmund struggling in the Bundesliga this season, his revelation that he is a big fan of English football is likely to lead to further speculation about his future. ""It's the only country, I think, where I should work, really, next to Germany, because it's the only country I know the language a little bit and I need the language for my work,"" Klopp said in an interview with BT Sport's SportsHUB programme. ""So we will see. If somebody will call me, then we will talk about it."" Klopp led Dortmund to back-to-back Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012, and to the Champions League final, where they were beaten by Bayern Munich at Wembley in 2013. He will be back in England on Wednesday when Dortmund face Arsenal in the Champions League."
789,20/11/2014,15:49,Troubled Dortmund welcome back Germany's Reus,"Germany winger Marco Reus has recovered from an ankle injury and is set to play for Bundesliga strugglers Borussia Dortmund at Paderborn on Saturday, according to his coach Jurgen Klopp.","Reus missed Germany's Euro 2016 qualifier win over Gibraltar last Friday and Tuesday's friendly win over Spain, but should return at Paderborn with Dortmund just above the relegation places after the worst league start in the club's history. ""Marco is free of pain and there's nothing to stop him playing on Saturday,"" said Dortmund boss Klopp. Reus strained an ankle ligament in Dortmund's 1-0 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach a fortnight ago which broke his side's five-match losing streak and lifted them out of the bottom three. Gabon winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang faces a race to be fully fit in time to face mid-table Paderborn after suffering from an upset stomach last week which restricted his training. In Paderborn, Klopp will definitely be without Germany centre-back Mats Hummels, who has a sprained ankle. The defender should return for Wednesday's Champions League clash at Arsenal however, with Dortmund top of their group after four straight wins. ""It's not healing as fast as we'd hoped,"" said Klopp, who will also be without midfielders Nuri Sahin, Jakub Blaszczykowski and Oliver Kirch in Paderborn, while defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos is suspended. The challenge facing Klopp and Dortmund in Paderborn is to prove their win over Gladbach, achieved only by Christoph Kramer's long-range own goal, was not a fluke. ""We recognise the difficulty of the task, but we are also conscious of our chances,"" added Klopp."
790,20/11/2014,11:49,Reus to Bayern talk doesn't bother Ribery,Bayern Munich veteran Franck Ribery says he is not concerned about the possible arrival of Germany winger Marco Reus at the Bavarian giants for next season.,"Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge last month drew attention to the release clause, worth 25 million euros, in Reus's Borussia Dortmund contract, which means the 25-year-old could join the Bavarian giants at the end of the season. But France winger Ribery says he would have no problem battling the Germany star for a place on Bayern's left wing. ""He's a good player, but I have been here for a while, even if I will be 32 (next April),"" Ribery told German magazine Kicker. ""I feel good, things are going well here. ""I'm still an important player, you still have to reckon with me here."" Ribery has won all possible trophies with Bayern since joining Munich in 2007. He was part of the team which won the treble of European, league and cup titles in 2013 and with Pep Guardiola's side currently four points clear in the table, they are on course to win a third straight Bundesliga title. ""I know what I have brought this club and what I can still bring to the side,"" said Ribery. ""I still want to win titles and want to work. I am still hungry."" With Ribery on Bayern's left flank and Arjen Robben on the right, the pair have been a potent attacking force for Guardiola's Bayern, but injuries means it is rare for them both to start together these days. ""When we're both 100 percent fit, that is a big advantage for the team,"" said Ribery. ""This is the best team I have ever been a part of. ""When everything runs like normal, we are hard to stop in the Bundesliga, but in Europe, Real Madrid could be a hindrance. ""We still have a few players missing like (Javi) Martinez, (Bastian) Schweinsteiger, Thiago (Alcantara), (Holger) Badstuber, now (Philipp) Lahm and (David) Alaba are also injured, but with them back, we will only improve."" Ribery has only just returned from a knee injury and was outstanding in creating two goals in Bayern's 4-0 league romp at Eintracht Frankfurt a fortnight ago. ""I was worried about a bit of a reaction on my knee, it's still not an easy thing for me,"" he added. ""I feel good, but the knee is not yet in top condition."" Ribery said his international career is over and ruled out a return to the France shirt having won 81 caps for Les Bleus between 2006 and 2014. ""For me, it's over with the national team and I enjoy the international break now,"" he said. ""I can look after my family and I, so as things are, it's going well for me."""
791,10/11/2014,16:36,Reus to miss Germany's Euro 2016 qualifier,Borussia Dortmund's Germany striker Marco Reus has been ruled out of Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar and the friendly away to Spain because of an ankle injury.,"Dortmund's team doctor revealed that Reus suffered ligament damage and bruising to his left ankle during Sunday's 1-0 Bundesliga win over Moenchengladbach. It is the second injury blow for Germany head coach Joachim Loew following that of Chelsea winger Andre Schuerrle. The 24-year-old Schuerrle, whose extra-time cross led to Mario Goetze's winning goal for Germany in July's World Cup final, battled an infection last month and has told Loew he will stay in London to work on his fitness during the international break. Schuerrle last played in Germany's shock 2-0 defeat against Poland last month, but missed the 1-1 draw with Ireland due to illness. That result left Germany third in their Euro 2016 qualifying group with Poland top and Ireland second. Reus, 25, missed Germany's World Cup triumph after suffering an ankle injury before their departure for Brazil. He had been expected to return to the squad after missing the first three Euro 2016 qualifiers but injured his ankle again at the start of September. Reus is expected to be back in action in two weeks.

Sokratis, 26, will miss the next league game at Paderborn on November 22 after also being forced to sit out Greece's Euro 2016 qualifier with the Faroe Islands on Friday and the friendly with Serbia four days later. However, a club statement said they hoped he would be fit to return for the Champions League match with Arsenal in London on November 26."
794,10/11/2014,02:20,Klopp hopes freak own goal can boost Dortmund,Jurgen Klopp said he hopes the freak own goal scored by Christoph Kramer to give Borussia Dortmund their first league win in almost two months can kick-start their season.,"Germany international Kramer's own-goal from almost halfway gifted Dortmund a 1-0 win at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday as the hosts earned their first win in eight league matches. The victory moved Dortmund off the foot of the table and up to 15th, and Klopp said he would gladly have that goal become a turning point for last season's runners-up. ""It's been such a long time without a win that I can hardly find the words,"" said Klopp, whose side have endured their worst ever start to a Bundesliga season. ""We have finally got into double figures in terms of points. ""If that turns out to be the win which opens the floodgates, then I'll take it. ""It was an exceptional game for such a situation. It was a deserved win and a great feeling."" Klopp spoke to Kramer on the pitch after the game and said he had both thanked and commiserated with the 23-year-old. ""Christoph Kramer unwittingly took his place in our little story, but he's an exceptional player and this goal will be just a side note in his life,"" added Klopp. ""It was a strange goal for him, but an important three points for us. ""We'll keep fighting and keep working, we need to enjoy this win, but there is still so much work left to do. However the win failed to mask another poor display of finishing from Dortmund, whose stunning European form bares little relation to their Bundesliga performances this season. Borussia again failed to transfer their stunning Champions League goal-scoring form, where they have banged in 13 in four games to reach the last 16, to the domestic matters. They failed to convert any of their 22 shots on goal, while restricting Gladbach to just a single chance, before Kramer's decisive error. The defensive midfielder misjudged a long-range back pass from near the halfway line which went straight over the head of his goalkeeper Yann Sommer on 58 minutes. Germany winger Marco Reus, who was outstanding throughout, almost made it 2-0 just moments later when his shot clattered the post. The defeat was Moenchengladbach's first of the season and left leaders Bayern Munich as the only unbeaten side in the Bundesliga. ""Dortmund deserved the win,"" admitted Gladbach coach Lucien Favre. ""They were better than us and created a lot more pressure. ""We were lucky that it was still 0-0 at the break. ""The goal came at an unlucky point in time for us as Dortmund didn't have so many big chances afterwards."" After Freiburg and Werder Bremen had both picked up wins on Saturday, Dortmund had dropped to last place for the first time in seven years, but Sunday's win gave them a valuable three points. The win came at a price, however, as centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos picked up his fifth yellow card of the season which means he is suspended for the away match at Paderborn in a fortnight. With captain Mats Hummels injured, Klopp will have to name a make-shift defence in that game."
795,08/11/2014,21:03,Seven-year low as Dortmund hit rock bottom,Borussia Dortmund went bottom of the Bundesliga for the first time in seven years on Saturday with Jurgen Klopp's team now desperate to avoid a sixth straight league defeat.,"Dortmund won the Bundesliga in 2011 and 2012 and were runners up in 2013 and 2014. Klopp's side dropped to 18th in the German table when Werder Bremen beat VfB Stuttgart 2-0 on Saturday, a result that lifted them off the bottom. Now rock-bottom Dortmund face a home game with high-flying Borussia Moenchengladbach, who are third, on Sunday. The last time that 2013 Champions League finalists Dortmund found themselves bottom of the Bundesliga was August 2007, while Klopp took charge in July 2008. Dortmund's dire domestic form is sharply contrasted by their European campaign having already qualified for the last 16 in the Champions League with two games to spare after four consecutive wins. Klopp is waiting on the fitness of his Germany stars, winger Marco Reus and goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who are suffering from gastroenteritis, while Gladbach who are on a club record run of 17 games unbeaten, welcome back Germany squad member Max Kruse from injury. Dortmund face Arsenal away and Anderlecht at home in their remaining Champions League Group D games and are five points clear of Arsene Wenger's Gunners."

But both Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller and winger Reus are struggling to be fit having been laid low with gastroenteritis. ""And the inflammation is very bad,"" added Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. Kruse, Weidenfeller and Reus, who has scored five goals in all competitions so far this season, were included in the Germany squad for next Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar on November 14 and the friendly away to Spain four days later. Dortmund are looking to transfer their excellent European form to their dire Bundesliga campaign after four straight wins in the Champions League compared to just two wins in 10 domestic league matches and seven points from a possible 30. Klopp says he wants another performance like Tuesday's 4-1 win over Galatasaray in Europe and less like Dortmund's below-par showing in league defeats to Hamburg, Cologne, Hanover and Schalke in recent weeks. ""We're planning on not showing so much of a difference, we want to build on Tuesday's performance,"" explained the 47-year-old. Gladbach coach Lucien Favre has included Kruse after the striker who sat out Thursday's Europa League win at Cyprus' Apollon Limassol with a leg knock. The guests are looking to set a new club record of 18 matches unbeaten since the start of the season. ""Dortmund are still a great team, even if they currently aren't getting good results in the league,"" said Swiss coach Favre. Both attacking midfielders Andre Hahn and Patrick Hermann, who scored their late second goal in the 2-0 win at Apollon, are fit having scored three goals between them in last Sunday's 3-1 league win over Hoffenheim."

Both clubs are being investigated for crowd disturbances with Dortmund coming under scrutiny for failing to prevent the fireworks being thrown on the pitch and ""a lack of organisation"". Galatasaray, who have already been fined 50,000 euros ($62,000) by UEFA after their fans lit flares in their defeat at Arsenal last month, now face heavier sanctions. Dortmund police announced on Wednesday that two officers were injured, 21 fans were arrested and 700 people were being investigated for a range of charges from attempted manslaughter, breach of the peace and possession of explosives. A total of 55 used fireworks were later found on the terraces in Dortmund and had been smuggled in by supporters despite strict security measures. According to the German club, Turkish fans destroyed around 250 seats at their Westfalenstadion ground which will cost the club 30,000 euros to replace."
798,05/11/2014,19:36,"Police injured, 21 arrests during Dortmund trouble",Dortmund police said Wednesday any football fans involved in the crowd trouble which marred Borussia Dortmund's Champions League win over Galatasaray will be severely punished.,"Two officers were injured, 21 arrests were made and some 700 Turkish fans are being investigated over their behaviour after Tuesday's match had to twice be halted due to crowd disturbances. Borussia Dortmund insist there were tight security checks, but 55 pyrotechnic items were later found on the terraces, which had been smuggled in by mainly Galatasaray fans. Dortmund police are investigating allegations of attempted manslaughter, breach of the peace and possession of explosives after Galatasaray fans threw fireworks onto the pitch and into the Dortmund fan enclosure in two separate incidents. ""The police have made it very clear that we will show consistent law enforcement,"" said police chief Gregor Lange at a press conference on Wednesday. ""We have to question whether the police were showed due respect in a very difficult situation. Lives were at risk."" Lange said there were ""criminal"" elements at the game and the police have already started arresting those later identified to have been involved. There was trouble before the game when a group of 1,000 Galatasaray fans set off fireworks while en route to the Westfalenstadion from Dortmund city centre. Two officers were injured and several fans were taken into custody during the disturbance and after the match riot police used batons and tear gas to prevent rival fans clashing. Around 250 seats were destroyed by away fans during the trouble which will cost Dortmund 30,000 euros (US$37,461) to replace. The 4-1 victory saw Dortmund qualify for the last 16 with two games to spare, but their coach Jurgen Klopp said the trouble overshadowed the win and described the Galatasaray fans actions as ""pure provocation"". Galtasaray, who are bottom of the group, could face being punished as European football's governing body UEFA are set to investigate."
799,04/11/2014,22:59,Dortmund rout Galatasaray to reach last 16,Borussia Dortmund brushed off their nightmare Bundesliga form to maintain their perfect Champions League record and book their place in the knock-out phase with Tuesday's 4-1 rout of Galatasaray.,"Dortmund are second from bottom of the league following the worst start to a season in the club's history after five straight defeats, but are one of the first teams into the last 16 in Europe. Borussia remain top of Group D with four wins and posted another heavy win over Cesare Prandelli's Galatasaray having won 4-0 in Istanbul a fortnight ago. Bizarrely, Dortmund have now picked up nearly double the points, 12, in their four Champions League matches than the seven they have from their 10 league matches. The game was held up twice in the second-half by crowd trouble as Galatasaray fans threw fireworks on to the pitch, then set off a flare in the stands in the closing few minutes. Goals either side of half-time from Germany midfielder Marco Reus and Greece defender Sokratis put 2013 Champions League finalists Dortmund into the knock-out phase. Galatasaray's Berlin-born defender Hakan Balta pulled one back for the visitors midway through the second-half before the hosts scored twice more to put the result beyond doubt. Italy striker Ciro Immobile netted Dortmund's third just three minutes and 26 seconds after coming off the bench to calm the hosts' nerves after a period of sustained Galatasaray pressure. Immobile then compounded Galatasaray's misery when his cross was deflected into the back of the Turkish giants' net by defender Semih Kaya. Dortmund have shown two distinctly different faces this season as another impressive display in Europe again bore little resemblance to their woeful league form. Marco Reus put Dortmund ahead when right-back Lukasz Piszczek spotted the Germany winger's run and put in a brilliant through-ball. Reus needed no second invitation to get behind the Galatasaray defence and put his side ahead on 39 minutes. Dortmund doubled their lead when veteran midfielder Sebastian Kehl rose highest to a corner and headed down for Greek centre-back Sokratis Papastathopoulos -- Sokratis for short. The 26-year-old scored his first Champions League goal with a half-volley from inside the six-yard box on 56 minutes. Balta put Galatasaray back in the match with a thumping header at the near post after a Wesley Sneijder corner on 70 minutes. But Reus made way for Immobile in a decisive substitution as the Italian claimed his third Champions League goal in three games. Galatasaray's brief period of pressure came to nothing as Immobile finished off a flowing move by Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The Italian got the ball in the net despite being fouled by Galatasaray goalkeeper Fernando Muslera on 74 minutes. Aubameyang then squandered two chances to add to the goal tally before Immobile struck again. Kaya could only watch in horror as Immobile's pass clipped his boot and span into his own net on 85 minutes. The result leaves Galatasaray bottom of the table with one point."
800,03/11/2014,19:44,Dortmund out to stop rot with Galatasaray tonic,Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp says the Bundesliga strugglers desperately need a Champions League win over Galatasaray on Tuesday to help get their season back on track.,"Borussia can secure their place in the knockout phase by beating Galatasaray in Dortmund having beaten them 4-0 in Istanbul a fortnight ago. The 2013 Champions League finalists are top of Group D having won their first three matches in style while Galatasaray are bottom of the table after two defeats and a draw. But Klopp says Dortmund particularly need a confidence-boosting win having lost their last five German league matches, including a 2-1 defeat at Bayern Munich on Saturday. Dortmund are enduring the worst start to a league season in the club's history to leave them second from bottom in the table. And another victory over Galatasaray in Europe would be a welcome tonic ahead of Sunday's Bundesliga clash with third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach. ""We have the opportunity to once again to celebrate that success feeling and get things back on track,"" said Klopp, who has been given a job guarantee by CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. ""We expect a strong Galatasaray team tomorrow, who want to improve increase their situation in the table and we'll be ready for that. ""We showed some positive developments against Bayern, even if we did not get a result, and we'll try to build on that. ""We want to try to keep working on things in the game tomorrow and then take advantage of it on Sunday."" Having won the 2011 and 2012 German titles, then finished runners-up for the last two seasons, Dortmund are in a crisis for the first time since Klopp took charge in 2008. ""Of course, the whole situation is not great right now,"" said veteran midfielder Sebastian Kehl. ""We talked about it for a long time on Sunday. ""I have the feeling that we, as players, much like the whole club, needs to stay calm, the situation is not hopeless. ""I don't think we are doing things that much differently in the league as we are in the Champions League, but we lack the concentration and the compactness."""

Dortmund beat Bayern to the 2011 and 2012 Bundesliga titles before Borussia romped to a 5-2 victory over the Bavarians in the 2012 German Cup final which led to Bayern signing Dortmund stars Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski. Bayern have been accused of a transfer policy which specifically weakens Dortmund, something chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge rejected last week, but Sammer says Munich are just making sure they are Germany's top team. ""We are in a fierce competition, which we lost in 2012,"" Bayern's director of sport explained to Sky Sports. ""Bayern are striving to be number one. ""At the moment, things aren't of optimal circumstance between the clubs, but that is the fault of top-level sport. Everyone wants to be number one."" After the 2012 German Cup final defeat, Bayern roared back by defeating Dortmund in the 2013 Champions League final and have won the Bundesliga, with Borussia as runners-up, in record time for the last two seasons. After Bayern signed play-maker Goetze, then striker Lewandowski in the last two seasons, Borussia's Germany winger Marco Reus is the latest Dortmund star to be linked to a big-money move to Munich's Allianz Arena. Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke was annoyed when Rummenigge recently revealed Reus has a release clause in his contract which allows him to leave Borussia at the end of the season. But Sammer says both sides have not always acted fairly towards each other. ""Individual events from both sides were not okay, no question,"" said Sammer. ""There is too much discussion at the moment of a strained relationship, but this discussion about any acrimony is totally unnecessary."""
802,03/11/2014,02:30,Downcast Dortmund eye European knock-out berth,Borussia Dortmund are chasing both a place in the Champions League's knock-out phase and a confidence-boosting victory to remedy their dire domestic form when they host Galatasaray on Tuesday.,"Dortmund have dazzled in Europe this season with an average of three goals per game to top Group D ahead of Arsenal with three straight wins and a perfect nine points. Borussia have beaten Arsenal 2-0 at home, defeated Anderlecht 3-0 in Belgium, then downed Galatasaray 4-0 in Istanbul a fortnight ago. A fourth consecutive win on Tuesday will confirm their place in the last 16. The 2013 Champions League finalists' European form contrasts sharply to their nightmare Bundesliga run where they have dropped into the relegation zone, struggling in 17th place after the worst start to a league season in the club's history. Dortmund have lost their last five domestic games after being beaten 2-1 by league leaders Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena on Saturday. With nearly a third of the season gone, they are already ten points from qualifying for a Champions League place next season, which demands a top-three finish. To exacerbate matters, Dortmund host Galatasaray without captain Mats Hummels after the Germany centre-back suffered a sprained ankle in Munich. His place in the back-four is likely to go to Neven Subotic, his replacement at Bayern. The Serbia international says Dortmund desperately need a morale-boosting win as much as three more Champions League points before they host third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach next Sunday in the Bundesliga. Subotic also has a point to prove on Tuesday as his two errors led to Bayern's goals by Robert Lewandowski before he fouled Franck Ribery in the area for the late penalty which Arjen Robben converted. ""That is the next opportunity to show everyone that we can do better,"" said Subotic. ""In the Bundesliga, our mission at Bayern failed because of two blunders from me. ""We need to regain some self-confidence for the home game against Borussia Moenchengladbach next Sunday so we can hold our heads high."" Group D bottom side Galatasaray warmed up for their trip to Germany by coming from behind to seal a 2-1 win at home to Kasimpasa on Friday, less than a week after the Turkish Super League leaders conceded four goals in a game for the third time this season when they lost 4-0 at Istanbul Basaksehir. Cesare Prandelli-coached Galatasaray have an impressive record in Germany, winning as many games (five) as they have lost, with the other three fixtures ending in draws. But the Turkish giants have just a point from their first three games and must win in Dortmund to keep alive their slim chances of repeating last year's feat of reaching the knock-out stage having also made the quarter-finals in 2012/13."
803,03/11/2014,02:14,Trio look to clinch Champions League knockout berths,"Reigning champions Real Madrid, Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund can all qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday. AFP Sports looks at the fixtures in Groups A, B, C and D:","Group A MALMO V ATLETICO MADRID (1945 GMT) Atletico can close in on a place in the last 16 with a third consecutive win in Group A when they go to Sweden to face the section's bottom club. The reigning Spanish champions have won their last four games, including a 5-0 thumping of Malmo two weeks ago and a 4-2 defeat of Cordoba on Saturday which featured a brace from Antoine Griezmann and lifted them within a point of top spot in La Liga. With Tiago Mendes fit again, Atletico coach Diego Simeone has a full squad at his disposal. Malmo had already wrapped up the Swedish title before the season finished at the weekend. Their only points so far in Group A came in their only previous home match, when they beat Olympiakos 2-0. JUVENTUS V OLYMPIAKOS (1945 GMT) This encounter in Turin has the makings of a decisive encounter. Juve are three points clear at the top of Serie A but have struggled to transform their domestic form onto the European stage and were beaten 1-0 at Olympiakos in their last outing. Having collected just three points from three games in Group A, Massimiliano Allegri's side will be staring elimination in the face if they suffer another defeat at home to the Greek title-holders, and their situation would not be helped if Atletico were to win in Malmo. However, Arturo Vidal remains confident, saying: ""We are in great shape and the game against Olympiakos is like a final. Getting through to the next round is our minimum objective."" Olympiakos have lost their last three away games in the competition and went down 7-0 when they last visited Juve in 2003. Group B BASEL V LUDOGORETS RAZGRAD (1945 GMT) Second place behind Real Madrid appears to be up for grabs in Group B after Ludogorets beat Basel 1-0 last time out. Now the sides meet again in Switzerland, where Paulo Sousa's side have a good record in Europe, including beating Liverpool last month. The Swiss champions and league leaders are without the injured Marco Streller and the banned Geoffroy Serey Die but Marcelo Diaz can play after serving a suspension. Ludogorets must do without the suspended Yordan Minev, the scorer of the late winner in the reverse fixture in Sofia. REAL MADRID V LIVERPOOL (1945 GMT) Reigning European champions Madrid will qualify for the last 16 with a victory at home to Liverpool, who they outclassed 3-0 at Anfield two weeks ago. Few would bet against Carlo Ancelotti's side recording another comfortable win at the Santiago Bernabeu given the respective form of the two sides just now. Real turned on the style to win 4-0 at Granada on Saturday, their 11th consecutive win taking them top of La Liga. Gareth Bale, who has sat out his side's last five games with a pelvic muscle injury, has returned to training too, meaning Madrid look in rude health just now as they look to extend their 18-game unbeaten run at home in the Champions League. In contrast, Liverpool need a boost after a 1-0 defeat at Newcastle United in the Premier League on Saturday. They have lost their last two group games and another defeat on Tuesday would seriously compromise their chances of reaching the knockout stage. However, manager Brendan Rodgers has urged his side to dig deep, saying: ""I think we have demonstrated character in this team over the last 18 months -- and, of course, when you are not playing as well, then that is sometimes what you have to rely on."" Group C ZENIT ST PETERSBURG V BAYER LEVERKUSEN (1700 GMT) While Zenit are flying at home, the meeting with Bayer Leverkusen at the Petrovski Stadium could be decisive for them. Andre Villas-Boas's side are unbeaten in the Russian Premier League this season and their 1-0 win at CSKA Moscow on Saturday saw them move seven points clear atop the table. However, having lost 2-0 when the teams clashed in Germany a fortnight ago, another defeat Tuesday would leave them five points behind the Bundesliga side in Group C. Leverkusen top the section, but warmed up for the trip to chilly Russia by losing 1-0 at Hamburg, their first loss in nine games. BENFICA V AS MONACO (1945 GMT) Neutrals will be hoping for a more entertaining game than the goalless draw these sides played out two weeks ago as they clash again in Lisbon. Benfica, meanwhile, need a win at all costs as they currently sit at the foot of Group C with just one point. An obstinate Monaco are second and have yet to concede a goal in the competition. Their Portuguese coach Leonardo Jardim returns to familiar territory having been in charge along the road from the Estadio da Luz at Sporting last season. His current team have lost only one of their last 10 outings but are still without injured striker Dimitar Berbatov. Group D ARSENAL V ANDERLECHT (1945 GMT) It has not been an entirely convincing start to the season for Arsenal, even if they have lost just one of their last seven games. A dramatic late turnaround saw the Gunners win 2-1 in Belgium two weeks and now they face Anderlecht in the reverse fixture at the Emirates Stadium knowing that another victory will see them secure their place in the last 16, provided Galatasaray do not beat Borussia Dortmund. Wojciech Szczesny can return in goal for Arsenal after he missed the trip to Brussels due to a ban, leaving Argentine youngster Emiliano Martinez to take his place. Anderlecht may top the Belgian league but they have a young side and have suffered seven defeats in their last eight meetings with English opponents. BORUSSIA DORTMUND V GALATASARAY (1945 GMT) Dortmund will once again hope to find solace in the Champions League as they endure a dreadful start to the season in the Bundesliga. A 2-1 loss at Bayern Munich on Saturday was their seventh in 10 games and left them in the relegation zone. In contrast, they have won all three Group D games to date and will qualify for the last 16 with another win. Cesare Prandelli's Galatasaray have so far struggled in Europe this season but the Turkish giants can point to an impressive recent record away to German opponents, with four wins from their last six games."
804,02/11/2014,20:02,"No love lost between Bayern, Dortmund bosses","Germany's Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund are riding high as they return to Champions League action this week, but relations between the Bundesliga giants' bosses are at an all-time low.","Pep Guardiola's Bayern fought back to secure a 2-1 win over Dortmund in Munich on Saturday. Borussia are now second from bottom in the table as they endure the worst start to a league season in the club's history. Like Bayern, Dortmund top their Champions League group with three straight wins and, similarly to the Bavarians, a fourth straight win will put Jurgen Klopp's team in the last 16 of Europe when they host Galatasary on Tuesday. Bundesliga leaders Bayern are home to Roma on Wednesday, but Dortmund left Munich's Allianz Arena on Saturday with Borussia's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke accusing Bayern's chairman Harl-Heinz Rummenigge of lacking respect. Speculation is rife as to whether Germany winger Marco Reus will take the well-worn path from Dortmund to Bayern as Borussia face the prospect of losing their top player to Bayern for the third year running. The 25-year-old Reus is under contract at Dortmund until 2017, but Rummenigge recently publically highlighted a release clause in his current deal which would allow him to leave next June. Bayern have lured play-maker Mario Goezte, then striker Robert Lewandowski, who scored Saturday's equaliser for Bayern in his first game against his former club, away from Dortmund in the last two seasons. The prospect of seeing another star quitting Dortmund for the bright lights of the Allianz Arena would clearly be a third bitter pill to swallow. ""The two clubs who have shaped German football in recent years must find a reasonable basis to work from,"" Watzke told Sport1's football show 'Doppelpass' on Sunday. ""I would never comment on the contract details of a Bayern player. That's something you just don't do. ""It's legitimate to want to have Marco, but you don't have to permanently make comments in the public domain about it. ""He's our player and I expect some respect, which you can do on a certain level."" Rummenigge had previously insisted Bayern's transfer policy is to strengthen their team rather than weaken any rivals. ""We don't have to weaken anybody. Every transfer has exclusively one goal: to strengthen the team's quality,"" Rummenigge wrote in Saturday's match programme. But Watzke insists Bayern have ""come a long way"" in weakening Dortmund after Borussia won the 2011 and 2012 German league titles, before Bayern bounced back by dominating for the last two seasons. With nearly a third of the season gone, Dortmund are already 10 points off the pace in their ambition of a top-three finish to guarantee next season's Champions League place. Watzke says can potentially cope without the minimum pay out for playing in next year's Champions League's group phase, worth 8.6m euros (US$10.7M) this season, and he insists they will bounce back. ""We are economically so strong that we will make no compromises, we will march on and attack again,"" he said. The Dortmund boss also insisted coach Jurgen Klopp has a job guarantee until his contract expires in June 2018. While Lewandowski has backed his former club to recover and qualify for the Champions League, fellow goal-scorer Robben has no sympathy for Dortmund's plight. ""I don't think they'd have any sympathy for us (if the situation was reversed),"" said Robben, who scored his sixth goal in six games against Dortmund. ""We don't need to sympathise with them, they're a top team despite their league position. I have no doubt they'll work their way back up the table."""
805,02/11/2014,14:28,Injured Hummels out of Galatasaray clash,"Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels will miss Tuesday's Champions League clash against Galatasaray as he faces three weeks on the sidelines with a sprained ankle, the club said Sunday.","Hummels limped off at half-time in Dortmund's 2-1 defeat at Bayern Munich on Saturday, but a scan revealed he has only sprained an ankle. The Germany defender will miss Tuesday's clash at home to Galatasaray where a fourth straight Group D win would put Dortmund into the knock-out phase. Hummels will also miss Germany's Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar in Nuremberg on November 14 and the friendly away to Spain in Vigo four days later. ""There is a ligament strain, which should allow him to return again in three weeks and is much better than we feared,"" said Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. But with seven points in their first ten league games, Dortmund are enduring the worst start to a Bundesliga season in the club's history. Their defeat in Munich left Borussia 16th in the table and amongst the relegation places after five consecutive losses. Dortmund will be without their captain for the home league match against Borussia Moenchengladbach next Sunday and the trip to Paderborn on November 22. Hummels should return at the latest against Eintracht Frankfurt on November 30, but faces a race against time to be fit for Borussia's European away match at Arsenal on November 26."
806,01/11/2014,22:26,Dortmund's Hummels struggling for Galatasaray,Mats Hummels faces a fitness battle ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash against Galatasaray after the Borussia Dortmund captain injured his foot in their 2-1 defeat at Bayern Munich.,"The Germany centre-back limped off at half-time at Munich's Allianz Arena on Saturday. Marco Reus' first-half header for Dortmund was cancelled out by Robert Lewandowski's second-half strike and Arjen Robben's late penalty for Bayern. The defeat leaves Dortmund 16th in the league as they endure the worst start to a Bundesliga season in the club's proud history after seven points from ten games and five straight defeats. In contrast, Dortmund have won all three of their Champions League games so far, including a 4-0 romp at bottom side Galatasaray last month to leave them top of Group D. Another win over the Turkish giants at Borussia's Westfalenstadion on Tuesday will put Dortmund in the Champions League's knock-out phase, but Hummels faces a race to be fit. ""It doesn't look good,"" said coach Jurgen Klopp. ""Mats limped past me in the dressing room with a bandage on his foot. ""He said he felt pain after jumping for the ball, we'll know more after a scan."""
807,01/11/2014,22:06,Lewandowski backs defeated Borussia to bounce back,"Robert Lewandowski netted in Bayern Munich's 2-1 win over Borussia Dortmund on Saturday, but then backed his ex-club to bounce back from their worst start to a Bundesliga season.","Lewandowski's 72nd-minute strike at Munich's Allianz Arena cancelled out Marco Reus' first-half header for Dortmund before Arjen Robben converted a late penalty for league leaders Bayern. Bayern preserved their unbeaten record to stay four points clear at the top while Dortmund are now 16th and amongst the relegation places after five straight league defeats. With seven points from their first ten games, last season's runners-up are enduring the worst start in the club's history, but Lewandowski said they can turn it around. ""We have maintained our lead in the table and it was an important day for me,"" said the Poland striker who left Dortmund at the end of last season. ""Even if Dortmund is in a difficult situation now, Borussia will eventually end up again in the Champions League."" Franck Ribery made the difference for Bayern as the French winger came off the bench and used his pace against Dortmund defender Neven Subotic. ""It's very annoying that we lost because of two mistakes from me,"" fumed Subotic, who replaced captain Mats Hummels at the break. Ribery played a part in the attack which led to Lewandowski's goal by out-sprinting Subotic and the Serbia international then fouled Ribery for the penalty which Robben converted. ""Franck really helped us after he came on,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. ""I wanted him to run at Subotic and show his strength in one-on-ones. We also found solutions to a few problems in the first-half, which Xabi Alonso covered. ""I think we will always find solutions in such situations. We've very, very happy with the result."" Despite their dreadful league form, Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund have three straight wins in the Champions League and another win over Galatasaray on Tuesday will put them in the knock-out phase. But Borussia's lack of domestic self-confidence is a real concern for Klopp, whose side face high-flying Borussia Moenchengladbach in their next league match. ""It's tough, because we invested a lot, played the best first-half for a long time, and still we have nothing to show for it,"" said an emotional Klopp. ""We have to swallow it, even if the pressure was ultimately too great and the defeat wasn't undeserved. ""We have a lot of things to work on, we just need to get the rewards for when we play well, as we've shown again."" There was more bad news for Klopp, who lost his captain and Germany centre-back Hummels at half-time with a foot injury and faces a race against time to be fit for Galatasaray. ""It's not looking so good for Mats Hummels,"" admitted Klopp."
808,01/11/2014,21:03,Bayern's Robben extends Dortmund's losing streak,"Arjen Robben converted a late penalty on Saturday as Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich claimed a 2-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund, who have now lost their last five league matches.","The defeat leaves Dortmund 16th in the table and amongst the relegation places as Robben scored his sixth goal in his last six games against Borussia to add to their misery. With seven points from their first ten Bundesliga games it is the worst start to a league season in Dortmund's history. They are also the only team in Germany's top flight to have lost seven games this season. ""It's tough. We invested a lot and played the best 1st half for a long time and still got nothing, but the defeat wasn't undeserved,"" admitted Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. Marco Reus gave Dortmund a first-half lead only for Bayern's striker Robert Lewandowski to score against his old club before Robben converted an 85th-minute penalty. ""We've kept our lead in the league, it was a big day for me,"" said Lewandowski. ""Borussia are in a tough situation, but they will end up in the Champions League again next season, I am sure."" The Allianz Arena clash got off to a frantic start as Robben and Dortmund's Henrikh Mkhitaryan both clipped the woodwork in the opening five minutes. Reus, who Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has admitted Munich want to sign at the end of the season, headed home an inch-perfect Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang cross on 31 minutes. But with the lion's share of possession, Bayern battered the Dortmund defence and their goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller kept Borussia in the match with a string of saves. The hosts drew level when Lewandowski snapped up a loose ball on the edge of the area and drove his shot inside the far post on 72 minutes. Robben then broke Dortmund hearts when he converted a penalty after Borussia centre-back Neven Subotic held back Bayern wing Franck Ribery in the area. Robben returned to haunt Dortmund having scored the winner in the 2013 Champions League final and he also netted in Bayern's 2-0 extra-time win over Dortmund in May's German Cup final in Berlin. The win keeps Bayern four points clear and there is now a huge 17-point gap between Munich and Dortmund in the table. Earlier, VfL Wolfsburg climbed to second with a 4-0 hammering of VfB Stuttgart as ex-Chelsea midfielder Kevin de Bruyne shone. De Bruyne netted his first goal of the season and created another two as Wolves picked up their sixth straight win in all competitions. The 23-year-old provided a free-kick for Robin Knoche to head Wolves into a 2-0 lead at the break after Croatia international Ivan Perisic's opening goal for the guests. Belgium's de Bruyne then volleyed home from close range on 48 minutes before robbing Moritz Leitner of possession and providing Perisic with his second goal on 88 minutes. A Rafael van der Vaart penalty sealed Hamburg's 1-0 win at home to Bayer Leverkusen which lifted the hosts out of the bottom three. Hamburg won a bad-tempered affair which saw nine yellow cards -- six were handed out in the first half alone -- after two separate scuffles broke out. Freiburg, who are at Cologne on Sunday, went bottom of the table after Werder Bremen moved up to 17th as caretaker coach Viktor Skripnikas got their first win of the season. Ex-Chelsea and Wigan striker Franco di Santo netted both goals in a 2-1 victory over Mainz. Hanover 96 went sixth with a 1-0 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt. Borussia Moenchengladbach can reclaim second and equal the club's 40-year-old record of 17 games unbeaten when they host Hoffenheim, who have also yet to lose this season, on Sunday. On Friday, Roberto di Matteo picked up his third win in four matches as Schalke 04 coach as Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored their first-half winner in a 1-0 victory at home to Augsburg. The result masked a poor performance from the Royal Blues who have moved up from 12th to seventh in the table since di Matteo took over from Jens Keller."
809,31/10/2014,14:49,Guardiola wary of Dortmund despite points gulf,Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola insists Saturday's Bundesliga opponents Borussia Dortmund remain the Bavarians' main title rivals despite the 14-point gulf between the teams in the table.,"Dortmund are 15th after four consecutive league defeats and a fifth at the hands of leaders Bayern at Munich's Allianz Arena would confirm the worst start to a league season in Borussia's history. Bayern are already four points clear at the top of the table after nine matches and on course to win the German league title for a third consecutive season. But Guardiola says Dortmund remain the team for Bayern to beat after Jurgen Klopp's side finished second to the Bavarians in the past two seasons and enjoyed a 3-0 win in Munich in April when the teams last met in the league. ""At the moment, Borussia Dortmund are still our main rivals, the gap in the table doesn't mean anything in October,"" said Guardiola on Friday. ""I don't look at the situation in the table. My opinion is that they are a superior team, regardless of their current situation. ""We will be playing against Dortmund's best team."" Guardiola refused to be drawn into the war of words between Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke and Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who has expressed an interest in signing Borussia's Germany winger Marco Reus. ""I know the game is very important for our fans and the club, and that is also the case in Dortmund, but I am the coach and the background noise means nothing to me,"" insisted Guardiola. ""It's all about football and that is the reason I am here. I don't give a second's thought about anything else."" Guardiola said his side will not change their tactics of playing deep in the opponents' half, with goalkeeper Manuel Neuer often well out of his area, a style which could suit Dortmund's counter-attacking game. ""Our style of play is great for them, we play 40 metres in front of Manuel Neuer,"" said Guardiola. ""No, I'm sorry. I always like my team to play forwards -- ever since my first match with Barcelona B."" The Bayern boss also said Netherlands winger Arjen Robben faces a race against time to be fit after missing their last two matches with a leg injury. ""He's a bit better in the last two days, but he's still not 100 percent."""
810,31/10/2014,14:15,Bayern not out to weaken Dortmund - Rummenigge,"On the eve of their Bundesliga showdown, Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has insisted his club are not trying to weaken rivals Borussia Dortmund by attempting to sign Marco Reus.","Bayern host Dortmund at Munich's Allianz Arena on Saturday with Borussia having finished second to the Bavarians for the last two seasons. But Dortmund currently lag 14 points behind leaders Bayern and are 15th in the table after four consecutive defeats -- one of the worst starts to a league season in the club's history. And there is also bad blood between the clubs' senior bosses. Bayern have signed stars Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski from Dortmund in the last two years and Rummenigge had stirred further tensions by revealing Borussia's Germany winger Reus is their next target. He has drawn attention to the release clause in Reus's Dortmund contract, which runs until 2017, but Rummenigge insists Bayern are not out to weaken Dortmund's squad. ""We don't have to weaken anybody. Every transfer has exclusively one goal: to strengthen the team's quality,"" Rummenigge wrote in Saturday's match programme. Rummenigge also pointed out that if Bayern signed Reus they would only be copying the actions of Dortmund, who signed the 25-year-old from Borussia Moenchengladbach at the end of the 2011/12 season by activating his buy-out clause. Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke has made his feelings clear about Rummenigge's interest in Reus, while the player has said his only priority currently is to leave Munich with three points for Dortmund. ""There was simply no need for him to have said anything, but that is not his style,"" said Watzke. Traditionally, senior figures from the rival teams dine together before a Bundesliga match, but that will not be the case on Saturday. ""There is no invitation, so I don't have to turn it down,"" revealed Watzke. ""We don't have any sort of relationship and we don't have to. He's responsible for Bayern Munich, as I am for Dortmund. So there is nothing we have to do together."" Watzke said he preferred dealing with Bayern's former president Uli Hoeness, who is currently serving a three-and-a-half-year prison sentence for tax evasion. ""I always had a very exciting relationship with Uli Hoeness, who I really miss, because he was someone who came at you straight on and with an open visor,"" said Watzke. ""You could argue with him, but you always knew where you stood with him -- that's something I personally always really liked."""

And we want to start in Munich,"" said Grosskreutz. Bayern host Dortmund with the teams having shared the last four league titles between them, but Borussia have been rocked by four straight league defeats -- their worst sequence of Bundesliga results in 15 years. Just two wins in their opening nine league games leaves last season's runners-up languishing in 15th place in the table, a staggering 14 points behind league leaders Bayern. But Dortmund have won three of their last four league matches at Bayern and Munich captain Philipp Lahm insists Jurgen Klopp's side are still a ""threat"". To up the ante, Dortmund will have the worst start to a Bundesliga season in the club's history confirmed by a fifth consecutive defeat on Saturday. Bayern hope to include Dutch winger Arjen Robben after he missed the last two matches with a leg injury, while Dortmund are set to name Japanese midfielder Shinji Kagawa who has a 100 percent record in his four matches against Munich. Dortmund-Bayern clashes have been dubbed Germany's 'Klassiker' in recent years, but Borussia coach Klopp is currently in the biggest crisis of his six-year reign. He has refused to make any bold declarations ahead of the Munich clash, even though Dortmund trounced last season's champions 3-0 on their last visit to the Bavarian capital in April when Pep Guardiola's side had already won the title. ""We're not entitled to anything at the moment, but we will try everything,"" said Klopp. There is bad blood between Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Dortmund with the Bavarian giants reported to be interested in signing Dortmund's Germany winger Marco Reus. Bayern have signed both World Cup winner Mario Goetze and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski from Dortmund in the last two seasons and Rummenigge has said he is fully aware Reus has a release clause in his contract. ""He could have just said nothing, but that is not his personal style, and so he just goes on and on,"" complained Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. Second-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach host Hoffenheim, who are fourth, on Sunday in a meeting between two of the league's three remaining unbeaten teams. Gladbach can match their 17-game unbeaten record from 1970/71 by avoiding defeat, while Hoffenheim are reaping the reward for rebuilding their squad over the summer and are proving to be a hard team to break down. On Friday, ex-Chelsea coach Roberto di Matteo attempts to claim his third win in four matches since taking charge of Schalke when they host mid-table Augsburg. Fixtures (1430 GMT unless stated)"

In contrast, Pep Guardiola's Bayern are four points clear and unbeaten as they prepare to host their rivals in Germany's 'Klassiker' at Munich's Allianz Arena with 14 points separating the teams. Both Dortmund and Bayern top their respective Champions League groups with three straight wins, but after Dortmund romped to a 3-0 league win at Munich's Allianz Arena in April, Lahm is taking nothing for granted. ""It's a meeting between two sides that have spent the last few years contesting the title,"" he said. ""Dortmund have shown their true selves in the Champions League with nine points from three games. ""They're a real threat to us."" Bayern beat Dortmund 2-0 in May's German Cup final in Berlin the last time the teams met, but Borussia romped to a 3-0 win in Munich in their last league meeting. Dortmund captain Mats Hummels described the Bayern game as a ""tasty task"". ""If there is one game when we can get some self-confidence, it's the game against Bayern,"" said Hummels. And veteran midfielder Sebastian Kehl says Dortmund can win in Munich, providing they shake off their lack of league goals, having scored just four in their last six Bundesliga games. ""We have always looked good against Bayern and we can again, if we play compact and have a bit of luck,"" said Kehl. ""But most of all we must have the will to score a goal in the league.""

813,30/10/2014,15:02,Lahm: Dortmund still a 'threat' to Bayern,"Borussia Dortmund will still pose a threat to Bayern Munich when the rivals meet in the Bundesliga on Saturday, despite their four-match losing streak, Bayern captain Philipp Lahm believes.","Having finished second to Bayern in the league for the last two years, Dortmund have endured their worst start to a league season for 27 years and are 15th in the table with just two wins from their opening nine games. In contrast, Pep Guardiola's Bayern are four points clear and unbeaten as they prepare to host their rivals in Germany's 'Klassiker' at Munich's Allianz Arena with 14 points separating the teams. Both Dortmund and Bayern top their respective Champions League groups with three straight wins, but after Dortmund romped to a 3-0 league win at Munich's Allianz Arena in April, Lahm is taking nothing for granted. ""It's a meeting between two sides that have spent the last few years contesting the title,"" he said. ""Dortmund have shown their true selves in the Champions League with nine points from three games. ""They're a real threat to us."" Bayern beat Dortmund 2-0 in May's German Cup final in Berlin the last time the teams met, but Borussia romped to a 3-0 win in Munich in their last league meeting. Dortmund captain Mats Hummels described the Bayern game as a ""tasty task"". ""If there is one game when we can get some self-confidence, it's the game against Bayern,"" said Hummels. And veteran midfielder Sebastian Kehl says Dortmund can win in Munich, providing they shake off their lack of league goals, having scored just four in their last six Bundesliga games. ""We have always looked good against Bayern and we can again, if we play compact and have a bit of luck,"" said Kehl. ""But most of all we must have the will to score a goal in the league."" Borussia warmed up for their trip to Munich by beating Hamburg's St Pauli 3-0 away in the second round of the German Cup. ""The victory was important for Saturday, we want to annoy Bayern,"" said Dortmund's Germany international Kevin Grosskreutz."
814,25/10/2014,17:43,Dortmund slip further after fourth defeat,Borussia Dortmund's horror run of Bundesliga results continued on Saturday as they lost 1-0 at home to ten-man Hanover 96 to drop to 15th after a fourth straight defeat.,"Dortmund's terrible Bundesliga form is in stark contrast to their Champions League campaign, where they top their group with three straight wins after Wednesday's impressive 4-0 victory at Galatasaray. But seven days before they face Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich away, Dortmund are now winless in their last six league games and just a point above the relegation zone. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp was left fuming on the sidelines at their Westfalenstadion as Japan's Hiroshi Kiyotake curled in a free kick to score Hanover's first goal for 416 minutes following three straight defeats. Mid-table Hanover finished with 10 men after Turkey midfielder Ceyhun Guelselam earned a red card for his second booking of the game after a clumsy challenge on Dortmund wing Marco Reus on 89 minutes. Hertha Berlin's 3-0 win at home to Hamburg means Dortmund are now four points from 13th after Tunisia's Anis Ben-Hatira netted twice for Hertha while Hamburg remain in the bottom three. VfB Stuttgart leap-frogged Dortmund into 14th place after their stunning 5-4 victory at Eintracht Frankfurt in a nine-goal thriller. Stuttgart captain Christian Gentner scored the 84th-minute winner when he stabbed the ball home at close-range from a free-kick to claim only their second win of the season. Frankfurt finished with 10 men after Swiss striker Haris Seferovic was sent off five minutes from time for miming that the referee's assistant needed glasses. With league leaders Bayern at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday in the weekend's top fixture, Hoffenheim took Gladbach's place in second with a 1-0 win at Paderborn. Right-wing Kevin Volland pushed his claim for a place in the Germany squad for next month's internationals with his first goal of the season. Augsburg moved up to ninth in the table with a 2-0 win at home to Freiburg with Dutch defender Paul Verhaegh and Turkey's Halil Altintop scoring the goals. Roberto di Matteo attempts to pick up his third straight win as Schalke 04 coach later on Saturday when his side play at Bayer Leverkusen, while VfL Wolsfburg host Mainz on Sunday afternoon with both teams on the verge of a top three place. Bottom side Werder Bremen sacked coach Robin Dutt on Saturday, less than 24 hours after his side's 1-0 defeat at home to Cologne left them winless after nine games. The 49-year-old is the third Bundesliga coach sacked this season after Mirko Slomka (from Hamburg) and Jens Keller (Schalke 04). Bremen's Under-23 coach Viktor Skripnik has been appointed as caretaker coach, with ex-Germany midfielder Torsten Frings during the search for Dutt's successor."
815,22/10/2014,22:57,Aubameyang double maintains Dortmund's perfect record,Borussia Dortmund looking a different side to the one enduring a miserable Bundesliga campaign demolished Galatasaray 4-0 in Istanbul on Wednesday to record their third consecutive Champions League win in stunning style.,"The 2013 Champions League finalists are top of Group D with nine points, three clear of second-placed Arsenal who won 2-1 at Anderlecht, and have yet to concede a goal in Europe this season. A double from Gabon winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, plus goals from Marco Reus and Adrian Ramos preserved Dortmund's perfect record in Europe so far this season. Jurgen Klopp's side can book their place in the knock-out phase with another win over Galatasaray in Dortmund in the return leg in a fortnight. But their high-flying Champions League form is in stark contrast to their horror showing in the Bundesliga where they are languishing 14th in the table after three straight defeats. Klopp's side are winless in their last five league games and he slammed Borussia for playing 'senseless football' in Saturday's shock 2-1 defeat at Cologne on Saturday But it was all smiles from the Dortmund boss in Istanbul as his team backed up their 2-0 win at home to Arsenal and 3-0 victory at Anderlecht to run Galatasaray ragged. The victory in Istanbul was largely down to an impressive display from Aubameyang who scored twice and hit the post in the opening half an hour. The 25-year-old wasted no time as he finished a brilliant counter-attack with only nine minutes gone. Reus beat Aurelien Chedjou to the ball on the left before firing in a pin-point pass to Aubameyang, who was left with a simple tap in at the back post. The visitors soon doubled the lead when Lukasz Piszczek crossed from the right and the ball bounced up to the perfect height for Aubameyang to tap in from close range with 18 minutes gone. Only the post denied the Gabon international a hat-trick on 31 minutes when Henrikh Mkhitaryan's cross was met by Aubameyang, but the ball ricocheted away to safety. Dortmund were not to be denied a 3-0 lead at the break. Reus unleashed a spectacular long-range shot from outside the area which dipped over Galatasaray's Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera on 41 minutes. Klopp's side claimed their ninth goal of the campaign and their fourth of the night when Ramos scored just a minute after coming off the bench. Ilkay Gundogan, who was playing his first Champions League game since the 2013 final after more than a year out with injury -- provided the pass and Ramos crashed home his shot on 83 minutes. Dortmund''s victory rounded off an impressive week in the Champions League for Bundesliga sides. On Tuesday Bayern Munich demolished Roma 7-1 in the Italian capital, and Schalke edged 10-man Sporting Lisbon 4-3 while Bayer Leverkusen earned a 2-0 win at home to Zenit St Peterburg on Wednesday."
816,22/10/2014,15:03,Klopp gets job gaurantee despite horror run,Coach Jurgen Klopp still has a job guarantee at Borussia Dortmund despite their horror run of five games without a win in the Bundesliga.,"Dortmund won their first two Champions League matches ahead of Tuesday's trip to Istanbul to face Galatasaray, but last season's Bundesliga runners-up are down to 14th in the German league with just two wins in their first eight matches. Despite losing their last three league games, Klopp still has a job guarantee with Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke despite Borussia's worst start to a season in 27 years. ""I have always said that the coach will decide when his time at Borussia is over and that's still valid,"" Watzke told German daily Bild. ""Jurgen is just as meticulous and innovative as on his first day here. ""He's not showing even a second's worth of tiredness with the job. ""We have been on the sunny side of things and rushed from success to success. ""Why should we then in our first real crisis busy ourselves with a few negative thoughts? It's not up for discussion"" Klopp, who won the Bundesliga with Dortmund in 2011 and 2012, has a contract until June 2018 and Watzke says even if they miss out on a season of lucrative Champions League football it would not cause Dortmund problems. ""It wouldn't be a problem in terms of economics,"" said Watzke, after Dortmund came perilously close to bankruptcy in 2005. ""We have survived many a crisis in the past and the only positive from the current situation is that we're not anywhere near that economic level. ""But that's no excuse for the players, financially nothing can shake us in the next few years, I'm more concerned about the football."" Dortmund star Marco Reus has a contract until 2017, but could leave Borussia at the end of the season if he actions a release clause with rivals Bayern Munich rumoured to be interested in the Germany winger. ""We won't say anything about current contract negotiations, we have learnt about that from the past,"" said Watzke with both Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski having left Dortmund for Bayern in recent years."

""We have to correct our mistakes now, not tomorrow or the day after,"" fumed Klopp. ""We need to get ourselves out of this rut and no one will do it for us."" Having beaten Arsenal 2-0 in their opening game, Klopp's side have yet to concede a goal in the competition and have been boosted by the return to fitness of three key players. They have Germany midfielders Marco Reus and Ilkay Gundogan, as well as Armenia's Henrikh Mkhitaryan back after injuries. Reus managed more shots on goal than the entire Cologne team combined and finishing is a factor for Dortmund in Turkey. There was more bad news for Klopp from Cologne as defender Erik Durm, who was injured in the warm-up, also misses the trip to Istanbul with a thigh strain and his place at left-back is likely to go to Kevin Grosskreutz. Galatasaray lost 4-1 at Arsenal three weeks ago and need a result at home against Dortmund to keep their knock-out stage hopes alive.

With eight matches played this season, Dortmund are already 13 points adrift of Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich having finished as runners-up to the Bavarian giants for the last two seasons. ""This is our most difficult situation for the last few years,"" said Zorc. ""Basically, things haven't improved in the last few weeks. ""I have the feeling something is missing, there is a lack of consistency in attack and defence and we're giving goals away again. ""We are not determined enough going forward."" Borussia coach Jurgen Klopp was a dejected figure on the sidelines on Saturday as his side slumped to a 2-1 defeat in Cologne, their first loss in the city for more than a decade. Klopp welcomed back midfielders Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Marco Reus and Ilkay Gundogan, who had been out for more than a year with a back injury, but his side still faltered with the coach admitting they ""had played football which makes no sense"". The only good news for Klopp is that Germany defender Erik Durm should be fit to play in Istanbul despite dropping out during the warm-up in Cologne with a thigh problem.

Goetze, whose extra-time goal in the Rio de Janeiro final against Argentina in July allowed Germany to win the World Cup for the fourth time, joined Dortmund's arch-rivals Bayern in July 2013 after activating a release clause in his contract to move for 37 million euros. Now he is hoping Reus will tread a similar path from Dortmund to Munich. ""I get on really, really well with Marco and I always look forward to seeing him when we meet up with the Germany squad,"" Goetze, who scored twice in Saturday's 6-0 win at home to Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga, told Sky Sports. ""We had a great year together (at Dortmund in 2012/13). Of course, I would be delighted if he came, but that has to be his decision."" Bayern have signed both Goetze and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski from Borussia in recent years and Reus is clearly next on their radar. ""If a German international has an exit clause and his contract could run out, then FC Bayern are obliged to think about him,"" said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. ""It is well-known that Marco has a release clause."" Bayern, who have won the Bundesliga in each of the last two seasons, are four points clear at the top of the table while Dortmund are 14th having failed to win any of their last five league games, with Saturday's 2-1 loss at Cologne their third straight defeat."

But Klopp's side are enduring a horrible run domestically and Saturday's loss, their first in Cologne since 2003, was their third Bundesliga defeat in a row ahead of their European clash in Istanbul. ""We played a type of football which makes absolutely no sense,"" fumed Klopp. ""We had a high number of failed passes and committed simple mistakes which really hurt us. ""We have to correct these errors. Not tomorrow, or the day after, but now. ""To concede two goals in each game is rubbish. We have to sort this out and no one will help us do that."" Dortmund's Germany midfielders Ilkay Gundogan -- who had been out for more than a year -- and Marco Reus returned from injury, but were powerless to stop Cologne taking a 1-0 lead as midfielder Kevin Vogt fired home on 40 minutes. Italy striker Ciro Immobile equalised, but Cologne's Simon Zoller netted the hosts' winner on 74 minutes. The result sees Dortmund drop to 14th in the Bundesliga table - just two points above the bottom three - while Cologne are 10th. Dortmund travel to face league leaders Bayern Munich away in a fortnight and Klopp's side are already 13 points behind the Bavarians after only eight matches."
822,11/10/2014,20:16,Lagging behind Bayern is least of Klopp's concerns,Jurgen Klopp says lagging far behind Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga is the least of Borussia Dortmund's problems as they languish in the bottom half of the table.,"Dortmund's worst start to a league campaign in five years has left them in 13th place having failed to win any of their last four games. Klopp coached Dortmund to back-to-back league titles in 2011 and 2012, but this season they are already 10 points adrift of leaders Bayern. Dortmund have won their first two Champions League games, beating Arsenal at home and Anderlecht away, to leave them top of Group D, but have won just two of their opening seven Bundesliga matches. At one point, Klopp had just 13 outfield players fit to train due to a lengthy injury list. Borussia lost both star players Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski to arch-rivals Bayern in previous seasons, but Klopp, 47, says his team's poor results just means they have to work harder. ""Nobody will believe it, but our distance behind Bayern is the least of our problems,"" Klopp told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper. ""For me, this is a phase as a coach where we have to work hard -- period. If I were to lose faith, which I haven't, then it would be relatively difficult to deal with this situation. ""I haven't lost my fire or anything like that and we are united in our belief we'll come out of this. ""We have conceded goals due to a mixture of mental tiredness and a lack of concentration, then one thing leads to another. ""As soon as we reduce the amount of goals we're conceding, then we'll immediately have the chance to start winning games again."" Klopp has been hardest hit in midfield with injured internationals Jakub Blaszczykowski, Nuri Sahin and Ilkay Gundogan yet to make a single first-team appearance this season. But Klopp was boosted on Friday by the news both Ilkay Gundogan and Marco Reus returned from injury in an Under-23 game. Defensive midfielder Gundogan has been out for 14 months with a back injury and scored on his return. Having lost Lewandowski, last season's top-scorer in the Bundesliga with 20 goals, Dortmund are bedding in new strikers Ciro Immobile and Adrian Ramos, but Klopp says the changes in his squad can be no excuses. ""I think it's completely normal that there are now questions about my team's approach. You can list all the players who were missing, but so what?,"" he said. ""We still had 11 players on the pitch."""

But on Friday the midfielder played 45 minutes of a friendly for Dortmund's reserves against VfL Bochum and scored his team's second goal in a 2-0 win. Germany attacking midfielder Marco Reus also featured in the friendly as he returns from an ankle injury. ""They both looked good on the pitch, especially when you consider that Ilkay was out for so long,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc. ""He was already very comfortable on the ball, but we shouldn't overestimate it as he only played a half."" Both Gundogan and Reus could now be included in the Dortmund squad for their next Bundesliga match against Cologne on October 18 as they look to get back to winning ways. Having won the Bundesliga title in both 2011 and 2012, Dortmund have had a poor start to the current campaign and are 13th in the table having failed to win any of their last four league games. But they are top of Group D in the Champions League ahead of Arsenal having beaten the Gunners 2-0 in Dortmund and Anderlecht 3-0 away."

""Maybe they will be too confident after winning the World Cup. Maybe they will oversleep a little and we will be able to take advantage. I hope so,"" said Lewandowski in quotes reported by UEFA.com. ""We know their qualities, but we will not park a bus in our penalty area."" Poland started their campaign last month with a resounding 7-0 win against minnows Gibraltar, in which Lewandowski scored four times, while the Germans enjoyed a nervy 2-1 win at home to Scotland. Lewandowski will come up against several of his Bayern colleagues, including goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who will captain the world champions with Bastian Schweinsteiger injured. ""I have good memories of my many games against Manuel,"" said Lewandowski, previously of Borussia Dortmund. ""I remember only too well that I scored my first Bundesliga goal against Schalke, with Neuer between the posts. ""I gave an interview to German television and they asked me a lot about it, but it is Poland v Germany and I would be equally happy if any of my team-mates scored. It does not have to be me. ""Will this match be special for me? I would not say special as such, just different. ""I know most of Germany's players - I played with some at Dortmund and now I play with some more at Bayern. ""Of course, we joked a little bit about the game and they admitted, jokingly, they would happily accept a draw in Warsaw."" Neuer said watching Lewandowski train on a daily basis at Bayern, after he joined from Borussia Dortmund in the summer, will work to his advantage. ""I have got to know his game better by having trained so often with him,"" said Neuer at a press conference in Frankfurt. ""I know where he likes to get the ball, he's one of the best strikers in the world, so you have to watch his every move."""

Ozil will miss the Group D qualifiers in Warsaw and against the Republic of Ireland in Gelsenkirchen next Tuesday. He also misses a qualifier against minnows Gibraltar in Nuremberg on November 14, plus a friendly against European champions Spain on November 18. Ozil is also added to Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's mounting injury list and will miss the rest of the Gunners' Champions League group stage matches, including the key Group D showdown at home to Borussia Dortmund on November 26. Germany coach Joachim Loew is already missing several stars for the trip to Warsaw with captain Bastian Schweinsteiger, Sami Khedira, Benedikt Hoewedes, Marco Reus and Mario Gomez all injured while midfielder Julian Draxler has the flu. Chelsea forward Andre Schuerrle also missed training on Wednesday with a muscular problem, but is expected to be fit. ""Things look good for Andre, he received some treatment on Tuesday, so it's normal that he sat out training the day after,"" said team manager Oliver Bierhoff. Draxler, of Schalke, is expected to join the squad once he recovers from illness. Even without Ozil, Loew has targeted six points from their games against Poland and Ireland to give the Germans control of Group D after they beat Scotland 2-1 in their opening match. Bierhoff said Germany are rebuilding after established stars Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker and Miroslav Klose all retired in the wake of their World Cup triumph in Brazil in July. ""We want to win both games and give ourselves a bit of a cushion in the qualifiers,"" added Bierhoff. ""It's going to be a tough October with two difficult games. ""We have to introduce several new players into the squad because of injuries and a few retirements. ""The team will have a different look to how it was two months ago."" With Schweinsteiger injured, Germany will be captained by goalkeeper Manuel Neuer for the next two games. ""These are key games for us, it is important to keep playing well after the win over Scotland,"" said Neuer, of Bayern Munich. Loew is set to hand a first cap to Bayer Leverkusen attacking midfielder Karim Bellarabi, who has opted to play for Germany over Morocco, where his mother was born, on the back of several impressive displays in the Bundesliga."

But Klopp's side are winless in their last four domestic league matches with three losses and a draw as Saturday's 1-0 defeat at home to Hamburg left them 13th -- their worst league position after seven matches since 2009. ""For all our ambitions and goals, this is currently not nearly enough,"" admitted Klopp. ""I take full responsibility for the preparations and the tactics. ""We're left with seven points and we're not even looking at the top of the table now."" This was Hamburg's fourth victory over Dortmund in their last five meetings to leave Klopp's side just two points above the relegation zone. Hamburg netted the first-half winner when a poor pass from Dortmund striker Adrian Ramos was snapped up by Marcell Jansen who fed Nicolai Mueller. The winger sprinted away from Dortmund centre-back Sokratis, drawing goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller for Hamburg's Pierre-Michel Lasogga to slot into an empty net on 35 minutes. Klopp has lost both star striker Robert Lewandowski and midfielder Mario Goetze to rivals Bayern Munich in the last two seasons and the league table tells its own story. After seven games last season, Dortmund led Bayern in the Bundesliga with both sides on six wins and a draw, but Borussia had a superior goal difference of 16 to Bayern's 12. A year later and Dortmund are already ten points behind Bayern with the two teams to meet in Munich on November 1. Dortmund were not the only German side to suffer a Champions League hangover on Saturday. Ten-man Schalke also suffered an afternoon to forget after drawing 1-1 with Maribor in the Champions League on Wednesday as they went down 2-1 at Hoffenheim, who moved up to second in the table. The Royal Blues found themselves behind after only 13 minutes as Norway's Tarik Elyounoussi put the hosts into the lead. Hoffenheim's Hungary striker Adam Szalai then slotted home their second against his former club on 29 minutes. Schalke finished with 10 men after Cameroon's Joel Matip was shown a second yellow and subsequent red before Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored a late consolation goal to leave the Royal Blues 11th. Bayer Leverkusen dropped to fourth in the Bundesliga table after drawing 2-2 at home to ten-man Paderborn having beaten Benfica at home on Wednesday in Europe."

But defeats at Mainz and arch rivals Schalke, plus a 2-2 draw at home to VfB Stuttgart in their last three league matches have left Dortmund with just seven points and 12th in the table. After only six games, Dortmund are already seven points behind league leaders Bayern Munich. ""We'll try to show an improvement in the Bundesliga, we're getting there step by step, but there is still a bit of work to do,"" said Dortmund coach Klopp. ""We have to show in Germany that despite a few problems we are still able to win matches, starting with Saturday."" Hamburg are Borussia's bogey team having beaten Klopp's team convincingly on three of the last four occasions and nothing will be taken for granted despite the Hanseatic side being bottom of the table. Veteran midfielder Sebastian Kehl is an injury concern for Saturday with a bruised foot while captain and Germany defender Mats Hummels is expected to return to the starting line-up. Hamburg are one of only three teams without a win this season and were hit with more bad news on Thursday when it was confirmed ex-coach Mirko Slomka has taken them to court for unfair dismissal after being sacked last month just three games into the new season. Hanover 96 travel to Bavaria looking for their first win in Munich since 2006 with their coach Tayfun Korkut having imposed a ban on his players visiting Munich's Oktoberfest beer festival which ends on Sunday. Hanover are sixth in the table, but only four points adrift of leaders Bayern ahead of the Allianz Arena showdown. Pep Guardiola's Bayern have dropped just four points so far this season and are in confident mood having won at CSKA Moscow on Tuesday to leave them with two wins from their first Champions League matches. And history is not on Hanover's side. They have conceded 27 goals and scored only twice in the seven games since their shock 1-0 win in Munich in 2006, which includes a 7-0 drubbing in 2010 and a 5-0 defeat two years ago. ""Our goal is to make Bayern do some thinking during the game, we don't want to just defend,"" said Hanover boss Korkut whose side has taken ten points from the first six games, but suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at Stuttgart last Saturday. On Sunday, Lucien Favre's Borussia Moenchengladbach host Mainz with both sides unbeaten after their first six games. Mainz are hoping to include the Bundesliga's top-scorer Shinji Okazaki, but the Japan star has been labouring with a haematoma in his calf. ""We're looking at Shinji from day to day,"" said coach Kasper Hjulmand with Okazaki having scored five goals in five games this season.

828,02/10/2014,11:58,Germany's Hummels rubbishes Man Utd speculation,Germany defender Mats Hummels insists there is no truth in rumours of a future transfer to Manchester United and insists he is perfectly happy at Borussia Dortmund.,"The 25-year-old centre back has been heavily linked by the British media to helping solve Louis van Gaal's defensive problems at Manchester United, but the World Cup-winner says there is zero truth in any transfer talk. ""If the media reports were to be believed, I've been negotiating with everybody and signed pre-contract agreements with Barcelona and at other places,"" the Dortmund captain told the Bundesliga magazine. ""There's never been an ounce of truth in that. I never negotiated or spoke about a transfer. I have no idea who makes these things up."" Hummels, who started his career at Bayern Munich, says being linked recently to the likes of United, Barcelona and Real Madrid is flattering, but he wants to captain Dortmund to future success. ""It's nice to hear that big clubs like that are interested in you,"" he said. ""I take that as a compliment. But it doesn't influence me in any way. ""We earn enough here in Dortmund. There will always be someone who can pay more. ""But Dortmund have made a lot of progress during my time here, the wages are not at the level they were six years ago. ""In any case, I believe that it's enough for me. ""If one day I start thinking about playing abroad, money won't be the reason. ""But I don't even think about that at the moment, we still have so much further to go here. ""We have an incredibly cool and talented team here: Neven Subotic, Marcel Schmelzer, Nuri Sahin, all the others. ""When we won the championship for a second time in 2012, each one of us could have gone wherever we wanted. ""But I thought: 'No, what we have here is something truly unique'. ""You don't often find a team where people are really friends with each other. ""If you've got the chance to play at such a high level with your mates, you have to hold on to that for as long as possible."""
829,02/10/2014,11:27,Klopp demands more from Dortmund in Bundesliga,Jurgen Klopp insists there is more to come from Borussia Dortmund and Shinji Kagawa after their Champions League romp at Anderlecht kept them top of Group D ahead of Arsenal.,"Having beaten the Gunners 2-0 in Dortmund to open their European campaign in style a fortnight ago, the 2013 Champions League finalists enjoyed a comfortable 3-0 win in Belgium on Wednesday. Despite failing to win any of their last three German league matches, Borussia brushed off their poor domestic form with an impressive display. Italy striker Ciro Immobile, who also scored against Arsenal, grabbed an early goal after a dream pass from Japan midfielder Kagawa before Colombia striker Adrian Ramos came off the bench to score two late goals. Dortmund coach Klopp left Ramos out of the starting line-up as Kagawa played his first Champions League match since returning from Manchester United and the Japan star influenced the match from the outset. The result in Belgium means Dortmund have yet to concede a Champions League goal this season, but Klopp says there is still work to be done, especially in the Bundesliga. ""We defended passionately and also had a bit of luck in certain situations, which you sometimes need in football,"" he said. ""I didn't get the impression that we defended perfectly, but it gives us a bit of room to work with and I didn't expect perfection. ""The opening goal was an Italian-Japanese effort and a sensational pass from Shinji. ""Then it was Ciro's game, he's really ice-cold in those situations. It's something we will see a lot more of."" The result leaves Dortmund with a perfect six points from two games, three ahead of Arsenal, but despite their stellar start in Europe, Klopp wants domestic results to improve, despite a string of injuries. Dortmund host bogey-side Hamburg on Saturday, the visitors having won three of their last four meetings with Klopp's side. ""We have only a two-day break now and if I was a Hamburg player, I'd at least think that isn't a disadvantage,"" said Klopp. ""We'll try to show an improvement in the Bundesliga. We have to show in Germany that despite a few problems we are still able to win matches, starting with Saturday."""
830,01/10/2014,11:41,Dortmund star Immobile finds Bundesliga tough,Italian striker Ciro Immobile has admitted he finds the Bundesliga tougher than Italy's Serie A as he adapts to life in Germany's top flight.,"""It's definitely a different type of football,"" Borussia Dortmund's Azzurri star told German magazine Sport Bild. ""In the Bundesliga league, even the small teams run themselves into the ground. In any case it is a tougher league. ""The Italian defenders are perhaps a bit better schooled tactially, but physically the Germans are often better, quicker and they push forward more."" Immobile switched from Serie A's Torino to Dortmund before the start of the season for 19.5 million euros (US$24.6m) and after five Bundesliga games he has one league goal to his credit. He impressed on his Champions League debut for Dortmund by scoring in a 2-0 home win against Arsenal a fortnight ago. But despite his European heroics, he acknowledges having his work cut out to replace Poland striker and ex-Dortmund hot-shot Robert Lewandowski, who has joined Bayern Munich. ""His name will always remain here, that is normal. He did fantastic things with Borussia,"" said the 24-year-old Immobile. ""It is the same thing as with my name in Turin. ""I am very proud to be Lewandowski's successor -- and happy that I have been given the trust."" The Italian struggled upfront alongside Colombia's Adrian Ramos as Dortmund lost 2-1 at rivals Schalke 04 on Saturday in the Ruhr Valley derby. The defeat left Jurgen Klopp's Borussia winless in their last three games since their home win over Arsenal in the Champions League and 12th in the Bundesliga table."
831,26/09/2014,09:27,Victory needed by both Schalke and Dortmund in derby,Bayern Munich are right where they want to be atop the Bundesliga after five rounds and ahead of a tough showdown against Cologne this weekend while Schalke and Borussia Dortmund both head into the 145th derby needing a victory.,"Munich head to Cologne on Saturday to face a team which had not conceded a goal in their first four games this season until Hanover scored in the midweek round of games. Bayern are happy about where they are, knowing that the weekend/midweek rhythm is just starting with a match-up against CSKA Moscow coming in the Champions League next week. ""I think we can be satisfied after the first five games. We've picked up 11 out of a possible 15 points, three wins and two draws - that's okay,"" said Munich board chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge after the team's 4-0 victory over the previous surprise leaders SC Paderborn. ""Some people expected a bumpy start after the World Cup. We can be very satisfied with the season to date including the Champions League."" Bayern winger Arjen Robben said the win over Paderborn was important but the Cologne game matched that in their bid to stay atop the Bundesliga. ""It was really important for us to win and lay down a marker. That's what we're aiming for, where we want to be and - much more important - we want to stay there,"" said Robben. The top two challengers at the moment - Bayer Leverkusen and Hanover 96 - both have 10 points and play at teams who have not yet won this season in SC Freiburg and VfB Stuttgart respectively. Stuttgart sit second-to-last with two points after failing to hold a 2-0 lead at Dortmund in a 2-2 draw midweek. Stuttgart's troubles - they had scored just one goal going into the Dortmund match - resulted in the sacking of sporting director Fredi Bobic. ""In the end, we probably have to consider ourselves somewhat fortunate to be taking a point. With this performance, we have certainly taken a step in the right direction,"" said Daniel Didavi, who scored both goals against Dortmund. The Yellow-Blacks actually could have beaten Stuttgart but had a shot blocked at the line in stoppage time. In general, though, Dortmund know they cannot give up two goals every game. ""We need more stability in defence. We have already conceded nine goals in five matches which is not just a poor record, it is a very poor record,"" said captain Mats Hummels, who came on in the second half for his first action this season. ""We need to defend better as a team, and all eleven players have to play their part. If you concede two goals in each game, as has already happened four times this season, it's very hard to win."" And Dortmund need to win, having already dropped four points behind Bayern and three behind Leverkusen and Hanover. Schalke come into the match having finally won their first competitive match of the season - a 3-0 beating of Werder Bremen. The Royal Blues have won just one of the last four derbies at home against Dortmund. Manager Jens Keller knows his team will be well served to put together a string of victories to move back up the table. And Dortmund are a perfect opponent for that. ""We don't need to motivate the players for this match. It's the biggest derby in Germany. We are all excited for the match,"" said Keller, whose team has five points in 13th place.

The 25-year-old central defender, who scored the winning goal as Germany beat France 1-0 in the World Cup quarter-finals in July on the way to lifting the trophy, has been struggling with muscle problems since the summer. But he could now get the chance to sport the captain's armband for the first time and get some match practice ahead of the Ruhr derby against Schalke at the weekend. Klopp also has Neven Subotic available again after a groin problem kept him out of the weekend defeat to Mainz. However, Sebastian Kehl and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who is out for four weeks after suffering a foot injury against Mainz, are both added to a lengthy list of absentees."

It was a chastening entrance into the competition for Arsene Wenger's side, who have drawn their last three Premier League games, but Wilshere says there is plenty of time to turn the situation around in Group D. ""We'll bounce back. Our next Champions League game (against Galatasaray on October 1) is at home and hopefully we'll get the three points,"" the England midfielder told Wednesday's London Evening Standard newspaper. ""It's never nice to lose a game. We wanted to come here and win. But that was our first Champions League group game. ""We have got five more, so we have an opportunity to try and get 15 points and that is what we'll try to do. ""It hasn't quite clicked for us yet, but we've got a lot of quality players and I'm sure it'll come right."" Wilshere had to leave the field to receive treatment after spraining his ankle in the latter stages of the game, but Wenger played down the severity of the injury."

835,16/09/2014,23:03,Far from immobile Dortmund outclass Arsenal,Italian striker Ciro Immobile scored his first goal for Borussia Dortmund as the German side produced a dominant performance to outclass Arsenal 2-0 in their Champions League opening group game in Dortmund on Tuesday.,"Gabonese striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang added another early in the second half to help Dortmund to a fully deserved 2-0 win in their Group D clash. Arsenal had won in Dortmund in the group stages last season but they were always on the back foot against a relentless home team. Jurgen Klopp's side had 15 attempts on goal in the first half alone although they were far from clinical until Immobile struck on the stroke of half-time. Aubameyang then rounded Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny to kill off any hopes of an unlikely comeback on a punishing night for the Gunners. Arsenal had travelled to Dortmund for the third time in four years without suspended right-back Mathieu Debuchy. As a result Hector Bellerin was given his first start, while Danny Welbeck was on his own up front in his first Champions League game for Arsene Wenger's team. Dortmund were without six senior players through injury, including the likes of Marco Reus and Mats Hummels, but it hardly looked that way as they started the game at a furious pace. There was a scare for the visitors in the fifth minute when Henrikh Mkhitaryan cut by Mikel Arteta and fell to the ground inside the box. But instead of winning a penalty, the Armenian midfielder was booked for simulation. Dortmund continued to dominate, with Sokratis poking wide from a corner and Immobile shooting off target. Approaching the half hour, Szczesny was well placed to save when a brilliant Dortmund move ended with Aubameyang failing to touch in Kevin Grosskreutz's low cross from six yards out. A minute later Dortmund missed another great chance when Immobile again found space down the left channel. Szczesny cut the former Torino player's cross out only for the ball to fall to Mkhitaryan 10 yards out. But he blazed over under pressure from Jack Wilshere. Up the other end Welbeck almost got on the end of Kieran Gibbs cross and in another rare attack for Arsenal, the former Manchester United striker clipped a good chance wide of Roman Weidenfeller's right-hand post. All Dortmund's pressure looked to have come to nothing until Immobile picked up possession in his own half right on half-time. Last season's top scorer in Serie A ran at an isolated Laurent Koscielny, beat the Arsenal centre back and then drilled low into the corner of the net. A dismal Arsenal defensive performance continued in the second half when Aubameyang got Dortmund's second goal after 48 minutes. The Gabonese forward played a one-two with Grosskreutz, got around Szczesny and regained his footing to slot into the net. The waves of Dortmund attacks continued and Immobile forced an excellent save from Szczesny before Welbeck missed another opportunity for Arsenal. In truth the scoreline flattered an Arsenal side who were completely overrun in midfield. Aubameyang's pace was causing all sorts of problems and he hit the crossbar as Dortmund looked to inflict further misery on the visitors. Welbeck then shot over the bar as the Gunners lost on the opening day of the group stage for the first time in 11 years."
836,15/09/2014,02:10,Kagawa gives Dortmund boost ahead of Arsenal clash,Borussia Dortmund received a big boost just ahead of the kick-off of their Champions League season at home against Arsenal with Shinji Kagawa's return to Germany easing the injury loss of Marco Reus.,"The 2013 Champions League runners-up Dortmund had bad news when Reus went down with a sprained ankle and partially torn ankle ligament on international duty last week, sidelining the German star for four weeks. Helping compensate for his loss was the arrival of Japanese international Kagawa, who came back to Dortmund after an unsuccessful run with Manchester United. And after just two weeks of training, the 25-year-old reminded the Dortmund faithful exactly why they loved him so much prior to his departure for England. At the weekend, Kagawa assisted on Adrian Ramos's goal and then scored a goal himself before coming off after 64 minutes with cramp in Dortmund's 3-1 win over Freiburg. ""We already knew that Shinji can kick a bit and create a special atmosphere,"" said Dortmund coach Juergen Klopp, who put him alongside Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Kevin Grosskreutz in the familiar 4-2-3-1 system. ""He still has a nose for goals,"" said Klopp. It was Kagawa's first competitive goal since May 2013. Dortmund have also seen captain and World Cup winner Mats Hummels return to training -- though he will not play against Arsenal. ""We want to have a good start. We want a home victory,"" said Hummels about the start of the Champions League. Arsenal come into the Group D encounter after a 2-2 draw at home against Manchester City, in which they conceded an 83rd minute goal. ""The only frustrating thing for me is that we didn't manage to keep the lead and gave a cheap goal away,"" said Arsenal coach Arsène Wenger. ""We conceded two goals and I believe we are an offensive team. We go forward a lot but at the moment that's where we can improve."" The match cost the services of Mathieu Debuchy as the French international defender went down with a bad ankle sprain. Arsenal's Jack Wilshere is expecting an entertaining game with Dortmund. ""They're always good games when we face them,"" he said. ""It's a tough game and we go there first this time, so the hardest match of the group will be the first one. ""We can put a marker down in that game to say we're here to win this group. Even if we don't win the game, we don't want to lose it."" Arsenal have collected four draws in their first six competitive matches this season while Dortmund have won three of their four matches so far."
837,13/09/2014,18:17,Ribery scores on return as Bayern go joint top,"Bayern Munich playmaker Franck Ribery scored in his first game this season as the champions moved joint top of the Bundesliga on Saturday, while Shinji Kagawa also enjoyed a goalscoring return as Borussia Dortmund saw off Freiburg.","Mario Goetze put the defending champions ahead in the first half before Ribery came off the bench to seal a routine 2-0 win over VfB Stuttgart at the Allianz Arena. Bayern are now equal on seven points with Bayer Leverkusen who were held 3-3 by Werder Bremen on Friday night and are ahead on goal difference after three games. The Bavarians scored the first goal of the afternoon after 27 minutes when Goetze drove a shot through a crowd of players when a free-kick was only partially cleared. In the second half Ribery, who has been suffering from a recurring knee injury, came on and the French midfielder secured the three points when he slotted under Sven Ullreich with five minutes left. The only down side for Bayern ahead of a Champions League clash with Manchester City in Munich on Wednesday was seeing defender Holger Badstuber hobble off with a thigh injury. Meanwhile, Kagawa made a dream start to his second spell at Borussia Dortmund after getting on the scoresheet in their 3-1 win over Freiburg at Signal Iduna Park. The Japanese midfielder returned to Dortmund from Manchester United last month and his clever pass for Kevin Grosskreutz helped the hosts open the scoring after 34 minutes. Grosskreutz's low cross was swept in by Adrian Ramos for his second goal of the campaign. The same three players were involved when Dortmund stretched their lead four minutes before half-time. This time Ramos found Kagawa, who sidefooted home in what was his 50th Bundesliga game. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a breakaway goal shortly after coming on before Oliver Sorg pulled one back for Freiburg. Dortmund are third on the Bundesliga table a point behind Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern. Elsewhere, Japanese striker Shinji Okazaki scored twice and Sami Allagui also found the net against the team he has just left as Mainz won 3-1 at Hertha Berlin. Okazaki gave the visitors the lead after 36 minutes, finishing on the rebound after home keeper Thomas Kraft twice denied South Korea midfielder Koo Ja-Cheol. Julian Schieber fired a great chance wide for Hertha before Allagui rounded off a lovely team move with twenty minutes left. It was the Tunisian attacker's first game for Mainz since rejoining them on loan from Hertha at the end of August. Ronny's late penalty gave Hertha hope but Okazaki's third league goal of the campaign ensured that Mainz got their first league win of the season. Hoffenheim had to settle for a point after Ivica Olic's deft finish drew visitors Wolfsburg level with a minute remaining. Anthony Modeste scored Hoffenheim's goal in the 1-1 draw, while Wolfsburg's Josuha Guilavogui was sent off late on. Promoted sides Paderborn and Cologne are both still unbeaten after they played out a goalless draw. On Friday, Bayer Leverkusen lost their 100 percent record when they were pegged back in a six-goal thriller against Werder Bremen. Werder's Sebastian Proedl made it 3-3 with only five minutes left as the visitors drew their third game in a row."
838,12/09/2014,01:48,Injuries leave Dortmund counting on Kagawa,Borussia Dortmund are in the grip of an injury crisis coming into their home clash with Freiburg in the Bundesliga on Saturday and with a Champions League clash with Arsenal just around the corner.,"With Marco Reus, Nuri Sahin and Jakub Blaszczykowski among those already out, captain Mats Hummels struggling for fitness and Ciro Immobile a minor doubt, the last thing coach Jurgen Klopp needed was the news that Shinji Kagawa had to withdraw from training on Thursday with a groin problem. Against Freiburg, the Japanese star is hoping to make his first appearance since returning to the Signal-Iduna Park following a disappointing spell at Manchester United. Kagawa won two league titles in his first spell at the club between 2010 and 2012 and Klopp hopes to use the 25-year-old straight away. ""I have a good feeling that the atmosphere on Saturday and the joy of our supporters can spur him on,"" Klopp said on Thursday, although he admitted that a place on the bench may be the best Kagawa can hope for. There is a need to have Kagawa fit after Reus injured his ankle again in Germany's Euro 2016 qualifying win over Scotland last Sunday, ruling him out for around four weeks, and after last season's runners-up loaned Jonas Hofmann to Mainz. ""We can't wait another couple of weeks,"" said Klopp, whose side host Arsenal in Champions League Group D on Tuesday. ""Shinji is already very important for us."" Elsewhere on Saturday, champions Bayern Munich will have Franck Ribery back as they go looking for a second win in three matches against VfB Stuttgart at the Allianz Arena. The game will be Bayern's first in a run of seven matches in 22 days, which also includes Champions League ties against Manchester City and CSKA Moscow. Pep Guardiola's side, who drew 1-1 at Schalke last time out, can call on French winger Ribery again after the 31-year-old announced he was over a knee problem. ""I feel good and I'm ready for Saturday,"" Ribery said. ""Now I need to find my rhythm again."" Visitors Stuttgart drew at Borussia Moenchengladbach on the opening weekend before going down to a disappointing home defeat against newly-promoted Cologne last time out. ""With the quality of their individual players, we can't match Bayern,"" Stuttgart coach Armin Veh admitted. ""But obviously we're not going to Munich to freely give up the points. We're going to try and bring something back with us."" Early leaders Bayer Leverkusen will look to make it three wins from three when they host Werder Bremen at the BayArena on Friday evening. Germany midfielder Lars Bender is available for the home team after missing the World Cup through injury, but Simon Rolfes and Julian Brandt will be absent against a Werder team that has drawn both their league matches so far. ""The key to success will be our own game,"" said Leverkusen coach Roger Schmidt, whose side meet Monaco in the Champions League next midweek. ""What's important is that we quickly get back into our system and build on our performances so far."" Germany's other Champions League representative, Schalke, go to still-unbeaten Moenchengladbach on Saturday evening, while Paderborn will look to continue their good start to life in the top flight when they host fellow newly-promoted side Cologne.

He has not played for Dortmund since their 2-0 loss to Bayern Munich in the German Cup final at the beginning of June.
840,31/08/2014,16:07,Japanese star Kagawa returns to Dortmund,"Japanese international Shinji Kagawa has re-signed for former club Borussia Dortmund for a reported fee of 8million euros ($10.5million, £6.3million) ending an unhappy two year spell with Manchester United German publication Bild claimed on Sunday.","The 25-year-old midfielder -- who played 71 games for United including 39 in the Premier League after moving there for 16million euros -- has signed a four year contract with the German giants, with whom he won the 2012 domestic double as well as the 2011 league title after he joined them for just 350,000 euros in 2010. Kagawa, part of the Japanese squad that failed to fire at the World Cup finals, had looked to have a shaky future at United with their Dutch manager Louis van Gaal saying he did not fit his philosophy of football. Kagawa made a promising start at United after being signed from Dortmund by Alex Ferguson in 2012 but injuries hampered his progress. Kagawa hit out at Ferguson's successor David Moyes while on Japan duty after being consistently left on the bench last season and welcomed van Gaal's arrival, declaring his desire to fight for his place after a disappointing World Cup. But the Dutchman recently made it clear the Japan playmaker's chances in his preferred role behind the strikers would be limited, prompting Kagawa to seek a move away. Kagawa was not happy when van Gaal tried to convert him into a defensive midfielder during pre-season -- Angel di Maria's record 59million pound ($99million) arrival signalled the writing was on the wall for his future prospects."
841,29/08/2014,02:16,Klopp urges Dortmund to let rip in Augsburg,Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp has called for his team to show their true colours in Augsburg on Friday following their defeat against Bayer Leverkusen last weekend.,"Augsburg also lost 2-0 at Hoffenheim in their opening Bundesliga fixture, meaning that the home side and Dortmund prop up the standings ahead of their game at the SGL Arena. Roman Weidenfeller should start in goal for Dortmund for the first time this season but fellow German international and World Cup winner Mats Hummels is not yet ready. Klopp is again without Jakub Blaszczykowski, Nuri Sahin, Marcel Schmelzer and Ilkay Gundogan. Adrian Ramos and Sven Bender are doubtful for last season's runners-up. ""Two teams that can do better than they've shown until now will be playing against each other,"" said Klopp, who could be set to bring Manchester United midfielder Shinji Kagawa back to Dortmund. ""We want to give our opponents so many problems that it will take them another week to get back on track."" Last weekend Dortmund never recovered once Leverkusen's Karim Bellarabi scored the fastest goal in Bundesliga history after just nine seconds. Meanwhile, Augsburg conceded two goals in three minutes against Hoffenheim. Markus Weinzierl's team were also beaten by fourth division Magdeburg in the German Cup. The home team, who finished eighth last season, will not have fond memories of Friday's visitors. On the opening weekend last year, Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang scored a hat-trick as Dortmund won 4-0 in Augsburg. ""We should approach the game positively,"" Augsburg Sporting Director Stefan Reuter told Kicker. ""The stadium will be packed. I hope the fans can give the team the necessary momentum to get them back to winning ways."" Following their win over VfL Wolfsburg last Friday, defending champions Bayern Munich strengthened their squad to compensate for the long-term absence of injured Spanish international Javi Martinez. Centre back Mehdi Benatia joined on a five-year deal from Roma, while Bayern also hope to complete a move for Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso. On Saturday evening, Pep Guardiola's side take on fellow Champions League qualifiers Schalke 04. Gelsenkirchen native and ex-Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer will return to the Veltins Arena for the first time since helping Germany win the World Cup this summer. ""It's definitely a special game,"" he said. Neuer has been on the winning side and kept a clean sheet on the three previous occasions he has played there as a Bayern player. In total, Schalke have lost their last seven matches against Bayern. This season, Jens Keller's team have already been knocked out of the German Cup and last Saturday they lost 2-1 at Hanover in the Bundesliga. ""In this situation, you don't necessarily want them as your next opponent,"" Schalke midfielder Julian Draxler said of Bayern. ""But now we have to pull ourselves together and stop the negative trend. I'm convinced that we have the chance to do so against Bayern."" Midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, who has an ankle problem, is unlikely to start for Schalke. Striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar is also doubtful. Also on Saturday, Bayer Leverkusen will look to continue their blistering start to the season when they host Hertha Berlin.

843,19/08/2014,02:05,Germany riding crest of wave as Bundesliga begins,The new Bundesliga season gets underway this weekend with German football riding the crest of a wave following the national team's triumph at the World Cup in Brazil last month.,"That thoroughly deserved victory, given to Joachim Loew's side by Mario Goetze's extra-time strike in the final against Argentina, saw a unified Germany crowned as world champions for the first time. But at club level, the Bundesliga has been leading the way for some time. It averaged 3.16 goals per game last season, considerably more than any of its major European counterparts, while average gates were over 42,000, making the German top flight the best attended league anywhere. ""In my opinion, the Bundesliga's the most attractive league in the world,"" Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Lucien Favre told bundesliga.com. ""The hype in Germany is amazing, and now they've won the World Cup so it's not going to tail off in a rush."" Nevertheless, the biggest problem facing the Bundesliga, as ever, is how to counter the dominance of Bayern Munich, who have romped to the title and added the German Cup in each of the last two campaigns. They have seen Toni Kroos and Mario Mandzukic depart and lost Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in last week's SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, but the Bavarians remain favourites. And yet the rest can draw some hope from the very fact this is a Bundesliga season immediately following a World Cup, and that has not tended to help Bayern in the recent past. After Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup, Stuttgart went on to win the Bundesliga, while in 2011 Dortmund pipped Bayern to the title. In 2009, after Germany reached the Euro 2008 final, it was Wolfsburg who were champions. Six members of Pep Guardiola's squad played in the World Cup final, including Goetze, while Dante and Arjen Robben were also involved until the latter stages in Brazil. That is why chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wanted the start of the new season delayed in order to give these players longer to prepare, but that request was unsurprisingly turned down by Bayern's rivals. ""We have to face the fact that the first half of the season will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, who at times had only a skeleton squad in pre-season training. ""We are at least one month behind schedule."" Guardiola has added to his squad with compatriots Juan Bernat from Valencia and Pepe Reina, who will provide competition in goal for Manuel Neuer. But the marquee signing was Robert Lewandowski, a prolific goalscorer for Dortmund in the last four years. However, Dortmund have moved to replace the Pole by signing Italy striker Ciro Immobile from Torino and Colombia's Adrian Ramos from Hertha Berlin. Stability is key at the Signal Iduna Park, where coach Jurgen Klopp, who led Dortmund to back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012 and a Champions League final defeat to Bayern in 2013, is entering his seventh season in charge. ""We want to establish ourselves further at the top of the league and qualify directly for the Champions League,"" said sporting director Michael Zorc modestly. However, Guardiola knows where the danger lies, saying: ""We may have won the last two league titles, but they clinched the previous two. Our great challenge is to keep up our level to keep them at distance."" Beneath them, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg will again be hoping to contend for Champions League qualification at least. Schalke have kept Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Julian Draxler, while Sidney Sam has joined from Leverkusen, and few teams can boast a midfield as strong as Wolfsburg, with Kevin de Bruyne, Luiz Gustavo and France's Josuha Guilavogui. Bayer have signed Swiss striker Josip Drmic from Nuremberg and have a new coach in Roger Schmidt, back in his native country after winning the Austrian title with Salzburg. Hamburg will be hoping for a stable campaign after almost being relegated for the first time in their history last season. There are new coaches at Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, who have reappointed Armin Veh, the architect of their 2007 title triumph, while Cologne are back among the elite and Paderborn are in the Bundesliga for the first time."
844,13/08/2014,20:51,Dortmund beat weakened Bayern in SuperCup,Borussia Dortmund ensured former star striker Robert Lewandowski's return to the Ruhr ended in disappointment on Wednesday as they beat an under-strength Bayern Munich 2-0 to win the German SuperCup for the second successive year.,"Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Gabonese international striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored Dortmund's goals while the match proved costly for Bayern as Spanish international midfielder Javi Martinez appeared to suffer a serious right knee injury. For Dortmund and coach Jurgen Klopp it provided a measure of consolation for having lost to Bayern in the Cup final last season as well as finishing distant runners-up in the league. And while it leaves Bayern coach Pep Guardiola seeking his first win in the match in two attempts, the former Barcelona handler was without several of his established stars. German World Cup winning midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger and wingers Arjen Robben of the Netherlands and Frenchman Franck Ribery were among those missing. Ribery, though, still managed to grab the headlines as he announced in an interview with Kicker magazine that he had decided to retire from international football."
845,10/08/2014,15:28,Coutinho stars as Liverpool down Dortmund,Liverpool warmed up for the start of their Premier League campaign with a Philippe Coutinho-inspired 4-0 friendly win over Borussia Dortmund at Anfield on Sunday.,"Brendan Rodgers's side dominated their final pre-season match with Brazilian playmaker Coutinho the most impressive performer as he scored one goal and had a hand in another. Coutinho, who will be expected to carry much of Liverpool's creative burden following the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona, was a constant menace throughout as Daniel Sturridge, Dejan Lovren and Jordan Henderson also got their names on the scoresheet against German club Dortmund. Liverpool, looking to gone one better after finishing runners-up to Manchester City in the Premier League last season, handed debuts to new defensive signings Javier Manquillo and Lovren while Sturridge had shaken off a hamstring injury to start in attack. Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp had only one of Germany's quartet of World Cup-winning players at his disposal in the form of Kevin Grosskreutz, who remained on the bench. Liverpool's passing looked crisper than that of their Bundesliga counterparts in the early stages, and Coutinho created the first opening with a weighted ball for Raheem Sterling who saw his shot beaten away by Mitchell Langerak in the Dortmund goal. Coutinho was instrumental in Liverpool's opening goal in the 10th minute when he played a first-time pass which sent Sturridge clear and he angled a shot past Langerak into the corner of the net. Dortmund looked rusty and were punished for a lack of concentration from a Steven Gerrard corner five minutes later, with the unmarked Lovren allowed time and space to head home from inside the six-yard box. The remainder of the first half was played at a more sedate pace although Coutinho, full of intelligent movement and clever flicks, continued to threaten in the final third in combination with Sturridge and Sterling. Gerrard brought a superb one-handed diving save from Langerak with a curling free-kick on the stroke of half-time, and shortly after the interval the home side put the result beyond doubt. Sterling seized upon a misplaced pass and found the unmarked Coutinho who swivelled and then placed it into the net past the hapless Langerak to get the goal his performance deserved. Henderson, who had been full of endeavour and energy throughout, tapped home Liverpool's fourth from close range just after the hour mark. Rodgers, with one eye on the visit of Southampton in their opening league game, made a number of substitutions throughout the second period as Lucas Leiva Jordan Ibe, Rickie Lambert, Jose Enrique, Martin Kelly and Joe Allen were all introduced. The changes to personnel saw Liverpool's passing become disjointed in the final half hour as the game petered out as contest. But Dortmund, well short of match fitness, rarely troubled a Liverpool defence marshalled well by Martin Skrtel and Lovren throughout."

The video which runs for around one minute appeared online at the weekend and was the subject of much talk in Germany. The footage, apparently filmed two days after Germany's 1-0 extra-time victory over Argentina in the World Cup final, prompted Schweinsteiger to issue an apology on his Facebook page. ""I would like to ask forgiveness from the fans, officials and players of Borussia Dortmund. I don't want to make things out to be better than they are. It's a well known supporters song, but I didn't intend to offend anyone,"" said Schweinsteiger. afp"

That means the 23-year-old will likely miss the start of the Bundesliga on August 22 and also the September 16 kick-off of the Champions League, for which Dortmund qualified as runners-up of the German league. Gundogan has not played for Germany since his injury, sustained in the national team's 3-3 draw with Paraguay in August 2013. In that time he has played just three games for Dormtund: the German Supercup, a first round match of the German Cup and the first Bundesliga match of last season. afp"

""And secondly, it would be of no use to make an offer because we have no intention of letting Marco go,"" he added of reports linking Barcelona with a 35-million-euro ($47.7) bid for the player. Reus missed out on the trip to Brazil after tearing a ligament during a friendly against Armenia on Friday, and has been sidelined for six weeks. ""Our team doctor has put a special programme in place for Marco,"" explained Zorc. ""But the hardest thing is to try and find the right balance between the medical treatment and the holidays he needs after a long season and the disappointment of missing out on the World Cup."" Reus, 25, scored 16 goals in the Bundesliga and a superb double against Real Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals. He signed for Dortmund in January 2012 from Bundesliga rivals Moenchengladbach and his contract runs until 2017 with the Bundesliga runners-up."

He was helped off the pitch by two of the medical staff and taken to hospital in Mainz where scans revealed the damage. ""Marco is obviously very disappointed to miss the World Cup and also for us it is a real blow,"" said German coach Joachim Loew. ""When we learnt last night (Friday) that the injury was to the ligament we knew his chances of going to the World Cup were over."" Loew called up the 22-year-old central defender Shkodran Mustafi, capped just once and who plays for Serie A side Sampdoria. Reus's withdrawal is a serious blow to Loew as he had been in superb form towards the end of the season, scoring eight goals and creating five in the last nine games of the Bundesliga season. He also scored a double against eventual Champions League winners Real Madrid in their quarter-final second leg match. Reus is the latest big star to see his World Cup hopes dashed because of injury. Colombia's talismanic striker Radamel Falcao, France winger Franck Ribery and Italian midfielder and AC Milan skipper Riccardo Montolivo have all been ruled out in the past week. Mustafi, who had a spell at English Premier League side Everton before joining Sampdoria, had been left out of the original 23-man squad named by Loew last Monday following a 2-2 draw in the friendly with Cameroon. ""We are taking someone (Mustafi) who was with us at the training camp (in Italy) with us and who is into the rhythm of the squad,"" said Loew. ""As regards filling Reus's position on the pitch we are blessed with numbers as we have (Thomas) Mueller, (Mario) Goetze, (Lukas) Podolski, (Andre) Schuerrle and (Julian) Draxler. ""We felt that the defence is more likely to pick up suspensions through yellow and red cards so hence we opted for Mustafi."" The German squad fly out to Brazil later on Saturday. They have been drawn in a tough group, Group G, which sees them begin their campaign on June 16 against Cristiano Ronaldo-led Portugal. 2010 World Cup quarter-finalists Ghana and the United States, coached by former German handler Jurgen Klinsmann, make up the rest of the group."

851,07/06/2014,03:10,Football: Black Friday as World Cup casualties mount,France star Franck Ribery was ruled out of the World Cup Friday as fears of burnout mounted over a lengthening list of players who will miss the tournament through injury.,"Ribery's withdrawal came after the Bayern Munich winger pulled up in pain with a back injury at France's Clairefontaine training camp on the outskirts of Paris. France manager Didier Deschamps confirmed the 31-year-old would miss the tournament along with Lyon midfielder Clement Grenier, who had been nursing a thigh injury. ""We had stepped up (Ribery's) level of work this week and it was in a training session this morning, before even he could join team training, which involved him running and stepping up his routine that he pulled up with a sharp pain in his back,"" Deschamps said. ""We had him undergo examinations which unfortunately confirmed that he had aggravated his back problem and there was no question of him being able to either train nor play."" Ribery's withdrawal deprives France of their prime attacking focal point, who a year ago cemented his position as one of world football's top talents. Later Friday, Germany were also given a huge fright when midfielder Marco Reus hobbled out of his team's 6-1 drubbing of Armenia in Mainz. The Borussia Dortmund star -- a certain starter in the German line-up -- limped off in agony after the injury. ""I don't know yet what it is, we have to wait,"" said concerned Germany coach Joachim Loew. ""You could see the foot was swollen and I hope it's not a ligament (injury)."" With Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo also struggling to be fit in time for his country's Group G opener with the Germans on June 16, coach Paulo Bento reflected on the toll that a gruelling European season takes on the sport's top players. Even though Ribery and Reus play in the Bundesliga, which allows players a substantial mid-season break, Bento questioned whether the physical demands placed on footballers was now too great. ""For a few years it's normal that players arrive at the World Cup or European Championships tired -- physically and emotionally -- because they have long, long seasons, mainly in Europe,"" Bento said. ""Things are not getting any better. The players are being forced to play more matches and recovery time is getting less and less. ""I don't think we (the football authorities) are going in the right direction."" France and Germany were not the only teams struggling with injury concerns on Friday. Colombia have already seen talismanic striker Radamel Falcao ruled out of the tournament after he lost his battle to recover from a serious knee injury. Falcao, who has scored 20 goals in 51 international appearances, suffered knee ligament damage in a French Cup tie in January and has not played since. Spain too have been waiting on the fitness of champions Atletico Madrid's Brazil-born striker Diego Costa, who is battling an ongoing hamstring problem that forced him off in the early stages of last month's Champions League final. England meanwhile also have injury concerns, with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain limping out of Wednesday's 2-2 draw with Ecuador with a knee ligament strain. The injury has left the Arsenal star struggling to be fit for England's June 14 Group D meeting with Italy in Manaus. There was better news for Chile however who had been fretting over a shoulder injury suffered by Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez. Scans revealed only a moderate inflammation and Chile officials said they expected the forward to line up for the team's opening Group G game on Friday."
852,06/06/2014,17:19,Football: France's Ribery out of World Cup,France's World Cup hopes suffered a massive blow Friday when star winger Franck Ribery withdrew from the tournament because of a back injury that has virtually stopped him running.,"The latest in a series of injuries to hit the 31-year-old Bayern Munich forward's this year, flared up again Friday and forced the last-minute change on the shocked French camp. ""We had stepped up his level of work this week and it was in a training session this morning, before even he could join team training, which involved him running and stepping up his routine that he pulled up with a sharp pain in his back,"" Deschamps told a press conference. ""We had him undergo examinations which unfortunately confirmed that he had aggravated his back problem and there was no question of him being able to either train nor play,"" the coach added. Ribery, who has scored 16 goals in 80 appearances for France, had said before the tournament that this would be his last World Cup. Deschamps also announced that midfielder Clement Grenier would not be fit for Brazil because of a groin injury. He called up Montpellier's attacking midfielder Remy Cabella and Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin as replacements. Quitting the tournament completes a miserable six months for Ribery, veteran of the past two World Cups, who arrived at France's training camp already laid low with the back pain. His form even before that had dipped after he suffered depression which he blamed on his failure to land the Ballon d'Or trophy for the world player of the year. He finished third behind Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo and Argentina's Lionel Messi. Ribery underwent a buttock operation and his performances on his return to the Bayern team were way below his stunning displays in 2013 when Bayern won Europe's Champions League and every Germany trophy. The back problem plagued him into the dying weeks of the domestic season and prevented him from playing in Bayern's two final Bundesliga matches. He had not been fit to train even after he appeared in Bayern's German Cup final win over Borussia Dortmund on   May 17. His withdrawal means he misses also the chance to atone for his role in France's humiliating 2010 World Cup finals campaign. Ribery was part of the he French team that went on strike for a training session in protest at striker Nicolas Anelka being sent home for a foul-mouthed outburst against coach Raymond Domenech. Ribery was given a three game suspension for his role. But he returned to become a central figure in the French team. The loss is a major blow to Deschamps as Ribery was one of only perhaps two world class players in the squad, with Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema. Ribery has instilled fear into opposing teams for years with blistering runs as he displayed in the 2006 World Cup, playing a large part in France's surprising acheivement in reaching the final. The class that he was capable of and which France will miss was seen to devastating effect in the 2012-2013 season for Bayern Munich. In a remarkable 12 months, Ribery -- whose face was scarred in a car crash as a child -- was arguably the standout player in a Bayern side that won the Champions League, Bundesliga, German Cup, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup."
853,05/06/2014,03:02,Football: Premier League stretches wealth gap over Europe rivals,"English Premier League clubs made more than $5 billion in 2013/14 and are stretching their wealth gap over European rivals even though the Bundesliga remains the most profitable championship, a study released Thursday said.","Sky-high wages -- the average Premier League player earns more than £1.6 million ($2.7 million) a year -- have eaten into Premier League profitability. But the Deloitte Annual Review of Football Finance saw no end to the league's growing riches. The league's combined revenues for 2013/14 will increase by almost a third to hit £3.2 billion ($5.3 billion), said Dan Jones of Deloitte's sports business group. The audit and consulting firm called the league's financial performance ""phenomenal"" in the global economic climate. Premier League revenues will reach about £4 billion for 2014/15 as extra broadcasting money pours into the English game, predicted Deloitte senior sports business consultant Austin Houlihan. The review gave exact figures only for 2012/13 when the Premier League made 2.9 billion euros ($3.9 billion), while the German league earned two billion euros, Spain 1.9 billion euros, Italy 1.7 billion euros and France 1.3 billion euros. The big five leagues together saw revenues grow 5% in 2012/13 to 9.8 billion euros, now representing almost half of the overall size of the European football market of 19.9 billion euros. Wages for Wayne Rooney and the army of other Premier League stars accounted for 2.1 billion euros, or 71%, of the English revenues, meaning that the league's profitability fell to three percent. In Germany, wages accounted for just one billion euros, or 51% of revenues. The review said that while Premier League clubs made about 100 million euros in profit for 2012/13, Bundesliga rivals reported about 280 million euros in profit. Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool accounted for most of the English growth in revenue. In Germany, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund generated 80% of new revenues, said the review. The power of the Premier League is seen in the fact that more than 100 players from English clubs were named in provisional squads for countries at the World Cup. Their performances at the tournament, starting June 12, could increase transfer values ""and that in turn could affect the value of clubs,"" Deloitte's Houlihan told AFP. The visibility is also driving revenues for the Premier League. Much of the extra cash is coming from domestic television deals since BT Sport entered the broadcasting rights battle against BSkyB. Each match broadcast live now generates about eight million euros at home and abroad, said Deloitte. And the league is also earning growing amounts from foreign markets in Asia, the Middle East and North America. Foreign television deals will bring in more than 2.7 billion euros over the 2013-2016 seasons, up 50% over the previous three years, the review said. ""Ownership of a Premier League club continues to be a trophy asset of global appeal,"" said the review. ""The quality and rivalry of the competition and the cosmopolitan spread of the players have all created an intense interest,"" said Houlihan. He added that ""a significant gap"" will grow between the earning power of the Premier League and European rivals in coming years. But English clubs are also ploughing increased amounts into wages in a bid to keep the best players and a place in the super-rich championship. Deloite said it was likely that more than 60% of the extra revenue in 2013/14 will go on player wages. It predicted overall spending on player salaries would reach a new Premier League record of about 2.7 billion euros. But the overall increase in revenue would bring the wage-revenue ratio below 70% for the first time since 2009/10. UEFA, European football's governing body, has imposed stricter regulations on club spending, to make them live within their means. ""The early signs are that continental European clubs have generally reacted more rapidly and radically to this change than their wealthier English counterparts,"" said Deloitte. Both the English Premier League champions Manchester City and French title winners Paris Saint Germain agreed sanctions packages with UEFA last month that will see them comply with UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules."

But stand-in captain Per Mertesacker admitted the Germans must raise their game before the World Cup. ""For long spells, we didn't play well,"" admitted the Arsenal centre-back Mertesacker. ""As long as we keep losing possession quickly, we'll have problems against any other side in the world."" With two weeks to go before their opening World Cup match, goal-scorer Mueller says their remains plenty of work to be done. ""We didn't give a good account of ourselves and we actually made life hard for ourselves,"" said the 24-year-old."
857,01/06/2014,13:38,Football: Italy's Immobile on the move to Dortmund,Italy striker Ciro Immobile confirmed on Sunday he is joining German giants Borussia Dortmund from his Serie A outfit Torino for a fee reported to be 19.4million euros ($26.4million).,"The 24-year-old, the leading scorer in Serie A last season with 22 goals, made his debut for Italy in their goalless draw with the Republic of Ireland in London on Saturday in a World Cup warm-up match. ""It is decided. I only have to put my signature on the contract. On Monday, I'm going to Germany,"" he told Italian broadcaster Rai Sport. Representatives from Immobile's former club Juventus, who still part own the striker, and their city rivals Torino have met to discuss the details of the transfer, according to Italian sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport. The two clubs will split the transfer fee evenly according to the Gazzetta. Immobile is set to replace Dortmund's top-scorer, Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, who will join rivals Bayern Munich for next season."
858,26/05/2014,02:05,Football: Atletico domestic success breaks continental mould,Atletico Madrid fans could be forgiven for feeling that there was a crushing sense of inevitability about their defeat to rivals Real in the final of the Champions League on Saturday.,"For all that Diego Simeone's side went into European football's showpiece game in Lisbon as Spanish champions, having finished three points clear of both Barcelona and Real, they remain the David against their city neighbours' Goliath and they could only continue to upset the odds for so long. At the start of the season, the bookmakers' odds on Atletico winning the Spanish title were much the same as those on Aberdeen or Motherwell pipping Celtic to the Scottish championship. Nobody could have foreseen Atletico winning the double of domestic league and Champions League. In the end, it took a 93rd-minute Sergio Ramos equaliser to save Real, who won 4-1 after extra time to lift the European Cup for the 10th time. ""This will make us better,"" vowed Atletico coach Simeone after Saturday's defeat. ""Now the rest of the world knows that Atletico can compete."" A week earlier, after winning La Liga, the Argentine had declared that ""there is no replacement for hard work"", but with a budget that is only around a quarter of that of Real and Barca, their domestic dominance may not last too long. Indeed, while they succeded in Spain, Europe's other leading leagues turned out to be more predictable than ever before. In Germany, Bayern Munich were champions in record quick time, clinching the Bundesliga title with seven games to spare and ending 19 points clear of Borussia Dortmund despite taking their foot off the accelerator in the closing weeks. They didn't lose a single match until after securing the title and went on to add the German Cup for good measure. In France, mega-rich Paris Saint-Germain confirmed their dominance as they retained the Ligue 1 title with a record 89 points, nine points more than runners-up Monaco, whose own tally was a new club record. And in Italy, the country's richest and most decorated club Juventus won a third straight title with a record tally of 102 points, finishing 17 points clear of runners-up Roma. Money is almost everything in football today. In England, Liverpool briefly appeared poised to win a first title since 1990 before Manchester City, fuelled by huge injections of cash from their Abu Dhabi-based owners, emerged to be crowned Premier League champions for the second time in three seasons. They did so by scoring 102 goals, one short of the Premier League record set by Chelsea in 2010. Liverpool were the season's hard-luck story, as they came so close to ending a 24-year wait to win a 19th English top-flight title, but having climbed from seventh to second in the space of a year their manager Brendan Rodgers was happy to label the season ""a wonderful adventure."" The likes of Laurent Blanc at PSG and Pep Guardiola at Bayern could not get away with saying that if they went one season without winning silverware. ""I get the impression that our season is only measured on what we have done in Europe. It is a bit simplistic,"" bemoaned Blanc after leading the French capital club to a domestic double, as well as a quarter-final exit from the Champions League. ""You have to win everything here, but even when you do, it's still not enough,"" admitted Guardiola, whose season featured four trophies altogether but will probably be best remembered for a Champions League semi-final hammering by Real Madrid. Madrid president Florentino Perez's exuberant celebrations in Lisbon were understandable given the spending he has sanctioned on his club's quest to win that 10th European Cup, or 'La Decima'. But with the world's two most expensive players at his disposal in Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, it was only a matter of time before they got there. Meanwhile, having broken the mould at home, and on their run in Europe, Atletico will struggle to fend off approaches from elsewhere for their best players over the summer. Their ability to do that will determine to what extent they really can compete again next season."
859,21/05/2014,15:40,Football: Immobile ready for Dortmund move,Torino striker Ciro Immobile nudged forward his mooted move to Borussia Dortmund when he said he would make sure his tough Neapolitan accent would be understood by his future teammates at the Bundesliga club.,"Immobile is one of seven strikers at Italy's 10-day training camp for the World Cup looking to join the five that will be part of Cesare Prandelli's final 23-man squad for Brazil. His chances have been boosted significantly by topping the Serie A scoring charts on 22 goals ahead of Luca Toni (20) and Carlos Tevez (19) - an achievement which alerted several clubs to Immobile's potential, with Dortmund his preferred destination according to recent reports. Speaking Wednesday at Italy's pre-World Cup training camp, Immobile said: ""After a season like I've just had it's only normal to harbour bigger ambitious and to try to take your game to another level. ""I would love to play in the Champions League next season, it would be huge for my game."" Immobile quipped the only obstacle standing in the way of a move to Germany would be the language barrier. ""I've spoken to a lot of co-players with experience of the Bundesliga. Plus the German league has improved a lot,"" added the 24-year-old. ""The only problem remains the language (barrier), but we Neapolitans know how to make most people understand us!"" Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowski has already agreed to join Bayern Munich for next season although having finished runner-up in the league Dortmund, who were Champions League runners-up in 2013, are set for a fresh assault on the competition. The German club's chief executive officer, Hans-Joachim Watzke, tried to play down reports the clubs had agreed a deal last week but admitted: ""I can only confirm that the player Immobile really wants to join us."""
860,20/05/2014,16:46,Football: Cup final error reopens technology debate,Bundesliga clubs are set to vote again on whether to introduce goal-line technology into German football after Borussia Dortmund were controversially disallowed a goal in last weekend's cup final defeat.,"Bayern Munich claimed the league and cup double at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on Saturday after Arjen Robben and Thomas Mueller scored extra-time goals. But referee Florian Meyer failed to award Dortmund a 65th-minute goal, although replays showed a header by Borussia defender Mats Hummels had crossed the line. Bayern's defender Dante was behind the goal-line when he cleared the ball, but despite furious protests from the Borussia players, the goal was not awarded. Just two months ago, Germany's 36 professional clubs voted by a clear majority against providing goal-line technology for referees with high costs being cited as the main reason. Technology in German football has been a hot topic especially since Bayer Leverkusen's Stefan Kiessling was awarded a goal last October against Hoffenheim, but replays showed the ball entered the goal through a hole in the side netting. With Hummel's non-goal being labelled ""Torklau"" ('goal theft') in the German media, the German Football League (DFL) have said they can put the vote to the clubs again. ""If it is the wish of the clubs, a new vote on the introduction of goal-line technology would not be an issue,"" said Andreas Rettig, the DFL's managing director. ""The DFL is already well prepared in regards to this issue."" Even Bayern, who benefited from Hummel's non-goal in Berlin, is in favour of a fresh vote as both the Bavarian giants and Dortmund voted in favour of introducing goal-line technology earlier this year. ""I was disappointed that the league didn't commit itself to goal-line technology and we let the referees remain in the dark about what was happening on the pitch,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told Bavarian television. ""The Bundesliga must precede and there must be a vote on goal-line technology. ""We're talking, of course, about money, but it would be a sensible investment. ""Then we wouldn't be having discussions like the ones we saw after Berlin."" Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German Football Association (DFB) has said they are in favour of introducing technology, but the clubs would need to vote for it. The boss of Germany's referees, Herbert Fandel, the head of the DFB's referees commission, said his officials would welcome the help. ""It if unfortunate that we have no goal-line technology in our highly-professional football,"" said Fandel. ""Goal-line technology would eliminate such fruitless discussions like we had on Saturday."" Likewise, World Cup referee Felix Brych said German officials would welcome the technology. ""We would all be happy if we could get some help in this area. I can speak for all referees in this regards,"" he said."

Guardiola finishes his first season in charge of Bayern with four trophies having already won the Bundesliga title, Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup. Having arrived in Bavaria with a glowing reputation after winning 14 titles in four seasons at Barcelona, Guardiola says the current campaign has been tough. ""It's my fifth year as a coach and it's been the hardest year of my career,"" said Guardiola. ""My German isn't so good and coming in after (predecessor) Jupp Heynckes won the treble, wasn't easy for me. ""Each trainer has his own ideas and I know the players were thinking, 'why do we have to make changes?'"" Bayern lifted the German Cup for a record 17th time to claim the domestic league and cup double and the Champions League was the only title to elude them this season. But Guardiola admitted he deserved criticism from the German media in the wake of their 4-0 home drubbing by Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final, second-leg, and says Bayern must improve. ""The criticism was quite justified, I did things I shouldn't have done,"" said Guardiola. ""I made mistakes in our playing style and tactics against Real, but things like that can happen in big games against big clubs. ""Now I know a bit more about German football, you have to win everything here, but even when you do, it's still not enough. I am happy, but we have to improve."" Having also scored the late winner in the 2013 Champions League final against Borussia at Wembley, Netherlands winger Robben again broke Dortmund hearts before Mueller's late second. ""We were finished at the end,"" admitted Dortmund's coach Jurgen Klopp who was left fuming after television replays showed a second-half Mats Hummels header crossed the goal-line, but was not given. ""We tortured ourselves and gave everything. In the phase when we were stronger, we scored a goal, which wasn't given. ""That should have been seen (by the referee) even without goal-line technology."" Germany head coach Joachim Loew was a relieved man after his captain Philipp Lahm and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer picked up only minor knocks less than a month before the World Cup in Brazil. ""Lahm had a knock on the fibula, which was painful, but the team doctor is convinced it won't be a problem for the World Cup,"" said Bayern's media director Markus Hoerwick. ""Manuel Neuer has a shoulder injury, but it shouldn't be a problem."" There was no fairytale finish for Poland striker Robert Lewandowski who had promised to finish his four years at Dortmund by lifting the cup before joining Bayern next season. This was the fourth and final time Germany's top two sides met this season with both teams finishing with two wins a piece. ""It is great to have won the double,"" said Lahm. ""You can't always repeat a treble season. ""We have had to take a lot of criticism in the last few weeks, some of it justified, some of it not."""

865,17/05/2014,03:03,Football: Schweinsteiger injuries worry Germany,Midfield general Bastian Schweinsteiger left Bayern Munich's final Bundesliga match of the season with a knee injury giving Germany fans another scare ahead of the World Cup.,"Germany desperately need Schweinsteiger to be fit for the Brazil campaign, but it has been a season of many absences. And noone is giving a guarantee that he will be fit to start the Brazil campaign. The 29-year-old will celebrate a decade in the Germany team just before their opening Group G game against Portugal on June 16 having won his 101st cap in the 1-0 friendly win over Chile in March. A defensive midfield shoo-in for club and country, Schweinsteiger's appearances for Bayern Munich this season have been restricted by a trio of injuries. Back-to-back ankle surgeries hampered him in pre-season, then in November and December before he suffered an inflamed knee ligament at a training camp in Qatar in January. He returned with a vengeance on his first full appearance over 90 minutes in mid-March when he curled home a free-kick for the winner as Bayer Leverkusen lost 2-1 in Munich. He also scored in the 1-1 draw at home to Arsenal in the last 16 as Bayern reached the Champions League quarter-finals 3-1 on aggregate, then netted in their 2-0 league win at Mainz. Having only played 16 of Bayern's first 27 league matches, Schweinsteiger gained valuable match fitness in 2014. But Bayern's defeat by Real Madrid in the Champions League was a psychological blow and the knock to the knee last weekend did not help. ""With his class and experience, he has a big influence on our game,"" said Germany coach Joachim Loew. ""When he is able to play 90 minutes, with his confidence on the ball and tactical awareness, he is very valuable for us. ""Other players respond when they see Bastian is playing well. ""But you can see that he was injured for a long time."" Schweinsteiger claimed his seventh German league title when Bayern were finally confirmed Bundesliga champions with a record seven games to spare after their 3-1 win at Hertha Berlin. Bayern captain Philipp Lahm switched from right-back to partner him in the defensive midfield partner in Berlin and Loew could repeat the move in Brazil. Loew is low on defensive midfield options to partner Schweinsteiger with Real Madrid's Sami Khedira struggling with a knee injury. Borussia Dortmund's Ilkay Gundogan has not played since August with a back injury and a virus, while Dortmund's Sven Bender is out with a pelvis injury and also faces a race against time to be fit for Brazil. Bayern's Toni Kroos, who has had a stellar season in the attacking midfield role for the European champions, is an option to drop back into the Number Six position or Lahm could be moved across from right-back. Having broken into the first team as a 19-year-old at Euro 2004, when the Germans failed to make it past the first round, Schweinsteiger played a key role as Germany finished third at the 2006 World Cup on home soil. He earned the man-of-the-match award with two long-range strikes in the 3-1 play-off win over Portugal and nearly finished with a hat-trick. When Michael Ballack was injured just before the last World Cup, Schweinsteiger filled his midfield role and when fit, is Loew's first choice in midfield. He will be at the heart of Germany's bid to claim a fourth World Cup title in Brazil, providing he avoids a fourth injury of the season."

He sat out training on Thursday as ""more of a precaution"" and Dortmund Klopp's confirmed his star striker will be fit to make his final appearance in the Dortmund shirt before leaving to join Bayern next season. ""We were very careful with him, he'll be ready to race on Saturday,"" added Klopp. Lewandowski has said he wants to bow out after four years at Dortmund with another title having scored a hat-trick in Borussia's 5-2 drubbing of Bayern in the 2012 final. ""This is not the time to talk about memories, but Robert has had a perfect development in Dortmund and I hope it will not be the end,"" said Klopp. Australia goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak, who has been included in the Socceroos' provisional World Cup squad, will miss the cup final as Dortmund's reserve goalkeeper after damaging knee ligaments. But the 25-year-old does not need an operation and is expected to be fit for Brazil."
867,16/05/2014,12:03,Football: Lahm defends Bayern's 'top' Guardiola,Captain Philipp Lahm has defended Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola following criticism from France winger Franck Ribery on the eve of Saturday's German Cup final against Borussia Dortmund.,"Despite having wrapped up this season's Bundesliga title in record time, Bayern's hopes of defending their Champions League title were ended by their 4-0 semi-final home defeat to Real Madrid when Guardiola admitted he made a ""big mistake"" in his selection. Bayern are looking to claim their fourth title this season at Berlin's Olympic Stadium in the cup final having already secured the league, Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup titles. Borussia lead this season's series between the two teams, which has been dubbed Germany's ""Der Klassiker"", with two victories to one having beaten Bayern in August's German Super Cup final and enjoyed a 3-0 league win in Munich in April. Earlier this week, Ribery told German magazine Kicker that he was unhappy with Guardiola's rotation system and criticised the lack of regular matches, but Lahm has said Guardiola is the right man for the job. ""This man is top-top-top,"" Lahm told Munich-based newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung after Guardiola took over from predecessor Jupp Heynckes in June. ""He came to us at the right time. ""If we wanted to play things tight at the back and only counter-attack, then he wouldn't have been the right coach, but I find his playing ideas fit perfectly to a club like Bayern."" Under Guardiola, Bayern have developed a playing system based on possession and maximum control with all 10 outfield players moving up into the opponents half and even goalkeeper Manuel Neuer often well out of his area. ""I think it's fantastic,"" said Lahm. ""100 passes, 100 ball contacts, while giving the opponent no ball to play with and no room to move -- that makes football fun."" Having dominated for the majority of the season, the frailties of Guardiola's system were exposed by Real and Dortmund who counter-attacked quickly and capitalised on any opportunities which came their way. ""Because we are often defending so high up the field, if someone is a bit slow to react in a given situation then it can give our opponents a huge chance,"" admitted Lahm. The Bayern captain said Guardiola's system works well, but it is up the players to make sure it functions properly. ""It's a wonderful system, I love it very much, but you have to play at 100 percent,"" said Lahm, who found himself regularly moved from his customary right-back position to defensive midfield throughout the season by Guardiola. ""For three-quarters of the season, we were praised across Europe for our dominance for the amount of goals we scored and the few we conceded. ""I am convinced that our style of play is exactly the right one."""

Mueller insists Bayern start as favourites at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, but after Borussia have won eight of their final 10 matches this season, ""the current trend (of results) has brought Dortmund a step closer to us"". ""We can't allow ourselves to give away reckless turnovers. If we do, Dortmund will be just waiting to counter-attack us."" Bayern are bidding to win the domestic double for the tenth time, having already secured the Bundesliga title in March with a record seven games to spare. In contrast, Dortmund are chasing their fourth cup final victory having finished their league campaign second to their Bavarian rivals in the table. There are plenty of sub-plots to the final, not least Bayern's Germany star Mario Goetze up against his former club having been raised in Dortmund. ""It is definitely something special and emotional,"" admitted the 21-year-old, who scored the opening goal in Bayern's 3-0 win in Dortmund on his first return to Borussia's Westfalenstadion in November. ""My first game against Dortmund was the icing on the cake, but I have now been at Bayern for a year and we want to win the title, that's all that counts."" Poland striker Robert Lewandowski will play his final match in the famous yellow-and-black jersey before joining Bayern and the 25-year-old has vowed to sign off his four years playing for Dortmund by lifting the title. Bayern suffered at the hands of Lewandowski in the 2012 cup final when he netted a hat-trick in a 5-2 drubbing of the Bavarian giants. Lewandowski, who finished as the league's top-scorer with 20 goals in 33 matches, warmed up for the cup final with two goals in Dortmund's 4-0 Bundesliga win at the Olympic Stadium last Saturday against Hertha Berlin. Bayern have injury worries with Spain midfielder Thiago Alcantara definitely out with torn knee ligaments, while France winger Franck Ribery (back) and Germany defensive midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger (knee) face a race against time. Dortmund are at near full strength with long-term knee injury victims winger Jakub Blaszczykowski and centre-back Neven Subotic missing. Ribery stirred things up in the Bayern camp on the eve of the final by criticising Guardiola's rotation policy as the Spaniard struggles to give his star-studded squad enough game time. ""Sometimes you play, sometimes you sit on the bench, sometimes you stay at home and aren't even in the squad,"" Ribery, who was shortlisted for the 2013 Ballon d'Or award, told German magazine Kicker. ""Personally, I need a break after five or six games, not after just one. ""If we lose, it won't have been a good season for me any more,"" admitted Ribery, who has said he is fit to play, but unlikely to last the 90 minutes in Berlin. This will be the 71st German Cup final and the 20th time Bayern are involved and the Bavarians are looking for their fourth title this season having collected the Bundesliga, Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup titles already this season."
869,15/05/2014,17:32,Football: Injury-hit Ribery criticises Bayern's Guardiola,Franck Ribery has criticised Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola as he battles to be fit for Saturday's German Cup final showdown against Borussia Dortmund amidst the Bavarians' midfield injury concerns.,"Spain midfielder Thiago Alcantara will definitely miss the clash at Berlin's Olympic Stadium having been ruled out of next month's World Cup after suffering a new knee injury on Monday while on the verge of making his comeback. The German champions are also waiting on the fitness of defensive midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, who has strained knee ligaments, and winger Ribery, who is struggling with a back problem. But Ribery said Guardiola's rotation sytem has not helped him with the Spaniard struggling to give his star-studded squad enough games during his first season in charge. ""Sometimes you play, sometimes you sit on the bench, sometimes you stay at home and aren't even in the squad,"" Ribery, who was shortlisted for the 2013 Ballon d'Or award, told German magazine Kicker. ""It was a new situation for everyone. ""Personally, I need a break after five or six games, not after just one."" But the timing of Ribery's comments did little to impress director of sport Matthias Sammer. ""The time to talk about these things is not just before a cup final,"" said Bayern boss Sammer. Bayern are chasing the double having already won the Bundesliga title, but while Guardiola can win his fourth title since taking charge last June, a third defeat to Dortmund this season would mean a bad 2013/14 campaign for the Bavarian giants, especially having bowed out of the Champions League in the semi-finals. ""If we lose, it won't have been a good season for me any more,"" admitted Ribery, who has said he is fit to play, but unlikely to last the 90 minutes in Berlin. Bayern are monitoring the Frenchman and Germany's Schweinsteiger, who has been unable to train this week, on a ""day-to-day"" basis according to Sammer. ""They are world-class players,"" he said. ""But whether they only play 20, 30 minutes or aren't even available won't be a factor on Saturday. ""Everyone must be willing, in a sporting sense, to die for each other."" This will be the 71st German Cup final and the 20th time Bayern are involved. Dortmund are looking for their fourth cup final victory while Bayern have lifted the trophy a record 16 times and can add the domestic cup to their league, Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup titles already collected this season. Borussia lead this season's series between the two teams, which has been dubbed ""Der Klassiker"" with two victories to one having beaten Bayern in August's German Super Cup final and enjoyed a 3-0 league win in Munich in April."

The German champions are also waiting on the fitness of defensive midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, who has strained knee ligaments, and winger Franck Ribery, who is struggling with a back problem. Bayern are chasing the double having already won the Bundesliga title, but while coach Pep Guardiola can win his fourth title since taking charge last June, a third defeat to Dortmund this season would mean a bad 2013/14 campaign for the Bavarian giants.

871,14/05/2014,16:24,Football: Bayern's Ribery doubtful for German Cup final,Bayern Munich star Franck Ribery admits he faces a race against time to be fit for Saturday's Germany Cup final showdown against Borussia Dortmund in Berlin due to a back injury.,"""I feel good, but 90 minutes could be difficult,"" admitted the 31-year-old France star after training on Wednesday. Ribery has been able to train with the team since Tuesday but admits it has been frustrating to miss training recently because of the pain. ""There hasn't been much I've been able to do and it makes it difficult to get into a rhythm,"" he said. Bayern are also waiting on midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger who suffered a strained knee ligament in Saturday's final Bundesliga match against Stuttgart. Director of sport Matthias Sammer said they are looking at the injury ""on a day-to-day"" basis and coach Pep Guardiola will make a decision with Schweinsteiger, who has been unable to train all week. With the Bundesliga secured, Bayern are eager to finish the season with the double to compensate for being knocked out of the Champions League's semi-finals after a 4-0 drubbing at the hands of Real Madrid. The cup final is a repeat of the 2013 Champions League final and Berlin's imposing Olympic Stadium will host the fourth and final time Bayern and Dortmund meet this season. Borussia lead this season's 'Der Klassiker' series with two wins to Bayern's one after Dortmund's 3-0 league rout in Munich last month. ""The German Cup final is on a par with the Champions League final for us,"" said Guardiola who is hoping to win his fourth title of the season having also lifted the UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup. There are several sub-plots to this season's final. Bayern's Germany midfielder Mario Goetze will be up against his former club. And Poland striker Robert Lewandowski will be making his final appearance in the yellow and black shirt before joining Bayern next season. The hot-shot has vowed to end his four years in Dortmund with another title having scored a hat-trick against Bayern in the 2012 cup final when Munich were routed 5-2 by Dortmund. ""Lewandowski's a fantastic player and we have to watch out for him,"" conceded Bayern's Brazil centre back Dante. ""But it's not all about him on Saturday. They also have (Marco) Reus, (Pierre-Emerick) Aubameyang and several other players who can hurt us going forward. ""We need everyone to be at the top of their game on Saturday. ""I don't just mean the eleven that start the match and I'm not talking about an 'ordinary' good performance. ""We really need 18 top, top performances to beat Borussia Dortmund."" While Bayern's form took a sharp dip after winning the Bundesliga title in March with a record seven games to spare, Dortmund finished the season in style by winning eight of their final ten matches, including that 3-0 victory in Munich. ""Our preparation wasn't ideal,"" said Dante with regards to Bayern's last meeting with Dortmund. ""We played Manchester United (in the Champions League quarter-final, second leg) on the Wednesday before and were a little preoccupied with the semi-final draw on the Friday, so we perhaps didn't give Dortmund the attention they deserve. ""That's no excuse though - Dortmund were the better team."""
872,14/05/2014,11:46,Football: Germany's Gundogan reveals Crimea treatment,Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has revealed he travelled to Crimea in a bid to treat the back injury which has forced him out of next month's World Cup.,"The 23-year-old has not played since Germany's 3-3 draw with Paraguay in August 2013 due to inflamed nerves in his back, and told magazine Sport Bild that he even flew to Ukraine to see a specialist. ""I have seen some specialists, including spending time in Ukraine to get an expert's opinion,"" said the Borussia Dortmund defensive midfielder. ""My cousin is a volleyball player for the Turkey national team and she had the same injury a few years ago and was treated successfully there."" Gundogan spent several days in a Crimea children's hospital, which also treats adults, the visit taking place before the recent annexation of Crimea by Russia. Gundogan now says he is on course to be fit when the new Bundesliga season starts on August 22. ""I feel better now and will use the summer months in order to get back to top condition,"" he said. ""My goal is to be fit again for the start of the season and it's a realistic one."" Despite missing the last nine months, Gundogan recently signed a one-year contract extension with Dortmund until 2016."
873,13/05/2014,03:26,Football: Kagawa to take out frustration on World Cup opponents,Manchester United forgotten man Shinji Kagawa will be playing for his career when he takes the stage for Japan at the World Cup finals.,"The 25-year-old playmaker may deny he has a personal agenda after a frustrating season in England, but Japan will hope Kagawa can channel that frustration and help fire them into the knockout stages in Brazil. Kagawa was an instant hit at Old Trafford after being signed by Alex Ferguson in 2012 from Bundesliga heavyweights Borussia Dortmund, but has cut a forlorn figure this term, largely overlooked by ousted manager David Moyes. He has consistently produced the goods for Japan, however, despite the taxing long-haul flights, and has showed shades of annoyance of his plight at Old Trafford. ""Please ask Moyes why I'm not in the side,"" he said in September, after scoring in Japan's 3-1 win over Ghana. Twice a German title-winner with Borussia Dortmund, Kagawa will have a point to prove in Brazil, where Japan face Colombia, Ivory Coast and Greece in Group C. He will be relatively fresh and, perhaps significantly, in the shop window after United's January signing of Juan Mata plunged Kagawa's club future into further doubt. And that could be good news for Japan coach Alberto Zaccheroni, a great admirer of the mercurial midfielder. ""Kagawa can play in the hole behind the strikers or come in from the left to equal effect,"" Italian Zaccheroni said after Japan's 4-2 World Cup warm-up win over New Zealand. ""He has a wonderful ability to come in off the flanks and make things happen."" While AC Milan midfielder Keisuke Honda provides the power and drive in Japan's engine room, Kagawa has an opportunity to be one of the World Cup's stand-out players. Japan do not play under the same suffocating pressure as England, Italy or Germany, for example, and the Asian champions will fancy their chances of progressing to the last 16, as they did in South Africa four years ago, when Kagawa failed to make the squad. Honda's goals propelled Japan to upset wins over Cameroon and Denmark in 2010 before the Blue Samurai bowed out to Paraguay on penalties. Kagawa's vision and eye for the killer ball will make him a real threat in Brazil, while Japan's pressing style and speed on the counter gives them a fighting chance of replicating their achievement last time around and as co-hosts in 2002. The United misfit's cleverness at exploiting gaps in the final third was a key factor in Japan easing through Asian qualifying to secure a fifth successive World Cup appearance in Brazil. As unassuming off the pitch as Japan team-mate Honda is brash and outspoken, Kagawa's treatment at United continues to baffle many. A parody Twitter account called ""Evil Kagawa"" purporting to be the Japanese midfielder poking fun at Moyes in pigeon English for not picking him, has over 270,000 followers, including United team-mates Rio Ferdinand and Michael Carrick. Should Kagawa weave his magic in Brazil and lead Japan into the last 16, a possible clash with England awaits. How ironic it would be for Kagawa to have the last laugh."
874,12/05/2014,02:35,Football: Experimental Germany kick-off World Cup preparations,Germany begin their final preparations for the World Cup on Tuesday in Hamburg as an experimental side faces neighbours Poland in the first of three friendlies.,"Coach Joachim Loew has included just 10 of the players named in his provisional World Cup squad last week, with the remaining 20 absent due to ongoing club commitments. Seven Bayern Munich players and six from Borussia Dortmund are missing with their clubs meeting in the German Cup final in Berlin next Saturday, while Marcell Jansen is preparing for a relegation play-off with his side Hamburg and six more foreign-based players still have club commitments to honour. Instead, Loew will give a chance to a number of young talents against a Poland side who will themselves be deprived of Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowski. ""The result will not be important,"" declared Loew after announcing a squad featuring the likes of Borussia Moenchengladbach duo Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Christoph Kramer and Eintracht Frankfurt's Sebastian Jung, none of whom will go to Brazil. ""Most of the players are young, have just left school or have just finished their first season in the Bundesliga. ""This is a chance for them to show what they can do and experience the international atmosphere, and why not book their place on the plane to Brazil."" That last message was aimed at others, such as 21-year-old Hoffenheim striker Kevin Volland and Schalke's teenage duo Leon Goretzka and Maximilian Meyer, who have been named in the provisional World Cup squad, to show that they deserve to make the final cut. The squad will be cut to 25 or 26 players on Wednesday before later being reduced to the definitive 23. Volland, who has scored 11 goals and set up nine more this season, appears better-placed than most of the Bundesliga's young talents with Loew lacking back-up in attack to the veteran Lazio striker Miroslav Klose. But Loew added: ""Those who don't make it (to the World Cup), are certainly in our thoughts for 2016 (the European Championship in France) and 2018 (the World Cup in Russia)."" After the game against Poland, who will not go to the World Cup but will face Germany again in Euro 2016 qualifying, the coach will hope to get experienced midfielders Sami Khedira and Bastian Schweinsteiger back to full fitness. Khedira, of Real Madrid, is only just returning from a serious knee injury suffered in November while Bayern's Schweinsteiger hurt himself playing against Stuttgart on the final day of the Bundesliga season on Saturday. The reduced German squad will depart for a training camp in the Italian Alps on May 21 before returning to meet Cameroon in a friendly in Moenchengladbach on June 1. After that game, Loew will name his final 23-man squad, and then there will be one last friendly against Armenia in Mainz on June 6 before Germany head to Brazil. The three-time world champions were drawn in Group G at the World Cup alongside Portugal, Ghana and the United States, who are coached by former Germany star Jurgen Klinsmann."

The defender is alleged to have thrown the kebab, a sandwich traditionally filled with grilled meat, salad and garlic sauce, and widely found in fast-food shops on German streets, into the face of one of the Cologne fans, who filed the complaint. ""It is correct that a complaint has been filed against Mr Grosskreutz and a criminal enquiry into assault has been launched,"" Bild quoted a local police spokesman as saying. The 25-year-old player, capped four times for Germany, apologised for his pique of kebab throwing. ""I felt I had been attacked in my private life and I found the situation hurtful,"" Grosskreutz said. ""Of course I would have done better to have thrown the kebab on the ground.

""When you're shown a red card five minutes before the end of the match when you're 4-1 up, then you can call that 'brainless',"" fumed Rummenigge, who said Boateng will be fined a ""large five-figure sum"". ""Such a lack of discipline will not be accepted by Bayern Munich. ""In our jersey, you have to behave respectably and if you don't hear the message, then you have to feel it (in the wallet)."" Boateng's red card in the Bundesliga went down particularly badly just four days after Bayern's 4-0 drubbing at the hands of Real Madrid saw the holders crash out of the Champions League at the semi-final stage. His dismissal means the 25-year-old will be suspended for Bayern's final league match against VfB Stuttgart on Saturday when they will be presented with the Bundesliga trophy at Munich's Allianz Arena.

Having signed for Bayern next season on a free transfer, the Polish hot-shot now has two games left in the Dortmund shirt -- at Hertha Berlin next Saturday in the league, then the Berlin cup final against Bayern on May 17. The 25-year-old was given a standing ovation at the Westfalenstadion having scored 72 league goals in 130 games during his four years at Dortmund and wants to bow out by lifting the German Cup. ""I have always said that I want to sign off with a title,"" said Lewandowski, who was presented with a bouquet and a photo collage of his time in Dortmund.

That's one point ahead of Nuremberg and two in front of Eintracht Braunschweig with those two sides occupying the automatic relegation places. The best former European champions Hamburg can now hope for is a two-legged relegation play-off against the third-placed side in the second division to preserve their top-flight status. Bayern bounced back from Tuesday's 4-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final, second-leg to return to winning ways a fortnight before facing Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final on May 17. ""It wasn't easy after the Champions League defeat, but the win was important for us for the cup final in Berlin,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. ""I wish Hamburg the best of luck and hope they reach the play-offs. A club with their history belongs in the Bundesliga.""

They doubled their lead when Goetze was left free to fire home Robben's corner on 55 minutes, which went in off colleague Thomas Mueller. Goetze grabbed his second when he slotted home Mueller's pass after Robben's shot was saved by Hamburg keeper Rene Adler. Hamburg pulled a goal back with 20 minutes left through Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu before Claudio Pizarro grabbed Bayern's fourth. Bayern defender Jerome Boateng was sent off just before the final whistle for striking Kerem Demirbay. The defeat means Hamburg cannot now finish outside the bottom three, the same fate befalling Nuremberg after their 2-0 defeat at home to Hanover 96. Bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, who lost 1-0 at home to Augsburg thanks to Raul Bobadilla's 94th-minute goal, were already certain of finishing in the bottom three in their first season back in Germany's top flight. As the bottom three are separated by just two points, all that remains to be decided in next weekend's final round of matches is which two go down and who goes into the play-off. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski enjoyed a 3-2 win against Hoffenheim in his final home match for second-placed Borussia Dortmund before joining Bayern next season. Hoffenheim took the lead after just five minutes when Brazilian forward Roberto Firmino beat both Germany defender Mats Hummels and Marcel Schmelzer to drill home his shot. But Dortmund roared back with three goals in five minutes before the break. Germany winger Kevin Grosskreutz slotted in a 29th minute shot, Henrikh Mkhitaryan headed home two minutes later and then Lukasz Piszczek hit their third after a mix up in the Hoffenheim defence from a free-kick. A bad mistake by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who allowed a long-range shot from Niklas Suele to fly through his legs, made it 3-2 to the hosts with 66 minutes gone. Ten-man Schalke 04 need just one more point to secure a direct Champions League place next season after their 2-0 win at Freiburg kept them three points clear of Bayer Leverkusen in third as Dutchman Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored his 59th league goal for the Royal Blues in his 100th Bundesliga game. Leverkusen kept their grip on fourth, and a Champions League play-off place, with a 2-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. But both Borussia Moenchengladbach and Wolfsburg can still claim the Bundesliga's fourth Champions League place next season. 'Gladbach's 3-1 win at home to Mainz keeps them sixth, three points from fourth, while Wolfsburg's 2-1 win at VfB Stuttgart, thanks to Ivica Olic's late goal, also keeps them in the hunt for a Champions League spot, a point below Leverkusen."

""I didn't come here to change German football culture anymore than that of Bayern. But when I speak to my players on a daily basis I can't talk about ideas in which I don't believe,"" he added. Bayern did not lose a single Bundesliga game prior to securing the title in record time at the end of March and they still have a German Cup final to look forward to against Borussia Dortmund on May 17. However, they were found wanting in a 4-0 defeat to Real Madrid on Tuesday in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final tie as the reigning champions bowed out 5-0 on aggregate. In the wake of that defeat, the former Barcelona coach appeared to hint that he didn't have the right players for his style of football, but Guardiola cooled suggestions that he will attempt to overhaul the squad in the summer. ""It is with this system and these players that we achieved plenty of success this season. And we still have a final to play,"" he said. ""After the Cup final, I will speak to 'Kalle' (chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge) and Matthias (Sammer, the sporting director).

""The players need to tell themselves that they are still playing well. It is important ahead of the final,"" he said, before suggesting that Spanish playmaker Thiago Alcantara might be able to return from a knee injury in time to sit on the bench against Dortmund. Guardiola also voiced his relief at seeing defender Holger Badstuber back in full training more than a year after suffering a serious knee injury of his own that has required four operations.

But Bayern's Champions League exit in Tuesday's 4-0 semi-final, second-leg drubbing at home to Real has given Hamburg hope, says Netherlands star Van der Vaart. ""It's a matter of survival and honour for us. If we give our all, then we also have a chance against Bayern,"" said the 31-year-old, who is hoping to play after recovering from a calf injury. But the Dutch playmaker says Hamburg must be confident against Bayern. ""We need to show some balls, Bayern won't give anything away and it would be really bad for them to lose two games in a row,"" he said. Since being confirmed Bundesliga champions with a record seven games to spare at the end of last month, Bayern have produced some below-par performances which culminated in their drubbing at the hands of Real. ""After the defeat to Real, Bayern are sure to have no great desire to get on the plane to Hamburg. We want to annoy them,"" said director of sport Oliver Kreuzer in a radio interview. The Bavarian giants have wounded pride and will be looking to bounce back at Hamburg ahead of their German Cup final against arch rivals Borussia Dortmund in Berlin on May 17. ""We need to quickly lick our wounds so we put in a better performance in the Cup final against Dortmund,"" insisted chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Hamburg have suffered some heavy losses to Bayern recently, being routed 5-0 at home in February's German Cup quarter-finals and humbled 9-2 in Munich in the league in March 2013. Hamburg, for whom Mirko Slomka is their third coach this season after Thorsten Fink and Bert van Marwijk were both fired, are low on confidence after six defeats in their last ten games. Even Kreuzer has voiced doubts they will survive. ""There are legitimate doubts about a positive outcome. I have been waiting for weeks to see a reaction from the players,"" he fumed after Hamburg's lacklustre 3-1 defeat at home to mid-table Augsburg last Sunday, their third loss in a row. Hamburg have a few personnel worries with Germany pair Heiko Westermann, Marcell Jansen and Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu all struggling with injuries or illness. The top two places in the league are already decided with Bayern champions and Borussia Dortmund uncatchable in second. Schalke 04 are set to finish third, but the fight for fourth, which carries the final Champions League place for next season, rages on between Wolfsburg, who are at strugglers VfB Stuttgart, and Bayer Leverkusen, who are at mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt. At the other end of the table, bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig are at home to Augsburg while Nuremberg, who are 17th, host Hanover 96 with both teams knowing defeat could see them automatically relegated."
885,30/04/2014,13:25,Football: Guardiola picks up pieces after Real 'debacle',Pep Guardiola has been left picking up the pieces amidst the fall-out from Bayern Munich's historic 4-0 hammering at home to Real Madrid which dethroned the Champions League holders.,"Bayern suffered their heaviest home defeat in European competition on Tuesday, losing the semi-final 5-0 on aggregate, with Guardiola admitting he made mistakes with both his tactics and selection in Munich. ""Debacle"" was how chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge described the defeat and most of the shell-shocked players expressed their ""deep disappointment"" in the mixed zone. Germany's media did not pull their punches. Bild ran the headline ""Real humiliate Guardiola"" and Munich-based tabloid TZ echoed Rummenigge with ""debacle Dahoam"", using the Bavarian word for 'home'. Bayern had never previously lost in Europe by more than two goals in Munich and the defeat made a mockery of their dream to become the first team to successfully defend the Champions League title. Even with their European crown now gone, Guardiola has still won three titles this season and the German Cup can yet be added to their league, Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup triumphs. But with their coveted Champions League hopes in tatters, Guardiola has already faced criticism of his fast-passing 'Tiki-Taka' football and over reliance on posession after Real hit them on the counter-attack. Having cryptically questioned whether his players were up to playing his style of football, Guardiola then insisted he was ""proud"" of what they had achieved this season prior to the Real drubbing. ""We need to think if this is the best system for the players,"" said Guardiola, who is under contract until June 2016. ""I made a mistake with the tactics, the trainer wasn't good today. ""We played badly, that's my responsibility. ""I made a mistake with our tactics. ""We are at the highest level in Europe where such errors are punished."" Such talk can only come from a head coach who feels secure in his position, but that will change quickly should there be any challenge to Bayern's position at the top of German football. Guardiola has the chance to redeem himself on May 17 when holders Bayern face arch-rivals Borussia Dortmund at Berlin's Olympic Stadium in the German Cup final. A further defeat, or a similar repeat of the 5-2 drubbing Dortmund handed Bayern in the 2012 final, would only confirm Guardiola's poor first season by Bayern's lofty standards. The Spaniard has admitted he has struggled to get the most out of his team since they wrapped up the Bundesliga title with a record seven matches to spare last month. Bayern dropped just four points in the seven months of Bundesliga football before their 3-1 win at Hertha Berlin on March 25 meant they could no longer be caught in the league. Berlin proved to be a watershed as Bayern failed to win their next three games and in the five weeks since they have dropped eight points in insignificant matches with the title won. But their alarming drop-off in form was highlighted by the Real drubbing as Bayern's defence was found badly wanting as three of Real's goals came from set pieces. The Real defeat, when he insisted he was wrong to start Bastian Schweinsteiger and Toni Kroos together in the defensive midfield, is not the first time Guardiola has admitted making mistakes. He named three teenagers in his starting side for the league match at neighbours Augsburg ten days after the title was confirmed in Berlin,  paying for it with a 1-0 defeat which ended their 53-match unbeaten run. Rummenigge has called for calm in their three remaining matches this season and Bayern has the chance to bounce back at Hamburg, who are fighting to stay in Germany's top flight, in the league on Saturday. ""We need to keep our nerve, we were a little spoilt by reaching the (Champions League) final twice in a row,"" he said. ""Despite the anger one feels, we must remain rational and try to make things better. ""We need to quickly lick our wounds so we put in a better performance in the Cup final against Dortmund."""
886,28/04/2014,14:45,Football: Season over for Leverkusen's Kiessling,Bayer Leverkusen must do without injured striker Stefan Kiessling in their bid to qualify for a place in next season's Champions League after the Germany international tore his left hamstring.,"Kiessling will miss Leverkusen's last two league games of the season with the 'Werkself' holding onto fourth in the league, which carries a Champions League play-off berth, by just a point from VfL Wolfsburg. Bayer crashed out of this season's Champions League with a 6-1 aggregate defeat at the hands of Paris St Germain in the last 16 and fired coach Sami Hyypia earlier this month after a run of defeats in a bid to protect their status in next season's competition. The loss of Kiessling is a blow to their hopes under caretaker coach Sascha Lewandowski with a fortnight left in the season. The 30-year-old suffered the injury in Leverkusen's 2-2 draw at home to second-placed Borussia Dortmund on Saturday and a scan confirmed the worst, meaning he will miss his side's final two matches, at home to Eintracht Frankfurt and away to Werder Bremen. Having made his last international appearance at the 2010 World Cup, Kiessling was the Bundesliga's top-scorer last season with 25 goals in 34 league games and has hit the net 19 times for Bayer this season."

Real have never won in Munich after eight defeats and a draw, but Bayern must score at least twice to progress. Madrid also have a terrible overall record in Germany with just two wins, 19 defeats and six draws, but Real eliminated Bundesliga sides Schalke and Borussia Dortmund en route to the semi-finals. With Bayern bidding to reach their fourth Champions League final in five years, the visitors can expect a warm welcome from the home fans in the cauldron of the 70,000-capacity Allianz Arena. Robben, who spent two seasons at Real before moving to Munich in 2009, says Madrid will be under no illusions about what to expect in Bavaria. ""It is clear they will have lots of confidence because of the result in Madrid but they know it won't be easy here,"" said Robben. ""We won't be giving anything away tomorrow. ""Of course they won't be worried, but they also know it won't be easy. ""The Arena in Munich will be on fire. ""We will give everything. We need our fans and the support. ""All 11 players on the pitch and seven on the bench will give everything and we have lots of confidence."" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has turned up the heat for the Munich match by suggesting away ""teams think they are in hell"" at the Allianz Arena. But Real coach Carlo Ancelotti retorted: ""We hope the trees will burn on Wednesday, not Tuesday, when we leave"" after his side's impressive 4-0 Spanish league win at home to Osasuna on Saturday. Real's Gareth Bale started on the bench in the first leg, but with the Welshman having recovered from flu, Ancelotti is expected to play his lethal BBC in atack -- Bale, Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo, who proved his hamstring injury is behind him with two goals against Osasuna. ""It won't be any easier for us if Ronaldo and Bale are playing from the beginning,"" added Robben. ""We were all surprised about their defensive play in Madrid. ""We have to focus on playing offensively and scoring goals but we also have to take care of their counter-attacks."" Having failed to progress from the semi-finals for the last three years, Real are desperate to reach the final in Lisbon on May 24, while Bayern are bidding to become the first team to retain the Champions League title. ""We are all motivated enough,"" said Robben. ""We know Madrid wants the 'Decima' (their 10th European triumph). We are still hungry and we know we can write history with this team so we are as motivated as they are. The two teams have great aims."""

Hamburg won the European Cup in 1983 but have not won any major honours since 1987, and now their status as the only club in Germany's top flight never to have been relegated is under serious threat with only two games of the season remaining. Mirko Slomka's side lie 16th in the table, only a point clear of the automatic relegation places and with a home game against reigning European champions Bayern Munich and a tricky trip to Mainz still to come. Should Hamburg remain third from bottom, they will earn a reprieve in the form of a two-legged play-off against the side which finishes third in the second tier for the right to play top-flight football next season. Borussia Dortmund, who drew 2-2 with Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, will finish the season second to Bayern for the second year running after third-placed Schalke lost 1-0 at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday. A first-half strike from winger Patrick Herrmann gave Gladbach the win in Gelsenkirchen which left Schalke in third and seven points adrift of neighbours Dortmund with two games left. On Saturday, Bayern Munich warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League semi-final second leg at home to Real Madrid with a 5-2 come-from-behind win against Werder Bremen. Three days after their 1-0 first-leg loss in Madrid, Bayern fell behind twice against Bremen at the Allianz Arena before scoring four second-half goals without reply. The flattering scoreline failed to mask Bayern's woeful first-half defending, which must sound the alarm bells for coach Pep Guardiola given the danger of conceding an away goal to Real. Bayern have conceded the first goal in seven of their nine matches since winning the Bundesliga title late last month with a record seven matches to spare. Once again the Munich defence was left wanting in the first 45 minutes before the reigning European champions roared back. Bayern blasted Werder 7-0 in Bremen last December, but Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie fired the visitors into a 1-0 lead after 10 minutes at the Allianz Arena. France winger Franck Ribery equalised before Aaron Hunt capitalised on some poor marking for Bremen's second to make it 2-1 at the break. Bayern equalised again when Thomas Mueller headed on Ribery's corner and Claudio Pizarro was on hand to stab home his shot to make it 2-2 on 54 minutes, then the Peru veteran added his second against his old club four minutes later. Bastian Schweinsteiger then powered home a header on 61 minutes before Arjen Robben hit the top corner of the net to make it 5-2 on 74 minutes, less than 60 seconds after coming off the bench. On Saturday night Dortmund drew 2-2 at fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen with all four goals coming in the first 45 minutes. Goals by Lars Bender and Gonzalo Castro for the hosts were cancelled out by a header from Dortmund's Oliver Kirch and a Marco Reus penalty following a clear handball from Bayer defender Roberto Hilbert. VfL Wolfsburg's own hopes of Champions League qualification were dealt a blow when they were held to a 2-2 draw at home by Freiburg to stay fifth. Eintracht Braunschweig remain rooted to the bottom of the table after their 2-0 defeat at Hertha Berlin with USA international John Anthony Brooks and Tunisia striker Sami Allagui scoring the capital club's second-half goals. Striker Shinji Okazaki became the highest-scoring Japanese player in a single Bundesliga season when he scored his 14th goal to break Shinji Kagawa's previous record in Mainz's 2-0 win at home to Nuremberg. Okazaki headed his side's opening goal to break Shinja Kagawa's previous record, set for Borussia Dortmund in the 2011/12 season before he joined Manchester United."

895,22/04/2014,09:48,Football: Five potential successors to David Moyes,Manchester United were on the lookout for a new manager after David Moyes was sacked on Tuesday after failing to see out his first season in charge at Old Trafford.,"Below, AFP Sports looks at five potential contenders to replace the Scot in one of the most high-profile jobs in world football. Diego Simeone (ARG) Has impressed while guiding Atletico Madrid to the Champions League semi-finals and to the top of La Liga, challenging the dominance of Real Madrid and Barcelona at the summit of Spanish football. The former Argentina midfielder remains best known in England for being the player David Beckham kicked to be sent off during a last 16 match at the 1998 World Cup in France; a game England eventually lost. Louis van Gaal (NED) The Netherlands manager is one of the most experienced coaches in world football, having been in charge of a host of major clubs including Ajax, whom he guided to Champions League glory in 1995, Barcelona, AZ Alkmaar and Bayern Munich. Has made no secret of his desire to work in the Premier League, but his role with the Dutch side at this year's World Cup in Brazil could reduce the time he has to bring in new players to Old Trafford during the close-season transfer window. Jurgen Klopp (GER) The charismatic 46-year-old has enjoyed great success while in charge of Borussia Dortmund, guiding an effervescent, hard-working team to back-to-back German league titles in 2011 and 2012, plus last season's Champions League final. However, they are currently a distant second in the Bundesliga table behind already-crowned champions Bayern Munich. Has also been linked with the manager's position at Barcelona. Ryan Giggs (WAL) The most decorated player in English football history and United's record appearance holder, the ageless Welsh midfielder is currently on the staff at Old Trafford as a player-coach. Whether the 40-year-old has the experience and strength of character to be more than a stop-gap appointment is an open question, but he would certainly be a fans' favourite. Alex Ferguson (SCO) The former United boss, British football's most successful manager, has insisted that there is no way he would return to the hot-seat following his retirement at the end of last season.

They are are currently a distant second in the Bundesliga. There has been speculation in the Spanish media linking the German to Barcelona and newspaper Marca reported that 31.3 percent of their readers would like to see Klopp coach them. Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino is under pressure after his side failed to reach the Champions League semi-finals, lost in the Spanish Copa del Rey final to bitter rivals Real Madrid and are third in La Liga.

Bayern booked their place in next month's German Cup final with a 5-1 drubbing of second division Kaiserslautern in Wednesday's semi-final in Munich. But Munich's director of sport Matthias Sammer said while the scoreline was impressive, the performance was lacking spark. Bayern have lost back-to-back league matches, an obvious concern ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semi-final, first leg at Real Madrid. ""I had the feeling that we're not really running hot at the moment,"" said Sammer, who questioned Bayern's desire to win the Champions League and German Cup finals. ""For the tasks we are facing, that's not enough. We have to ask ourselves if we still want to win these two titles."" On paper, Bayern's trip to Braunschweig looks straightforward, but the hosts have picked up seven points in their last four games to boost their survival bid. Braunschweig are without injured captain and striker Domi Kumbela, a rich source of goals for them in recent weeks, and are just three points from safety. Bayern will be without right-back Rafinha, who is serving a three-match ban after being sent off in last Saturday's 3-0 league defeat at home to Borussia Dortmund. There is also a question mark over Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer who missed the mid-week game with a calf strain. It remains to be seen whether coach Pep Guardiola rests his squad or looks for some continuity by naming a strong team four days before the trip to Real. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund host Mainz looking to pick up their fifth straight win having booked their German Cup final berth against Bayern on May 17. Dortmund enjoyed a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg in Tuesday's semi-final but both goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller (groin) and striker Robert Lewandowski (thigh) are carrying knocks. Lewandowski scored his 100th goal for Dortmund against Wolfsburg, but his final match in the black and yellow jersey will be against future employers Bayern in the cup final. Seventh-placed Mainz 05 now find themselves in a Europa League spot due to both cup finalists Dortmund and Bayern having qualified directly for next season's Champions League. A few shock results can be expected in the last four weeks of the season with sides desperate for points in the lower half of the table set to surprise those higher up. A good example is Saturday evening's tie when relegation-threatened Hamburg host VfL Wolfsburg, who are just a point off a Champions League berth for next season. Hamburg are the only team in Germany's top-flight to have never been relegated and have just four games left to escape the bottom three. Hamburg coach Mirko Slomka is without centre-back Heiko Westermann who has a groin injury. Wolves are without defensive midfielder Junior Malanda who tore knee ligaments in Tuesday's cup defeat at Dortmund. There will be a similar points battle when Nuremberg host Bayer Leverkusen on Sunday with the visitors eager to hold off Wolves and stay fourth. Second-from-bottom Nuremberg are two points from safety, but have lost their last three games. Likewise, Leverkusen have fragile confidence with only two wins in their last 13 matches despite their fourth place and fired coach Sami Hyypia a fortnight ago.

Goals by Bastian Schweinsteiger, Toni Kroos, Thomas Mueller, Mario Mandzukic and Mario Goetze saw Bayern go through to the May 17 final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Bayern, who wrapped up this season's Bundesliga title with a record seven games to spare, will face Dortmund, who shocked Bayern 3-0 in Munich in the league last Saturday, in a repeat of last season's Champions League final. Pep Guardiola's Bayern had few problems against the 'Red Devils' of Kaiserslautern, but director of sport Matthias Sammer was unimpressed with the performance ahead of next Wednesday's Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid. ""I have the feeling that we're not really burning hot at the moment,"" complained Sammer with Bayern making no secret of their desire to win the German Cup and Champions League to repeat last year's feat of winning a treble of titles. ""For the matches we have coming up, that's not enough. ""We have to ask ourselves whether we really want these two titles."" Bayern needed just 24 minutes to take the lead when Germany midfielder Schweinsteiger headed home an Arjen Robben corner having earlier hit the crossbar. Kroos doubled the hosts' lead at the Allianz Arena on 32 minutes to make it 2-0 at the break. Robben won a penalty five minutes into the second half when he was fouled by Kaiserslautern defender Chris Loewe and Mueller fired home the spot-kick. Kaiserslautern striker Simon Zoller headed a consolation goal on the hour mark, with his side surviving on less than 30 percent possession, before Mandzukic netted the hosts' fourth to end any hopes of a fight-back. The Croatia international, who scored a hat-trick in the 5-0 quarter-final drubbing of Hamburg, converted a Goetze cross on 78 minutes. Goetze then tapped home Bayern's fifth just before the final whistle as the attacking midfielder beat Kaiserslautern's off-side trap. On Tuesday, Poland striker Robert Lewandowski hit his 100th goal for Dortmund as they beat VfL Wolfsburg 2-0 in the other semi-final. The 25-year-old has vowed to leave the club having delivered silverware this season and faces his future employers Bayern in the Berlin final. Lewandowski, who will join the Bavarian giants at the end of the season, scored a hat-trick in the 2012 Cup final when Dortmund routed Bayern 5-2. Dortmund took an early lead against the Wolves when midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan cut in from the right and unleashed a superb shot just inside the near post on 12 minutes. With half-time approaching, Belgium Under-21 international Junior Malanda hit the post for Wolfsburg and compatriot Kevin de Bruyne fired the rebound wide for the visitors. It was a costly miss as Dortmund went 2-0 up 72 seconds later when Germany star Marco Reus found Lewandowski unmarked and he slammed his shot into the top left-hand corner to reach his milestone."

However, a recurring back injury has destroyed his season. He last played in Germany's 3-3 draw with Paraguay last August shortly after his sole league appearance on the opening day of the season. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has said the eight-times capped Gundogan is not expected to play again this season and had been ruled out of June's World Cup in Brazil. Borussia announced they had extended his contract just before their German Cup semi-final at home to VfL Wolfsburg on Tuesday. ""I am very grateful that my club has given me this opportunity to continue to be part of this special team and this very special environment,"" said Gundogan. ""I will do everything to help my team-mates again soon and I am very optimistic about the coming weeks and months."" Dortmund for their part said they hoped that he would return to his best form next season. ""We are very pleased to have signed his deal against the backdrop of the injury-related special situation,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc. ""We hope that Ilkay will contribute and reach his full potential for Dortmund next season.""

""We won't approach the game with fear, but with fun and determination."" Despite Runjaic's heavy dose of realism, Bayern are vulnerable and winless in their last three league games, including defeats to Dortmund, Bavarian neighbours Augsburg and a 3-3 draw at home to Hoffenheim. Bayern could also be without Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who suffered a calf injury in Saturday's 3-0 defeat at home to Dortmund. ""If the game was yesterday, he couldn't have played. Same today, I hope he can play tomorrow,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola on Tuesday. If Neuer fails to play, the 20-year-old Lukas Raeder will deputise, having conceded a goal just three minutes into his Bundesliga debut against Borussia. The 'Red Devils' of Kaiserslautern were drubbed 4-0 by Bayern in Munich in last season's second round of the cup when the Bavarian giants fielded a weakened side. The semi-final tie also demonstrates the 'haves' and 'have nots' of German football. The four million euros ($5.5 million) Kaiserslautern will earn from the German Football Association (DFB) for making the semi-finals will help reduce the club's financial losses for the season to under a million euros.

It was Bayern's heaviest home league defeat since 2008 and the two Bundesliga giants could meet in this year's final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 17 as Pep Guardiola's Munich host second-division Kaiserslautern in Wednesday's other semi-final. ""We're not thinking about that yet, we have to beat Wolfsburg on Tuesday and we have already seen how strong they are,"" said Dortmund's Germany winger Kevin Grosskreutz. Borussia had to come from a goal down to beat Wolves 2-1 in the league at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion ten days ago in the semi-final dress rehearsal. Klopp's side have a quick turn-around before hosting Wolves, who romped to a 4-1 win at home to Nuremberg on Saturday and are just outside the top four in the league. ""But we'll be putting in another passionate performance like we did against Real and Bayern,"" promised Grosskreutz. Meanwhile Bayern boss Guardiola has demanded an immediate reaction in Wednesday's other semi-final with the Bavarian giants reeling from consecutive league defeats. Bayern face Real Madrid in the Champions League's semi-finals later this month and are bidding to repeat last year's treble of European, league and cup titles. But their shock defeat at home to Dortmund, with a full-strength side, did little to boost confidence. The Bavarian giants are winless in their last three league games since wrapping up the Bundesliga title with a record seven games to spare. ""We want to see the real Bayern Munich again. We need much better performances than against Dortmund,"" said director of sport Matthias Sammer. Giant-killers Kaiserslautern knocked Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen out of the cup in the quarter-finals and Bayern need to be on their guard against the 'Red Devils' who are pushing for promotion to Germany's top flight. Bayern's Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer missed the second-half of the Dortmund defeat with a minor calf problem, but expects to play on Wednesday. ""We simply had a bad day at the office, but I'll be fine for Wednesday. It was just a precaution,"" said Neuer.

""A few things failed to gel and as a team, we weren't as fresh and hungry as we should be and want to be. ""There have been times this season when we've been in much better shape."" In the build-up, Bayern had insisted it was a meaningless match with the title decided and just bragging rights at stake, but the heavy defeat against Guardiola's first-choice side gave cause for concern. ""We were unable to maintain our concentration at 100 percent from the start against top-class opponents,"" said Sammer. ""We weren't focused enough in the decisive phases of the game. ""We rather handed it to Dortmund on a plate. ""The players aren't robots or machines. We're champions and the league is done and dusted, so it's not the end of the world.""

The defeat allowed second-placed Dortmund to trim Bayern's lead at the top of the table to 17 points from 25 just three weeks ago. Munich's director of sport Matthias Sammer was more critical, especially as Bayern finished with ten men after defender Rafinha was sent off in the dying stages for striking Mkhitaryan in the face. ""We had problems with our rhythm and our build-up play,"" he said. ""We didn't concentrate enough... We never made the right decisions."" ""As a result you can't develop any pressure. We weren't concentrated enough at the decisive stages... but our players aren't robots and have feelings too. ""We're German champions, but we have to be careful and get back to playing well.""

Bayern were confirmed Bundesliga champions last month with a record seven games to spare and will face Real Madrid in the semi-finals of the Champions League later this month.

""The relationship was better in the past,"" Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke told German magazine Kicker. ""We got too close to Bayern in recent years and they have registered our growing popularity in Germany. ""Anyone who wants to have a good relationship with Bayern shouldn't get too close to them in terms of sporting success."" Having bowed out of the Champions League, Dortmund have prioritised next Tuesday's German Cup semi-final at home to VfL Wolfburg in the only competition they can still win. ""This is about collecting three important points which could do us a world of good,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""This is a sensational time to play Bayern Munich, between Real Madrid and Wolfsburg."" But Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said the Wolfsburg match is the priority. ""We're not going to Munich to give anything away, but if you look at the next two games, the cup semi-final for us is the higher priority"" confirmed Watzke with Borussia hoping to face Bayern in the final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 17. Dortmund's Poland striker Robert Lewandowski will be making his final appearance with the away team at the Allianz Arena before he joins Bayern at the end of the season. Likewise, Bayern's Germany star Mario Goetze will be facing his former club having switched to Munich from Dortmund last July. Guardiola is expected to rotate his squad, but both Javi Martinez and Bastian Schweinsteiger could start having sat out Wednesday's Champions League victory over Manchester United with suspension. Having fielded a third-choice defensive midfield pairing of Oliver Kirch and Milos Jojic against Real, Klopp is set to extend the experiment on the back of an impressive display from the duo. There are two key matches in the battle to avoid relegation with bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig at Freiburg, who are just two places from the relegation zone. Likewise, Hanover 96, who are two points from the bottom three, entertain 16th-placed Hamburg, who are battling to avoid an historic first relegation from the Bundesliga."

""We do not comment on individuals, but it is true that we plan to sign two strikers,"" said Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. The 21-year-old Swiss international has attracted interest with ten goals since January, including five in his last five league games. Kicker claim second-from-bottom Nuremberg would receive five million euros (US$6.9m) for Drmic if they are relegated, but the transfer figure would be doubled if they stay up. Premier League side Arsenal have also been linked to the striker of Croatian origin."
921,10/04/2014,16:27,Football: Bayern dismissive of Dortmund league clash,European champions Bayern Munich have dismissed Saturday's Bundesliga showdown against arch rivals Borussia Dortmund as no more than a clash for bragging rights between Germany's top sides.,"Bayern were confirmed German league champions a fortnight ago with a record seven games to spare and are 20 points clear of second-placed Dortmund in the table ahead of the the Allianz Arena clash. ""The game has some statistical value, but nothing more,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said of 'Der Klassiker' against Dortmund, while director of sport Matthias Sammer was damning in his appraisal. ""I have never seen it written on a list of achievements: 'prestige won', so it's not a decisive game for us,"" said Sammer with Bayern through to the Champions League's semi-finals after their 4-2 aggregate win over Manchester United in the last eight. Nevertheless, Bayern's bosses will be extremely irritated to lose to Dortmund, especially after last Saturday's shock 1-0 defeat at Augsburg and the 3-3 draw at home to Hoffenheim in the league. Ever the diplomat, Bayern coach Pep Guardiola talked up Dortmund, especially following Borussia's 2-0 win over Real Madrid on Tuesday as they bowed out of the Champions League after losing their quarter-final 3-2 on aggregate. ""We know how good Dortmund are, it's important for both teams to show how good they are,"" said Guardiola. ""I watched the Dortmund match against Real Madrid game and they were amazing. ""We'll need to be well prepared to face them on Saturday."" Likewise, Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp says he is relishing taking on the European champions in their own backyard, especially fresh from beating Real. ""It is a sensational time to play in Munich, between Real Madrid and VfL Wolfsburg,"" said Klopp, whose side play Wolfsburg in the German Cup semi-finals next week. ""It's all about three points which would do us the world of good."""

They have reached 10 European Cup or Champions League finals and won the title five times. -- The German champions are now unbeaten in five home games against Manchester United. They have won three and drawn two. -- Bayern goalscorer Mario Mandzukic became the first Croat to score in a Champions League final when Bayern beat Borussia Dortmund last year. The 27-year-old is said to be wanted by Chelsea and Arsenal for next season. Thomas Mueller, who hit the second, won the Golden Boot for the top scorer at the 2010 World Cup finals. -- The German side have now drawn the first leg 1-1 in European competition 12 times and won each time. They had 65% of the possession against Manchester United, but that is down from their Champions League season average of more than 70%. -- Bayern coach Pepe Guardiola did not lose in nine home games against English clubs when player and coach at Barcelona."

""Adrian Ramos is an excellent player and one of the best goal-scorers in Germany. He corresponds perfectly to Borussia Dortmund's demands,"" said Michael Zorc, the club's sporting director. The signing of Ramos will go some way towards making up for the departure of prolific Polish striker Lewandowski to Bayern. Ramos has this season scored 16 goals for Hertha, one less than Lewandowski, who is currently top scorer in the Bundesliga alongside Bayern's Mario Mandzukic. ""I wanted to cross this new step in my career and play in the Champions League,"" Ramos said, adding that he would ""do everything to help Hertha until the end of the season"". With five games remaining, Borussia are currently in second place in the Bundesliga and almost certain to play in next season's Champions League. Hertha lie in 10th and are virtually guaranteed to remain in Germany's top division after promotion last season."

Dortmund face an uphill task at their Westfalenstadion even with Poland striker Robert Lewandowski back in their side after missing the first leg with injury. Last season's finalists geared up for Madrid with a 2-1 come-back win at home to VfL Wolfsburg with goals by Lewandowski and Germany winger Marco Reus after a poor first-half display. Having already lost four of their nine games in Europe this season, Dortmund are looking to bow out with their heads held high, while Real will want to avenge last year's 4-1 semi-final defeat at Dortmund when Lewandowski scored all four.

World player of the year Cristiano Ronaldo is set to start after he was forced off with a slight knee problem towards the end of the first leg, having scored Real's third goal, and was rested for Saturday's 4-0 win away to Real Sociedad. The 29-year-old Portugal star trained with the Madrid squad on Sunday and looks set to travel to northern Germany. Real boss Carlo Ancelotti was delighted with how his side coped without Ronaldo as goals from Asier Illarramendi, Gareth Bale, Pepe and Alvaro Morata sealed a convincing victory at Sociedad. Madrid's Italian manager was particularly pleased not to have picked up any more injuries. ""This victory reinforces the team and, moreover, we avoided injuries and showed a good level physically,"" he said. Angel di Maria is also expected to start at Dortmund after only appearing as a substitute against Sociedad. The Argentine also missed the first leg due to gastroenteritis and Fabio Coentrao will return at left-back after being rested at the weekend. To progress, Dortmund must better their stunning 4-1 semi-final, first leg win at home to Real nearly 12 months ago when Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, who joins Bayern Munich next season, scored all four goals. A similar result would see the Germans bow out on away goals and they picked up a confidence boost with a 2-1 comeback win over Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga on Saturday. Lewandowski, who was suspended for the first leg, scored Dortmund's opening goal on Saturday and will be an obvious concern to the Real back four. Germany winger Marco Reus, who scored their 77th-minute winner against Wolves, said his side need to repeat Saturday's impressive second-half display after a poor opening 45 minutes. ""We have not given up (against Real),"" said Reus. ""If we play like we did (against Wolfsburg) in the first half, then it will be very difficult. ""If we play as well as we did in the second, we honestly have a chance. It will be damn hard, but we'll give it everything."" Dortmund will be without suspended defensive midfielder Sebastian Kehl, which leaves coach Jurgen Klopp without an obvious replacement with both Sven Bender and Ilkay Gundogan injured. Right-back Kevin Grosskreutz is set to prove his versatility once more with Klopp hinting he might switch the Germany international into the midfield. Dortmund are also set to welcome back goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who will take over the captain's armband from Kehl, after the 33-year-old missed the Wolves win after injuring his arm in the defeat at Madrid. ""We will not give anything away on Tuesday,"" insisted Klopp, who has endured a horror run of injuries this season with both winger Jakub Blaszczykowski and Neven Subotic out with long-term knee problems.

Hanover were reduced to ten men when midfielder Andre Hoffmann was sent off on 62 minutes for a dangerous foul before Jan Hochscheidt scored the hosts' third just before the final whistle. ""That was an important three points and for our fans it's also an important emotional win,"" said Braunschweig's relieved coach Torsten Lieberknecht whose side face champions Bayern Munich in a fortnight. The result leaves Braunschweig unbeaten in their last three games and just two points from safety, while Hanover are two points from the relegation mire after four straight defeats. Later, mid-table Hoffenheim held Hertha Berlin to a 1-1 draw in the capital as Sami Allagui's early goal was cancelled out by Poland international's Eugen Polanski equaliser with half an hour gone. Hoffenheim's Germany hopeful Kevin Volland was only denied the winning goal on the final whistle when his free-kick was palmed over the bar by Hertha goalkeeper Thomas Kraft. On Saturday, champions Bayern Munich suffered their first league defeat since October 2012 as their record 53-match unbeaten run was ended by a 1-0 defeat at Augsburg. Coach Pep Guardiola paid the price for naming a weakened team for the Bavarian derby with one eye on Wednesday's Champions League return leg at home to Manchester United. The Spaniard made seven changes from the side which drew 1-1 at Manchester United last Tuesday in the quarter-final first leg. Guardiola started with three teenagers in Augsburg, giving Bundesliga debuts to reserve team wing-backs Ylli Sallahi and Mitchell Weiser while Pierre-Emile Hoejbjerg was named on the left wing. The gamble backfired when Weiser lost possession to Augsburg's Daniel Baier who fed Sascha Moelders and the  striker blasted his shot past Bayern's goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with 31 minutes gone to claim the winning goal.

Hanover were reduced to ten men when midfielder Andre Hoffmann was sent off on 62 minutes for a dangerous foul before Jan Hochscheidt scored the hosts' third just before the final whistle. The result leaves Braunschweig unbeaten in their last three games and just two points from safety, while Hanover are two points from the relegation mire after four straight defeats.

Poland star Robert Lewandowski, who was suspended for the Madrid leg, will be back in the Dortmund team for the return at Borussia's Westfalenstadion. The Polish hot-shot, who scored four goals against Real in last season's Champions League semi-final, got on the board in Saturday's 2-1 come-back league win at home to VfL Wolfsburg. Dortmund found themselves 1-0 down at home to Wolves after Croatia striker Ivica Olic put the guests ahead and punished Borussia's poor first-half display -- one the hosts dare not repeat against Real. ""We have not given up by any stretch of the imagination (against Real),"" said Reus, who scored the 77th-minute winner against Wolves. ""If we play like we did in the first-half (against Wolfsburg), it will be very difficult, but if we play like we did in the second-half, we have a chance in all honesty. ""Either way, it's going to be damned difficult, but we will give it everything."" Last season's finalists Dortmund took a big step towards securing direct qualification for next season's Champions League campaign with three points which kept them second in the table. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp produced a spectacular leap of celebration after Reus' winning goal and admitted the victory was a relief, especially as Real's visit preceeds a Bundesliga trip away to Bayern Munich. ""Anyone who saw us celebrate after the game will know what a great relief the victory was,"" said Klopp. ""We needed the win to put some distance between us and the boisterous pack chasing us. ""We will not give anything away on Tuesday. ""We want to play two 45 minutes like we did in the second-half against Wolfsburg and then we'll see how things stand."""

With the title already confirmed, Bayern were held to a 3-3 league draw at home to Hoffenheim last Saturday, then 1-1 at Old Trafford against Manchester United in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday. ""After winning the title in Berlin, things were a bit complicated, but I get the impression that we're back now and we will be at full throttle again,"" said Dante.

Isco doubled Real's lead after 27 minutes as his low shot from the edge of the area curled into the bottom corner. Ronaldo then scored his 14th Champions League goal of the campaign to match the competition's record mark for goals in a season set by Lionel Messi two years ago. However, Real's night was soured somewhat as Ronaldo had to be substituted late on due to what appeared to be a minor knee injury. ""It's a magnificent result,"" Isco told Canal Plus. ""We are very happy to get the third goal and not concede. It is a huge step towards the semi-finals."" However, the Spanish under-21 international warned Los Blancos will have the memory of their 4-1 defeat in Dortmund in the first-leg of last season's semi-final to remind them the tie isn't over. ""No one imagined Madrid would lose 4-1 over there. In football you never know."" The visitors started the game with just four of the side that also started that famous 4-1 win, but Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp refused to blame the absences suffered by his side as the reason for such a turnaround in less than 12 months. ""Yes it is a difference, but the goals we conceded tonight have nothing to do with that. ""We were not compact enough. The first goal was too easy, we made things too easy for them. ""In the second-half we had so many chances and we didn't take one of them, but I know this team can do so much better and that is what we have to think about."" Madrid got off to a flying start as Bale opened the scoring with his 17th goal of the season as he controlled Carvajal's low centre before finishing first time. Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller then had to make two brilliant saves from a free-kick each from Ronaldo and Bale. However, there was nothing the German international could do to prevent Isco's precise low effort finding its way into his bottom right-hand corner. Dortmund posed a far greater threat on the Real goal after the break, but that also left them open on the counter-attack and Bale nearly scored again within three minutes of the restart as Weidenfeller blocked the Welshman's effort. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had been handed the difficult task of replacing the suspended Robert Lewandowski up front for Dortmund, but he came close to bringing his side back into the game with a shot across goal that flew just wide of the target. Henrikh Mkhitaryan then wasted another good opening for the visitors as his shot was deflected wide by Pepe and within two minutes Dortmund were punished as Ronaldo made it 3-0. The Portuguese was played in by Luka Modric and showed quick feet to sidestep Weidenfeller and roll the ball into an empty net. Dortmund continued to push for an away goal and only an incredible block by Pepe prevented Mkhitaryan after Iker Casillas could only parry a low cross from the right. Weidenfeller was then forced into more heroics to keep the score down as he tipped over Benzema's sweetly-struck half-volley from the edge of the area. Ronaldo had to be replaced by Brazilian midfielder Casemiro 10 minutes from time, but the former Manchester United man was able to walk freely as he made his exit, suggesting he should be fit for Real's trip to Real Sociedad on Saturday."

Robert Lewandowski, who scored all four of his side's goals in that tie, is also suspended for the first leg at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday and Klopp thinks the addition of Gareth Bale to Madrid's arsenal makes Dortmund's task even more difficult this time round. ""Real Madrid have become a more flexible team this year. In my opinion they are better,"" he said at a press conference on Tuesday. ""Luka Modric is in top form and the connection between Bale and (Angel) di Maria is incredible in terms of rhythm and speed. For that alone Madrid are better than last year."" Lewandowski's absence could mean a start for Pierre-Emerick Aubemayang in an unfamiliar role up front and Klopp is hoping to take advantage of the Gabonese's pace on the counter-attack. ""We know we have lost Lewandowski and that is a shame for us. To play without a number nine is not so dramatic. Tomorrow we will not dominate the ball, but we can be decisive in one-on-one situations. ""We have gained pace in the team from last year and if they leave us spaces we can inflict damage. ""We are used to not being favourites. If we lose it will not be a catastrophe. Few teams can say they have done what we have in these last 10 years."" On top of Lewandowski, the visitors will also be without the injured Neven Subotic, Jakub Blaszczykowski, Marcel Schmelzer, Ilkay Gundogan and Sven Bender."

That was semi-final revenge for the Germans after Real had dumped them out at the same stage 2-0 on aggregate in the 1997/98 season on their way to winning the trophy for the seventh time.

The three points kept Borussia second in the Bundesliga behind newly-crowned champions Bayern Munich.

Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, the first player to score four goals in a Champions League semi-final in Dortmund's 4-1 rout of Real last season, is suspended for the Madrid match, but Reus says his side must take heart from their fight-back. ""Regardless even of the Real match, it was important to get some self-confidence in the bank. We now know that we can come back, even if we're two goals down,"" said the 24-year-old Reus. ""We've proven to our critics that we can win before Champions League games. ""We were asleep for the first few minutes and the 2-0 was a wake-up call."" Dortmund have lost four times in the Bundesliga on the eve of Champions League matches this season and have lost three of their eight Champions League games en route to the quarter-finals. Reus is an option to replace Lewandowski up front in Madrid and Dortmund are already without Germany left-back Marcel Schmelzer, who has a torn groin, and defensive midfielder Sven Bender, who has a pelvis problem. Germany's Ilkay Gundogan has not played since August with a back injury and virus while both centre-back Neven Subotic and winger Jakub Blaszczykowski are out long-term with knee injuries."

Bayern partied in the German capital until the early hours of Wednesday morning, but preparations for Saturday's league match at home to Hoffenheim and Tuesday's Champions League clash at Manchester United will start promptly on Thursday. Bayern became Germany's first team to win the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup titles last season under Guardiola's predecessor Jupp Heynckes and the Spaniard is eager to repeat the feat. ""What Jupp Heynckes did last year is unique in history and is very difficult to do, but we will try it, of course,"" said the 43-year-old Guardiola who won 14 of 19 titles in four seasons as Barcelona coach. The Spaniard has already claimed three of a possible five titles this season with the Bundesliga, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup secured, but the German Cup and Champions League titles still up for grabs. Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer had a more blunt appraisal with the goal being to win the Champions League final in Lisbon on May 24, the week after the German Cup final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 17. ""We aim to collect as many titles as possible,"" said Neuer, as Bayern host second-division Kaiserslautern in the German Cup semi-final on April 16. ""The important thing now is that we're successful in the other games this season, we want to go to Lisbon and come back to Berlin."" After Bayern broke or equalled 25 Bundesliga records last season, Guardiola has already claimed some of his own with more sure to follow before Bayern are officially handed the title on May 10. His side claimed three records on Tuesday as they secured their 19th consecutive league win, extended their unbeaten Bundesliga run to 52 matches and claimed the title with seven matches left. There will be no resting on laurels for the rest of the season even as captain Philipp Lahm posted a Bundesliga record of 134 completed passes during the Hertha game with an impressive 100 percent accuracy. ""We can always improve. In every game,"" said Guardiola. ""We must try and keep a high level over a longer period of time."" Guardiola's first domestic title at Bayern earned him praise from Germany head coach Joachim Loew, FIFA president Sepp Blatter and even Borussia Dortmund rival Jurgen Klopp, whose team lags 25 points behind in the table. ""To see you, we'd need a telescope as you're so far ahead,"" quipped Klopp."

But he sits out next week's Madrid clash having picked up his third yellow card of the tournament in Dortmund's 2-1 last 16 defeat at home to Zenit Saint Petersburg last week as they went through 5-4 on aggregate. Lewandowski was shown a yellow for a handball from a corner and admits the booking still bothers him, but is relishing facing Real in the return leg on April 8. ""I have driven myself crazy over the annoying yellow card and hope that we leave Madrid with a good result,"" said the 25-year-old. ""Then I'd be even more motivated for the return leg - I have had a good experience against Real. ""I believe that we can still go through, even if Real are the favourites and are in top form."" Lewandowski's Dortmund contract expires in June and he has signed a five-year contract with Bayern Munich from next season. The Poland star says he wants to sign off at Dortmund with a title, preferably in a final against his future employers. Having been confirmed as German champions for the 24th time on Tuesday, Bayern are on course to again win the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup titles. Both Bayern and Dortmund are still in the quarter-finals of the Champions League and are on a collision course to meet in the German Cup final on May 17. ""We can once more annoy Bayern,"" said Lewandowski, who scored a hat-trick when Dortmund trounced Bayern 5-2 in the 2012 German Cup final."

""Since the clubs have waived this resource, until further notice, this topic is finished as far as we're concerned,"" German Football League (DFL) president Reinhard Rauball said in a Frankfurt press conference. Goal-line technology has gained some support here especially after Bayer Leverkusen won 2-1 at Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga last October with a now infamous ""phantom goal"". Leverkusen's Stefan Kiessling winning header went into the goal via a hole in the side netting, but referee Felix Brych allowed it to stand. The English Premier League brought in ""Hawk-Eye"" technology at the start of the season and ""Goal Control"" will be used by FIFA referees at this June's World Cup in Brazil.

Around 3,000 police officers are expected to be on duty on Tuesday in one of the biggest police operations for a German football match. Police say they expect around 500 violent fans from both teams while 90 individuals have already been banned. The DFB will be paying close attention having fined Borussia 60,000 euros (US$82,764) and threatened sanctions on Friday after Dortmund fans were involved in incidents at three separate league matches. Rioting broke out at last October's Ruhr derby in Gelsenkirchen at Schalke's Veltins Arena when a group of Dortmund fans stormed into an area of the ground for home fans. The DFB have told Dortmund they will have to play one league game with their famous South Stand empty if there is any more trouble from their fans in the next seven months. Sami Hyypia's fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen are at Augsburg on Wednesday looking for their first win since the start of February having lost eight of their last nine games. The Werkself crashed to a last-minute 3-2 defeat at home to Hoffenheim on Sunday and are in danger of dropping out of the Champions League places if their slump continues.

The hosts made a bright start when centre-back Andre Hoffmann clattered the post, leaving Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp shaking his head on the sidelines. But Dortmund took control when centre-back Mats Hummels fired home just before the break then Poland striker Robert Lewandowski netted a spectacular second-half goal. There was nothing on when the 26-year-old, who joins Bayern next season, took the ball on the left wing, raced down the flank, cut inside and drilled his shot home despite the attention of five defenders. There was more good news for Klopp late on as Marco Reus celebrated his comeback from injury by scoring their third in added time having come off the bench. ""It was important that we stayed calm throughout the game,"" said Klopp. ""Things went well for after us when we went 2-0 up, but I could really breathe easily after our third goal. It was a highly-professional performance."" Schalke 04 bounced back from Tuesday's Champions League exit at Real Madrid with a 3-1 win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Teenage midfielder Leon Goretzka gave Schalke the lead when he fired home a long-range shot on 17 minutes. Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar claimed his 10th goal of the season when he fired home a direct free-kick 20 minutes from time to claim his sixth goal in his last three league games. Huntelaar's replacement Adam Szalai netted the Royal Blues third just before the final whistle after Benjamin Kessel scored Eintracht's consolation.

971,22/03/2014,02:10,Football: How the Champions League last eight shape up,"UEFA's four top-ranked teams -- Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Chelsea -- are on a Champions League collision course after being kept apart in the quarter-final draw.","While Barcelona face an all-Spanish tie against La Liga title rivals Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid will attempt to avenge their 4-3 aggregate loss to Borussia Dortmund in last season's semi-finals. Holders Bayern, 2-1 victors against Dortmund in last year's final, will play stuttering Manchester United, with Chelsea's tie against dark horses Paris Saint-Germain completing the last eight line-up. Here, AFP Sports looks at the tactical factors that will help to decide which teams make it through to the semi-finals: Barcelona (ESP) v Atletico Madrid (ESP) - Barcelona remain the masters of 'tiki-taka', but they have lost their crown as the competition's ball retention kings to Bayern Munich, who have averaged 65 percent of possession to the Catalans' 62 percent. Last year's arrival of jet-heeled Brazil star Neymar has encouraged coach Tata Martino to adopt more of a counter-attacking style, but Barca's game is nonetheless still based on patient ball circulation, orchestrated by peerless Spain midfielders Xavi and Andres Iniesta. Under former player Diego Simeone, Atletico have adopted a high-intensity pressing game that has made them the most defensively robust side in La Liga. Los Colchoneros also pose a major threat from set pieces (a Barcelona weakness), having scored more goals from dead-ball situations (eight) than any other team left in the tournament. Manchester United (ENG) v Bayern Munich (GER) - United manager David Moyes was accused of regressing the club to a tactical Dark Age after they lumped 81 crosses into the box during a 2-2 draw with the Premier League's bottom club Fulham last month. They looked more like the United of old in the second leg of their last 16 tie against Olympiakos, but Robin van Persie, who scored all of his side's three goals in that game, will miss both legs of the Bayern tie with a sprained knee. Since arriving at Bayern, Pep Guardiola has instituted an uncompromising passing game reminiscent of the style he patented at Barcelona. The Bavarians passed Arsenal to death in the last 16, enjoying a staggering 73 percent of possession during their 2-0 first-leg victory. Having utilised a 4-1-4-1 system that saw full-back Philipp Lahm redeployed as a holding midfielder, Bayern have reverted to a 4-2-3-1 shape since Bastian Schweinsteiger returned from an ankle injury in February. Real Madrid (ESP) v Borussia Dortmund (GER) - The redoubtable pace of Cristiano Ronaldo and record-breaking signing Gareth Bale means that Real Madrid remain a formidable counter-attacking side, but coach Carlo Ancelotti's decision to switch to a 4-3-3 formation has given them better control of the ball in the middle of the pitch. Madrid are also the competition's top scorers with 29 goals -- an impressive 25 of which have come from open play. Dortmund have gone off the boil domestically since last season, bedevilled by injuries and left for dead in the Bundesliga by Bayern, but Jurgen Klopp's team remain one of the most hard-working in Europe. They have made more tackles (24.6) and interceptions (19) per game than any other side still in the competition, according to the Who Scored website, and conceded fewer shots on goal (nine per game) than anyone apart from Barcelona and Bayern. Paris Saint-Germain (FRA) v Chelsea (ENG) - Since succeeding Carlo Ancelotti as PSG coach, Laurent Blanc has added a dash of flair to the French giants' domestic dominance, devising a 4-3-3 system in which Zlatan Ibrahimovic leads the line and record signing Edinson Cavani patrols the right flank. In midfield, Thiago Motta, Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi respectively supply poise, artistry and lung-bursting energy, while Brazil captain Thiago Silva imperiously marshals the defence. After returning to Chelsea from Real Madrid, manager Jose Mourinho was quick to fall back upon the counter-attacking style with which he has forged his reputation. No Chelsea player has scored more than three goals in the competition, but in Eden Hazard, Willian, Oscar and Andre Schurrle, Mourinho possesses some of the swiftest attacking midfielders on the continent."
972,21/03/2014,02:36,Football: March madness as Bayern on verge of record triumph,Bayern Munich could be crowned German league champions in record time on Saturday if they win at Mainz 05.,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern hold an enormous 23-point lead and victory would given them the title providing rivals Borussia Dortmund fail to win at Hanover and Schalke do not beat bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig at home. Should Bayern wrap up a 24th German league title at Mainz, they will do so with eight games to spare, breaking their own record of six, set last season. No side has ever been crowned German champions in March and Bayern are bidding to become the first team to go through an entire Bundesliga campaign unbeaten. Mainz, who are on their own five-match unbeaten run, have risen to fifth in the table and are challenging for a Champions League place next season. But the Rhineland club are all too aware of the enormous task facing them against the European champions. ""Perhaps the club who finally break Bayern Munich's unbeaten run should be given an extra cup to mark the achievement. That's what we're trying to win on Saturday,"" said Mainz manager Christian Heidel. Bayern will be at near full strength, while Mainz are waiting on the fitness of Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting who has had a stomach infection. ""We need to be brave and believe in a sensational win against Bayern Munich,"" said Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel. Should Bayern claim the title, any celebrations will be muted with the Bavarian giants in the quarter-finals of the Champions League and determined to defend their title. ""(Any party) wouldn't last long, we still have too many games ahead of us,"" said Bayern's Dutch winger Arjen Robben. ""We have a game every two or three days coming up and the focus is on the Champions League."" Even if Bayern's bid is foiled this weekend, they can still claim the title at Hertha Berlin on Tuesday. ""We will be champions, but exactly when is secondary,"" said Bayern's attacking midfielder Toni Kroos. Dortmund travel to Hanover 96 on Saturday without Germany left-back Marcel Schmelzer, who has a torn muscle in his pelvis, to add to their latest injury woes. The 26-year-old suffered the injury in the later stages of Dortmund's 2-1 defeat at home to Zenit St Petersburg on Wednesday in the last 16 of the Champions League. Dortmund still reached the quarter-finals with a 5-4 win on aggregate having won the first-leg in Russia 4-2 three weeks ago. Schmelzer's misfortune is the latest in a string of ailments to befall Dortmund, who are already without long-term knee injury-victims centre-back Neven Subotic and winger Jakub Blaszczykowski.

Venezuela striker Jose Rondon, who joined Zenit in January from Russian rivals Rubin Kazan, came off the bench to head home the second-half winner. The defeat had repercussions for Klopp as left-back Schmelzer limped out with a suspected hip injury 15 minutes before the final whistle. Star striker Lewandowski was booked on 19 minutes for a handball, his third yellow of the tournament, and is suspended for the first quarter-final leg. ""I have to be careful in regards to what I say about referees, but I wouldn't have given it,"" said Klopp when asked about Lewandowski's booking. ""There are worse things in life. What worries me more is the injury to Marcel Schmelzer. ""He is in a lot of pain in the hip area, we don't know yet exactly what the injury is, but it happened in a collision with Hulk and it really doesn't look good."" Schmelzer's injury could be a further blow to Dortmund who already have centre-back Neven Subotic and winger Jakub Blaszczykowski out with long terms knee injuries while Germany defender Mats Hummels has only just returned from an ankle injury. Despite a below-par performance, Klopp was happy to see Dortmund in the quarter-finals for the second year running. ""I am totally happy that we are through, we had respect for Zenit for their physically-strong and talented side,"" said Klopp, who will discover his team's quarter-final opponents on Friday. ""Anyone who works in football knows that Zenit aren't push-overs and the creme de la creme of European football now awaits us in the quarter-finals."" Wednesday's result was Dortmund's third Champions League defeat of the season after losing at Napoli and also at home to Arsenal in the group stages. Dortmund's fans voiced their discontent after the final whistle but Kehl was equally unimpressed with their response.

We are very happy going through, as we've had a lot of injuries this season. ""We never complained about it, but it does cost a lot of energy. Despite all this, we deserve to be among the best eight teams in Europe."" Zenit will unveil ex-Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur boss Andre Villas-Boas as their new manager on Thursday. The Russians must have impressed their new manager, having produced a spirited display and taken the game to Dortmund, nearly achieving the three goals they needed in Germany to progress.

Dortmund crashed to a shock 2-1 defeat at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday and Lewandowski has warned his side they can ill afford a similar performance against Zenit at Borussia's Westfalenstadion. ""We are not through yet, nothing has been decided and if we play like we did against Gladbach then we must be careful,"" said Lewandowski, Dortmund's top-scorer in Europe with 18 Champions League goals, but who will join rivals Bayern Munich at the end of the season. The Poland hot-shot already has six goals this season and became the first player to score four times in a Champions League semi-final last April against Real Madrid. Dortmund will be without Germany winger Marco Reus, who scored in the first-leg and missed training on Tuesday as he struggles to get over a leg injury. Borussia welcome back playmaker Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who missed the Moenchengladbach defeat with suspension, while Germany centre-back Mats Hummels is looking for a run of form having struggled with injury this season. A pinched nerve, back injury, ankle problem and a foot injury have seen the 25-year-old miss a total of three months this season. Dortmund have won only four of their 11 games without him, conceding 16 goals in the process, but have lost only three times with him in the team. ""If Mats plays then it has a positive effect on the rest of the team,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc. With a pass completion rate of 83 percent and 70 passes per game, Hummels brings some security to Dortmund's back-four which has been repeatedly hit by injuries this season with his centre-back Neven Subotic missing since November with a knee injury. ""There is no professional footballer, who has managed to play 15 years at a high level without injury,"" said Hummels. ""Injuries are part and parcel of it. ""During the time you learn to deal with it better. ""The good thing is that at least you get back you motivation and desire, which are at 100 percent."""

Reus was a key factor in Dortmund's 4-2 first-leg win as the 24-year-old scored early on as Borussia raced into a 2-0 lead after only five minutes, but he has struggled with a leg injury since. Zenit, who will unveil ex-Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur coach Andre Villas-Boas as their new coach on Thursday after Luciano Spalletti's dismissal, need a minor miracle to progress to the quarter-finals. But Dortmund are taking nothing for granted. ""We have created a good basis for the return leg, no more and no less,"" said Klopp. ""We will not risk a lot, but just going out there to defend our lead would be a bit stupid as well. ""We have reached our goals in the Champions League by getting out of the group stage. ""Everything that happens now is a benefit for the club, but there would not be a gaping hole in our budget should we go out."" With the likes of Brazil's Hulk in their ranks, Zenit will pose Dortmund problems at Borussia's Westfalenstadion even if they are winless in their three competitive matches this year. ""There is no way we will underestimate them,"" said Germany defender Mats Hummels. ""Most of the group winners did well in the away game and had more problems in the home game. ""Zenit have enormous quality, especially in midfield and in attack. ""We have to be vigilant, but the first-leg result puts us in a good position."" Former Paris Saint-Germain midfielder and ex-Russia captain Sergei Semak will be on the touchline in Dortmund as Zenit's interim coach after Spalletti's dismissal. ""Everything is possible in football, but of course we do not have much of a chance,"" he said. ""We are up against one of the best sides in Europe, even in the world. ""The result is only interesting to me if it is good enough for a win. ""It is important for us to present our best and to stick together. ""Only then will we have a chance to turn this around."""

Former Paris Saint-Germain midfielder and ex-Russia captain Sergei Semak will be on the touchline in Dortmund as Zenit's interim coach. ""We want to peform with dignity in the return match with Borussia. Of course our chances are slim, but miracles sometimes happen,"" Semak said ahead of the game. Both teams come into the Westfalenstadion clash on the back of defeats. Zenit went down 1-0 at the hands of reigning champions CSKA Moscow on Saturday and it was the second consecutive Russian Premier League match in which they have failed to score. Meanwhile, Dortmund suffered a 2-1 loss at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach in the Bundesliga. Coach Jurgen Klopp was sent from the dugout for arguing with the fourth official, a misdemeanour for which he was later fined 10,000 euros ($13,926) by the German Football Association. Only two teams have ever won a Champions League knockout tie after losing the first leg at home, but Zenit are at least near full-strength for the game. Dortmund, meanwhile, are set to welcome back playmaker Henrikh Mkhitaryan from suspension, but Germany winger Marco Reus is still doubtful with injury. However, Germany midfielder Sven Bender is not expected back until late next month due to a groin injury, while Ilkay Gündogan has been sidelined since mid-August due to compression of the spine. Centre-back Neven Subotic is expected to miss the rest of the season after tearing knee ligaments and Poland winger Jakub Blaszczykowski will not play again this term after sustaining a knee injury in late January. ""Now we need to forget about the (Moenchengladbach) defeat quickly and focus on Zenit,"" said Dortmund's Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, who has six goals in seven Champions League games this season, including a brace in the first leg. Despite their healthy advantage, full-back Marcel Schmelzer insists that Dortmund are taking nothing for granted. ""On Wednesday, the next tough match awaits us. We don't believe that we are already in the quarter-finals,"" he said. ""St Petersburg will demand a lot of us all."" If Zenit are to reach the last eight of Europe's premier club competition for the first time, they must inflict a rare European home defeat on Klopp's side. Dortmund have won eight of their last nine Champions League home matches, with the exception being a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal in the group stage in November."

The Dortmund coach was left furious after Aytekin had earlier failed to award a penalty following a suspected handball from 'Gladbach's Filip Daems when the home side were 2-0 down. ""The fact Jurgen Klopp is a repeat offender could have affected the sports court's judgement,"" said Anton Nachreiner, chairman of the DFB's disciplinary committee.

Klopp insists he did nothing wrong, although he has said he will not appeal the fine. ""The fourth official had me sent to the stands,"" said Klopp. ""I know what I said: there was a situation where I turned around to him and said, 'you didn't blow (the whistle) there'. ""It was nothing more. ""I have often, quite rightly, been punished in the past, but it was nothing on this occasion."" Klopp's previous offences include being sent to the stands during Dortmund's 2-1 Champions League defeat at Napoli last September, for which he was given a two-match ban by European football's governing body UEFA.

With Hamburg desperate to avoid their first relegation from Germany's top flight, Mirko Slomka replaced Bert van Marwijk as coach a month ago and saw his side climb to 14th. ""We've overtaken two teams now, which means nothing other than we now have something to defend -- namely, not being in the relegation places,"" said Slomka. Nuremberg drop to 15th while VfB Stuttgart, who drew 1-1 at Werder Bremen on Saturday under new coach Huub Stevens, find themselves second from bottom. Freiburg moved up to 16th, but stay in the relegation places, with a 4-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday as five points now separate the bottom five teams. At the top of the table, leaders Bayern Munich can be crowned champions next Saturday -- with a record eight games to spare -- as their 2-1 win at home to Bayer Leverkusen left them 23 points clear. The European champions will be confirmed as German champions for the 24th time if they win at Mainz next Saturday and rivals Dortmund and Schalke both draw. Goals by Mario Mandzukic and Bastian Schweinsteiger saw Bayern enjoy their 17th straight league win and extend their record unbeaten Bundesliga run to 50 matches.

The win keeps Thomas Tuchel's Mainz in the hunt for a European spot next season and are only three points short of a Champions League berth. Wolfsburg drop to sixth after their 1-1 draw at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig as only three points separate the bottom four clubs including Freiburg, Hamburg and Stuttgart.

""That is a bitter result for us, so the disappointment is huge,"" said Dortmund captain Sebastian Kehl. Dortmund are now just one point clear of third-placed rivals Schalke ahead of the Ruhr Valley derby on March 25. ""We could have a cushion behind us, now things are tight,"" admitted Dortmund midfielder Nuri Sahin. Swiss coach Lucien Favre extended his Gladbach contract last week until 2017 and his side produced a devastating first-half spell with two goals in nine first-half minutes at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. Brazilian striker Raffael wrong-footed Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller on 31 minutes, then Max Kruse fired home five minutes before the break. Gladbach midfielder Havard Nordtveit was sent off for a second yellow card for the final 20 minutes and new-signing Milos Jojic pulled one back for Dortmund on 77 minutes. Mainz moved up to fifth with a sensational 4-2 victory at Hoffenheim with Japan's Shinji Okazaki netting their last two goals as the guests scored three times in seven stunning second-half minutes to come from 2-0 down. The win keeps Thomas Tuchel's Mainz in the hunt for a European spot next season and are only three points short of a Champions League berth. Relegation-threatened VfB Stuttgart, with new coach Huub Stevens in charge, are winless in their last 10 matches as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Werder Bremen. Wolfsburg drop to sixth after their 1-1 draw at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig as only three points separate the bottom four clubs including Freiburg, Hamburg and Stuttgart. Hertha's European aspirations suffered a dent as they lost 2-0 at home to Hanover 96 to stay ninth and four points off the top six."

""Don't worry, you'll still finish second in the league,"" Favre told Klopp after the final whistle. Gladbach took the lead when a scuffed shot from Brazilian striker Raffael wrong-footed Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller on 31 minutes after Patrick Herrmann got the better of Borussia defender Mats Hummels to fire in a cross.

But the club is in turmoil after Hoeness resigned as both president and chairman of the advisory board on Friday after being sentenced to three and a half years in jail on Thursday, The 62-year-old, who won the 1974 World Cup with West Germany, cheated the German state out of 28.5 million euros ($39.5 million) of taxes. ""Tax evasion was the mistake of my life,"" Hoeness said in a statement on the Bayern website. ""I want to avert harm to my club. ""Bayern Munich is my life's work and always will be. ""I will stay committed to this great club and its people as long as I live."" Having been the driving force behind the Champions League holders since joining them as an 18-year-old in 1970, Hoeness played a huge part in turning them into a European powerhouse. Bayern have won 21 of their 23 German league titles and all five of their European Cup or Champions League victories with him involved either as a player, club manager or president. Leverkusen have problems of their own and last won on February 7, losing six of their last seven matches.

Leverkusen face a near-impossible task in the return leg at PSG's Parc des Princes, but Hyypia is determined that his side will play with their heads high. ""We won't just throw away the game, otherwise I would have sent the Under-23 squad,"" insisted the 40-year-old ex-Liverpool defender. ""This is a great opportunity for one or two players to show what they can do."" Bayer face a tough week as they follow their trip to Paris with an away match at runaway Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday, who are on a 49-match unbeaten league run. Hyypia has endured a nightmare month since his side last tasted victory with a 1-0 league win at Borussia Moenchengladbach on February 7. Since then they suffered a shock German Cup defeat at home to second-division Kaiserslautern which triggered a five-match losing streak and included the PSG debacle. Only Saturday's 1-1 draw at Hanover 96 stopped the rot, but they have dropped to third in the Bundelsiga and now trail second-placed Borussia Dortmund by four points. Further defeats could see Leverkusen drop out of the Champions League berths. ""This is a good challenge for us to show we are strong,"" insisted Hyypia, who is in his debut season as a head coach. ""My coaching career is not very long and this is the first time that I'm stuck in such a situation. ""Of course I've asked many people for advice as to what I can do. ""I want to develop myself and without this situation that development would progress slower."" At PSG, Hyypia will be without Germany midfielder Lars Bender, who has a leg injury, but should be back to face Bayern. Midfielder Jens Hegeler suffered a torn ankle ligament at Hanover and will likely miss the rest of the season. Centre-back Emir Spahic is suspended after being sent off in the first leg. Winger Gonzalo Castro is set to fill Bender's defensive midfielder role, while 17-year-old Julian Brandt is set to start at right-back."

Guardiola is all too aware that Arsenal claimed a 2-0 win in Munich at the same stage in Europe last season, although Bayern went through on away goals to eventually win the final. ""If we give Arsenal too much possession, we will have big, big problems,"" warned Guardiola. ""If we keep the ball, we'll get into the quarter-finals, if they control it, they'll go through."" Arsenal prepared for their trip to Bavaria with a 4-1 FA Cup quarter-final win over Everton. Gunners manager Arsene Wenger has said the victory, with goals from Mesut Ozil, Mikel Arteta, plus two from Olivier Giroud, put them ""in a good frame of mind psychologically"". But Guardiola is wary as Wolfsburg were still in Saturday's Bundesliga match with 30 minutes left until Bayern ran riot after a below-par first 45 minutes. Germany winger Thomas Mueller and Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic grabbed two goals each as the score leapt from 2-1 after 63 minutes to 6-1 with 80 minutes on the clock. It was a particularly good day for Mandzukic, who came off the bench against his old club for the last 33 minutes to score twice, and give him 16 goals for the season. The 27-year-old has now netted six times in his last five league games to take over from Borussia Dortmund's Robert Lewandowski as the league's top scorer. With second-placed Dortmund playing Freiburg on Sunday, Bayern have opened a record 23-point lead at the top of the table. The win in Wolfsburg was Bayern's 16th Bundesliga victory in a row and bettered their own league record of 15 straight wins in 2005. It extended their record unbeaten league run to 49 matches. It matches Arsenal's Premier League record of 49 games without defeat set in 2004 and is bettered only by AC Milan's record of 58 matches unbeaten from 1991-1993 in Europe's top leagues. Bayern's haul of 72 goals from their first 24 league games broke Werder Bremen's previous record of 70 set in 1985/86 and Bayern have only dropped four points with 22 wins in 24 games."

""We haven't ruled out him playing. The decision will be made during the last training session before the game,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. In the 15-goal striker's absence, Klopp could plump for either Julian Schieber as his lone frontman or push winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang into the middle. Dortmund are second but 20 points behind champions and leaders Bayern Munich. Lewandowski, who is out of contract with Borussia in the summer, has opted to join Bayern next season on a free transfer."

""Next season? It's still far away. I think the base of the squad will remain more or less the same. There will be very, very few new faces,"" he admitted. ""That is more a question for Matthias Sammer,"" he added, referring to the club's sporting director. Guardiola said he had not as yet submitted any transfer wish list to Sammer or chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and refused to comment on speculation linking the European champions with the likes of Chelsea's Brazilian defender David Luiz and Barcelona's Martin Montoya. Bayern, who come into the weekend 20 points clear of nearest rivals Borussia Dortmund at the top of the table, have already confirmed two new signings for next season.

Ribery, UEFA's best player in Europe last season, has not played for Bayern in more than a month after an operation on his buttocks, but made an appearance for France on Wednesday. ""I felt good, those few minutes against the Netherlands were good to get some match practice back. I'm ready,"" said Ribery after France enjoyed a 2-0 win over the Dutch. Bayern are looking to extend their record unbeaten league run to 49 matches and to claim their 11th consecutive victory. Fifth-placed Wolfsburg were hammered 6-2 at Hoffenheim last Sunday and Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer expects a backlash at the Volkswagen Arena. ""They suffered a setback in Hoffenheim and they will try and show a reaction, so we must have a few answers to that,"" said Sammer. With a 20-point lead, Bayern could even wrap up the Bundesliga title before the end of the month. Coach Pep Guardiola will want a convincing win before Tuesday's Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Arsenal with the hosts leading 2-0 from the first-leg in London. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund head to Freiburg on Sunday with a shortage of strikers. Poland's Robert Lewandowski sat out Wednesday's international against Scotland with a knee strain and Under-23 striker Marvin Ducksch is out for a fortnight with an ankle injury. It leaves Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp with only reserve striker Julian Schieber fit, but Germany winger Marco Reus could be switched to play up front. Bayer Leverkusen coach Sami Hyypia is enduring the first crisis of his career after five straight defeats as they look for a first victory in seven years at Hanover 96 on Saturday. ""My coaching career has not been very long and this is the first time that I'm in such a situation,"" said the 40-year-old ex-Liverpool defender. ""Of course, I have spoken to many people to ask advice on what I could do. ""I want to develop myself and I wouldn't be learning so fast if we weren't in this situation."" Hyypia is hoping to have defensive midfielder Sven Bender back after a dead leg. Schalke 04 are looking to bounce back from successive horror defeats when they host Hoffenheim. The Royal Blues were drubbed 6-1 by Real Madrid in the Champions League, then crashed 5-1 at Bayern last Sunday in the Bundesliga. ""We have to look forward now and give the right response on the pitch against Hoffenheim,"" said coach Jens Keller. Peru winger Jefferson Farfan is doubtful with an inflamed knee while centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos is definitely out after being sent off in Munich. At the other end of the table, VfB Stuttgart coach Thomas Schneider must avoid a ninth straight defeat when his side host bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Schneider came close to being dismissed after Sunday's 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt and another loss would surely mean the 41-year-old being fired, despite having only taken charge in August. Schneider has the fans' backing as the Mercedes Benz Arena will be sold out for only the second time this season.

With 100 days to go before the World Cup, Loew has voiced concerns with several first-choice players returning from injury and he said his final squad will be based solely on current form. ""On paper, we have a top team, but the reality is a bit different at the moment,"" said Loew, whose side won nine and drew one of their 10 qualifiers. ""Several players have been injured for months, while others have struggled with a lack of rhythm or form. ""With a view to the World Cup, we won't make any compromises. We have to get everything in line to be successful. ""We have the chance to work on solutions and alternatives to various problems. ""So we have decided to look at a few new faces who have been consistently good for their clubs."" Loew has called up the uncapped quartet of Sampdoria centre-back Shkodran Mustafi, Augsburg midfielder Andre Hahn, Freiburg centre-back Matthias Ginter and Hamburg striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga. Centre-back is the key position where Loew needs depth with first-choice Mats Hummels only just returning from injury and set to partner Bayern's Jerome Boateng. Likewise, midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger has only just returned after ankle surgery, then a knee injury. With Real Madrid's Sami Khedira facing a race against time to be fit for the World Cup after a knee injury, Loew will switch captain Philipp Lahm to partner Schweinsteiger in the defensive midfield against Chile. Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Lars Bender has dropped out with a dead leg and Loew hopes veteran striker Miroslav Klose will start. The 35-year-old is set to become Germany's all-time top-scorer having equalled Gerd Mueller's record of 68 goals in the white shirt, but he sat out Lazio's 1-0 Serie A win against Fiorentina on Sunday with a strained abdominal muscle. Chile will certainly have taken heart from Paraguay's 3-3 draw with Germany last August when the south Americans took an early 2-0 lead after hitting the hosts on the counter-attack before the Germans fought back. Jorge Sampaoli's Chile has been drawn in Group B along with Australia, Spain and the Netherlands at the World Cup. Midfielder Arturo Vidal, who used to play in the Bundesliga for Bayer Leverkusen, has said the south Americans are coming to Stuttgart to shock the hosts. Having qualified third in the South American qualifying group behind Argentina and Colombia, Chile demand respect. ""This is our last test match before the World Cup and we are coming to win it,"" the 26-year-old Juventus midfielder told Sport Bild. ""We attack early, we like to play and we run a lot. ""We play a bit like Borussia Dortmund did last season in the Champions League. ""We have a tough group at the World Cup, but we can be a big surprise and we have never had a bigger chance."""

With Real Madrid's Sami Khedira facing a race against time to be fit for the World Cup after a knee injury, Loew will switch captain Philipp Lahm to partner Schweinsteiger in the defensive midfield against Chile. Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Lars Bender has dropped out with a dead leg and Loew hopes veteran striker Miroslav Klose will start. The 35-year-old is set to become Germany's all-time top-scorer having equalled Gerd Mueller's record of 68 goals in the white shirt, but he sat out Lazio's 1-0 Serie A win against Fiorentina on Sunday with a strained abdominal muscle. Chile will certainly have taken heart from Paraguay's 3-3 draw with Germany last August when the south Americans took an early 2-0 lead after hitting the hosts on the counter-attack before the Germans fought back. Jorge Sampaoli's Chile has been drawn in Group B along with Australia, Spain and the Netherlands at the World Cup. Midfielder Arturo Vidal, who used to play in the Bundesliga for Bayer Leverkusen, has said the south Americans are coming to Stuttgart to shock the hosts. Having qualified third in the South American qualifying group behind Argentina and Colombia, Chile demand respect. ""This is our last test match before the World Cup and we are coming to win it,"" the 26-year-old Juventus midfielder told Sport Bild. ""We attack early, we like to play and we run a lot. ""We play a bit like Borussia Dortmund did last season in the Champions League. ""We have a tough group at the World Cup, but we can be a big surprise and we have never had a bigger chance."""

Dieter Hecking's Wolves had hoped for three points in Hoffenheim to take fourth spot from Schalke 04, who were routed at runaway league leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday. Dutch striker Bas Dost had equalised for Wolves with 15 minutes gone after Roberto Firmino's fourth-minute strike gave Hoffenheim the lead, but the hosts responded with three goals. Hoffenheim led 4-1 at the break as defender Niklas Suele netted before French striker Anthony Modeste scored two goals in four minutes. Croatia forward Ivan Perisic pulled a goal back for Wolves with 15 minutes left. But the visitors had right-back Traesch sent off for a foul in the area and Hoffenheim's Sejad Salihovic netted the penalty before Modeste's replacement Sven Schipplock hit their sixth. Wolfsburg's result leaves them fifth. It means all three teams immediately behind leaders Bayern Munich and second-placed Borussia Dortmund, who beat Nuremberg 3-0 on Saturday, suffered defeats over the weekend. VfB Stuttgart are fourth from bottom after losing 2-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt in what was a club record eighth straight defeat and heaped further pressure on coach Thomas Schneider. Stuttgart striker Martin Harnik's first-half goal was cancelled out by Eintracht midfielder Jan Rosenthal ten minutes from time before captain Alexander Meier hit the 89th-minute winner. On Saturday, an Arjen Robben hat-trick saw Bayern open a 20-point lead at the top of the table with a 5-1 win over ten-man Schalke 04. The Royal Blues suffered a second drubbing in four days after losing 6-1 to Real Madrid in Wednesday's Champions League clash. Bayern extended their record unbeaten league run to 48 matches, dating back to October 2012, and earned their 15th straight league victory. Bayern raced into a 4-0 lead inside half-an-hour as left-back David Alaba netted a free-kick, then Robben scored either side of Mario Mandzukic's header. Schalke were gifted a goal when Jefferson Farfan's corner was turned into his own net by Munich right-back Rafinha, in for captain Philipp Lahm, with 25 minutes left. To compound Schalke's misery, Greece centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos was shown a straight red for bringing down Mandzukic in the area. His foul allowed Robben to wrap up his hat-trick with a 77th-minute penalty. Coach Pep Guardiola flippantly told reporters ""don't ask me about the title"" in broken German on Friday, but with 11 league games left, Bayern can wrap up their 24th German league title by the end of March. Dortmund went second after their comfortable win over Nuremberg as Germany defender Mats Hummels netted on his return after four weeks out with a foot injury. Poland star Robert Lewandowski scored his 15th league goal of the season before Henrikh Mkhitaryan netted their third seven minutes from time. Bayer Leverkusen's dreadful form continued with their fourth straight home defeat as they lost 1-0 at home to Mainz, who moved up to sixth with their fifth win in eight games. Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting slammed home the winner past goalkeeper Bernd Leno on 37 minutes as Leverkusen suffered their eighth defeat in ten games to drop to third. Curiously, both goalkeepers scored own goals as Borussia Moenchengladbach, who are winless in their last eight games, were held to a 1-1 draw at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig."

""We have no choice, but to write off the game,"" said Schalke midfielder Julian Draxler in the wake of the Real debacle. ""We have to get it out of our heads and prepare for Bayern."" Ronaldo finished with ten shots on goal, the same as the entire Schalke team. The Royal Blues now face an equally tough challenge at Bayern, who have won all of their last 14 games and are on a record 47-match unbeaten run. ""They (Bayern) are even better than Real, but we're not just going there to limit the damage,"" said Schalke's director of sport Horst Heldt. Bayern's 4-0 romp at Hanover 96 last Sunday left Pep Guardiola's European champions 19-points clear at the top of the table. If they maintain their lead, their 24th German league title can be confirmed by the end of March at the latest and they have dropped just four points all season. They are on course to become the first Bundesliga side to complete a season unbeaten. In contrast, Schalke's Real debacle was the worst home defeat by a German side in Champions League history and has had a physical effect, as well as battering their confidence. Both centre-back Felipe Santana and central midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng are ruled out with leg injuries. Left-back Sead Kolasinac has a bruised jaw and defensive midfielder Roman Neustaedter has a knee injury. ""It makes no sense to use ailing players, so others will have to get involved,"" said Heldt with a host of changes expected. Bayern are set to welcome back left wing Xherdan Shaqiri while Franck Ribery continues to recover from buttocks surgery. Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger is set to make his second start after back-to-back injuries. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund host Nuremberg on Saturday with concerns at centre-back. Greece defender Sokratis is nursing a foot injury from their 4-2 Champions League last 16, first-leg win at Zenit St Petersburg. Coach Jurgen Klopp is without both his first-choice centre backs. Mats Hummels is on the verge of returning from an ankle knock while Neven Subotic is out for the season with a torn knee ligament. Bayer Leverkusen are second in the table, but low on confidence as they host resurgent Mainz 05 after a horror sequence of seven losses in nine games. Following the shock German Cup defeat at home to second-division Kaiserslautern, Bayer were routed 4-0 at home to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, then crashed 3-1 at Wolfsburg last weekend in the league. ""They have been the worst ten days,"" admitted striker Stefan Kiessling. Leverkusen will be without winger Gonzalo Castro and defender Emir Spahic who are both suspended. Mainz are ninth, but closing in on a top six place after losing just one of their last eight games. There is a relegation battle brewing in the north German derby when strugglers Werder Bremen host Hamburg, who are third from bottom. Hamburg's new coach Mirko Slomka made his debut in last Saturday's shock 3-0 win at home to Borussia Dortmund which broke their run of eight straight defeats. Bremen are winless in their last 11 matches and have just one victory from their last 11 matches. Playing Friday (All times 1430 GMT unless stated) Hertha Berlin v Freiburg (1930)"

Real's Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo also scored twice to see him take over from Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the competition's top-scorer with 11 European goals this season. Netherlands striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored a 91st-minute consolation goal for Schalke, but the Royal Blues still suffered their heaviest defeat in European competition. Carlo Ancelotti's Real are now unbeaten in their last 27 games dating back to October. The huge victory went some way to correcting Real's terrible away record in Germany as they made the Royal Blues of Schalke look anything but regal. This was only Real's second win in 26 visits to Germany after 18 defeats, including their 4-1 drubbing at Borussia Dortmund in last season's Champions League's semi-final. Real needed just 13 minutes to take the lead at the Veltins Arena as their star-studded attack clicked into gear. Wales winger Bale cut in from the right, Ronaldo flicked his pass into space and Benzema beat the Welshman to the loose ball and fired past Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann. Schalke almost immediately equalised as teenage midfielder Max Meyer fired over the bar with the goal at his mercy after Ilker Casillas had blocked Julian Draxler's shot. Schalke were punished for wasting their rare opportunity and with 21 minutes gone, Bale held off two Schalke defenders to make it 2-0 with La Liga leaders in full control. Schalke's situation was not helped by Ronaldo effortlessly switching with Bale from the left to the right wing midway through the first half, only to revert back after the break. Schalke came out all guns blazing for the second-half as Kevin-Prince Boateng forced Casillas into a rare save. But Ronaldo finally got on the scoresheet at the fourth attempt to claim his 10th European goal of the season in his sixth Champions League match. He effortlessly turned Cameroon centre-back Joel Matip inside, then out before tucking the ball just inside the far post with 52 minutes gone. Just five minutes later, his deft backheel fell into Benzema's path for the Frenchman to drill home his second of the night and Real's fourth past the despairing Faehrmann. It was one-way traffic by now and Bale scored his second and Real's fifth when Sergio Ramos's through ball was driven low into the bottom left-hand corner on 69 minutes. Ronaldo then grabbed his second on 89 minutes to leave him with 36 goals in 33 games for Real before Huntelaar finally put Schalke on the board just before the final whistle.

1012,26/02/2014,02:30,Football: Klopp delights as Dortmund hit top gear,Coach Jurgen Klopp said Borussia Dortmund had produced a near-perfect performance to leave them on the verge of the Champions League's quarter-finals after routing Zenit St Petersburg away on Tuesday.,"Poland striker Robert Lewandowski scored twice as Dortmund romped to a 4-2 win at Zenit's Petrovsky Stadium in the last 16, first-leg clash. Klopp was delighted as Borussia bounced back from Saturday's shock 3-0 defeat at relegation-threatened Hamburg in the Bundesliga to dominate Zenit. Last season's finalists raced into a 2-0 lead with goals by Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marco Reus inside the first five minutes to leave the Russians reeling. The hosts pulled two goals back after the break as central midfielder Oleg Shatov scored, then Brazil's Hulk converted a penalty. But on both occasions Dortmund responded almost immediately as Lewandowski scored twice toi give the German side a huge advantage ahead of the second leg next month. ""That was close to an optimal performance,"" said Klopp. ""In terms of pressing and counter pressing, that was a copybook performance from us against a dangerous team. ""We were incredibly active and aggressive. ""It's not easy to do that and the team put in a fantastic performance. ""We played against a very talented side, who showed the whole time that they wanted to play football. ""Even up to the end of the game, St Petersburg didn't resort to hitting long balls and always tried to find ways of getting behind us. ""Zenit were always dangerous whenever Hulk had the ball."" But Klopp urged caution ahead of the return leg on March 19 by insisting nothing has been decided yet. ""Champions League has never been about blowing the final whistle after the first leg,"" said the 46-year-old. ""Overall, this is a very nice night for us, but we are not yet in the quarterfinals. ""We have still a lot of hard work ahead of us in the second leg."" Klopp was clearly delighted to see his team produce the perfect response after the Hamburg defeat had left Dortmund in third place but 20 points behind Bundesliga leaders Bayern. ""It was clear to me that my team would produce a reaction,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""My team can never be accused of going about their business without showing some character. ""We didn't give 100 percent against Hamburg and played too little football. ""We conceded goals at the wrong moments and didn't get a result. ""Today we produced the correct reaction after conceding each goal."""

The hosts pulled two goals back after the break as central midfielder Oleg Shatov scored, then Brazil's Hulk converted a penalty. On both occasions Dortmund gave the perfect response, with Lewandowski scoring just seconds later, as the Germans take a commanding lead home for the second leg on March 19. ""We steered the game in the right direction with the early goals,"" said Dortmund captain Sebastian Kehl. ""We dominated well after that. ""It was clear Zenit would come back at us."" Zenit got off to a nightmare start as both of Reus' first two touches led to goals. With barely four minutes gone, the Germany winger muscled through the Zenit defence and on to a Lewandowski pass. When he went to ground, central midfielder Mkhitaryan fired home to put last season's Champions League finalists ahead. Only 70 seconds later, Mkhitaryan crossed from the right for left winger Kevin Grosskreutz to lay off to Reus, who fired a right-footed shot past Zenit goalkeeper Yuri Lodygin. Zenit leaked nine goals in the group stages and their back four were woeful for both goals. The hosts' coach Luciano Spalletti responded by replacing former Russian captain Andrei Arshavin, who looked to have injured a hamstring, with ex-Bayern Munich midfielder Anatoliy Tymoshchuk. Dortmund struggled to maintain the lightning tempo after the initial goals, while Zenit were left subdued. It finished 2-0 at the break, but the hosts pulled one back on 57 minutes after a goalmouth scramble. New signing Jose Rondon's shot was cleared by Dortmund's Marcel Schmelzer, but the Venezuelan hit the post with the rebound before Shatov rifled his shot home. The goal sparked Dortmund's attack as Lewandowski scored twice to maintain their two-goal advantage. Lewandowski exchanged passes with Poland team-mate Lukasz Piszczek then slotted the ball past Zenit goalkeeper Yuri Lodygin on 61 minutes. Piszczek then conceded a penalty when he blocked Viktor Fayzulin's run into the area and Brazilian right winger Hulk stepped up and smashed home the 69th-minute penalty. It took Dortmund just 90 seconds to reply when Lewandowski snapped up Reus' pass and fired his 71st-minute shot past Lodygin for his second of the game. Spalletti's Zenit looked rusty, having played their last competitive game in December, and face an uphill task in Germany in three weeks. In contrast, Dortmund can start planning for the last eight in Europe having given the perfect response to Saturday's shock 3-0 at relegation-threatened Hamburg in the Bundesliga. ""It was clear to me that my team would produce a reaction,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""My team can never be accused of going about their business without showing some character, but we still have work to do in the second leg."""

Ancelotti said the midfield star was ""highly motivated"" for the last 16 clash at the Veltins Arena having scored nine goals in five European games this season. ""He's really wanted to play, he was not happy about not being able to do so,"" said Ancelotti. ""He's done very well in training. ""He is in optimal physical and mental shape."" Unbeaten in their last 26 matches in all competitions, Real are eager to progress having reached the Champions League's semi-finals for the last three seasons. ""I do not have to say much to motivate my players because they want to play a leading role in all competitions,"" said the 54-year-old Italian, who won the European Cup twice as a player with AC Milan and its successor the Champions League a further two times as coach of Milan. ""The Champions League is the most prestigious, but also the most difficult competition. ""There is no doubt that we are in a very good shape and we want to continue our good run."" Madrid have an awful record in Germany, prevailing just once in 24 previous away matches against Bundesliga opposition and losing 17 times. That includes a 4-1 drubbing at Borussia Dortmund in last season's semi-final first leg when Robert Lewandowski hit all four goals. Schalke are fourth in the Bundesliga and having been guilty of erratic form in the first half of the season, they won their first four games of 2014. Ancelotti singled out Schalke's rising midfield stars Max Meyer (18) and Julian Draxler (20), who is on the verge of returning from a foot injury, combined with proven stars Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Kevin-Prince Boateng. ""They have very good young players like Draxler, although I do not know if he will play tomorrow, and very experienced players like Huntelaar or Boateng,"" said Ancelotti. ""It's not a spectacular team, but they have a very effective, solid game. ""I expect an intense match in which Schalke will give everything."" Ancelotti also said Welsh winger Gareth Bale is set to start, ""he plays when he's fit"", while Schalke coach Jens Keller has said his side will not be overawed by star-studded Real.

""We want to be the second football lighthouse in Germany,"" Watzke told daily newspaper the Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung. ""The lighthouse doesn't have to be quite so big as the red and white one in the south (Bayern Munich), but the yellow-black (Borussia's colours) lighthouse must be stable and it must shine."" With Bayern currently enjoying a 19-point lead over their Bundesliga rivals and third-placed Dortmund 20 points behind the Bavarian giants, Watzke said the huge gulf does not reflect well. ""The current state of the Bundesliga does not look good,"" he admitted. Last season Bayern poached Dortmund's star midfielder Mario Goetze, while Poland striker Robert Lewandowski will join Munich at the end of the season, something Watzke has no problem with. ""What Bayern have done is definitely not reprehensible,"" said Watzke. ""It's just what every business in Germany tries to do to their rivals.

Schalke are eight matches undefeated themselves, but could only manage a goalless draw at home against Mainz in the Bundesliga on Friday.

Madrid will be able to call on the firepower of Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, who returns from a three-game ban.

""Our team is fit and we are fully focused, a big plus for us is our great fighting spirit,"" said Zenit's ex-Bayern midfielder Anatoliy Tymoshchuk. Zenit's director of sport Dietmar Beiersdorf was at Hamburg's Imtech Arena to witness Dortmund's debacle. ""Of course, Borussia Dortmund fill the favourite role,"" said the former Hamburg boss. ""The team has a very good reputation in Russia, it'll be a great challenge for our club and our team."" There is a danger the Russians will be rusty.

Zenit ""is one hundred percent ready for Borussia Dortmund,"" insisted their Italian coach Luciano Spalletti, but his side won five of their ten friendlies in Qatar, Israel and Turkey over the winter break. Nevertheless, Klopp was furious with his team's mentality against a Hamburg side who had lost their last eight matches and admitted they were punished for taking their hosts too lightly. But Dortmund centre-back Manuel Friedrich has said they will not make the same mistake against Zenit. ""That was a blip,"" insisted Friedrich. ""If we play like we know we can, then we can beat anyone. ""Everyone has to question his attitude, results like that can happen, it's hard to explain them. ""Our performance and mood for Tuesday's game won't be affected by the result in Hamburg."" Bender's injury does not help Klopp, who is already without centre-back Neven Subotic and winger Jakub Blaszczykowski who both miss the rest of the season with torn knee ligaments. Dortmund's Germany defensive midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has not played since August after suffering from a back injury and virus. Germany centre-back Mats Hummels did not train on Sunday and is struggling with an ankle injury. Likewise, Poland striker Robert Lewandowski missed training with illness, but will fly to Russia. A section of the Petrovsky stadium, where Zenit's hardcore 'ultra' fans normally congregate, will be closed after sanctions from European football's governing body UEFA. UEFA fined Zenit 40,000 euros (US$55,000) after their fans displayed a racist banner and threw fireworks amidst crowd trouble at Austria Vienna on December 11, when the Russians lost 4-1. Zenit qualified for the last 16 despite winning just one of their Group G matches, but Beiersdorf said Dortmund will run out into a volatile atmosphere. ""Borussia can expect a bubbling cauldron,"" he added."

Hanover offered little resistance as Germany winger Thomas Mueller scored twice while attacking midfielder Thiago Alcantara and Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic also netted. There was more good news for both Bayern and Germany as Bastian Schweinsteiger made his first start since November after an ankle, then knee injury, to partner captain Philipp Lahm in the defensive midfield. ""It was good to start and have no problems, I feel good, even in terms of fitness,"" said Schweinsteiger. ""I still need to get into my rhythm and need some more match practice to get top fit. I just hope things stay positive for me."" Brazil's Rafinha, who took over from Lahm at right-back, strengthened his case for a Selecao place at June's World Cup with two crosses which both led to goals. Mueller set Bayern on the way to their 14th consecutive league win when he headed home Rafinha's cross with 25 minutes gone. Thiago then chested down Schweinsteiger's superb pass and fired home to make it 2-0 after 34 minutes. Mueller profited from a Mandzukic pass to get behind the Hanover defence and score his second on 59 minutes, while Mandzukic then headed home Rafinha's cross for Bayern's fourth, seven minutes later. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund suffered a shock 3-0 league defeat at strugglers Hamburg ahead of Tuesday's Champions League last-16 clash at Zenit St Petersburg. Hamburg recorded their first league win since November in Mirko Slomka's first match in charge as his side broke their eight-match losing streak, including a club record seven league matches. The result sees Hamburg remain among the relegation places, but move up to 16th, while Dortmund stay third. There was more bad news for Jurgen Klopp on Sunday as defensive midfielder Sven Bender was ruled out for the next 10 weeks with an inflamed pelvis. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen went down 3-1 at VfL Wolfsburg as Sami Hyypia's side lost for the seventh time in their last nine games. Leverkusen suffered a Champions League hangover, following their 4-0 last-16, first-leg home defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, with another poor display. Braunschweig are now three points adrift at the bottom after their 2-1 defeat at ten-man Nuremberg in a match where three penalties were saved. Borussia Moenchengladbach stay sixth, but are winless in their last seven games after their 2-2 draw at home to Hoffenheim. Augsburg got back to winning ways with a 4-2 victory at Freiburg to bounce back from last weekend's defeat to Nuremberg, their only loss in the last eight games. VfB Stuttgart are just above the bottom three after they suffered their seventh straight defeat at home to Hertha Berlin, who ran out 2-1 winners. Hertha's replacement striker Sandro Wagner headed the winner, three minutes from time, but was then sent off for a second yellow card having only been on the pitch for 12 minutes. Fourth-placed Schalke, who host Real Madrid in Wednesday's Champions League last-16, first-leg clash, stayed fourth after their goalless draw at home to Mainz 05 on Friday."

The 46-year-old Slomka has just 13 matches left to prevent former European champions Hamburg being relegated from Germany's top flight for the first time. And he has a tough opener against a resurgent Dortmund side who have won their last four matches and are eager to reclaim second spot in the league. Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund will be using the match to tune up for Tuesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg trip to Russia to face Zenit St Petersburg having hammered Eintracht Frankfurt 4-0 at home last Saturday. ""The challenge of facing Dortmund is a good measuring stick for us,"" said Slomka. ""Everyone knows them and how they play, but we have a home game and, as I already have said and will keep on saying, we must win our home games. ""And I am sure the fans will give their support on Saturday."" Some 800 supporters turned out to watch Slomka's first training session on Monday. The response was a far cry from their last home game when angry fans pelted the team and attacked their cars following the 3-0 defeat to Hertha Berlin two weeks ago. Both sides have injury concerns with Hamburg missing captain Rafael van der Vaart, who suffered an ankle injury in last Saturday's 4-2 loss at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig which led to Van Marwijk's dismissal. Dortmund hope to welcome back winger Marco Reus, although centre-back Mats Hummels is expected to miss out as his ankle injury continues to heal. League leaders Bayern Munich are at mid-table Hanover 96 on Sunday evening looking to maintain their 16-point lead at the top of the table and extend their unbeaten league run to 47 matches. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola will be without France winger Franck Ribery, who also missed their 2-0 win at Arsenal on Wednesday in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie as he recovers from buttock surgery. But Ribery, 30, has said he is targeting a return against Schalke 04 next Saturday. Meanwhile, Bayern's Germany midfielder Toni Kroos, who scored their first goal at Arsenal, is no closer to agreeing to a new Munich deal past 2015, with wages being the main stumbling block. ""There are no further discussions planned in the near future,"" he told German magazine Kicker with a host of Premier League clubs chasing his signature. Schalke host Mainz 05 on Friday hoping to pick up a morale-boosting fifth straight win before Wednesday's Champions League visit of Real Madrid.

1036,18/02/2014,13:27,Football: Slomka's extra training to keep Hamburg up,New coach Mirko Slomka has nearly doubled the weekly quota of training sessions for relegation-threatened Hamburg in a bid to prevent their first relegation from Germany's top-flight.,"The 46-year-old signed a two-year deal on Monday, but has just 13 games left to get 17th-placed Hamburg out of the relegation places with Champions League side Borussia Dortmund their next opponents at home on Saturday. ""It's good that we have Dortmund up next, it's a fantastic chance to show there is still life in the team,"" said Slomka, who took his first training session on Monday in front of 17 television cameras. Hamburg will be without captain Rafael van der Vaart for the next few weeks with an ankle injury. Slomka's predecessor, ex-Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk, was sacked on Saturday after a seventh straight league as Hamburg were drubbed 4-2 at the Bundesliga's bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Sacked by Hanover 96 in December, Slomka has raised Hamburg's training sessions from four to seven per week and has said that, unlike Van Marwijk, he will be living in Hamburg with his family based in Hanover. ""Hamburg is the city in which I really want to live,"" added Slomka. ""I'll rarely be going home."" A clock at Hamburg's Imtech Arena shows the club has been in the Bundesliga since it was founded more than 50 years ago and Slomka, as Van Marwijk did before him, said they should be much higher up the table. ""Hamburg should be amongst the top five clubs in Germany,"" he said. ""This is an exciting challenge, but first of all we need to make up the two places to get out of the relegation places."" With his side on a club record run of defeats, Slomka has said it is his job now to coax performances out of the Hamburg squad. ""These players have been recruited especially for this club, they have their strengths and we want to tease it out of them,"" he said."
1037,18/02/2014,11:50,Football: Bundesliga's marketing lags behind England: CEO,"All four German clubs have reached the Champions League's last 16, but Bundesliga boss Christian Seifert believes the German league is ten years behind England's Premier League in its marketing.","The 2013 Champions League final was an all-German affair last May as Bayern Munich enjoyed a 2-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund at London's Wembley. This season, both Bundesliga sides have joined domestic rivals Schalke and Bayer Leverkusen, who host Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, in the competition's last 16. But Seifert says while the Germans may be enjoying on-field success, their marketing is a decade behind that of their English rivals. In January, Premier League side Arsenal signed a five-year kit deal with Puma worth 30 million pounds (36.6 million euros, US$50m) per season. ""I am convinced that the Bundesliga will benefit from sustained good performances in Europe, in terms of global marketing,"" Seifert, CEO of the German Football League (DFL) told Hamburg daily Handelsblatt. ""But when you read that Puma have just pledged a three-figure deal in terms of millions, then that is food for thought. ""In terms of international marketing, the Bundesliga is ten years behind the Premier League."" Both Bayern and their Bundesliga rivals Hertha Berlin have announced recent bumper sponsorship deals. Munich's coffers will be boosted by an extra 110 million euros from Bavarian-based finance services company Allianz and Hertha have attracted 61.2 million euros from American investment group KKR. Seifert sees both developments as positive for the league. ""In my view, such a financial commitment can be quite meaningful,"" he said. ""After all, the Bundesliga is economically and sportingly one of the strongest professional leagues in the world."" But Seifert warns clubs to be wary of big-money deals from investors who could pull out overnight. ""During that period, an investor would have had some influence on the course of the competition, including de facto relegation and qualifications for international competitions,"" he said. ""We owe it to the clubs, their fans and their business partners to look at these deals very closely."" There are already safeguard measures in Germany, where the ""50+1"" rule means each club has to have a controlling stake to stop commercial investors gaining control. At European champions Bayern Munich, for example, Audi, Adidas and now Allianz each own nine per cent, but the rest is controlled by the members via the club."

Arsenal were outclassed in the first leg last season as Bayern, who were then managed by Jupp Heynckes, cruised to a 3-1 victory in north London. But the Gunners responded with a shock 2-0 win in the return game and came close to competing a stunning fightback before bowing out on away goals. Winning in Munich proved a major boost for Wenger's side, who had lost their way at that time but finished the season strongly and have maintained their impressive form for much of the current campaign. Yet Bayern, now coached by former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola, are arguably an even more formidable force this season than they were last year, when they won the Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup. The Bavarians will swagger into the Emirates Stadium on a 46-match unbeaten run in the Bundesliga. They lead the German top-flight by 16 points, allowing them to focus fully on retaining the Champions League crown they won against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley last year. But Wenger remains optimistic and the Gunners manager is confident the experience of last season's encounters will stand his players in good stead as they seek to end Bayern's reign as holders. ""I think we know them better, individually the players,"" he said. ""We will be in a better condition hopefully, because last year was after the disappointment of losing against Blackburn in the FA Cup, to play Bayern three days later it was very difficult for us. ""I think in the league as well we were in a much more difficult position. Now we are mentally better prepared to go into a game of that stature."" While Bayern have swept aside all challengers under Heynckes and now Guardiola, Arsenal's trophy drought has stretched into a ninth year. Still, the Gunners' French midfielder Mathieu Flamini sees no reason for his team-mates to go into the tie with an inferiority complex. Citing Sunday's gritty 2-1 FA Cup fifth round win over Liverpool as proof of Arsenal's improved spirit and mental strength, Flamini said: ""What I will say about this season is that I see a great commitment, I see everyone working very hard on the pitch and helping each other. ""We know it won't be an easy game because Bayern are a very strong team, but we are Arsenal, we have big ambitions. ""We will do everything to qualify for the next round in the Champions League."" Arsenal will be without suspended Spanish midfielder Mikel Arteta, but Bayern have more significant absentees. France winger Franck Ribery is sidelined after buttock surgery, while Swiss forward Xherdan Shaqiri suffered a thigh injury after scoring twice in Saturday's 4-0 win over Freiburg. Even those injuries are unlikely to perturb Guardiola, whose side are respectful of the dangers posed by Arsenal without being intimidated by the Premier League team. ""We're not going there for a 0-0 draw, we want to win in London, of course,"" Bayern captain Philipp Lahm said. ""It won't be easy, they have put some confidence back in the tank after the Liverpool result."" Centre-back Jerome Boateng believes Arsenal are ""stronger"" than last season and he claimed Mesut Ozil has added an extra menace to their attacking play, even though the Germany international has endured an up and down first season in English football. ""Mesut Ozil is their key player and we have to be wide awake,"" Boateng said. ""We have to prove on the pitch that we are better. We don't want to go into the return match chasing a result."""
1039,15/02/2014,22:13,Football: Strugglers Hamburg sack Van Marwijk,"Hamburg fired coach Bert van Marwijk after just 143 days in charge in the wake of Saturday's 4-2 drubbing at Bundesliga bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, the club has confirmed.","""We were forced at this time to make this regretful decision and we thank Bert van Marwijk for his work,"" said Hamburg's sporting director Oliver Kreuzer in a statement after the board met on Saturday night. The 61-year-old ex-Netherlands boss, who steered the Oranje to the 2010 World Cup final, was sacked after eight straight defeats with Hamburg second from bottom of the table. German daily Bild report Mirko Slomka, who was sacked by Hanover 96 in December, is the favourite to replace Van Marwijk for Saturday's Bundesliga match at home to third-placed Borussia Dortmund. Hammered 5-0 at home by Bayern Munich in the German Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday, Hamburg have also now lost their last seven league games, an unwelcome club record. They have the worst defensive record in the Bundesliga having leaked 51 goals after 21 matches and are desperate to avoid being relegated from the top flight for the first time in their history. The defeat at Braunschweig means Hamburg remain second from bottom, but now only four points separate the bottom five teams. Hamburg took the lead at Braunschweig when striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga grabbed the opening goal on his return from injury on 23 minutes. But Braunschweig's Democratic Republic of Congo-born Dominick Kumbela came off the bench to score twice before Croatia midfielder Ivo Ilicevic appeared to save Hamburg's blushes with the equaliser 14 minutes from time. However, Kumbela wrapped up his hat-trick when he pounced in a goal-mouth scramble after another mistake from Hamburg's German international goalkeeper Rene Adler, who had a dreadful afternoon between the posts. To add to the visitors' misery, midfielder Jan Hochscheidt scored Braunschweig's fourth in the third minute of added time. There were already angry scenes after Hamburg's 3-0 league defeat at home to Hertha Berlin last Saturday when angry fans pelted the players and attacked their luxury cars. Van Marwijk was Hamburg's 10th coach in the last decade and only replaced Thorsten Fink in September."
1040,14/02/2014,16:32,"Football: Ramos is going nowhere, say Hertha",Hertha Berlin on Friday denied rumours that their top-scoring Colombian forward Adrian Ramos had agreed to join Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund in the summer.,"""It's false,"" said the sporting director of Hertha, Michael Preetz, ahead of their crucial Bundesliga clash with Wolfsburg at the weekend. A number of reports in the German and international media have claimed in the last few days that the current top scorer in the Bundesliga had agreed a four-year contract with Dortmund to begin in the summer, when Robert Lewandowski will leave the Signal-Iduna Park to join Bayern Munich. Ramos, 28, is having his best season in Germany since moving there five years ago from Colombian club America de Cali. He has scored 14 goals, including seven in his last six league matches, leaving him one ahead of Lewandowski. Hertha are currently in an impressive seventh place on their return to the Bundesliga after gaining promotion from the second tier last season."
1041,14/02/2014,02:10,Football: Bayern welcome back Schweinsteiger as Arsenal await,Bayern Munich hope Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger will start against Freiburg in the Bundesliga on Saturday as the holders warm-up for next week's Champions League clash at Arsenal.,"The 29-year-old made his comeback after three months out with an ankle injury, playing the last 25 minutes of Wednesday's 5-0 romp at Hamburg in the German Cup quarter-finals. Schweinsteiger is set to feature at Munich's Allianz Arena as the European champions prepare to face the Gunners away in Wednesday's last 16, first leg, of the Champions League. Coach Pep Guardiola welcomed back his midfield general: ""It's super, super, super news, he has huge experience, but he still needs time."" Such is Bayern's strength in depth that they have continued to pick up wins even without the likes of Schweinsteiger and injured France winger Franck Ribery, who is out until March after an operation on his buttocks. Bayern have won all of their last nine matches, are unbeaten in a record 45 league matches and are 13 points clear in the table. Freiburg coach Christian Streich has suggested some unusual tactics against the league leaders -- to make sure Bayern enjoy themselves. ""Bayern should have fun and they only have that when they play against a good opponent,"" said the eccentric Streich, with his side 15th in the league, just above the relegation places. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund are chasing a second win this week over Eintracht Frankfurt at home. Gabon international winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang headed home Dortmund's second-half winner at Frankfurt in Tuesday's 1-0 cup quarter-final victory. Frankfurt climbed up to 12th in the table with a 3-0 win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig last Saturday as they bounced back from their 5-0 drubbing at Bayern the week before. Dortmund are hoping to have Germany midfielders Marco Reus and Sven Bender back after the pair both suffered thigh injuries in last Saturday's 5-1 win over Werder Bremen. ""We'll have to see, we don't want to take a risk with either of them,"" said coach Jurgen Klopp with both expected to train on Friday. There is still no news on when Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan will return to training after suffering from a virus. Bert van Marwijk is in a precarious position as he takes 17th-placed Hamburg to bottom side Eintracht Frankfurt with huge doubts over his future after a club record of six league defeats. Ex-Bayern, Schalke and Wolfsburg coach Felix Magath has already been widely tipped to replace former Holland coach Van Marwijk, who only took charge in September. Director of sport Oliver Kreuzer said he only has a job guarantee until Saturday, but another defeat could well be the Dutchman's last. Saturday's top clash sees second-side Bayer Leverkusen, who suffered a shock 1-0 cup defeat at home to second-division Kaiserslautern on Wednesday, host fourth-placed Schalke. Schalke were buoyed on Thursday when captain and centre-back Benedikt Hoewedes made a surprise return to training sooner than expected after recovering from a leg injury. ""The healing process has gone very, very well, but he still has a few problems and is still questionable,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. Keller said right back Atsuto Uchida has flown back to Japan and could face an operation for a leg injury, while midfielders Julian Draxler and Roman Neustaedter are both in the squad for Leverkusen.

1049,11/02/2014,13:25,Football: Wheels come off for Dortmund's Lewandowski,"Borussia Dortmund's Bayern Munich-bound star striker Robert Lewandowski has fallen foul of thieves after all four tyres were stolen from his luxury Porsche, which was also damaged.","Lewandowski's Dortmund are at Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday in the German Cup quarter-finals, but the Poland star's car problems came after he scored twice in Borussia's 5-1 league win at Werder Bremen last Saturday. Reports in the German media say the 25-year-old had the tyres stolen from his Porsche Cayenne GTS, which costs around 90,000 euros ($123,000) and was parked outside his Dortmund home, with only bricks left to keep the car off the ground. Lewandowski's car was tipped forward during the suspected prank, badly damaging the front brakes. The high jinx will not be cheap. A brand-new set of winter tyres will cost around 2500 euros for Lewandowski, who is reported to earn up to four million euros at Dortmund and local police confirmed they have received a complaint for the missing tyres. Dortmund fans are suspected of carrying out the attack after the Poland striker fell out with supporters when he announced in January that he would be joining rivals Bayern Munich at the end of the season, ending weeks of speculation. Lewandowski's Dortmund contract expires in June and he leaves for Bayern on a free contract having scored 24 league goals in 31 league games last season, plus 10 in last season's Champions League, as Dortmund lost to Bayern in the Wembley final.

Reports in the German media say the 25-year-old had the tyres stolen from his Porsche Cayenne GTS, which was parked outside his Dortmund home, with only bricks left to keep the car off the ground. Lewandowski's car was tipped forward during the prank, badly damaging the front brakes. Dortmund fans are suspected of carrying out the attack after the Poland striker fell out with supporters when he announced in January that he would be joining rivals Bayern Munich at the end of the season, ending weeks of speculation. Lewandowski's Dortmund contract expires in June and he leaves for Bayern on a free contract having scored 24 league goals in 31 league games last season, plus 10 in last season's Champions League, as Dortmund lost to Bayern in the Wembley final.

""That was a game where there was nothing to criticise."" In a double-header, Frankfurt host 2012 German Cup winners Dortmund in the cup on Tuesday, then travel to Borussia's Westfalenstadion on Saturday for a league match.

Klopp is already without both centre-back Neven Subotic and winger Jakub Blaszczykowski for the rest of the season as the pair have torn knee ligament injuries. Frankfurt also have a few injury concerns with captain Pirmin Schwegler carrying a rib injury and fellow midfielder Johannes Flum, who scored in Saturday's 3-0 win over bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, has a thigh strain. ""We normally do well against Borussia at home, we lost 2-1 to them earlier this season and drew 3-3 last season, which was a real spectacle,"" said Eintracht midfielder Alexander Maier.

If success is the yardstick for sex appeal, then Rejek's comments would be blown out of the water. It is 10 years since 1860 last played in the Bundesliga and even with Bayern again running away with this season's league title, chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge could not resist a flirty reply, despite an initial ""no comment"" from the club. ""More girls and women come to watch Bayern games than go to 1860 matches, that should prove we are the sexier club,"" said the 58-year-old. Ever the gentleman, Bayern coach Pep Guardiola said it would be 'super' if eighth-placed 1860 won promotion back to Germany's top flight and both Munich clubs could cohabit the Bundesliga. ""Until now, I have only felt the rivalry between Bayern and Borussia Dortmund, not between us and 1860,"" said the ex-Barcelona coach. ""Normally, there is a stronger rivalry between two teams in the same city. ""For the city and for the atmosphere it would be super if 1860 were promoted."" Not least because, as 1860 midfielder Dominik Stahl claimed: ""A real Munich resident is a Lions fan, 1860 is more the club which everyone can identify with""."
1062,05/02/2014,16:21,Football: Fresh blow for Dortmund as Hummels injures ankle,Borussia Dortmund have suffered a fresh blow with Germany defender Mats Hummels expected to miss the next fortnight with a new foot injury.,"The 25-year-old hurt his right foot in a friendly 4-3 win over second-division Fortuna Duesseldorf on Tuesday and Dortmund's team doctor Markus Braun has said he is expected to be out for two weeks. The centre-back only made his return in Friday's 2-1 win at Eintracht Braunschweig after two-months out after injuring his right heel against England in a friendly international. A scan on the ankle showed the November injury has fully healed, but the new ligament strain will need a fortnight's rest. With Dortmund third in the table, Hummels will miss Saturday's league match at home to Werder Bremen, plus two matches against Eintracht Frankfurt within four days, first in Tuesday's German Cup quarter-finals, then in the Bundesliga. Hummels' injury is more bad news for Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp with both centre-back Neven Subotic and winger Jakub Blaszczykowski out for the rest of the season with torn knee ligament injuries. The loss of Hummels means Klopp will again be down to his fourth-choice centre-back in either veteran Manuel Friedich or teenager Marian Sarr alongside Greek centre-back Sokratis. There was some good news for Klopp on Tuesday as attacking midfielder Jonas Hofmann scored twice and new-signing Milos Jojic made his debut in the win over Fortuna."

Spain's Thiago Alcantara set a new Bundesliga record with 185 ball contacts as Bayern's midfield dominated. ""They showed from the start who was the boss,"" enthused ex-Bayern president Franz Beckenbauer. ""At the break they could have been three of four-nil ahead."" Germany star Goetze put the hosts ahead when he chested down Mario Mandzukic's cross and slammed his shot inside the far post with only 12 minutes gone. France star Ribery then proved he has recovered from a leg injury when he added Bayern's second just before the break. Likewise, Robben came off the bench and fired home Goetze's final pass to put his leg injury behind him on 67 minutes before Dante headed Bayern's fourth two minutes later. Fittingly, Mandzukic, who was dropped ten days ago for poor training performances, netted their fifth on 89 minutes and was mobbed by his team-mates. ""He has reacted really well and today was a super performance,"" enthused Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer. This was Bayern's 17th win in 19 games and they have conceded just nine league goals. The European champions now face Freiburg, Hamburg and Nuremberg, who are all in the bottom four, before their Champions League last 16, first-leg match at Arsenal on February 19. Earlier, ten-man Nuremberg climbed out of the bottom three for the first time since October with only their second win of the season after Sunday's 3-1 victory at Hertha Berlin to climb to 15th. Nuremberg's Swiss striker Josip Drmic scored twice, including a penalty deep in added time to claim his second brace in as many weeks. There was drama on the stroke of 90 minutes when Nuremberg midfielder Ondrej Petrak was sent off for saving a shot with his hand. Despite furious protests from Hertha, referee Michael Weiner did not award the home team a penalty as Berlin's Ramos had fired from an offside position. On Saturday, second-placed Bayer Leverkusen broke their three-match losing streak with a 2-1 win at home to VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga. Swiss striker Eren Derdiyok headed home Leverkusen's winner six minutes from time. Stuttgart's Moritz Leitner had given the visitors an early lead before Bayer striker Stefan Kiessling equalised in the first half. Schalke 04 moved up to fourth with a 2-1 victory at home to ten-man VfL Wolfsburg with Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng firing home the winner nine minutes from time. The Royal Blues, who have lost just once in nine games, had taken an early lead after a scrappy goal was credited to Brazilian centre-back Felipe Santana as both he and Boateng lunged for the ball. Wolfsburg drew level despite being down to 10 men, after Daniel Caligiuri was sent off for insulting the referee five minutes into the second-half, when teenager Maximilian Arnold fired home on 65 minutes. But Boateng then fired home the winner for his sixth goal of the season to give Schalke their second straight win. Hanover 96's revival under new coach Tayfun Korkut continued as they earned a 3-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach with Senegal's Mame Diouf scoring twice. There was a strong South Korean influence in Mainz's 2-0 win at home to Freiburg as Park Joo-Ho and Koo Ja-Cheol netted to lift Mainz to seventh. Werder Bremen's poor form continues as they suffered a 3-1 defeat at Augsburg with the visitors finishing up with ten men. Hamburg's slump also as they were drubbed 3-0 at Hoffenheim, leaving Bert van Marwijk's side second from bottom as they suffered their fifth straight defeat.

Dortmund won consecutive Bundesliga titles in 2010-11 and 2011-12, culminating in Borussia's 5-2 drubbing of Bayern in the German Cup final in May 2012. Watzke believes it was that result which spurned Bayern into poaching Dortmund's stars after Munich had twice missed out to Borussia in the league. ""Bayern wanted to destroy us,"" Watzke told German daily Bild with third-placed Dortmund currently 17 points behind leaders Bayern in the table. ""Not in the sense that they wanted to break us as people, because they don't like us, but because they wanted to switch us off permanently as a direct competitor. ""They have helped themselves to our players, so we wouldn't be a danger to them again. ""It was all done legitimately and we have to live with that. ""When we beat Bayern 5-2 in the German Cup final, I saw it in the faces of Munich's top figures. Bayern then hit back."" The Bavarian giants became the first German team to win the treble of European, league and cup titles last season, beating Dortmund 2-1 in the Champions League final. ""If they offer players twice as much money, we have no chance,"" said Watzke. ""There is now no other league which is dominated by a single club like the Bundesliga."" Dortmund on Friday completed the signing of promising Serbia attacking midfielder Milos Jojic from Partizan Belgrade until June 2018. The 21-year-old joins for around 2.2 million euros ($3m) and scored on his Serbia debut last October. Watzke has said more signings will follow at the end of the season and there will be a slight shift in their transfer policy. ""We will be buying in the summer. That means previously we have only spent what we have earned on transfers,"" said Watzke. ""Now we are going to invest, and not with small sums. ""We definitely won't go into debt, we will stay on our course, but our goal remains to be the second power in German football."" With Lewandowski leaving on a free transfer for Bayern, Dortmund are also reported to be set to sign Hertha Berlin's Colombia striker Adrian Ramos for the 2014-15 season. The 28-year-old has told Hertha that he wants to leave in May, although his contract runs until June 2015."

But despite their status as overwhelming favourites to retain the title this season, Guardiola says they cannot afford to take their eye off the ball, particularly following Wednesday's last-minute 2-1 victory at VfB Stuttgart. ""If a team doesn't lose 43 times and everyone says that the Bundesliga (title-race) is over, with the championship is secured, it's not easy for the player's to stay focused,"" said Guardiola. ""To always win, win, win -- I know how difficult that is."" The victory gave Bayern yet another league record as they went 28 away matches unbeaten, breaking Hamburg's previous mark of 27 set in 1983. Last season they broke or equalled 25 Bundesliga records, winning the title with a record six games to spare, as they finished up with a 25-point margin. Stuttgart came the closest of any team to beating Bayern in the league this season until Thiago Alcantara's last-minute bicycle kick broke their resistence. That was enough to see the rest of the league as good as throw in the towel as far as the Bundesliga is concerned. Guardiola has not even had his entire squad available so far this season with Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger the main star currently sidelined with a knee injury. And Bayern's main rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen both admit that they are fighting for second place at best. ""Bayern aren't from this world at the moment,"" said Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller, whose team are second despite three successive defeats. ""The danger is very real that it will be boring at the top."" Leverkusen host Stuttgart, who have also lost their last three, on Saturday hoping to have Germany winger Sidney Sam back from injury, while they have signed experienced Mexico left winger Andres Guardado from Valencia on loan until the end of the season. Third-placed Dortmund are also looking to end a run of poor performances, which saw them pick up just five points in their last seven games, when they travel to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig on Friday. ""Earning second-place would be like winning the championship now,"" Dortmund midfielder Jonas Hofmann said. Dortmund have been blighted with injuries of late. Poland winger Jakub Blaszczykowski became their second player ruled out for the season with a knee injury after defender Neven Subotic. Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan is laid low with a virus, having only just recovered from a back problem. ""He has a viral infection, everyone knows how long it takes to get over something like that,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, who labelled his side 'hunters' in the quest for second place behind Bayern. ""He is nearly ready to come back, but it will take time."" Fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach, who are level on points with Dortmund, are at Hanover 96 on Saturday. Gladbach lost third spot as a consequence of their 2-0 defeat to Bayern last Friday and coach Lucien Favre has said they must learn from their mistakes. ""Hanover have only lost one game at home this season and it'll be as hard to win there as it is against Bayern,"" said Favre. Fixtures (all times GMT):"

That was enough to see the rest of the league as good as throw in the towel as far as the Bundesliga is concerned. Guardiola has not even had his entire squad available so far this season with Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger the main star currently sidelined with a knee injury. And Bayern's main rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen both admit that they are fighting for second place at best. ""Bayern aren't from this world at the moment,"" said Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller, whose team are second despite three successive defeats. ""The danger is very real that it will be boring at the top."" Leverkusen host Stuttgart, who have also lost their last three, on Saturday hoping to have Germany winger Sidney Sam back from injury, while they have signed experienced Mexico left winger Andres Guardado from Valencia on loan until the end of the season. Third-placed Dortmund are also looking to end a run of poor performances, which saw them pick up just five points in their last seven games, when they travel to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig on Friday. ""Earning second-place would be like winning the championship now,"" Dortmund midfielder Jonas Hofmann said. Dortmund have been blighted with injuries of late. Poland winger Jakub Blaszczykowski became their second player ruled out for the season with a knee injury after defender Neven Subotic. Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan is laid low with a virus, having only just recovered from a back problem. ""He has a viral infection, everyone knows how long it takes to get over something like that,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, who labelled his side 'hunters' in the quest for second place behind Bayern. ""He is nearly ready to come back, but it will take time."" Fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach, who are level on points with Dortmund, are at Hanover 96 on Saturday. Gladbach lost third spot as a consequence of their 2-0 defeat to Bayern last Friday and coach Lucien Favre has said they must learn from their mistakes. ""Hanover have only lost one game at home this season and it'll be as hard to win there as it is against Bayern,"" said Favre. Fixtures (all times GMT):"

United manager David Moyes flew to Germany to join Kroos' agent Sascha Breese in watching Bayern's 2-0 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday.

Having made 41 appearances for Germany, Kroos is out of contract with Bayern in June 2015 and the European champions are eager to extend his deal.

But Sami Hyypia-coached Leverkusen were stunned at Freiburg as the hosts twice came from behind before midfielder Felix Klaus hit the dramatic 90th-minute winner. ""We were okay in the first-half, then we gave away too much ball and Freiburg counter-attacked us,"" admitted Hyypia. ""They were dangerous, we tried to win the game, but then came the final counter attack."" The result saw Freiburg climb out of the bottom three up to 15th as the hosts cancelled out goals by Bayer midfielders Lars Bender and Simon Rolfes. Leverkusen have lost their last three games after finishing 2013 with league defeats to strugglers Frankfurt and Bremen. Bayern can extend their lead even further with a trip to VfB Stuttgart on Wednesday in a re-arranged fixture. Borussia Dortmund clawed their way up to third place on goal difference over Moenchengladbach with a 2-2 draw at home to Augsburg with Lars's twin brother Germany midfielder Sven Bender netting for both sides. The Dortmund midfielder gave the hosts the lead at Westfalenstadion after just six minutes, then turned the ball into his own net on 56 minutes for Augsburg's equaliser. Turkey midfielder Nuri Sahin looked to have spared Bender and Borussia's blushes with a brilliant free-kick to make it 2-1 with 20 minutes left.

Hanover took the lead through striker Artjoms Rudnevs, which was cancelled out by Croatia striker Ivica Olic's first half tap-in. A pair of second-half goals by ex-Dortmund midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt sealed the welcome win for Hanover. Nuremberg also celebrated a milestone as they became the last team in a major European league to pick up their first win of the season with a 4-0 victory over Hoffenheim. Likewise, Eintracht Frankfurt picked up their first home win of the season with a shock 1-0 win to move up to 14th against sixth-placed Hertha Berlin.

There was also little for Bender's twin, Lars, to cheer about, even after scoring the first goal in Bayer Leverkusen's shock 3-2 defeat at strugglers Freiburg. Bayer were floored by a 90th minute-winner from Freiburg's Felix Klaus. The result means Bayer stay 10 points adrift of league leaders Bayern Munich.

With their main rivals playing Saturday, Bayern took the chance to extend their lead and can pull further ahead in Stuttgart on Wednesday in a re-arranged fixture. Having suffered a shock 3-0 friendly defeat at Austrian league leaders Red Bull Salzburg last Saturday, Guardiola was delighted to return to winning ways at Borussia Park. ""We took our lessons from the defeat in Salzburg and we played well against an unbelievably good opponent,"" said the 43-year-old. ""It's not easy to win here and we controlled the game.

Striker Mario Mandzukic was left out of the match day squad completely - ""Mario hasn't been training as we know he can,"" explained director of sport Matthias Sammer, preferring Germany star Goetze up front. This was a typical Bayern performance under Guardiola: around 65 percent possession, 24 shots on goal compared to Gladbach's 10, with twice as many passes made and completed as their opponents.

""We're looking forward to the next game."" It seems folly to talk of the Bundesliga title being already decided in January, but Bayern show no signs of dropping points. They have already also won at fourth-placed Borussia Dortmund and drawn at second-placed Bayer Leverkusen. ""Bayern were clearly superior to us over the 90 minutes,"" admitted Germany striker Max Kruse as Gladbach suffered their first home defeat of the season to abruptly end  their eight-match unbeaten run. ""You could see from the start that they wanted to pick up where they left off last year."" The hosts squandered three clear chances to score. Kruse hit the post, Juan Arango forcing Bayern's Manuel Neuer into a good save before the break, then Patrick Herrmann fired wide late on with the goal at his mercy. ""In some situations, perhaps we missed a bit of luck,"" admitted Borussia goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, who has been linked to a move to Barcelona. ""(Bayern goalkeeper) Manuel Neuer was strong in the decisive situations for them. ""It's very different playing against Bayern Munich, they were simply better than we were."" While captain Philipp Lahm was again switched from right-back to defensive midfielder, Bayern ruled in the middle. Thiago Alcantara and Toni Kroos were outstanding alongside Lahm, but Bayern have yet to welcome back a host of midfield stars.

Meanwhile, Dortmund have asked the German Football League (DFL) to change the kick-off time for their home Ruhr Valley derby against Schalke 04 on March 25 be moved from 2030 (local time) to 2000. The thinking is to give security stewards and police a better chance of curbing violence during daylight after rioting broke out before the last derby in Dortmund in October 2012."
1088,23/01/2014,12:56,Football: Bayern's Guardiola demands full gas at Gladbach,Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola has demanded a convincing display over 90 minutes when the off-form Bundesliga leaders take on Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday.,"The European and Club World Cup champions enjoy a seven-point gap at the top of the table, but have only won once on their last six visits to 'Gladbach's Borussia Park. Lucien Favre's 'Gladbach produced a strong display towards the end of 2013 with an eight-match unbeaten run, including six-straight victories, to claim third place from Borussia Dortmund. Guardiola is concerned about Bayern's current form after suffering a shock 3-0 defeat at Austrian league leaders Red Bull Salzburg last Saturday in a friendly with an experimental three-man defence. He has said he wants 90 minutes of quality football after Bayern won December's Club World Cup final in Marrakech despite only convincing in the first half. The Spanish boss wants a passionate display to blow away the cobwebs as the Bundesliga resumes after the four-week winter break as Bayern face three league games in 10 days. ""We have to make sure we have the passion back in our game, many people are telling me how hard it will be in Moenchengladbach,"" said Guardiola. ""We could lose tomorrow, we played well in the final in Marrakech, but only for the first 45 minutes, no more. ""We lost last Saturday because Red Bull Salzburg were better than us, it was a good warning and a good test for us, because it shows what can happen if we aren't in the right head space."" Bayern captain Philipp Lahm did not train with the team on Wednesday, while Guardiola has said Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger will miss out as he recovers still from ankle surgery. A question mark hangs over France winger Franck Ribery, while Dutch forward Arjen Robben should be fit to play having recovered from a badly-cut thigh. ""Franck has had a leg problem in the last few days, I don't know if he will be able to play or not,"" said Guardiola. ""Bastian definitely stays at home, Arjen trained with the squad for the first time on Wednesday and he will be able to play."""
1089,23/01/2014,02:15,Football: Bayern out to deflate rivals' title hopes,Bavarian giants Bayern Munich are out to extend their run-away lead in the Bundesliga at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday to further diminish their rivals' hopes of catching them.,"Bayern are on a record 41-match unbeaten league run and travel to third-placed 'Gladbach with a seven-point lead as the German top flight resumes after the traditional winter break. The Bavarian giants face three league games in ten days as they tackle VfB Stuttgart on Wednesday in a postponed fixture, then host Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday February 2. The aim for the Bavarians now is to produce another eye-catching performance to dispirit the chasing pack. ""We must show the competition that there is nothing to pick up in terms of points,"" said Germany forward Thomas Mueller. ""We mustn't show any weak points and give rise to any hope. ""We can't go half-hearted into these games, the supposedly mighty FC Bayern won't be given any favours."" Bayern's thirst for titles is unsatiable at present having added the Club World Cup in December to August's UEFA Super Cup title after last season's treble of European, league and domestic cup titles. But Pep Guardiola's team were given a wake-up call in a friendly last Saturday when hosts Red Bull Salzburg inflicted a 3-0 defeat on Bayern, which set off a few ""alarm bells"", according to Mueller. ""We need to get out of holiday mode,"" said the 24-year-old as the Bundesliga returns after a four-week break. ""Gladbach will want to take something out of this. ""If an opponent is aggressive and doesn't crap their pants, then we can also have a few problems to deal with."" Gladbach usurped Borussia Dortmund from third place in the league with a strong finish to 2013. Borussia Park has uncomfortable memories for Bayern who lost 3-1 there in January 2012, having also gone to Gladbach as league leaders, and they had to fight back from 3-1 down in May before sealing a 4-3 win. ""It will be a hotly-contested game, if we aren't focused, there will be a result like there was in Salzburg,"" said Bayern's ex-Gladbach defender Dante. Dortmund, who are down to fourth place, need to break a three-match losing streak in the league at home when they host Augsburg on Saturday. Bayern, Leverkusen and Hertha Berlin all enjoyed wins at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion towards the end of the year and coach Jurgen Klopp's side enjoyed a 6-1 friendly drubbing of minnows Duisburg on Tuesday. Klopp will still be without the injured trio of midfielder Ilkay Gundogan (back), plus defenders Mats Hummels (ankle) and Neven Subotic (knee). Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen will also want to bounce back from their 1-0 defeat at Werder Bremen in December when they travel to face third-from-bottom Freiburg on Saturday."

According to the German media Ji will be offered a four year deal by last year's beaten Champions League finalists. Ji, who has 26 international caps, was keen on a return to the Bundesliga to get some playing time in a bid to increase his chances of competing at the 2014 World Cup after appearing only five times since the start of the season for Sunderland. Ji arrived at the Stadium of Light from K-League side Chunnam Dragons in June 2011. He enjoyed a successful loan spell at Augsburg in the second half of last season, scoring five goals in 17 Bundesliga appearances. He is due to have his first run out for Augsburg, ironically against Dortmund, on January 25."
1091,13/01/2014,14:48,Football: Ronaldo tipped to steal Ballon d'Or from Ribery,"Until two months ago, the smart money was on Bayern Munich winger Franck Ribery becoming the fifth Frenchman to lift the Ballon d'Or but now Cristiano Ronaldo looks set to pip him at the death.","The Twittersphere has been going into overdrive amid speculation that for the first time, Ronaldo has brought seven members of his family with him to Monday's ceremony in Zurich, perhaps an indication he knows it will end well for him. Added to that, the 28-year-old's club Real Madrid have suddenly revealed a change to the scheduled programming on their official television channel, with the ceremony now being broadcast live. So after years living in the shadow of Lionel Messi, Ronaldo is expected to finally add to his one previous Ballon d'Or victory in 2008, when his goal in the Champions League final in Moscow helped Manchester United to an eventual penalty shoot-out victory over Premier League rivals Chelsea. Yet should he win as expected, it won't be without controversy. Until November, Ribery appeared the clear favourite following on from a remarkable season in which his Bayern team had won the Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup, before going on to lift the European Supercup and Club World Cup to boot. Yet the original November 15 deadline was extended by FIFA and co-organisers France Football magazine ""on account of an insufficient number of votes having been received"". National team coaches and captains as well as journalists from around the world vote for the winner, with an initial 23-man shortlist being reduced to three last month. The deadline extension has been widely seen as a move designed to help Ronaldo's chances, meaning his World Cup play-off hat-trick against Sweden would be fresh in the minds of those submitting votes beyond the original November 15 cut-off. Whatever the truth in that, there could be no doubt he would be a worthy winner. In a team of superstars, or ""galacticos"" in Madrid, he stands out like a beacon. His 66 goals in 56 games for club and country during 2013 is truly astonishing, despite the fact he and his team-mates won nothing. Both Ribery and Messi achieved more in 2013, with Barca winning the Spanish La Liga while Real lost in the Spanish Cup final to city rivals Atletico Madrid. Neither Messi, the reigning four-time winner of the Ballon d'Or, nor Ronaldo can match Ribery's 2013 trophy haul. The Ballon d'Or has traditionally gone to a player who's enjoyed success on the field, whether with his country, such as Italy World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro's 2006 success, or with his club, as Kaka's victory following AC Milan's Champions League triumph the following year attests to. But while Messi and Ronaldo are the stand-out performers for both their clubs and countries, where Ribery's candidacy is perhaps less credible is the fact that he was one of any number of Bayern players who could have found themselves on the final shortlist. Bayern were by far the best team of 2013 and they really are a collective, built around 11 players of almost equal value. Ribery has perhaps been the most impressive of the lot, but certainly not clearly. Yet a shortlist without a Bayern player would have been a scandal. Ribery winning certainly wouldn't be, but few could doubt that on an individual level, Ronaldo has simply been the best this season. In the coach of the year category, Borussia Dortmund's Jurgen Klopp is up against two greats who retired in 2013. Alex Ferguson bowed out after almost 27 years in charge of Manchester United by winning the Premier League, while clear favourite Jupp Heynckes masterminded Bayern's unprecedented treble last season. Meanwhile, USA star Abby Wambach will look to take the women's award for the second year running, although she faces stiff competition from German goalkeeper Nadine Angerer and Brazilian Marta, who won the FIFA award five times in a row between 2006 and 2010.

Ronaldo himself claims he is not obsessed with the award, although he admits that he has saved a space for it in his recently-opened museum on his native island of Madeira. ""I prefer to not say anything because things don't depend solely on me. I am not obsessed with the Ballon d'Or. We will see what happens,"" he told Spanish radio in November. Ronaldo won nothing with Real Madrid or with Portugal in 2013, but the Ballon d'Or is an individual award and there can be little doubting the individual quality of a player who scored 66 goals in 56 games for club and country in the calendar year. In contrast to Ronaldo, Messi did add to his medal collection in 2013, helping Barcelona reclaim the Spanish league title from Madrid. He was also the top scorer in La Liga with a remarkable 46 goals last season, but it was a frustrating year for the Argentine in many ways, marred by hamstring injuries. In the past, the prize has tended to go to a player who has been part of the year's most successful team, and that is why Ribery was initially fancied to become the first French winner since Zinedine Zidane. The 30-year-old winger starred as Bayern won five trophies in the calendar year - Champions League, Bundesliga, German Cup, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup. UEFA named him as the Best Player in Europe in 2013 and Bayern's sporting director Matthias Sammer believes he deserves to take the prize. ""I think that only he can win.

Dortmund dropped to fourth -- outside the automatic Champions League places -- as Borussia Moenchengladbach drew 2-2 at home to VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday to go eight games unbeaten. ""One must always be grateful and humble in life, these great lads have already written some great stories this year -- today it was different,"" admitted Klopp as the Bundesliga breaks for winter. ""This is a shitty end to 2013."" With the Bundesliga now on a winter break, Dortmund finish the year 12 points behind league leaders Bayern Munich, who have a game in hand. Borussia's current form is a far cry from last season's eye-catching football which carried them through to May's Champions League final where they lost 2-1 to Bayern. Dortmund have suffered five defeats in the first half of the season -- the most in the same period since Klopp took charge five years ago. Having lost at home to Bayern, Bayer Leverkusen and Hertha, Dortmund are already effectively out of the title race. A catalogue of injuries has blighted Klopp of late, especially to his first-choice centre-back pairing of Mats Hummels and Neven Subotic, who is out until May with a torn knee ligament. It has meant 18-year-old Marian Sarr, who made his Dortmund debut in the 2-1 Champions League win at Marseille, has broken into the first team, but it was his mistake which led to Berlin's second goal. After Germany winger Marco Reus gave Dortmund the lead, Colombia striker Adrian Ramos pulled one back, after a mistake from Dortmund left-back Erik Durm, before Hertha took the lead with 45 minutes gone. When Sarr slipped in possession, Tunisia striker Sami Allagui pounced on the error and sprinted around Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller to roll the ball into an empty net to Sarr's dismay.

Leverkusen and Dortmund's defeats means Pep Guardiola's Bayern can go ten points clear if they beat VfB Stuttgart in their catch-up fixture on January 29. Second-placed Leverkusen fell to a late goal at strugglers Werder Bremen, whose Argentinian right-back Santiago Garcia stabbed his shot home to give Bremen a first win in six games. ""It's a bit annoying that we go into the winter break on the back of two defeats,"" said Leverkusen coach Sami Hyypia after Bayer were shocked 1-0 by Eintracht Frankfurt last Sunday.

""We allowed our opponents to get back in the game and didn't take our chances in the second half,"" lamented Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""Hertha got brave and realised there was something to be had after the second goal, while we allowed ourselves to become too hectic."" Borussia took an early lead at home when captain Sebastian Kehl put through a superb ball for Marco Reus and with his first touch, the Germany winger put his shot past 18-year-old Hertha goalkeeper Marius Gersbeck, who was making his Bundesliga debut. But Hertha got back on level terms when striker Adrian Ramos hit his 11th goal of the season after Hertha's Sami Allagui put in a cross for the Colombia forward to convert on 23 minutes. Tunisia forward Allagui then gave Hertha the lead by pouncing on a mistake by Dortmund's teenaged centre-back Marian Sarr, rounding Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller and firing into an empty net on the stroke of half-time. Klopp substituted the clearly distressed Sarr for the start of the second-half, moving left-back Kevin Grosskreutz into centre-back, but his side failed to grab a precious equaliser despite seven minutes of added time. Dortmund stay third but will drop to fourth if Borussia Moenchengladbach pick up at least a point at home to VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday. Nuremberg finish 2013 as the only team in a major European league without a win so far this season after they were held to a goalless draw at home to Schalke 04. The Royal Blues were without coach Jens Keller, who has been told a decision on his future will be made over the winter break, as the 43-year-old was suffering with flu. The point was enough to see Nuremberg stay 17th, leaving Eintracht Braunschweig bottom on goal difference despite their 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Freiburg extended Hanover 96's appalling away record to eight consecutive defeats with a 2-1 win to help the hosts in their bid to escape the bottom three.

1103,20/12/2013,02:30,Football: Rivals out to attack absent Bayern's lead,"With runaway leaders Bayern Munich involved in Saturday's Club World Cup final, their Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen will be aiming to trim the Bavarians' lead.","Munich hold a seven-point lead at the top of the table and are threatening to again run off with the title, unless their rivals can steal a march with Bayern in Morocco. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen face Werder Bremen away on Saturday with the hosts winless in their last five games. ""It won't be easy for us but we want to make a good impression in our last match before the winter break and take all three points,"" said Bayer coach Sami Hyypia. Leverkusen can set a new club record of 40 points for the first half of the season with a win at Bremen on what will be the final Bundesliga weekend of 2013. But Bayer slumped to a shock defeat at the hands of strugglers Eintracht Frankfurt last weekend and Bremen plan to follow suit. ""Bayer 04 have been in the leading pack for years but we've got a chance in front of our own fans,"" said Bremen midfielder Clemens Fritz. ""Frankfurt showed the way. Football is always capable of springing a surprise."" Werder coach Robin Dutt was so furious after his side's 3-2 defeat at Hertha Berlin last weekend that he sent the squad for a 4am gym session on their return to Bremen. Dutt is waiting on the fitness of captain Aaron Hunt as the veteran midfielder struggles with a calf injury. ""There is a big question mark against him, he would be a big loss,"" said Dutt. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund, who are 12 points behind Bayern and five adrift of Leverkusen, host Hertha Berlin looking for only their second league win in five games. Four points from those five matches has been a poor return and coach Jurgen Klopp is hoping to get some of his stars off the injured list to try to turn things around. Germany left-back Marcel Schmelzer could feature after a calf tear but it is still too early for defensive midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, who has at least trained with the squad this week. The 23-year-old has not played since injuring his back in Germany's friendly draw against Paraguay in August. And Klopp is also without both centre-backs Neven Subotic and Mats Hummels. Yet rather than looking forward to seeing the back of 2013, he remains eager to get their title challenge back on track. ""I'm not ready yet for Christmas,"" he said. ""We have had a great week of training and we could get down to some good work. The team are up for it."" Nuremberg host Schalke 04 on Saturday evening still looking for their first win of the season -- the only team in Europe's major leagues without a victory so far. Should Dortmund falter against Berlin, fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach can usurp them from third when they host VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday. Gladbach are unbeaten in their last seven games and enjoyed a six-match winning streak before being held to a goalless draw at Mainz last Saturday."

The 25-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and has been repeatedly linked to a move to European champions Bayern. The Poland striker is set to make an announcement about his future in January, when he is expected to confirm his move to Munich for next season. With 11 goals in 16 league games this season, Lewandowski says he is frustrated by Dortmund's lack of Bundesliga form with Borussia third and 12 points behind leaders Bayern Munich in the table after three defeats in their last five games. ""We all know we need to start winning again,"" he said. ""We want to start against Hertha Berlin (on Saturday in the Bundesliga). ""We must really get going in the second part of the season and reduce the gap behind Leverkusen and Bayern. We are not allowed to drop any more points. ""Despite my 11 goals, I could have scored many more. ""That's why I am not satisfied. But that's not only my problem -- that applies to the whole team. ""We did not drop that many points because we played badly but because we were too wasteful in front of goal. That's annoying."""

1108,16/12/2013,10:54,Football: Record-breaking Bayern dominate in 2013,European champions Bayern Munich begin the quest for their first Club World Cup title on Tuesday having dominated German football in 2013 and finished the year unbeaten in the Bundesliga.,"The Bavarian giants' 3-1 win at home to Hamburg on Saturday means they finish with a new record 93 Bundesliga points for a calendar year and were unbeaten in the German league in 2013. The victory also extended the Champions League winners' unbeaten record in the Bundesliga to 41 games, dating back to October 2012. They launch their Club World Cup campaign in Morocco against China's Asian champions Guangzhou Evergrande FC in Tuesday's semi-finals for a place in Saturday's final. ""2013 has been an unbelievable year for FC Bayern, now we fly to Morocco and try to win our next title,"" said coach Pep Guardiola. Despite losing 3-2 at home to Manchester City last Tuesday, Bayern still finished top of their group to progress to the last 16 of the Champions League as they look to defend the title they won at Wembley in May. The Bavarians run to the 2013 final included a 7-0 drubbing of Barcelona on aggregate in the semi-finals as Bayern became the first German side to win the treble of European, league and cup titles under Jupp Heynckes. Under Heynckes, Bayern set 25 Bundesliga records including the most points (91) and fewest goals conceded (18 over the 34 matches) and show no sign on faltering under new boss Guardiola. Having returned from his year-long sabbatical in New York after winning 14 titles in four years at Barcelona, Guardiola took charge of Bayern in June. Midfielders Thiago Alcantara and Mario Goetze were added to their star-studded squad for this season as Guardiola has brought his own version of Barcelona's tiki-taka football to Bavaria. Bayern now enjoy around 75 percent possession in most league games and humbled Werder Bremen 7-0 in north Germany ten days ago. Guardiola picked up his first title with Bayern in August's UEFA Super Cup when Chelsea were beaten in Prague as the Spaniard enjoyed his eighth win in 16 matches against his rival Jose Mourinho, the former Real Madrid manager. The Bavarians extracted penalty shoot-out revenge after Chelsea had beaten them on spot-kicks to lift the 2012 Champions League title at Munich's Allianz Arena. With the holders through to the German Cup quarter-finals and having reached the Champions League's knock-out stage, Bayern are on course to defend all three titles they won last season. Guardiola has yet to have his full squad available with the likes of stars Javi Martinez, Thiago, Goetze, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben having all spent time on the sidelines recovering from injuries. Having beaten Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund 2-1 at Wembley in May's first all-German Champions League final, the Germans are again flying the flag in Europe with another first. After Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke joined Munich in qualifying for the knock-out phase, Germany will have four teams in the Champions League's knock-out stages for the first time in 2014. At international level, Germany have drawn Portugal, Ghana and the United States Group G at Brazil 2014 with the Germans amongst the favourites to claim their fourth World Cup title having finished third in at South Africa 2010. The Germans' attacking prowess is undeniable with the likes of Goezte alongside Arsenal's Mesut Ozil, Bayern's Thomas Mueller and Dortmund's Marco Reus. But their defence, traditionally Germany's strength, has repeatedly come under fire in 2013. A weakened Germany crashed to a 4-3 defeat to the USA, coached by ex-Germany boss Jurgen Klinsmann, in Washington in June, then fought back from 2-0 down for a 3-3 draw at home to lowly Paraguay in August. The Germans rounded up their Brazil 2014 qualifying campaign with a 5-3 win over Sweden in Stockholm to finish with nine wins from ten games, the 4-4 draw with Sweden in Berlin in October 2012 being the only blot."

Bayern bounced back on their return to league duty at the Allianz Arena with goals by Mario Mandzukic and Mario Goetze before Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri added the third deep into added time. Bayern surrendered their 10-match record Champions League winning run to City, but victory over Bert van Marwijk's Hamburg extended their record unbeaten run in the Bundesliga to 41 matches. Despite starting with France winger Franck Ribery and left-back David Alaba on the bench, while captain Philipp Lahm and star midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger are injured, Bayern still started with 10 internationals. Alaba's replacement Diego Contento was the only uncapped player in the Bayern side. Mandzukic put the Bavarians ahead with his tenth goal of the season with 42 minutes gone when he headed home Rafinha's superbly volleyed cross after a long ball from Toni Kroos. Goetze added the second when he hit the top left corner with 52 minutes on the clock before making way for Ribery. Hamburg striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga celebrated his 22nd birthday on Sunday with Hamburg's consolation goal on 87 minutes when he crashed his shot past Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Shaqiri came off the bench to add a third just before the final whistle to get Pep Guardiola's Bayern back to winning ways. Having needed a dramatic late goal to beat Marseille on Wednesday to confirm their Champions League progress, Dortmund had to fight back from two-goals down to draw 2-2 at Hoffenheim to hold onto third place. Striker Sven Schipplock and right-winger Kevin Volland gave Hoffenheim a shock 2-0 lead before Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gave Borussia hope when he hit his ninth goal of the season just before the break. Poland right-back Lukasz Piszczek scored his first goal of the season to equalise when stabbed home a rebound after a curling Nuri Sahin cross. The point was enough for Dortmund to hold onto third place as they sit level on 32 points with fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach, who were held to a goalless draw at Mainz 05. Nuremberg keep the tag of being the only team in a major European league without a win when they drew 3-3 at Hanover 96 as the hosts fought back with three goals in the final half an hour. Senegal striker Mame Diouf scored Hanover's dramatic equaliser in the dying stages, with more than a hint of offside, to leave Nuremberg furious and second from bottom in the table. Eintracht Braunschweig remained bolted to the bottom of the league when they went down 4-1 at Augsburg while on Friday, Werder Bremen crashed to a 3-2 defeat at Hertha Berlin, their fourth in five games."

""All four German clubs in the last 16, that has never happened before. Our league can celebrate a historic triumph!"" wrote German daily Bild. On three occasions three German teams, Dortmund, Schalke and Bayern, have reached the last 16 in 1997-98, 2004-05 and 2012-13, but this is the first time since the Champions League started in 1992 that four German teams have reached the knock-out phase. The Germans have the joint biggest contingent in the knock-out stages alongside English quartet Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, while three Spanish teams, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid are also through. On Wednesday, Dortmund needed a dramatic late goal from Kevin Grosskreutz to seal a 2-1 win at Marseille to finish as winners of Group F and had been just three minutes from going out of the competition after Napoli's 2-0 win at home to Arsenal. Pep Guardiola's Bayern also went through as group winners, despite losing 3-2 at home to Manchester City on Tuesday, winning five of their six matches. Schalke finished second in Group E after a 2-0 win at home to Swiss champions FC Basel, while Bayer Leverkusen were second in Group A behind Manchester United. ""It is very positive, especially in the way the sides went through,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""It shows the quality that Germany can offer."" The draw for the last 16 of the Champions League will be held at 1100 (GMT) in Nyon, Switzerland, on Monday. In total, the German quartet have picked up 93.55 million euros (US$129m) in prize money. Defending champions Bayern lead the way with 28.76 million euros for appearance and prize money followed by Dortmund with 24.85m, Leverkusen on 21.43m and Schalke 18.51m. For winning last season's Champions League title, Bayern picked up 55.05m euros."
1111,12/12/2013,01:44,Football: German game reaps reward of revamp - DFB coach,"European football giants Germany have not won an international trophy since Euro 1996, but a carefully crafted strategy to develop young stars is paying dividends says respected coach Frank Wormuth.","The German game is enjoying a purple patch at club level with the re-emergence of a strong Bayern Munich, who defeated compatriots Borussia Dortmund to win the Champions League last May. With the 2014 World Cup looming, Wormuth says Germany is preparing to reap a rich harvest after a decade of planning involving the bottom-up revamping of the national game. Wormuth suggested that some of Germany's rivals -- he named England as a prime example -- are by contrast losing ground. ""We have been patient, whereas in England the league do not like to be told what to do by the federation. They are not on the same wavelength,"" Wormuth told AFP. ""Maybe we are missing a little Brazilian pizzazz -- but we Germans are very structured. We looked at our recent record and said, 'this can't go on.'"" After three World Cup titles -- the last in 1990 -- and three European championships ""we were having no more success. We lacked a pool of young emerging talents, new coaches. ""So we changed things around -- we have been working from the grassroots up to the top,"" Wormuth said Wednesday at a meeting of the Footecon football trade fair in Rio. Wormuth, under-20 coach with the German Football Federation (DFB), says former Germany coach Jurgen Klinsmann made a conscious decision ahead of the 2006 World Cup to overhaul old methods which had grown stale, building on early work instigated from 1999 by then-Bayer Leverkusen general manager Rainer Calmund and DFB Director of Youth Development Dietrich Weise. That involved the creation of a huge network nationwide of talent centres with DFB-salaried coaches hunting down raw talent at youth level and nurturing the players as they moved up the age scale to the brink of the professional game. ""We can thank Klinsmann as he sowed some of the seeds that are now blossoming,"" said Wormuth, whose brief playing career at the second division level included a spell playing alongside current Germany coach Joachim Loew at Freiburg. Wormuth proudly pointed to the emergence of several current stars from a system which now runs the rule over as many as 600,000 youngsters each year. Bayern and Germany star Thomas Muller is one, another is Chelsea newcomer Andre Schurrle, whom the Londoners signed from Bayer Leverkusen earlier this year. Wormuth said that after Euro 1996, as old stars passed their sell-by dates, many figures in the game did not want to accept the need for wholesale overhaul, but ""after the results started to appear they began to accept it"" and young coaches such as Dortmund's Jurgen Klopp began making a name for themselves. ""Our goal in Germany is straightforward -- talent must not be allowed to fall through the net. It must be nurtured,"" Wormuth said. Although German football has invested around 100 million euros in the system, he says the net cost should be much lower. ""You send a scout (to a youth game) and when the talent emerges the clubs ultimately can make money on their investment. (German) stadiums are full, so money is coming in."" A further positive by-product is that the proportion of young homegrown talents in the Bundesliga far exceeds that of the foreigner-dominated English Premier League. At the last World Cup in South Africa, 19 of Germany's 23-man squad had come through club youth academies. They finished third, beating Uruguay in the third-place playoff after falling to eventual champions Spain in the semi-finals. ""Now to our next goal,"" Wormuth said. ""We want that fourth (World Cup) star on our shirts!"""
1112,11/12/2013,23:39,Football: Schalke down 10-man Basel to reach last 16,Schalke confirmed their place in the Champions League knockout phase with a 2-0 home win against 10-man FC Basel on Wednesday to finish second behind Chelsea in Group E.,"Goals after the break by Germany's Julian Draxler and a strange second from Cameroon midfielder Joel Matip put Schalke in the last 16 to ease the pressure on under-fire coach Jens Keller. The 43-year-old has been told a decision on his future will be made over the winter break in the wake of the Royal Blues' erratic form this season. Having been knocked out of the German Cup last week and trailing leaders Bayern Munich by 17 points in the Bundesliga, Keller would have been set for dismissal after a year in charge had Schalke failed to go through. Schalke's successful qualification will see them earn 4.5 million euros (US$6.2m). ""No one can understand the pressure the team and I were under,"" said Keller. ""The joy in winning a game like that is huge. ""No one had given us any credit. ""The fact we have reached the knock-out phase is hugely important for the club, especially financially."" The win comes at a cost for Schalke as both Draxler and captain Benedikt Hoewedes face spells on the sidelines having suffered torn leg ligaments. The Royal Blues had to win to go through and faced 10 men for an hour as FC Basel had centre-back Ivan Ivanov, who cleared an early shot off the line, sent off for holding back Schalke's Adam Szalai on 31 minutes. Hoewedes was lucky not to be shown a red card, instead of the yellow he received, on 29 minutes, as he injured himself with a rugby-style tackle on Basel captain Marco Streller, who would have been clear on goal. The breakthrough Schalke desperately needed came on 50 minutes when Farfan swung in a cross and found Draxler unmarked at the far post to slam home his shot and give the Royal Blues the lead. Schalke secured their passage to the knockout phase seven minutes later when their second goal arrived in bizarre fashion. Replays showed that five Schalke players were offside as the ball came into the box from a Farfan free-kick, but the assistant referee did not raise his flag and Matip was left alone to slot past Basel goalkeeper Yann Sommer. ""I had my eyes on the linesman, who didn't react. I was suprised by that,"" admitted Matip. Basel coach Murat Yakin was left protesting incredulously on the sidelines, but the defeat means the Swiss champions finish third in the group and drop into the Europa League. ""We started the game well, our passing was good, we kept calm and had a lot of possession,"" said Yakin after the final whistle. ""Unfortunately, we then had a player sent off, which unbalanced the team."" After reigning champions Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen qualified on Tuesday, Schalke joined last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund in progressing to the last 16 on Wednesday as all four Bundesliga sides reached the knockout phase."

Marseille, meanwhile, end with the unenviable record of being the first French team to finish a group-stage campaign without any points. ""It was a great feeling to get the winning goal and put us through as group winners,"" said Grosskreutz. ""It was amazing to celebrate the goals with the fans, we deserved to go through. ""We had lots of chances, but stayed patient and got our reward. I can't wait to get in the dressing room and soak up the atmosphere, there might be a few beers drunk as well,"" added the 25-year-old. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp said that he was getting very nervous towards the end as he felt the team were rushing things too much. ""We did everything right and then at the end, we did everything wrong,"" said Klopp. ""We didn't finish so many chances and missed a couple of clear chances. ""But it's an awesome feeling. There was one or two harsh words said during the break, but they don't matter, it was just about pushing the team on."" Dortmund caught the Marseille defence napping as early as the fourth minute as Marco Reus found Robert Lewandowski, who turned Lucas Mendes before rifling the ball past Steve Mandanda. Mendes ended up needing treatment for a bloody cut after Mandanda's boot caught him full in the face as they both came to ground. However, a mad rush of blood to the head by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller in the 14th minute gifted Marseille an equaliser, as he came charging out to collect a lofted free-kick only to miss it completely. Saber Khalifa headed against the bar but Souleymane Diawara was on hand to head into the empty net, although he looked to be in an offside position. Dortmund -- who were forced to hand fourth-choice centre-back Marian Sarr, 18, his senior debut -- got a huge boost in the 34th minute when referee Marijo Strahonja sent winger Dimitri Payet off for a second bookable offence when he dived in the penalty area. Payet was furious and demonstrated his displeasure in dramatic fashion by kicking the corner flag before going down the tunnel, breaking it in half. Dortmund failed to get the breakthrough in the remaining minutes of the first half but should have done so in the first minute of the second period -- Nuri Sahin breaking the Marseille offside trap but placing his low cross behind the onrushing Lewandowski. Somehow Marseille held out with a mix of some last ditch defending - Mandanda pulling off one excellent save -- and poor Dortmund finishing typified by Lewandowski, who nipped in to seize on a poor back-pass and rounded Mandanda only to shoot into the side-netting. Substitute Jonas Hofmann also blazed over when only five yards out as Dortmund turned the screw further but without reward. However, with the news coming through that Napoli were 2-0 up over Arsenal in Italy, Dortmund threw everything at the French side with the minutes dwindling away and they finally cracked with three minutes left. It was the outstanding Grosskreutz - who has a tattoo of the Dortmund skyline on his back -- that slotted home the decisive goal, actually slipping as he took aim, but he had enough force on his shot to beat Mandanda, who managed to get a hand to it but to no avail."
1114,11/12/2013,23:35,Football: Arsenal through to last 16 as Napoli miss out,"Arsenal qualified for the last 16 of the Champions League despite losing 2-0 away to Napoli on Wednesday, while the Italian side agonisingly miss out.","Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon both scored in the second half either side of Mikel Arteta's sending-off, but Borussia Dortmund's dramatic late 2-1 win in Marseille saw them go through as winners of Group F ahead of Arsenal and pushed Napoli into third place. The Premier League leaders did just enough in the heated atmosphere of the San Paolo stadium, with Napoli needing to win by three goals to be certain of qualifying, and Arsene Wenger's side can look forward to playing in the Champions League knockout stages for the 14th year in succession. Napoli, meanwhile, miss out on a place in the last 16 as the losers in a three-way tie at the top of a remarkably competitive group, and will have to settle for the consolation of Europa League football in the New Year. It was a sore one for Rafael Benitez's side, and another blow for the prestige of Italian football after Juventus were eliminated earlier in the day. ""We prepared well and were well focused, but we dropped physically in the second half,"" Wenger told Sky Sports television after the game. ""Napoli played well tonight, but in the end we got through. The most difficult thing in football is when you are in between attacking and defending. ""Maybe Napoli played a little bit with the handbrake on when they led 1-0 because they thought they were through."" Beaten 2-0 by Arsenal in London in October, Napoli had to win by three clear goals to be sure of progressing and their task was not helped by the absence of both Slovakian creator Marek Hamsik and goalkeeper Pepe Reina. Brazilian Rafael Cabral made his Champions League debut in place of Reina, as Napoli, whose recent form has been patchy, looked to keep a clean sheet for the first time in nine outings. The hosts knew they had to attack and they started with intent. However, their only attempt of any real note in the opening stages was a Goran Pandev shot that was blocked by visiting goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. Callejon curled an effort over the bar before Szczesny was let off the hook when he casually tried to chip clear from a Laurent Koscielny back-pass. Higuain intervened but, luckily for the Pole, he headed wide. Arsenal sat back and controlled the game well in the opening period, breaking up play and frustrating their hosts. They only created one chance of note but it was the best one of the first half, Olivier Giroud forcing a good save from Rafael after latching onto Mathieu Flamini's pass inside the area. Napoli continued to press in the second half but their attacks lacked conviction, with Pablo Armero tearing forward down the left and cutting into the box only to see his shot easily saved. But their persistence finally brought its reward with 73 minutes played when Higuain scored for the fourth time in this season's competition. The Argentine exchanged passes with fellow former Real Madrid man Callejon on the edge of the box before turning and shooting low past Szczesny as the San Paolo erupted. Napoli's hopes were given a further boost three minutes later when Arsenal's skipper for the night Arteta was shown a second yellow card by Hungarian referee Viktor Kassai for catching Callejon. At that point Napoli were going through but, as the game drifted into the 90th minute, news filtered through that Borussia Dortmund had scored in France, leaving Rafael Benitez's side having to score two more goals to progress. They got one, substitute Lorenzo Insigne playing in Callejon, who lobbed over the outrushing Szczesny and into the net, but that came with the last kick of the match and Napoli's efforts were ultimately in vain."

Having been knocked out of the German Cup last week and trailing leaders Bayern Munich by 17 points in the Bundesliga, Keller would have been set for dismissal after a year in charge had Schalke failed to go through. ""We knew what was at stake,"" said Matip. ""This victory was also for our coach, it's a difficult time for him right now. ""We want to continue working hard and try to be more consistent with our performances."" The Royal Blues had to win to go through, and they faced 10 men for just under an hour as FC Basel had centre-back Ivan Ivanov, who cleared an early shot off the line, sent off for holding back Schalke's Adam Szalai on 31 minutes. The Hungarian striker had only just replaced captain Benedikt Hoewedes, who went off with a hamstring injury just approaching the half-hour mark. Hoewedes was lucky not to be shown a red card, instead of the yellow he received, on 29 minutes, as he injured himself with a rugby-style tackle on Basel captain Marco Streller, who would have been clear on goal. Schalke had the best chance of the first half though, as Jefferson Farfan's cross was cleared onto the crossbar by Basel defender Taulant Xhaka on 12 minutes. The ball fell to Draxler, who squared it to 18-year-old Max Meyer, but his shot was cleared off the line by Ivanov. The breakthrough Schalke desperately needed came on 50 minutes when Farfan swung in a cross and found Draxler unmarked at the far post to slam home his shot and give the Royal Blues the lead. Schalke secured their passage to the knockout phase seven minutes later when their second goal arrived in bizarre fashion. Replays showed that five Schalke players were offside as the ball came into the box from a Farfan free-kick, but the assistant referee did not raise his flag and Matip was left alone to slot past Basel goalkeeper Yann Sommer. ""I had my eyes on the linesman, who didn't react. I was suprised by that,"" admitted Matip.

1118,11/12/2013,16:35,"Football: City punished Bayern's complacency, says Mueller","Midfielder Thomas Mueller has admitted Bayern Munich were punished for their complacency in their shock 3-2 defeat by Manchester City, who proved the Champions League winners are not unbeatable.","Bayern suffered their first defeat under Pep Guardiola since losing the German Super Cup final to Borussia Dortmund in July as their record 10-match winning streak in Europe was brought to an abrupt halt. Having raced into a two-goal lead after 11 minutes at Munich's Allianz Arena with goals by Mueller and Mario Goetze, Bayern allowed City to fight back on Tuesday in their final group game. David Silva and stand-in captain Aleksandar Kolarov both scored before winger James Milner capped an outstanding display to hit the winner with a superb curling shot to complete the miraculous fight-back. ""The human-factor came out in us and we played too carelessly,"" admitted Mueller, as Bayern progressed to the last 16 as Group D winners despite the defeat after winning five of their six games. ""Everyone ran too little after we went 2-0 up. ""It's not like we missed chance after chance, but we weren't able to compensate for the two goals they scored. ""After such a strong start, we had imagined the game would have gone differently. ""We have a lot of self-confidence at the moment and after we went 2-0 up, you thought 'what could possibly go wrong now?' ""We lost 3-2, so that was the best of our possible worst case scenarios."" City would have finished as group winners with a 4-2 victory and Mueller said keeping hold of possession had been his priority in the dying minutes to avoid conceding a crucial fourth goal. ""That's why I dribbled towards the corner flag in the 87th minute to keep the ball,"" said the Germany star. ""But I was left wondering about the rest of the side when our entire team were in the Manchester penalty area two minutes later, so I don't know if the others were aware. ""We never go into a game expecting to lose 3-2, especially not at home. ""Sure, Manchester are good for a goal or two, that's no secret. ""But we let things slip after a good start. The absolute will to win was missing."" Bayern have had their Champions League record run ended, but they can add to their 40-match unbeaten streak in the Bundesliga on Saturday when they host Hamburg, who they also face in February's German Cup quarter-finals."
1119,10/12/2013,02:25,Football: Destiny in Dortmund's hands for Marseille decider,Borussia Dortmund can keep alive their bid to return to the Champions League final for the second straight season with victory over Marseille at the Velodrome on Wednesday.,"The Bundesliga side will reach the knockout stages next February by taking maximum points regardless of what happens in the second Group H fixture between Napoli and Arsenal in Italy. Napoli, who are on nine points with Dortmund and three behind Arsenal, must beat the Premier League pacesetters by three clear goals, should Dortmund also win in France. However it will be the German club who go through with Rafa Benitez's team due to their superior head-to-head record against both clubs. Arsenal will go through with a draw or a defeat by two goals or less. Marseille meanwhile are in turmoil, and fired coach Elie Baup following their 1-0 home defeat against Nantes on Friday, replacing him with Jose Anigo. They cannot even dream of the consolation of Europa League football in the New Year as they are pointless following five straight defeats. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp looked on as his side suffered their fourth league defeat of the season on Saturday when they slumped 1-0 at home to second-placed Bayer Leverkusen but the price was heavier than just three points. Germany midfielder Sven Bender is ruled out after limping off with an ankle injury while Turkey international Nuri Sahin is doubtful after slightly tearing an ankle ligament. ""We lost 1-0, but that's actually the least of our problems,"" Klopp said following the match. Dortmund are already withouth midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, defender Mats Hummels, Neven Subotic and Marcel Schmelzer as Klopp's injury worries show no sign of easing. He is also down to his fourth choice at centre-back, having played Bender out of position in the 3-1 win over Napoli on matchday five, as Manuel Friedrich is cup-tied and Hummels injured. ""We now find ourselves in the situation where we are constantly having to react,"" said Klopp. ""But necessity is the mother of invention, so we'll see what happens. ""We have certainly had easier moments, but we have to fight on."" Caretaker manager Anigo takes charge of his first match back at the helm of Marseille after a four year spell between 2001 and 2005, preceded before then as sporting director. The club, who are fifth in Ligue 1 and 13 points back of Paris Saint-Germain, parted ways with Baup following their sixth league defeat of the season on Friday."
1120,10/12/2013,02:05,Football: Former winners Milan and Dortmund look to reach Last 16,Former champions AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund go into their final group matches needing a result in their respective games to ensure they continue their campaign for the trophy in the New Year.,"Group E Schalke 04 (GER) v FC Basel (SUI) Schalke and Basel really have everything to play for in a decisive outing for the German and Swiss sides. Basel are currently on eight points, one behind already-qualified Chelsea and one ahead of Schalke, meaning they could still finish atop the group should they win and Chelsea be held to a draw or lose. Schalke have to go for the victory to ensure they edge the Swiss out of the second qualifying spot in the group. One bad omen for Basel is that the last time they travelled to face German opposition, they suffered a 7-0 hammering at the hands of Bayern Munich in the 2012 round of 16 second leg. Chelsea (ENG) v Steaua Bucharest (ROM) Chelsea have already qualified for the knock-out stages, but still need to beat the Romanians to guarantee pole position in Group E. Beaten 3-2 by Stoke in English Premier League action on the weekend, the west London side have now conceded six goals in their last two games. Coach Jose Mourinho reacted by giving his players a rare day off after the Stoke defeat, saying it would be ""good for their heads"". Steaua are yet to register a victory in Group E, having notched up three draws and two defeats in their five games. In fact the Romanians last won in Champions League action way back in September 2006, against Dynamo Kiev, a 22-game winless streak equalling that of Spartak Moscow (December 2000-November 2006). Group F Napoli (ITA) v Arsenal (ENG) Arsene Wenger's Arsenal will clinch qualification, and top spot, with a draw or a victory in Naples. The Premier League table-toppers will also go through with a defeat by two goals or less. Wenger's side enjoy a good record in Italy and with 12 points, are three ahead of Borussia Dortmund and Rafa Benitez's Napoli. The Italian side must beat Arsenal by three clear goals, should Dortmund also win their match against Marseille - who are yet to pick up a point from five losses in five matches. Marseille (FRA) v Borussia Dortmund (GER) Victory for Jurgen Klopp's Borussia Dortmund over Marseille will keep their hopes alive of a return to the Champions League final for the second straight season. The Bundesliga side will reach the knockout stages by taking maximum points regardless of what happens between Napoli and Arsenal in Italy. Should Dortmund draw, they will progress if Napoli do not win. Dortmund suffered their fourth league defeat of the season on the weekend, a 1-0 loss at home to second-placed Bayer Leverkusen, with Germany midfielder Sven Bender now ruled out of the Marseille game and Turkey international Nuri Sahin a doubt. The winless French club go into the match in disarray, coach Elie Baup replaced last week by long-time Marseille employee Jose Anigo. Group G Austria Vienna (AUT) v Zenit St Petersburg (RUS) The Austrian outfit will be bidding to bow out of the group stage with a face saving first win. However, the Russian side are sure to go for the victory that would ensure they progress even if Porto beat group winners Atletico Madrid in Spain. The hosts, though, are far from sure performers at home losing three European matches in a row already an unwanted team record. Zenit -- who despite being down to 10 men drew 0-0 in the home clash with Austria Vienna -- are effective away from home and have won three of their four away games in this season's competition. Zenit's Belgian centreback Nicolas Lombaerts told uefa.com that he believes the Russians are yet to show their best form. ""We are motivated because we did not manage to qualify last season. I think we gave it away, we gave away points,"" he said. ""It is in our own hands now. It would be a shame if we give it away again. We have to give 100% for one more game and then we should be able to achieve it."" Atletico Madrid (ESP) v Porto (POR) The Spanish side have sailed serenely through qualifying and are guaranteed top spot even before hosting former champions Porto. In a delightful twist of fate Atletico can consign Porto to the Europa League just as the Portuguese side did to them in the 2008/09 campaign and the 2009/10 season to boot. Atletico beat Porto 2-1 in Portugal in their first meeting this season and are likely to repeat the dose again and confirm their status as a danger to the more established sides for the trophy this term. Group H AC Milan (ITA) v Ajax (NED) Milan have had a pretty underwhelming season thusfar and failure to get the draw they need at home to Ajax and secure their place in the Last 16 would all but certainly signal the exit of coach Massimiliano Allegri. For the second consecutive season Milan's run-in to Christmas is anything but festive: they currently sit ninth in Serie A, 22 points behind leaders Juventus and 14 adrift of the first Champions League qualifying spot. They will be looking to Mario Balotelli to be on form both physically and mentally against an Ajax side that despite their deserved 2-1 win at home to Barcelona in the previous round of matches has a woeful away record in the competition having not won on their last six trips abroad. Barcelona (ESP) v Celtic (SCO) The Catalan giants require a point against the Scottish champions to ensure they finish top of the group. Barca will again be without the injured Lionel Messi, Victor Valdes and Dani Alves, but Jordi Alba -- who scored an injury time minute winner when the two sides met at the Camp Nou last season -- returned in the Cup win last Friday against Cartagena after three months out and is expected to start. Celtic have nothing but pride to play for as not even a win would get them Europa League football in the New Year."
1121,09/12/2013,02:05,Football: Now-or-never for Champions League last-16 hopefuls,"Holders Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Barcelona are already through to the Champions League round of 16.","Eight other places are up for grabs when the groups end on Tuesday and Wednesday. AFP Sports looks at what's at stake on Tuesday: Group A Manchester United (ENG) v Shakhtar Donetsk (UKR) Smarting from their fifth Premier League defeat of the season, already qualified Manchester United host Shakhtar seeking some much needed European solace. United's second successive home defeat, a 1-0 reverse to Newcastle on Saturday, has taken much of the gloss off their superb 5-0 rout of Borussia Dortmund a fortnight ago, a demolition which sealed their passage to the knockout stages. David Moyes will want a quick and sharp response from his team which he said had lacked sparkle against Newcastle, a loss which left the Premier League titleholders 13 points off leaders Arsenal. A draw is essential to take Group A honours and give United a much needed boost ahead of the crammed Christmas domestic programme. Shakhtar, in buoyant form at home -- they lead their league by five points -- must match Bayer Leverkusen's result to qualify. Victory for the Ukrainians would deprive Moyes' men of top spot. United are boosted by the return of Wayne Rooney, suspended for Saturday's game. Real Sociedad (ESP) v Bayer Leverkusen (GER) Leverkusen will qualify for the last 16 at the expense of Shakhtar as long as they see off winless Real and the Ukrainians lose at Old Trafford. A draw will be enough for Leverkusen if Shakhtar lose thanks to their superior head-to-head. Leverkusen have painful memories of their last trip to Spain, a 7-1 drubbing at Barcelona in the 2011/2012 round of 16 -- their heaviest ever European defeat. Bayer go into the tie on the back of a hard fought 1-0 win over Borussia Dortmund to leave them four points shy of Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich. Group B Galatasaray (TUR) v Juventus (ITA) A draw would be enough to see Juventus through to the knock-out stages, given their better head-to-head record against Copenhagen than Galatasaray's, but even a draw is a tall order in the Istanbul cauldron the Turks call home. It is made even more so by the fact that the Turin club were dealt a severe blow with the news that influential playmaker Andrea Pirlo will miss what is their most important test of the season so far with knee ligament damage, which is expected to sideline him until the New Year -- by which time Juve's Champions League campaign could be a fading memory. FC Copenhagen (DEN)v Real Madrid (ESP) Copenhagen have only pride left to play for as even an unlikely victory over Real would leave them in third place in the group and out of the competition. Real, on the other hand, have cruised through their campaign so far, scoring at will, most recently with the 4-1 drubbing of Galatasaray which, ironically, rekindled rivals Juventus' hopes of progressing. Despite being already qualified, coach Carlo Ancelotti is expected to line out with stars Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo. Group C Benfica (POR) v Paris Saint Germain (FRA) The hosts have more to play for than the visitors, who are already assured of being group winners. Benfica, though, must better the result of Greek side Olympiakos if they are to reach the last-16. Benfica do have a bit of a hold over the French visitors in that they have beaten them in Lisbon on the last two occasions they have played there. Much could depend on what sort of side PSG coach Laurent Blanc selects, whether he opts to rest several first team regulars or throws them all in as they seek to better their overall points haul of 15 -- they presently have 13 -- from last year's group stage. Lisbon is hosting the Champions League final but it is unlikely that Benfica will emulate Bayern Munich in appearing in a final on home turf given their qualification is out of their hands. Olympiakos (GRE) v Anderlecht (BEL) The Greek side should logically seal their place in the knockout stages at home to a Belgian outfit which has garnered just one point from their five games -- albeit a draw with PSG -- and whom the hosts trounced 3-0 in Belgium with Kostas Mitroglou scoring a hat-trick. Coached by former Spanish great Michel, who was part of the Real Madrid team that overturned a 3-0 deficit in a UEFA Cup second round clash in the 1984/85 campaign to win 6-1 in the return leg, Olympiakos are bidding to reach the Last 16 for the first time since 2009/10. Anderlecht will finish bottom of their group for the seventh successive season they have competed in the competition. Group D Bayern Munich (GER) v Manchester City (ENG) Defending champions Bayern, buoyed by a 7-0 demolition of Werder Bremen on Saturday which extended their unbeaten Bundesliga run to 40 matches, are already through to the last-16. They will win the group with a draw or with a defeat that is no bigger than their 3-1 away victory in Manchester in the teams' first game. Bayern have won 14 of their last 16 home Champions League fixtures, most recently a 5-0 success against Victoria Pilsen on matchday three while their 3-1 win at CSKA Moscow a fortnight ago broke Barcelona's record for consecutive wins with their tenth straight victory. City coach Manuel Pellegrini is hoping to have Spanish playmaker David Silva back from injury. The Spanish attacking midfielder has missed City's last five matches due to a calf injury. Germany captain Philipp Lahm could return for Bayern having missed the last few weeks with a hamstring injury, but Bayern are definitely without winger Arjen Robben who has a thigh problem. Viktoria Pilsen (CZE) v CSKA Moscow (RUS) Neither side can make the last-16, leaving a battle to finish third and claim a spot in the Europa League knockout rounds. The Russians will come third with a draw or with a defeat that is not greater than their 3-2 home success against Viktoria. Pilsen have lost both home games so far in Group D without scoring a goal but had won ten of their preceding 11 home fixtures in UEFA competition, including three in a row in this season's qualifying rounds. Before losing at Bayern (3-0) and City (5-2), CSKA were on a run of just two losses in 11 away outings in UEFA competition."

Freiburg squandered a couple of clear chances before Wolfsburg's Germany defender Marcel Schafer came off the bench for Olic to score their third in added time. Freiburg remain third from bottom with a third straight defeat and to make matters worse they had French midfielder Francis Coquelin, on loan from Arsenal, carried off with a suspected broken ankle just after the break. Hertha Berlin stayed seventh and kept hosts Eintracht Braunschweig rooted to the bottom of the table with a 2-0 away win. Colombia striker Adrian Ramos headed Berlin into a first-half lead before 20-year-old midfielder Tolga Cigerci added a late second with his first for the club. On Saturday, France star Franck Ribery produced a commanding display as Bayern Munich extended their record unbeaten Bundesliga run to 40 matches with a 7-0 away romp at Werder Bremen. Ribery boosted his claim for the 2013 world footballer of the year award, which will be announced on January 13, by creating two goals and scoring twice in the rout. Bayern, who last lost in the German league in October 2012, produced their biggest win so far under Pep Guardiola, cutting Bremen's defence to tatters. The victory was short of the Bundesliga's 57-year-old record of 9-0 for an away win and was Werder's heaviest home league defeat. Bremen coach Robin Dutt kept the team on the pitch for a stern lecture as they dropped to 14th after just two wins in their last 10 games.

Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen stayed four points behind Bayern with a hard-fought 1-0 win at third-placed Borussia Dortmund, who now find themselves six points behind Leverusen and ten points behind Munich. South Korea striker Son Heung-Min hit the 18th-minute winner after Leverkusen's attack pounced on a mistake by Dortmund defender Manuel Friedrich for Son to score his fifth goal in his last three games against Borussia. Both sides finished with 10 men in a tense affair. Dortmund lost both defensive midfielders Sven Bender and Nuri Sahin during the match with ankle injuries. Germany's Bender has been ruled out of Wednesday's Champions League game at Marseille with a sprained ankle, while Sahin has a torn ligament and is rated extremely doubtful.

Dortmund slipped to third last month when they suffered back-to-back league defeats at Wolfsburg and at home to Bayern, having lost their entire back four to injury, but this is their chance to reclaim second. ""There are three league games left this year, we have nothing more to give away and we all want to win,"" said Klopp. ""We have 31 points, which isn't bad, nevertheless we have lost points along the way and that has hurt us."" Should Dortmund win and Bayern win or draw at Werder Bremen, to extend their unbeaten Bundesliga run to a record 40 matches, the Bavarians would open a seven-point gap at the top. Leverkusen, coached by ex-Liverpool defender Sami Hyypia, were thrashed 5-0 at home by Manchester United in the Champions League ten days ago and are eager to restore battered confidence against Borussia Dortmund. ""They have the chance to make amends against us, but we are at home and we have ambitions of reaching a high position in the table,"" said Klopp. ""A win against Leverkusen is always something special."" Hyypia was guarded about his side's chances at Westfalenstadion. ""It is always hard to take something from Dortmund,"" said the ex-Finland star.

Robben was left with a cut to the bone on his right knee having been stretchered off after scoring in Wednesday's 2-0 German Cup win at Augsburg which put Bayern in the quarter-finals.

""There is this stupid debate about how dominant we are, which is superficial and implies we should win games like this, just by turning up."" But Bayern are certainly able to see off most of their Bundesliga rivals without too much effort, as they proved in last Saturday's 2-0 lacklustre win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Bayern are used to around 75 percent possession in league games and Werder coach Robin Dutt said there is no secret to beating the Bavarians. ""The first trick is to run, the second is to run some more and the third is to keep running,"" he quipped. Having dropped to third after losing back-to-back league matches, Dortmund can regain second place by beating Bayer Leverkusen at home in Saturday's key game. The hosts are waiting on the fitness of midfielders Sven Bender, who broke his nose against Napoli, and Nuri Sahin, who has a leg injury. Germany winger Marco Reus, who has a bruised calf, is improving, with a decision to be made after the final training session. ""There will be no excuses on Saturday,"" said Klopp, whose side will also need to win at Marseille on Wednesday to reach the last 16 of the Champions League. ""This is a difficult game for both teams. ""We have now got used to having a few players missing and we have adjusted well.""

Borussia Dortmund picked up their first win in three league games with a hard-fought 3-1 success at ten-man Mainz 05 to stay third and seven points behind Bayern. Dortmund took the lead on 70 minutes when Gabon's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang fired home a superb free-kick, but the lead lasted just four minutes before Cameroon's Eric Choupo-Moting slotted home a penalty. Mainz were reduced to 10 men when Colombia's Elkin Soto was sent off for stopping the ball going into the net with his hand and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski fired home the 79th-minute penalty. Lewandowski then made sure of the points with his second penalty when he converted the 94th-minute spot kick after left-back Erik Durm was up-ended. Bayer Leverkusen bounced back from their 5-0 drubbing at home to Manchester United in the Champions League on Wednesday -- their worst home result in Europe -- with a 3-0 win at home to Nuremberg to stay second. South Korea striker Son Heung-Min netted twice while Germany's Stefan Kiessling hit their second after a superb back-heel from midfielder Jens Hegeler. Schalke, who have lost left-back Dennis Aogo for the rest of the season with a knee injury, moved up to fifth with a 3-0 win at home to VfB Stuttgart. Peru winger Jefferson Farfan scored twice, including a penalty early in the second-half, before US midfielder Jermaine Jones added a late third. Mid-table Werder Bremen warmed up for next Saturday's visit of Bayern with a point at Hoffenheim in an eight-goal thriller as sub Philipp Bargfrede -- with the Bremen squad number 44 -- equalised in the 91st-minute to make it 4-4. Augsburg -- who face holders Bayern on Wednesday in the third round of the German Cup -- played out a goalless draw in the capital against Hertha Berlin. On Friday, Hamburg continued their revival under ex-Holland boss Bert van Marwijk with a 1-1 draw at fifth-placed VfL Wolfsburg."

Son, 21, who hit his first Bundesliga hat-trick against Hamburg three weeks ago, struck as he twice blasted home crosses from team-mate Gonzalo Castro on 36 and 76 minutes. The South Korean star now has six goals in 11 league games in his first season at Bayer. Former Germany striker Stefan Kiessling hit Leverkusen's second after a superb back-heel from midfielder Jens Hegeler. Hyypia's Leverkusen, who are four-points behind leaders Bayern Munich, face a key Bundesliga battle on Saturday when they travel to third-placed Borussia Dortmund. ""We took some time to get into the game and get our confidence back,"" said the ex-Liverpool defender. ""It was important to win. Preparing for the game wasn't so easy after the Man Utd game. ""We showed character after such a disappointment."" The win brought some cheer to Leverkusen's director of sport Rudi Voeller, the ex-Germany star, who is in hospital being treated for kidney stones."
1138,30/11/2013,21:07,Football: Bayern machine rolls on as busy month looms,Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola admitted the European champions were just happy to see off Eintracht Braunschweig 2-0 and extend their record Bundesliga run ahead of a busy December.,"Bayern's victory at Munich's Allianz Arena was down to Dutch winger Arjen Robben's first-half brace as the Bavarians ran out of steam in the second-half. The three points extended Bayern's record unbeaten run in the Bundesliga to 39 matches and came just four days after they set the record of 10 consecutive Champions League victories by beating CSKA Moscow in Russia. ""It's one game more and we won,"" said Guardiola. ""We dominated possession and, in the first half, we were very strong mentally after (last Saturday's 3-0 win at) Dortmund and the trip to Moscow. ""In the second half we didn't manage to bring (striker) Mario Mandzukic into the game, but at the end, I am happy with the performance."" But Bayern were lacklustre in the second-half against bottom side Braunschweig, who have never won in Munich. ""We are human beings and not machines,"" said goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, while midfielder Toni Kroos added: ""sometimes it's okay if you just win the game."" Having played in sub-zero temperatures in Moscow on Wednesday, match-winner Robben was just glad to play on a normal pitch after wet snow had made conditions tough on CSKA's heavy pitch. ""That was a hard game in Moscow, including the travel,"" said the 29-year-old. ""When you come back here and play on a good pitch, it's simply fun."" Bayern host Bavarian neighbours Augsburg in the third round of the German Cup on Wednesday, then travel to Werder Bremen in the league on Saturday before hosting Manchester City in the Champions League on December 10. After hosting Hamburg, Bayern then travel to Morocco for the Club World Cup in a bid to win their second piece of silverware under Guardiola, having won the UEFA Super Cup against Chelsea in August. Borussia Dortmund picked up their first victory in three league games with a hard-fought 3-1 win at ten-man Mainz 05 to stay third behind second-placed Bayer Leverkusen and Bayern. Borussia, who must win in Marseille in a fortnight to reach the last 16 of the Champions League, can reclaim second place in the Bundesliga if they beat Leverkusen in Dortmund next Saturday. Dortmund took the lead on 70 minutes in Mainz when Gabon's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang fired home a superb free-kick, only for Cameroon's Eric Choupo-Moting to equalise with a penalty four minutes later. Mainz were reduced to 10 men when Colombia's Elkin Soto was sent off for using his hand to stop the ball going into the net and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski fired home the first of two penalties. ""You have to evaluate the win in the context of our situation,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp, who lost his entire back four ten days ago through injury. ""We showed a very, very good fighting spirit. ""The fact that in certain situations our opponents had their chances to win the game says everything about Mainz's class."""

It will all come down to the final matches on Wednesday December 11 when Dortmund are looking to inflict a sixth straight defeat on hosts Marseille, while Napoli host Arsenal in Naples. ""We wanted to live our Champions League dream, despite all the doomsayers,"" said Klopp after their home defeat to Arsenal three weeks ago meant they had to beat Napoli to have any chance of qualifying. ""Now things look much better, but we still have to win at Olympique Marseille."" The permutations of the final round of games are complex with Arsenal and Dortmund strong favourites to reach the last 16, while bottom side Marseille are out after suffering five defeats. Arsenal must avoid defeat by three goals or more to progress, but if both Napoli and Dortmund win, it will leave all three teams on 12 points, creating a mini league which would be decided on goal difference. Dortmund currently have a goal difference of +1, Arsenal are on +2 while Napoli are on -3, hence the reason they have to beat Arsenal by three goals or more. Should that happen, the Gunners would finish third in the group and go into the Europa League. Dortmund midfielder Nuri Sahin admitted that during the Napoli game he was confused about what the permutations of the result were. ""After Napoli scored their goal, I asked (Dortmund captain) Sebastian Kehl if the result was still good enough for us,"" said the ex-Real Madird and Liverpool midfield. ""Jurgen (Klopp) had explained everything the day before, but I didn't fully understand it at the time. ""After we scored to make it 3-1, I knew that was enough."" Germany's defensive midfielder Sven Bender, who was playing out of position at centre-back, epitomised Dortmund's fighting spirit by playing on despite a broken nose to earn the nickname 'Iron Head'. Having had his nose broken early in the game after a clash with Napoli's Christian Maggio, the Borussia team doctor had a hard time stemming the bleeding. In the end Bender had to change his jersey three times because of the blood and Dortmund's kit man raided the club shop to get an extra shirt with the name ""Bender"" printed on the back. ""It was crazy how much bad luck he had,"" said Klopp, after Bender also broke his jaw in a Champions League defeat at Arsenal two years ago. ""Given his performance, it was very important to keep him on the pitch. He played a really great game."""

But a Marco Reus penalty and second-half strike by Jakub Blaszczykowski put Dortmund 2-0 up with an hour gone before Lorenzo Insigne pulled one back for Napoli with 20 minutes left. Substitute Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang came on to grab Dortmund's third, 12 minutes from time, to calm nerves and put Borussia level on nine points with Napoli in the group behind leaders Arsenal. ""Now we're back in the race,"" said Klopp, whose side broke a three-match losing streak including Saturday's 3-0 drubbing at home to Bayern Munich. ""We couldn't have done more to set things up for the last game. ""We knew that this would be a spectacular match, but I didn't expect to see so many chances and so much excitement on the pitch. ""We wasted a lot of opportunities, but (Napoli goalkeeper) Pepe Reina also made some great saves. ""We worked hard and recorded a highly deserved win, but Napoli were a very tough opponent and it wasn't easy for us."" With the Gunners three points clear, who will qualify from Group F will now be decided by the final round of pool matches when Dortmund travel to Marseille and Napoli host Arsenal in a fortnight. Dortmund right-back Kevin Grosskreutz admitted the permutations of what Borussia need to progess to the knock-out stages had bothered him during the game. ""After Napoli scored their goal, I asked (Dortmund captain) Sebastian Kehl if the result was still good enough for us,"" said Grosskreutz. ""Our coach (Klopp) had explained everything the day before, but I didn't fully understand it at the time. ""After we scored to make it 3-1, I knew that was enough. ""We wanted to give our fans and ourselves something to celebrate. We deserved to win."" The victory at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion avenged Borussia's 2-1 defeat at Napoli in September, but their coach Rafael Benitez admitted his side had struggled to cope with the hosts' pressing game. ""Our mentality is to try to win every game against any opponents and I think we played the right way,"" said the Napoli boss. ""However we were facing one of the best counter-attacking teams in Europe and it was not easy after going down so early in the game."""

Dortmund got an early breakthrough when Federico Fernandez hauled down Poland striker Robert Lewandowski in the area and Germany's Reus stepped up to drill home the penalty after 10 minutes. Just eight minutes later, Reus forced Napoli goalkeeper Pepe Reina into a diving save when he curled in a free-kick. The first half was a nervy affair and with half an hour gone Napoli hit the post when Jose Callejon jinked inside Bender and beat Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller. At the other end Lewandowski fired wide and forced Reina into one of his many fine saves in the Napoli goal. Dortmund desperately needed a second goal to calm their nerves and there were anxious glances at Westfalenstadion when Gonzalo Higuain was put clear in the area, but Weidenfeller blocked his half volley. Less than a minute later, Borussia grabbed their second when Dortmund swept forward on the counter-attack. Reus broke down the left and found Poland winger Blaszczykowski unmarked to slot the ball between Reina's legs with a first time shot on 60 minutes. Napoli got back in the game with a superb goal on 70 minutes after Higuain pounced on a loose pass and with Weidenfeller off his line, Insigne fired home from a tight angle. Only another excellent save from Reina denied Dortmund Aubameyang, but the Gabon winger found the net soon after. The former St Etienne man chipped Dortmund's third goal home when the hosts' pressing game saw Lewandowski steal possession and charge down the right before Aubameyang chipped Reina on 78 minutes.

With the Gunners three points clear, who will qualify from Group F will now be decided by the final round of pool matches when Dortmund travel to Marseille and Napoli host Arsenal in a fortnight Having lost his entire back four to injury, Borussia coach Jurgen Klopp moved defensive midfielder Sven Bender to centre-back alongside Greece international Sokratis with his first-choice pairing of Mats Hummels and Neven Subotic ruled out. Dortmund got an early breakthrough when Federico Fernandez hauled down Poland striker Robert Lewandowski in the area and Germany's Reus stepped up to drill home the penalty after 10 minutes. Just eight minutes later, Reus forced Napoli goalkeeper Pepe Reina into a diving save when he curled in a free-kick. The first half was a nervy affair and with half an hour gone Napoli hit the post when Jose Callejon jinked inside Bender and beat Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller. At the other end Lewandowski fired wide and forced Reina into one of his many fine saves in the Napoli goal. Dortmund desperately needed a second goal to calm their nerves and there were anxious glances at Westfalenstadion when Gonzalo Higuain was put clear in the area, but Weidenfeller blocked his half volley. Less than a minute later, Borussia grabbed their second when Dortmund swept forward on the counter-attack. Reus broke down the left and found Poland winger Blaszczykowski unmarked to slot the ball between Reina's legs with a first time shot on 60 minutes. Rafael Benitez's Napoli got back in the game with a superb goal on 70 minutes after Higuain pounced on a loose pass and with Weidenfeller off his line, Insigne fired home from a tight angle. Only another superb save from Reina denied Dortmund replacement Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but the Gabon winger found the net soon after. The St Etienne man chipped Dortmund's third goal home when the hosts' pressing game saw Lewandowski steal possession and charge down the right wing before Aubameyang chipped Reina on 78 minutes. The third goal could prove crucial in the head-to-head stats should Dortmund and Napoli finish level after the final round."

1150,26/11/2013,02:00,Football: Real and United home in on last 16,Former winners Real Madrid and Manchester United are amongst the teams that could wrap up qualification to the Champions League knock-out stages on Wednesday.,"Big-spending French champions Paris Saint-Germain, Olympiakos and Bayer Leverkusen can also qualify. GROUP A Bayer Leverkusen (GER) Manchester United (ENG) Both sides at the BayArena would secure qualification to the knock-out stages with a victory. Manchester United know that a win will almost be enough to secure top spot, unless they lose at home to Shakhtar Donetsk in their final group game. A draw would suffice for both teams as long as Shakhtar lose at home to Real Sociedad in the group's other match. Leverkusen have been hit by the loss of Germany midfielder Sidney Sam while United also have several players on the treatment table, notably Michael Carrick. The Germans, though, have been in good form in the league and are up to second behind Bayern Munich following their 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin while United were stunned by an injury-time equaliser at Cardiff on Sunday. The pressure is on Leverkusen, though, as their final match is away to Sociedad while United know they still have a home game at Old Trafford to come if they fail to secure qualification in Germany. Shakhtar Dontesk (UKR) v Real Sociedad (ESP) This is a must-win game for Sociedad if they harbour any hopes of prolonging their involvement in European football this season. While continuing their adventure in the Champions League will depend on them winning and Manchester United beating Leverkusen, and then Real beating the Germans in their final game with Shakhtar not stunning United at Old Trafford, a consolation spot in the Europa League is not so far-fetched. That, however, would still depend on beating the Ukrainians as anything else would see them finishing bottom of the group. Shakhtar's final match being away to group favourites United, they too will be feeling a win is necessary to keep their progression hopes alive, which could make for an open and entertaining match in Donetsk. Group B Juventus (ITA) v FC Copenhagen (DEN) Antonio Conte's Serie A team come into this match under pressure for their Champions League future. Bottom of the group and the only team yet to win a match, they must win this fixture to keep their destiny in their own hands. But even so, with a clash away to Galatasaray in their final group game, they know they cannot afford to lose either of their last two fixtures or face certain elimination. Only two wins will guarantee them a last 16 spot, although with both their opponents also having to play Real Madrid, Juve will feel quietly confident that a win and a draw will likely prove sufficient. Real Madrid (ESP) Galatasaray (TUR) A point would be enough to send Real into the knock-out stages and would also tie up top spot, barring an unlikely five-goal defeat at FC Copenhagen on the final matchday and assuming the Danes also win away to Juventus on Wednesday. Madrid will probably be without star forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who picked up a hamstring problem in the 5-0 win at Almeria on Saturday. The loss of a player who has scored 14 goals in his last seven matches for club and cuntry would seem a blow but such has been Real's domination of the group so far, and given they crushed Galatasaray 5-0 in Istanbul earlier in the campaign, they will be confident of doing enough to secure their passage through. Group C Paris Saint-Germain (FRA) v Olympiakos (GRE) Paris Saint-Germain will qualify for the last-16 knockout phase with a draw at home to the Greek champions at the Parc des Princes, while Olympiakos will also go through with a point should Anderlecht defeat Benfica in Brussels. Laurent Blanc has guided his Ligue 1 leaders on an unbeaten run in all competitions since taking over from current Real Madrid handler Carlo Ancelotti while the capital outfit have not lost in the league since last March when they went down 1-0 at Reims. Captain Zlatan Ibrahimovic has scored 17 goals in his last 11 matches for club and country, including the third in the 3-0 win over Reims on Saturday which kept the team four points clear at the top in France. Olympiakos coach Miguel Torres has also built an impressive unbeaten league run of 29 matches without loss since taking over in February as they lead the Greek league and have not lost a domestic match away from home in 28 fixtures, one short of their own national record. Anderlecht (BEL) v Benfica (POR) The Belgian leaders are much in need of their first victory of the group stage and will take heart from their gutsy 1-1 draw at PSG on matchday four. They lost 2-0 in Lisbon, the first time the teams met, but with the Portuguese picking up just one point from two fixtures against Olympiakos, Benfica will be looking for maximum points to stay in touch with the top two spots and also solidify their chances of guaranteeing at least third and a spot in the next round of the Europa League. The teams met in the 1983 UEFA Cup final which was won by the Brussels' club, an occasion that saw current Benfica assistant coach Minervino Pietra turn out for the Lisbon side. Anderlecht are trying to reach the second round for the first time since 2000-01 while Benfica finished third in their pool last season before going on to reach the Europa League final where they were beaten 2-1 by Chelsea in Amsterdam. Group D CSKA Moscow (RUS) v Bayern Munich (GER) The defending champions are Europe's in-form side and chasing what would be a record tenth consecutive Champions League victory when they visit a CSKA Moscow outfit who can only finish third at best. The Bundesliga front-runners are coming off a 3-0 thrashing off Borussia Dortmund at the weekend, the team they defeated in last year's final. That win on the road extended their German league record to 38 matches unbeaten, although they will be wary of dropping points and potentially top spot in the group to Manchester City. Bayern have won three of their eight trips to Russian clubs in European action but have only lost once back in 2008 when they were sent packing at the semi-final stage of the UEFA Cup, well beaten on the night 4-0 by Zenit Saint-Petersburg. The German club have been rocked by a suspected mole at the Allianz Arena who has been revealing tactics ahead of matches to the German press much to the fury of coach Pep Guardiola. Manchester City (ENG) v Viktoria Plzen (CZE) The 2012 English champions have qualified for the knockout phase for the first time following back-to-back wins over CSKA but need to keep the pressure on Bayern at the top who are three points clear heading into the penultimate matches. Manuel Pellegrini looked on as his side humiliated Tottenham 6-0 in Premier League action on Sunday and maximum points at home will set up a last day finale in Munich. The Czech Republic side make their first trip to England, but looking for their first points and a bid to keep alive their Europa League prospects flickering, looks a daunting challenge on paper at a City team who have lost just once at home in their last 22 European ties. Coming into this season's group stage, Plzen were riding a seven match unbeaten run on their travels but are now trying to break a four match European losing streak, their worst in club history."
1151,25/11/2013,19:52,Football: Dortmund ready for 'final' against Napoli,Coach Jurgen Klopp has said Borussia Dortmund will approach Tuesday's Champions League clash at home to Napoli like it were the final with another defeat pointing to a group-stage exit.,"Dortmund's 1-0 defeat at home to Arsenal three weeks ago has left last season's finalists third in Group F, three points adrift of both the Gunners and Napoli, who are level on nine points. The Germans must win both of their last two games to be sure of reaching the knock-out stages with a trip to Marseille also to come in December. A draw would be enough for Napoli to qualify for the knockout phase for the second time in three seasons, but defeat would allow Dortmund to draw level and set up a tense final round of matches. ""We are definitely under pressure in the most exciting group in the Champions League,"" said Klopp, whose side lost 2-1 at Rafael Benitez's Napoli in their opening group game. ""It is up to us to keep it exciting by winning. ""Things will be complicated if we don't win our two games. ""Napoli know that as well and this will shape tomorrow's game."" Having beaten Arsenal in London and Marseille at home in Europe, Dortmund have lost their last three games, including Saturday's 3-0 defeat at home to European champions Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga. Injury has decimated Borussia with their entire back four missing after Mats Hummels and Marcel Schmelzer both returned from international duty last week with ligament injuries. It has meant Klopp had to throw ex-Germany centre back Manuel Friedrich straight in against Bayern, having only been signed as emergency cover last week. Friedrich's centre-back partner Sokratis has said Dortmund are desperate to win to keep their Champions League's ambitions alive having reached last season's final in May. ""We have to work hard again, this will be like a final for us,"" said the Greece international. ""All the players know what's at stake. We are ready and we know that we still have things in our own hands."" Klopp has said veteran defensive midfielder Sebastian Kehl is an option having returned from injury. And Poland right-back Lukasz Piszczek could also feature off the bench having recovered from pre-season surgery. Napoli have injury worries of their own with captain and attacking midfielder Marek Hamsik ruled out after suffering a foot injury in their 1-0 defeat to Parma. More worryingly, Benitez's side have lost their last two Serie A matches and need a morale-boosting win of their own at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. ""I have a lot of respect for Dortmund, they earned it last season in Europe,"" said Benitez. ""This will be a good test for us to see how far we've come. ""We have played well in three of our four Champions League games so far, we didn't play so well only in our (2-0 defeat) at Arsenal. ""Our team is still developing, it is a process and very exciting."" Spanish goalkeeper Pep Reina, on loan from Liverpool, said Napoli are eager to beat Dortmund and keep up the pressure on Arsenal, who host bottom-side Marseille the same night. ""After two league losses, we will play with even more heart,"" said the 31-year-old. ""We shouldn't play for a draw, they have too much quality for that. ""We know what we want -- to go through to the next round."""
1152,25/11/2013,12:47,Football: Guardiola threatens Bayern's mole,European champions Bayern Munich are again dominating this season but behind the scenes coach Pep Guardiola has threatened the mole who is leaking details of tactics to the German press.,"""No matter who it is, heads will roll. I will throw him out and he'll never play for me again,"" Guardiola fumed to German daily Bild. Guardiola is furious after details of Bayern's tactical plan appeared in Bild, hours before Saturday's 3-0 league win at rivals Borussia Dortmund in a replay of May's Champions League final. Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge confirmed the ""mole affair"" to German Sky on Sunday with a tongue-in-cheek reference to America's National Security Agency, which is currently under fire for covertly collecting data on European leaders. ""We won't be turning to the NSA to find out who it is, but I would advise the person concerned to immediately stop this performance,"" said Rummenigge. ""Otherwise he will have a serious problem, not only with Pep Guardiola, but with the whole club."" Bayern are currently four points clear in the Bundesliga and the holders have already qualified for the Champions League knock-out stages with two games left. This is not the first time a mole has recently struck in German football. In June 2012, Germany head coach Joachim Loew was presented with a similar problem when the team's line-up was also leaked to Bild during the European football championships. But on that occasion the mole was never revealed."
1153,25/11/2013,11:37,Football: Bayern chairman rules out Messi bid,"Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has ruled out bidding for superstar Lionel Messi, who has a buyout clause worth 250 million euros ($338.5 million) in his Barcelona contract.","""We are talking about simply absurd figures, a transfer fee that is even higher than what we spent on Javi Martinez. We won't go there,"" Rummenigge told German Sky Sports. ""Barcelona's president Sandro Rosell is an old friend and I know they would never sell Messi. He is a saint at Barcelona. ""And I think it would be in Messi's best interest to stay at Barcelona. He fits in perfectly there."" Rumours of a Bayern bid for Messi, which would see the Argentinian link up with his former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola, have been circulating in Germany. The Bavarians could probably afford the enormous sum. A fortnight ago Bayern revealed they had posted a record 432.8 million euros in sales during last season's campaign. They became the first German club to claim the treble when they won the Champions League, a 23rd German championship and the DFB Cup. But even Bayern coach Guardiola has said his former protege is at the right club. ""Would I sign Messi? No, no! Barcelona is the best place for him,"" Guardiola is reported to have said. Bayern won 3-0 at German rivals Borussia Dortmund on Saturday, in a repeat of May's Champions League final, and are four points clear in the Bundesliga having already reached the knock-out phase in Europe."
1154,25/11/2013,03:12,Football: Dortmund braced for must-win Napoli clash,Captain Roman Weidenfeller has insisted Borussia Dortmund convert their chances against Napoli on Tuesday in a must-win game as last season's Champions League finalists face a group-stage exit.,"Dortmund's 1-0 defeat at home to Arsenal three weeks ago left them third in Group F on six points, three behind joint leaders Napoli and the Gunners and heading for the Europa League. Both Napoli and Dortmund come into their penultimate group stage game after suffering defeats in their respective leagues. Borussia have lost their last three games in all competitions, including Saturday's comprehensive 3-0 home defeat to Bayern Munich in a repeat of May's Champions League final. A fourth straight defeat would further erode confidence and, if Arsenal only draw with Marseille in London, end their Champions League's knock-out stages ahead of their final match at Marseille on December 11. Dortmund now find themselves seven points adrift of Bayern in the Bundesliga and Weidenfeller has said his team must improve their finishing and take their chances against Rafael Benitez's Napoli. ""I think Tuesday's game is much more important than (the defeat to) Bayern,"" said Weidenfeller, who was sent off in Dortmund's 2-1 defeat at Napoli in September. ""We have to win against Napoli at home, it's as simple as that. ""As I have been saying for a few weeks now, there is a lack of single-mindedness and determination with us at the moment ""Our problem is that we are not  finishing our chances. ""There are too many times when we play the ball across the penalty area and don't go directly for goal. ""We have to take our chances, because football is decided by goals and at the moment, we're not scoring them."" Dortmund's star-studded attack were left frustrated by Bayern's defence as both attacking midfielders Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marco Reus squandered clear chances. Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund have only scored one goal in their last three games and to make matters worse, they have lost their entire back four in recent weeks. Both Mats Hummels and Marcel Schmelzer returned from international duty with Germany carrying leg injuries and new-signing Manuel Friedrich was thrown in at centre back alongside Greece's Sokratis. A second defeat in four days would put a significant dent in Dortmund's ambitions, but Weidenfeller insisted there is still all to play for. ""Nothing is decided yet. Neither in the Champions League or in the Bundesliga,"" he said. ""We can't just assume that we'll be German champions again after a year's break (when Bayern were Bundesliga winners last season). ""We're seven points behind Bayern, but the season is still long enough."" Napoli only need to avoid defeat at the Westfalenstadion to seal progress to the knock-out stages. They will be without playmaker Marek Hamsik, who suffered a foot injury during Saturday's shock 1-0 defeat to Parma. The Slovakia international is likely to be replaced by Lorenzo Insigne, who normally operates on the left, or versatile Belgian Dries Mertens. Benitez has said he expects a much better performance in Germany with the prize of a place in the knock-out stage at stake. ""Tonight we played badly, especially in attack. In the end, we didn't execute the plan we'd made for this game,"" he said after the Parma defeat. ""Now we have to turn our focus to Dortmund, we'll be looking to recharge our physical and mental batteries for a match which is crucial to us. ""I'm sure the urgency of the game will give the lads the required incentive."""
1155,25/11/2013,02:01,"Football: Chelsea look to seal progress, Dortmund in danger","Four teams have already qualified for the last 16 ahead of matchday five of this season's Champions League group phase. On Tuesday, Chelsea can also clinch progress with just a point in Switzerland, while Arsenal could wrap up qualification too.","Group E FC Basel (SUI) v Chelsea (ENG) Knocked out in the group stage last season as the defending champions, Chelsea need just a draw against Basel in Switzerland to clinch their place in the last 16, and a fourth successive win in Group E will see the Blues advance as winners of the section. Chelsea won at St Jakob-Park last season in the semi-finals of the Europa League but will be wary of the Swiss champions, having lost 2-1 when they met in London in September. Chelsea come into the game fresh from a 3-0 win at West Ham United that left them in third place in the Premier League. They have lost just one of their last 13 games in all competition, while Basel remain clear at the top of the Swiss Super League and have lost just once in 19 outings. Steaua Bucharest (ROM) v Schalke 04 (GER) Schalke come into matchday five in second place in Group E, and a win in Romania coupled with a defeat for Basel against Chelsea will see the Bundesliga club through to the knockout stages. The Royal Blues were comfortable 3-0 winners when the sides met in Gelsenkirchen in September but they can be infuriatingly inconsistent and threw away a two-goal lead before needing a late Benedikt Hoewedes equaliser to earn a 3-3 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on Saturday. Coach Jens Keller described that result as ""maddening"". He is still without long-term injured Klaas-Jan Huntelaar for the visit to the Romanian capital to face a Steaua side who are unbeaten domestically but without a win in Group E. Group F Arsenal (ENG) v Marseille (FRA) Arsenal will look to close in on a place in the last 16 by inflicting a fifth defeat in five games in this season's competition on Marseille. If the Gunners win at the Emirates Stadium, they will qualify for the last 16 should Borussia Dortmund fail to win at home to Napoli. A draw will be enough if Dortmund lose. Meanwhile, Marseille are already eliminated but could yet steal third place and a Europa League berth with the right combination of results. That seems unlikely, though, especially with coach Elie Baup having fitness concerns over Andre-Pierre Gignac and Mathieu Valbuena. Premier League leaders Arsenal - who won 2-1 in southern France in September - welcomed back Theo Walcott after injury in Saturday's Premier League victory over Southampton. Borussia Dortmund (GER) v Napoli (ITA) Last season's beaten Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund could be eliminated with one round of group games still to play if they fail to beat Napoli in Germany and Arsenal beat Marseille. Such a threat is very real for Jurgen Klopp's team, who suffered a shattering 3-0 home defeat at the hands of Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga on Saturday as they struggle to cope with a defensive injury crisis. Neven Subotic, Mats Hummels and Marcel Schmelzer are all sidelined. Napoli beat Dortmund 2-1 in Italy and a win here will seal their place in the last 16. However, they also come into the game on the back of a disappointing domestic result at the weekend, a 1-0 home loss to Parma damaging their title prospects in Serie A. Group G FC Porto (POR) v Austria Vienna (AUT) Two-time European champions Porto need to win at home to Austria Vienna at the Estadio do Dragao as they chase Zenit for second place in Group G and a spot in the last 16. The Portuguese side won 1-0 in Vienna in September thanks to a second-half Lucho Gonzalez goal but have taken just one point in their subsequent three matches, losing at home to Zenit and Atletico Madrid. Paulo Fonseca's side are undefeated in their domestic league just now and sit top, but were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Nacional on Saturday, leaving the pitch at full-time to jeers from their supporters. Those fans will not tolerate another slip-up against an Austrian side who have registered just one point in Group G so far and failed to score a single goal. Zenit St Petersburg (RUS) v Atletico Madrid (ESP) Atletico are already through to the last 16 as the only side apart from defending champions Bayern Munich to win their first four group games. Diego Simeone's side are already certain to finish first in Group G too, so the Argentine coach has rested key players for the trip into a Russian winter, Diego Costa and David Villa among those left at home. The clash with Zenit comes on the back of a stunning 7-0 win against Getafe that kept them in contention at the top of La Liga. Zenit have only won once so far in the group and were beaten 3-1 in Madrid in September, but a win at the Petrovski stadium will take them through to the last 16 should Porto fail to win later on Tuesday. Group H Ajax (NED) v Barcelona (ESP) Remarkably, Barcelona's 4-0 win against Ajax in September was the first ever competitive meeting of two European giants linked by iconic former player and coach Johan Cruyff. Now they meet in Amsterdam for the first time, with Barcelona already through to the last 16 and needing just a point to be sure of winning Group H. The Catalans - who are top of La Liga - are without a host of injured players just now, including world player of the year Lionel Messi and goalkeeper Victor Valdes. Ajax beat Celtic in their last group game to keep alive their chances of progressing and come into this match fresh from a 3-0 win against Heracles in the Eredivisie at the weekend. Celtic (SCO) v AC Milan (ITA) This tie at Celtic Park is a crunch encounter in the race for the second qualifying spot in Group H. Milan head to Glasgow in second place and will be through if they win and Ajax lose at home to Barcelona. However, the Rossoneri are a club in crisis just now, their 1-1 weekend draw with Genoa leaving them in the bottom half of Serie A and sparking protests from angry fans. Celtic are bottom of the group but they are a formidable prospect at home and beat Milan 2-1 in Glasgow's East End in the group stage of the competition in 2007. A repeat this time would take the Hoops above Massimiliano Allegri's side in the standings."

But Bert van Marwijk's Hamburg brushed off the loss of their skipper to claim their first home win in six attempts. ""It was a hard-fought victory for us with both teams under pressure. Hanover are going through a difficult time while we needed to finally win at home,"" said Van Marwijk. ""We haven't improved much, but we are better organised and we gave fewer balls away."" Hanover's Hungary midfielder Szabolcs Huszti put his side ahead when he hit the top left corner from 16 metres with 28 minutes gone. But the hosts responded with Croatia's Milan Badelj equalising three minutes later before right-wing Maximilian Beister slipped his marker just a minute into the second-half to head home. Beister then turned provider as he found 19-year-old Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu in space and the attacking midfielder fired home for the third six minutes from time. Hanover's Senegal defender Salif Sane was sent off in the dying stages for a second yellow card to compound the guests' misery. It was Hanover's eighth match without a win, their sixth straight away defeat, and saw Mirko Slomka's side drop to 13th in the league. Werder Bremen slumped to 12th and their third defeat in four games, as they went down 3-2, despite a late fight back, at home to seventh-placed Mainz 05, for whom Japan's Shinji Okazaki scored twice. On Saturday, Bayern Munich's Germany star Mario Goetze came off the bench to score the opening goal in the European champions' comprehensive 3-0 win at his ex-club Borussia Dortmund. Goetze, who joined Bayern for 37 million euros (US$50m) in July after 12 years at Dortmund, gave the perfect reply to the chorus of boos he received on his return to Borussia's Westfalenstadion. The 21-year-old smashed home a Thomas Mueller pass on 66 minutes, before the floodgates opened and Arjen Robben and Mueller added late goals in the final five minutes. Bayern capped a commanding performance by beating Dortmund for the first time in seven Bundesliga attempts, dating back to February 2010. It was Munich's first win in Dortmund since September 2009. ""We're happy, we won against the best counter-attacking team in the world,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. Again, Munich ran out winners in a replay of May's Champions League final as Dortmund had been forced to patch together their entire back four after a spate of injuries. But there can be no excuses as Bayern extended their record unbeaten run in the Bundesliga to 38 matches and opened a seven-point lead over Dortmund, who drop to third. Bayer Leverkusen warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Manchester United by going second with a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin. The win came at a cost as Germany winger Sidney Sam was ruled out of the United clash after tearing a thigh muscle four minutes into the game. Sixth-placed Schalke, who are away to Steaua Bucharest in the Champions League on Tuesday and are second in Group E behind Chelsea, drew 3-3 at Eintracht Frankfurt. They raced into a 2-0 lead after only 18 minutes but leaked three goals in 12 disastrous second-half minutes. Germany defender Benedikt Hoewedes saved Schalke's blushes when he hit the top-right hand corner to equalise with just four minutes left. Wolfsburg's four-match winning streak, which has seen them climb to fifth in the league, was ended when they were held to a 1-1 draw at second-from-bottom Nuremberg. Freiburg stay in the relegation places despite their 1-0 win at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, while Augsburg are up to tenth after their 2-0 win at Hoffenheim. On Friday, Borussia Moenchengladbach stayed fourth with a 2-0 win at VfB Stuttgart, their fourth straight win, with goals by Brazil's Raffael and Sweden's Oscar Wendt."

The 21-year-old smashed home a Thomas Mueller pass on 66 minutes, before the flood gates opened and Arjen Robben and Mueller added late goals in the final five minutes. Bayern capped a commanding performance by beating Dortmund for the first time in seven Bundesliga attempts, dating back to February 2010. It was Munich's first win in Dortmund since September 2009. ""We're happy, we won against the best counter-attacking team in the world,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. Again, Munich ran out winners in a replay of May's Champions League final as Dortmund had been forced to patch together their entire back four after a spate of injuries. But there can be no excuses as Bayern extended their record unbeaten run in the Bundesliga to 38 matches to open a seven-point lead over Dortmund, who drop to third. Bayer Leverkusen warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Manchester United by going second with a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin. The win came at a cost as Germany winger Sidney Sam was ruled out of the United clash after tearing a thigh muscle four minutes into the game. Sixth-placed Schalke, who are away to Steau Bucharest in the Champions League on Tuesday and second in Group E behind Chelsea, drew 3-3 at Eintracht Frankfurt. The Royal Blues flew into a 2-0 lead after only 18 minutes away from home, but leaked three goals in 12 disastrous second-half minutes. Germany defender Benedikt Hoewedes saved Schalke's blushes when he hit the top-right hand corner to equalise with just four minutes left. Wolfsburg's four-match winning streak, which has seen them climb to fifth in the league, was ended when they were held to a 1-1 draw at second-from-bottom Nuremberg. The host team's striker Daniel Ginczek equalised after 19-year-old Maximilian Arnold had converted Brazilian play-maker Diego's final pass for Wolves just before the break. Freiburg stay in the relegation places despite their 1-0 win at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, while Augsburg are up to tenth after their 2-0 win at Hoffenheim. On Friday, Borussia Moenchengladbach stayed fourth with a 2-0 win at VfB Stuttgart, their fourth straight win, with goals by Brazil's Raffael and Sweden's Oscar Wendt."
1158,24/11/2013,00:20,Football: Bayern on top in Germany after Dortmund rout,European champions Bayern Munich took a significant step towards retaining the Bundesliga title with their first win at rivals Borussia Dortmund in four years.,"Former Dortmund hero Mario Goetze came off the bench and produced a super shot to give Bayern the lead on 66 minutes before Arjen Robben and Thomas Mueller added to the 3-0 rout in the final five minutes of Saturday's German Clasico. It was Bayern's first Bundesliga win over Dortmund in seven attempts and extended Munich's record unbeaten run in the German league to 38 matches in a repeat of May's Champions League final. The result at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion left Bayern four points clear of Bayer Leverkusen, who replaced Dortmund in second place, while Pep Guardiola's Munich are an ominous seven points ahead of Borussia. ""We are very happy because we won against the best counter-attacking team in the world,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. ""In the first 15 minutes we played very well, but didn't do so well at the end of the first-half. ""We were clearly better in the second half, especially with Thiago, Mario Goetze, Toni Kroos and Philipp Lahm."" Dortmund came into the game having suffered a double injury blow after both Germany defenders Mats Hummels and Marcel Schmelzer were ruled out with injury on Wednesday. Bayern, in contrast were missing only France winger Franck Ribery from their first-choice line-up and Guardiola could bring Goetze and Spain star Thiago Alcantara off the bench. Defending champions Bayern are at CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday, but have already booked their place in the knock-out stages. Dortmund had their chances, with seven shots on goal compared to Bayern's 10, but Marco Reus and Henrikh Mkhitaryan wasted clear chances while Bayern made theirs count. ""We cannot overstate the win,"" beamed goal-scorer Robben. ""It was still 1-0 up until the 85th minute, it looks like a decisive win, but Dortmund had their chances. ""We put the space we had to good effect and perhaps deserved to win. ""As a young boy, you dream of playing in stadiums like this."" Dortmund have no time to lick their wounds with Napoli next up on Tuesday in a game they must win to keep alive their dreams of reaching the Champions League's knock-out stages and are third in their group behind leaders Arsenal and Napoli. ""Bayern changed their game in the second half and hit a few long balls, they were patient,"" said Dortmund coach Juergen Klopp. ""I believe that up until the 1-0, we had big chances, you have to put those away if you want to get back into a game like this."" Dortmund have had a few tough weeks, losing to Arsenal at home in the Champions League and this was their third straight defeat after also losing at Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga. ""Games are decided by goals - and at the moment we're not scoring the crucial ones,"" said Dortmund captain Roman Weidenfeller. ""The amount we lost by is ultimately irrelevant. ""It's a bitter defeat, as we played a good game over nearly 80 minutes and have nothing to show for it."""

1162,22/11/2013,02:20,Football: Injuries take toll on hosts for Germany's 'Clasico',Second-placed Borussia Dortmund host leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday in a Bundesliga top-of-the-table showdown with injuries having decimated the hosts' defence.,"The rematch of last season's Champions League final between the Bundesliga's top sides - billed as Germany's Clasico or Der Klassiker - comes with Pep Guardiola's Bayern four points clear and Dortmund's defence in disarray. Centre-back Mats Hummels and left-back Marcel Schmelzer have been ruled out after returning from international duty with injuries. With centre-back Neven Subotic out for six months with torn ligaments and right-back Lukasz Piszczek only just back in training after surgery, Dortmund will face the European champions without their entire first-choice back four. ""It is a disaster,"" admitted Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. ""The worst thing that can happen to you in football is to have to replace the entire back four. ""A defender, a midfielder or a striker can be replaced by every team, but a whole back four?"" Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp summed up the situation when he said that ""80 percent of my grey hairs were earned this week"", but he has reacted by signing ex-Germany defender Manuel Friedrich, who had been released by Bayer Leverkusen, until the end of the campaign. The 34-year-old is likely to partner Greece international Sokratis Papastathopoulos at centre-back, while youngster Erik Durm is expected to play at left-back with Kevin Grosskreutz on the right. ""We have had to put together a defence which has not yet played 20 games together, but we still have a lot of quality in the squad,"" said Klopp, while sporting director Michael Zorc has defiantly said Dortmund ""won't raise the white flag to anyone"". Even with Bayern's France winger Franck Ribery ruled out with a fractured rib, the pressure is firmly on Dortmund. Their defeat away to Wolfsburg a fortnight ago left them four points adrift, and if they are serious about bringing the Bundesliga trophy back to the Ruhr Valley, this is a match they must win. The difference between the two squads is strength in depth with Guardiola able to call on Germany's Mario Goetze or Swiss star Xherdan Shaqiri to fill in for Ribery. ""It's just like it so often is with us: we have a good enough squad and will certainly have a decent team on the pitch, whose goal will be to win there,"" said Bayern's Germany star Thomas Mueller. Goetze, who is returning to Dortmund having left to join Bayern in the summer, will be making his first appearance at the Westfalenstadion in the red shirt. The 21-year-old has said he has ""no fear"" and understands the passionate home supporters would rather see him playing for Borussia, but ex-Dortmund and Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann has advised him ""not to take throw-ins or corners"" to stay away from the fans. February 2010 was the last time Bayern beat Dortmund in the Bundesliga, but the Bavarians were victorious when it mattered most, beating the black and yellows in May's Champions League final. Much has been made of Bayern's failure to beat Borussia in their previous six Bundesliga showdowns, but having gone 37 league matches and more than a year without defeat, Munich will be confident of extending their unbeaten Bundesliga run. Certainly, Bayern want to again exert their authority over their rivals, who won back-to-back league titles in 2010/11 and 2011/12 before Bayern swept the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup last season. Among the weekend's other matches, struggling Hamburg host mid-table Hanover without captain Rafael van der Vaart, who tore ankle ligaments while on duty with the Netherlands and is expected to be ruled out for the next four weeks.

""I am not scared of going back there,"" Goetze told magazine Sport Bild. ""However, I understand the fans who would rather see me in the Dortmund shirt.

""There are positive memories, Dortmund is a big part of my past and I am looking forward to going back."" But ex-Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann has offered Goetze some practical advice. ""If Mario Goetze plays, it will be a situation for him, in front of 80,000 supporters, which isn't pleasant,"" Lehmann told German Sky Sports. ""He will be booed mercilessly by the south stand and he should avoid taking throw-ins or corners, because that is where the contact to the supporters is extremely close."" Bayern travel to Dortmund four-points clear in the league, while hosts Borussia have been decimated by injuries with their entire back four on the walking wounded list. Bayern's France star Franck Ribery, who is out of the game with a fractured rib, has said Saturday's match will be ""decisive in the title race"", but Goetze says it is too early in the season to make such statements. ""It will be a big step (in deciding the title), but I wouldn't call it 'decisive', there's a lot that can still happen in the second part of the season,"" said Goetze. Having set a new Bundesliga record of 37 games without defeat, Bayern can extend it to 38 against Dortmund, who last lost to Munich in the league back in February 2010 and are unbeaten in their last six league games against the Bavarians.

Borussia were dealt a double injury blow on Wednesday when scans revealed both centre-back Mats Hummels and left-back Marcel Schmelzer returned with injuries from international duty with Germany. Torn ankle ligaments will keep Hummels out until mid January, while a torn calf muscle means a three-week lay-off for Schmelzer. With centre-back Neven Subotic out for six months with torn ligaments and right-back Lukasz Piszczek only just back in training from surgery, Dortmund will face the league leaders without their entire first-choice back four. Having been released by Bayer Leverkusen at the end of last season, centre-back Friedrich, 34, was previously without a club and made the last of his nine appearances for Germany in February 2008. ""We have reacted to the injuries in our defence. Manuel Friedrich has extensive experience and has made a good impression in training,"" said Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc with Friedrich having signed a contract until June 2014. Friedrich is set to partner Greece international Sokratis Papastathopoulos at centre-back against Bayern and has also played for Werder Bremen and Mainz in his Bundesliga career, making 247 league appearances and scoring 15 goals. ""I am thrilled to be allowed to run out in the Borussia Dortmund jersey,"" said Friedrich, who had been training with third division Rot-Weiss Oberhausen to stay fit.

""It will be very difficult, but I am optimistic we can make it through these games."" The timing is bad for Dortmund, who must beat Napoli at home in the Champions League next Tuesday, then Marseille away on December 11, to keep alive their dreams of reaching the knock-out stages. With Hummels' centre-back partner Neven Subotic out for six months with torn knee ligaments and right-back Lukasz Piszczek only just back from surgery, it means Dortmund face the European champions without their entire first-choice back four.

Having come on as a second-half replacement at Wembley, Hummels lasted just 20 minutes on Tuesday while Schmelzer played the first-half against England and was taken off at half-time. Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc has complained about the scheduling of the game against Bayern. ""As far as I am concerned, this is unfortunate scheduling,"" said Zorc. ""To play this match just before another round of Champions League games and after a long international break, is not optimal, in terms of preparation, for the anticipation, for all of it, for all parties involved."" With European champions Bayern four points clear in the league and already in the knock-out phase of the Champions League, Munich coach Pep Guardiola has no such injury concerns. Dutch wing Arjen Robben has recovered from a small knock while on international duty, while centre-back Jerome Boateng is fit to play despite being taken off after half-time at Wembley with a minor heel injury. Having rested both Bayern stars Philipp Lahm and Manuel Neuer for the England match, Germany coach Joachim Loew said he regretted the injuries to Dortmund's Schmelzer and Hummels. Real Madrid also lost Germany star Sami Khedira, in last Friday's 1-1 draw with Italy, for the next six months with a knee injury. ""When players are injured during international matches, it is always regrettable for the player, the club and the national team,"" said Loew. ""Marcel and Mats were in good shape and the fact this has happened is, of course, unhappy news for Dortmund. ""If you also include the bad injury to Sami Khedira, I can't remember the last time we have had so many injuries in such a short period. ""Just like with Sami, I wish Mats and Marcel a speedy recovery and hope to see them on the field again soon."""

Gundogan has also said he is looking to seeing ex-Dortmund star Mario Goetze, who joined Bayern for 37 million euros (US$50m) in July.

The result leaves Frankfurt 15th in the league, just above the relegation places after their fourth straight defeat. Later VfB Stuttgart moved up to eighth after picking up their first win in five games with a 3-1 win at Freiburg, who stay in the bottom three. Stuttgart raced into a 2-0 lead with striker Vedad Ibisevic firing home after nine minutes before 17-year-old forward Timo Werner added a second a minute later. Germany striker Mike Hanke pulled a goal back for Freiburg 12 minutes from time before Werner, a Germany Under-19 international, added his second with a superb finish following a strong run.

He now has a chance to become Germany's leading goalscorer of all time, currently sharing the benchmark of 68 goals with Gerd Mueller. Bayern Munich midfielder Schweinsteiger is out of contention as he requires further surgery on his problem right ankle. Loew's squad features a first call-up for Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller. The 33-year-old has pressed home his claim for inclusion thanks to some fine performances for Dortmund in both the Bundesliga and in Europe, where he helped his side make it to the Champions League final last season. ""We've followed with interest his constant results with Dortmund in the Bundesliga and Champions League,"" explained Loew, who emphasised that Bayern's Manuel Neuer remained his number one 'keeper. Despite Schweinsteiger's absence, Bayern have six of their players on the list including captain Philipp Lahm. Arsenal are doubly represented through Mesut Ozil and Per Mertesacker, while there is one other player from the Premier League in Andre Schuerrle. The Chelsea winger produced a second-half hat-trick in Germany's 5-2 comeback win against Sweden in their final qualifier last month. Germany, who went through qualifying unbeaten to secure their berth in Brazil, face Italy in Milan on November 15 followed by England at Wembley four days later.

Andre Ayew gave Elie Baup's men an early lead, but Napoli hit back to lead at the interval thanks to strikes by Gokhan Inler and Higuain in the space of two minutes. Florian Thauvin pulled Marseille level just after the hour mark as Marseille enjoyed a dominant spell, but the visitors were caught out when a low Dries Mertens cross was turned in by Higuain at the back post to make it 3-2. Napoli's third win in four group games lifted the Italians up to second, level on points with Arsenal, who lead the section after winning 1-0 win away to Borussia Dortmund in the night's other game. Pre-match reports centred on the huge police presence in Naples to contain the threat of possible violence between fans of the Group F rivals following incidents in Marseille on October 22. But if there was any tension among the visiting support, it was soon eased when Andre Ayew gave Marseille a 10th-minute lead with a header from a corner which beat a static Jose Reina in the Napoli net. Barely 14 minutes later, however, Marseille were already trailing. Inler chested down a loose ball 20 yards from goal and fired a precision volley past flailing Marseille 'keeper Steve Mandanda in the 22nd minute. And Napoli then took the lead on the break moments later when Marseille were caught in possession in midfield. When the ball found its way to Goran Pandev, the Macedonian's header came off the head of Souleymane Diawara and fell to Higuain, who smashed a low drive into the net. Marseille were fired up at the start of the second half but Jordan Ayew's cross was just too high for Mathieu Valbuena and while Thauvin threatened with a drive, it was off target. Just before the hour Baup replaced Valbuena with Dimitri Payet, and he had a direct role in Marseille's leveller, crossing for Thauvin who sneaked in behind Pablo Armero at the back post to bundle the ball past a stunned Pepe Reina. Three minutes later, Benitez replaced Pandev with Marek Hamsik and the Slovakian played an indirect role in Higuain's winner. Hamsik was several yards offside when Federico Fernandez sent a long ball from midfield to the left of the area but it was collected by Mertens, and he squared for Higuain to beat a confused Mandanda with ease at his back post. Napoli could have scored more with Jose Callejon sending a long-range free kick wide while late substitute Lorenzo Insigne turned on the style to send a curling effort off the post in the closing minutes."

Klopp's side are now looking to complete the double over Arsene Wenger's Arsenal at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion, but the Borussia boss is full of praise for his opposite number. ""For me, he is 'Sir' Arsene Wenger, I love him,"" enthused Klopp in an interview with the English media. ""When you look at Arsenal over the last ten years, they have always played almost perfect football. ""But we all know Arsenal haven't won a title for a long time (the 2005 FA Cup). ""Arsenal have a philosophy from Arsene Wenger, I love that, but I can't coach that way, I am different. ""He likes to have the ball and play football, passing the ball around. ""It's like an orchestra, but they play a silent song. ""I like heavy metal, I always want it to be loud."" Dortmund have certainly made plenty of noise in Group F, bouncing back from their shock 2-1 defeat at Napoli with a 3-0 trouncing of Marseille at home before beating Arsenal in London. It means there is all to play for with Arsenal, Dortmund and Napoli all tied on six points with the Gunners top of the table only on goal difference. Lewandowski, who became the first player to score four goals in a Champions League semi-final last season, warmed up for the Gunners with four goals in the 6-1 league rout of Stuttgart last Friday. Dortmund hope to have captain Sebastian Kehl back in the squad after a six-week injury break due to an ankle injury, but Germany winger Marco Reus insists the hosts can not expect another rout. ""It will of course be enormously difficult. We can't expect as many chances as we had against Stuttgart,"" said Reus. Arsenal warmed up for the trip to Germany with an impressive 2-0 home victory over Liverpool to leave them five points clear at the top of the Premier League. ""It was important to convince people we can win these big games,"" Wenger said of the Liverpool success. ""Let's enjoy it, take a lot of encouragement from it and continue to develop as a team, but we must be cautious as well and be on our toes. ""We have plenty of other big games coming up and this will help us to deal with them."" Defender Kieran Gibbs is also doubtful after limping off in the second half against Liverpool with a calf problem. Jack Wilshere's absence with a rolled ankle in training could well see Tomas Rosicky face his former club on Wednesday night. The 33-year-old Czech playmaker signed from Dortmund in May 2006 and who has been hampered by several injury setbacks, feels the Gunners can be confident of building on their positive start. Rosicky made 126 league appearances for the Bundesliga side during five seasons in Germany after signing from Sparta Prague and is looking forward to a return to the Westfalenstadion. ""I won the league there and played in the UEFA Cup final there so obviously I have a lot of attachments and it will be a special game for me,"" he said."

After upsetting Chelsea in their first group game though they will be anxious to bag all the points here to keep them in the running for a place in the knockout stages. Group F Borussia Dortmund (GER) v Arsenal (ENG) Dortmund ruined Arsene Wenger's 64th birthday celebrations with a 2-1 win at the Emirates a fortnight ago. Dortmund 'keeper Roman Weidenfeller is wary of a reaction, saying: ""We have irritated them with our win in London. Now they want to strike back."" The Bundesliga outfit could not be in better shape, meting out a 6-1 drubbing to Vfb Stuttgart last Friday. Arsenal, second on goal difference to Dortmund, make the trip in good heart themselves having seen off Liverpool 2-0 to pull five points clear in the Premier League. Wenger said: ""We go to Dortmund now and we were very disappointed with how we lost to them. It was a very sloppy goal when we were in control but we got a good result in Germany last season against Bayern Munich. So we have been there before and are used to the atmosphere over there and hopefully we can get a good result."" Napoli (ITA) v Marseille (FRA) Rafael Benitez's Napoli are on a three-match winning run in Serie A, and host Marseille after a 2-1 win at the Velodrome on matchday three. That's left the Italians bang in contention for a place in the knockout round, level on six points with Dortmund and Arsenal, while for pointless Marseille, who ended a five match losing run in Ligue 1 on Saturday, it's a case of win or bust. The Italians are without right back Giandomenico Mesto, who underwent knee surgery on Monday. Group G Zenit St Petersburg (RUS) v FC Porto (POR) Zenit can steal a march on Porto for the runners-up spot by beating them on Wednesday and open up a four point gap with two games remaining. The Russian side made heavy weather of beating Porto in their match a fortnight ago as the hosts played most of the match with only 10 men. Zenit, though, go into the game having seen their eight match winning streak ended at the weekend with a 1-1 draw by Amkar Perm. Porto too were held to a surprise draw, 1-1 away at unheralded Belenenses. Porto boast a good away record away against Russian sides, winning four and losing one, while Zenit have never lost at home to Portuguese clubs in five matches. Atletico Madrid (ESP) v Austria Vienna (AUT) Atletico have made light work of a weak group and can seal their place in the Last 16 -- for the first time since the 2008/09 campaign -- with victory over an Austrian team they outclassed last month in a 3-0 win. A win for Atletico would also set a new club record of four successive wins in European club football's premier competition, beating the three in the 1958/59 season. Atletico warmed up for the game with a comfortable 2-0 win at home to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday for their 11th win in 12 La Liga games. Coach Diego Simeone will be looking to his Brazilian-born striker Diego Costa to inflict more pain on their opponents after he scored a double against them in the first match. ""It's not just his goals, in his participation in the play and the connection he has with the other players he makes the team better,"" purred Simeone of his leading scorer, who has more than made up for the sale of Falcao in the close season. Group H Ajax (NED) v Celtic (SCO) Ajax need at least a point from this game if they are not to be in serious danger of missing out even on third spot and a place in the Europa League. Celtic by contrast will be seeking a repeat of the win they grabbed against the Dutch side last month which reignited hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages for the second successive season. Ajax have made their worst ever start to a CL campaign while Celtic are bidding to avoid a third successive away defeat. Celtic manager Neil Lennon says that he wants his players to take their chances otherwise it could prove very costly. His Ajax counterpart, though, Frank de Boer believes that if his young team repeat the performance they produced against Celtic in the first game they will take the points. ""If we play like that again in two weeks, then we will beat them in the Amsterdam ArenA. I really believe in that."" Barcelona (ESP) v AC Milan (ITA) Barcelona can all but seal their place in the Last 16 with victory at home to a woefully out of sorts and injury-hit Milan side. Barcelona's worries are small by comparison to the Italians, who have made their worst start to a Serie A season in over 20 years, their loss to Fiorentina at the weekend their fifth of the season already. However, coach Massimiliano Allegri appears to be benefiting from some unaccustomed patience from the club directors who have called for no one to panic. However defeat in Barcelona and a Celtic win would really heap pressure on them in the chase for the second spot. The Scottish side are yet to host them and will fancy their chances of avenging an unfortunate defeat at the San Siro."
1195,04/11/2013,02:31,Football: Bayern eye last-16 berth against Pilsen,Holders Bayern Munich can clinch a spot in the Champions League knockout phase on Tuesday when they face Czech champions Viktoria Pilsen whom they swept 5-0 at home two weeks ago.,"The Bundesliga leaders sit at the top of Group D with nine points from three games, leading Manchester City by three points and CSKA Moscow by six, with Pilsen stuck at the bottom with no points. If Bayern win at Pilsen, and CSKA do not win at Manchester, the reigning champions will make it to the last-16 for the sixth time in a row. Last month, a brace from Franck Ribery and a goal apiece from David Alaba, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mario Goetze handed Bayern an easy win over Pilsen. Bayern turned out to be a merciless host, outshooting the visitors 35-0 with 22 attempts on target, putting Pilsen under what their coach Pavel Vrba called a ""tremendous pressure"". Bayern got a boost from a 2-1 Bundesliga victory at Hoffenheim on Saturday, scoring the ninth win of the current campaign and holding on to the league lead a point ahead of Borussia Dortmund. The win with goals from Mario Mandzukic and Thomas Mueller also meant Pep Guardiola's side have equalled Hamburg's 30-year-old league record of 36 consecutive matches without defeat. But the Spanish manager was far from happy with the game. ""It certainly wasn't our best performance, but we've won it. Not everything was perfect, and we'll need to correct the way we're playing,"" he said, looking ahead to the Champions League game. Pilsen trashed FK Jablonec 6-1 in Friday's Czech league game for only the second win from their last six league games. ""I believe the win would give us a nice boost,"" said Pilsen defender Marian Cisovsky as his team returned to the second spot in the Czech league, behind Sparta Prague. ""We didn't play the first game (with Bayern) as we had wanted at all, and we want to show a better performance to the home crowd,"" added the 34-year-old Slovak, urging Pilsen to be ""more vigorous and courageous"". ""The Bayern game will be completely different from the Jablonec tie,"" said Pilsen midfielder Daniel Kolar. ""We have to try not to give them too much room. But Bayern are terribly strong so it won't be easy."" Pilsen striker Stanislav Tecl, who scored twice against Jablonec, said ""the mood in the locker room is better and that's what we needed ahead of the important game."" ""We know that a few miracles have happened in football so we want to give it a try."""
1196,02/11/2013,13:22,Football: Klopp praises relentless Dortmund ahead of Arsenal clash,Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp praised his side's relentless desire to attack after watching them tear apart Stuttgart 6-1 in the Bundesliga on Friday.,"Last season's Champions League runners-up came from behind to beat a Stuttgart side that had been unbeaten since the end of August, with the hosts scoring four of their goals in the second half at the Signal Iduna Park, including a hat-trick from Poland star Robert Lewandowski. It was Dortmund's fourth successive win in all competitions and left them provisionally top of the table, two points ahead of Bayern Munich before the reigning champions try to equal the Bundesliga record of 36 matches without defeat when they go to Hoffenheim on Saturday. ""We could have been 2-0 up before their goal, but we lacked the final touch,"" said Klopp. ""There were some lapses in concentration, but after the break we did not click on the pause button again and played a great game. ""In the second half our focus and final touch were much better, and the final whistle was the only thing I didn't like...and that you can also only get three points for such a display."" Since beating Arsenal 2-1 in London in Champions League Group F, Dortmund have scored nine goals in two games in beating local rivals Schalke and now Stuttgart, although the nature of the goal conceded to Karim Haggui early in Friday's match did leave some cause for concern. ""It's disappointing to concede from another set piece, but we showed a good reaction,"" said Kevin Grosskreutz, who again started at right-back against the Swabians. ""It's going to be a tight game against Arsenal, who are another world class team. But we want to win."" Arsenal, Dortmund and Napoli are level at the top of Group F after three games with six points each."

1198,01/11/2013,02:30,Football: More records in sight as Bayern go to Hoffenheim,Bayern Munich have their eyes set on equalling a 30-year-old record for the Bundesliga's longest unbeaten run as they prepare to go to Hoffenheim on Saturday.,"Following their treble-winning 2012-13 campaign in which they broke one record after another, the outgoing Jupp Heynckes appeared to have left his successor Pep Guardiola with a thankless task. But Guardiola has picked up where Heynckes left off and has already equalled Bayern's longest ever unbeaten start to a Bundesliga season, set in 1968/69. As a result, the reigning champions are now undefeated in their domestic league in 35 games in over a year and a draw or a win at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim on Saturday will see them match the previous best mark set by Hamburg between January 1982 and January 1983. ""Our target and ambition is to take all three points in Hoffenheim,"" left-back David Alaba said this week. ""But obviously, we know Hoffenheim will make it as hard as they can for us in front of their home crowd. Hoffenheim are much stronger compared to last season and they're playing well as a team."" Games involving Hoffenheim have tended to be entertaining affairs this season, with Markus Gisdol's side the joint-top scorers in the division alongside Borussia Dortmund. And their last home game was the now infamous 2-1 defeat to Bayer Leverkusen a fortnight ago in which Stefan Kiessling's 'phantom goal' ultimately proved to be the decisive counter. Hoffenheim have since learned that the result of that match will stand, but their confidence was lifted by a 4-1 win at Hannover last week and Gisdol is looking forward to welcoming the champions. ""It's a special game for us -- for Bayern not so much,"" said Gisdol this week, perhaps forgetting the record that is in sight for the visitors in Sinsheim. Bayern have won eight and drawn two of their opening 10 games to sit a point clear of Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen at the top of the standings, and that trio have already opened up a gap on the pack below that looks unlikely to be closed again. It has been an excellent last week for Dortmund, who followed up wins at Arsenal in the Champions League and at Schalke in the Ruhr derby with the announcement that sought-after coach Jurgen Klopp had extended his contract until the summer of 2018. ""We're all so pleased that we can help this team, which is still a long way from reaching its peak, to develop. We want to shape the future of this wonderful club together,"" Klopp told the Bundesliga's official website. On Friday, Dortmund entertain Stuttgart looking to beat the Swabians at home for the first time since September 2008. Klopp -- who was born in Stuttgart -- knows to expect another tough test against a side who are unbeaten in seven league games since Thomas Schneider replaced Bruno Labbadia in the dugout. ""I assume it will be a closely fought game, but I also believe that we will win,"" said Klopp, who could have Sebastian Kehl back after injury. Like Bayern, Leverkusen have records in sight this weekend, as a win at struggling Eintracht Braunschweig will make this their best ever start to a season in 34 years in the Bundesliga. Sami Hyypia's side, who saw Germany midfielder Lars Bender sign a contract extension this week tying him to the club until 2019, should prove too strong for Braunschweig, who have won just once so far in what is their first top-flight campaign in more than quarter of a century. In other games, Schalke warm up for their Champions League trip to face Chelsea by taking on fifth-place Hertha Berlin in the capital, and struggling duo Nuremberg and Freiburg are both still looking for their first win of the season as they meet in Franconia.

""Lars Bender has come on leaps and bounds at Bayer 04 and now plays for Germany as a full international. He is a key player in our team and also an absolute top hit with the Werkself fans,"" the managing director Michael Schade said on the club's official website. ""Our team is strong and has the potential to improve even further. I want to be part of that story and make my own contribution to ensuring we can become an obvious and permanent member of the leading group."" said Bender, whose twin brother Sven plays for Borussia Dortmund and has also been capped at full international level."

1203,25/10/2013,02:22,Football: Dortmund look for revenge in Ruhr derby,"Fresh from beating Arsenal away in the Champions League in midweek, Borussia Dortmund will be looking for a measure of revenge when they make the shorter trip to face Schalke in the Ruhr derby on Saturday.","Dortmund earned widespread praise last season as they made it to the Champions League final, but their fans will not forget the fact that they lost both meetings with their neighbours from 30 kilometres along the road. A victory at the Veltins Arena would therefore allow Jurgen Klopp's side to get one over on the Royal Blues as well as keep the pressure on Bayern Munich, the leaders who come into the weekend a point clear of Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen. While Dortmund were beating Arsenal 2-1 in London, Schalke were also in Champions League action on Tuesday, although they were outclassed 3-0 at home by Chelsea. Jens Keller's men have only lost once in their last six Bundesliga outings, with that a 4-0 home hammering by Bayern, but they have beaten Leverkusen at home this season and will be determined to repeat their 2-1 derby triumph of March, when Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 victory. ""That was the shadow that lay over last season for us and we need to make amends,"" said Klopp. For Schalke, Huntelaar is missing but Kevin-Prince Boateng will be available to face the side with whom he had a spell in the 2008-09 season. Upon signing for the Gelsenkirchen club, he was forced to retract earlier comments about Dortmund being his ""favourite team"". The rivalry between the clubs is fierce, and the nature of it has not been lost on Schalke's Japanese full-back Atsuto Uchida. ""When I came to Germany I was told straightaway that I wasn't allowed to wear anything yellow, and even to steer clear of black boots. That is how intense it is,"" he said. ""You never want to lose against Dortmund -- and we beat them twice last season. They're a fine team, but we'll be going out looking for another win this time as well."" After tasting victory in his first derby in charge, Keller is hoping for more of the same this weekend. ""You can feel the derby fever everywhere. Everyone knows how special this game is,"" said the man who was under severe pressure at the start of the campaign after Schalke took just one point from their first three games. Elsewhere on Saturday, Bayern put their 34-match unbeaten run in the Bundesliga on the line when they entertain Hertha Berlin, the capital club who sit fourth. A win will keep Pep Guardiola's reigning champions top and will see them go a whole year undefeated since a 2-1 loss to Leverkusen on October 28 2012. Bayern, who are closing in on Hamburg's 30-year-old record 36-match unbeaten streak, have lost veteran Peruvian striker Claudio Pizarro for up to six weeks with a thigh muscle tear suffered in training. That leaves Mario Mandzukic as their only fit centre-forward, although Guardiola should have no qualms about playing Thomas Mueller or Mario Goetze as a false nine. After the controversy of Stefan Kiessling's 'phantom' goal that helped Leverkusen to a 2-1 win at Hoffenheim, Sami Hyypia's side crushed Shakhtar Donetsk 4-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday and now host Augsburg on Saturday. Further down the table, 16th-placed Nuremberg are still without a win as they prepare to face Stuttgart away on Friday in what will be Dutchman Gertjan Verbeek's first game in charge since he was appointed as the successor to the sacked Michael Wiesinger.

1204,24/10/2013,22:55,Football: Swiss want Koller to be Hitzfeld successor,Switzerland will aim to recruit former international Marcel Koller as their manager when German Ottmar Hitzfeld bows out after the World Cup.,"The Swiss Football Association said that current Austria coach was their top choice. ""The ball's in Marcel Koller's court,"" SFA boss Peter Gillieron said. Koller's two-year contract with Austria is up for renewal on December 31 and he is currently considering his options. He will not be able to play the two neighbours off against each other, however. ""There's a certain amount of time-pressure because the Austrian Football Association wants him to give an answer by November 4. But the SFA won't be changing anything in the contractual conditions on offer,"" they said, without elaborating. Former midfielder Koller, 53 next month, made his Switzerland debut in 1982 and was capped 55 times before hanging up his boots after Euro 1996. Moving into management, he won the Swiss title in 2000 with Sankt Gallen and again in 2003 with his hometown club Grasshoppers Zurich, before mixed fortunes in the German Bundesliga with Cologne and Bochum. In 2011 he was tapped to lead Austria. They failed to qualify for Euro 2012, finishing third in their group behind Turkey and top-ranked Germany. In the race to reach the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, they were also third, behind playoff contenders Sweden and, yet again, table-topping Germany. Hitzfeld announced on October 17 that he would be retiring from the game after the World Cup, at the age of 65. The former Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich boss has been at Switzerland's helm since 2008 and has succeeded in taking them to their third World Cup in a row. Unbeaten in the qualifiers -- albeit in a relatively easy group along with Iceland, Slovenia, Norway, Albania and Cyprus -- they jumped seven notches to seventh in the FIFA rankings and are among the top seeds for December's finals draw. The SFA chose Hitzfeld to succeed iconic local name Koebi Kuhn, in charge from 2001. Kuhn, who took Switzerland to Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup, had already decided to retire after Euro 2008 on home turf. Under Hitzfeld, Switzerland qualified the 2010 World Cup, beating future champions Spain in their opening game but failing to clear the group stage. His star fell sharply after their failed Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, but he developed new talent and thanks to the 2014 World Cup run has earned the nickname ""Gottmar"" -- a play on the German for ""God""."
1205,23/10/2013,02:15,Football: Wenger on edge after Arsenal slip,Arsene Wenger admits Arsenal's 2-1 defeat against Borussia Dortmund has left his side's bid to qualify for the Champions League knockout stages on a knife-edge.,"Wenger's team lost their 100 percent record in Group F as Robert Lewandowski's late winner stunned the Gunners and ended their 12-match unbeaten run in all competitions. Henrikh Mkhitaryan had put Dortmund ahead early in the first half and, although Olivier Giroud equalised before the interval, Wenger conceded Arsenal had been below their best both physically and mentally. The Arsenal boss suggested a combination of fatigue and naivety had undone his team and he knows they face a tough road to the last 16. Next up for Arsenal is a daunting trip to Dortmund on November 6 before a home clash with Marseille and then the final group fixture in Napoli in December. ""The group is tight and difficult for us but it (qualification) is still possible,"" Wenger said. ""We have three teams with six points and we have played twice at home so we need a result away, but we can do that. ""Physically Dortmund were a stronger team than any we have played so far this season. ""But disappointment like that is part of a team's development and growth. It is down to us to recover physically."" Wenger felt the turning point of a tightly contested tie came when Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson opted to book Lewandowski rather than show the Pole a red card when he caught Laurent Koscielny with an elbow before his decisive 82nd minute goal. ""It looked like that,"" Wenger said when asked if Lewandowski should have been sent off. ""But the referee was in a much better position than I was and he didn't decide to do it. I will have to look again."" With Arsenal's German playmaker Mesut Ozil tightly marked by Dortmund's tenacious midfielders, Wenger needed a vibrant performance from Jack Wilshere. But the England international was a subdued figure as Wenger once again deployed him out of position in a wide attacking role before substituting him once he suffered an ankle injury. ""You could see he was not completely himself, that's why I took him off,"" Wenger said. ""He looked handicapped after the first tackle. ""He landed awkwardly and after that he limped a little bit. We will see how he responds in the next two or three days and wait for the medical assessment."" Meanwhile, Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp was happy to acknowledge his team's victory was a smash and grab raid. Klopp, watching from high in the stands as he completed a two-match suspension for abusing an official, told his players to hassle Arsenal out of their stride with a high-tempo pressing game and it worked perfectly. ""We knew we had to be disciplined today and we played well,"" he said. ""We were good at pressing and caused a lot of problems for a team that wanted to pass the ball but couldn't. ""When Arsenal had space it was a tiring affair, but we shouldn't forget who we played against. This opponent deserves a lot of respect. ""We only shot three times and made two goals, but that doesn't matter. What matters is the result. ""You have to fight at times and we did that. The winner was maybe the best attack in the game with a brilliant cross and a brilliant finish."" Klopp was naturally delighted with Lewandowski's latest demonstration of a talent that makes him one of the most coveted strikers in Europe. He has repeatedly been linked with a move to Bayern Munich, but Klopp is adamant all the speculation has no affect on the Pole. ""With regards to Lewandowski, we need to stop thinking that if he is not playing well it is because he will be playing for another club soon,"" Klopp said. ""Robbie plays as well as he can for the team, no matter what is written in the news."""

The Gunners trailed to Henrikh Mkhitaryan's early strike, but France striker Olivier Giroud equalised before half-time. However, Poland's Lewandowski had the final word with a typically predatory finish that underlined why he is one of the most coveted strikers in the world. Dortmund's win lifted them level with Arsenal and Napoli on six points in a three-way tie at the top of the group heading into their return meeting with the Premier League leaders on November 6. ""Dortmund were well organised to stop us from playing and we were not as good as we can be offensively,"" Wenger said. ""We put ourselves on the back foot with the first goal and were a bit naive with the second. ""We have to look at ourselves for not being mature enough in situations like that. If you can't win the game you shouldn't lose it."" Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp jokingly apologised for ruining Wenger's birthday, saying: ""I am sorry about this, really. That is a problem of the date. I have a birthday in June when there are no matches. I'm always on holiday! ""To win here in London of course you need a bit of luck, but we made the difference to get the decisive goal and I think we deserved it."" Back in London for the first time since last season's painful Champions League final defeat against Bayern Munich at Wembley, Klopp's classy side seized control in the early stages with some fluid passing and a high-tempo pressing game that stopped Arsenal establishing any rhythm. With Mathieu Flamini sidelined due to a concussion sustained in Saturday's 4-1 win over Norwich, Wenger had recalled Aaron Ramsey, but the Welsh midfielder's first significant contribution completely unhinged his team. When Ramsey took possession on the edge of his own area in the 16th minute, he fatally dwelt too long on the ball instead of making a safety-first clearance and was swiftly tackled by Reus. Lewandowski seized the loose ball and flicked a pass to Mkhitaryan, who took one touch before driving a low strike past Wojciech Szczesny. To their credit, that setback sparked a strong response from Arsenal and Mats Hummels had to clear Tomas Rosicky's shot off the line. Arsenal's pressure was rewarded with an equaliser in the 41st minute. Ramsey spread play wide to Bacary Sagna and the French defender whipped over a teasing cross from the right. Neven Subotic got only the slightest of touches as he slid in to clear, but it was enough to distract Roman Weidenfeller, who had come off his line to claim the cross, and the Dortmund 'keeper allowed the ball to deflect off him into the path of Giroud, leaving him with the simple task of firing into the unguarded net for his seventh goal of the season. Arsenal remained on top for much of the second half but, with Mesut Ozil relatively subdued in midfield, they lacked the killer pass to break down Dortmund again. Wenger responded by sending on Santi Cazorla for Jack Wilshere, the England midfielder who looked completely out of sorts in a wide attacking role, and the change almost reaped an instant reward when the Spanish substitute fired a first-time strike onto the crossbar from long-range. Dortmund were showing signs of losing their cool and Lewandowski escaped with a yellow card after catching Laurent Koscielny with a flailing elbow. That proved a crucial moment as Lewandowski made the most of his reprieve with eight minutes remaining. A sweeping Dortmund move exposed Arsenal down the right flank and Kevin Grosskreutz looped over a cross to the far post where Lewandowski, left unmarked in yards of space, powered a superb volley past the exposed Szczesny."

1209,22/10/2013,02:05,"Football: United, Juventus, out for European boost",Both Manchester United and Juventus will be looking to get some succour from Europe after disappointing results in their domestic leagues at the weekend while Welsh star Gareth Bale could make only his second start of the season for Real Madrid after a succession of niggling injuries:,"Group A Bayer Leverkusen (GER) v Shakhtar Donetsk (UKR) Leverkusen limbered up for this match in controversial fashion, beating Hoffenheim 2-1 courtesy of a 'phantom' goal - Stefan Kiessling heading the winner via a hole in the side netting. While the Bundesliga powers that be mull over what to do about the result Leverkusen are lying third, one point behind Bayern Munich, their best ever domestic start. Rolled over by Manchester United in their Group A opener the Germans got their European bid up and running at the second attempt, against Real Sociedad. Shakhtar, second only on goal difference to United, will be keen to dispel memories of last season's trip to Germany when the wheels came off their campaign with a 3-0 last 16 loss at Borussia Dortmund. The Ukrainian champions, appearing at the group stage for the fourth successive season, have begun brightly with a win over Real Sociedad and a draw against United. Manchester United (ENG) v Real Sociedad (ESP) United may be enduring a torrid start to the  Premier League, the weekend draw with Southampton leaving the titleholders in unusual territory - eighth place and their worst start in 24 years. Europe has proved more forgiving, with David Moyes' side topping Group A on goal difference after the Leverkusen win and Shakhtar stalemate. Pointless Real need to leave Old Trafford with something if they are to inject some life into their first CL campaign in a decade. Whatever happens the outcome is unlikely to be as harsh as their only previous visit to England, when they crashed 6-0 at Liverpool in the 1975/76 UEFA Cup. They received a welcome boost for this first ever meeting between the two teams with a 2-1 win over Valencia in La Liga at the weekend. Group B Real Madrid (ESP) v Juventus (ITA) Real Madrid are sailing regally to the knockout stages, the Spaniards' topping Group B after crushing defeats of FC Copenhagen and Galatasaray. Real could field Gareth Bale, who returned to action after minor injuries as a late substitute in Saturday's 2-0 win over Malaga which left Carlo Ancelotti's men in third. Juve's visit precedes the first 'el clasico' of the season with a trip to Barcelona looming at the weekend. Xabi Alonso, sidelined since fracturing a foot in August, is full recovered but unlikely to be thrust straight back into the fray. With two draws Juve are waiting for their first win, and hardly had the best preparations for the trip to the Bernabeu a 4-2 loss, their first of the season, to Fiorentina. Coach Antonio Conte spoke about ""a massive test', adding: ""Madrid are arguably one of the most ambitious teams. We're facing a club that really want this title, because of their history and their hunt for a tenth European Cup."" Galatasaray (TUR) FC Copenhagen (DEN) Both teams, with one point apiece, are out to bag their first wins in Istanbul. Galatasaray picked themselves up from an opening drubbing by Real to share the spoils with Juventus. Having made it into the knockout stages last season they need to get moving if they are to have any hope of repeating that feat this time against Danish champions Copenhagen. Group C Anderlecht (BEL) v Paris Saint Germain (FRA) Paris Saint Germain should be anticipating a third successive win in three Champions League games as they face an Anderlecht side devoid of confidence and pointless. Ligue 1 leaders after trouncing Bastia at the weekend PSG will be without defender Christophe Jallet, Javier Pastore and Thiago Silva, all injured but such are the riches at coach Laurent Blanc's disposal that their absences shouldn't matter. Anderlecht coach John van den Brom sent out the youngest team in the club's history for the 2-0 league win over Mons last Friday and could well do the same on Wednesday where out of form skipper Guillaume Gillet is likely to start on the bench. Benfica (POR) v Olympiakos (GRE) Both these sides will see the outcome of their two matches as pivotal as to who finishes second and a place in the knockout phase. Both have one win to their credit in the opening two games, over hapless Anderlecht. Benfica will fancy their chances for this game as they have won their last seven European home matches while Olympiakos have yet to beat Portuguese opposition away and have not managed a goal in five trips to Portugal. Olympiakos have been in imperious form in their own league, winning seven and drawing one of the matches, the latest a 4-1 away win against Platanias on Saturday. Group D CSKA Moscow (RUS) v Manchester City (ENG) Both will fancy their chances of taking the runners up spot with Pilsen pretty much out of the running and while City have a woeful away record losing five of their six Champions League away games in the past two campaigns they have a chance of recording their second successive away win this season as CSKA have a poor home record, taking just three points from a possible nine in their last appearance in the CL in 2011/12. City warmed up with a psychological boosting first away win in the Premier League on Saturday, 3-1 at West Ham with Sergio Aguero key to the victory. City manager Manuel Pellegrini believes he now has the squad strength to make an impact both domestically and on the continent. CSKA by contrast are now winless and goalless in their last five domestic matches and without playmaker Alan Dzagoev, who is injured. Bayern Munich (GER) v Viktoria Pilsen (CZE) Holders Bayern should have little trouble in making it nine points from three games against pointless Pilsen although coach Pep Guardiola wants to see a marked improvement in their first-half displays which have been generally lethargic all season. The hosts, though, will be missing Swiss midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri and Brazilian defender Dante, who are both injured, while Guardiola will hope that resting French star Franck Ribery at the weekend has allowed him to recover fully from a sore ankle. Pilsen may be struggling to make an impression on the Champions League but they said on Monday they had won an important battle to retain the services of their coach Pavel Vrba, who has guided them to two titles since arriving in 2008. However, they are presently trailing leaders Sparta Prague by six points and have just one win from their last four games."
1210,21/10/2013,20:53,Football: Klopp backs Ozil to fire Arsenal bid for silverware,Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp on Monday claimed Mesut Ozil's arrival at Arsenal could be the catalyst to finally end the Premier League club's long trophy drought.,"Ozil has played a key role in Arsenal's rise to the top of the Premier League since his club record £42.4 million ($66 million, 50 million euros) transfer from Real Madrid on transfer deadline day last month. Arsenal are unbeaten in eight matches since Ozil moved to north London and the Germany midfielder underlined his value with a double in Saturday's 4-1 win over Norwich Klopp, who guided his team to the Champions League final at Wembley last season, knows all about Ozil from his time in Germany with Werder Bremen and Schalke and will get a close-up look at the playmaker in Tuesday's Group F clash at the Emirates Stadium. But the Dortmund boss is already convinced Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has made one of the signings of the season and he expects the Gunners to make a serious bid to end their run of eight years without silverware. ""This team missed one player and maybe it can be Mesut Ozil,"" said Klopp. ""He is technically perfect, he is fast and has developed a drive to goal. ""He is very intelligent, can play in any team. He has everything, is a natural and it works very well. ""That is why it was a great idea from Arsenal and not so from the one team who let him go. ""One year ago no-one thought it was possible they could play brilliant football without (Santi) Cazorla, now they have some injuries and still look strong with (Aaron) Ramsey and (Jack) Wilshere, (Tomas) Rosicky is back in shape and (Olivier) Giroud, he is one of the best strikers. ""As a supporter this is one of the most beautiful types of football to watch, I like it. ""Who is strong enough to be champions in the Premier League is of course strong enough to go to the final of the Champions League. ""Now they are back in the race for titles and we want to stop them."" Arsenal take on last season's European runners-up in a double-header on matchday three and four which could well shape the outcome of Group F and Klopp admits Dortmund have no margin for error. ""They have more points (than us), are in first place in one of the strongest leagues in the world and they play at home, so will be favourites,"" he said. ""We will have to play one of our best games ever because there is no other chance to be successful here. ""But I think these will be two close games and some of the small things will decide what will happen. ""We have to be prepared for these details and we will see, but if I had to pay for a ticket, then I think I would pick this one."" Klopp was linked with the vacant managerial jobs at both Manchester City and Chelsea during the close-season, but ended up staying in Germany. He remains focused on Dortmund and refused to be drawn when asked if he could still see his future in England. ""I am 46 and I want to work for a few more years, maybe in the future if somebody asks me to come to England, we will see,"" he added. ""But for this moment there is no chance to think about it."""

Dortmund laboured to a lethargic 1-0 win over Hanover 96 on Saturday in the Bundesliga to leave them second in the table and Aubameyang said they must be significantly better at Emirates Stadium. ""Playing Arsenal won't be easy at all and we'll have to do better than we did on Saturday,"" said the Gabon international, who has scored five Bundesliga goals for Dortmund since joining from St Etienne this season. ""We didn't have our usual rhythm and didn't play the high-tempo football we normally do."" While Arsenal's attacking midfielder Mesut Ozil underlined his current form with two goals on Saturday in the 4-1 Premier League win over Norwich, Aubameyang says Dortmund have other Gunners' stars to worry about. ""Ozil is in great form and is crucial to Arsenal's game, but they're a quality side anyway,"" said the 24-year-old. ""(France striker) Olivier Giroud, for example, is also a very good player, I know him well from my time in France, he's a dangerous striker."" Aubameyang put Dortmund's lacklustre performance down to the toll of the international break with several stars having been away on duty. ""We let the game slip away from us and let Hannover find a way into it,"" he said. ""I think it was because a lot of our players had played for their national sides and have had long journeys behind them.

1213,21/10/2013,02:10,Football: Wenger ready for crunch double-header,"Arsene Wenger believes Arsenal's Champions League double-header against Borussia Dortmund will be ""decisive"" in the race to qualify from Group F.","Wenger's side host last season's runners-up on Tuesday before heading to Dortmund for the return on matchday four. The Gunners are currently top of their group following back-to-back wins over Marseille and Napoli. Wenger knows another three points on Tuesday will leave Arsenal in pole position to reach the knockout stages, but he is also well aware that Dortmund could deliver a major blow to his side's qualification hopes. ""Dortmund have grown a lot and they look a different proposition now, maybe they were a bit impressed by us in the first group games when we met them in 2011, but this time they have gained confidence,"" Wenger told UEFA.com. ""I feel we are stronger as well this season, so I think it will be very interesting. ""It is already a very important tie because usually matchday three and four usually are decisive, so that could be the key for us to qualify."" Wenger, whose side are two points clear at the top of the Premier League following Saturday's 4-1 win over Norwich, has a wealth of options to ponder in midfield, with the return to match fitness of Santi Cazorla following an ankle injury. Aaron Ramsey started on the bench against Norwich but replaced Mathieu Flamini just before half-time after the French midfielder suffered double vision following a clash of heads with Alex Tettey, leaving him rated as doubtful for the Borussia tie. ""We have a squad that is, number and quality wise, very, very good. After that in January we are not desperate (to buy) now,"" Wenger said. ""If there is a good opportunity (to buy), why not? But if you know who is out injured now, they will come back in November, the beginning of December, then you have a really massive squad. ""With the number of competitions involved, everybody thinks they have a chance to play. That is what is the most important. As long as you fight for things, everybody keeps the focus."" Wenger also revealed England winger Theo Walcott will need a couple more weeks of recovery time following a minor surgical procedure on an abdominal problem. ""Theo had a set-back on Thursday. He had to stop, to jog again, I don't think we will see him against Dortmund, nor Crystal Palace nor Chelsea,"" he said. ""He is at least two weeks away now."" Despite their impressive 3-0 drubbing of Marseille in their last Champions League match, Dortmund arrive in London low on confidence after labouring on occasions in the Bundesliga this season. They ground out a 1-0 win against Hanover on Saturday, with Germany winger Marco Reus netting a penalty after four minutes. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp conceded his side weakened as the game went on, allowing Hanover opportunities to snatch an equaliser, but he expects them to be more dynamic against Arsenal. ""We should be a step further on Tuesday, we know we can play better football (than we did against Hanover) and we will too. I have a good feeling,"" said Klopp, who will be absent from the bench at Arsenal as he completes a two-game suspension for verbally abusing the fourth official during his team's loss to Napoli."
1214,21/10/2013,02:05,"Football: Arsenal, Barca look to build on perfect starts",Arsenal and Barcelona are two of the sides looking to make it three wins out of three when the Champions League resumes this week.,"AFP Sports looks at Tuesday's matches: Group E Steaua Bucharest (ROM) v Basel (SUI) Steaua Bucharest, the 1986 champions, are looking for their first points in the Champions League this season after defeats to Schalke and Chelsea. The Bucharest club, who won their 24th Romanian title last season, have won just four of their 38 group matches over seven campaigns, picking up 11 draws. Their last victory came at Dynamo Kiev in 2006 while their most recent home win was against Widzew Lodz in 1996. Basel, semi-finalists in the Europa League last season, could not build on their surprise 2-1 matchday one victory at Chelsea, losing 1-0 at home to group leaders Schalke last time out. They currently lead the Swiss league. Schalke (GER) v Chelsea (ENG) Chelsea and Schalke last met in the 2007/08 group stage, with the match in Germany ending scoreless while the English club were 2-0 victors at Stamford Bridge thanks to Florent Malouda and Didier Drogba. Schalke are hoping to welcome back goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand from a back injury, while US midfielder Jermaine Jones and Ghana star Kevin-Prince Boateng should be fit after knee injuries. But Schalke look to be without defensive midfielder Marco Hoeger, who twisted his knee against Braunschweig in the 3-2 win at the weekend. Chelsea badly need a win in Gelsenkirchen to build on their 4-0 win at Steaua Bucharest. Chelsea are unbeaten in their last six games since their shock defeat at home to Basel and have scored 10 goals in their last three games. Ashley Cole is likely to miss the match after suffering a rib injury while Germany winger Andre Schuerrle, who missed Saturday's 4-1 win over Cardiff with a thigh injury, could return along with Spain striker Fernando Torres. Group F Arsenal (ENG) v Borussia Dortmund (GER) Premier League leaders Arsenal and Dortmund, last season's Champions League runners-up, faced each other in 2011-2012 when two Robin van Persie strikes gave Arsenal the points at home despite Shinji Kagawa's injury-time reply. Van Persie and Ivan Perisic were on the scoresheet in a 1-1 draw in the return game. The Gunners are in the group stage for the 16th season in a row. For the sixth time in eight campaigns they had to negotiate a qualifying round, dispatching Fenerbahce 5-0 on aggregate in the play-offs with in-form Aaron Ramsey scoring three times. Arsenal have managed to move to the top of the Premier League, two points ahead of Chelsea and Liverpool, without a number of key players such as Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lukas Podolski. Mathieu Flamini may miss Tuesday's game after suffering concussion in Saturday's 4-1 win over Norwich. Dortmund are second in the Bundesliga, a point behind Bayern Munich, after a hard-fought 1-0 win at home to Hanover on Saturday. The German side are without midfielder Nuri Sahin who has an ankle injury. Marseille (FRA) v Napoli (ITA) Brazilian defender Lucas Mendes will miss the game after suffering an ankle injury in Friday's 1-0 defeat at Nice. With two defeats from their first two Group F matches, Marseille must beat the Italians to keep their knock-out stage hopes alive. Napoli could be without Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuain who has a thigh strain. Goran Pandev is likely to start for a Napoli team who have so far beaten Borussia Dortmund but lost to Arsenal. Group G Porto (POR) v Zenit St Petersburg (RUS) Zenit's record signing Hulk will make an emotional return to the club where he scored 78 goals. The 27-year-old Brazilian has started to show form for Zenit this term, after a troubled first season where some of his team-mates objected to his wages, scoring seven goals in eight league appearances. Zenit are on a hot streak with seven league successive wins but have just a single point from their European campaign. Porto have three points and will be looking to preserve their unbeaten home record against Russian sides which stands at five, although the last time these two were in the same group, it was Zenit who progressed to the last-16. Austria Vienna (AUT) v Atletico Madrid (ESP) Atletico suffered their first league defeat of the season, 1-0 at Espanyol on Saturday. Diego Simeone's men have two wins from two in the Champions League, including an impressive come from behind victory at Porto. Atletico are likely to be without Brazilian youngster Leo Baptistao, who has a sprained ankle, and will most likely be replaced by 25-year-old Diego Costa, who has missed two games through suspension, but is the Liga leading scorer with 10 goals. He will be keener than ever to impress Spanish coach Vicente del Bosque as he seeks to get into the squad for next year's World Cup finals in his birthplace of Brazil. Group H Celtic (SCO) v Ajax (NED) The Scottish champions desperately need a result in the first of two clashes with Ajax, but will be without captain Scott Brown, who is suspended following his red card against Barcelona, and Kris Commons, who went off early in their draw with Hibs on Saturday with a hamstring strain. Winger James Forrest looks set to start after scoring a fine goal. Ajax drew 1-1 with league leaders Twente on Saturday and will be looking to at the very least put themselves in position for the Europa League spot having garnered one point in a 1-1 draw with Milan in their previous match. AC Milan (ITA) v Barcelona (ESP) Milan could count themselves fortunate to have grabbed a point against Ajax, a last minute penalty by Mario Balotelli forcing the draw. However, the talented striker is likely to be a key absentee as he suffered a thigh injury in last week's World Cup qualifier with Armenia. However, they are also likely to have to call on third choice goalkeeper Marco Amelia as Christian Abbiati is injured and Gabriel, who played on Saturday, was not on the list of the Champions League squad. Barcelona, looking for their third win in three group games, failed to score in a league match for the first time since January 2012 with a 0-0 draw with Osasuna. Carles Puyol made his first start after a seven-month absence due to knee surgery while four-time world player of the year Lionel Messi came on for the final quarter after sitting out several games with a thigh strain."

Hamburg captain Rafael van der Vaart earned his side a point when he equalised for the third time for the hosts on 67 minutes on Van Marwijk's home debut. Stuttgart spent the last six minutes with 10 men after Germany Under-21 centre-back Antonio Ruediger was shown a straight red for hitting Dutch midfielder Van der Vaart in the ribs. ""We have improved again and are playing football the way I like it,"" said Van Marwijk as Hamburg rallied at 3-2 down after ex-Arsenal defender Johan Djourou conceded a second-half own goal. ""We had a couple of really nice attacks, which pleased me. We had a bit of bad luck with the own goal."" After a draw at Frankfurt and a 5-0 hammering of Nuremberg, the point kept Hamburg 15th, having been in the bottom three when Van Marwijk took over, while Stuttgart are eighth. Wolfsburg moved up to ninth with a 2-1 win at Augsburg with Wolves ex-Bayern Munich midfielder Luiz Gustavo heading the first-half winner. On Saturday, European champions Bayern extended their unbeaten Bundesliga run to 34 games by coming from behind for a 4-1 home win over Mainz to go back to the top. Having last lost in the German league back in October 2012, Bayern are now just two matches short of equalling Hamburg's 30-year-old, 36-match streak. Bayern were punished for a poor first-half in Munich when Mainz striker Shawn Parker fired home after capitalising on a mistake by centre-back Jerome Boateng. But Bayern roared back when Germany midfielder Mario Goetze came off the bench for the second-half and played a key part in the hosts' first three second-half goals. His dream pass through to Arjen Robben allowed the winger to equalise on 50 minutes and two minutes later, Goetze combined with the Dutchman for Germany's Thomas Mueller to fire home to make it 2-1. With Bayern finally making their 80 percent possession pay off, Goetze fired in a cross for Mario Mandzukic to score their third on 69 minutes. And when Bayern vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was fouled in the area, Mueller stepped up to drill home the penalty for his second of the game eight minutes from time. Bayer Leverkusen had briefly gone top on Friday thanks to a controversial 'phantom' goal in their 2-1 win at Hoffenheim. The German Football Federation (DFB) will investigate on Monday while Hoffenheim have called for a replay after Stefan Kiessling's 70th-minute winner came in bizarre circumstances. Replays showed his header only ended in the back of the net after flying through a hole in the side netting. Schalke 04, who host Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday, needed a 91st-minute winner from Roman Neustaedter to seal a 3-2 win at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Dortmund, who are at Arsenal on Tuesday in the Champions League, stayed second with a hard-fought 1-0 win at home to Hanover 96. Germany winger Marco Reus hit the winning penalty after just four minutes when Hanover's Japan defender Hiroki Sakai fouled left-back Erik Durm in the area. Borussia stay second and level on 22 points with third-placed Leverkusen, just a point behind Bayern. Second-from-bottom Freiburg picked up a point with a goalless draw at Werder Bremen, while Eintracht Frankfurt drew 1-1 at home to Nuremberg."

But with the ball in the net, he was quickly congratulated by team mates and match official Dr Felix Brych, a FIFA referee, awarded the goal. A DFB sports court is set to meet on Monday to investigate the goal with Hoffenheim to lodge an appeal and Brych to file his report. ""It's a scandal. We are definitely going to protest,"" Hoffenheim director Alexander Rosen fumed to reporters after the match. ""That was no goal, there are no two ways about it."" There is a precedent for this unusual situation as a replay was ordered after Bayern Munich's Thomas Helmer was credited with a goal which didn't go in the net in a 2-1 win over Nuremberg in April 1994. Nuremburg lodged a complaint to the DFB but Bayern won the replay 5-0 on their way to clinching the title. Hoffenheim coach Markus Gisdol said he fully expects the game against Leverkusen to be replayed. ""I think we will see that game again, anything else would be a joke,"" he said. ""We can't have a replay for Bayern Munich but not one for Hoffenheim."" Referee Brych said he had no indication from any of the players that anything was wrong with the goal. ""I had a small amount of doubt but the reaction of the players was clear,"" said Brych. ""There was no indication (from them) that it could have been an irregular goal, therefore I awarded it. ""I had an exchange with Stefan Kiessling but nobody, including him, told me that it wasn't a goal. ""The ball was in the net and for everyone on the pitch it was a legitimate goal."" Having seen Kiessling's goal, ex-Germany defender Helmer, who scored Bayern's phantom goal 19 years ago, said the match has to be replayed. ""It's a matter of seconds and you don't always know for sure how the ball went in,"" Helmer told broadcaster Sport1. ""Kiessling would also have wondered, what do I do now, what happened? ""And these seconds decide whether he's a good lad or a bad boy, but the game must be replayed, there can be no question."" Leverkusen coach Sami Hyypia admitted it was not the ideal way for Bayer to go top of the league, although Bayern Munich or Borussia Dortmund can usurp them later on Saturday. ""During the game, I celebrated because I saw the ball was in the net,"" said the ex-Liverpool defender. ""Of course, it's a bit unpleasant to win like that. ""I can't do much about it, the referee makes the decisions."""

With Bayern leading the Bundesliga by a point and players returning from injury, competition is set to increase, but the Spanish coach is demanding patience. ""We will only fight for the (league) title at the end of the season if every player accepts my decisions -- otherwise we will have problems,"" he told Bayern's magazine. ""I support those who accept them, but those who don't want to understand them will often find themselves sitting in the stands."" Traditionally a strong mid-table side, Mainz have had an erratic start to the season, winning their first three league games then losing their next four before drawing with Hoffenheim a fortnight ago. Bayern midfielder Mario Goetze scored for Germany in Tuesday's 5-3 win over Stockholm and is back in contention for selection after an ankle injury. Goetze is hoping for an appearance against Mainz after a long lay-off having damaged his ankle after returning from April's hamstring injury at the start of the season. ""(The Sweden game) was important for me after so long out,"" said Goetze."" ""How long I will play for against Mainz is down to the coach. ""I'm just looking forwards and am excited about the future -- hopefully without injury."" Bayern, who host Czech side Viktoria Pilsen on Wednesday and are top of their Champions League group, are without Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri until December after he returned from international duty with a torn hamstring. Mainz are waiting on the fitness of striker Nicolai Mueller, who has six goals this season, after the 26-year-old twisted an ankle in training on Wednesday. Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel described the training ground accident as ""one of those awful moments"" and the guests need their top scorer at Munich's Allianz Arena. Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen have the chance to go top of the German league on Friday when they travel to mid-table Hoffenheim. With just a point separating the top three, second-placed Borussia Dortmund host fifth-placed Hanover 96 boosted by their injury worries having been eased by the international break. Midfielders Nuri Sahin, Marco Reus and Jonas Hofmann all returned to training on Wednesday. ""Things aren't as bad as they could have been,"" said coach Jurgen Klopp, who still has Lukasz Piszczek, Sebastian Kehl, Ilkay Gundogan and Mats Hummels on the injured list. With Dortmund away to Arsenal on Tuesday in the Champions League, Klopp needs a moral-boosting win over Hanover. Senegal striker Mame Diouf returned to full Hanover training on Tuesday, having torn a thigh muscle in September, and could feature at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. Hanover's Ivory Coast winger Didier Ya Konan is definitely out for the rest of the year after surgery on an ankle injury. Schalke 04 warm-up for their home Champions League Group E showdown with Chelsea next Tuesday at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Having picked up their first win at the eighth attempt at Wolfsburg a fortnight ago, Braunschweig will be eager to prove the three points they took at Wolves was no fluke."

The agreements reached for the Americas and Asia span a total of five seasons, beginning in 2015-16 and ending with the 2019-20 campaign. For the European nations, the two parties have agreed on a deal spanning the 2015-16 and the 2016-17 seasons.

""21st Century Fox is a global-scale partner that provides German football opportunities for worldwide exposure and future growth.

1227,15/10/2013,15:15,Football: Lewandowski saga becomes lost in translation,"Poland's Robert Lewandowski will be bidding to hamper England's hopes of booking a World Cup place on Tuesday, but the Borussia Dortmund forward's future plans appear lost in translation.","Hot-shot Lewandowski will line up at Wembley against the Three Lions with England needing a win to be sure of their place at Brazil 2014. Poland, who are fourth in Group H, have no chance of qualifying, but with 20,000 of their red-and-white decked fans expected in north London, they are out to spoil England's party. Lewandowski is one of Europe's top strikers after scoring 24 goals in 31 Bundesliga games last season plus ten in the Champions League, including all four in the 4-1 semi-final win over Real Madrid. With his Dortmund contract to expire in June, the Poland forward can leave Dortmund as a free agent at the end of the season. In the build-up to the England game, the 25-year-old, who was heavily linked to a transfer to Bayern Munich last season, blamed reports to that effect on a 'nieporozumienie' -- Polish for misunderstanding. ""I will be able to sign a contract (with any club] in January, but I have never said that I will sign a contract with Bayern. It was a misunderstanding,"" Lewandowski told Monday's Daily Telegraph. Having enthused to the English newspaper about how much he would one day ""like to play in the Premier League"", Lewandowski's comments contradict an answer he gave in German to a reporter last month. After Dortmund's German Cup win at second division 1860 Munich in September, Lewandowski was asked on television if he will confirm in January whether he will join Bayern Munich next July. ""Yes, because I can officially sign a new contract then,"" he replied. In a bid to keep him, Borussia have tripled his salary to a reported five million euros (US$6.75m) for the last ten months, but Monday's comments fired up a flurry of headlines in the British media. ""Lewandowski hints at Bayern snub, alerting United, City and Chelsea to January switch,"" wrote the Daily Mail. It's all a far cry from February when the German media was rife with ""Lewandowski to Bayern"" tales. Ex-Germany captain and Bayern midfielder Lothar Matthaeus insisted in his role as a German Sky Sports pundit that he had it on good authority that Lewandowski had agreed terms with Munich. And Der Spiegel, a high-brow weekly magazine, said a contract had already been signed between Bayern and Lewandowski, while his agent Maik Barthel was quoted in Bild as saying a deal was imminent. To confuse matters further, Spanish daily AS has now said Lewandowski is set to join Real Madrid in January's winter break for up to 13 million euros. ""He is an awesome player, I know that he wants to play for Real Madrid,"" AS quoted Real president Florentino Perez. Since taking charge of Bayern in June, coach Pep Guardiola has stayed true to his preference for a 'false nine' -- a lone striker who can drop deep into midfield. Guardiola has mainly used Mario Mandzukic, with Germany winger Thomas Mueller or veteran Claudio Pizarro also being used. ""I love this player,"" Guardiola enthused about the hard-working Mandzukic, rather than Lewandowski. The Croatian scored 15 goals in 23 league games last season and also netted for Bayern in the Champions League final win over Dortmund. It remains to be seen who Lewandowski plays for next season and with world football's governing body FIFA allowing clubs to approach players coming out of contract from January 1, there will be news soon."

The 78-year-old won a total of eight German league titles, six with Bayern and two with Moenchengladbach, and was Germany's assistant coach at the 1966 World Cup, when they lost the final 4-2 to England at Wembley. He steered Bayern to the European Cup in 1974, their first of three back-to-back titles, before joining Borussia Moenchengladbach, where he won the 1976 and 1977 Bundesliga titles. He also won the 1982 European Cup Winners' Cup with Barcelona, as well as the 1983 Copa del Ray, before returning to the Bundesliga and eventually retired from coaching in 2000. ""My husband has Parkinson's. If my Udo has been lying down for a few days, then he normally needs a wheelchair,"" his wife Hildegard told German daily Bild. ""There are days when Udo's state of mind is very unsteady."" Lattek has been in poor health since suffering a stroke in 2010 and having spent time in hospital recently, he is being cared for at home in Cologne."

Last week, the 46-year-old Klopp watched Dortmund's 3-0 home win over Olympique Marseille from the stands and will do the same at Emirates Stadium on October 22, having decided not to appeal UEFA's ban handed out on October 2. ""My main motivation is that I don't want to give the impression that I am trivialising my own misconduct or want to detract from it,"" Klopp explained to German newspaper Revier Sport. Klopp's place on the Dortmund bench in London will again be taken by assistant coach Zeljko Buvac after UEFA's written verdict arrived in Dortmund on Tuesday and club bosses on Wednesday opted not to lodge an appeal. With the international break coming up, Dortmund's next match is at home to Hanover 96 in the Bundesliga on October 19 and the pause comes at a perfect time for Klopp with 10 players injured, including Germany midfielders Marco Reus and Ilkay Gundogan. Reus has cried off Germany's World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in Cologne on Friday with an ankle injury, while Gundogan could miss the rest of the year with a trapped nerve, according to German daily Bild. Dortmund, second in the Bundesliga, have a busy finish to the month as they face the trip to London to face Arsenal on October 22, then travels to rivals Schalke in Gelsenkirchen four days later in the Bundesliga."

""It's great to get the hat-trick, but it's more important that things went so well for the team,"" said Lasogga, who claimed the fastest away hat-trick in Bundesliga history. This was only the second game for Van Marwijk, 61, who coached Holland to the 2010 World Cup final. He replaced Thorsten Fink last month after a disastrous start left Hamburg in the relegation places. The Dutchman has promised to tighten Hamburg's defence, but it was their attack which ran riot at Nuremberg. ""I like attacking football, although tactical discipline belongs to that and we still lose the ball too often, but it's getting better,"" said Van Marwijk, whose reign opened with a draw at Frankfurt last week. ""A 5-0 win doesn't happen every week, but it's important to help the self-confidence come back."" Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart opened the scoring with a superb scissor-kick volley on 17 minutes. The Hamburg captain then provided the final passes for Lasogga to fire home his first two goals while the ex-Hertha Berlin forward completed the hat-trick when he pounced on a loose ball and smashed his shot inside the inside post. Midfielder Tolgay Arslan bagged the fifth 16 minutes from time to leave Nuremberg reeling. The rout lifts Hamburg up to 14th, while Nuremberg slip into the bottom three.

Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno guaranteed a point for his side by denying Franck Ribery twice in as many second-half minutes, then Mario Goetze, while Thomas Mueller had a penalty appeal turned down. But Guardiola was a picture of frustration, brooding on the Bayern bench and drumming his fingers as Bayern enjoyed 27 shots on goal and 78 percent possession, but managed just a single goal. The point was enough to send Bayern top, with Leverkusen third, behind Borussia Dortmund. Fresh from their impressive 3-0 Champions League win over Marseille, Dortmund were set to claim an away point until a disastrous final 10-minute spell, triggered by Mats Hummels' red card. The Germany defender was sent off on 81 minutes after a reckless challenge on 'Gladbach's Norway midfielder Havard Nordtveit in the area. Germany striker Max Kruse netted the resulting penalty, then Brazilian forward Raffael hit their second four minutes from time to see 'Gladbach move up to fourth.

VfB Stuttgart dropped to seventh after their 1-1 draw at home to Werder Bremen while Hoffenheim stayed 10th with a 2-2 draw at Mainz. Eintracht Braunschweig, who have been bottom of the table since last season's promotion, picked up their first win of the season with a shock 2-0 victory at VfL Wolfsburg -- their first Bundesliga victory since 1985.

Germany are five-points clear at the top of Group C with two games left and need just a point against Ireland in Cologne on Friday to claim their place at Brazil 2014. But coach Joachim Loew is likely to be without Bender. ""Sven is black and blue, I must telephone Joachim Loew and see what he wants to do, then we'll see what happens after that,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. Germany centre-back Mats Hummels hindered his chances of returning to Loew's starting line-up by earning a red-card at 'Gladbach which turned the game against Dortmund. The 24-year-old, who lost his place in Loew's side last month following below-par performances, recklessly brought down Gladbach's Norway midfielder Havard Nordtveit in the area with the game goalless nine minutes from time. Germany striker Max Kruse netted the resulting penalty, then Brazilian Raffael added a second as Dortmund suffered their first league defeat of the season and lost top spot in the league. To add to Dortmund's woes, Turkey midfielder Nuri Sahin is likely to miss the next three weeks after tearing ligaments in his right ankle."

Dortmund dropped to second place, a point behind Bayern, and level on 19 points with third-placed Leverkusen.

Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno guaranteed a point for his side by denying Franck Ribery twice in as many second-half minutes, then Mario Goetze, while Thomas Mueller had a penalty appeal turned down. ""I had expected that I had a lot to do, because Bayern are an elite side,"" said Leno. ""For a goalkeeper, games like this are great as they are a chance to show what you can do.

Having thrashed Freiburg 5-0 at home on Saturday, Dortmund picked up where they left off in the Bundesliga with Poland striker Lewandowski scoring a double and Germany winger Marco Reus grabbing the other. ""We are satisfied with the result, but we have to repeat this performance the next time we come out,"" said Lewandowski, who netted twice to take his tally to 13 goals in 21 Champions League appearances. ""We executed our plan perfectly. ""Marseille didn't have any real chances today, which is very satisfying."" Having lost home and away to Marseille in their Champions League campaign two years ago, Dortmund gained some revenge at the Westfalenstadion. Dortmund had coach Jurgen Klopp confined to the stands after receiving a UEFA ban for verbally abusing the referee at Napoli a fortnight ago. ""It was a great game and we played well against a quality opponent,"" said Klopp, who was allowed no contact with his team before 15 minutes after the final whistle. ""Now we are in a solid position in our group. ""If the team plays the way they did today, I'm allowed to relax sitting in the stands."" Goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who was sent off in the first-half in Naples, was suspended allowing Australian Mitchell Langerak to start his first Champions League match. Compared to their 2011 defeat at home to Marseille, this was a different performance from Dortmund, who had raced in to a 2-0 lead, only to lose 3-2, conceding the winner three minutes from time, two years ago. ""Borussia Dortmund are a very good team, we had good intentions but performed below par,"" said Marseille defender Rod Fanni. The hosts took the lead with 19 minutes gone from a fast counter-attack with Marseille pushing forward from a free-kick. Dortmund's headline close season signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan put Reus into space and with the guests' defence in disarray, Germany Under-21 left-back Erik Durm, in for the injured Marcel Schmelzer, squared for Lewandowski. The Poland star, who became the first footballer to score four goals in a Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid last April, tapped home. Even though Elie Baup-coached OM just shaded the possession, they were outplayed in terms of scoring opportunities with Dortmund enjoying 18 shots on goal compared to the French side's seven. Reus claimed his goal on 52 minutes when he curled in a free-kick which Mandanda made a mess of saving,  the ball bobbling over the line. Lewandowski claimed his second when he drilled home a penalty after centre-back Nicolas N'Koulou hauled down Reus in the area 11 minutes from time."

With the Queenslander's family all tuned into the match in the early hours of Wednesday morning back in Australia, Langerak said he was delighted to get the win and shut Marseille out. ""Yes, I've talked to them (the family), I think it's 5 o'clock back home and I'm very happy that they've seen the game.,"" said Langerak. ""Today, it was incredible and I will remember this night all my life. ""I wanna thank all the guys for helping get the job done."" Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has said he has no concerns when he calls upon Langerak, who has won 13 of his 14 games in a Dortmund shirt with the Napoli defeat the only blot on his record. The Australian repaid Klopp's faith with three saves of OM's four shots on goal as Dortmund dominated. It was a more enjoyable experience than his unexpected Champions League debut at Napoli when he came on after Weidenfeller's dismissal in what turned out to be a painful baptism of fire. The Australian collided with the post when failing to stop a goal from Italy's Lorenzo Insigne to make it 2-1, which left Langerak with two chipped front teeth. But Langerak has other big games on the horizon and is set to make his international bow next week. With veteran goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer having been left out of the Australia squad for the friendlies against France in Paris and Canada in London, Langerak is set to make his Socceroos debut on October 11."

""It was a great game, Marseille are a strong team and you have to give it everything you have against them. ""My team were prepared to stick their foot in the door and make sure of the win. ""It was strange watching from the stands, but if they play like that every week, I could get used to it."" The stats showed the Dortmund team ran six kilometres more than their French rivals. ""I heard we ran more than Olympique Marseille, that shows how hard we worked for the win,"" added Klopp. Goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who was sent off in the first-half in Naples, was also suspended allowing Australian Mitchell Langerak to start his first Champions League match in a composed display.

Reus claimed his goal on 52 minutes when he curled in a towering free-kick which Mandanda parried, but the ball bobbled over the line and was smashed home by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for good measure. Lewandowski claimed his second and his 13th goal on his 21st Champions League appearance when he drilled home a penalty after centre-back Nicolas N'Koulou hauled down Reus in the area 11 minutes from time. It was just reward for Dortmund who had a clear penalty appeal turned down a minute into the second half when the ball deflected off OM left-back Benjamin Mendy's hand in the area.

1247,01/10/2013,14:28,"Football: 'Super, super' Guardiola's 100th day at Bayern","The plaudits flowed for Pep Guardiola as Tuesday marked his 100th day as Bayern Munich coach, but his team is yet to rediscover the domination of last season's treble-winning campaign.","Guardiola faces arguably the toughest test of his brief reign when the holders face Manchester City away in the Champions League on Wednesday. Having been unveiled as Bayern boss on June 24, Guardiola has led European champions Bayern to their UEFA Super Cup win over Chelsea on penalties and have dropped just two points in seven league games so far. ""His ideas are unbelievable, he is a coach who knows exactly how the players feel and think,"" enthused Bayern's Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger. Likewise, Bayern president Uli Hoeness, not one to gladly suffer fools or egotistical coaches, was just as enthusiastic. ""It's a huge amount of fun to work with him. He is a totally open person and wears his heart on his sleeve,"" said Hoeness. ""I am very happy that we have him here. ""During the meetings with him, you always feel that you're progressing in life."" Guardiola has poured on the charm by speaking passable German from his first day in office and punned the expression ""super, super, super"" to emphasis a particular positive point in interviews. But having insisted at his initial press conference that he would neither make significant early changes nor recruit players from his former club Barcelona, Guardiola soon did the exact opposite. With Guardiola's brother Pere as his agent, Spain Under-21 captain Thiago Alcantara moved from Barcelona to Bavaria while the treble-winning 4-2-3-1 system was abandoned for a 4-1-4-1 formation. Guardiola's competitive debut resulted in a 4-2 defeat at arch-rivals Borussia Dortmund for the German Super Cup at the end of July. Bayern then avenged their 2012 Champions League final defeat at home to Chelsea by beating the Blues in Prague in August for the UEFA Super Cup, but the Germans twice came from behind, including a 121st-minute equaliser from Javi Martinez. Part of the problem in Prague -- as it has been for most of the season -- has been Guardiola's insistence on a single defensive midfielder playing in front of the back-four. Last season, Schweinsteiger and Martinez formed a rock-solid midfield pairing, often shutting down opposition attacks before they even troubled the defence, as Bayern conceded 18 league goals all season. With both Martinez and Schweinsteiger having spent the opening weeks of the season recovering from minor operations, Guardiola has deployed captain Philipp Lahm as a single defensive midfielder. It has meant more space for the opposition to attack in front of the Bayern back-four and without that composure, Bayern's attacks have on occasion lacked sparkle, despite averaging 70 percent possession. Their 3-0 win at home to Russian champions CSKA Moscow and the 4-0 league win at Schalke in mid-September were the only times Bayern stamped their authority on a game. As Guardiola himself acknowledges, his main problem is ""that people are no longer satisfied with a 2-0 win"" and that ""you always have to play spectacular football and sweep away the opposition"". Guardiola's achievement of dropping only two league points in seven league matches pales next to last season's achievement of winning all eight opening games under predecessor Jupp Heynckes. Traditionally, Bayern's loudest critics come predominantly from within. Last month, director of sport Matthias Sammer stirred the waters by accusing the team of ""lethargic football"" and ""going through the motions"" before they responded by seeing off Moscow and Schalke. Guardiola insisted he has no problem with Sammer's criticism of his team while this week Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic relaunched his war-of-words by calling the Spaniard a ""coward"" who has ""no balls"". But regardless of such comments, the Bavarians under Guardiola remain the team to beat both in Germany and on the European stage. Having broken or equalled 25 Bundesliga records last season, Bayern are just four short of the league record of 36 games without defeat, set by Hamburg in the 1980s, and they last lost in the league on October 28 last year."
1248,01/10/2013,02:00,Football: Pellegrini readies Man City for Bayern test,Manuel Pellegrini faces the first major test of his Champions League credentials as Manchester City manager on Wednesday when his side tackle defending champions Bayern Munich at the Etihad Stadium.,"City have been eliminated from the Champions League at the group phase in the past two seasons and one of the reasons why Pellegrini was selected to succeed Roberto Mancini was his track record at continental level. Real Madrid went out in the last 16 under Pellegrini's stewardship in 2010, but he steered modest Villarreal to the semi-finals in 2006 and led Malaga to the quarter-finals last season. In all-conquering German and European champions Bayern, Pellegrini could not have asked for a more demanding first European home fixture with City. However, having worked in Spain for the duration of Bayern coach Pep Guardiola's spectacular four-year tenure at Barcelona, the 60-year-old Chilean believes he knows how to get the better of him. ""It is very difficult at this moment to improve with Bayern because they won the last three competitions, but he (Guardiola) will find a way because he is a very good manager,"" said Pellegrini. ""He knows the way we play, so he will try different things. But we know things about Guardiola, too. I lived in Spain nine years so I know exactly the way Guardiola plays."" Both teams opened their Group D campaigns with 3-0 victories, Bayern overwhelming CSKA Moscow at the Allianz Arena and City scoring three second-half goals away to Czech champions Viktoria Pilsen. City blew a 2-1 lead in a 3-2 loss at Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday, but Pellegrini will hope to recall David Silva and Sergio Aguero after both players missed the trip to Villa Park through injury. Captain Vincent Kompany has downplayed the significance of the defeat, which left the 2012 English champions five points behind early leaders Arsenal after six games. ""We have lost games before. Every team in the world has lost games,"" he said. ""It is about the reaction, what you do next game. If anything, I think we will be more motivated now to make it right."" Bayern have experienced no such problems in the early stages of their Bundesliga title defence, having won six and drawn one of their first seven games to leave them level on points with leaders Borussia Dortmund. However, Guardiola's attempts to introduce a new 4-1-4-1 formation have not proved an unqualified success and his side laboured to overcome Wolfsburg in Saturday's 1-0 victory in Munich. The Catalan coach acknowledged the teething problems after the game, admitting that Bayern need to ""find solutions to a few problems"". Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, though, says City's possession-oriented style could unwittingly hand Bayern a chance to shine. ""We'll meet them eye to eye,"" said the Germany international. ""City are a team who like to have the ball. They want to control the game and not just hit us on the counter-attack, like all our other opponents. ""That will give us a chance to show our qualities."" Guardiola could call upon close-season signing Mario Gotze, who was an unused substitute against Wolfsburg after overcoming an ankle problem he sustained in August's UEFA Super Cup success against Chelsea. The sides last met in the group phase two years ago, when Bayern won 2-0 in Munich and then lost by the same scoreline in the return game after they had already secured qualification for the round of 16. City missed out on a last-16 place by only a point that season, but last term they finished eight points below the qualification berths after failing to win a single game against Dortmund, Real Madrid and Ajax. City have not lost a European home game for five years, but Bayern enjoyed success on their two trips to England last season, beating Arsenal in the last 16 before overcoming Dortmund in the all-German final at Wembley."
1249,30/09/2013,19:10,Football: Langerak eager for European start with Dortmund,Borussia Dortmund's Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak is relishing his first Champions League start on Tuesday against  Marseille despite chipping two teeth in Naples a fortnight ago.,"The 25-year-old came off the bench for his first Champions League appearance when Roman Weidenfeller was sent off just before half-time in the 2-1 defeat by Napoli. Langerak immediately saved a free-kick, but was powerless to prevent Lorenzo Insigne smashing home a second-half free-kick for the winning goal, with painful consequences. The Australian chipped two front teeth on the post as he dived to try and stop the free-kick, but admitted the defeat hurt more than the injury. ""It hurt, but the defeat was worse,"" said Langerak, who joined Dortmund from A-League side Melbourne Victory in 2010. ""It wasn't an easy match to come on in, it didn't go as well as we wanted. ""It's never ideal to lose your first game, but we've got a chance to make things right."" With Weidenfeller suspended for the Marseille game, Langerak will be between the posts at Signal Iduna Park and coach Jurgen Klopp has belief in him. ""We are in the comfortable situation that when Roman Weidenfeller drops out, then there is no need for sleepless nights with Mitch around,"" said Klopp. The statistics support Klopp's confidence: Langerak has won 12 of his 13 games in a Dortmund shirt, including coming off the bench to help Borussia beat Bayern Munich 5-2 in last year's German Cup final. With veteran Mark Schwarzer having blocked his path to the Australia team, Langerak is set to make his debut in October's friendlies against France in Paris and Canada in London. ""Mitchell Langerak deserves to play in at least one of those games, he's earned it,"" Australia's coach Holger Osieck has said. At 33, Weidenfeller is showing no signs of giving second best and is pushing for a place in the Germany squad, but Klopp knows Langerak wants to be number one. ""There is no question that an exceptional goalkeeper like Mitch wants to be first-choice,"" said Klopp."
1250,30/09/2013,02:35,Football: Dortmund eager to see off Marseille,Borussia Dortmund host Olympique Marseille on Tuesday with both sides badly needing a win after opening defeats to keep alive their hopes of reaching the Champions League's knock-out phase.,"Having lost to Bundesliga rivals Bayern Munich in last season's final, Dortmund got off to a bad start a fortnight ago, losing 2-1 at Napoli in their Group F opener as Marseille went down 2-1 at Arsenal. It was a bad night in Naples for Borussia as centre-back Mats Hummels limped off with a leg injury, goalkeeper Ronen Weidenfeller was sent off and coach Jurgen Klopp was sent to the stands for berating the referee. Weidenfeller is suspended for Tuesday's match at Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park, while Klopp will be in the stands having been given a one-mtach ban from the bench by European football's governing body UEFA. In the wake of their Napoli defeat, Klopp insisted: ""We definitely didn't produce our best display, but nothing is lost yet"" but another defeat on Tuesday would seriously dampen Dortmund's European ambitions. The Germans are chasing some Champions League revenge against Marseille after Dortmund and OM went head-to-head in the group stages two years ago with Marseille prevailing 3-0 at home and 3-2 away. Borussia warmed-up for the French visit with a 5-0 drubbing of Freiburg on Saturday to stay top of the Bundesliga on goal difference from European champions Bayern. Germany winger Marco Reus and striker Robert Lewandowski both scored twice in the rout with the Poland striker admitting Dortmund had targeted a big win to throw down the gauntlet for Marseille. ""We wanted to put the result beyond doubt in the first half (against Freiburg), because we know we have a tough game ahead of us in the Champions League,"" said Lewandowski. ""That is what our main concentration is on now, but despite of that we were very happy to get three more points against Freiburg."" Dortmund face Marseille without Germany left-back Marcel Schmelzer, who is out for three weeks after tearing a thigh muscle in training on Friday. Schmelzer should be available again in time for Dortmund's away game against Arsenal on October 22, but is likely to miss Germany's World Cup qualifiers against the Republic of Ireland and Sweden next month. Germany midfielder Sven Bender should be able to play, despite missing the second-half against Freiburg with a shoulder injury after landing on the joint from a header. Marseille warmed-up for Dortmund with a 2-0 win at Lorient on Saturday to stay third in the French league with Mathieu Valbuena and Andre Ayew scoring second-half goals. Defender Jeremy Morel has been sidelined with a knee injury while striker Andre-Pierre Gignac is unlikely to play as he recovers from a toe problem and has missed the last two games."
1251,30/09/2013,02:30,"Football: Chelsea face 'must-win' match, Arsenal flying high",Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho believes Tuesday's Champions League trip to Steaua Bucharest is a match they cannot lose while Premier League leaders Arsenal take on Napoli for the first time.,"AFP Sports looks at all eight of Tuesday's fixtures on matchday two: Group E Basel (SUI) v Schalke (GER) Basel, who made the Europa League semi-finals last season, stunned 2012 champions Chelsea 2-1 at Stamford Bridge in their opener with goals from Mohamed Salah and Marco Streller. It was the first win for a Swiss club on English soil in 20 attempts. Basel lead the Swiss league but were held to a 2-2 draw by Sion. The last time Basel faced a German side they lost 7-0 to Bayern Munich in a last-16 second leg tie in 2011-2012. Schalke were also winners on matchday one, beating Steaua Bucharest 3-0. But the German side are only mid-table in the Bundesliga and on Saturday surrendered a 2-0 lead against Hoffenheim to draw 3-3. Kevin-Prince Boateng, man of the match against the Romanians, was on the scoresheet on Saturday. Steaua Bucharest (ROM) v Chelsea (ENG) Chelsea warmed-up for Tuesday's tie by drawing 1-1 at London rivals Spurs in a match which saw Fernando Torres sent-off and John Terry score his team's only goal. Juan Mata will start the match that coach Jose Mourinho says is a game Chelsea can't afford to lose. Steaua beat Chelsea 1-0 last season in the Europa League round of 16 first leg. Mata levelled the overall scores at Stamford Bridge before Vlad Chiriches restored Steaua's aggregate lead. But Terry and Torres struck to take the Londoners through. The Romanians are playing in the group stage for the first time since the 2008-2009 season. Their last victory came at Dinamo Kiev in September, 2006. Group F Arsenal v Napoli The Gunners' remarkable turnaround after an opening day defeat to Aston Villa in the Premier League has seen them reel off nine consecutive wins, including a 2-1 victory away to Marseille in their Group F curtain raiser. Arsene Wenger celebrated his 17th anniversary as Arsenal boss with a 2-1 win away to Swansea over the weekend with in-form midfielder Aaron Ramsey on target for a fourth game running. Theo Walcott is sidelined, but Czech midfielder Tomas Rosicky could return after a month out. Rafael Benitez's Napoli are also off to a strong start in Italy's Serie A, having dropped just two points from a possible 18. Benitez will have a rested Marek Hamsik to call upon. Borussia Dortmund v Marseille Last season's finalists Borussia Dortmund are off to a flying start in the Bundesliga with six wins from seven matches, including a 5-0 thrashing of Freiburg on Saturday. However, Jurgen Klopp's men have work to do on the European stage after slumping to a 2-1 defeat at Napoli a fortnight ago. Goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who was sent off in Italy, is banned while left-back Marcel Schmelzer is sidelined with a thigh problem. Marseille's first trip to Signal Iduna Park two seasons ago culminated with a dramatic late winner from Mathieu Valbuena as the visitors came from two goals down to win 3-2 and qualify for the round of 16. Group G Zenit Saint Petersbug v Austria Vienna Both sides will be desperate to take all three points, having lost their openers to Atletico Madrid and FC Porto. Zenit, who lost 3-0 in Madrid, will be the more confident of the two, playing at home just a few days after going top of the Russian Premier League thanks to a 4-2 win over Spartak Moscow. Alexander Kerzhakov became the all-time leading scorer in the Russian league in that game as he notched his 208th career goal. Austria Vienna, 1-0 losers at home to FC Porto, went down 1-0 at Admira and are in fifth position in the top flight league. They are playing in the Champions League Group stages for the first time. FC Porto v Atletico Madrid Atletico have made a fantastic start to the campaign with six consecutive wins in all competitions, culminating in a first league victory over Real Madrid for 14 years on Saturday. Unfortunately for Diego Simeone's men, talisman Diego Costa is unavailable as he serves the final match of his four-game European ban. His absence is likely to mean a first ever Atletico start for Leo Baptistao, who scored in the Spanish side's 3-1 victory over Zenit St Petersburg two weeks ago. Porto sit two points clear of Sporting Lisbon at the top of the Portuguese league after six games. However, Paulo Fonseca's men will have bad memories of facing Spanish opposition after being dumped out at the quarter-final stage by Malaga last season. Group H Ajax v AC Milan Ajax will be looking to bounce back from the 4-0 mauling they suffered at the hands of Barcelona and can hold out some hope against an Italian side that has won just twice in six Serie A games. Ajax warmed up for the match with a 6-0 thrashing of Go Ahead Eagles to leave them a point off leaders PSV Eindhoven. An injury-hit Milan will be seeking to secure their second successive win in the competition -- they beat Celtic 2-0 in their opener. Celtic v Barcelona Celtic gave Scottish football a rare moment of joy last season when they recorded an historic 2-1 win over Barcelona in the Champions League group stage. This time round Celtic manager Neil Lennon is not expecting a repeat. However, Barcelona will be without Lionel Messi who suffered a thigh injury in Saturday's 2-0 win over Almeria. With his tough tackling compatriot Javier Mascherano also out of the match with a hamstring injury it poses some problems for coach Gerardo Martino. Defeat for Celtic would be their 100th in all European club competitions."

Guardiola took off Arjen Robben, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mario Mandzukic in the second-half with one eye on the trip to England, but Bayern were far from impressive.

Lewandowski then netted his fourth goal of the season when he held off two defenders to chip the ball over Baumann with half an hour left. The Poland forward -- who has said he will sign a Bayern Munich contract in January with his Dortmund contract to expire in June -- then added his second when he converted a Jonas Hoffmann pass on 70 minutes.

""We were a bit insecure at the start, but we did a better job after the break. ""I've known the coach for a long time, he has a lot of experience and I'm glad he's here."" Schalke, who are at FC Basel in the Champions League on Tuesday, were held to a thrilling 3-3 draw at Hoffenheim while Hertha Berlin moved up to fifth after coming from behind to beat Mainz 05 3-1 in the capital."

Dortmund ran riot at Signal Iduna Park with Germany winger Marco Reus and Poland striker Robert Lewandowski scoring twice before Polish midfielder Jakub Blaszczykowski added the fifth 10 minutes from time. ""I was already happy with the first-half. We had wanted to find our rhythm from the first second, which we did,"" said Klopp. ""We put in a good performance and it was a lot of fun to watch."" Dortmund broke the deadlock on 35 minutes when Lewandowski's shot was blocked by Freiburg goalkeeper Oliver Baumann, but Reus was on hand to tap home the loose ball. Freiburg's fortunes took a sharp downturn when Senegalese centre-back Fallou Diagne was sent off after hauling down Lewandowski and Reus drilled home the resulting spot-kick in the 47th minute. Lewandowski then netted his fourth goal of the season when he held off two defenders to chip the ball over Baumann with half an hour left. The Poland forward -- who has said he will sign a Bayern Munich contract in January with his Dortmund contract to expire in June -- then added his second when he converted a Jonas Hoffmann pass on 70 minutes. Dortmund, who host Marseille in the Champions League on Tuesday looking to bounce back from their 2-1 defeat at Napoli a fortnight ago, added the fifth when Blaszczykowski pounced on a wayward back pass and fired past Baumann 10 minutes before the whistle. The defeat keeps Freiburg second from bottom and still looking for their first win of the season. Ahead of Wednesday's Champions League match at Manchester City, Bayern stuttered to a 1-0 win over Wolfsburg. ""We won, but we must improve a few things,"" admitted Guardiola ahead of the trip to Manchester and next Saturday's Bundesliga clash at third-placed Bayer Leverkusen. ""I am certain that we will put in a good performance in Manchester and Leverkusen."" Bayern needed an hour to break the deadlock as Germany star Thomas Mueller netted his first Bundesliga goal of the season when he met Franck Ribery's pass from the left wing at the far post. This was a far from polished performance from Bayern who failed to dominate, despite enjoying their customary 70 percent possession. Bayer Leverkusen stayed third, just a point behind Dortmund and Bayern, with a 2-0 win at home to Hanover 96 as Germany midfielders Simon Rolfes and Sidney Sam scored first-half goals.

1262,27/09/2013,02:20,Football: Wolves face tough task against on-song Bayern,VfL Wolfsburg admit they face an uphill task in their bid to try and stop Bayern Munich's march to the top of the Bundesliga table on Saturday.,"Bayern are on a 31-match unbeaten streak in the Bundesliga and last tasted defeat at home to Bayer Leverkusen in October 2012. Pep Guardiola's side go into the weekend's matches in second place in the table, trailing leaders Borussia Dortmund on goals scored before facing the Wolves at the Allianz Arena. Having blitzed Schalke 4-0 in Gelsenkirchen last Saturday in the league and routed Hanover 96 4-1 in the German Cup on Wednesday, Bayern are showing signs of further progress under Guardiola since he succeeded Jupp Heynckes as head coach in June. Bayern saw off Hanover with a side featuring the likes of Diego Contento, Xherdan Shaqiri, Daniel van Buyten and Claudio Pizarro as Guardiola rotated his squad before Saturday's visit of the Wolves and next Wednesday's Champions League clash away to Manchester City. However, the reigning European champions want more silverware and are endlessly looking for ways to improve, so there was a little frustration with the nature of Wednesday's performance. ""We shifted down a gear after going 2-0 up and Hanover were immediately right back in the game, we can't let that happen again,"" said Thomas Mueller, who scored twice in the German Cup second-round win. In contrast, Wolfsburg team manager Mike Schuessler admitted he ""didn't find many weaknesses"" after watching Guardiola's Bayern, while director of sport Klaus Allofs said: ""We'll need a good performance to get a result there."" Ex-Bayern midfielder Luiz Gustavo will be back in the Wolfsburg side after serving a one-match ban while another former Munich star, Ivica Olic, should be able to play despite carrying an ankle injury and Brazilian midfielder Diego should be fit too. Bayern have no new injury concerns with Spain midfielders Javi Martinez and Thiago Alcantara working their way back to fitness after minor operations. Elsewhere, league leaders Dortmund host Freiburg on Saturday with a question mark over left-back Marcel Schmelzer after the Germany defender aggravated a thigh injury in the 2-0 German Cup win over second-division 1860 Munich. Schmelzer is back in training, ""but whether that is enough for Saturday, we'll have to see,"" said coach Jurgen Klopp, whose team face Marseille in the Champions League next Tuesday. Dortmund are definitely without right-back Lukasz Piszczek, who is recovering from hip and groin surgery, midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, who has a back injury, and captain Sebastian Kehl, who has torn ankle ligaments. Dortmund dropped their first points of the season in last Saturday's 1-1 draw at Nuremberg, while Freiburg have yet to win a match this season after three draws and three defeats. Bayer Leverkusen boss Sami Hyypia has said there will be changes to his team on Saturday at fourth-place Hanover 96 ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Spain's Real Sociedad. However, Australia's Robbie Kruse is looking to make his second start for the club after netting twice in last Saturday's 4-1 rout of Mainz. Ex-Holland coach Bert van Marwijk has taken charge at struggling Hamburg, and the Hanseatic club are looking for only their second win of the season as they go to Eintracht Frankfurt. HSV are already in the relegation zone after a disastrous start to the season and the 61-year-old van Marwijk was named as Thorsten Fink's successor on Monday after signing a two-year deal worth 1.4 million euros ($1.9 million) a year. ""My mission is to look at the structures in place and clarify the style of play,"" said Van Marwijk, who inherits a side who have been routed 5-1 and 6-2 by Hoffenheim and Dortmund respectively this season. ""We have to leave the bottom of the table as quickly as possible."" Fixtures (kick-offs 1330 GMT unless stated)"

Guardiola's Bayern are second, but level on both points and goal difference with league leaders Dortmund, who host second-from-bottom Freiburg on Saturday, and the Bavarians are eager to finish the weekend on top. Bayern face Manchester City on Wednesday in their second Champions League match and want to make sure of another three points against sixth-placed Wolfsburg. ""Only a win will count for us against Wolfsburg,"" insisted captain Philipp Lahm after Munich's 4-1 win over Hanover 96 on Wednesday sent them into the third round of the German Cup. ""We can be very happy with our recent performances, we are definitely on the right path."" Germany star Thomas Mueller scored twice against Hanover while veteran striker Claudio Pizarro, who netted a first-half goal, said Bayern are hitting form under Guardiola but must keep improving with City looming. ""When we use our chances, we are difficult to stop, but after going 2-0 up against Hanover, we stopped doing that,"" said the 34-year-old. ""It was okay to do that against Hanover but against a bigger team it can be deadly and we mustn't allow that to happen."" Having been 2-1 up at halftime, Bayern pulled away in the second half with a second goal from Mueller before France winger Franck Ribery hit their fourth. Guardiola, who succeeded Jupp Heynckes as Bayern coach in June after the team won the treble of European, league and cup titles last season, said he was pleased to see Munich's fighting spirit come out. ""We played well, although in the last ten to 15 minutes of the first-half we lost our shape,"" said Guardiola. ""But I was surprised how we played in the second half. With our mentality, we started playing forwards again."" With five goals after the first two rounds of the German Cup, Bayern's Mueller again showed lethal finishing against Hanover. ""He is always dangerous, whether he scores with the head, chest or shoulder,"" said Lahm, after Mueller's first goal flew in off his chest."

The Bundesliga leaders dominated their second-tier opponents were made to wait until the 105th minute before they broke the deadlock through a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang penalty after Dominik Stahl was sent off.

Despite making a bright start, Jens Keller's Schalke undid all their good work as first Munich vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger, then striker Mario Mandzukic were left unmarked in the area to head home. Schweinsteiger, back in the starting side after straining ankle ligaments last month, smashed home Arjen Robben's corner on 21 minutes and 60 seconds later, Mandzukic converted David Alaba's cross. France winger Franck Ribery and then replacement striker Claudio Pizarro added late goals as Schalke's four-match winning run came to an abrupt halt. Bayern have now gone 31 games without losing a Bundesliga match and have recorded 26 league wins and five draws since losing 2-1 loss to Leverkusen in October 2012. Having won their first five league games, Dortmund stumbled as left-back Marcel Schmelzer's first-half free-kick was cancelled out by Nuremberg centre-back Per Nilsson's second-half strike.

Hamburg slumped to their fourth Bundesliga defeat in six games on Saturday when they lost 2-0 at home to Werder Bremen. Fink was fired on Tuesday after his team's 6-2 drubbing at Borussia Dortmund. On Friday, Hamburg's Dutch captain Rafael van der Vaart heaped praise on Van Marwijk, who coached Holland from 2008 until 2012 and spent two years in the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund from 2004 until 2006. ""I know Bert van Marwijk from the national squad, he is a good coach, I can't say enough good things about him,"" said the midfielder. Fink was sacked after nearly two years in charge and Rodolfo Cardoso, the reserve team coach, has taken over in a caretaker role.

Since his arrival from AC Milan last month, Kevin-Prince Boateng has helped lift Schalke up to ninth with the Ghana international adding some steel to their attacking midfield. The 26-year-old scored the winner at Mainz last Saturday in a 1-0 victory and hit the second goal in Wednesday's 3-0 Champions League victory over Steaua Bucharest. European champions Bayern will provide an acid test of Schalke's winning streak, but there promises to be fireworks when the Boateng brothers clash. ""He is my brother, but there will be no love lost in the game,"" said Berlin-born Kevin-Prince Boateng. ""I have already told him I would be disappointed if he didn't go at me 100 percent during the game. I will be doing the same."" Bayern have dropped just two points from their first five Bundesliga games and opened the defence of their Champions League title on Tuesday with a 3-0 win at home to CSKA Moscow. Jerome Boateng, 25, has said he will be hoping to leave Gelsenkirchen with three more league points and will not take a backward step against his sibling. ""I'll try and do that without bringing him down, but if there is no other way, I'll do it,"" said the Bayern star. ""He won't run away from me."" Bayern travel to north-west Germany from Bavaria as clear favourites, but Kevin-Prince is defiant. ""For the game in Schalke, anything is possible."" The last time the brothers played each other was the 2010 World Cup group stage match when Germany beat Ghana 1-0 in Johannesburg. ""It's a big thing for us that we can play against each other at such a high level,"" said Kevin-Prince. Bayern will still be without several stars at Schalke. Spain midfielder Javi Martinez missed training on Thursday and Friday for a dental operation, while Germany midfielder Mario Goetze is training after an ankle injury. Both will miss the Schalke game, although vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger should feature having come on in the win over Moscow. Schalke are still without Holland striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who is recovering from a knee injury, with Hungary striker Adam Szalai deputising. League leaders Dortmund head to Nuremberg looking to preserve their 100 percent record, and earn their sixth victory in the process, but centre-back Mats Hummels is rated highly doubtful. The 24-year-old came off with a back injury in the 2-1 defeat at Napoli in Wednesday's Champions League defeat. ""I don't think it'll be ready in time,"" admitted Hummels. Hamburg host Werder Bremen with caretaker coach Rodolfo Cardoso in charge after Torsten Fink was sacked in the wake of last Saturday's 6-2 drubbing at Dortmund.

""We played well, we controlled the game with our pressing and I am proud of the players,"" said Guardiola. ""People think it'll be easy for us this year having won the title last season, but that's not how it is."" ""We kept the ball well in midfield and we play better when that is the case."" After Bayern beat Hanover 2-0 on Saturday, director of sport Matthias Sammer accused Guardiola's team of playing ""lacklustre football"", but the Spaniard said he had no problem with the comments. ""I speak to Matthias on a daily basis and he has given me a lot of support since my arrival,"" said Guardiola. ""We talk all the time, we talk about the team, we talk tactics, even about the pasta and the fish we had for lunch. ""There's nothing we wouldn't talk about."" Austria's Alaba was outstanding throughout, hitting a pin-point free-kick for the opening goal, then playing a deft chip over the Moscow defence for Robben to slam home Bayern's third. ""It felt good to score, it was great to hear the Champions League anthem before the game and know that it's starting again,"" said Robben. ""We have to take things step by step, get through the group stages and take it from there."" After Jupp Heynckes led Bayern to the treble of Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League last season, Guardiola has been under pressure to continue that success since taking charge in June. After winning 14 titles in four years at Barcelona -- including the 2009 and 2011 Champions League titles -- the Spaniard has been the centre of much hype since his arrival in Bavaria. Having changed Bayern's formation, Guardiola has won four of his five Bundesliga games so far, despite missing stars Javi Martinez, Thiago Alcantara and Mario Goetze through injury. This was arguably Bayern's most polished performance at home this season, even with vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger starting on the bench as he recovers from an ankle strain. Bayern needed just four minutes to get on the scoresheet when Alaba floated a beautiful free-kick over the Moscow wall and out of reach of Moscow goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev. A second nearly followed on seven minutes when a superb pass from right-back Rafinha landed at Mandzukic's feet with the goal at his mercy, but Akinfeev blocked his shot. With Bayern dominating possession, the hosts peppered the CSKA goal and it was only a matter of time before the European champions added their second. Moments after beating Akinfeev with a powerful header which cannoned off the woodwork, Mandzukic was the first onto the end of a Robben free-kick to add the second four minutes from the half-time whistle. Replays showed three Bayern players were offside, but the relief was palpable on the Munich bench with Guardiola hugging his backroom staff. CSKA, the Russian league, cup and Super Cup holders, came out fired up for the second-half, but Leonid Slutski's side had only limited opportunities. The Russians enjoyed a good spell of possession until Bayern added their third when Alaba floated a lovely pass over the defence to give Robben all the time in the world to rifle home. The Dutchman, who scored the winner at Wembley's final in the 2-1 win over Borussia Dortmund in May, smashed his 68th-minute shot under Akinfeev, who had a busy night in the CSKA goal. With the outcome decided, Moscow threw more players forward and put more pressure on Bayern's goal, but Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was solid all night. It was a good start for the champions ahead of their next group stage match at Manchester City on October 2, the same night CSKA host Czech champions Viktoria Pilsen in Moscow."

1280,17/09/2013,17:01,Football: Dortmund tackle Europe without the X-factor,Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund embark on their third consecutive European campaign on Wednesday at Napoli fully aware they are no longer dark horses in the competition.,"Just 116 days after losing to Bayern Munich in May at Wembley, Germany's Dortmund are at Italian league leaders Napoli aiming to prove their run to the final was no fluke. Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund are top of the Bundesliga, two points clear of Bayern, after winning their opening five matches and ran riot at home with a 6-2 drubbing of Hamburg on Saturday. Borussia went into last season's campaign as something of an unknown quantity before posting wins over Real Madrid, Ajax and Manchester City, but are one of the favourites this time around. ""It will certainly be more difficult than it was last season,"" admitted Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke, with Dortmund having also drawn Arsenal and Olympique Marseille in Group F. ""But this is a great opportunity to prove how much we have evolved."" Despite losing Germany star Mario Goetze to rivals Bayern in July, Dortmund's recruitment has bolstered their attacking prowess. Fleet-footed Gabon forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been signed from French Cup holders St Etienne, while central midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan joined from Shakhtar Donetsk. Both scored in the win over Hamburg, but Germany winger Marco Reus has said the defence can not afford to leak more goals. ""In the Champions League, every mistake is punished immediately,"" warned Reus after Dortmund last won the title in 1997. Striker Robert Lewandowski, who became the first player to score four goals in a Champions League semi-final last season in the 4-1 first-leg win over Real Madrid, is eager to start. ""Now the season really starts for me,"" he told magazine Kicker. ""We want to do the same as we did last season -- or even better,"" before adding it was a ""highlight"" to open their campaign at Rafael Benitez's Napoli."
1281,17/09/2013,02:00,"Football: Mourinho eyes Chelsea glory as Barca, Ajax clash at last","A first-ever meeting of Barcelona and Ajax, two of European football's most famous names, tops the billing in Wednesday's Champions League card, while Jose Mourinho's Chelsea and last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund are also in action.","AFP sports takes a look at all of the opening ties in Groups E, F, G and H: Group E CHELSEA V BASEL Jose Mourinho's quest to win the Champions League with Chelsea recommences with a home fixture against the Swiss champions Basel at Stamford Bridge. These clubs met as recently as May, with Chelsea winning 5-2 on aggregate in the semi-finals of the Europa League on their way to lifting the trophy with a final victory against Benfica in Amsterdam. However, they only dropped into that competition after being eliminated from the Champions League at the group stage. This season's draw is a kind one, however, and the London club will be confident of getting back on track after Saturday's Premier League loss at Everton, even if they must do without the suspended Ramires. SCHALKE 04 V STEAUA BUCHAREST After a troubled start to the campaign, Schalke's confidence has been lifted thanks to a run of three consecutive victories. The most recent of those was a 1-0 triumph away to Mainz in the Bundesliga on Saturday, secured thanks to Kevin-Prince Boateng's first goal for the club. Boateng returned to Germany after scoring twice for AC Milan in their play-off round win over PSV Eindhoven, although he is eligible to represent Schalke in the group stage and will have an important role to play for Jens Keller's side, who have been without Klaas-Jan Huntelaar recently due to a knee injury. Romanian champions Steaua, the 1986 European Cup winners, came through three qualifying rounds to return to the group stage for the first time since 2008-09. Group F MARSEILLE V ARSENAL Arsenal have injury problems, with Santi Cazorla joining the likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lukas Podolski on the sidelines, but the signing of Germany star Mesut Ozil has lifted the London club and he helped inspire them to a 3-1 win at Sunderland in the Premier League on Saturday. That was a fifth consecutive win for Arsene Wenger's side in all competitions ahead of their visit to familiar foes Marseille. The clubs met in the group stage of the same competition two years ago, with Arsenal winning 1-0 in the south of France before a goalless draw in London. Elie Baup's side, who needed a late goal to draw 1-1 at Toulouse in Ligue 1 on Saturday, are the outsiders in a testing group. NAPOLI V BORUSSIA DORTMUND Last season's Champions League runners-up kick-off their campaign with a trip to Naples, in what is a contender for the outstanding game of matchday one. Jurgen Klopp's side are top of the Bundesliga having won all five matches so far, including a 6-2 trouncing of Hamburg on Saturday. Summer signings Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan were both on target in that game, and Dortmund could scarcely be in better shape ahead of this match at the Stadio San Paolo. Napoli, however, also boast a perfect record in Serie A, with summer recruits Gonzalo Higuain and Jose Callejon netting in Saturday's 2-0 home win against Atalanta. They return to the Champions League after a year's absence having lost to Chelsea in the last 16 two years ago. This time they are coached by a European specialist in Rafael Benitez, the mastermind of Liverpool's 2005 triumph and Chelsea's Europa League victory last season. Group G ATLETICO MADRID V ZENIT ST PETERSBURG Europa League winners twice in the last four seasons, Diego Simeone's side return to Europe's leading club competition fresh from winning their opening four games in La Liga. The most recent of those was a 4-2 defeat of Almeria on Saturday, featuring goals by strike duo Diego Costa and David Villa. Brazilian frontman Costa will not be able to play in Wednesday's game at the Vicente Calderon due to a suspension carried over from last season, though, and Atletico can expect a stern test from big-spending Zenit. The Russians will be eager to do better than last season, when they failed to make it beyond the group stage, and warmed up with a 2-0 win against Rostov on Saturday, which left them in second place in the Russian Premier League. AUSTRIA VIENNA V PORTO Portuguese champions Porto begin their Group G campaign at the scene of one of their greatest triumphs, with their match against Austria Vienna being played at the Ernst-Happel Stadion. It was there that Porto won their first European Cup in 1987, Rabah Madjer's legendary backheeled effort helping them come from behind to beat Bayern Munich 2-1 in the final. Porto lost the likes of James Rodriguez and Joao Moutinho over the summer, and have a new coach this season in Paulo Fonseca, but they have proven adept at rebuilding quickly in the past and still boast greater experience than their hosts, who are competing in the group stage for the first time. Nenad Bjelica's side came through two qualifying rounds to get here, but warmed up for this game by losing 3-2 at home to Groedig in the Austrian Bundesliga on Saturday. Group H BARCELONA V AJAX Group H brings together four former winners of the trophy, and both Barcelona and Ajax have been European champions on four separate occasions. The links between Barca and Ajax are plentiful, notably thanks to Johan Cruyff, who starred as a player and a coach for both sides. Rinus Michels and Louis van Gaal also coached both sides, while former Ajax player Frank Rijkaard led the Catalans to Champions League glory in 2006. Remarkably, though, this will be the first-ever competitive meeting of the two clubs. While the Dutch champions will arrive at the Camp Nou led by Frank de Boer, who spent four years as a player at Barcelona, the match will be an entirely new experience for his opposite number in the dugout. Tata Martino, who has overseen four wins out of four so far in La Liga, has plenty experience of South America's Copa Libertadores, but none of the Champions League. AC MILAN V CELTIC Seven-times European champions Milan entertain 1967 winners Celtic in Italy in a repeat of a 2007 last-16 tie, which the Serie A club won 1-0 after extra-time thanks to a Kaka goal. The Brazilian has recently returned to the San Siro after four years with Real Madrid but will miss Wednesday's game due to injury. Milan needed two late goals to earn a 2-2 draw at Torino on Saturday and also had to come through a play-off against PSV Eindhoven to reach the group stage. Massimiliano Allegri's side will be very much the favourites to get the better of the Scottish champions, who needed to win three qualifying ties to get this far. All-conquering at home, Neil Lennon's Celtic were comfortably beaten by another Italian club, Juventus, in the last 16 of this competition last season."
1282,16/09/2013,17:44,Football: Hamburg's Fink under fire after Dortmund drubbing,Hamburg coach Thorsten Fink's job is on the line after his chairman lambasted the faltering team's defence on Monday.,"Hamburg were drubbed 6-2 at Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund on Saturday, leading to chairman Carl Edgar Jarchow's astonishing public rebuke of his coach. Jarchow said he expects to see an improvement quickly, or else he and the board may be tempted to act. ""I take the long-term view, but on the board we expect things to be implemented,"" Jarchow told SID, an AFP subsidiary, on Monday. ""In Dortmund, it was a repeat of the debacle against Hoffenheim -- defence is our weak point and these mistakes must be eliminated. ""That is his (Fink's) job."" Hamburg are 15th -- just above the relegation zone -- after five games, but more worryingly they have conceded 15 goals -- 11 of which came in just two games. Having been hammered 5-1 at home by Hoffenheim in mid-August, Fink's defence again collapsed against Dortmund, despite recovering from 2-0 down to equalise just after half-time. With Dortmund's Poland striker Robert Lewandowski and Germany winger Marco Reus, plus new signings Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang running riot, Hamburg's defence leaked four goals in 16 minutes during a second-half horror show. ""We were naive and lost almost every one-on-one,"" fumed Fink after Dortmund peppered the Hamburg goal with more than a dozen shots on target. Hamburg also capitulated 9-2 at Bayern Munich last March and the Hamburg board are running out of patience with Fink, who took charge in October 2011. After the Hoffenheim defeat, Fink gave his players two days off, then threw left-back Dennis Aogo out of the squad before he was sold to Schalke 04, while centre-backs Slobodan Rajkovic and Michael Mancienne were told they have no future at the club. The 4-0 drubbing of Eintracht Braunschweig last month failed to mask Hamburg's defensive frailties and Fink now faces a make-or-break clash against north German neighbours Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga on Saturday. Jarchow left no doubt that defeat in that game could spell the end for Fink. ""One thing is for sure, that is a very important game for everyone,"" said Jarchow. Bremen are just one place above Hamburg in the league and suffered their third consecutive defeat when they went down 3-0 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. ""Everything depends on this game,"" insisted club captain Rafael van der Vaart."

But Sammer was scathing in his appraisal, accusing Bayern of playing ""lethargic football"", ""going through the motions"" and ""playing without emotion"". His comments raised eyebrows as Bayern have won four of their five league games, only dropping points at Freiburg a fortnight ago when Pep Guardiola's side drew 1-1 and are second in the league. ""I understand Matthias wants to pour oil on the fire, but I don't think we need to fire things up at the moment,"" Bayern president Uli Hoeness told German daily Bild. ""We will certainly talk about it, because it gives a bad impression of Bayern Munich. ""You get the feeling as if we've lost three of our five games and drawn the other two."" Guardiola said Sammer was entitled to his opinion. ""Matthias is very emotional, like me,"" said the Bayern coach. ""It's the culture here in Germany for people who work in the club to give their opinion. ""We'd have a problem if that happened in Spain, but it's normal here."" League leaders Borussia Dortmund hammered Hamburg 6-2 on Saturday and after five victories they are the only Bundesliga side with a 100 percent record -- which has not escaped their Bavarian rivals' attention. ""They must be laughing themselves to death in Dortmund. Our position in the Bundesliga is not dramatic,"" added Hoeness. ""He shouldn't stir things up. Matthias needs to take care not to overstep the mark. ""If you do things like that every week, you are going to get your fingers burnt at some point. ""The enemy is outside the walls, not within. ""The players are people who are sometimes careless. ""If we just want robots on the pitch, then there is no need to go to the stadium."" But Bayern's ex-president Franz Beckenbauer, who coached and captained Germany to World Cup titles, said Sammer's rant was in order. ""I think Matthias is working under the motto: Fight from the start! I think his comments are called for. He had a legitimate point,"" said Beckenbauer. But ex-Bayern and Germany midfielder Lothar Matthaeus said he was ""really shocked"" by Sammer's outburst. ""The players need trust, not criticism,"" Matthaeus, a pundit for Germany's Sky Sports, told Munich newspaper TZ. ""Comments like that just lead to a greater uncertainty, but that's Matthias. ""I'm not sure whether it's the right time to say something like that."""
1284,16/09/2013,12:46,Football: Leverkusen's Castro out of United clash,Bayer Leverkusen's defensive midfielder Gonzalo Castro is out of Tuesday's Champions League clash against Manchester United at Old Trafford after tearing his hamstring.,"The 26-year-old, who made the last of his five Germany appearances in 2007, sustained the injury in the closing stages of Saturday's 3-1 Bundesliga win over VfL Wolfsburg, which kept them third, before Monday's diagnosis. Midfielder Lars Bender, who sat out the Wolfsburg match, is set to deputise, providing he has fully recovered from the hip injury which kept him out of Germany's World Cup qualifiers earlier this month. ""I feel fit again. There is nothing standing in the way of me playing,"" Bender told SID, an AFP subsidiary. Leverkusen, back in the Champions League after a year's absence, are up against a United side who enjoyed their first win at home under David Moyes on Saturday after both Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney scored in the 2-0 win over Crystal Palace. Sami Hyypia-coached Leverkusen have won four of their five Bundesliga matches so far this season and are third behind leaders Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in the German league."
1285,16/09/2013,02:33,"Football: Pressure off Bayer in Manchester, says Son",South Korea's Son Heung-Min has said the pressure will be off Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday at Manchester United with coach David Moyes under the spotlight in his first Champions League match.,"Son says Leverkusen have little to lose with the focus on Moyes at Old Trafford as he begins the next chapter in United's proud European history having succeeded the legendary Alex Ferguson. ""The mood is good in the Bayer squad and we don't have much to lose in England,"" the 21-year-old striker told AFP. ""Manchester United are the clear favourites. ""That's not the worst position to go into a game and it's obviously a great start for us. ""Old Trafford is one of the most famous stadiums in the world and Manchester United are one of the world's biggest clubs. ""United haven't had perhaps the best start to the season, but there is no need to discuss the quality of the trainer and the team. ""David Moyes coached Everton for years, he has plenty of Premier League experience and he has got a world-class team. ""It is going to be special to play there, for sure."" While there will be lots of interest in Bayer, Son says there is no pressure to emulate their Bundesliga rivals Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, who contested May's Champions League final at Wembley. ""No one would expect that from us and we'd be well advised not to build castles in the sky and just take it one step at a time,"" he said. ""We want to play at the top of the Bundesliga, the way Bayer did last season, and in the Champions League, we want to get through the group phase. ""That will be hard enough with Manchester United, Shakhtar Donetsk and Real Sociedad in our group. ""But we're highly motivated and not an easy opponent for the others either."" Son's hunger for Champions League football took him from Hamburg, whom he joined as a raw 16-year-old in 2008, to Leverkusen in July to work under Sami Hyypia, the ex-Liverpool captain. A host of Premier League clubs -- including Manchester United -- were reported to have courted the talented striker, but his desire for regular football saw him opt for Leverkusen. Son has started on the left wing in all five of Leverkusen's five Bundesliga matches this season, scoring in the opening 3-1 win against Freiburg. Having spent five years here, Son speaks excellent German, but admits it was a culture shock to switch his home town of Chuncheon for Hanseatic Hamburg. ""I was 16 when I first came to Germany. At first I shared a small flat with two other South Korean boys and my parents later followed me to Hamburg,"" he said. ""In the beginning, I couldn't make myself understood, neither in English nor German, so obviously I was helped by a translator. ""But I learnt the language fast at school and now I don't have any problems. ""It was a big step for a 16-year-old, especially as I entered a completely different culture. You can't compare the two countries. ""I feel good in Germany. South Korea will always be my home and I enjoy the time I spend there for internationals or holidays. ""You can't fly there for a weekend and there aren't many chances to go home. ""Germany and South Korea are vastly different but I like that, I value the different mentalities in both countries."""
1286,16/09/2013,02:10,Football: Leverkusen baptism for newcomer Moyes,David Moyes will sample the Champions League group phase for the first time on Tuesday when his Manchester United side host Bayer Leverkusen in their opening Group A fixture.,"Moyes was selected to succeed Alex Ferguson as United manager at the end of last season despite having only overseen two matches in the competition during his 11-year tenure at Everton. Those games, in 2005, saw the Merseyside club beaten 4-2 by Villarreal over two legs in the third qualifying round, but Moyes is relishing the prospect of a second bite at the apple. ""I am really excited to be involved in it,"" he told United's in-house television station, MUTV. ""I have been in the Champions League before but I have not made the group stage. I had quite a few episodes in the Europa League, which were good, but nothing at the level of the Champions League. ""We will do our homework to make sure we are as prepared as we can be."" United are the only genuine European heavyweights in the group, but with Shakhtar Donetsk and Real Sociedad making up the pool, there is not a weak team in Group A either. Moyes says that although things could have been better, they could also have been a lot worse. ""It was the first time I have been involved in a draw at that level,"" said the Scot. ""When the names came out, there were some that I didn't want and others I would have been happy with. Relatively, I am quite pleased. ""To draw Real Sociedad out of the last pot was a tough one. They have done well in Spain this year and had a great result against Lyon to get into the group stage. ""That put a little bit of a downer on it. In addition, Leverkusen are doing well in Germany and we also have the long trip to Donetsk."" Leverkusen finished third in the Bundesliga last season and have won four of their first five games this term, with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich the only sides above them in the table. Their last Champions League experience ended in humiliation, however, with a 10-2 aggregate defeat by Barcelona in the last 16 in February 2012. Manuel Friedrich and Michal Kadlec were subsequently chastised by director of sport Rudi Voller over their eagerness to swap shirts with Lionel Messi, and manager Sami Hyypia has warned his players not to be dazzled by the limelight at Old Trafford. ""I hope my players want to play football in Manchester and not just get autographs from (Wayne) Rooney,"" said the former Liverpool defender, who is also a group-stage novice as a coach. Leverkusen's defenders can expect to see plenty of Rooney on Tuesday, the England striker having returned from a head injury to score a late free-kick in Saturday's 2-0 home win over Crystal Palace. Moyes will be without Nani, however, as the Portuguese winger is suspended due to the controversial red card he was shown when United were eliminated by Real Madrid last season. United also have defenders Rafael da Silva and Phil Jones unavailable due to injury, whereas Hyypia reported no new injury problems after his side's 3-1 defeat of Wolfsburg at the weekend. It is 11 years since Leverkusen stunned United in the Champions League semi-finals, before losing to Real Madrid in the final, and striker Stefan Kiessling knows a sizeable effort will be required to pull off a similar result. ""This is a huge event for us, but we have to give it our all for 90 minutes,"" said the Germany striker, who scored twice against Wolfsburg. Tuesday's game will mark United's first European fixture without Ferguson in the dug-out since a quarter-final defeat by Hungarians FC Videoton in the UEFA Cup in March 1985. Their home form in Ferguson's later years left a lot to be desired, however, and Moyes will hope to improve a record of only three wins in nine European fixtures."

Striker Anthony Modeste gave Hoffenheim the lead just before the break, then provided a superb through ball for Volland to pounce on, turn the defence and hit the bottom right-hand corner. ""It was a great pass from Anthony, things are going well for me, I worked hard in pre-season which gave me confidence,"" said the Germany Under-21 skipper. ""I just want to have a good season with Hoffenheim and anything else would just be a bonus,"" he added when asked about a possible call up to Joachim Loew's senior Germany side. Gladbach pulled a goal back when Swedish striker Branimir Hrgota powered through the Hoffenheim defence fifteen minutes from time, but the defeat left Lucien Favre's side in mid-table. Later, bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig picked up their first point of the season after four defeats with a 1-1 draw at Nuremberg, with the hosts also in the bottom three. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund picked up their fifth win to maintain their 100 percent record with a 6-2 romp at home to Hamburg to stay top of the league. After Pep Guardiola's Bayern had briefly claimed top spot with a 2-0 win over Hanover 96, Dortmund replied by routing Torsten Fink's Hamburg in emphatic style.

Bayer Leverkusen prepared for their Old Trafford trip to face Manchester United on Tuesday with a convincing 3-1 win over 10-man VfL Wolfsburg to stay third. Germany winger Sidney Sam put the hosts ahead before Wolfsburg's Croatia striker Ivica Olic levelled just before the break. Stefan Kiessling netted twice to give Leverkusen their fourth win from their opening five games, heading home on 65 minutes before slamming in his second in added time. Wolfsburg were reduced to 10 men when ex-Bayern Munich midfielder Luiz Gustavo was sent off in the final 10 minutes, for the second time this season. The Brazilian had only just returned from suspension after being dismissed in the 2-0 defeat at Mainz at the end of August. Schalke 04, who host Steaua Bucharest on Wednesday, continued their revival by picking up their second victory with a 1-0 win over Mainz. New signing Kevin-Prince Boateng hit the first-half winner in only his second league match since arriving from AC Milan. The victory lifts the Royal Blues up to ninth, while Mainz remain fifth. Werder Bremen crashed to their third straight defeat when they went down 3-0 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt after new signing Franco di Santo was sent off for kicking an opponent in the face. Czech Republic striker Vaclav Kadlec scored two first-half goals before Austria defender Sebastian Proedl added a late own-goal to complete Bremen's misery. Augsburg needed a 90th-minute winner from midfielder Tobias Werner to seal a 2-1 win at home to Freiburg.

Bayern start their Champions League campaign at home to CSKA Moscow on Tuesday and Sammer described the Bavarian giants as going into their ""full-throttle week"" with the handbrake on. Sammer said any talk of readjustments under new coach Pep Guardiola was just ""alibi rubbish"" and insisted Bayern's stars should not have needed a passionate pre-match speech by Guardiola. ""It's all Pep this, Pep that -- it's not his fault, but it makes everyone else a little less responsible around here,"" said Sammer. ""Everyone wants to play well, that's without question, but the coach had to give a fiery speech before we really get going."" Sammer pointed to rivals Borussia Dortmund having secured top spot with a 6-2 romp over Hamburg. ""We are at the same point in the season where Dortmund gave everything away last year,"" said Sammer, while Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge described Dortmund's victory as a ""warning"". Guardiola admitted Bayern had struggled to find their rhythm after the bulk of his squad only returned from international duty on Wednesday with several of their stars injured. Second-half goals by Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic and France's Franck Ribery settled the win. ""We didn't do well in the first-half,"" said Ribery, as Bayern enjoyed around 70 percent ball possession. ""It is always difficult after an international break, we had more power in the second half, when we scored the goals. ""The main thing is we got a win, which was important."" But Dortmund's flawless record leaves Jurgen Klopp's team top of the Bundesliga ahead of their Champions League trip to Napoli on Wednesday. ""That was simply awesome, it was fun just to watch,"" said Klopp. ""Towards the end, my heart was singing and apart from the two goals we conceded, we defended well."" New signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice, as did Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, as Champions League runners-up Dortmund pulled away after Hamburg had levelled at 2-2. Dortmund produced some superb second-half football including a sublime pass from Germany winger Marco Reus to Lewandowski for the fourth goal.

1293,14/09/2013,17:52,Football: Champions Bayern down Hanover to top league,Bayern Munich topped the Bundesliga for the first time this season with a 2-0 win over Hanover 96 on Saturday as they prepare to defend their Champions League title.,"Second-half goals by Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic and France winger Franck Ribery gave Bayern the three points at Munich's Allianz Arena, which saw the Bavarians knock Borussia Dortmund, who host Hamburg later, off top spot. It was the ideal preparation for Pep Guardiola's team, who begin their Champions League campaign at home to CSKA Moscow on Tuesday. It was especially satisfying as Dutch winger Arjen Robben played a big part in both goals as Bayern enjoyed around 70 percent ball possession. Hanover, who last won in Munich seven years ago, squandered a chance when Ivory Coast forward Didier Ya Konan hit the crossbar in the first half and the result sees them slip down to fourth. Bayer Leverkusen, who launch their Champions League campaign at English giants Manchester United on Tuesday, warmed up for their Old Trafford clash with a convincing 3-1 win over 10-man VfL Wolfsburg to stay third. Germany winger Sidney Sam put the hosts ahead before Wolfsburg's Croatia striker Ivica Olic levelled just before the break. Bayer striker Stefan Kiessling netted twice to give Leverkusen their fourth win from their opening five games, heading home on 65 minutes before slamming in his second in added time. Wolves were reduced to ten men when ex-Bayern Munich midfielder Luiz Gustavo was sent off in the final 10 minutes, for the second time this season for a second yellow card. The Brazilian had only just returned from suspension after being dismissed in the 2-0 defeat at Mainz at the end of August. Schalke 04, who host Steaua Bucharest in the Champions League on Wednesday, continued their revival by picking up their second victory as new signing Kevin-Prince Boateng hit the first-half winner in only his second league match since arriving from AC Milan. The victory lifts the Royal Blues up to eighth, while Mainz are fifth. Werder Bremen crashed to their third consecutive defeat when they went down 3-0 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt, with Czech Republic striker Vaclav Kadlec scoring two first-half goals before Austria defender Sebastian Proedl scored a late own-goal to complete Bremen's misery. Augsburg needed a 90th-minute winner from midfielder Tobias Werner to seal a 2-1 win at home to Freiburg while on Friday VfB Stuttgart earned a 1-0 win in the capital against Hertha Berlin, picking up their second win under caretaker coach Thomas Schneider."

Bayern dropped their first points in the league under Guardiola when they were held to a 1-1 draw at Freiburg a fortnight ago and the Champions League holders face a taxing three weeks with seven games in 22 days. However, Bayern expect to have Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger back as the defensive midfielder returned to training this week after straining ankle ligaments at Freiburg.

Having won last season's Bundesliga title by a record 25 points, Bayern are yet to produce an entirely convincing display under Guardiola and Hanover feel Saturday is as good a chance as any to bring home a result from Munich. ""We can get a good result, if we take the same wave of euphoria to Munich which carries us at home,"" said Hanover's Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler. ""Bayern are of course a force to be reckoned with at home but they aren't playing the same football as last season."" Hanover president Martin Kind was in equally bullish mood.

1298,13/09/2013,02:20,Football: Bayern bosses turn up heat on Guardiola,Bayern Munich's bosses have put pressure on coach Pep Guardiola ahead of Saturday's Bundesliga home match with Hanover 96 as the European champions enter a tough few weeks.,"Bayern are second in the Bundesliga behind rivals Borussia Dortmund and launch the defence of their Champions League title against CSKA Moscow next Tuesday. Then follows an away trip to Schalke 04, home matches against Hanover, again, in the cup, Wolfsburg in the league, then a Champions League away trip to Manchester City before facing Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga -- all in the next three weeks. Despite their punishing schedule, Bayern's top brass expect their side to prove they are just as strong under Guardiola as they were under his predecessor Jupp Heynckes. ""We have to immediately go full throttle and tackle our work with hunger, as we did so phenomenally last season,"" president Uli Hoeness told German daily Bild. Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge also said there can be no more excuses. ""We're at the stage where you can't allow for any more weaknesses"", he said, refering to Bayern's 1-1 draw at Freiburg a fortnight ago. Stern-faced director of sport Matthias Sammer also described the result as ""reckless and annoying"" after Guardiola fielded a weakened side. Dutch winger Arjen Robben beleives Bayern must quickly turn their attantions back to the league, having had a host of players on recent international duty. ""We have to hit the ground running and switch back to Bundesliga mode, Hanover won't give us time to settle,"" said Robben. ""We must be careful they don't hit us on the counter-attack, they'll be strong."" Bayern have a few injury problems with central midfielders Mario Goetze, Thiago Alcantara, plus defensive midfielders Javi Martinez and Jan Kirchoff on the sidelines. But they expect to have Germany star Bastian Schweinsteiger back as their vice-captain trained on Thursday after spraining his ankle at Freiburg. With four games played, Bayern are two points behind leaders Borussia, something which does not bother Robben. ""Dortmund is not the most important thing for us, we have to deal with ourselves,"" said the Dutch winger. ""Of course, we want to be at the top of the league, but you can only do that if you win."" Dortmund, the only team with a 100 percent record, host Hamburg on Saturday with concerns over Poland midfielder Jakub Blaszczykowski, who injured knee ligaments on international duty. ""It has got better, but it's still not good, it'll be close,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. Striker Robert Lewandowski is expected to be fit after suffering a knee strain while midfielder Marco Reus has trained since Wednesday after missing Germany's World Cup qualifier against Faroe Islands on Tuesday with an upset stomach. Schalke 04 warm-up for Wednesday's opening Champions League visit by Steaua Bucharest with a trip to mid-table Mainz and are hoping Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar will soon be back after a knee injury. ""He's still not an option for the weekend, but for the game against Bucharest, we'll have to wait and see,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. Schalke are out to prove their victory over Bayer Leverkusen a fortnight ago was no fluke, with their Hungary striker Adam Szalai facing his former club. But new signing Kevin-Prince Boateng is an injury concern, having pulled out of Ghana's international last week with a knee injury."
1299,10/09/2013,18:03,Football: Schweinsteiger set to return for Bayern,Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger is set to return from an ankle injury for Bayern Munich in Saturday's Bundesliga clash at home to Hanover 96.,"The 29-year-old has been out since injuring his right ankle in Bayern's 1-1 Bundesliga draw at Freiburg a fortnight ago, but is expected to play at Munich's Allianz Arena against Hanover. Having missed Bayern's UEFA Super Cup win over Chelsea in Prague, as well as Germany's 3-0 win over Austria in Friday's World Cup qualifier, Schweinsteiger trained with the Bayern squad under coach Pep Guardiola on Tuesday, while his fellow German internationals prepared to face Faroe Islands. Dutch winger Arjen Robben, who played in the Netherlands' 2-2 draw with Estonia last Friday but pulled out of Tuesday's match against minnows Andorra with a slight knee injury, should also be fit to play Hanover. ""It'll be a difficult game, we have to win it,"" said Robben, with Bayern second in the Bundesliga, two points behind leaders Borussia Dortmund, who have won all four of their league games so far."
1300,06/09/2013,15:44,Football: New Goetze injury bothers Germany boss Loew,Germany coach Joachim Loew has admitted he is concerned by Mario Goetze's latest set-back as the midfield star has suffered with consecutive injuries since April.,"The 21-year-old tore his hamstring in April for former club Borussia Dortmund, then suffered an ankle strain during last Friday's UEFA Super Cup final for Bayern Munich in their penalty shoot-out win over Chelsea in Prague. Having only made his comeback in August, Goetze played just four games, including 128 minutes in the Bundesliga, before suffering the new injury when Chelsea's Ramires trod on his ankle, which led to the Brazilian's red card. Goetze, who made the last of his 22 appearances for Germany in March, returned from the Czech Republic in a plaster cast and is expected to miss the rest of the month, including Germany's World Cup qualifiers against Austria on Friday and minnows Faroe Islands next Tuesday. With a view to next June's World Cup in Brazil, Germany boss Loew has said Goetze will need time to find his form and consistency. ""It is a huge pity that he is injured again, having just slowly got into a rhythm after his previous injury,"" said Loew, whose Germany team is five points clear at the top of their qualifying group. ""He needs to be allowed to find his form again,"" he added who described Goetze as an ""exceptional"" player. ""In a World Cup season, it is important to get some consistency and I hope he finds it."" Goetze faces a race to be fit for Germany's next World Cup qualifiers against the Republic of Ireland in Cologne on October 11 and four days later against Sweden in Stockholm. After Goetze cost Bayern 37 million euros (US$48.53) from Dortmund, Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said the attacking midfielder will become a major star. ""He is on the way to becoming a world star and he will take the next step with Bayern Munich,"" Rummenigge told SID, an AFP subsidiary. ""He will give us the piece of quality which will ultimately make us successful."""
1301,05/09/2013,02:25,Football: Germany's Loew focused on attacking Austria,"Germany coach Joachim Loew has promised more attacking football in Friday's World Cup qualifier against Austria in Munich, despite recent defensive frailties.","Loew's Germany are five-points clear at the top of Group C, with Austria second on goal difference, but Austria coach Marcel Koller will be hoping to exploit the Germans' defensive weaknesses of late. Germany suffered a 4-3 defeat away to the USA in June, while Paraguay raced into a 2-0 lead in Kaiserslautern last month before Germany fought back for a 3-3 draw. In both friendlies, the German defence struggled as Loew experimented with his line-up. During the 53-year-old's seven years in charge, Germany have developed into an attacking powerhouse, but on Tuesday defensive midfielder Sami Khedira called for their prowess going forward to be paired with the efficient defending the Germans have always been known for. Although question marks have been raised after recent results, Germany have leaked just seven goals in their six qualifiers so far, while scoring 22 in the process, and Loew has said he wants to see his team continue to push forward. ""I'm not prepared to see us fall back and only push forward on the counter-attack,"" said Loew. ""We are not going to hide in our half of the field and let the opposition attack. ""The team can't only be strong in attack, we have to also do well in defence, but we're not going to be defensive in our overall orientation."" Loew said he expects Austria, for whom 10 members of their squad ply their trade in the Bundesliga, to attack at every opportunity as they need three points to stay in the World Cup qualification hunt. ""This Austria team will be highly motivated, a lot of them play in the Bundesliga and they have matured over the last few years,"" said Loew. ""They have a good pressing game and are quick on the counter-attack, they will be brave and come at us."" Germany won the away match 2-1 in Vienna in September 2012 with Arsenal's new-signing Mesut Ozil scoring the winning penalty, but Austria striker Marko Arnautovic missed a chance to equalise in the dying stages and the Werder Bremen star has said they ""owe"" Germany a defeat. With their rivals Republic of Ireland and Sweden also meeting in Dublin on Friday, a win in Munich would put Germany in pole-position to confirm their qualification ahead of next Tuesday's away trip to minnows Faroe Islands, who are bottom of the group. The winner of each qualifying group is guaranteed a World Cup place while the eight best runners-up of the nine groups go into play-offs. The statistics point to a German win: 1986 was the last time Austria beat Germany, but curiously the hosts have never won a qualification game at Munich's Allianz Arena. Germany are without vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger and Khedira will be partnered by either Borussia Dortmund's Sven Bender or Bayern Munich's Toni Kroos. Having beaten Sweden 2-1 in June, Austrian confidence is high and Bayern Munich left-back David Alaba, who will be in the unusual position of playing with the away team at the Allianz Arena, said they want to shock Germany. ""We want to make life as hard as possible for the Germans,"" he declared. ""We're going there looking to come away with a result. We have no need to be scared."""
1302,01/09/2013,20:20,Football: Mkhitaryan fires Dortmund top of Bundesliga,Borussia Dortmund knocked Bayern Munich off top spot in the Bundesliga on Sunday as new signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan scored both goals in their 2-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt.,"The 24-year-old attacking midfielder proved why Dortmund paid Shakhtar Donetsk 27.5 million euros ($36.3m) for him with his first two league goals in only his third Bundesliga appearance. It means Dortmund go into the international break for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers two points clear of European champions Bayern. Mkhitaryan started off by finishing a defence-splitting pass from Poland winger Jakub Blaszczykowski after ten minutes. Frankfurt equalised when Stefan Aigner's bullet-header slammed off the post and Czech striker Vaclav Kadlec rifled home the rebound on 36 minutes for his first Bundesliga goal, having joined from Sparta Prague last month. But Mkhitaryan restored Dortmund's lead with the winner when he dribbled along the edge of the area and unleashed a fearsome shot past Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp. However, the Armenian said Dortmund must improve to keep Bayern in second. ""I feel good in Dortmund and I'm happy with the goals, but I think we need to be much better,"" insisted Mkhitaryan, while Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp described the midfielder as ""a weapon in front of goal with an awesome shooting technique"". The result means Dortmund finish the weekend as the league's only team with a 100 percent record as Bayern, who drew 1-1 with Freiburg on Tuesday, Mainz and Bayer Leverkusen all dropped points. Earlier, VfB Stuttgart romped to a 6-2 Bundesliga win over Hoffenheim with striker Vedad Ibisevic netting a hat-trick after coach Bruno Labbadia was sacked last Monday. Stuttgart picked up their first points of the season after three straight defeats led to Labbadia's dismissal. Caretaker coach Thomas Schneider got off to an emphatic start as Stuttgart's Romanian striker Alexandru Maxim did the damage by scoring two goals and setting up two more, while Bosnia striker Ibisevic claimed a hat-trick. The result lifts Stuttgart out of the bottom three and into 14th and leaves Hoffenheim 11th after their first defeat of the season. On Saturday, Leverkusen blew the chance to go top with a 2-0 defeat at resurgent Schalke 04. Both Germany left-back Dennis Aogo, who has joined Schalke on loan from Hamburg, and Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, who signed a four-year deal after arriving from AC Milan on Friday, started as the Royal Blues picked up their first league win of the season. Schalke went ahead with half an hour gone when a free-kick went in off midfielder Marco Hoeger's right shoulder before Peru forward Jefferson Farfan made sure of the win when he drilled home an 83rd-minute penalty after being hauled down in the area. Mainz 05 also wasted their opportunity to go top as they crashed to a 4-1 defeat at Hanover 96. Mainz took a 12th-minute lead through striker Nicolai Mueller, but Senegal striker Mame Diouf and Poland forward Artur Sobiech put the hosts 2-1 up at the break before Ivory Coast forward Didier Ya Konan and midfielder Edgar Prib increased the lead. Elsewhere, struggling Hamburg picked up their first win of the season after two consecutive defeats with a 4-0 thumping of promoted Eintracht Braunschweig. Dutch international Rafael van der Vaart put Hamburg ahead in the seventh minute on their first attack before Cameroon striker Jacques Zoua doubled the lead on 17 minutes as the hosts counter-attacked at pace. Hamburg made sure of the three points -- and Braunschweig's fourth straight defeat to leave Eintracht bottom of the table -- when 19-year-old Turkish midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu came on for Van der Vaart on 79 minutes to claim a brace, including a stunning free-kick. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach moved up to seventh as they romped to a 4-1 home win over Werder Bremen. Wolfsburg enjoyed a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin with Ivica Olic and Diego on target, while Augsburg picked up their second straight win with a 1-0 success at Nuremberg thanks to a late goal from substitute Kevin Vogt."

""That was a reaction from the events of the last few weeks."" The result lifts Stuttgart out of the bottom three and into 14th and leaves Hoffenheim 11th after their first defeat of the season. Borussia Dortmund can usurp defending champions Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table if they win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday evening. On Saturday, Bayer Leverkusen blew the chance to go top as they lost their 100 percent record with a 2-0 defeat at resurgent Schalke 04.

Venezuelan winger Juan Arango opened the scoring on 36 minutes with a wonderful strike from the left and Gladbach then added three more in the second half, including one from German international forward Max Kruse. Norway midfielder Havard Nordtveit's 69th minute own-goal proved to be a mere consolation for Robin Dutt's Bremen, who have now lost two on the bounce.

Vice captain Schweinsteiger had been ruled out of the Prague showdown with a sprained right ankle and will also miss Germany's forthcoming World Cup qualifiers against Austria in Munich on Friday and Faroe Islands on September 10. Dutch winger Robben will miss at least the next three days of training with a knee strain, while Spain's Martinez, who scored the dramatic 121st-minute equaliser in Prague to take the game to penalties, will miss most of next week with the same injury, Bayern said on their website. Both Robben and Martinez should be fit for Bayern's next Bundesliga match at Hanover 96 on September 14. Goetze, 21, who cost 37 million euros ($49 million) from Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund, faces the longest lay-off after tearing a ligament in his right ankle. He is expected to be out for at least the next three weeks having returned from Prague in a plaster cast. The cast will be removed after a week and he will then spend up to two weeks in rehabilitation before returning to training, Bayern said."

In the battle between the Bundesliga's other two Champions League representatives, Schalke hauled themselves up into mid-table and left Leverkusen joint-third behind Bayern and second-placed Dortmund, who are at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday. Both Germany left-back Dennis Aogo, who has joined Schalke on loan from Hamburg, and Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, who signed a four-year deal from AC Milan on Friday, started as the Royal Blues picked up their first league win of the season. ""I'm incredibly proud of my team, it has often been said that we have a mentality problem, but we ran hard, fought for everything and were tactically astute. That makes me proud,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. ""We implemented everything we had planned. Both Kevin-Prince Boateng and Dennis Aogo did really well on their debuts."" Schalke recovered from losing their opening two Bundesliga games against Wolfsburg and Hanover 96 to qualify for the Champions League group stage at the expense of Greek club PAOK on Tuesday and built on that success with what was a convincing home league win against Leverkusen. Keller's side took the lead with half an hour gone when a free-kick went in off midfielder Marco Hoeger's right shoulder before Peru forward Jefferson Farfan made sure of the win when he drilled home an 83rd-minute penalty after being hauled down in the area. Earlier Mainz 05 lost their 100 percent record and wasted their chance to go top as they crashed to a 4-1 defeat at Hanover 96. Mainz took a 12th-minute lead at Hanover through striker Nicolai Mueller, but Thomas Tuchel's side suffered their first defeat after three straight wins as Senegal striker Mame Diouf levelled before Poland forward Artur Sobiech put the hosts in front before the break. Hanover doubled their lead late on with Ivory Coast forward Didier Ya Konan and midfielder Edgar Prib both scoring in the last 10 minutes for Mirko Slomka's side. ""We started out well and were disciplined, not allowing Hanover any chances,"" said Tuchel. ""Out of the blue, we conceded an equaliser and it was striking to see the body language. ""The key for us is improving our defending, judging by the way we conceded the first two goals."" Elsewhere, struggling Hamburg picked up their first win of the season after two consecutive defeats with a 4-0 thumping of promoted Eintracht Braunschweig. Dutch international Rafael van der Vaart put Hamburg ahead in the seventh minute on their first attack before Cameroon striker Jacques Zoua doubled the lead on 17 minutes. Hamburg confirmed their first three points -- and Braunschweig's fourth straight defeat -- when 19-year-old Turkish midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu came on for Van der Vaart on 79 minutes to claim a brace, including a stunning free-kick.

""The Bundesliga is the best in the world and it's where the best players in the world go,"" said the self-confident 26-year-old at a press conference in Gelsenkirchen. ""I've always said that I wanted to play again in Germany."" The half-brother of Bayern Munich and Germany defender Jerome Boateng started his career at Hertha Berlin and moved to Tottenham Hotspur for 7.9 million euros in 2007. He returned briefly to Germany for a loan spell with Schalke's bitter rivals Borussia Dortmund before joining Portsmouth and then Milan. Boateng scored twice in the Italian team's 3-0 victory against PSV Eindhoven in their Champions League play-off second leg on Wednesday that took them through to the group stage 4-1 on aggregate. A tough character, Boateng's tackle on Michael Ballack in the 2010 FA Cup final ruled the Germany captain out of the World Cup in South Africa and he has been brought in to add some middle backbone for the Royal Blues. ""He is an exceptional player with enormous quality and tremendous leadership skills,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. Alongside Schalke's 19-year-old star Julian Draxler, Boateng could form an impressive midfield partnership and Schalke's general manager Horst Heldt ruled out selling the teenager Draxler before the transfer window closes next week. ""It would be schizophrenic to sign one player of quality, but then let another one go. That's not what we want to do,"" said Heldt. The German Football League (DFL) have said Boateng is eligible for Saturday's Bundesliga match at home to Leverkusen, despite picking up a four-game ban when he was dismissed for kicking an opponent in the face on his final appearance for Dortmund at Wolfsburg in 2009."

He is exactly what we needed,"" Toennies was quoted as saying. Sport Bild reported that Boateng had already passed a medical and would move for a fee of 12 million euros ($15.9m) on a three-year deal that carries an option for a fourth season. The 26-year-old German-born Ghanaian international started his career in the Bundesliga with Hertha Berlin, his hometown team, in 2005.

1310,29/08/2013,19:58,Football: Munich defeat to Chelsea doesn't bother Bayern,Thomas Mueller has said Bayern Munich are out to prove themselves as worthy European champions in Friday's Super Cup final rather than avenge their 2012 Champions League final defeat to Chelsea.,"Pep Guardiola's Bayern take on Jose Mourinho's Europa League-winners Chelsea at Prague's Eden Arena stadium on Friday looking to win the Super Cup at the fourth attempt after losing the 2001, 1976 and 1975 finals. Having suffered the heartbreak of losing to Chelsea in a penalty shoot-out at their own Allianz Arena stadium in the 2012 Champions League final, Bayern bounced back with a 2-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund at Wembley in May to claim their fifth European Cup. Few Bayern fans need reminding of the heartbreak of losing the Munich final 15 months ago, when Mueller's 83rd-minute goal was cancelled out by a Didier Drogba header two minutes from time before the Ivory Coast star hit the winning spot-kick. Mueller said Bayern exorcised the ghosts of their Munich defeat by winning last season's treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup, and now aim to prove themselves as deserving European champions. ""Last season is still fresh and it was very positive, there is no lingering bitterness (from the 2012 Champions League final),"" said Mueller. ""Of course, we were able to compensate for that bitter defeat, we just want to show May's win was no coincidence, we want to prove ourselves and it's the best motivation for Friday's final."" Czech Republic goalkeeper Petr Cech was Chelsea's hero in the Munich final when he saved Arjen Robben's penalty in added time, then saved Ivica Olic's spot-kick and palmed Bastian Schweinsteiger's effort onto the post in the shoot-out before Drogba's winner. Mueller denied that he and his Bayern teammates faced a 'nightmare scenario' up against Cech. ""We all know what happened then, we also know he's a good goalkeeper, so it's not a nightmare scenario,"" said the 23-year-old. ""We don't want to get to a penalty shoot-out, we want to win in regular time, of course we don't have a positive example to look back on, but we'll do our best to win it."" Bayern's main injury worry is Bastian Schweinsteiger, who damaged his right ankle in Tuesday's 1-1 draw at Freiburg, but he took part in Thursday's training session and Guardiola was 'optimistic' the Germany star would play. ""Bastian is better, we'll check how his ankle is, I will talk with the doctors and decide, but hopefully he can play,"" said the Spaniard. Having taken charge of Bayern in June, Guardiola, who won 14 titles as Barcelona coach between 2008 and 2012, faces his former Real Madrid nemesis Mourinho in his first international final with Bayern. Both managers ducked questions about their rivalry and Guardiola was quick to play down their renewed sideline battle. ""We're here for the players, not the coaches,"" he insisted. ""Millions of people around the world will watch the game, not the coaches. ""I have a great respect for him, but tomorrow I will try to win and so will he too."" Prague's state-of-the-art Eden Arena stadium, opened in 2008, seats just 21,000 fans, but Guardiola was amused when asked if he thought it was small-scale compared to Barcelona's enormous Camp Nou or Bayern's Allianz Arena. ""You think I always played as a trainer or player at a stadium in front of millions of people?"" he asked. ""I started as a trainer at a fourth-division club, where the only supporters were just my father, my mother and my son watching the game, that's all. ""The important thing is just to be here in Prague."""

Schalke won away from home despite finishing with ten men after American midfielder Jermaine Jones was dismissed for a second yellow card as Hungary striker Adam Szalai hit two goals including the dramatic 90th-minute winner. But the 25-year-old is suspected to have suffered a broken scaphoid in his right hand during training and then landed on it after scoring Schalke's first goal. ""It was extremely painful,"" he told German daily Bild with a scan set to reveal the extent of the damage. Szalai, who cost Schalke 8 million euros (US$ 10.7m) from Mainz 05 in July, could be ruled out for up to eight weeks and Schalke are already without first-choice striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar for the next few weeks with torn knee ligaments. According to German media, Schalke are set to recruit left-back Aogo, who has won 12 caps for Germany on loan with the 26-year-old reportedly needing only to pass a medical to finalise the deal. Schalke will discover their Champions League opponents on Thursday when the group stage draw is made in Monaco (1745 local time) with defending champions Bayern Munich and fellow Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen also in the draw."

He is an injury concern for Friday's Super Cup clash against Europa League winners Chelsea in Prague as well as Germany's upcoming World Cup qualifying double-header against Austria and Faroe Islands. ""He will be examined in Munich, we hope that he will be able to play against Chelsea,"" said Bayern's media director Markus Hoerwick. Bayern still moved a point clear at the top of the table, although Mainz, Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen can all leapfrog them should they win their game in hand this weekend. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola - who has introduced a new 4-1-4-1 system since coming in to replace Jupp Heynckes - made several changes to his line-up from the one that beat Nuremberg 2-0 on Saturday. He rested six of his first-choice side, leaving out wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, who both netted at the weekend. ""If you only lead 1-0, then you are always vulnerable to concede an equaliser,"" said Guardiola. ""I don't think I risked too much with that line-up. ""I don't know if we missed one or two players, I took the decision and those on the pitch played well."" Bayern dominated the game but, not for the first time, failed to convert a string of chances despite enjoying 75 percent possession after setting a new Bundesliga record of 81 in Saturday's win over Nuremberg. ""We only have ourselves to blame,"" said captain Philipp Lahm, who was one of those rested, but came on for the second-half. ""We had enough chances to make it 2-0, but we were punished."" Bayern had got off to a promising start and showed their class when German international Thomas Mueller beat three defenders on the right and crossed to the far post where Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri drilled the ball home on 23 minutes. Freiburg started to exert some second-half pressure, however, and were rewarded with the equaliser four minutes from time. Substitute Mike Hanke switched play from the left to the right wing, where Sebastian Freis swung in a cross which midfielder Nicolas Hoefler fired past goalkeeper Manuel Neuer from close range to delight the home fans. Freiburg coach Christian Streich was delighted with his side's determination to hold the defending champions. ""When you play against Bayern Munich, you need above all an extremely high tolerance to frustration,"" he said. ""It's absolutely fantastic how we dealt with losing possession and worked hard to get it back."""

It means Gundogan will miss Germany's World Cup Qualifier against Austria in Munich on September 6 and away to Faroe Islands in Torshavn four days later, as well as at least Dortmund's next three league matches. Having joined from Nuremberg in 2011, Gundogan has risen to become first choice defensive midfielder for Dortmund and has put pressure on Bayern Munich's Bastian Schweinsteiger and Real Madrid's Sami Khedira for their places in the national side. His contract expires in June 2015, but Dortmund are eager to extend Gundogan's deal. ""I believe that he will stay,"" said Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke.

On Thursday, Loew will name his squad for the World Cup qualifiers at home against Austria and away to Faroe Islands on September 6 and 10 respectively, but is set to name Fiorentina's Mario Gomez and Lazio's Miroslav Klose as his strikers. Having clearly stated last season that he does not expect a Germany recall under Loew, Kiessling was irritated by further questions on the subject. ""At the moment, I've as much interest in the World Cup as damp cheese,"" said Kiessling, the Bundesliga's top scorer last season. ""I gave a clear statement last season and it's not my job to comment on the issue every time it comes up."" After scoring 25 goals in 34 games last season, Kiessling has already hit two in the three league games so far and netted his 100th Bundesliga goal on Saturday when he converted a 23rd-minute penalty. After his side joined Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Mainz as the four teams with a 100 percent records after three Bundesliga matches, Leverkusen coach Sami Hyypia, the ex-Liverpool and Finland defender, said he just wants to see Kiessling play well for his club. ""Mr Loew makes his decisions and it would be unfair of me to criticise a colleague,"" said the 39-year-old. ""It's just important for me that Stefan plays well and scores for us."""

The hosts rode their luck in the first half as only the crossbar denied Nuremberg when striker Daniel Ginczek's shot clattered off the underside of the bar with Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer beaten on 15 minutes. Bayern were awarded a penalty on 33 minutes by referee Christian Dingert when Robben was brought down by Sweden defender Per Nilsson, although the replay showed the Dutchman used his hand to keep the ball from going out.

With time running out, Ribery headed home before a fine solo effort from Robben, cutting in from the right, on 78 minutes ensured that Bayern would maintain their 100 percent league record this season. Only goal difference leaves Bayern third behind leaders Borussia Dortmund, who beat Werder Bremen 1-0 at home on Friday, and second-placed Bayer Leverkusen.

The visitors had defender Benedikt Hoewedes sent off on 14 minutes for bringing down Hanover striker Mame Diouf with only the goalkeeper to beat and Hungary midfielder Szabolcs Huszti drilled home the penalty. Diouf then headed home three minutes from the break to leave Schalke reeling before striker Adam Szalai pulled one back for Schalke in the second-half. There was a flurry of cards in the last 15 minutes as Hanover's Huszti was sent off for fouling Schalke's Tim Hoogland, then Schalke left-back Christian Fuchs was dismissed five minutes from time for a second yellow card. Having also been hammered 4-0 at Wolfsburg last Saturday, Schalke have just one point from their first three games and lie 14th in the table. Another defeat at PAOK will leave coach Jens Keller in a precarious position.

The visitors had defender Benedikt Hoewedes sent off on 14 minutes for bringing down Hanover striker Mame Diouf with only the goalkeeper to beat and Hungary midfielder Szabolcs Huszti drilled home the penalty. Diouf then headed home three minutes from the break to leave Schalke reeling before striker Adam Szalai pulled one back for Schalke in the second-half. There was a flurry of cards in the last 15 minutes as Hanover's Huszti was sent off for fouling Schalke's Tim Hoogland, then Schalke left-back Christian Fuchs was dismissed five minutes from time for a second yellow card. Having also been hammered 4-0 at Wolfsburg last Saturday, Schalke have just one point from their first three games and lie 14th in the table. Another defeat at PAOK will leave coach Jens Keller in a precarious position.

Lewandowski celebrated his 101st Bundesliga appearance when he converted Marco Reus's cross from the right in the 55th minute to claim the three points. ""I had a lot of chances and we're happy that we won, but we have to improve our game, 1-0 at home is not enough,"" admitted Lewandowski, who turned 25 on Wednesday.

""In a way it was good that we didn't score earlier, because it would have taken some of the fire out of the players,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""This way, they had their feet on the gas for the whole 90 minutes. ""Having nine points after only three games and talking about how we can improve is almost a luxury problem.""

1323,23/08/2013,15:15,Football: Dortmund's delight at record sales and profit,"Sensible trading on the transfer market coupled with consistently strong performances on the pitch are the main factors behind Borussia Dortmund's record financial returns, according to CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke.","Dortmund have posted record turnover of 305 million euros revenue (US$407.6m) and 53.3 million euros profit after tax for the 2012/13 fiscal year, up from 215.2m and 34.3m respectively the previous year, despite winning no silverware last season. Dortmund's bumper figures leave them second only in the Bundesliga to German champions Bayern Munich who posted just over 373m euros of turnover for the 2011/12 season having won an unprecedented treble of Champions League, German title and German Cup last season. Despite losing May's Champions League final 2-1 to Bayern at Wembley, Dortmund's sales revenue is up 42 percent on the previous year and Watzke put the boosted figures down to the performances of Jurgen Klopp's team. ""We have been growing very fast and very dynamically for the past few years,"" Watzke said after the figures were released on Thursday. ""The longevity of our sporting development is the most important thing here above all else."" Dortmund finished runner-up in both last season's Champions League and Bundesliga having won the league and cup double in the 2011-12 season, but their progress in Europe last season reaped big returns. Reaching the Wembley final brought in 54 million euros alone, while Dortmund also made twelve million euros revenue from their six Champions League home matches. While their marketing and merchandise sales are also up, any revenue earned on the transfer market was quickly reinvested. The 37 million euros pocketed from the sale of Germany midfielder Mario Goetze to Bayern was spent on attacking midfielders Henrikh Mkhitaryan (27.5m euros) and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (13m). Greece defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos (9.5m) was also signed from Werder Bremen. Having only narrowly avoided bankruptcy in 2005 after borrowing heavily to recruit players and pay their inflated wage bill, Watzke has insisted on a transfer policy that only money earned can be invested in new players."

""Yes, it's not the first time we've met and we know each other well,"" said Guardiola of the self-styled ""special one"" Mourinho. ""I have huge respect for his career and you can't forget the Bayern-Chelsea game, but we have two more games before us and the next match is always the most important one. ""Bayern have never won it (the Super Cup) and it's an important title. ""I don't know what will happen next Friday, but they will win it sooner or later."" The Prague showdown rekindles memories of past El Clasico clashes with ex-Barcelona boss Guardiola against Chelsea's former Real Madrid coach Mourinho, but before that Bayern face Bundesliga matches at home to Nuremberg on Saturday, then away to Freiburg on Tuesday. Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has described the next seven days as ""the first hot phase"" of the Bavarians' season and the triple-bill of matches will test Guardiola's new 4-1-4-1 formation. Bayern host Nuremberg at Munich's Allianz Arena without Spain's Javi Martinez, who is lacking match fitness according to the Bayern boss, while France winger Franck Ribery is back in the team after an ankle injury kept him out of last Saturday's 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Germany star Mario Goetze is set to make his league debut for Bayern following his transfer from Borussia Dortmund having last played in April after a hamstring injury. The 21-year-old attacking midfielder was on the bench for last Saturday's win at Frankfurt, but has yet to play a Bundesliga match for Munich. ""The important thing is that he feels fit,"" said Guardiola. ""His legs are fit and his head is right, which is good for us. ""I don't know if he'll start or play a few minutes and I'll decide that in the morning."" Only goal difference behind Dortmund is keeping joint second-placed Bayern off the top of the German league table after winning both of their opening league matches. Although Nuremberg have drawn both of their opening games, Guardiola was full of respect for the Bavarian derby. ""A derby is very special and they are always tough games, Nuremberg will be 100 percent focussed, so it will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, while Nuremberg coach Michael Wiesinger has said his team will not heading to Munich ""to go sightseeing""."

Defending champions Bayern Munich, Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen, who host Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday, and Mainz 05, who are home to VfL Wolfsburg the same day, are the other three Bundesliga times with 100 percent records. Bremen have won both their matches under new coach Robin Dutt by with 1-0 victories away against promoted Eintracht Braunschweig and home to Augbsurg respectively having flirted with relegation last season. Bremen last lifted some silverware when they won the German Cup in 2009, but Klopp said their is too much talent in the Bremen team to take them lightly at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. ""There is a lot of attacking potential slumbering in this Bremen squad, so we have to be very careful,"" said Klopp with Bremen expected to give Argentinian striker Franco di Santo his debut after signing from Wigan Athletic a week ago. Champions League finalists Dortmund have had just four days to prepare for Bremen's visit since their 2-1 home win over promoted Braunschweig last Sunday. Borussia needed 75 minutes before rising star Jonas Hofmann broke the deadlock with a super strike before Germany's Marco Reus netted a penalty to claim the three points. Klopp expects Bremen to have a similar game plan to Braunchweig to defend hard and hit Dortmund on the break whenever possible. ""Bremen have showed they are very patient, it might be that Bremen will have similar match plan as Braunschweig,"" said the 46-year-old. Dortmund's Australian reserve goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak could be set to play with Roman Weidenfeller suffering from gastroenteritis, while Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan sits out again with a back injury he aggravated on international duty last week. Defending champions Bayern host Nuremberg on Saturday with Germany midfield star Mario Goetze set to make his league debut since joining from Borussia Dortmund for 37 million euros (US$49.5m). ""Obviously it's going to take a little longer before I recover my rhythm and really get back to 100 percent,"" said the 21-year-old Goetze who has not played since tearing his hamstring in April's Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid for Dortmund. France winger Franck Ribery is out with an ankle injury he suffered in last Saturday's 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Javi Martinez, who has yet to lose a league game for Bayern, is in contention for selection again having been left out of the match day squad at Frankfurt after a long flight back from Ecuador after playing for Spain. Hamburg travel to Hertha Berlin on Saturday looking for an improved performance after they were hammered 5-1 at home to Hoffenheim last Saturday. Coach Thorsten Fink was so furious with his team that he gave them two days off, but both midfielder Tomas Rincon and defender Dennis Aogo have been thrown out of the squad for using the time to fly to Mallorca. ""The two days off had been meant to think about what they could do better in future, not to go partying. They couldn't have made a worse decision,"" said Hamburg CEO Carl Jarchow, with the north German team having leaked eight goals in just two games.

""This summer I was disappointed and bitter but the differences have been erased and the subject is closed. What counts now is titles,"" he told Sport Bild magazine in an interview published Wednesday. However, there is no chance of him going back on his decision. ""This will be my final season at Dortmund,"" he added. Lewandowski did gain one concession to his contract which runs out in May 2014, negotiating a pay rise from 1.5 million euros ($2 million) a year to five million euros ($6.7 million) for his final 10 months in Dortmund. The Warsaw native has even set his sights on wrenching all three trophies Bayern won last season from the Bavarian giants, who also claimed the German Cup on top of their Champions League and Bundesliga successes. But Lewandowski said he expected ""a huge battle right to the end of the championship"". And he added that Borussia are ""better armed than last year"" despite the sale of star playmaker Mario Goetze to Bayern. ""With (new signings) Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Sokratis and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, we have a better squad than last year,"" he added. Dortmund started the season with two straight victories with Aubameyang netting a hat-trick in their opening 4-0 win over Augsbourg before Lewandowski himself scored an own goal in the 2-1 success against Eintracht Brunswick last weekend."
1327,20/08/2013,13:49,Football: Schalke wary of Stevens in Champions League battle,Germany's Schalke 04 go into Wednesday's Champions League play-off first leg against Greece's PAOK Salonika on the back of a Bundesliga hammering and wary of former coach Huub Stevens.,"Schalke were routed 4-0 at Wolfsburg last Saturday when their shredded defence leaked four second-half goals, while they also lost Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar for the next four weeks with torn medial ligaments in his right knee. Losing the two-leg play-off, with the return match on August 27 at PAOK's Stadio Toumba, would have financial consequences and Schalke are low on confidence after leaking seven goals in their first two Bundesliga games. The Royal Blues made 27.8 million euros (US$37.2m), not including ticket revenue from the four home games, when they reached the last 16 of last season's Champions League, eventually losing to Turkey's Galatasaray. Schalke fired Stevens in December after a poor run of results and replaced him with current coach Jens Keller. The 59-year-old Stevens coached Schalke in 304 matches from 1996 to 2002 and then had a 15-month period back in Gelsenkirchen until he was sacked last December. Having also worked at German clubs Hamburg, Cologne and Hertha Berlin, Stevens has ominously never lost at Schalke's Veltins Arena as the away coach. ""I am really looking forward to the reunion. Schalke has the first place in my heart,"" said Stevens. Despite a difficult second spell in charge at Schalke, the Dutchman returns to Gelsenkirchen as a legend having steered them to the 1997 UEFA Cup in his first stint as coach, but the Royal Blues are wary. ""Even if Huub is through and through a Schalke man, he will do all he can to try to beat us,"" said Schalke's director of sport Horst Heldt. Defensive midfielder Marco Hoeger also admitted having an uneasy feeling about Steven's return as PAOK replace Metalist Kharkiv, who were thrown out of the competition by UEFA for match-fixing. ""As a team, he knows us closely and will set his team out accordingly,"" said Hoeger. Schalke are aiming to qualify for the Champions League in successive seasons for the first time in their history. ""We will take a giant step forward if we reach the group stages this year,"" said Heldt. ""Three or four years in succession would be optimal, then we could reach the next level."" That would mean threatening Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund's current stranglehold on the Bundesliga title and would also give the Royal Blues a better chance of keeping hold of stars like 19-year-old Julian Draxler. Schalke lie 13th in the Bundesliga after two games and are already five points from the top five, where they want to be, but must stay positive. ""If we fall into self-pity and quarrel with ourselves that will not help for Wednesday,"" warned Hoeger."

Hofmann replaced Dortmund's other key signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, then took a crisp return pass from defender Mats Hummels to drill his shot in off the far post on 75 minutes. Hofmann was then fouled in the area five minutes from time allowing Reus to drill home the penalty for Dortmund's second before Braunschweig pulled one back when Kevin Kratz's 89th-minute corner deflected in off Borussia's Poland striker Robert Lewandowski. It was not the way Lewandowski, Dortmund's top-scorer last season with 24 goals in 31 league games, would have wanted to celebrate his 100th top-flight match, while coach Jurgen Klopp enjoyed his 100th German league win with Borussia. ""Braunschweig stuck to their defensive plan, but in the second-half we had lots of chances,"" said Klopp, as Dortmund enjoyed 66 percent possession and 17 shots on goal compared to Eintracht's four. ""Jonas Hofmann turned the game for us in the right direction, so all-in-all, I'm pleased."" After Aubameyang hit a hat-trick on his German league debut in last weekend's 4-0 rout of Augsburg, the three points leave Dortmund top of the table on goal difference with European champions Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen in joint second. Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake crashed in an 89th-minute free-kick to rescue a point in Nuremberg's 2-2 draw with Hertha Berlin. Nuremberg had taken a 40th-minute lead when striker Daniel Ginczek held off two defenders to set up Swiss striker Josip Drmic to blast his shot home. Berlin drew level when Tunisia striker Sami Allagui's shot bounced in off the chest of Nuremberg centre-back Berkay Dabanli on 61 minutes. Brazilian midfielder Ronny then netted a 79th-minute penalty for Hertha before Kiyotake's late leveller shared the points. On Saturday, defending champions Bayern laboured to a 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt while both Hamburg and Schalke 04 suffered heavy defeats which left Leverkusen in second after their 1-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic gave Bayern the three points at Frankfurt when he volleyed home a cross from Germany's Thomas Mueller on 13 minutes. It was a rare highlight in a below-par performance as Bayern failed to dominate, despite enjoying 70 percent possession, while Frankfurt captain Alex Meier had a goal ruled offside and a penalty appeal turned down in the dying stages. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, taking charge of only his second Bundesliga match, started with Dutch winger Arjen Robben, Germany star Mario Goetze and new-signing Thiago Alcantara all on the bench. Spain's Javi Martinez was left out of the squad after playing the full 90 minutes of Spain's 2-0 friendly win in Ecuador on Wednesday. Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo, who signed for Wolfsburg last week from Bayern after rejecting offers from Arsenal and Barcelona, made his debut in their 4-0 rout at home over Schalke 04. There was more bad news for Schalke on Sunday as Holland striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar was ruled out for the next four weeks after tearing medial ligaments in his right knee. Schalke will be without Huntelaar for their Champions League play-off, first-leg, at home to Greece's PAOK on Wednesday. Hamburg were humiliated 5-1 at home by Hoffenheim as Brazilian striker Roberto Firmino ran riot, scoring twice and setting up the other three. Mainz enjoyed a 2-1 win at Freiburg while Bremen picked up another win with a 1-0 victory at home over Bavaria's Augsburg.

It was not the way Lewandowski, Dortmund's top-scorer last season with 24 goals in 31 league games, would have wanted to celebrate his 100th top flight match, while coach Jurgen Klopp enjoyed his 100th German league win with Borussia. After Aubameyang hit a hat-trick on his German league debut in last weekend's 4-0 rout of Augsburg, the three points leave Dortmund top of the table on goal difference with European champions Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen in joint second. Earlier, Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake crashed in an 89th-minute free-kick to rescue a point in Nuremberg's 2-2 draw with Hertha Berlin. Hosts Nuremberg had taken a 40th-minute lead when striker Daniel Ginczek held off two defenders to set up Swiss striker Josip Drmic to blast his shot home. Berlin drew level when Tunisia striker Sami Allagui's shot bounced in off the chest of Nuremberg centre-back Berkay Dabanli on 61 minutes. Brazilian midfielder Ronny then netted a 79th-minute penalty for Hertha before Kiyotake's late leveller shared the points. On Saturday, defending champions Bayern laboured to a 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt while both Hamburg and Schalke 04 suffered heavy defeats which left Leverkusen in second after their 1-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic gave Bayern the three points at Frankfurt when he volleyed home a cross from Germany's Thomas Mueller on 13 minutes. It was a rare highlight in a below-par performance as Bayern failed to dominate, despite enjoying 70 percent possession, while Frankfurt captain Alex Meier had a goal ruled offside and a penalty appeal turned down in the dying stages. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, taking charge of only his second Bundesliga match, started with Dutch winger Arjen Robben, Germany star Mario Goetze and new-signing Thiago Alcantara all on the bench. Spain's Javi Martinez was left out of the squad after playing the full 90 minutes of Spain's 2-0 friendly win in Ecuador on Wednesday. Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo, who signed for Wolfsburg last week from Bayern after rejecting offers from Arsenal and Barcelona, made his debut in their 4-0 rout at home over Schalke 04. There was more bad news for Schalke on Sunday as Holland striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar was ruled out for the next four weeks after tearing medial ligaments in his right knee. Schalke will be without Huntelaar for their Champions League play-off, first-leg, at home to Greece's PAOK on Wednesday. Hamburg were humiliated 5-1 at home by Hoffenheim as Brazilian striker Roberto Firmino ran riot, scoring twice and setting up the other three. Mainz enjoyed a 2-1 win at Freiburg while Bremen picked up another win with a 1-0 victory at home over Bavaria's Augsburg. Borussia Moenchengladbach bounced back from their opening day defeat at Bayern with a 3-0 win at home against Hanover 96."

Before the match, Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer told German daily Bild that the defending champions must raise their standards. ""At the moment, others (in the league) may feel that they have a hope against us, but we have to make sure they get the feeling again that they have no chance,"" he said, but his words failed to fire the Bavarians in Frankfurt.

Having cost Bayern 37 million euros (US$49.2m), Goetze is another top name coach Pep Guardiola needs to accomodate in his star-studded midfield. Goetze is an option alongside Spain Under-21 captain Thiago Alcantara in an attacking midfield role, flanked by France winger Franck Ribery and Germany's Thomas Mueller, leaving Dutchman Robben on the bench. The 29-year-old, who scored Bayern's winning goal in May's Champions League final against Dortmund, only returned to the starting line-up last season after injury to Toni Kroos, but the he said competition for places is a healthy thing in the Bayern ranks. ""It was our strength last season that we never lost our quality, even when players dropped out with injury,"" Robben told German daily Bild.

And they could be forgiven for feeling a sense of trepidation ahead of this weekend's game, given that Bayern have not lost in any of their last 19 away matches in the Bundesliga. Bayern's Spain star Javi Martinez will also be looking to maintain his remarkable Bundesliga record of having yet to lose a German league match after 25 wins and three draws. Champions League finalists Dortmund host promoted Eintracht Braunschweig on Sunday with Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan out for two weeks with a back injury he aggravated playing for his country in Wednesday's 3-3 draw with Paraguay. Dortmund got off to a flying start last weekend when Gabon forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick on his Bundesliga debut in the 4-0 win at Augsburg. And Poland striker Robert Lewandowski is set to make his 100th league appearance having scored 55 goals in Germany's top flight. Having won promotion, Braunschweig went down to a late goal at Werder Bremen last weekend. Their coach Torsten Lieberknecht and Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp were teammates at Mainz between 1995 and 2001, while Lieberknecht's last five games for Mainz came with Klopp as coach.

Bobadilla was under contract at Basel until 2017, but was suspended by the club in July after being stopped by police having driven his Maserati sports car at 111 kilometres per hour (69mph) through a village where the limit was 50kph (31mph). Basel signed the Argentinian from Swiss league rivals Young Boys in January while he was still completing a seven-match ban for insulting a referee after being shown a red card. Augsburg coach Mark Weinzierl said he hopes Bobadilla will strengthen their attack, which failed to score in last Saturday's 4-0 defeat at home to Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga season. ""I am grateful to FC Augsburg for giving giving me the chance to play in the Bundesliga again,"" Bobadilla said.

""We're really looking forward to the game,"" said Germany manager Oliver Bierhoff ahead of the friendly in Kaiserslautern with the hosts ranked second in the world and Paraguay are 49th. ""It's our first match of a season which will finish with the World Cup and we want to play with renewed enthusiasm. ""The match is important for everyone with a view towards the important qualifiers in September against Austria and the Faroe Islands. ""We want to qualify as quickly as possible and our match against Paraguay is a step towards that goal."" Germany are five points clear at the top of Group C in the European World Cup qualifying pool and two wins next month will leave Loew's team on course to book their Brazil 2014 berth in October's away matches in Sweden and the Republic of Ireland. Paraguay are out of the running in the South American qualifying group as they are bottom of the table. Coached by Victor Genes, Paraguay return to Kaiserslautern's Fritz Walter Stadium where they enjoyed a victory over Trinidad and Tobago at the 2006 World Cup. Genes has called up 15 foreign-based players in his 21-man squad, the most interesting name being Barcelona's 17-year-old forward Antonio Sanabria, who has risen through his country's junior teams and wins his first selection for the senior side. Sanabria's teammate from the Paraguay Under-20 side, Jorge Rojas, is also on the plane to Germany and the Benfica winger has considerable pace. Notable absentees include ex-Borussia Dortmund striker Lucas Barrios, who has just completed a move from China's Guangzhou Evergrande to Russia's Spartak Moscow as Genes favours youth over experience. Loew has named two strikers in his squad in Fiorentina's Mario Gomez and Lazio's Miroslav Klose. The 35-year-old Klose is on 67 goals for his country, just one short of Gerd Mueller's astonishing record of 68 goals in 62 games for West Germany from 1966-74. Both Dortmund midfielders Ilkay Gundogan and Marco Reus sat out training on Monday as a precautionary measure. Gundogan had a sore back while fleet-footed winger Reus, who scored twice in Germany's 4-1 win over Kazakhstan in March, has a light cold, but both are expected to train with the team on Tuesday."

Schalke's new-signing Adam Szalai scored the Royal Blues' crucial third goal to share the points with Hamburg while Gabon forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang marked his Dortmund debut with a hat-trick. Mainz's Shinji Okazaki of Japan and Leverkusen's South Korea star Son Heung-Min both also scored on their respective debuts. But there was bad news for Germany coach Joachim Loew as Schalke's teenage midfielder Julian Draxler withdrew from Wednesday's international friendly against Paraguay. The 19-year-old attacking midfielder limped off after only 23 minutes against Hamburg having damaged his left Achilles tendon. ""The injury could quickly get inflamed and turn into a long drawn-out affair, so it makes no sense (for him to play on Wednesday),"" said Schalke team manager Horst Heldt. Schalke took the lead at home to Hamburg when Holland striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar struck after just 84 seconds before compatriot Rafael van der Vaart netted a 12th-minute penalty to level. Striker Maximilian Beister produced a bullet header on 24 minutes to put Hamburg in front before Huntelaar levelled right at the end of the first half. Ex-Dortmund defender Lasse Sobiech then headed the hosts ahead just after half-time before Hungary's Szalai, who joined Schalke from Mainz in the summer, pounced on a mistake by Hamburg goalkeeper Rene Adler on 72 minutes for a share of the points. Okazaki netted in Mainz 05's 3-2 home win over his ex-club VfB Stuttgart -- who he left last month. Mainz picked up three points when Germany midfielder Nicolai Mueller netted goals either side of Okazaki's 65th-minute strike. Mueller scored his first after just 14 minutes, but Bosnia striker Vedad Ibisevic levelled just two minutes later. Okazaki, who joined Mainz on July 1 in a three-year deal after two years at Stuttgart, slotted home his team's second when he converted a cross from Czech Republic defender Zdenek Pospech before Meuller made it 3-1, 12 minutes from time. Stuttgart's Martin Harnik gave his side hope with eight minutes left to make it 3-2, but Mainz hung on. Aubameyang, 24, showed why Dortmund paid French League Cup winners St Etienne 13 million euros (US$17.3m) for him as he became the sixth player in Bundesliga history to hit three goals on his debut. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski converted a penalty in the dying stages to complete Augsburg's misery. South Korea's Son also netted on his first competitive appearance for Champions League hopefuls Bayer Leverkusen in their 3-1 win at home to Freiburg. Hertha Berlin marked their return to the top-flight after a year's absence with a stunning 6-1 rout of Eintracht Frankfurt. Colombia striker Adrian Ramos and Tunisia forward Sami Allagui each scored twice in the hammering at Berlin's Olympic Stadium while a first-half penalty from Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder Alex Meier was all the guests could muster. Hanover 96 enjoyed a 2-0 win over Wolfsburg, who finished with nine men after both midfielder Maximilian Arnold and Swiss defender Timm Klose were sent off.

1354,08/08/2013,18:19,Football: Dortmund's Langerak aiming for lucky 11th,Australian goalkeeper Mitch Langerak is hoping to maintain his 10-match winning streak when Borussia Dortmund kick off their Bundesliga season on Saturday at Augsburg.,"The 24-year-old reserve 'keeper will be making his 11th appearance for Borussia, last season's German league runners-up, when he steps in for Dortmund's suspended goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller at Bavaria's Augsburg. Having made six league and four cup appearances for Dortmund since joining from A-League side Melbourne Victory in June 2010, Langerak has yet to lose in a Borussia shirt -- something coach Jurgen Klopp is obviously happy about. ""You think you are getting a beach boy from Australia, but what you actually get is an unbelievable hard worker,"" said Klopp. ""Mitch is a very competitive character: goalkeeper is one position which we can react without problems when there are any injuries."" While Langerak will be between the posts in Augsburg, Dortmund will be missing new signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan, after the Armenian midfielder twisted his ankle in pre-season, while Gabon forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Greek defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos are expected to start on the bench. Of his 10 wins, Langerak's stand-out performance was in the 2012 German Cup final when Weidenfeller was injured after half an hour and Langerak came on to help Borussia to a 5-2 win over Bayern Munich. ""For me, these are just statistics,"" the modest Queenslander said of his impressive record having also played in last Saturday's 3-0 win at fourth-division SV Wilhelmshaven in the first round of the German Cup. ""Whenever I play, I just want to produce a good performance."" Having won the German title with Dortmund in both the 2010/11 and 2011/12 seasons, Langerak has faced top sides such as Bayern, Hamburg and Leverkusen on his rare Bundesliga appearances. The Australian is under contract until 2016 and his employers are clearly grooming him to replace the 33-year-old Weidenfeller. ""Mitch is the competitive type: he's strong both on the line and in the air, plus he's brave,"" added Dortmund's director of sport Michael Zorc."
1355,08/08/2013,16:52,Football: Bayern's Guardiola ready for 'dangerous' Gladbach,Pep Guardiola has insisted he is ready to cope with the weight of expectation on him as Bayern Munich kick-off the Bundesliga season on Friday by hosting Borussia Moenchengladbach.,"The 42-year-old ex-Barcelona boss has had just under eight weeks to work with the German champions; who host 'Gladbach at Munich's Allianz Arena in the season opener. Bayern are likely to be without new signing Thiago Alcantara for the game as the Spain Under-21 captain missed training on Thursday with a fever. Guardiola has already made his mark at Bayern, introducing a new playing system and experimenting with players out of position. Having already overseen 11 pre-season matches, with the shock 4-2 German Super Cup loss at Borussia Dortmund a fortnight ago as the only defeat, Guardiola had some lighthearted advice for his players. ""Get the ball, have fun and attack as much as possible,"" he said in his pre-match press conference. ""And if Gladbach have the ball, help each other -- and win."" Simple enough, but Guardiola knows he is under pressure to repeat last season's success under predecessor Jupp Heynckes, when Bayern became the first German team to win the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup. ""I have to win here,"" he stressed, having taken charge of Bayern after a year's sabbatical in New York. ""If I hadn't accepted that, I would have stayed in New York."" Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer only added to the notion that Guardiola's honeymoon period is over when he said: ""Now there are no more excuses, the results must now count"". Bayern hammered hosts 'Gladbach 5-1 over 60 minutes in the final of Borussia's pre-season tournament three weeks ago, but Guardiola insisted Munich can expect a ""very, very dangerous game"" against Borussia who have a ""super, super coach"" in Lucien Favre. ""They are one of the best teams in the Bundesliga, we have to forget our recent win there,"" added Guardiola. Guardiola's new 4-1-4-1 system will receive the litmus test against Gladbach, but Dutch winger Arjen Robben, who scored Bayern's winner at Wembley in the Champions League final, said he was impressed with what he has seen so far from Guardiola. ""I like his playing philosophies and I think the team do too,"" said the 29-year-old Robben. ""Of course, it always takes a bit of time to get used to each other when a new coach arrives. ""There are lots of new, good ideas, but there is no need to exaggerate things, because it's not as though we will play that differently."""
