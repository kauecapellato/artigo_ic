0,02/11/2020,23:05,Villarreal up to third after win over Valladolid,Villarreal climbed to third place in La Liga on Monday with a 2-0 victory at home to rock-bottom Real Valladolid that left Unai Emery's side two points off top spot.,Nigeria winger Samuel Chukwueze bagged his first goal of the season with a classy left-foot finish on 21 minutes and Pau Torres added a second before half-time. Villarreal are unbeaten in seven games in all competitions since a 4-0 defeat by Barcelona on September 27. Real Sociedad occupy first place in Spain with Real Madrid a point back in second. Atletico Madrid are another two points behind but have two games in hand on the leaders.
1,25/11/2018,18:35,Sevilla go top of La Liga after narrow win over Real Valladolid,Sevilla moved back to the top of La Liga on Sunday as they capitalised on the stuttering form of their rivals by beating Real Valladolid 1-0.,"Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Barcelona all failed to win on Saturday as Real were beaten 3-0 by Eibar before Atletico and Barca played out a 1-1 draw at the Wanda Metropolitano. The way was open for Sevilla to take advantage and they made no mistake, Andre Silva continuing his excellent start to the season by heading in the winner at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. They certainly rode their luck, twice needing VAR to deny Real Valladolid an equaliser, with the first cancellation particularly fortunate. Enes Unal´s strike was ruled out as the offside Toni Villa was deemed to be obstructing the goalkeeper´s view. Victory puts Sevilla one point above Barcelona at the summit, two clear of Atletico and six ahead of Real. After a slow start to the season, Pablo Machin´s side are now unbeaten in seven games in all competitions, while in the league, they have lost only once, to Barca, in their last nine. Real Valladolid, now owned by Ronaldo, the former Brazil striker, had been in excellent form too in recent weeks but three games without a win means they drop to 12th. Silva´s goal was his eighth of the season and relatively straightforward as he peeled away at the back post to head Pablo Sarabia´s cross in off the post. Sarabia had done well to make space with a sharp turn inside the box. La Real pushed hard for an equaliser in the second half and twice thought they had it. Unal, on as a substitute, rifled home on the hour but Villa, standing offside and close to the goalkeeper, was judged to be interfering with play. The second decision was more clear-cut, Unal firing in a rebound from close range but this time it was him that had strayed offside. Sevilla could have had a second, with Wissam Ben Yedder twice going close while Sarabia forced a strong save from Jordi Masip with a long-range drive. In the end, one was enough."
2,02/11/2018,12:42,Valladolid fans dream big after takeover by Brazil great Ronaldo,"Fans of Spanish side Real Valladolid are dreaming of a big future for their modest club, who face Real Madrid on Saturday, after a recent takeover by former Brazil striker Ronaldo.","""We have never seen that here. Now anyone can locate us on a map, not only in Spain, but on a global level,"" said Rocio Arenas, the president of the team's supporters' club, the ""Pirates of Pucela"". Valladolid, an industrial city of around 400,000 residents located some 200 kilometres (125 miles) northwest of Madrid, made global headlines in early September when Ronaldo Nazario in a surprise move bought 51 percent of Real Valladolid for 28 million euros ($32 million). ""Valladolid has a lot of assets. It's close to Madrid, it's a club with strong potential to grow, an institution that is well anchored in the region,"" said David Espinar, Ronaldo's right-hand man. Real Valladolid earned promotion back to the top tier last season. Sitting in a bar decorated in purple, the colour of the club and the city, Arenas dreams out loud of beating Ronaldo's former side Real Madrid. Ronaldo, a three-time Fifa World Player of the Year, played for the Spanish giants between 2002 and 2007 and remains an ""ambassador"" for the club. A Ronaldo jersey with its iconic number nine now sits on display in the window of Real Valladolid's shop in the centre of the city, a sign of the excitement that his purchase of the club has sparked. ""Since we heard of the sale of the club, not a day has gone by without someone talking to me about Ronaldo,"" said Jose Antonio Perez, the president of the federation of Real Valladolid supporters' clubs. Shortly after taking control of the club, Ronaldo shared a meal with Perez and the presidents of the supporters' clubs, he added. ""He asked questions all the time, 'how do you do that, how do you organise trips to see matches', like he was a simple supporter,"" said Perez. Mario Puertas, a 37-year-old forklift driver who was also at the event, said it took Ronaldo 15 minutes to walk 10-15 metres from his car to the restaurant ""because when people saw him, they would stop him, they wanted to take a photo with him."" The club's supporters never felt such excitement, not even when Real Vallodolid reached the final of the Copa del Rey and qualified for the UEFA Cup in his youth, Puertas added. ""It was nothing like this,"" he said. Ronaldo, 42, has so far announced few concrete measures for the club, aside from opening an office for the team in Madrid where he continues to live to help him seek business partners and develop young players. ""You have to see it positively. It would give me vertigo if someone arrived and, during their first week, launched 10 enormous and expensive projects,"" said Alberto Bustos, the Valladolid city councillor in charge of sports. The club's sporting director, Miguel Angel Gomez, praised Ronaldo's ""ties with very important clubs, which can bring us closer to players we would normally not have access to."" While Ronaldo, who also played for Barcelona, Inter and AC Milan, talks of giving Valladolid a national or even international dimension, the only official on-field goal is to avoid relegation this season. Sergio Gonzalez's team sit in sixth place in La Liga with 16 points, two points above Madrid and eight points clear of the relegation zone. They head to the Bernabeu unbeaten in six league games. Since his retirement in 2011, Ronaldo has opened football academies in Brazil, Hong Kong and the United States as well as sports marketing firms. He had previously owned a minority stake in North American Soccer League (NASL) outfit Fort Lauderdale Strikers, but the club was dissolved in 2016. This failure has not dampened the faith of Real Valladolid's supporters. ""He has prestige, it is not possible that he will be the one who ruins Real Valladolid,"" said Perez."
3,03/09/2018,13:36,Brazil great Ronaldo buys 51 percent of Real Valladolid,"Former Brazilian striker Ronaldo has taken control of Real Valladolid after buying 51 percent of the La Liga club's shares, it was announced on Monday.","At a press conference held in the city's town hall, Valladolid president Carlos Suarez said: ""Today is a starting point. Ronaldo personally acquires 51 percent of the shares of Real Valladolid."" ""He is an idol that loves and spreads a dream."" Ronaldo played in Spain for Real Madrid and Barcelona, while also winning the World Cup twice with Brazil. ""This is a very important day for me,"" he said. ""I've gone through a lot to prepare both within the game and outside it. ""You can count on us to consolidate Real Valladolid in the top division and to keep building our dream."" Valladolid earned promotion to the top tier last season and sit 16th, after two draws and a defeat from their opening three games. La Liga also opened an investigation last month into the poor condition of the club's pitch at their Jose Zorrilla stadium, following a 1-0 loss to Barcelona. Ronaldo will bring a sprinkling of stardust, with the former forward widely regarded as one of the game's greatest ever players. He retired in 2011, having been named Fifa World Player of the Year in 1996, 1997 and 2002. The 41-year-old has appealed to the Valladolid fans to help shape the club's future. ""I want everyone to be a part of this club and I invite the fans to participate in this project,"" he said. ""To give us ideas, opinions, criticisms and aspirations. I want you to be part of the present and future of Real Valladolid."""
4,12/05/2014,03:04,Football: Diego Costa's World Cup twists and turns,"Playing at a World Cup in the land of your birth is a dream for most footballers, however Diego Costa's road back to Brazil will see him lead the line for their arch-rivals.","Costa made his debut for Brazil against Italy in March 2012. In March of this year he made a new debut against Italy, this time for Spain. After just two friendly appearances for La Selecao, Costa was allowed under FIFA rules to switch allegiance to Spain. He did that in November of last year and now he will be a key player in the World Cup Group B battles against Netherlands, Chile and Australia. The nationality changes was one of many twists and turns in the career of the 25-year-old goalscorer. Signed by Portuguese side Braga when he was just 17, Costa joined Atletico Madrid a year later. However, it was not until he returned to Atletico with Diego Simeone at the helm after four loan spells at Celta Vigo, Albacete, Valladolid and Rayo Vallecano that he even became a first-team regular at the club. And last season he scored 20 goals and formed a lethal partnership with Colombian star Radamel Falcao as Atletico beat city rivals Real Madrid for the first time in 14 years to win the Copa del Rey. This season, in Falcao's absence, he has taken another step up to become the team's talisman and top scorer. ""He will be the best injection Spain will have in Brazil. He is different to everyone else,"" Simeone said recently. ""He has great physical and mental strength, but can also still improve a lot. The Spanish national team will help him improve as well because it is a different style of play."" Costa failed to shine on his Spanish debut, but he did show flashes to suggest he is able enough technically to cope with his new teammates' tiki-taka style, which is in stark contrast to Atletico's power-based, counter-attacking game. Should his adaption prove successful he could turn out to be the final piece of the jigsaw for a Spanish side that has won the last two of their three consecutive major tournaments without a central striker in form. At the 2010 World Cup, David Villa scored his five goals from a wide left position, whilst at the Euros in 2012, Fernando Torres won the competition's golden boot with just three goals and having started just two of six games. Off the field Costa appears to have been welcomed with open arms by other members of the squad. ""He is a player that I love,"" said Barcelona full-back Jordi Alba before the Italy game, whilst coach Vicente del Bosque has tried to play down the controversy over Costa's switch of allegiance. ""His is a unique case. He was born in Brazil, but was formed here and has shown in his club that he deserves to come with us, that is why I have called him up,"" explained the former Real Madrid boss. However, Costa's volatile temperament could yet be tested. Never one to shy away from confrontation with opposing defenders or fans, he will be under intense scrutiny and is sure to receive a hostile reception from an unforgiving Brazilian public. For all the positive traits he can bring, should he lose his head Spain's chances of retaining their title could be ruined in an instant. That is a risk Del Bosque has proven himself ready to take."
5,13/03/2014,16:35,Football: Bale impressed by standard of La Liga,Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale has lauded the technical standard of La Liga in comparison to the Premier League just six months into his career with the Spanish giants.,"The Welshman joined Real for a reported 91 million euros ($126 million, £76 million) from Tottenham Hotspur in September after being crowned as the Premier League's best player by his fellow professionals and the football writers last season due to his stunning performances. However, he is enjoying the change to a less physical style of play in Spain and has been impressed by the willingness of even some of the sides struggling at the bottom of the table to try and play a passing game. ""The big difference is the tactical play and the way all teams play a lot of good football. There are no long balls like there are in England,"" he said on Thursday. ""That is the biggest thing about Spain, it is all passing and movement. It has been a new experience which I am obviously learning from and enjoying. ""All the teams, no matter if they are at the top or the bottom, try to play football. It is exciting, it is a great league and it is great to be playing here."" A series of niggling injuries plagued Bale's start to the campaign, but his return to fitness and form has coincided with Real embarking on a 29-game unbeaten run stretching back to October. Barcelona's surprise 1-0 defeat to Valladolid last weekend allowed Real to open up a four-point gap on their eternal rivals at the top of the table. However, Bale is taking nothing for granted as he targets three trophies in his first season in the Spanish capital. ""Obviously we are in a very good position at the moment, but there are still 11 games left to go. ""We need to take every game as it comes and concentrate only on our own performances. Hopefully we can keep playing well and achieve our goals."" Real face Barca twice in the next month in La Liga and the Copa del Rey final and could even meet four times in 25 days if they are drawn together in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Barca booked their place in the quarters on Wednesday with a 4-1 aggregate win over Manchester City. Madrid, meanwhile, are practically in the last eight too as they lead Schalke 6-1 from the first leg of their tie in Germany and Bale is sure they will face a tougher test in the next round. ""The Champions League is full of great teams, every team left in the competition can potentially win it. ""For me, everybody left in the competition can consider themselves a favourite and whoever we draw next it is going to be a difficult game. ""The tournament is really wide open and it just depends on who takes their chances."" Bale has managed to rack up 14 goals and 11 assists in just 25 appearances in La Liga and the Champions League so far this campaign, but he is sure there is more to come having overcome the initial challenges of a change in lifestyle when moving countries. ""Naturally it has taken me a bit of time to get used to everything, but I am really enjoying my football and especially the weather,"" he joked. ""I have enjoyed my six months in Spain so far. It took me a bit of time to get up to speed, but I think my performances have come on well. ""I still feel like there is a lot more to come from me. Hopefully, I can keep improving and playing well."""
