In a statement, UEFA said that both matches would take place as originally scheduled on February 18, with United kicking off at 1755 GMT and Arsenal 2000 GMT. Molde's home leg with Hoffenheim, also scheduled for 2000 GMT on the same day, has been moved to Villarreal's Estadio de la Ceramica. United's match was moved to the home of the Italian champions after the Spanish government on Tuesday extended a ban on flights from Britain, Brazil and South Africa from February 16 to March 2, in an attempt to stem the spread of new Covid-19 variants. Only legal residents or nationals of Spain and the neighbouring micro-state of Andorra are currently allowed in on flights from these countries. This is the fourth time that Spain has extended its restrictions on arrivals from Britain, which were initially put in place at the end of December. Arsenal meanwhile cannot make their way to Lisbon as the UK has ruled that only essential travel to and from Portugal is permitted. Spain's decision to extend the ban on arrivals from the UK could also mean Chelsea's visit to Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on February 23 is also moved. Spanish media report that La Liga leaders Atletico are considering Bucharest or Genoa in Italy as alternatives. bur-td/mw ALLIANZ MANCHESTER UNITED JUVENTUS FOOTBALL CLUB"

Antonio Sanabria was then sent off for Betis shortly before Sergio Canales equalised, with Iglesias striking in both halves of extra time to eliminate Sociedad. La Real will play Basque rivals Athletic Bilbao in the final of the 2019-20 competition on April 4, after it was postponed last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Villarreal edged past second-tier Girona 1-0 while Levante won 4-2 at Valladolid earlier on Tuesday. Lionel Messi will be available again after serving a two-match ban as Barcelona head to the capital to take on Rayo Vallecano on Wednesday. Athletic face Alcoyano, the third-division club that dumped out Real Madrid in the previous round, on Thursday."
2,23/01/2021,15:39,Wolves sign striker Willian Jose on loan from Real Sociedad,Wolves announced on Saturday they had completed the loan signing of Brazilian striker Willian Jose from Real Sociedad with a view to a permanent transfer.,"The deal, which is subject to a work permit and international clearance, takes the 29-year-old to Molineux until the end of the season. Wolves then have the option to make the switch permanent. Jose is not expected to be available for Wednesday's Premier League trip to Chelsea. Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo has been short of options up front since Raul Jimenez suffered a fractured skull two months ago. Wolves have won just one of their nine Premier League matches since, scoring 10 goals in the process. The striker, who was capped for Brazil at under-20 level, has scored 62 goals in 170 appearances for Sociedad, whom he joined in 2016."
3,14/01/2021,00:37,Barca reach Spanish Super Cup final after Ter Stegen penalty heroics,"Marc-Andre ter Stegen's heroics ensured Barcelona edged past Real Sociedad on penalties on Wednesday to reach the Spanish Super Cup final, without the injured Lionel Messi.","Messi was watching on as Ter Stegen did his best to fill the void in Cordoba, the goalkeeper immense both in the shoot-out and during normal time, which had finished 1-1. Frenkie de Jong's header was cancelled out by a penalty from Mikel Oyarzabal, who then missed in the shoot-out, one of two crucial saves made by Ter Stegen before 21-year-old Riqui Puig hit the winning shot. ""I wasn't down to take one but we needed one more taker and I stepped forward,"" said Puig. Barca advance to meet either Real Madrid or Athletic Bilbao in the final on Sunday, when Messi is expected to be available again, although coach Ronald Koeman was cautious at full-time. ""We have to wait,"" he said. Koeman's team have a mountain to climb in La Liga's title race but they are improving, now nine games unbeaten and with a trophy in their grasp. This is the second year of the Spanish Super Cup's new format, which has four teams playing each other in a semi-final and final. Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad joined after reaching the final of last season's Copa del Rey, which is still to be played, while Barcelona finished runners-up to Madrid in La Liga. Yet while last season's version controversially took place in Saudi Arabia, the pandemic means this year's semis are in Cordoba and Malaga, with the final to be played in Seville. Barca were the better side in the first half but had Ter Stegen to thank for not conceding early as Alexander Isak sped into the area only to see his chipped finish saved by the goalkeeper. It was De Jong's dash to the near post that brought the first goal, an Antoine Griezmann cross hanging just long enough for the midfielder to get there first and direct a superb header in. Yet De Jong gave Real Sociedad a way back just after half-time, the ball striking him on the hand and allowing Oyarzabal to equalise from the spot. Barca nearly pulled ahead instantly as De Jong swivelled in the box, only to take an unnecessary extra touch. Ousmane Dembele fired just wide and Trincao, on as a substitute, also had a chance to win it before the 90 minutes were up. Zaldua unleashed in extra time but Ter Stegen tipped over. Dembele's finish was saved too while Adnan Januzaj poked wide at the end of a brilliant run and then hit the post with a free-kick. Into the shoot-out, and Jon Bautista's first attempt was parried away by Ter Stegen, only for De Jong to hit the post. But Oyarzabal, who had scored earlier from the spot, this time missed, Ter Stegen guessing right again. Dembele scored before Willian Jose struck the post. Miralem Pjanic tucked in and so did Mikel Merino under pressure. Griezmann could have won it but ballooned over before Januzaj converted for 2-2, which left it up to Puig to win it for Barca, the youngster slamming home for a spot in the final."

Barca coach Ronald Koeman said on Tuesday the striker had felt discomfort during his side's 4-0 La Liga win over Granada on Saturday, when he was substituted in the second half. Messi trained on Monday and Tuesday but missed the last session before the match on Wednesday morning. The winner of Barcelona and Real Sociedad will face either Real Madrid or Athletic Bilbao, who play in the other semi-final on Thursday."
5,12/01/2021,16:26,Real Madrid defend Super Cup repatriated from Saudi to storm-hit Spain,"Despite the concerns about a crammed fixture calendar in a season badly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, Spain is going ahead with its four-team Super Cup this week as Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao provide the opposition for Barcelona and Real Madrid.","However, after being taken to Saudi Arabia in January 2020, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) is organising this year's version in Andalusia, with the final on Sunday at La Cartuja in Seville. From the shores of the Red Sea back to Spain, which has been battered in recent days by Storm Filomena delivering the country's worst snowfall in decades as well as brutally cold temperatures. Barcelona play Real Sociedad in the first semi-final on Wednesday in Cordoba, before trophy holders Madrid face Athletic Bilbao in Malaga on Thursday, with the winners remaining in southern Spain to contest Sunday's final. All of the games will be behind closed doors. In ordinary times the RFEF would not have given up on its controversial money-spinning Saudi venture, after initially agreeing a 120 million-euro ($146m) three-year deal to play an expanded four-team competition in the Middle Eastern Kingdom. That agreement also included the option of three more years, but the lack of fans allowed in Saudi stadiums led the Federation to renegotiate its contract and bring the tournament back home. The move abroad followed in the footsteps of Italy and France, who have taken their own equivalents of the Super Cup -- between the previous season's league champions and domestic cup winners -- to foreign shores in recent years. This time the competition sees reigning La Liga champions Madrid and runners-up Barcelona joined by the two finalists from last season's Copa del Rey, an all-Basque final which was postponed due to the health crisis and has still not been played. That means current La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid are not involved, while Real will not go into their semi-final in the best shape after a build-up impacted by the winter storm. Zinedine Zidane's team were left stuck in the northern city of Pamplona for three nights due to the weather, leaving on Monday after drawing 0-0 with Osasuna on Saturday in a game which Zidane and his players felt should not have gone ahead. ""We are not puppets who should have to play all the time. We made the effort but we need to think about the travel involved too,"" complained goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Instead of returning to the capital, they flew straight to Malaga to prepare for the Super Cup. Athletic, meanwhile, had their game away to Atletico in Madrid postponed because of the snow -- their plane circled the sky awaiting permission to land before being forced to return home. Their hope is to be able to play their Basque neighbours in the final on Sunday before they eventually clash again in the delayed Copa del Rey showpiece. ""We are not used to winning trophies and it would be special and unforgettable,"" admitted their Spanish international centre-back Inigo Martinez. Before that game Barcelona will hope to continue their perfect start to 2021 against a Real Sociedad side who were top of La Liga but have won just one of their last nine league games. ""We are close to a first title of the season and we come into this full of excitement because we are on a good run,"" said Barca midfielder Sergio Busquets. Spanish Super Cup fixtures (2000 GMT)"
6,31/12/2020,19:43,Sociedad edge low-quality Basque derby,Cristian Portu scored the only goal as Real Sociedad edged Athletic Bilbao 1-0 in a disappointing Basque derby on Thursday.,"Portu found the net after just five minutes at San Mames, finishing off a counter-attack by Mikel Oyarzabal. Sociedad remain in third place in La Liga with 29 points, four behind Real Madrid who have a game in hand. Atletico Madrid still lead the way at the end of 2020 on 35 points, two ahead of their city rivals. Victory for Sociedad was also a boost with the two sides possibly facing each other in the Spanish Super Cup final in January. They will also meet in the delayed 2019/2020 Copa del Rey final in April. ""We were very clear about how we had to play and how we could harm them, they did not have any clear chances and we were able to kill the game,"" said Portu. ""By results I would say that it has been a very good year, but we have a bittersweet taste for all the fans who have not been able to enjoy our victories in 2020."""
7,22/12/2020,22:29,Atletico beat Sociedad to cement La Liga lead,Atletico Madrid will stay top of La Liga until at least the weekend after beating Real Sociedad 2-0 on Tuesday to move three points ahead of the chasing pack.,"Second-half goals from Mario Hermoso and Marcos Llorente earned Diego Simeone's side a huge win away at a Sociedad team that started the fixture three points off the lead but are now six back in third after their third straight league defeat. Champions Real Madrid, who sit second, can move level again with their city rivals with a home win over Granada on Wednesday. Barcelona meanwhile are 11 points behind Atletico in sixth place ahead of their clash with Real Valladolid later on Tuesday. After tomorrow's games, Real and Barcelona will have played two more matches than Atletico. Sociedad have played three games more than the leaders. The win was Simeone's 300th league win as Atletico coach. ""It's means a lot, really a lot,"" the Argentine said. ""I came here with the idea of taking Atletico to the summit of the game ... I can't thank the club enough for what they have given me."" Sociedad were the better side in the first half but couldn't carve a goalscoring opportunity in an opening period without a shot on target. Atletico went ahead just three minutes after the break when Hermoso found himself unmarked in the area and perfectly met Yannick Carrasco's free-kick to send a header flying into the bottom corner. The hosts responded by pressing their opponents back but couldn't find a way through a typically well-organised Simeone team. Atletico doubled their lead with 16 minutes remaining, Llorente lashing home when the ball fell to him on the edge of the area. Earlier Sevilla moved up to fifth after Suso fired them to a 1-0 win at struggling Valencia. Suso gave the Andalusians the points with a thumping strike in the 81st minute after charging through to collect a Joan Jordan through ball. The winning strike was the 27-year-old Spain international's first goal of the season. Sevilla are nine points behind Atletico but two points in front of Barca. Valencia are 13th and just a point above the relegation zone after their sixth consecutive league match without a win."
8,17/12/2020,15:24,Holders Madrid to play Athletic in Super Cup last four,"La Liga champions Real Madrid will face Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona will play Real Sociedad in the Spanish Super Cup semi-finals next month, Spain's football federation said on Thursday.","Holders Madrid and Athletic will meet on January 14 in Malaga a day after Barca's fixture with Sociedad in Cordoba, with the final in Sevilla on January 17. Last season's Spanish Cup final between Basque sides Athletic and Sociedad has been postponed to next April due to the coronavirus pandemic. Last term's Super Cup final was held in Saudi Arabia in the first holding of its new four-team format."
9,13/12/2020,23:50,"Messi saves lacklustre Barca, Sociedad reclaim top spot","Lionel Messi saved Barcelona from another embarrassing result by scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 win over lowly Levante, while Real Sociedad returned top of La Liga on Sunday.","Messi struck with 14 minutes remaining of a lacklustre display from Barca at the Camp Nou which will do little to ease fan fears following their 3-0 hammering at the hands of Juventus midweek. Ronald Koeman's side are still way off the pace in the title race, nine points behind Sociedad who reclaimed first place despite only drawing 1-1 with Eibar. Barcelona do however have two games in hand on the Basque outfit. Atletico are level on 26 points with Sociedad and also have two games in hand while Real Madrid are now just three points behind the leaders having played one less after beating their local rivals 2-0 on Saturday. Villarreal are four points off the lead in fourth after drawing 1-1 at Real Betis, who are one point behind Barca in ninth. ""The team is working well, they gave the maximum,"" said Koeman. ""We still lack a little confidence in ourselves, in our game, but we had a lot of chances, and I have nothing to say about the attitude of the players in this match."" Barca managed to force several saves from Aitor Fernandez, with the Levante goalkeeper doing particularly well to push away a stinging shot from Martin Braithwaite in the 16th minute and Antoine Griezmann's header five minutes later. However the best chance of the opening period fell to Jorge de Frutos in the 12th minute, the Spaniard somehow shooting straight at Marc-Andre ter Stegen after the ball broke kindly for him right in front of goal. Barca continued to dominate possession in the second half but if anything looked less threatening, with Fernandez being called into action largely for shots that were hit straight at him. However with Levante looking more comfortable than a side of their level should at the Camp Nou, Messi saved his team with a clinical finish off the post after collecting Frenkie de Jong's pass. It was hardly the sort of display to honour Sergio Busquets' 593rd appearance for the club, which takes him level at fourth of all time for matches played for Barca alongside Carles Puyol. However the three points are a boost ahead of the visit of Sociedad on Wednesday, which is then followed up by another home clash with Valencia on Saturday. Earlier Ander Barrenetxea gave Real Sociedad the lead in San Sebastian with a thumping strike in the 20th minute, but Sergi Enrich turned home with 25 minutes remaining to send his team 10th on 15 points. Sociedad would have had a bigger gap between them and Atletico had Igor Zubeldia's 80th-minute tap-in not been ruled out by VAR for an extremely tight offside. Sunday's draw was Sociedad's sixth in as many games in all competitions, and came after another 1-1 draw at Napoli on Thursday which saw them squeeze into the last 32 of the Europa League. Granada won 1-0 at Elche in Sunday's other match, a win that keeps them one point ahead of Barcelona."
10,10/12/2020,22:40,"Sociedad, Napoli squeeze through to Europa League last 32",Real Sociedad snatched qualification for the last 32 of the Europa League in the final seconds on Thursday after Willian Jose's late leveller in a 1-1 draw at Napoli and AZ Alkmaar's shock 2-1 defeat at Rijeka allowed the Spanish side to progress.,"Young Boys, Molde, Wolfsberg and Maccabi Tel-Aviv rounded off the group stage by making Monday's draw in Nyon, where they join the 18 already-qualified teams and will be met by eight drop-outs from the Champions League. La Liga high-fliers Sociedad were heading out of Europe as the final two matches of Group F headed into stoppage time, with Alkmaar set to go through in second place as the Dutch side were drawing at bottom side Rijeka and Napoli led in Naples thanks to Piotr Zielinski's fine first half strike. However Jose's thumping finish to level the scores at a soaking Stadio Diego Armando Maradona put the Basque outfit back into second place, and Ivan Tomecak's 93rd-minute winner for Rijeka in Croatia confirmed Alkmaar's elimination. Napoli finish top of the group on 11 points, two ahead of Sociedad in second who end the group stage a further point ahead of Alkmaar. ""I am happy, but the result was more important than who scored tonight. We achieved qualification and that is why we are all happy,"" said Zielinski. Gennaro Gattuso's side knew that despite racking up 10 points in their previous five matches a defeat could cost them qualification and he started a strong team that was still missing injured forward Victor Osimhen. Sociedad meanwhile needed to match Alkmaar with the pair level on eight points and in the absence of attacker Mikel Oyarzabal missed a host of chances early on. Zielinski punished Sociedad for these misses when he opened the scoring against the run of play in the 35th minute when he classily brought down a clearance from a corner and lashed home a powerful finish. However Jose sparked wild celebrations when he span and hit his shot into the roof of Ospina's net with seconds remaining, sending his team into Monday's last-32 draw. Young Boys also qualified in dramatic fashion in the last round of group matches, on a night when iconic Italian striker Paolo Rossi was remembered across Europe after his death late on Wednesday night. A 93rd-minute penalty from Jean-Pierre Nsame and Gianluca Gaudino's strike three minutes later sent the Swiss side through alongside Group A winners Roma with a 2-1 win over Cluj that also featured three red cards. Cluj are out of Europe thanks to the two stoppage-time strikes, which came after Gabriel Debeljuh had put the Romanians provisionally second in the group with just six minutes remaining in Bern. Wolfsberg are through to the knockouts thanks to a 1-0 win over Feyenoord which also knocks out the Dutch giants. Former European champions Feyenoord needed a win in Austria to leapfrog their opponents into second place but were disappointing all night and never bounced back from Dejan Joveljic's 31st minute opener. Maccabi went through behind Group I winners Villarreal thanks to a 1-0 win over Turkey's Sivasspor, who are eliminated. Molde's 2-2 draw with Rapid Vienna was enough to see them through from Group B in second place behind Arsenal. The Gunners finished the group stage with a perfect six wins from six after easing past bottom side Dundalk 4-2, while Rangers finished top of Group D thanks to their 2-0 win at Lech Poznan. Premier League sides Leicester City and Tottenham Hotspur also topped their groups thanks to respective wins over Royal Antwerp and AEK Athens. AC Milan continued to show that they don't rely on injured Zlatan Ibrahimovic after a 1-0 win at Sparta Prague that allowed them to snatch first place in Group H. Jen Petter Hauge's fine individual goal midway through the first half took the Serie A leaders to 13 points, two ahead of Lille who lost 3-2 at bottom team Celtic."
11,09/12/2020,03:15,Sociedad's Imanol has 'no doubts' about Europa League last-32 hopes,Real Sociedad coach Imanol Alguacil believes his side can reach the knockout stages of the Europa League for just the second time in 20 years despite a dip in form which has dropped them from the top of La Liga.,"The Basques head to Napoli on Thursday and will book a place in the last 32 if they match Alkmaar's result at winless Rijeka. Imanol's men ceded first place in the Spanish top-flight with Sunday's 0-0 stalemate at Alaves, their fourth straight draw since beating Cadiz on November 22. ""We are a bit hurt, for not having won. In the team no one has doubts, neither do I, that we are capable of winning,"" said Imanol, the former second-team boss in his third season in charge. His side are the top scorers in La Liga but captain Mikel Oyarzabal, who has contributed seven of those 22 goals, is unlikely to feature for the trip to Italy after sustaining a muscle injury in the draw against Rijeka last week. ""I have my doubts, perhaps it would be risking too much, let's see,"" Imanol said. On a positive note for Imanol, ex-Manchester City midfielder David Silva could return after pulling out of the weekend's trip to Alaves just before kick-off with a fitness issue. ""He said he was ready to play, but in the warm-up he did not feel comfortable, something that we had planned, and we decided not to take risks and wait for Thursday,"" he said. Napoli will advance from Group F if they avoid defeat. Gennaro Gattuso's team have lost just twice in eight games since the start of November. On Sunday, Diego Maradona's former side hammered Crotone 4-0 as Piotr Zielinski added a third assist of the campaign. Despite the midfielder's efforts, Gattuso said the Pole needs to improve in front of goal, after scoring just once in 10 matches this term. ""He has great quality and dances with the ball. To become a great player he needs to add seven or eight goals a season. He has the ability to do so,"" said Gattuso. Going into the last round of matches, 18 of the 24 places in the next round are already locked up but in addition to the three-way battle in Group F, eight other teams enter the final night of the round battling for qualificaltion. Among them are two-time winners Feyenoord, Swiss league leaders Young Boys and Turkish club Sivasspor who could make their first appearances in the knockout stages in Europe. Qarabag's trip to Villarreal has been postponed as the visitors are unable to field a side due to numerous cases of Covid-19 within their squad."
12,24/11/2020,13:05,Real Sociedad's David Silva sidelined by hamstring strain,"Real Sociedad midfielder David Silva faces a spell on the sidelines after injuring his left hamstring, the Spanish league leaders said on Tuesday.","Silva, 34, has started eight of 10 league matches for La Real following his summer arrival from Manchester City on a free transfer. The Spain international picked up the injury during Sunday's 1-0 win at Cadiz, a result that moved his side three points clear at the top of La Liga. The club did not give a timeline for his return although reports in Spain suggested Silva could be ruled out for around two weeks. He will miss Thursday's Europa League tie away to AZ Alkmaar and the visit of Villarreal in La Liga on Sunday."
13,08/11/2020,19:11,Real Sociedad go top after beating Covid-hit Granada,"Real Sociedad regained top spot in La Liga on Sunday after winning 2-0 against a depleted Granada, who could face punishment for fielding fewer than the required number of first-team players.","Nacho Monreal scored in the 22nd minute and Mikel Oyarzabal converted a penalty in the 27th at Anoeta to send la Real back above Atletico Madrid, who had briefly taken first place after thrashing Cadiz on Saturday. Atletico are three points behind but have two games in hand. Defeat means Granada drop to fifth, with the club currently hit by an outbreak of coronavirus. Granada had only seven first-team players available and finished with only four on the pitch, which is contrary to La Liga's minimum of five. The rest of the squad was made up of players from the youth team. It remains to be seen if La Liga take action, having already rejected Granada's request on Saturday for the game to be postponed. Unai Emery's Villarreal move up to second in the table after they won 3-1 against Getafe."
14,01/11/2020,23:43,Silva off the mark as Real Sociedad go back to top of La Liga,David Silva scored his first goal for Real Sociedad on Sunday to help them go back to the top of La Liga after a 4-1 win over Celta Vigo.,"Silva headed La Real in front at Balaidos for his first goal since he left Manchester City in the summer, and his first in La Liga since he departed Valencia 11 years ago. Mikel Oyarzabal made it two with his fifth of the season, a tally that also makes him the league's top scorer so far. Willian Jose then hit the net twice in the second half, either side of Iago Aspas converting a penalty, which gave Celta brief hope of a comeback. Celta's Jose Fontan was sent off for a second yellow card late on, to cap a disappointing afternoon for the home side, who sit 17th, without a win in six games. But another impressive victory for Real Sociedad means they have won their last four league games on the bounce, with scorelines of 3-0, 3-0, 4-1 and 4-1. They return to the top of the table, one point ahead Real Madrid, who had temporarily taken first place after their 4-1 win over Huesca on Saturday. Atletico Madrid are third, three points off the leaders but with two games in hand. Valencia, meanwhile, avoided a fourth straight defeat by drawing 2-2 at home to Getafe but could easily have lost or won the game after a wild finish at Mestalla. Leading 1-0 through a goal from Yunus Musah, Valencia were reduced to 10 men when Thierry Correia was sent off just before the hour. They conceded in the 87th minute when Juan Camilo Hernadez equalised for Getafe, who then looked to have snatched a victory when Angel scored again in the 94th minute. But Valencia hit back in the 10th minute of injury-time, Carlos Soler converting a penaly to ensure they at least went away with a point. Getafe's Damian Suarez was also shown a red card in the 98th minute to add to the mayhem. Getafe slip to eighth while Valencia stay 13th. Real Betis had earlier beaten Elche 3-1 to climb to seventh. Elche drop to 10th."
15,18/10/2020,23:25,Real Sociedad go top to extend surprise start in La Liga,"Real Sociedad continued La Liga's unpredictable start to the season by going top of the table on Sunday, after a 3-0 win away at Real Betis.","Villarreal had temporarily claimed first place earlier in the day by beating Valencia 2-1 at la Ceramica but Real Sociedad's impressive victory put them ahead on goal difference. They are the sixth different team to lead La Liga after six rounds of fixtures so far, as Real Madrid gave up their place at the top of the pile after a surprise loss at home to Cadiz on Saturday. Barcelona were also beaten away at Getafe. Real Sociedad took advantage as Portu and Adnan Januzaj scored goals either side of Mikel Oyarzabal converting a penalty to consign Betis to a third defeat in four games under their new coach Manuel Pellegrini. They drop to sixth. Earlier, Dani Parejo came back to haunt Valencia by scoring the winner for Villarreal, against his former club. After making 363 appearances for Valencia, many of them as captain, Parejo was one of a handful of key players allowed to leave in the summer. His deflected shot in the 69th minute was a reminder of what they were missing as Villarreal held on to go one point above Real Madrid. Despite a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Barcelona last month, it has been an encouraging start for Unai Emery, who was appointed Villarreal coach in July. They have 11 points from their first six games. Valencia sit 12th, having won just once in their last five matches, with the future of coach Javi Gracia still uncertain. Gracia was critical of the club after Valencia sold the likes of Parejo and Francis Coquelin to Villarreal, as well as Rodrigo and Ferran Torres to Leeds and Manchester City, but failed to make a single addition in the summer transfer window. Emery was also once at Valencia and so was Villarreal's Paco Alcacer, who opened the scoring with a penalty before Goncalo Guedes levelled shortly before half-time. Yet Parejo had the last word, receiving a pass from Takefusa Kubo and curling in after his shot deflected off Mouctar Diakhaby. Kubo was then sent off in the 90th minute after coming on in the 64th."
16,29/09/2020,21:45,Valencia edge Real Sociedad to go top in Spain,Valencia opened the fourth round of Liga matches on Tuesday with a 1-0 away win at Real Sociedad to move to the top of the Spanish table.,"Real Sociedad would also have gone top with a victory and while they dominating play were however frustrated by an impressive display from the visiting goalkeeper Jaume Domenech. The hosts lost their fluency after changing four attacking players in a mass switch in the 67th minute. Maxi Gomez finished off a rare Valencia counter-attack to score the winning goal from close range after 75 minutes. Valencia had been under pressure after a draw at home to Huesca on Saturday came on the back of a surprise loss away at Celta Vigo. New coach Javi Gracia has already expressed disappointment with the club's summer transfer dealings. But his side now top the standings with seven points after four games albeit with five teams in action this week who are within three points, including Real Madrid who welcome Valladolid on Thursday. The midweek round ends with Celta, who could also end up in first place, hosting Barcelona, who have only played one match, on Thursday."
17,20/09/2020,23:40,Real Madrid toil in goalless opening draw at Real Sociedad,Real Madrid began the defence of their Spanish title with a tepid 0-0 draw at Real Sociedad on Sunday as Martin Odegaard made his first league start for the reigning champions against his former club.,"Madrid are heading into the La Liga season after making no new signings this summer, with president Florentino Perez admitting the club has to be cautious amid the coronavirus pandemic. Odegaard is the closest thing to a new arrival, the attacking midfielder returning early from his two year loan with Real Sociedad, after he shone for them last season. But there have been a string of sales, including Gareth Bale, whose move back to Tottenham was confirmed on Saturday, and James Rodriguez, who has already impressed after joining Everton. Norwegian Odegaard, whose only other league appearance for Madrid came in May 2015, lasted 69 minutes before he was replaced by Casemiro. ""We didn't get the win. I'm not happy about that, but I'm pleased to play with Real Madrid,"" Odegaard told Movistar. ""It's always a bit difficult at the start but it's easier for me with all these incredible players I have around me."" Zinedine Zidane has brushed off suggestions his Real Madrid side could lack freshness this season, with a very familiar XI starting this first game. One notable omission was Eden Hazard, whose fitness remains unresolved, even after the summer break. Zidane admitted on Saturday he was unsure whether Hazard has recovered from the ankle injury that required him to have surgery earlier this year. Sergio Ramos, three goals shy of a century for Madrid, watched an acrobatic effort blocked in a quiet first half before Karim Benzema dragged wide of the post after rounding the goalkeeper. Alexander Isak spurned the best chance when Thibaut Courtois spread his body well to block from the young Swedish striker. Teenager Ander Barrenetxea side-footed just past the post early in the second half for the hosts while Alex Remiro made comfortable stops from Dani Carvajal and Benzema. David Silva made his La Liga return after a decade with Manchester City as he took the place of Isak for the final 25 minutes. ""It's two points lost but we struggled to make chances, particularly in the second half. We had two or three in the first half,"" said Zidane. ""We played a good game, especially defensively. We didn't concede anything but we lacked a bit in attack, and above all, a goal."" Barcelona do not start their league campaign under new coach Ronald Koeman until next weekend against Villarreal. Granada lead the table with maximum points after two rounds following Sunday's 2-1 victory over Alaves. Real Betis trail on goal difference after beating Real Valladolid 2-0 with a penalty from Nabil Fekir and a William Carvalho goal."
18,13/07/2020,21:55,Villarreal miss out on Champions League after Real Sociedad loss,Villarreal's hopes of Champions League qualification are over after a 2-1 defeat to Real Sociedad on Monday confirmed Atletico Madrid and Sevilla will finish in La Liga's top four.,"An excellent run of form since the restart had thrust fifth-placed Villarreal into Champions League contention but they were unable to close the gap and will now have to focus on securing a spot in the Europa League. Real Sociedad had been fourth when La Liga resumed last month but, in contrast, their form collapsed. This victory was only their second in nine games but at least gives them of making the top seven. Atletico and Sevilla are both nine points clear of Sevilla with two games left. They will join Barcelona and Real Madrid as Spain's four representatives in the Champions League next term. Willian Jose and Diego Llorente both headed in to put Real Sociedad in control but Santi Cazorla's consolation strike could prove important for Villarreal, as it prevents la Real owning the superior head-to-head record. Villarreal beat Real Sociedad by the same scoreline in January. Fifth place for Villarreal would mean avoiding the qualification phase of the Europa League. They sit three points clear of Getafe and Real Sociedad in sixth and seventh respectively. Getafe were unable to take advantage as they were held to a goalless draw by relegation strugglers Alaves. The stalemate earns what could prove a vital point for 17th-placed Alaves, who have a four-point cushion over Leganes and Real Mallorca with two games left. One more win will guarantee Alaves' survival."
19,30/06/2020,00:13,Jaime Mata double revives Getafe Champions League bid,Jaime Mata scored twice as Getafe beat fellow European hopefuls Real Sociedad 2-1 on Monday to give their push for Champions League qualification from La Liga a boost.,"Getafe had seen their top-four bid hit by a four-game winless run since the league restarted following the coronavirus pandemic, but they moved back to within two points of fourth-placed Sevilla. Sociedad, who were in the Champions League places before the COVID-19 lockdown, have picked up just one point from a possible 15 since and are now seven points adrift in seventh. Sevilla's 1-1 draw with Real Valladolid on Friday had given Getafe a chance of narrowing the gap, and they took a 20th-minute lead through Mata's penalty. Former Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj levelled for visitors Sociedad 10 minutes after the break with his third league goal of the season. But Mata had the final word with seven minutes remaining as he latched onto Jorge Molina's quick throw-in and poked a low finish into the net from the tightest of angles to send Getafe back into fifth. Sixth-placed Villarreal remain in the Champions League hunt though, just one point further back."
20,24/06/2020,21:57,Real Sociedad's top-four hopes take another blow after Celta loss,Real Sociedad's surprise challenge for Champions League qualification appears to be over after they suffered a third consecutive defeat at home to Celta Vigo on Wednesday.,"La Real have taken just a point from their four games since La Liga restarted on June 11 and now sit seventh, six points adrift of Sevilla in fourth. Iago Aspas' penalty on the stroke of half-time was enough to seal a 1-0 victory for Celta Vigo, who move seven points clear of the relegation zone, albeit having played a game more than Real Mallorca in 18th. Unlike their opponents, Celta have found a different gear since coming back from the three-month suspension. They have now taken seven points from their last nine, scoring seven goals in that time and conceding none. Real Sociedad's Diego Llorente conceded a penalty in the loss to Real Madrid on Sunday and he was at fault again, tugging down Aspas, who made the most of the defender's mistake. Aspas slid home the penalty for his 11th goal of the season as Celta took a big step towards survival at Anoeta. Osasuna are all but safe after they won 1-0 away at Alaves to put 12 points between them and the bottom three. Toni Lato found the corner with an excellent finish shortly after the hour to give Osasuna their first win in four matches. Alaves drop to 13th."
21,20/06/2020,15:50,"Real Madrid unaffected by Barca blip, says Zidane",Zinedine Zidane insists nothing has changed in La Liga's title race despite Barcelona handing Real Madrid the chance to go top of the table if they beat Real Sociedad on Sunday.,"Barca's goalless draw away at Sevilla on Friday means Madrid will move above them with a win at Anoeta this weekend due to a superior record head to head. After his team's slip-up, Gerard Pique admitted it would be ""very difficult to win this league"" and said Real Madrid might not drop any more points during the run-in. ""Nothing changes,"" said Zidane in a press conference on Saturday. ""People can say one thing or another but what interests me is the game tomorrow. I have my opinions but I am not going to say them because the same could happen or the complete opposite. ""Everyone can give their opinion but we are thinking of the next match. It's what engages us and nothing else."" Madrid have beaten Eibar and Valencia since the return from the three-month suspension and Karim Benzema has continued his excellent season by taking his tally to 21 goals in 38 games. Benzema scored twice against Valencia, with the second goal a stunning control and volley into the top corner. ""I don't think much has changed with Karim, maybe just his age and experience,"" Zidane said. ""He has been here for many years now and to me he is the same player but he knows it's always possible to improve and that's what he is doing. ""He takes care of himself and has a lot of ambition. People are always interested in how much he is scoring and if he doesn't score, everything is bad. But that's not how I look at it. ""He gives us so many things and if he scores goals, all the better, but I am not interested in a number nine that only scores and otherwise doesn't affect the game. Karim does both."" Marco Asensio also enjoyed a special night against Valencia as he scored with his first touch after coming on to make his first appearance in a year. Asensio had been out with a anterior cruciate ligament injury. ""I am happy with what happened but he has to go step by step,"" said Zidane. ""We have time, we don't now think that's it, he must play every game, no, we have to stay calm. After a serious injury you have to go slowly and that is what we and him are doing."""
22,10/06/2020,03:20,'We all want the Champions League' - Oyarzabal urges Real Sociedad to give surprise season a final flourish,"""I am happy where I am, I feel loved,"" says Mikel Oyarzabal, Real Sociedad's captain and creator, often linked with Manchester City but whose best chance of playing in the Champions League next season might be to stay where he is.","Real Sociedad are fourth in La Liga, one point ahead of Atletico Madrid, after Oyarzabal's penalty helped them beat Eibar on March 10, the league's last match that was played behind closed doors before fixtures were suspended completely. A week earlier, another Oyarzabal penalty sent la Real through to their first Copa del Rey final in 32 years, this one against Basque rivals Athletic Bilbao for the first time ever. In February, they had each knocked out Real Madrid and Barcelona on the same night. Oyarzabal, together with Martin Odegaard who is flourishing on loan from Real Madrid, has been at the heart of it. The Spanish number 10 who marauds off the left has been fouled twice as much as Lionel Messi and sits below only five players with 14 goals and assists combined. It has already been a brilliant season and it is tempting to wonder if it will be judged a success too, regardless of how Real Sociedad place at the end of La Liga's sprint finish that begins on Thursday. ""Listen, not for me,"" Oyarzabal says, in an exclusive interview with AFP. ""We are a few points ahead so what we all want is to sit in the Champions League, to live that competition next year. ""Everyone is completely plugged in now and it feels like a good time to fight for where we are."" It is not only about where they are but how they got there, with many seeing Real Sociedad as the best team to watch in Spain this season. ""People can say nice things but it's more about what we feel,"" says Oyarzabal. ""We feel comfortable, we feel happy and I think that shows in how we play. ""I'm proud of this team, of what we're doing. But we're 11 games away from achieving something beautiful, something exciting."" Capable of precision and pace in equal measure, la Real are full of surprises. Oyarzabal is too, a dancing dribbler with size 47 feet and a club captain already at the age of 23. He watches the news every morning at the training ground over breakfast and has a business degree in administration and management. ""I think learning about leadership is important,"" he says. ""Even as a footballer you are always with people, in fact it can be the most important part of the job."" His leadership as captain perhaps assumes even greater importance as La Liga gets set to resume under strict health guidelines this week for the first time in three months following the coronavirus crisis. His home club Eibar have expressed doubts about restarting but Oyarzabal is convinced. ""I feel safer than ever,"" he says. ""We are adhering to all the protocols and I think everyone is being led by their conscience. We know this is serious. ""I don't feel fear because anyone can get it, it's not only in our hands, you can't say 100 per cent that nobody will touch you. We can only do everything we can to avoid it."" Oyarzabal admits their match without fans against Eibar felt ""decaffeinated"" but accepts empty stands is the price for the season completing. Yet the cup final against Bilbao, he says, must wait. ""It's a historic game, a final between two Basques where the atmosphere is everything and not just the atmosphere but the memories people create together before the game, during the game. This is everything,"" Oyarzabal says. ""It has to wait for the fans."" If it waits beyond this season, though, they might be without Odegaard, their other sparkling attacking midfielder, whose first year of a two-year loan has gone so well Madrid might take him back. ""He's an example for everyone and this year has been good for him to gain confidence and prove he really is ready for anything,"" Oyarzabal says. ""We hope to have him as long as possible but we have to enjoy him while he's here and make sure he enjoys himself. ""It is a personal decision for him but he's happy here, he's found his feet. That should also be important when the time comes to make up his mind."" Oyarzabal could have a decision to make too if one of Europe's elite comes calling, with Pep Guardiola a known admirer in England. ""I'm happy where I am, I feel loved, I feel valued and at no time have I said that I will jump,"" says Oyarzabal. ""People talk too much, I want to focus on trying to do the best I can, like I have done so far, and to continue as a footballer here at la Real. I am where I want to be."""
23,04/05/2020,16:35,Spanish cup rivals want fans at the final,The Spanish Cup finalists Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao said on Monday that they had asked the Spanish football federation (RFEF) to ensure the final was played with fans in the ground.,"The clubs said in a joint press release that they had met with Luis Rubiales, the president of the RFEF, who had agreed to ask the general assembly on May 8, if the final could be played with open doors. This would be the first all-Basque final in the history of the competition. ""The desire and will of both clubs has always been, now and before, to play and enjoy the final match along with the supporters,"" they said in a joint English-language press release. ""This is what we would like most. A final to be lived with our supporters in the stands."" The match was originally scheduled for April 18 in Seville at the Olympic Stadium, known as La Cartuja. Announcing the postponement in March, Rubiales said: ""The aim is for La Cartuja to be full of people."" No new date has been fixed. The Spanish league remains suspended and clubs have not been able to return to training. Even so, the two Basque clubs said they wanted guarantees that ""the final will be played as an official competition and will, therefore, be considered an official title."" The governing body of European football (UEFA) has said that places in next season's continental club competitions will be awarded ""on sporting merit"", if domestic competitions cannot be completed. Real Sociedad, fourth in La Liga when play was suspended, would qualify for the Champions League. But, without a cup final, the last Spanish Europa League place would probably go to the team seventh in the table. Athletic, 10th in the standings, have said they are in ""deep disagreement"" with this solution. Bilbao won the inaugural Spanish cup in 1903 and have lifted the trophy 23 times, second only to Barcelona, but their last triumph was in 1984. Real Sociedad have won the Copa del Rey twice. Bilbao eliminated Barcelona in the quarterfinals while Real Sociedad put out Real Madrid. The clubs said that by sharing the final ""together with their fans, supporters, subscribers, members and partners"" they would be celebrating ""the true essence, and raison d'etre of this wonderful sport."""
24,11/04/2020,22:35,Real Sociedad cut player salaries by 20 percent,Real Sociedad said Saturday they were cutting players' wages by up to 20 percent in an attempt to stabilise the club's budget during the coronavirus crisis.,"""An agreement has been reached with the first team for the reduction of their wages by 20% in case the league does not resume this season, and by 5% in case the season can start again,"" said a club statement. ""This decision, taken with all of the parties concerned, helps us avoid traumatic measures for the rest of our employees and helps to balance the club's economic objectives in the face of a drop in income suffered after the suspension of competition."" Real Sociedad also announced a 20% refund on season tickets for its supporters. At the time of the La Liga suspension last month, Real Sociedad were in fourth place in the championship. They had also qualified for the Copa del Rey final against Athletic Bilbao in Seville on a date still to be decided. Real Madrid had already announced wage cuts, estimated by Spanish media to be 10% if the season resumes and 20% if the league is abandoned. Barcelona and Atletico Madrid have cut salaries by 70%. Spain is one of the worst-hit nations by the virus which has already claimed more than 16,300 lives in the country."
25,11/03/2020,19:34,Copa del Rey final postponed to avoid empty stadium,"The Copa del Rey final between Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad on April 18 has been postponed, the Spanish football federation (RFEF) said after a meeting with the clubs on Wednesday.","The game was due to be played at La Cartuja in Seville. ""The Copa del Rey final has been postponed by mutual agreement with the finalist clubs to ensure that it will be played with spectators in the stands,"" RFEF president Luis Rubiales said in a statement. ""The aim is for La Cartuja to be full of people."" Bilbao president Aitor Elizegi and his Real Sociedad counterpart Jokin Aperribay had made clear they were opposed to playing the final in an empty stadium. Bilbao won the last of their 23 Spanish Cups in 1984. Their Basque rivals have not lifted the trophy since 1987. According to the Spanish press, one of the possible alternatives would be to play the final in Seville on May 30, a week after the end of the La Liga season and the same date as the Champions League final, but La Cartuja has been booked for a concert by Spanish heavy rock band Extremoduro. The semi-finals of the women's competition, the Copa de la Reina, between Athletic Bilbao and CDEF Logrono and Barcelona and Sevilla, have also been postponed ""until further notice"". On Tuesday, the RFEF ordered all matches in the top two divisions played behind closed doors. On Wednesday it also shut down all men's and women's outdoor and indoor competitions below the top two divisions."
26,07/03/2020,22:25,"Barcelona confidence unaffected by fan frustration, says Setien","Quique Setien insisted Barcelona have not lost their confidence, despite needing a dubious late penalty, converted by Lionel Messi, to scrape past Real Sociedad 1-0 on Saturday inside a frustrated Camp Nou.","Messi's 24th goal of the season, and fifth in four games, was enough to save Barca, despite a drab display that threatened to bring more disappointment following last weekend's loss against Real Madrid. As tension grew inside Camp Nou, some of the home fans whistled to express their dissatisfaction, which Jordi Alba then seemed to confront when celebrating a late goal, ruled out for offside, by putting his fingers in his ears. ""We have not lost confidence in what we are doing,"" said Setien. ""The fans sometimes don't expect the opposition to restrict you but you have to take into account that Real Sociedad are a great team."" On his own reaction, Alba said: ""I respect the fans but the fans have to respect me. Nobody likes to be whistled, and even less after 15 minutes at 0-0."" Madrid drop to second in the table but can restore their one-point advantage at the top by winning away at struggling Real Betis on Sunday night. Their Clasico victory at the Santiago Bernabeu put the pressure back on Barcelona, whose response was hardly resounding, with Setien's side ultimately reliant on VAR to spot a handball in the 81st minute from Robin Le Normand. The lack of appeal and the chunk of play that passed before VAR intervened made the decision all the more surprising and la Real's players were still shaking their heads at the final whistle. Yet the win was all-important for the Catalans at the end of another week dominated by headlines surrounding problems off the pitch. Setien said he had apologised to the squad after his assistant Eder Sarabia was recorded launching into a number of foul-mouthed rants against his own players during the game against Madrid, even if there were chants in support of Sarabia before kick-off. ""When the club is in a moment of weakness, these kinds of things come out,"" said Gerard Pique. ""It's normal for an assistant coach, with the adrenaline high, to express himself. We see it as normal."" Barcelona created a handful of openings during the first half and Martin Braithwaite, making his first start, was at the heart of most of them, with his willingness to run in behind offering a good alternative in attack. Twice Messi sent Braithwaite free early on but his lung-busting runs ended in tame shots. When he did hit one into the net, he was pulled back for offside. Messi created a chance of his own by hunting the ball down in the corner before retrieving a chipped Sergio Busquets pass, only to scuff the finish. The chances came more frequently in the second half as Barca turned the screw. Messi slid one past the post and then sliced another over from Antoine Griezmann's cushioned header. Ivan Rakitic's drive was parried, Pique's header too straight and Alba's ball across the face of goal just too far ahead of the diving Rakitic. As chances went begging, la Real sensed an opportunity. Nacho Monreal flashed wide and Alexander Isak hammered over. But just as the tension was growing, Barcelona were leant a helping hand, with VAR reviewing a handball from Le Normand and referee Juan Martinez Munuera persuaded to point to the spot. Messi made no mistake. Atletico Madrid will hope for a tighter contest against Liverpool in the Champions League on Wednesday than their frantic 2-2 draw earlier on Saturday against Sevilla. Joao Felix looked as sharp at the Wanda Metropolitano as he has done all season and completed a four-minute comeback for Atletico after Alvaro Morata's penalty cancelled out Luuk de Jong's opener for Sevilla. But Lucas Ocampos levelled with another penalty at the end of a pulsating first half, again with the help of VAR after a foul by Kieran Trippier. The draw will be more gratefully received by Sevilla, who sit third in La Liga and two points ahead of Atletico, who stay fifth after missing an opportunity to close the gap. Fourth-placed Getafe had Mauro Arambarri sent off late on as they drew 0-0 at home to relegation battlers Celta Vigo."
27,08/01/2019,15:05,Solari in the dark about VAR after Madrid penalty controversy,Real Madrid coach Santiago Solari on Tuesday called for the video assistant referee rules to be made clearer after admitting he has no idea how the system works following penalty controversy at the weekend.,"Madrid fell to a limp 2-0 defeat 2-0 at home to Real Sociedad in La Liga on Sunday, and were denied a penalty in the second half while they still trailed by a single goal. Solari was incensed after referee Jose Munuera ruled that Madrid forward Vinicius Junior was not fouled by Sociedad goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli while bearing down on goal in the 65th minute and then decided against consulting the VAR team, which did not refer the incident to Munuera. ""The rules have to be clear,"" Solari told reporters. ""If the rules are clear and we know when it can be used, that's going to help everyone's understanding, not just for the players but the fans as well. ""It happens to me as a spectator too. I'm not even sure what the process is with VAR."" FIFA rules state that VAR can be used in relation to goals, penalties, red cards and cases of mistaken identity. The referee can either request a review from his video assistant or the video assistant can recommend a review to the referee. Madrid sit fifth in La Liga, 10 points adrift of leaders Barcelona, with their best chance of further success this season now in the Champions League or Copa del Rey, in which VAR has been introduced for this season. Gareth Bale will miss Wednesday's opening leg of their Copa tie against Leganes at the Santiago Bernabeu with a calf strain, and the Welsh winger is not expected to return in time for Real's league fixture at Real Betis on Sunday. Bale was in the stands to watch the defeat by Sociedad last weekend but raised eyebrows by leaving the stadium around 10 minutes before full-time. Asked about Bale, Solari said: ""These are the sort of matters we deal with internally"". Solari is likely to make several changes against Leganes and Brahim Diaz could make his debut after joining from Manchester City. The 19-year-old was officially unveiled on Monday and Solari said his availability would depend on relevant paperwork being submitted in time."
28,26/12/2018,14:58,Real Socidad fire coach Garitano and promote Alguacil,"Real Sociedad, languishing 15th in La Liga, on Wednesday fired coach Asier Garitano and named Imanol Alguacil as his replacement.","""Real Sociedad have decided to rescind the contract of first-team coach Asier Garitano,"" the club said in a statement on their website. They went on to thank Garitano for ""all his contribution, professionalism and dedication"". Garitano arrived in San Sebastian last summer from Leganes. In 17 league games, he won five and lost eight, including the last four. He leaves with the club four points above the relegation zone. Alguacil, 47, is a local boy who started his playing career at Real Sociedad. He has been on the club's coaching staff since 2011 and has run the B team since 2013. He had a brief stint as head coach after Eusebio Sacristan was sacked last March."
29,09/12/2018,23:30,Bale snaps drought as Real edge past struggling Huesca,Gareth Bale ended a run of 802 minutes without a goal in La Liga as Real Madrid won 1-0 at bottom side Huesca on Sunday to climb back to within five points of leaders Barcelona.,"The Welshman struck his first goal in the league since the start of September to lift Real to a fourth win in five matches and move the European champions up to fourth place. ""He (Bale) and the rest of the team were all fantastic. He scored a great goal and it was enough to get the win,"" said Real coach Santiago Solari. ""His goal and the general character of the team were crucial in taking all three points."" ""It wasn't a game to remember, but if you want to win La Liga, you have to win these matches,"" the Argentine added. Bale put a halt to his longest spell without scoring in the league since joining Real as he expertly cushioned in a volley from an arcing cross by Alvaro Odriozola on eight minutes. Huesca winger Ezequiel Avila forced a brilliant stop from Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, the Belgium international punching the ball to safety midway through the first half. Bale nearly added to his haul on 25 minutes when his fierce drive from the edge of the area was tipped over by a scrambling Aleksandar Jovanovic. Gonzalo Melero should have levelled for Huesca right after the break only to nod wide of the goal despite having the whole target at which to aim. A swerving David Ferreiro shot drew another smart save from Courtois as Real withstood a spirited fightback from the hosts, but Bale continued to threaten and forced two further saves from Jovanovic. Courtois turned over a late Moi Gomez free-kick and Huesca, who slumped to a 10th defeat in 15 games this season, were denied a point when Dani Carvajal headed off the line from Christian Rivera. Elsewhere, Borja Mayoral salvaged a point for Levante with a stoppage-time equaliser in a thrilling 4-4 draw away to Eibar. Eibar, who beat Madrid 3-0 in their last home game, led 4-2 with 15 minutes to play after a quick-fire brace by Charles added to goals from Sergi Enrich and Gonzalo Escalante. But Levante snatched a draw as Tono halved the deficit before Mayoral struck at the death. Real Betis shot up to seventh with a 2-0 home win over second-bottom Rayo Vallecano following goals by on-loan Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Giovani Lo Celso and Brazilian centre-back Sidnei. Real Valladolid won for the first time in six games as Toni Suarez and Antonito found the net in a 2-1 victory at Real Sociedad."
30,15/09/2018,18:41,Barcelona fight back to beat Real Sociedad,Barcelona came from behind to beat Real Sociedad on Saturday as Atletico Madrid lost further ground in the La Liga title race by drawing at home to Eibar.,"Seven points is now the gap between Atleti and Barca, who were in danger of slipping up themselves when Aritz Elustondo put Real Sociedad in front at Anoeta. But the hosts missed a series of excellent chances and paid the price, as two goals in three minutes from Luis Suarez and Ousmane Dembele clinched a hard-fought 2-1 win. ""The league is defined by these kind of games,"" Suarez said afterwards. ""Last year we also came back from 2-0 after many years without winning here. The reaction says a lot about this team."" Atletico rallied too, Borja Garces equalising with virtually the last kick of the game, but there were no celebrations at the Wanda Metropolitano. Garces' strike was enough only to rescue a 1-1 draw for Diego Simeone's side, who had looked on course for defeat when Eibar's Sergi Enrich bundled home in the 87th minute. Barcelona might easily have dropped points too had their opponents been more clinical. Mikel Oyarzabal and Theo Hernandez both could have made it 2-0 after half-time but the former blazed over and the latter was denied by Barca keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Within minutes, they were behind, as two crosses caused havoc in Real Sociedad´s defence, with Suarez and Dembele perfectly placed to pounce. Barca coach Ernesto Valverde had made the surprise decision to omit Sergio Busquets from his starting line-up, presumably with Tuesday´s Champions League opener against PSV Eindhoven in mind. But it was testament to the hosts' performance that Busquets was called upon in the second period after Philippe Coutinho had also been introduced at half-time. ""In the first half they closed us down well but Philippe coming on in the second half helped changed the dynamics,"" Suarez said. Simeone might also have liked to keep one eye on their Champions League game against Monaco on Tuesday, but a victory was much-needed following defeat to Celta Vigo two weeks ago. Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa, however, were both sloppy in the final third and Eibar might even have scored earlier, twice denied by the woodwork. It means Atleti have now recorded their worst league start since 2009. ""I would worry if we had not created those chances to score,"" Simeone said. ""The team also showed a reaction after their goal. We continued to push forward and managed to take a point."""
31,19/08/2018,00:25,"Messi, Coutinho get Barcelona off to winning start",Two goals from Lionel Messi either side of a Philippe Coutinho strike allowed Barcelona to start their defence of the Spanish title with a 3-0 win over Alaves at the Camp Nou on Saturday night.,"Wearing the captain's armband following the departure of Andres Iniesta to Japan, Messi stepped up to send a cheeky second-half free-kick under the jumping wall and into the net for the opener, and Barca's 6,000th La Liga goal. Coutinho, who had come off the bench, lashed in the second goal before Messi added gloss to the scoreline in stoppage time, with the clock having ticked past midnight in Catalonia. While they took their time to get going, it was an ideal opening result for Ernesto Valverde's side, who are hoping to once again see off the challenges of Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the battle for the title. While Cristiano Ronaldo has left Real for Juventus, Messi remains as the figurehead at Barcelona and he won his 33rd trophy with the club in the Spanish Super Cup victory over Sevilla last weekend. The 31-year-old will be aiming to put behind him the desperate disappointment that was Argentina's World Cup campaign, and he was unlucky not to get a hat-trick here. Messi saw a free-kick crash back off the bar late in the first half after going over the wall, so when he was handed another chance from a similar position in the 64th minute, he changed tack. This time, 22 yards out, he surprised the jumping Alaves defenders by going underneath and giving Fernando Pacheco in goal no chance. He then sent another curling effort off the post soon after. Coutinho started the match on the bench alongside summer signings Arthur, Malcom, Clement Lenglet and Arturo Vidal. However, he was sent on at the start of the second half and his goal seven minutes from the end effectively killed the game. The Brazilian had just squandered one chance after being played in by Messi when he picked up a pass from compatriot Arthur before lashing in, ensuring victory on the opening weekend for Barca for the 10th consecutive season. Messi, the top scorer in La Liga last season, then controlled a ball into the box on his chest before slotting in his second and his team's third in stoppage time. After the departures of Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane, Real play their first league game under new coach Julen Lopetegui on Sunday night when they entertain near neighbours Getafe. Last season's runners-up Atletico, fresh from beating Real 4-2 after extra time in the UEFA Super Cup in Tallinn in midweek, start at Valencia on Monday. Elsewhere on Saturday, former Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla played his first competitive game in almost two years following a nightmare time with injuries. The 77-times capped Spanish international, who is now 33, suffered a serious Achilles injury playing for Arsenal in the Champions League in October 2016. After eight operations, the little attacking midfielder suffered a serious infection in the tendon that almost led to an amputation. But he fought back and recently returned to Villarreal, seven years after his departure for Malaga. Cazorla started in Villarreal's season-opener at home to Real Sociedad, as his side took a first-half lead through Gerard Moreno. However, the visitors fought back to win 2-1 with goals from Willian Jose and Juanmi, giving the Basque club's new coach Asier Garitano the perfect start. The other winners so far on the opening weekend are Levante, who triumphed 3-0 at Betis on Friday."
32,20/05/2018,23:10,Iniesta bows out with Barca win thanks to brilliant Coutinho strike,Andres Iniesta waved goodbye to Barcelona on Sunday and his supposed successor scored the winner as Philippe Coutinho's superb strike sealed a 1-0 victory over Real Sociedad.,"Iniesta, with a tear in his eye, walked off to a standing ovation from the Camp Nou when substituted in the second half, having unfastened his captain's armband and handed it to Lionel Messi. If Messi is to become Barca's new leader, Coutinho is the player marked out to assume Iniesta's creative responsibilities and it was perhaps fitting the Brazilian proved the difference on a night almost entirely devoted to his 34-year-old team-mate. After his number eight had come up on the fourth official's board, Iniesta first hugged Messi and then embraced the rest of his colleagues. He clapped the crowd, blew them a kiss, before exhaling and ducking into the dug-out. After 22 years at the club and 16 in the first team, Iniesta's 674 appearances for Barcelona is bettered only by Xavi Hernandez, who was also on the pitch before kick-off to join in the tributes. Real Sociedad welcomed Iniesta with a guard of honour while the crowd formed an impressive mosaic to spell out 'Infinit Iniesta' on the two sides of the Camp Nou, with an infinity symbol, doubling up as number eights, at the ends. A giant flag behind one of the goals read 'Gracies Per Tant', 'thank you for so much'. Iniesta exchanged pennants with Xabi Prieto, the 34-year-old midfielder who is also calling time after 15 years in the first team of Real Sociedad. Prieto came on in the 88th minute to great appreciation from the visiting support. There was also a football match to win and Barcelona's victory means they finish top of La Liga on 93 points, 14 ahead of their nearest rivals Atletico Madrid and 17 clear of Real. The one blot on the night was an injury to Ousmane Dembele, who had to go off in the 53rd minute after sustaining an injury to his right foot towards the end of the first half. Dembele was seen being handed an ice pack on the bench, with France now facing an anxious wait for the diagnosis before the start of the World Cup. Ernesto Valverde stayed true to his word that he would rest Messi, who only came on for the final 23 minutes. Early on, Gerard Pique miscued when left free at a corner and Ivan Rakitic headed wide but otherwise Real Sociedad were fairly comfortable in the first half. Nelson Semedo wanted a penalty after he was tripped by Alberto De La Bella and Luis Suarez wanted a harsher punishment when Raul Navas lunged in on Dembele. Navas, nowhere near the ball, caught Dembele's right foot and Suarez was booked for his complaints to referee Jose Munuera. Dembele finished the half but was taken off shortly after the interval as Denis Suarez came on to replace the French forward. Coutinho's goal came rather out of the blue but was no less impressive for the fact as he wiggled his way into space on the left of the penalty area and curled a trademark shot inside the far corner. That was his last significant contribution before being replaced by Messi, who almost set up a second only for Denis Suarez to squander the finish. Finally, Iniesta was replaced in the 82nd minute by Paco Alcacer and the fans did not stop chanting the veteran's name until the final whistle blew."
33,04/05/2018,03:30,'Clasico of honour' - Real look to crash unbeaten Barca's party,"Real Madrid can transform their own season by beating Liverpool in this month's Champions League final, and on Sunday they can dent Barcelona's by becoming the first team to defeat the Catalans in La Liga.","This 'clasico' at Camp Nou will have minimal impact on the league, with Barca already crowned champions and Real's passing interest in pipping Atletico to second place diminished by their ambitions in Europe. But there is still much at stake in what Madrid's daily newspaper Marca has billed ""the clasico of honour"". It could even be argued this match will go some way to defining the seasons of these two teams. Barca, in particular, have been careful in celebrating their domestic double, their players aware of the disappointment that lingers from their Champions League crash in the quarter-finals. Even as they ordered pizza and slurped beer from the top of their open-top bus down Las Ramblas this week, it was noticeable how many interviews still referenced the disappointment in Rome. ""The elimination in the Champions League, it hurt us because it was unexpected,"" said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde. ""But it is very difficult to do what we have done and now what are we going to do? We keep trying."" To soften the blow, Barca's best response was to win the Copa del Rey and La Liga and finish unbeaten in the league for the first time, while hoping Real do not go all the way in the Champions League. The latter two are still to be decided. Real's march towards a 13th European triumph has certainly weighed heavily on Barcelona, whose sense of absence has been heightened by the progress of their rivals. ""It's amazing to be in a Champions League final for the third time in a row and have the chance to win it for the fourth time in the last five years,"" Real midfielder Toni Kroos said on Tuesday. ""It's hard for me to find words to describe that. When it comes to the Champions League, we have extra motivation."" Barca are looking to avoid defeat this weekend, and in their last three league games against Villarreal, Levante and Real Sociedad to seal a historic season. But if Real snatch a victory at the Camp Nou and also see off Liverpool, perhaps the balance is tipped in their favour. It will certainly be the last 'clasico' for Andres Iniesta as a player while Gareth Bale may also wave goodbye to this fixture, with the Welshman expected to consider his future at Real in the summer. The suggestion is both teams could give the departing Iniesta, Barca's captain, a guard of honour, even if Real refuse to do so for Barcelona's La Liga triumph. Bale was again a substitute against Bayern Munich on Tuesday, meaning he has now started only one of Real's six Champions League knock-out games. Zidane has been playing Bale, and resting key players, in La Liga matches but he is not likely to field a weakened team this weekend. Elsewhere, Sevilla will play their first match under their caretaker coach Joaquin Caparros on Friday against Real Sociedad. Vincenzo Montella was sacked after last weekend's loss to lowly Levante, which left the team eighth in the table and a point outside the Europa League qualification places. ""We have changed some subtle things but there is no time,"" Caparros said on Thursday. ""Our work with the players so far has been more than anything emotional."" Atletico Madrid, who are five points ahead of Real, host struggling Espanyol on Sunday."
34,10/04/2018,22:07,Real Sociedad legend Prieto to retire at end of season,"Real Sociedad's legendary captain Xabi Prieto will retire at the end of the current campaign, the La Liga club have announced.","Prieto came through the youth system at the Basque side and, after making his debut in 2003, has gone on to play 530 games for the first team. ""Xabi Prieto will hang up his boots at the end of the season,"" a Real Sociedad statement read on Tuesday. The 34-year-old one-club man is fifth in the San Sebastian side's list of all-time leading appearance makers. ""Your class on and off the pitch will be etched forever in the memory of the Real Sociedad family,"" added the club's statement."

Moya has agreed a contract until June 2020. ""Real Sociedad and Atletico Madrid have reached an agreement in principle for the transfer of Miguel Angel Moya,"" a Sociedad statement read. Sociedad were granted permission to sign another player after Athletic Bilbao activated Inigo Martinez's release clause at the end of January. Moya could make his debut against Real Betis in La Liga on Thursday."
36,18/02/2018,22:52,"Real Madrid win eight-goal thriller, Atletico keep up Barca chase",Man of the moment Marco Asensio scored twice and Cristiano Ronaldo was also on target as Real Madrid kept up the feel-good factor with a thrilling 5-3 victory at Real Betis in La Liga on Sunday night.,"Madrid had been 2-1 down at half-time in a fantastic game at the Benito Villamarin, but they came roaring back in the second half with Sergio Ramos, Asensio -- who had scored the opener - Ronaldo and Karim Benzema all finding the net. They survived a late Betis onslaught, and after their 3-1 Champions League last 16, first-leg win against Paris Saint-Germain in midweek, this victory confirms that Zinedine Zidane's side are looking better in La Liga now too. They remain fourth, a huge 17 points behind leaders Barcelona. However, this was their fourth win in five league outings, and they are back to within a point of third-placed Valencia with a game in hand to come at Leganes in midweek. Asensio had come off the bench to set up the two late goals that allowed Real to beat PSG and he was rewarded with a start on Sunday in Seville, while Gareth Bale also came in as the likes of Benzema and Luka Modric dropped to the bench. Asensio duly headed Madrid into an 11th-minute lead after Antonio Adan had saved a Ronaldo shot, but Betis had won when the sides last met at the Santiago Bernabeu and they hit back brilliantly. Loren and Joaquin, the latter from a free-kick, both came close before Aissa Mandi headed in a Joaquin cross to make it 1-1 in the 33rd minute. It was 2-1 shortly after, as visiting defender Nacho could only help a Junior shot into his own net, and the home fans in the crowd of over 53,000 erupted. Real also saw Marcelo limp off in the first half -- a potentially worrying sign ahead of the PSG second leg -- but they recovered superbly after the restart. Ramos, whose Sevilla past always ensures a hot reception from the Betis fans, levelled with a bullet header from a Lucas Vazquez corner. Dani Carvajal then set up Asensio for his second and Real's third as the hour approached, and Ronaldo smashed in their fourth goal in the 65th minute. The Portuguese, supposedly in decline, has now scored 10 times in six games between league and Champions League. Betis may lack the consistency to properly contest a European place, but they do provide entertainment, and Cristian Tello set up fellow substitute Sergio Leon to make it 4-3 late on. Benzema, on from the bench, completed the scoring at the death with a goal that will boost his confidence. Earlier, Kevin Gameiro came off the bench in the second half to score one goal and make another for Diego Costa as second-placed Atletico Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0. It was another clinical performance from Diego Simeone's side, who have now recorded four consecutive league victories, all without conceding a goal. They remain second, seven points behind unbeaten leaders Barcelona, who won 2-0 at Eibar on Saturday ahead of their Champions League trip to Chelsea. ""We are not stopping, we are playing well at the moment, and we are enjoying ourselves,"" said Gameiro when asked about his team's pursuit of Barcelona. Atletico, who have conceded a paltry nine goals in 24 La Liga games this season, will hope to stay within striking distance of Barcelona before going to the Camp Nou in a fortnight. Villarreal are sixth after a 1-1 draw at Espanyol, while Real Sociedad beat Levante 3-0."
37,18/02/2018,18:24,"Gameiro, Costa on target as Atletico keep up Barcelona chase",Kevin Gameiro came off the bench to score one goal and make another for Diego Costa as Atletico Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0 in La Liga on Sunday.,"It was another clinical performance from Diego Simeone's side, who have now recorded four consecutive league victories, all without their mean defence conceding a goal. They remain second, seven points behind unbeaten league leaders Barcelona, who won 2-0 at Eibar on Saturday ahead of their Champions League last 16, first leg away to Chelsea. Former Chelsea striker Costa returned for Atletico at the Wanda Metropolitano after injury prevented him from taking part in their 4-1 Europa League win over FC Copenhagen in Denmark on Thursday. Atletico created little in the first half to get the crowd of just over 60,000 out of their seats. However, they livened up after the restart, and in particular after Gameiro was sent on for Koke just before the hour mark. It was Atletico's French connection that led to the opening goal midway through the second half, with Antoine Griezmann setting up Gameiro, who took a touch before firing low past Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the far corner for his fifth league goal of the season. Gameiro then turned provider with a fine through ball for Costa, who fired home to secure the points with 10 minutes remaining, the goal his second in La Liga since returning to Spain. ""We are not stopping, we are playing well at the moment, and we are enjoying ourselves,"" said Gameiro when asked about his team's pursuit of Barcelona at the top of the table. Atletico, who have conceded a paltry nine goals in 24 La Liga games this season, will hope to stay within striking distance of Barcelona before going to the Camp Nou in a fortnight. Simeone's side are also nine points clear of third-placed Valencia, who came from behind to win 2-1 at bottom club Malaga on Saturday. Real Madrid, in fourth, are at Betis on Sunday evening. Earlier on Sunday, Real Sociedad beat struggling Levante 3-0 at Anoeta."
38,18/09/2017,14:48,Bale strikes in vital Madrid win at Sociedad,Gareth Bale responded in style to his critics with a fine finish as Real Madrid got back to winning ways with a 3-1 win at Real Sociedad on Sunday.,"Borja Mayoral rewarded a bright start by Real with his first Madrid goal before Sociedad's Kevin Rodrigues scored at both ends to give the visitors a 2-1 half-time lead. And Bale secured the three points as he sped past Rodrigues and dinked the ball over Geronimo Rulli for just his second goal of the season on the hour mark. Victory moves the European champions up to fourth and within four points of leaders Barcelona. Without the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo, as he completed a five-game ban, and injured Karim Benzema, Zinedine Zidane handed 20-year-old Mayoral a shock start up front. And the Frenchman's faith was rewarded inside 20 minutes when Mayoral swept home a loose ball with a classy finish from close range. Mayoral's strike meant Madrid have now matched a world record of scoring in 73 consecutive games set by Pele's Santos in the 1960s. However, the visitors' joy lasted just nine minutes as Rodrigues levelled thanks to a blunder from Keylor Navas. Rodrigues fired Alvaro Odriozola's cross towards goal on the volley, but the Real 'keeper should have made a comfortable stop rather than letting the ball slip under his grasp. The match was then held up as a cameraman had to be stretchered off with his leg heavily strapped as he was injured from fans surging forward from a temporary stand behind the goal Sociedad were defending. Once the game got back underway, a crazy 60 seconds for Rodrigues swung the match back in Madrid's favour. The left-back was inches away from bagging a second when his looping effort came back off the bar. However, Real broke straight up the other end and the unfortunate Rodrigues turned Mayoral's cross into his own net. Real could even have extended their lead before the break as Luka Modric stung the palms of Rulli and Marco Asensio curled just wide. Bale had received stinging criticism from the Spanish press and Madrid fans for his underwhelming displays in Ronaldo's absence in recent weeks as Real dropped points at home to Valencia and Levante. However, he scored for the fifth straight match at Anoeta as his pace took him beyond the Sociedad defence before coolly chipping over the advancing Rulli. Earlier, Alaves sacked Argentine coach Luis Zubeldia after just four games in charge as they slipped to the bottom of La Liga with a 3-0 defeat at home to Villarreal. Zubeldia failed to muster a point or even a solitary goal in his brief stint in charge with defeats to Leganes, Barcelona and Celta Vigo also sealing his fate. By contrast, Sevilla's impressive start to the season continued with victory on the road at Girona to move up to second. Luis Muriel's first goal for the club since completing a 20 million euro ($24 million) move from Sampdoria was enough for a 1-0 win. And former Chelsea striker Loic Remy also bagged his first goal for Las Palmas to secure a 1-0 win over Athletic Bilbao."
39,26/11/2016,14:17,Luis Enrique aims to forget Sociedad woe,Barcelona boss Luis Enrique insisted the Catalan giants struggles away at Real Sociedad will have no impact on his side's preparation when they travel to San Sebastian on Sunday.,"The Spanish champions have a terrible recent record at Anoeta, failing to win on any of their last six league visits including five defeats. Enrique's toughest moment as Barca boss also came after a 1-0 defeat to then David Moyes's Sociedad in January 2015 after which sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta was sacked and Enrique also nearly lost his job. ""I am not interested in what happened in the past because it doesn't affect what will happen tomorrow,"" Enrique said on Saturday. ""We are aware of the difficulty of the game but what happened in the past has no influence."" Barca need to avoid another slip up to avoid losing more ground on La Liga leaders Real Madrid ahead of their clash in El Clasico next weekend. Real can extend their lead over Barca to seven points on Saturday with victory at home to Sporting Gijon. Enrique is confident Gerard Pique will be fit to start against Sociedad despite missing training on Friday due to a knock. Andres Iniesta and Samuel Umtiti are not included in Enrique's 18-man squad, but still maintain hope of returning to face Madrid on December 3."

Juanmi, 23, is heading back to the Spanish league after just a year with Southampton, where he signed a four-year deal in 2015 with a seven-million-euros release clause after previously spending five seasons at Malaga. ""It's a matter of pride to be part of an historic club, a big club with an exciting project and a great group,"" said Juanmi, who has twice won the European under-19 title with Spain."
41,29/04/2016,14:54,Zidane hopeful of having Ronaldo and Benzema fit for City,Real Madrid will be without Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema for Saturday's trip to Real Sociedad in La Liga but coach Zinedine Zidane is hopeful of having both back to face Manchester City next week.,"Ronaldo has missed Madrid's last two games, including the 0-0 draw away to City in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday, while Benzema came off in that match and his club later confirmed he was suffering from a thigh injury. Zidane admitted it was not worth risking either player against Real Sociedad but indicated both could feature in the semi-final second leg against City at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday. ""The most important thing for now is that they recover. We can't take risks with Cristiano or Karim, or anybody. The idea is that they come back as soon as possible,"" Zidane told a press conference on Friday ahead of Saturday's game in San Sebastian. ""I can't say how likely it is that they will play (against City). I hope both are back at 100 percent but I can't say for certain."" Ronaldo sat out last weekend's 3-2 win at Rayo Vallecano with a thigh strain but Zidane said it was a different problem that kept him from playing at the Etihad Stadium. Meanwhile, Zidane had said Benzema would be out for ""seven or eight days"", leaving the Frenchman with a race against the clock to recover for the City showdown. Madrid come into the weekend one point behind Barcelona and Atletico Madrid at the top of the table with three matches remaining. Zidane's side have won their last nine league games, but he is wary of the trip to Anoeta, where Barcelona lost recently. ""We know it will be a difficult match at a difficult venue, but as always we need to focus on ourselves,"" he said."
42,29/12/2015,02:15,History-makers Real seek end-of-year boost,Real Madrid host Real Sociedad on Wednesday intent on producing another tub-thumping performance to follow up their historic 10 goals and shore up under-fire Rafael Benitez's position as coach.,"Real became the first side to reach double figures in a La Liga match in 55 years in their 10-2 dissection of Rayo Vallecano prior to the short Spanish winter break. But not even that was enough to deter fans at the Santiago Bernabeu from booing Benitez, whose position remains precarious if reports are to be believed. Real closed the gap on league leaders Barcelona and Atletico Madrid to two points, with German midfielder Toni Kroos summing up the end-of-year mood in the Madrid dressing room. ""We all want to do better, for each other and for our fans,"" he told the club's official website. ""We've failed to be at our best at certain points of the season. ""We work our socks off on a daily basis and the pay off for that hard work will end up being reflected in the results. ""I'm positive that we'll find that consistency that is not only demanded of us by our fans, but that we too yearn for."" The World Cup winner begged Real's supporters to keep the faith. ""It's too early to be making evaluations. We are Real Madrid and being successful is part of our DNA."" France international defender Raphael Varane, out for the past month with a hamstring injury, could start after returning to full training. However, the club on Monday lost their appeal against being kicked out of the Copa del Rey for fielding an ineligible player, with Spain's Administrative Tribunal for Sport (TAD) insisting the decision was final. Barca, who have a game in hand, welcome Real Betis to the Camp Nou with the players planning to show off the five trophies collected in 2015 in La Liga, the Copa del Rey, Champions League, Super Cup and last weekend's Club World Cup in Japan. On Sunday Barca and club superstar Lionel Messi triumphed at the Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai, taking home the prizes for best team and best player. Messi had travelled from Argentina to attend the ceremony. ""It's very nice to receive these awards, but I always say that the team makes it possible,"" said Messi. ""It's been an extraordinary year."" Atletico, second on goal difference, are on the road at Rayo where they will seek to return to winning ways after missing the chance to go top when succumbing 1-0 to Malaga before Christmas, with captain Gabi sent-off. Fourth-placed Celta Vigo could end the year in third if Real come unstuck against Sociedad and they see off Athletic Bilbao. Elsewhere, newly-appointed Valencia coach Gary Neville faces a momentous four days, with Thursday's derby at Villarreal followed Sunday by Real's visit to Valencia's Mestalla stadium."
43,29/11/2015,00:01,"Messi, Neymar, Suarez strike to keep Barca rolling","Barcelona maintained their four-point lead at the top of La Liga on Saturday thanks to another clinical display from Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez to down Real Sociedad 4-0.","Atletico Madrid kept the pressure on the European champions thanks to Antoine Griezmann's solitary goal in a 1-0 win over Espanyol. Real Madrid are now nine points adrift ahead of their trip to Eibar on Sunday. Messi was making his first league start in two months as he continues his comeback from knee ligament damage. But the Argentine was initially outshone by his strike partners as they each swept home from two Dani Alves crosses to put Barca in command at the break. Neymar then added his second shortly after the half-time before teeing up Messi for his first league goal since September in stoppage time. ""They are constantly looking for one another and when they all score everyone is happy,"" Dani Alves told Canal Plus about Barca's front three. ""Without victories it doesn't matter who scores or sets up the goals. If we all keep playing well, we will all be happy."" Barca boss Luis Enrique made four changes from the side that destroyed Roma 6-1 in the Champions League in midweek, but with Messi, Suarez and Neymar deployed once more in attack, the Catalans didn't miss a beat. Suarez should have opened the scoring after just two minutes when he was brilliantly played in by Neymar, but Geronimo Rulli rushed from his line to bravely smother the Uruguayan's effort just inside his area. Even when Rulli was beaten, the woodwork saved Sociedad when Andres Iniesta headed Suarez's perfectly measured cross against the post. The visitors' luck eventually ran out on 22 minutes, though, when Messi released Alves down the right and Neymar was quickest to meet his low cross and drive the ball into the top corner. Alves was the creator once more for Barca's second just before the break as his floated cross picked out Suarez to acrobatically volley into the far corner. Barca had to wait just eight minutes after the break for a third with the full-backs proving Sociedad's downfall again as this time Jeremy Mathieu squared for Neymar to apply a simple finish. That strike took Neymar and Suarez's tally in La Liga this season to 26 -- the same as the entire Real Madrid squad. However, both then turned their hand to trying to set up Messi. It looked like being a forlorn afternoon for Messi when his brilliant curling effort came back off the crossbar four minutes from time. However, a final piece of magic between Neymar and Suarez allowed the Brazilian to roll the ball invitingly across goal for Messi to slot into an empty net and seal a fantastic week for Barca which has seen them take a strangle hold of La Liga and clinch their place in the last 16 of the Champions League. Atletico had to once again settle for victory by a solitary goal despite a more impressive attacking display after Griezmann had prodded home Oliver Torres's third minute cross for his 10th goal of the season. The hosts suffered a setback when influential midfielder Tiago was stretchered off with a broken right leg midway through the first-half. Atletico were still rarely troubled, though, and should have added to their advantage after the break as Diego Godin and Koke struck the post. Fernando Torres also curled an effort just over as his search for his 100th Atletico goal continues, but a 12th clean sheet in 18 games this season was enough to close to gap on Barca. Celta Vigo moved level with Real in third thanks to Nolito's fortuitous winner five minutes from time to squeeze past Sporting Gijon 2-1. Deportivo la Coruna are on their Galician rivals tails in fifth as an early David Simon own goal and Lucas Perez's ninth league goal of the season handed them a 2-0 win at Las Palmas. And Malaga spurned a huge chance to move out of the relegation zone as Granada struck twice in the last 10 minutes to claim a 2-2 draw at La Rosaleda."
44,09/11/2015,23:03,Moyes's Sociedad reign ends in another sacking,Former Manchester United manager David Moyes was sacked by Real Sociedad on Monday after a turbulent year in charge during which he failed to turn around the Basque side's fortunes.,"""Real Sociedad have decided to cancel the contract of first team coach David Moyes,"" a club statement announced. ""The club wish to thank him ... for all he brought to the club, his professionalism and his dedication in carrying out his duties."" Former Barcelona reserve team coach Eusebio Sacristan will take over from the Scot, after signing a contract that runs until June 2017. Moyes took charge of the San Sebastian outfit last November, just seven months after being fired by United after for overseeing a disastrous debut campaign following the retirement of club legend Alex Ferguson as United finished outside the top four in the Premier League for the first time in 24 years. However, Friday's 2-0 defeat at newly-promoted Las Palmas left Sociedad above the relegation zone only on goal difference with just nine points from their first 11 games, exactly the same situation they were in when Moyes was hired 364 days ago. Moyes's contract was due to run until the end of the season, but, despite being a personal favourite of president Jokin Aperribay, the pressure from fans and local media was too much to bear for those in charge of the club. Above all, Moyes was criticised for his failure to adapt to the Spanish style of play and master the language. The 52-year-old regularly complained about the way games are refereed in Spain during press conferences he always gave in English. There had been moments of promise early in Moyes's reign as he dragged an under-performing squad away from the relegation zone. A 1-0 win over a Barcelona that would go on to win the treble a few months later in January was undoubtedly the highlight. Yet, a season that began with plenty of optimism after the return of midfielder Asier Illarramendi to the club from Real Madrid for 17.5 million euros ($18.8 million, £12.5 million) has been a huge disappointment. Moyes's men managed just two victories, against the league's bottom two sides Granada and Levante, and with the daunting task of Sevilla and Barcelona to come after the international break, a change at the helm became inevitable."

Antoine Griezmann then doubled the hosts' advantage against his former club shortly afterwards to end the game as a contest inside the first 10 minutes. Barcelona can regain their nine-point lead over Atletico when they and closest challengers Real Madrid are in action against Almeria and Rayo Vallecano respectively on Wednesday.

We made mistakes and we made mistakes for the second goal as well."" Defeat all but ends Sociedad's outside hopes of qualifying for the Europa League, but the former Manchester United boss insisted he never thought that was a realistic target having taken over the Basque outfit with the remit of avoiding relegation. ""I've aways felt like it would be too difficult to make Europe. The distance to make up was too far,"" Moyes added. ""We've been on a very good run. We've had two difficult away games and I think the players have done a lot of good things."" Sociedad beat Atletico 2-1 when the sides met back in November and came into the game having lost just one of their last eight La Liga games, but were on the back foot straight away as Arda Turan volleyed against the post inside 60 seconds. The visitors managed to scramble the rebound behind but from the resulting corner, Gonzalez could only flick Koke's in-swinging delivery into the far corner. Eight minutes later it was 2-0 as Geronimo Rulli could only parry Koke's fierce drive into the path of Griezmann, who slammed the ball high into the net but refused to celebrate out of respect to the club he spent nine years with prior to his big money move to Atletico last summer. Griezmann came close to inflicting more pain on his former employers as he was denied by a last-ditch tackle from Gonzalez before nodding just wide from another dangerous corner. Sociedad gradually grew into the game, but only seriously threatened Jan Oblak's goal when Chory Castro's powerful shot forced the Slovenian into a smart save. Atletico took the sting out of the game in the second-half with next week's Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid in mind. However, they were still characteristically solid at the back to secure a fifth consecutive clean sheet and move four points clear of Valencia in the fight to make it back to the Champions League next season."
50,22/02/2015,14:06,Sociedad beat Sevilla in seven-goal thriller,David Moyes's Real Sociedad struck twice in the final 10 minutes to come from behind and beat Sevilla 4-3 in a thrilling match on Sunday.,"The hosts had got off to an ideal start as Imanol Agirretxe slotted home the opener after 16 minutes, but Timothee Kolodziejczak levelled for the Europa League holders before the break. Sociedad were then gifted a soft penalty at the start of the second period, which Xabi Prieto converted, but Sevilla responded once more when their top scorer Carlos flicked home Ever Banega's free-kick. Sevilla then looked set to go on and claim a vital three points in their battle for a return to Champions League football next season when Kevin Gameiro scored from the spot after a handball by Inigo Martinez inside the area. However, there was a final twist as Sociedad equalised when the ball ricocheted into the net off the unfortunate Arribas from Gonzalo Castro's initial effort. And Moyes' men then grabbed the winner when Prieto flicked home a corner at the near post as the game entered stoppage time. Defeat means Sevilla still trail Valencia by five points in the fight for fourth place, while Sociedad jump three places to 10th and are now eight points clear of the relegation zone."
51,31/01/2015,19:11,"Ease up on 'exceptional' Bale, Moyes tells Madrid fans",David Moyes was sick with envy after watching Real Madrid dismantle his Real Sociedad side 4-1 and called on the Bernabeu crowd to give Gareth Bale a break as he endured a frustrating day in front of goal.,"The spotlight was on Bale in the absence of the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo but, despite teeing up Karim Benzema for Madrid's third, he spurned a series of chances to keep his recent scoring streak going. Bale has been accused by some in Spain of being too selfish in recent weeks and there were more whistles for the Welshman when he took Benzema's pass off the toes of James Rodriguez before somehow firing wide just before half-time. ""Gareth Bale is a top player. The important thing when you have those players is that you encourage them,"" said Moyes. ""I think he had one or two chances today. On another day he would score. He's an exceptional player."" Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti also tried to play down Bale's bad day in front of goal. ""I don't want more from him. He played very well,"" said the Italian. ""It is true that he missed two big chances, but he gave an assist to Benzema for the 3-1. He works for his team-mates."" Being able to replace the World Player of the Year with the world's most expensive player is not a luxury afforded to Moyes in his new role in San Sebastian. Despite repeatedly signalling his intentions to add to his squad in recent week, the transfer deadline for Spanish clubs on Friday came and went without any new arrivals at Anoeta. ""We were disappointed we didn't make some purchases in the January window. We tried very hard,"" added Moyes, who had similar troubles during his ill-fated 11 month spell in charge of Manchester United. Sociedad have shown their ability to upset the odds this season with home victories over Real, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, and they couldn't have asked for a better start at the Bernabeu when 20-year-old Aritz Elustondo bulleted Ruben Pardo's corner past Iker Casillas. However, James Rodriguez quickly levelled before Sergio Ramos and a brace from Karim Benzema moved Madrid four points clear at the top of the table. ""I don't know if we touched the ball again until they scored. Real Madrid are terrific at scoring goals from crosses. We had worked on it, but I think the first two goals came from crosses to the back post. ""I think the way they played in the first half was as good as I have come up against. They were very difficult to lay a glove on. ""I have really enjoyed my experience at the Bernabeu here. I've watched one of the top sides in the world."""
52,31/01/2015,17:57,Ronaldo-less Madrid too strong for Moyes's Sociedad,Real Madrid recovered from an awful start to move four points clear at the top of La Liga with a 4-1 win over Real Sociedad on Saturday.,"With World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo missing through suspension, Madrid were stunned in the first minute when Aritz Elustondo headed the visitors into a shock lead, but they were level almost instantly when James Rodriguez nodded home. Sergio Ramos handed the hosts a deserved 2-1 lead at half-time before Karim Benzema scored twice after the break. Second-placed Barcelona aren't in action until Sunday when they host Villarreal, while champions Atletico Madrid take on Eibar later on Saturday. Sociedad boss David Moyes hadn't lost to Real coach Carlo Ancelotti in six previous meetings when they were in charge of Everton and Chelsea respectively, and Sociedad had already shown their ability to upset the odds with victory over Madrid and Barcelona at home this season. Moyes's men couldn't have hoped for a better start when youngster Elustondo bulleted Ruben Pardo's corner past Iker Casillas with barely a minute gone. However, the Basques have yet to win away from home this season and their fragility was exposed just two minutes later when Rodriguez sneaked ahead of his marker to head Marcelo's cross into the top corner. The visitors then suffered a huge blow when top scorer Carlos Vela limped off after just 17 minutes and the Mexican's absence sapped Sociedad of any attacking threat thereafter as the European champions pilled on the pressure. Benzema and Rodriguez fired straight at Geronimo Rulli when well-placed inside the area, while Gareth Bale saw a header flash just wide. Rulli denied Benzema again from a narrow angle eight minutes before the break, but the ball fell kindly for Ramos to rifle home his sixth goal of the season. Bale missed a huge opportunity to make it three before the break as he took Benzema's pass off the toes of Rodriguez, but somehow managed to fire wide of an open goal. The Welshman didn't take long to make amends, though, when he teed up Benzema for a simple tap in to put the game beyond Sociedad six minutes into the second period. Bale was then denied by a goal-line clearance from Inigo Martinez with Rulli out of position. However, there was no stopping Benzema 14 minutes from time as he exchanged passes with Isco before thrashing the ball high into the far corner for his 17th goal of the season. Bale's chance to make his mark in Ronaldo's absence was frustrated one final time when he broke clear on goal, but Rulli stood tall again to block with his legs."
53,30/01/2015,02:22,Moyes tests Real Madrid mettle without Ronaldo,David Moyes will face the biggest test of his brief spell in charge of Real Sociedad when the Basques visit Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday.,"However, the trip for Moyes's men isn't quite as daunting as it could have been with three-time World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo banned for kicking out at Cordoba defender Edimar during Madrid's 2-1 win last weekend. Gareth Bale sealed those crucial three points for Carlo Ancelotti's men with a late penalty after Ronaldo had been dismissed for the ninth time in his career. And Madrid will need Bale to be on top form whilst their top scorer watches on from the sidelines for the next two games. Bale netted in Ronaldo's absence through injury when the sides met earlier in the season, but, despite roaring into an early 2-0 lead, Madrid were eventually defeated 4-2. Upsets have been a feature of Sociedad's season as they have beaten La Liga champions Atletico Madrid and Barcelona as well as Real under three different coaches. Moyes masterminded the latest of those triumphs against Barca early this month, but his side have failed to kick on since with just one win in five games since to remain in the bottom half of the table. Esteban Granero will be returning to face the club where he started his career and all too aware that Sociedad have to be at their best if they are to shock Madrid once more. ""January is a difficult month for them because they play a lot of games and it seems that they aren't in the same form that they were before, but they have too much potential for that to affect us. Moreover, they are playing at the Bernabeu where they have fewer doubts. ""We expect to face the best Real Madrid, but if we are also at our best then we have a chance to win."" On top of Ronaldo's absence, Pepe and Luka Modric remain out injured, but Isco should return in midfield after missing out against Cordoba. Victory for Madrid will open up a four-point gap on Barcelona, who face the in-form Villarreal at the Camp Nou on Sunday. The Catalans have been on fire themselves in recent weeks, scoring 26 times in seven straight wins since starting the year with defeat at Sociedad. Nemyar was the star with a double as Luis Enrique's men booked their place in the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey with a 3-2 win over Atletico Madrid in midweek to already take his tally for the season to 21. Villarreal are unbeaten in 18 games in all competitions stretching back to November, but will have to stop Barca's devastating attack without the services of Brazilian defender Gabriel Paulista, who joined Arsenal on Wednesday. As part of that deal, Costa Rica forward Joel Campbell has joined the Yellow Submarine on loan for the rest of the season and could feature this weekend. Atletico, meanwhile, will have to lift themselves quickly from the disappointment of being dumped out of the Cup if they are to stay in the title race when they visit Eibar on Saturday. Captain Gabi and Mario Suarez were both sent-off against Barca in midweek as Diego Simeone's men lost their heads after the visitors' third goal, but both will be free to play as their suspensions will only apply to Copa del Rey matches. Simeone will also be able to welcome back Diego Godin from suspension, whilst Spanish international Koke should be fit after missing the last two games through injury. Elsewhere, Sevilla can reclaim fourth place after being leapfrogged by Valencia last weekend when they host Espanyol on Sunday as Valencia aren't in action until Monday when they travel to Malaga.

54,05/01/2015,00:57,Moyes hails Barca conquest his 'happiest night',Real Sociedad's David Moyes lauded the heroic efforts of his players who beat Barcelona 1-0 on Sunday thanks to a Jordi Alba own goal in a day of shocks in La Liga.,"Earlier, Real Madrid's 22-game winning streak was ended by a 2-1 defeat to Valencia meaning both giants of the Spanish game were beaten on the same day for the first time since April 30, 2011. However, despite their lowly league position of 13th, Sociedad have shown themselves well capable of upsetting the odds having now defeated Barca, Real and champions Atletico Madrid at home under three different coaches. And Moyes believes his challenge now is to draw that level of performance out of his players on a more consistent basis. ""It is the happiest night since I arrived in San Sebastian. We worked very hard. The players showed courage and defended incredibly,"" said the Scot. ""This team has shown it is capable in the big games against the best teams in the league and now we must show the same capability to win the other games. At home, for example, we have let a lot of points slip away. ""We defended well tonight and that is what we have to do in all the games, but in other games when we don't have to defend so much we also have to pass the ball and attack better."" Barca boss Luis Enrique paid a heavy price for leaving both Lionel Messi and Neymar amongst nearly 300 million euros of talent on the bench. Both South American stars only arrived back in Spain on Friday after an extended Christmas break and Moyes defended his counterpart's decision to only introduce them after the break. ""The best players can't always play at their best level in every match. The biggest games for Barcelona are still to come and in that sense I think Luis Enrique made the right decision. ""I was hoping this would happen, that some of their most important players wouldn't start and we were prepared for that."" Enrique also refused to accept that he had made an error with his starting line-up as Barca had more than 70 percent of possession and 17 efforts on goal, but failed to take their chances. ""To feel sorry afterwards doesn't help anyone. I took the decision to avoid risks with players that made a long journey only a few days ago. ""I thought it was better not to risk it and we will never know if things would have been different if I had made a different decision. ""I can only remember the goal and then us dominating. There weren't that many chances, but I think we deserved more. We didn't have the luck or the clarity we needed in front of goal."" A third league defeat of the season means Barca remain a point behind leaders Real Madrid having also played a game more than the European champions."
55,28/11/2014,22:44,Vela hat-trick gives Moyes winning home start,Former Arsenal winger Carlos Vela scored a hat-trick to give new Real Sociedad coach David Moyes a winning home start in La Liga with a 3-0 victory over Elche on Friday.,"Former Everton and Manchester United manager Moyes had seen his team draw 0-0 at Deportivo in the Scot's first game in charge last weekend. Any worries he had over his home debut at the Anoeta stadium were eased after just three minutes when Mexico international Vela found the target with a powerful header. Vela made it 2-0 on the half-hour mark with a calm, incisive finish following a superb Xabi Prieto ball and he completed his hat-trick eight minutes into the second half by stabbing into the net at the far post after latching onto a Carlos Martinez pass. Vela now has five goals for the season while the win, just a third in La Liga for the San Sebastian side, took Moyes's new charges into 12th place in the table."
56,23/11/2014,01:11,Moyes begins Sociedad reign with Deportivo stalemate,Former Manchester United manager David Moyes endured an underwhelming start to life as Real Sociedad coach as the Basques were held to a 0-0 draw away to struggling Deportivo la Coruna on Saturday.,"The visitors enjoyed the better of the opening 45 minutes with ex-Arsenal striker Carlos Vela particularly lively as the Mexican saw a dipping effort saved by Depor 'keeper Fabricio and then fired over with the best chance of the first-half. However, it was Deportivo that enjoyed the best of the second period and Enaut Zubikarai had to be alert to turn Juan Rodriguez's low effort behind seven minutes from time to ensure they returned to San Sebastian with a point. ""It was a great experience and I am very happy to have made my debut in La Liga"", said Moyes. ""It is true that I don't know the players that much, but I am delighted to be here and little by little we will improve. ""I wanted to win and I am not happy with the draw because we worked hard, but, in the end, we can say it was a fair result."" A draw moves Sociedad up one place to 14th, but they remain just one point above the relegation zone alongside Deportivo on 10 points from 12 games. Moyes made four changes to the side that had beaten La Liga champions Atletico Madrid in their last outing, but it seemed he would be vindicated by those alterations as Sociedad made a bright start. Vela was full of confidence following his two goals for Mexico on his return to international duty for the first time in three years in a 3-2 victory over the Netherlands last week and fired an early warning that Fabricio just reached with his fingertips to turn the ball behind for a corner. Moyes was then an innocent bystander in a bust up between the two benches as a member of the Deportivo coaching staff was sent to the stands for taking his protests towards the referee too far. Sociedad continued to press and Vela should have done better when Chory Castro picked him out at the edge of the area, but this time he blazed over. Deportivo were far more aggressive after the break and would have been in front had Pablo Insua made a better contact when he met a corner at the far post. Vela had one more chance to put Sociedad in front when he fired into the side-netting on his weaker right foot 15 minutes from time. But it was Depor who carried the greater threat in the closing stages and Zubikarai got down well to prevent Rodriguez inflicting a disastrous start to Moyes's time in Spain."
57,12/11/2014,12:00,Sociedad keen for arrival of new boss Moyes,Former Manchester United manager David Moyes was heading to Spain Wednesday to take over as the new head coach of struggling Real Sociedad.,"""David Moyes will now arrive in San Sebastian, his new home,"" on Wednesday and will pose for the cameras before being officially presented on Thursday at 5:00 pm (1600 GMT) at his new club's Anoeta Stadium, the Basque side said in a statement. Real Sociedad's captain Xabi Prieto said the team was ""looking forward to meeting him and being under his command"". ""I think he is a good manager, a very prestigious one who did very well in England,"" Prieto said in a video on the club's website, praising the Scottish manager's record during his 11 years with Everton in the Premier League. ""It is very difficult to be so long at one club, as David was with Everton, and it is a sign that he did very well. He made the club grow and for several years he got them into Europe. I hope that same will happen with Real Sociedad."" Moyes, 51, had been expected to arrive on Tuesday and coach a training session on Wednesday but his arrival was delayed for unexplained reasons. He was sacked by Manchester United in April after less than a season in charge at Old Trafford as they failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1995. The Scot enjoyed a broadly successful 11-year spell at Everton prior taking the job at Old Trafford, although he has yet to win a major trophy as a coach. Sociedad have been looking for a new coach since Jagoba Arrasate was sacked last week after just one win in their opening 10 league games. They responded in style to beat La Liga champions Atletico Madrid 2-1 on Sunday, which saw them move out of the relegation zone. Sociedad have a history of appointing British managers, starting with Henry Lowe, who took charge for five years from 1930. Welshman John Toshack had three spells as boss there, while current Wales manager Chris Coleman had an ill-fated six months in charge during the 2007-08 season."

60,02/11/2014,22:16,Arrasate sacked by Real Sociedad,La Liga strugglers Real Sociedad have sacked coach Jagoba Arrasate after a disappointing start to the campaign which has left the Basque side in the relegation zone.,"Former Manchester United boss David Moyes and Alejandro Sabella, who led Argentina to the World Cup final, are reported to be among the candidates to replace the 36-year-old. ""Real Sociedad have decided to relieve Jagoba Arrasate of his duties as first-team coach,"" said a statement on the club's website. ""Coaches Txema Lumbreras and Bittor Alkiza have also been relieved of their duties as assistant coaches."" Arrasate was handed his first senior coaching post at the start of last season, but after a promising start as they qualified for the Champions League group stage he failed to live up to expectations as they crashed out of Europe and finished seventh in La Liga. An embarrassing early Europa League exit to Russian side FK Krasnodar followed in August and the final straw for the San Sebastian side's board came in Saturday's 1-0 home defeat by Malaga which left them with just one win from their opening 10 league games."
61,26/09/2014,09:21,Rampant Ronaldo not in need of rest,World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo has insisted he has no intentions of slowing down after firing 12 goals in his first eight appearances this season.,"Ronaldo followed up his hat-trick in a 8-2 rout of Deportivo la Coruna last weekend by scoring four times in a match for the third time in his Madrid career as the European champions continued their return to form with a 5-1 thrashing of Elche in midweek. Real also received a boost as Barcelona dropped points for the first time this season against Malaga to cut their lead over Madrid to just four points. And with a tricky trip away to Villarreal this weekend on the horizon, Ronaldo says he will not be resting as coach Carlo Ancelotti rotates his squad. ""We are at the start of the season and I want to play to gain confidence and rhythm,"" said Ronaldo. ""When the right games come I will rest and rotate, but now isn't the right moment. I want to be continue to be better."" Ronaldo's goalscoring record so far this season is all the more remarkable as he took a three-week break at the beginning of the campaign to ease knee and hamstring injuries. Ancelotti said in midweek that break had been key to his sensational return to form, but, worryingly for Real's rivals, Ronaldo believes he can still improve physically after suffering from tendonitis in his left knee towards the end of last season. ""I feel good and without any pain. I am still improving and I have a little way to go so I want to continue like this. ""I can still be better physically. I trained really hard during the break after not having a good pre-season, but now I feel confident and without pain."" Ancelotti also confirmed after the win over Elche that Karim Benzema and Luka Modric would return to the side for the trip to El Madrigal with Isco and Asier Illarramendi set to drop to the bench. However, the Italian's biggest decision is who to play in goal after handing a debut to Keylor Navas in midweek after starting captain Iker Casillas for Real's first eight games of the season. Barcelona appear to have an easier task on paper as they return home to the Camp Nou to face Granada after back-to-back away fixtures. Luis Enrique's men stretched their run of clean sheets to six games this season in a turgid 0-0 draw at Malaga, but failed to manage a single shot on target during the 90 minutes. Enrique is likely to make a number of changes ahead of Tuesday's trip to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League and Lionel Messi could even be rested as the Argentine is the only Barca player to have started every game so far this season. Barcelona were knocked off the top of table on Thursday on goals scored after Valencia defeated Cordoba 3-0. The game of the weekend comes at the Vicente Calderon as champions Atletico Madrid host Sevilla who are third on 13 points, the same as Valencia ans Barcelona. Atletico got back to winning ways in midweek with a hard-fought 1-0 win away to Almeria, but needed their sixth goal out of seven they have scored in the league so far this season from a set-piece to do so as centre-back Miranda headed home his third goal of the season. Sevilla are likely to prove an even tougher test, though, as they moved onto 13 points after five games thanks to their fourth consecutive victory at home to Real Sociedad in midweek.

62,31/08/2014,23:35,Sociedad comeback stuns Madrid,Real Sociedad produced a stunning fightback from 2-0 down to beat European champions Real Madrid 4-2 on Sunday.,"Meanwhile, bitter rivals Barcelona made it two wins in as many games under Luis Enrique with a late winner at Villarreal. Madrid were without the injured Cristiano Ronaldo and departed Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso, but still looked on course for a comfortable evening when they flew into a 2-0 lead inside the opening 11 minutes thanks to goals from Sergio Ramos and Gareth Bale. However, Inigo Martinez and David Zurutuza levelled for the hosts before the break and Zurutuza and Carlos Vela sealed a much-needed win for under-fire Sociedad boss Jagoba Arrasate. ""What happened was very unusual, especially after the first 15 minutes. After that everything was negative, we were horrible in every facet of the game,"" said Madrid captain Iker Casillas. Meanwhile, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti placed the blame for the defeat on his players' attitude after going in front. ""It is not easy to evaluate this game because there were two games. In the first half an hour we played with quality, pace and concentration and the other hour we played very badly. ""Possibly we thought the game was already finished. We conceded fouls, corners, and Sociedad got back into the game. ""What can I say? We are very sorry because I didn't like that the team played in that way for an hour."" Sociedad had lost their opening game at newly-promoted Eibar and been dumped out of the Europa League by Russian side FK Krasnodar in midweek and appeared down on their luck after another slow start. Ramos rose highest to power home Toni Kroos' corner to open the scoring before Bale left Gorka Elustondo trailing with a neat nutmeg and slotted into the bottom corner. But it was the hosts who crucially got the third goal as Martinez slammed home at the far post from Xabi Prieto's flick on. Zurutuza then levelled four minutes before the break as he powered home Alberto de la Bella's pinpoint cross from the left. Sociedad started the second period the stronger and they got their reward 25 minutes from time when Zuruztuza again timed his run into the box perfectly to connect with Prieto's low cross to the near post. Madrid's humiliation was complete 10 minutes later when substitute Carlos Vela appeared to control the ball with his hand before spinning to fire into the top corner. It was a happier evening for Barca as they were 1-0 victors at Villarreal thanks to 19-year-old Sandro Ramirez's debut goal eight minutes from time. ""It is gratifying to see the young guys score, but the most important thing is the victory,"" said Enrique. ""We kept going until the end. Villarreal defended very well and waited for the counter-attack to cause us problems."" Barca completely dominated possession in the opening 45 minutes, but failed to create clear-cut chances as Sergio Asenjo parried a drive from Pedro before turning a deflected Messi free-kick onto the post. But Villarreal were nearly gifted the lead at the start of the second period as Barca defender Jeremy Mathieu turned Jaume Costa's cross off the outside of his own post. Barca then upped the pace after Neymar replaced Munir El Haddadi and Asenjo had to be at his best again to turn away a well-struck Messi free-kick. Yet, for all their chances, Barca were inches from being behind moments later when Tomas Pina struck the inside of the post and Javier Espinosa fired the rebound inches wide. The visitors did finally make the breakthrough eight minutes from time when more fine footwork from Messi provoked another save from Asenjo, but Sandro was on hand to force the ball home from close range. There was still time for a final scare for Barca as Giovanni dos Santos smashed a volley off the post from a narrow angle, but Enrique's men held on to go top of the embryonic La Liga table."
63,25/06/2014,12:48,Barcelona sign new keeper Claudio Bravo,"Barcelona said Wednesday they have signed 31-year-old keeper Claudio Bravo, the widely anticipated new recruit to help boost their defences after the departure of Victor Valdes.","The Chilean international is signing up with Barcelona for the next four seasons, the club said in a statement. ""At 1.85 metres (6 feet, 1 inch) tall, Claudio Bravo is noted for his calmness between the posts, his leadership skills, and lots of agility,"" Barcelona said. Bravo spent eight years with Real Sociedad and has captained his national side -- now contesting the World Cup in Brazil -- since 2008. He heads to the Camp Nou along with Barcelona's other new keeper, Marc-Andre ter Stegen. Former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes said goodbye in May after 12 seasons with the club."
64,22/05/2014,02:11,Football: Koke leads Atletico's resurrection,"There are few players that represent the turnaround in Atletico Madrid's fortunes since the arrival of Diego Simeone as coach than Jorge Resurreccion, or Koke as he is more commonly known.","Simeone's own resurrection of Atletico has carried the club to four trophies in two and a half years -- including a first La Liga title in 18 years this season -- and into Saturday's Champions League final against Real Madrid in Lisbon. A product of the Atletico youth academy, the 22-year-old has had a stellar season which has seen him become not just a regular in Simeone's set-up but also in the Spanish national team. However, he didn't always seem destined for great things. Koke was part of the Atletico side that were eliminated from the Copa del Rey by third-tier Albacete just days before Simeone's arrival in December 2011 and has admitted he was on the verge of leaving the club when the transfer market opened the following month. ""Simeone has helped me improve physically and on the ball,"" he told Spanish newspaper El Pais. ""When he arrived I was about to leave, I wasn't playing a lot and I needed minutes to keep improving. ""The manager told me to trust in him, that I wouldn't necessarily be a starter every week but to work hard because my opportunity would come. We believed in each other."" That trust has borne spectacular success for both men as on top of being Atletico's top creator with 18 assists this season, Koke has also shown an eye for important goals amongst his tally of seven for the season. He scored the winner in vital away victories at Real Sociedad, Malaga and Athletic Bilbao as well as scoring at home to Real Madrid in the 2-2 draw at the Vicente Calderon in March and the only goal of the game in the second leg as Atletico eliminated Barcelona from the Champions League at the quarter-final stage. That form will see him follow his best season at club level with his first senior international tournament at the World Cup after winning the under-21 European Championship last summer. ""I have blind faith in Koke, he thinks a lot about the team,"" said Spain coach Vicente del Bosque after naming Koke in his provisional 30-man squad for the tournament in Brazil next month. ""He has given a lot to Atletico and Atletico has given a lot to him. He can play in any position and he always does well. He is an important discovery."" Del Bosque's words have been shared by Spain's most decorated player of all-time in Xavi Hernandez, who believes the Atletico starlet will be his successor in the national team. ""He is destined to carry the baton in the Spanish national team for the next 10 years. He is already an extraordinary player,"" said the Barcelona midfielder. There have been rumours that Koke could even replace Xavi at Barca in the coming years, while he has also attracted interest from Manchester United. However, of more pressing importance is securing his status as a living legend amongst the Atletico fan base by being part of the first Rojiblancos side to win the Champions League and deny rivals Real their much-awaited 10th European crown in the process."

Victory brought Martino's men back into the title race as they now trail leaders Atletico Madrid and Real by just one point with nine games remaining. However, the Argentine warned that his side can suffer no slip-ups of the kind they have suffered at Real Sociedad and Valladolid in recent weeks if they are to retain their title, starting with Celta Vigo's visit to the Camp Nou on Wednesday. ""Last weekend has allowed us to get back in the league. Now we have to continue playing well against Celta and what remains of the league season. We cannot make a mistakes,"" he said on Tuesday. ""Our wish is to perform at a high level and to have similar individual performances to those we had on Sunday. ""The competitions are entering their final stage and if we don't maintain that level it will endanger our chances of winning any titles. ""Generally, we need to be consistent. That is why we are not in a different position today, above all in the league. If we had maintained consistency in our performances and results, we would be in a much better position."" Martino has left Xavi out of his 18-man squad for the game against Celta with the Catalan derby away to Espanyol and a return to Champions League action against Atletico Madrid next week in mind. Pedro Rodriguez, Alexis Sanchez and Marc Bartra are also likely to feature after being left on the bench at the Bernabeu."

76,08/03/2014,21:54,"Football: Barcelona suffer shock defeat, Atletico go top",Barcelona slumped to their third defeat in seven league games as they lost away to relegation-threatened Valladolid 1-0 on Saturday.,"Italian Fausto Rossi scored the only goal of the game as he slammed home from close range after 17 minutes. Atletico Madrid took advantage of Barca's slip up to move top of the table thanks to their better head-to-head record against Real Madrid as a double from David Villa handed them a 2-0 win over Celta Vigo at Balaidos. However, Real can retake their place at the top and move four points clear of Barcelona with victory over Levante at home on Sunday. Victory for Valladolid had significant consequences at the other end of the table as La Pucela moved out of the relegation zone with just their fifth league win of the campaign. ""What we lacked today is normally what distinguishes the team; our circulation of the ball and our movement off the ball to find space. As a consequence of that we lacked penetration,"" Barca boss Gerardo Martino admitted. ""We lacked ideas, movement and penetration, but I didn't in any way see a lack of attitude."" Defeat means the Spanish champions will likely have to beat Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu in two weeks time to have any chance of retaining the title. And with his side's Champions League last 16, second leg with Manchester City just four days away, Martino admitted his side are a long way off their best form. ""It is clear that right now we are not in our best form and we need to be to be able to beat Real Madrid. There are still 15 days to go until that match for us to find ourselves. Right now we have the Champions League to worry about. ""Today we didn't play well, just like we didn't play well in the game straight after the Manchester City game, in San Sebastian (a defeat to Real Sociedad). We will try to make sure it is the reverse on Wednesday."" Despite the majority of his squad having been away on international duty in midweek, Martino named almost his strongest starting line-up with only Jordi Alba and Andres Iniesta missing out. However, after lionel Messi had forced goalkeeper Diego Marino into an early save at the end of a swift counter-attack, it was Valladolid who had the upper hand in the opening half hour. Rossi opened the scoring with his first goal for Valladolid as he took advantage of a ricochet off two Barca defenders inside the area to fire past Victor Valdes. Barca reacted as the first-half drew to a close and Marino had to be alive to deny Messi twice from range before Cesc Fabregas also tested the keeper with a drive from the edge of the box. Marino made another good save just three minutes after the restart as the Argentine squeezed a shot towards goal with his weaker right foot from a narrow angle. Barca's best opening dropped at the feet of Neymar as he was brilliantly played in by Fabregas, but he blasted over from close range. Atletico, meanwhile, recovered from their own travel sickness as they put two consecutive away league defeats behind them in Vigo. After a first-half short on clear-cut opportunities, Villa pounced on a defensive error from Jonathan Castro to fire low past Yoel Rodriguez just after the hour mark. The Spanish international then made the game safe barely two minutes later with another composed finish from Jose Sosa's cut-back for his 15th goal of the season."

Jorge Perez, secretary general of the Spanish Football Federation and Manuel Rubiales, president of AFE, also confirmed that Del Bosque will announce his squad for the match at AFE's headquarters on February 28. The plight of many Spanish footballers, especially in the lower leagues, gained international attention last week when players of Racing Santander refused to play the second leg of their Copa del Rey quarter-final against Real Sociedad having not been paid since September."
83,03/02/2014,02:06,Football: Ancellotti unhappy at Ronaldo red card,Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti accused Athletic Bilbao's Carlos Gurpegi of exaggerated theatrics in the action that led to Cristiano Ronaldo's sending off in a 1-1 draw on Sunday.,"The recently crowned Ballon d'Or winner was given his marching orders 15 minutes from time, with the score already at 1-1, for appearing to hit out at Gurpegi after having a penalty appeal turned down. The away draw leaves Real three points behind La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid, who moved to the top of the table with a 4-0 win over Real Sociedad earlier on Sunday. Ronaldo is now likely to be banned for another crucial league encounter against Villarreal next weekend and Ancelotti wasn't convinced his star man deserved to see red. ""I think it is difficult for me to judge because I wasn't there, but the images show that it was an exaggerated reaction,"" said the Italian. Brazilian defender Marcelo was stronger in his criticism of the decision. ""It is hard when you lose a player in an unjust manner. It is obvious that the decision wasn't fair and that made it very difficult, although our intention is to win every game,"" he told Spanish TV station Canal Plus. ""Athletic are a very good team, but we had bad luck today."" After withstanding some intense pressure from Athletic in the opening 45 minutes, Madrid looked set for an 11th consecutive victory in all competitions as Ronaldo's cross was turned home by Jese Rodriguez. However, a stunning strike from Ibai Gomez brought the hosts level before Ronaldo clashed with Gurpegi. Madrid then had Diego Lopez to thank for salvaging a point as the keeper tipped over another dipping effort from Gomez before denying Aritz Aduriz late on. ""The game was difficult for both teams,"" added Ancelotti. ""In the first-half Athletic pressed a lot and that made it difficult to play the ball on the ground so we played more on the counter-attack. ""In the second-half, the intensity of their pressure dropped a bit and we played better in possession, we scored and had good control of the game. ""Bilbao scored a fantastic goal, but in general I personally am satisfied with how Real Madrid played."" Following Barcelona's shock 3-2 defeat at home to Valencia on Saturday, Atletico took advantage of the Catalans slip up to become outright leaders for the first time since they won the league in 1996. On an emotional evening at the Vicente Calderon as former players and the paid homage to former Spain and Atletico player and manager Luis Aragones, who died on Saturday, David Villa settled the early nerves as he turned home the opener eight minutes form half-time. And after a spirited challenge from Sociedad after the break, three late goals from Diego Costa, Miranda and Diego Ribas propelled the hosts into top spot. Coach Diego Simeone, however, continued to deflect attention from Los Rojiblancos' chances of going all the way in the title race, preferring to concentrate instead on his side's meeting with Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.

84,03/02/2014,02:05,Football: Anvellotti unhappy at Ronaldo red card,Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti accused Athletic Bilbao's Carlos Gurpegi of exaggerated theatrics in the action that led to Cristiano Ronaldo's sending off in a 1-1 draw on Sunday.,"The recently crowned Ballon d'Or winner was given his marching orders 15 minutes from time, with the score already at 1-1, for appearing to hit out at Gurpegi after having a penalty appeal turned down. The away draw leaves Real three points behind La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid, who moved to the top of the table with a 4-0 win over Real Sociedad earlier on Sunday. Ronaldo is now likely to be banned for another crucial league encounter against Villarreal next weekend and Ancelotti wasn't convinced his star man deserved to see red. ""I think it is difficult for me to judge because I wasn't there, but the images show that it was an exaggerated reaction,"" said the Italian. Brazilian defender Marcelo was stronger in his criticism of the decision. ""It is hard when you lose a player in an unjust manner. It is obvious that the decision wasn't fair and that made it very difficult, although our intention is to win every game,"" he told Spanish TV station Canal Plus. ""Athletic are a very good team, but we had bad luck today."" After withstanding some intense pressure from Athletic in the opening 45 minutes, Madrid looked set for an 11th consecutive victory in all competitions as Ronaldo's cross was turned home by Jese Rodriguez. However, a stunning strike from Ibai Gomez brought the hosts level before Ronaldo clashed with Gurpegi. Madrid then had Diego Lopez to thank for salvaging a point as the keeper tipped over another dipping effort from Gomez before denying Aritz Aduriz late on. ""The game was difficult for both teams,"" added Ancelotti. ""In the first-half Athletic pressed a lot and that made it difficult to play the ball on the ground so we played more on the counter-attack. ""In the second-half, the intensity of their pressure dropped a bit and we played better in possession, we scored and had good control of the game. ""Bilbao scored a fantastic goal, but in general I personally am satisfied with how Real Madrid played."" Following Barcelona's shock 3-2 defeat at home to Valencia on Saturday, Atletico took advantage of the Catalans slip up to become outright leaders for the first time since they won the league in 1996. On an emotional evening at the Vicente Calderon as former players and the paid homage to former Spain and Atletico player and manager Luis Aragones, who died on Saturday, David Villa settled the early nerves as he turned home the opener eight minutes form half-time. And after a spirited challenge from Sociedad after the break, three late goals from Diego Costa, Miranda and Diego Ribas propelled the hosts into top spot. Coach Diego Simeone, however, continued to deflect attention from Los Rojiblancos' chances of going all the way in the title race, preferring to concentrate instead on his side's meeting with Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. ""The objective is clear: the next game. Now we have the Copa del Rey on Wednesday. ""We need to recover and see how far we can go. After that we need to keep recovering after every game because we are playing every three days. It will take a huge effort, but we will see how we deal with it."""

87,03/01/2014,02:15,"Football: Barca, Atletico jostle for position, Basque derby on cards","After a short winter break, Spain's top-flight clubs are back in action this weekend with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid jostling for position at the top of the table and a Basque derby also on the cards.","Reigning champions Barcelona and Diego Simeone's Atletico are level on points at the top and are due to face each other in a mouthwatering fixture in Madrid next weekend. Prior to that, though, Atletico go to Malaga on Saturday and Barcelona entertain Elche on Sunday before both sides have Copa del Rey ties to think about in midweek. Atletico, who have signed Argentine midfielder Jose Ernesto Sosa on loan from Metalist Kharkiv until the end of the season, will face a Malaga side who won their last two league games of 2013 to climb up into mid-table. Brazilian full-back Filipe Luis insists that the Rojiblancos are fully focused on their trip to La Rosaleda as they look to keep the pressure on Barcelona. ""Knowing the coach and the squad, nobody is thinking about the Barcelona game. Maybe the supporters are, but we all know that the Malaga match is vital,"" he said. ""We have not won there in two or three years and it is a difficult venue for us."" Both Atletico and Barca have enjoyed stunning starts to the campaign, winning 15 and drawing one of 17 games in La Liga, but the Catalans have not always performed convincingly since Gerardo Martino took over as coach in the summer. Nevertheless, the champions have been boosted by the return to the squad of goalkeeper Victor Valdes after injury, while Lionel Messi is also edging closer to a comeback. Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta is hoping a win against Elche - who sit just two points above the drop zone - can set his team up for a successful 2014. ""A good new year for us means winning everything"" said the man who scored Spain's World Cup-winning goal in 2010. ""When you have the chance to reach the top, you have to fight hard, and that's the kind of ambition that we hope will take us into April and May in contention. The team is playing well, and we need to grow from here."" Real Madrid, who sit third in the table, five points adrift of the top two, are in action on the Monday Three Kings Day holiday with a home fixture against Celta Vigo at the Santiago Bernabeu. The extra time to prepare for that game was used up playing in a glamour friendly against Paris Saint-Germain in Qatar on Thursday, which Carlo Ancelotti's team won 1-0 thanks to a first-half goal from young striker Jese. ""We are coming from behind but we have the whole second half of the season to come back and win the league,"" Ancelotti said. The first weekend of the New Year features the enticing prospect of a Basque derby between fifth-placed Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao at Anoeta. Athletic sit four points clear of their neighbours in the final Champions League qualifying position and have lost just one of their last 10 Liga games. Meanwhile, la Real, who finished fourth last season, have doubts over several players for the game, including the influential Xabi Prieto. That is not the only derby on the cards, with Valencia entertaining city rivals Levante at the Mestalla in what will be their first game since the appointment of Argentine-born former Barcelona and Spain striker Juan Antonio Pizzi as coach. Pizzi, who led San Lorenzo to the Argentine Torneo Inicial title last month, has replaced the sacked Miroslav Djukic in charge of Los Che, who sit level on points with Levante coming into their first game of 2014.

92,15/12/2013,23:00,Football: Costa double takes Atletico level with Barca,Atletico Madrid joined Barcelona at the top of La Liga as a double from Diego Costa guided them to a 3-0 win over Valencia on Sunday.,"After a disappointing first-half, Costa opened the scoring in style with a stunning individual effort 14 minutes after the restart. Just four minutes later substitute Raul Garcia rattled home a loose ball inside the area to seal the three points. Costa then saw a penalty saved by Diego Alves, but made no mistake when handed a second opportunity from the spot six minutes later to move level with Cristiano Ronaldo as La Liga's top scorer on 17. Both Atletico and Barca, on 43 points from 16 games, now have a five-point lead over Real Madrid after Los Blancos could only manage a 2-2 draw at Osasuna on Saturday. Atletico boss Diego Simeone made seven changes from the side that started in the 2-0 Champions League win over Porto in midweek as he resorted to his strongest available line-up. However, the hosts still found it hard going in the opening 45 minutes as Valencia controlled possession without posing a threat to Thibaut Courtois's goal. Atletico started the second period with far more urgency and after Tiago had turned Miranda's cross just wide, Costa ran half the length of the field before finishing low past Alves. Garcia then came on to replace David Villa and with virtually his first involvement in the game he made it 2-0 with an accurate drive into the far corner from inside the area. Costa's direct running was causing the Valencia defence all sorts of problems and he had the chance to make it three when he was pulled down by Victor Ruiz inside the area 15 minutes from time. But Alves dived to his right to turn away the resulting penalty -- the third time Costa has missed from the spot already this season. Costa wasn't to be denied a second time, though, as after he had been felled by Antonio Barragan, he blasted high past the helpless Alves. Earlier, Athletic Bilbao strengthened their position in fourth place with a 1-1 draw away to Sevilla. Alberto Moreno fired the hosts in front after four minutes only for Markel Susaeta to level two minutes later. Susaeta also saw a first-half penalty saved by Beto, but in the end Athletic were happy to settle for the point which moves them two clear of fifth-placed Villarreal. Real Sociedad moved to within four points of their Basque neighbours Athletic as they hammered bottom of the table Real Betis 5-1 at Anoeta. Imanol Agirretxe scored twice, whilst Antoine Griezmann, Ion Ansotegi and Xabi Prieto were also on target as Sociedad recorded their third straight league win. And Almeria moved out of the relegation zone with a 0-0 draw at home to Espanyol."

96,29/11/2013,02:10,Football: Beaten Barca looking for response in Bilbao,Midfielder Xavi Hernandez believes Barcelona have to recover the intensity in their play if they are to avoid a first league defeat of the season when they travel to Athletic Bilbao on Sunday.,"The Catalans were beaten for the first time in 21 games since Gerardo Martino took charge in July on Tuesday as they produced an insipid display in going down 2-1 to Ajax in Amsterdam in the Champions League. Defeat was the first sign that Barca could be missing the influence of the injured Lionel Messi and Victor Valdes, but Xavi insisted those that are available have to show the right attitude when they face Athletic. ""They are important players and you are going to miss them, but that wasn't the principal reason for the defeat. We didn't do enough to win. ""We need to have intensity from the start and in San Mames it will be another test. ""We need to turn it around and go for it from the off with that intensity that we lacked (against Ajax)."" Barca are likely to also be without full-backs Adriano, Jordi Alba and Dani Alves on Sunday, but Sergio Busquets and Alexis Sanchez will return after being rested in midweek. Athletic have had an impressive start to the campaign themselves as Monday's 2-1 win over Malaga moved them to within a point of Villarreal in the final Champions League spot. Ernesto Valverde's side are unbeaten at home since the opening of the new San Mames in September with four wins and two draws from six games at their new stadium. The visit of the league leaders will prove their biggest test to date, but striker Aritz Aduriz is hoping they can take advantage of Barca's series of injuries. ""They are very important players for them. We will see if we are capable of taking advantage of it, although the other players have all it takes to replace them,"" he told sports daily Marca. ""To me they seem just as good as always. Until now they have won almost every game. Their level is just as good if not better than in previous seasons."" Real Madrid have the chance to cut their gap to Barcelona to three points for 24 hours at least when they host Valladolid on Saturday. Carlo Ancelotti's men continued their free-scoring form with a 4-1 destruction of Galatasaray in the Champions League on Wednesday despite playing the majority of the match with just 10 men. Madrid have now scored 26 times in their last six games at home and in Europe and could be boosted by the return of Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese missed Wednesday's game due to a slight muscle strain, but Ancelotti confirmed that the player himself is confident he will be fit in time to face Valladolid. And even if La Liga's top scorer doesn't make it, Valladolid boss Juan Ignacio Martinez is aware of the daunting task facing his side. ""It is very difficult to get anything there because they are very good and, moreover, they have gained a lot since the return of Xabi Alonso,"" he said. ""We will try to compete well and hopefully remove the bad taste in our mouth we had after defeat in the last game against Osasuna."" Second-placed Atletico Madrid are also in action on Saturday away to Elche as they too can put the pressure on Barcelona by moving level on points with the Catalans.

99,09/11/2013,19:05,Football: Ronaldo fires hat-trick for five-star Madrid,Cristiano Ronaldo scored his third hat-trick of the season and Gareth Bale provided another assist as Real Madrid continued their impressive form with a 5-1 win over Real Sociedad on Saturday.,"Ronaldo opened the scoring from Karim Benzema's pass on 12 minutes before returning the favour for the Frenchman to slot home six minutes later. The Portuguese added the third from the penalty spot before Bale played in Sami Khedira to make it 4-0 after just 36 minutes. Antoine Griezmann restored some pride for the visitors with his sixth goal in his last three league games after the break. But Ronaldo rounded off the scoring with a sensational free-kick to take his tally for the season to 24 goals in just 17 games. Victory moves Real to within two points of neighbours Atletico Madrid and three of leaders Barcelona with the top two both in action on Sunday. ""We scored very quickly and so things went very well. The truth is that after going ahead 4-0, we relaxed a bit and played more slowly in the second-half,"" Ronaldo told Gol TV. ""Overall, I am satisfied with the way we played, although we are not yet at 100 percent, we keep winning."" Another stunning display from Ronaldo led to calls from the Bernabeu crowd for him to win the Ballon d'Or, but he insists he is not concerned by whether he is crowned the world's best player for a second time come January. ""I don't want to talk about the Ballon d'Or. I give my answers on the field. It is something that doesn't depend on me and, therefore, it doesn't bother me that much."" Ronaldo, Bale and Benzema started together up front for the fourth consecutive game after combining for 12 goals and eight assists in the previous three. And it didn't take the hosts long to get into their stride as Ronaldo fired a dipping long-range effort off the top of the crossbar after just eight minutes. The Portuguese did then open the scoring four minutes later when he controlled Benzema's clever low cross inside the area before smashing the ball past the helpless Claudio Bravo. And Ronaldo turned provider moments later as his cut-back from the by-line picked out Benzema inside the box and he stroked home his eighth goal of the season. It was 3-0 before the half-hour mark as Markel Bergara was harshly penalised for handling Ronaldo's fiercely struck effort and the former Manchester United man stepped up to double his tally for the afternoon. Bale then passed up his first big opportunity when he side-footed wide after being played in by the impressive Luka Modric. However, the Welshman made amends nine minutes before the break when he provided his fifth assist in four games by playing in Khedira to fire home from the edge of the area. With the game already won, Real's intensity dropped a little after the interval and Griezmann thought he should have won a penalty on the hour mark as he looked to have been clipped as he rounded Diego Lopez. Just 60 seconds later, though, the Frenchman did notch a consolation with a lovely chipped finish over Lopez from Carlos Vela's pass. Griezmann could even have had a second moments later when he prodded just wide of the far post. Typically, however, Ronaldo was to have the final say as he rattled home a wonderful 25-yard free-kick 14 minutes from time to seal his 23rd hat-trick for Madrid."

Villa then made the game safe with a quickfire brace just after half-time. La Liga's top-scorer Diego Costa took his tally to 13 goals in 13 games in all competitions when he slotted home from Villa's pass 25 minutes from time before Gabi rounded off the scoring in stoppage time. Torres had been handed a start in place of the injured Arda Turan and the Spanish Under-21 international was in the right place at the right time as he slotted home at the back post from Koke's cut-back. Atletico boss Diego Simeone was happy with the impact that Torres made not only with his goal, but his overall display. ""I could see that the team needed the characteristics that Oliver has. ""He was ready to play and he responded brilliantly today. I expect a lot of him, but he is young and still learning."" Costa ought to have scored twice before half-time as he firstly slotted wide when clean through on goal and was then denied by Betis keeper Guillermo Sara who stood up well to turn his effort behind for a corner. Sara had to be replaced by Stephan Andersen at half-time due to an injury, but the Dane's first job was to pick the ball out of the net as Villa neatly flicked home Costa's cross at the near post eight minutes after the restart. And three minutes later Villa smashed home his fifth goal of the season after Koke's pass towards Torres deflected fortunately into his path. ""In the second-half we found Villa in the areas where he lives, in the box,"" Simeone added. ""It is normal for a player of his standing to need to score. We need the best version of Villa and today we saw a glimpse of that."" Costa finally got the goal he craved when Villa's lovely through ball allowed him to plant a left-footed finish into the far corner. He was then withdrawn with one eye on the upcoming league matches against Granada and Athletic Bilbao in mind, but Atletico still had one more goal in them when Gabi fired low into the corner with the last kick of the game. Villarreal strengthened their hold on fourth spot with a 4-1 thrashing of Valencia at the Madrigal. Early goals from Ikechukwu Uche and Hernan Perez put the hosts 2-0 up at half-time before a Giovanni Dos Santos double completed the rout after the break. Real Sociedad continued their recovery with a 3-0 win over the still winless Almeria to move up to ninth. Sevilla also moved into the top half of the table with a 2-1 win over 10-man Osasuna."

And the bad news was confirmed by the club on Wednesday with the 26-year-old set to undergo surgery. ""The scans carried out this morning found a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament and a meniscus injury in his right knee,"" said a statement on Sociedad's website. ""The treatment of this injury will need surgical intervention."" Granero only joined the Basques last month on-loan from English Championship side Queen's Park Rangers. However, the former Real Madrid man did play a key role in helping Sociedad qualify for the Champions League for the first time in a decade via the playoffs as they cruised past French side Lyon 4-0 on aggregate."

108,13/09/2013,02:10,Football: Villarreal out to upset Bale's bow with Real,"After a prolonged transfer saga that reportedly made him the world's most expensive player, Gareth Bale could finally make his debut for Real Madrid on Saturday when Los Blancos travel to Villarreal.","Bale's move from Tottenham Hotspur finally went through on September 1, but due to the international break the 24-year-old has had to wait another two weeks for the opportunity to dawn the famous white shirt for the first time. The break did however give Bale some valuable time on the field to regain match sharpness as he played the final half hour of Wales' 3-0 defeat to Serbia on Tuesday in what was his first game since mid-July. It is not expected that coach Carlo Ancelotti will start his new star at El Madrigal, but Bale is hoping to be involved at some point. ""I have had two good training sessions and I am improving. I hope to be up to speed as soon as possible,"" he said at a promotional event on Thursday. And should Bale be involved there has been much conjecture as to where he will fit into Madrid's system with Cristiano Ronaldo occupying his preferred spot on the left side of the attack. ""I will play in the position that the coach tells me and I will give 100 percent for the team. I hope that my integration into the team will be good and that you'll be able to see that on the pitch."" Ancelotti is expected to have Ronaldo and Isco available as they trained on Thursday after picking up slight injuries whilst on international duty. However, the Italian has a problem at left-back with both Marcelo and Fabio Coentrao out injured so Nacho, who won his first Spanish cap on Tuesday, could be handed a start in an unfamiliar position. After a somewhat unconvincing start to the campaign despite winning all three of their games so far, Madrid will be in for a real test against a Villarreal side who have also made a 100 percent start to the season on their return to the top flight. ""Last year we dreamt about playing against these teams and now this opportunity has arrived we want to play a great game,"" Villarreal midfielder Bruno told the club's website. ""We know that it is a difficult match against a very hard opponent that nobody thinks will be easy, but this doesn't mean that we don't believe we can win and we will have our opportunities."" The other two sides with nine points from three games, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, are also in action on Saturday as they host Sevilla and Almeria respectively. A revamped Sevilla side have only taken two points from their three games so far, but Barca full-back Adriano is not expecting an easy game against his old side. ""The teams that (Unai) Emery coaches always make things difficult for us, whether it be at home or away,"" he told the Barcelona website. ""They will try to shut up shop and it won't be different to the kind of games we have played many times."" Sergio Busquets will be available for the Catalans as he has recovered from the thigh injury that kept him out of Spain's World Cup qualifier with Finland last week so club captain Carles Puyol remains the only absentee from Gerardo Martino's squad through injury. Barcelona, Madrid and Atletico are all looking for positive results ahead of their opening Champions League group-stage games next midweek. Meanwhile, Spain's other Champions League representatives, Real Sociedad, also play on Saturday, away to Levante."

""He is developing well,"" Martino told a press conference on Saturday. ""It is just a precaution. We are optimistic, but it is just three days since the injury occurred and it would be risky to play him, especially so early in the season."" Messi's absence should mean a start for Cesc Fabregas in the false nine role he often occupies for Spain. However, Martino was tight-lipped on whether or not Neymar would be handed his first start for the club after coming off the bench to net his first Barca goal on Wednesday. ""Just because Messi isn't there doesn't mean Neymar has to take the reigns,"" said the coach. ""Neymar is improving all the time, but we need to take things bit by bit to ensure everything goes well in the end. My intention is that when he plays he is able to show all that he can do."" Real Madrid meanwhile aren't in action until Monday night when they travel to face Granada. However, it is looking increasingly unlikely that they will travel to Andalusia with Bale amongst their ranks as there was still no confirmation of his move from Spurs on Saturday. Spanish media reported that the 24-year-old had already arrived in Spain and is waiting in Marbella for the world record deal to be completed before flying to Madrid to be presented to the fans and the media in the coming days. Real will be without Xabi Alonso for up to three months after he broke a bone in his foot earlier this week and minor injuries to Sami Khedira and Asier Illarramendi mean manager Carlo Ancelotti's midfield options are limited. Meanwhile the Italian also has to decide whether to stick with Diego Lopez in goal or recall club captain Iker Casillas after he was surprisingly benched for Real's 2-1 win over Real Betis last weekend. In the night's action on the field, Real Sociedad failed to make it three wins in a week as they were held 1-1 by promoted Elche. The Basques took a huge step towards qualifying for the Champions League group stages for the first time in a decade in midweek as they won 2-0 away to Lyon. However, they were on the back foot straight away in Alicante as Ferran Coro scored the hosts first goal in the top-flight for 24 years. Sociedad improved mightily after the break though and were deservedly level 16 minutes from time when Carlos Vela turned home Xabi Prieto's cross. Espanyol moved alongside Sociedad on four points after two games as they came from behind to beat Valencia 3-1. Helder Postiga scored his first goal for Valencia against the run of play after just 10 minutes. However, David Lopez's equaliser ensured Javi Aguirre's men went in level at half-time and second-half goals from Cristian Stuani and Thievy Bifouma rounded off a fine victory for the Catalans."

""Just because Messi isn't there doesn't mean Neymar has to take the reigns,"" said the coach. ""Neymar is improving all the time, but we need to take things bit by bit to ensure everything goes well in the end. My intention is that when he plays he is able to show all that he can do."" Real Madrid meanwhile aren't in action until Monday night when they travel to face Granada. However, it is looking increasingly unlikely that they will travel to Andalusia with Bale amongst their ranks as there was still no confirmation of his move from Spurs on Saturday. Spanish media reported that the 24-year-old had already arrived in Spain and is waiting in Marbella for the world record deal to be completed before flying to Madrid to be presented to the fans and the media in the coming days. Real will be without Xabi Alonso for up to three months after he broke a bone in his foot earlier this week and minor injuries to Sami Khedira and Asier Illarramendi mean manager Carlo Ancelotti's midfield options are limited. Meanwhile the Italian also has to decide whether to stick with Diego Lopez in goal or recall club captain Iker Casillas after he was surprisingly benched for Real's 2-1 win over Real Betis last weekend. In the night's action on the field, Real Sociedad failed to make it three wins in a week as they were held 1-1 by promoted Elche. The Basques took a huge step towards qualifying for the Champions League group stages for the first time in a decade in midweek as they won 2-0 away to Lyon. However, they were on the back foot straight away in Alicante as Ferran Coro scored the hosts first goal in the top-flight for 24 years. Sociedad improved mightily after the break though and were deservedly level 16 minutes from time when Carlos Vela turned home Xabi Prieto's cross. Espanyol moved alongside Sociedad on four points after two games as they came from behind to beat Valencia 3-1. Helder Postiga scored his first goal for Valencia against the run of play after just 10 minutes. However, David Lopez's equaliser ensured Javi Aguirre's men went in level at half-time and second-half goals from Cristian Stuani and Thievy Bifouma rounded off a fine victory for the Catalans."
112,16/08/2013,02:10,Football: Martino bringing back Barca intensity - Xavi,"Barcelona midfielder Xavi Hernandez believes his side will rekindle their intensity and pressing under the tutelage of new manager Gerardo ""Tata"" Martino.","The Argentine was appointed less than four weeks before Barca kick off the defence of their league title against Levante on Sunday, after Tito Vilanova had to resign due to on-going health problems. However, Xavi believes the squad are adjusting well to Martino's methods and has backed the new coach to be a success despite his lack of managerial experience in Europe. ""He is a leader, capable, prepared and has experience,"" the 33-year-old told Barcelona sports daily Sport. ""He is transmitting a lot to us. We are recovering a little of the intensity and rhythm that perhaps we lost for various reasons towards the end of last season. We are pressing very well and working well physically. ""He is adding things that he is influencing a lot. For example, on set-pieces we are working differently. We are adjusting and he is a guy that is very clear about what he wants."" Martino's insistence on pressing high up the field was very evident in his only game at the Camp Nou so far as Barca destroyed Santos 8-0 in a friendly that formed part of the deal to bring Neymar to the Spanish champions. The Brazilian international will also make his competitive Barcelona debut against Levante, but World Player of the Year Lionel Messi is a doubt as he continues to recover from the quadriceps injury that forced him to miss Argentina's friendly with Italy on Wednesday. Captain Carles Puyol will definitely be absent for the Catalans after he underwent knee surgery to remove a cyst last month, but Cesc Fabregas and Pedro Rodriguez should be fit to play despite missing Spain's friendly with Ecuador in midweek due to minor injuries. Real Madrid also get their league campaign underway on Sunday with a new man in charge as Carlo Ancelotti makes his bow at the Santiago Bernabeu where Real Betis are the visitors. Los Blancos have enjoyed a superb pre-season that encompassed victories over Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Inter Milan and Ancelotti will have a wealth of midfield options to choose from following the capture of Isco and Asier Illarramendi from Malaga and Real Sociedad respectively. Arguably the most enticing fixture of the opening weekend though comes at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan where a new-look Sevilla side host Atletico Madrid. Atletico enjoyed a fantastic campaign last season as they finished third and won the Copa del Rey. As a result they will face Barcelona in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup next week and have Champions League football to look forward to. However, coach Diego Simeone has insisted it is important that his team maintain the consistency they showed in the league last season, starting on Sunday. ""We need to continue in the same way, looking for the consistency we had last season. Therefore, we can't look beyond the present and that is Sevilla,"" he told the club's website. ""We need to start again at zero and not get away from going game by game. We have had a good pre-season, especially physically, and we have been competitive."" New signings David Villa and Leo Baptistao are likely to be involved for Atleti as they try to compensate for the loss of Radamel Falcao, who joined Monaco back in June. However, the transfer activity at Atleti hasn't compared to that at Sevilla and coach Unai Emery could hand debuts to as many as 10 new recruits as the Andalusians have rebuilt following the departures of Jesus Navas, Alvaro Negredo and Gary Medel."
113,12/08/2013,02:32,Football: La Liga transfers - six to watch,Six key signings to look out for as the new La Liga season gets underway on Saturday:,"NEYMAR (Barcelona) By a distance the most discussed transfer in Spanish football this close season was Neymar's 57 million euro ($74m, £48.7m) move from Santos to Barcelona. The 21-year-old had long been linked with a move to the Spanish champions, but Barca's 7-0 two-leg humiliation at the hands of Bayern Munich in last season's Champions League semi-final accelerated the Catalans push for an extra option in attack. How Neymar combines with World Player of the Year Lionel Messi remains to be seen, but as he showed in a starring role at the Confederations Cup in June, the Brazilian international has the pace, skill and finishing ability to give Barca the reliable scoring outlet apart from Messi that they have lacked in recent seasons. ISCO (Real Madrid) Somewhat scorned by Barcelona's dominance of the Spanish national team in recent times, Real Madrid have invested heavily in two of the squad that helped Spain retain their Under-21 European Championship title in June. Isco was the first to arrive for a reported fee of 30 million euros after leading Malaga to the quarter-finals of the Champions League last season on their first participation in the competition. However, whilst the 22-year-old has shone brightly in pre-season, he may find first-team opportunities in his preferred play-making role behind a main striker limited at the Bernabeu due to the presence of German international Mesut Ozil. ASIER ILLARRAMENDI (Real Madrid) Having secured Isco, Madrid then spent 38.9 million euros to activate Illarramendi's release clause from Real Sociedad in a move intended to see the 23-year-old eventually succeed the ageing Xabi Alonso. Like Alonso, Illarramendi has a fine range of passing and is most effective playing just in front of the back four. And whilst the incredible wealth of midfield options available to new Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti may make it difficult for Illarramendi to claim a place in the side straight away, he will see plenty of minutes as Alonso is rested for the more straightforward league games later in the season. DAVID VILLA (Atletico Madrid) As soon as Neymar's move to Barcelona was confirmed it seemed inevitable that Villa would be on his way out of the Camp Nou and Atletico have arguably done the best business of the transfer window by snapping up Spain's all-time record goalscorer for an initial fee of just 2.1 million euros. Diego Simeone's side were in the market for a striker having sold Radamel Falcao to big-spending Monaco and it is hoped that a regular place in the side and playing as a central striker as opposed to the wide position he occupied at Barcelona will see Villa recover his golden touch in front of goal. Until breaking his tibia midway through the 2011-12 season, the 31-year-old had scored at least 20 league goals for 10 straight seasons and should he repeat that figure, Atletico will be well-compensated for the loss of Falcao who scored 70 goals in his two seasons in the Spanish capital. BENAT ETXEBARRIA (Athletic Bilbao) With so little money being spent by those outside the big two, the most significant transfer between two Spanish clubs not involving Madrid or Barca was Benat's return to Athletic Bilbao from Real Betis for eight million euros. The Basques were still flush with cash from the sale of Javi Martinez to Bayern Munich for 40 million euros last year and struggled mightily last season having failed to replace the Spanish international. Whilst Benat offers a lot more flair and less power than Martinez, he should make an excellent signing for Athletic with the service he provides allowing Ander Herrera, Oscar de Marcos and Iker Muniain to recover the form they showed in the 2011/12 season when Athletic reached both the Copa del Rey and Europa League finals. Benat's excellent delivery from set-piece situations will also be a handy asset as with the likes of Mikel San Jose, Kike Sola and Aritz Aduriz in their ranks, Ernesto Valderde's men will be extremely dangerous from corners and free-kicks. KEVIN GAMEIRO (Sevilla) The biggest transfer fee paid by a club outside the big two was Sevilla's capture of Gameiro from Paris Saint-Germain for a reported 10 million euros. A former French international, Gameiro had seen his playing time with the French champions severely limited by the signing of Zlatan Ibrahimovic last season but could be given a new lease of life in a very new-look Sevilla side. Spanish internationals Alvaro Negredo and Jesus Navas have both gone to Manchester City, but Gameiro should still be able to rely on decent service from Ivan Rakitic and Piotr Trochowski as he returns from nearly a year out through injury."

115,12/08/2013,02:30,"Football: Gap widens as Barca, Real spend and rest sell","Looking at the Spanish sports pages over the typically baking summer months, it would appear the Spanish game was in rude health both on and off the pitch.","In Catalonia, Neymar has dominated attention after his 57 million euro ($74 million, £48.7 million) move from Santos to Barcelona was confirmed in June, whilst, in the capital, Real Madrid backed up their 69 million euro investment in the young Spanish duo of Isco and Asier Illarramendi with an on-going pursuit of the 100 million euro rated Gareth Bale in a saga that looks set to run well into the final days of the transfer window. But beneath the big two, the game in Spain has continued to reflect the general ailing Spanish economy with even clubs in the Champions League forced to sell their best players. As a result, the already colossal gap between Real and Barca and the rest continues to increase as do fears that by continuing to use an unbalanced TV deal that greatly favours the big two, La Liga descends further into a turgid two-horse race. However, whilst both Barca and Real have been active in the transfer market, there are concerns that both have so far failed to bring in the type of players they really needed after falling at the semi-final stage of the Champions League last season. Neymar's arrival should certainly ease the scoring burden that Lionel Messi has carried almost single-handedly for the past two seasons, but the Catalans still look very threadbare at the back with captain Carles Puyol having undergone two operations during the close season and not due back till at least September. Real meanwhile have bolstered an already strong midfield, but haven't so far replaced Gonzalo Higuain after he joined Napoli last month leaving only Karim Benzema and youngster Alvaro Morata to fill the lone striker's position. There is though already a great deal more calm around Los Blancos following the departure of Jose Mourinho with the management team of Carlo Ancelotti and Zinedine Zidane highly-respected by the squad and the players themselves coming together as a unit following the public clashes and fallouts that marked the Portuguese's final season at the Bernabeu. That greater unity should mean Real push Barca a great deal closer than they did last season, but the title will again be defined by small margins. Such is their dominance that firstly Real and then Barca amassed 100 points in winning the title in the past two seasons and with the gap only set to widen between them and the rest, it is highly likely whoever becomes champions will need to register a century of points once more. In the battle for Champions League places, Atletico Madrid seem the best set despite losing star man Radamel Falcao to Monaco. Atletico have arguably done the best business in terms of value for money as they replaced the 60 million euro Colombian with David Villa for an inital fee of just 2.1 million euros. Continuing an uncharacteristic period of stability since Diego Simeone took charge of the club in December 2011, Atletico are only the only club to finish in the top six last season that haven't changed manager over the close season and they are heavy favourites to be the best of the rest once more. Further down, Valencia, Sevilla, Real Betis and Real Sociedad are all likely to be in the mix for the European places despite all losing key players in recent months. Valencia have replaced new Spurs signing Roberto Soldado with a former Spurs player, Helder Postiga, for a tenth of the price they sold Soldado, whilst Sevilla have also seen two Spanish internationals depart as Jesus Navas and Alvaro Negredo have joined Manchester City. However, they will still most likely battle it out for the final Champions League place as last season's surprise package Sociedad haven't invested heavily in their squad despite the 39 million euro windfall they received from Illarramendi's departure. Betis have lost their key creative lynchpin in Benat Extebarria after he rejoined Athletic Bilbao and the Basques themselves will be hoping for a far more successful campaign than their 12th-placed finish last season following the appointment of the highly-rated Ernesto Valverde as manager."
