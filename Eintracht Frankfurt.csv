0,13/02/2021,17:38,Haaland spares Dortmund blushes,A late equaliser from Erling Braut Haaland spared Borussia Dortmund's blushes on Saturday as they drew 2-2 at home against Bundesliga rivals Hoffenheim.,"Haaland's 81st minute strike averted a fourth defeat in five Bundesliga games for crisis-hit Dortmund. Yet even a draw leaves Dortmund three points adrift of the Champions League places in sixth, and heaps more pressure on interim coach Edin Terzic. Dortmund have won just four of ten league games since Terzic took the reins from Lucien Favre in December, prompting growing speculation over his future. Yet veteran defender Mats Hummels defended his coach on Saturday and backed Dortmund to revive their season. ""It's never the case that things are exactly how you want them a few weeks after a new coach takes over. That wasn't the case years ago under Jurgen Klopp, and it isn't the case now under Edin,"" Hummels told Sky. ""We're working hard, and success will come,"" he added. England international Jadon Sancho gave Dortmund a perfect start, racing up the left-wing to score his fourth league goal this season on 24 minutes. The lead didn't last long, as Munas Dabbur scuffed a shot past Marwin Hitz to level just seven minutes later. Ihlas Bebou bundled in Hoffenheim's second just after half-time, the ball bouncing off the Togolese and into the goal as Hitz tried to beat away a dangerous cross from the left wing. Haaland had a goal ruled out for offside in the second half before pouncing on a misplaced pass to snatch a crucial late equaliser. Fellow Champions League hopefuls Bayer Leverkusen also dropped points after they conceded two late goals to draw 2-2 with strugglers Mainz. Lucas Alario tapped in a low Moussa Diaby cross to give Leverkusen the lead on 14 minutes. Patrik Schick appeared to have sealed three points with a second on 84 minutes. Yet second-from-bottom Mainz were rewarded for a brave performance as late goals by Robert Glatzel and Kevin Stoeger saved a point and continued their recent revival under new coach Bo Svensson. Elsewhere, Werder Bremen were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Freiburg while Sami Khedira helped rescue a 1-1 draw for Hertha Berlin against boyhood club Stuttgart. ""It was the first time I'd ever played against Stuttgart so it was strange, but it was nice to come back,"" Khedira, who joined Hertha from Juventus in January after a decade abroad, told Sky. Austrian striker Sasa Kalajdzic headed in his ninth goal of the season to give Stuttgart the lead at the end of a scrappy first half. Veteran midfielder Khedira came off the bench in the second-half and set up a late equaliser for 17-year-old Luca Netz to save the capital club from a fifth straight defeat."
1,29/01/2021,03:03,Hoffenheim plot new Bayern shock on Munich return,"As the architect of Bayern Munich's single defeat in 2020, Hoffenheim coach Sebastian Hoeness hopes to again down the European champions in the Bundesliga on Saturday when he returns to his former club.","Bayern host mid-table Hoffenheim at the Allianz Arena seeking revenge for September's 4-1 league defeat - their only loss of 2020 in any competition. The shock win over the European champions ""will certainly still be in our heads,"" admitted Hoeness, ""but we want to use this game to annoy Bayern again"". Bayern hold a seven-point lead in the table and are near full-strength with only Corentin Tolisso and Tanguy Nianzou sidelined. After poor results around Christmas, Hoffenheim are back up to 11th thanks to back-to-back 3-0 wins against strugglers Hertha Berlin and Cologne. However, the European champions are a huge test for Hoffenheim on Hoeness' return to Munich, where the 38-year-old coached the reserves last season having previously worked with Bayern's junior teams. A key factor Saturday is the form of Hoffenheim striker Andrej Kramaric, who has scored twice in each of his last two games. Leading the pack chasing Bayern, RB Leipzig host Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday night with both clubs eager to bounce back from defeats. After crashing 3-2 at second-from-bottom Mainz, Leipzig coach Julian Nagelsmann compared Bayern to Germany's high-speed ICE trains and his team to a regional train, struggling to ""catch up"". In order to get back on track, Leipzig must beat third-placed Leverkusen, who trail them by three points. ""The game has no direct influence on the title race - it's all about qualifying for the Champions League,"" Nagelsmann insisted Thursday. Leipzig welcome back Yussuf Poulsen after a groin injury, but playmaker Emil Forsberg is sidelined by a knee knock. Leverkusen, who crashed at home to Wolfsburg last weekend, are missing midfielders Julian Baumgartlinger, who underwent knee surgery on Monday, and Nadiem Amiri, who is quarantined after testing positive for Covid-19. Having slipped out of the European places to seventh, Dortmund host Augsburg on Saturday chasing a first win in four games. ""We have to correct mistakes from set-pieces,"" said caretaker coach Edin Terzic after Dortmund conceded three goals from deadball situations in a 4-2 defeat at Gladbach. Erling Braut Haaland scored twice in the Gladbach defeat, but Dortmund need him and England winger Jadon Sancho to fire their attack. ""When they (Augsburg) make mistakes, we have to be there - ice-cold,"" added Terzic. Eintracht Frankfurt, who are a point above Dortmund in the table and bouyed by a 5-1 thrashing of Bielefeld, are home on Saturday to Hertha Berlin, where Pal Dardai is back in charge. The 44-year-old replaces Bruno Labbadia, who was sacked following their 4-1 thrashing at home by Werder Bremen. Frankfurt striker Luka Jovic has scored three goals in three appearances off the bench since returning on loan from Real Madrid. Dardai predicts it could be ""5-4 or 6-5"" at Frankfurt, who ""score a lot of goals.... we're going there to score one more"". The Croatia striker scored twice in last September's 4-1 win over Bayern and has also netted two goals in Hoffenheim's recent wins against Hertha and Cologne. He is back in form after contracting Covid-19 on international duty last October which sidelined him for seven games. Kramaric will test Bayern's defence and his four goals in two games, ""speak for themselves,"" said Hoffenheim coach Hoeness. 76 - the minutes Luka Jovic has needed for three goals off the bench having been loaned back to Eintracht Frankfurt after failing to settle at Real. 18 - home league games since Bayern last lost at the Allianz Arena when Leverkusen managed a 2-1 win in November 2019. 1 - the single victory Hoffenheim has managed at the Allianz Arena, poaching a 2-1 win in Munich in October 2019. Fixtures (all times 1430GMT unless stated)"
2,17/01/2021,20:25,'Like a Hollywood film': Jovic nets twice for Frankfurt on return from Real Madrid,Real Madrid loanee Luka Jovic came off the bench to score twice in his first game back at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday to seal their 3-1 win over bottom side Schalke in the Bundesliga.,"""It's like a script from a Hollywood film. The air in Frankfurt clearly does him good,"" said Frankfurt director Fredi Bobic. ""We decided before the game that he would get 30 minutes today."" The 23-year-old Serbia striker, who joined Real in June 2019 in a transfer worth around 60 million euros ($72 million), has been loaned back to Frankfurt for the rest of the season. Despite netting just twice in 32 appearances for Real, Jovic came on for the final half an hour in Frankfurt and needed just ten minutes for his first goal. It was his first game for two months after contracting Covid-19 in November, then picking up an injury, but he struck again just before the final whistle in Frankfurt. Portugal striker Andre Silva gave Frankfurt the lead before US teenager Matthew Hoppe, who last weekend became the first American to score a Bundesliga hat-trick, equalised for Schalke. However, the Royal Blues are again last in the table because of Mainz's 1-1 draw at Dortmund on Saturday."
3,14/01/2021,16:27,Real Madrid's Jovic returns to Frankfurt on loan,"Real Madrid striker Luka Jovic will return to his former club Eintracht Frankfurt on loan until the end of the season, the clubs announced on Thursday.","""Real Madrid and Eintracht Frankfurt have agreed on the loan of player Luka Jovic until the end of the current season,"" Madrid confirmed in a statement. Jovic joined Real Madrid for 60 million euros in the summer of 2019 but scored only two goals last season and the Serbian is yet to register this term. ""It has not been easy in Madrid for Luka recently. For him, it is important to come back to refocus. His great desire was to return to Eintracht,"" said Frankfurt's sporting director Fredi Bobic. Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has given Jovic only two La Liga starts this season. ""He is a striker who scores goals, it is what we want from him,"" Zidane said on Wednesday. ""He hasn't had any luck because he had difficulty adapting, with injuries, it's not easy. What he has to do is learn a lot of things. I have no doubt about his quality."""
4,02/01/2021,23:20,Olmo fires RB Leipzig top of Bundesliga ahead of Bayern Munich,RB Leipzig dislodged Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table Saturday as Dani Olmo's second-half goal was enough to seal a 1-0 win at Stuttgart.,"""It was really good for me and the team to start the year with a win,"" Olmo told DAZN. With European champions Bayern at home to strugglers Mainz on Sunday, Leipzig took the chance to go a point ahead as Olmo fired through the legs of Stuttgart goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. Stuttgart's Swiss shot-stopper had earlier pulled off some heroics by using his foot to save a Emil Forsberg first-half penalty attempt. Leipzig also wasted a golden chance when Amadou Haidara fired wide just after the break. With 23 minutes left, Spain midfielder Olmo finally got the breakthrough, finishing a move he started after Leipzig had moved the ball across the Stuttgart penalty area. ""It feels good to be top,"" admitted Leipzig defender Willi Orban. ""The first half was good, the second was better - we were clearly the dominant team."" Earlier, Bayer Leverkusen blew the chance to take first place after stumbling to a 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt which saw them drop to third as the league resumed after a two-week break. ""I have made my feelings clear in the dressing room,"" Leverkusen head coach Peter Bosz told Sky. ""We deserved to lose. Frankfurt had a better claim to the victory."" Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri scored with a deft back-heel flick to give the visitors the lead after only 10 minutes in Frankfurt. However, Amin Younes equalised to make it 1-1 at half-time before Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada put in a cross which Leverkusen defender Edmond Tapsoba turned into his own net. Before kickoff, Frankfurt director Fredi Bobic confirmed reports his club are interested in Bayern's teenage striker Joshua Zirkzee, 19, after selling Dutch forward Bas Dost to Brugge. Zirkzee could back up Frankfurt's top scorer Andre Silva, who has notched nine league goals this season. Union Berlin rose to fourth - into the Champions League places for the first time in the club's history - after their 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. Liverpool loanee Taiwo Awoniyi, who has scored in his last three league games, capped another impressive display with a goal and assist. After Bremen lost the ball in their own half, the 23-year-old Nigeria international took advantage of a two-on-two situation by drawing the defence and passing to Sheraldo Becker, who fired home on 12 minutes. Awoniyi doubled Union's lead on 28 minutes by tapping the ball over the line, just out of the reach of Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka. Bremen had a penalty appeal turned down when a shot by Japan midfielder Yuya Osako clipped the hand of a Union defender, then Romano Schmid had a goal ruled offside. Hoffenheim lost both defender Kevin Akpoguma and Germany midfielder Sebastian Rudy with early leg injuries as they crashed to a 3-1 home defeat to Freiburg. With the hosts struggling to reshuffle, Freiburg were 3-0 up at half-time thanks to a Baptiste Santamaria goal, a Vincenzo Grifo penalty and an own goal by Senegal defender Kasim Adams. Hoffenheim scored a second-half consolation goal through Togo winger Ihlas Bebou. Borussia Moenchengeladbach, who host Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League last 16 next month, earned their first win in five league games with a 1-0 victory at Arminia Bielefeld. Swiss striker Breel Embolo netted the winning goal just after half-time when he held off a defender and fired home. Mid-table Augsburg rebounded after back-to-back defeats with a 1-0 win at Cologne with Brazilian winger Iago netting the late winner. Bottom side Schalke are now 30 games without a win -- one short of the Bundesliga record -- after a 3-0 defeat away to Hertha Berlin. Former Tottenham manager Christian Gross, installed as Schalke's fourth head coach this season, got off to a losing start as Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi, Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba and his replacement, Poland forward Krzysztof Piatek, scored for Hertha. Having netted two minutes after coming off the bench, Piatek had a second late goal ruled offside."
5,15/12/2020,20:54,Gladbach snatch late draw as Stindl claims hat-trick,Borussia Moenchengladbach captain Lars Stindl claimed a hat-trick with an equaliser in the fifth minute of added time to snatch a Bundesliga point in Tuesday's 3-3 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt.,"Stindl's late heroics saved a point at Frankfurt, but Gladbach, who have drawn Manchester City in the last 16 of the Champions League, are winless in their last five games in all competitions. After Stindl opened the scoring by curling in a14th minute free-kick, Frankfurt roared back with three unanswered goals including two by Portugal striker Andre Silva. Leading 3-1, Frankfurt played the last 10 minutes with ten men after captain David Abraham was sent off for a second booking. With 90 minutes almost up, Gladbach won a penalty and Stindl stepped up to convert. Then he netted a last-gasp header to seal the draw. The point leaves Gladbach seventh in the table, seven points behind leaders Bayer Leverkusen, who are at Cologne on Wednesday. Eintracht goalkeeper Kevin Trapp suffered a heavy blow to the head early on after colliding with his own defender. Moments later, Gladbach went ahead when Stindl's superb free-kick went over the wall and outside Trapp's out-stretched glove. Frankfurt responded by pressuring Gladbach, whose defender Stefan Lainer conceded a penalty when he blocked a shot with his hand. Silva converted on 22 minutes. He added a second two minutes later when midfielder Aymen Barkok floated the ball over the defence which Silva brought down with a great first touch and fired past goalkeeper Yann Sommer. Silva then turned provider when he laid the ball off for Barkok who beat two defenders and coolly rolled the ball home on 32 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Frankfurt had a penalty awarded, then changed to a free kick by the VAR, when Denis Zakaria tripped Eintracht's Dominik Kohr on the edge of the area. After Abraham was sent off, Gladbach kept pushing and were rewarded as Stindl brought his side level with two late goals."
6,05/12/2020,17:34,Dortmund drop more points with draw at Frankfurt,"With their star striker Erling Braut Haaland sidelined by injury, Borussia Dortmund dropped more Bundesliga points on Saturday when they laboured to a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt.","The draw leaves Dortmund third in the league, three points behind leaders Bayern Munich who host second-placed RB Leipzig later Saturday night. After suffering a shock 2-1 home defeat last weekend against struggling Cologne, Dortmund missed the finishing of top scorer Haaland, who is out until January. Dortmund's defence was caught napping when they conceded an early goal by Frankfurt's Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada. The introduction of 16-year-old striker Youssoufa Moukoko after the half-time saw Dortmund raise their tempo. They equalised with a superb strike from 18-year-old US forward Giovanni Reyna, but failed to again breach the Frankfurt defence despite finishing the stronger."
7,04/12/2020,17:08,Dortmund defender Hummels shakes off ankle knock to face Eintracht,Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre said on Friday defender Mats Hummels has recovered from the ankle injury suffered in midweek quicker than expected and could feature in Saturday's Bundesliga trip to Eintracht Frankfurt.,"Dortmund are fourth in the Bundesliga, four points behind leaders Bayern Munich after last weekend's shock 2-1 defeat at home to Cologne. ""The news about Mats is good, we will have to see whether he can play,"" Favre said after the 2014 World Cup winner needed to be helped off in Wednesday's 1-1 home draw against Lazio in the Champions League. They want to bounce back with a first win at mid-table Frankfurt since 2013. Favre confirmed striker Erling Braut Haaland will not play again this year after tearing a leg muscle. The 20-year-old had posted on Instagram he had ""good news. I have spoken to my doctor and will be back soon"" but Favre put the brakes on hopes of a quick return. ""He is definitely out until January - which is what the doc said,"" Favre confirmed. Favre left open who will replace Haaland up front against Frankfurt after captain Marco Reus slotted in against Lazio. Youssoufa Moukoko - who last month became the youngest player in Bundesliga history aged 16 years, one day - could make his first start. However, ""we shouldn't forget that he is only just 16 - he is good, but we have other options,"" Favre added. The Swiss boss said Dortmund will be without defender Thomas Meunier and defensive midfielder Thomas Delaney who are both carrying injuries. However, winger Raphael Guerreiro and midfielder Emre Can could feature after regaining fitness. ""We gave points away against Cologne and we want to take them back,"" Favre added."
8,21/11/2020,23:11,Haaland scores four as Dortmund cut Bayern's lead,Erling Braut Haaland netted four goals and Youssoufa Moukoko became the youngest player in Bundesliga history on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund routed Hertha Berlin 5-2 to trim Bayern Munich's lead at the top of the table to just a point.,"It was the first time the 20-year-old Haaland had scored four goals in a game for Dortmund since his January debut, with all of them coming in the second half. ""I drank a Red Bull at half time, I got some wings and everything was good,"" said Haaland. The Norwegian now has 10 goals in seven Bundesliga matches this season to give him a total of 31 goals in 30 games in all competitions for Dortmund. After Matheus Cunha gave Hertha a first-half lead at Berlin's Olympic Stadium, Dortmund roared back. Haaland equalised when he tapped home an Emre Can pass on 47 minutes. He grabbed his second two minutes later with perfect timing to slip his marker and fire in a Julian Brandt pass. Haaland wrapped up his hat-trick on 62 minutes, just before Raphael Guerreiro stabbed the ball home from close range to make it 4-1. Cunha converted a late penalty, but the night belonged to Haaland who finished a move he started with 10 minutes to play. There was still time for history to be made as Moukoko made a late cameo off the Dortmund bench to replace Haaland. One day after his 16th birthday, Moukoko is the youngest player in Bundesliga history. ""He's only just turned 16 -- that is amazing,"" Haaland said of Moukoko. ""He has a big career ahead of him."" Dortmund's romp in Berlin moved them second in the standings, behind defending champions Bayern who stayed top despite a 1-1 home draw with Werder Bremen. Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer produced great stops to twice deny US forward Josh Sargent as Bremen earned their first point at Bayern for a decade. ""We had to invest a lot,"" Neuer told Sky. The 34-year-old bounced back after conceding six goals in Germany's crushing defeat by Spain in midweek with two brilliant first-half saves in quick succession. He used a boot to block a Sargent shot, then lunged across goal to save from Ludwig Augustinsson. In the dying stages, Neuer then stood tall to block a shot by Sargent, who had broken clear. Bayern coach Hansi Flick was far from pleased that Bremen took the lead in his 50th game in charge, saying his team ""have to defend better"". Bremen deservedly went ahead just before half-time when midfielder Maximilian Eggestein finished off a superb attack. ""We conceded a very cheap goal, that's how Bremen's plan worked and they defended very well,"" said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. Kingsley Coman equalised in the 62nd minute at the Allianz Arena by meeting a Leon Goretzka cross at the far post. Bayern forward Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting fired over with the goal at his mercy five minutes from time. However, Neuer's heroics at the other end preserved the draw. Bayer Leverkusen are third after their 2-1 win at strugglers Arminia Bielefeld thanks to Aleksandar Dragovic's late winner. The victory was a relief for Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky, who scored a embarrassing own goal early in the second half. Leverkusen were 1-0 up thanks to a Leon Bailey goal when Hradecky sliced a clearance, which rolled into the empty net behind him. Dragovic stabbed home from close range two minutes from time to spare Hradecky's blushes. RB Leipzig sit fourth after Yussuf Poulsen came off the bench and produced a deft second-half volley in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt after winger Aymen Barkok gave the hosts an early lead. Despite having seven players quarantined with the coronavirus, a depleted Hoffenheim drew 3-3 at home with Stuttgart. Schalke's winless run stretched to 24 league games, dating back to January, after losing 2-0 at home to Wolfsburg. A Daniel Caligiuri equaliser two minutes from time gave 10-man Augsburg a 1-1 draw at Borussia Moenchengladbach."
9,07/11/2020,18:33,"Leipzig go top in Germany ahead of Bayern, Dortmund showdown",RB Leipzig went back to the top of the Bundesliga table on Saturday with a 3-0 home win over Freiburg before Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund clash in the evening showdown.,"Defender Ibrahima Konate fired home Leipzig's opener before midfielder Marcel Sabitzer added their second goal with a 70th-minute penalty. Manchester City loanee Angelino claimed Leipzig's third with a stunning free-kick which curled over the Freiburg wall just before the final whistle. The home win put Leipzig top, a point ahead of Bayern and Dortmund who meet later at Signal Iduna Park. ""We really deserved the win - we were very, very good in the first-half,"" said Leipzig head coach Julian Nagelsmann. He was especially pleased with Konate's opening goal from a towering cross before winger Christopher Nkunku, who scored in the mid-week win over Paris Saint Germain, won the penalty which Sabitzer converted after the VAR scrutinised the decision. ""We have trained a lot from set pieces,"" said Nagelsmann. ""It certainly wasn't an obvious penalty, but if the VAR says it was, then it must have been,"" he added after Nkunku went down after the slightest of touches from Freiburg defender Nicolas Hoefler. Union Berlin climbed to fourth with a 5-0 home thrashing of strugglers Arminia Bielefeld. Former Germany striker Max Kruse helped set up Union's first three goals, then converted a late penalty. After just three minutes, Japan winger Keita Endo scored his first goal for Union when he swept home Sheraldo Becker's final pass after Kruse's superb long pass. Endo went off with an injury soon after, but Union kept up the pressure as Kruse set up the next two goals for centre-back Robert Andrich and winger Becker. Kruse, 32, capped an outstanding display by converting a penalty before Cedric Teuchert, a right wing replacement for Becker, grabbed Union's late fourth goal. At the other end of the table, bottom side Mainz were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Schalke, who sit one place above them and have now gone 23 games without a league win dating back to January. After Daniel Brosinski and Jean-Philippe Mateta converted penalties for Mainz, Mark Uth pulled a goal back for Schalke who were 2-1 down late on. Schalke took a deserved point back to Gelsenkirchen when Mainz defender Jeremiah St. Juste turned the ball into his own net eight minutes from time. After five games without a win, Hertha Berlin roared back with a 3-0 win in the fog at Augsburg. Forwards Matheus Cunha, Dodi Lukebakio and Krzysztof Piatek, who cost Hertha 24 million euros ($28 million) from AC Milan in January, got on the scoresheet as Augsburg's defence crumbled."
10,24/10/2020,19:03,Bayern teen star Alphonso Davies out for up to two months,Bayern Munich expect to be without rising star Alphonso Davies for up to eight weeks after he tore ankle ligaments early in Saturday's 5-0 rout of Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga.,"The teenager twisted his right ankle with barely a minute gone at the Allianz Arena. Davies was in clear distress as he was helped off and replaced at left-back by Lucas Hernandez as Robert Lewandowski netted a hat-trick in the rout. ""He has injured ligaments - one is torn, one is partially torn. We expect him to be out for six to eight weeks,"" said Bayern head coach Hansi Flick. ""If a player of this quality drops out, it hurts."" Davies broke into the Bayern first-team last season and made the left-back berth his own - keeping out Bayern's record-signing Hernandez - as they won the treble of Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup titles. However, Hernandez started ahead of Davies at left-back in last weekend's 4-1 romp at Bielefeld and Wednesday's 4-0 rout of Atletico Madrid in the Champions League. Last Tuesday, Flick said Davies had suffered a ""dip"" in form, but ""with his speed and dynamic, he is an important factor"" with Bayern facing a run of away games. Bayern have Champions League trips to Lokomotiv Moscow and Salzburg in the coming fortnight before playing Borussia Dortmund away in the Bundesliga on November 7."
11,24/10/2020,18:30,Lewandowski hits hat-trick as Bayern Munich rout Frankfurt,Robert Lewandowski took his Bundesliga tally to 10 goals in five games this season with a hat-trick as Bayern Munich thumped Eintracht Frankfurt 5-0 on Saturday.,"Lewandowski has scored nine goals in his last three league games and wrapped up his treble within an hour at the Allianz Arena. Defending champions Bayern have scored 22 goals this term -- 10 more than league leaders RB Leipzig who stayed top with a 2-1 win over 10-man Hertha Berlin. Bayern sit one point behind in second place. In Munich, Leroy Sane marked his return from injury with the fourth goal during a brief cameo, before England Under-17 midfielder Jamal Musiala also came off the bench to net the fifth. However, Bayern's victory could come at a price as Canadian left-back Alphonso Davies was in clear distress after going off early with an ankle injury. Lewandowski underlined his status as one of the world's best strikers last season by scoring a career-best 55 goals in 47 games, including 34 in the Bundesliga. The Polish international opened the scoring on 10 minutes when he fired home after a Thomas Mueller pass. Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp couldn't do anything to stop Lewandowski's header from a Joshua Kimmich corner in the 26th minute. Bayern had a penalty appeal turned down when Douglas Costa's cross clipped the hand of Frankfurt's Makoto Hasebe. Lewandowski wrapped up the victory on the hour mark with a clinical finish from another Costa cross. After sitting out the last two games, Sane ghosted past a defender and drove a shot into the bottom corner with 18 minutes to play. Manuel Neuer pulled off a great save to deny Frankfurt striker Bas Dost before Musiala grabbed the final goal as the visitors suffered their first league defeat of the season. Leipzig came from behind to seal a 2-1 win over Hertha, whose Colombian striker Jhon Cordoba scored in the eighth minute. Leipzig drew level when defender Dayot Upamecano fired home from a free-kick on 11 minutes, but Berlin were reduced to 10 men after the break when substitute Deyovaisio Zeefuik was shown two yellow cards within four minutes of coming on. Leipzig made the man advantage count when Marcel Sabitzer converted a penalty with 13 minutes left. Hertha were lucky not to finish with nine men when another sub, Jessic Ngankam, scythed down Leipzig left-back Angelino and the referee changed his decision to a yellow card having initially showed a straight red. Borussia Moenchengladbach warmed up for Tuesday's Champions League game at home to Real Madrid with a 3-2 comeback win at Mainz. Germany midfielder Lars Stindl gave Gladbach an early lead, but the visitors were 2-1 down at half-time after French striker Jean-Philippe Mateta scored twice for Mainz. Gladbach midfielder Jonas Hofmann converted a penalty on 76 minutes, after a shot by replacement Marcus Thuram was blocked by a Mainz hand before Matthias Ginter headed the winner as Gladbach climbed to fifth. Union Berlin were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Freiburg as Vincenzo Grifo's first-half goal was cancelled out two minutes later by Union midfielder Robert Andrich."
12,03/10/2020,17:58,Haaland nets twice as Dortmund run riot,Erling Braut Haaland again demonstrated his deadly finishing by netting twice on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund climbed to second in the Bundesliga table with a 4-0 demolition of Freiburg.,"Dortmund bounced back from last weekend's shock defeat at Augsburg as Haaland shone to leave him on 21 goals in 23 games for Dortmund since his January transfer as the burly Norwegian claimed clinically-taken goals. Having also scored in Wednesday's German Super Cup 3-2 defeat at Bayern Munich, the 20-year-old Haaland has netted five goals in as many games this season. Dortmund were missing England winger Jadon Sancho and goalkeeper Roman Buerki, both recovering from illness having tested negative for the coronavirus. Club captain Marco Reus made his first start for eight months after a groin injury. US teenager Giovanni Reyna, who assisted all three goals, was outstanding alongside Reus in the attacking midfield role for Dortmund. The 17-year-old played Haaland into space for the burly Norwegian to score both his goals, then delivered a pin-point corner for Emre Can's headed goal. Haaland, 19, once again showed dazzling finishing when he fired home from a right angle on 31 minutes. Can then rose highest from a corner and his bullet header put Dortmund 2-0 up two minutes after the break. Reyna and Haaland combined again when they got in behind the defence as the American delayed his pass which the Norwegian hammered into the net on 66 minutes. Winger Felix Passlack claimed his first Bundesliga goal in added time to complete the rout with Haaland providing the final pass. Defending champions Bayern Munich host Hertha Berlin on Sunday out to bounce back from last weekend's shock defeat at Hoffenheim to end their 23-match winning streak. Eintracht Frankfurt top the league table after their 2-1 win over previous leaders Hoffeheim. Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric netted his eighth goal in four games with a superb strike, curled inside the far corner, to give Hoffenheim the lead on 18 minutes. However, Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada turned the game when he tapped home on 54 minutes, then powered through the defence before Bas Dost stabbed the ball over the line on 19 minutes from time. It could have been 3-1 as Frankfurt had a late goal disallowed. Champions League side Moenchenegladbach romped to a 3-1 win at Cologne as Alassane Plea and Stefan Lainer fired home before Lars Stindl added a penalty on 56 minutes. Cologne scored a consolation goal when Elvis Rexhbecaj beat Gladbach keeper Yann Sommer from 20 metres out. Bremen earned a second win in three games when Leonardo Bittencourt's right-footed shot on 27 minutes sealed their 1-0 win at home to new boys Arminia Bielefeld. The hosts survived a late scare as Bielefeld had a goal disallowed just before the whistle. Leverkusen were held to a 1-1 draw at Stuttgart as Patrik Schick's early goal was cancelled out by an equaliser by the hosts' striker Sasa Kalajdzic. On Friday, Union Berlin enjoyed their first win of the season with a 4-0 thumping of Mainz at home as Germany striker Max Kruse scored his first goal for the hosts."
13,25/09/2020,22:38,Japan's Kamada guides Eintracht to Hertha win,Japan's Daichi Kamada provided two assists in Eintracht Frankfurt's 3-1 Bundesliga win at Hertha Berlin on Friday.,"Kamada, who has four international appearances, set up efforts for Bas Dost and Sebastien Rode after Andre Silva had opened the scoring in the German capital. A maximum of 4,000 spectators were allowed into the Olympiastadion due to the coronavirus restrictions. Hertha coach Bruno Labbadia kept faith in his lineup from the victory over Werder Bremen in the opening round of the season. Matheus Cunha started in midfield after being called up to Brazil's squad earlier in the day for next month's World Cup qualifiers. Adi Huetter made two changes from last weekend's 1-1 draw against promoted Arminia Bielefeld as goal scorer Andre Silva kept his place up front. After a quiet opening 25 minutes which failed to produce a shot on target Silva won a spot kick after Dedryck Boyata's careless tackle. The Portugal forward converted to score his third goal in as many games since joining Eintracht on a permanent deal from AC Milan earlier this month on the half hour mark. The visitors doubled their advantage seven minutes later as Dost claimed his second of the season and Kamada's first assist of proceedings. The Netherlands striker rose highest inside the Hertha box to head home Samurai Blue midfielder Kamada's free kick. Kamada, 24, was the provider for his side's third with 20 minutes to play. The 24-year-old found holding midfielder Rode at the edge of the box and he curled his left-footed shot past Hertha goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow. Labbadia's men cut the deficit with 12 minutes remaining as Martin Hinteregger's attempted clearance from a Jordan Torunarigha cross ended in his own net. The away side held on to clinch their opening win of the season and move top of the table."
14,19/09/2020,21:15,Haaland and Reyna shine as Dortmund youngsters down Gladbach,Erling Braut Haaland scored twice and 17-year-old Giovanni Reyna shone as youthful Borussia Dortmund swept aside fellow Champions League side Borussia Moenchengladbach 3-0 on Saturday on the opening weekend of the Bundesliga season.,"After holders Bayern Munich had kicked off the 2020/21 campaign on Friday with a record 8-0 thrashing of Schalke, Dortmund's youngsters also dazzled at home to Gladbach. ""It was a really good start to the season. We have a lot of young guys, it's fun to play with guys near my age,"" said USA Under-17 international Reyna. ""This is an exciting group and we have to keep working."" Haaland converted a second-half penalty, then again showcased his clinical eye for goal by finishing a superb counter as Dortmund attacked from their own goal. Coach Lucien Favre banked on youth by starting two 17-year-olds in Reyna and England Under-21 midfielder Jude Bellingham, who made his league debut, with Sancho and Haaland, both 20, leading Dortmund's attack. Reyna, making just his third league start, paid back the faith by scoring the opening goal and winning the penalty Haaland converted. Reyna drilled home Bellingham's superb pass from a tight ankle on 34 minutes, then had his ankle clipped after a darting run into the area to win the penalty for Haaland. Sancho tried to convince Haaland to let him take the spot-kick, but ""I was confident whoever took it, would score, which is the most important thing"" said Reyna. Haaland then stole the show with a stunning end-to-end sprint to support Sancho's break before crashing home Dortmund's third goal on 78 minutes. The towering Norwegian, the first player in Bundesliga history to score a hat-trick from the bench, now has 18 goals in 20 games for Dortmund since his arrival in January. For the first time since March, some German league clubs were able to welcome back limited numbers of fans, depending on permission from local health authorities. The biggest crowd of the day was in Dortmund, as 9,300 cheered the impressive home win. ""It's amazing to have fans back, they support us so much,"" added Reyna. Having finished runners-up to Bayern for the last two seasons, Dortmund are on a collision course with the European champions who they meet in the German Super Cup showdown on September 30 in Munich. Earlier, Hertha Berlin's new-signing Jhon Cordoba scored on his debut in a 4-1 away romp at Werder Bremen as the ambitious capital city club also threw down an early marker. In front of 8,500 in Bremen, Hertha defender Peter Pekarik and Belgian-born winger Dodi Lukebakio scored quick-fire goals at the end of the first half to leave Werder 2-0 down at the break and the hosts were whistled off the pitch by their own fans. Colombia striker Cordoba, signed from Cologne in mid-week, came on to start the move which Brazil Under-23 forward Matheus Cunha finished as Hertha went 3-0 up with an hour gone. Davie Selke scored Bremen's second-half consolation goal before Cordoba capped his debut by tucking home Hertha's fourth goal on 90 minutes. Just like Bayern, Cologne also had to play behind closed doors due to a rising rate of infection for their 3-2 home defeat to Hoffenheim, for whom Andrej Kramaric scored a hat-trick. The Croatia striker put the visitors ahead after three minutes following a mix up in defence, netted a penalty and smashed home the winning goal in added time after Cologne had launched a late fight back. In the capital, playmaker Michael Gregoritsch and winger Andre Hahn scored late goals as Augsburg beat hosts Union Berlin 3-1 in front of 4,600 fans. Newly-promoted Arminia Bielefeld earned a point with a 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on their return to the top flight in front of 6,500. Stuttgart, who also came up, gave Freiburg a scare with late goals by Sasa Kalajdzic and Silas Wamangituka as they fought back in a 3-2 defeat in front of 8,000."
15,27/06/2020,18:01,"Bremen snatch play-off survival chance, champions Bayern rout Wolfsburg","Werder Bremen gave themselves hope of avoiding relegation from the German Bundesliga by thrashing Cologne 6-1 to grab a play-off place on the last day of the season, while champions Bayern Munich routed Wolfsburg before lifting the trophy on Saturday.","Japan striker Yuya Osako scored twice as Bremen stole the lifeline of the relegation/promotion play-off place from Fortuna Duesseldorf, who lost 3-0 at Union Berlin and were relegated with Paderborn, finishing one point behind Bremen. Florian Kohfeldt's Werder will face second-tier opponents in either Heidenheim or possibly neighbours, rivals and fellow fallen giants Hamburg in the play-off first leg on Thursday. Bremen have spent more seasons than any other team in the Bundesliga, having only spent one term in the second tier, in 1980-81. A burst of goals from Osako, Milot Rashica and Niclas Fuellkrug -- all in the space of eight minutes -- had Werder 3-0 up at the break against Cologne at the Weserstadion. Former Everton midfielder Davy Klaassen then fired home a rebound just after the break before Osako, facing his old side, added his second and USA international Josh Sargent completed the rout. Dominick Drexler pulled a goal back for Cologne. Werder, the four-time Bundesliga champions, also needed a favour from Berlin and got one as Union beat Fortuna 3-0 with goals from Nigerian duo Anthony Ujah and Suleiman Abdullahi either side of veteran midfielder Christian Gentner's effort. Bremen will find out their play-off opponents on Sunday, with Heidenheim currently in the play-off place ahead of the final round of matches in the second division. At Wolfsburg, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski scored a penalty for his 34th league goal of the season, finishing as the top scorer for the fifth time. Kingsley Coman, Michael Cuisance and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet as Bayern, champions for the eighth straight season, finished 13 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Mueller set up Coman for Bayern's opening goal to finish the campaign with a league record 21 assists, and his goal that rounded out the win was also Bayern's 100th league goal this season -- one short of the Bundesliga record. Wolfsburg captain Josuha Guilavogui was sent off for a second yellow card after fouling Cuisance, leading to Lewandowski's penalty. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach and RB Leipzig secured qualification for next season's Champions League after 2-1 wins over Hertha Berlin and Augsburg respectively, as fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen missed out by two points despite beating Mainz 1-0. Dortmund, who had already wrapped up second place, crashed to a 4-0 home defeat by Hoffenheim, for whom Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric scored all four goals, including one penalty. That result allowed Hoffenheim to leapfrog Wolfsburg and take sixth place, although both sides will go into the Europa League next season along with Leverkusen. Before kick-off in Dortmund, Mario Goetze, whose winning goal sealed Germany's victory in the 2014 World Cup final, was given a send-off by the club. He will leave this summer with his contract having expired, but the 28-year-old attacking midfielder has not announced his future club. Elsewhere, Timo Werner signed off with a brace in RB Leipzig's 2-1 win at Augsburg in what was his final appearance for the club before moving to Chelsea. Schalke's disastrous second half of the season was completed with a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Freiburg as they finished the season 12th, having been third in December. Eintracht Frankfurt beat bottom side Paderborn 3-2 in Saturday's other game."
16,17/06/2020,20:58,Wagner's Schalke fail to win again in Europa League hunt,"David Wagner's Schalke continued their record-breaking run of bad form on Wednesday, notching up a 14th successive game without a win in a 2-1 away defeat to fellow European hopefuls Eintracht Frankfurt.","Former Huddersfield boss Wagner has overseen a miserable second half of the season, which has seen Schalke plummet from the Champions League spots into mid-table mediocrity. A draw against Leverkusen last weekend saw them set a new record for the longest winless streak in the club's history, with Wednesday's defeat only piling further misery on Wagner and his side. The more dangerous side in the opening phases, Frankfurt took the lead through Andre Silva with a blistering counter-attack on 28 minutes. David Abraham doubled the lead just after the break, nodding in at the far post after a fizzing free-kick from Filip Kostic. US international Weston McKennie headed Schalke back into the game on the hour mark, before Abraham denied Michael Gregoritsch the equaliser with an instinctive headed goal line clearance. While Schalke continue to sink, Frankfurt are hoping to make a late charge for European qualification. They now sit four points behind the coveted seventh spot with two games to go."
17,10/06/2020,23:15,Lewandowski fires weary Bayern into German Cup final in double bid,"Bayern Munich remain on course for the double after the Bundesliga leaders squeezed past Eintracht Frankfurt 2-1 in Wednesday's German Cup semi-final behind closed doors, with both teams supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.","Bayern's early goal by Ivan Perisic was cancelled out by a second-half equaliser from Frankfurt's Danny da Costa, who had only been on for three minutes at the Allianz Arena. However, Robert Lewandowski settled the matter with the winner 16 minutes from time to claim his 45th goal this season in all competitions. Bayern will face Bayer Leverkusen, who beat fourth-tier side Saarbruecken 3-0 on Tuesday, in the final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on July 4. ""We didn't always make the right decisions in the area, we should have been three or four up at half-time, which would've made our lives much easier,"" admitted Bayern's Thomes Mueller, whose chip set up Perisic's opening goal. ""You could feel the tiredness from both teams in the second-half when it got close, the will was there and we defended well, especially against the long balls."" Hansi Flick-coached Bayern, who have a seven-point lead with four games left in the league, can wrap up an eighth consecutive Bundesliga title this weekend if they beat Borussia Moenchengladbach and second-placed Borussia Dortmund lose at strugglers Fortuna Duesseldorf. However, Bayern will be without both Lewandowski and Mueller, who are both suspended. ""We need to rest up well and then go again on Saturday, the programme is punishing for all teams, so there is no whinging, but the tiredness is greater than the joy of reaching the final,"" added Mueller. Eintracht wore playing shirts supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, while Bayern warmed up in T-shirts bearing the same anti-racism message. It was the latest show of solidarity in German football following the death of George Floyd in the United States in late May. Bayern routed Frankfurt 5-2 also at the Allianz Arena, when the sides met in the league just over a fortnight ago, and once again the hosts wasted no time asserting their authority. Frankfurt midfielder Dominik Kohr cleared Mueller's header off the line with only six minutes gone. Eintracht had another let off two minutes later when Lewandowski, the league's top-scorer with 30 goals, was inches from converting a Mueller cross. However, Bayern took the lead when Mueller chipped the defence and Perisic powered his header past Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp on 14 minutes. The Germany goalkeeper had to pull of a point-blank save to deny Lewandowski moments later. It stayed 1-0 at the break, but Bayern found themselves under pressure in the second-half. Frankfurt's shock 5-1 drubbing of Bayern last November led to the sacking of Niko Kovac, Flick's predecessor as head coach, and the visitors started to win more ball in midfield. With 66 minutes gone, Frankfurt coach Adi Huetter boosted their attack with double substitutions bringing on Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada and Da Costa. The move paid off almost immediately. Kamada managed to beat three defenders in the area before his speculative pass across goal found de Costa, who smashed his shot past Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer on 69 minutes. It was no more than Frankfurt deserved, but Bayern responded by moving up a gear. Canadian teenager Alphonso Davies beat the defence in the area and squared to Lewandowski who was waiting to fire home his 45th goal in 39 matches this season. The referee checked for offside with VAR, but the goal stood and Bayern are into their 25th German Cup final."
18,07/06/2020,18:59,Japan's Hasebe 'proud' after setting Asian Bundesliga games record,"Former Japan captain Makoto Hasebe said he was ""proud"" after setting the record for most Bundesliga appearances by an Asian player.","Centre-back Hasebe, 36, played the full 90 minutes in Eintracht Frankfurt's 2-0 loss to Mainz on Saturday in what was his 309th German top-flight match to leapfrog ex-South Korea forward Cha Bum-kun. ""I'm very proud to have played more Bundesliga games than any other Asian player. But for me, it would have been much, much more important for the team to win,"" Hasebe told the Bundesliga's official website. ""We weren't as good as we needed to be today. We were lacking something in all areas,"" he told the club website. Hasebe made his Bundesliga debut in 2008 for Wolfsburg where he won the title before a one-season spell with Nuremburg. In 2014 he joined Eintracht and has played more than 150 times for the Commerzbank Arena outfit with whom he lifted the German Cup in 2018. He retired from international football after the 2018 World Cup having won 114 caps for Japan. In May Hasebe announced he will take up a position as a club ambassador from next month and maintain a dual role during his 14th season in Germany in 2020-2021. Eintracht are in 11th place in the table having only won once since the season returned after a two-month break due to the coronavirus pandemic."
19,06/06/2020,17:42,Lewandowski scores 30th Bundesliga goal of season as Bayern close on title,Robert Lewandowski scored his 30th league goal of the season on Saturday as Bayern Munich came from behind to claim a 4-2 victory at Bayer Leverkusen and move a step closer to the Bundesliga title.,"After Lucas Alario secured an early lead for the home side, Bayern struck twice in quick succession just before half-time to turn the game in their favour after Kingsley Coman's equaliser. Lewandowski netted in the second half as Bayern established a 10-point lead over title rivals Borussia Dortmund, who host Hertha Berlin later on Saturday. The game also saw Bayern lend their support to protests over the death of black American man George Floyd, with all their players wearing armbands bearing the slogan ""Black Lives Matter"". With their talisman and Bayern transfer target Kai Havertz ruled out with a muscle injury, Leverkusen turned to Alario to lead the line against the champions. The Argentine delivered after just nine minutes, beating the offside trap after a throw-in to slot the ball past Manuel Neuer. A mistake from Moussa Diaby allowed Coman to curl in the equaliser, before a fizzing shot from Leon Goretzka and an elegant lob from Serge Gnabry saw Bayern take a two-goal lead before half-time. Lewandowski finished the job with a well-placed header after the break, reaching the 30-goal mark for only the second time in his Bundesliga career, but there was still time for 17-year-old Florian Wirtz to curl in a consolation goal for Leverkusen before the final whistle. Elsewhere, a late equaliser from Christian Strohdiek gave bottom-of-the-table Paderborn a faint glimmer of hope in the race for survival, as they snatched a 1-1 draw away to RB Leipzig. Chelsea-bound Leipzig striker Timo Werner set up Patrik Schick on 27 minutes to give Leipzig the lead, but they were forced to defend it with 10 men after Dayot Upamecano was booked twice in the first half. Strohdiek's last-minute strike gave Paderborn their fourth draw in five games, though Steffen Baumgart's side remain eight points off Fortuna Duesseldorf who occupy the relegation play-off place. Duesseldorf themselves missed the chance to move towards safety, as they battled to a dramatic 2-2 draw against 10-man Hoffenheim. A headed opener from Rouwen Hennings and a red card for Hoffenheim's Benjamin Huebner put the home side in pole position, but the visitors struck back with goals from Munas Dabbur and Steven Zuber before Hennings saved a point with a late penalty. Uwe Roesler's side remain three points adrift of survival, after goals from Moussa Niakhate and Pierre Kunde Malong gave fellow strugglers Mainz a rare 2-0 win over local rivals Eintracht Frankfurt."

""Statistics and records don't interest me, what's important is to have a successful season,"" said Flick, in his first season since replacing Niko Kovac in November. ""At Bayern Munich, you are expected to win. I am very happy, we were very aggressive and didn't give them any chances."" Lewandowski, who had never previously scored in six games against Duesseldorf, made amends with goals either side of half-time. Fortuna, who were unbeaten in their three games since the league resumed after a two-month coronavirus-enforced hiatus, were humbled at the Allianz Arena where they last poached a 3-3 draw in November 2018. They fell behind on 15 minutes when Joergensen turned the ball into his own net after Pavard mishit his shot. Right-back Pavard then grabbed the second with a powerful header on 29 minutes before Lewandowski made it 3-0 just before the break after being presented with a tap-in by Thomas Mueller. Duesseldorf were floored with two goals in as many minutes as Lewandowski profited again with another poacher's goal after Serge Gnabry's good work. Davies then scored the game's best goal. After some high pressing, the Canadian teen won the ball in the Duesseldorf area, barged past a succession of defenders and fired home to make it 5-0 on 52 minutes. Werder Bremen boosted their survival hopes with a 1-0 win at Schalke, who are winless in 11 games and continue to plummet. Midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt scored a first-half winner. ""This is a very, very important away win,"" said Bremen coach Florian Kohfeldt. ""We have taken seven points from the last three games, but if you look at the table, we are still behind."" Bremen have spent more seasons in the Bundesliga than any other club, but currently sit second from bottom. However, Saturday's victory leaves them just three points from guaranteed safety with six games left. They are two points behind Duesseldorf in 16th, which carries a relegation play-off at the end of the season. Werder could climb out of the relegation places for the first time since December on Wednesday if they beat Eintracht Frankfurt at home. Bittencourt hit a stunning strike from just outside the box which beat Schalke's Bayern-bound goalkeeper Alexander Nuebel on 32 minutes. Schalke succumbed to their fourth straight defeat, piling pressure on head coach David Wagner. In the same game, Schalke's American midfielder Weston McKennie wore a 'Justice for George' armband as part of the growing protests over the death of an unarmed black man during a police arrest in the United States. ""To be able to use my platform to bring attention to a problem that has been going on too long feels good!!!,"" tweeted 21-year-old McKennie.

Defender Martin Hinteregger bagged two quick goals from successive corners when he volleyed home, then headed in to make it 3-2 on 55 minutes. Canadian teenager Alphonso Davies settled Bayern's nerves by reclaiming a ball he lost in the area to fire home the hosts' fourth goal with an hour gone. Hinteregger then claimed an unwanted hat-trick when he turned a Serge Gnabry shot into his own net to make it 5-2 on 74 minutes. The win re-establishes Bayern's four-point lead before travelling to second-placed Dortmund. This was the second weekend of the Bundesliga's restart, following a two-month hiatus, as the first top European league to resume during the pandemic. A minute's silence was held before the day's five matches to remember the victims of COVID-19, which has so far claimed 8,216 lives in Germany. Dortmund claimed a 2-0 win at Wolfsburg with goals by Raphael Guerreiro and Achraf Hakimi. Dortmund coach Lucien Favre said the lack of fans' noise in the stadium helped him give instructions. ""I think it's positive that the players can now hear me better in the stadium,"" said Dortmund's Swiss coach, whose calls echoed around the empty terraces. ""Normally only my wide players can understand me."" Dortmund winger Guerreiro opened the scoring in the 32nd minute when he tapped home a cross. The visitors had a let-off early in the second-half when Wolfsburg winger Renato Steffen clipped the crossbar. England winger Jadon Sancho helped sealed the win when he dribbled at the Wolfsburg defence, then laid a pass off to Hakimi, who fired home 12 minutes from time. Wolfsburg had replacement Felix Klaus sent off for fouling Hakimi. ""We showed right after the start of the match that we wanted to win,"" added Favre. Bayer Leverkusen built on Monday's drubbing of Werder Bremen by moving up to third place with a 3-1 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach, who dropped to fourth. With the terraces at Borussia Park decked with 13,000 cardboard cut-outs of home fans, Leverkusen's rising star Kai Havertz, who scored twice in the 4-1 rout of Bremen, again netted a brace. With seven minutes gone, Havertz, 20, darted onto Karim Bellarabi's pass into the area and fired home. French forward Marcus Thuram levelled for Gladbach just after the break. Havertz netted a penalty soon after when the video assistant referee spotted a foul on Bellarabi in the area. Defender Sven Bender unwittingly sealed the win when a free-kick struck his shoulder and flew into the net nine minutes from time. Second-from-bottom Werder Bremen claimed their first victory in eight league game with a 1-0 win at Freiburg. Midfielder Leon Bittencourt hit the winner in the 19th minute with a long-range shot. In the dying stages, Bremen had defender Philipp Bargfrede sent off for a second yellow card and Freiburg had a goal ruled offside. The result leaves Bremen two points from 16th -- which carries a relegation play-off at the end of the season -- but six points from 15th, which guarantees safety. Bottom side Paderborn are now nine points from safety with seven games left after their 1-1 draw at home to Hoffenheim. On Friday, Hertha Berlin drubbed neighbours Union Berlin 4-0 at the Olympic Stadium in the derby to go 10th."

""We'll have to wait,"" Flick said. Frankfurt are 13th in the table and lost at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach last Saturday for a fourth straight Bundesliga defeat, but they humiliated Bayern 5-1 in November. Even though Bayern were reduced to 10 men after nine minutes that day when Jerome Boateng was sent off, that defeat cost Flick's predecessor Niko Kovac his job. ""Frankfurt overwhelmed us there with their dynamism,"" Flick said. ""It's a different game, with different conditions. It starts at zero."" Bayern won behind closed doors away to Union Berlin last Sunday. This will be their first match at home since the league resumed. ""Each of us has at least one game without an audience behind us and we know what to expect,"" he said. ""Before the game against Union we trained in our stadium. So the team knows what kind of atmosphere they can expect. We like playing at the Allianz Arena."" Bayern lead Borussia Dortmund by four points and the two teams meet on Tuesday, when Bayern travel to the Ruhr for a potentially pivotal match. Flick insisted his team would not be distracted on Saturday. ""The duel with Dortmund next week will not matter. We'll play against Frankfurt. That's the next step we want to take. Only then will we look towards Dortmund."" Bayern have three long-term injury absentees: Philippe Coutinho and Corentin Tolisso (who both underwent ankle surgery in April) and Niklas Suele who is recovering from a knee ligament injury. ""Niklas has expressed the desire to play this season. We must see what the stability in the knee allows,"" said Flick."

Beckenbauer, whose trial on corruption charges linked to the 2006 World Cup ended without a verdict late last month, was invited to the game by Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge as part of an eight-person delegation that will also include former club president Uli Hoeness. Nicknamed 'Kaiser', Beckenbauer was teammates with both Hoeness and Rummenigge when Bayern dominated European football, winning three straight European Cups in the 1970s. Beckenbauer, whose health has deteriorated in recent years, will have to wear a face mask and sit several seats away from others in the delegation, as the Bundesliga undertakes its second round of matches since coming back from its coronavirus-enforced hiatus. ""I will be able to concentrate on the match and enjoy it. Otherwise I'd be asked all the time: 'Franz, what do you think about that move?',"" he said. ""I much prefer being able to watch the match without having to talk all the time."" Beckenbauer had been on trial in Switzerland after being accused of making payments to former FIFA executive Mohamed bin Hammam in 2005, allegedly for helping Germany win the right to host the following year's World Cup finals. Germany beat the pre-vote favourites South Africa 12-11 in the ballot, and Beckenbauer -- who headed the organising committee for the 2006 tournament -- denied he paid money to anyone to buy votes. Bin Hammam admitted in 2018 that he had received a EUR6.7 million payment from Germany but claimed it was not a bribe linked to the awarding of the World Cup. The five-year-long trial of Beckenbauer and three other men was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic and ended after the statute of limitations expired. In Switzerland, criminal proceedings concerning a fraud allegation must take place within 15 years. Because Beckenbauer's case dates back to an incident in 2005, courts no longer have jurisdiction over the case."

In a statement, the club added they believed ""several hundred visiting supporters would go to Basel and gather outside the stadium during the match"". The decisions comes after local police decided to bar the match from being played in the city, and the club did not indicate where the match might be held. Last week the Swiss football league suspended the country's top-flight Super League until March 23 in an effort to help contain the spread of COVID-19, which has killed more than 3,800 people worldwide. Contacted by AFP, UEFA said they were ""studying all possible scenarios""."

As a team from a lower division, Saarbruecken won the right to play at home against 1993 winners Bayer Leverkusen. Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky said before the draw that he wanted his side to avoid playing Munich and Frankfurt. Saarbruecken goalkeeper Daniel Batz said that his side wanted to ""save Bayern for the final"". Nineteen-time champions Bayern Munich, who have appeared in seven of the last 10 German Cup finals and won five, will face Eintracht at the Allianz Arena. Frankfurt claimed a surprise 3-1 win over Bayern in the final two years ago. The ties will take place on April 21 and 22, while the final will be held at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 23."
29,04/03/2020,23:42,"Leverkusen, Eintracht reach German Cup semi-finals",Bayer Leverkusen came from behind to beat 10-man Union Berlin 3-1 on Wednesday at the BayArena to reach the German Cup semi-finals.,"Peter Bosz's side are looking to win the competition for only the second time in the club's history and join Bayern Munich and Saarbruecken in the last four. Marcus Ingvartsen gave the visitors a 39th-minute lead, arriving at the back post to meet Marius Buelter's cross and power a header into the bottom corner. But Union, who were Cup runners-up to Schalke as a third-tier side in 2001, were dealt a massive blow 19 minutes from time as defender Christopher Lenz was dismissed for a second yellow card. Leverkusen wasted little time in making Lenz pay, as Karim Bellarabi equalised just a minute later, drilling a low effort into the bottom corner after being played in on goal by Kai Havertz. The hosts completed the comeback as Chilean international Charles Aranguiz headed home Kerem Demirbay's 86th-minute corner before Moussa Diaby added gloss to the scoreline in injury time. Later Wednesday, Andre Silva and Daichi Kamada scored as Eintracht Frankfurt made the semi-finals with a 2-0 home win over Werder Bremen. Portuguese striker Silva scored the opener deep into first-half injury time from the penalty spot. Japanese star Kamada tucked away the second goal on the hour when he volleyed home a cross from Filip Kostic. However, Kostic will miss the semi-finals after being red-carded for a crunching foul on Omer Toprak. On Tuesday, holders Bayern Munich continued their bid for a treble of Bundesliga, Cup and Champions League titles by edging past Schalke 1-0, while Saarbruecken stunned top-flight Fortuna Duesseldorf on penalties to become the first fourth-division side to reach the semis."
30,02/11/2019,18:51,Kovac future in doubt after Bayern's worst loss since 2009,Niko Kovac admitted his future as Bayern Munich coach hung in the balance Saturday after their 5-1 thrashing at Eintracht Frankfurt -- the club's heaviest Bundesliga defeat for 10 years.,"Bayern are now four points behind leaders Moenchengladbach after their biggest league loss since a humiliating 5-1 drubbing in April 2009 at Wolfsburg. That defeat a decade ago eventually cost Jurgen Klinsmann his job as Bayern boss and Kovac could face a similar fate as Frankfurt shredded 10-man Bayern after defender Jerome Boateng was sent off after nine minutes. Kovac has been in charge since June 2018, winning the league and cup double last season, but could only offer a glum ""I don't know"" when asked about his future. ""After the red card, everything went out the window,"" a bitterly disappointed Kovac told Sky. ""Nevertheless, that shouldn't have happened to us and it's not what we expect from ourselves. ""We made too many mistakes."" Bayern had Boateng sent off for a straight red card for a foul as the last man, before goals by Filip Kostic, Djibril Sow, David Abraham and Martin Hinteregger put Frankfurt 4-1 up with an hour played. Robert Lewandowski scored for Bayern in the first half, extending his league record of scoring in the first 10 games this season. However, such was Frankfurt's dominance that head coach Adi Huetter brought on a third striker in Andre Silva for defensive midfielder Gelson Fernandes with 10 minutes left. The bold move paid off as Goncalo Paciencia added their fifth goal five minutes from time. ""It's not a huge wonder (that this happened),"" fumed Bayern captain Manuel Neuer. ""Things had already got off to a (bad) start."" ""That (the red card) didn't make it any easier, of course, but still you can't concede five. We're not consistent in our defence."""
31,02/11/2019,17:33,Bayern thrashed 5-1 at Frankfurt in ten-year low,Bayern Munich crashed to their heaviest Bundesliga defeat for a decade with a 5-1 thrashing at Eintracht Frankfurt which leaves head coach Niko Kovac under huge pressure.,"Defending champions Bayern, who had to play the majority of the match with 10 men following Jerome Boateng's ninth-minute red card, are fourth, four points behind leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach who won 2-1 at Bayer Leverkusen. It was Bayern's biggest league defeat since April 2009 when they crashed 5-1 at Wolfsburg, who won the 2008/09 league title. After a shock 2-1 loss at home to Hoffenheim last month, Bayern suffered a second league defeat of the season which came following Boateng's sending off for felling Frankfurt forward Goncalo Paciencia on the edge of the area. Filip Kostic tapped home at the back post to open the scoring for the hosts on 25 minutes and Swiss midfielder Djibril Sow added a second eight minutes later from a Kostic cross to leave Bayern 2-0 down. Bayern's star striker Robert Lewandowski brought his side back into the game eight minutes before the break when he bludgeoned his way through three defenders to fire home his 20th goal this season in all competitions. Lewandowski's 14th league goal extended his record of scoring in each of the first 10 Bundesliga games this season. However, Frankfurt were not to be denied and defender David Abraham hit their third goal after a pin-point accurate pass from winger Danny da Costa three minutes after the restart. A fourth frankfurt goal followed when defender Martin Hinteregger headed home from a corner on the hour. Such was Frankfurt's dominance that head coach Adi Huetter brought on a third striker in Andre Silva for a defensive midfielder with 10 minutes left and it paid off as Paciencia added their fifth goal. Kovac is now under huge pressure as Bayern host Olympiakos on Wednesday in the Champions League, where they top Group B with three straight wins, before facing Borussia Dortmund at home next Saturday in a classic Bundesliga showdown. Gladbach are three points clear at the top of the table after French striker Marcus Thuram scored their winner at Leverkusen. Dortmund climbed to second as goals by Raphael Guerreiro, Thorgan Hazard and Mario Goetze sealed Dortmund's 3-0 win at home to Wolfsburg, who dropped from fourth to seventh. RB Leipzig are a point behind in third after slaughtering Mainz 8-0 with the hosts' Germany striker Timo Werner scoring a hat-trick. Freiburg drop to fifth despite Nils Petersen stealing a point in the last minute with his second of the game in their 2-2 draw at Werder Bremen."
32,27/10/2019,20:46,M'gladbach regain Bundesliga lead after 'deserved' Eintracht win,Borussia Moenchengladbach regained their Bundesliga lead on Sunday with a 4-2 win over Eintracht Frankfurt as the five-times German champions bounced back from last week's defeat at Borussia Dortmund.,"Marcus Thuram scored in the 28th minute, capitalising on an urgent counter attack which has become typical of his side under the leadership of Marco Rose. Oscar Wendt added a second in first half injury time, pouncing on a poor defensive error from Frankfurt's Martin Hinteregger. Danny Da Costa's 59th-minute goal brought Frankfurt back into the match, with the visitors dominant until Nico Elvedi silenced the away fans with a superb headed goal against the run of play. Hinteregger and Denis Zakaria added one goal a piece for each team in the dying stages, with the home side holding on to a comfortable two-goal advantage. The win lifts them onto 19 points, one ahead of Bayern Munich, while Frankfurt are back in ninth. 'Gladbach coach Rose said that his side's lofty standing was no fluke. ""We deserved to win. We consistently tried to build pressure and be brave in pushing for more goals,"" he said. ""For us, the Bundesliga is about gradually improving our game and getting better."" Earlier, a late VAR intervention cost Wolfsburg the chance to go top with Joao Victor's 84th-minute goal disallowed in a goalless draw against Augsburg. Wolfsburg celebrated what they thought was a victory after Tin Jedvaj's cross was tapped home by Victor before referee Tobias Stieler overturned the strike for offside. The visitors started on top, dominating the first period. Augsburg striker Florian Niederlechner had a number of chances, going close in the 17th minute with a close range shot. Niederlechner had another chance to open the scoring in the 50th minute, but again failed to convert. Brazilian defender William was the home side's best player, probing and asking constant questions of the Augsburg defence. It was a rare offensive stalemate for Wolfsburg, who had scored in every Bundesliga game so far this season. They are now fourth, level on 17 points with Freiburg. Wolfsburg remain the Bundesliga's only unbeaten side, while Augsburg finish the weekend in 17th after chalking up their fourth draw of the season. Wolfsburg coach Oliver Glasner said that he was not disappointed with his charges. ""We have to live with a point. The championship lead would have been a nice snapshot. Even so, the table is pretty pleasing to look at."" The stalemate highlighted the congested nature of the 2019-20 Bundesliga campaign, with only four points separating leaders Bayern Munich from 10th-placed Hoffenheim."
33,18/10/2019,22:37,Leverkusen blow chance to go top with Frankfurt loss,Goncalo Paciencia scored twice in the first half as Eintracht Frankfurt beat Bayer Leverkusen 3-0 on Friday to deny the visitors the chance to move top of the Bundesliga.,"The Portuguese forward fired Frankfurt ahead inside five minutes as he latched on to a Danny Da Costa pass and held off two defenders to stroke the ball under Lukas Hradecky. Paciencia won a penalty on the quarter-hour when his shot was blocked by the hands of a sliding Aleksandar Dragovic, rolling home the spot-kick to double the lead for the hosts. Eintracht goalkeeper Frederik Ronnow, deputising for the injured Kevin Trapp, kept Leverkusen at bay with a string of stops from Karim Bellarabi, Lucas Alario and Kai Havertz. Leverkusen were awarded a penalty midway through the second half for an apparent handball by Djibril Sow but the decision was correctly overturned following a VAR review. Dutch striker Bas Dost wrapped up the victory for Frankfurt 10 minutes from time as he brushed off Dragovic to net his third league goal of the season. Eintracht moved level with Leverkusen as part of a cluster of six teams on 14 points, two adrift of leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach. Marco Rose's Gladbach go to Borussia Dortmund on Saturday while second-placed Wolfsburg travel to RB Leipzig. Defending champions Bayern Munich will attempt to bounce back from a 2-1 loss at home to Hoffenheim when they visit Bavarian neighbours Augsburg."
34,22/09/2019,21:34,Late Frankfurt equaliser angers Dortmund captain Reus,Marco Reus was left fuming after Borussia Dortmund conceded a late own goal to draw 2-2 at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday and lose ground on Bundesliga leaders RB Leipzig.,"Dortmund twice took the lead but surrendered an equaliser on 88 minutes, failing to deal with two crosses before Japan midfielder Daichi Kamada forced Thomas Delaney to turn the ball into his own net. The draw left Dortmund third, three points behind Leipzig and one adrift of defending champions Bayern Munich, who thrashed Cologne 4-0 on Saturday. Unbeaten Leipzig won 3-0 at Werder Bremen. In Frankfurt, goals by Belgium midfielder Axel Witsel and England winger Jadon Sancho either side of an Andre Silva equaliser left Dortmund 2-1 up with full-time approaching before Delaney's costly own goal. Dortmund captain Reus could not hide his frustration. ""We are not seeing the thing through,"" the Germany international told Sky, bristling when asked if his team had a ""mentality problem"". ""Stop asking about this mentality shit -- it's crap and it's the same questions every week."" Dortmund head coach Lucien Favre kept the same starting line-up which drew 0-0 at home to Barcelona in the Champions League in midweek. Germany head coach Joachim Loew was in the stands amid calls from both German legend Lothar Matthaeus and Favre that Mats Hummels should be recalled to the national squad. Hummels, deemed to be past his prime by Loew last March, was outstanding against Barcelona and marshalled the back four in Frankfurt before being replaced on the hour due to a back injury. His experience was badly missed in the dying stages. Dortmund made a bright start when Witsel picked out the bottom corner with 11 minutes gone, but a lapse in concentration let Frankfurt back in just before the break as Silva levelled. Witsel added an assist to his earlier goal as he latched onto the rebound after Raphael Guerreiro's free-kick was saved by Kevin Trapp, teeing up Sancho to tap in his third league goal of the season on 66 minutes. Sancho made way for Germany winger Julian Brandt soon after with Eintracht already pushing for an equaliser before Kamada's volley was diverted in by Delaney. Earlier, French under-21 striker Marcus Thuram came off the bench to score twice in Borussia Moenchengladbach's 2-1 win over Fortuna Duesseldorf. Hosts Gladbach crashed to a shock 4-0 defeat at home by Austrian side Wolfsberg in the Europa League on Thursday and were heading towards a second loss in four days at Borussia Park before Thuram intervened. Ghana defender Kasim Adams gave Duesseldorf a first-half lead, but Thuram turned the game by converting a cross seven minutes after coming on and then tapping home the late winner from a goalmouth scramble. They were Thuram's first Bundesliga goals in only his fifth game since signing from French second-division club Guingamp in July for nine million euros ($9.9m). Gladbach's third win in five games kept them three points back of Leipzig as one of five teams level on 10 points. Fortuna dropped to 12th."
35,22/09/2019,18:15,Sub Thuram rescues Gladbach with late double,French under-21 striker Marcus Thuram came off the bench to score twice on Sunday and seal a dramatic 2-1 win for Borussia Moenchengladbach against Fortuna Duesseldorf in the Bundesliga.,"Hosts Gladbach crashed to a shock 4-0 defeat at home to Austrian side Wolfsberg in the Europa League in mid-week and were heading towards a second loss in four days at Borussia Park before Thuram equalised midway through the second half, then claimed a late winner. The 22-year-old turned the game after coming on with 67 minutes played for fellow Frenchman Alassane Plea, converting a cross seven minutes after his substitution, then tapped home the winner following a goal-mouth scramble three minutes from time. There were hints of off-side in the build-up to his second goal and Gladbach had a nervous wait while the video assistant referee checked, but Thuram was mobbed by his team-mates when his winner was confirmed. They were Thuram's first Bundesliga goals in only his fifth game since signing from French second-division club Guingamp in July for nine million euros ($9.9m). The home fans' relief at the final whistle was understandable after Fortuna took the lead with only seven minutes gone when a header by Ghana defender Kasim Adams stood after goal-line technology confirmed the ball crossed the line having deflected off the crossbar. Thuram's goals gave Gladbach their third win in five games, lifting them from fifth to eighth in the table, while Fortuna have now lost three of their opening games to drop to 12th. Later Borussia Dortmund can claim second in the table, knocking defending champions Bayern Munich down to third in the process, if they win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Bayern jumped from fourth to second on Saturday with a 4-0 thrashing of Cologne thanks to playmaker Philippe Coutinho's first Bundesliga goal and two from striker Robert Lewandowski. RB Leipzig will finish the weekend in top spot after their 3-0 win at Werder Bremen on Saturday thanks to a Willi Orban header, a superb Marcel Sabitzer free-kick and a late third by substitute Marcelo Saracchi."
36,17/05/2019,16:12,'A lot of unrest' - Leipzig coach Rangnick hoping Bayern lose title,RB Leipzig coach Ralf Rangnick has said that his team will benefit if Bayern Munich surrender the Bundesliga title to Borussia Dortmund on Saturday.,"Bayern go into the final round of games two points ahead of Dortmund, and hope to wrap up a seventh straight title before they face Leipzig in the German Cup final in Berlin next weekend. ""If Bayern were to lose out on the title from the good position they are in, then it would lead to a lot of unrest,"" Rangnick told AFP subsidiary SID on Friday. ""In terms of preparation for the cup final, that certainly wouldn't be an advantage for them."" Bayern will be crowned champions unless they lose at home to Frankfurt and Dortmund beat Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday. Leipzig, meanwhile, hope to ruin Bayern's domestic double hopes and secure the first major trophy of their 10-year history in Berlin on May 25."
37,17/05/2019,02:10,"Favre, Kovac face old friends as Bundesliga finale grips Germany",Bayern Munich coach Niko Kovac and his Borussia Dortmund counterpart Lucien Favre both face a trip down memory lane on Saturday as the Bundesliga braces itself for the most nail-biting season finale in years.,"Both Kovac and Favre will face their former clubs on a much-anticipated final day, as the title race goes down to the last weekend of the season for the first time since 2010. Bayern currently sit two points ahead of Dortmund, and can claim a seventh straight league crown if they avoid defeat at home by Kovac's old club Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. Dortmund, meanwhile, travel to Favre's old hunting ground at Borussia Moenchengladbach, knowing that they can only be crowned champions if they win and Bayern lose. ""We need to focus on our game,"" said Favre on Thursday, adding that Dortmund needed to be prepared for all eventualities against Gladbach, whom he coached between 2011 and 2015. ""They play well on the counter-attack, but they can also press high up the pitch, and they need to win too,"" he said. There is more than the title at stake on Saturday, with both Gladbach and Frankfurt still in the running for Champions League qualification. Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc joked on Thursday that he would not send Frankfurt a crate of beer if they beat Bayern. ""They have something to play for, so they don't need any extra motivation,"" he said. Zorc admitted that Bayern were in ""pole position"", but confirmed that the club were making plans for a potential title celebration in the Dortmund town centre. ""We are hugely looking forward to the game, and the excitement will rise when we are on the way to the stadium, those are nice moments,"" he said. Bayern coach Kovac said on Thursday that he was proud to be on the verge of the title, having trailed Dortmund by nine points in December. ""In winter, we just hoped we would have any chance at all on the final day, and now we are in the comfortable situation of having it in our own hands,"" he said. The Croatian said he was expecting an emotional afternoon on Saturday, when his old club Frankfurt come to Munich. Bayern have not won the title in front of their own fans since 2000, and are preparing to bid farewell to club icons Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery. ""There hasn't been a situation like this in Munich for a while, and we want to bring the fans with us on Saturday,"" he said. Kovac, who steered Frankfurt away from relegation in 2016 before leading them to glory in the German Cup last season, said that the pressure to win the title was nothing compared to a relegation fight. ""When you are fighting for your existence, that is something different,"" he said. Yet the under-fire coach knows that Saturday's meeting with his Frankfurt past could yet define his Bayern future. Rumours that Kovac is on the verge of the sack have increased in the build-up to the Frankfurt game, but the Croatian was philosophical on Thursday. ""I like the job but I am also independent. I have always been a fighter and have never given up,"" he said. With Saturday's title decider and next weekend's German Cup final against RB Leipzig, Kovac has two chances to win silverware in the next week, and is determined to take both of them. ""We must win trophies,"" he said."
38,16/05/2019,13:39,'Everything is possible' - Dortmund boss Favre,"Borussia Dortmund coach Lucien Favre says ""everything is possible"" as his side prepare to make one desperate final bid for the Bundesliga title against Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday.","Dortmund are two points behind league leaders Bayern Munich ahead of the last day of the season, and can only be crowned champions on Saturday if they beat Gladbach and Bayern lose at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. Gladbach and Frankfurt also have much to play for, with both clubs still in the race for Champions League qualification. ""The league is exciting until the end this year, and that is good for the Bundesliga,"" said Favre at the pre-match press conference on Thursday. ""Everything is possible but I don't want to talk about (our title chances). We have to concentrate on our game."" Sporting director Michael Zorc said that Dortmund were proud to have kept the title race alive until the last day, but admitted that his team had only an outside chance of snatching the title. ""We know that Bayern are in pole position,"" he said."
39,12/05/2019,22:14,Frankfurt cap bad week by slipping off top-4 pace,Eintracht Frankfurt capped a miserable week with a 2-0 home loss to Mainz on Sunday to slip out of the Champions League qualifying places in the Bundesliga.,"Adi Huetter's side held a three-point cushion in the fourth and final Champions League spot heading into last weekend's round of matches, but were thrashed 6-1 at fifth-placed Bayern Leverkusen before exiting the Europa League semi-finals to Chelsea on penalties in midweek. Eintracht knew a win over Mainz would restore their two-point advantage in fourth ahead of their final league game at title-chasing Bayern Munich. But their European exertions got the better of them as Nigerian international Anthony Ujah scored twice in four second-half minutes for Mainz to leave Frankfurt sixth, a point adrift of fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach. They will now have to beat Bayern next week, potentially handing the title to Borussia Dortmund, and hope both Gladbach and Leverkusen drop points. ""We just haven't taken the opportunity to play in Europe next year, but now we have to give everything in Bavaria,"" said defender Martin Hinteregger, who missed his spot-kick against Chelsea. ""We can win a lot, but we can also lose a lot."" On Saturday, Bayern's bid for a seventh straight league crown was pushed to the final day of the season as Niko Kovac's men were held to a goalless draw at RB Leipzig, while Dortmund moved to within two points of their rivals thanks to a nervy 3-2 victory over Fortuna Duesseldorf."
40,10/05/2019,12:10,Plucky Frankfurt hailed after Euro exit,Adi Huetter's Eintracht Frankfurt side have been hailed as heroes after their fairytale European journey came to an end in a bitter penalty shootout defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Thursday.,"""Even though they lost in London, Frankfurt are winners in Europe this year,"" wrote the Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Friday morning. Frankfurt's thrilling run to the semi-final of the Europa League saw them knock out several big name teams and win admiration across Europe for the fervour of their support and the fearlessness of their football. ""Our heads are hanging low and the tears have been flowing, we are very disappointed,"" said coach Huetter on Thursday night. ""But we can only be proud of ourselves."" In a year in which the Bundesliga's biggest teams Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund both suffered an early exit in the Champions League, the romantic story of underdogs Frankfurt gave German football fans of all colours something to cheer about. Eintracht, who were on the brink of relegation just three years ago, knocked out the likes of Benfica, Shakhtar Donetsk and Inter Milan in the Europa League this season before holding Chelsea to two 1-1 draws in the semi-final. ""Frankfurt have restored faith in the unpredictability of football,"" wrote Zeit newspaper, adding that the club had ""breathed life"" into Europe's secondary club competition. ""The enthusiasm with which the club and its fans marched through the Europa League is a shining example for other clubs,"" wrote Kicker magazine, saying Frankfurt had engaged in a ""heroic battle"". Frankfurt's loyal support earned plaudits for their passion and strength in numbers in cities across Europe this season. On Thursday, several thousand away fans stayed behind to cheer the team they called ""the best in Europe"", long after the home stands had emptied out at Stamford Bridge. ""Europe saw that there can be a bond between those in the stands and those on the pitch, that is Frankfurt's legacy,"" wrote Die Zeit. Frankfurt still have the chance to secure Champions League qualification for the first time in their history in their remaining two Bundesliga games. They are currently fourth in the Bundesliga, ahead of Bayer Leverkusen only on goal difference. ""The fans and the team have earned the right to play in Europe next season,"" said Huetter on Thursday. ""We have come away empty-handed, but it has been a sensational season in Europe."""
41,10/05/2019,01:32,'It wasn't easy',Maurizio Sarri admitted Chelsea rode their luck to reach the Europa League final as Kepa Arrizabalaga's penalty heroics clinched a dramatic 4-3 shoot-out win against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday.,"Sarri's side will face London rivals Arsenal in an all-Premier League final in Baku on May 29 as for the first time all four finalists in the Champions and Europa League come from England. Chelsea took the lead in the semi-final second leg thanks to Ruben Loftus-Cheek's first half strike at Stamford Bridge. But Luka Jovic equalised soon after the interval as a tense clash finished 1-1 after extra time and 2-2 on aggregate. Cesar Azpilicueta's penalty was saved by Kevin Trapp in the shoot-out, but Kepa kept out Martin Hinteregger's effort and then turned away Goncalo Paciencia before Eden Hazard slotted home the decisive kick to spark wild celebrations. It was a sweet moment of redemption for Kepa after he was widely criticised for his astonishing mutiny in the League Cup final against Manchester City when he refused to be substituted before the Blues lost on penalties. A relieved Sarri conceded Chelsea found it hard to control the game and needed some good fortune to avoid a shock exit. ""We played a very good first half. Then in the first part of the second half, we went in trouble. We were passive in the defensive phase, so we conceded the goal, 10 minutes of panic,"" he said. ""In extra-time we were really tired. After 60 matches to play 120 minutes it's really very difficult. ""There is no preparation for penalties because you can kick very well in the training ground but then the pressure is different. ""We have to recover energy because we are really very tired."" Hazard also relished his crucial contribution in what could be his last kick at the Bridge amid rumours of a close-season move to Real Madrid. ""I am only thinking to win something for this club,"" said Hazard when asked if the final will be his last game for the club. ""If it is my last game I will try to do everything. In my mind I don't know yet."" Having already qualified for next season's Champions League when they guaranteed a top-four finish in the Premier League last weekend, Chelsea can bring an uplifting end to Sarri's troubled first season by winning the Europa League. Former Napoli boss Sarri this week claimed Chelsea ""deserve"" to win a trophy this season and the Italian is now one victory away from the first major prize of his managerial career. However, Sarri is not happy that Chelsea will play a friendly in the United States against New England Revolution next week. ""Now we need to rest. Unfortunately we have to go play in the United States because I think in this moment we need to rest then we have 10 days to prepare the final,"" Sarri said. Inevitably, Hazard was the catalyst for Chelsea's 28th minute opener as he twisted and turned to find just enough space for a perfectly-weighted pass to Loftus-Cheek. Hazard's vision and execution completely flummoxed the Frankfurt defence, leaving Loftus-Cheek with plenty of time to guide a cool low finish into the far corner for his 10th goal of the season. But Chelsea couldn't turn their first half superiority into further goals and a fatal loss of concentration allowed Frankfurt to equalise in the 49th minute. Jovic had scored Frankfurt's goal in the first leg and the 21-year-old Serb showed why he is being linked to Real Madrid with another predatory finish. Chesting the ball down to Mijat Gacinovic, Jovic easily eluded the dozing Luiz as he ran onto the return pass and calmly steered in his 10th Europa League goal this season. Still lacking any rhythm in extra-time, Chelsea needed an agile goalline clearance from Luiz to stop Sebastien Haller's shot before the Frankfurt forward was denied again by Davide Zappacosta's header off the line. Azpilicueta thought he'd won it for Chelsea in the closing minutes when he bundled home after Trapp dropped Hazard's cross, but the goal was controversially disallowed for the Spaniard's challenge on the keeper, setting the stage for Kepa and Hazard to see the Blues through to Baku."
42,10/05/2019,00:38,Kepa shines in shoot-out drama,Kepa Arrizabalaga was Chelsea's hero as the Spanish goalkeeper sent his side to the Europa League final with two penalty saves in a dramatic 4-3 shoot-out win against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday.,"Maurizio Sarri's side will face London rivals Arsenal in an all-Premier League final in Baku on May 29 as for the first time all four finalists in the Champions and Europa League come from England. Chelsea took the lead in the semi-final second leg thanks to Ruben Loftus-Cheek's first half strike at Stamford Bridge. But Luka Jovic equalised soon after the interval as a tense clash finished 1-1 after extra time and 2-2 on aggregate. Cesar Azpilicueta's penalty was saved by Kevin Trapp in the shoot-out, but Kepa kept out Martin Hinteregger's effort and then turned away Goncalo Paciencia before Eden Hazard slotted home the decisive kick to spark wild celebrations. It was a sweet moment of redemption for Kepa after he was widely criticised for his astonishing mutiny in the League Cup final against Manchester City when he refused to be substituted before the Blues lost on penalties. Hazard also relished his crucial contribution in what could be his last kick at the Bridge amid rumours of a close-season move to Real Madrid. ""I am only thinking to win something for this club,"" said Hazard when asked if the final will be his last game for the club. ""If it is my last game I will try to do everything. In my mind I don't know yet."" Having already qualified for next season's Champions League when they guaranteed a top-four finish in the Premier League last weekend, Chelsea can bring an uplifting end to Sarri's troubled first season in charge by lifting the Europa League. Former Napoli boss Sarri this week claimed Chelsea ""deserve"" to win a trophy this season and the Italian is now one victory away from the first major prize of his managerial career. However, Sarri is not happy that Chelsea will play a friendly in the United States against New England Revolution next week. The match is designed to raise awareness and money for antisemitism and anti-discrimination causes. ""Now we need to rest. Unfortunately we have to go play in the United States because I think in this moment we need to rest then we have 10 days to prepare the final,"" said Sarri. ""We have to recover energy because we are very tired."" Inevitably, Hazard was the catalyst for Chelsea's 28th minute opener as he twisted and turned to find just enough space for a perfectly-weighted pass to Loftus-Cheek.

One of the duo, Alvaro Oliveira, posted a picture of himself in front of a signpost for Frankfurt (O) - Frankfurt on the Oder, near the east German border with Poland. As Instagram users quickly pointed out, the Portuguese pair were 610 kilometres (379 miles), roughly a six-hour drive, away from Frankfurt, Main - where the match is taking place at the Commerzbank Arena. ""Now we have a further six-hour drive,"" Oliveira glumly admitted in a video post. Benfica hold a 4-2 advantage in the tie after winning the first leg in Lisbon."

In March, Frankfurt revealed that the loan deal included the option to buy Jovic for around seven million euros ($7.9m). On Wednesday, they announced that they had done so, with Jovic signing a contract which would keep him at the club until 2023. ""Luka's development has been very pleasing and for us there was no question that we wanted to bind him to the club long term,"" said Frankfurt sporting director Fredi Bobic in a statement. ""He is a player with extraordinary abilities."" With several of Europe's top clubs reportedly considering making a bid for Jovic, it is still unclear whether the Serbian will stay at Frankfurt beyond this season, or whether the club will decide to sell him on at a substantial profit. Last week, Jovic's father told German newspaper Bild that his son wanted to stay in Frankfurt."
45,11/04/2019,11:09,"Barca target Jovic to stay at Frankfurt, says father",The father of Eintracht Frankfurt star striker Luka Jovic has told German newspaper Bild that his son will snub Barcelona and stay at the Bundesliga club next season.,"Serbian striker Jovic, 21, has been linked with several of Europe's top clubs after a breakthrough season in which he has scored 24 goals and fired Frankfurt into the last eight of the Europa League. Ahead of Frankfurt's quarter-final first leg with Benfica on Thursday, Jovic's father said that, while Spanish giants Barcelona have made an approach, his son is more likely to stay at Frankfurt next season. ""Luka has had requests, including one from Barcelona, but is not interested,"" Milan Jovic told Bild on Thursday. ""He doesn't know if he can play football there -- he wants to get to the Champions League with Eintracht and stay there."" ""He came to me a few days ago and said 'Dad, it's not about the money, I want to play football'."" ""He is very close friends with the other young players in the team."" Frankfurt are currently on course for a top four finish in the Bundesliga, which would see them qualify for the Champions League next season. Jovic himself has said that he would be open to staying at Frankfurt if the team make it into Europe's top competition. ""I would like to play here next season. If we get to the Champions League, they will find it hard to get rid of me,"" he told Bild earlier this season. Though Jovic is technically on loan from Benfica, Frankfurt confirmed in March that they have the option to buy him this sumer for ""less than seven million euros"" ($7.9m). With clubs such as Barcelona reportedly prepared to pay much more, Frankfurt hope either to hold on to their star striker or sell him on at a substantial profit. Yet Jovic's father told Bild that his son has always been grounded and turned down offers from Borussia Dortmund, Schalke and Arsenal as a boy."
46,09/04/2019,14:10,Frankfurt sensation Jovic out for revenge against Benfica,In-demand Eintracht Frankfurt striker Luka Jovic hopes to show Benfica what they are missing when he faces his old club in Thursday's Europa League quarter-final clash in Lisbon.,"Jovic joined Frankfurt on-loan two years ago after being made surplus to requirements at Benfica. But the 21-year-old has blossomed beyond all expectation in Germany, and is now coveted by Europe's top clubs. ""Luka is a real goal machine,"" Frankfurt coach Adi Huetter told Austrian newspaper Kleine Zeitung on Tuesday. At Benfica, Jovic was banished to the reserve team for disciplinary reasons. It has been a different story at Frankfurt, where he has scored 17 goals in 26 league games this season to keep his team on course for a top-four finish. He scored his seventh Europa League goal at San Siro last month to knock out Inter Milan and set up a last-eight rendez-vous with his former club Benfica. ""As soon as Luka found out that we were playing Benfica, you could see how happy he was,"" said Huetter last month. ""To go back and play somewhere where you didn't make it gives you extra motivation."" Although Jovic is still officially a Benfica player, the Portuguese club cannot hope to profit indirectly from the Serbian's success. His loan deal allows Frankfurt to sign him permanently for under 7 million euros ($7.9m). A much smaller fee than what Europe's top clubs could offer for him. ""Obviously teams like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City are angling to sign him,"" coach Huetter told Kleine Zeitung on Tuesday. ""It's normal that the big clubs want to fish in our pond."" For now, however, Jovic hopes to stick it to his former club and move Frankfurt a step closer to the Europa League final in Baku. If Huetter's side do get that far, it may scupper their plans for a post-season marketing tour in Asia. Frankfurt are scheduled to play fellow Bundesliga side Wolfsburg on a week-long trip to China between May 22 and 27. Yet with the Europa League final scheduled for May 29, their plans may change if Jovic fires them to European glory."

""The boys (striker Augustin and midfielder Mukiele) will be back in the squad for training tomorrow and I hope they paid attention to this warning,"" said Rangnick after the draw in Frankfurt. ""The topic is now closed for us and we are looking forward to Wednesday's league game against VfB Stuttgart."" Hosts Frankfurt went ahead against Leipzig when Swiss midfielder Gelson Fernandes took advantage of disruption in the Leipzig defence to score the opening goal on 26 minutes with RB centre-back Wili Orban off the pitch. The burly Leipzig defender was being treated for injury on the sidelines when Fernandes fired home a rebound after a save from Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi. Germany striker Timo Werner then wasted a chance to equalise late in the first half, but the Leipzig forward mistimed his header and sent the ball over. After a determined start to the second half, Leipzig were rewarded when Forsberg equalised from the penalty spot on 54 minutes after his cross had been handled by Filip Kostic. The opportunities then came thick and fast for Leipzig as Forsberg fired wide from close range and Werner was unable to convert a late chance. Earlier, rising Germany star Kai Havertz ended Bayer Leverkusen's miserable losing start to the season with a second-half winner to seal a 1-0 victory over Mainz and escape the Bundesliga's bottom three. Havertz, 19, who made his Germany debut in the 2-1 friendly win against Peru earlier this month, claimed his first Bundesliga goal of the season with a powerful header midway through the first half. After losing their first three games of 2018/19, Leverkusen climbed up to 15th, leaving bottom side Schalke, who were beaten 2-0 at home by league leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday, as the only team in Germany's top flight to have lost all four games this season. However, Leverkusen made hard work of the win at their own BayArena. Only an intervention by the video assistant referee denied Mainz the opening goal just after the break when their Sweden striker Robin Quaison, who had just come on, headed the ball into the net, but replays showed the ball clipped his hand in the build-up. After the let off, Leverkusen took their chance to claim their first win of the season when Havertz headed home a cross from his Germany team-mate Julian Brandt on 62 minutes. Ridle Baku, 20, fired wide with a late chance for Mainz, who suffered their first defeat of the season to drop to seventh."

Danny Welbeck nodded in a second just after half-time and Aubameyang curled in the Gunners' third, with Mesut Ozil also on target before a lapse in concentration saw Vorskla hit back with two late goals. ""I think we played well in the first half and in the beginning of the second as well,"" Aubameyang told BT Sport. ""We have to improve and try to fight not to concede a goal like we did in the last minute."" Premier League leaders Chelsea made a winning start to their Group L campaign as Willian's seventh-minute effort was enough to see off PAOK at a hostile Toumba Stadium. Eden Hazard was omitted from the Chelsea squad at his own request due to fatigue, but manager Maurizio Sarri fielded a strong side as the Blues extended their winning run to six games in all competitions. ""We were in control of the match for 90 minutes. We had a lot of opportunities. We missed them and so I'm very happy with the three points, very happy with the performance, but not very happy with the result,"" said Sarri. ""When it's time to kill the match, we have to kill the match."" Steven Gerrard's Rangers acquitted themselves well on their first appearance in the group stage of a European competition since the 2010-11 Champions League, as they came away with a 2-2 draw against Villarreal. A disastrous start for the Glasgow side saw Carlos Bacca fire Villarreal ahead inside 60 seconds, but Scott Arfield turned home a cross from Daniel Candeias to level on 67 minutes. Gerard Moreno put the hosts back in front almost immediately, only for Kyle Lafferty to again hit back for Rangers as Gerrard's men made a solid start in Group G. Leigh Griffiths hit a late winner for Celtic in a 1-0 home victory over Rosenborg, a team Brendan Rodgers' side knocked out in this season's Champions League qualifying rounds. Salzburg triumphed in the clash of Red Bulls in the other Group B fixture as Fredrik Gulbrandsen scored a minute from time to give the Austrian club a 3-2 victory over RB Leipzig. Marseille, last season's runners-up, slumped to a 2-1 home defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt in Group H as Luka Jovic grabbed an 89th-minute winner for the reigning German Cup champions. Lucas Ocampos opened the scoring early for Marseille, who were playing behind closed doors at the Stade Velodrome after numerous crowd incidents last season. But Lucas Torro levelled on 52 minutes for Eintracht before Jovic's late strike won it. Dudelange, the first Luxembourg team to play in the Europa League group stage, made seven-time European champions AC Milan work hard for a 1-0 win in Group F. Luxembourg's Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa were in the crowd as Dudelange, who have a dozen non-professional players in their squad, succumbed to a deflected second-half goal by Gonzalo Higuain. Record five-time winners Sevilla launched their Group J campaign with a 5-1 rout of Standard Liege, as Ever Banega and Wissam Ben Yedder both netted twice for the Spaniards."

Jones, 38, scored four goals in 69 caps for the US squad after switching nations from Germany after playing for under-20 and under-21 sides. His lone World Cup for the Americans came in 2014, when he netted an equalizer against Portugal in a 2-2 draw. In MLS, Jones had his best success with the New England Revolution, reaching the 2014 MLS Cup final before losing to the Los Angeles Galaxy. He later played for the Colorado Rapids and the Galaxy."

Frankfurt recruited Trapp hours before the transfer window closed in Germany and France at 1800 local time (1600 GMT) and he could feature in Saturday's home Bundesliga game against Werder Bremen. Trapp, Germany's third-choice goalkeeper behind Manuel Neuer and Marc-Andre ter Stegen, also found himself third in the pecking order at PSG behind Gianluigi Buffon and Alphonse Areola this season. He jumped at the chance to rejoin Frankfurt for 2018/19. ""When I was in Paris, I always liked to remember the great times back in Frankfurt,"" said Trapp, who has made three appearances for Germany since June 2017. ""The contact never broke and I was very happy for Eintracht when they won the German Cup,"" he added, referring to Frankfurt's shock 3-1 win against Bayern Munich in the final in May. ""It's important for me to be in an environment where I feel comfortable and where I can play."" Trapp, who was part of Germany's World Cup squad which crashed out in the group stages, could go straight into Frankfurt's starting side as their Danish first-choice keeper Frederik Ronnow is carrying a knee injury. ""The current knee problems of Frederik Ronnow caused us to rethink things,"" said Eintracht's director of sport Bruno Huebner. ""Unfortunately, he suffered a knee injury in pre-season, which is not completely healed and is bothering him. ""We are convinced that he will grow into the role of number one, but we had the chance to sign a goalkeeper, who is not only ready to play, but also figure strongly identified with the club."""
51,12/08/2018,22:34,Lewandowski hat-trick leads Bayern to Frankfurt cup revenge,"A brilliant hat-trick from Robert Lewandowski led Bayern Munich to a comfortable 5-0 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt in Sunday's German Supercup, giving former Frankfurt coach Niko Kovac a memorable start to his reign at the Bavarian giants.","Kovac returned to Frankfurt for his first competitive game in charge of the Bundesliga winners, having ended two successful years at Eintracht with a shock win over Bayern in last season's German Cup final. Yet there was no time for sentimentality on Sunday, as Bayern took brutal revenge for their cup humiliation, Lewandowski leaving the Frankfurt defence in tatters. A ruthless Bayern took the lead with their first chance on 21 minutes. Joshua Kimmich's cross picked out Lewandowski at the far post and the Polish star fired a header across Frederik Roennow in the Frankfurt goal. The striker nodded in a second from almost exactly the same position five minutes later, heading Arjen Robben's corner past the stranded Roennow. The game could have turned in Frankfurt's favour just before half-time when Mats Hummels escaped with a yellow card after bringing down Mijat Gacinovic in front of goal. At the other end, Lewandowski faced increasingly rough treatment from the Frankfurt defence, and Eintracht captain David Abraham was also lucky to escape a red card when he appeared to elbow the Polish striker late in the game. There was no stopping Lewandowski, however, who danced free of Abraham to rifle in his third goal on 54 minutes. Kovac's perfect evening was sealed in the 63rd minute when Kingsley Coman bundled in Bayern's fourth. The new Bayern coach had focused on low crosses in training the week before, and watched happily on as David Alaba's low cross found Coman at the far post to make it 4-0. Thiago delivered the final flourish five minutes from time, gratefully receiving a pass from Coman to slot home Bayern's fifth. Sandro Wagner could even have made it six, missing an open goal from two yards out, but that didn't stop Bayern celebrating a winning start under Kovac and a successfully defended Supercup title."

Another Ghanaian, Kwadwo Asamoah, shed tears after playing his final match for Italian champions Juventus. VICTOR MOSES (Chelsea) There was no happier Chelsea star than the Nigerian after he helped the London club edge Manchester United 1-0 in the FA Cup final at Wembley. Last year, Chelsea lost the final against Arsenal and Moses was sent off. The 27-year-old wing-back now has English Premier League, FA Cup and Europa League winners medals. NORDIN AMRABAT (Leganes) He ensured lowly Leganes finished their La Liga season on a high by scoring the winner in a thrilling 3-2 win over Real Betis. Amrabat, who will be at the World Cup with Morocco next month, sent a driven shot inside the bottom corner in the 79th minute as Leganes sealed a surprise victory. KWADWO ASAMOAH (Juventus) Asamoah left the pitch at Turin's Allianz Stadium in tears after playing his final game for Italian champions Juventus in a 2-1 win over Verona. The 29-year-old was comforted by Czech legend Pavel Nedved, now on the club's management, on the sidelines. Asamoah, 29, joined Juventus from Udinese in 2012 and won 13 trophies, including six Serie A titles, and was twice runner-up in the Champions League. It is reported the midfielder will join Inter Milan once his contract expires next month. SEKO FOFANA (Udinese) Ivorian Fofana scored the only goal after half an hour as Udinese finished their season with a win over Bologna. Czech midfielder Antonin Barak set up Fofana for the club's 48th goal of the season. BASTOS (Lazio) Angolan defender Bastos came on as a substitute in a crucial clash against Inter Milan for Champions League football next season, but the 26-year-old struggled to make an impact. Two late goals gave Inter elite European football next season as Lazio dropped to the Europa League. KALIDOU KOULIBALY (Napoli)/SIMY (Crotone) Senegal defender Koulibaly -- reported to be a target of English clubs Chelsea and Arsenal -- closed down fellow World Cup-bound Nigerian forward 'Simy' in the clash between the African players' teams which Napoli won 2-1 to condemn Crotone to Serie B football next season. 'Simy' had scored seven of his side's 21 goals this season, but they return to the lower division after two seasons. MOUSSA KONATE (Amiens) The 25-year-old capped an excellent individual season by scoring in Amiens' final-day 2-1 loss at Marseille. The striker celebrated his call-up for Senegal's World Cup squad by slotting home his 13th Ligue 1 goal of the season and third in three games after a double against champions Paris Saint-Germain two weeks ago. FRANCOIS KAMANO (Bordeaux) Guinean forward Kamano scored the third goal in Bordeaux's 4-0 thrashing of bottom club Metz, which secured the Girondins a Europa League place. The 22-year-old finished the season on a red-hot streak of form with five goals in seven games. MAX GRADEL (Toulouse) The Ivory Coast international scored his eighth goal of the season in a 2-1 win over Guingamp, although Toulouse will face a two-leg play-off with Ajaccio to retain their Ligue 1 status. Gradel scored the opening goal on the hour when he capped a lethal counter-attack with a tidy finish over Karl-Johan Johnsson. BRICE SAMBA (Caen) The Congo-Brazzaville native kept a vital clean sheet in a 0-0 draw at home to champions Paris Saint-Germain that guaranteed Caen remained in the top division.

Eintracht coach Niko Kovac claimed his first trophy as a coach in his last match at the club. He is leaving the Frankfurt side to succeed Heynckes at Bayern next season. However, several Bayern stars left a bad impression by storming off the playing area after receiving their runners-up medals at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. They broke protocol by not waiting to see Frankfurt lift the trophy and Heynckes was forced to deny the ""bad losers"" accusations. ""That was really a misunderstanding,"" insisted Heynckes. ""I would have expected that a person in charge of FC Bayern or the German FA would have told us to wait until the trophy was presented. ""At that moment, I did not even think about it, otherwise I would have asked my team to stay."" Only a few Bayern players lingered for the trophy presentation alongside Bayern's sports director Hasan Salihamidzic. Nevertheless, the night belonged to Kovac and Frankfurt. In a dramatic finish, Rebic sealed the win by scoring his second goal on 82 minutes after floating his shot over Bayern goalkeeper Sven Ulreich. The goal stood despite an intervention by the video assistant referee. Both Kovac and Heynckes later said Bayern should have been awarded a late penalty when Javi Martinez was fouled in the dying minutes. ""It was a penalty, but we shouldn't start criticising,"" added Heynckes, while Kovac admitted: ""I have to say -- it was a penalty"". However, Gacinovic got the party started for the Frankfurt fans by sprinting the length of the field to tap into an open goal from a Bayern corner for the third goal just before the whistle. ""I'm proud, my boys gave their all -- and I mean all. Now Eintracht can celebrate their first trophy for 30 years,"" beamed Kovac after Frankfurt's first cup final win since 1988. The former Bayern midfielder shed tears of joy as he signed off with silverware after two years at Eintracht, who lost last year's cup final to Borussia Dortmund. ""Anyone who knows me knows that I am an emotional person and I let the tears flow. They were tears of relief after two years fighting to be successful again,"" he said. ""We have continually improved from near relegation to cup final to cup final winners... It's awesome what we have achieved here in the last few years,"" he added. ""I am just pleased we managed to win it as the underdogs."" This was supposed to be Heynckes' farewell party. Bayern wanted to send their 73-year-old head coach into retirement with the German cup and league double, having already wrapped up a sixth straight Bundesliga title. But Heynckes was left lamenting Bayern's wasted chances as both Lewandowski and centre-back Mats Hummels hit the woodwork in either half. ""Congratulations to Eintracht. They played with ambition, were aggressive and hard in the tackle,"" said Heynckes. ""We lost the ball in a dangerous area (before the first goal) and it was no wonder we fell behind. ""We had a few problems in midweek with Joshua Kimmich and Thomas Mueller both being ill, but that is no excuse... We should have had the ability to win the game."" ""It's a pity, but you have to be able to call up your full qualities in a game like this and we didn't manage it,"" he added. Frankfurt players interrupted Kovac's post-match press conference by showering him with beer. ""I am happy that we have won the cup after 30 years,"" said goal-scorer Rebic. ""The team deserves it, Bayern are always the favourites, but at the end... (we) won the cup."""
54,19/05/2018,22:14,Frankfurt ruin Heynckes farewell,Ante Rebic ruined Jupp Heynckes' farewell as Bayern Munich coach on Saturday with the Croatia striker scoring twice as Eintracht Frankfurt claimed an upset 3-1 win in the German Cup final.,"The victory gave Eintracht boss Niko Kovac his first trophy as a coach in his final match before leaving to take over from Heynckes at Bayern. After Rebic's opening goal, Robert Lewandowski equalised for Munich early in the second half. However, Rebic added his late second before substitute Mijat Gacinovic tapped into an empty net just before the whistle to delight Frankfurt fans and break Bayern's hearts. This was supposed to be Heynckes' farewell party with Bayern sending their 73-year-old head coach into retirement with the German cup and league double having wrapped up a sixth straight Bundesliga title. Instead Rebic and Frankfurt grabbed the glory at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Bayern made a bright start in the capital when Lewandowski hit the underside of the Frankfurt bar with just eight minutes gone. However, Frankfurt scored from their first clear chance. When Bayern midfielder James Rodriguez was robbed of possession in midfield, Kevin-Prince Boateng threaded a pass through to Rebic. The Croatia striker dodged the challenges of Bayern centre-backs Niklas Suele and Mats Hummels to plant his shot past Bayern keeper Sven Ulreich with 11 minutes gone. The shock goal sent a ripple of panic through the Bayern ranks as it was the third straight game they have fallen behind. Bayern went close with 25 minutes gone when Lewandowski fired wide of the empty goal after Franck Ribery and Thomas Mueller had already opened up the Eintracht defence. It should have been 2-0 to Eintracht eight minutes before half-time when Rebic squared for Jonathan De Guzman, who was unmarked, but the midfielder stumbled with the goal at his mercy. Tempers started to fray as Frankfurt defender Jetro Willems was booked for body-checking Joshua Kimmich but it stayed 1-0 at the break. Bayern drew level on 53 minutes when Suele combined with Kimmich, who picked out Lewandowski near the penalty spot to slot home the equaliser. However, Frankfurt -- and Rebic -- were not to be denied. The Croatia international burst in between Suele and Hummels and brilliantly lifted the ball over Ulreich. The referee checked the replay on advice of the video assistant referee, but the goal stood to make it 2-1 on 82 minutes. Bayern had calls for a penalty after a foul on Javi Martinez deep into added time turned down. With all Munich players in the Eintracht half, Frankfurt sealed the victory when Gacinovic got on the end of a Bayern corner, sprinted the length of the pitch to slot into an empty net in the 96th minute. The Eintracht squad mobbed the 23-year-old and the referee blew the whistle to trigger the Frankfurt party."

Huetter can sign off after three years with Bern by winning the Swiss Cup when his team face FC Zurich in the final on May 27. Kovac will take charge of his final game as Eintracht Frankfurt coach on Saturday in the German Cup final at Berlin's Olympic stadium against his future club Bayern, who he will join for 2018/19."
56,04/05/2018,02:10,Hamburg adopt knock-out mentality for survival fight,"Midfielder Lewis Holtby says Hamburg must treat Saturday's match at Eintracht Frankfurt as ""a cup semi-final"" if they want to avoid a historic first relegation from the Bundesliga.","Second-bottom Hamburg are five points from safety with two league games left -- at Eintracht Frankfurt and then at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach -- as they bid to avoid slipping out of the top flight for the first time. But they sit just two points behind Wolfsburg, who occupy 16th place, which provides the solace of a relegation play-off against the team who finish third in the second tier. Holtby says, from a Hamburg perspective, those remaining games against clubs fighting for European places next season are effectively knock-out matches. ""This is our 'semi-final',"" said Holtby, who has scored four goals in Hamburg's last five games to breathe life into their survival hopes. ""We aren't dead yet. I believe 100 percent that we can rescue things."" Hamburg are the only club to have played in every season since the Bundesliga was established in 1963 -- when even mighty Bayern Munich were still a second-division club. A seven-point gap at the start of April has been slashed by wins over fellow strugglers Freiburg, 1-0 at home a fortnight ago, and Wolfsburg, 3-1 away last Saturday. Three wins in their last four games have given belief to Hamburg's players and fans alike, but they need Wolfsburg to drop more points. Moreover, they are facing a Frankfurt side eager to bounce back from a 4-1 mauling at champions Bayern Munich, which followed a 3-0 home defeat by Hertha Berlin. ""We have not achieved anything yet, if we want to get over the line, then we need further victories,"" said Christian Titz, Hamburg's third coach since January. Hamburg have fallen on hard times in recent seasons, needing to win the relegation play-off in both 2013/14 and 2014/15 to stay up. This season has been a disaster. Hamburg were second from bottom with 15 points from 19 games when Markus Gisdol was sacked as head coach in late January. Former player Bernd Hollerbach took over, but was soon dismissed after failing to win any of his seven games, admitting ""we need a miracle"". Titz was promoted from the reserves and the 47-year-old has coaxed three wins from his six games to turn the corner. ""We are playing a totally different style of football, the coach has his own ideas and sticks to them,"" enthused midfielder Aaron Hunt. Hamburg need Wolfsburg to slip up either this Saturday at RB Leipzig, who are winless in their last five games and fighting to keep a Europa League place, or at home to Cologne, who are already relegated. Having already had their relegation confirmed last weekend, bottom side Cologne host champions Bayern Munich, who are licking their wounds after their agonising Champions League exit in midweek. Bayern, who sealed a sixth straight league title last month, hold a massive 24-point lead in the table. Coach Jupp Heynckes is sure to rotate after they drew 2-2 at Real Madrid on Wednesday to lose their Champions League semi-final 4-3 on aggregate. Saturday's fixtures (all 1330 GMT) Borussia Dortmund v Mainz, RB Leipzig v Wolfsburg, Cologne v Bayern Munich, Werder Bremen v Bayer Leverkusen, Borussia Moenchengladbach v Freiburg, Eintracht Frankfurt v Hamburg, Augsburg v Schalke, Hanover 96 v Hertha Berlin, Stuttgart v Hoffenheim"
57,16/04/2018,18:12,Schalke sacking was a 'punch in face' says Boateng,"Eintracht Frankfurt midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng says his departure from Schalke felt ""like a punch in the face"" with the clubs to clash in Wednesday's German Cup semi-final.","Boateng, 31, still carries bad memories after being released by Schalke in December 2015, six months after he was suspended over a ""lack of mutual trust"", as the club put it. Boateng did not see eye-to-eye with Schalke's then-coach Roberto Di Matteo. Now he has the chance to avenge his departure with a win at Gelsenkirchen in Wednesday's semi. ""It's the place I have thought the most about - it was like a punch in the face,"" he told sport1.de. ""It showed me the reality that everything is wonderful when it runs smoothly. And if not, you will be dropped. ""That was the (low) point for me. ""And I can be proud today that I came out of there and could turn all that power, sadness, energy and aggressiveness into something positive."" He said it had opened his eyes to how fast things can go in the football business world. ""Sometimes it's just better to split up, because then you can make a fresh start."" Boateng wants to beat his ex-club to put Frankfurt in their second German Cup final in as many years. Bayern Munich face Bayer Leverkusen away in Tuesday's other last four clash. ""Schalke has shown this year that the team plays at a very high level,"" said Boateng. ""Even if it's not always pretty, they know how to bring home, or keep, the points. ""That's what makes them outstanding. ""I hope we learned our lesson that a 2-0 lead is not enough,"" he added. Schalke, under current coach Domenico Tedesco, came from two-goals down to claim a 2-2 draw in Frankfurt in the league last December. Boateng has been a driving force in Frankfurt's midfield this season after quitting Spanish side Las Palmas last August for family reasons. After Schalke sacked him, Boateng rebuilt his career at AC Milan before a season at Las Palmas. He has rediscovered his best form this season under Frankfurt's head coach Niko Kovac, a former team-mate at Hertha Berlin. Frankfurt crashed to a 4-1 league defeat at Leverkusen on Saturday, the day after it emerged Kovac will coach Bayern next season. ""At the end of the day, we know that's football -- it can happen,"" Boateng said after defeat dropped Frankfurt to seventh -- outside the European places for next season. ""We did a great job up to now and we want to finish the season the way we started it. ""We want to reach our targets and we'll see what's going to happen with the rest."""
58,14/04/2018,18:07,Bayern-bound Kovac sees Frankfurt crash at Leverkusen,"Niko Kovac insisted Eintracht Frankfurt won't use his appointment as Bayern Munich coach next season as an excuse, despite their 4-1 thrashing at Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday.","Frankfurt's plans for next season were thrown into chaos on Friday when Bundesliga champions Bayern confirmed Kovac, 46, will join them to replace Jupp Heynckes as coach in 2018/19. ""Trainers and players come and go, my team will not use this as an excuse,"" Frankfurt coach Kovac told Sky. ""Everyone is professional enough, because we know we can achieve a European place next year - I am convinced of that."" However, the performance at the BayArena did not back up Kovac's words as Frankfurt's Champions League hopes suffered a heavy blow. This was the first time this season Frankfurt have conceded four goals. Germany hopeful Kevin Volland boosted his chances of making Joachim Loew's World Cup squad, to be named on May 15, with a hat-trick for Leverkusen. The thrashing left Frankfurt sixth, five points from fourth-placed Leverkusen -- and a Champions League place -- with four games left. Germany international Julian Brandt gave Leverkusen the lead with a deft header -- his first in the Bundesliga -- on 20 minutes. Frankfurt drew level just three minutes later when Mexico midfielder Marco Fabian rounded the goalkeeper to finish a move started by Kevin-Prince Boateng. When teenage winger Kai Havertz threaded a pass through the Frankfurt defence, Volland tucked his shot into the bottom corner on 71 minutes to make it 2-1. The floodgates opened soon after. Volland's second goal came six minutes later when Brandt broke through the middle and played Karim Bellarabi in behind the defence. The winger handed Volland a simple tap-in, and the striker then claimed his 14th goal of the season to wrap up his hat-trick. Bellarabi beat the defence and again served up another a goal for Volland two minutes before the final whistle. The win cements Leverkusen's grip on fourth place and gives them a five-point cushion over Hoffenheim, in fifth, and Frankfurt, who are in the Europa League places. The victory boosts Leverkusen ahead of Tuesday's German Cup semi-final at home to Bayern. Elsewhere, the bottom two clubs Hamburg and Cologne suffered defeats to edge closer towards relegation. Bottom side Cologne suffered a 2-1 away defeat to mid-table Hertha Berlin at the Olympic Stadium. Leon Bittencourt gave Cologne the lead, but Hertha came back with two goals as Davie Selke netted twice in the second half. Hamburg stumbled to a 2-0 defeat at Hoffenheim as Serge Gnabry and Adam Szalai netted first-half goals in Sinsheim. Hanover 96 snatched a point at Stuttgart as striker Niclas Fuellkrug equalised in the 91st minute after Erik Thommy gave the hosts the lead just after the break. Later on Saturday, newly-crowned Bundesliga champions Bayern host Borussia Moenchengladbach at the Allianz Arena looking to build on their 20-point lead."

""I should have been called Kelvin, that would have been a top name: Kelvin-Prince."" ""That was a mistake on the birth certificate - no one knows that. ""I wouldn't have had to play football then, because that name alone is already stellar, and then they wrote it wrong in the hospital. ""That's why I am called Kevin and it stayed that way. ""My mum had surgery right after the birth and couldn't intervene."" The 30-year-old, the half-brother of Germany star Jerome Boateng, has played all 11 Bundesliga games for Eintracht since joining in August after a hurried departure for family reasons from Spanish club Las Palmas. Boateng has played for AC Milan, Portsmouth, Tottenham Hotspur, Hertha Berlin and Schalke in a colourful career. He made the last of his 15 appearances for Ghana at the 2014 World Cup, but left the tournament under a dark cloud after a row with the then coach."

He will now undergo surgery, which Eintracht say will determine how long he will be sidelined for."
61,21/10/2017,19:24,Dortmund throw away two-goal lead in Frankfurt draw,Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund threw away a two-goal lead in their 2-2 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday after another mistake by goalkeeper Roman Burki triggered the hosts' fightback.,"Dortmund are winless in their last three games after also losing 3-2 at home to RB Leipzig last Saturday in the Bundesliga and drawing 1-1 at Cypriot side APOEL on Tuesday in the Champions League. On Friday, Dortmund's Swiss shot-stopper Burki extended his contract at Dortmund until 2021. It was a vote of confidence by the club after Burki endured sharp criticism for a mistake which allowed APOEL to take a shock lead in the Champions League draw. Before kick-off, sporting director Michael Zorc told Sky that Burki has Dortmund's full backing, but another mistake by their goalkeeper in Frankfurt allowed Eintracht back in the game. Goals by Turkey international Nuri Sahin and winger Maximilian Philipp either side of the break put Dortmund 2-0 up, but Eintracht roared back with two goals in four second-half minutes. French striker Sebastien Haller slotted home a penalty on 64 minutes before midfielder Marius Wolf levelled shortly after. ""That shouldn't happen, if you lead 2-0 you shouldn't allow an open game,"" said Sahin. Dortmund stay top on 20 points, just three ahead of defending champions Bayern Munich, who are at strugglers Hamburg later on Saturday, and one ahead of RB Leipzig, who won 1-0 at home to VfB Stuttgart. Frankfurt's Ante Rebic had a goal disallowed for offside just before Dortmund went in front as Marc Bartra's long-range pass was converted on 19 minutes by Sahin, who sprinted 80 metres to celebrate with Burki. Philipp had made it 2-0 when he fired home Mario Goetze's pass on 57 minutes, but Frankfurt were then handed a route back into the game when Burki brought down Rebic, and Haller fired home the spot-kick. With Dortmund's defence struggling, midfielder Wolf curled home the equaliser on 68 minutes. In pushing to restore the lead, Dortmund gave a Bundesliga debut to 17-year-old ex-Manchester City midfielder Jadon Sancho, who was released by England from the Under-17 World Cup in India. Frankfurt's point could have come at a price as USA wide man Timothy Chandler limped off with a knee injury on 37 minutes. Dortmund coach Peter Bosz defended his decision to bring on defender Dan-Axel Zagadou for Germany midfielder Julian Weigl -- converted to a centre-back to cover for injuries -- just before Frankfurt scored twice. ""We simply weren't really playing at that point, so I took off a defender. We wanted some calm,"" explained the Dutchman. ""We had lots of chances to go 3-0 up -- we just didn't take them."" RB Leipzig, who face Bayern twice next week -- at home on Wednesday in the German Cup, then away next Saturday in the Bundesliga -- followed their midweek Champions League victory over Porto with a narrow win against Stuttgart. Midfielder Marcel Sabitzer netted the winner midway through the first half when his shot looped over Stuttgart's Germany goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler. Meanwhile, Bayer Leverkusen are ninth after a stunning 5-1 romp at Borussia Moenchengladbach. US international Fabian Johnson gave Gladbach a seventh-minute lead after meeting Thorgan Hazard's cross at the far post. However, Leverkusen roared back with five second-half goals, four of which came in a dazzling 21-minute spell, through Sven Bender, Leon Bailey, Julian Brandt, Kevin Volland and Joel Pohjanpalo. Michael Gregoritsch's long-range shot gave Augsburg a first-half lead at home against Hanover 96, but substitute Niclas Fuellkrug scored two second-half goals as the visitors came back to win 2-1."

Second-placed Borussia Dortmund romped to a 5-1 win at home against Wolfsburg to trim Bayern's lead at the top to five points with two games left. Bayern are away to mid-table Ingolstadt next Saturday, then host relegated Hanover on the final day of the season in a fortnight. The draw with Gladbach comes three days before Tuesday's crunch Champions League home semi-final against Atletico Madrid with Bayern having lost the first leg 1-0 away last Wednesday. ""Of course, we had wanted to win today, for our fans and for ourselves,"" said Guardiola. ""We need just a point now, a draw, or a win to secure the title. ""But now there's time to concentrate on Atletico Madrid, it will be a different game on Tuesday. We must play better."" Bayern were punished for sitting back after Mueller's sixth-minute headed opener. Gladbach, one of only two clubs to beat Bayern in the German league this season, hit back when Hahn slotted home on 72 minutes having gone close just moments before. A superb pass from Lars Stindl put Hahn in behind the Bayern defence and he wrong-footed Medhi Benatia before firing his shot past Manuel Neuer. There was some good news for Bayern as Jerome Boateng played his first game since January. The Germany defender is now in line to face Diego Simeone's Atletico with a place in the Champions League final on May 28 at stake. In Dortmund, Borussia hammered Wolfsburg with Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa scoring their first and creating their second before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang came off the bench to score twice. The Gabon striker now has 25 league goals this season, leaving him two short of Bayern's Robert Lewandowski. Dortmund took the lead when Henrikh Mkhitaryan's bullet pass was deflected home by Kagawa, who then set up Ramos to leave Dortmund 2-0 up inside nine minutes. Marco Reus grabbed their third by chipping home with an hour gone. Aubameyang replaced Ramos on 69 minutes and scored his first just eight minutes later when Mkhitaryan's pass found him unmarked to header home, then netted a second header just a minute later before Wolfsburg's Andre Schuerrle scored a consolation. At the other end of the table, Hanover 96's relegation was confirmed by their 3-1 defeat to Schalke. Eintracht Frankfurt boosted their survival hopes with a 2-1 win at Darmstadt to go 16th, which carries a two-legged promotion/relegation play-off at the end of the season. But 17th-placed Werder Bremen can push Frankfurt back down the table if they beat VfB Stuttgart, who are 15th, at home on Monday in a crunch relegation battle. Mid-table Hamburg played out a goalless draw at home to Mainz, who stay seventh and on course for a Europa League place. Hoffenheim looked to have escaped relegation under 28-year-old coach Julian Nagelsmann, the youngest in the Bundesliga's history, and they are four points from the drop zone, after their 2-1 win at home to Ingolstadt."

The ex-Manchester United and Real Madrid striker has scored 16 goals in 25 league games. Bayer must wait to see if 'Chicharito' will be able to play in their remaining four league games, which include tough matches at Schalke and home to Hertha Berlin. Leverkusen doubled their lead when Julian Brandt converted a superb cross from Germany winger Karim Bellarabi, who had sprinted away from the Frankfurt defence. Bellarabi added a third when he hit the left-hand corner from 20 metres out with 90 minutes played, to leave Frankfurt second from bottom. Leverkusen claim third from Hertha Berlin, who dropped one place after their 2-1 defeat at Hoffenheim. Hertha, who are bidding for a first Champions League place since the 1999/2000 season, are winless in their last three games. Niklas Stark's first-half header was cancelled out by an equaliser from Hoffenheim's Swiss defender Fabian Schaer. Hoffenheim earned the win when Mark Uth headed home at the far post to move his side up to 13th -- three points above the relegation places. Four days after their Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Real Madrid, Wolfsburg lost again when they went down 3-2 at relegation-threatened Werder Bremen. Having lost 3-0 in Madrid, Wolfsburg were well beaten as Claudio Pizarro scored his 102nd goal for Bremen, to become the club's all-time top scorer, by converting a first-half penalty. Wolfsburg's France midfielder Josuha Guilavogui equalised before the break, but Bremen netted goals from Fin Bartels and Mali midfielder Sambou Yatabare. Wolfsburg's director of sport Klaus Allofs was dismissed to the stands early in the second half after arguing with the fourth official. The visitors pulled a late goal back when Dutch striker Bas Dost powered a header home, but Wolfsburg stay eighth. Despite the win, Bremen are in the relegation play-off place, but just three points from 11th place as things remain tight at the bottom. Augsburg stayed just above the relegation places with a 1-0 win at home to VfB Stuttgart as Iceland striker Alfred Finnbogason scored their first-half winner with his fifth goal in 10 games. Mid-table Darmstadt enjoyed a 2-0 win over Ingolstadt, while on Friday bottom side Hanover 96 enjoyed a 2-0 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach, but remain 12 points from safety with four games left. On Saturday night, Bayern Munich can extend their seven-point lead when they host Schalke, while on Sunday second-placed Borussia Dortmund are at home to bogey side Hamburg. Dortmund are winless in their last four league games against Hamburg and lost 3-1 away to Bruno Labbadia's team last November."

Daniel Didavi pulled a goal back for Stuttgart with an hour gone as he recovered from stumbling in the area to chip home while lying on the floor before Brazil winger Douglas Costa blasted in Bayern's late third. The win gave Bayern three more points in their quest to become the first club to win four successive German league titles ahead of their return leg in Benfica with Bayern holding a 1-0 lead. ""Now we need three more (league) wins and a draw in order to create something that no team in Germany has ever managed,"" said Guardiola. Bayern's head coach made five changes from the side which beat Benfica in Munich last Tuesday, but Thomas Mueller came on with only 25 minutes gone to replace Arturo Vidal. The Chilean picked up a rash yellow card for a foul on Didavi and came off as Guardiola looked to boost his midfield. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund at arch-rivals Schalke on Sunday in the Ruhr Valley derby, Bayern took their chance to go eight points clear. But having won their preceding three games by 1-0 margins, this was another laboured display from the Bavarians at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena. ""We had a lot of problems, we attacked well, but we were a bit too lazy and gave away free-kicks and corners,"" added Guardiola. ""We made life complicated for ourselves, but after taking the lead we improved, espcially in the second half, attacking better and the strikers moved more."" Bayern took the lead when Franck Ribery's cross clipped Niedermeier's boot on the way into the Stuttgart net on 31 minutes and the visitors extended their lead when Alaba fired inside the near post on 52 minutes. Mid-table Stuttgart got back in the game when attacking midfielder Didavi, who will play for Wolfsburg next season, managed to lob Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. The goal came despite Didavi being flat on the turf, when the ball fell into his path after a mistimed clearance by Munich striker Robert Lewandowski. In the final ten minutes, Bayern's Thiago hit the crossbar before Costa smashed in their third goal from the edge of the area. Borussia Moenchengladbach stay fourth despite their 1-0 defeat at Ingolstadt. At the bottom, Hoffenheim, coached by 28-year-old Julian Nagelsmann, the youngest ever coach in Germany's top flight, are now three points clear of the relegation places after their 2-0 win at second from bottom Eintracht Frankfurt. Midfielder Nadiem Amiri, who netted just a minute after coming off the bench, and forward Mark Uth scored their second-half goals. Under Nagelsmann, Hoffenheim have now taken 17 points in their last nine games to climb out of the bottom three to 14th. Augsburg escaped the bottom three, and dropped opponents Werder Bremen into the relegation places, with a 2-1 win in north Germany as South Korea defender Hong Jeong-Ho scored their dramatic 87th-minute winner. Mid-table Darmstadt enjoyed a 2-1 win at Hamburg while on Friday Hertha Berlin were held to a 2-2 draw at home to bottom side Hanover."

Lewandowski, the league's top scorer, had a quiet afternoon, failing to add to his tally of 25 Bundesliga goals this season and came off with 19 minutes to go at Munich's Allianz Arena. ""We definitely had the Champions League game against Benfica on Tuesday in our heads,"" Lewandowski admitted openly as they failed to convert their 21 shots into more goals against second-from-bottom Frankfurt. ""We have to play much, much better then than we did today. ""That wasn't a good games for the fans to watch."" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has warned they can ill afford to rely on another super strike from Ribery against the Portuguese league leaders. ""What was most important was the three goals,"" said Rummenigge. ""But skills like that won't be enough on Tuesday. ""(Some of the media) have written the (Benfica) game off as a bye into the next round, but it's not a foregone conclusion. ""We have to play much better and be very concentrated."" Nevertheless, Bayern are five points clear in Germany's top flight with six games left. They remain on course to become the first club to win four straight German league titles. Bayern also claimed a league record with their eighth straight clean sheet against Eintracht Frankfurt. No other club has managed the feat as many times in a row against the same opposition in the Bundesliga. But even Guardiola was talking about Benfica just minutes after the final whistle against Frankfurt. ""I am very impressed with Benfica,"" said the Spaniard. ""Here in Germany, everyone is very confident, but it will be difficult to reach the semi-finals. ""We started well (against Frankfurt) and had some good moves, nt just that crazy goal from Franck.

Bayern claimed a league record with their eighth straight clean sheet against Eintracht Frankfurt -- no other club has managed the feat eight times in a row against the same opposition. Bayern's Robert Lewandowski, the league's top scorer, had a quiet afternoon, failing to add to his tally of 25 Bundesliga goals this season and came off with 19 minutes to go. Frankfurt, who are second from bottom, gave Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who missed Germany's win over Italy with illness on Tuesday, an easy afternoon with barely a shot on goal. Pep Guardiola's Bayern host Benfica on Tuesday and took the chance to go eight points clear in Germany's top flight with second-placed Borussia Dortmund at home to Werder Bremen later. Bremen will be without their top scorer Claudio Pizarro after the Peru international picked up an injury during a World Cup qualifier in Uruguay. South Korea international Koo Ja-Cheol netted for relegation-threatened Augsburg, but could not prevent his club losing 4-2 at Mainz. Argentinian forward Pablo De Blasis and Christian Clemens both scored twice for Mainz at the Coface Arena as the result bumped Mainz up to fifth. Augsburg are only clear of the relegation places on goal difference and are level on 27 points with Frankfurt and Hoffenheim, who host Cologne on Sunday.

Schalke dropped to sixth, and risk losing their Europa League place for next season, after their 3-0 drubbing at Ingolstadt. Ingolstadt's Paraguay striker Dario Lezcano won a penalty and scored their third as the Royal Blues were humbled in Bavaria. Darmstadt pulled themselves two points away from the relegation battle with a 2-2 draw at home to Stuttgart. Sandro Wagner and Peter Niemeyer's goals for Darmstadt were cancelled out by first-half efforts from Stuttgart's Christian Gentner and Lukas Rupp. On Friday, Wolfsburg were hammered 3-0 at Bayer Leverkusen in a poor build-up to Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg at home to Real Madrid.

Kovac has signed a two-year contract, which is only valid for the Bundesliga, and with younger brother Robert, 41, as his assistant, his job is to keep Frankfurt up. ""It must be the goal of Niko Kovac to mobilise the team's strength to stay up,"" said Frankfurt's chairman Heribert Bruchhagen. ""We are confident that he will achieve this."" Kovac's first game in charge will be a tough away trip to sixth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday before hosting bottom side Hanover 96 a week later, then visiting Bundesliga leaders Bayern on April 2. The Kovac siblings grew up in Berlin and are no strangers to success in Germany's top flight. They won the league and cup double with Bayern in 2003 and the Intercontinental Cup in 2001 with Niko as a defensive midfielder and Robert in defence."
69,06/03/2016,12:36,Frankfurt sack Veh after dropping into bottom three,Bundesliga strugglers Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday sacked coach Armin Veh after results over the weekend saw the club drop into the relegation places.,"Veh's second stint in Frankfurt lasted just 265 days and Saturday's dismal 1-1 draw at home to Ingolstadt, when fans chanted 'Armin Out', left Eintracht third from bottom and winless in their last seven matches. Werder Bremen climbed out of the bottom three with a 4-1 thrashing of last-placed Hanover 96 on Saturday, pushing Frankfurt down into the relegation places. Veh lost 11 of his 25 league games in charge with just five wins ""It's never nice to dismiss a coach,"" said Frankfurt chairman Heribert Bruchhagen on Sunday morning. ""It was a very hard decision to make, because up until recently Armin Veh had our confidence."" Veh previously walked away from Frankfurt at the end of the 2013/14 season after three years as head coach. His assistant coach Reiner Geyer will take over training ahead of next Saturday's game against Borussia Moenchengladbach until a permanent replacement is found. This is the second time Veh has lasted less than a year at a club after he was sacked by Stuttgart, who he initially coached to the 2007 German league title, after just 146 days on his brief return in 2014."
70,02/03/2016,22:42,Bayern lose perfect home record to give Dortmund hope,"Bayern Munich suffered a shock 2-1 defeat to Mainz on Wednesday, losing their 100 percent home record this season, as their lead in the Bundesliga was trimmed to five points.","The result shakes up the title race ahead of Saturday's crunch clash when Pep Guardiola's Bayern play at second-placed Borussia Dortmund. Colombia striker Jhon Cordoba came off the bench to seal only Mainz's second victory in Munich with the winner on 86 minutes to finish off a counter-attack. ""We had our chances and then let them counter-attack. We shouldn't have allowed that to happen,"" fumed Bayern's goal-scorer Arjen Robben. Mainz took a shock lead at the Allianz Arena when Spanish winger Jairo fired home in the first-half with the Bayern defence well beaten. Robben pulled a goal back for the Bavarians on 64 minutes. Despite Mainz managing only 22 percent of possession, Cordoba grabbed the late winner and was mobbed by his team-mates. ""We knew how we could win here with a strong defensive display and a good counter-attack,"" said Mainz coach Martin Schmidt, who praised his side's 'outstanding display'. ""It feels really good."" Dortmund's 2-0 win at Darmstadt on Wednesday cut Bayern's lead from eight points to five as another Colombia striker, Adrian Ramos, and defender Erik Durm netted. ""We and Bayern both know that things can now be a bit tight. We want to win the thing,"" said Dortmund's Germany defender Durm. Hertha Berlin cemented third place, but remain 15 points adrift of Dortmund, with a 2-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the capital. Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou and Mitchell Weiser scored to keep Hertha on course for a first return to the Champions League since 2000. At the other end of the table, Werder Bremen climbed out of the relegation places with a shock 4-1 win at Bayer Leverkusen as veteran Claudio Pizarro claimed a hat-trick. The 37-year-old Peru international showed why he is the Bundesliga's top scoring foreigner by needing just under half an hour to wrap up his hat-trick which included a penalty. Having knocked Leverkusen out of the German Cup in the quarter-finals last month, Bremen again humbled Bayer. Roger Schmidt's Leverkusen has now lost four of their last five games in all competitions and drop to seventh in the league. Elsewhere Schalke climbed to sixth with a 3-2 comeback win at home to Hamburg while Borussia Moenchengladbach remain fourth after their 4-0 thrashing at home to Stuttgart. Second-from-bottom Hoffenheim boosted their survival chances with a 2-1 win over Augsburg. On Tuesday, Germany winger Andre Schuerrle claimed the first Bundesliga hat-trick of his career as Wolfsburg routed bottom side Hanover 96 4-0 away. March 1 is a lucky day for Schuerrle who also scored a hat-trick for ex-club Chelsea against Fulham in the Premier League exactly two years ago. His performance will boost his standing at Wolfsburg and in this one game he has scored more goals than in his previous 33 matches for the Champions League side. He needed just 26 minutes to score three goals before Germany team-mate Julian Draxler added Wolfsburg's fourth at Hanover's HDI Arena. The win leaves Wolfsburg eighth while Hanover are bottom, four points from their nearest rival and seven points from safety. The German FA (DFB) is expected to fine both clubs after one of the flares fired from the away fan block hit the Hanover bench before kick-off, but no-one was hurt. Elsewhere, French striker Anthony Modeste rescued a point for Cologne in their 1-1 draw at Ingolstadt after forward Lukas Hinterseer had given the hosts the lead."
71,24/01/2016,20:00,"Wolfsburg, Schalke crash to shock defeats",Eintracht Frankfurt captain Alexander Meier hit a hat-trick as Champions League side Wolfsburg lost 3-2 away while Schalke also crashed as Sunday yielded two shock Bundesliga defeats.,"Wolfsburg, who face Ghent in the last 16 of the Champions League, are seventh, outside next season's European places, after the Frankfurt defeat. Schalke are sixth after losing 3-1 at home to relegation-threatened Werder Bremen. After Wolfsburg's Germany winger Andre Schuerrle hit a late equaliser in Frankfurt, Wolves were heading for a 2-2 draw before Meier struck a late dramatic winner. Wolfsburg took an early lead when centre-back Dante slotted home on 25 minutes, but Meier, last season's top scorer in Germany's top flight, took advantage of poor Wolfsburg defending. He equalised on 66 minutes, then put his side ahead on 73 minutes before Schuerrle levelled six minutes later. But Meier produced his third goal, from just his third shot, three minutes into added time as Wolfsburg were punished for woeful defending. The result left Wolfsburg seventh, with Eintracht 14th, and means Wolves are winless in their three games since beating Manchester United in their final Champions League group game. Another German league shock then followed in Gelsenkirchen when Schalke crashed despite taking a fourth-minute lead through Cameroon defender Joel Matip from a corner. Bremen remain in the bottom three despite picking up only their fifth win of the season with goals by captain Clemens Fritz, former Bayern and Chelsea striker Claudio Pizarro and Nigeria's Anthony Ujah. Veterans ruled at the Veltins Arena as Fritz, 35, equalised, then turned provider by setting up the 37-year-old Pizarro for his 178th German league goal in his 397th Bundesliga match on 54 minutes. And Fritz again provided the final pass for Ujah to hit Bremen's third, and his eighth of the season, just a minute from time. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund consolidated second place with a convincing 3-1 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach to trim Bayern Munich's runaway lead. Goals by Dortmund's Marco Reus, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Ilkay Gundogan, with a consolation from Gladbach's Raffael, sealed the win. It left Dortmund both eight points behind Bayern and eight points ahead of third-placed Hertha Berlin, who were held to a goalless draw at home to Augsburg in the capital. It was only Gladbach's second league defeat since Andre Schubert took charge last September with the team bottom of the table. They stay fourth. On Friday, Bayern kicked-off the second half of the season with a 2-1 win at Hamburg thanks to Robert Lewandowski's two goals. At the other end of the table on Saturday, veteran Portugal striker Hugo Almeida marked his debut for relegation-threatened Hanover 96 with a goal. But he was unable to prevent their 2-1 defeat at home to Darmstadt as Sandro Wagner scored both of the visitors' goals. The defeat left Hanover bottom as ex-Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf took charge of his first game since replacing Michael Frontzeck over the winter break. Darmstadt are 12th. Stuttgart left the relegation places with a 3-1 win at Cologne as Jurgen Kramny picked up his second straight win having been given the head coach role full-time. Bayer Leverkusen stay fifth after their 1-1 draw at Hoffenheim as Jiloan Hamad's goal for the hosts was cancelled out by Leverkusen captain Omer Toprak's late strike. Ingolstadt, who are in their first season in Germany's top flight, earned a 1-0 win at home to Mainz through a Moritz Hartmann penalty to go tenth."

For the away match, Frankfurt must reimburse neighbours Darmstadt for the loss of revenue from ticket sales. Eintracht must also spend 25,000 euros on improving safety and anti-violence measures, as well as improving the club's infrastructure, which is part of the 75,000-euro fine. The DFB has also said that should there be any further crowd trouble, Frankfurt fans will be banned from a third game as part of a suspended decision until December 2016. The German FA has taken exception to the behaviour of Eintracht fans following their 1-0 home league defeat to neighbours Darmstadt, which was marred by crowd trouble on December 6, when only police intervention prevented rival fans from clashing. The game had to be stopped for nearly three minutes when pyrotechnics were set off in a block containing Frankfurt fans and flags in Darmstadt's colours were burned, while firecrackers were thrown onto the pitch. That came after Frankfurt's 1-0 German Cup defeat at third-division Erzgebirge Aue last October was marred by pyrotechnics fired from the away fans' section."
73,13/12/2015,19:49,Aubameyang strikes as Dortmund rout Frankfurt,Borussia Dortmund set a new club record in routing ten-man Eintracht Frankfurt 4-1 on Sunday as the Bundesliga's top-scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored his 18th goal in 16 games.,"Second-placed Dortmund's victory gave them a club record seventh win and one draw at home, their best start to a season, as Thomas Tuchel's side came from behind to floor strugglers Frankfurt. Eintracht took the lead when captain Alexander Meier finished off a counter-attack on seven minutes before Henrikh Mkhitaryan equalised for Dortmund on 24 minutes. Frankfurt were reduced to ten-men when midfielder Slobodan Medojevic was sent off for fouling Gonzalo Castro in the area on 44 minutes, but Aubameyang drove the resulting penalty wide as it finished 1-1 at the break. Aubameyang made amends for his earlier miss by converting Shinji Kagawa's pass on 57 minutes while Dortmund captain Mats Hummels made it 3-1 with a long-range strike just four minutes later. Shortly before the final whistle, Adrian Ramos grabbed Dortmund's fourth just minutes after coming off the bench to seal the victory which left Dortmund five points short of leaders Bayern Munich. Aubameyang is on course to break Gerd Mueller's record of 40 Bundesliga goals in a single season. At the same stage of the 1971/72 season, Mueller had scored 17 goals for Bayern Munich. Earlier, Brazilian winger Caiuby hit a late winner as struggling Augsburg shocked Schalke 2-1. Hosts Augsburg took the lead when Dominik Kohr's strike from outside the area cannoned off Hong Jeong-Ho to wrong-foot Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann on 34 minutes. It was centre-back Hong's first Bundesliga goal in his third season with Augsburg and Sead Kolasinac equalised before Caiuby fired home at the far post in the 92nd minute to give Augsburg their first home league win since September and lift them up to 13th. Schalke drop to eighth with just one league win in their last seven games to put pressure on coach Andre Breitenreiter. On Saturday, Robert Lewandowski and Philipp Lahm netted as leaders Bayern Munich laboured to a 2-0 win against Ingolstadt to get back on track after last week's shock defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach. Gladbach crashed to their first defeat in 11 league games under coach Andre Schubert in a 5-0 hammering at Bayer Leverkusen, for whom Javier Hernandez claimed a hat-trick. 'Chicharito' needed just 13 second-half minutes to score his three goals with ex-Germany striker Stefan Kiessling also scoring either side of half-time for Leverkusen, who are sixth after only their second win in their last nine games. Gladbach are fifth. Hertha Berlin took the chance to leapfrog Gladbach into third when they romped to a 4-0 win at Darmstadt as Bosnia striker Vedad Ibisevic scored twice, Marvin Plattenhardt hit a free-kick and Salomon Kalou netted a fourth. Fresh from Tuesday's Champions League win over Manchester United, which confirmed their place in the last 16 as group winners, fourth-placed Wolfsburg laboured to a 1-1 draw at home to Hamburg. Werder Bremen continue to hover just above the relegation places after a 1-1 draw at home to Cologne as Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah had a first-half penalty saved for the hosts. Hoffenheim enjoyed their first win since September when Jonathan Schmid's first-half goal sealed their 1-0 win at home to Hanover 96 which lifted them to 17th. Stuttgart are bottom again after their goalless draw at Mainz on Friday."
74,28/11/2015,17:54,Bayern extend Hertha's 38-year wait,Bayern Munich went 11 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin who have now gone 38 years without a win at the German giants.,"With second-placed Borussia Dortmund hosting VfB Stuttgart on Sunday, Bayern took the chance to extend their lead with first-half goals by Germany forward Thomas Mueller and France Under-21 winger Kingsley Coman. Bayern show no signs of loosening their iron-grip on the Bundesliga title as they picked up their 13th win from 14 league games to give them 40 from a possible 42 points. This was the first time in eight home games that Bayern failed to score at least four goals. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola experimented with the starting line-up by pushing Germany centre-back Jerome Boateng into a midfield role, which led to their second goal. They took the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena when Chile midfielder Arturo Vidal's cross found Medhi Benatia, whose shot was heading wide, but Mueller was on hand to head home on 34 minutes. Bayern doubled their lead on 41 minutes when Boateng lobbed the ball into Javi Martinez, whose pass found Coman and the French winger did the rest to make it 2-0 at the break. Hertha, who last won in Munich in 1977, are in fifth place after Borussia Moechengladbach leap-frogged them into fourth with a 3-3 draw at Hoffenheim. Gladbach's head coach Andre Schubert preserved his nine-game unbeaten record in the lead since taking charge two months ago. Borussia took an early lead thanks to USA international Fabian Johnson, who then scored their equaliser to rescue a point. Hoffenheim, chasing their first win since September, took a 3-1 lead just after the break thanks to goals by Steven Zuber, Eugen Polanski and Nadiem Amiri. But Swiss striker Josip Drmic pulled it back to 3-2 for Gladbach before Johnson claimed his second with a superb shot three minutes from time. Hamburg are up to sixth after their 3-1 win at Werder Bremen in the north German derby. Hamburg raced into an early 2-0 lead as Croatia midfielder Ivo Ilicevic scored on their opening attack, then striker Michael Gregoritsch doubled their lead on 26 minutes. Nigeria's Anthony Ujah pulled a goal back for Werder on 62 minutes, then Germany forward Nicolai Mueller made it 3-1 to Hamburg on 68 minutes when Ilicevic's final pass put him in behind the hosts' defence. Hanover eased the pressure on coach Michael Frontzeck with a 4-0 thumping at home to Ingolstadt which lifted them up to 14th and pulled them away from the relegation zone. Japan striker Yoshinori Muto scored his seventh goal of the season in Mainz's 2-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. His forward partner Yunus Malli added their second to claim his eighth while Frankfurt had captain Alex Meier sent off for a second yellow card."

David Alaba's early goal was cancelled out by Schalke's Max Meyer before Martinez, then Thomas Mueller struck for Bayern. They took a fortuitous lead in Gelsenkirchen when Alaba's long-range shot clipped Leon Goretzka's heel and flew into the Schalke net with nine minutes gone. Schalke drew level through Meyer's superb goal on 17 minutes when he turned Bayern captain Philipp Lahm and powered his shot past goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. But Bayern maintained their unbeaten record in Germany's top flight when Spain's Martinez headed Arjen Robben's pin-point cross on 69 minutes. It was the centre-back's first league goal for Bayern since August 2013, then Mueller added a late third by curling his shot inside the far post. Earlier, Germany striker Max Kruse netted twice in Wolfsburg's 6-0 rout of Werder Bremen. Kruse said he was glad to get back to football after the horror scenes from Paris and the postponed Germany-Holland friendly in Hannover last Tuesday due to a bomb scare. There was a minute's silence at all Bundesliga grounds -- the players also wore black armbands -- out of respect for the Paris victims. ""Of course you have a few thoughts after a week like that, but we have to go out as role models and not be put off by what has happened,"" said Kruse. Stuttgart's 4-0 thumping at home to Augsburg was delayed by 15 minutes due to the tightened security checks at stadiums across the country. There were no such problems at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena as Bremen gifted the opener when defender Alejandro Galvez slid the ball into his own net on 11 minutes. Kruse put Wolfsburg 2-0 up at the break by heading home a free-kick then Portugal international Vierinha netted on 56 minutes.

Hanover equalised through Poland international Artur Sobiech on 65 minutes, but Brazil striker Raffael scored the winner six minutes from time. Ex-Manchester United star Javier Hernandez scored his first brace for Bayer Leverkusen in their 3-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Christmas came early for Hernandez in Frankfurt when Eintracht centre-back David Abraham allowed a cross to roll between his legs and the striker stabbed home on 11 minutes. The Mexico striker doubled his tally on 39 minutes when Hakan Calhanoglu's pass split the Frankfurt defence. Hernandez did the rest, but it finished 2-1 at the break when Serbian midfielder Slobodan Medojevic headed home on the stroke of half-time. Calhanoglu sealed the win with Leverkusen's third goal on 72 minutes. Augsburg climbed off the bottom of the table with an emphatic 4-0 win at VfB Stuttgart as woeful defending by the hosts allowed the visitors to take an early 2-0 lead with both goals by midfielder Alexander Esswein. Defender Jan-Ingwer Callsen-Bracker grabbed a third before former South Korea captain Koo Ja-Cheol scored Augsburg's fourth when he hit the top right-hand corner from 10 metres out on 54 minutes.

The Germans still have every chance of qualifying for the knock-out stages and consolidated third in the German league table by hammering Bremen. There was a minute's silence at all Bundesliga grounds this weekend -- the players also wore black armbands -- out of respect for the victims of the Paris terror attacks. Stuttgart's 4-0 thumping at home to Augsburg was delayed by 15 minutes due to the tightened security checks at stadiums across the country. There were no such problems at Wolfsburg's Volkswagen Arena as Bremen gifted their hosts the opener when defender Alejandro Galvez slid the ball into his own net on 11 minutes. Kruse put Wolfsburg 2-0 up at the break by heading home a free-kick then Portugal international Vierinha scored from the right wing on 56 minutes. The floodgates opened when French defensive midfielder, on for the injured Brazil star Luiz Gustavo, stabbed home his shot on 67 minutes. Kruse then set up Netherlands striker Bas Dost on 78 minutes before completing the scoring three minutes from time by converting a cross from Germany team-mate Andre Schuerrle to leave him with five league goals for the season. The result leaves Wolfsburg five points behind second-placed Borussia Dortmund who lost 3-1 at Hamburg on Friday night, while leaders Bayern Munich play at Schalke on Saturday evening. Ex-Manchester United star Javier Hernandez now has 12 goals for Bayer Leverkusen in all competitions after scoring twice in their 3-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Christmas came early for 'Chicharito' in Frankfurt when Eintracht centre-back David Abraham allowed a cross to roll between his legs and the grateful Hernandez stabbed home on 11 minutes. The Mexico striker doubled his tally on 39 minutes when a Hakan Calhanoglu pass split the Frankfurt defence.

77,31/10/2015,11:04,Lahm laments rival defences as Bayern drop points,Bayern Munich captain Philipp Lahm bemoaned opponents' defensive tactics after the champions dropped their first Bundesliga points of the season at Eintracht Frankfurt.,"The German giants warmed up for the visit of Arsenal on Wednesday in the Champions League by seeing their domestic winning streak broken on Friday. Bayern's record run of 10 Bundesliga wins at the start of a season came to an abrupt halt as they were held to a goalless draw at Frankfurt, although they still enjoy an eight-point lead at the top of the table. Despite enjoying 74 percent of possession, Bayern managed just 10 shots on goal to Eintracht's eight as the hosts put in a disciplined display and refused to allow the reigning champions space to exploit. The hosts contained Bayern's attack, led by Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller, which had scored 33 goals in their previous 10 league games. The Frankfurt draw came just a fortnight after Bayern only managed a 1-0 win at Werder Bremen, who also packed their defence. ""Every weekend you think to yourself: 'it can't get any more defensive'. But then another team comes along and yes, they're even more defensive,"" complained Lahm, who made his 450th appearance for Bayern. ""It makes creating chances far from easy, but we had a few openings and in a game like that you have to take them. We've done that successfully in recent weeks, but not here."" Bayern are bidding to become the first team to win a fourth straight German league title and Lahm predicts teams will park the proverbial bus in front of goal in the coming weeks. ""We'll frequently face opponents who play very, very defensively,"" he added. Midfielder Arturo Vidal said Frankfurt shut the game down whenever Bayern approached their opponents' box. ""It was very hard work, Frankfurt pulled all 11 men back to the edge of their own box,"" said the Chilean. ""That makes it almost impossible for any team to score. All that was missing was a goal. ""We're obviously disappointed with the draw. We need to keep on working if we're to hit our targets."" However, Frankfurt, who are 11th in the table, deserve credit for bouncing back from their shock 1-0 defeat at third-division Erzgebirge Aue in the German Cup in midweek. ""You can't stop Bayern creating scoring chances time and again due to their individual quality, but we made it difficult and were able to get at them here and there,"" said Stefan Aigner. ""I think we were very strong, but it's only one point, so we mustn't ease back."""

Hertha should have equalised before the break as striker Vedad Ibisevic headed onto the post, then fired over the bar. But they finally drew level on 82 minutes when substitute Alexander Baumjohann chested the ball through to Darida and the ex-Freiburg attacking midfielder slammed his shot past Frankfurt goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky. The point leaves Hertha sixth and Frankfurt 10th in the table. With second-placed Borussia Dortmund hosting Darmstadt on Sunday evening, defending champions Bayern Munich took the chance to go five points clear on Saturday with a 3-0 win at Mainz as Robert Lewandowski's goal haul continued. The Poland hot-shot took his tally to 101 Bundesliga goals and has now scored 10 goals in just six league games this season. Having sent German league records tumbling last Tuesday with five goals in just nine minutes after coming the bench in the 5-1 rout of Wolfsburg, the 27-year-old claimed two more against Mainz before Bayern host Dinamo Zagreb in the Champions League on Tuesday. Lewandowski marked his 100th Bundesliga goal by heading Kingsley Coman's cross inside the far post on 51 minutes and pulled up his shirt to reveal a T-Shirt which stated: ""100"". ""The T-Shirt was my idea, I didn't know if I'd score today, but you always have to think positively, which is why I had it made,"" he told reporters. An Arturo Vidal pass then put Lewandowski in behind the defence to round the goalkeeper for his 101st on 63 minutes. France Under-21 winger Coman grabbed Bayern's third five minutes later with a simple tap in from a Douglas Costa cross. Schalke remain third after Germany Under-21 attacking midfielder Leroy Sane scored for his third game in succession to seal Saturday's 1-0 win at Hamburg with a superb strike on the hour. Bayer Leverkusen, who play European champions Barcelona away on Tuesday, romped to a 3-0 win at Werder Bremen with goals by Swiss forward Admir Mehmedi, winger Kevin Kampl and Germany Under-21 talent Julian Brandt.

The goals came from Granit Xhaka, a Christian Gentner own-goal and Raffel's late effort afer Daniel Ginczek slotted a 40th-minute penalty for Stuttgart. Hoffenheim climbed to 15th with a 3-1 win at Augsburg as Germany international Kevin Volland scored twice, including a second-half penalty."

""I've had three wonderful seasons here. My time at Eintracht will always remain a wonderful memory,"" said Inui.

Wolves were rewarded for some patient build-up play as new striker Max Kruse fired in a brilliant cross which Perisic headed home at the far post on 13 minutes. They doubled their lead four minutes later after calamitous Frankfurt defending in the area as Kruse poked the ball across the face of goal and Dost buried his shot from close range. Frankfurt fought back with defensive midfielder Stefan Reinartz taking advantage of some sloppy Wolfsburg defending to pull a goal back for the visitors on 19 minutes. It proved to be the end of the scoring, although both sides had second-half chances as Perisic in particular went close. After Bayern kicked off the new season with a 5-0 hammering of Hamburg on Friday night, Borussia Dortmund threw down the gauntlet to the defending champions with a 4-0 drubbing of Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday. New signing Douglas Costa was outstanding on Bayern's left wing and slotted the final goal after Thomas Mueller scored twice, while centre-back Medhi Benatia headed the opening goal in an impressive display. However, Dortmund's new coach Thomas Tuchel began his tenure in emphatic style as his side ran riot at home to Gladbach with left-winger Henrikh Mkhitaryan scoring twice as Marco Reus and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang also netted.

Schalke picked up their first win under new coach Andre Breitenreiter with a 3-0 victory at Werder Bremen. The hosts conceded an unlucky first-half own goal when Czech defender Theodor Gebre Selassie beat Schalke striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar to the ball, only for his clearance to loop over Werder goalkeeper Felix Wiedwald and into his own net. Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting converted a pass from his international team-mate Joel Matip on 68 minutes before Huntelaar finished off a superb counter-attack on 85 minutes by 19-year-old substitute Leroy Sane, who had just come on.

Lewandowski, the Bundesliga's top scorer last season, added to his tally to leave him with 16 goals for the season and third in the current rankings. Frankfurt were missing the league's top scorer with Alexander Meier, who has 19 goals in 26 matches, out with a knee injury. Coach Pep Guardiola has described Bayern's injury situation ahead of Wednesday's first-leg at FC Porto as 'very critical' with only 14 players fit to face Frankfurt. ""I've never known anything like it in my career,"" rued the Spaniard before the win. Centre-back Medhi Benatia, who has a groin injury, joined flu-victim Bastian Schweinsteiger, plus wingers Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben and left-back David Alaba as just some of the stars on Bayern's casualty list. Guardiola made Bundesliga history by naming four Spain internationals in his starting line-up in Pepe Reina, Xabi Alonso, Thiago Alcantara and Juan Bernat. Despite their woes, Bayern needed just 15 minutes to take the lead at Munich's Allianz Arena when Lewandowski produced a world-class turn and volley. The Poland star made sure of the three points when he headed home, with suspicion of offside, on 66 minutes. Mueller added the third eight minutes from time when he fired home a seemingly-impossible angle. Third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach picked up their fourth straight league win with an impressive 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund. Tenth-placed Dortmund went behind after just 29 seconds as Patrick Herrmann's shot was blocked by Borussia's Roman Weidenfeller, but Sweden left-back Oscar Wendt slammed home the parry. Brazilian forward Raffel addded their second on 32 minutes after a strong run by Herrmann before Norway's Havard Nordveit fired home when left unmarked at the far post with 67 minutes gone before Ilkay Gundogan pulled a late goal back for Dortmund.

The Allianz Arena match is their last before Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, first-leg, clash at FC Porto. The Bavarian giants are without the injured trio of right-winger Arjen Robben, left-back David Alaba and left-winger Franck Ribery, although the Frenchman returned to training on Thursday after an ankle injury. Bayern are still buzzing from Wednesday's German Cup quarter-final win at Leverkusen, when they came out on top after a penalty shoot-out. Pep Guardiola's Bayern are bidding to match their 2013 feat of winning the treble of European, German league and cup, but the Bundesliga remains their focus. ""The Bundesliga is the most important title, it has the priority,"" confirmed Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer. ""Everything else you have to try to take as much as you can from."" A sub-plot to the Frankfurt clash sees in-form strikers Robert Lewandowski of Bayern and Eintracht's Alexander Meier go head-to-head. The pair have 23 league goals between them. Lewandowski, the league's top-scorer last season at Borussia Dortmund, has scored seven goals in his last seven league games, while Meier is the current Bundesliga's top-scorer with 19 goals in 26 matches. The stats point to a Bayern win as it is 14 years since the Bavarians last lost two matches at home, having been stunned 2-0 at home to Gladbach a fortnight ago. Bayern's Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is unbeaten in 13 league matches against Eintracht with 11 wins. Second-placed VfL Wolfsburg are at relegation-threatened Hamburg on Saturday night with the hosts desperate to avoid dropping out of Germany's top flight for the first time in their history. Hamburg are on their third coach, but Peter Knaebbel's side was pounded 4-0 at Bayer Leverkusen last Saturday on his debut in charge to leave them third from bottom and three points from safety. They are winless in their last seven games, but can expect no charity from Wolfsburg who remain ten points adrift of Bayern, but are closing in on having their automatic place in next season's Champions League confirmed. ""The only thing on our minds at the moment is Hamburg,"" said Wolves' coach Dieter Hecking. ""We want to seal our place in the group stages of the Champions League as quickly as possible. ""Hamburg and their fans will do everything they can to make life difficult for us and to get the three points."" Third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach, who were dumped out of the German Cup on Wednesday after their shock penalty shoot-out defeat to third-division Arminia Bielefeld, are home to mid-table Borussia Dortmund. The corresponding tie last October was settled by a curious Christoph Kramer own-goal, when Gladbach's German midfielder lobbed his own goalkeeper. Gladbach have won their last six homes games, while it is almost six years since Dortmund last won at Borussia Park Stadium. Dortmund hope to welcome back both Germany stars Marco Reus and Mats Hummels, who missed Tuesday's 3-2 extra-time cup win over Hoffenheim with minor injuries. Fixtures (1330 GMT unless stated)"

Dortmund took the lead in Hanover after Germany winger Marco Reus's no-look pass split the defence and allowed Aubameyang to bury his shot in the 19th minute. The lead lasted just 12 minutes as ex-Dortmund midfielder Leon Bittencourt stole possession on the halfway line, and sprinted to the edge of the area where he fed Lars Stindl whose weak shot beat the Borussia defence. Dortmund rode their luck when captain Mats Hummels headed off the line early in the second half from Spanish striker Joselu just before the hosts were reduced to ten men. Bittencourt was sent off on 55 minutes for a foul on Dortmund veteran Sebastian Kehl just six minutes after fouling Jakub Blaszczykowski. Dortmund made the numerical advantage count almost immediately as Reus again provided the final pass for Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa to score their second on 57 minutes for his first league goal since September. Kagawa then set up Aubameyang for his second goal with a cross which saw the Gabon forward head home on 61 minutes. Hanover set up a nervous last ten minute when Stindl beat Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller to make it 3-2 with 82 minutes gone, but the win leaves Borussia tenth with Hanover 14th. Bremen stay ninth after being held to a 1-1 draw at mid-table Cologne as a first-half goal by Germany Under-29 striker Davie Selke for the visitors was cancelled out by an 88th-minute penalty from Cologne midfielder Matthias Lehmann.

VfB Stuttgart remain rooted to the foot of the table despite their 3-1 comeback win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt. After Frankfurt midfielder Haris Seferovic gave his side a second-half lead Stuttgart striker Daniel Ginczek cancelled out the advantage by scoring twice in as many minutes. Romania midfielder Alexandru Maxim then added Stuttgart's third to seal their first home win since September. The result means just two points separate the bottom four teams of Stuttgart, Freiburg, Paderborn and Hamburg in Germany's top flight."

Polish international Robert Lewandowski added the gloss with two late goals to round out the scoring. While Bremen, who came into the weekend five points behind the European places, toiled bravely they were unable to breach the goalline of Pepe Reina, who was standing in for first-choice 'keeper Manuel Neuer.

It was Paderborn's first win since the start of November and saw them climb from 17th before kick-off to 12th. Earlier, Freiburg had briefly escaped the bottom three with a 2-0 win at Hertha Berlin in Sunday's basement battle.

Their shock 4-1 thrashing at second-placed Wolfsburg last Friday was followed by a 1-1 draw at home to Schalke on Tuesday after playing for 70 minutes with ten men. The usually calm and composed Bayern coach sprinted 45 metres to remonstrate with the assistant referee after a Robert Lewandowski goal was disallowed in the 66th minute against Schalke. ""It was an emotional thing to do. I just spoke to him. It was very, very nice,"" said Guardiola tongue-in-cheek after the heated confrontation. But despite his brush-off remark, Guardiola needs an impressive display from Bayern to sooth any jarred nerves after the Wolfsburg defeat. Having steamrollered their domestic rivals before Christmas, Bayern were rattled in Wolfsburg and allowed Schalke to equalise, albeit with a numerical disadvantage following Jerome Boateng's dismissal. The Germany defender is banned for the next three games and misses the Stuttgart trip, plus home matches against Hamburg and away to Paderborn Stuttgart present the ideal chance to get back on track as Huub Stevens side are third from bottom after winning just one of their nine home games this season. Arjen Robben headed Bayern into the lead at the Allianz Arena before Schalke equalised and the Dutch star says they can ill afford similar performances as they bid for silverware. ""Of course, we played with ten men for most of the match, but when you let them equalise, conceding a goal like that can be deadly in the Champions League,"" said the 31-year-old. Bayern have two league games before they face Shakhtar Donetsk in the Ukrainian city of Lviv in the Champions League last 16, first-leg clash. Second-placed VfL Wolfsburg are set to give Andre Schuerrle his debut at home to Hoffenheim after signing the Germany winger from Chelsea on Monday to end his 19-month sojourn in London.

Hertha Berlin are at Mainz 05 on Saturday with the capital city club second from bottom and with former player Pal Dardai and ex-assistant coach Rainer Widmayer now in charge. On Thursday, ex-coach Jos Luhukay became the fifth Bundesliga coach to be sacked this season after Wednesday's 1-0 loss at home to Bayer Leverkusen meant three defeats in three games. The Berlin club are battling to avoid their third relegation since 2010. Mainz will have striker Shinji Okazaki back in the side for the first time since his return from the Asian Cup where Japan reached the quarter-finals.

Augsburg were reduced to ten men on 64 minutes when defender Christoph Janker was shown a straight red for hauling down Dortmund's Gabon winger Pierre-Emerick Aubemayang.

Former Germany squad member Jansen then made sure of the three points when he fired home on 72 minutes before attacking midfielder Zoltan Stieber added their third in the 91st minute. Hamburg's north German neighbours Werder Bremen continued their eyecatching climb up the table to 11th with their third straight win as they claimed a 2-1 victory at Hoffenheim. Bremen took an early lead when ex-Chelsea striker Franco di Santo scored his third goal in his two matches since a knee injury after just eight minutes. Hoffenheim drew level through a header by defender Ermin Bicakcic, only for Philipp Bargfrede to make it 2-1 when he fired home Di Santo's final pass on 52 minutes. Bayern Munich stayed eight points clear at the top of the table despite playing for 70 minutes with 10 men in their 1-1 draw at home to Schalke 04 on Tuesday. Arjen Robben headed Bayern into a second-half lead before Royal Blues captain Benedikt Hoewedes equalised from a corner five minutes later. Pep Guardiola's defending champions were reduced to ten men when Jerome Boatenng was shown a straight red with only 17 minutes gone for fouling Sidney Sam in the area. Second-placed VfL Wolfsburg missed the chance to close the gap behind Bayern when they needed a late Kevin de Bruyne goal to rescue a point in their 1-1 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt."
95,21/12/2014,02:10,Bayern's domination sparks 'boring Bundesliga' debate,"Bayern Munich will start 2015 with a record 11-point lead in the Bundesliga, sparking debate over how to stop Germany's top flight becoming boring.","Pep Guardiola's Bayern have brushed off their domestic rivals with ease and are poised to become the first team to go through a Bundesliga campaign unbeaten on their way to what would be a third consecutive title. They set more records in Friday's 2-1 comeback win at Mainz having conceded just four goals since August and their points lead at the season's halfway stage is also a league best. They have dropped only six points from a possible 51 so far and post heavy wins in Germany's top tier with monotonous regularity. None of the chasing pack of Wolfsburg, Borussia Moenchengladbach, Bayer Leverkusen or Schalke look realistically capable of closing the gap while last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund are languishing in the relegation places. Ex-Germany coach Berti Vogts sparked debate about how to loosen Bayern's iron grip on the German title by suggesting they should receive less of the league's television revenue. Sky currently pay 628 million euros ($768m) to televise Bundesliga games in Germany and the cash is divided up on a percentage basis with the most going to the league winner. ""We have to get to the point where we subsidise the smaller clubs, by a redistribution of the television money, for example,"" suggested Vogts. But the mere suggestion left ex-Bayern midfielder and Germany international Paul Breitner fuming. ""We (Bayern) can't do anything about the inability of the other clubs. And if we have to bleed now, so the money is redistributed, that's just nonsense!"" he snapped. Bayern are one of the world's richest clubs. They recently paid off the loan on their Allianz Arena stadium decades ahead of schedule and posted a record 528.7 million-euro turnover for the 2013/14 season, with a profit of 16.5 million euros. German teams seem to play Bayern in more hope than expectation of claiming league points. ""Bayern Munich are in a different league, I think we can all agree on that,"" said Augsburg coach Markus Weinzierl after Bayern thrashed his team 4-0 at home. And Hoffenheim coach Markus Gisdol reached the same conclusion before his side were duly dispatched 4-0 in Munich. ""Bayern will lose at home sooner or later, but when you lose four, five or six-nil in Munich, that's normal,"" he mused. Having won the 2011 and 2012 German league titles, then finished runners-up to Bayern in the last two seasons, Dortmund now peer up at Guardiola's Munich from near the foot of the table. Having seen his top players playmaker Mario Goetze and striker Robert Lewandowski join Bayern in the last two seasons, Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp said any German football fan looking for a consistently successful team has only one choice. ""Anyone who just wants to be successful has only one avenue to go down: you have to be a Bayern fan,"" said Klopp, tongue-in-cheek. Klopp predicted the current league situation back in April 2013, two months before Guardiola's arrival. Just before Bayern beat Dortmund 2-1 in the 2013 Champions League final, the German media questioned whether the Bundesliga was following the Spanish league, where two clubs, Real Madrid and Barcelona, traditionally dominate. But Klopp accurately predicted the Bundesliga would mirror Scotland, where Celtic have won the last three league titles after rivals Rangers dropped out of the top flight after the club's liquidation in 2012. ""It's nice that people put us in the same boat as Bayern,"" said Klopp in April 2013, with Dortmund second in the table, but trailing Bayern by 20 points. ""But I think from the start of next season, we'll see that the comparison to Spain doesn't fit, it's more like Scotland."" Even the league's top scorer, Eintracht Frankfurt's Alexander Meier, expects the trophy for the most goals this season to eventually end up in Munich. ""I don't look at the top-scorer table and I honestly think the trophy will go to someone from Bayern,"" he said."
96,08/11/2014,17:43,Mueller claims hat-trick as Bayern extend lead,Defending champions Bayern Munich opened a seven-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga on Saturday as Thomas Mueller netted a hat-trick in their 4-0 romp at Eintracht Frankfurt.,"With main rivals VfL Wolfsburg and Gladbach playing Sunday, Pep Guardiola's Bayern made sure of their eighth win in 11 league games to pull clear of the chasing pack. Having been rested for Wednesday's 2-0 home win over Roma which confirmed Bayern's place in the Champions League's last 16 as group winners, Mueller opened the scoring in Frankfurt when he converted a Franck Ribery pass at the second attempt on 23 minutes. The 25-year-old then boosted his tally with two goals in three minutes after converting another Ribery pass after the Frenchman sprinted though the defence with Poland striker Robert Lewandowski also queueing up to score on 64 minutes. Mueller bagged his third to leave him with nine goals in all competitions and the league's joint top scorer when he finished off a move from a quick Ribery throw-in to claim his sixth Bundesliga goal. Xherdan Shaqiri grabbed Bayern's fourth on 86 minutes after fellow second-half replacement Arjen Robben had pulled the Frankfurt defence to pieces to leave the Swiss winger to tap into an empty net. Werder Bremen can move off the bottom, and leave last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund last before hosting third-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach on Sunday, with just a point at VfB Stuttgart on Saturday evening. Hoffenheim dropped to fifth after a lively 4-3 defeat at home to Cologne with Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah netting his third goal of the season for the visitors and Poland defender Pawel Olkowski scoring twice, including the 83rd-minute winner. Leverkusen, who won 2-1 at Zenit St Petersburg on Tuesday to stay top of their Champions League group, were held to a goalless draw at home to Mainz and drop to sixth having suffered a shock 1-0 league defeat at Hamburg last weekend. Robert di Matteo suffered his second consecutive defeat as Schalke coach when his side lost 2-0 at Freiburg, who pulled clear of the relegation places to move up to 13th with Christian Guenter and Jonathan Schmid scoring their goals. The 44-year-old Di Matteo has now lost three and won three of his six games since taking charge of the Royal Blues last month and his side drop to 11th in the table -- exactly where they were when he took charge. Augsburg moved up to seventh with a 3-0 win at mid-table Paderborn as midfielder Tobias Werner scoring twice. Second-placed Wolfsburg can pick up their eighth straight win when they host strugglers Hamburg on Sunday. Hanover 96 moved up to fourth in the table with a 2-0 win at Hertha Berlin on Friday, but both top six sides Hoffenheim and Bayer Leverkusen both lost ground to Bayern."
97,19/08/2014,02:05,Germany riding crest of wave as Bundesliga begins,The new Bundesliga season gets underway this weekend with German football riding the crest of a wave following the national team's triumph at the World Cup in Brazil last month.,"That thoroughly deserved victory, given to Joachim Loew's side by Mario Goetze's extra-time strike in the final against Argentina, saw a unified Germany crowned as world champions for the first time. But at club level, the Bundesliga has been leading the way for some time. It averaged 3.16 goals per game last season, considerably more than any of its major European counterparts, while average gates were over 42,000, making the German top flight the best attended league anywhere. ""In my opinion, the Bundesliga's the most attractive league in the world,"" Borussia Moenchengladbach coach Lucien Favre told bundesliga.com. ""The hype in Germany is amazing, and now they've won the World Cup so it's not going to tail off in a rush."" Nevertheless, the biggest problem facing the Bundesliga, as ever, is how to counter the dominance of Bayern Munich, who have romped to the title and added the German Cup in each of the last two campaigns. They have seen Toni Kroos and Mario Mandzukic depart and lost Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in last week's SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, but the Bavarians remain favourites. And yet the rest can draw some hope from the very fact this is a Bundesliga season immediately following a World Cup, and that has not tended to help Bayern in the recent past. After Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup, Stuttgart went on to win the Bundesliga, while in 2011 Dortmund pipped Bayern to the title. In 2009, after Germany reached the Euro 2008 final, it was Wolfsburg who were champions. Six members of Pep Guardiola's squad played in the World Cup final, including Goetze, while Dante and Arjen Robben were also involved until the latter stages in Brazil. That is why chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge wanted the start of the new season delayed in order to give these players longer to prepare, but that request was unsurprisingly turned down by Bayern's rivals. ""We have to face the fact that the first half of the season will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, who at times had only a skeleton squad in pre-season training. ""We are at least one month behind schedule."" Guardiola has added to his squad with compatriots Juan Bernat from Valencia and Pepe Reina, who will provide competition in goal for Manuel Neuer. But the marquee signing was Robert Lewandowski, a prolific goalscorer for Dortmund in the last four years. However, Dortmund have moved to replace the Pole by signing Italy striker Ciro Immobile from Torino and Colombia's Adrian Ramos from Hertha Berlin. Stability is key at the Signal Iduna Park, where coach Jurgen Klopp, who led Dortmund to back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012 and a Champions League final defeat to Bayern in 2013, is entering his seventh season in charge. ""We want to establish ourselves further at the top of the league and qualify directly for the Champions League,"" said sporting director Michael Zorc modestly. However, Guardiola knows where the danger lies, saying: ""We may have won the last two league titles, but they clinched the previous two. Our great challenge is to keep up our level to keep them at distance."" Beneath them, Schalke, Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg will again be hoping to contend for Champions League qualification at least. Schalke have kept Klaas-Jan Huntelaar and Julian Draxler, while Sidney Sam has joined from Leverkusen, and few teams can boast a midfield as strong as Wolfsburg, with Kevin de Bruyne, Luiz Gustavo and France's Josuha Guilavogui. Bayer have signed Swiss striker Josip Drmic from Nuremberg and have a new coach in Roger Schmidt, back in his native country after winning the Austrian title with Salzburg. Hamburg will be hoping for a stable campaign after almost being relegated for the first time in their history last season. There are new coaches at Mainz, Eintracht Frankfurt and Stuttgart, who have reappointed Armin Veh, the architect of their 2007 title triumph, while Cologne are back among the elite and Paderborn are in the Bundesliga for the first time."

The former Sao Paulo youth-team player was a member of the Under-20 Brazil squad that won the Toulon Tournament last month."
99,06/06/2014,06:24,Football: Japan's Osako joins promoted Cologne,"Japan striker Yuya Osako has joined newly-promoted Bundesliga side Cologne from second division side 1860 Munich, the club and player have said.","The 24-year-old, currently with the Japan team in Florida preparing for the World Cup in Brazil, will sign a deal taking him through until June 2017 subject to a medical, Cologne said on their website. Terms were not disclosed. ""It's a relief to get the move before the World Cup,"" said Osako, who joined 1860 from J-League side Kashima Antlers in the January transfer window. ""For me the Bundesliga is one of the best in the world and I'm sure I can keep improving in Germany,"" he told Japanese reporters in Florida. Osako, likely to start on the bench for Japan in Brazil, appeared in 15 games for 1860, scoring six goals. ""It's given me something else to look forward to before the World Cup,"" added Osako, who has three goals in eight games for his country. ""But first I have to give everything for Japan and hopefully take some good form to my new team."" The deal comes after Japan captain Makoto Hasebe signed a two-year contract with fellow Bundesliga team Eintracht Frankfurt from relegated Nuremberg. The 30-year-old joined Germany's top-flight in 2007/08 from J-League side Urawa Red Diamonds and has made 135 Bundesliga appearances, scoring five goals."

""We are pleased that we were able to sign an experienced player, who has demonstrated his skills over the last few years in the Bundesliga,"" said Eintracht's director of sport Bruno Huebner. ""We wish him lots of success at the World Cup and that he leads his team as far as possible."" Having switched from VfL Wolfsburg to Nuremberg last September, Hasebe endured an injury-hit single season as Nuremberg failed to escape the drop. He was only able to make 14 appearances for the Franconian club with a knee injury before making his return for the final match of the season. Hasebe has been in the national team since 2006, making 78 appearances for Japan, who are in Group C and open their World Cup campaign against Ivory Coast on Sunday June 15 in Recife."
101,27/05/2014,15:58,Football: Germany midfielder Hunt signs for Wolfsburg,"Germany midfielder Aaron Hunt has joined Europa League side VfL Wolfsburg on a three-year deal after 13 years at Werder Bremen, his new club announced on Tuesday.","The 27-year-old, who has three international caps, signed for Werder as a junior and has switched clubs on a free transfer. ""I was with Bremen for a long time, achieved many things with Werder and had some really great years, but this was the time to try something new,"" said Hunt, with Wolfsburg only 150 kilometres (93 miles) south of Bremen. He is set to link up with Belgium midfielder Kevin de Bruyne and Brazil's Luiz Gustavo as Wolves target a return to the Champions League for 2015/2016 after finishing fifth last season in the Bundesliga and just missing out on a place. Hunt, a defensive midfielder, has not been chosen in Joachim Loew's squad for next month's World Cup. He made his last appearance for Germany in May 2013 on a two-match tour of the USA. He becomes the second Germany international to join Wolves after right-back Sebastian Jung switched from Eintracht Frankfurt last week. ""Despite being only 27 and having collected a lot of experience, Aaron is a player who can improve on the high levels he sets for himself,"" said Wolfsburg's team manager Klaus Allofs. Hunt opted for Wolfsburg despite offers from Italy, England, Russia and Turkey and has scored 46 goals for Werder in 215 Bundesliga appearances."
102,17/05/2014,03:04,Football: Time running out for Germany's Loew,Germany coach Joachim Loew can feel that time is running out for him to win a major title after eight years in charge of the much-feared national side.,"The 54-year-old, who hails from the Schwarzwald and still German accent, succeeded Jurgen Klinsmann as head coach after the 2006 World Cup. He has steered Germany to the semi-finals of the 2008 European Championship, the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012, but his resume lacks the major title which would elevate him to Germany's top division of coaches. Loew's image is a daily occurence in Germany where he fronts an advertising campaign for a leading cosmetics brand, but the head coach rarely appears in the media spotlight. The German Football Association (DFB) has already told him his job is safe beyond Brazil 2014 and Loew is expected to see out his current contract which expires after Euro 2016. But Loew has acknowledged that ""the clock is ticking"". Having never played senior international football, Loew made four appearances for West Germany's Under-21s and played Bundesliga football as a midfielder for Eintracht Frankfurt, Karlsruhe and VfB Stuttgart. He won the 1997 German Cup final as VfB Stuttgart coach and after working in Turkey and Austria, Loew joined the Germany set up as assistant coach in 2004. Loew was responsible for tactics with Klinsmann as the team's motivator and the pair delighted the nation as Germany finished third at the 2006 World Cup on home soil. His impressive record of 70 wins in 103 internationals, with a goal difference of 253 to just 98 conceded, has earned Loew plenty of respect in Germany. Under his stewardship, the Germans reached the Euro 2008 final and the semi-finals at both the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 by playing expansive, attack-minded football. He is not afraid of taking risks. When striker Mario Gomez struggled in the group stages of Euro 2008, Loew benched the forward and switched to a 4-2-3-1 system which resulted in a 3-1 quarter-final win over Portugal en route to the final. At the 2010 World Cup, Loew took the youngest German squad since 1934 to South Africa and his side came of age by sweeping aside both England and Argentina before losing their semi-final to eventual winners Spain. Even last week, Loew started eight debutants in the goalless friendly against Poland. Loew has issues to solve both in defence and attack before Brazil. His defence has looked frail on recent occasions, no more so than when Germany threw away a 4-0 lead against Sweden in a World Cup qualifier as they drew 4-4 in Berlin in October 2012. Only captain and right-back Philipp Lahm is sure of his place in defence and Loew needs strong performances from his back four in the remaining warm-up games against Cameroon and Armenia. There are also doubts about the attack. First-choice striker Miroslav Klose, 35, is injury prone and with Mario Gomez having been left out of Loew's extended provisional squad, 21-year-old Kevin Volland of Hoffenheim is the only other out-and-out striker in the squad."
103,12/05/2014,02:35,Football: Experimental Germany kick-off World Cup preparations,Germany begin their final preparations for the World Cup on Tuesday in Hamburg as an experimental side faces neighbours Poland in the first of three friendlies.,"Coach Joachim Loew has included just 10 of the players named in his provisional World Cup squad last week, with the remaining 20 absent due to ongoing club commitments. Seven Bayern Munich players and six from Borussia Dortmund are missing with their clubs meeting in the German Cup final in Berlin next Saturday, while Marcell Jansen is preparing for a relegation play-off with his side Hamburg and six more foreign-based players still have club commitments to honour. Instead, Loew will give a chance to a number of young talents against a Poland side who will themselves be deprived of Dortmund striker Robert Lewandowski. ""The result will not be important,"" declared Loew after announcing a squad featuring the likes of Borussia Moenchengladbach duo Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Christoph Kramer and Eintracht Frankfurt's Sebastian Jung, none of whom will go to Brazil. ""Most of the players are young, have just left school or have just finished their first season in the Bundesliga. ""This is a chance for them to show what they can do and experience the international atmosphere, and why not book their place on the plane to Brazil."" That last message was aimed at others, such as 21-year-old Hoffenheim striker Kevin Volland and Schalke's teenage duo Leon Goretzka and Maximilian Meyer, who have been named in the provisional World Cup squad, to show that they deserve to make the final cut. The squad will be cut to 25 or 26 players on Wednesday before later being reduced to the definitive 23. Volland, who has scored 11 goals and set up nine more this season, appears better-placed than most of the Bundesliga's young talents with Loew lacking back-up in attack to the veteran Lazio striker Miroslav Klose. But Loew added: ""Those who don't make it (to the World Cup), are certainly in our thoughts for 2016 (the European Championship in France) and 2018 (the World Cup in Russia)."" After the game against Poland, who will not go to the World Cup but will face Germany again in Euro 2016 qualifying, the coach will hope to get experienced midfielders Sami Khedira and Bastian Schweinsteiger back to full fitness. Khedira, of Real Madrid, is only just returning from a serious knee injury suffered in November while Bayern's Schweinsteiger hurt himself playing against Stuttgart on the final day of the Bundesliga season on Saturday. The reduced German squad will depart for a training camp in the Italian Alps on May 21 before returning to meet Cameroon in a friendly in Moenchengladbach on June 1. After that game, Loew will name his final 23-man squad, and then there will be one last friendly against Armenia in Mainz on June 6 before Germany head to Brazil. The three-time world champions were drawn in Group G at the World Cup alongside Portugal, Ghana and the United States, who are coached by former Germany star Jurgen Klinsmann."

105,07/05/2014,15:16,Football: Schuster tempted by Frankfurt post,Malaga coach Bernd Schuster has thrown his hat into the ring to take over from Armin Veh as Eintracht Frankfurt coach.,"Schuster was quoted in daily newspaper Bild on Wednesday as saying he would like the job next season. ""Yes, I'm attracted by Frankfurt (but) I don't know if I'm in first, second or third position on the list,"" said the 54-year-old. Schuster is currently under contract with Malaga until 2018 but is believed to have an escape clause. According to Bild, Schuster received a visit from Frankfurt officials on May 1. The former Real Madrid and Barcelona player, who won the European Championships with Germany in 1980, started his managerial career with Cologne before moving to Spain. There he reached the Cup final with Getafe in 2007 before guiding Real to the La Liga crown a year later. Despite that success he lasted only 18 months at Real and managed Besiktas in Turkey for less than a season before re-emerging at Malaga at the start of this campaign. German press believe former Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo is another in the reckoning to take over at Frankfurt. Having begun his coaching career at MK Dons and then West Bromwich Albion, Di Matteo guided Chelsea to Champions League and FA Cup trophies in 2012, before being fired later that year. Swiss-born Di Matteo, 43, already speaks German, something Frankfurt owner Heribert Bruchhagen tolds weekly paper Sport Bild was essential. Veh, 53, joined Hamburg in 2011 but has already stated he will leave at the end of the season, with the club sitting 13th, one match from the end of the season. Veh won the Bundesliga with Stuttgart in 2007 and then had spells with VfL Wolfsburg and Hamburg before joining Frankfurt."
106,03/05/2014,19:56,Football: Bayern romp deepens Hamburg relegation fears,Mario Goetze netted twice in Bayern Munich's 4-1 win at Hamburg on Saturday which left the hosts facing a nerve-racking final weekend where they could be relegated for the first time.,"As the only team in Germany's top tier to have never been relegated, Hamburg's 20th defeat of the season left them third from bottom on 27 points. That's one point ahead of Nuremberg and two in front of Eintracht Braunschweig with those two sides occupying the automatic relegation places. The best former European champions Hamburg can now hope for is a two-legged relegation play-off against the third-placed side in the second division to preserve their top-flight status. Bayern bounced back from Tuesday's 4-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final, second-leg to return to winning ways a fortnight before facing Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final on May 17. ""It wasn't easy after the Champions League defeat, but the win was important for us for the cup final in Berlin,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. ""I wish Hamburg the best of luck and hope they reach the play-offs. A club with their history belongs in the Bundesliga."" Bayern needed 32 minutes to take the lead as Goetze squared to Arjen Robben and then tapped home the return pass to put the champions 1-0 up. They doubled their lead when Goetze was left free to fire home Robben's corner on 55 minutes, which went in off colleague Thomas Mueller. Goetze grabbed his second when he slotted home Mueller's pass after Robben's shot was saved by Hamburg keeper Rene Adler. Hamburg pulled a goal back with 20 minutes left through Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu before Claudio Pizarro grabbed Bayern's fourth. Bayern defender Jerome Boateng was sent off just before the final whistle for striking Kerem Demirbay. The defeat means Hamburg cannot now finish outside the bottom three, the same fate befalling Nuremberg after their 2-0 defeat at home to Hanover 96. Bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, who lost 1-0 at home to Augsburg thanks to Raul Bobadilla's 94th-minute goal, were already certain of finishing in the bottom three in their first season back in Germany's top flight. As the bottom three are separated by just two points, all that remains to be decided in next weekend's final round of matches is which two go down and who goes into the play-off. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski enjoyed a 3-2 win against Hoffenheim in his final home match for second-placed Borussia Dortmund before joining Bayern next season. Hoffenheim took the lead after just five minutes when Brazilian forward Roberto Firmino beat both Germany defender Mats Hummels and Marcel Schmelzer to drill home his shot. But Dortmund roared back with three goals in five minutes before the break. Germany winger Kevin Grosskreutz slotted in a 29th minute shot, Henrikh Mkhitaryan headed home two minutes later and then Lukasz Piszczek hit their third after a mix up in the Hoffenheim defence from a free-kick. A bad mistake by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who allowed a long-range shot from Niklas Suele to fly through his legs, made it 3-2 to the hosts with 66 minutes gone. Ten-man Schalke 04 need just one more point to secure a direct Champions League place next season after their 2-0 win at Freiburg kept them three points clear of Bayer Leverkusen in third as Dutchman Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored his 59th league goal for the Royal Blues in his 100th Bundesliga game. Leverkusen kept their grip on fourth, and a Champions League play-off place, with a 2-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. But both Borussia Moenchengladbach and Wolfsburg can still claim the Bundesliga's fourth Champions League place next season. 'Gladbach's 3-1 win at home to Mainz keeps them sixth, three points from fourth, while Wolfsburg's 2-1 win at VfB Stuttgart, thanks to Ivica Olic's late goal, also keeps them in the hunt for a Champions League spot, a point below Leverkusen."

Bayern needed after 32 minutes to take the lead at Hamburg as Goetze squared to Arjen Robben and then tapped home the return pass to put the champions 1-0 up. The Bavarian giants were recovering from their 4-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final, second-leg, but doubled their lead when Goetze was left free to roam and fired home Robben's corner on 55 minutes, which went in off Germany colleague Thomas Mueller. Goetze grabbed his second when he slotted home Mueller's pass after Arjen Robben's shot was saved by Hamburg's Rene Adler. Hamburg pulled a goal back with 20 minutes left through Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu before Claudio Pizarro grabbed Bayern's fourth. Bayern defender Jerome Boateng was sent off just before the final whistle for striking Kerem Demirbay. Goetze's double states his case to start against his former club Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final on May 17 having voiced his disgruntlement after starting on the bench against Real. The defeat means Hamburg can not now finish outside the bottom three, the same fate befalling Nuremberg after their 2-0 defeat at home to Hanover 96. Bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, who lost 1-0 at home to Augsburg thanks to Raul Bobadilla's 94th-minute goal, were already certain of finishing in the bottom three in their first season back in Germany's top flight. As the bottom three are separated by just two points, all that remains to be decided in next weekend's final round of matches is which two go down and who gets a play-off. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski enjoyed a 3-2 win against Hoffenheim in his final home match for second-placed Borussia Dortmund before joining Bayern next season. Hoffenheim took the lead after just five minutes when Brazilian forward Roberto Firmino beat both Germany defender Mats Hummels and Marcel Schmelzer to drill home his shot. But Dortmund roared back with three goals in five minutes before the break. Germany winger Kevin Grosskreutz slotted in a 29th minute shot, Henrikh Mkhitaryan headed home two minutes later and then Lukasz Piszczek hit their third after a mix up in the Hoffenheim defence from a free-kick. A bad mistake by Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, who allowed a long-range shot from Niklas Suele to fly through his legs, made it 3-2 to the hosts with 66 minutes gone. Ten-man Schalke 04 need just one more point to secure a direct Champions League place next season after their 2-0 win at Freiburg kept them three points clear of Bayer Leverkusen in third as Dutchman Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored his 59th league goal for the Royal Blues in his 100th Bundesliga game. Leverkusen kept their grip on fourth, and a Champions League play-off place, with a 2-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. But both Borussia Moenchengladbach and Wolfsburg can still claim the Bundesliga's fourth Champions League place next season. 'Gladbach's 3-1 win at home to Mainz keeps them sixth, three points from fourth, while Wolfsburg's 2-1 win at VfB Stuttgart, thanks to Ivica Olic's late goal, also keeps them in the hunt for a Champions League spot, a point below Leverkusen."

109,02/05/2014,02:25,Football: Real rout boosts Hamburg's hopes against Bayern,Rafael van der Vaart says Real Madrid's 4-0 drubbing of Bayern Munich in the Champions League will boost relegation-threatened Hamburg against the Bavarian giants in Saturday's Bundesliga clash.,"Hamburg, the only club in Germany's top flight to have never gone down, sit third from bottom in the table and at risk of an historic relegation. A thousand fans watched the team go through their paces on Thursday and shouts of ""never in the second division!"" echoed around the training ground. Hamburg are five points from safety with two games left and desperately need points against champions Bayern to climb out of the bottom three. If they finish 16th, they will face a last chance play-off against the third-placed side in the second division to try to maintain their Bundesliga place. But Bayern's Champions League exit in Tuesday's 4-0 semi-final, second-leg drubbing at home to Real has given Hamburg hope, says Netherlands star Van der Vaart. ""It's a matter of survival and honour for us. If we give our all, then we also have a chance against Bayern,"" said the 31-year-old, who is hoping to play after recovering from a calf injury. But the Dutch playmaker says Hamburg must be confident against Bayern. ""We need to show some balls, Bayern won't give anything away and it would be really bad for them to lose two games in a row,"" he said. Since being confirmed Bundesliga champions with a record seven games to spare at the end of last month, Bayern have produced some below-par performances which culminated in their drubbing at the hands of Real. ""After the defeat to Real, Bayern are sure to have no great desire to get on the plane to Hamburg. We want to annoy them,"" said director of sport Oliver Kreuzer in a radio interview. The Bavarian giants have wounded pride and will be looking to bounce back at Hamburg ahead of their German Cup final against arch rivals Borussia Dortmund in Berlin on May 17. ""We need to quickly lick our wounds so we put in a better performance in the Cup final against Dortmund,"" insisted chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. Hamburg have suffered some heavy losses to Bayern recently, being routed 5-0 at home in February's German Cup quarter-finals and humbled 9-2 in Munich in the league in March 2013. Hamburg, for whom Mirko Slomka is their third coach this season after Thorsten Fink and Bert van Marwijk were both fired, are low on confidence after six defeats in their last ten games. Even Kreuzer has voiced doubts they will survive. ""There are legitimate doubts about a positive outcome. I have been waiting for weeks to see a reaction from the players,"" he fumed after Hamburg's lacklustre 3-1 defeat at home to mid-table Augsburg last Sunday, their third loss in a row. Hamburg have a few personnel worries with Germany pair Heiko Westermann, Marcell Jansen and Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu all struggling with injuries or illness. The top two places in the league are already decided with Bayern champions and Borussia Dortmund uncatchable in second. Schalke 04 are set to finish third, but the fight for fourth, which carries the final Champions League place for next season, rages on between Wolfsburg, who are at strugglers VfB Stuttgart, and Bayer Leverkusen, who are at mid-table Eintracht Frankfurt. At the other end of the table, bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig are at home to Augsburg while Nuremberg, who are 17th, host Hanover 96 with both teams knowing defeat could see them automatically relegated."
110,28/04/2014,14:45,Football: Season over for Leverkusen's Kiessling,Bayer Leverkusen must do without injured striker Stefan Kiessling in their bid to qualify for a place in next season's Champions League after the Germany international tore his left hamstring.,"Kiessling will miss Leverkusen's last two league games of the season with the 'Werkself' holding onto fourth in the league, which carries a Champions League play-off berth, by just a point from VfL Wolfsburg. Bayer crashed out of this season's Champions League with a 6-1 aggregate defeat at the hands of Paris St Germain in the last 16 and fired coach Sami Hyypia earlier this month after a run of defeats in a bid to protect their status in next season's competition. The loss of Kiessling is a blow to their hopes under caretaker coach Sascha Lewandowski with a fortnight left in the season. The 30-year-old suffered the injury in Leverkusen's 2-2 draw at home to second-placed Borussia Dortmund on Saturday and a scan confirmed the worst, meaning he will miss his side's final two matches, at home to Eintracht Frankfurt and away to Werder Bremen. Having made his last international appearance at the 2010 World Cup, Kiessling was the Bundesliga's top-scorer last season with 25 goals in 34 league games and has hit the net 19 times for Bayer this season."
111,25/04/2014,15:59,Football: Leverkusen name Salzburg's Schmidt as new coach,Bayer Leverkusen has named Red Bull Salzburg boss Roger Schmidt as their new coach for next season after the Werkself sacked ex-Liverpool captain Sami Hyypia earlier this month.,"The 47-year-old Schmidt has signed a two-year contract with Leverkusen, who are fourth in the Bundesliga and on course to qualify for the Champions League next season, having steered Salzburg to this season's Austrian title. Hyypia was dismissed in his first season in charge as head coach following a shock 2-1 defeat at Hamburg at the start of April which saw Leverkusen slip out of the top four. Schmidt will finish the season at Salzburg before taking over from caretaker coach Sacha Lewandowski, who will be in charge for Bayer's remaining three Bundesliga matches then return to his previous role as head coach of Leverkusen's junior team. ""We have opted for Roger Schmidt among many other possible alternatives as the new Bayer 04 coach,"" said managing director Michael Schade, after Eintracht Frankfurt failed in their bid for Schmidt's signature. ""He likes fast, attractive attacking football and we hope for a long-term co-operation with Schmidt."" Having neither played for, nor coached a Bundesliga side, Schmidt has spent the last two years at Salzburg and will find himself coaching in European competition next season, either in the Champions or Europa League. ""I look forward to the new challenge at a top club and I am happy to be able to work in the Bundesliga,"" said Schmidt, who only made his coaching debut at second-division Paderborn in 2011/12 and will be introduced at a press conference on July 1."

Cameroon right-wing Jacques Zoua gave Hamburg a first-half lead before Borussia equalised when captain Filip Daems tapped home a penalty after goalkeeper Rene Adler saved his initial poorly-hit effort. Gladbach made sure of the three points with two goals in the final five minutes when Brazil forward Raffael fired home a deft chip through from striker Max Kruse, then Spanish centre-back Alvaro Dominguez scored from a corner. The defeat saw Hamburg replace VfB Stuttgart, who lost 3-2 at home to Borussia Dortmund on Saturday, in 17th of the league's 18 teams on goal difference while Gladbach are sixth. Hamburg are on their third coach this season after Mirko Slomka took charge last month following Bert van Marwijk's dismissal in February while Thorsten Fink was sacked in September. Elsewhere, Werder Bremen's Austria defender Sebastian Proedl headed home a 90th-minute winner to seal their 2-1 victory at Hanover 96 to keep his side 12th and eight points from the relegation places while hosts Hanover drop to 13th. On Saturday, champions Bayern Munich dropped points for only the third time in the Bundesliga this season as they were held 3-3 at home by Hoffenheim. Hoffenheim ended Bayern's record run of 19 consecutive Bundesliga wins, giving the Munich giants a wake-up call ahead of their Champions League quarter-final first leg at Manchester United on Tuesday. Spain midfielder Thiago Alcantara has been ruled out of both quarter-final legs against United with a knee injury and is expected to miss the next six to eight weeks. Bayern leaked three goals in a Bundesliga match for the first time this season after throwing away a 3-1 first-half lead following goals by veteran striker Claudio Pizarro and Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri. Bosnia midfielder Sejad Salihovic curled in a 44th-minute free kick to make it 3-2 at the break after striker Anthony Modeste gave the guests an early lead. Hoffenheim equalised on 75 minutes when Brazilian left winger Roberto Firmino darted on to a through ball and his shot beat both Bayern centre-back Dante and goalkeeper Tom Starke. Despite the draw, Bayern still remain 23 points clear at the top of the table and extended their record unbeaten Bundesliga run to 53 matches. Germany winger Marco Reus netted a hat-trick as second-placed Borussia Dortmund fought back from two goals down to win 3-2 at ten-man Stuttgart. Dortmund, who face Real Madrid away on Wednesday in the Champions League quarter-finals, found themselves 2-0 down after just 20 minutes. Christian Gentner and Martin Harnik took advantage of poor defending to net for the hosts before Reus scored all of the guests' goals. Bayer Leverkusen hold on to fourth place despite drawing 1-1 at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig as Sami Hyypia's side struggle for form with one win in their last 11 games. Braunschweig took a shock lead through defender Ken Reichel just after the break before Stefan Kiessling slotted home a 53rd-minute penalty to spare Bayer's blushes. Fifth-placed VfL Wolfsburg are just a point behind Leverkusen after their 2-1 win at home to Eintracht Frankfurt with Brazil defender Naldo scoring their 89th-minute winner. Freiburg are unbeaten in their last four games as they enjoyed a 3-2 win at home to Nuremberg to move five points clear of the relegation zone. Mainz remain seventh but in the hunt for a European place with a 3-0 win at home to Augsburg while on Friday Schalke 04 were 2-0 winners against Hertha Berlin.

Despite Bayern's massive 25-point lead in the table and their Champions League quarter-final trip to Manchester United looming next Tuesday, mid-table Hoffenheim hope to beat the Bavarians at the 11th attempt. ""Playing Bayern is the greatest task in Germany, well probably in Europe, that a team can face at the moment,"" said Hoffenheim's team director Alexander Rosen. ""However, we have decided we want to compete and can only hope Bayern popped too many Champagne bottles."" Hoffenheim captain Andreas Beck knows the challenge his side faces with Bayern on a record run of 19 consecutive league wins and are unbeaten in their last 52 Bundesliga matches dating back to October 2012. ""We're looking forward to the Bayern duel, but we know it will be unbelievably hard,"" said the 27-year-old Beck. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, who has already won three titles after just nine months in charge, has said they are aiming to become the first team to defend the Champions League title. The ambitious Bavarians also want to become the first team to go through a Bundesliga season unbeaten, having dropped just four points in two draws all season. Bayern will be at near full-strength, but Guardiola is expected to use his bench to rest his stars ahead of Tuesday's Old Trafford clash. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund are at relegation-threatened VfB Stuttgart with illness and injury giving coach Jurgen Klopp some concerns. Both winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller have colds while right-back Lukasz Piszczek is struggling with a leg injury. ""He's more than just under the weather,"" said Klopp with the Poland international rated as doubtful. Second-from-bottom Stuttgart desperately need the three points to escape the relegation places, but Dortmund need a confidence-boosting win ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final at Real Madrid. ""The Real game is still a fair way off and I don't get the feeling that our next Champions League opponents are a topic in the changing room,"" added Klopp. Sami Hyypia's fourth-placed Bayer Leverkusen host bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig having picked up their first win in 10 matches with a 3-1 victory at Augsburg on Wednesday. With just five points separating the bottom five teams, Braunschweig boosted their chances of staying up with a 3-1 win over Mainz 05, who are chasing a top six finish and a European place next season.

They had already dropped to fourth after being knocked from third by Schalke's 2-1 win at Augsburg on Friday when Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored both goals. Bayern's relentless march to the title was helped after second-placed Borussia Dortmund suffered a 2-1 defeat at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach earlier on Saturday. Gladbach earned their first win in ten games to dent Dortmund's confidence ahead of Wednesday's Champions League last 16 clash at home to Zenit St Petersburg when they hold a 4-2 lead from the first leg. Dortmund are now just one point clear of third-placed Schalke ahead of the Ruhr Valley derby on March 25. Swiss coach Lucien Favre extended his Gladbach contract last week until 2017 and his side produced a devastating first-half spell with two goals in nine  minutes at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. Brazilian striker Raffael wrong-footed Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller on 31 minutes, then Max Kruse fired home five minutes before the break. Gladbach midfielder Havard Nordtveit was sent off for a second yellow card for the final 20 minutes and new-signing Milos Jojic pulled one back for Dortmund on 77 minutes. Mainz moved up to fifth with a sensational 4-2 victory at Hoffenheim with Japan's Shinji Okazaki netting their last two goals as the guests scored three times in seven stunning second-half minutes to come from 2-0 down. The win keeps Thomas Tuchel's Mainz in the hunt for a European spot next season and are only three points short of a Champions League berth. Wolfsburg drop to sixth after their 1-1 draw at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig as only three points separate the bottom four clubs including Freiburg, Hamburg and Stuttgart. Hertha's European aspirations suffered a setback as they lost 2-0 at home to Hanover 96 to stay ninth and four points off the top six."
128,07/03/2014,15:10,"Football: Bayern set for quiet summer, says Guardiola","As Bayern Munich close in on another Bundesliga title, coach Pep Guardiola admitted on Friday that there are unlikely to be many changes to his squad ahead of next season.","Guardiola was taken by surprise when asked about the club's plans for the summer as he prepared for Saturday's trip to play Wolfsburg. ""Next season? It's still far away. I think the base of the squad will remain more or less the same. There will be very, very few new faces,"" he admitted. ""That is more a question for Matthias Sammer,"" he added, referring to the club's sporting director. Guardiola said he had not as yet submitted any transfer wish list to Sammer or chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and refused to comment on speculation linking the European champions with the likes of Chelsea's Brazilian defender David Luiz and Barcelona's Martin Montoya. Bayern, who come into the weekend 20 points clear of nearest rivals Borussia Dortmund at the top of the table, have already confirmed two new signings for next season. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski will join from Dortmund, while 23-year-old midfielder Sebastian Rode is on his way from Eintracht Frankfurt."
129,07/03/2014,02:40,Football: Full-strength Bayern tune up for Arsenal,Runaway leaders Bayern Munich will be at virtually full strength for Saturday's Bundesliga clash at VfL Wolfsburg as they tune up for next week's Champions League clash with Arsenal.,"Long-term knee-injury victim Holger Badstuber is the only absentee as stars Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben, Thomas Mueller and Xherdan Shaqiri all return from recent knocks. Ribery, UEFA's best player in Europe last season, has not played for Bayern in more than a month after an operation on his buttocks, but made an appearance for France on Wednesday. ""I felt good, those few minutes against the Netherlands were good to get some match practice back. I'm ready,"" said Ribery after France enjoyed a 2-0 win over the Dutch. Bayern are looking to extend their record unbeaten league run to 49 matches and to claim their 11th consecutive victory. Fifth-placed Wolfsburg were hammered 6-2 at Hoffenheim last Sunday and Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer expects a backlash at the Volkswagen Arena. ""They suffered a setback in Hoffenheim and they will try and show a reaction, so we must have a few answers to that,"" said Sammer. With a 20-point lead, Bayern could even wrap up the Bundesliga title before the end of the month. Coach Pep Guardiola will want a convincing win before Tuesday's Champions League last 16, second leg at home to Arsenal with the hosts leading 2-0 from the first-leg in London. Second-placed Borussia Dortmund head to Freiburg on Sunday with a shortage of strikers. Poland's Robert Lewandowski sat out Wednesday's international against Scotland with a knee strain and Under-23 striker Marvin Ducksch is out for a fortnight with an ankle injury. It leaves Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp with only reserve striker Julian Schieber fit, but Germany winger Marco Reus could be switched to play up front. Bayer Leverkusen coach Sami Hyypia is enduring the first crisis of his career after five straight defeats as they look for a first victory in seven years at Hanover 96 on Saturday. ""My coaching career has not been very long and this is the first time that I'm in such a situation,"" said the 40-year-old ex-Liverpool defender. ""Of course, I have spoken to many people to ask advice on what I could do. ""I want to develop myself and I wouldn't be learning so fast if we weren't in this situation."" Hyypia is hoping to have defensive midfielder Sven Bender back after a dead leg. Schalke 04 are looking to bounce back from successive horror defeats when they host Hoffenheim. The Royal Blues were drubbed 6-1 by Real Madrid in the Champions League, then crashed 5-1 at Bayern last Sunday in the Bundesliga. ""We have to look forward now and give the right response on the pitch against Hoffenheim,"" said coach Jens Keller. Peru winger Jefferson Farfan is doubtful with an inflamed knee while centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos is definitely out after being sent off in Munich. At the other end of the table, VfB Stuttgart coach Thomas Schneider must avoid a ninth straight defeat when his side host bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Schneider came close to being dismissed after Sunday's 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt and another loss would surely mean the 41-year-old being fired, despite having only taken charge in August. Schneider has the fans' backing as the Mercedes Benz Arena will be sold out for only the second time this season. Relegation-threatened Hamburg host Frankfurt desperate for three points to escape the bottom three. Playing Saturday (all times 1430 GMT unless specified) Schalke 04 v Hoffenheim, Bor.

130,06/03/2014,00:17,Football: More woe for Hamburg as Jansen is ruled out,Relegation-threatened Hamburg had more bad news on Thursday as left-back Marcell Jansen returned from international duty with damaged ankle ligaments and faces a lengthy lay off.,"The 28-year-old came off after 24 minutes of Germany's lacklustre 1-0 friendly win over Chile on Wednesday and has torn the ligament in his left ankle. He will miss Saturday's key Bundesliga clash with Eintracht Frankfurt and could be out for longer as Hamburg look to avoid their first-ever relegation from the Bundesliga. With his side third from bottom, Hamburg coach Mirko Slomka may also be without striker Pierre-Michael Lasogga, who suffered a leg injury in training with the Germany squad. Slomka has already lost centre-back Slobodan Rajkovic, who is out for the rest of the season with torn knee ligaments."
131,02/03/2014,19:36,Football: Hoffenheim dent Wolfsburg's top four hopes,VfL Wolfsburg's hopes of breaking into the Bundesliga's top four suffered a setback on Sunday after being drubbed 6-2 at mid-table Hoffenheim.,"Wolfsburg finished the match with 10 men as German international Christian Traesch was sent off. Dieter Hecking's Wolves had hoped for three points in Hoffenheim to take fourth spot from Schalke 04, who were routed at runaway league leaders Bayern Munich on Saturday. Dutch striker Bas Dost had equalised for Wolves with 15 minutes gone after Roberto Firmino's fourth-minute strike gave Hoffenheim the lead, but the hosts responded with three goals. Hoffenheim led 4-1 at the break as defender Niklas Suele netted before French striker Anthony Modeste scored two goals in four minutes. Croatia forward Ivan Perisic pulled a goal back for Wolves with 15 minutes left. But the visitors had right-back Traesch sent off for a foul in the area and Hoffenheim's Sejad Salihovic netted the penalty before Modeste's replacement Sven Schipplock hit their sixth. Wolfsburg's result leaves them fifth. It means all three teams immediately behind leaders Bayern Munich and second-placed Borussia Dortmund, who beat Nuremberg 3-0 on Saturday, suffered defeats over the weekend. VfB Stuttgart are fourth from bottom after losing 2-1 at Eintracht Frankfurt in what was a club record eighth straight defeat and heaped further pressure on coach Thomas Schneider. Stuttgart striker Martin Harnik's first-half goal was cancelled out by Eintracht midfielder Jan Rosenthal ten minutes from time before captain Alexander Meier hit the 89th-minute winner. On Saturday, an Arjen Robben hat-trick saw Bayern open a 20-point lead at the top of the table with a 5-1 win over ten-man Schalke 04. The Royal Blues suffered a second drubbing in four days after losing 6-1 to Real Madrid in Wednesday's Champions League clash. Bayern extended their record unbeaten league run to 48 matches, dating back to October 2012, and earned their 15th straight league victory. Bayern raced into a 4-0 lead inside half-an-hour as left-back David Alaba netted a free-kick, then Robben scored either side of Mario Mandzukic's header. Schalke were gifted a goal when Jefferson Farfan's corner was turned into his own net by Munich right-back Rafinha, in for captain Philipp Lahm, with 25 minutes left. To compound Schalke's misery, Greece centre-back Kyriakos Papadopoulos was shown a straight red for bringing down Mandzukic in the area. His foul allowed Robben to wrap up his hat-trick with a 77th-minute penalty. Coach Pep Guardiola flippantly told reporters ""don't ask me about the title"" in broken German on Friday, but with 11 league games left, Bayern can wrap up their 24th German league title by the end of March. Dortmund went second after their comfortable win over Nuremberg as Germany defender Mats Hummels netted on his return after four weeks out with a foot injury. Poland star Robert Lewandowski scored his 15th league goal of the season before Henrikh Mkhitaryan netted their third seven minutes from time. Bayer Leverkusen's dreadful form continued with their fourth straight home defeat as they lost 1-0 at home to Mainz, who moved up to sixth with their fifth win in eight games. Cameroon striker Eric Choupo-Moting slammed home the winner past goalkeeper Bernd Leno on 37 minutes as Leverkusen suffered their eighth defeat in ten games to drop to third. Curiously, both goalkeepers scored own goals as Borussia Moenchengladbach, who are winless in their last eight games, were held to a 1-1 draw at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig."

135,21/02/2014,02:15,Football: New Hamburg boss Slomka relishing Dortmund test,New Hamburg coach Mirko Slomka has said he is relishing hosting Borussia Dortmund on Saturday as he begins the task of escaping the relegation places to ensure his new club's Bundesliga survival.,"Slomka penned a two-year deal as Hamburg coach on Monday, replacing ex-Netherlands boss Bert van Marwijk who was sacked last Saturday with the club second from bottom and on an eight-match losing streak. The 46-year-old Slomka has just 13 matches left to prevent former European champions Hamburg being relegated from Germany's top flight for the first time. And he has a tough opener against a resurgent Dortmund side who have won their last four matches and are eager to reclaim second spot in the league. Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund will be using the match to tune up for Tuesday's Champions League last 16, first-leg trip to Russia to face Zenit St Petersburg having hammered Eintracht Frankfurt 4-0 at home last Saturday. ""The challenge of facing Dortmund is a good measuring stick for us,"" said Slomka. ""Everyone knows them and how they play, but we have a home game and, as I already have said and will keep on saying, we must win our home games. ""And I am sure the fans will give their support on Saturday."" Some 800 supporters turned out to watch Slomka's first training session on Monday. The response was a far cry from their last home game when angry fans pelted the team and attacked their cars following the 3-0 defeat to Hertha Berlin two weeks ago. Both sides have injury concerns with Hamburg missing captain Rafael van der Vaart, who suffered an ankle injury in last Saturday's 4-2 loss at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig which led to Van Marwijk's dismissal. Dortmund hope to welcome back winger Marco Reus, although centre-back Mats Hummels is expected to miss out as his ankle injury continues to heal. League leaders Bayern Munich are at mid-table Hanover 96 on Sunday evening looking to maintain their 16-point lead at the top of the table and extend their unbeaten league run to 47 matches. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola will be without France winger Franck Ribery, who also missed their 2-0 win at Arsenal on Wednesday in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie as he recovers from buttock surgery. But Ribery, 30, has said he is targeting a return against Schalke 04 next Saturday. Meanwhile, Bayern's Germany midfielder Toni Kroos, who scored their first goal at Arsenal, is no closer to agreeing to a new Munich deal past 2015, with wages being the main stumbling block. ""There are no further discussions planned in the near future,"" he told German magazine Kicker with a host of Premier League clubs chasing his signature. Schalke host Mainz 05 on Friday hoping to pick up a morale-boosting fifth straight win before Wednesday's Champions League visit of Real Madrid. Both centre-back Benedikt Hoewedes and attacking midfielder Julian Draxler are set to return to the Schalke side after injury. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen need to bounce back from their 4-0 home defeat at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday. Sami Hyypia's Leverkusen have lost all of their last three home games and have suffered six defeats in their last eight matches as they prepare to travel to European hopefuls Wolfsburg.

136,15/02/2014,13:32,Football: Fulham turn to hardman Magath,"Fulham have recruited Felix Magath to preserve their Premier League status, but with a reputation for big spending and tough training methods, he comes with mixed reviews from the Bundesliga.","All of last week, the German media had touted Magath as a replacement for Dutchman Bert van Marwijk at Hamburg, where ex-Germany international Magath won the 1983 European title as a player. Reports suggest struggling Hamburg could not meet the wage demands of Magath, who was soon raving about England's Premier League as a ""fantastic working environment for every coach and footballer"". Having coached eight Bundesliga teams, this is Magath's first managerial sojourn outside of Germany and his first job in 18 months. First, the good news for Fulham supporters. The 60-year-old won three Bundesliga title with two different clubs, leading Bayern Munich to the league and cup double in both 2004-05 and 2005-06, then Wolfsburg to the 2009 Bundesliga title. He is a fitness fanatic who enjoys sending his squads on long runs, preferably up hills, and has the nickname 'Quelix' -- a crude combination of his first name and the German word for torture. As TV pundit and former Norway international Jan Age Fjortoft put it, from their time together at Eintracht Frankfurt, ""I don't know if Magath would have saved the Titanic, but the survivors would have been fit."" Fjortoft took to Twitter on Friday to sing the praises of his time working with Magath, who saved Frankfurt from relegation in 2000: ""I loved it. I was just too tired sometimes. ""Dear Fulham-fans! Never will you say again: - the players didn't run enough, the players don't train enough or the boss is not clear enough."" But there are plenty of Magath detractors after he left both Schalke and Wolfsburg with little success and a huge wage bill. Magath has had his fair share of either keeping teams up through hard work or being relieved of his duties when relegation was imminent and his players close to revolution. Fjortoft's former Frankfurt teammate Bachirou Salou once famously dubbed Magath ""The last dictator in Europe"" after one long run too many. Despite back-to-back doubles, Magath was dismissed by Bayern in January 2007 with his side fourth in the league, outside the Champions League places in those days. ""Felix Magath likes to use pressure,"" summed up Bayern captain Philipp Lahm in his autobiography. ""He leaves many players in suspense as to whether he needs them and uses this method to get the maximum out of them. ""For the players, he is very demanding, and there comes a point where they no longer stand by the coach's side."" The harmonious spell of four titles in two seasons quickly soured when results refused to go Bayern's way. ""It was a logical farewell,"" said Lahm. ""There was a fatigue-based breakdown between the coach and the team."" Magath then masterminded VfL Wolfsburg's stunning run to the 2009 Bundesliga title, including a 5-1 romp at home to his ex-club Bayern. Strikers Edin Dzeko and Brazilian Grafite both scored twice while play-maker Zvjezdan Misimovic ran riot to embarrass the Bavarian giants. Having earned the plaudits, Magath immediately left to take charge at Schalke 04, finishing his first season as runners-up. But things unravelled at the Royal Blues, where Magath was all-powerful as both director of sport and coach, leading to his dismissal the following season with poor results and a huge wage bill. ""I don't ever want to see Felix Magath again, his number has long since been deleted from my phone,"" fumed Schalke midfielder Jermaine Jones. ""Our time shared at Schalke was unbearable."" Having been dismissed by the Royal Blues in March 2011, Magath was out of a job for less than 48 hours as Wolfsburg asked him to step in after ex-England manager Steve McClaren was sacked. But with the 2009 squad dispersed, Magath failed to bring success back to Wolfsburg despite heavy investment. The team finished mid-table in 2011-12 and he left by mutual consent in October 2012 with his enormous squad bottom of the table with five points from eight matches."
137,14/02/2014,02:10,Football: Bayern welcome back Schweinsteiger as Arsenal await,Bayern Munich hope Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger will start against Freiburg in the Bundesliga on Saturday as the holders warm-up for next week's Champions League clash at Arsenal.,"The 29-year-old made his comeback after three months out with an ankle injury, playing the last 25 minutes of Wednesday's 5-0 romp at Hamburg in the German Cup quarter-finals. Schweinsteiger is set to feature at Munich's Allianz Arena as the European champions prepare to face the Gunners away in Wednesday's last 16, first leg, of the Champions League. Coach Pep Guardiola welcomed back his midfield general: ""It's super, super, super news, he has huge experience, but he still needs time."" Such is Bayern's strength in depth that they have continued to pick up wins even without the likes of Schweinsteiger and injured France winger Franck Ribery, who is out until March after an operation on his buttocks. Bayern have won all of their last nine matches, are unbeaten in a record 45 league matches and are 13 points clear in the table. Freiburg coach Christian Streich has suggested some unusual tactics against the league leaders -- to make sure Bayern enjoy themselves. ""Bayern should have fun and they only have that when they play against a good opponent,"" said the eccentric Streich, with his side 15th in the league, just above the relegation places. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund are chasing a second win this week over Eintracht Frankfurt at home. Gabon international winger Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang headed home Dortmund's second-half winner at Frankfurt in Tuesday's 1-0 cup quarter-final victory. Frankfurt climbed up to 12th in the table with a 3-0 win at home to bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig last Saturday as they bounced back from their 5-0 drubbing at Bayern the week before. Dortmund are hoping to have Germany midfielders Marco Reus and Sven Bender back after the pair both suffered thigh injuries in last Saturday's 5-1 win over Werder Bremen. ""We'll have to see, we don't want to take a risk with either of them,"" said coach Jurgen Klopp with both expected to train on Friday. There is still no news on when Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan will return to training after suffering from a virus. Bert van Marwijk is in a precarious position as he takes 17th-placed Hamburg to bottom side Eintracht Frankfurt with huge doubts over his future after a club record of six league defeats. Ex-Bayern, Schalke and Wolfsburg coach Felix Magath has already been widely tipped to replace former Holland coach Van Marwijk, who only took charge in September. Director of sport Oliver Kreuzer said he only has a job guarantee until Saturday, but another defeat could well be the Dutchman's last. Saturday's top clash sees second-side Bayer Leverkusen, who suffered a shock 1-0 cup defeat at home to second-division Kaiserslautern on Wednesday, host fourth-placed Schalke. Schalke were buoyed on Thursday when captain and centre-back Benedikt Hoewedes made a surprise return to training sooner than expected after recovering from a leg injury. ""The healing process has gone very, very well, but he still has a few problems and is still questionable,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. Keller said right back Atsuto Uchida has flown back to Japan and could face an operation for a leg injury, while midfielders Julian Draxler and Roman Neustaedter are both in the squad for Leverkusen.

139,12/02/2014,23:36,Football: Mandzukic hits hat-trick as Bayern rout hapless Hamburg,Holders Bayern Munich eased their way into the German Cup semi-finals with a 5-0 rout of hapless Hamburg on Wednesday while Bayer Leverkusen suffered a shock quarter-final exit.,"Holders Bayern have avoided rivals Borussia Dortmund in the draw for April's semi-finals. Munich will host second-division Kaiserslautern and Dortmund at home to VfL Wolfsburg with the final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium on May 17. Bayern's Croatia international striker Mario Mandzukic scored a hat-trick at Hamburg as the hosts' defence capitulated in what could be coach Bert van Marwijk's last game in charge. After setting an unwanted club record by losing all of their last six league matches, Hamburg were again trounced at their Imtech Arena with Mandzukic, Dante and Arjen Robben scoring Bayern's first three goals. Croatia's Mandzukic then added two more in as many second-half minutes as Bayern finished with a flurry. Having also lost 3-0 at home to Hertha Berlin on Saturday, Hamburg have leaked eight goals without reply in their last two games and are second from bottom in the league. Ex-Holland coach Van Marwijk's position grows every more precarious. ""They overpowered us and were outstanding,"" admitted Hamburg's director of sport Oliver Kreuzer, whose side faces bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig in the league on Saturday. ""I hope we will see a reaction from our team. ""Braunschweig aren't Bayern Munich, but with regard to everything else, I have no idea (what will happen)."" With an internal battle raging behind the scenes between Hamburg's Supervisory and Executive boards, Van Marwijk could well have had his last game in charge having only taken charge in September. Ex-Bayern, Schalke and Wolfsburg coach Felix Magath is widely tipped as the favourite to take over. Bayern were rarely troubled and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer needed 15 minutes to get his first touch of the ball and the opening goal came just six minute later. Germany midfielder Mario Goetze found some space and dribbled to the goal-line, held off his marker and squared for Mandzukic to tap home. Brazil centre-back Dante followed that up with a header four minutes later from a Toni Kroos' corner to give the visitors a 2-0 lead at the break. Holland winger Arjen Robben then chested down a beautiful long ball from Kroos and fired past Hamburg goalkeeper Rene Adler on 54 minutes. Mandzukic made it 4-0 when he profited again from another superb piece of skill from Goetze on 74 minutes, then fired home his third with 76 minutes gone. There was more good news for Bayern as Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger came on for the last 25 minutes after three months out with an ankle injury. ""Now come the games which will be decided by small things. We have to get through them,"" said Schweinsteiger, with Bayern already looking ahead to Wednesday's Champions League last 16 clash at Arsenal. Bayern will be joined in the draw for April's semi-finals by Borussia Dortmund, VfL Wolfsburg and second-division Kaiserlautern, who inflicted a shock 1-0 defeat on Bayer Leverkusen. A 114th-minute goal from Norway midfielder Ruben Jenssen was enough to see Kaiserlautern into the last four as the soul non-Bundesliga representative. Wolfsburg also booked their place with a 3-2 win at Hoffenheim with Swiss defender Ricardo Rodriguez converting two first-half penalties for Wolves, but was then sent off for a second yellow card after 70 minutes. On Tuesday, 2012 German Cup winners Dortmund booked their semi-final berth with Gabon's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang heading the winner in their 1-0 victory at Eintracht Frankfurt."

""Despite the injuries, I had no doubts in the team,"" said Klopp. ""We want to go to Berlin (for the Cup final on May 17) and you could see that from the way we played.""

AMong those missing were injured Germany midfielders Sven Bender and Marco Reus, who both suffered thigh injuries in last Saturday's 5-1 romp at Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga. Centre-back Mats Hummels was out with an ankle knock, while winger Jakub Blaszczykowski and defender Neven Subotic are out for the season with knee injuries.

Both sides had chances with Dortmund's attacking midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan firing wide as he tried to finish off a move he started while midfielders Jan Rosenthal and Johannes Flum went close for Frankfurt. ""We didn't use our chances before the break, we tried to inmpose our game on them, but it is difficult to do that against an opponent like that,"" said Eintracht coach Armin Veh. ""Nevertheless, we want to try and get something out of Saturday's match at Dortmund,"" he added referring to Frankfurt's delicate state as they are just four points above the relegation zone. Robert Lewandowski had a battle royal with his marker, Peru's Carlos Zambrano, who at one point left the Poland striker pole-axed on the turf after a sharp elbow to the ribs, which was missed by referee Knut Kircher.

Lewandowski's car was tipped forward during the suspected prank, badly damaging the front brakes. The high jinx will not be cheap. A brand-new set of winter tyres will cost around 2500 euros for Lewandowski, who is reported to earn up to four million euros at Dortmund and local police confirmed they have received a complaint for the missing tyres. Dortmund fans are suspected of carrying out the attack after the Poland striker fell out with supporters when he announced in January that he would be joining rivals Bayern Munich at the end of the season, ending weeks of speculation. Lewandowski's Dortmund contract expires in June and he leaves for Bayern on a free contract having scored 24 league goals in 31 league games last season, plus 10 in last season's Champions League, as Dortmund lost to Bayern in the Wembley final. This is not the first time Lewandowski has run into trouble with Dortmund fans. Three weeks ago, he was investigated by police after he was alleged to have struck a teenage Dortmund fan who showed him the middle finger. Lewandowski is the latest Dortmund player to leave for Bayern after Germany midfield star Mario Goetze joined the European champions after actioning a 37 million euros ($50.5m) release clause in his contract last season."

Left winger Reus suffered a torn right thigh in Saturday's 5-1 Bundesliga hammering of Werder Bremen and will be out for a fortnight, while defensive midfielder Bender has a thigh strain and misses the next week.

""From the first seconds, we saw what we want to see every week,"" said Klopp, with Dortmund third in the league and set to face Zenit St Petersburg in the last 16 of the Champions League. ""That was a game where there was nothing to criticise."" In a double-header, Frankfurt host 2012 German Cup winners Dortmund in the cup on Tuesday, then travel to Borussia's Westfalenstadion on Saturday for a league match. The double injury blow is more bad news for Klopp who lost Germany defender Mats Hummels last week after the centre-back injured his foot in a friendly and will miss the Frankfurt double-header. Klopp is already without both centre-back Neven Subotic and winger Jakub Blaszczykowski for the rest of the season as the pair have torn knee ligament injuries. Frankfurt also have a few injury concerns with captain Pirmin Schwegler carrying a rib injury and fellow midfielder Johannes Flum, who scored in Saturday's 3-0 win over bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, has a thigh strain. ""We normally do well against Borussia at home, we lost 2-1 to them earlier this season and drew 3-3 last season, which was a real spectacle,"" said Eintracht midfielder Alexander Maier. ""If we put in our best performance, we make it tough for any team to beat us and we'll try everything to pull off a shock."" European champions Bayern travel to Hamburg in Wednesday's ties while Bayer Leverkusen are home to second division Kaiserslautern, in the only non-Bundesliga clash, and Hoffenhem are home to VfL Wolfsburg. Bayern, who are on a record 45 match unbeaten league run, are peerless in the Bundesliga and are on course to repeat last year's treble of European, league and cup titles. Hamburg are in chaos having been booed by their own fans on Saturday after crashing to a sixth-straight league defeat, a club record, on Saturday as they were routed 3-0 at home by Hertha Berlin. Coach Bert van Marwijk has been given a job guarantee  by director of sport Oliver Kreuzer until at least Saturday's Bundesliga match at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, but first come Bayern in the cup.

Two goals by midfielder Andre Hahn did the damage for Augsburg, who set a new club record of nine victories in a Bundesliga season at Stuttgart's Mercedes Benz Arena. To compound the hosts' misery, Stuttgart had captain Vedad Ibisevic sent off with 53 minutes gone for a striking Augsburg's Jan-Ingwer Callsen-Bracker in the face. The defeat leaves Stuttgart 14th in the table, only two places from the relegation zone. Hamburg are also deep in the relegation mire after they were thrashed 3-0 at home to Hertha Berlin on Saturday night to set an unwelcome club record of six straight defeats. Colombia striker Adrian Ramos, who has been linked to Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund for next season, scored twice to leave Hamburg second from bottom as they were booed by their own fans at the final whistle. Several senior stars, including captain Rafael van der Vaart, found themselves pelted by missiles when they went to calm angry fans after the game. Hamburg have said they will continue with coach Bert van Marwijk, but results must improve. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund romped to a 5-1 win in Bremen on Saturday. Dortmund dismantled Werder Bremen with Poland striker Robert Lewandowski and attacking midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan both scoring twice. The thrashing came at a price as both Germany midfielders Marco Reus and Sven Bender are ruled out of this week's double header against Eintracht Frankfurt on Tuesday in the cup and in Saturday's league match. This was the 12th time this season Bremen have conceded three or more goals and coach Robin Dutt is under increasing pressure with his side 13th and just three points from the relegation places.

Frankfurt host Dortmund in the cup on Tuesday, then travel to Borussia's Westfalenstadion on Saturday for a Bundesliga match and Bender faces a race against time for the league clash. The double injury blow is more bad news for Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp who lost Germany defender Mats Hummels last week after the centre-back injured his foot in a friendly and will miss the Frankfurt double-header. Klopp is already without both centre-back Neven Subotic and winger Jakub Blaszczykowski for the rest of the season as the pair have torn knee ligament injuries.

""It was almost impossible to come back after they went 2-0 up soon after the break.""

Dortmund made their pressing game count when defender Marcel Schmelzer pounced on a mistake on the left and slid his pass in for Lewandowski to hit the top right-hand corner with 26 minutes gone. Dortmund doubled the lead at Bremen's Weser Stadion when Armenia's Mkhitaryan scored his first league goal since September as he blasted his shot into the left-hand corner four minutes from the break. Veteran centre-back Manuel Friedrich then volleyed home just after the interval to claim his first Bundesliga goal for two years.

Dutch coach Gertjan Verbeek then steered Nuremberg to a convincing 3-1 win at Hertha Berlin last Sunday and 15th in the table, but halting record-breaking Bayern's 44-match unbeaten league run is an altogether different proposition. ""We're at home, we have a run and we need the points. We'll give it all we have,"" said Nuremberg midfielder Mike Frantz. Swiss striker Josip Drmic has scored four goals in the last two matches and said while Bayern have swept aside all comers, ""we believe we can beat them"". A quick glance at the league table shows Bayern and Nuremberg are poles apart. As league leaders, Bayern are 31 points ahead of Nuremberg and while the Franconians have won just two of their 19 games so far, Pep Guardiola's Bayern have won all bar two of theirs, dropping just four points. ""We have reason to be happy,"" said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm. ""When you have a 13-point lead in the table, like we have, then we're the only ones who can trip ourselves up."" Bayern have an away quarter-final at Hamburg in the German Cup next Wednesday, then host Freiburg in the league before their Champions League last 16, first-leg away match at Arsenal on February 19. Having hammered Eintracht Frankfurt 5-0 at home last Saturday, Bayern will travel to Franconia in no mood to give away points, and anything less than a Munich win would be a shock result. ""The important big games are still to come,"" said winger Arjen Robben. ""We need to stay really relaxed and keep working."" In the pack chasing Bayern, Sami Hyypia's second-placed Bayer Leverkusen are at fifth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday, with the hosts looking for their first home win over the Werkself in 25 years. Successive defeats have seen Gladbach drop from third to fifth, but Leverkusen have also struggled with last Saturday's 2-1 win over Stuttgart breaking a three-match losing streak against opponents in the bottom-half of the table. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund travel to Werder Bremen looking to close the four-point gap behind Leverkusen. Dortmund were dealt some bad news on Wednesday when Germany defender Mats Hummels was ruled out for two weeks with strained ankle ligaments, having only just returned from a two-month break after injuring his heel on the same foot. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp expects to have Greek defender Sokratis available after his wife gave birth to their baby daughter on Wednesday. Klopp said new signing Milos Jojic is set to make his debut soon after the attacking midfielder has impressed in training. Struggling Bremen are 12th and looking for just their sixth league win of the season and their third at home. ""The fans in the stadium should see that we have given our all until the final whistle,"" said Austria midfielder Zlatko Junuzovic. ""We need to run until we puke."" At the other end of the table, there is an important basement battle as bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig are at 14th-placed Eintracht Frankfurt, who are just a point above the relegation play-off spot.

The centre-back only made his return in Friday's 2-1 win at Eintracht Braunschweig after two-months out after injuring his right heel against England in a friendly international. A scan on the ankle showed the November injury has fully healed, but the new ligament strain will need a fortnight's rest. With Dortmund third in the table, Hummels will miss Saturday's league match at home to Werder Bremen, plus two matches against Eintracht Frankfurt within four days, first in Tuesday's German Cup quarter-finals, then in the Bundesliga. Hummels' injury is more bad news for Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp with both centre-back Neven Subotic and winger Jakub Blaszczykowski out for the rest of the season with torn knee ligament injuries. The loss of Hummels means Klopp will again be down to his fourth-choice centre-back in either veteran Manuel Friedich or teenager Marian Sarr alongside Greek centre-back Sokratis. There was some good news for Klopp on Tuesday as attacking midfielder Jonas Hofmann scored twice and new-signing Milos Jojic made his debut in the win over Fortuna."

""They showed from the start who was the boss,"" enthused ex-Bayern president Franz Beckenbauer. ""At the break they could have been three of four-nil ahead."" Germany star Goetze put the hosts ahead when he chested down Mario Mandzukic's cross and slammed his shot inside the far post with only 12 minutes gone. France star Ribery then proved he has recovered from a leg injury when he added Bayern's second just before the break. Likewise, Robben came off the bench and fired home Goetze's final pass to put his leg injury behind him on 67 minutes before Dante headed Bayern's fourth two minutes later. Fittingly, Mandzukic, who was dropped ten days ago for poor training performances, netted their fifth on 89 minutes and was mobbed by his team-mates. ""He has reacted really well and today was a super performance,"" enthused Bayern's director of sport Matthias Sammer.

There was drama on the stroke of 90 minutes when Nuremberg midfielder Ondrej Petrak was sent off for saving a shot with his hand.

On Saturday, second-placed Bayer Leverkusen broke their three-match losing streak with a 2-1 win at home to VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga. Swiss striker Eren Derdiyok headed home Leverkusen's winner six minutes from time. Stuttgart's Moritz Leitner had given the visitors an early lead before Bayer striker Stefan Kiessling equalised in the first half. Schalke 04 moved up to fourth with a 2-1 victory at home to ten-man VfL Wolfsburg with Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng firing home the winner nine minutes from time. The Royal Blues, who have lost just once in nine games, had taken an early lead after a scrappy goal was credited to Brazilian centre-back Felipe Santana as both he and Boateng lunged for the ball. Wolfsburg drew level despite being down to 10 men, after Daniel Caligiuri was sent off for insulting the referee five minutes into the second-half, when teenager Maximilian Arnold fired home on 65 minutes. But Boateng then fired home the winner for his sixth goal of the season to give Schalke their second straight win. Hanover 96's revival under new coach Tayfun Korkut continued as they earned a 3-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach with Senegal's Mame Diouf scoring twice. There was a strong South Korean influence in Mainz's 2-0 win at home to Freiburg as Park Joo-Ho and Koo Ja-Cheol netted to lift Mainz to seventh.

But despite their status as overwhelming favourites to retain the title this season, Guardiola says they cannot afford to take their eye off the ball, particularly following Wednesday's last-minute 2-1 victory at VfB Stuttgart. ""If a team doesn't lose 43 times and everyone says that the Bundesliga (title-race) is over, with the championship is secured, it's not easy for the player's to stay focused,"" said Guardiola. ""To always win, win, win -- I know how difficult that is."" The victory gave Bayern yet another league record as they went 28 away matches unbeaten, breaking Hamburg's previous mark of 27 set in 1983.

But despite their status as overwhelming favourites to retain the title this season, Guardiola says they cannot afford to take their eye off the ball, particularly following Wednesday's last-minute 2-1 victory at VfB Stuttgart. ""If a team doesn't lose 43 times and everyone says that the Bundesliga (title-race) is over, with the championship is secured, it's not easy for the player's to stay focused,"" said Guardiola. ""To always win, win, win -- I know how difficult that is."" The victory gave Bayern yet another league record as they went 28 away matches unbeaten, breaking Hamburg's previous mark of 27 set in 1983. Last season they broke or equalled 25 Bundesliga records, winning the title with a record six games to spare, as they finished up with a 25-point margin.

163,25/01/2014,20:35,Football: Leverkusen slump again to leave Bayern 10 clear,Champions Bayern Munich remain ten points clear in the Bundesliga after second-placed Bayer Leverkusen suffered a shock 3-2 defeat at strugglers Freiburg on Saturday -- their third-straight league loss.,"Bayern extended their record unbeaten run in the Bundesliga to 42 matches with a 2-0 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach on Friday. But Sami Hyypia-coached Leverkusen were stunned at Freiburg as the hosts twice came from behind before midfielder Felix Klaus hit the dramatic 90th-minute winner. ""We were okay in the first-half, then we gave away too much ball and Freiburg counter-attacked us,"" admitted Hyypia. ""They were dangerous, we tried to win the game, but then came the final counter attack."" The result saw Freiburg climb out of the bottom three up to 15th as the hosts cancelled out goals by Bayer midfielders Lars Bender and Simon Rolfes. Leverkusen have lost their last three games after finishing 2013 with league defeats to strugglers Frankfurt and Bremen. Bayern can extend their lead even further with a trip to VfB Stuttgart on Wednesday in a re-arranged fixture. Borussia Dortmund clawed their way up to third place on goal difference over Moenchengladbach with a 2-2 draw at home to Augsburg with Lars's twin brother Germany midfielder Sven Bender netting for both sides. The Dortmund midfielder gave the hosts the lead at Westfalenstadion after just six minutes, then turned the ball into his own net on 56 minutes for Augsburg's equaliser. Turkey midfielder Nuri Sahin looked to have spared Bender and Borussia's blushes with a brilliant free-kick to make it 2-1 with 20 minutes left. But Augsburg drew level when South Korea's Ji Dong-Won -- who will play for Dortmund next season -- headed home just two minutes after coming on to leave his side ninth in the table. ""There was too much tension in our play, the joy of playing in a wonderful game like this was hardly to be seen,"" mused Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""We got more tense as the game wore on and our game didn't improve, it just got more and more loose."" The point looks to have come at a cost as Poland Jakub Blaszczykowski winger is thought to have torn his cruciate knee ligament. Should the injury be confirmed, he will be the second Dortmund star sidelined with a long-term knee injury after centre-back Neven Subotic suffered the same injury in November. ""We have only bad news,"" said Klopp. ""For us this is a disaster, but mainly it's terrible for Kuba (Blaszczykowski)."" Borussia picked up their first point at home after three consecutive defeats in Dortmund, and have taken just five points from their last seven league games. They are now 14 points behind Bayern while fifth-placed VfL Wolfsburg also lost ground as they suffered a 3-1 defeat at home to Hanover 96. New coach Tayfun Korkut celebrated his first game in charge with Hanover's first away win of the season after eight straight defeats. The result put a dampener on Kevin de Bruyne's debut after the Belgium midfielder became Wolfsburg's record signing last weekend when he moved from Chelsea. Hanover took the lead through striker Artjoms Rudnevs, which was cancelled out by Croatia striker Ivica Olic's first half tap-in. A pair of second-half goals by ex-Dortmund midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt sealed the welcome win for Hanover. Nuremberg also celebrated a milestone as they became the last team in a major European league to pick up their first win of the season with a 4-0 victory over Hoffenheim. Likewise, Eintracht Frankfurt picked up their first home win of the season with a shock 1-0 win to move up to 14th against sixth-placed Hertha Berlin. Mainz are up to eighth after a 2-1 win at Stuttgart as Japan striker Shinji Okazaki scored for the visitors on his return to Stuttgart."

""Today we were pushed to our limits, Bayern dominated us,"" admitted Gladbach striker Max Kruse. ""At the moment, they are a class apart and they showed that they want to be German champions as soon as possible."" With their main rivals all playing on Saturday, the European champions took the chance to tighten their stranglehold on the title as they played the first of three league games in 10 days. ""We're happy to get the win and the three points, this isn't an easy place to come and get a win,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. Guardiola sprang a surprise before kick-off at Borussia Park as striker Mario Mandzukic was left out of the squad for ""poor performances in training"" with midfielder Goetze starting up front. ""Mario hasn't trained like he normally does,"" explained Bayern's director of sport, Matthias Sammer. Injured France winger Franck Ribery sat out the game while Dutch star Arjen Robben only came on in the dying stages after recovering from a cut leg, but the Bavarians had few problems. Goezte clipped the 'Gladbach post with just five minutes gone, but the Germany star was not to be denied two minutes later.

Munich put the result beyond doubt after a goalmouth scramble as Goetze had a shot blocked, only for the ball to clip Gladbach midfielder Granit Xhaka on the arm and referee Peter Gagelmann signalled for a penalty. Mueller rifled home the spot-kick on 54 minutes to double their lead, while Gladbach could only waste the few chances which came their way.

The Bavarian giants face three league games in ten days as they tackle VfB Stuttgart on Wednesday in a postponed fixture, then host Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday February 2. The aim for the Bavarians now is to produce another eye-catching performance to dispirit the chasing pack. ""We must show the competition that there is nothing to pick up in terms of points,"" said Germany forward Thomas Mueller. ""We mustn't show any weak points and give rise to any hope. ""We can't go half-hearted into these games, the supposedly mighty FC Bayern won't be given any favours."" Bayern's thirst for titles is unsatiable at present having added the Club World Cup in December to August's UEFA Super Cup title after last season's treble of European, league and domestic cup titles. But Pep Guardiola's team were given a wake-up call in a friendly last Saturday when hosts Red Bull Salzburg inflicted a 3-0 defeat on Bayern, which set off a few ""alarm bells"", according to Mueller. ""We need to get out of holiday mode,"" said the 24-year-old as the Bundesliga returns after a four-week break. ""Gladbach will want to take something out of this. ""If an opponent is aggressive and doesn't crap their pants, then we can also have a few problems to deal with."" Gladbach usurped Borussia Dortmund from third place in the league with a strong finish to 2013. Borussia Park has uncomfortable memories for Bayern who lost 3-1 there in January 2012, having also gone to Gladbach as league leaders, and they had to fight back from 3-1 down in May before sealing a 4-3 win. ""It will be a hotly-contested game, if we aren't focused, there will be a result like there was in Salzburg,"" said Bayern's ex-Gladbach defender Dante. Dortmund, who are down to fourth place, need to break a three-match losing streak in the league at home when they host Augsburg on Saturday. Bayern, Leverkusen and Hertha Berlin all enjoyed wins at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion towards the end of the year and coach Jurgen Klopp's side enjoyed a 6-1 friendly drubbing of minnows Duisburg on Tuesday. Klopp will still be without the injured trio of midfielder Ilkay Gundogan (back), plus defenders Mats Hummels (ankle) and Neven Subotic (knee). Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen will also want to bounce back from their 1-0 defeat at Werder Bremen in December when they travel to face third-from-bottom Freiburg on Saturday."

Leverkusen and Dortmund's defeats means Pep Guardiola's Bayern can go ten points clear if they beat VfB Stuttgart in their catch-up fixture on January 29. Second-placed Leverkusen fell to a late goal at strugglers Werder Bremen, whose Argentinian right-back Santiago Garcia stabbed his shot home to give Bremen a first win in six games.

""We controlled the game, but we didn't score a goal and lacked a bit of belief. ""It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, but all in all we can be happy with the first half of the season."" Borussia Dortmund's poor league form continued with a 2-1 defeat to Hertha Berlin, their third straight home defeat, which threatens to see them finish the weekend outside the automatic Champions League places. Despite reaching the knock-out stages in Europe as group winners, Dortmund have picked up just four points in their last six league games. ""We allowed our opponents to get back in the game and didn't take our chances in the second half,"" lamented Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""Hertha got brave and realised there was something to be had after the second goal, while we allowed ourselves to become too hectic."" Borussia took an early lead at home when captain Sebastian Kehl put through a superb ball for Marco Reus and with his first touch, the Germany winger put his shot past 18-year-old Hertha goalkeeper Marius Gersbeck, who was making his Bundesliga debut. But Hertha got back on level terms when striker Adrian Ramos hit his 11th goal of the season after Hertha's Sami Allagui put in a cross for the Colombia forward to convert on 23 minutes. Tunisia forward Allagui then gave Hertha the lead by pouncing on a mistake by Dortmund's teenaged centre-back Marian Sarr, rounding Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller and firing into an empty net on the stroke of half-time. Klopp substituted the clearly distressed Sarr for the start of the second-half, moving left-back Kevin Grosskreutz into centre-back, but his side failed to grab a precious equaliser despite seven minutes of added time. Dortmund stay third but will drop to fourth if Borussia Moenchengladbach pick up at least a point at home to VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday. Nuremberg finish 2013 as the only team in a major European league without a win so far this season after they were held to a goalless draw at home to Schalke 04. The Royal Blues were without coach Jens Keller, who has been told a decision on his future will be made over the winter break, as the 43-year-old was suffering with flu. The point was enough to see Nuremberg stay 17th, leaving Eintracht Braunschweig bottom on goal difference despite their 1-0 win over Hoffenheim. Freiburg extended Hanover 96's appalling away record to eight consecutive defeats with a 2-1 win to help the hosts in their bid to escape the bottom three.

Dutt is waiting on the fitness of captain Aaron Hunt as the veteran midfielder struggles with a calf injury. ""There is a big question mark against him, he would be a big loss,"" said Dutt. Third-placed Borussia Dortmund, who are 12 points behind Bayern and five adrift of Leverkusen, host Hertha Berlin looking for only their second league win in five games. Four points from those five matches has been a poor return and coach Jurgen Klopp is hoping to get some of his stars off the injured list to try to turn things around. Germany left-back Marcel Schmelzer could feature after a calf tear but it is still too early for defensive midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, who has at least trained with the squad this week. The 23-year-old has not played since injuring his back in Germany's friendly draw against Paraguay in August. And Klopp is also without both centre-backs Neven Subotic and Mats Hummels. Yet rather than looking forward to seeing the back of 2013, he remains eager to get their title challenge back on track. ""I'm not ready yet for Christmas,"" he said. ""We have had a great week of training and we could get down to some good work. The team are up for it."" Nuremberg host Schalke 04 on Saturday evening still looking for their first win of the season -- the only team in Europe's major leagues without a victory so far. Should Dortmund falter against Berlin, fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach can usurp them from third when they host VfL Wolfsburg on Sunday. Gladbach are unbeaten in their last seven games and enjoyed a six-match winning streak before being held to a goalless draw at Mainz last Saturday."

Lazio coach Vladimir Petkovic said they were relieved by the draw. ""It could have been worse, but it's to be taken with a pinch of salt.

They don't have our international experience but it's a worthy team. We're favourites, but we have to do our utmost to win.""

Freiburg squandered a couple of clear chances before Wolfsburg's Germany defender Marcel Schafer came off the bench for Olic to score their third in added time. Freiburg remain third from bottom with a third straight defeat and to make matters worse they had French midfielder Francis Coquelin, on loan from Arsenal, carried off with a suspected broken ankle just after the break. Hertha Berlin stayed seventh and kept hosts Eintracht Braunschweig rooted to the bottom of the table with a 2-0 away win. Colombia striker Adrian Ramos headed Berlin into a first-half lead before 20-year-old midfielder Tolga Cigerci added a late second with his first for the club. On Saturday, France star Franck Ribery produced a commanding display as Bayern Munich extended their record unbeaten Bundesliga run to 40 matches with a 7-0 away romp at Werder Bremen. Ribery boosted his claim for the 2013 world footballer of the year award, which will be announced on January 13, by creating two goals and scoring twice in the rout. Bayern, who last lost in the German league in October 2012, produced their biggest win so far under Pep Guardiola, cutting Bremen's defence to tatters. The victory was short of the Bundesliga's 57-year-old record of 9-0 for an away win and was Werder's heaviest home league defeat. Bremen coach Robin Dutt kept the team on the pitch for a stern lecture as they dropped to 14th after just two wins in their last 10 games. Belgium's Daniel van Buyten, Croatia's Mario Mandzukic plus Germany's Thomas Mueller and Mario Goetze also joined Ribery on the scoresheet after Bremen scored an own goal. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen stayed four points behind Bayern with a hard-fought 1-0 win at third-placed Borussia Dortmund, who now find themselves six points behind Leverusen and ten points behind Munich. South Korea striker Son Heung-Min hit the 18th-minute winner after Leverkusen's attack pounced on a mistake by Dortmund defender Manuel Friedrich for Son to score his fifth goal in his last three games against Borussia. Both sides finished with 10 men in a tense affair. Dortmund lost both defensive midfielders Sven Bender and Nuri Sahin during the match with ankle injuries. Germany's Bender has been ruled out of Wednesday's Champions League game at Marseille with a sprained ankle, while Sahin has a torn ligament and is rated extremely doubtful. ""Miracles happen repeatedly, but it does not look good,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. Fourth-placed Borussia Moenchengladbach drew level on 31 points with Dortmund as they picked up their sixth-straight win with a 2-1 win at home to ten-man Schalke 04. Schalke must beat Swiss champions FC Basel on Wednesday to reach the Champions League's knock-out phase and another defeat could be coach Jens Keller's last having only been in charge since December last year. Eintracht Frankfurt stayed just above the relegation places after losing 2-1 at home to Hoffenheim while Hamburg, who had been steadily climbing the table under ex-Holland manager Bert van Marwijk, slumped to a 1-0 defeat at home to Augsburg.

""There will be a lot said about this until our next game against (Hertha) Berlin (on Friday), but we have to stay very focused on what has become an important game for us."" Ribery, who started his first Bundesliga match for nearly a month after a rib injury, gave Bayern the lead when his cross was turned into the net for an own goal by Werder's Congo defender Assani Lukimya on 21 minutes. Towering Belgian centre-back Daniel van Buyten then doubled Bayern's lead six minutes later when he headed home from a corner before Ribery added their third on 38 minutes when he simply tapped home Thomas Mueller's cross from the right wing. With exactly an hour gone, Ribery provided the cross for Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic to fire into an empty net for the fourth.

On Tuesday, Chelsea can also clinch progress with just a point in Switzerland, while Arsenal could wrap up qualification too.","Group E FC Basel (SUI) v Chelsea (ENG) Knocked out in the group stage last season as the defending champions, Chelsea need just a draw against Basel in Switzerland to clinch their place in the last 16, and a fourth successive win in Group E will see the Blues advance as winners of the section. Chelsea won at St Jakob-Park last season in the semi-finals of the Europa League but will be wary of the Swiss champions, having lost 2-1 when they met in London in September. Chelsea come into the game fresh from a 3-0 win at West Ham United that left them in third place in the Premier League. They have lost just one of their last 13 games in all competition, while Basel remain clear at the top of the Swiss Super League and have lost just once in 19 outings. Steaua Bucharest (ROM) v Schalke 04 (GER) Schalke come into matchday five in second place in Group E, and a win in Romania coupled with a defeat for Basel against Chelsea will see the Bundesliga club through to the knockout stages. The Royal Blues were comfortable 3-0 winners when the sides met in Gelsenkirchen in September but they can be infuriatingly inconsistent and threw away a two-goal lead before needing a late Benedikt Hoewedes equaliser to earn a 3-3 draw at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on Saturday. Coach Jens Keller described that result as ""maddening"". He is still without long-term injured Klaas-Jan Huntelaar for the visit to the Romanian capital to face a Steaua side who are unbeaten domestically but without a win in Group E.

If the Gunners win at the Emirates Stadium, they will qualify for the last 16 should Borussia Dortmund fail to win at home to Napoli. A draw will be enough if Dortmund lose. Meanwhile, Marseille are already eliminated but could yet steal third place and a Europa League berth with the right combination of results. That seems unlikely, though, especially with coach Elie Baup having fitness concerns over Andre-Pierre Gignac and Mathieu Valbuena. Premier League leaders Arsenal - who won 2-1 in southern France in September - welcomed back Theo Walcott after injury in Saturday's Premier League victory over Southampton. Borussia Dortmund (GER) v Napoli (ITA) Last season's beaten Champions League finalists Borussia Dortmund could be eliminated with one round of group games still to play if they fail to beat Napoli in Germany and Arsenal beat Marseille. Such a threat is very real for Jurgen Klopp's team, who suffered a shattering 3-0 home defeat at the hands of Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga on Saturday as they struggle to cope with a defensive injury crisis. Neven Subotic, Mats Hummels and Marcel Schmelzer are all sidelined. Napoli beat Dortmund 2-1 in Italy and a win here will seal their place in the last 16. However, they also come into the game on the back of a disappointing domestic result at the weekend, a 1-0 home loss to Parma damaging their title prospects in Serie A. Group G FC Porto (POR) v Austria Vienna (AUT) Two-time European champions Porto need to win at home to Austria Vienna at the Estadio do Dragao as they chase Zenit for second place in Group G and a spot in the last 16. The Portuguese side won 1-0 in Vienna in September thanks to a second-half Lucho Gonzalez goal but have taken just one point in their subsequent three matches, losing at home to Zenit and Atletico Madrid. Paulo Fonseca's side are undefeated in their domestic league just now and sit top, but were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Nacional on Saturday, leaving the pitch at full-time to jeers from their supporters. Those fans will not tolerate another slip-up against an Austrian side who have registered just one point in Group G so far and failed to score a single goal. Zenit St Petersburg (RUS) v Atletico Madrid (ESP) Atletico are already through to the last 16 as the only side apart from defending champions Bayern Munich to win their first four group games. Diego Simeone's side are already certain to finish first in Group G too, so the Argentine coach has rested key players for the trip into a Russian winter, Diego Costa and David Villa among those left at home. The clash with Zenit comes on the back of a stunning 7-0 win against Getafe that kept them in contention at the top of La Liga. Zenit have only won once so far in the group and were beaten 3-1 in Madrid in September, but a win at the Petrovski stadium will take them through to the last 16 should Porto fail to win later on Tuesday. Group H Ajax (NED) v Barcelona (ESP) Remarkably, Barcelona's 4-0 win against Ajax in September was the first ever competitive meeting of two European giants linked by iconic former player and coach Johan Cruyff. Now they meet in Amsterdam for the first time, with Barcelona already through to the last 16 and needing just a point to be sure of winning Group H. The Catalans - who are top of La Liga - are without a host of injured players just now, including world player of the year Lionel Messi and goalkeeper Victor Valdes. Ajax beat Celtic in their last group game to keep alive their chances of progressing and come into this match fresh from a 3-0 win against Heracles in the Eredivisie at the weekend. Celtic (SCO) v AC Milan (ITA) This tie at Celtic Park is a crunch encounter in the race for the second qualifying spot in Group H. Milan head to Glasgow in second place and will be through if they win and Ajax lose at home to Barcelona. However, the Rossoneri are a club in crisis just now, their 1-1 weekend draw with Genoa leaving them in the bottom half of Serie A and sparking protests from angry fans. Celtic are bottom of the group but they are a formidable prospect at home and beat Milan 2-1 in Glasgow's East End in the group stage of the competition in 2007. A repeat this time would take the Hoops above Massimiliano Allegri's side in the standings."

But Bert van Marwijk's Hamburg brushed off the loss of their skipper to claim their first home win in six attempts. ""It was a hard-fought victory for us with both teams under pressure. Hanover are going through a difficult time while we needed to finally win at home,"" said Van Marwijk. ""We haven't improved much, but we are better organised and we gave fewer balls away."" Hanover's Hungary midfielder Szabolcs Huszti put his side ahead when he hit the top left corner from 16 metres with 28 minutes gone. But the hosts responded with Croatia's Milan Badelj equalising three minutes later before right-wing Maximilian Beister slipped his marker just a minute into the second-half to head home. Beister then turned provider as he found 19-year-old Turkey midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu in space and the attacking midfielder fired home for the third six minutes from time. Hanover's Senegal defender Salif Sane was sent off in the dying stages for a second yellow card to compound the guests' misery. It was Hanover's eighth match without a win, their sixth straight away defeat, and saw Mirko Slomka's side drop to 13th in the league. Werder Bremen slumped to 12th and their third defeat in four games, as they went down 3-2, despite a late fight back, at home to seventh-placed Mainz 05, for whom Japan's Shinji Okazaki scored twice. On Saturday, Bayern Munich's Germany star Mario Goetze came off the bench to score the opening goal in the European champions' comprehensive 3-0 win at his ex-club Borussia Dortmund. Goetze, who joined Bayern for 37 million euros (US$50m) in July after 12 years at Dortmund, gave the perfect reply to the chorus of boos he received on his return to Borussia's Westfalenstadion. The 21-year-old smashed home a Thomas Mueller pass on 66 minutes, before the floodgates opened and Arjen Robben and Mueller added late goals in the final five minutes. Bayern capped a commanding performance by beating Dortmund for the first time in seven Bundesliga attempts, dating back to February 2010. It was Munich's first win in Dortmund since September 2009. ""We're happy, we won against the best counter-attacking team in the world,"" said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. Again, Munich ran out winners in a replay of May's Champions League final as Dortmund had been forced to patch together their entire back four after a spate of injuries. But there can be no excuses as Bayern extended their record unbeaten run in the Bundesliga to 38 matches and opened a seven-point lead over Dortmund, who drop to third. Bayer Leverkusen warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Manchester United by going second with a 1-0 win at Hertha Berlin. The win came at a cost as Germany winger Sidney Sam was ruled out of the United clash after tearing a thigh muscle four minutes into the game. Sixth-placed Schalke, who are away to Steaua Bucharest in the Champions League on Tuesday and are second in Group E behind Chelsea, drew 3-3 at Eintracht Frankfurt. They raced into a 2-0 lead after only 18 minutes but leaked three goals in 12 disastrous second-half minutes. Germany defender Benedikt Hoewedes saved Schalke's blushes when he hit the top-right hand corner to equalise with just four minutes left. Wolfsburg's four-match winning streak, which has seen them climb to fifth in the league, was ended when they were held to a 1-1 draw at second-from-bottom Nuremberg. Freiburg stay in the relegation places despite their 1-0 win at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig, while Augsburg are up to tenth after their 2-0 win at Hoffenheim. On Friday, Borussia Moenchengladbach stayed fourth with a 2-0 win at VfB Stuttgart, their fourth straight win, with goals by Brazil's Raffael and Sweden's Oscar Wendt."

Play often got bogged down in the middle of the park and Bayer's fancy footwork failed to find a way through the rugged Shakhtar defence. Bayer, who had rested a string of first-team regulars for the weekend defeat to Bundesliga bottom club Eintracht Brunswick, pushed for an away win, but were a long way from repeating their remarkable 4-0 win in Germany in the previous fixture. For Shakhtar it continued a dismal run against German opposition, as they have not beaten a Bundesliga side on home soil for 32 years when Eintracht Frankfurt were the victims in a UEFA Cup tie. But at least they did what coach Mircea Lucescu demanded, and ""put things right"" after their unfortunate drubbing in Germany. Shakhtar had the lion's share of possession and forced six first-half corners to Bayer's none, but it was the Germans who carved out the half's best chance after 24 minutes. Burly Shakhtar defender Viacheslav Shavchuk upended Son Heung-Min outside the area and from the resultant free kick, Gonzalo Castro brought an acrobatic save from the Ukrainian 'keeper Andriy Piatov, diving smartly to his right to hold the ball cleanly. Shortly afterwards, Bayer's Germany midfielder Sidney Sam broke through the Shakhtar defence but put his shot from the edge of the area tamely wide. In reply, Shakhtar's Croatian captain Darijo Srna rattled the woodwork on the half hour, his mighty shot from far out on the right striking the far post and rebounding back into play. Leverkusen came out of the blocks fighting at the start of the second half but for all their pressure, they failed to break the resolve of Piatov, who was equal to everything the Germans bombarded him with. But in the end it was a satisfactory result for Bayer, whose coach Sami Hyypia had predicted the game would leave them ""very close to qualifying for the knockout stages"". After the game, he beamed: ""You play to win, but tonight a point is OK. ""Bernd played well, all in all, we fought well and had a few good opportunities to score. The second half was much better for us than the first."""
193,04/11/2013,02:25,"Football: Real Madrid, Bayern, United edge close to last 16",Defending champions Bayern Munich as well as former winners Real Madrid and Manchester United are on the verge of making the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday.,"AFP Sports previews Tuesday's eight games on matchday four: Group A Shakhtar Donetsk (UKR) v Bayer Leverkusen (GER) Both these sides suffered league defeats at the weekend -- Shakhtar going down 2-0 at Volyn Lutsk, which was the third defeat on the road for Mircea Lucescu's men, while Leverkusen were embarrassed 1-0 by rock-bottom Eintracht Braunschweig to fall four points behind Bayern Munich. Leverkusen's fit-again Lars Bender, who signed a contract extension in midweek, received a late red card for his second bookable offence while Stefan Kiessling, Sidney Sam and Heung-Min Son were all on the bench at the start. The Germans won the first tie between the two sides last month, a comprehensive 4-0 home win which put them on six points, one behind Manchester United. Shakhtar, who were quarter-finalists in 2011, have not beaten a German side at home in Europe since seeing off Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1980/81 UEFA Cup. Real Sociedad (ESP) v Man Utd (ENG) United can virtually ensure their last 16 place with victory in Spain after a 1-0 home win over Sociedad, playing in the tournament for the first time in 10 years, in Manchester moved them onto seven points from three games. But David Moyes's side have doubts over the fitness of Jonny Evans, Rafael da Silva and Tom Cleverley, who were all replaced at half-time in Saturday's 3-1 win at Fulham. ""It will be a difficult test against (Real) Sociedad,"" said Moyes. ""To go and play against any side in Spain who have qualified will be a hard test, but we will go over there and try and get a good result that will continue our good form in the group."" Sociedad have scored just once in three Champions League games so far and are without a point but warnmed up for Tuesday with a confidence-boosting 5-0 home win over Osasuna. Jagoba Arrasate's side are looking to avoid setting a club-record sequence of four straight defeats in Europe. Group B Juventus (ITA) v Real Madrid (ESP) Real Madrid have nine points from three games after a Cristiano Ronaldo double ensured a 2-1 win over Juventus last time out and they need just a point in Turin to make sure of a last-16 place. Nine-time winners Madrid have scored in all their last 19 Champions League away fixtures, losing only four but Juventus have won the last five meetings between the sides in Turin. Juventus are in third place and with that position in mind coach Antonio Conte rested Andrea Pirlo in Saturday's 1-0 win at Parma before the veteran midfielder replaced Claudio Marchisio. Ronaldo has scored seven times for Real Madrid in the Champions League this season just one off the record held jointly by Ruud van Nistelrooy, Filippo Inzaghi and Hernan Crespo. On Saturday, Real beat Rayo Vallecano 3-2 with a Ronaldo double and a Karim Benzema header as Gareth Bale laid on two goals for the second consecutive game. Real will be without left-back Fabio Coentrao after he limped off with an ankle injury. Xabi Alonso is also a doubt but Raphael Varane will return at the heart of the defence after being rested against Rayo. Copenhagen (DEN) v Galatasaray (TUR) Galatasaray won the first match 3-1 in Istanbul to put themselves in second spot in the table, five points behind Real but two ahead of Juve and three up on Copenhagen. The Danes drew 1-1 with Juve and lost 4-0 at Real Madrid while Galatasaray recovered from their opening 6-1 drubbing to the Spaniards to draw 2-2 with Juventus in Roberto Mancini's first game as coach. Copenhagen's home record in the tournament gives some cause for optimism -- in eight matches, they have lost only to Chelsea and have beaten Manchester United and drawn with Barcelona in previous years. For Galatasaray, Copenhagen holds special memories -- in 2000, a Fatih Terim-led team overcame Arsenal on penalties in the UEFA Cup final. Group C Paris Saint Germain (FRA) v Anderlecht (BEL) The French side can qualify for the knockout stages for the second successive year with victory over an Anderlecht team they walloped 5-0 in their previous encounter a fortnight ago to make it three impressive wins from three games in an admittedly easy group. The only good news for Anderlecht is that there are doubts over whether Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who scored four in the first match, will be fit as he was rested for the 4-0 Ligue 1 win over Lorient last Friday -- extending PSG's unbeaten Ligue 1 run to 23 -- with an inflamed knee. Anderlecht are searching for their first point and first goal of the campaign while their last away win in the Champions League came in the 2005/06 season at Real Betis. Olympiakos (GRE) v Benfica (POR) A lot at stake in this match as with both on four points, and Anderlecht on zero, they are battling for the runners up spot and a place in the last 16 or the third-place finish that guarantees a spot in the Europa League knockout stage, a competition in which the Portuguese outfit reached the final last season only to lose to Chelsea. The sides drew 1-1 in Lisbon, and Olympiakos will be looking to repeat their 5-1 win the last time they hosted Benfica in the Champions League in the 2008/09 campaign. Three Benfica players remain from that thumping including striker Oscar Cardozo, who was only on the bench that night but will be hoping to lead the line on Tuesday. Similarly Kostas Mitroglou should be up front for the hosts and eager to add to his tally of goals, having earlier this term become the first Greek player to score a hat-trick in the Champions League, admittedly against the porous Anderlecht defence. Group D Manchester City (ENG) v CSKA Moscow (RUS) City made heavy weather of beating the Russian outfit a fortnight ago in a match overshadowed by a racism controversy but look in sharper form after a 7-0 demolition of Norwich on Saturday, their biggest win in the top flight since 1968. Victory over the Russians would all but assure them of reaching the knockout stages for the first time after two flops under Roberto Mancini. The Italian's successor, Chilean Manuel Pellegrini showed his ruthless side when he dropped Joe Hart from the Norwich game and Romanian Costel Pantilimon may well keep his place for the CSKA game. City's talismanic central defender and captain Vincent Kompany is still struggling with a thigh injury and missed the Norwich game. CSKA come into the game on the back of a come from behind 2-1 win over Volga with impressive Ivorian striker Seydou Dumbia on the scoresheet. Viktoria Pilsen (CZE) v Bayern Munich (GER) The Germans are proving as unbeatable as PSG are, their 2-1 win over Hoffenheim on Saturday equalling the Bundesliga record for the longest unbeaten run, levelling the 36 matches unbeaten Hamburg achieved between January 1982 and January 1983. Victory on Tuesday, and CSKA failing to win at City, will see the holders qualify for the last 16. However, not all is rosy in the Munich camp as they are still struggling to impose themselves early in their matches. ""Obviously it's not such a wonderful situation,"" said Mario Goetze, who caused Pilsen all sorts of problems once he came on in the second-half of their match a fortnight ago, which ended in an easy 5-0 win for the German side. Pilsen have an impressive home record in the competition winning 10 out of 11 before City beat them this season. Bayern, though, are closing in on their record of successive away wins in the competition, six on their way to winning the 1996 title, as victory on Tuesday would be their fifth in a row."

Stuttgart spent the last six minutes with 10 men after Germany Under-21 centre-back Antonio Ruediger was shown a straight red for hitting Dutch midfielder Van der Vaart in the ribs. ""We have improved again and are playing football the way I like it,"" said Van Marwijk as Hamburg rallied at 3-2 down after ex-Arsenal defender Johan Djourou conceded a second-half own goal. ""We had a couple of really nice attacks, which pleased me. We had a bit of bad luck with the own goal."" After a draw at Frankfurt and a 5-0 hammering of Nuremberg, the point kept Hamburg 15th, having been in the bottom three when Van Marwijk took over, while Stuttgart are eighth.

With Bayern finally making their 80 percent possession pay off, Goetze fired in a cross for Mario Mandzukic to score their third on 69 minutes. And when Bayern vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was fouled in the area, Mueller stepped up to drill home the penalty for his second of the game eight minutes from time.

""I am happy with the result, we knew it would be difficult,"" said Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""We started well, but then got weaker, but for me it was decisive that the lads dealt with the situation. ""We can play better football and we will."" Borussia stay second and level on 22 points with third-placed Leverkusen, just a point behind Bayern. Second-from-bottom Freiburg picked up a point with a goalless draw at Werder Bremen, while Eintracht Frankfurt drew 1-1 at home to Nuremberg. Later Saturday, Hertha Berlin can go fourth if they beat Borussia Moenchengladbach at home, while on Sunday Hamburg host VfB Stuttgart and Augsburg are home to Wolfsburg."
202,19/10/2013,17:49,Football: Unbeaten Bayern close in on league record,Bayern Munich extended their unbeaten Bundesliga run to 34 games on Saturday by coming from behind for a 4-1 home win over Mainz to go back top of the Bundesliga.,"Having last lost in the German league back in October 2012, Bayern are now just two matches short of Hamburg's 30-year-old, 36-match streak. Bayern were punished for a poor first-half in Munich when Mainz striker Shawn Parker fired home after capitalising on a mistake by centre-back Jerome Boateng. But Bayern roared back when Germany midfielder Mario Goetze came off the bench for the second-half and played a key part in the hosts' first three second-half goals. His dream pass through to Arjen Robben allowed the winger to equalise on 50 minutes and two minutes later, Goetze combined with the Dutchman for Germany's Thomas Mueller to fire home to make it 2-0. With Bayern finally making their 80 percent possession pay off, Goetze fired in a cross for Mario Mandzukic to score their third on 69 minutes. And when Bayern vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was fouled in the area, Mueller stepped up to drill home the penalty for his second of the game eight minutes from time to make it 4-1. Bayern's win put them back on top of the Bundesliga after Bayer Leverkusen had briefly gone top on Friday thanks to a controversial 'phantom' goal in their 2-1 win at Hoffenheim. The German Football Federation (DFB) are set to investigate while Hoffenheim have called for a replay after Stefan Kiessling's 70th-minute winner came in bizarre circumstances. Replays showed his header only ended in the back of the net after flying through a hole in the side netting and a DFB sports court is set to meet on Monday. Schalke, who host Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday, needed a 91st-minute winner from Roman Neustaedter to seal a 3-2 win at bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig. Having only picked up their first win of the season a fortnight ago against Wolfsburg, Braunschweig gave Schalke an almighty scare before Germany's Neustaedter hit the winner. Borussia Dortmund, who are at Arsenal on Tuesday in the Champions League, stayed second with a hard-fought 1-0 win at home to Hanover 96. Germany winger Marco Reus hit the winning penalty after just four minutes when Hanover's Japan defender Hiroki Sakai fouled left-back Erik Durm in the area. Sakai was shown a yellow card for the foul and Reus blasted home the spot kick as Dortmund picked up the three points. Borussia stay second and level on 22 points with third-placed Leverkusen, just a point behind Bayern. Second-from-bottom Freiburg picked up a point with a goalless draw at Werder Bremen, while Eintracht Frankfurt drew 1-1 at home to Nuremberg. Later Saturday, Hertha Berlin can go fourth if they beat Borussia Moenchengladbach at home, while on Sunday Hamburg host VfB Stuttgart and Augsburg are home to Wolfsburg."
203,06/10/2013,19:24,Football: Hamburg rout Nuremberg to power out of bottom three,Hamburg powered out of the Bundesliga's bottom three with a stunning 5-0 win at Nuremberg on Sunday to give Bert van Marwijk his first victory as their coach.,"Germany Under-21 striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga needed just eight second half minutes to claim his first Bundesliga hat-trick in a devastating spell as Hamburg scored four goals in just 14 minutes. ""It's great to get the hat-trick, but it's more important that things went so well for the team,"" said Lasogga, who claimed the fastest away hat-trick in Bundesliga history. This was only the second game for Van Marwijk, 61, who coached Holland to the 2010 World Cup final. He replaced Thorsten Fink last month after a disastrous start left Hamburg in the relegation places. The Dutchman has promised to tighten Hamburg's defence, but it was their attack which ran riot at Nuremberg. ""I like attacking football, although tactical discipline belongs to that and we still lose the ball too often, but it's getting better,"" said Van Marwijk, whose reign opened with a draw at Frankfurt last week. ""A 5-0 win doesn't happen every week, but it's important to help the self-confidence come back."" Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart opened the scoring with a superb scissor-kick volley on 17 minutes. The Hamburg captain then provided the final passes for Lasogga to fire home his first two goals while the ex-Hertha Berlin forward completed the hat-trick when he pounced on a loose ball and smashed his shot inside the inside post. Midfielder Tolgay Arslan bagged the fifth 16 minutes from time to leave Nuremberg reeling. The rout lifts Hamburg up to 14th, while Nuremberg slip into the bottom three. On Saturday, European champions Bayern Munich went top for the first time under Pep Guardiola after a 1-1 draw at Bayer Leverkusen. Bayern extended their unbeaten run to 33 Bundesliga games and are closing in on Hamburg's record of 36, set in January 1983, as the Bavarians returned to the site of their last league defeat in October 2012. Previous leaders Borussia Dortmund lost top place after suffering a shock 2-0 defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach earlier in the day. In a high-tempo clash at Leverkusen's BayArena, Germany midfielder Sidney Sam's 31st-minute equaliser for the hosts cancelled out Toni Kroos' opening goal for Bayern. Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno guaranteed a point for his side by denying Franck Ribery twice in as many second-half minutes, then Mario Goetze, while Thomas Mueller had a penalty appeal turned down. But Guardiola was a picture of frustration, brooding on the Bayern bench and drumming his fingers as Bayern enjoyed 27 shots on goal and 78 percent possession, but managed just a single goal. The point was enough to send Bayern top, with Leverkusen third, behind Borussia Dortmund. Fresh from their impressive 3-0 Champions League win over Marseille, Dortmund were set to claim an away point until a disastrous final 10-minute spell, triggered by Mats Hummels' red card. The Germany defender was sent off on 81 minutes after a reckless challenge on 'Gladbach's Norway midfielder Havard Nordtveit in the area. Germany striker Max Kruse netted the resulting penalty, then Brazilian forward Raffael hit their second four minutes from time to see 'Gladbach move up to fourth. Schalke 04 came from behind to claim a 4-1 win over 10-man Augsburg in Gelsenkirchen to move up to eighth. VfB Stuttgart dropped to seventh after their 1-1 draw at home to Werder Bremen while Hoffenheim stayed 10th with a 2-2 draw at Mainz. Eintracht Braunschweig, who have been bottom of the table since last season's promotion, picked up their first win of the season with a shock 2-0 victory at VfL Wolfsburg -- their first Bundesliga victory since 1985. Despite the win, Braunschweig stay bottom of the table on goal difference but level on points with 17th-placed Freiburg who drew 1-1 at home to ten-man Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday."

Midfielder Karim Bellarabi scored the opening goal after 30 minutes before Congo forward Domi Kumbela put the result beyond doubt with a late second. The win lifted Braunschweig off bottom place with Freiburg, who host Frankfurt on Sunday, dropping down to last place.

Goalkeeper Michel Vorm believes that Swansea can take heart from their record at home in European competition this season despite injury worries and a 2-1 home defeat to Arsenal in the Premier League at the weekend. The Welsh outfit could be without captain Ashley Williams with an ankle ligament problem, with right-back Angel Rangel (ankle) and wingers Roland Lamah (toe) and Pablo Hernandez (thigh) also in a race for fitness. ""We have a few injuries which is disappointing, but we have coped quite well and I don't think we feel tired,"" said Vorm. ""If we want to grow as a team and a club we want to play in Europe. ""We have to make sure we are fit to play all those games."" ""Ash is very important for us and Angel is also a player with a lot of experience,"" said Vorm. ""Ash is a leader, of the team, of the group, on the pitch and off the pitch. ""It's hard when he's missing, but he is injured and we have to cope with it."" Vorm believes Swansea's past record at home, with European victories against both Swedish side Malmo and Petrolul Ploiesti of Romania this season, will boost morale. ""We have played some of the big sides, but in he past we have made it a bit more difficult for them at home,"" added Vorm. ""That's something I think we have to do."" Meanwhile, Valencia, the 2004 UEFA Cup winners and two-time Champions League finalists, are desperate for all three points as they travel to Kuban Krasnodar, who lost 2-0 to St Gallen on matchday one.

The 25-year-old Traore then scored his first league goal of the season when he latched onto Christian Gentner's pass behind the defence to slot home on 76 minutes. Traore then found acres of space on the left wing and his cross was converted by Austria's Martin Harnik four minutes from time to inflict a sixth defeat from seven games on Braunschweig. Earlier, Werder Bremen and Nuremberg fought out a six-goal thriller with Dutch winger Eljero Elia scoring twice for the hosts for a 3-3 draw. Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake played a key role in sparking Nuremberg's fight back from 2-0 down with a first-half goal before his superb pass saw Czech midfielder Adam Hlousek hit the equaliser. Bremen raced into a 2-0 lead after Nuremberg defender Berkay Dabanli turned the ball into his own net before Elia bagged his first with a superb shot on 34 minutes.

219,27/09/2013,02:20,Football: Wolves face tough task against on-song Bayern,VfL Wolfsburg admit they face an uphill task in their bid to try and stop Bayern Munich's march to the top of the Bundesliga table on Saturday.,"Bayern are on a 31-match unbeaten streak in the Bundesliga and last tasted defeat at home to Bayer Leverkusen in October 2012. Pep Guardiola's side go into the weekend's matches in second place in the table, trailing leaders Borussia Dortmund on goals scored before facing the Wolves at the Allianz Arena. Having blitzed Schalke 4-0 in Gelsenkirchen last Saturday in the league and routed Hanover 96 4-1 in the German Cup on Wednesday, Bayern are showing signs of further progress under Guardiola since he succeeded Jupp Heynckes as head coach in June. Bayern saw off Hanover with a side featuring the likes of Diego Contento, Xherdan Shaqiri, Daniel van Buyten and Claudio Pizarro as Guardiola rotated his squad before Saturday's visit of the Wolves and next Wednesday's Champions League clash away to Manchester City. However, the reigning European champions want more silverware and are endlessly looking for ways to improve, so there was a little frustration with the nature of Wednesday's performance. ""We shifted down a gear after going 2-0 up and Hanover were immediately right back in the game, we can't let that happen again,"" said Thomas Mueller, who scored twice in the German Cup second-round win. In contrast, Wolfsburg team manager Mike Schuessler admitted he ""didn't find many weaknesses"" after watching Guardiola's Bayern, while director of sport Klaus Allofs said: ""We'll need a good performance to get a result there."" Ex-Bayern midfielder Luiz Gustavo will be back in the Wolfsburg side after serving a one-match ban while another former Munich star, Ivica Olic, should be able to play despite carrying an ankle injury and Brazilian midfielder Diego should be fit too. Bayern have no new injury concerns with Spain midfielders Javi Martinez and Thiago Alcantara working their way back to fitness after minor operations. Elsewhere, league leaders Dortmund host Freiburg on Saturday with a question mark over left-back Marcel Schmelzer after the Germany defender aggravated a thigh injury in the 2-0 German Cup win over second-division 1860 Munich. Schmelzer is back in training, ""but whether that is enough for Saturday, we'll have to see,"" said coach Jurgen Klopp, whose team face Marseille in the Champions League next Tuesday. Dortmund are definitely without right-back Lukasz Piszczek, who is recovering from hip and groin surgery, midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, who has a back injury, and captain Sebastian Kehl, who has torn ankle ligaments. Dortmund dropped their first points of the season in last Saturday's 1-1 draw at Nuremberg, while Freiburg have yet to win a match this season after three draws and three defeats. Bayer Leverkusen boss Sami Hyypia has said there will be changes to his team on Saturday at fourth-place Hanover 96 ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash at home to Spain's Real Sociedad. However, Australia's Robbie Kruse is looking to make his second start for the club after netting twice in last Saturday's 4-1 rout of Mainz. Ex-Holland coach Bert van Marwijk has taken charge at struggling Hamburg, and the Hanseatic club are looking for only their second win of the season as they go to Eintracht Frankfurt. HSV are already in the relegation zone after a disastrous start to the season and the 61-year-old van Marwijk was named as Thorsten Fink's successor on Monday after signing a two-year deal worth 1.4 million euros ($1.9 million) a year. ""My mission is to look at the structures in place and clarify the style of play,"" said Van Marwijk, who inherits a side who have been routed 5-1 and 6-2 by Hoffenheim and Dortmund respectively this season. ""We have to leave the bottom of the table as quickly as possible."" Fixtures (kick-offs 1330 GMT unless stated)"
220,22/09/2013,19:44,Football: Boateng backs Bayern to get better and better,Jerome Boateng believes Bayern Munich will only get better having closed the gap at the top of the Bundesliga by sending Schalke crashing to their worst home defeat in over 30 years.,"Pep Guardiola's second-placed Bayern are now level on both goal difference and points with leaders Borussia Dortmund after Saturday's 4-0 win at Schalke. ""We're improving from game to game and we will get better from week to week,"" said centre-back Boateng whose Bayern side host Hanover 96 in the second round of the German Cup on Wednesday. It was Schalke's worst home league defeat since May, 1981. Guardiola, who took charge of the European champions in June, hailed Bayern's display. ""That was our best performance so far in the Bundesliga, we dominated against one of the best teams in Germany,"" said Guardiola after his side enjoyed 70% ball possession against Schalke. Despite a bright opening 20 minutes, Jens Keller's Schalke undid their good work as first Munich vice-captain Bastian Schweinsteiger, then striker Mario Mandzukic were left unmarked in the area to head home. Schweinsteiger, back in the starting side after straining ankle ligaments last month, smashed home Arjen Robben's corner on 21 minutes and 99 seconds later, Mandzukic converted David Alaba's cross. France winger Franck Ribery and then replacement striker Claudio Pizarro added late goals as Schalke's four-match winning run came to an abrupt halt. Bayern have now gone 31 games without losing a Bundesliga match and have recorded 26 league wins and five draws since losing 2-1 loss to Leverkusen in October 2012. Having won their first five league games, league leaders Dortmund stumbled as left-back Marcel Schmelzer's first-half free-kick was cancelled out by Nuremberg centre-back Per Nilsson's second-half strike. Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp brought a weakened team with centre-back Mats Hummels missing with a back injury. Star striker Robert Lewandowski and midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan started on the bench and were rested after Borussia's 2-1 Champions League defeat at Napoli on Wednesday. Both Schmelzer and attacking midfielder Marco Reus are doubtful for Tuesday's German Cup second-round match at second division 1860 Munich after picking up leg injuries. Bayer Leverkusen are third after their 4-1 win at Mainz 05 as Australia star Robbie Kruse scored two first-half goals, his first Bundesliga goals for Leverkusen since joining from Fortuna Duesseldorf. The 24-year-old drilled home a pass from Germany winger Sidney Sam after 19 minutes, set up Sven Bender for Leverkusen's second, then converted a pass from captain Simon Rolfes for Bayer's third just before half-time. The league's joint top-scorer Stefan Kiessling then scored his fifth goal of the season when he headed home unmarked early in the second half, before Mainz midfielder Yunus Malli netted a late consolation. Hanover 96 stay fourth after a 2-1 win at home to Ausgburg with Hungary midfielder Szabolcs Huszti netting an 89th-minute penalty. After sacking coach Thorsten Fink last week in the wake of their 6-2 drubbing at Dortmund, Hamburg slumped to their fourth defeat of the season, losing 2-0 at home to neighbours Werder Bremen. Wolfsburg moved up to sixth with a 2-1 win at home to Hoffenheim as Croatia's ex-Bayern striker Ivica Olic scored both Wolves goals. On Sunday, VfB Stuttgart drew 1-1 with Eintracht Frankfurt, a result which left both teams in mid-table. Stuttgart striker Vedad Ibisevic missed two clear chances including a 93rd-minute penalty. After successive defeats, Hertha Berlin picked up their first point in three games with a 1-1 draw at Freiburg. Striker Admir Mehmedi's early goal for Freiburg was cancelled out by Norway international midfielder Per Skjelbred's first-half equaliser. Despite the point, Freiburg remain second from bottom after three draws and three defeats, while Berlin are tenth."

222,16/09/2013,17:44,Football: Hamburg's Fink under fire after Dortmund drubbing,Hamburg coach Thorsten Fink's job is on the line after his chairman lambasted the faltering team's defence on Monday.,"Hamburg were drubbed 6-2 at Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund on Saturday, leading to chairman Carl Edgar Jarchow's astonishing public rebuke of his coach. Jarchow said he expects to see an improvement quickly, or else he and the board may be tempted to act. ""I take the long-term view, but on the board we expect things to be implemented,"" Jarchow told SID, an AFP subsidiary, on Monday. ""In Dortmund, it was a repeat of the debacle against Hoffenheim -- defence is our weak point and these mistakes must be eliminated. ""That is his (Fink's) job."" Hamburg are 15th -- just above the relegation zone -- after five games, but more worryingly they have conceded 15 goals -- 11 of which came in just two games. Having been hammered 5-1 at home by Hoffenheim in mid-August, Fink's defence again collapsed against Dortmund, despite recovering from 2-0 down to equalise just after half-time. With Dortmund's Poland striker Robert Lewandowski and Germany winger Marco Reus, plus new signings Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang running riot, Hamburg's defence leaked four goals in 16 minutes during a second-half horror show. ""We were naive and lost almost every one-on-one,"" fumed Fink after Dortmund peppered the Hamburg goal with more than a dozen shots on target. Hamburg also capitulated 9-2 at Bayern Munich last March and the Hamburg board are running out of patience with Fink, who took charge in October 2011. After the Hoffenheim defeat, Fink gave his players two days off, then threw left-back Dennis Aogo out of the squad before he was sold to Schalke 04, while centre-backs Slobodan Rajkovic and Michael Mancienne were told they have no future at the club. The 4-0 drubbing of Eintracht Braunschweig last month failed to mask Hamburg's defensive frailties and Fink now faces a make-or-break clash against north German neighbours Werder Bremen in the Bundesliga on Saturday. Jarchow left no doubt that defeat in that game could spell the end for Fink. ""One thing is for sure, that is a very important game for everyone,"" said Jarchow. Bremen are just one place above Hamburg in the league and suffered their third consecutive defeat when they went down 3-0 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. ""Everything depends on this game,"" insisted club captain Rafael van der Vaart."

Striker Anthony Modeste gave Hoffenheim the lead just before the break, then provided a superb through ball for Volland to pounce on, turn the defence and hit the bottom right-hand corner. ""It was a great pass from Anthony, things are going well for me, I worked hard in pre-season which gave me confidence,"" said the Germany Under-21 skipper. ""I just want to have a good season with Hoffenheim and anything else would just be a bonus,"" he added when asked about a possible call up to Joachim Loew's senior Germany side. Gladbach pulled a goal back when Swedish striker Branimir Hrgota powered through the Hoffenheim defence fifteen minutes from time, but the defeat left Lucien Favre's side in mid-table. Later, bottom side Eintracht Braunschweig picked up their first point of the season after four defeats with a 1-1 draw at Nuremberg, with the hosts also in the bottom three. On Saturday, Borussia Dortmund picked up their fifth win to maintain their 100 percent record with a 6-2 romp at home to Hamburg to stay top of the league. After Pep Guardiola's Bayern had briefly claimed top spot with a 2-0 win over Hanover 96, Dortmund replied by routing Torsten Fink's Hamburg in emphatic style. New signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice, as did Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, as Champions League runners-up Dortmund pulled away after Hamburg had levelled at 2-2. New signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Germany winger Marco Reus also scored as Dortmund took control after Hamburg's defenders Zhi-Gin Lam and Heiko Westermann had put their side level. All four Bundesliga teams -- Dortmund, Bayern, Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke -- warmed-up for their first Champions League matches in mid-week with comfortable wins over the weekend. Bayer Leverkusen prepared for their Old Trafford trip to face Manchester United on Tuesday with a convincing 3-1 win over 10-man VfL Wolfsburg to stay third. Germany winger Sidney Sam put the hosts ahead before Wolfsburg's Croatia striker Ivica Olic levelled just before the break. Stefan Kiessling netted twice to give Leverkusen their fourth win from their opening five games, heading home on 65 minutes before slamming in his second in added time. Wolfsburg were reduced to 10 men when ex-Bayern Munich midfielder Luiz Gustavo was sent off in the final 10 minutes, for the second time this season. The Brazilian had only just returned from suspension after being dismissed in the 2-0 defeat at Mainz at the end of August. Schalke 04, who host Steaua Bucharest on Wednesday, continued their revival by picking up their second victory with a 1-0 win over Mainz. New signing Kevin-Prince Boateng hit the first-half winner in only his second league match since arriving from AC Milan. The victory lifts the Royal Blues up to ninth, while Mainz remain fifth. Werder Bremen crashed to their third straight defeat when they went down 3-0 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt after new signing Franco di Santo was sent off for kicking an opponent in the face. Czech Republic striker Vaclav Kadlec scored two first-half goals before Austria defender Sebastian Proedl added a late own-goal to complete Bremen's misery. Augsburg needed a 90th-minute winner from midfielder Tobias Werner to seal a 2-1 win at home to Freiburg. On Friday VfB Stuttgart earned a 1-0 win in the capital against Hertha Berlin to pick up their second win under caretaker coach Thomas Schneider."

""That was simply awesome, it was fun just to watch,"" beamed Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. ""Towards the end, my heart was singing and apart from the two goals we conceded, we defended well."" New signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted twice, as did Poland striker Robert Lewandowski, as Champions League runners-up Dortmund pulled away after Hamburg had levelled at 2-2. Borussia raced into a 2-0 lead after 22 minutes as Aubameyang celebrated his first start with the opening goal before fellow new signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan added the second. Hamburg responded as defender Zhi-Gin Lam scored his first goal with a thunderbolt from outside the area on 26 minutes, before centre-back Heiko Westermann headed the second on 49 minutes. But Dortmund then hit top gear as Aubameyang grabbed his second by burying Mkhitaryan's pass before the Gabon winger set up Lewandowski for Dortmund's fourth. With Hamburg's defence in disarray, Germany winger Marco Reus slotted past goalkeeper Rene Adler, then Lewandowski compounded the guests' misery when he headed the sixth just shy of the final whistle. Borussia remain the only Bundesliga side with a 100 percent record after five games ahead of Wednesday's trip to Napoli in their Champions League opener. Earlier, second-half goals by Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic and France winger Franck Ribery gave Bayern the three points at Munich's Allianz Arena in their win over Hanover 96. It was the ideal preparation for Pep Guardiola's team who begin their Champions League campaign at home to CSKA Moscow on Tuesday, but director of sport Matthias Sammer was far from happy.

232,01/09/2013,17:50,Football: Resurgent Stuttgart slaughter Hoffenheim,VfB Stuttgart romped to a 6-2 Bundesliga win over Hoffenheim on Sunday with striker Vedad Ibisevic netting a hat-trick after coach Bruno Labbadia was sacked last week.,"Stuttgart picked up their first points of the season after three straight defeats led to Labbadia's dismissal last Monday with his team in the relegation places. Caretaker coach Thomas Schneider got off to an emphatic start as Stuttgart's Romania striker Alexandru Maxim did the damage by scoring two goals and setting up two more while Bosnia striker Ibisevic claimed a hat-trick. ""It was a fun game for us, we gave it our all after a tough week,"" said Ibisevic, who was sporting a black-eye after receiving a stray boot in the face late on. ""That was a reaction from the events of the last few weeks."" The result lifts Stuttgart out of the bottom three and into 14th and leaves Hoffenheim 11th after their first defeat of the season. Borussia Dortmund can usurp defending champions Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table if they win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday evening. On Saturday, Bayer Leverkusen blew the chance to go top as they lost their 100 percent record with a 2-0 defeat at resurgent Schalke 04. Both Germany left-back Dennis Aogo, who has joined Schalke on loan from Hamburg, and Ghana midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, who signed a four-year deal from AC Milan on Friday, started as the Royal Blues picked up their first league win of the season. Schalke went ahead with half an hour gone when a free-kick went in off midfielder Marco Hoeger's right shoulder before Peru forward Jefferson Farfan made sure of the win when he drilled home an 83rd-minute penalty after being hauled down in the area. Mainz 05 also lost their 100 percent record and wasted their chance to go top as they crashed to a 4-1 defeat at Hanover 96. Mainz took a 12th-minute lead through striker Nicolai Mueller, but Senegal striker Mame Diouf and Poland forward Artur Sobiech put the hosts 2-1 up at the break before Ivory Coast forward Didier Ya Konan and midfielder Edgar Prib doubled the lead. Elsewhere, struggling Hamburg picked up their first win of the season after two consecutive defeats with a 4-0 thumping of promoted Eintracht Braunschweig. Dutch international Rafael van der Vaart put Hamburg ahead in the seventh minute on their first attack before Cameroon striker Jacques Zoua doubled the lead on 17 minutes as the hosts counter-attacked at pace. Hamburg confirmed their first three points -- and Braunschweig's fourth straight defeat to leave Eintracht bottom of the table -- when 19-year-old Turkish midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu came on for van der Vaart on 79 minutes to claim a brace, including a stunning free-kick. Meanwhile, Borussia Moenchengladbach moved up to seventh as they romped to a 4-1 home win over Werder Bremen. Venezuelan winger Juan Arango opened the scoring on 36 minutes with a wonderful strike from the left and Gladbach then added three more in the second half, including one from German international forward Max Kruse. Norway midfielder Havard Nordtveit's 69th minute own-goal proved to be a mere consolation for Robin Dutt's Bremen, who have now lost two on the bounce. Wolfsburg enjoyed a 2-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin with Ivica Olic and Diego on target, while Augsburg picked up their second straight win with a 1-0 success at Nuremberg thanks to a late goal from substitute Kevin Vogt."

That makes me proud,"" said Schalke coach Jens Keller. ""We implemented everything we had planned. Both Kevin-Prince Boateng and Dennis Aogo did really well on their debuts."" Schalke recovered from losing their opening two Bundesliga games against Wolfsburg and Hanover 96 to qualify for the Champions League group stage at the expense of Greek club PAOK on Tuesday and built on that success with what was a convincing home league win against Leverkusen. Keller's side took the lead with half an hour gone when a free-kick went in off midfielder Marco Hoeger's right shoulder before Peru forward Jefferson Farfan made sure of the win when he drilled home an 83rd-minute penalty after being hauled down in the area. Earlier Mainz 05 lost their 100 percent record and wasted their chance to go top as they crashed to a 4-1 defeat at Hanover 96. Mainz took a 12th-minute lead at Hanover through striker Nicolai Mueller, but Thomas Tuchel's side suffered their first defeat after three straight wins as Senegal striker Mame Diouf levelled before Poland forward Artur Sobiech put the hosts in front before the break. Hanover doubled their lead late on with Ivory Coast forward Didier Ya Konan and midfielder Edgar Prib both scoring in the last 10 minutes for Mirko Slomka's side. ""We started out well and were disciplined, not allowing Hanover any chances,"" said Tuchel. ""Out of the blue, we conceded an equaliser and it was striking to see the body language.

But it is the meeting with Valencia that will most excite the fans of Swansea, who won the English League Cup last season under their Danish manager. Laudrup has close links to Spain, having played for Barcelona and Real Madrid and later coached both Getafe and Mallorca. He famously took Getafe to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup in 2008, only losing to Bayern Munich in extra-time. And he has injected a heavy Spanish influence into his Swansea side, with ex-Valencia winger Pablo Hernandez one of seven Spaniards in the squad. Meanwhile, Tottenham Hotspur were handed a kind-looking draw, the Londoners finding themselves in Group K along with Sheriff Tiraspol of Moldova, Tromso of Norway and Anzhi Makhachkala of Russia. Anzhi would have been a fearsome proposition had their billionaire owner Suleiman Kerimov not recently decided to drastically reduce the budget, leading to a mass exodus of players, most notably Samuel Eto'o, who has gone to Chelsea. Tromso, meanwhile, lost in the play-offs to Besiktas but replaced the Turkish side, who have been banned from European competition for their role in a domestic match-fixing scandal in 2011. FA Cup holders Wigan Athletic will also face Russian opposition in the shape of Rubin Kazan, with Slovenian champions Maribor and Zulte Waregem of Belgium completing the Group D line-up. Elsewhere, highly-fancied Italian side Fiorentina were drawn in Group E with wealthy Ukrainian club Dnipro, who are coached by Juande Ramos, the Spaniard who led Sevilla to successive UEFA Cup triumphs in 2006 and 2007 Other notable match-ups include French Cup holders Bordeaux facing Eintracht Frankfurt of Germany in Group F, a section that also includes APOEL. The Cypriots were lucky play-off round losers, being drawn out of a hat to replace Fenerbahce after they, too, were banned from Europe for their role in the Turkish match-fixing scandal. In Group H, Sevilla will face Freiburg, the Germans who surprisingly finished fifth in last season's Bundesliga, while after losing to Real Sociedad in the Champions League play-offs, French club Lyon were drawn against Spanish opposition once again, facing Betis in Group I. Dutch club AZ Alkmaar completed the line-up on Friday, being drawn in Group L after beating Atromitos of Greece on away goals. They played out the remainder of their second leg the morning after a fire at the AZ Stadion had led to its abandonment after 59 minutes. The first group games will be played on September 20."

Elsewhere, Bundesliga club Stuttgart - who last weekend sacked coach Bruno Labbadia and replaced him with youth coach Thomas Schneider - drew 2-2 at hone to Rijeka of Croatia to exit the competition 4-3 on aggregate. The Germans conceded the decisive goal in the fourth minute of injury time. Former European champions Feyenoord were eliminated by Kuban Krasnodar, while Spartak Moscow were surprisingly ousted by modest Swiss club St Gallen, and it was a shocking night for French clubs as Saint-Etienne and Nice were knocked out by Esbjerg of Denmark and Apollon Limassol of Cyprus respectively. That completed a miserable week for French sides in general after Lyon lost to Real Sociedad of Spain in the Champions League play-offs on Wednesday. In contrast, Premier League clubs Tottenham Hotspur and Swansea City had few problems coming through their ties and take their place in Friday's group-stage draw in Monaco. Spurs boss Andre Villas-Boas fielded a fringe team that remained more than strong enough to beat Georgia's Dinamo Tbilisi 3-0 on the night and 8-0 on aggregate. Jermain Defoe scored twice at White Hart Lane, while Lewis Holtby was also on target. Swansea, meanwhile, lost to 2-1 to Petrolul in Romania, but had already done the hard part by winning 5-1 in the first leg in Wales. Roland Lamah scored Swansea's goal, while Michael Laudrup's team had captain Leon Britton sent-off late on. Other leading names to progress on Thursday were Spain's Sevilla and their city neighbours Betis, Eintracht Frankfurt and Dynamo Kiev. Fiorentina of Italy also advanced, although only on away goals after losing 1-0 at home to Grasshoppers Zurich. Thursday's winners will be joined in the group-stage draw by the losers from the Champions League play-offs and the seven clubs to qualify automatically, including English FA Cup holders Wigan Athletic, Coppa Italia winners Lazio, Valencia of Spain, Freiburg of Germany and French Cup holders Bordeaux. The final place - left open following Fenerbahce's two-year ban from European competition - will be taken by one of the play-off round losers, with UEFA pulling one of the lucky losers out of a hat on Friday morning."

""Yes, it's not the first time we've met and we know each other well,"" said Guardiola of the self-styled ""special one"" Mourinho. ""I have huge respect for his career and you can't forget the Bayern-Chelsea game, but we have two more games before us and the next match is always the most important one. ""Bayern have never won it (the Super Cup) and it's an important title. ""I don't know what will happen next Friday, but they will win it sooner or later."" The Prague showdown rekindles memories of past El Clasico clashes with ex-Barcelona boss Guardiola against Chelsea's former Real Madrid coach Mourinho, but before that Bayern face Bundesliga matches at home to Nuremberg on Saturday, then away to Freiburg on Tuesday. Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has described the next seven days as ""the first hot phase"" of the Bavarians' season and the triple-bill of matches will test Guardiola's new 4-1-4-1 formation. Bayern host Nuremberg at Munich's Allianz Arena without Spain's Javi Martinez, who is lacking match fitness according to the Bayern boss, while France winger Franck Ribery is back in the team after an ankle injury kept him out of last Saturday's 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Germany star Mario Goetze is set to make his league debut for Bayern following his transfer from Borussia Dortmund having last played in April after a hamstring injury. The 21-year-old attacking midfielder was on the bench for last Saturday's win at Frankfurt, but has yet to play a Bundesliga match for Munich. ""The important thing is that he feels fit,"" said Guardiola. ""His legs are fit and his head is right, which is good for us. ""I don't know if he'll start or play a few minutes and I'll decide that in the morning."" Only goal difference behind Dortmund is keeping joint second-placed Bayern off the top of the German league table after winning both of their opening league matches. Although Nuremberg have drawn both of their opening games, Guardiola was full of respect for the Bavarian derby. ""A derby is very special and they are always tough games, Nuremberg will be 100 percent focussed, so it will be difficult,"" said Guardiola, while Nuremberg coach Michael Wiesinger has said his team will not heading to Munich ""to go sightseeing""."

Defending champions Bayern Munich, Champions League side Bayer Leverkusen, who host Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday, and Mainz 05, who are home to VfL Wolfsburg the same day, are the other three Bundesliga times with 100 percent records. Bremen have won both their matches under new coach Robin Dutt by with 1-0 victories away against promoted Eintracht Braunschweig and home to Augbsurg respectively having flirted with relegation last season. Bremen last lifted some silverware when they won the German Cup in 2009, but Klopp said their is too much talent in the Bremen team to take them lightly at Dortmund's Westfalenstadion. ""There is a lot of attacking potential slumbering in this Bremen squad, so we have to be very careful,"" said Klopp with Bremen expected to give Argentinian striker Franco di Santo his debut after signing from Wigan Athletic a week ago. Champions League finalists Dortmund have had just four days to prepare for Bremen's visit since their 2-1 home win over promoted Braunschweig last Sunday. Borussia needed 75 minutes before rising star Jonas Hofmann broke the deadlock with a super strike before Germany's Marco Reus netted a penalty to claim the three points. Klopp expects Bremen to have a similar game plan to Braunchweig to defend hard and hit Dortmund on the break whenever possible. ""Bremen have showed they are very patient, it might be that Bremen will have similar match plan as Braunschweig,"" said the 46-year-old. Dortmund's Australian reserve goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak could be set to play with Roman Weidenfeller suffering from gastroenteritis, while Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan sits out again with a back injury he aggravated on international duty last week. Defending champions Bayern host Nuremberg on Saturday with Germany midfield star Mario Goetze set to make his league debut since joining from Borussia Dortmund for 37 million euros (US$49.5m). ""Obviously it's going to take a little longer before I recover my rhythm and really get back to 100 percent,"" said the 21-year-old Goetze who has not played since tearing his hamstring in April's Champions League semi-final at Real Madrid for Dortmund. France winger Franck Ribery is out with an ankle injury he suffered in last Saturday's 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt. Javi Martinez, who has yet to lose a league game for Bayern, is in contention for selection again having been left out of the match day squad at Frankfurt after a long flight back from Ecuador after playing for Spain. Hamburg travel to Hertha Berlin on Saturday looking for an improved performance after they were hammered 5-1 at home to Hoffenheim last Saturday. Coach Thorsten Fink was so furious with his team that he gave them two days off, but both midfielder Tomas Rincon and defender Dennis Aogo have been thrown out of the squad for using the time to fly to Mallorca. ""The two days off had been meant to think about what they could do better in future, not to go partying. They couldn't have made a worse decision,"" said Hamburg CEO Carl Jarchow, with the north German team having leaked eight goals in just two games.

Hofmann replaced Dortmund's other key signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, then took a crisp return pass from defender Mats Hummels to drill his shot in off the far post on 75 minutes. Hofmann was then fouled in the area five minutes from time allowing Reus to drill home the penalty for Dortmund's second before Braunschweig pulled one back when Kevin Kratz's 89th-minute corner deflected in off Borussia's Poland striker Robert Lewandowski. It was not the way Lewandowski, Dortmund's top-scorer last season with 24 goals in 31 league games, would have wanted to celebrate his 100th top-flight match, while coach Jurgen Klopp enjoyed his 100th German league win with Borussia. ""Braunschweig stuck to their defensive plan, but in the second-half we had lots of chances,"" said Klopp, as Dortmund enjoyed 66 percent possession and 17 shots on goal compared to Eintracht's four. ""Jonas Hofmann turned the game for us in the right direction, so all-in-all, I'm pleased."" After Aubameyang hit a hat-trick on his German league debut in last weekend's 4-0 rout of Augsburg, the three points leave Dortmund top of the table on goal difference with European champions Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen in joint second. Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake crashed in an 89th-minute free-kick to rescue a point in Nuremberg's 2-2 draw with Hertha Berlin. Nuremberg had taken a 40th-minute lead when striker Daniel Ginczek held off two defenders to set up Swiss striker Josip Drmic to blast his shot home. Berlin drew level when Tunisia striker Sami Allagui's shot bounced in off the chest of Nuremberg centre-back Berkay Dabanli on 61 minutes. Brazilian midfielder Ronny then netted a 79th-minute penalty for Hertha before Kiyotake's late leveller shared the points. On Saturday, defending champions Bayern laboured to a 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt while both Hamburg and Schalke 04 suffered heavy defeats which left Leverkusen in second after their 1-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic gave Bayern the three points at Frankfurt when he volleyed home a cross from Germany's Thomas Mueller on 13 minutes. It was a rare highlight in a below-par performance as Bayern failed to dominate, despite enjoying 70 percent possession, while Frankfurt captain Alex Meier had a goal ruled offside and a penalty appeal turned down in the dying stages. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, taking charge of only his second Bundesliga match, started with Dutch winger Arjen Robben, Germany star Mario Goetze and new-signing Thiago Alcantara all on the bench. Spain's Javi Martinez was left out of the squad after playing the full 90 minutes of Spain's 2-0 friendly win in Ecuador on Wednesday. Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo, who signed for Wolfsburg last week from Bayern after rejecting offers from Arsenal and Barcelona, made his debut in their 4-0 rout at home over Schalke 04. There was more bad news for Schalke on Sunday as Holland striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar was ruled out for the next four weeks after tearing medial ligaments in his right knee. Schalke will be without Huntelaar for their Champions League play-off, first-leg, at home to Greece's PAOK on Wednesday. Hamburg were humiliated 5-1 at home by Hoffenheim as Brazilian striker Roberto Firmino ran riot, scoring twice and setting up the other three. Mainz enjoyed a 2-1 win at Freiburg while Bremen picked up another win with a 1-0 victory at home over Bavaria's Augsburg.

It was not the way Lewandowski, Dortmund's top-scorer last season with 24 goals in 31 league games, would have wanted to celebrate his 100th top flight match, while coach Jurgen Klopp enjoyed his 100th German league win with Borussia. After Aubameyang hit a hat-trick on his German league debut in last weekend's 4-0 rout of Augsburg, the three points leave Dortmund top of the table on goal difference with European champions Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen in joint second. Earlier, Japan midfielder Hiroshi Kiyotake crashed in an 89th-minute free-kick to rescue a point in Nuremberg's 2-2 draw with Hertha Berlin. Hosts Nuremberg had taken a 40th-minute lead when striker Daniel Ginczek held off two defenders to set up Swiss striker Josip Drmic to blast his shot home. Berlin drew level when Tunisia striker Sami Allagui's shot bounced in off the chest of Nuremberg centre-back Berkay Dabanli on 61 minutes. Brazilian midfielder Ronny then netted a 79th-minute penalty for Hertha before Kiyotake's late leveller shared the points. On Saturday, defending champions Bayern laboured to a 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt while both Hamburg and Schalke 04 suffered heavy defeats which left Leverkusen in second after their 1-0 win at VfB Stuttgart. Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic gave Bayern the three points at Frankfurt when he volleyed home a cross from Germany's Thomas Mueller on 13 minutes. It was a rare highlight in a below-par performance as Bayern failed to dominate, despite enjoying 70 percent possession, while Frankfurt captain Alex Meier had a goal ruled offside and a penalty appeal turned down in the dying stages. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, taking charge of only his second Bundesliga match, started with Dutch winger Arjen Robben, Germany star Mario Goetze and new-signing Thiago Alcantara all on the bench. Spain's Javi Martinez was left out of the squad after playing the full 90 minutes of Spain's 2-0 friendly win in Ecuador on Wednesday. Brazil midfielder Luiz Gustavo, who signed for Wolfsburg last week from Bayern after rejecting offers from Arsenal and Barcelona, made his debut in their 4-0 rout at home over Schalke 04. There was more bad news for Schalke on Sunday as Holland striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar was ruled out for the next four weeks after tearing medial ligaments in his right knee. Schalke will be without Huntelaar for their Champions League play-off, first-leg, at home to Greece's PAOK on Wednesday. Hamburg were humiliated 5-1 at home by Hoffenheim as Brazilian striker Roberto Firmino ran riot, scoring twice and setting up the other three. Mainz enjoyed a 2-1 win at Freiburg while Bremen picked up another win with a 1-0 victory at home over Bavaria's Augsburg. Borussia Moenchengladbach bounced back from their opening day defeat at Bayern with a 3-0 win at home against Hanover 96."

244,18/08/2013,02:15,Football: Bayern's Guardiola happy despite off-key win,Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola blamed last week's international friendlies for the European champions' below-par performance in Saturday's laboured 1-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt.,"A superb volley from Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic was the highlight of an otherwise off-key performance as Bayern failed to dominate Frankfurt despite enjoying 70 percent possession. Guardiola pointed to the fact that he had 15 of his 26-man squad away on international duty last Wednesday with their respective nations, allowing him only limited time to prepare for the trip to Eintracht. The ex-Barcelona boss also said he was pleased to see the defending champions control the game better than they had done in their 3-1 home win over Borussia Moenchengladbach on the opening weekend of the season. ""We had much more control over the game compared to last week,"" said Guardiola, with his side level at the top of the table with Bayer Leverkusen after the first two matches. ""We allowed Gladbach far too many chances on the break, but it was much better today. ""It's never easy after an international break, because we only had three days together. ""We still created plenty of chances, so I'm happy and 100 percent satisfied."" Guardiola made just one change to the team which beat Gladbach with Swiss winger Xherdan Shaqiri in for Arjen Robben, while new-signing Mario Goetze was included in the match day squad for the first time, but spent the game on the bench. The result means Bayern have the maximum return of six points from their opening matches as they equalled the club record of 27 Bundesliga matches without defeat. But Eintracht captain Alexander Meier had a penalty appeal turned down in the 90th minute and Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer admitted the Bavarians rode their luck. Maier had also had a goal ruled offside early in the second half, which left Neuer admitting he had been ""hoping"" to hear the whistle at Frankfurt's 51,500 capacity crowd at the Commerzbank Arena. ""It was tight at the end, but we have only ourselves to blame,"" said the Germany goalkeeper. ""That second goal was missing from our game."""

Having cost Bayern 37 million euros (US$49.2m), Goetze is another top name coach Pep Guardiola needs to accomodate in his star-studded midfield. Goetze is an option alongside Spain Under-21 captain Thiago Alcantara in an attacking midfield role, flanked by France winger Franck Ribery and Germany's Thomas Mueller, leaving Dutchman Robben on the bench. The 29-year-old, who scored Bayern's winning goal in May's Champions League final against Dortmund, only returned to the starting line-up last season after injury to Toni Kroos, but the he said competition for places is a healthy thing in the Bayern ranks. ""It was our strength last season that we never lost our quality, even when players dropped out with injury,"" Robben told German daily Bild.

While Bayern kicked off the season with a 3-1 win over Borussia Moenchengladbach last Friday, Eintracht were hammered 6-1 at promoted Hertha Berlin. And they could be forgiven for feeling a sense of trepidation ahead of this weekend's game, given that Bayern have not lost in any of their last 19 away matches in the Bundesliga. Bayern's Spain star Javi Martinez will also be looking to maintain his remarkable Bundesliga record of having yet to lose a German league match after 25 wins and three draws. Champions League finalists Dortmund host promoted Eintracht Braunschweig on Sunday with Germany midfielder Ilkay Gundogan out for two weeks with a back injury he aggravated playing for his country in Wednesday's 3-3 draw with Paraguay. Dortmund got off to a flying start last weekend when Gabon forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a hat-trick on his Bundesliga debut in the 4-0 win at Augsburg. And Poland striker Robert Lewandowski is set to make his 100th league appearance having scored 55 goals in Germany's top flight. Having won promotion, Braunschweig went down to a late goal at Werder Bremen last weekend. Their coach Torsten Lieberknecht and Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp were teammates at Mainz between 1995 and 2001, while Lieberknecht's last five games for Mainz came with Klopp as coach.

Having spent last season in Germany's second tier, the club from the capital's result left them as the surprise league leaders after the first week.

South Korea's Son also netted on his first competitive appearance for Champions League hopefuls Bayer Leverkusen in their 3-1 win at home to Freiburg.
