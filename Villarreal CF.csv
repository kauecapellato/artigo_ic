0,27/01/2021,00:06,"Real Betis, Villarreal qualify for Copa del Rey quarter-finals","Borja Iglesias scored twice in extra time to send Real Betis through to the last eight of the Copa del Rey on Tuesday following a 3-1 win over Real Sociedad, joining Villarreal and Levante in the quarter-finals.","Real Sociedad took the lead in the first half courtesy of Mikel Oyarzabal but were reduced to 10 men just after the interval following the dismissal of Asier Illarramendi. Antonio Sanabria was then sent off for Betis shortly before Sergio Canales equalised, with Iglesias striking in both halves of extra time to eliminate Sociedad. La Real will play Basque rivals Athletic Bilbao in the final of the 2019-20 competition on April 4, after it was postponed last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Villarreal edged past second-tier Girona 1-0 while Levante won 4-2 at Valladolid earlier on Tuesday. Lionel Messi will be available again after serving a two-match ban as Barcelona head to the capital to take on Rayo Vallecano on Wednesday. Athletic face Alcoyano, the third-division club that dumped out Real Madrid in the previous round, on Thursday."
1,08/12/2020,20:39,Qarabag unable to field team to face Villarreal in Europa League,"This week's Europa League game between Villarreal and Qarabag has been postponed because of the number of coronavirus cases in the Azerbaijani outfit, the Spanish club said on Tuesday.","""The Azerbaijani side do not have the minimum number of players available for the game, due to Covid-19 positive cases in their squad,"" Villarreal said on their website. ""UEFA will be in contact with both clubs, and will evaluate the current situation and will reveal a resolution in the coming days,"" they added. UEFA confirmed Thursday's game was off. The game in Spain in the sixth and final round of the group phase is completely irrelevant. Villarreal have won the group and Qarabag, with one point, are doomed to finish last. Villarreal, who visit Real Betis in La Liga on Sunday, are third in the table but have drawn their last three league games to fall five points behind leaders Atletico Madrid who have two games in hand."
2,21/11/2020,19:11,Depleted Real Madrid pinned back by Villarreal,"A patched-up Real Madrid had to hang on for a 1-1 draw at in-form Villarreal on Saturday, handing Barcelona and Atletico Madrid the chance to capitalise in La Liga.","Barca and Atletico face each other at the Wanda Metropolitano later on Saturday, when victory for either side would now prove even more valuable after another stumble from the reigning champions. Mariano Diaz gave Real Madrid the lead after just 105 seconds but Zinedine Zidane's team faded at La Ceramica and Villarreal claimed a deserved point through Gerard Moreno's second-half penalty. ""It feels like a small reward,"" said Zidane. ""We deserved more today for the game we played. I'm annoyed because of the effort from the boys."" Mariano was almost sold last summer but had to stand in for Karim Benzema, who is injured, and Luka Jovic, who tested positive for coronavirus on Friday. Sergio Ramos, Eder Militao and Casemiro were all missing following the international break, leaving Nacho Fernandez and an unfit Raphael Varane to fill in at the back, while Martin Odegaard made a rare start in midfield. Given the absentees, a draw may not worry Zidane too much, particularly against a buoyant Villarreal side who sat second at kick-off after four victories on the bounce. But another slip means Madrid have now won only three of their last seven games in all competitions, with a crucial visit to Inter Milan to come in the Champions League on Wednesday. If Atletico Madrid beat Barcelona they will move three points clear of their city rivals, with a game in hand, and nine ahead of Barca. Mariano had not started for Real Madrid since May 2019, when he again scored early against Villarreal after just 83 seconds. He was not far behind this time, heading in Dani Carvajal's cross after Villarreal's defence had stopped for an offside on Lucas Vazquez that never materialised. Villarreal increasingly took charge of the game, their slick passing giving a sense of control but few chances, the best of them in the first half falling to Dani Parejo, who nodded over. But Madrid appeared to tire as the match wore on and Villarreal's pressure turned more threatening in the last 20 minutes, with Moreno flashing wide from the angle and then Parejo missing the target from a cutback. The equaliser was late but deserved, as Thibaut Courtois flew out to meet a through ball for Moreno but arrived second and fouled the striker with his hands. Courtois dived the right way but Moreno's shot was well-placed into the corner."
3,20/11/2020,03:10,"Huge tests for Real, Barca, a milestone for Flick - what to watch in Europe this weekend","Real Madrid and Barcelona's stuttering starts to the season could continue, while AC Milan's unbeaten record in Serie A is in danger and Bayern Munich coach Hansi Flick is aiming to continue his astonishing record.","AFP Sport previews the standout football action on the continent this weekend: Monaco v Paris Saint-Germain, Friday 2000 GMT PSG are five points clear at the top of Ligue 1 and chasing a ninth straight win when they face Monaco, the only other club to have won the title in the past eight seasons. Paris have won 4-1 and 4-0 on their last two visits to the principality but they might find things harder this time, not least because coach Thomas Tuchel is without a host of injured players, while Neymar is a doubt. The game has a German accent to it, with Monaco looking to return to the upper echelons of the French game under new Croatian coach Niko Kovac, who was born and raised in Germany. Ex-Borussia Dortmund boss Tuchel has been full of praise ahead of the game for Kovac, who he came up against when the latter was at Eintracht Frankfurt. Kovac is looking to relaunch his career after being sacked by Bayern Munich. Bayern Munich v Werder Bremen, Saturday 1430 GMT Kovac was replaced in the dugout in Bavaria by Hansi Flick, who went on to win the Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup treble last season and has added the UEFA and German Super Cups this season. On Saturday Flick takes charge of Bayern for the 50th time when they host Werder Bremen. Flick's record is astonishing. He has overseen 45 wins, one draw and just three defeats, with Bayern averaging 3.3 goals a game in the Bundesliga. Bayern sealed the title with a 1-0 win in Bremen in June. Werder only just stayed up last season and lost 6-1 on their last trip to Munich. A similar outcome is quite possible this time. Villarreal v Real Madrid, Saturday 1515 GMT Zinedine Zidane's Real have had two weeks to stew on a 4-1 hammering at Valencia and could find the going tough again this weekend when they make another trip to Spain's east coast to play Villarreal. Unai Emery's side are undefeated in six La Liga games and are second in the table, two points behind leaders Real Sociedad and two above Real, who have a game in hand. While Madrid are without talisman Sergio Ramos after he suffered a hamstring injury playing for Spain, Villarreal have two of Spain's most in-form strikers in Paco Alcacer and Gerard Moreno. The latter has four league goals this season and scored a late equaliser for Spain against Switzerland in the Nations League last weekend, while Alcacer has nine in total. They could make life very difficult for the champions. Atletico Madrid v Barcelona, Saturday 2000 GMT Barcelona claimed a first win in five La Liga games last time out when they thumped Real Betis 5-2, but they are currently eighth in the table, nine points behind Real Sociedad with two matches in hand. On Saturday they visit Atletico, who are six points above Ronald Koeman's side and on a club-record unbeaten run of 23 league matches. Luis Suarez's absence against his former side after a positive coronavirus test is a great shame, as will be the lack of fans, but this match still pits Lionel Messi against Joao Felix, and there is the return of Antoine Griezmann to face his old team. Napoli v AC Milan, Sunday 1945 GMT Milan's revival is real, as they spent the international break on top of Serie A, unbeaten and two points ahead of Sassuolo in second. A huge test awaits, however, as they go to Napoli, who are three points off the lead in third. Napoli have lost their last two home games but look like contenders for a top-four finish this season and the prospect of coach Gennaro Gattuso getting one over the club he served with such distinction as a player is a fascinating one."
4,02/11/2020,23:05,Villarreal up to third after win over Valladolid,Villarreal climbed to third place in La Liga on Monday with a 2-0 victory at home to rock-bottom Real Valladolid that left Unai Emery's side two points off top spot.,Nigeria winger Samuel Chukwueze bagged his first goal of the season with a classy left-foot finish on 21 minutes and Pau Torres added a second before half-time. Villarreal are unbeaten in seven games in all competitions since a 4-0 defeat by Barcelona on September 27. Real Sociedad occupy first place in Spain with Real Madrid a point back in second. Atletico Madrid are another two points behind but have two games in hand on the leaders.
5,18/10/2020,20:59,Parejo sinks former club Valencia as Villarreal go top,"Dani Parejo came back to haunt Valencia on Sunday by scoring the winner in a 2-1 victory for Villarreal, who moved to the top of La Liga.","After making 363 appearances for Valencia, many of them as captain, Parejo was one of a handful of key players allowed to leave the club in the summer. His deflected shot in the 69th minute was a reminder of what they were missing as Villarreal held on to go one point above Real Madrid. Despite a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Barcelona last month, it has been an encouraging start for Unai Emery, who was appointed coach of Villarreal in July. They have 11 points from their first six games and lead the table after capitalising on inconsistent starts for La Liga's title favourites. Madrid and Barca lost to Cadiz and Getafe respectively on Saturday. Valencia sit 12th, having won just once in their last five matches, with the future of coach Javi Gracia still uncertain. Gracia was critical of the club after Valencia sold the likes of Parejo and Francis Coquelin to Villarreal, as well as Rodrigo and Ferran Torres to Leeds and Manchester City but failed to make a single addition in the summer transfer window. Emery was also once at Valencia and so was Villarreal's Paco Alcacer, who opened the scoring with a penalty before Goncalo Guedes levelled shortly before half-time. Yet Parejo had the last word, receiving a pass from Takefusa Kubo and curling in after his shot deflected off Mouctar Diakhaby. Villarreal had to play the last few minutes with 10 men, with Kubo sent off in the 90th minute after coming on in the 64th."
6,25/09/2020,03:23,Koeman's revolution needs instant results as Barca start against Villarreal,"Barcelona have kept Lionel Messi, discarded Luis Suarez and hired Ronald Koeman but the new era begins against Villarreal on Sunday when change must bring results.","A shortened break has not made it any easier for Barca, who are attempting in a matter of weeks the kind of renovation most elite clubs would give themselves years to carry out. Forty-four days will have passed since they were humiliated by Bayern Munich in the Champions League, the match that was followed by their coach being sacked and greatest ever player trying to leave. Messi was forced to stay and the early indications are he will make good on his promise to give his all this season, as Barcelona look to wrestle back the title lost to Real Madrid in July. On his first day back, Messi arrived more than an hour early and in his first week, he trained on the team's days off in what looked like an effort to make up for lost time. He has played in all three friendlies and scored twice in the second, when a hand clasp with Koeman was poured over by the Spanish press and was generally taken as a positive step. ""He is excited about Koeman's project,"" Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu told TV3 last week. ""The important thing is he plays for Barca, at his home. We want him to retire at the club."" But it is hard to imagine Messi's thinking has dramatically changed since he angrily admitted defeat in his pursuit of a clause in his contract he thought allowed him to depart for free. He has watched on as Suarez, his best friend, neighbour and third highest goalscorer in the club's history, found out through the media his time was up, able eventually to join title rivals Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Arturo Vidal, another close friend of Messi's, has also been let go, sent to Inter Milan for next to nothing. And Bartomeu, whom Messi has blamed for the decline in recent years, remains, insistent he has no intention of resigning. As well as Suarez and Vidal, Ivan Rakitic and Nelson Semedo have gone while only youngsters - Trincao, Pedri and Matheus Fernandes - have come in, as well as the 30-year-old Miralem Pjanic, whose swap with Arthur Melo was confirmed in June. Instead, renewal is likely to come not from a change of personnel but the system and pecking order. Koeman looks ready to deploy a 4-2-3-1 with the two holding midfielders picked from Pjanic, Frenkie de Jong and Sergio Busquets, with Busquets perhaps set to be most regularly left out. Up front Antoine Griezmann will take over from Suarez as partner-in-chief to Messi, potentially with Messi as the central striker and Griezmann just behind. Ansu Fati, Ousmane Dembele, Trincao and Philippe Coutinho are expected to be the main contenders for the attacking spots out wide. The 19-year-old American international Konrad de la Fuente has also impressed. There will be little change in defence, where Semedo's exit has left the club searching for a new right-back but Jordi Alba, Clement Lenglet and Gerard Pique will continue ahead of Marc-Andre ter Stegen. For Koeman, there may be some patience with teething problems early on but not much. If Messi had gone, there would have been more. Koeman only needs to look at his predecessor Quique Setien to know reform must be accompanied by results. Like Setien, Koeman's authority is already fragile given presidential elections in March could bring a new regime, who in turn could bring their own coach. Those elections could even happen sooner if a vote of no confience against Bartomeu is passed by the club's members next month. Change at the top would certainly encourage Messi but the Argentinian's happiness is likely to be most connected with performances on the pitch. Barcelona, and Koeman, need a good start."
7,21/09/2020,15:00,"African players in Europe: Mane, Zaha two-goal stars",Senegalese Sadio Mane and Ivorian international Wilfried Zaha were two-goal stars for Liverpool and Crystal Palace respectively in the English Premier League at the weekend.,"Mane punished 10-man Chelsea by scoring twice within four minutes soon after half-time to give defending champions Liverpool a 2-0 victory at Stamford Bridge. Zaha converted a penalty and scored again to assure Palace of a shock 3-1 triumph at Old Trafford over Manchester United, his former club. SADIO MANE (Liverpool) The Senegal forward tormented Chelsea as he triggered Andreas Christensen's red card and then scored twice in the champions' win. With a tight clash goalless heading into first half stoppage-time, Mane raced onto Jordan Henderson's pass and was pulled down by Christensen, who was initially booked before the decision was changed to a red card. Mane made sure Liverpool took advantage of their numerical superiority with a 50th-minute header from Roberto Firmino's cross. He followed his first goal of the season with his second four minutes later, this one a gift as he seized a wayward pass from Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and slotted into the empty net. WILFRIED ZAHA (Crystal Palace) The Ivory Coast forward returned to haunt Manchester United as his double fired Palace to a shock win. Zaha had a difficult spell with United between 2013 and 2015 before rejoining Palace, where he is fulfilling his vast potential. The 27-year-old showed why Palace are so keen to keep him out of the clutches of a host of admiring clubs as he calmly converted a 74th-minute penalty and then killed off United with a fine finish five minutes from full-time. SAMUEL CHUKWUEZE (Villarreal) The young Nigerian midfielder provided an assist to help Villarreal come from behind and beat Eibar 2-1 in La Liga. A fine cross from Chukwueze midway through the second half enabled Gerard Moreno to equalise. DAKONAM DJENE/ALLAN NYOM (Getafe) Togolese centre-back Djene and Cameroon midfielder Nyom played the full 90 minutes for Getafe in a 1-0 home win over Osasuna in their first outing of the season. Jaime Mata scored the only goal nine minutes into the second half. VICTOR OSIMHEN (Napoli) Nigerian international Osimhen came off the bench after an hour for his Napoli debut to trigger the two goals in a 2-0 win over Parma. Three minutes after his introduction, the 21-year-old was involved in the opener from Dries Mertens, with Lorenzo Insigne adding a second a quarter of an hour later. ""Osimhen has an extra gear,"" said coach Gennaro Gattuso of the player Napoli paid Lille a club record 80 million euros ($94.6 mn) for. ""He's a serious lad who does not forget where he comes from. He lost his parents as a child... he is a young man with the head of a 40-year-old."" MEHDI BOURABIA (Sassuolo) Morocco international midfielder Bourabia came on after 62 minutes and equalised three minutes from time with his free-kick salvaging a point for hosts Sassuolo in a 1-1 draw against Cagliari. It was a rare league goal for the 29-year-old, who now has three in as many seasons with the club. CEBIO SOUKOU (Arminia Bielefeld) The Bochum-born winger, who debuted for Benin last year, gave promoted Bielefeld a shock lead at Eintracht Frankfurt in a 1-1 draw. The 27-year-old sprinted to the ball in the area and lifted his shot over Germany goalkeeper Kevin Trapp with an hour gone. SILAS WAMANGITUKA (VfB Stuttgart) The 20-year-old Democratic Republic of Congo forward netted Stuttgart's second goal, but their late fightback was not enough to avoid a 3-2 home loss to Freiburg on their return to the Bundesliga. Wamangituka fired into the bottom corner on 81 minutes. RAMY BENSEBAINI (Borussia Moenchengladbach) The Algeria defender clipped the ankle of 17-year-old United States junior international Giovanni Reyna to concede a penalty in Moenchengladbach's 3-0 loss at Borussia Dortmund. Erling Braut Haaland converted the penalty. AMADOU HAIDARA (RB Leipzig) The Mali international scored Leipzig's third goal in a 3-1 home win over Mainz, sweeping the ball home from point-blank range just three minutes after the visitors had halved a two-goal deficit. The Haidara goal was the decisive final act in a swashbuckling attacking performance from Leipzig. ANDY DELORT (Montpellier) Algeria forward Delort scored just before half-time and again on the hour mark as Montpellier trounced visiting Angers 4-1 to lie third in Ligue 1, one point behind Saint-Etienne and Rennes. IBRAHIMA NIANE (Metz) Metz ended a run of three losses since the season kicked off by winning 2-1 at home to Reims thanks to a brace from Senegalese Ibrahima Niane. He opened the scoring on 18 minutes and snatched the winner with two minutes of regular time remaining."
8,12/08/2020,14:49,Ex-Arsenal midfielder Coquelin leaves Valencia for Villareal,"Former Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin has joined Villarreal from Valencia on a four-year deal, both Spanish clubs announced on Wednesday.","Local media reported the deal for the 29-year-old, who left the Premier League side in 2018 after a decade-long spell, is worth eight million euros ($9.42 million). Villarreal will feature in next season's Europa League under the guidance of former Sevilla and Paris Saint-Germain coach Unai Emery. Coquelin was part of the Valencia team that finished ninth in La Liga after a miserable season for the club, during which supporters grew increasingly disillusioned with the ownership of Singaporean businessman Peter Lim."
9,10/08/2020,18:18,Japan's Kubo joins Villarreal on loan from Real Madrid,"Real Madrid's Japanese talent Takefusa Kubo has joined Villarreal on loan for the 2020/21 season, the clubs announced on Tuesday.","The 19-year-old winger spent last season on loan at relegated Real Mallorca and impressed, registering four goals and five assists in 35 La Liga appearances. One of Kubo's best displays came in Mallorca's 3-1 win over Villarreal in November, when he won a penalty before scoring himself with a superb, long-range shot into the corner. Joining Villarreal, who will play under Unai Emery in the Europa League next term after just missing out on the top four, will be another step up for the teenager. ""Real Madrid and Villarreal have reached an agreement over the loan of Takefusa Kubo for next season in a deal running up until 30 June 2021,"" read a statement from Real Madrid. Kubo, who has already earned seven caps for the Japanese national team, will be presented at Villarreal's La Ceramica stadium on Tuesday. Villarreal described him as a ""young midfielder who has magnificent ball control, stands out for his extraordinary ability to go past opponents and possesses excellent vision of the game."" Kubo joined Barcelona's La Masia academy aged 10 and once asked Lionel Messi for an autograph during his four years at the club. But Barca were served with a two-year transfer ban in 2015 after breaking FIFA regulations on signing youth players, and Kubo was among several youngsters forced to leave. He returned to Japan, where he joined FC Tokyo, and while Barcelona were expected to bring him back to Spain eventually, Real Madrid stole a march on their rivals by signing him on a six-year contract last year. Zinedine Zidane praised Kubo's performance when he played for Mallorca against his parent club in June. Real Madrid won the game 2-0. ""He's a very clever player, he always tries to go for goal and I'm not surprised by how well he played,"" Zidane said. Before the match, Zidane said: ""I'm glad he has been playing regularly, that is what we were looking for. He is very good and it would be better for us if he didn't play tomorrow. But it is what we were looking for in the club that he joined, that he plays regularly."" Several La Liga clubs expressed an interest in Kubo but Madrid saw Villarreal as the best option. They finished fifth in La Liga after a strong end to the season and Emery, who has replaced Javi Calleja as coach, is believed to have been especially keen on his signing. Villarreal are adding reinforcements after losing key player Santi Cazorla to Al-Sadd in Qatar, with Valencia's Dani Parejo and Francis Coquelin both linked with joining the club."
10,23/07/2020,12:57,Former Arsenal boss Emery named as new Villarreal coach,Villarreal announced on Thursday that former Arsenal and Sevilla boss Unai Emery is taking over as the La Liga club's coach from the sacked Javi Calleja.,"The 48-year-old Emery was dismissed by Arsenal last November with the Gunners on a seven-match winless streak, their worst run since 1992. He led Sevilla to three straight Europa League titles from 2014-16 before winning five major trophies with French giants Paris Saint-Germain. ""Villarreal CF has reached an agreement with Unai Emery for the Basque manager to be Yellows head coach for the next three seasons,"" Villarreal said in a statement. Villarreal parted ways with former player Calleja this week despite him taking the club to a fifth-placed finish in La Liga. Influential midfielder Santi Cazorla, who has since joined Qatari side Al-Sadd, also left the Estadio de la Ceramica. Emery reached the Europa League final last season with Arsenal, losing to London rivals Chelsea. Villarreal are set to return to Europe's second-tier competition next term."
11,20/07/2020,20:19,Coach Calleja leaves Villarreal after finishing fifth,Villarreal announced on Monday that Javi Calleja is no longer their coach despite taking the team to a fifth-placed finish in La Liga.,"""Javi Calleja is no longer Villarreal CF head coach. The Yellows would like to thank him for his hard work, dedication and professionalism during his time as Yellows first-team manager,"" the club said in a statement. Former Villarreal player Calleja, 42, took over as coach in September 2017 and in his first season took the side to fifth and qualification for the Europa League. The following December he was sacked with the outfit in the relegation zone, only to return after less than two months to save them from the drop. This season Calleja once again led Villarreal to fifth, in part thanks to a good run of results after the Spanish top-flight returned from the coronavirus suspension last month. However Spanish media report former Sevilla, Paris Saint-Germain and Arsenal coach Unai Emery will take his place. Calleja is the second major figure at the club to leave this summer, after Qatari club Al-Sadd announced on Monday that Santi Cazorla will be joining them. The Spain midfielder bid farewell to Villarreal ahead of the team's final game of the La Liga season, a 4-0 thumping of Eibar on Sunday. The 35-year-old had enjoyed a brilliant third spell at Villarreal after two years of horrendous injuries. Cazorla previously made 180 appearances over six years for Arsenal and has 81 caps for Spain. He also played for Malaga and Recreativo Huelva after first joining Villarreal as a teenager."
12,20/07/2020,14:02,Spanish star Cazorla bound for Qatar's Al-Sadd: clubs,"Spanish star Santi Cazorla will join Qatar's Al-Sadd, the club said in a statement on Monday, where he will be coached by fellow countryman Xavi Hernandez.","The midfielder bid farewell to Villarreal ahead of the team's final game of La Liga against Eibar on Sunday.

He also played for Malaga and Recreativo Huelva after first joining Villarreal as a teenager. ""We have reached an agreement with Santi Cazorla. He will reach Doha soon to complete the formalities and join the team. Welcome to Al-Sadd, Santi!"" the Qatari side wrote on its verified Twitter account. Cazorla said in a video posted by Villarreal on social media that the club had ""given me everything"". ""At 18 they took a punt on a boy from Oviedo who knew nobody,"" he said."
13,13/07/2020,21:55,Villarreal miss out on Champions League after Real Sociedad loss,Villarreal's hopes of Champions League qualification are over after a 2-1 defeat to Real Sociedad on Monday confirmed Atletico Madrid and Sevilla will finish in La Liga's top four.,"An excellent run of form since the restart had thrust fifth-placed Villarreal into Champions League contention but they were unable to close the gap and will now have to focus on securing a spot in the Europa League. Real Sociedad had been fourth when La Liga resumed last month but, in contrast, their form collapsed. This victory was only their second in nine games but at least gives them of making the top seven. Atletico and Sevilla are both nine points clear of Sevilla with two games left. They will join Barcelona and Real Madrid as Spain's four representatives in the Champions League next term. Willian Jose and Diego Llorente both headed in to put Real Sociedad in control but Santi Cazorla's consolation strike could prove important for Villarreal, as it prevents la Real owning the superior head-to-head record. Villarreal beat Real Sociedad by the same scoreline in January. Fifth place for Villarreal would mean avoiding the qualification phase of the Europa League. They sit three points clear of Getafe and Real Sociedad in sixth and seventh respectively. Getafe were unable to take advantage as they were held to a goalless draw by relegation strugglers Alaves. The stalemate earns what could prove a vital point for 17th-placed Alaves, who have a four-point cushion over Leganes and Real Mallorca with two games left. One more win will guarantee Alaves' survival."
14,02/07/2020,00:48,Moreno double keeps Villarreal on Champions League path,Gerard Moreno took his season's La Liga goal tally to 15 with a double strike as Villarreal stayed on course for the Champions League with a 2-0 win at Real Betis on Wednesday.,"Villarreal are in fifth place in the table, three points behind Sevilla who occupy the fourth and final qualifying spot for next season's Champions League. Moreno opened the scoring after just seven minutes from the penalty spot and added a fine individual goal on the half-hour mark. Moreno's 15 goals are just two back from Real Madrid's Karim Benzema with Barcelona's Lionel Messi leading the way with 22. Real Betis' hopes of a fightback were undone just before the half-time whistle when French international Nabil Fekir was red-carded. Villarreal have now won five and drawn one of their six games since La Liga resumed after a three-month coronavirus suspension. Next up is a home clash with Barcelona at the weekend. Meanwhile, veteran midfielder Raul Garcia scored twice to move Athletic Bilbao four points from the Europa League places in a 2-0 win at Valencia. Garcia, 33, took his tally for the season up to 13 with his efforts either side of the break at the Mestalla. ""We are a group of friends who try to fight with everything we have. Being in Europe is the goal,"" Garcia said. Voro took charge as Valencia coach for the first time after Albert Celades was sacked on Monday following a loss to local rivals Villarreal. The hosts drop to 10th, six points behind Getafe in the final Europa League berth. Garcia, who joined the Basque club in 2015, opened his account after 13 minutes slotting home a low Inaki Williams cross. He added a second goal two minutes into the second half with a long-range shot which fired past Valencia goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen into the top corner. Athletic host league leaders Real Madrid on Sunday after Valencia head to Granada a day earlier. Granada are also six points off the Europa League places after a 2-0 win at Alaves with goals from Antonin Cortes (25 mins) and veteran Roberto Soldado (49)."
15,24/09/2019,23:11,Messi injured but Barca seal much-needed win over Villarreal,Lionel Messi endured yet more injury frustration on Tuesday after going off at half-time against Villarreal but Barcelona gave their coach Ernesto Valverde some much-needed relief with a comfortable 2-1 victory.,"Messi received treatment in the first half for what looked like a problem with his left thigh and was then unable to continue after the interval, replaced by Ousmane Dembele. His withdrawal will be a major concern for Barca, particularly given this was Messi's first start of the season after just recovering from a niggling calf injury sustained at the start of August. Even if this latest complaint proves a separate issue, Valverde will face questions about his captain's readiness to return and whether the 32-year-old was rushed back too soon. Certainly, Barcelona would have been eager to see Messi in the line-up, having suffered a humbling 2-0 loss at newly-promoted Granada on Saturday, a result that left them with seven points from five games, their worst start to a season since 1995. They arrived at Camp Nou with doubts hovering, particularly over Valverde, but delivered a far more convincing win than the scoreline suggested, thanks to early goals from Antoine Griezmann, his third of the season, and Arthur Melo. Santi Cazorla put Villarreal in touch on the stroke of half-time but in truth the visitors barely threatened thereafter, with Barcelona impressively composed when nerves might easily have taken over. It means Valverde's side climb to fourth in the table, one point behind Real Madrid and level on points with Atletico Madrid, who both play on Wednesday. Villarreal's encouraging start stalls a little as they drop to eighth. Barcelona started well, with Griezmann heading in after just six minutes, darting to the near post to flick home Messi's floated corner. The pair shared a celebratory hug too. Seven minutes later, there was a second and another goal almost from nothing. Arthur collected the ball 30 yards out and harpooned a shot straight past Sergio Asenjo and into the top right-hand corner. Messi, who won FIFA's Men's Player of the Year award on Monday, took treatment on the sideline just after the half-hour mark and Cazorla pulled one back soon after with a swerving effort from distance. The ball straightened as it flew, which fooled goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, on his way left towards the corner. Dembele replaced Messi and the 16-year-old Ansu Fati came on for Luis Suarez with 12 minutes left. Fati twice went close but shot over and then wide. A third for Barca looked more likely than an equaliser for Villarreal."
16,28/08/2019,13:57,Isco set to miss Villareal match with thigh injury,Real Madrid midfielder Isco is set to miss this weekend's La Liga match against Villarreal after the club announced on Wednesday that he had picked up a thigh injury.,"""Isco has been diagnosed with a muscular injury in the right femoral biceps,"" said Real in a statement. The club have not given a time frame for the midfielder's return but said ""his recovery will continue to be monitored"". According to sports daily AS, recovery time for this kind of injury is between two to three weeks. That would rule him out of the Liga games against Villarreal and possibly Levante on September 14. It is another setback for Zinedine Zidane's team which already has a lengthy injury list featuring Eden Hazard, James Rodriguez, Brahim Díaz, Rodrygo and Marco Asensio."
17,14/06/2019,13:55,West Ham snap up Fornals from Villarreal,West Ham completed the signing of promising Spanish international midfielder Pablo Fornals on Friday from Villarreal for a reported fee of £24 million ($30 million).,"""Fornals, who becomes the second most-expensive signing in the club's history behind Felipe Anderson, has signed a five-year contract, with an option of a further year,"" said West Ham in a statement. The 23-year-old scored nine goals in 96 appearances for Villarreal, including a memorable late winner away to Real Madrid in January 2018, but is best known for his threat as a creator from midfield. ""He is a player we have monitored closely for some time, having seen him make excellent progress as a young midfielder in one of the best leagues in the world,"" said West Ham director of football Mario Husillos, who previously worked with Fornals at Malaga. ""I personally have followed his career since he was a youth player with me at Malaga, and I know we have signed an incredible professional and an incredible character."" Fornals joins an array of attacking talent at the London Stadium, including Anderson, Marko Arnautovic and Andriy Yarmolenko and admitted that the chance to work with a former Malaga and Villarreal manager in Manuel Pellegrini helped convince him to move to the Hammers. He told the club's website: ""Manuel was a big influence because in the end he is one of the best coaches in the world and who doesn't want to work with people like that? ""I feel very good, very happy and very grateful for the opportunity that has been provided to me."" West Ham finished 10th in the Premier League in Pellegrini's first season in charge."
18,18/05/2019,20:31,"Valencia hold on to fourth, Griezmann jeered on last Atleti appearance",Valencia held their nerve to secure La Liga's last Champions League place on Saturday as a 2-0 victory over Real Valladolid ended the hopes of Getafe and Sevilla of snatching fourth.,"Getafe had to better Valencia's result at the Estadio Jose Zorrilla as they faced Villarreal, while Sevilla needed to beat Athletic Bilbao and hope both Getafe and Valencia lost. Sevilla did their part by seeing off Bilbao 2-0 while Getafe drew 2-2 but Valencia ensured those results did not matter and reached the Champions League for a second consecutive year. ""It has been an outstanding season,"" said Valencia coach Marcelino. ""We have had a lot of problems but we stayed calm. To get back into the Champions League again is a great achievement."" Valencia sit seven points behind Real Madrid, who play Real Betis at home on Sunday, and are 15 adrift of second-placed Atletico, who drew 2-2 away at Levante, with Antoine Griezmann jeered in his final match for the club. Valencia's Champions League chances looked slim when a miserable start to the season left them 15th after 15 games, with a scrap for survival more likely than a dash for the top four. They did reach the Europa League semifinals but defeat to Arsenal two weeks ago close that route to the Champions League. Their season could have a final flourish if they beat a drained Barcelona and win the Copa del Rey on May 25. ""It's one goal achieved after a difficult season,"" said captain Dani Parejo. ""But there is still one more to do."" After 11 weeks in the top four, fifth place and the Europa League might come as a disappointment for Getafe, even for a team promoted to the top flight only two seasons ago and whose annual wage bill is less than one tenth of Real Madrid's. ""We don't feel sorry for ourselves, not at all,"" said Getafe coach Jose Bordalas. ""At the start of the season, we would definitely have signed for this."" Sevilla qualify for the Europa League too, finishing sixth after Ben Yedder and Munir El Haddadi extinguished Bilbao's own hopes of European football next season. Instead, Sevilla are joined by Espanyol, whose fans invaded the pitch when the full-time whistle blew at Cornella, where a 2-0 win over Real Sociedad means the Catalan side clinched seventh. Getafe sat fourth for 23 minutes on Saturday, after Francisco Portillo pulled an early shot into the corner, but news soon filtered through that Valencia had scored against Valladolid, Carlos Soler capitalising on a mistake by Kiko Olivas. From there, everything went Valencia's way as Rodrigo gave them a two-goal cushion, shortly after Villarreal's Vicente Iborra had nodded in an equaliser against Getafe. A brilliant header from Nemanja Maksimovic looked to have given Getafe a winning finish but Gerard Moreno's angled shot bobbled its way in after some clumsy handling by David Soria. Earlier, Griezmann was barracked by fans during his last game for Atletico and Rodrigo might have scored his final goal for the club as they came back from two goals down to draw with Levante. Griezmann was whistled at the City of Valencia Stadium by visiting fans, who were also heard chanting ""out, out, out"" before goals from Sergio Camello and Rodrigo ensured Atletico ended the season with a point. ""We had to highlight the work of the gladiators who are leaving,"" Simeone said afterwards. ""Their greatest legacy is not the titles won, it is their commitment and respect. I love them very much."" Simeone has dismissed fears of a mass exodus, despite both Diego Godin and Griezmann already announcing their departures, with the likes of Rodrigo, Juanfran and Filipe Luis all expected to follow. If this was to be their farewell outing for Atletico, it was an underwhelming finale as impressive Levante could have been out of sight before they were eventually pegged back. Simeone's side finish runners up with 76 points. They come in above Real Madrid for a second consecutive year but will end up 13 points behind Barcelona, if the Catalans win away at Eibar on Sunday."
19,17/05/2019,02:15,Valencia seek perfect end to remarkable recovery in La Liga,Valencia lost to Arsenal in the Europa League semi-finals but hold pole position for La Liga's last Champions League spot as the race for the top four reaches its climax on Saturday.,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's hat-trick ended Valencia's hopes of qualifying by lifting a trophy and their chances looked slim in the league too, when they trailed Getafe by three points ahead of the penultimate weekend. But a 3-1 win over Alaves, combined with Getafe losing away to a wounded Barcelona, means it is Valencia with their fate in their own hands, as they prepare to face Real Valladolid at Jose Zorrilla. A superior head-to-head over Getafe means they need only match the result of Jose Bordelas' side, who host a Villarreal team sitting 14th and with little left to play for. Yet Valladolid's position appears in Valencia's favour too. Victory away at Rayo Vallecano last weekend means their safety is already secured. Win, and Valencia will be guaranteed Champions League football in consecutive seasons for the first time in seven years, a feat that not too long ago seemed almost unthinkable. After five games, they were 15th and still to win. After 10, they were 14th, having won once and scored seven goals. After 15 games, they had won three but were back in 15th, ground to a halt by nine draws. When Marcelino was appointed in 2017, he was the club's 12th coach in five years and only one of them -- Nuno Espirito Santo -- had overseen enough matches to make even one full league season. Most waited for the trigger to click but Marcelino stayed and after 10 draws in 13 games, they won, coming from behind in the Copa del Rey to beat Segunda B side Ebro, who had a man sent off after 29 minutes. ""There was this click,"" said striker Kevin Gameiro in an interview with AFP this month. ""And there was also a bit of luck."" Defeats by Girona, Juventus and Real Madrid tempered hopes of a recovery but in between came three victories in a row and after, five games unbeaten, including a Champions League win over Manchester United. Eighth in the table at the start of the year, Valencia then surged through March and April, 10 wins thrusting them within sight of the top four. ""The word surrender does not exist in my vocabulary,"" said Marcelino. They stumbled again, twice, defeated last month by Atletico Madrid and Eibar, the resurgence almost evaporating in the space of four days. But their rivals wobbled too as Getafe lost their nerve and Sevilla faded, the bounce from bringing in Joaquin Caparros to replace Pablo Machin proving short-lived. Sevilla's decision to act has them lying sixth, needing to win at home to in-form Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and needing both Valencia and Getafe to lose. Valencia's decision to persevere may be about to pay off, a top-four finish the perfect boost ahead of the Copa del Rey final on May 25 against Barcelona, who will be without Luis Suarez and perhaps goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen. ""The spirit of the team has merged with the spirit of Valencia, which is always: never give up,"" said striker Rodrigo earlier this month. For Getafe, the Europa League would be a disappointment, even for a team who were promoted to the top flight only two years ago and whose annual wage bill is more than ten times less than Real Madrid, the club they hope to finish one place behind. ""Everything can still happen,"" said Bordalas. Getafe have a chance, which is perhaps more than can be said for Girona, whose players and coach Eusebio Sacristan conceded their loss at home to Levante last weekend had been decisive in the fight against relegation. ""All that's left is to say sorry,"" said an emotional Eusebio afterwards. ""I was convinced I could do it but I failed."" They are 18th, needing to make up three points and a six-goal deficit in goal difference to overtake Celta Vigo on the final day. Celta have the added advantage of hosting already-relegated Rayo Vallecano while Girona play at Alaves. Barcelona's title-winning campaign will end away at Eibar on Sunday just as Real Madrid's miserable season finishes at home to Real Betis."
20,05/05/2019,18:26,Mariano double helps Madrid hold off Villarreal,Real Madrid delivered a winning response to Zinedine Zidane's stinging criticism as Mariano Diaz scored twice in a 3-2 victory over Villarreal on Sunday.,"An angry Zidane questioned the attitude of his players after last week's 1-0 loss to Rayo Vallecano and reacted by making more changes, with Luka Modric and Gareth Bale not even included in the squad. Instead, youngsters like Jesus Vallejo, Brahim Diaz and Federico Valverde were given chances to impress, along with Mariano, who has barely been used since joining from Lyon last summer. His two goals, either side of Vallejo scoring his first for the club, were enough, despite Jaume Costa pulling a late goal back for Villarreal to set up an unexpectedly nervy finish. The result leaves third-placed Madrid six points behind Atletico Madrid in La Liga with two games left. Villarreal stay five points above 18th-placed Real Valladolid, who play at home to Athletic Bilbao later on Sunday. Madrid would need to win both of their remaining matches and Atletico lose both of theirs to prevent Diego Simeone's side finishing as the top team in the capital for the second year running. But more of a concern for Zidane will be the 15-point gap behind Barcelona, which would likely be even bigger had the already-crowned champions not rested players for the Champions League in recent weeks. Zidane warned Madrid's expectant fans on Saturday that much of his current squad will still be at the club next season but this felt like another exercise in experimentation, inside a Santiago Bernabeu that looked only a little over half full. Mariano's display begs the question whether he could have been more useful during a campaign where his team have struggled for goals. In that regard, the sight of Vinicius Junior coming off the bench here and making his first appearance in two months after recovering from injury will also have been a welcome boost. Mariano had scored inside two minutes, prodding in after Santi Cazorla had been robbed in midfield by the energetic Brahim. The advantage lasted only nine minutes as this time Casemiro was caught napping in his own half, allowing Gerard Moreno the chance to fire past Thibaut Courtois at the near post. Madrid settled as Dani Carvajal hit the post from distance before Vallejo put them back in front shortly before half-time. Marcelo weaved in from the left and his blocked shot fell at Vallejo's feet, the 22-year-old finishing from four yards. Madrid made it three early in the second half, Mariano tapping in Carvajal's cross before Vinicius came on to a warm reception with 16 minutes left. An otherwise comfortable afternoon ended frantically as Costa, on off the bench planted the ball past Courtois, and there was still time for one more Villarreal attack. Xavi Quintilla might even have snatched an unlikely draw but, free at the back post, he skewed his finish wide. Madrid held on."
21,03/04/2019,00:22,"'We showed we want to win this league', says Suarez after Barca comeback",Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez led Barcelona to a stunning comeback against Villarreal on Tuesday and may have ensured there will be no return for Atletico Madrid in La Liga's title race.,"Atletico play Barca at the Camp Nou on Saturday and were given fresh hope of a resurgence when struggling Villarreal, inspired by the brilliant Santi Cazorla, led the Catalans 4-2 going into the final minute. But Messi, who had started on the bench, drove in a free-kick in the 90th and in the 93rd, Suarez fired in a devastating half-volley to earn Barca a 4-4 draw and an unlikely point. Combined with Atletico's earlier 2-0 victory over Girona, the result means the gap at the top is reduced to eight points ahead of this weekend's top of the table meeting but Ernesto Valverde's side celebrated Suarez's goal like it was a winner. ""In the end it is only a point but there is a certain feeling after coming back from two goals down in the last minute,"" Valverde said. Cazorla, meanwhile, sank to his knees, a chance spurned for Villarreal to pull four points clear of the relegation zone, with Celta Vigo, now only two behind, still to play Huesca on Wednesday. They had come from two down, as Samuel Chukwueze and Karl Toko Ekambi cancelled out early goals from Philippe Coutinho and Malcom. Vicente Iborra and Carlos Bacca looked to have sealed an incredible win, only for Messi and Suarez to intervene. The pair have now scored 51 goals between them in the league this season, just one shy of the total managed by Real Madrid. ""The spirit we showed at the end, to refuse to give in, to come back in the last minute - we showed that we want to win this league,"" said Suarez. Rested along with Gerard Pique and Ivan Rakitic, it seemed Barcelona would not need Messi as Coutinho tapped in a pass by Malcom, who then headed in Arturo Vidal's cross for a 2-0 lead after 16 minutes. But Villarreal sprung into life, revived by Chukwueze, who pulled one back seven minutes later. A sumptuous flick by Iborra launched the counter-attack and Cazorla sent the striker clear. Chukwueze's shot struck the post but cannoned back to him and this time, he guided it into the far corner. Any control Barcelona had increasingly gave way to chaos, particularly on the break, where Villarreal broke through almost at will. Toko Ekambi's equaliser shortly after half-time looked like a fluke but perhaps he meant it. He tore down the right wing and cut inside, with Marc-Andre ter Stegen stepping out to block what he expected to be a cutback. Instead, Toko Ekambi stabbed the ball inside the goalkeeper and into the far corner. Messi warmed up and then came on in the 61st minute but it was Villarreal that pulled away. A minute later, Iborra nipped onto Manu Morlanes' pass and prodded it home before Bacca made it four with 10 minutes left. Cazorla was again the instigator, his curled pass creating the chance, as Bacca skipped round Ter Stegen and slid in for what seemed like the win. Instead, Alvaro Gonzalez was sent off for a second yellow card in the 86th minute and Messi lashed a free-kick in off the post to give Barca hope. When Suarez drove in his thundering half-volley from the edge of the box, there were four seconds of the three added minutes remaining. Cazorla dropped down as Barca's players ran to the corner. Atletico Madrid were putting the finishing touches to their victory at the Wanda Metropolitano when Barcelona kicked off but they had to wait until the 76th minute for Diego Godin's opener against Girona. They had VAR to thank too as the Argentinian's header was only allowed to stand after Antoine Griezmann had initially been ruled offside. Griezmann's lob added a second in injury-time."

""It's a pity we failed to achieve a positive result in the Europa League but now we need to prepare for the Premier League match,"" Semak said. ""We've won our last four meetings with Ufa and I hope we will continue going this way. But we should stay concentrated as Ufa may be very dangerous as they have absolutely nothing to lose."" Krasnodar, who also suffered a 2-1 Europa League defeat at the hands of another Spanish top flight side Valencia on Thursday, will try to bounce back in Monday's match with 12th-placed Orenburg. Krasnodar head coach Murad Musayev said he was happy that his team kept alive their chances to progress in Europe. ""We've committed too many mistakes in the first half allowing Valencia to score two deserved goals,"" he said. ""Luckily, after the break we managed to put our play in order and to score a goal which keeps our chances alive. ""Now we need to focus on the match with Orenburg. The win on Monday will boost our morale and will help us to stay in the title race."" Third-placed CSKA Moscow, who were unexpectedly defeated 2-0 by Arsenal Tula last time out, will have their title credentials tested again Saturday when they host former two-time champions Rubin Kazan. CSKA manager Viktor Gancharenko blamed his team's non-compliance with the plan for the defeat adding his side now need to grab all three points to stay in contention for the national title. ""We played terribly and lost our previous match deservedly,"" he told CSKA's official website. ""We have not looked so bad for a long time. ""But I hope we can improve the situation quickly. Now we need to win the upcoming match. I know it will not be easy but we must do it if we want to keep our chances for the title alive."" Fixtures (all times GMT)"

Luis Garcia replaced Javi Calleja on December 10. His only victory in any competition came three days later when Villarreal beat Spartak Moscow 2-0 at home to clinch first place in their Europa League group. Since then Villarreal have drawn four and lost two league games and been eliminated by Espanyol over two legs in the Copa del Rey, a run of eight matches without a victory. The Yellow Submarine have sunk to 19th in the 20-team Liga and are five points away from safety. They are at home to Espanyol on Sunday and face Sporting Lisbon in the last 32 of the Europa League on 14 and 21 February. ""The club would like to thank the manager for his hard work, dedication and professionalism, wishing him the best of luck throughout his sporting career,"" the website said, adding that Luis Garcia would say farewell at a press conference at the Villarreal training ground in the afternoon."

The 34-year-old Cazorla had opened the scores on four minutes with a snap shot from 18-yards out catching Thibaut Coutois cold. But Frenchman Karim Benzema and Raphael Varane both bagged flashing headers as Real swept back into the lead with Brazilian midfielder Casemiro and Ballon D'Or Luka Modric pulling the strings in midfield. Benzema latched on to an inch perfect Lucas Vasquez cross to head home unmarked from the back of the six-yard box. German midfielder Toni Kroos was at the origin of Madrid's go ahead goal as he picked out Raphael Varane at the far post and the Frenchman finished with a towering header. Modric had the ball in the net on the half-hour but the video assistant referee proved he was off side for his shot. Carzola was to have the last word when he ran from deep to produce an unmarked header of his own and level the score with the clock running down in the Estadio de la Ceramica. Sergio Ramos still had time to pick up a yellow card for elbowing a rival, sending the yellow clad home fans into howls and boos as Villarreal earned a precious point for their relegation worries."

Staging fixtures abroad has become a controversial issue in Spanish football. La Liga were keen to hold a fixture between Barcelona and Girona in January in Miami but Barca have withdrawn their support due to a lack of consensus on the idea. Ronaldo, however, has said he would be in favour if Valladolid were asked. ""I am in favour but our fans are the ones who decide,"" said Ronaldo on Thursday. ""If it's good for the fans that we go to play a match abroad, to me it would seem a very interesting project for our club and our brand."" La Liga want to develop Spanish football in the United States but their plan has encountered strong opposition, primarily from the Spanish Football Federation and the players' union, AFE. ""Everything we do is for the progress of our project and Valladolid has to be recognised nationally and internationally,"" added Ronaldo. The three-time FIFA World Player of the Year, who played for Real Madrid, Barcelona and Inter Milan, said he had looked in England as well as Spain for a potential club to buy. ""I had been looking for a team to buy for two years,"" Ronaldo said. ""I studied the Spanish and English markets and some other markets and Valladolid came as a perfect gift."" He addded: ""We have a simple challenge and that is to stay in the first division, it is our one and only goal this season."""

""We wish him the best and will keep on encouraging and motivating him to get back."" Unai Emery's Gunners were the better side for long periods at the Emirates against a team who have already had three different managers this term, but were forced to settle for a point despite Sporting being reduced to 10 men late on when former Barcelona centre-back Jeremy Mathieu was sent off. But Arsenal did secure a last-32 spot regardless, as Vorskla Poltava lost 1-0 at home to Azeri outfit Qarabag in the other Group E game. Chelsea made it four wins from four matches in Group L by edging out a spirited BATE Borisov 1-0 in Belarus. Giroud ended his 11-game goal drought this season by giving Chelsea a 53rd-minute lead, and the Premier League giants held on despite BATE striking the woodwork three times in the match.

Record five-time winners Sevilla launched their Group J campaign with a 5-1 rout of Standard Liege, as Ever Banega and Wissam Ben Yedder both netted twice for the Spaniards."
30,12/09/2018,19:54,Russian World Cup hero Cheryshev in doping probe,"Spain's anti-doping agency said Wednesday it has opened an investigation into Valencia's Russian striker Denis Cheryshev, one of the revelations of the 2018 World Cup.","The announcement comes after a Russian publication quoted the player's father, Dmitri, as saying in June 2017 that Cheryshev had received growth hormone injections when he played at Spanish side Villarreal. Dmitri Cheryshev has since said his statements have been twisted by reporters, while the player himself insists his conscience is clear. Without a medical exemption, the use of growth hormones is considered doping and is punishable with a ban of up to four years. ""An investigation has been opened to get more information regarding this case,"" a spokesman for Spain's anti-doping agency AEPSAD told AFP. ""The investigation is being carried out in cooperation with Russia's anti-doping agency and in permanent contact with the World Anti-Doping Agency which is aware of the affair and will be informed of the conclusions,"" the spokesman said, adding it was too soon to draw conclusions. Cheryshev, who scored four goals in five World Cup games for Russia as they reached the quarter finals, had denied any wrongdoing. ""On my side, everything has been honest and I think there will be no problem,"" he told Russian sports daily Sport-Express. ""I think we'd better leave this case in the hands of medics, who have done everything right,"" he told Sport Express. The 27-year-old striker joined Valencia in August on a season-long loan from Villarreal."
31,19/08/2018,00:25,"Messi, Coutinho get Barcelona off to winning start",Two goals from Lionel Messi either side of a Philippe Coutinho strike allowed Barcelona to start their defence of the Spanish title with a 3-0 win over Alaves at the Camp Nou on Saturday night.,"Wearing the captain's armband following the departure of Andres Iniesta to Japan, Messi stepped up to send a cheeky second-half free-kick under the jumping wall and into the net for the opener, and Barca's 6,000th La Liga goal. Coutinho, who had come off the bench, lashed in the second goal before Messi added gloss to the scoreline in stoppage time, with the clock having ticked past midnight in Catalonia. While they took their time to get going, it was an ideal opening result for Ernesto Valverde's side, who are hoping to once again see off the challenges of Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid in the battle for the title. While Cristiano Ronaldo has left Real for Juventus, Messi remains as the figurehead at Barcelona and he won his 33rd trophy with the club in the Spanish Super Cup victory over Sevilla last weekend. The 31-year-old will be aiming to put behind him the desperate disappointment that was Argentina's World Cup campaign, and he was unlucky not to get a hat-trick here. Messi saw a free-kick crash back off the bar late in the first half after going over the wall, so when he was handed another chance from a similar position in the 64th minute, he changed tack. This time, 22 yards out, he surprised the jumping Alaves defenders by going underneath and giving Fernando Pacheco in goal no chance. He then sent another curling effort off the post soon after. Coutinho started the match on the bench alongside summer signings Arthur, Malcom, Clement Lenglet and Arturo Vidal. However, he was sent on at the start of the second half and his goal seven minutes from the end effectively killed the game. The Brazilian had just squandered one chance after being played in by Messi when he picked up a pass from compatriot Arthur before lashing in, ensuring victory on the opening weekend for Barca for the 10th consecutive season. Messi, the top scorer in La Liga last season, then controlled a ball into the box on his chest before slotting in his second and his team's third in stoppage time. After the departures of Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane, Real play their first league game under new coach Julen Lopetegui on Sunday night when they entertain near neighbours Getafe. Last season's runners-up Atletico, fresh from beating Real 4-2 after extra time in the UEFA Super Cup in Tallinn in midweek, start at Valencia on Monday. Elsewhere on Saturday, former Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla played his first competitive game in almost two years following a nightmare time with injuries. The 77-times capped Spanish international, who is now 33, suffered a serious Achilles injury playing for Arsenal in the Champions League in October 2016. After eight operations, the little attacking midfielder suffered a serious infection in the tendon that almost led to an amputation. But he fought back and recently returned to Villarreal, seven years after his departure for Malaga. Cazorla started in Villarreal's season-opener at home to Real Sociedad, as his side took a first-half lead through Gerard Moreno. However, the visitors fought back to win 2-1 with goals from Willian Jose and Juanmi, giving the Basque club's new coach Asier Garitano the perfect start. The other winners so far on the opening weekend are Levante, who triumphed 3-0 at Betis on Friday."

Cheryshev moved to Spain as a child and came up through the Real Madrid academy before joining Villarreal on a five-year deal in 2016 after a series of loan spells. He will again link up with Valencia coach Marcelino, after playing under him at Villarreal in 2014-15. Cheryshev provides another attacking option to a club that has brought in Michy Batshuayi, who is on loan from Chelsea, and former Atletico Madrid striker Kevin Gameiro in the close season."

He is due to be unveiled on Friday at 12.30pm. Villarreal described Toko Ekambi, who began his career at little-known Paris FC, currently in the French second division, as ""one of the great sensations in European football last season"".

37,20/05/2018,02:11,Ronaldo and Bale score in Real draw as Zinedine son makes debut,Real Madrid's final Champions League rehearsal was running perfectly on Saturday until Cristiano Ronaldo was substituted and Villarreal scored twice to snatch a 2-2 draw.,"Gareth Bale and Ronaldo put Real in cruise control at the Estadio de la Ceramica but the Portugese, along with Luka Modric, was taken off shortly after the hour and Villarreal came surging back. It was two substitutes that did it, Roger Martinez unleashing a stunning strike into the top corner before Samu Castillejo struck the equaliser five minutes from time. Castillejo took advantage of some hesitation from Luca Zidane, Zinedine Zidane's 20-year-old son, who was making his debut for Real in goal. ""I am happy for his debut, it is an important day for him and his coach,"" Zidane senior said afterwards. ""For his father, we will see what he says at home."" The draw means any hopes Real had of snatching La Liga's runner-up spot off city rivals Atletico are ended but their attention will quickly turn to Liverpool and next weekend's showdown in Kiev. Villarreal jump above Real Betis into fifth. If Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp had been spying for signs of weakness he would have found few in the opening hour, when Real looked slick, clinical and set for a comfortable victory. But, defensive frailties were exposed again and perhaps this result underlines that if Ronaldo can be neutralised, this is still a team that is far from unbeatable. ""We are ready,"" Zidane said. ""We have not had any injuries today and we are ready to play our last match and our final."" Ronaldo was withdrawn after 61 minutes, the 33-year-old showing no sign of discomfort in what was his first outing since spraining his ankle against Barcelona a fortnight ago. Bale too will hope his smart turn and finish could yet earn him a starting spot against Liverpool, even if Zidane has shown propensity for ignoring the Welshman's league form in the past. After scoring twice against Celta Vigo last weekend, Bale was excellent again here and he at least heads to Ukraine knowing he could not have done much more. He has now scored 17 goals in 19 matches this year when playing more than 60 minutes. ""Gareth has never lowered his level,"" Zidane said. ""I am happy with his role, for what he does, he has not changed anything."" Liverpool will have played only one match in 20 days by next weekend and Zidane opted for rhythm over rest, picking a strong team that could be close to his line-up in seven days' time. The Frenchman, however, has tended towards caution in Europe and it would be a surprise if Bale and Isco both started ahead of Lucas Vazquez, and even Marco Asensio, next weekend. There was a debut in goal for Zidane's son Luca, who joined Real's academy when Zidane was playing for the club in 2004 and has been a regular presence in the squad this season. Luca was born in May 1998, a month before his father inspired France to win the World Cup. Bale opened the scoring in the 10th minute with a goal largely of his own making as he fooled Daniele Bonera by running over Modric's pass, before driving into the bottom corner. Ronaldo doubled the advantage before half-time, nodding home a nonchalant Marcelo cross from the outside of the Brazilian's foot as Real strolled into the interval. But Ronaldo and Modric trundled off and the game turned on a brilliant shot from Martinez, who jinked inside from the left and found the far top corner. If Luca Zidane could have done little to stop that one, he might have done better with the equaliser as he rushed out to intercept a clipped ball over the top but failed to claim. Castillejo touched it round his flailing opponent and clipped a sharp finish into the empty net. Earlier in the day, Sevilla maintained their strong end to the season with a 1-0 win over Alaves. They finish seventh, below Real Betis, who slipped to a surprise 3-2 defeat at Leganes."
38,09/05/2018,22:17,Dembele double edges Barca closer to unbeaten season,Ousmane Dembele scored twice as Barcelona thrashed Villarreal 5-1 on Wednesday and edged closer to their first ever unbeaten season in La Liga.,"Lionel Messi volleyed in a sumptuous pass from Andres Iniesta at Camp Nou to put Barca three up at half-time after Philippe Coutinho and Paulinho had scored one apiece in the first 16 minutes. The second period, however, belonged to Dembele, who capped an excellent individual display with two goals after the Frenchman's sensational run had also earlier set up Coutinho. Villarreal managed a consolation when Pablo Fornals' shot deflected in off Nicola Sansone but any fears Ernesto Valverde's side would feel the effects of Sunday's 'Clasico' proved unfounded. The league leaders moved 15 points clear of Atletico Madrid at the top while Villarreal stay sixth. Barca drew last weekend against Real Madrid, despite playing the entire second half with 10 men, and they now need only avoid defeat in matches away at Levante and home to Real Sociedad to complete the campaign as invincibles. It would be the first time a team has finished a 38-game La Liga season unbeaten and the first in any format since Real avoided defeat in a division of only 10 teams in 1932. Already crowned champions and winners of the Copa del Rey, Barca were controversially denied a guard of honour by Real but Villarreal were happy to perform the 'pasillo' as the hosts walked out before kick-off. Valverde left some key players out, with Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Luis Suarez, Jordi Alba and Ivan Rakitic all missing from the starting line-up. Messi, however, was included despite calls for the Argentinian now to be rested ahead of this summer's World Cup. It meant a start for Dembele, who took his chance to impress with the stand-out performance of the night. Dembele has endured a difficult debut season since joining for 147 million euros from Borussia Dortmund last year but Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu has said this week he is not for sale, and the 20-year-old delivered the perfect response. His run that set up Coutinho's opener in the 11th minute was arguably the moment of the match as he picked up the ball 10 yards inside Villarreal's half before driving past three defenders and unleashing a shot. Villarreal goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo palmed the ball away but only to Coutinho, who was left with a tap-in. Paulinho doubled Barca's lead five minutes later after a brilliant Iniesta pass allowed Lucas Digne to slide the ball across goal. Paulinho finished at the back post. Iniesta was at the heart of the home side's third too, this time a chipped ball playing in the darting Messi, who side-footed home on the volley. Villarreal pulled one back after half-time when Fornals' shot clipped the shoulder of Sansone to wrong-foot Jasper Cillessen. But Dembele grabbed a late brace, his first an easy finish after a brilliant run by Rakitic down the right, his second coming after he sped away from Villarreal's defence, and lifted the ball over the helpess Asenjo."
39,05/05/2018,23:42,Villarreal boost Europa League hopes with late win over Valencia,Villarreal moved to within touching distance of qualifying for the Europa League after Mario Gaspar scored a late winner to beat rivals Valencia on Saturday.,"Gaspar headed in Manuel Trigueros' free-kick in the 86th minute at Estadio de la Ceramica to secure a dramatic 1-0 win over Valencia, who have also sealed their place in next season's Champions League. Valencia's place in the top four was guaranteed even before kick-off after Real Betis had earlier lost to Athletic Bilbao. Villarreal's victory means they will be guaranteed to finish in La Liga's top seven if Getafe, in eighth, fail to beat Las Palmas on Sunday. This season, the team that finishes seventh in the table will also qualify for the Europa League, as well as fifth and sixth, after Barcelona won the Copa del Rey. Valencia had the better of the chances in the first half but Santi Mina missed a one-on-one with Sergio Asenjo and they were made to pay the price. Trigueros swung in a cross from the left and Gaspar rose highest at the front post, flicking the ball with his head into the far corner. Villarreal could still finish fifth after Athletic Bilbao beat Betis thanks to two goals in the final 15 minutes from Iker Muniain and Aritz Aduriz. Celta Vigo's chances of playing European football next seasona are all-but over after they were held to a 1-1 draw by already-relegated Deportivo La Coruna. Girona's hopes were also diminished by a 4-1 defeat at home to Eibar."
40,14/04/2018,15:30,Sevilla fight back from two down in Villarreal draw,"Sevilla overcame a red card, missed penalty and 2-0 deficit against Villarreal on Saturday to seal a valuable point in the race for Europa League qualification.","Wissam Ben Yedder was booked twice, each time for dissent, eight minutes after coming on as a second-haf substitute, with Sevilla already trailing to Dani Raba's strike nine minutes before the interval. When Carlos Bacca then put Villarreal two up at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, 10-man Sevilla looked dead and buried, particularly when Nolito missed a penalty with 15 minutes left. Villarreal's Jaume Costa, however, had been sent off for his protests against the spot-kick and, with both teams a man down, Sevilla added a dramatic finish to a pulsating contest. Nolito made amends for his earlier error by converting from close range and, in the 82nd minute, Steven Nzonzi grabbed a brilliant equaliser, his stunning long-range shot bending inside the bottom corner for 2-2. The draw means Sevilla stay a point behind sixth-placed Villarreal in La Liga and five adrift of Real Betis in fifth. Despite his late strike, however, Nzonzi told beIN Sports: ""We had to win, we didn't win so we are not happy. ""We have good feelings, we didn't play badly, but the feelings don't matter if we don't win. ""There are still many games left, and we will continue to try to finish in the top five or six places."""
41,03/03/2018,18:38,Sevilla close gap on top four with victory over Bilbao,Sevilla kept alive their hopes of a top-four finish in La Liga by easing to a 2-0 victory over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday.,"Two goals in five first-half minutes from Luis Muriel and Franco Vazquez were enough for Sevilla, who play Manchester United later this month in the second leg of the Champions League last 16. They head to Old Trafford after being held to a goalless draw in the first leg. Vincenzo Montella's side face a fight, however, to qualify for the competition again next season, their victory over Bilbao closing the gap behind fourth-placed Valencia to five points. Valencia host Real Betis on Sunday. Elsewhere, Villarreal's ambitions of securing European football next season also took a knock as they were beaten 2-0 at home to Girona.

The 28-year-old then kept out a Jorge Molina penalty on 51 minutes to allow Villarreal to provisionally climb above Sevilla into fifth after halting a run of three league matches without a win. Vincenzo Montella's Sevilla, held to a 0-0 draw at home to Manchester United midweek in the Champions League last 16, host second-placed Atletico Madrid later on Sunday. Valencia, in fourth, could close to within two points of defending champions Real Madrid with a home victory over Real Sociedad. Luis Suarez hit a hat-trick on Saturday as leaders Barcelona thrashed neighbours Girona 6-1 to open up a 10-point lead at the top, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice for Real in a 4-0 defeat of Alaves."

Villarreal later issued a statement saying they had opened disciplinary proceedings against the player to investigate what had happened. Semedo, who was remanded in custody when he appeared in court on Thursday, is also accused of assault and battery, threats, illegal possession of weapons and theft with violence, said a justice spokesman. His court appearance came just hours before his team played a Europa League game at home to Lyon which they lost. Las Provincias reported that the alleged victim was locked in a bedroom while the men took the key to his apartment in order to ""rob money or get hold of something that could have held them responsible for another offence"".

They survived a late Betis onslaught, and after their 3-1 Champions League last 16, first-leg win against Paris Saint-Germain in midweek, this victory confirms that Zinedine Zidane's side are looking better in La Liga now too. They remain fourth, a huge 17 points behind leaders Barcelona. However, this was their fourth win in five league outings, and they are back to within a point of third-placed Valencia with a game in hand to come at Leganes in midweek. Asensio had come off the bench to set up the two late goals that allowed Real to beat PSG and he was rewarded with a start on Sunday in Seville, while Gareth Bale also came in as the likes of Benzema and Luka Modric dropped to the bench. Asensio duly headed Madrid into an 11th-minute lead after Antonio Adan had saved a Ronaldo shot, but Betis had won when the sides last met at the Santiago Bernabeu and they hit back brilliantly. Loren and Joaquin, the latter from a free-kick, both came close before Aissa Mandi headed in a Joaquin cross to make it 1-1 in the 33rd minute. It was 2-1 shortly after, as visiting defender Nacho could only help a Junior shot into his own net, and the home fans in the crowd of over 53,000 erupted. Real also saw Marcelo limp off in the first half -- a potentially worrying sign ahead of the PSG second leg -- but they recovered superbly after the restart. Ramos, whose Sevilla past always ensures a hot reception from the Betis fans, levelled with a bullet header from a Lucas Vazquez corner. Dani Carvajal then set up Asensio for his second and Real's third as the hour approached, and Ronaldo smashed in their fourth goal in the 65th minute. The Portuguese, supposedly in decline, has now scored 10 times in six games between league and Champions League. Betis may lack the consistency to properly contest a European place, but they do provide entertainment, and Cristian Tello set up fellow substitute Sergio Leon to make it 4-3 late on. Benzema, on from the bench, completed the scoring at the death with a goal that will boost his confidence. Earlier, Kevin Gameiro came off the bench in the second half to score one goal and make another for Diego Costa as second-placed Atletico Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao 2-0. It was another clinical performance from Diego Simeone's side, who have now recorded four consecutive league victories, all without conceding a goal. They remain second, seven points behind unbeaten leaders Barcelona, who won 2-0 at Eibar on Saturday ahead of their Champions League trip to Chelsea. ""We are not stopping, we are playing well at the moment, and we are enjoying ourselves,"" said Gameiro when asked about his team's pursuit of Barcelona. Atletico, who have conceded a paltry nine goals in 24 La Liga games this season, will hope to stay within striking distance of Barcelona before going to the Camp Nou in a fortnight. Villarreal are sixth after a 1-1 draw at Espanyol, while Real Sociedad beat Levante 3-0."

""There's no problem, it's just a question of timing,"" Bakambu told AFP in Paris on a stopover on his way back to China from a training camp in Portugal with Beijing Guoan. ""I expect the transfer to go through,"" said the 26-year-old who has fired in 32 goals in 75 appearance in La Liga. ""They didn't want to do it in the shadows hidden away in a hotel in Portugal. ""They want to do that in Beijing in front of the press and their supporters, and that's why this thing is dragging on a bit,"" he explained. AFP asked Bakambu if he had heard reports the club might want to avoid the 100 percent tax on this kind of player transfer. ""I've seen stories like this but that's not my business, the money is not mine and it won't be going in my pocket,"" said Bakambu, who will be paid around 18 million euros a year before tax."
47,13/02/2018,08:47,Chinese FA moves to plug transfer loophole after Bakambu affair,Chinese Super League teams who evade the country's 100 percent levy on foreign player transfers face crippling point deductions under new measures aimed at plugging loopholes in the restrictions.,"The Chinese Football Association (CFA) said clubs could be docked up to 15 points in the league table depending on the value of a transfer and would be prevented from registering such players until all details of transfer contracts and proofs of payment are submitted to the league. The CFA bulletin issued late Monday appeared to be a response to French-born Congolese striker Cedric Bakambu's murky move from Spain's Villarreal to Beijing Guoan, after reports suggested it was structured to dodge the transfer tax. The CFA last May slapped a 100 percent tax on incoming transfers worth over 45 million yuan ($7 million) as concern mounted over spiralling fees splashed out to woo foreign talent to Chinese teams, most of which are already believed to operate at a loss. The unprecedented move has had a chilling effect on China's once-overheated transfer market. But the Bakambu affair has emerged as a litmus test of the curbs, as reports in Spain and France said 40 million Euros had been paid to free the player from his Spanish contract. The move would reportedly bring Bakambu to Beijing on a free transfer and sparked speculation that the FA would work to seal any cracks in the system exposed by the deal. The new announcement said the tightened rules were issued after ""considering the realities that have emerged in the current process of registering player transfers,"" without elaborating. It said clubs that evade the levy on transfers of up to 45 million yuan would have one point deducted from their tally in the league table, on up to 15 points for transfers surpassing 360 million yuan ($57 million) in value. It was not immediately clear where that would leave Bakambu, whose fate has been shrouded in mystery. Bakambu and Beijing Guoan have largely kept quiet, although the club -- coached by the German Roger Schmidt -- previously told AFP that Bakambu left Villarreal ""for personal reasons"" and have pleaded ignorance about any deal. BBC Sport has previously quoted a figure close to Bakambu as saying that Guoan provided the funds to buy him from Villarreal. Compounding the confusion, Guoan released photos last month of Bakambu training with them in Portugal, but declined to confirm whether he had indeed joined the club. The CFA underlined its commitment to the 100 percent tax rule after the winter transfer window opened in China on January 1, saying it would not stand for any ""loophole-exploiting behaviour"". mh-dma/dh"

In May last year the CFA, worried about an influx of well-paid foreigners, said it would slap a 100 percent tax on incoming transfers worth over 45 million yuan ($7 million). The surcharge would supposedly go into a fund for improving grassroots football in China. The unprecedented move had its desired effect and last summer's transfer window fizzled out in China, the only major arrival to the CSL being the striker Anthony Modeste on a two-year loan deal to Tianjin Quanjian from Cologne. The arrangement allowed Tianjin to avoid shelling out twice the amount -- and now Guoan appear to be trying to do likewise, albeit by another method. Ji Zhe, director at London-based sports marketing firm Red Lantern and an expert in Chinese football, said the CFA were in a precarious position. ""There's no telling what might be happening now: there could be haggling with the CFA, they might strike a deal and sweep it under the carpet,"" said Ji. ""If so, the CFA risks other clubs also flouting the rules and could lose control."" Underlining its commitment to the 100 percent tax rule, after the winter transfer window opened in China on January 1, the CFA warned that it would not stand for any ""loophole-exploiting behaviour"". It also warned Chinese clubs to avoid engaging in ""a bidding war"", amid numerous reports that CSL champions Guangzhou Evergrande had trumped Guoan to the 72-million-euro acquisition of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Evergrande quickly denied they were in for the Borussia Dortmund striker, who now appears set for Premier League side Arsenal instead. But Guoan seem determined to snare a foreign forward. Reports in Spain and France soon emerged saying that 40 million euros had been paid -- it is unclear by whom -- to free Bakambu from his Villarreal contract, allowing him to move to the Chinese capital on a free transfer. Since then the CFA, the player and Guoan have kept largely quiet, although the club -- coached by the German Roger Schmidt -- previously told AFP that Bakambu left Villarreal ""for personal reasons"" and have pleaded ignorance about any deal. Compounding the confusion, Guoan then released photos last week of Bakambu training with them in Portugal, but declined to say more. On Friday BBC Sport quoted a figure close to Bakambu as saying that Guoan provided the funds to buy himself out of his contract at Villarreal. Bruno Leveel, who works with Bakambu on image-related contracts, said he expected the deal to go through by the end of last weekend -- but it never did. Then on Monday, adding to the sense of farce, Bakambu played for and scored for Guoan in a friendly against the Swedish side Norrkoping. Whatever happens, Ji says the saga is a lesson for all Chinese clubs. ""Chinese clubs have not yet learnt how the media -- not just in China, but globally -- could help or affect them in these deals. ""Certainly it appears there was no PR or contingency plan at all. ""The fact that Guoan allowed pictures of him training with the team and holding the shirt to be made public before any announcement is either due to total incompetence or they were trying to test the waters with the CFA."" Mark Dreyer, an expert in the murky workings of Chinese sports business, said the Bakambu case was ""the first time the (CFA) tax has really been put to the test"". Dreyer, writing on his China Sports Insider website, added: ""But rest assured that if this (Guoan's) strategy doesn't work, CSL clubs will keep trying to find workable loopholes."""
50,23/01/2018,06:56,Beijing Guoan plead ignorance in Bakambu transfer saga,Beijing Guoan are pleading ignorance over the protracted fate of Cedric Bakambu even after the striker declared he was China-bound in a reported 40-million-euro deal.,"In a statement to AFP, the Chinese club declined to confirm Bakambu's signing and said they had heard he left Spain's Villarreal for ""personal reasons"". It raises major questions over whether the drawn-out move for the French-born Congolese hitman, who has hit nine La Liga goals this season, will now go ahead. This month, the powerful Chinese Football Association warned clubs against any ""loophole-exploiting behaviour"" in trying to avoid its de facto 100 percent tax on incoming foreign transfers. Villarreal last week said Bakambu had left after he terminated his contract, and the 26-year-old declared in a video that he was going to ""play in Beijing"". It was widely reported in French and Spanish media that Bakambu was set to move to Beijing after the 40-million-euro buyout clause in his contract was triggered. But Guoan, who had previously stayed silent on the matter, told AFP: ""We recently received a fax from your office enquiring about Bakambu's buy-out clause on his contract with Villarreal. ""We were not aware of this. We learned later through multiple channels that he left the club for personal reasons."" The issue appears to be the Chinese FA's 100 percent tax rule, which was slapped on clubs last May to halt a buying frenzy including a series of record transfers. Under the rule, Chinese clubs buying foreign players must pay an amount equivalent to the transfer fee into a fund designed to bolster youth football. The CFA this month warned it was closely watching to make sure clubs do not flout the rule, after Guoan and Chinese champions Guangzhou Evergrande were reportedly locked in a bidding war for Borussia Dortmund forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Chinese media said Evergrande won the race for his signature -- but Evergrande later denied any interest in Aubameyang, and repeated a pledge to field an all-Chinese team by 2020. Beijing Guoan finished ninth in the 16-team CSL last season under German coach Roger Schmidt, and appear determined to buy a goal-scorer before the start of the new campaign in March. bur-lth-pst/dma/th <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org>"
51,13/01/2018,19:18,Madrid misery after Villarreal's first win at Bernabeu,"Struggling Real Madrid risk falling further behind in La Liga after a cheeky late chip from Pablo Fornals saw Villarreal escape with a 1-0 win on Saturday, their first ever victory at the Santiago Bernabeu.","Fornals struck with three minutes left to leave Zinedine Zidane's wasteful side fourth and a whopping 16 points behind runaway league leaders Barcelona, a deficit which will turn into 19 should Barca win at Real Sociedad on Sunday. ""We didn't deserve to lose. We had the better chances but the ball did not want to go in,"" said under-fire Zidane after Real's second straight home league defeat. Villarreal meanwhile move up to fifth on 31 points thanks to midfielder Fornals' stunning goal, which puts Javier Calleja's side just a point behind off-form Madrid. Real fired off nearly 30 shots but their accuracy was wayward, with Cristiano Ronaldo among the worst culprits in front of goal. ""We did everything we could and there is no explanation for why the ball didn't go in,"" added Zidane, who signed a new contract to keep him at Real until 2020 earlier this week. ""I can't criticise my players for anything. This is a bad spell, nothing more."" So often Real's saviour, Ronaldo had a bad day at the office, with his worst miss coming just before half-time, when the five-time Ballon d'Or winner managed to shoot straight at Sergio Asenjo after being laid on by Isco in front of a practically open goal just yards out. The Portuguese was livid with the referee, as he thought that he was tripped by Daniele Bonera just before he shot. Real carried on where they left off in the second period, but after failing to break down the resolute visitors, Fornals stepped up to make history and pile the pressure on Zidane. Fornals clipped home his 87th-minute winner just after it looked like Enes Unal had fluffed his team's chance to snatch the three points after a blistering counter-attack following a Real Madrid corner. Turk Unal shot straight at Keylor Navas when put through by Denis Cheryshev, but with Navas still recovering from making the save Fornals lifted the ball over the flailing Madrid stopper. ""You're always happy when you get three points at such a difficult ground,"" said Calleja afterwards. ""We knew we could make history today, we believed."""
52,10/12/2017,22:48,"Suarez, Messi maintain Barca's La Liga lead",Barcelona restored their lead at the top of La Liga to five points as Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi struck in the final 20 minutes to edge out 10-man Villarreal 2-0 on Sunday.,"Daniel Raba's red card on the hour mark for a wild lunge on Sergio Busquets handed Barca the initiative. And their pressure told when Suarez rounded off a fine team move before Messi blasted home a second to get the Catalans back to winning ways after successive draws with Valencia and Celta Vigo in La Liga. Valencia remain Barca's closest challengers five points back, but Atletico Madrid also maintained their title charge with a 1-0 win at Real Betis to stay six points off the top. Real Madrid are eight points back in fourth and Barca will have the chance to go into El Clasico away at Real in two weeks' time with an 11-point lead over their rivals. Barca host Deportivo la Coruna next weekend, whilst Madrid are in action at the Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi. Gerard Pique nearly gave Barca the perfect start at the Ceramic Stadium, where they have struggled in recent seasons, as his header came back off the crossbar from Messi's corner just four minutes in. However, Barca dominance of possession was largely stale before the break as Villarreal posed the greater threat on the counter-attack. Nicola Sansone had the hosts' best effort that forced Marc-Andre ter Stegen into a stunning one-handed stop high to his left. Messi orchestrated the visitors' attacking threat after the break as he constantly freed Jordi Alba down Barca's left. Paco Alcacer was denied by Sergio Asenjo from Alba's low cross before the left-back teed up Messi for a cushioned effort that drifted inches wide. Villarreal had to survive the final half hour a man light when Raba was dismissed for connecting with his studs on Busquets' ankle as the Spanish international cleared. Another Alba cross was turned onto the post by Suarez on the stretch. However, the Uruguayan finally broke Villarreal's resistance after exchanging a neat one-two with Alcacer to round Asenjo and net his seventh goal of the season. And Messi secured all three points seven minutes from time as he was played in by Busquets to smash past the helpless Asenjo. Earlier, Atletico bounced back from the disappointment of being dumped out of the Champions League in midweek to keep their title challenge afloat at Betis. The hosts dominated possession throughout but were made to pay for their lack of cutting edge, as well as some fine goalkeeping by Jan Oblak. By contrast, Atletico were clinical even in the absence of the injured Antoine Griezmann as Saul Niguez slid in at the back post to turn home Sime Vrsaljko's cross with their first serious attack on the half-hour mark. ""They played some spectacular football today, but we took advantage of the chance we had,"" Atletico midfielder Koke told BeIN Sports Spain. Betis posed more of a goal threat after the break but were denied by Oblak, who produced a wonder save to turn Cristian Tello's sweetly struck half-volley behind for a corner. ""One team had the ball, which was Betis, and they tried many different ways to damage us, but the team was very strong defensively,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. At the other end of the table, Malaga and Athletic Bilbao secured big away wins to ease their relegation fears. Malaga remain in the drop zone but moved off the foot of the table with a 2-0 victory at Real Sociedad. Athletic, meanwhile, bagged their first league win in nearly two months 2-1 at Levante to move up to 13th."
53,25/09/2017,14:30,Sacked Escriba replaced by Calleja at Villarreal,Villarreal promoted B team coach Javi Calleja to first-team boss on Monday following the sacking of Fran Escriba and his backroom staff.,"A 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Getafe on Sunday left Villarreal just three points above the relegation zone in 14th with seven points from their first six games. ""Villarreal CF and Javi Calleja have reached an agreement for him to become first team coach for the 2017/18 season,"" Villarreal said in a statement. ""The club have gambled on an in-house appointment, who until now has managed Villarreal B and developed as a coach in the youth academy of the club."" Escriba, 52, was a surprise appointment when Marcelino Garcia Toral was sacked just days before the start of the season in August last year. ""Villarreal CF have decided to rescind the contract of Fran Escriba as coach of the first team,"" the club said in an earlier statement. ""The club want to thank the coach, his assistant Josep Alcacer and fitness trainer Jose Mascaros for their work and dedication."" Escriba led the Yellow Submarine back into the Europa League by finishing fifth behind only traditional powerhouses Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Sevilla last season. But he becomes already the second La Liga coach sacked this season after Argentine Luis Zubeldia lasted just four games in charge of bottom-of-the-table Alaves."

56,08/12/2016,19:18,Villarreal clinch place in Europa League knockout phase,A brilliant late goal by Manuel Trigueros gave Villarreal a nervy 2-1 win over Steaua Bucharest on Thursday that took the Spanish club into the last 32 of the Europa League.,"Nicola Sansone gave Villarreal the lead at El Madrigal only for substitute Vlad Achim to equalise for the Romanians, who then had ex-West Bromwich Albion defender Gabriel Tamas sent off. Villarreal won the game when Trigueros netted with a superb chip from just outside the box with two minutes left, and they go through as runners-up in Group L behind the Turkish side Osmanlispor. Steaua had a chance to equalise in stoppage time, and while a 2-2 draw would have taken them through, instead they are eliminated. Fiorentina are also through as winners of Group J after a 2-1 win over Qarabag in Azerbaijan secured by a 76th-minute goal from 19-year-old Federico Chiesa, son of ex-Italy striker Enrico. Chiesa was then sent off shortly after. PAOK of Greece are also into next week's draw for the first knockout round thanks to a 2-0 win against Slovan Liberec, while Gent joined Shakhtar Donetsk in advancing from Group H. Kalifa Coulibaly's stoppage-time strike clinched a 1-0 win over Konyaspor in Turkey and took the Belgians through at the expense of Braga, who lost 4-2 at home to Shakhtar. The identities of the last six qualifiers for the knockout phase will be revealed later, with Manchester United needing a draw against Zorya Luhansk in Ukraine to advance from Group A."
57,11/08/2016,10:58,Villarreal part company with coach Marcelino,Spanish Champions League hopefuls Villarreal have been rocked ahead of the start of the new season by the departure of coach Marcelino.,"""Marcelino Garcia Toral is no longer the coach of Villarreal,"" the club announced in a statement published on their website on Wednesday evening. Marcelino, who leaves along with his assistant Ruben Uria, had been in charge since 2013 but has left following a disagreement with the club's board, according to sports daily Marca. His departure comes at a crucial time, with Villarreal set to host Monaco at El Madrigal in the first leg of the Champions League play-offs next Wednesday. Villarreal, who finished fourth in La Liga last season, have been linked with an approach to former coach Manuel Pellegrini, a free agent after his departure from Manchester City. The Yellow Submarine begin their domestic campaign away to Granada on August 20."
58,08/05/2016,16:54,Villarreal sign first Qatari in La Liga history,Teenage forward Akram Afif is set to become the first player from Qatar ever to play in La Liga and possibly the Champions League after being signed by Spanish club Villarreal.,"Afif on Sunday described his transfer as a ""dream"" after his move was confirmed by his parent club Al Sadd and the Spaniards. ""It is a dream come true for me to be the first Qatari player in La Liga,"" Afif said in an interview with the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, the body organising the Qatar 2022 World Cup. ""I am very happy to sign for Villarreal, they are a big team and one of the best teams in Spain."" He added that he would aim for the first team next season. ""Villarreal will play the Champions League next season so we'll try to be a difficult team to beat in La Liga and go as far as we can in all competitions,"" said the young history-maker. Al Sadd, the Doha club for which Barcelona great Xavi Hernandez now plays, took to social media on Saturday evening to say it had reached a deal with Villarreal. And in a statement on its website, subsequently retweeted by Afif, Villarreal also confirmed that an agreement had been reached ""in principle"". The 19-year-old, born in Doha, is no stranger to Spanish football having played for Villarreal and Sevilla's youth teams. Since 2015, Afif has been playing for KAS Eupen, a Qatari-owned team in the Belgian second division. Eupen is owned by Qatar's renowned Aspire Academy, which has spent millions trying to develop young Qatari sports stars over the past decade. Afif is a product of Aspire. His transfer to arguably the strongest European league could be seen as a major coup for Aspire. During the current season he scored six times in 16 appearances for Eupen, who subsequently have gained promotion to Belgium's top division. Eupen director Christoph Henkel said in a statement posted on the club's website that he was sorry to see Afif leave but the club ""wished him luck and success in his future career"". A fast and technically proficient player, Afif made his debut for the Qatari national side last year during the country's record 15-0 trouncing of Bhutan in an AFC World Cup qualifier. He is likely to feature in Qatar's make-or-break matches for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, with qualifiers taking place from later this year. Villarreal currently lie fourth in La Liga and have already secured qualification for next season's Champions League. They will be placed in the tournament play-off round before the main group stage. Several other young Qataris play in Europe, but it is thought that only one other Qatari has appeared in a major league. Hussein Yasser made one appearance for English club Manchester City in the 2005/6 season. Yasser was in his early 20s when he made his only appearance during a defeat on penalties to Doncaster Rovers in the League Cup."

60,05/05/2016,23:03,Sturridge sends Liverpool into Europa League final,Daniel Sturridge was involved in all three goals as Liverpool impressively beat Villarreal 3-0 at Anfield on Thursday to set up a Europa League final date with holders Sevilla.,"Trailing 1-0 from the first leg, Liverpool levelled the tie when Bruno Soriano put through his own goal under pressure from Sturridge, who scored the second goal in the 63rd minute before helping to tee up Adam Lallana for a late strike that completed a 3-1 aggregate win. It took Liverpool into their first continental final since the 2006-07 Champions League, preserving Jurgen Klopp's hopes of finishing his first season as manager with both a trophy and a place in Europe's elite competition next season. Villarreal, for whom centre-back Victor Ruiz was sent off, had been bidding to reach their first ever major final, but could console themselves with the knowledge that following Sunday's 2-0 win at Valencia in La Liga, their place in next season's Champions League play-offs is already secure. Sevilla, seeking to win the competition for the third season running, won 3-1 at home to Shakhtar Donetsk for a 5-3 aggregate success. But for all Sevilla's recent pedigree in the competition, Liverpool will approach the final with significant momentum, having previously seen off both Manchester United and Borussia Dortmund in the competition. Anfield was staging its first game since the new inquests into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster ruled that 96 Liverpool fans were unlawfully killed and a stirring pre-match rendition of 'You'll Never Walk Alone', the club anthem, helped to electrify the atmosphere. There were early scares for the hosts when Simon Mignolet had to save from Mario Gaspar and Jonathan Dos Santos curled over, but in the seventh minute they levelled the tie. Nathaniel Clyne's cross from the right was pushed away by Villarreal goalkeeper Alphonse Areola, but Roberto Firmino turned the ball back across goal and with the sliding Sturridge getting a touch just in front of him, Bruno contrived to bundle the ball into his own net. Shortly after, Lallana scuffed wide from James Milner's superb, curved pass down the inside-right channel. Villarreal survived the onslaught, but the noise and early setback appeared to have rattled them and striker Roberto Soldado, formerly of Tottenham Hotspur, was booked after a series of indiscretions. After Philippe Coutinho, the tireless Milner and Sturridge had threatened for Liverpool, and Dos Santos headed over the bar for Villarreal, Klopp's men scored their crucial second goal. Firmino miscued his attempt to larrup a left-foot volley towards goal from the edge of the box, but the ball ran to Sturridge, whose shot clipped Areola, struck the base of the right-hand post and rolled in. Having been left on the bench for Liverpool's previous three games in the competition, the England striker celebrated with abandon. Ruiz saw red after a pair of bookings and with nine minutes to play it was all over as Firmino did brilliantly to reach the left-hand byline and cut the ball back for Sturridge, whose mishit shot was alertly poked home by Lallana. In Seville, where the tie resumed at 2-2, former Arsenal striker Eduardo gave 2009 champions Shakhtar hope by cancelling out Kevin Gameiro's ninth-minute opener for the hosts. But Gameiro struck again early in the second half before a 59th-minute Mariano strike rubberstamped victory for Unai Emery's side, who will go in search of a third consecutive Europa League trophy in Basel on May 18."
61,01/05/2016,22:25,Villarreal seal Champions League return,Villarreal warmed-up for the second leg of their Europa League semi-final against Liverpool by sealing fourth place in La Liga with a 2-0 win at Valencia on Sunday.,"The Yellow Submarine are now guaranteed at least a place in the Champions League qualifiers for the first time in four years, but could gain direct entry to the group stages should they go on to win the club's first major honour in the Europa League. First-half goals from Samuel Garcia and Adrian Lopez - who also struck the stoppage time winner in the 1-0 frist leg success over Liverpool - moved Villarreal six points clear of Athletic Bilbao with two games to play. However, Marcelino's men cannot be overtaken by the Basques due to their superior head-to-head record. Athletic leapfrogged Celta Vigo into fifth as they came from behind to beat the Galicians 2-1 earlier on Sunday. Fabian Orellana opened the scoring for Celta before Aritz Aduriz equalised with his 34th goal of the season from the penalty spot. Gustavo Cabral was then sent-off for kicking Aduriz in the head and Athletic made the man advantage count when Raul Garcia struck the winner 18 minutes from time. At the bottom of the table, Getafe gave their chances of survival a huge boost with a 2-0 win at 10-man Deportivo la Coruna thanks to goals from Pedro Leon and Carlos Vigaray. Getafe are now tied with Sporting Gijon and Rayo Vallecano on 35 points, but remain in the bottom three due to their inferior head-to-head record against Rayo. Espanyol moved to the brink of mathematically securing their place in the top flight for next season as Felipe Caicedo's winner handed them a 1-0 win over Sevilla to move five points clear of the relegation zone."
62,28/04/2016,23:11,Villarreal strike late to dent Liverpool Europa hopes,Adrian Lopez's stoppage-time winner put Villarreal on the verge of reaching their first ever Cup final with a 1-0 win over Liverpool in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final on Thursday.,"A game of few chances was decided by a brilliant goal at the death as Denis Suarez unselfishly squared for substitute Lopez to tap home from close range. Roberto Firmino fired Liverpool's best chance against the post in the second-half as Jurgen Klopp's men now need another famous European comeback at Anfield to reach the final in Basel on May 18. Sevilla are well-placed to reach a third consecutive Europa League final as they drew 2-2 away at Shakhtar Donetsk in the other semi-final. The 96 Liverpool fans who died at the Hillsborough tragedy 27 years ago were remembered before kick-off days after the biggest inquest in English legal history found they had been unlawfully killed. Villarreal fans held aloft a banner reading ""96 You'll Never Walk Alone."" Once the action got underway, Liverpool had the first chance when Joe Allen's low shot from Adam Lallana's deflected cross was placed too close to Sergio Asenjo. Villarreal went onto enjoy the better of an intense first-half short on goalmouth action. Former Tottenham Hotspur striker Roberto Soldado pulled the best chance of the half wide on 10 minutes. Thomas Pina forced Simon Mignolet into a smart save low to his left before a curling effort from Soldado hit the side-netting. Liverpool suffered a blow at half-time when Coutinho was forced off to be replaced by Jordan Ibe. Villarreal were inches away from opening the scoring a minute into the second period when Cedric Bakambu's header came off the post. However, Liverpool also hit the woodwork at the other end with their best chance of the game 25 minutes from time when Firmino's low shot was brilliantly turned onto the post by Asenjo. The game suddenly opened up in the final 10 minutes as Mignolet producing a stunning save to prevent Bakambu adding to his nine Europa League goals this season. Yet, from the resulting corner Liverpool pounced on an error from Suarez and Alberto Moreno bore down on goal before firing wildly off target. Suarez atoned in fine fashion deep into stoppage time as he trapped Bruno's pass to burst through the Liverpool defence before picking out the unmarked Lopez for an easy finish. In the other semi-final Vitolo got Sevilla off to a perfect start when he fired between Andrey Pyatov's legs early on. The Ukrainians turned the game around before half-time through Marlos and Taras Stepanenko. However, Kevin Gameiro's penalty eight minutes from time gives Sevilla a huge advantage ahead of the return at the Sanchez Pizjuan in a week's time. Sevilla's joy was diminished, though, by a serious knee injury suffered by Danish midfielder Michael Krohn-Dehli."
63,24/04/2016,22:47,Villarreal edge towards Champions League return,Villarreal moved a point closer to sealing their return to the Champions League after a four-year absence as they warmed up for their Europa League semi-final against Liverpool with a 0-0 draw with Real Sociedad on Sunday.,"Captain Bruno came closest to opening the scoring for Villarreal when his free-kick rattled the crossbar midway through the first half. However, Carlos Vela also missed a great opportunity for Real early in the second half when his attempted chip was beaten away by Sergio Asenjo. Villarreal continue to lead Athletic Bilbao by six points with just three games remaining despite a dramatic fightback by the Basques to seal a point in a 2-2 draw at bottom-placed Levante. Victor Casadesus's early opener and Borja Etxeita's own goal had Levante on course for a huge win in their battle to beat the drop. However, Athletic struck twice in the final two minutes through Markel Susaeta and Mikel San Jose to leave Levante still four points off safety. Athletic, Sevilla and Celta Vigo are all at least heading for Europa League football next season after Valencia's fine run under new boss Pako Ayestaran was stalled by a 2-2 draw at Getafe. Dani Parejo's fine free-kick put Valencia in front before Alvaro Medran and Stefan Scepovic put Getafe 2-1 in front. However, the Madrid side remain rooted in the relegation zone as Paco Alcacer's equaliser six minutes from time stretched Valencia's unbeaten run to four games. Sevilla picked up their first league win in six games and extended their unbeaten run in the Seville derby to six games with a 2-0 win over Real Betis. Kevin Gameiro's 25th goal of the season put the hosts in front before captain Coke sealed the three points 10 minutes from time."
64,15/04/2016,12:56,"Liverpool-Villarreal, Shakhtar-Sevilla in Europa League semis",Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool earned a Europa League semi-final against Villarreal from their heroic comeback against his former side Borussia Dortmund.,"Defending champions Sevilla face Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk in the second semi-final drawn Friday. Liverpool, who hit back from 2-0 and 3-1 down to beat Borussia 4-3 and progress into the semis 5-4 on aggregate, have never played Villarreal before. Sevilla ousted fellow Spaniards Athletic Bilbao on penalties in Thursday's quarter-final in their bid to win a third consecutive Europa League. The final is set for Basel, Switzerland, on May 18. The winners will get a place in next season's Champions League group stages. Liverpool are the only unbeaten side left in the competition, and goals from centre-backs Mamadou Sakho and Dejan Lovren completed one of the great Anfield comebacks against Dortmund. The first leg will be played in Villareal on April 28, with The Yellow Submarine heading to Merseyside for the return leg on May 5. The Spanish outfit, currently fourth in La Liga, are looking to reach their maiden major European final, after Europa League last-four defeats in 2004 and 2011 and a Champions League semi-final loss in 2006. In stark contrast, Liverpool are attempting to win their ninth major continental trophy, and in the process, draw level with Sevilla as the competition's record four-time winners. Sevilla's quartet of titles have all come in the last decade, with victory against Espanyol in 2007 making them just the second club after Real Madrid to win the competition in successive years. They backed that performance up by repeating the feat 11 months ago against Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, and now they have another Ukrainian outfit in Shakhtar standing in their way. The first leg will be played in Seville, before 2009 champions Shakhtar host the second game in Lviv. The country's civil war has forced them to play away from their home city."
65,03/04/2016,20:26,Villarreal tighten grip on Champions League return,Villarreal took another step towards a return to the Champions League next season as they came from behind to beat Eibar 2-1 on Sunday thanks to Roberto Soldado's second-half winner.,"Victory extends Villarreal's lead over Celta Vigo to eight points with just seven games remaining in the battle for fourth place. However, Sevilla can move up to fifth and close to within six points of Villarreal with victory over Real Sociedad later on Sunday. Eibar haven't won in seven league games to slip down to ninth after a fine start to the season, but they took a shock lead through Ander Capa midway after 22 minutes. However, going behind kicked Villarreal into gear and they levelled when Adrian Lopez tapped home after Abel Riesgo had blocked Soldado's initial effort. Soldado hadn't scored since February, but the former Tottenham Hotspur striker gratefully took his next chance five minutes after the break as a loose ball broke his way inside the area. Athletic Bilbao's hopes of catching Villarreal now look forlorn as they could only manage a 1-1 draw at home to Granada to fall nine points off the top four down in seventh. A draw moved Granada a point clear of the relegation zone. Espanyol are now eight points clear of the drop zone as they too settled for a 1-1 draw at Malaga."
66,20/03/2016,18:07,Barca extend advantage despite blowing two-goal lead,Barcelona extended their lead at the top of La Liga to nine points despite blowing a two-goal advantage to draw 2-2 at Villarreal on Sunday.,"Ivan Rakitic and a controversial Neymar penalty had Barca on course for a 13th consecutive La Liga win before half-time. Yet, Villarreal were more than worthy of a point and got their reward after the break through Cedric Bakambu and Jeremy Mathieu's own goal. Real Madrid can move to within 10 points of Barca ahead of the meeting between the two sides in two weeks when they host Sevilla later on Sunday. However, Sevilla also have the chance to close the gap on Villarreal to just three points in the fight for the fourth Champions League place. The sides held a minute's silence before kick-off in memory of 13 people killed in a bus crash carrying foreign exchange students in Spain earlier on Sunday. However, the sombre mood didn't affect Villarreal's start as they hit the woodwork inside the first minute when a Manu Trigueros effort was turned towards his own goal by Arda Turan. Claudio Bravo then blocked Bakambu's effort from a narrow angle as Barca struggled to contain Villarreal's pace on the break. Yet the visitors still struck first with some fortune as Lionel Messi's free-kick ricocheted off Luis Suarez and fell perfectly into the path of Rakitic to rifle home. The hosts were then furious when Gerard Pique was pardoned a second yellow card for clearly stopping a Villarreal attack by handling the ball on the ground after just 23 minutes. Villarreal boss Marcelino was expelled from the touchline for taking his protests too far. And worse was to come for the hosts when referee Jose Maria Sanchez Martinez pointed to the spot despite Sergio Asenjo clearly playing the ball as Neymar tried to round the goalkeeper. Neymar put Barca's recent troubles from the spot behind him to dink home the penalty for his 27th goal of the season. Pique was replaced by Mathieu early in the second period as Barca boss Luis Enrique looked to ensure his best defender was not suspended for the game against Madrid just after the international break. But that proved to be the turning point as Mathieu was constantly caught out. Bakambu halved the deficit with a simple finish after Bravo had parried Denis Suarez's initial effort. Mathieu then gifted Bakambu the ball straight from kick-off, but the Congolese forward tried to tee up Roberto Soldado instead of going for goal himself and Javier Mascherano intercepted. Soldado then missed a huge chance to level as he haded wide when unmarked from point-blank range. Asenjo also made a crucial contribution to Villarreal's comeback with a stunning save to stop Neymar making it 3-1. Moments later, Villarreal were level when the hapless Mathieu turned a corner into his own net. Barca regained their composure in the final quarter to ensure their unbeaten run in all competitions stretches to 39. Asenjo, who only returned from an 11-month injury layoff against Bayer Leverkusen on Thursday, got down well to his left to turn behind Rakitic's header. And the Croatian failed to make a good connection when Asenjo's unconvincing punch landed at his feet seven minutes from time."
67,28/02/2016,13:58,"Lucky 13 for Villarreal, close in on Real Madrid",Villarreal moved to within two points of Real Madrid in third in La Liga by stretching their unbeaten league run to 13 games with a comfortable 3-0 win over Levante on Sunday.,"Marcelino's men saw off Napoli in one of the ties of the Europa League last 32 on Thursday, but showed no ill effects as goals from Leo Baptistao and Samu Castillejo put them 2-0 up inside half an hour. Adrian Lopez added a third with his first goal for the club since joining on loan from Porto just after the break. And Levante's miserable day was completed when captain David Navarro was sent off for a second bookable offence, meaning he will miss the visit of Real Madrid on Wednesday. A fourth defeat in five games leaves Levante still four points off safety in 19th. At the very least, Villarreal now look assured of a return to the Champions League next season after opening up an 11-point lead on fifth-placed Sevilla. Real Madrid's title hopes were realistically ended on Saturday as they lost 1-0 at home to Atletico Madrid. Victory moved Atletico to within five points of leaders Barcelona, but the European champions can reestablish their eight-point advantage when they host Sevilla later on Sunday."
68,21/02/2016,22:31,"Advantage Barca as Real Madrid, Atletico held",Cristiano Ronaldo missed a penalty as Real Madrid's hopes of catching La Liga leaders Barcelona were all but ended with a 1-1 draw at Malaga on Sunday.,"Madrid remain nine points behind Barca with 13 games to go after Raul Albentosa cancelled out Ronaldo's opener. Atletico Madrid also failed to gain significant ground on Barca as they were held 0-0 at home by Villarreal to move eight points behind in second. However, Gary Neville's upturn in fortunes as Valencia boss continued with a third win in a week, 2-1 at Granada. Zinedine Zidane's men were left to rue Ronaldo's miss from the spot to make it 2-0 before the break when Carlos Kameni dived to his left to parry the three-time World Player of the Year's effort. ""It is obviously going to be difficult because we have dropped two points, but we won't give up,"" said Zidane. ""There are 39 points still to play for. You think the league is lost, but the players and myself don't believe that."" Madrid were without the injured Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale, while James Rodriguez was left on the bench by Zidane. The visitors were lucky to go in front as Ronaldo headed home Toni Kroos's free-kick despite clearly standing in an offside position. There was no doubt about the penalty award two minutes later, though, when Ronaldo was brought down by Weligton. Yet, despite being normally lethal from the spot, the Portuguese was denied by a fine low save by Kameni. Malaga missed a great chance to level before the break as Jesus Navas parried Duje Cop's shot into the air and Sergio Ramos got back to clear the looping ball off the line. And Navas then made an incredible stop just after the restart when Nacho turned Juanpi's cross towards his own goal. Yet, the Madrid stopper was finally beaten when Malaga's two centre-backs combined for the equaliser as Weligton's low cross was coolly slotted home at the back post by Albentosa. Chances were far harder to come by at the Vicente Calderon as the two best defences in the league stood firm. Atletico's top scorer Antoine Griezmann headed Juanfran's inch-perfect cross just wide before Angel Correa's audacious chipped effort forced Villarreal goalkeeper Alphonse Areola into his only serious save after half-time. And Villarreal could have snatched all three points on the break when Cedric Bakambu blazed over with just Jan Oblak to beat. Elsewhere, Neville's Valencia again rode their luck, but recorded back-to-back league wins for just the second time this season as Granada passed up a wave of second-half opportunities. With confidence high from their 6-0 thrashing of Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday, Valencia started the stronger and only great saves from Andres Fernandez prevented Paco Alcacer and Andres Gomez from giving Valencia a half-time lead. Dani Parejo eventually opened the scoring 10 minutes after the break when he swept home Alcacer's knockdown. However, Granada should have levelled in the final half hour as David Barral hit the bar and Youssef El-Arabi fired off target from close range. Santi Mina sealed the points for Valencia on the counter-attack before Edgar Mendes pulled a goal back in stoppage time. ""I think at the moment we need to win all our games to keep the momentum going,"" said Neville. ""The dressing room changed significantly in the last week in terms of mood as when you win there is a stronger belief."" Sevilla remain eight points off Villarreal in the battle for the final Champions League place as they blew a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Rayo Vallecano. Real Sociedad's surge up the table continued as Jonathas's brilliant strike handed them a 1-0 win over Athletic Bilbao in the Basque derby to move into the top half."
69,13/12/2015,22:31,"Real Madrid beaten again at Villarreal, Atletico joint top",Real Madrid's La Liga title hopes were dealt another huge blow as they suffered a third league defeat in five games to Roberto Soldado's solitary goal at Villarreal on Sunday.,"Atletico Madrid's 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao earlier in the day means Real now trail their city rivals and Barcelona by five points at the top of the table. Real were outplayed in the first-half, but reacted after the break and were left to rue a hat-trick of missed chances by troubled French striker Karim Benzema as defeat piles the pressure on under fire coach Rafael Benitez. Elsewhere, a late own goal salvaged a point for Valencia in Gary Neville's first taste of La Liga action as Los Che battled back with 10 men to draw 1-1 at Eibar. Real had won five consecutive games since being thrashed 4-0 at home by Barca last month, but were forced onto the back foot by a whirlwind start from Villarreal. Jonathan dos Santos had already smacked the inside of the post before Soldado turned home Cedric Bakambu's pass against his old club on eight minutes. Bakambu had two great chances to double Villarreal's advantage before half-time, but the Congolese striker pulled his shot wide when clean through on Keylor Navas before firing over from inside the area. Having been dominated in the first-half, Madrid came out a different side after the break and had a series of chances to turn the game on its head. Benzema had scored five times in his last two outings for Madrid despite his off-field problems which saw him indefinitely banned from playing for France in midweek, however his range was off as he volleyed inches wide from Gareth Bale's through ball. Another fine Bale cross was blasted over by Benzema moments later before Bale had a great chance himself, but on his weaker right foot didn't have the power to beat Alphonse Areola in the Villarreal goal. Benzema had one final chance to rescue a point, but his and Madrid's night was summed up when he headed wide when unmarked inside the area 17 minutes from time. Victory takes Villarreal back to within a point of fourth-placed Celta Vigo. At the Vicente Calderon, Atletico were forced to come from behind as they conceded for just the seventh time in 15 La Liga games this season when Aymeric Laporte swept home Benat Etxebarria's corner at the back post. Atletico had barely threatened in the first-half but levelled with the last action of the half as Saul Niguez headed in at the near post. Jan Oblak made two great saves at the start of the second period from Eneko Boveda and Aduriz to keep Atletico in the game. And they proved vital as Antoine Griezmann's stunning strike from 25 yards with Atletico's only serious effort of the second-half delivered a vital three points. ""We always work to be better and it is clear that we continue on our course, looking to improve without looking at the other teams,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone. ""It is not easy to concede first and come back. We are happy with our work, but we don't understand any other way than through sheer effort."" Valencia escaped from Eibar with a point despite another disappointing display after crashing out of the Champions League against Lyon in Neville's first game in charge in midweek. Sergi Enrich deservedly opened the scoring for Eibar with the last kick of the first half. However, the turning point came midway through the second period when Valencia goalkeeper Jaume Domenech saved Saul Berjon's penalty after Lucas Orban had been very harshly sent off for supposedly elbowing Dani Garcia. And Valencia got the slice of luck they needed when David Junca turned the ball into his own net five minutes from time. A point leaves Valencia seven points off the top four in eighth. ""The last 20 minutes is the minimum that Valencia should show every week,"" said Neville. ""We wanted to win, a draw is not ideal, but it is positive given the circumstances."""
70,13/11/2015,13:26,Villarreal boss Marcelino signs three-year deal,"Villarreal coach Marcelino Garcia Toral has agreed a three-year extension to his contract, the La Liga club confirmed on Friday.","Marcelino's deal had been due to expire at the end of this season, but he will now be tied to the club until 2019. Villarreal were rooted in mid-table in the second division when Marcelino took charge just short of three years ago. He inspired an upturn that led to promotion and back-to-back sixth place finishes back in the top flight. Villarreal currently lie fifth in La Liga and are well-placed to reach the last 32 of the Europa League."

Celta's bright start to the campaign had been aided by their three previous opponents having a man sent-off early on, but they needed no such help in Andalusia as a brilliant first-half display put them on course for victory. Nolito added to his burgeoning reputation as one of Spain's top strikers with a sweet finish from a narrow angle to open the scoring before Daniel Wass pounced on some shambolic Sevilla defending to fire in the second. Fernando Llorente was introduced at half-time by Sevilla boss Unai Emery and made a quick impact by nodding home his first goal for the club nine minutes into the second period. Yet, for all their dominance in the final half hour, Sevilla couldn't find an equaliser as they remain on just two points after four games. Athletic are only one point better off as they have struggled to overcome the hangover of their Spanish Super Cup success over Barcelona to start the campaign. By contrast, Villarreal are flying high as they scored three goals for the third consecutive game thanks to a penalty from Bruno and fine strikes from Mario Gaspar and Leo Baptistao before Aritz Aduriz scored a consolation for the visitors in stoppage time. Sporting Gijon claimed their first victory since returning to the top flight with a 3-2 win in a thrilling encounter away at Deportivo la Coruna. Antonio Sarabia struck twice in the opening seven minutes for Sporting before Juanfran and Luis Alberto brought Deportivo level before the half hour mark. However, the visitors got the winner in an open first-half through Alex Menendez to move into the top half of the table."

That loan agreement has now been cut short to allow the 21-year-old to join Villarreal. ""Barcelona, Sevilla and Villarreal have reached an agreement for the transfer of Denis Suarez to the Castellon club,"" Barcelona said in a statement on Saturday. ""The player was on loan at Sevilla in an operation ended at the end of this 2015/16 season. ""The azulgrana will maintain their buy-back option at the end of this season.

Soldado joined Spurs two years ago from Valencia for a then club record £26 million ($40.6 million) as Spurs invested heavily to compensate for the sale of Gareth Bale to Real Madrid. However, the 30-year-old failed to recreate his prolific La Liga form in England as he scored just seven times in 52 Premier League appearances. Soldado has a far better record in his homeland where he has scored 131 goals in spells at Real Madrid, Osasuna, Getafe and Valencia as well as scoring seven times in 12 caps for Spain. He becomes Villarreal's third high-profile signing of the summer after the double capture of Samuel Castillejo and Samuel Garcia from Malaga."

Villarreal sit top of the four-team table, but hosts Arsenal will win their own tournament for the first time since 2010 if they beat Bundesliga runners-up Wolfsburg later on Sunday due to their superior number of goals scored. It was another dispiriting defeat for Hubert Fournier's Lyon just 24 hours after the French team's humiliating 6-0 thrashing against Arsenal. Fournier admitted he will consider making new signings in the aftermath of a weekend that rocked his plans for the season after France midfielder Clement Grenier suffered a ruptured quad muscle on Saturday. ""We don't need to consider it's the end of the world by any means. But based on what I've noticed in the Emirates Cup we really have to strengthen,"" he said. ""It's up to us to try to find an answer so we can have a more solid central defensive partnership than we managed over the two games. ""We are a lot more leaky than we have been previously."" Fournier made 11 changes to his starting line-up and the switches made Lyon more competitive, but they still couldn't avoid another morale-denting loss ahead of their Trophee des Champions showdown with Paris Saint Germain next weekend. And the Lyon boss conceded his team's poor form has left him uncertain who to select for the PSG clash. ""We will analyse what we have seen and try to come up with the most suitable line-up,"" he added. ""Grenier's injury means we need to think about the best formation to meet Paris Saint Germain.

Villarreal also had plenty of chances, with both Samuel Castillejo and Gerard Moreno denied by keeper Mathieu Gorgelin. Lyon captain Steed Malbranque rattled the crossbar with a dipping volley from the edge of the penalty area. But it was Villarreal who took the lead in the 31st minute when Dylan Mboumbouni conceded a penalty with a clumsy barge into the back of Javier Espinosa as they contested a header. Villarreal skipper Soriano stepped up to calmly stroke the spot-kick past Gorgelin. Lyon struck the woodwork again just before half-time when Bakary Kone's powerful header cannoned back off the bar from Arnold Mvuemba's corner.

Villarreal, who finished sixth in La Liga last season, opened the scoring in the eighth minute when Spanish right-back Gaspar seized on Samuel Castillejo's deflected pass into the penalty area and slammed his left-footed strike past Wolfsburg goalkeeper Koen Casteels into the top corner. Dieter Hecking's Wolfsburg were level within two minutes, with Croatia winger Ivan Perisic slotting home at the far post after Daniel Caligiuri's low cross exposed the back-pedaling Villarreal defence. It was the kind of incisive run and finish that showed why Inter Milan are keen to sign the 26-year-old. But Villarreal were back in front in the 17th minute after referee Bobby Madley waved play on following a bone-jarring midfield collision and teenage midfielder Nahuel Leiva took advantage, sprinting clear to stroke a cool finish past Casteels. With Wolfsburg playmaker Kevin De Bruyne showing little of the quality that has made him a Manchester City transfer target, the Belgium international, who had been booked in the first half, was taken off with 30 minutes left. De Bruyne's departure was one of a raft of second half substitutions that included a return to the Emirates for Wolfsburg's former Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner, but the Dane couldn't inspire a late equaliser.

Villarreal, who finished sixth in La Liga to qualify for the UEFA Europa League next season, should have equalised in the second half but spurned two excellent scoring chances. Striker Luciano Vietto attempted to chip over Roar goalkeeper Jamie Young with a penalty kick in the 69th minute, but his touch was too heavy and the ball floated over the bar.

Reds defender Marrone doubled the home side's lead in the 50th minute, getting on the end of a Goodwin corner to head home from close range. But Villarreal, despite making half a dozen changes to their line-up, struck back through Trigueros in the 63rd minute when he pounced on a block from goalkeeper Eugene Galekovic save and found the net. The Spaniards equalised 23 minutes later when a superb cross was met by Vietto, who found space between defenders to nod home.

However, it was Villarreal who enjoyed much the better of the opening 45 minutes on Sunday with Moi Gomez striking the bar and Nico Pareja clearing on-loan Arsenal forward Joel Campbell's goalbound shot off the line. Yet, as in their European meetings, it was Sevilla who were more deadly in front of goal and went in front five minutes into the second-half as Coke collected Diogo Figueiras's pass and slotted in off the far post. Vitolo then displayed the quality finishing that has caught Vicente del Bosque's eye with a cushioned volley past Sergio Asenjo from Coke's deflected cross."

The next month will go a long way to deciding the fate of Luis Enrique's men as City visit the Camp Nou on March 18 before Madrid make the same journey four days later. However, Enrique is determined his star-studded squad do not take their eye off the ball at El Madrigal despite their healthy advantage in the tie. ""I am concentrating on the game against Villarreal, it doesn't matter if it is the most difficult month. We will do what we have in every game and that is focus on the opponent in front of us."" The former Barca captain did though admit that his team selection may be affected by the fact the on-form Luis Suarez and Javier Mascherano are one booking away from missing the final. ""It is something to bear in mind,"" he added. ""A final is in play and it is interesting but it doesn't condition the game. To be able to play the final you have to get through the semi-final."" Villarreal have enjoyed a fantastic season so far as they too are still involved on three fronts. The Yellow Submarine lie sixth in La Liga, progressed to the last 16 of the Europa League with a 5-2 aggregate victory over Red Bull Salzburg last week and now have a first Copa del Rey final in their history within reach. Yet, they have been beaten by Barca in all three of their previous meetings this season and Enrique expects a more offensive threat from the hosts on Wednesday. ""The Villarreal I have seen in the league isn't the Villarreal that have faced us in three games. I think they play with the ball less when they play against us. ""I think tomorrow we will see a more offensive version than we have seen in the three games this season and they have nothing to lose."" Villarreal boss Marcelino was insistent after Saturday's draw at the Bernabeu that his decision to make seven changes from the side that started in Salzburg had been vindicated. A host of first-team regulars including top-scorer Luciano Vietto and on-loan Madrid winger Dennis Cheryshev will return against Barca and Marcelino believes they can score the goals needed to pull off a huge upset. ""We are capable of causing Barcelona problems,"" he said. ""We hit the post against them three times earlier this season and lost. ""I hope that this time luck and our play allow us to get to the final, but, like against Real Madrid, we are playing against the best in the world."" In the other semi-final, Espanyol hold the upper hand as they host Athletic Bilbao with the cushion of an away goal after a 1-1 draw in the first leg three weeks ago."
83,01/03/2015,23:58,Real Madrid held at home by Villarreal,Real Madrid missed the chance to move four points clear of Barcelona at the top of La Liga after being held to a 1-1 draw by Villarreal on Sunday.,"Cristiano Ronaldo's early second-half penalty looked to have Madrid on course for a fourth consecutive win, but Gerard Moreno's thunderous equaliser 26 minutes from time earned the visitors a deserved point. Champions Atletico Madrid failed to gain any ground on the leaders as they battled to a 0-0 draw at Sevilla. Fourth-placed Valencia are now just a point adrift of Atletico after they were comfortable 2-0 winners over David Moyes's Real Sociedad thanks to a double from Pablo Piatti. ""The two halves were completely different,"" said Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti ""In the first-half the tempo was slow and we had to look for a lot of crosses because we didn't move the ball quickly. ""In the second the tempo was different. We had a lot of chances, but we weren't efficient."" Villarreal were without a host of first team regulars as coach Marcelino continues to prioritise progress in the Copa del Rey and Europa League. However, the visitors started the brighter and should have been in front on 12 minutes when Iker Casillas made a fine save from Moreno and then Dani Carvajal headed Moi Gomez's follow-up effort off the line. The European champions began to bombard the Villarreal defence with crosses as the half developed and Gareth Bale came close to an opener when his header from Toni Kroos's corner flashed wide. From the German World Cup winner's next set-piece delivery, Raphael Varane went even closer with a header that also just missed the target. Ronaldo saw his first effort on target of the evening well saved by Sergio Asenjo three minutes into the second-half. But there was nothing the goalkeeper could do to prevent the World Player of the Year opening the scoring from the spot after he had been pulled down inside the area by Eric Bailly. Ronaldo should have doubled his tally moments later when he latched onto a wonderful through ball by Bale, but Asenjo rushed from his goal-line to make a brave block. The roles were reversed two minutes later as Ronaldo teed up Bale, but the Welshman's off night in front of goal continued as he blasted well over. That miss was to prove costly when Villarreal levelled thanks to a wonderful low finish by Moreno. Ronaldo had the chance to restore Madrid's lead four minutes later as he showed Bailly a clean pair of heels, but was once again denied by Asenjo. And the former Atletico Madrid stopper made his best stop of the night seconds leader to turn Ronaldo's powerful header over. Asenjo nearly undid all of his good work when he flapped at Marcelo's cross six minutes from the end, but was grateful to see Jese Rodriguez slot the rebound wide. Casillas then had to make another great save of his own at the other end to prevent Luciano Vietto heading home a winner for Villarreal before Ronaldo nodded over one last chance in a frantic finale. Earlier, Sevilla and Atletico seemed to suffer a hangover from their European encounters in midweek at the Sanchez Pizjuan in a tense game short on clear-cut chances. Sevilla had the better of the first period as Vicente Iborra struck the post and Miguel Angel Moya in the Atletico goal made a couple of smart stops. However, the introduction of Koke and Fernando Torres from the bench gave the visitors a boost after the break. Torres had the best chance to win the game when he broke clear seven minutes from time, but the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker saw his shot slide across goal and beyond the far post."
84,27/02/2015,02:17,Real Madrid look to maintain title momentum against Villarreal,European champions Real Madrid will be aiming to maintain their recent winning form when they host high-flying Villarreal at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday.,"Barca's shock 1-0 defeat to Malaga last weekend allowed Madrid to open up a healthy advantage thanks to their best La Liga performance in some time in a 2-0 win over Elche. World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo scored his side's second at the Martinez Valero to end a three-game La Liga goal drought and open up a three-goal lead over Lionel Messi in their personal dual for the Pichichi top goalscorer award. However, Madrid continue to be dogged by injury problems with Gareth Bale a doubt for the visit of Villarreal due to an ankle injury he suffered as a result of a horrendous challenge from Aaron Niguez last weekend. The Welshman's absence could allow Jese Rodriguez a rare start with Luka Modric, James Rodriguez, Sergio Ramos and Sami Khedira all still sidelined by long-term injuries. Los Blancos' task is likely to be made easier, though, as Villarreal also won't be at full strength after seeing off Red Bull Salzburg to progress to the last 16 of the Europa League just four days before their trip to the Bernabeu. The Yellow Submarine's coach Marcelino said after their 3-1 victory in Austria on Thursday that the ""same players would definitely not play"" in order to give many of his regulars a rest. Moreover, on-form Russian winger Denis Cheryshev will definitely miss out for the visitors as he is on-loan from Madrid. Barcelona have the chance to reduce the gap at the top to a point for 24 hours at least when they travel to Granada on Saturday."
85,11/02/2015,22:49,Barcelona ease towards Copa del Rey final,Barcelona took a huge step towards a fifth Copa del Rey final in seven years with a 3-1 win over Villarreal in the first leg of their semi-final on Wednesday.,"Lionel Messi opened the scoring from Luis Suarez's cutback four minutes before the break, but Villarreal levelled shortly after half-time when Marc-Andre Ter Stegen failed to keep out Manu Trigueros's drive. However, Barca were back in front within a minute through Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique's header 26 minutes from time made it 3-1. The Catalans could have had an even healthier advantage to take into the second leg on March 4, but Neymar had his penalty saved by Sergio Asenjo. ""I think it was a very good performance on our part against an opponent that was more defensive than we expected, but against a very good team. It is a good result, although it isn't definitive,"" said Barca boss Luis Enrique. ""It could have been even better with the penalty we missed, but it is a good result and deserved based on what we saw on the pitch."" Villarreal coach Marcelino meanwhile described his side's evening like a ""horror film"" having not only lost the match but captain Bruno and former Barca midfielder Jonathan dos Santos to injury. ""This game seemed lke a horror film. Barcelona took advantage of our mistakes and scored the type of goals we didn't expect. ""We have two injuries, one of which could be serious. I am sad for all these combined circumstances that mean we are much further away from reaching the final."" All of Villarreal's good defensive work in the opening 45 minutes was undone four minutes before half-time when Mateo Musacchio slipped to allow Suarez to rob possession and he squared for Messi to slot home his 11th goal in his last nine games. The roles were reversed a minute later as this time Messi freed Suarez inside the box, but the Uruguayan drove his low shot beyond the far post. For all their dominance, Barca nearly went in at the break level as Villarreal's only threatening counter-attack of the half ended with Ter Stegen making a fine save to turn Luciano Vietto's shot behind. However, the young German goalkeeper was very much at fault when Villarreal did equalise just three minutes after half-time when he failed to keep out Trigueros's thunderbolt from outside the area. The visitors were only on level terms for a minute as Suarez again created the danger when he claimed to have been fouled inside the area by Mario Gaspar and Iniesta swept the loose ball into the far corner. Another defensive error allowed Barca to extend their lead when Musacchio and Asenjo were caught flat-footed by Messi's corner and Pique headed home unmarked at the far post. Musacchio was also at fault seven minutes later when he handled as Messi tried to wriggle free inside the area. The Argentinian had missed from the spot in the previous round against Atletico Madrid and handed the responsibility to Neymar, but he too failed from 12 yards as Asenjo made a comfortable save low to his right. Suarez nearly rounded off the evening with a stunning effort from just inside the Villarreal half, but the ball floated just wide with Asenjo beaten."
86,10/02/2015,14:21,Barca boss wary of dangerous Villarreal,Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has insisted his players should be well warned of the dangers posed by Villarreal in their Copa del Rey semi-final having been pushed all the way by the Yellow Submarine just 10 days ago.,"Villarreal travel to the Camp Nou for the first leg of the tie on Wednesday hoping to avenge the only defeat in their last 20 games in all competitions stretching back to November. A stunning Lionel Messi winner separated the sides on February 1, but Barca twice had to come from behind before eventually emerging 3-2 victors to remain just a point behind league leaders Real Madrid. ""We will analyse the league game and what things we could improve on to attack better and find more solutions,"" Enrique said on Tuesday. ""Perhaps that it is a bit easier because the game against Villarreal is so recent. ""We will go into the game with the same mentality as the league match, which is to win the game. We know it is a big game for Villarreal having never been in the semi-finals before, they are having a great season and will pose us plenty of difficulties. ""It is important not to concede given the value that away goals have, but our first objective is to win the game."" Holding Villarreal scoreless is likely to prove a mammoth task as Marcelino's men have found the net in each of their last 27 games. However, Barca have more than enough firepower to overcome the concession of an away goal with Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez in fine form. All three were on target as Barca took their tally to 34 goals in winning their last nine games with a 5-2 victory at Athletic Bilbao, but it was especially important for Suarez to find the net after a five-game goalless streak. ""Luis Suarez is involved in almost all our attacks that end in a goal,"" added Enrique in defence of the club's record signing. ""We are very happy with what he offers us and I am sure he will only improve."""
87,01/02/2015,23:50,"Neymar, Messi lead Barca fightback against Villarreal",Barcelona moved back to within a point of La Liga leaders Real Madrid as they twice came from behind to beat Villarreal 3-2 in a thrilling encounter on Sunday.,"Madrid loanee Denis Cheryshev put Villarreal ahead against the run of play after half an hour only for the in-form Neymar to level just before the break. A crazy four-minute spell early in the second-half then yielded three goals as Luciano Vietto put Villarreal back in front, but Rafinha quickly equalised before Lionel Messi struck a memorable winner from the edge of the box. Victory takes Barca back three points clear of third-placed Atletico Madrid, but Real can regain their four-point lead at the top when they host Sevilla in their game in hand on Wednesday. ""For us it is a pleasure to have players that can change the game and they are in special form,"" Barca boss Luis Enrique said of Messi and Neymar, who have now scored 17 goals between them in their last seven outings. However, Villarreal boss Marcelino lamented his side's inability to put the pressure on Barca by conserving their leads for a prolonged period of time. ""We played a great match and competed with them using our own strengths. The goal they scored 30 seconds before half-time damaged us. Then within two minutes of going 2-1 in front they scored two. ""That is Barca. They have the best players in the world in attack and punish any error you make."" Barcelona started brightly but Luis Suarez's struggles in front of goal continued as the Uruguayan failed to hit the target twice when well-placed inside the area, as well as seeing a fine strike from the edge of the area turned behind by Sergio Asenjo. The hosts were then punished for the former Liverpool man's profligacy when Villarreal broke and Mario Gaspar's wayward effort was deflected beyond Claudio Bravo by Cheryshev. Crucially Barca managed to get on level terms a minute before the break when Asenjo again parried from Rafinha's curling effort, but Neymar was on hand to continue his scoring streak with his 22nd of the season. Enrique's men were caught out once more at the start of the second-half, though, as a former Barca favourite Giovani dos Santos galloped in behind the Catalans' defence and squared for Vietto to apply a simple finish. However, again Villarreal couldn't hold onto their lead for long as just two minutes later Suarez squared for Messi and when his headed effort was blocked, Rafinha pounced to rattle home from close range. Suarez then teed up Messi once more as Barca turned the game on its head moments later when the Argentine fired high past Asenjo on his weaker right foot from outside the box. Villarreal refused to give in and briefly thought they were level when Mateo Musacchio bundled home from close range only to be denied by an offside flag. From the resulting free-kick Barca sped upfield and Neymar was unlucky not to win a penalty when he was wiped out by Asenjo before Suarez failed to turn Dani Alves's driven cross on target. A first defeat in 19 games in all competitions leaves Villarreal now four points adrift of Sevilla in the final Champions League spot. Earlier, the Andalusians exacted revenge over Espanyol for their Copa del Rey elimination in midweek as they came from behind to move above Valencia into fourth with a 3-2 win. Cristian Stuani put the visitors in front from the penalty spot before goals from Diogo Figueras and Vitolo turned the game around. Espanyol 'keeper Kiko Casilla was then sent-off for handling outside his area just before half-time. Victor Sanchez gave Espanyol hope of an unlikely point when he curled home 13 minutes from time, but Iago Aspas had the final say when he latched onto substitute Carlos Bacca's through ball to finish low into the far corner in the 89th minute. Levante dropped to the bottom of the table as two second-half goals from Aritz Aduriz handed Athletic Bilbao a 2-0 win at the Ciutat de Valencia. Almeria moved out of the relegation zone as a solitary goal from Edgar was enough to earn three points in a 1-0 win over Getafe."
88,28/01/2015,18:14,Arsenal complete Gabriel deal,"Arsenal announced on Wednesday that they have completed the signing of Brazilian defender Gabriel Paulista from Villarreal, with Joel Campbell moving in the opposite direction in a short-term loan deal.","""Arsenal have signed Brazilian defender Gabriel from Villarreal, with Joel Campbell agreeing a new long-term deal prior to a loan move to the La Liga side,"" the Premier League club said on their website. Arsenal did not specify the length of Gabriel's contract or the transfer fee, but British press reports claimed they had paid around £11 million ($16.7 million, 14.7 million euros) for the 24-year-old centre-back. ""I had a talk with my family and I told them that it was my dream to play in the Premier League. Getting here to such a big club is so gratifying,"" Gabriel said. ""I am arriving at a big club and the fans can expect to find a Gabriel with a great will to help everyone. Not just thinking of me as an individual, because to me that is not important. ""I care more about helping the team and my team-mates. I want to help everyone, so the fans can expect a Gabriel that on the field has a lot of will to be able to help the team win important things."" Gabriel, who is uncapped, has been awarded a work permit after Arsenal successfully argued that he should be granted exemption from a rule requiring non-European Union players to play for a country ranked in the world's top 70 and to have played in at least 75 percent of their country's competitive games over a two-year period. He will provide competition for Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny and fills the void created by Thomas Vermaelen's move to Barcelona during the last close season. Gabriel started his career with Vitoria in his homeland before joining Villarreal at the start of last season. This season he helped Villarreal climb to sixth place in La Liga and reach the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey and the last 32 of the Europa League. Villarreal will be the fourth European club that Campbell has been loaned to since he signed for Arsenal in 2011, after previous stints at Lorient, Real Betis and Olympiakos. The 22-year-old forward impressed for Olympiakos last season and starred for Costa Rica at the World Cup in Brazil, but has made only three starts for Arsenal this season. He will remain at Villarreal until the end of the season."
89,24/01/2015,22:08,Villarreal agree Gabriel deal with Arsenal,La Liga side Villarreal announced on Saturday that they have reached an agreement with Arsenal for the transfer of Brazilian defender Gabriel Paulista.,"As part of the deal, Costa Rican forward Joel Campbell will join Villarreal on loan for the rest of the season. Paulista wasn't included for Villarreal's home game against Levante on Saturday. ""Agreement in principle for the transfer of Gabriel to Arsenal, who will say goodbye after today's game. We wish him all the best,"" said a statement on Villarreal's official Twitter account. ""Welcome to Joel Campbell. Loan agreement with Arsenal for the rest of the season,"" the club added. Paulista started his career with Vitoria in his homeland before joining Villarreal at the start of last season. However, he has played a more important role during the current campaign, starting every league match until Saturday as Villarreal put together a 16-game unbeaten run to move up to sixth in La Liga and progress to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey and last 32 of the Europa League. Campbell has continued to see his opportunities at Arsenal limited this season despite a starring role as Costa Rica reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup last year. The 22-year-old also has experience of La Liga having spent a year on loan with Real Betis during the 2012-13 season."
90,22/01/2015,13:09,"Gabriel to Arsenal '50-50', says Wenger","Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger expressed cautious optimism over his side's move for Villarreal's Brazilian centre-back Gabriel Paulista on Thursday, describing the transfer as ""50-50"".","Gabriel, 24, reportedly has a release clause of 20 million euros ($23.3 million) in his contract, but British press reports claim Arsenal have offered a fee rising to around 13 million euros. Any deal would also be contingent on the player being granted a work permit by the British government. Gabriel does not meet the automatic requirements because he is not yet a full international. ""We are talking at the moment. Can we find an agreement or not? I don't know. We are slowly progressing, but there is a chance,"" Wenger told a press conference on Thursday. Asked about the chances of a deal going through, Wenger replied: ""50-50 at this moment, yes. ""We are ready to pay the price we think is right for a good player, no matter what the price is. If we think it's the right price, we will pay."" Non-European Union players wishing to play in the Premier League must play for a country ranked within the world's top 70 and have played in at least 75 percent of their country's competitive games over a two-year period if they are to be automatically granted a work permit. But clubs can argue that a player with ""exceptional target"" should be granted an exemption, as Arsenal have previously done with Japanese midfielder Ryo Miyaichi and Brazil-born Croatia striker Eduardo da Silva. ""If a player we want needs a work permit then we will defend it now because we will not necessarily want to do it in the summer,"" added Wenger. ""We respect the rules in England. When you buy a player who does not fulfil the criteria and needs a work permit, you go in front of a commission and they tell you yes or no. We will accept that."""
91,21/12/2014,14:25,Villarreal climb after seventh straight win,Villarreal registered their seventh consecutive win in all competitions to move above Sevilla on goal difference into fifth in La Liga thanks to a 3-0 victory over Deportivo la Coruna on Sunday.,"Jonathan dos Santos got the hosts off to the perfect start when the on-loan Barcelona midfielder slammed home his first goal for the club. Argentine striker Luciano Vietto then added to his fine debut season in Spain with two simple finishes five minutes apart midway through the second-half to make the game safe before the hosts ended with 10 men when substitute Tomas Pina was sent-off. Marcelino's men shot themselves back into contention for a return to the Champions League by inflicting Atletico Madrid's first defeat at the Vicente Calderon for 19 months last weekend and were in no mood to lose any ground in the battle for the top four as they flew out of the blocks. They were rewarded with the opening goal after just 10 minutes when Fabricio could only parry Denis Cheryshev's low effort into the path of Dos Santos who gratefully steered the ball into an empty net. The Deportivo 'keeper redeemed himself with fine saves from Cheryshev, Vietto and Ikechukwu Uche to keep the visitors in the game at half-time. But despite an improved start to the second period they were hit again on the counter-attack for the crucial second goal 22 minutes from time when Victor Ruiz squared for Vietto to tap home. Five minutes later it was 3-0 in similar fashion as this time Cheryshev rolled the ball across the area for Vietto to slot home his 12th goal of the season. Villarreal's day was somewhat soured as Pina only lasted four minutes before being shown a straight red card for a lunge on Alex Bergantinos, but Deportivo couldn't manage a consolation, and they remain just a point outside the relegation zone. On Saturday, Luis Suarez scored his first La Liga goal and Lionel Messi netted twice as Barcelona moved to within a point of leaders Real Madrid with a 5-0 thrashing of Cordoba. Victory moves Barca six points clear of champions Atletico Madrid, who visit Athletic Bilbao later on Sunday, but Real Madrid will end the year on top despite having played a game less due to their participation in the Club World Cup this weekend. Real host Sevilla in their last game of the year on Wednesday."
92,14/12/2014,22:26,Villarreal end Atletico's 28-match unbeaten home run,Spanish champions Atletico Madrid suffered their first home league defeat in 28 matches as Luciano Vietto blasted home the winner six minutes from time to hand Villarreal a 1-0 win at the Vicente Calderon on Sunday.,"An uncharacteristically error-strewn performance from Diego Simeone's men was deservedly punished by the visitors, who could have been out of sight before the goal but for two fine saves by Miguel Angel Moya. Defeat leaves Atletico now seven points adrift of leaders Real Madrid and still three off second-placed Barcelona, who were the last team to beat Atletico on home soil in La Liga back in May 2013, whilst Villarreal move up to sixth. The result also rounded off a perfect weekend for Real Madrid as they extended their lead at the top to four points after sealing their 20th consecutive win in all competitions 4-1 over Almeria on Friday, whilst Barcelona stumbled to a 0-0 draw at Getafe 24 hours later. ""I can only talk about the match because I was concentrated on the play,"" said Simeone, who gave Vietto his professional debut during his stint in charge of Racing Club in Argentina. ""It was an even match in terms of chances and the side that was more efficient was always going to have more chance to win. ""They won the game with a goal by Vietto and I am happy for him despite the fact we had gone more than a year without losing here."" Villarreal boss Marcelino, meanwhile, believed his side deserved the win after running Real Madrid, Barcelona and Sevilla close this season. ""This group deserved a victory like this,"" he said. ""We have been very close in other games against the big sides where we have played well but not won."" Atletico were playing for the first time at the Calderon since a Deportivo La Coruna fan was killed in clashes near the stadium ahead of a meeting between the two sides a fortnight ago. The club had promised to crackdown on their unruly ultras, but the unusually flat atmosphere in front of a half-empty stadium seemed to affect the Spanish champions in a first-half littered with errors. Villarreal had the best chance of the opening half when Denis Cheryshev burst clear but opted to go for goal himself rather than square to the unmarked Vietto and Moya made a comfortable save. Mario Mandzukic had a wonderful chance to continue his fine goalscoring form when he latched onto Diego Godin's knockdown after the break, but former Atletico 'keeper Asenjo bravely blocked the Croatian's effort from point black range. Moments later Mandzukic was denied by referee Pedro Jesus Perez Montero as he harshly ruled out the former Bayern Munich man's headed finish for a push on Mario Gaspar. In their push for a winner, though, Atletico were leaving themselves exposed on the counter and were only pardoned by a poor touch from Vietto when he was this time released clean through on goal by Cheryshev. The Argentine's mis-control allowed Moya to get a vital touch before Diego Godin completed the clearance. Atletico were thankful to another fine stop from Moya to prevent Cheryshev opening the scoring with a piledriver from a narrow angle. Yet, there was nothing he could do to prevent Vietto inflicting a first league defeat at home in 19 months when he turned Godin and fired high into the net six minutes from time. Earlier, Sevilla's hopes of securing a return to the Champions League next season suffered a blow as they were held 0-0 at home by a resilient Eibar at the Sanchez Pizjuan. A point means Sevilla remain in fourth, but are now only two points in front of Valencia, whilst Eibar move up to ninth."
