0,13/02/2021,16:12,Atletico back to winning ways with narrow Granada victory,Atletico Madrid swerved a second consecutive slip in La Liga on Saturday by squeezing past Granada 2-1 to move eight points clear at the top of the table.,"After drawing at home to Celta Vigo on Monday, Diego Simeone's side got back on track with a narrow victory at Los Carmenes, secured by Angel Correa's fortuitous winner in the second half. There was a hint of luck in Granada's equaliser too, Yangel Herrera's shot deflecting off Marcos Llorente, who had himself put Atletico in front only three minutes earlier. Barca, who are third and 11 points behind the leaders, face Alaves at home later on Saturday before Real Madrid host Valencia on Sunday. ""The most important thing today was the fight and the energy of the team,"" said Simeone afterwards. At the full-time whistle, he shook his fists and sprinted down the tunnel, his relief evident at the end of a game that could easily have seen more points dropped for his side. Granada have been one of the stories of the season, sitting eighth under Diego Lopez after being promoted two years ago, and they were far from outclassed by La Liga's frontrunners. Suarez had scored in six of the previous seven games but for once the 34-year-old was not the matchwinner, with Llorente and Correa - two unsung heroes this season - instead proving the difference. Llorente's goal was his seventh of the season while his lay-off for Correa was his sixth assist. ""As coaches trophies are wonderful because they fill you with excitement and glory,"" Simeone said of Llorente. ""But when you work with a footballer and see them grow, you feel even more joy and more enthusiasm to keep doing what you're doing."" Suarez went closest to giving Atletico the lead when his shot into the ground flew up and grazed the crossbar just after half-time. A miscontrol by the Uruguayan at the back post saw another chance go begging but Llorente took over, nipping in from the right and dragging a shot with his left foot inside the near post. It was the first of three goals in 11 minutes, as Herrera equalised shortly after. Atletico's Yannick Carrasco and Saul Niguez were both guilty of light challenges on Jorge Molina, who battled to shift the ball into the path of Herrera, whose finish hit Llorente and crept in. But eight minutes later, Atletico were ahead again, the final shot taken by Correa, after more good work from Llorente. Correa weaved into space in the area, his driven effort skipping up off Jesus Vallejo and looping into the far corner."
1,03/02/2021,23:43,Griezmann double inspires Barca cup comeback against Granada,Antoine Griezmann led Barcelona back from the brink on Wednesday as the Catalans beat Granada 5-3 after extra-time to win a riveting cup tie and reach the Copa del Rey semi-finals.,"Barca looked set to crash out at Los Carmenes when Granada led 2-0 with two minutes of normal time remaining but Griezmann scored one goal in the 88th minute and then set up Jordi Alba for a dramatic equaliser in the 92nd. Griezmann then headed his team in front in extra-time only for Granada's Fede Vico to make it 3-3 with a penalty. Yet Frenkie de Jong's finish and a thumping volley from Alba, also set up by Griezmann, sent a relieved Barcelona through."
2,11/01/2021,12:35,"Messi on form, a new American star and Bayern beaten: Talking points from around Europe","Lionel Messi is bang in form in the new year, Schalke avoided matching the Bundesliga record for the most consecutive games without a win and there was a very rare defeat for Bayern Munich.","AFP Sport rounds up some of the main talking points from across the continent: Lionel Messi looks like a man on a mission at the start of 2021 and what could be his final six months as a Barcelona player. On Saturday he scored twice -- including direct from a free-kick, one of his late-career specialities -- in a 4-0 win at Granada. That followed a masterful double and two shots off the post in a 3-2 midweek victory at Athletic Bilbao. Before that he provided the assist for Frenkie de Jong's winner at Huesca, and Barcelona have won three out of three since the turn of the year, while Messi is now La Liga's top scorer. Maybe it's not too late for Ronald Koeman's side to challenge for the title: they are third, four points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, albeit having played three games more. Matthew Hoppe is the latest young American to break through in the Bundesliga and he is already a hero for Schalke supporters. The California-born 19-year-old, who made his debut in November, had never scored a senior goal before netting a hat-trick -- the first ever for an American in the Bundesliga -- in the 4-0 defeat of Hoffenheim that rescued the Royal Blues from equalling an unwanted record. Their first win since January 17 last year, after 30 games without, prevented them from matching Tasmania Berlin's infamous German top-flight record of 31 games without a victory set in 1965/66. Hoppe has given hope to a whole club, and suddenly Schalke have new cause for optimism as they bid to beat the drop. They are off the bottom, above Mainz, but they remain in the relegation zone. Bayern Munich had begun to look a little less irresistible on a run of eight straight Bundesliga matches in which they had conceded the opening goal. But they had won five and drawn three of those matches. Then on Friday they were 2-0 up away to Borussia Moenchengladbach only to lose 3-2, just their second Bundesliga defeat since losing at the same ground in December 2019. It is a result that keeps the Bundesliga title race very much alive, although Hansi Flick's team have a winnable run of matches upcoming and they remain top, two points clear of RB Leipzig, who lost 3-1 at home to Borussia Dortmund, for whom Erling Braut Haaland scored twice. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen are four points off the top after drawing 1-1 with Werder Bremen. Three days after a 3-1 home loss to reigning champions Juventus which ended a 27-game unbeaten run in Serie A stretching back to June, AC Milan bounced back to beat Torino 2-0 at San Siro. With second-placed city rivals Inter drawing at Roma, Milan are now three points clear at the top of the table, and remain seven ahead of Juventus, who are fourth but do have a game in hand. Added good news for Milan came with the return of veteran top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic as a late substitute for his first appearance since November 22 after injury. The Swede came on for Rafael Leao, who had earlier scored his third goal in five games. Can Zlatan now fire the Rossoneri to their first Scudetto since 2011? Mauricio Pochettino got his first victory as coach of Paris Saint-Germain, a 3-0 defeat of Brest, but it is Lyon who lead halfway through the Ligue 1 season. They claimed the symbolic title of autumn champions after coming back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at Rennes on Saturday with Memphis Depay scoring one fine goal before setting up Jason Denayer's equaliser. Rudi Garcia's team are unbeaten in 16 games although both PSG and Lille are just a point behind, and there is a very long way to go. Ensuring Depay stays to see out the remainder of his contract rather than leaving this month will be crucial."
3,09/01/2021,20:47,Messi revival continues as Barca thrash Granada,Lionel Messi is back in form and Barcelona are finding their feet after a 4-0 demolition of Granada on Saturday put them within four points of the top of La Liga.,"Messi scored twice to make it four goals in three matches since the turn of the year and his resurgence has coincided with an upturn for the team too, this victory Barca's third on the bounce. It puts them in sight of league leaders Atletico Madrid, even if Diego Simeone's side now have three games in hand. Atletico's match against Athletic Bilbao earlier on Saturday was postponed due to the snowstorm that has engulfed Spain this weekend. Messi's double, the second a sweetly-struck free-kick, came between two strikes from Antoine Griezmann, who is also enjoying a revival after a disappointing 18 months at Camp Nou. Some had wondered if Messi would ever get back to his best following an underwhelming start to the season but his latest contribution makes him the league's top scorer on 11 goals. After attempting to leave Barcelona last summer, the 33-year-old's recovery always felt dependent on him rediscovering his own motivation and focus. But Barca coach Ronald Koeman deserves credit for the rejuvenation of players like Griezmann, Ousmane Dembele and Frenkie de Jong, all of whom have improved significantly in recent matches. Barcelona's recovery has a long way to run, with unresolved issues on and off the pitch very likely to resurface before the end of the season. Yet Koeman will hope a corner has been turned and at a good time, with the Champions League last 16 tie against Paris Saint-Germain to come next month and a large chunk of the league calendar still remaining. Barca's first goal was fortunate, with Roberto Soldado seemingly surprised to have the ball passed at him by Sergio Busquets. Soldado's lashed clearance saw the ball sliced backwards to Griezmann, who touched and shot past Rui Silva. Griezmann was the instigator for the second goal too, the Frenchman driving forward to the edge of the area before transferring inside to Messi. Messi was given the yard he needed to shift onto his left foot and curl home. Messi made it three from a similar position, just on the edge of the box, this time the ball was stationary. Pedri had been prevented from running into the box and Messi fired the resulting free-kick low, perfectly into the corner. Griezmann made it four, firing in a scooped pass from Dembele on the turn. Messi went off with almost half an hour left, his work already done. Atletico's game at home to Athletic Bilbao was called off, with the snowfall in Madrid on Friday the heaviest since 1971. Bilbao's players were unable to land in the city and returned to Bilbao early on Friday evening. Seville was among the areas spared the awful weather conditions, with Sevilla able to play against Real Sociedad and win a five-goal thriller 3-2. Youssef En-Nesyri grabbed a hat-trick in a frantic match at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, where four goals were scored in the first 14 minutes before En-Nesyri decided it early in the second half. Defeat means Real Sociedad have won only one of their last six matches. They drop to fifth in La Liga, level on points with Sevilla."
4,08/11/2020,19:11,Real Sociedad go top after beating Covid-hit Granada,"Real Sociedad regained top spot in La Liga on Sunday after winning 2-0 against a depleted Granada, who could face punishment for fielding fewer than the required number of first-team players.","Nacho Monreal scored in the 22nd minute and Mikel Oyarzabal converted a penalty in the 27th at Anoeta to send la Real back above Atletico Madrid, who had briefly taken first place after thrashing Cadiz on Saturday. Atletico are three points behind but have two games in hand. Defeat means Granada drop to fifth, with the club currently hit by an outbreak of coronavirus. Granada had only seven first-team players available and finished with only four on the pitch, which is contrary to La Liga's minimum of five. The rest of the squad was made up of players from the youth team. It remains to be seen if La Liga take action, having already rejected Granada's request on Saturday for the game to be postponed. Unai Emery's Villarreal move up to second in the table after they won 3-1 against Getafe."
5,14/07/2020,00:01,Real Madrid one win from La Liga crown after beating Granada,Real Madrid need one victory to secure La Liga after they held off a second-half comeback from Granada on Monday to win 2-1 and move four points clear of Barcelona.,"With two games left, Madrid will be crowned champions if they beat Villarreal at home on Thursday regardless of how Barca fare at the Camp Nou against Osasuna. But they were made to sweat by a Granada team that are gunning for Europe and have been arguably the division's surprise of the season after being promoted from second tier last year. Ferland Mendy and Karim Benzema looked to have set Madrid on course for a comfortable win at Los Carmenes but Granada were transformed after the break and Darwin Machis's 50th-minute strike gave them hope. An increasingly nervous Madrid were clinging on by the end and needed Sergio Ramos to clear one shot off the line as Zinedine Zidane's side dug in for a ninth consecutive victory. ""Our vision when we start every season is to win the league,"" said Zidane. ""There are two games left. We are close but we're not there yet."" When the final whistle blew, Zidane roared with relief and Ramos clenched his fists after coming through their toughest test since the restart. ""We can't relax, we're a bit closer but we have to carry on,"" said Ramos afterwards. ""We let our guard down here a bit on the second half. We won the first half and lost the second and maybe that's a warning for us. We have to make sure we don't repeat that mistake."" Madrid could win La Liga for the third time in eight years at the Alfredo di Stefano Stadium on Thursday night. ""It would mean a lot,"" said Ramos. ""It's the prize for consistency over the whole year. Maybe we had a period of reflection during the suspension and we came back and reacted. We're in the race and hopefully on Thursday we can celebrate."" If Madrid slip up against Villarreal, they will still have a second chance on Sunday when they finish at Leganes while Barcelona visit Alaves. Machis's goal was the first Madrid have conceded in six matches but few would have seen it coming after the first half. Madrid scored twice in six minutes, with both goals coming from breaks down their left. Mendy had space in front of him and kept going, accelerating between Victor Diaz and Dimitri Foulquier before firing high and into the roof of the net from an acute angle. The second goal came down the same side, Isco's backheel allowing Luka Modric to switch left to Benzema, who this time cut inside Diaz and shot into the far corner. Madrid cruised through the rest of the half, pushing the ball around at will, but comfort perhaps created complacency and Granada improved after the break. Machis pulled a goal back, striking through the legs of Courtois after Casemiro was dispossessed in midfield and Madrid were rattled as Granada began to dictate play. A scramble in Madrid's six-yard box saw several players hacking at the ball in panic and Courtois was twice required to make smart saves late on. The closest Granada came was when the ball fell to Ramon Azeez at the back post and he fired towards the near post with Courtois stranded but Ramos was on the line to clear. Earlier, Villarreal's hopes of Champions League football were dashed after they lost 2-1 at home to Real Sociedad to confirm that fourth-placed Sevilla will join Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid in the competition next season. Villarreal remain fifth, three points ahead of Getafe and Real Sociedad, with all three hoping to secure a place in the Europa League. Getafe drew 0-0 against Alaves."
6,05/07/2020,00:26,Valencia pegged back by late Granada equaliser,Valencia's disappointing end to the season continued on Saturday as they conceded an 86th-minute equaliser to draw 2-2 away at Granada in La Liga.,"Three goals in seven second-half minutes sparked a thrilling contest at Los Carmenes and Valencia had the better of them, with Manu Vallejo and Goncalo Guedes overturning Carlos Fernandez's penalty for Granada. But Fede Vico's late free-kick found its way through a gap in the Valencia wall to salvage a deserved point for Granada, who stay level on points with their opponents after only being promoted last season. Valencia are still searching for their first victory since sacking coach Albert Celades on Tuesday. Voro Gonzalez, in his sixth spell in temporary charge, oversaw defeat on Wednesday by Athletic Bilbao. One win in seven games since La Liga restarted on June 11 have extinguished Valencia's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League but even making the Europa League next season looks increasingly unlikely. They sit ninth, five points adrift of Getafe in sixth, having played a game more. Granada are one place below in 10th. The home side took the lead in the 61st minute, winning a penalty after Fernandez beat Francis Coquelin to a pull-back to the edge of the area. Fernandez scored the penalty but Granada's lead lasted only two minutes, Vallejo latching on to Denis Cheryshev's lifted pass through and whipping the ball first time into the corner. Five minutes later, Valencia pulled ahead in stunning fashion as Guedes' rocket from 25 yards flew into the top corner off the hand of Rui Silva. But Granada hit back again, Vico's driven free-kick flying through a gap in the middle of Valencia's wall with four minutes left. Roberto Soldado could have won it for Granada in injury-time but Jasper Cillessen made the stop. Earlier, Celta Vigo's emergency signing Nolito scored his second goal since returning to the club last month but it was not enough for victory against Real Betis. Nolito's free-kick set Celta up for a valuable home victory at Balaidos only for Zouhair Feddal to smash in a Betis equaliser 11 minutes from the end to seal a 1-1 draw. It represents a missed opportunity for Celta to move further away from the relegation zone but they should still have enough for survival. They sit 17th, six points ahead of Real Mallorca, with four games left. Betis will be satisfied with a point too as they are now nine points clear of the bottom three. Valladolid climbed a point above Betis after they beat Alaves 1-0, Fernandez Moreno grabbing an 88th-minute winner to all-but guarantee their safety."
7,13/06/2020,00:19,Valencia and Getafe stumble in La Liga race for top four,Ten-man Levante scored a 98th-minute penalty on Friday to snatch a 1-1 draw against Valencia as La Liga completed its second day of fixtures since its return from the coronavirus suspension.,"It was a miserable night for the league's top-four hopefuls as Granada also came from behind to beat Getafe 2-1, meaning Atletico Madrid and Real Sociedad have the chance to capitalise on Sunday. Valencia looked to have grabbed a later winner themselves at an empty Mestalla when Rodrigo Moreno diverted in at the near post in the 89th minute. But Mouctar Diakhaby pulled down Ruben Vezo deep into injury-time and Gonzalo Melero made no mistake, equalising for Levante from the spot. The visitors also had Roger Marti sent off for a second yellow card in the 74th minute. Granada, also playing behind closed doors at Los Carmenes, scored in the 70th and 79th minutes as a Djene Dakonam own-goal and Carlos Fernandez's finish wiped out Getafe's lead, given to them in the first half by David Timor. Defeat means Getafe stay fifth, handing Atletico the chance to overtake them if they can win away at Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Valencia remain seventh, three points of adrift of Real Sociedad, who are at home on Sunday to Osasuna. Granada, who were only promoted last season, move up to eighth, with the Europa League places now in sight while Levante edge up to 12th. La Liga became the second of Europe's five major leagues after the German Bundesliga to resume on Thursday, when Sevilla overcame Real Betis 2-0 in the division's first match since March 10. League leaders Barcelona play away at Real Mallorca on Saturday before Real Madrid, two points behind in second, return at home to Eibar on Sunday."
8,12/06/2020,21:43,Getafe undone by late Granada double,Granada dented Getafe's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League by coming from behind to beat them 2-1 on Friday in La Liga's second game since its return from the coronavirus suspension.,"Played behind closed doors at Los Carmenes, Granada scored two late goals in nine minutes as a Djene Dakonam own-goal and Carlos Fernandez's finish wiped out Getafe's lead, given to them in the first half by David Timor. Defeat means Getafe stay fifth and hand Atletico Madrid the chance to overtake them if they can win away at Athletic Bilbao on Sunday. Granada, who were only promoted last season, move up to eighth, with the Europa League places now in sight. La Liga became the second of Europe's five major leagues after the German Bundesliga to resume on Thursday, when Sevilla overcame Real Betis 2-0 in the division's first match since March 10. League leaders Barcelona play away at Real Mallorca on Saturday before Real Madrid, two points behind in second, return at home to Eibar on Sunday."
9,12/02/2020,23:49,Muniain gives Athletic Bilbao edge in Copa del Rey smei-finals,Captain Iker Muniain scored the only goal as Athletic Bilbao defeated Granada 1-0 in the first leg of their Copa del Rey semi-final on Wednesday.,"Muniain, 27, had been red-carded in his team's 2-1 defeat to Real Sociedad in La Liga at the weekend. However, he was the toast of the city Wednesday when he latched onto a cross from Inaki Williams just three minutes before the interval to score the game's only goal. Athletic coach Gaizka Garitano named the same team which shocked Barcelona in the quarter-finals last week and they will consider themselves unfortunate not to have won by a greater margin on Wednesday after having two strikes ruled out for offside. The second, scored off a fine volley in the 61st minute by Ander Capa, needed an intervention by VAR. ""To be honest, we don't have good feelings after this game. In the dressing room, no one is happy,"" said Garitano. ""When you are not happy because you have made mistakes, so be it. But we found it very difficult to create scoring chances."" Athletic Bilbao won the first Copa del Rey in 1930 with a 3-2 win over Real Madrid. With 23 titles, they are second on the all-time list to Barcelona who have triumphed 30 times. However, their most recent success was back in 1984 after a 1-0 win over Barca. The second leg of the semi-final takes place on March 5. Thursday sees the first leg of the second semi-final with Real Sociedad taking on second division Mirandes."
10,09/02/2020,00:09,"Atletico get timely victory, Getafe make top-four statement","Atletico Madrid won for the first time in four games on Saturday thanks to a 1-0 win over Granada that moved them into fourth place in La Liga, as Getafe continued their surprising charge towards Champions League football.","Argentinian forward Angel Correa scored Atletico's only goal in the sixth minute at the Wanda Metropolitano, netting for the fifth time in nine matches. Atletico had goalkeeper Jan Oblak to thank for preserving the three points with a superb save from Roberto Soldado's crafty second-half backheel. Diego Simeone's side could be overtaken on Sunday by Sevilla, who visit Celta Vigo, but the coach welcomed the return to form for a side who must face holders Liverpool in the last 16 of the Champions League later this month. ""We needed to win. Our stadium's support was extraordinary, we needed that energy,"" Simeone said. Getafe took another step towards Champions League qualification as Jorge Molina scored twice in a sensational 3-0 win over fellow top-four contenders Valencia. The 37-year-old Molina capped a storming performance with two goals in the second half before Jaime Mata added a third with three minutes left, after Valencia's Alessandro Florenzi had been sent off. Getafe stay third, three points ahead of Atletico and Sevilla. Up next for Jose Bordalas' side is a trip to Barcelona next weekend but on this evidence, it will be the stumbling Catalans feeling nervous ahead of that game. Getafe face La Liga's defending champions on the back of four consecutive victories, in which they have scored nine goals and conceded none. They bullied Valencia from start to finish, faster to the ball and hungrier in the tackles with all three goals coming from Getafe's players reacting quicker than their opponents. ""It was all shit, in defence and in attack,"" said Valencia's Gabriel Paulista. ""We have to change today's attitude. They have been more like men."" After Barca, they will play Ajax in the Europa League. Valencia, meanwhile, have won only four out of nine games since the turn of the year, with their own Champions League last 16 tie against Atalanta fast approaching. Getafe had to wait until 13 minutes into the second for Molina's opener. He slid the ball to Mata and then beat two Valencia defenders to the rebound from Jaume Domenech's save. Dani Parejo was at fault for the second as he gave the ball away in midfield and one pass set Molina free. He had three defenders to beat but somehow bundled through, a final pirouette making space for a smart finish. Florenzi was sent off with 12 minutes left for a frustrated spear tackle from behind on Marc Cucurella before Mata made it three. Villarreal were held to a 1-1 draw by Real Valladolid as well-travelled French forward Hartem Ben Arfa made his debut as a second-half substitute."
11,07/02/2020,14:25,Basque rivals Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad kept apart in Copa semis,Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad were kept apart in the draw for the Copa del Rey semi-finals on Friday after the Basque rivals beat Barcelona and Real Madrid in the quarters.,"Bilbao will face Granada and La Real will take on Segunda side Mirandes over two legs, keeping alive the chance of a first Copa del Rey final between the Basque teams since 1910. Mirandes have reached the last four after knocking out three La Liga sides in Villarreal, Sevilla and Celta Vigo. But Real Sociedad will be strong favourites to end their fairytale run after they beat Real Madrid 4-3 in a seven-goal thriller at the Santiago Bernabeu on Thursday night. Bilbao then stunned Barcelona as Inaki Williams' 94th-minute header sent them through with a 1-0 win at San Mames. Granada, who sit 10th in La Liga, had already ended Valencia's hopes of retaining the title by winning 2-1 on Tuesday thanks to a Roberto Soldado double. The Copa del Rey's new format, which includes lower teams playing at home and single legs, has seen a string of upsets and left an unfamiliar quartet in sight of the trophy. Real Sociedad are the most recent winners of Spain's domestic cup, having lifted it in 1987. Bilbao last won the tournament in 1984. Granada's best is reaching the final in 1959 while this is only the second time Mirandes have made the semis in their history. The first legs are scheduled for February 12, with the return legs coming almost a month later on March 4."
12,20/01/2020,00:12,Relief for Barca as Messi ensures Setien enjoys winning start,Quique Setien may want a different Barcelona but he needed the same old Lionel Messi on Sunday as the Argentinian gave his new coach a winning start by scoring in a 1-0 victory over Granada.,"Messi's strike in the 76th minute decided a cagey contest at the Camp Nou and prevented the much-anticipated launch of Setien's new era becoming something of a damp squib. Victory also sends Barca back to the top of La Liga on goal difference, after Real Madrid had briefly claimed first place following their win over Sevilla on Saturday. ""I have seen many things from the team today that I want to see,"" said Setien. ""But I already saw some of them against Atletico (last weekend) because Barca has been doing great things for many years."" It would have been different if Granada's Yan Eteki hadn't struck the post with just over 20 minutes left or their central defender German Sanchez not been sent off for a needless second yellow card soon after. The extra man was the boost Barca needed and Messi duly poked home his 17th goal in 21 games this season following good work by Arturo Vidal, Antoine Griezmann and the 20-year-old Riqui Puig. All three had reasons to impress, particularly Puig, whose inclusion on the bench was an early indication of Setien's belief in youth. Puig's contribution after coming on should mean more opportunities are to come. Setien said last week that if he could make one guarantee, it was that Barcelona would play good football while he is in charge and although few could argue this was a transformative display following the sacking of Ernesto Valverde, there were certainly some encouraging signs. The passing was faster, the pressing higher and Messi spent most of the match playing down the middle, with Griezmann on the left and Ansu Fati, another youngster, on the right. Setien claimed on Saturday he would never go home happy after winning and playing badly but a 1-0 victory gets his tenure off to a positive start and, with Real Madrid showing no sign of stuttering, he could hardly afford anything less. His team had 83 per cent possession in the first half but chances were not as clear-cut and, as it was under Valverde, nearly everything went through Messi. His driving run teed up Fati, who shot over, and then a cutting reverse pass set Alba away but Fati failed to finish at the back post. Messi won the ball back on the ground and then nipped past two players. He flashed wide at the end of a fluid team move and missed from two free-kicks. Barca were slick, evidently trying to pass faster and press with more aggression. Messi and Sergio Busquets chased and Griezmann did too, at one point earning the approval of the home fans after sprinting to provide cover at right-back. Vidal has always harried and when he won the ball back early in the second half, Barca had a four against two. But Messi's pass was heavy and the angle for Vidal became too acute. The game drifted and tension grew but two moments proved crucial. First Eteki's shot was kept out only by the post as he drove hard past the right hand of Ter Stegen. Then, less than five minutes later, Granada were reduced to 10 men after German picked up a second yellow card for a late hack on Messi. It left Granada needing to survive 21 minutes and they only made it through eight. Puig, on for Ivan Rakitic, recovered possession in the corner before Messi picked up the ball centrally. In a flash, he played in Griezmann, who found Vidal, whose swivelled a flick back into the path of Messi and he poked a finish into the corner. Setien threw both arms into the air and looked to the sky, with joy and also relief. Earlier, two challengers for the top four stumbled as Valencia were thrashed 4-1 away at Real Mallorca and Real Sociedad beaten 3-0 by Real Betis. After Sevilla and Atletico Madrid both lost on Saturday, Real Madrid and Barcelona are now eight points clear of the chasing pack, in what looks increasingly like a two-horse race."
13,24/11/2019,00:13,Real and Barca battle back as Atletico lose ground at the top,Real Madrid and Barcelona both came from behind to seal victories that extended their advantage over the chasing pack at the top of La Liga on Saturday as Gareth Bale was jeered by his own fans at the Santiago Bernabeu.,"Barca needed a late winner from Arturo Vidal to beat bottom-club Leganes 2-1 after Luis Suarez headed home a Lionel Messi free-kick to cancel out a brilliant opener from Leganes forward Youssef En-Nesyri. Madrid were behind after 110 seconds against high-flying Real Sociedad but Karim Benzema scored his sixth goal in five games, before Fede Valverde and Luka Modric wrapped up a 3-1 win in the second half. It means Atletico Madrid lost further ground by being held to a 1-1 draw at Granada, with Real Sociedad remaining fifth, five points off the top. Sevilla, in fourth, play at Real Valladolid on Sunday. Madrid's comeback was overshadowed by the whistles for Bale after his controversial celebration following Wales' win over Hungary last week. He celebrated with a flag that read: ""Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order."" The fans jeered when his name was announced before kick-off and even louder when he came on as a substitute in the second half. ""I can't tell you it's fair or unfair,"" said Zidane after the match. ""But we need our fans to be with us. I can't control it, neither can Gareth or anyone. But Gareth came on and he played very well."" Without Bale, Benzema continued his excellent form with another goal and an assist for Modric late on. In between, Valverde gave Madrid the lead with a deflected shot from the edge of the area. Madrid's fans were also given the chance to see Martin Odegaard, their 20-year-old Norwegian loanee at Real Sociedad, who has been key to their strong start to the season. Odegaard impressed, with one through ball in the first half even drawing gasps of approval from the home support. Barcelona's gritty victory will come as a relief to coach Ernesto Valverde too ahead of a testing month for his side. They play Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday in the Champions League and a goalless draw against Slavia Prague earlier this month means qualification from Group F is no longer guaranteed. After Dortmund, Barca then play at Atletico in La Liga to start a month that will include trips to Inter Milan in the Champions League and Real Sociedad in La Liga before the season's first Clasico. ""It was a big win because the game was very difficult,"" Valverde said. ""The pitch was dreadful, there was a lot of wind and they scored early. ""I don't want it to sound like an excuse but it made it hard and still we were able to win."" The home side made the perfect start as En-Nesyri beat Gerard Pique with a wonderful early strike. Pique has spent the international break juggling football with the Davis Cup, the revamped tennis tournament in Madrid that he is organising through his marketing company. ""There is more noise outside the club than inside,"" said Pique after the match. ""I think it's got a bit out of hand -- whether I'm in Madrid, eating here, having dinner there -- it's all part of the circus. But I do my job. I come here, I play football. And that's it."" One pass from Roque Mesa was enough to set En-Nesyri free against the 32-year-old in the 12th minute. Pique jostled but was taken by surprise as En-Nesyri nipped inside and bent a shot into the far corner. Suarez went close, Pique hit the post and Suarez did find the net, glancing in Messi's clipped free-kick for his ninth goal of the season. Barca's second owed much to luck but it came from another cross. Pique rose to head in but the ball missed him and cannoned off the foot of Ruben Perez. Vidal was waiting on the line to prod in. Atletico were unable to find a winner as they played out their seventh draw of the season, the joint most in the division. Ronan Lodi scored his first La Liga goal after being slipped though by Hector Herrera but Herrera was at fault for the equaliser, losing his marker as German Sanchez powered in a superb header to earn Granada a point."
14,27/10/2019,16:55,Granada go top in Spain after edging past Betis,Granada moved to the top of La Liga on Sunday with a 1-0 victory over Real Betis while Sevilla and Real Sociedad joined a group of four teams just a point behind the surprise leaders.,"Alvaro Vadillo's smart finish in the 61st minute was enough to give Granada a sixth win of the season and take advantage of Barcelona not playing this week to take first place, while fellow Andalusians Betis stay in the relegation zone. The win was also their third in their last four matches, all of which have been single-goal victories. Vadillo's strike was his second of the season after he scored the second in his side's shock 2-0 win over Barca last month. The four sides trailing Granada are led by Barca, who did not play this weekend after their 'El Clasico' against Real Madrid was postponed amid mass protests in Catalonia. Real Sociedad meanwhile are third after winning 1-0 at Celta Vigo earlier on Sunday thanks to Swedish substitute Alexander Isak scoring the only goal with eight minutes left. Sevilla joined the pair and Atletico Madrid, who are in fourth after beating Athletic Bilbao 2-0 on Saturday night, on 19 points thanks to a 2-0 home win over Getafe that gave them their third straight win in all competitions. Javier Hernandez got the ball rolling in the 69th minute with his first league goal for his new club when he latched on to Franco Vazquez's through ball and slammed home a powerful finish. Nine minutes later Lucas Ocampos sealed the three points, assisted by a huge gap in the Getafe defence and Jesus Navas' through ball, which left him with the easy task of rounding David Soria and rolling home his third of the season. Real Madrid are a point further back having also played a game less than their rivals after the cancellation of their clash with fierce rivals Barca, whose Catalonia region has been struck by a wave of demonstrations following the jailing of nine regional leaders. On Sunday tens of thousands of people marched for Spanish unity in Barcelona, a day after 350,000 Catalan separatists held a protest. The match has been rescheduled for December 18 but on Thursday La Liga revealed they will appeal the Spanish Football Federation's decision, saying that they want the match played two weeks before on December 4. They cited among the reasons for their appeal that the league holds the responsibility for setting dates due to broadcasting considerations, while December 18 also clashes with the Copa del Rey."
15,05/10/2019,18:24,Hazard off mark but Real make hard work of Granada,Eden Hazard ended the wait for his first Real Madrid goal but his team had to resist a spirited second-half comeback from Granada to seal a thrilling 4-2 victory in La Liga on Saturday.,"Karim Benzema put Real ahead in the second minute at the Santiago Bernabeu before Hazard opened his account with a delightful lifted finish towards the end of the first half. Luka Modric's bending long-range effort on the hour looked to have confirmed the win but Granada scored twice in quick succession through Darwin Machis and Domingos Duarte, the first from the penalty spot, to set up a tense last 12 minutes. James Rodriguez, on as a substitute, ended the rally by scoring his first goal since May 2017 in injury-time to wrap up an unexpectedly dramatic contest between the league's top two. Granada stay second, for now, after suffering only their second defeat of the season. Madrid had been in complete control, their fluency and tempo contributing to arguably the best hour of football they have played this season. Yet a hectic 20-minute period in the second half took some of the gloss off a performance that at least gets Zinedine Zidane's side back to winning ways following their 2-2 draw at home to Club Brugge in the Champions League on Tuesday. Hazard had become a growing concern after five underwhelming matches, the patience granted to him after his injury in pre-season beginning to run out after his 100 million euros ($109 million) move from Chelsea. The Belgian still looks some way short of his best but his goal here was timely, not just for him but also Real, who will go into international break top of the table, despite their own bumpy start to the season. Toni Kroos walked off injured in the first half to be replaced by Modric, which will be a worry for Germany, who play Argentina in a friendly on Wednesday. Gareth Bale returned after being rested against Brugge while Alphonse Areola came in for the ill Thibaut Courtois in goal. Areola's mistake gave away the penalty, and perhaps any hopes he had of keeping Courtois out longer-term. Madrid conceded after 122 seconds on Tuesday but needed only 102 to take the lead here. Playing on the right, Bale often makes use of the outside of his left foot and the bend he created to bypass two Granada defenders and find Benzema at the backpost was superb. Benzema could not miss. Madrid created several early chances. A slick move down the left between Bale, Benzema and Dani Carvajal saw the latter go clear while Benzema and the impressive Fede Valverde both went close too. Bale was first to congratulate Hazard when he scored shortly before half-time but Valverde created it, driving past two Granada midfielders before intercepting Duarte's header and poking the ball through. Hazard finished just in time, lifting it coolly into the net. The second half grew increasingly bad-tempered, broken up by late tackles and complaints to the referee. Yet when Modric collected Hazard's pass on the hour, after another Valverde chase, and found the top corner, the game looked finished. Instead, Granada were given a lifeline. Areola had just failed to claim a cross when moments later he dallied in his box and caught Carlos Fernandez in a rushed attempt to clear. Darwin Machis scored the penalty and with 12 minutes left, they made it 3-2, Victor Diaz heading to the back post where Duarte prodded in. Madrid were suddenly alive to the unexpected threat and Benzema should have made it four in the 86th minute but his shot was saved. James did, a quick break ending with Alvaro Odriozola finding him with the pull-back. The relief was palpbale."
16,04/10/2019,17:06,Marcelo to miss Real's table-top clash with Granada,"Left-back Marcelo will miss league leaders Real Madrid's La Liga match against second-placed Granada this weekend due to a leg injury, the Spanish giants said on Friday.","Brazilian Marcelo, 31, only made his return from a neck injury in Tuesday's 2-2 draw with Club Brugge having missed four games earlier in the season. The announcement leaves coach Zinedine Zidane without a recognised left-back for Saturday's league fixture with France defender Ferland Mendy suffering from a calf problem."
17,04/10/2019,02:40,Rollercoaster start leaves La Liga awaiting serious contenders,Real Madrid have hardly got going and Granada have just arrived but La Liga's chaotic opening few weeks means they face each other in an unlikely battle of first against second on Saturday.,"By the end of the eighth round in Spain, seven teams could potentially go into the international break at the top of the table, with Athletic Bilbao in seventh, only three points behind Madrid at the summit. In between, Barcelona sit fourth and Sevilla sixth, with those two also up against each other at Camp Nou on Sunday. Atletico Madrid and Real Sociedad complete the group of early front-runners. None have truly convinced after a merry-go-round of results against each other that leaves few patterns and many doubts. Madrid beat Sevilla but were held by Atletico while Granada beat Barcelona but lost to Sevilla. Real Sociedad beat Atletico but lost to Bilbao and Sevilla, who beat Granada and la Real but lost to Real Madrid. Bilbao, who visit Celta Vigo on Sunday, have not lost to any of the leading seven while Barcelona and Atletico, last season's champions and runners-up, have not beaten any of them. ""La Liga is complicated for everyone right now,"" said Atletico coach Diego Simeone last month. ""Everyone is trying to build some momentum."" After two years of domestic disappointment, Zinedine Zidane said in April the league would be Madrid's priority this season and they remain unbeaten, approaching Granada and have three consecutive clean sheets in the league. Yet aside from an excellent win away at Sevilla last month, Zidane's team have looked laboured, particularly at the Santiago Bernabeu, where the tension and frustration in the stands has regularly taken hold on the pitch. Eden Hazard has been sluggish and the midfield stodgy. Thibaut Courtois in goal was whistled on Tuesday, his popularity with the fans still to be established. ""Criticism doesn't affect me,"" Hazard said on Monday. ""I've never taken notice of it. Everyone expects me to score three goals in every game but you have to wait a bit, I've had an injury. Goals will come."" Madrid were held 2-2 by Club Brugge in the Champions League in midweek. If Granada were watching, they may have concluded there is little to fear this weekend. Promoted after finishing second in Segunda last term, Diego Martinez's side have made a remarkable start, even if their coach feigns ignorance about their heady place in the table. ""We are not interested,"" he said last month. ""I don't look at the table. In May, I will."" By then, few would expect Granada still to be among the leading pack. Sevilla and Athletic Bilbao look better equipped to last the distance and replace Valencia in the top four. Sevilla made 12 signings in the summer but have gelled quickly under Julen Lopetegui, even if their thrilling 3-2 victory over Real Sociedad last weekend was as nervy as it was needed following two consecutive defeats. Lopetegui knows better than most the fragility of strong starts. His Real Madrid side won four of their opening five league games last term before they lost form and he lost his job. In that way, hopes for an open title race may also be premature. At this stage 12 months ago, there were also three points between first and seventh. Barcelona led but were only one point better off than they are now. They went on to win the title by 11 points. Ernesto Valverde will be counting on a similar gathering of momentum after Barca made it three wins out of three by beating an impressive Inter Milan side on Wednesday, with a fit-again Lionel Messi back in the fold. After the game, Messi dismissed talk of rifts between the players and board while admitting in almost the same breath that the club's pre-season tours had hampered, not helped, the team's preparations. ""But I have no doubt we are going to get better,"" said Messi."
18,20/09/2019,02:25,Sevilla await weakened Real Madrid at Liga summit,Both Barcelona and Real Madrid travel to Andalusia this weekend in search of precious Liga points after stuttering form in Europe and in their domestic campaigns as table-toppers Sevilla await Zinedine Zidane's injury-stricken outfit.,"Real, thrashed in the Champions League by PSG midweek, face a daunting challenge to regroup at Sevilla, while Barcelona go to an unlikely mountain stronghold to face plucky Granada. Led by Julen Lopetegui, sacked by Spain on the eve of last year's World Cup for accepting a job at Real, the coach will have extra motivation to prove himself after flopping in the Madrid hot-seat. His current charges are on ten points from four matches, but Real can climb above them Sunday with an away win. ""Being top means nothing,"" Lopetegui said last week. ""But it does tell us the team is doing things well."" Sevilla did well again in the Europa League on Thursday coming back from a marathon trip to Baku with a 3-0 win at Qarabag. Real have lost on their last four visits to the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, and on six of their last seven trips there. Big-money signing Eden Hazard struggled on his first start for Real on Wednesday as the team failed to muster a single effort on target despite presence of Karim Benzema, James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale. ""It's complicated if you are not strong and don't get into the rhythm,"" said Zidane, under mounting pressure in his second spell at the club. Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois immediately turned his attentions on their trip to Seville. ""We're all in the same boat. We sink or swim together and we have a big match on Sunday, and that is what we need to focus on,"" said Courtois. ""We need to forget this defeat, it is hard but we have another game on Sunday and we need to focus on that,"" added Zidane. It may be stretching it to say his position is under threat at the moment, but another defeat this weekend might change that, and a derby away to Atletico awaits a week later. Lionel Messi is in line for his first league start of the season after he came on late at Borussia Dortmund in Europe in midweek. The Argentine wizard, who mised the beginning of the campaign with a calf injury, was unable to lift his team past the Germans, who held on for a 0-0 draw in their Champions League opener. Barca fans will hope his partnership with new signing Antoine Griezmann and Luis Suarez can revive memories of the fearsome attacking trident that lost much of its lustre following the 2017 sale of Neymar. With their stadium nestled in the Sierra Nevada not far from the ancient Alhambra fortress promoted, Granada are punching above their weight this season as their coach Diego Martinez admitted after last week's win at Celta Vigo. ""If you had told me when the calendar came out we'd have seven points already, I'd have thought you very optimistic,"" he said. 7 - After a determined comeback to draw 2-2 with Juventus in midweek, second-placed Atletico Madrid host Celta. Diego Simeone's men are unbeaten in seven home games with Saturday's opponents since the Argentine took charge. 7 - The number of goals scored by Sergio Ramos against Sevilla. The Madrid central defender has struck more often against his former club than any other side. Fixtures (all times GMT)"

The 21-year-old Venezuela international played in La Liga last season on a loan spell for Huesca, who were relegated at the end of the campaign. Herrera played for his country in the recently concluded Copa America and also featured in the side's failed bid to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. He joined City's youth academy in 2017 from Atletico Venezuela and was promptly loaned out to Major League Soccer club New York City FC for a season prior to his movbe to Huesca."
20,16/04/2017,22:48,Adams slumps to heavy home defeat on Granada bow,Granada's slim hopes of launching a bid for La Liga survival under Tony Adams were further diminished as an under-strength Celta Vigo ran out 3-0 away winners on Sunday.,"Former Arsenal and England captain Adams took temporary charge until the end of the season earlier this week having previously worked at Granada as an adviser to Chinese owner Jiang Lizhang. Granada remain seven points off safety with just six games remaining. Adams named a side of 11 different nationalities and without a single Spaniard in his starting line-up at Nuevo Los Carmenes stadium. But Granada rarely threatened a much-changed Celta side, with one eye on the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final against Genk, and Jozabed opened the scoring midway through the first half. Marcelo Diaz's fine free-kick doubled Celta's lead 17 minutes from time before Claudio Beauvue added a third after Theo Bongonda's effort came back off the post. At the other end of the table fourth-placed Sevilla's slump in form continued but they were grateful to escape with a point from a 0-0 draw at Valencia. Valencia were denied a fourth consecutive win as Italian striker Simone Zaza had a goal ruled out for handball 17 minutes from time. Sevilla's best effort saw Stevan Jovetic hit the post early on, but Jorge Sampaoli's men have now won just one of their last eight games in all competitions. A point means Sevilla trail Atletico Madrid by three points in the battle for automatic Champions League qualification in third. However, they enjoy a comfortable eight-point lead over fifth-placed Villarreal, who travel to Alaves on Monday. Leganes remain just five points above the relegation zone after Leo Baptistao struck in stoppage time to hand Espanyol a 1-0 win. Eibar's quest to qualify for Europe for the first time faltered as they lost 2-0 at Real Betis."

Watford chief executive Scott Duxbury said on the club's website: ""The opportunity to sign Abdoulaye Doucoure now was one we wanted to act upon, given our long-standing interest in the player. ""He is very much part of Watford's future plans, and in the time between now and pre-season he'll be experiencing high-level competitive football in Spain.""

24,19/09/2015,17:56,Benzema goal edges Real Madrid past Granada,A solitary goal from Karim Benzema spared Real Madrid's blushes as the Spanish giants moved to the top of La Liga with a nervy 1-0 win over Granada on Saturday.,"Real had scored 15 times in their previous three matches, but they were grateful to some poor Granada finishing and controversial calls by the officials to claim all three points. Benzema grabbed the only goal of the game nine minutes into the second-half with a cushioned header from Isco's fine cross. Victory moves Madrid a point ahead of Barcelona at the top of the table with the Catalans not in action until Sunday when they host Levante. The scene appeared to be set at a sunny Bernabeu for Ronaldo to surpass Raul to become Madrid's all-time to goalscorer. There was even a special introduction for the World Player of the Year as his mascot for the day was Zaid Mohsen, the seven-year-old Syrian refugee made famous when he and his father were tripped by a Hungarian camerawoman. However, the script wasn't followed once the action got underway as Granada passed up a host of chances to spring a massive surprise. Marcelo was forced into a clearance off the Real goal line early on before Isaac Success fluffed his first of a number of opportunities when he failed to hit the target when unmarked at the back post. Ronaldo's first opening came 18 minutes in, but Andres Fernandez stood up well to block his effort before Benzema failed to turn the rebound home. Youssef El-Arabi did have the ball in the net for Granada moments later, but was wrongly ruled to have been offside. Fernandez made further good saves from Luka Modric, Ronaldo and Lucas Vazquez to keep Rafael Benitez's men at bay. Yet, Success had two more great chances to put Granada in front just before and after the break as he was denied by brave save from Keylor Navas before chipping the ball well over with his second effort. The Andalusians were eventually made to pay for their profligacy when Isco's perfect cross picked out Benzema for a simple header to open the scoring. El-Arabi should still have given Granada a share of the points, but he too couldn' find a way past Navas at the end of a final individual run as the Costa Rica international stretched his unbeaten streak to start the season to five games."
25,05/04/2015,14:48,Ronaldo hits five in nine-goal Real rout,Cristiano Ronaldo's first ever five goal haul in the one match saw Real Madrid move to within a point of Barcelona at the top of La Liga with a stunning 9-1 thrashing of Granada on Sunday.,"Gareth Bale continued his fine form after bagging a brace for Wales last weekend by opening the scoring after 25 minutes. Ronaldo then took over as he scored three times in eight minutes just after the half hour mark. Karim Benzema struck twice either side of Ronaldo's fourth as Real added three more in a four-minute spell just after the break. Robert Ibanez grabbed a consolation for the visitors, but Diego Mainz's own goal made it 8-1 before Ronaldo rounded off the scoring with a towering header. Meanwhile, Valencia's outside hopes of a late title challenge were dented as they remain in fourth, seven points off the top, after a 0-0 draw at home to Villarreal. Barca can restore their four-point lead when they visit Celta Vigo later on Sunday. ""Happy to have scored five goals with this excellent team work. Thank you for all your support,"" Ronaldo posted on his official Twitter account. Ronaldo's quintuple takes him four clear of Lionel Messi in the race to be La Liga's top goalscorer. ""Cristiano has improved as the team has,"" said Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti. ""What more can I say about him? It is the first time he has scored five goals with Real Madrid which is great for him and for us looking forward to the next game."" Chances soon began to flow for Madrid and Bale was first to capitalise when he latched onto Toni Kroos's through ball to round Oier Olazabal and slot home from a narrow angle. James Rodriguez made his return after two months out with a foot injury and sealed his comeback with a lovely assist with the outside of his left foot to allow Ronaldo to curl home his first of the afternoon. The Portuguese soon made it 3-0 by lashing home from close range after Olazabal had spilled a cross and he sealed an eight-minute hat-trick with some more help from the Granada 'keeper as he couldn't keep out the World Player of the Year's drive from 20 yards. Granada offered embarrassingly little resistance after the break as Benzema was given plenty of time to control a corner from the left and fire home to make it 5-0. Bale then unselfishly teed up Ronaldo to nod home his 46th goal of the season, although there was a brief scare for the home fans as Ronaldo collided with the frame of the goal in doing so but was soon back on his feet. More shocking defending from Granada allowed Benzema to saunter through for a seventh barely 60 seconds later. Granada pulled a goal back when Ibanez burst clear of Raphael Varane to slot past Casillas, but their miserable day was rounded off when Mainz could only turn Javier Hernandez's cross into his own net. And fittingly Ronaldo had the final word when he rose highest to power Luka Modric's free-kick in at the far post."

Caparros took over the reins at the beginning of the season, having previously coached Villarreal, Sevilla and Athletic Bilbao amongst other clubs in Spain and Switzerland. Granada are second from bottom in La Liga after 18 matches. Former goalkeeper and coach Abel Resino has been named by Spanish media as the favourite to succeed Caparros."
27,01/11/2014,18:04,Freescoring Real Madrid move top of La Liga,"Real Madrid moved to the top of La Liga for the first time this season as goals from Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and a James Rodriguez double handed them a 4-0 win at Granada.","It took Ronaldo just 100 seconds to register his 22nd goal of the season when he swept home Benzema's cut-back to punish some lax Granada defending. There was nothing the hosts could do as Rodriguez doubled Madrid's lead nine minutes before half-time, though, as the Colombian unleashed a sumptuous dipping volley into the far corner. Ronaldo returned the favour to Benzema as he slotted home the third early in the second-half before Rodriguez forced home his second of the afternoon from close range four minutes from time. Victory takes Madrid two points clear of Barcelona, but the Catalans can reclaim top spot when they host Celta Vigo later on Saturday. Carlo Ancelotti's men were full of confidence after inflicting Barca's first league defeat of the season last weekend and went in front with their first attack as Dani Carvajal robbed Jeison Murillo and Benzema squared for Ronado to slot low past Roberto. Madrid threatened to run riot as Murillo blocked a goalbound shot from Benzema before Isco saw a dipping effort fly over. Carvajal then should have finished off a stunning move when he blazed over from close range. However, Rodriguez applied the quality finishing touch his teammates had been lacking with a stunning volley reminiscent of his strike against Uruguay on his way to becoming the top scorer at the World Cup. Despite Granada boss Joaquin Caparros's attempts to freshen up his side with the introduction of Javi Marquez and Youssef El-Arabi, the one way traffic continued after the break. A wonderful backheel from Ronaldo teed up Benzema to make it 3-0 with his ninth goal of the season nine minutes into the second-half. Marcelo then crashed an effort off the crossbar on his weaker right foot as the visitors continued the search for more goals. Yet, it was Granada who should have reduced the deficit when Ruben Rochina was left with the goal at his mercy but fired straight into the body of the prone Sergio Ramos. With an 11th consecutive victory in all competitions assured, Ancelotti could afford to withdraw Luka Modric and Isco with Tuesday's Champions League clash with Liverpool in mind. Right-back Carvajal is a doubt for that game as he limped off in the first-half to be replaced by Alvaro Arbeloa and the former Liverpool full-back should have scored a rare goal when his weak finish was turned behind by Roberto. Rodriguez did finally make it four when he bundled Ronaldo's wayward effort over the line late on."
