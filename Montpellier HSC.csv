0,23/01/2021,00:14,Neymar on target on 100th PSG appearance,Neymar made his 100th appearance for Paris Saint-Germain on Friday and marked the occasion with a goal in a 4-0 rout of 10-man Montpellier that took Mauricio Pochettino's side clear at the top of Ligue 1.,"Kylian Mbappe scored twice and Mauro Icardi was also on target with PSG leading 1-0 before netting three times in the space of four minutes around the hour mark. The game, played behind closed doors at the Parc des Princes, was conditioned by the early sending-off of Montpellier goalkeeper Jonas Omlin for a foul on Mbappe, as PSG made the most of their extra man. It was their fourth straight win since drawing at Saint-Etienne in Pochettino's first match in charge after the Argentine was appointed as coach on January 2. The former Tottenham Hotspur boss was back on the Paris bench having spent a week self-isolating following a positive Covid-19 test that forced him to miss his new team's 1-0 win at Angers last weekend. ""I feel good. I am happy to be back,"" he said. PSG are now three points clear of second-placed Lille, who go to in-form Rennes on Sunday. Lyon in third are five points behind the leaders before visiting derby rivals Saint-Etienne, who will be without seven players because of a coronavirus outbreak. The capital club's rivals may have their work cut out trying to overtake the reigning champions on this evidence, with the attacking quartet of Neymar, Mbappe, Icardi and Angel Di Maria running riot. Neymar's goal took his tally to 81 in 100 appearances for PSG since his world-record 222 million-euro ($264m) move from Barcelona in August 2017. His time in Paris has been marred by injuries at important moments but there can be no disputing his impressive record in front of goal as he prepares to face his old club in the last 16 of the Champions League next month. Mbappe was more prominent in this game, however, as he scored his first goals of the Pochettino era. Pochettino said: ""I was already happy with Mbappe's performances before tonight. I am pleased that he scored because scoring goals is crucial for a striker's confidence. But we knew it was only a matter of time."" The France World Cup-winning star was scythed down just outside the box by Omlin in the 16th minute, with the Swiss goalkeeper initially shown a yellow card before the punishment was upgraded to red following a VAR review. PSG made the extra man count as Di Maria played in Mbappe to open the scoring with a dinked finish over substitute goalkeeper Dimitry Bertaud in the 34th minute. Pochettino lost goalkeeper Keylor Navas to injury at half-time, while captain Marquinhos was also forced off early in the second half. The coach later said he thought it was ""nothing serious"" for either player. Mbappe cut the ball back for Neymar to make it 2-0 on the hour mark, before Icardi tucked in his third goal in four games. It was 4-0 in the 63rd minute when Icardi set up Ligue 1's leading scorer Mbappe to finish for his second of the night and 14th of the season. Layvin Kurzawa almost provided the cherry on top of the cake soon after, but his stunning overhead kick was tipped onto the crossbar by Bertaud."
1,06/12/2020,00:14,Mbappe brings up century as PSG win at Montpellier,Kylian Mbappe scored his 100th goal for Paris Saint-Germain after making a late appearance as a substitute for the Ligue 1 leaders in Saturday's 3-1 victory at in-form Montpellier.,"With Neymar preserved ahead of next week's crucial Champions League clash against Istanbul Basaksehir and Mbappe rested from the start, Colin Dagba's first career goal gave PSG the lead on 33 minutes. English forward Stephy Mavididi levelled before half-time at the Stade de la Mosson, the ball just crossing the line despite the best efforts of Dagba and Keylor Navas. Moise Kean restored the advantage for PSG on 77 minutes after Rafinha triggered a quick counter, hitting a magnificent solo goal for his fifth in seventh league games. The Italy international was then replaced by Mbappe, who wrapped up the victory in stoppage time as he brought up his century of goals in his 137th game for PSG, tapping in a Layvin Kurzawa cross. ""I've been wanting to score for a few matches, it's a bit of a release,"" Mbappe told Canal Plus. ""When I signed here I wouldn't even had thought of scoring three goals,"" he beamed. ""(A hundred) was part of a distant goal."" Mbappe is joint-fourth on the list of PSG's all-time top scorers, level with Dominique Rocheteau and trailing Pauleta (109), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (156) and Edinson Cavani (200). ""I'm feeling better and better, stringing matches together is going to allow me to get fully fit,"" he said. ""When I came here, I said that I wanted to get a lot better and you don't do that in a year. ""It's been three and a half years, I've experienced a lot of things here. I've had some less good moments, but the club has always supported me."" Defending champions PSG pulled four points clear of Marseille at the top as they avoided going three league games without victory for the first time since April 2019. Montpellier, without top scorer Andy Delort after he tested positive for coronavirus for the second time in three months, saw their hopes of dislodging the leaders dashed as their four-match winning run came to an end. Earlier, Rennes crashed to a sixth defeat in seven matches as they lost 2-0 at home to Lens, three days being dumped out of Europe. Teenage striker Arnaud Kalimuendo, on loan from PSG, hit the opener on 27 minutes and Ignatius Ganago sealed the victory late in the second half."

His career started as a 19-year-old with Auxerre, not far from where he was born and grew up. Apart from two seasons on loan at Nancy, he remained at Auxerre for 14 seasons before finishing his career at Montpellier. ""He was a true legend,"" Auxerre said of the keeper they rated with the country's best. He made 31 appearances for France including Euro '92 and a cameo on the bench at Euro '96. While major international honours alluded him he was a member of the France U-20 team that took the 1988 world title with Laurent Blanc and Eric Cantona. ""How sad, what a great man,"" said former player and manager Luis Fernandez who now works in sports radio. ""Football has lost someone with integrity, honesty and passion."" While his only club trophy was the 1994 French Cup with Auxerre he set a record for the longest run without conceding a goal: 892 minutes in the 1986-7 season. After hanging up his boots he was France goalkeeping coach, helping Les Bleus to the Euro 2000 title and to the final of the 2006 World Cup. He played chess and loved classical literature and music. ""Mozart, Wagner, Bach but, above all, Handel,"" he once said. His last role was coaching at Montpellier. ""We weep for one of our own,"" the club said. If he had succeeded in passing his high school diploma he could have become a sports instructor and may have slipped through the grasp of Guy Roux, Auxerre's iconic manager. jmc-eba/gf/jta//nr/ <org>LVMH - MOET HENNESSY LOUIS VUITTON</org> <org>BORUSSIA DORTMUND</org>"
3,16/10/2020,10:52,"Eight players from Ligue 1 Montpellier, four staff positive for Covid-19","Eight Montpellier players and four backroom staff have tested positive for Covid-19, the club said Friday, putting in doubt their weekend Ligue 1 game against Monaco.","The entire squad underwent further tests on Friday while the 12 who tested positive have been put in isolation, according to the club. Michel Der Zakarian's team, currently fifth in Ligue 1, are scheduled to play away at Monaco on Sunday. Since the coronavirus pandemic erupted, seven players at Montpellier tested positive. Midfielder Junior Sambia, who was hospitalised and put in an artificial coma in April, was the first known Ligue 1 player to have contracted the virus. The 24-year-old has recovered and has made several appearances for the team in the new season."
4,29/08/2020,23:11,Camavinga on the mark as Rennes collect first win,Rennes teenager Eduardo Camavinga celebrated his first France call-up with a terrific solo goal in Saturday's 2-1 victory at home to Montpellier in Ligue 1.,"Camavinga, 17, was included this week in Didier Deschamps' squad for Nations League games against Sweden and Croatia next month as a replacement for Paul Pogba who has tested positive for Covid-19. Julien Stephan's side will compete in the Champions League for the first time this season, and Angolan-born Camavinga has reiterated his commitment to the club despite reported interest from Real Madrid. Damien Le Tallec inadvertently gave Rennes the lead when he flicked Raphinha's cross into his own net on 22 minutes, with the visitors reduced to 10 men before half-time as Florent Mollet was dismissed after catching the head of Faitout Maouassa with his studs. Rennes hit the woodwork three times at Roazhon Park, twice through Adrien Hunou and again when Raphinha crashed a curling free-kick against the bar on the hour, with Montpellier's Arnaud Souquet hitting the upright at the other end. The hosts saw Martin Terrier sent off with 15 minutes left for a late tackle on Gaetan Laborde but Camavinga soon added a second, effortlessly gliding into the area and shaking free of his defender with a wonderful shimmy before driving low into the far corner. The masked Laborde, sporting protective headgear after breaking his nose in midweek, grabbed a consolation in stoppage time with a superb diving header but it could not deny Rennes a first win of the season. ""It's a well deserved victory but far too tight given the number of chances we had. The game should have been over at half-time,"" said Stephan. Patrick Vieira's Nice made it two wins from as many matches as Denmark international Kasper Dolberg netted both goals in a 2-0 victory at Strasbourg. Dolberg scored from the spot after a clumsy foul by Lamine Kone in the first half and then struck again on 59 minutes after latching onto Amine Gouiri's deflected ball through. Lyon beat Dijon 4-1 in their first game of the campaign on Friday, while Marseille are due to visit Brest on Sunday after their planned opener against Saint-Etienne last week was postponed after several players tested positive for coronavirus. Title holders Paris Saint-Germain's game at Lens initially scheduled for Saturday has been pushed back to September 10 following their run to Champions League final in Lisbon."
5,02/07/2020,11:56,Juventus' 'top quality' Mavididi joins Montpellier,Montpellier announced on Thursday they had signed English striker Stephy Mavididi from Juventus for a reported 6.3 million euros ($7.12million).,"Arsenal youth product Mavididi, 22, has signed a four-year deal with the French club after scoring eight goals in 28 games on loan at Ligue 1 side Dijon last season. Mavididi will join Michel Der Zakarian's attack which includes Africa Cup of Nations winner Andy Delort and Gaetan Laborde who were on the scoresheet 19 times across all competitions last season. ""It's a satisfaction to recruit of a top quality supplementary forward as the coach wanted. I hope our crack pair of forwards will become a good trio,"" president Laurent Nicollin said. The former England youth international will fill the gap left by veteran former Senegal forward Souleymane Camara who retired earlier this year. Montpellier finished eighth in the Ligue 1 table after the campaign was declared over due to the coronavirus pandemic and are also seeking to sign a goalkeeper to replace Geronimo Rulli who has returned to Real Sociedad after a loan spell at Stade de la Mosson."

""Is this the end of the end? We'll see,"" said club president Laurent Nicollin. ""We are delighted that he will continue the adventure with us for another year before we sell him to NASA so they can examine his body."" Hilton has played in France since 2004 and joined Montpellier from Marseille in 2011. ""I think it's going to be the last one, so for me it's the best one of all,"" Hilton said of his contract. ""It's even more than a dream."" ""To have the opportunity to play at the top level at 43 is exceptional for me. I'm going to make the most of it."" Hilton has played 483 matches in Ligue 1, some way short of the record of 586 for an outfield player set by Alain Giresse. Hilton has won league titles with Marseille in 2010 and with Montpellier in 2012. Montpellier were eighth in Ligue 1 when the season was ended by the coronavirus pandemic, and Hilton had played 33 times in all competitions."

We hope to see you very soon on the pitch,"" the club tweeted. The 23-year-old French player was last week admitted to a Montpellier hospital, where he was diagnosed with coronavirus and provisionally put into an artificial coma. While Sambia was the first Ligue 1 player affected by COVID-19, South Korean Hyun-jun Suk, who plays for Troyes in the second division, was the first professional player in France officially diagnosed with the virus. The pandemic has stopped French football, with 10 rounds of matches of the season left."
8,08/03/2020,23:44,Lille keep pressure on Rennes in Champions League race,Rennes shook off their painful midweek French Cup semi-final exit to thrash Montpellier 5-0 in Ligue 1 on Sunday and maintain their one-point lead over Lille in the race for France's third and final Champions League spot.,"Last season's Ligue 1 runners-up Lille kept the pressure on with a 1-0 win over Lyon. Rennes left-back Faitout Maouassa struck the opener inside 10 minutes at Roazhon Park and Adrien Hunou doubled the lead for Rennes, whose French Cup title defence was ended Thursday by a 2-1 loss to Saint-Etienne. Flavien Tait added a third for Rennes on 68 minutes before Romain Del Castillo converted a penalty. Hunou grabbed his second of the match from the spot late on to complete the rout. Lille edged out in-form Lyon thanks to a first-half goal from Loic Remy. The former Chelsea and Newcastle striker has now scored 11 goals in his last 18 appearances, having scored only three goals before that this season. ""We will continue our journey, our path,"" said Lille coach Christophe Galtier. ""It (the last part of the season) is a sprint and every match is going to be a fight."" Paris Saint-Germain's game at Strasbourg on Saturday was postponed due to fears over the coronavirus outbreak. The decision was made after a number of people tested positive for COVID-19 in the Haut-Rhin region, which neighbours the Bas-Rhin region where Strasbourg is located. It was the first Ligue 1 match to be called off because of the virus, which has infected 1,126 people in France and caused 19 deaths."
9,01/02/2020,19:55,"PSG win big again, but superstars Neymar and Mbappe leave Tuchel irritated","Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel admitted Neymar's latest lavish birthday celebrations were a ""distraction"" at a key time in the season after the Brazilian helped the Ligue 1 leaders to a 5-0 win over nine-man Montpellier on Saturday.","Neymar, with his hair dyed pink, shook off an injury scare and raged with the match officials while Pablo Sarabia, Angel Di Maria, Kylian Mbappe and Layvin Kurzawa all scored along with a Daniel Congre own goal as PSG went 13 points clear of Marseille at the top of the table. On Sunday, the Brazilian is set to host a lavish party for his 28th birthday at a Parisian nightclub, despite his team playing again on Tuesday against Nantes. ""It's a distraction, that's clear,"" said Tuchel. ""I always want to protect my players, and if there are difficult things to talk about I prefer to say them internally. ""These are distractions, and they give the impression we are not serious, not professional. But I don't really want to talk about it because then these things become big issues."" Neymar warmed up with a shirt bearing the name of Kobe Bryant and the number 24 of the basketball star who was killed in a helicopter crash last weekend. While Neymar didn't score, having to settle just for one assist, he produced his usual tricks, provoked the opposition, and required lengthy treatment at the end of the first half after appearing to hurt his ribs as he grappled for the ball with Montpellier's Arnaud Souquet. Unhappy with the some of the treatment reserved for him, Neymar was booked for dissent in the first half and was then caught by television cameras angrily remonstrating in Portuguese with the fourth official in the tunnel at half-time. Tuchel was also forced to answer questions about Mbappe's angry reaction to being taken off midway through the second half, as Edinson Cavani came on for a first appearance since a January move to Atletico Madrid fell through. ""It doesn't look good, but we are not the only club where players react like that,"" the coach said. ""This team shows how professional and focused they are every day, but this gives the impression it's not always like that and I'm sad because it's not necessary. ""I explained to him why he came off and that will be that. I always make decisions for sporting reasons. This is football, not tennis, and you have to respect everyone."" Sarabia was selected ahead of Mauro Icardi and Cavani to start with Mbappe up front, and the former Real Madrid player curled home a fine opener from 22 yards in the eighth minute for his 10th goal of the season. Montpellier's hopes of getting back into the game were then as good as over when goalkeeper Dimitry Bertaud was sent off in the 17th minute for coming out of his box to stop Mbappe bearing down on goal, only to block the ball with his arm and receive a straight red. On came young debutant goalkeeper Matis Carvalho and he had to pick the ball out of his net twice before the interval. Di Maria lifted the ball over him and in to make it 2-0 in the 41st minute, and shortly afterwards Teji Savanier's attempt to clear a Di Maria corner rebounded off the face of defender Congre and in. After Neymar cooled down at the break, he set up Mbappe to round Carvalho and score his 14th league goal of the season. Kurzawa drilled in the fifth in the 65th minute, and the visitors were reduced to nine men late on as substitute Joris Chotard saw two quick yellow cards. Marseille go to Bordeaux on Sunday looking for a first win there in 43 years, while Rennes strengthened their grip on third by scoring twice in injury time to claim a 3-2 win over local rivals Nantes on Friday."
10,31/01/2020,03:06,Untiring veteran Hilton ready for Neymar clash and determined to keep going,"Most footballers his age have long since hung up their boots, perhaps moved into management or punditry. But Vitorino Hilton, who turns 43 later this year, is still going strong.","Almost exactly 16 years after he first arrived in France, the Brazilian centre-back is set to lead out Montpellier on Saturday as they take on the Paris Saint-Germain of Neymar. They may be compatriots, but the difference between the world's most expensive player and Hilton is so great they might as well come from separate planets. Neymar missed PSG's midweek game in the French Cup, taking time off to as plan his 28th birthday celebrations, reportedly set for a 800-capacity Parisian nightclub on Sunday, with guests asked to dress all in white. Hilton, meanwhile, captained a Montpellier side that was dumped out of the Cup in the last 16, losing on penalties to fourth-tier minnows Belfort. Hilton has played almost every minute in the league for his club this season and shows no signs of slowing up. He wants to sign a new contract when his existing deal expires in the summer. ""I have played almost every match so far. I feel great. I want to continue for another year. We will see at the end of the season,"" he said on Thursday. A title winner with Marseille in 2010 and with Montpellier in 2012, Hilton is part of a side sitting fourth in Ligue 1 and hoping to qualify for Europe. Montpellier have won their last three league games, but it does not come tougher than a visit to Paris. Thomas Tuchel's side are unbeaten in their last 18 games and sit 10 points clear at the top of the table. And there is Neymar, whose brace in last weekend's win at Lille gave him 47 goals in 50 Ligue 1 appearances. ""He is unpredictable with, and without, the ball. You don't know what he's going to do,"" said Hilton. ""Playing against Paris is unpredictable too, but we have a good team and there are reasons for us to be hopeful. If we do all we need to do together I think we can get at least a draw."" Can the former Arsenal, Barcelona and Chelsea man still deliver at the highest level, or is he past it? While the Spanish star's quality on the ball remains undimmed, does he really have the physical attributes required by a midfielder in Ligue 1? Ex-Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim was not convinced, but new boss Robert Moreno -- who originates from Catalunya like Fabregas -- has started his compatriot in all three Ligue 1 games since taking over. However, the midweek signings of promising young midfielders Aurelien Tchouameni and Youssouf Fofana, from Bordeaux and Strasbourg, show that the principality club know changes are required. It will be interesting to see if Fabregas, 32, starts on Saturday as 13th-placed Monaco go to Nimes. 43 - The number of years since Marseille won a league game away to Bordeaux. OM have failed to win in 34 attempts in this fixture since a 2-1 success in October 1977, 18 days after Vitorino Hilton was born. 12 - The number of consecutive defeats losses by Toulouse, with 10 of them coming in the league. They are rock bottom. 11 - It is 11 years since Rennes had so many points (37) at this stage of the season. They are third going into Friday's derby against Nantes. Will they go on to qualify for the Champions League for the first time?"

PSG coach Thomas Tuchel can also go on holiday relaxed with his club on 47 points, as second-placed Lille, 13 points adrift, lost 2-1 at home to Toulouse. ""I'm very happy because we can see the progress of the team,"" said Tuchel. ""You can feel the energy, it's a good thing to build on next year."" With Neymar away, Angel Di Maria was in the line-up and came closest to making it 2-0, forcing a fine save from Nantes goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu, who then watched the Argentine hit the crossbar from the rebound. Meanwhile, third-placed Lyon drew 1-1 at fourth-placed Montpellier after opening the scoring thanks to their captain Nabil Fekir before a great header from Ruben Aguilar gave the surprise-package southerners a share of the spoils. Henry's Monaco were dreadful and the former Arsenal striker spat on the ground after Nolan Roux of Guingamp made fools of the Monaco defence to make it 2-0. ""I'm not going to have a good holiday,"" bemoaned Henry. ""Now you have to work and make do with what you have. ""It's necessary to work and work. There are still a lot of points to play for and that's the only positive thing about this evening."" Monaco were champions in 2017 but now have 13 points from 18 matches, just two more than Guingamp, and vice-president Vadim Vasilyev said the club needs to dip into the January transfer market. ""Until tonight, I thought we didn't need new players, but we do,"" Vasilyev told Canal+. ""It's difficult to analyse right now as I'm upset like the supporters. I understand the disappointment, it's up to us to act and draw the right conclusions."" Strasbourg paid hommage to the victims of a terror attack that killed five people on December 11 in their first home game since as they won 2-0 against Nice. Meanwhile, Marseille, in sixth, drew 1-1 at Angers and fifth-placed Saint-Etienne beat Dijon 3-0."

Both teams also had their matches called off last week, ahead of a weekend of ""yellow vest"" anti-government protests in France that descended into violence in Paris and several other cities. LFP said it would reschedule the other match, between Nantes, scene of violent demonstrations last weekend, and Montpellier, at a later date. The league said it had taken the decision ""because of current events and the assignment of the police on other missions"". Last Saturday, protests in Nanted by nearly 3,000 people resulted in 13 arrests and injuries to five police officers and three protesters. Last weekend, six Ligue 1 matches were postponed at the request of local authorities. They are due to be played in midweek on January 15 and 16. In addition to possible protests, the government have increased security levels following a deadly attack on the Christmas Market in Strasbourg on Tuesday."

Monaco remain mired in 19th place in the 20-team division. Last weekend Henry eked out his first victory as Monaco manager at Caen, but on Wednesday his side lost away to Atletico Madrid, a defeat that ensured they will finish last in their Champions League group. Against Montpellier, Monaco had a chance to double their lead in the 54th minute when Tielemans, faced with an open goal, passed to Aleksandr Golovin, who hit the bar. After that the visitors took control ""You've got to shoot into the empty net,"" said Henry after the match. Asked if the match was a disaster, Henry answer: ""Yes!"" ""We talk about the fear of losing, but the fear of winning also exists,"" he said. ""We gave a good performance for 54 minutes....but that's not enough."" The victory lifts Montpellier to second. They are 13 points behind Paris Saint-Germain, who round off the weekend's matches in Bordeaux on Sunday evening, but are just one point ahead of Lyon and two clear of Lille. Those two met on Saturday and drew 2-2. In Lille, the home team raced into a two goal lead with goals by Loic Remy, after 17 minutes, and Nicolas Pepe, after 28 minutes. Lyon, who drew by the same score against Manchester City on Tuesday to remain on course for the last 16 of the Champions League, by Bertrand Traore after 63 minutes and Moussa Dembele with four minutes to play. ""There is automatically a feeling of frustration among the players,"" said Christophe Galtier, the Lille coach. ""In the end, I'm happy with this point."" The Lyon president, Jean-Michel Aulas, also said he was happy with a point in the battle to finish second. ""A draw away against a direct opponent for the European places is a good result,"" Aulas said. ""We saw a good match and a very good Olympique Lyonnais (performance)."""
14,04/11/2018,23:16,Derby hammering of Marseille puts Montpellier second,Gaetan Laborde fired Montpellier to second in Ligue 1 with a brace that helped his side to a crushing 3-0 derby win over stuttering Marseille on Sunday.,"In-form Laborde struck with a neat header in the 51st minute and a fine curling strike after chaotic Marseille defending 11 minutes later to make it six goals in seven appearances in all competitions, as the home side ran riot early in the second half. Paul Lanse made sure of the result and put his side level on 25 points with Lille in the table with a neat side-footed finish with 20 minutes left. Montpellier took their chance to snatch second spot from Lille after their rival's 2-1 defeat at runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain on Friday night. PSG are 11 points clear of their nearest challengers after Kylian Mbappe and Neymar fired the champions their 12th straight win, beating Tottenham Hotspur's old 11-match record for consecutive wins at the start of a season. ""Yes it's serious, it's serious to play a second half like the one we played,"" said Marseille coach Rudi Garcia. ""So it will change. I am very angry, I am as responsible as the players for this defeat, but my team is the one that played the first half, not the second. How to explain it? I've no idea."" With Sunday's defeat Marseille slip back to sixth thanks to a last-gasp Romain Hamouma winner that gave Saint-Etienne a dramatic 4-3 win over Angers and allowed them to jump up to fifth.

15,22/10/2018,00:06,Vieira's Nice continue to struggle with Marseille loss,Patrick Vieira's Nice slumped to a fourth defeat in five home league games this season as Morgan Sanson's first-half strike fired Marseille to a 1-0 win in Ligue 1 on Sunday.,"It was a laboured performance from Nice, who sit 14th in the table and only two points above the relegation play-off spot, eight points adrift of fourth-placed Marseille. Vieira may need a good run of results if he is to keep his job long enough to take on former Arsenal and France teammate Thierry Henry when his side visit Monaco on December 8. ""Unfortunately, tonight's match reflects our other home games,"" said Vieira. ""(Forwards) Allan (Saint-Maximin), Mario (Balotelli) and Myziane (Maolida) have not been successful. In the last 30 metres there has been a lack of quality, we haven't always made the right choices."" For Marseille, all eyes will now be on next Sunday's clash with arch rivals and runaway league leaders Paris Saint-Germain at the Velodrome. The hosts went into the match having mustered only seven goals in nine league games this season, and Vieira responded by handing Mario Balotelli just his third start of the campaign up front. The first decent chance at the Allianz Riviera fell to the Italy international, but after latching onto a long ball forward from Dante his well-struck volley was kept out by the legs of Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda. A clever dummy from Balotelli created space for Allan Saint-Maximin, but his shot was tame and easily gathered by Mandanda. The away side grabbed the lead in the 42nd minute, though, as full-back Bouna Sarr skipped clear down the right-hand side and crossed for Sanson to smartly turn and fire into the bottom corner. Nice plugged away in search of an equaliser but never looked like having the quality to break through, with centre-back Dante's looping volley onto the roof of the net the best effort Vieira's men could muster. Balotelli, who was strongly linked with Marseille during the close-season before opting to stay at Nice, has failed to score this term after netting 43 goals over the last two campaigns. ""Mario? He was just like the team -- very good in the first half, then he wasn't as good. He still has to work,"" said Vieira. Earlier on Sunday, Montpellier moved into third as goals from Gaetan Laborde and Andy Delort sealed a 2-0 win over Bordeaux, while Saint-Etienne drew 1-1 against Rennes. Henry suffered a miserable return to French football on Saturday as Monaco lost at Strasbourg in his first match as a head coach, while PSG thrashed Amiens to make it 10 successive wins to start the season."
16,26/09/2018,23:14,Record-setting PSG make it seven wins in seven,Paris Saint-Germain set a new club record on Wednesday when a 4-1 victory over Reims gave them a seventh win from seven games this season and an eight-point lead in Ligue 1.,"With a perfect 21 points, new coach Thomas Tuchel surpassed the previous best start of 19 points by predecessor Unai Emery last season. The champions can now claim another slice of history on Saturday where a victory over Nice will allow PSG to equal Lille's all-time record of eight wins at the start of a season set back in 1936-1937. Missing the injured Lassana Diarra and suspended Kylian Mbappe, PSG surprisingly fell behind to Reims after just two minutes on Wednesday when Xavier Chavalerin stunned the Parc des Princes. But Edinson Cavani levelled after five minutes and then won the 24th-minute penalty which was converted by Neymar. Uruguay striker Cavani hit the third before half-time to take his season's goal tally to five, the same as Neymar. Thomas Meunier tucked away the fourth in the 55th minute after being set up by young striker Moussa Diaby much to the delight of watching US basketball legend Michael Jordan in town for this week's Ryder Cup. Moussa Dembele scored his first two goals for Lyon in two minutes in Dijon to set his team on course for an 3-0 victory that lifted them into second in Ligue 1. The 22-year old striker, who joined from Celtic on August 31, scored the opener after 17 minutes with a first-time chip over the goalkeeper and two minutes later added a second, acrobatically putting home a rebound. Martin Terrier headed a third in the 35th minute. On a night when six early matches produced six red cards, Lyon played the last 34 minutes with 10 men after Lucas Tousart received a second yellow card. Dijon's Enzo Loiodice followed in the final minute. Lyon are on 13 points from seven games, eight behind PSG. Lille, who started the evening in second, lost 1-0 at Bordeaux. Francois Kamano put the home team ahead after just seven minutes. Lille played the last few minutes with 10 men after Adama Soumaoro received a second yellow card. The other two teams who could have climbed to second, Marseille and Montpellier played games that followed similar patterns until the dying seconds. Montpellier fell behind at Caen to a goal by Saif-Eddine Khaoui after 10 minutes. Andy Delort and Damien Le Tallec resplied and put the visitors ahead and, briefly, second in the league. But Yacine Bammou leveled after 64 minutes. Seven minutes from time, Montpellier's Vitorino Hilton was sent off for a wild sliding tackle. Caen created dangerous chances, but Montpellier held on to draw 2-2. In Marseille, Kenny Lala broke away and put Strasboug ahead after 27 minutes. The home team replied twice just before half time. After Florian Thauvin was sent flying in the 41st minute, Dimitri Payet coolly converted the penalty. Then Morgan Sanson curled a shot inside the post to put Marseille ahead on the stroke of half time. After Jordan Amavi received a straight red in the 52nd minute the 10 men of Marseille held out until the 89th minute when Nuno Da Costa leveled for the visitors. Marseille responded with one last attack, and Valerie Germain met a low cross with a ferocious shot to secure a 3-2 win."
17,07/02/2018,23:07,Fekir sees Lyon into French Cup quarters,Nabil Fekir's penalty helped Lyon beat Montpellier 2-1 on Wednesday to reach the French Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 2012.,"Maxwel Cornet caught home goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte by surprise to give the visitors an early lead, only for Jonathan Ikone to quickly lash in an equaliser. But Fekir grabbed his 20th goal of the season with a 27th-minute spot-kick to restore his team's advantage. Lyon move into the last eight for the first time since winning the trophy for a fifth time six years ago, bouncing back from back-to-back league defeats that have seen them slip to fourth in Ligue 1. Coach Bruno Genesio made five changes to the side that blew a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 to 10-man Monaco at the weekend, and it was Cornet who made the most of his opportunity by giving them a 13th-minute lead. The 21-year-old latched onto Bertrand Traore's pass, and with Lecomte anticipating a cross, he fired home inside the near post with a clever first-time effort to score his fourth goal of the season. But Montpellier levelled just nine minutes later, as 19-year-old Paris Saint-Germain loanee Ikone met Paul Lasne's cutback to hammer into the top corner. It took Lyon less than five minutes to move back in front, though, as Pedro Mendes clumsily bundled over Fekir in the area, with the attacking midfielder picking himself up to slot in from the penalty spot. Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes had to make a couple of good saves in the second half, while Memphis Depay spurned an excellent chance at the other end, but the away side held on with relative ease. Earlier on Wednesday, Caen edged out Ligue 1's bottom club Metz on penalties after a 2-2 draw, while third-tier Chambly ended fourth-division outfit Granville's run and Lens beat top-flight side Troyes. Paris Saint-Germain continued their bid for a fourth straight title as Angel Di Maria scored a hat-trick in Tuesday's 4-1 win at Sochaux. Marseille are also through after Kostas Mitroglou and Lucas Ocampos both scored trebles in a 9-0 thumping of second-tier Bourg-en-Bresse."
18,31/01/2018,23:03,Falcao at the double as Monaco set up PSG League Cup final,Radamel Falcao struck twice as Monaco saw off Montpellier 2-0 on Wednesday to set up a French League Cup final against Paris Saint-Germain.,"Falcao put the hosts ahead in the 15th minute at the Stade Louis II, before Monaco were denied a penalty by the video assistant referee system. The Colombian doubled the lead before the half-hour mark, and although Rony Lopes had a second-period strike ruled out by video technology for offside, Leonardo Jardim's men eased to victory to book a final date with PSG on March 31. The hosts started brightly, with Andrea Raggi seeing a shot well saved by Montpellier goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte, but they didn't have to wait long to take the lead. Full-back Djibril Sidibe burst his way through before laying the ball off for captain Falcao to sweep home. Monaco thought they had been awarded a penalty just seconds later when Stevan Jovetic was brought down by Lecomte, but a VAR review showed that the keeper had played the ball before taking down the Montenegrin international. Montpellier, who were thrashed 4-0 by PSG at the weekend, continued to struggle and Monaco doubled their lead in the 29th minute. Fabinho unlocked the away defence with a clever pass, before Lopes broke free and crossed for Falcao to tap in his 22nd goal of the season in all competitions. Lopes thought he had added further gloss to the scoreline with 22 minutes to play, but another referral to the VAR showed that Falcao was narrowly offside before laying the ball back to the Portuguese midfielder. PSG continued their bid for a fifth straight League Cup title by edging to a 3-2 win at Rennes in the first semi-final on Tuesday, as they held off a spirited fightback from the hosts after Kylian Mbappe was sent off on a VAR decision."
19,28/01/2018,23:47,"Fabinho grabs Monaco point at Marseille, Bordeaux stun Lyon","Fabinho struck to secure French champions Monaco an entertaining 2-2 draw at southern rivals Marseille on Sunday, while Malcom was at the centre of a penalty controversy as Bordeaux stunned Lyon.","Both teams at the Stade Velodrome missed the chance to take second place from Lyon, with Paris Saint-Germain now 11 points clear at the Ligue 1 summit. Keita Balde gave the visitors a fourth-minute lead, but Marseille centre-back Adil Rami quickly levelled with a close-range header. The hosts moved in front shortly after half-time as Valere Germain headed in against his former club. But Fabinho waltzed through the hapless home defence to equalise for Monaco, denying Marseille a seventh straight win in all competitions and extending his team's unbeaten league run to eight matches. ""Fabinho played a big match today, not only for the goal but for his defensive quality and ability to break the line,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. The chase for the Champions League places remains wide open in France, with Lyon, Marseille and Monaco separated by just one point in the hunt for the second and third spots behind PSG. ""One point each was fair. In the war for second place there are no easy games, and it will continue like this until May,"" Jardim added. Senegal striker Balde, a close-season signing from Lazio, pounced on a loose ball to race clear and clip home his sixth league goal for Monaco and give them the perfect start. But the lead lasted less than three minutes, as Monaco shot themselves in the foot. A low cross from Valere Germain caused havoc and Florian Thauvin put pressure on right-back Almamy Toure, who saw his clearance deflected straight into the air for Rami to nod in his first league goal for Marseille. The game settled down after its frenetic start, but Rudi Garcia's hosts should have forged ahead in the 27th minute when Dimitri Payet blazed over with the goal at his mercy. Marseille completed the turnaround in the 47th minute, as Payet whipped in a free-kick and Germain stooped to send a diving header past away goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. It was the 27-year-old's 12th goal for OM since joining from Monaco last July. The champions hit back four minutes later, though, as Brazilian midfielder Fabinho strolled straight through the middle of the Marseille backline and slotted the ball in off the post. Monaco thought they had retaken the lead, but Jemerson's header was ruled out by the linesman's flag, despite the defender not being one of two visiting players in an offside position when Rachid Ghezzal swung in a free-kick. Both sides had chances to snatch all three points, with Marseille keeper Steve Mandanda denying Ghezzal and Germain volleying agonisingly wide, but neither could find the winner they needed to go second. Brazilian star Malcom appeared to dive for a crucial penalty as 10-man Bordeaux upset high-flying Lyon 3-1 to give new coach Gustavo Poyet a winning start in Ligue 1. Malcom, the 50 million-euro ($62m, £44m) rated winger who has been linked with Arsenal, also scored the 27th-minute penalty to give Bordeaux a shock 2-0 lead. Poyet had already seen Nicolas De Preville put the home side in front in south-western France, with Gaetan Laborde scoring another penalty for the hosts after Marcelo had pulled one back for Lyon. Bordeaux had another Brazilian, Otavio, sent off after the break but they held on to make it two wins from two games since previous coach Jocelyn Gourvennec was sacked. The result was a big blow to Lyon, who had beaten PSG at home last weekend and then won at Monaco in the French Cup on Wednesday. PSG beat Montpellier 4-0 on Saturday, with Neymar scoring twice and Angel Di Maria also on target after Edinson Cavani got the opener to take him to a club record 157 goals in all competitions."
20,13/01/2018,23:04,Monaco frustrated as Marseille sink Rennes,"Monaco stuttered to a 0-0 draw in the absence of Radamel Falcao at Montpellier on Saturday, while Marseille cruised to a victory over Rennes that kept them firmly in the Champions League race.","Colombian striker Falcao was again ruled out by a muscle injury that sidelined him for cup wins over Yzeure and Nice, and Monaco couldn't break down the league's meanest defence without their top scorer. Brazilian left-back Jorge drew an excellent stop from Montpellier goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte, who then pulled off a terrific reflex save to deny Kevin N'Doram to preserve a 10th clean sheet of the season. The stalemate at the Stade de la Mosson snapped Monaco's four-match winning run in Ligue 1 but sent them a point clear of Lyon in second, while leaving them eight points adrift of leaders Paris Saint-Germain. ""A draw is not a good result because we came to pick up three points,"" said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim. ""We were lacking quite a few things going forward. We'll try to be more competitive on Tuesday (at home to Nice) to achieve a better result."" Christophe Galtier made a winning start in his first league game in charge of Lille after replacing the sacked Marcelo Bielsa just before Christmas. Nicolas Pepe's 43rd-minute goal handed Lille a 1-0 victory at Caen and also prompted the dismissal of home goalkeeper Remy Vercoutre after he took umbrage at the Ivorian winger's exuberant celebration. The veteran Vercoutre was incensed by Pepe's 'robot' dance in front of the home fans and argued furiously with the goalscorer over what he felt was a provocation. Pepe appeared to be playing it up for a pitchside camera, and the 37-year-old Vercoutre was shown a straight red card. However, Lille also finished the match with 10 men after Fode Ballo-Toure was sent off early into the second half. Florian Thauvin scored his team-leading ninth goal of the season but also missed a penalty as Marseille brushed aside Rennes 3-0 at Roazhon Park. The former Newcastle winger saw a first-half spot-kick saved by Rennes goalkeeper Tomas Koubek but redeemed himself by setting up Valere Germain for the opening goal on 35 minutes. Thauvin's ninth assist of the season drew him level with Neymar, while Hiroki Sakai produced a brilliant goal-line block to deny Ismaila Sarr an equaliser, and minutes later Germain teed up Morgan Sanson to rifle in Marseille's second just before half-time. Thauvin completed the scoring eight minutes from the end when he nodded in a cross from Brazilian midfielder Luiz Gustavo. Marseille avenged a 3-1 defeat by Rennes at the Velodrome in September -- one of just three losses for Rudi Garcia's team this season -- to move level on 41 points with third-place Lyon. ""Tonight we saw a Marseille that I would like to see all the time,"" Garcia said. ""We work to play like that but it doesn't happen all the time."" Nice continued their resurgent form as Pierre Lees-Melou's deflected strike earned them a 1-0 home win over Amiens, while a Gaetan Laborde header gave Bordeaux a 1-0 victory at Troyes to halt a run of six straight defeats in all competitions. Edinson Cavani is in line to return for PSG at Claudio Ranieri's Nantes on Sunday after missing their last two matches following his delayed return from holiday, but Neymar has been sidelined by a rib injury. Lyon will go in search of a fifth straight league win when they host second-from-bottom Angers, but they will be without joint-top scorer Mariano Diaz as he recovers from a hernia operation."
21,19/11/2017,20:29,Lyon held to draw by Montpellier,Lyon's four-match winning streak in Ligue 1 came to an end in the absence of captain Nabil Fekir as they were held to a 0-0 home draw by Montpellier on Sunday.,"Bruno Genesio's men slipped to nine points adrift of league leaders Paris Saint-Germain after a disappointing performance, while they could lose third place to Marseille, who play Bordeaux later on Sunday. The hosts went into the game in a rich vein of form, having scored 21 goals in six league matches since a 2-0 defeat at PSG in September. But they had to make do without top scorer Fekir, with the 24-year-old suspended after picking up his third yellow card of the campaign for his celebration after scoring the final goal in the 5-0 derby thrashing of Saint-Etienne. ""Montpellier, who defended well, were good and we didn't know what to do to win,"" said Lyon defender Mouctar Diakhaby. ""It's certain that Nabil (Fekir) was missed today. We can not do without such a player."" Brazilian centre-back Marcelo added: ""We know that we have a good team, but when we miss a player of the quality of Nabil Fekir, it's obviously a big problem. He is very important for us."" Lyon coach Bruno Genesio replaced Fekir with Maxwel Cornet, with 20-year-old Tanguy Ndombele coming in for Bertrand Traore who was left on the bench. The hosts should have taken the lead less than 10 minutes in, but midfielder Houssem Aouar fired wide from close range. Midtable Montpellier also went close early on, with Paul Lasne crashing a 25-yard strike narrowly over the top of Anthony Lopes' crossbar. The best chance of the opening 45 minutes fell to Cornet, but after bursting through, the winger's tame effort was saved by the legs of Montpellier goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte. Memphis Depay struggled to make an impact on the left-hand side, curling an ambitious effort straight at Lecomte midway through the second half, while Traore was a peripheral figure after coming off the bench as the game fizzled out. Earlier on Sunday, Nice's miserable start to the season continued as Ronny Rodelin scored an injury-time equaliser for Caen in a 1-1 draw. Pierre Lees-Melou had given Nice a first-half lead, but with Mario Balotelli suspended, Lucien Favre's men failed to build on that advantage and are now just two points clear of the bottom two. PSG extended their lead at the top of the table over Monaco to six points by beating Nantes 4-1 on Saturday, with Edinson Cavani scoring a brace. Defending champions Monaco dropped two points in a 1-1 draw at newly-promoted Amiens on Friday, despite a second-half equaliser from Stevan Jovetic."
22,29/09/2017,22:54,Monaco held by Montpellier,French champions Monaco missed the chance to go top of Ligue 1 as Souleymane Camara struck an injury-time equaliser to snatch Montpellier a 1-1 draw at the Stade Louis II on Friday.,"After a slow start, Monaco struck first in the 38th minute as the red-hot Radamel Falcao slid in to score, but Montpellier kept their hosts at arm's length and Camara stunned the home crowd. Leonardo Jardim's men trail league leaders Paris Saint-Germain on goal difference, ahead of the capital club's home match against unbeaten Bordeaux on Saturday. Monaco went into the game after a surprising 3-0 Champions League loss at home to Porto in midweek. Coach Jardim responded by making five changes to his starting XI, welcoming back goalkeeper Danijel Subasic from injury, as well as reinstating close-season signing Stevan Jovetic alongside Falcao up front. Montpellier, who held PSG to a 0-0 draw last weekend, began the match on the front foot and they could have taken the lead when Pedro Mendes found himself with space inside the area, but the centre-back curled too close to Subasic. Monaco were not much-improved from the Porto defeat, but broke through before half-time as winger Rony Lopes got behind the away defence and crossed low for Falcao, who managed to bundle the ball over the line from point-blank range. The Colombian has now scored 12 goals in just eight Ligue 1 games this season. Monaco were far from their fluent best, and Montpellier were the stronger side for much of the second period, with full-back Ruben Aguilar volleying narrowly wide. The hosts came close to scoring a second goal, though, as Thomas Lemar ran clean through before dinking his effort past the far post. But Montpellier grabbed a deserved point in the second minute of injury-time as 34-year-old Senegalese forward Camara pounced to head home Kevin Berigaud's cross."
23,12/05/2016,13:33,Montpellier captain Hilton extends contract,French Ligue 1 outfit Montpellier said on Thursday that captain Vitorino Hilton has signed a one-year contract extension.,"The 38-year-old Brazilian defender is a vital part of the 2012 champions' team having played 35 league matches this season. Hilton joined the club from Marseille in 2011, having first come to France in 2004, joining Bastia on loan from his then Swiss employers Servette. He began his career at Chapecoense in his homeland."
24,04/05/2016,18:51,Montpellier set to build new stadium,"French top-flight side Montpellier will move into a new 25,000-seat stadium no later than 2021, the city's mayor announced on Wednesday.","Montpellier mayor Philippe Saurel confirmed to AFP that local authorities are ""working on the project of a new football stadium"" that will be ready by 2020 or 2021. The planned stadium will be majority owned by the local government, which is working on a budget of up to 130 million euros (£103m; $149m) for its construction. Montpellier, who won the Ligue 1 title for the first time in their history in 2012 and are set to finish this season in mid-table, currently play at the 35,000-seat Stade de la Mosson. It has been the club's home for more than 40 years and hosted matches at the 1998 World Cup, but average gates this season are under 13,000 and the stadium has been deemed no longer fit for purpose as it is ""extremely susceptible to flooding"". Storms in late 2014 led to the ground being shut for several months, forcing Montpellier to play their games at the city's rugby stadium."
25,08/04/2016,22:35,Cornet brace lifts Lyon into second,Lyon moved above Monaco and into second spot and automatic qualification for the Champions League with a 2-0 win at Montpellier on Friday.,"Maxwell Cornet's quickfire first half brace pushed the in-form former multiple champions onto 55 points, but in line for the ticket to the Champions League on goal difference. Monaco can regain second if they beat Lille on Sunday. This was Lyon's eighth win from their last 10 games, a run that has catapulted them back into contention for Europe's top club competition. Their fine run continued when Jordan Ferri set up Cornet for the 34th minute opener, with the striker following up from close range six minutes later after great work from Alexandre Lacazette. Aside from the three points Lyon will also have been relieved at the presence on the bench of Nabil Fekir. The France international missed seven months with a serious knee injury but returned to action with Lyon's reserve team last weekend. And the 22-year-old was introduced for Cornet with quarter of an hour to go for his first taste of Ligue 1 action since August 29. ""It's been seven months, it feels good to be back on the pitch,"" he said. ""I was waiting for him (coach Bruno Genesio) to call me up. We won, that's the main thing."" On his prospects of securing a place on Didier Deschamps' Euro 2016 France squad he added: ""Frankly, that would be a bonus. After an injury like mine it's complicated to comeback."" The loss left Montpellier hovering above the drop zone, four points from safety. On Sunday, Monaco face a taxing trip to Lille, who have undergone a remarkable turnaround under Frederic Antonetti and are gunning for a fifth win in a row. On Saturday, champions Paris Saint-Germain will use their visit to Guingamp to iron out the mistakes that plagued them in their 2-2 draw against Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final. Laurent Blanc's side have their hands full going into next week's return leg in England having drawn Wednesday's encounter 2-2 at the Parc des Princes."
26,05/03/2016,22:10,PSG keep powder dry before Chelsea showdown,"With numerous stars rested, Paris Saint-Germain settled for an uninspiring goalless draw at home to Montpellier on Saturday ahead of their crucial Champions League return clash with Chelsea.","PSG's enormous lead at the top of Ligue 1 and determination to progress in Europe meant this game was never the priority for coach Laurent Blanc, although things could have been very different had Edinson Cavani found the net rather than the bar early on. The draw allowed the defending champions to restore their 23-point lead at the top over second-placed Monaco, who drew 2-2 at Caen on Friday, and means they could still secure a fourth straight title when they host the principality club at the Parc des Princes on March 20. By then they will hope to have confirmed their place in the last eight of the Champions League for the fourth year running, but all depends on the second leg of their last-16 tie with Chelsea in London on Wednesday, into which they take a 2-1 lead. ""There is no reason to be satisfied, that game could have been won. We weren't efficient going forward, it's a shame there was no goal,"" said Blanc. ""The most important thing, though, and what makes me the happiest is that we didn't lose anyone to injury. We decided to let some players play and others rest. Overall, it was satisfactory."" Blanc rested a host of key players to keep them fresh and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was on the bench alongside David Luiz and Thiago Motta while captain Thiago Silva was not involved at all. While Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi were not fit, there was a return for Angel Di Maria but the home starting line-up also featured 20-year-old defender Presnel Kimpembe and midfielder Christopher Nkunku, who was making his first start in Ligue 1 at the age of just 18. Nkunku showed some nice touches in a first half that lacked intensity at a Parc des Princes once again far from full. The hosts almost opened the scoring from one of their first attacks as a Maxwell cross was turned onto the bar by Cavani, but other than that PSG only really threatened when Di Maria turned on the style. The Argentine produced some flashes of quality and also nearly found the net from a curling left-foot free-kick that forced Laurent Pionnier in the Montpellier goal into an excellent save high to his left. Di Maria then sent a low ball across the face of goal but Lucas, sliding in, was unable to make contact in one of the last acts of the first half. The state of Di Maria's fitness has been one of the biggest concerns for Blanc ahead of the game at Stamford Bridge and he was replaced after an hour to make way for Ibrahimovic. Despite the Swede's introduction, PSG could not break down their opponents, but they will recall that a 0-0 draw at home to Lille immediately before the first leg against Chelsea did them little harm. Montpellier, meanwhile, will be pleased as they continued their revival since the January appointment as coach of Frederic Hantz. Monaco could only draw in Caen despite twice taking the lead, as Ivorian forward Christian Kouakou scored a minute from time to secure a point for the home side. Nice reclaimed third spot after downing bottom side Troyes 2-1, but Lyon, who inflicted a first domestic defeat of the season on PSG last weekend, can return to the Champions League places when they entertain Guingamp on Sunday. Saint-Etienne missed the chance to leapfrog their bitter Rhone Valley rivals as they were held to a 0-0 draw at Angers, while Lille beat Reims 2-0 and Gazelec Ajaccio grabbed a late equaliser to draw 1-1 at Bordeaux."
27,04/03/2016,02:20,PSG focus on Chelsea ahead of Montpellier visit,Paris Saint-Germain head into Saturday's clash at home to a resurgent Montpellier with most eyes firmly fixated on next week's return leg at Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League.,"PSG rebounded from losing their 46-game unbeaten domestic run at Lyon last weekend by remaining on course to defend their French Cup crown after beating Saint-Etienne 3-1 in midweek. However, victory at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard potentially came at a cost with midfielder Blaise Matuidi facing a race against time to be fit for Wednesday's trip to Stamford Bridge. The France international was seen clutching his hamstring after he was taken off ""as a precaution"" midway through the second half, with Laurent Blanc admitting he was ""worried"" about Matuidi's fitness. Blanc will have to decide whether or not to rest key players ahead of the Chelsea clash, with Marco Verratti (groin) and Angel Di Maria (thigh) also struggling with injuries. The PSG boss though was pleased with the manner in which the runaway Ligue 1 leaders responded at Saint-Etienne after suffering their first defeat of the season. ""We can't erase (the loss), but we can use it to our advantage. That's what we did (on Wednesday) and I'm very happy about it. It was a good way to respond after the defeat which provoked quite a buzz,"" said Blanc, in quotes published by French daily L'Equipe. ""Montpellier will be a difficult match because we'll be thinking about the game against Chelsea which will be huge,"" said PSG captain Thiago Silva, with 2012 French champions Montpellier arriving in the capital on the back of three straight wins to pull clear of relegation trouble. ""We're ready for Chelsea. I think everyone knows what awaits us over there. I hope (Matuidi) will be able to play because he's an important player for the team,"" the Brazilian added. Defeat at Lyon means Paris can't clinch a fourth straight French title this weekend, but they could do so next week should Monaco slip up at fellow European hopefuls Caen on Friday. Monaco have lost just once in 15 league outings and have an eight-point cushion over Caen, who trail third-place Lyon on goal difference, in the race for the second automatic Champions League qualifying berth. Four wins in five has reignited Lyon's campaign and Bruno Genesio's side will bid to build on recent momentum when Guingamp visit Parc OL in Sunday's late game. A four-match winless run has slowed Nice's European charge, but they will fancy their chances of ending that series at home to bottom side Troyes on Saturday. Rennes and Nantes, unbeaten in the league since November, meet in the Brittany derby with both sides also firmly in the hunt for Europe, while Saint-Etienne travel to slumping Angers. Pascal Dupraz will embark on the daunting task of trying to salvage Toulouse's top-flight status having replaced Dominique Arribage ahead of Sunday's trip to Marseille. Toulouse are 10 points from safety and without a win in eight, but there is hope as Marseille have struggled mightily at the Stade Velodrome with just two wins all season and none in their last 11 home fixtures.

28,27/02/2016,19:16,"Montpellier continue revival, Toulouse's Arribage resigns",Former champions Montpellier moved further clear of relegation trouble in Ligue 1 on Saturday with a 3-0 win against Lille at a rain-soaked Stade de la Mosson.,"Kevin Berigaud opened the scoring after some fine play from Ryad Boudebouz and Bryan Dabo and young substitute Ellyes Skhiri were also on target for the home side. It was a third win in a row for the 2012 title-winners, who have claimed four victories and one draw in six matches since Frederic Hantz was appointed coach at the end of January. That run has lifted Montpellier seven points clear of the relegation zone, with Lille a point beneath them. Reims pulled four points above the drop zone with a 4-1 win over Bordeaux, but Toulouse are now 10 points from safety after conceding two stoppage-time goals in a crushing 2-1 defeat against Rennes. Toulouse coach Dominique Arribage resigned afterwards, with the club languishing in 19th place and winless in eight games. ""We have to prepare for the future. The situation was too difficult pyschologically for Dominique,"" Toulouse president Olivier Sadran told reporters. ""It's a very difficult situation morally. It's a match which reflects our season. We feel it's too difficult to win games, there's something wrong,"" he added. Lorient edged past bottom side Troyes 1-0 while Angers salvaged a 2-2 draw at Guingamp despite playing the second half a man down after the dismissal of skipper Cheikh N'Doye. Runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain visit Lyon on Sunday looking to extend their 46-match unbeaten run in domestic competition stretching back to March last year. Laurent Blanc's side make the trip without injured duo Marco Verratti and Angel Di Maria as well as defender Serge Aurier, banished to the reserves until the March international break. Before that, Monaco in second go to a Nantes side who have not lost in 15 outings since a 1-0 reverse in the principality in November. If Monaco slip up and PSG win, the capital club would have a chance of securing a fourth consecutive title next weekend."
29,06/12/2015,16:45,Controversial equaliser earns Marseille draw,"Marseille stumbled at home once again on Sunday, benefiting from a goal that should not have stood to draw 2-2 with Montpellier at the Stade Velodrome in Ligue 1.","Montpellier were in front twice thanks to a brace by Chad striker Casimir Ninga either side of a goal against his old club by Remy Cabella. But Marseille ensured a share of the spoils when Bouna Sarr arrived to convert a Georges-Kevin Nkoudou ball held up from the byline to the left of the box. It looked as if Nkoudou had done well to get to the ball before it crossed the line but replays later confirmed that no goal should have been awarded and a goal-kick given. It was a frustrating result for both sides, with Marseille still stuck in mid-table after seeing their run without a home league win extended to six games. Montpellier at least moved a point clear of the bottom three but were left to wonder what might have been. Ninga impressed with two goals in a 4-2 win at Lyon last week and he put the visitors ahead just after the half-hour mark after being brilliantly set up by Ryad Boudebouz. Cabella, the former Montpellier player now on loan at OM from Newcastle United, levelled early in the second half from close range but Ninga pounced on a Karim Rekik error to restore the away side's advantage before Sarr made it 2-2. Later on Sunday, Bordeaux entertain Guingamp with both teams looking to pull clear of the relegation zone before Saint-Etienne host Rennes knowing a victory could take them up to fourth. Paris Saint-Germain are a huge 15 points clear at the summit and still unbeaten domestically this season after Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice in a 3-0 win at Nice on Friday. Angers are up to second thanks to a 2-0 win against crisis-hit Lyon in the last Ligue 1 match at the Stade de Gerland as Cheikh N'Doye got both goals. Caen are third after losing 2-1 at home to a resurgent Lille, while Monaco leapfrogged Lyon into fourth as Lacina Traore's brace secured a 2-1 victory at third-bottom Bastia."
30,27/11/2015,22:42,Lyon in crisis after crushing defeat,Lyon completed a miserable week by slumping to a third straight defeat as they were thumped 4-2 at home by a resurgent Montpellier in Ligue 1 on Friday.,"Unheralded Chadian striker Casimir Ninga was the hero for Montpellier with a brace in between a Maxime Gonalons own goal and a Souleymane Camara strike for the visitors, who ran riot against shambolic Lyon defending at the Stade de Gerland. Alexandre Lacazette and Rachid Ghezzal netted for the home side, but this was a worrying performance from Hubert Fournier's team, who were lucky not to lose by a much wider margin. Soundly beaten 3-0 at Nice a week ago, last season's Ligue 1 runners-up were sent packing from the Champions League with a 2-1 home loss to Gent on Tuesday, and this was their fourth loss in five outings in November. Lyon remain in second place for now, but are 13 points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain and the five sides below them are all within three points so they risk plummeting down the table by Sunday evening. ""We had a difficult European campaign in which we made too many errors and now an early goal from my mistake put us in trouble,"" captain Gonalons told beIN Sports. ""We just need to keep working. Without a great performance by Antho (Lopes) we would have lost much more heavily. ""We are a big club and everything the people who were here before us built we must not throw away. We need to be men, not behave like boys."" The contrast with the good times of last season, when OL hammered Montpellier 5-1 home and away, were stark at a Gerland where both ends of the ground were left empty as a punishment for trouble after the recent derby win against Saint-Etienne and loud jeers rung out from the reduced crowd at full-time. After a dreadful start to the campaign, 2012 champions Montpellier were looking to extend a five-game unbeaten run in the league and score a third consecutive victory. They took an early lead when Gonalons turned a low Jerome Roussillon cross into his own net and Ninga doubled their advantage in the 11th minute, holding off Rafael before slotting past Anthony Lopes. Lyon quickly got back into the game as Lacazette nodded in after a Claudio Beauvue effort had been blocked on the line. However, Montpellier looked like scoring every team they broke into the home half and Lopes had to come to Lyon's rescue on more than one occasion before the interval, notably to save from Ninga. Nevertheless, Montpellier did score again within three minutes of the restart thanks to more horrendous defending. Rafael's short backpass put Roussillon through, and while Lopes saved at his feet, Ninga was on hand to convert the follow-up. It was a third goal in French football for Ninga, the 22-year-old striker from Chad who was playing in Gabon last season. Clement Grenier made his first appearance of the season after injury for Lyon when he replaced Mathieu Valbuena on the hour, but Montpellier continued to make chances and substitute Camara got a fourth goal when he finished after his initial effort had been saved. Ghezzal pulled another goal back from a free-kick for the hosts but that was scant consolation. PSG are at home to winless bottom club Troyes on Saturday while Nice have the chance to leapfrog Lyon into second when they go to Toulouse. The standout fixture of the weekend sees Marseille host Monaco on Sunday evening."
31,26/11/2015,02:30,Hurting Lyon redirect energy on home affairs,Lyon face Montpellier in Ligue 1 on Friday badly in need of a quick fix after being bundled out of the Champions League by Gent in midweek.,"The Belgian visitors' 2-1 win in the last European game to be played at the Stade de Gerland put an end to Lyon's hopes of reaching the last 16 in what has been a miserable continental campaign. The seven-time French champions are bottom of Champions League Group H with just one point from five games and now cannot even claim the consolation of a place in the Europa League in the new year. Hubert Fournier's team are in a better position domestically, but while they come into the weekend in second in Ligue 1 they are 13 points behind runaway leaders Paris Saint-Germain and just three points ahead of Saint-Etienne in seventh. OL were beaten 3-0 at Nice last weekend and followed that up with another loss against the Belgians despite Jordan Ferri giving them an early lead. Danijel Milicevic levelled with a free-kick before Kalifa Coulibaly's last-gasp winner which led to sports daily L'Equipe leading with the headline 'Pathetic' on Wednesday morning. Nevertheless, on the premise that every cloud has a silver lining, Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas suggested the premature ending of their European journey may not be a bad thing. ""It's perhaps a question of no pain, no gain. We are now going to focus all our energy on qualifying directly for the Champions League like we did last season,"" he said. But he cautioned: ""We're in a good position but we know that all that can be quite fragile. We must regroup now in Ligue 1. ""So this (Champions League exit) is a plus in terms of us tackling the league but a negative for our image because what's happened is way below our ambitions."" Captain Maxime Gonalons, suspended against Gent, makes his return but right-back Christophe Jallet is injured and Samuel Umtiti has been struggling with a thigh injury. Montpellier turn up in decent enough spirits with last weekend's 3-1 defeat of Reims lifting them one point clear of the relegation zone. After a dreadful start to the season, they have won three and drawn two of their last five matches to climb the table. On Saturday, PSG's home match against bottom side Troyes will be their first appearance at the Parc des Princes since the attacks on November 13 that left 130 people dead and hundreds injured in Paris."

33,21/08/2015,22:39,Matuidi strikes to maintain PSG's perfect start,A second-half strike by the excellent Blaise Matuidi gave Paris Saint-Germain a 1-0 win away to Montpellier on Friday as the French champions maintained their perfect start to the new Ligue 1 season.,"Matuidi's 61st-minute goal gave PSG a win that they deserved for their dominance of possession in a match of few chances on a hot night at the Stade de la Mosson. The capital club have won their opening three games of the campaign, all without conceding a goal, making this their best start to a season since 1999. And this result also allowed them to extend their club record run of consecutive Ligue 1 wins to 12, meaning they are now just two more victories short of levelling the overall record held by the Bordeaux side of 2009 that won the title. Laurent Blanc was the coach of that Bordeaux team and his current PSG side look a cut above the rest of France already this season, although in Montpellier they were facing opponents who had already lost their opening two matches without scoring a goal. David Luiz came close to giving PSG an early lead, his dipping and swerving free-kick being beaten away by Jonathan Ligali in the Montpellier goal. The visitors were then dealt a blow as Javier Pastore was forced off with an apparent calf injury inside 10 minutes, his place being taken by Adrien Rabiot. Chances were and few between, with Ezequiel Lavezzi stabbing a shot wide after pouncing on a Jonas Martin mistake on the edge of the box seven minutes before the interval. Edinson Cavani had the ball in the net shortly after the restart only to be denied by a marginal offside call, while before that Kevin Trapp, the summer signing from Eintracht Frankfurt, excelled at the other end with a fine save to tip over Ramy Bensebaini's header. The only goal arrived just after the hour mark, Maxwell exchanging passes with Lavezzi before feeding Matuidi, whose left-foot shot beat Ligali at his near post. It was a second goal in as many games for the tireless France midfielder, who opened the scoring in the 2-0 victory over Gazelec Ajaccio last weekend, and it secured a club-record sixth straight away win in the top flight. On Saturday, last season's runners-up Lyon host Rennes before Monaco, beaten 3-1 at Valencia in the first leg of their Champions League play-off in midweek, entertain Toulouse. Marseille, beaten in each of their opening two matches, play their first game under newly-appointed Spanish coach Michel at home against Troyes on Sunday."
34,28/07/2015,18:16,Montpellier defender El Kaoutari joins Palermo,"Moroccan international defender Abdelhamid El Kaoutari has agreed a deal to move from Montpellier to Serie A outfit Palermo, the French club announced on their website on Tuesday.","On the books when Montpellier won the French title in 2012, El Kaoutari came up through the youth system and has made 170 appearances for the southern club. He has now agreed a four-year deal with Palermo, although the transfer fee was not revealed."
35,10/05/2015,16:49,Montpellier win to retain European hopes,Montpellier claimed a last-gasp 1-0 win at Lens on Sunday afternoon to keep alive their chances of snatching European qualification from Ligue 1.,"Anthony Mounier scored the winning goal, his eighth of the season, in stoppage time after latching onto a pass from Ellyes Skhiri. Before that, Montpellier had been unable to break down already-relegated Lens, who were reduced to 10 men after Loick Landre's 64th-minute sending-off. Montpellier remain seventh in the table with two games left but are only three points adrift of Bordeaux in sixth, which will be good enough to qualify for next season's Europa League as long as Paris Saint-Germain beat second-tier Auxerre in the French Cup final later this month. Later on Sunday, European contenders Saint-Etienne host Nice before Marseille take on Monaco in a crucial game at the Stade Velodrome. Marseille, who will start the game five points behind third-placed Monaco, have to win to retain any hope of qualifying for next season's Champions League at the principality side's expense. PSG's 6-0 hammering of Guingamp on Friday coupled with nearest rivals Lyon's 3-0 capitulation at Caen on Saturday means the capital club are now on the brink of winning a third successive Ligue 1 title. Paris are six points clear of OL with two games left so need just a point away to 2012 champions Montpellier next weekend to take the crown."
36,08/03/2015,23:26,Fekir inspires five-star Lyon back to top,Lyon moved back up above Paris Saint-Germain to the top of the Ligue 1 table on Sunday after Nabil Fekir inspired them to a thrilling 5-1 victory at Montpellier.,"Fekir and the league's leading scorer Alexandre Lacazette both bagged braces, and Corentin Tolisso was also on target as OL recovered from falling behind to an early Lucas Barrios goal at the Stade de la Mosson. It was a very welcome victory for Hubert Fournier's side, who won just once in five Ligue 1 outings in February, and it ensures they end the weekend where they started it, on top of the table. Reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain had temporarily gone top after easing to a 4-1 win at home to Lens on Saturday, but OL are a point clear of the capital club again, and four ahead of Marseille in third. Montpellier came into the game on a run of just one defeat in seven matches and they took the lead just six minutes in when Barrios tapped in after great work by Bryan Dabo. It was the Paraguayan's eighth goal in his last 10 Ligue 1 games, but in Fekir and Lacazette Lyon boast the most exciting attacking duo in France this season. The visitors were back level on the half-hour mark, Lacazette converting from the penalty spot after Fekir was brought down in the box by Abdelhamid El Kaoutari. And the outstanding Fekir then scored a magnificent goal to put OL in front, cutting in from the right and playing a one-two with Yoann Gourcuff before curling a shot past Geoffrey Jourdren and into the far corner of the net. It was a 10th goal of the season for the talented Fekir, who has been at the centre of a tug of war between Algeria and France, with both desperate for him to commit his international future to them. Fekir and Jordan Ferri both hit the bar in the second half before Fekir scored again to take him to 11 for the campaign, chipping in after another Gourcuff assist. Montpellier could have set up a nervy finale after they won a penalty when Samuel Umtiti was harshly adjudged to have fouled Paul Lasne in the area. However, Barrios saw his penalty saved by Anthony Lopes, and Lyon went on to add two more goals in injury time. Substitute Mohamed Yattara set up Tolisso for the fourth goal and then laid the fifth on a plate for Lacazette -- his 23rd of the season -- as Lyon repeated their 5-1 win against Montpellier in the reverse fixture in October. Earlier on Sunday, Saint-Etienne brought their seven-game winless streak to an end with a 2-0 victory over strugglers Lorient on Sunday and leapfrogged Bordeaux into fifth place, closing in on the European places. Yohan Mollo came off the bench to break the deadlock with just 15 minutes to go before Max-Alain Gradel made sure of all three points in injury time, with both goals coming after Lorient's Didier Ndong had been sent off. ""It's an important win for us. We needed it after last week's draw at Toulouse and the French Cup win,"" said Saint-Etienne coach Christophe Galtier, whose team needed penalties to win at third-tier Boulogne-sur-Mer in the Cup. ""We have had quite a few injuries lately and lost a few players so there have been some changes in the team. ""But this has given us the chance to look at some of the younger players. And the substitutes have played their part, too."" Meanwhile, Guingamp slumped to a third straight league defeat, going down 1-0 at home to Lille with Nolan Roux scoring the only goal of the game. The weekend also saw Marseille win 6-1 at Toulouse and fourth-placed Monaco triumph 3-1 away at Evian."
37,01/03/2015,19:00,Montpellier edge Nice to close on European places,Nice found the back of the net for the first time in five games but couldn't keep their lead in a 2-1 defeat against Montpellier on Sunday.,"Eric Bautheac's penalty after 36 minutes put the visitors in front but Bryan Dabo fired a rapid equaliser just before the break. Lucas Barrios, who initiated the play with a deft backheel, pounced on a deflected Souleymane Camara attempt to grab the winner in the 66th minute. The former Borussia Dortmund forward's seventh goal of the season lifted Montpellier level with Bordeaux in sixth, one point behind Monaco. Earlier, a Yacine Bammou strike offered Nantes their first win of 2015 when they beat Guingamp 1-0 in a hard-fought Brittany derby. On Saturday, leaders Lyon were stunned 2-1 by Lille in their first defeat in 12 games on Saturday. Their defeat gives Paris Saint-Germain the chance to climb above OL into top spot if they can win at in-form Monaco later Sunday. Lyon, however, remain four points ahead of third-placed Marseille, who suffered a shock 3-2 defeat at home to Caen on Friday."
38,03/02/2015,17:58,"Camara, Deplagne commit to Montpellier","Ligue 1 club Montpellier have extended the contracts of striker Souleymane Camara and defender Mathieu Deplagne, the French outfit confirmed on Tuesday.","Former Senegalese international Camara, 32, will remain in southern France until June 2017 with Deplagne staying until June 2018. Camara arrived at the club in July 2007 on loan from Nice, winning the Ligue 1 title for the first time with the club in 2012, and scoring 56 goals in 261 matches. Deplagne, 23, who has played 44 top flight matches, extended his deal by two years. Montpellier are sixth in the league, 13 points behind leaders Lyon."
39,08/01/2015,02:15,Marseille aim to bounce back from Cup humiliation,Marseille will look to put the disappointment of their shock French Cup exit behind them and extend their lead at the top of the Ligue 1 table when they go to Montpellier on Friday.,"Marcelo Bielsa's side endured a disastrous start to 2015, losing on penalties to fourth-tier Grenoble in the last-64 of the French Cup after throwing away the lead three times. It was bitterly disappointing for Bielsa, who took Athletic Bilbao to the Copa del Rey final in 2012 in his first season in Spain, and the Argentine accepted the blame for the exit. ""I have more responsibility than my players for the defeat,"" he said. ""I was in charge of a team that had all the assets needed to win. There is no explanation for such a defeat."" Nevertheless, their Cup exit and the fact they are not involved in European competition this season mean Marseille can now focus all their attention on their quest to win a first Ligue 1 title since 2010. OM took the symbolic title of autumn champions after ending 2014 two points clear of Lyon and three ahead of reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain. An outstanding run of home form, featuring nine consecutive wins since a 2-0 loss to Montpellier in August, has been behind their rise, while their away form has been rather more patchy. Marseille have now gone six away games without a win in all competitions before facing Montpellier at the Stade de la Mosson, which has not hosted a match since the end of September, when it was put out of action by serious floods. Since then, Montpellier have hosted games at the home of the city's Top 14 rugby club, where they were beaten 3-0 by PSG in the French Cup on Monday. ""We are delighted to not have to play on that pitch anymore although we do thank them for helping us at a difficult time after the floods,"" said Montpellier coach Rolland Courbis, who played for Marseille and later coached his hometown team. With Africa Cup of Nations-bound Andre Ayew and Nicolas Nkoulou both absent, Marseille could be vulnerable, and their challengers will be hoping they slip up ahead of the bulk of the weekend slate. After a turbulent week overshadowed by the late return from Christmas holidays of Edinson Cavani and Ezequiel Lavezzi, PSG got back on track by beating Montpellier in the Cup and now go to Bastia on Saturday. Neither Cavani nor Lavezzi, who missed a training camp in Morocco while in South America, played against Montpellier and both will again be left out against Bastia. However, coach Laurent Blanc will be looking for a repeat of the Cup display, in which the likes of Yohan Cabaye and Clement Chantome came in and impressed. ""Since our training camp in Marrakech I have noticed a new momentum. I was satisfied with the way we played against Montpellier but we will need to repeat that performance against Bastia, where it will be just as difficult to play football,"" said Blanc. Propelled by 17-goal top scorer Alexandre Lacazette, Lyon are targeting a ninth straight home win when they face Toulouse on Sunday, while fourth-placed Saint-Etienne will attempt to extend a 10-game unbeaten run in the league as they face Reims away. Fifth plays sixth at the Stade Louis II on Sunday night when Monaco entertain Bordeaux in a match which will see visiting coach Willy Sagnol return to the ground where he played between 1997 and 2000. Monaco will be looking for revenge for a 4-1 defeat at Bordeaux back in August and, fresh from winning their last seven games, should be an entirely different proposition this time. Meanwhile, a minute's silence will be held at all Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 matches this weekend in honour of the 12 people who died when armed gunmen stormed the Paris offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly on Wednesday.

They played a League Cup tie against second-tier Ajaccio at the Altrad Stadium on Tuesday and the agreement means they will remain there for the time being, starting with Saturday's game against Evian."
41,17/08/2014,19:29,Bielsa's Marseille jeered off in defeat,Marcelo Bielsa's first home game as coach of Marseille ended in a chorus of jeers after a deflating 2-0 defeat to southern rivals Montpellier on Sunday afternoon.,"A goal in each half from Anthony Mounier and Morgan Sanson handed Montpellier the points and left OM still looking for their first competitive win since Argentine Bielsa was appointed in the summer with the brief of reviving their flagging fortunes. However, it was a good afternoon for Saint-Etienne, who came from behind to beat Reims 3-1 at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard and are so far the only side to have won their opening two games of the new Ligue 1 campaign. Marseille's Stade Velodrome was holding its first game since work finished on a new main stand, completing refurbishment work done for Euro 2016, which France will host. A crowd of 53,000, including UEFA president Michel Platini, watched OM looking to claim victory after throwing away a two-goal lead to draw 3-3 in Bastia last weekend, but Montpellier put a spanner in the works when they opened the scoring in the 18th minute, Mounier lobbing into the net with Steve Mandanda off his line. As Marseille pushed forward in search of an equaliser in the second period, Bielsa took off Brice Dja-Djedje and sent on an extra forward in Michy Batshuayi, but they were hit on the break as Mounier's low cross was converted by Morgan Sanson in the 68th minute. A frustrating day for the hosts was summed up soon after when Romain Alessandrini crashed a shot off the post, and although Andre-Pierre Gignac then put the ball in the net, the effort was disallowed for a handball by Alessandrini. After holding champions Paris Saint-Germain last weekend, Reims took the lead in Saint-Etienne just before the half-hour mark when summer signing Benjamin Moukandjo, the Cameroon international, burst into the box and sent in a shot that deflected off Loic Perrin and into the net. They nearly struck again just before the interval, when Stephane Ruffier did well to tip a net-bound Gaetan Charbonnier strike over the bar. However, Reims hadn't won in Saint-Etienne in the top flight since 1959, when Just Fontaine scored a hat-trick in a 5-2 victory, and they will have to wait at least another year after Les Verts fought back in the second half. A brilliant Max Gradel free-kick from 20 yards brought the hosts level in the 61st minute, before summer signing Kevin Monnet-Paquet, formerly of Lorient, headed in a Mevlut Erding cross at the back post. Turkey striker Erding then put the seal on the win eight minutes from time, appearing unmarked to convert a low cross from the right by Romain Hamouma. Later on Sunday, Monaco will be looking for their first points under new coach Leonardo Jardim when they face Bordeaux away. On Saturday, PSG brushed aside SC Bastia 2-0 with Lucas and Edinson Cavani on target, but their win was overshadowed by the early loss of Zlatan Ibrahimovic due to a side strain and an after-match incident in the tunnel which saw Bastia's Brazilian striker Brandao headbutt Thiago Motta, leaving the PSG player with a bloodied nose."
42,12/08/2014,20:59,Barrios eager for Montpellier impact,"Paraguay striker Lucas Barrios spoke of his desire ""to stay in Europe"" as the reason behind his decision to join the 2012 French champions Montpellier on a season-long loan from Spartak Moscow on Tuesday.","""I wanted to stay in Europe and be at a well-run club and Montpellier offered me this opportunity,"" Barrios said after completing the move, adding that there had been interest from ""a number of clubs"". ""I want to thank the president and the coach for having confidence in me and for letting me come here. I'm happy to have this new experience and I hope it will be a success."" Barrios, 29, is a two-time Bundesliga champion with Borussia Dortmund (2011 and 2012), from where he went to Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande before landing in Moscow. However, he endured a difficult time in Russia where he made just four league starts last season after suffering an injury shortly after his arrival from China. ""I went through a difficult period at Spartak. It was the only place where I didn't play. I started by getting injured and my replacement then played well. Football is like that,"" Barrios reflected before looking ahead to his new French adventure. ""My goal is to intregrate well within the team. I'm going to try to do the things I have to in order to help the team finish high in the table."" The 23-times capped Argentina-born Paraguayan will likely be ready to make his debut against Marseille this weekend in the second round of Ligue 1 matches."
